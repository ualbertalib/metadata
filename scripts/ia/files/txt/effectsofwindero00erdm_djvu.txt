EFFECTS OF WIND EROSION ON THE COMPOSITION AND 


FERTILITY OF SOME ALBERTA SOILS 


R. L. Erdman 


INTRODUCTION 


During the past several years, soil erosion by the 
wind has assumed alarming proportions, not only in Alberta, 
but also in Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in large areas of 
the semi-arid plains in the United States,, It Is not a new 
problem In Canada or the United States, for it has occurred 
periodically in the past. Soil drifting was recorded in 
western Canada as early as 1887 (23), but the first serious 
occurrence in Alberta was not reported until 1920 (17). At 
no previous time, however, has It assumed the sinister aspect 
with which it confronts the people of Canada and the United 
States at the present time. The governments of these 
countries, having awakened to the seriousness of the situation, 
have finally taken steps to combat this evil. In the United 
States, a Soil Erosion Service was established in 1933, and 
this department was enlarged in 1935, and renamed as the 
Soil Conservation Service, with wide powers to attempt to 
alleviate the grave situation existing In a large section of 
that country. In Canada, aside from conferences and re¬ 
commendations, direct action was not taken until 1935, when

through the "Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act”, machinery was 
set in motion to study wind erosion and to check its devast¬ 
ations. In the same year, the province of Alberta passed its 
own "Control of Soil Drifting Act", coming into effect the 
following year, which subjected the occupier of the land to 
certain penalties for failure to use various control measures 
if wind erosion caused damage to adjacent lands (41)♦ Further, 
the provincial government has placed 8 million acres of 
marginal and submarginal land in the drought and wind-erosion 
area under spec5al government administration to avoid further 
damage in certain areas insofar as possible. 

Causes of Wind Erosion * Wind erosion or soil drifting 
as it is commonly termed, is not limited to the bald prairie 
region in the southern and eastern portions of the province* 

It has been reported in the central parkland area, and even 
up to the Peace River district (45)* It is therefore not 
peculiar to any soil zone or even soil type, although some 
soils are known to drift more readily than others (14, 44)* 

The specific causes of soil drifting (41) have been listed as: 

(1) Insufficiency of root fibre in the soil. 

(2) Lack of cohesion between the soil particles 
themselves* 

(3) High winds In conjunction with low precipitation* 

(4) Tillage methods conducive to drifting or 
conducted at untimely periods.

In regard to the first point, it should be noted that 
fibre refers to the undecomposed plant residues and not to the 
humus content of the soil. The humus, or the decayed organic 
material appears to facilitate soil drifting (23), although it 
may have a binding effect on lighter soils (20), Other factors 
such as soil temperature and surface turbulence of the air 
currents appear to affect soil drifting also to some extent. 

Effects of Wind Erosion , Wind erosion has affected 
over 16 per cent, of the total land area of the United States, 
or a total of 322 million acres (21), Of this figure, 9 
million acres have been designated as "ruined”, and another 
80 million acres "badly damaged". It has been estimated that 
in the United States the direct toll of wind erosion is 400 
million dollars annually (20), 

In western Canada, of the total cultivated area, 26 
per cent, is in fallow, much of which is susceptible to wind 
erosion. In 1934, 8-| million acres of cropped land were 
affected by drought and soil drifting, or 16 per cent, of the 
total cultivated area (23). The removal of one inch of top 
soil in the black soils of Alberta would indicate a replacement 
loss of between $200.00 and $300.00 per acre in considering 
only the nitrogen and phosphorus (45). This figure would 
range from $80.00 to $120.00 per acre in the brown and dark 
brown soils. This tremendous loss of the soil constituents 
is often overlooked, or not realized. After wind removal, the

subsurface soil may also be lower in plant nutrients and the 
physical condition may be changed. These phases are discussed 
in detail in later sections. 

Besides the actual soil damage, there are various 
other results from wind erosion. Among these may be mentioned 
the injury to crops (which is often wrongly considered the most 
important loss), damage to shelter belts, fences, roadways, 
machinery, buildings, live stock and to the people themselves, 
resulting in physical ailments, and also demoralizing effects 
on their mental attitudes (see Plates IV and V). The necessity 
for combatting soil drifting by the use of various control and 
emergency measures (20,25,31,32,34,38,43,45) Is quite apparent. 

HISTORICAL 


The effects of wind erosion in ancient times have 
received considerable study in late years. Dr. Reitz (33) 
in a very Interesting manuscript, points out that nation after 
nation has fallen because of the exploitation and erosion of 
the soil. The mystery of why civilizations such as Persia, 
Assyria, Babylonia and Chaldea developed on lands now having 
a soil largely barren and desert, has thus been explained. It 
has also been noted by various authors (21,27,33) that accord¬ 
ing to the findings of archaeologists, large portions of the 
Sahara and Gobi deserts were once inhabited and teeming with

life. Similarly It Is claimed that approximately 500 cities 
flourished In the present arid plains of Asia Minor. Similar 
devastation has occurred In Peru, the home of the oldest 
civilization on the western continent. Only from recent aerial 
photographs, can the shape and form of ancient walls, now 
entirely drifted over by sand, be recognized (27). Fears have 
been voiced from different quarters that unless some drastic 
measures are taken, a similar fate may be In store for the 
"dust bowl" of the United States, and for portions of western 
Canada (see Plate VI). 

Although scientific data in regard to erosion of 
soils by water, are becoming quite voluminous, only a limited 
amount is available on the effects of wind erosion. The first 
report noted was by Ellis In 19$0 (16), indicating the loss of 
organic matter caused by the wind In the soils of south 
western Manitoba. Various publications of a general nature 
(9,10,14,17,23,24,31,41,45) have been issued since. However, 
actual laboratory studies on the effects of wind erosion were 
not presented until 1935, when Moss (30) reported the results 
of investigations in Saskatchewan of the effects of wind erosion 
on the chemical and physical constituents of the soil. During 
the same year. Fly (18) Issued a report on the chemical and 
mechanical analyses of dust deposited by the wind in Oklahoma. 

In 1936, additional results on the effects of wind erosion on 
the nitrogen and organic matter content of Oklahoma soils, were 
published by Daniel and Langham (13). Simultaneously another

paper was published by Daniel (12) reporting the physical 
changes in soils produced by the wind* Waksman (42) has 
presented a paper of a very recent date drawing attention to 
the detrimental effects which erosjon may cause to the micro¬ 
biological life of the soil, through the loss of organic matter 0 
All of these technical papers, with the exception of the last 
one mentioned, are discussed in detail later under their 
respective sections. 

METHODS AND MATERIAL 


Methods * Total nitrogen, both in the soil and in 
the wheat was determined by the official Gunning-Hibbard 
method (4). The duplicates were checked to a difference of 
0.009 per cent, of each other. 

In regard to organic carbon, several methods were 
available. For reasonable accuracy, coupled with comparatively 
quick results, Schollenberger 1 s chromic acid method, as 
modified by Allison (1,37) was employed. The soil sample was 
mixed with powdered potassium dichromate, concentrated sul¬ 
phuric acid added, and then the mixture brought to 175°C. in 
90 seconds. After cooling, it was diluted with distilled 
water, and titrated with ferrous ammonium sulphate, using 
diphenylamine as indicator. Duplicates were checked to a 
difference of 0.04 per cent, of each other.

Total organic matter was determined as the organic 
carbon multiplied by the generally recognized factor of 1*724* 

Mechanical analyses were conducted on all the samples 
by the Bouyoucos 1 hydrometer method (5,6)* This method has 
been shown to be quite accurate In comparison with the pipette 
method (8). The soil samples were first dispersed by sodium 
silicate and sodium oxalate. Hydrometer readings were recorded 
at given Intervals and the percentages of the soil fractions 
were calculated from the records* The percentages of silt and 
clay were determined according to the new standards of the 
United States Bureau of Soils, effective January 1st, 1958 (3)* 

The pot experiment was carried out as described In a 
later section. 

Total phosphorus and acid soluble phosphorus were 
determined on too few samples to warrant the results being 
recorded. 

It should also be noted that all the chemical analyses 
were determined on air-dry weights, while the mechanical analyses 
were conducted on water-free soil samples* 

Material * The soil samples used in this project were 
collected in various parts of Alberta during the fall of 1936, 
summer of 1937, and the samples from one profile in January, 

1938, In all, 27 locations were sampled, resulting in 87 
individual samples. At each location samples were taken of 
the normal (that is undrifted from all intents) cultivated

surface soil; the accumulated drift, and the exposed subsurface 
after wind removal* In addition to these, six dust samples 
were collected at two of these locations as indicated later in 
Table I. 

In all cases composite samples were taken, being the 
aggregates of four or five smaller samples a few rods apart# 
Each group of samples, that is the normal soil, accumulated 
drift, and the exposed subsurface, was taken as close together 
as possible, and in all cases, excepting sample number 122, 
within 100 yards* All samples other than drift were from 
cultivated fields, except number 271, which was from virgin 
sod, as a normal cultivated sample of this particular type was 
not available in proximity# The samples of accumulated drift 
were collected from the depositions along fences or roadsides, 
and In a few cases from hummocks which formed in the field 
around stationary objects* 

The samples of dust, that is numbers 134 to 137, 274 
and 275, were collected at various heights from dwelling 
houses, vacant and occupied# 

A complete list of the samples, together with their 
locations and descriptions is given in Table I* In each case, 
the sample numbers ending with the digit "l ,f , refer to normal 
surface soil; in "2" to the accumulated drift, and in M 3 M to 
the exposed subsurface. Samples ending in digits above 3 refer 
to dust samples collected at different heights*

It should also be pointed out, as noted in Table I, 
that various degrees of drifting had occurred on the different 
soils. That is, the fine sands had in all cases been subjected 
to severe erosion. The intermediate types had drifted moder¬ 
ately, with a few exceptions. The clay loams also had eroded 
moderately, but in the clays one out of the two had exhibited 
severe erosion. 


OUTLINE OF INVESTIGATION 


In order to give the reader a better comprehension 
of what is to follow in the course of this study, a brief 
outline is given of the research conducted in this connection* 
These subdivisions are listed in the order they appear later 
in the discussion* 

I* A brief study was conducted In regard to wind 
data for five points located in different sections of the 
province, and comparisons were made with wind observations 
from the "dust bowl" of Texas and Oklahoma. 

II. A preliminary pot experiment was carried out to 
observe the response of growing plants to some normal and 
drifted soils. 

Ill* Mechanical analyses were made of all the soil 
samples collected in order to ascertain the effect of wind 
erosion on the physical texture of the soil*

IV. Certain chemical analyses were conducted with 
the object of determining the effect of wind erosion on the 
soil fertility* 

V. A limited study was made of the chemical and 
mechanical analyses of dust samples in comparison with the 
normal soil of the same vicinity* 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 


I* Wind Studies 


In this section Is Included a brief examination of 
meteorological data respecting winds in various parts of Alberta, 
and at some points located in the wind-orosion area of the 
United States. This study was quite preliminary, and the 
results examined In most cases covered only a brief span of 
years. However, it was pointed out by Daniel (11), that there 
was only a slight change In wind velocity in the "Panhandle" 
of Oklahoma in the ten year period 1925 to 1934, which includes 
some of the years of severe wind erosion. In data submitted 
by Joel (25) for the twenty-five year period 1910 to 1934 in 
northern Texas the variability was somewhat greater. The 
surprising feature noted in these data was that although the 
mean annual velocity for the last two years recorded, that is 
the years of severe erosion, was slightly greater than for

several years preceding them, nevertheless it was just equal 
to the average of the mean annual velocities for the twenty- 
five year period* The precipitation figures for these same 
two years were just one half of the long term average* These 
facts seem to Indicate that the amount of rainfall may be 
just as important as the wind in determining the degree of 
soil erosion* 

In Table II is presented the mean monthly and annual 
wind mileages and the numbers of gales during the years 1932 
to 1935 (inclusive) for which data were available for a number 
of Alberta points (29)* It might also be pointed out that the 
years under consideration were not all drought years or those 
of excessive drifting, as in 1932 reasonably good yields were 
obtained in southern Alberta when the wind mileage was con¬ 
siderably above that of 1933, when only one half the previous 
year’s yield was realized (41)* The points compared In this 
table are Lethbridge, Medicine Hat, Calgary, Lacombe and 
Fairview (Tp* 81, H* 3, W* 4), located In widely separated 
parts of the province* The figure appended illustrates dia- 
grammatlcally the data from Table II* 

In observing this figure it will be noted that 
Lethbridge has by a considerable margin, the highest mean 
monthly wind mileage of any point studied In the province* In 
that area, the greatest winds occur in the winter and the early 
spring months* A very similar trend Is exhibited at Medicine

Hat and Calgary# This condition Is unfortunate in that section 
of the province as during these periods of high winds the 
ground is often hare of snow, and the grain has not had time 
to grow sufficiently to protect the soil© These conditions, 
leading to serious soil drifting in the winter and early spring 
months, have been pointed out by Fairfield (17) and Palmer (31)# 
At Laoombe and Falrview mean monthly wind trends are 
somewhat different* At Lacombe, all the months give consider¬ 
ably lower readings than at any of the other four stations* 

The wind mileages at Fairview range in between the Lacombe and 
Calgary figures* The winter winds at Lacombe and Fairview are 
the lowest of any during the year, and the maximums are reached 
in April and May respectively* However, the mean maximum 
monthly wind mileage at Lacombe is Just one half of that at 
Lethbridge* From the table, it also appears that the calmest 
month of the year at Lethbridge, Medicine Hat or Calgary has 
still a greater wind mileage than the windiest month at Lacombe* 
In the second section of Table II Is listed the mean 
monthly and annual numbers of gales (winds over 31 miles per 
hour according to meteorological standards), at these same 
Alberta points* These data should be useful in determining 
the locations where severe wind erosion is likely to occur* 

The results for the gales follow a similar, though more exag¬ 
gerated, trend as that of the mean monthly wind mileages* One 
outstanding feature of this table is that although Lethbridge

has a mean annual wind mileage (82,226 miles) only slightly 
higher than that of Medicine Hat (77,585) or Calgary (79,228), 
yet the number of gales, viz. 24, is double that at the other 
two points* This appears to Indicate that the wind from the 
Crows Nest Pass is of a somewhat greater velocity and blows 
more in fits and starts in its initial stages, but steadies 
down as it extends further east* It is not surprising from 
the data on wind mileages that Lacombe has an average of only 
one gale, and Fairview four* 

The number of gales occurring in a given locality 
is very important from the viewpoint of soil erosion, as under 
average conditions, a wind of 31 miles per hour may cause 
considerable drifting. However, various authors have submitted 
different velocities for soil-eroding winds. Johnson and 
Saunderson (26) in Montana give 21 miles per hour as the velocity 
of a soil-moving wind* Brandon and Kezer (10) in Colorado 
state that it requires a wind of 30 miles per hour to start 
soil erosion, but once started even a 12 mile wind will sus¬ 
tain it* Joel (25) however considers a soil-eroding wind as 
one blowing 35 miles per hour* Staple and Chepil (40) at the 
Soil Research Laboratory, Swift Current, found in an actual 
test under a given set of conditions, that drifting occurred 
with a wind of 15*7 miles per hour, but not at 14*2 miles per 
hour* However, these readings were taken at a 10 inch height 
and they point out that velocities are somewhat higher even

at 30 inches* It was also noted (40) that the velocity of a 
soil-moving wind depends on the temperature and surface 
turbulence of the air, besides on the soil factor itself 0 

In Table III a comparison is made of certain specific 
wind data from points in Alberta, Oklahoma and Texas* One 
surprising feature is that the mean annual wind mileages for 
Qoodwell, Oklahoma (11), and for Dalhart, Texas (25), located 
in the so-called "dust bowl", are considerably lower than for 
Southern Alberta* It is also very interesting to note that 
Lacombe has 52*5 per cent, less wind than Lethbridge, while 
Medicine Hat and Calgary are only slightly lower® The numbers 
of gales were not available for the locations In Oklahoma and 
Texas* 

Figures were also scrutinized for the maximum wind 
mileages in 24 hours for the five Alberta points during the 
same period* Lethbridge again was the highest, with 808 miles 
in 24 hours (January, 1934), or an average of 33*7 miles per 
hour during the whole period® Calgary followed close with 781 
miles in 24 hours (April, 1933), or an average velocity of 
32*5 miles per hour® At Medicine Hat, 682 miles (February, 
1932), was the maximum recorded, equaling 28*4 miles per hour* 
Fairview and Lacombe were considerably lower totalling 568 
(May, 1932) and 457 (April, 1933) miles in 24 hours, or 23*6 
and 19*0 miles in one hour respectively* Such continuous high 
winds as recorded at Lethbridge, Calgary and Medicine Hat would

Another brief survey was conducted in regard to the 
prevailing wind directions. Geib (19) states that In the 
Panhandle of Oklahoma only 32 per cent* of the wind blew from 
one direction and that damaging winds occurred from any point 
of the compass* However, It was computed from the data avail¬

west, and 17 per cent* from the southwest* Fairview was 
somewhat similar with 35 per cent, from the southwest and 29 
per cent, from the west. These prevailing wind directions 
are quite important in determining the direction of strips 
as used in strip farming practices for the control of soil 
drifting* 

In concluding this section on wind studies, several 
important points were noted. Conclusions should not be drawn 
from four year averages, but the winds, at any one location 
appear to be quite stable from year to year, although the 
seasonal variation may be considerable. The figures submitted 
indicate that the wind In the southern and eastern section of 
Alberta is double that in the central section, with that at 
Fairview Intermediate to these locations* Also it was noted 
that the y/ind at two points of the f, dust bowl” of the United 
States was considerably lower than In southern Alberta. Figures 
on the numbers of gales Indicated that at Lethbridge twice the 
number occurred as at any of the other points in the province. 

A study of prevailing directions Indicated that the winds in 
southern Alberta were consistently from the westward direction, 
while they were quite variable at Lacombe and Fairview.

II. Pot Experiment 


This experiment was arranged merely as a preliminary 
study in order to observe how growing plants responded to 
eroded and non-eroded soils, under a similar set of conditions a 
The results cannot be considered as conclusive, due to the 
limited scope of the experiment. However, some Interesting 
observations were notedo Such an experiment, under controlled 
environmental conditions, should be more reliable than ordinary 
field results. In the latter case, differences in crop growth 
may be caused by varying moisture conditions, tilth, aeration, 
or other physical factors which can be largely overcome in a 
pot experiment in a greenhouse. 

In Table IV is recorded the mechanical and chemical 
analyses of the soils used in the pot experiment. It will be 
noted that the three categories of four different soil types 
were used, that Is the normal cultivated surface, accumulated 
drift, and exposed subsurface samples of fine sand (Carmangay), 
silt loam (Barons), loam (Claresholm), and clay (Barons). The 
soil sample numbers are also recorded so that a more detailed 
description and location of the samples can be obtained by 
reference to Table I. However, it might be pointed out here 
that the fine sand had been subjected to severe erosion while 
the other three soil types had drifted only moderately. Also 
It might be noted that the Individual soil samples were tested

Just in duplicate, due to insufficiency of samples for any 
greater replication* 

By reference to Table TV, it is observed that the 
mechanical analyses of the soils vary considerably in some 
cases, and very little, if any, in others* In regard to the 
fine sand, it is noted that the accumulated drift has increased 
considerably in the sand fraction, and also has lost nearly 
half its silt and clay, as compared to the normal sample* The 
exposed subsurface has deteriorated similarly, containing even 
less silt, but more clay* In the silt loam, the physical 
differences between the normal and the accumulated drift are 
practically insignificant* The exposed subsurface sample is, 
however, slightly lower In sand and higher in clay* In the 
loam samples, no variation is present In any of the three 
classes or categories. The normal and drift of the clay soil 
are also identical, but the subsurface is somewhat lower in 
sand and higher in the clay fraction* 

In considering the chemical analyses, it is observed 
from the table that the fine sand exhibits very striking dif¬ 
ferences. The accumulated drift In this case has lost nearly 
60 per cent, and the exposed subsurface 70 per cent, of the 
nitrogen present In the normal cultivated surface soil* 

Similar differences are disclosed in the organic matter contents 
of these samples. In respect to the silt loam, differences In 
nitrogen and organic matter of the normal and the accumulated

drift are negligible. There is however a slight decrease in 
nitrogen, and a somewhat greater loss in organic natter of the 
exposed subsurface as compared to the normal soil. The signi¬ 
ficant feature of the loam soil is the higher percentage of 
nitrogen and organic matter in the drift sample. The subsurface 
is practically identical to the surface. In the clay samples 
there is a significant difference between the accumulated drift 
and the exposed subsurface. The former is somewhat higher in 
nitrogen and organic matter than the normal, and the latter is 
materially lower in both of these constituents. 

Procedure. The individual samples of soil were 
thoroughly mixed and transferred Into duplicate 6 inch clay 
pots. In all cases 1750 gram3 (approximately 4 pounds) of 
air dry soil were used. Moisture conditions were brought to 
the optimum by adding 15 per cent, by weight, of water to the 
fine sand, 20 per cent, to the loam, 25 per cent, to the silt 
loam and 30 per cent, to the clay samples. Then the total 
weight of each pot was recorded and the pots were maintained 
at these figures by the addition of water every second or third 
day. On October 8, 1937, the 24 pots were seeded to wheat. 
Reward variety being used in preference to Marquis in order to 
hasten maturity. Five kernels were seeded to each pot, then 
thinned to four plants on October 22, and to three to avoid 
overcrowding on November 2. All the pots were kept in the 
Soils* greenhouse until November 4, and then, through the

courtesy of the Field Crops Department, they were transferred 
to the latter^ greenhouse, where artificial lighting was 
available to stimulate growth. The temperatures in both cases 
ranged from 50 to 75°F. averaging close to 65°F. 

Results and Discussion * The first shoots to appear 
were in the fine sand on October 15, seven days after planting. 
However no general trend was noticeable in each soil type 
except on the clay soils. In this case, the samples on the 
exposed subsurface were the last to emerge, namely on October 
19, or eleven days after seeding. 

The wheat on the fine sand made the most rapid growth 
at first and by October 29, just three weeks after planting, 
differences were noticeable between the sand samples themselves. 
That is the plants in the accumulated drift and the exposed 
subsurface soils showed signs of lagging behind those in the 
normal fine sand. No significant variations were discernible 
in the other three soil types. 

In Plate I is illustrated the pot experiment as it 
had progressed by November 18, when the photographs were taken. 
Each group of six pots is arranged in a similar manner, that 
is the first two pot3 contain normal surface soil, the middle 
two accumulated drift, and the final two exposed subsurface 
samples. In observing (a), that is the pots containing fine 
sand. It is noted that the plants in the normal soil are 
distinctly superior to any of the others in this group. The

accumulated drift and the exposed subsurface samples have had 
at this stage, an equally retarding influence on the plants* 

Also it was recorded that the color of the plants on these 
soils was somewhat paler and chlorotic as compared to the 
wheat on the normal fine sand* 

In observing (b), (c) and (d) In Plat© I, no signi¬ 
ficant differences can be noted between the various pots on 
the silt loam, loam and clay soils respectively* 

On December 10, 1937, the first heads appeared, 
namely one on each of the three classes of fine sand and two 
In one of the normal loam pots* The following day a second 
head emerged on one of the normal fine sands* By December 12, 
the third day since heading commenced, spikes were present on 
the plants in all categories of the four soil types except on 
the exposed subsurface of the silt loam, and on the accumulated 
drift and exposed subsurface of the clay* By December 14, heads 
had formed on all the soil types and classes. The tendency in 
time of heading therefore appeared to be a slight delay on the 
exposed subsurfaces of the silt loam and of the clay* It 
should also be recorded that although heads formed simultaneous¬ 
ly on all of the fine sand pots, those spikes on the accumulated 
drift and on the exposed subsurface samples were considerably 
smaller than those on the normal soil. No differences In size 
were recorded on any of the other 3oil types.

In Plate II Is presented Illustrations of the plants 
as they appeared on December 23, that is on the fourteenth day 
after heading commenced* It was considered at the time that 
heading was completed, but additional spikes continue to 
appear on the normal silt and on all the clay soils until 
January 21, 1938* 

In checking over the (a) figure in Plate II, some 
striking differences are observed* The tendencies appearing 
on the corresponding print taken a month earlier are at this 
stage considerably accentuated* The plants on the normal fine 
sand are well-developed with reasonably good-sized heads* 
However the plants on the accumulated drift samples give in¬ 
dications of dwarfing and under-nourishment* They are about 
12 inches shorter than those on the normal soil and the heads 
are approximately one half the size* The plants on the exposed 
subsurface samples are still less developed* Their maximum 
height is only 20 inches (allowing 6 inches for the pot), just 
one half of those in the normal soil* The heads are still 
further reduced than on the accumulated drift samples* On the 
whole these results indicate that wind erosion has rendered 
very serious damage to the productivity of this soil, the 
exposed subsurface apparently being more deficient in available 
plant nutrients than the accumulated drift* 

In checking over (b), (c) and (d) in Plate II no 
significant differences can be observed from the prints* All 
the plants in these 18 pots are well developed, and the

differences between duplicates, in some cases are greater than 
between the three categories of the respective soil types. 

Wind erosion therefore has not caused any visible damage to 
these soils up to this stage insofar as plant growth is con¬ 
cerned. There was, however, a minor difference in the numbers 
of heads which was further accentuated at the conclusion of 
the experiment. 

This preliminary pot experiment came to an abrupt 
end on January 21, 1938, when some of the plants in four of 
the pots were damaged by a rodent. It had been hoped to mature 
the wheat and determine differences in the weight of grain, but 
under the circumstances it was deemed best to use the total 
weight of the plants as the standard. Furthermore seed-setting 
had not fulfilled expectations, whether due to light conditions 
in midwinter, artificial lighting used, or to soil factors, was 
difficult to determine. 

The plants were consequently clipped off on January 
22, 1938, and the total weight from each pot recorded at the 
time of cutting. As the plants had only advanced to the soft 
dough stage, they were thoroughly dried and the air dry weights 
also recorded. In addition the numbers of heads, total and 
fertile, was noted. As another point of Interest the duplicate 
samples of the whole plant were ground up together and the 
nitrogen content determined. 

In Table V is presented the complete data on the 
final results of the pot experiment, together with the nitrogen

content of the corresponding soils listed in the last column 
at the right. Prom these data, some interesting points are 
observed. Firstly, there is generally good agreement between 
the different sets of duplicates both in regard to the weights 
of plants produced, and in the numbers of heads formed. In 
regard to the fine sand, very striking differences occur in 
total weights. The average air dry weight of the plants on 
the accumulated drift Is less than one half of that on the 
normal soil, and those on the exposed subsurface are less than 
on quarter. The results of the silt loam soils follow the 
same trend, but the differences are minor, particularly between 
the weights of the plants on the accumulated drift and the 
normal soils. In regard to the loam soil, the plants grof/n 
were practically Identical in weights in all cases. On the 
clay soils, the plants on the exposed subsurface equalled those 
on the normal, but those produced on the accumulated drift were 
25 per cent, higher In total weight. 

Another interesting feature recorded in this table 
is the number of heads produced. The normal fine sand produced 
a total of three heads in each pot, of which two In each case 
were observed to be fertile. On the drift samples, three 
considerably smaller heads were produced in each pot, but not 
one was fertile. In the pots containing the exposed subsurface 
soil, three heads still more dwarfed in size were formed, but 
none of these had developed any kernels. This sterility in the

grain may have been influenced by seasonal, or light factors, 
but it also has been noted by Griffiths (20) that on badly 
eroded soils sterility of cereals may be prevalent* 

In regard to the silt loam samples, four heads on 
one and five on the other normal sample were produced, with 
only three each on the accumulated drift and exposed subsurface 
samples. However, in observing the spikes for the presence of 
kernels, it was found that in each case just three of the 
heads were fertile. 

In considering the loam soils, each of the duplicates 
in the three categories produced just three heads. In respect 
to their fertility no differences could be determined. The 
numbers of heads bearing grain on the normal and drift were 
identical, and on the exposed subsurface, two unclassified 
heads had been removed by a rodent, thereby leaving this point 
in doubt. 

On the clay soils the numbers of heads which finally 
formed were considerably higher than on any of the other soil 
types, the clay itself being very materially higher in total 
nitrogen. On the normal clay, there were six heads in one and 
seven in the other duplicate. On the accumulated drift sample, 
there were eight and nine, while the exposed subsurface samples 
yielded seven spikes each. In regard to their fertility, there 
were three heads bearing kernels on each of the normal samples, 
three and four on the dr?ft and two and three on the exposed 


subsurface samples

The results for the nitrogen content of the total 
plant are somewhat conflicting, although they do correspond 
to the data on the number of fertile heads except for the fine 
sand* In this case the per cent, nitrogen In the plants was 
higher In those produced on the drift and subsurface samples 
than on the normal soli, which was the only one giving rise to 
fertile heads. This peculiarity can be reconciled by the fact 
that the proportion of leaves to the total plant was consider¬ 
ably higher In the dwarfed specimens on the eroded soils, than 
In those on the normal soil* In regard to the silt loams, the 
nitrogen content of the plants was the same for those from 
the normal and drift soils, but was somewhat lower for the 
wheat plants grown on the exposed subsurface. On the loam 
soils, the nitrogen content was greatest for the plants on the 
normal soil, with that in the plants from the drift and sub** 
surface slightly lower and practically equal to each other* 

The clay soils, in spite of their rank growths, also had the 
highest nitrogen content In the crop produced. In this case, 
the plants on the accumulated drift were somewhat higher in 
nitrogen than those on the normal or subsurface soli samples. 

In comparing the nitrogen content of the soils, as recorded in 
the last column, with that of the plants, there is a tendency 
for the two to correspond, with the exception of the fine sand. 
There Is, however, a better agreement between the nitrogen 
contents of the normal and eroded soils In all cases, and the 
total weights of the plants produced.

In concluding this section on the pot experiment, 
some Interesting points were observed namely: 

(1) The effect of wind erosion on fine sand soil 
samples was noted on plant development as early as three weeks 
after seeding. These differences were accentuated In later 
stages, as Indicated by the illustrations* 

(2) Silt loam, loam, and clay soils, subjected to 
moderate drifting, did not have any visible effect on plant 
growth at months after seeding* 

(3) Significant differences in the total weights of 
the plants were noted 3-| months after planting, in all the 
eroded soils except on the loam samples* 

(4) Minor, though probably significant differences 
were noted in the numbers of heads formed, total and fertile, 
on all except the loam soil* 

(5) Differences in the nitrogen content of the plants 
tended to follow that of the soils on all except the fine sand 
samples. 

These results indicate on the whole that the fine 
sand soil type was seriously damaged by wind erosion. Insofar 
as actual crop production is concerned, only minor Injury was 
incurred to the silt loam, and little effect on plant develop** 
ment was noted in the loam and clay samples used*

Ill# Mechanical Analyses 


Mechanical analyses were conducted on all of the 
normal, accumulated drift and exposed subsurface samples by 
the method as previously outlined, to determine the effects 
of wind erosion on the physical composition of the soil# It 
must be remembered, however, that a mere comparison of the 
varying percentages of the soil fractions does not present a 
complete picture of the situation# According to Bradfield 
(9), wind or water erosion, by removing a portion of the top 
soil and organic matter, may destroy the natural soil aggregates, 
leaving an impervious, deflocculated surface, even though the 
change in the actual percentages of the various soil fractions 
may have been relatively slight# Such a physical environment 
reduces microbiological activity (42), and in consequence the 
supply of available plant nutrients is decreased. We thus 
see that the physical environment may be just as important as 
the chemical composition of the soil In relation to crop 
production# 

It Is generally conceded that a medium-textured soil 
is preferable to a light or heavy one for ordinary crop pro¬ 
duction. That is, a soil of the loam or silt loam type Is more 
friable and easier to work than a heavy soil, has a better 
moisture-holding capacity than a light soil and absorbs it 
more readily than a heavy one. Such an ideal soil is one which 
contains a considerable amount of silt with reasonable

percentages of sand and clay® We shall note later how wind 
erosion has affected this Ideal balance of the various soli 
fractions® 


Results and Discussion ® In Table VI Is recorded the 
mechanical analyses of the Individual normal and eroded soils® 
For convenience, and purposes of comparison the soils are 
arranged according to type® The soils are compared under three 
general classes, that Is the coarse-textured soils. Including 
the fine sands and fine sandy loams; the medium-textured soils 
or loams and silt loams; and the flne-textured soils. Including 
the clay loams and clays. Further, In Table VII Is presented 
the average mechanical composition of the soils in these three 
classes. It might also be noted here that although the clay 
ratio was suggested by Bouyoucos (7) as a criterion of the 
susceptibility of soils to erosion, it was found by Daniel (12) 
to have very little relation to wind erosion® It was con¬ 
sequently not determined by the writer. 

In considering the data in Tables VI and VII, In 
regard to the fine sands and fine sandy loams, we find a 
consistent increase in the sand content of the accumulated 
drifts, ranging from 12.1 per cent, to 48.1 per cent, with the 
average 18.9 per cent. Similarly there is a consistent and 
very considerable decrease In the silt content of the drift, 
ranging from 20.6 per cent, to 80.0 per cent., averaging 55.8 
per cent* Further the clay content also has been reduced very

In respect to the exposed subsurfaces of the fine 
sands and fine sandy loams, with which we should be vitally 
concerned, as in the drifted areas these are now the surface 
soils, we find a somewhat similar trend* The average Increase 
in sand is less, being 4*8 per cent*, and the decrease in silt 
averages 19*1 per cent, of the normal. However, in this case 
we have a slight increase in the clay fraction, namely by 3*9 
per cent, of the normal sample.

It Is apparent therefore that wind erosion has 
effected serious damage to the texture of these particular 
soils, both in regard to their accumulated drifts and their 
exposed subsurfaces. 

In observing the data in Tables VI and VII for the 
loams and silt loams, we find considerable variation. In 
regard to the sand fraction in the accumulated drifts from 
these medium-textured soils, the range is from an increase of 
48.4 per cent, to a loss cf 14.6 per cent. The average for 
the fifteen samples gives a net increase of 17.2 per cent, in 
the sand content as compared to the normal surface soil. In 
regard to the two exceptions recorded, this decrease in the 
sand content in the drifts can be explained by the fact that 
although the wind appears to sift out the finer particles, 
depositing the coarser on the drifts. In these samples under 
discussion, the drifting had apparently advanced to the heavier 
subsurfaces, and this heavier material, drifting as granules, 
was also carried to the accumulated drifts. 

The silt content of the accumulated drifts also 
varied considerably ranging from a loss of 81.5 per cent, to 
a gain of 11.5 per cent., but averaging a net loss of 18.6 
per cent. However, there were only three samples In fifteen 
with higher silt reading and these were in the silt loam type 
rather than loams. 

In observing the clay content of the accumulated 
drifts, the range is from a decrease of 33.3 per cent, to an

increase of 48.0 per cent, resulting in a net 103s of 7«6 
per cent, for the fifteen samples. The large increase of 48.0 
per cent., and two of the other three samples with the higher 
clay readings, were from silt loams with heavier subsurfaces. 

In the exposed subsurfaces of these me diurn-textured 
soils, there is a variation in sand from an increase of 16«0 
per cent, to a decrease of 30 o 5 per cent., but averaging 3.1 
per cent, below that of the normal surface. The silt content 
varies from a loss of 31.6 per cent, to a gain of 16.0 per cent., 
with a net loss of 2.5 per cent. In regard to the clay the 
range is from 11.5 per cent, below to 57.7 per cent, above 
normal, the average indicating an increase of 21.2 per cent, 
in clay. 

On the whole then, the medium-textured soils have 
been affected considerably less by wind erosion than the fine 
sands and fine sandy loams. Although there has been a consid¬ 
erable increase in the sand and a loss in the silt content of 
the accumulated drifts, the data for the exposed subsurface 
samples, with which we should be more deeply concerned, indicate 
only minor changes in sand and silt, but a material increase 
in clay. This apparent resistance of the medium-textured 
soils to wind erosion has been noted by various authors 
(14,20,41,44,45). 

In observing the data on the clays and clay loam 
soils, the tables show that the sand content of the accumulated

drifts varies from a slight increase (4,5 per cent.) to a 
decrease of 82.9 per cent., with average indicating a loss of 
15.5 per cent. The exceptionally large decrease in sand in 
the one clay sample, namely No. 182, is not surprising when it 
is noted that this particular sample was the only one of this 
group which had drifted severely, leaving a heavier subsurface 
exposed to wind action. 

The silt content in these accumulations exhibits 
smaller differences ranging from 3.0 per cent, below to 20.4 
per cent, above normal, with an average increase of 3.6 per 
cent. The clay content varies from an insignificant loss in 
the case of one sample, to an increase of 35.7 per cent., with 
an average gain of 10.2 per cent. 

The mechanical analyses of the exposed subsurfaces 
reveal a very similar trend to that of the accumulated drift 
samples. The sand fraction varies from 54.5 per cent, above 
normal to 82.9 per cent, below giving an average loss of 11«2 
per cent. It should be pointed out that these two extremes 
are really exceptions in both cases as the one is a clay loam 
sample with a lighter subsurface, and the other, a clay, has 
a considerably heavier subsurface. The other individual samples 
in this group show only slight variation, so that the average 
figure is probably of more value than the degree of variation. 

The silt content of the exposed subsurfaces exhibits 
narrow variations, that is from a loss of 14.0 per cent, to a

gain of 16*6 per cent, or the average Is 1.0 per cent, above 
that of the normal. The clay fraction also varies both ways, 
that Is from a decrease of 19.2 per cent, to an Increase of 
30.5 per cent, giving an average Increase of 11.0 per cent. 

It appears, therefore, that although there Is con¬ 
siderable variability In some of the Individual samples, on 
the average, the clay drift Is only slightly higher In sand 
and lower In clay than the normal soli, the slit content re¬ 
maining quite stable. The exposed subsurfaces of the flne- 
textured soils are also practically identical to the accumulated 
drifts in the case of these fine-textured soils. 

Comparison of Results with Those from Other Sources . 

In Table VIII is recorded the average mechanical analyses of 

some normal and eroded soils from Oklahoma, as listed by 

Daniel (12), and from Saskatchewan as determined by Moss (30). 

These results again are grouped Into the three broad classes 

of coarse-textured, medium-textured and fine-textured soils. 

In comparing these data of Daniel and Moss with those in Table 

VII, it must be remembered that the writer 1 * * * * * VII, VIII, s own results are 
computed according to the new standards of the United States 
Bureau of Soils (3) for silt and clay. Therefore, although 
the actual sand contents may be comparable in Tables VII and 

VIII, the silts and clays may not be cross compared. The new 
standards reduce the clay and raise the silt contents by 
approximately 25 per cent., but to overcome this approximation.

It was deemed best to draw comparisons only between the per¬ 
centages of loss or gain rather than between the actual amounts 
present. 

In comparing the differences in the sand content of 
the accumulated drifts in the coarse-textured soils in Tables 
VII and VIII surprisingly close results are noted in all three 
cases. The increases range between 18«9 per cent, and 22.3 
per cent., the writer 1 s own figure being the lowest of the 
three. In regard to the silt fraction, the losses are all very 
high, varying from 50.4 per cent, to 60.9 per cent., the writer 1 s 
own figure in this case being intermediate to the two listed. 
Again, the clay content in all cases. Indicates a considerable 
loss, namely from 30.9 per cent* to 45.8 per cent, with the 
writer’s figure falling between these two. 

In respect to the subsurface samples, no data were 
available in the study conducted In Saskatchewan. The data 
for the subsurface samples of the Oklahoma soils, as listed in 
Table VIII are not altogether comparable to the writer’s own 
work, as in the former case the samples were actually taken 
at a depth of 12 to 18 Inches, whereas In the latter case, as 
previously noted, the exposed subsurfaces was used. However, 
these two locations are very close to the same horizon of the 
soil profile. 

From Tables VII and VIII we note then, that in the 
coarse-textured soils, the difference in the sand content of

the exposed subsurfaces is slightly above in the fomer case, 
and slightly below the normal in the latter case. However, in 
both tables there are substantial decreases in the silt 
fraction. In regard to the clay In the exposed subsurfaces, 
we note increases in both tables, though an insignificant one 
in Table VII. 

On the whole then, surprisingly close corroboration 
is noted In three sets of results, indicating that to the coarse- 
textured soils wind erosion has effected grave damage. That is, 
in the accumulations, the sand content of these already too 
sandy soils Is increased considerably and the silt and clay 
have very materially been removed. In these subsurface samples, 
the sand content approximates that of the normal, but there is 
a significant decrease in silt and an increase in clay. 

In regard to the medium-textured soils it is observed 
from Tables VII and VIII, that both Daniel and Moss obtained 
their greatest increases in the sand content in the accumulated 
drift samples. The writer*s results are somewhat lower than 
the other two. However, in all three cases, the actual sand 
content in the drifts of these medium-textured soils i3 not 
equal to that of the coarse-textured soils. In regard to the 
silt content In the accumulated drifts of those soils, we have 
consistent and significant decreases. In all cases, however, 
the losses of silt are less than in the coarse-textured soils. 

A consistent los3 is also noted In the clay fraction in the

three sets of data, which is also consistently less than in 
the lighter soils* 

In comparing the subsurface samples of the medium- 
textured soils, it is observed that both in the Oklahoma and 
Alberta soils, the subsurfaces have remained practically of 
the same sand content as the normal surfaces. In Oklahoma, 
however, the figures indicate a considerable loss of silt, 
whereas the writer’s results exhibit a very small loss. The 
clay content of these subsurfaces is substantially higher in 
both cases. 

It appears, therefore, that although wind sortation 
has effected considerable changes in the accumulated drifts of 
the medium-textured soils, still the actual percentages of 
sand are significantly lower, and the losses of silt and clay 
considerably less than Is the case In the coarse-textured soils. 
It also is observed that the mechanical analyses of the sub¬ 
surface samples in both tables approximate that of the normal 
soils a 

The physical analyses of fine-textured soils as 
affected by wind erosion exhibit quite different trends. In 
the accumulated drifts of the samples from Oklahoma the sand 
content Is somewhat Increased. However, Moss obtained a very 
slight Increase and the writer’s own results exhibit a decrease 
In the sand fraction. The figures for silt indicate a better 
agreement. Although Daniel obtained a significant decrease of

this constituent, Moss’s figure Is Identical to the normal soil, 
and the writer’s Is practically the same as that of Moss. In 
the clay content, Daniel’s figures Indicate a slight decrease. 
Moss’s are Identical again, and the writer’s exhibit a slight 
Increase of this constituent In the drift samples. 

In the subsurface samples of the fine-textured soils, 
both the Oklahoma and Alberta results Indicate a slight decrease 
In sand and an Increase In clay, with a minor variation In the 
silt content* In other v/ords, the subsurface samples are only 
slightly heavier than the normal surface In these samples* 

In regard to the effects of wind erosion on fine- 
textured soils. Insofar as mechanical analyses are concerned, 
there appears then to be conflicting results. In the case of 
the accumulated drifts, Daniel found that In Oklahoma, a 
significant Increase In sand occurred, with decreases In silt 
and clay* Moss’s figures Indicate that the drift Is Identical 
to the normal* The writer’s own results approximate those of 
Moss. In regard to the subsurface samples, the tv/o tables 
reveal that In the fine-textured soils, the subsurfaces are 
only slightly heavier than the normal surfaces. 

Concluslons » In concluding this section on the 
effects of wind erosion on the mechanical analyses of soils, 
several observations are recorded: 

(1) In the accumulations from coarse-textured soils, 
there was a large increase In sand, in conjunction with the

loss of one half the slit and one third the clay* The sub¬ 
surfaces also Indicate significant decreases of the slit 
fraction. These results were closely corroborated by other 
Investigators In Oklahoma and Saskatchewan. 

(2) In the accumulations from medlun-textured soils, 
the Increase In sand was slightly less, and the losses In slit 
and clay were significantly less than In the lighter soils. 

The exposed subsurfaces Indicated significant Increases In clay 
with slight losses of silt and sand. These results in the 
medium-textured soils were not altogether in accordance with 
those of Saskatchewan and Oklahoma* 

(3) In regard to the fine-textured soils, the 
accumulated drifts and the exposed subsurfaces varied only 
slightly from the normal surface samples. These results were 
In agreement with those from Saskatchewan, but In the Oklahoma 
samples a certain degree of wind sortation had also occurred 
on these heavier soils, 

IV. Chemical Analyses 


Certain chemical analyses were conducted on the 
normal and drifted soils to determine the effects of wind 
erosion on the chemical composition of the soil as an Indication 
of its fertility. The total nitrogen and the organic matter 
content were determined by the methods as previously noted, on 
all of the normal, accumulated drift, and exposed subsurface

samples. In addition total and acid soluble phosphorus were 
ascertained, but on too 15mited a number of samples to warrant 
drawing any observations therefrom* These latter results 
therefore were not reoorded* 

However, Dr. Shutt (39) has pointed out that nitrogen 
and organic matter are the primary Indices of soil fertility* 
This point al3o was borne out quite significantly by the pot 
experiment as outlined in an earlier section of this paper* 

It would appear reasonable then, to make observations as to 
the soil fertility, on the results of the analyses of these 
two soil constituents* 

Results and Discussion * In Table DC Is recorded a 
complete list of the nitrogen and organic matter contents and 
the carbon: nitrogen ratios of all the normal, accumulated 
drift and exposed subsurface samples collected* The percentage 
variation also is Included in each case* The samples are 
grouped according to soil type for convenience in making com¬ 
parisons. The average composition of these soil samples also 
is computed according to the three broad classes as previously 
noted* These latter results are reported in Table X. 

In examining these two tables then, it is observed 
that in the accumulated drifts of the fine sands and fine sandy 
loams, the loss in nitrogen varies from 27.9 per cent, to 70*5 
per cent* giving a mean loss of 54*9 per cent* The decrease 
in organic matter is slightly higher, ranging from 32*5 per 
cent* to 77*2 per cent, with the average of 57*9 per cent*

In the exposed subsurfaces of these soils, the 
differences in nitrogen and organic matter, as compared to 
the normal soil, follow a similar trend to that of the accum¬ 
ulated drifts* The decreases, however, are not as great* In 
regard to nitrogen, the figures range from 8*6 per cent* to 
69.7 per cent*, or an average decrease of 34*6 per cent* 

Again in organic matter, the reduction is higher than for 
nitrogen, ranging from 30*1 per cent* to 67*4 per cent*, the 
average for the seven samples being 45.4 per cent* 

It is evident consequently, that the wind has very 
seriously impaired the fertility of these coarse-textured soils, 
removing one half the total nitrogen and organic matter from

the drift, accompanied by decreases of over one third of 
these two constituents in the exposed subsurface* This last 
point appears contradictory to the results of the pot exper¬ 
iment, in which case it was noted that the exposed subsurface 
samples yielded the least* However, by examining the individual 
samples used in that experiment, namely samples 11, 12 and 15, 
it is observed that these varied from the average, as in this 
case the exposed subsurface contained less nitrogen and organic 
matter than the accumulated drift. 

It also should be pointed out In regard to the 
carbon:nitrogen ratio (in the tables and subsequently, termed 
C:N ratio), considerable variation is noted* In the averages 
for the coarse-textured soils It Is 11*6:1 (the 11 1” being 
omitted in the tables and hereafter in the discussion), 11*1 
and 9*5 respectively for the normal, drift and exposed sub¬ 
surface samples* The lower C:N ratio In the subsurface agrees 
with observations of Salter (36), indicating that with the 
ageing of organic matter, as normally occurring in the subsoil, 
the ratio is narrowed* The C:N ratio In the drift samples. 
Intermediate to the other two then indicates apparently, a 
mixture of fresh organic matter from the top soil and that 
more decayed from the subsurface* This theory Is quite 
plausible, as in these coarse-textured soils, severe drifting 
had occurred* The C:N ratio, being narrower In the accumulated 
drift than in the normal soil, as noted in the last column of

Table X, also Indicates a greater loss of carbon (or of 
organic matter), than of nitrogen* This point was noted 
previously In these coarse-textured soils. 

In regard to the medium-textured soils, that Is the 
loams and slit loams, we note considerable variation In the 
results. Comparing the accumulated drift samples, the dif¬ 
ferences In the nitrogen contents range from an Increase of 
36.0 per cent, to a loss of 61 0 4 per cent, with the net result 
being -14.1 per cent* It Is Interesting to note that from five 
Increases In the fifteen samples, four occur in the "silt loam" 
rather than the lighter "loam" type. The figures for the 
variation of the organic matter are quite similar, ranging 
from a gain of 44.5 per cent, to a loss of 55.2 per cent, 
giving a mean loss of 11*8 per cent* 

Examining the data for the subsurfaces of these 
medium-textured soils we note that the nitrogen content varies 
from a loss of 55.3 per cent, to slight increases In two ex¬ 
ceptional cases. However, these increases in samples 193 
(silt loam) and 213 (loam) are within the range of sampling 
error. The average difference Indicates a loss of 17*3 per 
cent. The results for the variability of organic matter 
follow a similar trend, ranging from a loss of 57.2 per cent, 
to minor gains in three cases, giving a net average loss of 
17.5 per cent. 

Considering these results it appears that wind 


erosion has caused only minor damage to the medium-textured

soils, both in regard to their accumulations and tlieir exposed 
subsurfaces. From this fact, it may be deduced that drifting 
has been less severe, or that these soils have exceptionally 
deep "A" horizons in their soil profiles. The former theory 
is more tenable, as the resistance of medium-textured soils 
to wind erosion has been observed by different investigators 
(14,20,23,30,41,44,45). This point also is substantiated in 
the previous section on the description of the samples, that 
is, in the last column of Table I* It is here recorded that 
drifting had been severe only in one of the fifteen samples 
of loams and silt loams, with twelve moderately drifted, and 
two indicating only slight erosion. 

The mean C:N ratio, as recorded in the last column 
of Table X again appears to corroborate this previous statement. 
It i3 noted here that the C:N ratios of the normal surface and 
the exposed "subsurface" are equal. This Indicates that the 
composition of the organic matter is substantially the same in 
both cases, indicating apparently that the normal surface soil 
has not been removed by the wind to any great extent. 

In regard to C:N ratio for the accumulated drift, in 
this case it is higher than that of the normal surface, namely 
11.8 compared to 11.4. This fact would lead one to believe 
that the coarse and undecomposed organic matter have been 
accumulated in the drifts. This point has also been substant¬ 
iated by Daniel and Langham (13).

In observing the data for the f Ine~textured coils, 
that is the clays and clay loams, we note variable results. 

The averages, however, seem of considerable interest. In the 
accumulated drifts of these soils, the differences in nitrogen 
range from a gain of 16,2 per cent, to tho very significant 
loss of 48,6 per cent, in one case, giving a net loss of 3,0 
per cent. It might be noted here that this exceptional loss 
occurred on a clay sample (No, 182) which had drifted severely 
The results for organic matter quite closely follow those of 
nitrogen in these accumulated drift samples, ranging from an 
Increase of 11,8 per cent, to a loss of 53,1 per cent,, with 
mean of «*9.5 per cent. 

In regard to the exposed subsurfaces, the results 
are more consistent. That is we note losses in nitrogen in 
each individual case, ranging from 14,3 per cent, to 59,3 per 
cent, with a mean loss of 25,3 per cent. Similarly for organi 
matter, the losses range from 10,8 per cent, to 65.1 per cent, 
with the average loss of 28.7 per cent. 

In view of these results, particularly the averages 
In Table X, it may be observed that on the whole, the drift 
from the heavier soils approximates the composition of the 
surface soil from which It was derived. This would lead one 
to assume then that the clayey soils drift In the form of 
granules allowing little wind sortation to occur. 

Also It was noted that the subsurface samples were 
quite significantly damaged by wind erosion, more so than In

the case of the medium-textured soils. It appears then, that 
the clayey soils are affected by drifting, intermediately to 
the sands and the loams. The C:N ratio appears further to 
substantiate the conclusion* The average C:N ratio is signi¬ 
ficantly lower (10.7) in the exposed subsurface than in the 
normal surface (11.3)# It was noted that in the loams, the 
ratios were identical, namely 11.4 in both cases, whereas those 
in the coarse-textured soils varied to the greatest extent, 
being 11.6 and 9*5, indicating severe erosion. 

Comparison of Results with Data from Other Sources . 

In Table XI is presented the average chemical analyses of some 
normal and eroded soils as recorded by Daniel and Langham (13) 
in Oklahoma, by Ellis (16) in Manitoba and Moss (30) in 
Saskatchewan. These investigators compared only the normal 
surfaces and the accumulated drifts, determining the nitrogen 
and the organic matter. Moss had also determined the total 
phosphorus, which Indicated significant losses in the drift 
samples, but these data are not here recorded. Ellis only 
recorded the loss in organic matter, soil types not being 
listed. It should also be noted that since Moss had determined 
the organic matter as the loss on ignition, the CsN ratio, if 
determined would not have been on a comparable basis to that 
of the writer. This ratio is included for the Oklahoma samples 
where the organic matter was determined by the chromic acid 
reduction method as was also used by the writer (1).

In examining Tables X and XI for the variation In 
the nitrogen content of the coarse-textured soils, it is 
observed that in each case for both the total nitrogen and 
organic matter, greatest losses occurred in this soil class* 

The losses in nitrogen range from 39«4 per cent, to 54.9 per 
cent., with the writer’s results agreeing closely with those 
of Moss, namely 54.9 per cent, and 46.2 per cent, respectively. 
Similarly, large losses occurred in the organic matter in all 
cases. 

There is, however, a point of conflict in these 
results for the coarse-textured soils in regard to the C:N 
ratios. The ratios themselves cannot be compared in different 
climates as pointed out by Salter (36), but the trends should 
be similar. However, in the drift samples, the Oklahoma results 
Indicate a wider ratio than for the normal surface, while for 
the Alberta samples it is somewhat narrower in this case, 
being wider, however, in the medium-textured soils, Daniel 
and Langham (13) explain this widening of the C:N ratio by 
the fact that in the drifts frequently large amounts of un¬ 
decomposed vegetation were found to accumulate. 

It may therefore be concluded that wind erosion has 
caused very serious damage to the fertility of the coarse - 
textured soils, figures from three different sources indicating 
losses of l/3 to l/2 of the total nitrogen and the organic 
matter content of the normal cultivated soils*

Tn regard to the medium-textured soils, it is noted 
from Tables X and XI that both the Oklahoma and the Saskatchewan 
samples indicate only minor losses in nitrogen and organic 
matter, varying up to 9.5 per cent. In the Alberta samples 
the losses are slightly higher, being 14.1 per cent, for 
nitrogen and 11.8 per cent, for the organic matter content of 
these soils. In this class, the C:N ratios are slightly higher 
in the drifts in both tables, indicating the presence of coarse, 
undecomposed organic matter, with part of the finer humus 
removed by the wind. 

It would thus seem reasonable to conclude that wind 
erosion has caused only minor losses to the fertility of the 
accumulations from medium-textured soils 0 

Comparing the two tables again for the average nitrogen 
and organic matter contents of the fine-textured soils, it is 
observed that In the accumulated drifts, only slight, and 
probably insignificant differences have occurred in all three 
cases, the variation being from a gain of 6.0 per cent, to a 
loss of 9.5 per cent. It would therefore seem safe to say 
that the accumulated drift of fine-textured soils Is practically 
identical to the normal, cultivated surface soil. 

Summary . (1) In coarse-textured soils, the writer*s 
data Indicate that very serious damage has been caused by 
wind erosion, the accumulated drifts having lost over l/2 
the total nitrogen and organic matter, these constituents

also being reduced by over l/3 In the exposed subsurfaces. 

(2) In regard to medium-textured 3oils, wind damage 
has boon considerably less, average losses of 12 per cent, to 
18 per cent, of the total nitrogen and organic matter occurr¬ 
ing In both the drifts and the exposed subsurfaces. 

(3) In respect to the fine-textured soils, the wind 
damage is variable. The accumulations from these heavy soils 
are practically Identical to the normal surface soils. However, 
the exposed subsurfaces Indicate considerable damage with 
losses of l/4 of their nitrogen and their organic matter. 

(4) Data from Oklahoma and Saskatchewan corroborate 
the writer^ conclusion that the coarse-textured soils have 

suffered most severely from wind erosion.

(5) In regard to the medlum-and -textured 

soils, the other Investigators, having studied only the 
accumulated drifts in relation to the normal soli, found only 
slight reductions in fertility* 

V* Dust Analyses 


A study of the dust, which Is carried aloft by the 
winds to varying heights, and away to considerable distances 
during periods of wind erosion, has not received sufficient 
emphasis. In the past mention has been made of these dust 
clouds on various occasions. With the continued drought of

the past several years these "black blizzards" have assumed 
nation-wide importance. As an indication of the extent of 
these dust clouds, it was reported (2) in the spring of 1933, 
that soil material of a reddish character, apparently from the 
"dust bowl" states, was deposited by the wind on the dark 
soils of Iowa in sufficient quantity to give them a reddish 
tinge. However, in 1934, Lowdermilk (27) notes that for the 
first time in history, dust clouds from Kansas, Colorado, 
Oklahoma, and Texas rolled across the continent and into the 
Atlantic Ocean. This "du3t fog" is reported to have extended 
1,000 miles north and south by 1,500 miles east and west. 

The character of these dust blankets was studied at 
Washington, D.C. by Hand (22), and at Baton Rouge, Lousiana 
by Russell and Russell (35). The latter state that aviators 
were forced to ascend to 6,000 feet to overcome poor visibility. 
The Russells collected some of this dust and subjected it 
petrographic examination. The sizes of particles ranged up 
to 0.15 ram. (fine sand), but over 50 per cent, were reported 
as below 0.005 mm. (former limit for clay). The examination 
revealed that the samples contained quartz, feldspar, calcite, 
hematite, llmonlte, muscovite (mica), volcanic ash, and 
considerable organic matter. However, no actual chemical

serological observations, was 6,500 feet, and the dust was 
heavy enough to reduce solar radiation by 75 per cent. The 
weight above one square mile was calculated to be 101 tons* 

In size, the particles ranged from 0.13 mm. (fine sand) to 
0.001 mm. (colloid), no percentages being reported. According 
to examination, the du3t contained the minerals as noted above, 
and "considerable organic matter". 

Similar dust storms or "black blizzards" have 
occurred in Alberta, especially in the past few years (see 
Plate III). These occur especially in the spring, but over 
a term of years, may be observed in any season. A recent 
report (15) Indicates that a large dust cloud was observed 
in mid-winter extending up 9,000 feet above the city of 
Lethbridge• 

However, no actual analyses of these dust depositions 
were conducted, as far as could be ascertained until 1935, 
when Fly (18) issued a report on the chemical and mechanical 
analyses of dust deposited by wind In Oklahoma. No references 
could be found covering such tests conducted in Canada. 

Material and Methods . In Tables XII and XIII are 
listed respectively, the chemical and mechanical analyses of 
dust samples from Alberta, as determined by the writer, and 
Oklahoma as reported by Fly (18), compared to their normal 


surface soils

It might be noted here that sample a 134 to 137, as 
recorded In the tables, were collected at various heights in 
an inhabited residence. This was located in a silt loam area, 
with a large area of fine sandy loam commencing two miles 
southwest. Bordering this was a still larger area of loam 
soil. 

Samples 274 and 275 were collected at two different 
heights from an abandoned house situated in a fine sand area, 
with a fine sandy loam area again two miles southwest of It 
and extending several miles in width. West of this again was 
a large loam area. 

The mechanical and chemical analyses were conducted 
on these samples similarly to the soil samples. The only 
variation used was that for the chemical analyses, no pulver¬ 
izing was required. An 80 mesh screen was used on all samples 
to remove any extraneous material. 

Chemical Analyses , From Table XII on the analyses 
of dust from points in Alberta and Oklahoma, it appears quite 
evident that the dust carried by the wind, even at relatively 
small heights. Is very rich In plant nutrients. The analyses 
of the silt loam samples, namely 131 to 137, indicate that 
although the accumulated drift and the exposed subsurface were 
nearly the same as the normal surface soil, yet the dust 
deposits, collected at 5 feet, 15 feet and 25 feet above the 
ground level, are from 61 per cent, to 115 per cent, higher in

nitrogen than the normal cultivated surface. The average of 
the four dust samples indicates an increase of 85*8 per cent# 
in nitrogen* The figures for organic matter are slightly 
lower, indicating that the wind has carried away the richer, 
more decomposed organic matter# They range from 49.0 per cent, 
to 78#5 per cent, with the average increase of 69#2 per cent* 
in organic matter. 

In the section of Table XII on the fine sand samples, 
a similar trend is noted# Here, however, the accumulated drift 
also exhibits a large decrease in nitrogen and organic matter# 
The dust deposits at 5 feet and 15 feet were almost identical 
indicating average gains of 105*0 per cent, in nitrogen and 
75.9 per cent, in organic matter* The averages for the six 
dust 3ample3 show an increase of 95#4 per cent, in nitrogen 
and 72*6 per cent, in organic matter. 

In the third section of Table XII is listed the 
average analyses of normal silt loam and dust samples as re~ 
corded by Fly (18). It will be observed that the average of 
fifteen dust samples indicates an Increase of 115.0 per cent# 
in nitrogen and 76.8 per cent, in organic matter as compared 
to the normal soil. It will be seen then that the writer*s 
results are almost Identical to those obtained by Fly. 

Another Interesting feature observed from this table 
Is that in every case, there is a greater increase or gain in 
the nitrogen content of the dust samples than in the organic 
matter# In other words, the wind apparently sifts out and

carriea away the finer particles of organic matter which have 
a higher nitrogen content* 

Prom these results it aeems reasonable to conclude 
that the wind may very seriously impair the fertility of the 
soil by sifting out the more fertile portion (twice the normal), 
and carrying it away for hundreds of miles, an irreparable loos 
to the farmer and the nation as a whole* 

Mechanic a l Analy ses* In Table XIII is recorded the 
mechanical analyses of dust samples from Alberta and Oklahoma 
compared to soils "in situ". It should be noted here that the 
mechanical analyses of dust samples 134 and 135 was omitted 
only from Insufficiency of samples for this purpose* 

In examining the table, it is observed that in the 
silt loam samples and the fine sand samples, the average 
composition of the dust is very similar, the sand content 
being 29.8 per cent, and 25.7 per cent, respectively, the silt 
58.5 per cent., and 63.9 per cent., and the clay 11*8 per cent, 
and 10.5 per cent. The soils "in situ" naturally vary 
tremendously as the one is a silt loam and the other a fine 
sand. This would lead one to believe that very similar wind 
sortatlon occurs on any type of soil* 

In comparing the dust samples to the soils "in situ", 
it is seen that in the dust sample of the silt loam, there was 
a decrease in sand varying from 37.5 per cent, to 48.1 per 
cent, with an average of 42.7 per cent. The increases in silt

varied from 63.8 per cent, to 64*8 per cent. averaging 64.3 
per cent. In the clay content there was a loa3 In one case 
and an Increase In the other, with a net loss of 4.8 per cent* 

Considering the fine sands. It is observed that in 
the dust samples, an average loss in the sand content of 70*7 
per cent, occurred. Though the actual silt content in this 
case is approximately the same as in the previous dust samples, 
the percentage Increase Is considerably higher, namely 252.0 
per cent., on account of the low silt content of the normal 
fine sand. In regard to the clay, an Increase of 35.2 per 
cent, occurred. 

In examining the third section of Table XIII, it will 
be observed that in the dust from a silt loam area. Fly noted 
a loss of 60.7 per cent, in sand, a gain of 43.8 per cent, in 
silt, and a 7.0 per cent, increase in the clay fraction. In 
observing the averages obtained by the writer for the silt 
loam dust samples, it is noted that in both the actual content 
of the soil separates, and In the variation, the agreement is 
fairly close. 

It therefore appears that the mechanical composition 
of dust is quite Independent of the soils "in situ", being 
approximately 2/3 silt with minor amounts of sand and clay. 

The per cent, variation depends therefore on the normal soil 
to which It is compared. 


Conclusions 


In concluding this section on the 







-00 


chemical and mechanical analyses of duat several important 
observations may be drawn. 

(1) The varying degrees of loss in the fertility 
of wind eroded soils, as noted in an earlier section, are 
counterbalanced by the large increase in the chemical compos¬ 
ition of dust as compared to the normal surface soils. 

(2) The decrease in the silt content of wind 
accumulations, as also noted previously, is equalized by the 
high percentage of silt in dust samples* 

(3) It also appears that the mechanical composition, 
though not the chemical analyses, of dust is quite constant, 
being independent to the soils "in situ". 

(4) The very serious damage of wind erosion to the 
chemical and physical constitution of the soil, as further 
substantiated by the analyses of dust, makes it doubly import¬ 
ant to control soil drifting* 

GENERAL SUMMARY 


A study has been made of winds and the effects of 
wind erosion cn the composition and fertility of some Alberta 
soils. To observe these effects, a pot experiment was conducted, 
certain chemical analyses were carried out, and the mechanical 
analyses were completed on eighty one samples, collected from 
twenty seven locations in the province. A preliminary study

The survey of meteorological observations Indicated 
that the wind in southern Alberta Is double that In the central 
part of the province, and also Is considerably higher than at 
two points In the "dust bowl” of the United States, It was 
further noted that In southern Alberta, l/2 to 4/5 of the 
prevailing winds are from the we3t. The data also Indicated 
that Lethbridge has twice the number of gales as Calgary or 
Medicine Hat, 

In regard to the pot experiment, very material damage 
to soil fertility, as indicated by plant development, was noted 
on the fine sand. Only minor differences were observed on the 
silt loam and clay samples. No significant differences, however, 
were noted on the normal and eroded loam soli samples used* 

The mechanical analyses indicated that with the 
coarse-textured soils, the greatest losses in silt and clay 
had occurred In the accumulated drifts, and there were also 
material decreases of silt In the exposed subsurfaces. In 
the medium-textured soils, significant losses In silt and clay 
were noted In the accumulations, but the exposed subsurfaces 
were substantially the same as the normal surfaces. Little 
difference was found In the fine-textured soils. Both the 
accumulated drifts and the exposed subsurfaces were similar 
to the normal soil, with a slight reduction in sand and an

increase in clay In each case* 

The chemical analyses conducted on the samples 
indicated that with coarse-textured soils, very serious 
damage was caused by wind erosion* The fine-textured soils 
had suffered less severely, and the medium-textured sol If 
indicated only a moderate loss of fertility* 

The analyses of the dust samples indicated a very 
material increase In nitrogen and in organic matter, and 
also in the silt fraction, as compared to the normal surface 
soil.
