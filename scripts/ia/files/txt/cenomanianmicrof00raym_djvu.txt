PREFACE AND ACKNOIISLEDGEIMTS 


Correlation and dating of the complex sequence of Cretaceous 
strata in the Western Canadian Plains has been restricted by 
incomplete palaeontological and lithological evidence* The major 
problem involving the Cretaceous sequence has been the determination 
of time-stratigraphic equivalents from marine to non-marine facies. 

Until recently, the Fort St. John group was considered to be 
entirely Lower Cretaceous in age. Recently, the uppermost Fort St. 
John beds have been assigned a Cenomanian age. Much work remains to 
be done before the precise stratigraphic relationships of the Fort 
St. John group are fully known. 

Some recent work has been done on the Cretaceous microfauna of 
the Western Canadian Plains. Published reports by R. T. D. Wiekenden, 
J. A. Cushman, and A. W. Nauss, and unpublished papers by C. R. Stelck, 
J. H. Wall, D. B. Bullock, A. R. Nielsen, W. G. Bahan, A. W. Norris, 
and F. H. Trollope provide groundwork for the identification of 
Cretaceous microfaunas of the foothills and plains. 

In order to supplement this work, the author has undertaken a 
study of a microfauna from the upper part of the Fort St. John group 
from the type area near Fort St. John, British Columbia. 

The writer wishes to express his sincere appreciation to all 
members of the Department of Geology, University of Alberta, for their 
assistance and encouragement during the writer's graduate and under¬ 


graduate years

ABSTRACT 


Twenty-two species of Foraminifera from the upper part of the 
Fort St. John group in the type area near Fort St. John, British 
Columbia, are described and illustrated. All of the species described 
are arenaceous forms, and include: 3 species each of Amciobaculites , 
and Nodosinella ; 4 of Miliammina ; 2 each of Haplophragmoides , Reophax , 
and Trochammina ; and 1 each of Gaudryina , Proteonina , Kyperarnmina , 
Lituotuba, Verneuilina , and Textularia. 

The microfauna is Lower Cenomanian (basal Upper Cretaceous) 
in age, determined by the associated ammonites Acanthoceras , Pulchellia (?) 
sp., and Beudanticeras (?). 

Three microfaunal assemblages are established: a lower 
Eaplophragmoides fauna from within a fish scale sand zone immediately 
overlying the Lower-Upper Cretaceous boundary; a Trochammina fauna well 
expressed 370 feet above the base of the fish scale sand zone; and an 
upper Lituotuba fauna 530 feet above the base of the fish scale sand 
zone. 

The Haplophragmoides and Trochammina faunas are correlated with 
the base of the upper Sikanni shales of the Sikanni Chief River area, 
British Columbia, and the Eaplophragmoides fauna is correlated with 
the uppermost part of the Miliammina-Tritaxia zone of the Shaftesbury 
formation of the Eastern Peace River area, Alberta.

CHAPTER I 


STRATIGRAPHIC RELATIONS OF THE FORT ST. JOHN MICROFAUNA 

INTRODUCTION 

This thesis deals with a microfauna collected from the type 
area of the Cretaceous Fort St. John group near the site of old 
Fort St. John, British Columbia, from which the group name was 
derived. The microfaunal assemblages discussed in this thesis 
were collected from a Cenomanian or lowermost Upper Cretaceous 
portion of the Fort St. John shales of the type area. 

The term "Fort St. John” as applied to this sequence of 
strata has had a various history, and it is necessary to trace 
the development of knowledge concerning the Fort St. John group 
from the early reconnaissance survey carried out by Selwyn in 
1875 to the present day. 

Part I. THE FORT ST. JOHN GROUP 


EARLY WORK 

The original formal naming of the Fort St. John group and 
subsequent changes are here briefly outlined. 

The first geologist to visit the Peace River area was 
A. R. G. Selwyn of the Geological Survey of Canada ( 37 , pp. 274-296 ) 
who, in 1875, did reconnaissance geology along the Peace River from

Quesnel Mouth to Smoky River. Selwyn provided the first account of 
the Fort St. John group, of which he said: "From the ’Fork’- Smoky 
River-^up to Dunvegan, and thence to about five miles below Hudson’s 
Hope, the rocks which are exposed along Peace River...consist of dark 
earthy shales, in parts characterized by numerous bands and septarian 
nodules of clay ironstone, many of which enclose large ammonites, and 
they are also associated with sandy calcareous layers holding Cretaceous 
fossils, among which, a species of inoceramus (Posidonia auct.) is 
tolerably abundant, while in the dark argillaceous shales the scales 
of fishes are frequently observed.” 

In 1879, C. M. Dawson (12, pp. 99b-126b) carried out a detailed 
investigation of the Peace River country, including the areas around 
Pine River, Smoky River, and Peace River at Fort St. John. Dawson 
subdivided the Cretaceous rocks embracing these areas in the following 
manner: 

1. Upper sandstones and shales with lignite 
coals (Wapiti River Sandstones). 

2. Upper dark shales (Smoky River Shales). 

3. Lower sandstones and shales with lignite 
and true coals (Dunvegan Sandstone). 

4. Lower dark shales (Fort St. John Shales). 

Thus Dawson first named the Fort St. John formation, defining 
it as the lower dark marine shales underlying the Dunvegan sandstones. 

In 1888, R. G. McConnell (25, pp. 27d-54d) examined outcrops along 
the Peace River from the mouth of Red River to the Smoky River Forks, 
but added little to our knowledge of the Fort St. John shale.

F. H. McLearn carried out important work in the Peace River 
country during the field seasons of 1917, 1918, 1920, and 1922 
(26,27,28,29)* In 1918, as a result of investigations along Peace, 
Snaky, and Athabaska Rivers, McLearn published the following table 
of formations (27, p. 2c):

Thus McLearn shortened the name "Fort St. John” formation to 
"St. John” formation. The latter name, however, had previously been 
assigned to a Middle Cambrian formation in New Brunswick. McLearn 
limited the St. John formation to strata overlying the Peace River 
formation and underlying the Dunvegan formation. The following is the 
description given for the St. John formation in the Smoky and Peace

River areas: n It consists principally of dark, friable, and paper- 
thin carbonaceous shale, with some ironstone bands and concretions; 
where the bedding shows it is on a scale of about 2 inches and 
indicates marine conditions. The top of this formation consists 
of thin-bedded sandstone and shale which, in places, by increase in 
thickness of the sandstone layers upwards, shows a gradation into the 
massive sandstone at the base of the Dunvegan." 

In 1917, McLeam (26, pp. 14-21) found a section in the Hudson 
Hope area which consisted of two thick marine shale sections separated 
by a sandstone member. Later, in 1922, McLearn (29, pp. 1-46) called 
the lower shale the "Moosebar" formation, the middle sandstone the 
"Crates 11 formation, and the upper shale was referred to as the r St. John" 
shale. 

From 1919 until 1922, work was done in the Peace River area by 
S. M. Spieker (38,39), J. A. Dresser (14,15), J. C. Gwillim (18), 

M. Y. Williams (46), J. S. Stewart (40), and J. A. Allan (l). However, 
these geologists introduced no new stratigraphic terms. 

In the summer of 1929, R. L. Rutherford (36) carried out a water 
resources survey in the Peace River and Grande Prairie districts. 
Rutherford examined the St. John formation at Shaftesbury Settlement 
opposite the mouth of the Smoky, on Smoky River, and the area around 
Montagneuse River. Rutherford described the St. John formation as 
consisting mostly of dark to grey, thin-bedded marine shales containing 
layers of ironstone nodules and concretions. The following sequence of

strata was given for the Eastern Peace River area: 

Wapiti formation 
Smoky River formation 
(Upper shale 
(Bad Heart Sandstone 
(Lower shale (Kaskapau) 

Dunvegan formation 

St, John formation 

Peace River formation 

Loon River formation (at depth) 

In 1931, L. S. Russell carried out a survey of the Eastern Peace 

River area, and a preliminary map of this area was published by the 

Geological Survey of Canada (35), Russell made a significant change 

in terminology by re-introducing the term ”Eort St. John formation” 

for the marine shales underlying the Dunvegan formation and overlying 

the Peace River formation. The following table of formations was 

included on Russell’s map: 

Upper Cretaceous 

"Wapiti formation 
Dark marine shale ) 

Bad Heart formation) Smoky group 
Kaskapau formation ) 

Dunvegan formation 

Lower Cretaceous 

Port St, John formation 
Peace River formation 
Loon River formation 



In 1943, Wickenden and Shaw (45) of the Geological Survey of 
Canada published a paper on the stratigraphy and structure in the 
Mount Hulcross-Cournotion Creek area of British Columbia, in which 
they raised the Fort St. John from formational to group rank to 
include the following formations: 

Fort St. John group 
Cruiser formation 
Goodrich formation 
Easier formation 
Commotion formation 
Moosebar formation 

In 1944, McLearn and Henderson (31) of the Geological Survey 
of Canada carried out a detailed survey of the Lone Mountain area, 
British Columbia, with the result that the name w Shaftesbury n was 
proposed n for the formation lying between the Peace River and Dunvegan 
formations in the Eastern part of the Peace River Yalley between 
Dunvegan and the town of Peace River n . The Shaftesbury formation in 
this area was correlated with the Fort St. John formation of the 
Sexsmith-Bison Lake area (35) and the Hasler, Goodrich, and Cruiser 
formations of the Mount Hulcross-Commotion Creek area (45). 

Beach and Spivak (3), in 1944, included the Moosebar, Gates, 
Hasler, Goodrich, and Cruiser formations in the Fort St. John group 
within the Dunlevy-Portage Mountain area, British Columbia. 

In 1944, McLearn (32) made a revision of the Lower Cretaceous 
of the Western Interior of Canada based on lithologic, floral, and 
faunal evidence. The report included correlation tables showing the

stratigraphic age relationships of the Fort St. John group in the 
foothills and plains of Western Canada. McLeam assigned an Albian 
age to the Fort St. John group, with a reservation that the upper part 
could be of very early Upper Cretaceous age. 

Stelck (6a, pp. 1-55) recently used microfauna in establishing 
the Cenomanian-Albian boundary in Western Canada. In his report, 
Stelck places the lower boundary of the Fort St. John group within 
the lower part of the Lower Albian sub-stage, and the upper boundary 
of the Fort St. John group in the lower part of the Middle Cenomanian 
sub-stage. A correlation table for the Fort St, John group in the 
Peace River area is outlined on Fig. 1, p. 7a. 

LITHOLOGY, THICKNFSS, AKD DISTRIBUTION 

The Fort St. John group consists of a series of sandstone and 
shale beds, predominantly of marine origin. In the Peace River area 
of British Columbia, the Fort St. John group overlies the Bullhead 
group which consists largely of non-marine sandstones, shales, and 
coal beds. The Fort St. John group is conformably overlain by, and 
grades into, the predominantly non-marine, deltaic, coaly sandstones 

and shales of the Dunvegan formation. 

In the Fort St. John type area, the Fort St. John group consists 
of about 2600 feet of dark, predominantly marine shales broken by 
argillaceous sandy members and overlain by the Dunvegan formation. 

Farther east, in the Alberta portion of the Peace River Valley, 
McLeam (27) and Rutherford (36) assign a total thickness of 1530 
feet to the combined Loon River, Peace River, and Shaftesbury

formations of the Fort St. John group. Still farther east, on 
Athabaska River, the Fort St. John group consists of the Clearwater, 
Grand Rapids, Joli Fou, Pelican and basal La Biche formations, for 
which McLeam (26) estimates a thickness of 645 feet for the bottom 
four formations, while Bahan (la) includes 95 feet of shales for the 
basal La Biche formation, giving a total of 740 feet for that area. 

Along Pine River, British Columbia, Wickenden and Shaw (45) give 
the Moosebar, Commotion, Easier, Goodrich, and Cruiser formations a 
total thickness of 4800 feet, while in the western Peace River Valley, 
McLeam (29), Beach, and Spivak (3) give the Moosebar, Gates, Easier, 
Goodrich, and Cruiser formations an aggregate thickness of about 3500 
feet. 

Irish (21,22) found only 400 feet of Fort St. John shales in the 
Moon Creek and A La Peche map areas, in the northern foothills of 
Alberta. 

Toward the North, along Buckinghorse and Sikanni Chief Rivers, 
British Columbia, Hage (19) has assigned a total thickness of 
approximately 4400 feet to the Buckinghorse and Sikanni formations 
of the Fort St. John group. 

On the Alaska Highway, west of Fort Nelson, Williams (47) has 
noted about 1350 feet of shales and sandstones equivalent to the Fort 
St. John group. 

Kindle (23) found the Fort St. John group on the Liard River to 
consist of the Garbutt, Scatter, and Lepine formations with a thickness 
of approximately 4500 feet.

The type section of the Fort St. John group at Fort St. John, 
British Columbia, is represented in outcrop only by strata equivalent 
to the upper part of the Shaftesbury formation. The Shaftesbury 
formation and its equivalents show approximately the same pattern of 
distribution as the Fort St. John group itself. Thus the Shaftesbury 
and its equivalents have an approximate thickness of 600 feet in the 
eastern Peace River area, 1200 feet in the Pouce Coupe area, 2000 feet 
in the Hudson Hope area, 2150-2700 feet in the Commotion Creek area, 

2200 feet in the Wapiti River area, and 400 feet in the A La Peche 
and Moon Creek areas. 

A cursory inspection of the Fort St. John group reveals a 
considerable thickening of the group toward the northwest, west, and 
southwest, with thinning and pinching out toward the east and southeast. 
Fort St. John sediments appear to have been deposited in a boreal sea, 
the exact extent of which is still indefinite. The recent intensive oil 
well drilling program in Western Canada, and particularly in the Peace 
River area, will undoubtedly add much to our present knowledge of the 
Fort St. John Croup. 

PALAS0HT0LQCIQAL Z0HMTI0N OF THE FORT ST. JOHN GROUP 

Correlation of the Fort St. John group is based primarily on 
the occurrence of beds carrying Lemuroceras , Castroplites , 
Eaplophragmoides gigas , and Neogastroplites faunas. The stratigraphic 
position of these faunas in the Peace River area is shown in Fig. 1, 
p. 7a. These Fort St. John faunas have been discussed by McLearn (32)

and Stelck (6a, pp. 5-15), and are here briefly outlined. 

The Lemuroceras fauna provides an important means of correlating 
strata within the Fort St. John group, and has been collected in the 
lower part of the Buckinghorse formation in the Sikanni Chief River 
area, British Columbia; in the uppermost Moosebar and lowermost Gates 
formations in the Peace River foothills, British Columbia; in the upper 
Loon River and Monias member of the eastern Peace River area, Alberta; 
and the upper part of the Clearwater formation on Lower Athabaska 
River, Alberta. Lemuroceras has been recorded from India and 
Madagascar, and in the latter locality is associated with ammonites 
of Albian age. In Western Canada, the Lemuroceras fauna marks the 
Lower Albian-Middle Albian boundary (6a, p. 15). 

The Gastroplites fauna permits accurate correlation within the 
Fort St. John group. Gastroplites cantianus Spath has been found in 
the uppermost subzone of the Middle Albian of the English Gault, and 
in the ”Upper St. John shales” near the Gates, British Columbia 
(6a, p. 14). Thus the Gastroplites fauna represents the top of the 
Middle Albian within the Fort St. John group. 

Haplophragmoides gigas has been found within the base of the 
Colorado shale in southern Saskatchewan; within the lower part of the 
Colorado (Lloydminster) shale in the Yermilion-Lloydminster area, 
Alberta; below the Yiking sand and above the Mamville formation in the 
Leduc, Yiking, Redwater, and Wabamun areas, Alberta; and within the 


Harmon member of the Peace River formation in the eastern Peace River

area, Alberta (Stelck, pers. com,). The Kaplophragmoides gigas fauna 


is regarded as lowermost upper Albian in age (6a, p. 47). 

Correlations within the upper part of the Fort St. John group are 
based primarily on the presence of a Neogastroplites fauna in the upper 
Fort St. John formation in the Fort St. John area, British Columbia. 

In 1875, Selwyn (37) first collected a Neogastroplites fauna 
from the north bank of the Peace River between Cache Creek and Fort 
St. John trading post, British Columbia. Selwyn collected several 
ammonites and pelecypods and noted the presence of numerous fish scales 
The ammonites were described by Miteaves (42) as Buchiceras cornutus , 
which species was later used by McLearn (30) as the genotype of 
Neogastroplites . 

The Neogastroplites fauna collected by Selwyn included 
Neogastroplites cornutus (Miteaves), Neogastroplites selwyni 
(Whiteaves), Nucula dowlingi (McLearn), and Posidonia nahwisi (McLearn) 
Neogastroplites has since been collected from several sections in the 
Peace River area. Neogastroplites cf. cornutus has been found in the 
3rd. sandstone member of the Sikanni formation. Stelck has collected 
Neogastroplites sp. and Posidonia nahwisi from Shaftesbury shales in 
the Wapiti River area, Alberta and British Columbia, and in the Kakwa- 
XJpper Copton area, Alberta. Neogastroplites occurs in the Goodrich 
formation of the Pine River area, British Columbia, and the topotype 
region in the Fort St. John area, where it occurs immediately below 
a Holcolepis fish scale fauna. Neogastroplites has not to date (1951) 


been found in the Shaftesbury type area of eastern Peace River, Alberta

but its position is placed at the base of a Holcolepis fish scale 
horizon in that area. 

Definite dating of the Heogastroplites fauna is difficult, 
because Neogastroplites has not been found outside northwestern Canada 
However, in the Pine River area, British Columbia, a species of 
Pleurohoplites occurs at the top of the Heogastroplites zone in the 
Goodrich formation. Inasmuch as Pleurohoplites is the European zone 
fossil for the uppermost Albian, the upper Cretaceous-lower Cretaceous 
boundary has been placed at the top of the Heogastroplites zone 
(6a, pp. 14,53). On the strength of the above evidence, the upper 
Cretaceous-lower Cretaceous boundary within the Port St. John group 
has been placed at the top of the Sikanni sandstones in the Sikanni 
Chief River area, British Columbia; at the top of the Goodrich 
formation in the Upper Pine River area, British Columbia; immediately 
below the fish scale sands in the Port St. John area, British Columbia 
and within the fish scale sands of the Shaftesbury formation in the 
eastern Peace River area, Alberta. 

Several species of Acanthoceras have been found in the Lower 
La Biche shale on Athabaska River, Alberta, and in shales immediately 
above the Heogastroplites zone in the Fort St. John area, British 
Columbia (Stelck, pers. com.). Acanthoceras is a Cenomanian zone 
fossil of the European chronology, thus dating the beds above the 
Heogastroplites zone of the Port St. John group as Upper Cretaceous.

PART II. LOCAL LITHOLOGY OF THE F03T ST. JOHN GHOUP 


The shale samples from which the writer's microfaunal suites 
were extracted were obtained from the type area of the Fort St. 

John group in the Fort St. John area, British Columbia. The Fort 
St. John group in this area is represented by a series of predominantly 
marine shales. The Upper Fort St. John shales are conformably overlain 
by, and grade into, the deltaic Dunvegan formation. 

The following lithologic succession from the Fort St. John area 
will serve as an outline for the calibration of local descriptions 


found in the appendix of this report.

The cone-in-cone, First Tuff (Plate I, Fig. 2), double 
flexible shale (Plate I, Fig. 2), Second Tuff (Plate II, Fig. l), 
and fish scale sands (Plate II, Fig. 2) are distinctive horizon 
markers, and with the Heogastroplites zone form the bases for 
mapping the Fort St. John formation in the type area. These marker 
horizons will be frequently referred to in this thesis. 

A detailed description of some sections of the Fort St. John 
group in the Fort St. John area is included in Part II of the appendix 
of this report, covering the interval between the Dunvegan formation 
and the Neogastroplites zone. 

The following map shows the distribution of the Fort St. John 
group in the type area, British Columbia. 

QCCPPHEflCE OF MIORQFAUHAS 

Lower Cenomanian species of Acanthoceras , Pulchellia (?) sp., 
and Beudanticeras (?) occur above the uppermost Albian Heogastroplites 
fauna up to a horizon about 50 feet above the First Tuff horizon of 
the Fort St. John shales in the Fort St. John area, British Columbia 
(Stelck, pers. com.). The microfauna discussed in this thesis was 
collected from beds of these ammonoid zones, thus dating the micro¬ 


fauna as Lower Cenomanian in age

CHAPTER II 

CENOMANIAN MICROFAUNA OF THE FORT ST. JOHN GROUP 


Three main Foraminiferal assemblages are established: a lower 
Kaplophragmoides 4904-A fauna within the fish scale sand zone; a middle 
Trochammina 4615-A fauna within the Double Flexible shale beds 370 
feet above the base of the fish scale sand zone; and an upper 
Lituotuba 4500-C fauna within the silty shales 530 feet above the 
base of the fish scale sand zone. In addition, a depauperate fauna 
occurs within a Pulchellia (?) sp. zone between the Haplophragmoides 
4904-A and Trochammina 4615-A faunas. 


HAPLOPHRAGMOIDES 4904-A FAUNA 


The Haplophragmoides 4904-A fauna from within the fish scale 
sand zone immediately belov/ the Acanthoceras- bearing beds includes 
the following species, some of which are illustrated on Plate III of 
this thesis: 

Ammobaculites 4901-B 
Amraobaculites 4901-0 
Ammobaculites 4902-A^ 

Ammobaculites 4902-B ^(undescribed) 

Ammobaculites 4901-E (undescribed) 

Haplophragmoides 4904-A 

Reophax 49Q1-E 

Reophax 4901-D 

Textularia 4902-0 

Verneuilina 4901-E 

Hyperammina 4900-D (undescribed) 

Tritaxia 4900-K (Ref, 6a, p. 163) 

Protsonina 4901-F 
Miliaxamina (?) (undescribed) 

Most of the Foraminifera listed above are moderately coarse¬ 


grained arenaceous forms closely related to a fauna described by

Stelck from the base of the upper Sikanni shales on Sikanni Chief 
River, British Columbia. 

The lowermost part of the Haplophragmoides 4904-A fauna at the 
base of the fish scale sand zone is degenerate, consisting of a few 
specimens of Hyperammina , Tritaxia , Textularia , and Miliammina (?). 

This basal assemblage grades rapidly into the Haplophragmoides 4904-A 
fauna proper, which is a prolific assemblage dominated by three species 
of Ammobaculites , two species of Iteophax , and Haplophragmoides 4904-A 
itself. The latter species makes its initial appearance somewhat 
later than Ammobaculites and Reophax , and is the dominating form 
within the upper half of the Haplophragmoides fauna. 

Most of the Haplophragmoides fauna is restricted to the fish 
scale sands, with only a few forms closely resembling Proteonina 
4901-F and Haplophragmoides 4901-L continuing on up to the Trochammina 
4615-A fauna. 

HICRQFABKA OP THE PHLCKELLIA (?) sp. ZONE 

The Pulchellia (?) sp.-bearing beds between the Haplophragmoides 
4904-A and Trochammina 4615-A faunas contain a depauperate fauna 
dominated by Proteonina and Haplophragmoides , with rare specimens of 
Tritaxia and Hyperammina . Rare calcareous Foraminifera, identified 
as species of G-umbelitria and Marginulina , are sporadically distributed 
throughout this interval. A notable feature of this interval is the 
restricted appearance of the Hadiolarian genus Theocyrtis (?) immediately 


above the Second Tuff horizon. 

Fish scales are present in varying quantities throughout most of

the interval between the base of the fish scale sand and the 
Trochammina fauna, but are most abundant within the interval 0-90 
feet above the base of the fish scale sand zone, and within and near 
the Double Flexible shale beds. Washed samples from the Double 
Flexible shales are commonly composed of nearly ninety percent of 
comminuted fish scales. 

Plant fructifications (4a) commonly referred to as "spores” 
were encountered in varying quantities in most of the suites examined, 
particularly between the Haplophragmoides 4904-A and Trochammina 4615-A 
faunas. "Spores” are rare or absent within the Haplophragmoides 4904-A> 
Trochammina 4615-A, and Lituotuba 4500-C faunas. Within one sample 
fifty-eight feet above the base of the fish scale sand zone, "spores” 
are very abundant, and constitute a "spore” horizon. 

THOGBAMmiA 4615-A FAUNA 

The Trochammina 4615-A fauna is a distinctive fauna best expressed 

within the Double Flexible shale beds 370 feet above the base of the 

fish scale sand zone. This fauna is partially illustrated on Plate III 

of this thesis, and includes the following species: 

Trochammina 4615-A 
Miliammina 4614-A 
Miliammina 4614-B 
Lituotuba (?) (undescribed) 

Most of the fauna listed above is closely related to a fauna 
described by Stelck from the base of the upper Sikanni shales on 
Sikanni Chief Biver, British Columbia. 

Of the above species, Trochammina and Miliammina appear for the 
first time near the base of the Double Flexible shale beds, and show a 


















- 18 - 


fairly sharp maximum development in numbers near the central portion 
of the Double Flexible shale beds. 

The Trochammina 4615-A fauna is very poorly preserved above the 
Double Flexible shale up to the First Tuff, often rendering positive 
identification impossible. Most of the specimens present suggest 
Lituotuba, with a few Miliammina and ferruginous casts of Trochanunina. 

A fauna recovered from cores of the Kiskatinaw Test Hole of 
locality E may be included with the Trochammina 4615-A fauna of the 
Double Flexible shale beds. 

This fauna, illustrated on Plate III of this thesis, includes 
the following species: 

Trochammina 4201-A 
Gauaryina 4201-B 
Nodosinella 4201-C 

The most characteristic species of this suite is Trochammina 
4201-A, which is almost identical to Trochammina 4615-A of the Double 
Flexible shale beds. 

LITUOTUBA 4500-0 FAUNA 


The silty shales within the interval 117-190 feet above the 
First Tuff horizon and 530 feet above the base of the fish scale sand 
zone contain a poorly preserved Lituotuba 4500-C fauna. 

The Lituotuba fauna includes the following species, a number of 

which are illustrated on Plate III of this thesis: 

Lituotuba 4500-G 
Haplophragraoides 4501-A 
Hyperammina 4500-A 
Miliammina 4506-A 
Miliammina 4505-A 
Nodosinella 4502-A 
Uodosinella 4501-B 
Yemeuilina 4500-B (undescribed)

The fauna designated as the Lituotuba 4500-G fauna is a 
distinctive new fauna dominated by Lituotuba , with genera other than 
Lituotuba and ihiliammina poorly developed throughout. Lituotuba is 
fairly abundant throughout most of the suites, but in the uppermost 
part of this section shows an apparent decline which is taken up by 
Miliammina * 

Hyperamraina , Nodosinella , and Yemeuilina are poorly developed in 
numbers, and are restricted to the lowermost part of the Lituotuba fauna* 


P^LAEQECGLQGY GY lvlICROFADNAS 

In the Fort St. John area, British Columbia, the ammonite 
Neogastroplites occurs with deep-water ammonites immediately below 
the fish scale sand zone. The Fort St. John sea was widespread 
immediately prior to Neogastroplites time, as indicated by the known 
extent of contemporaneous sediments. During Neogastroplites time, 
the nearest shoreline was at least 60 miles from Fort St. John, and 
the known, distribution of later Fort St. John sediments indicates that 
these offshore conditions continued well above the fish scale sand zone 
in the Fort St. John area* 

Immediately above the Neogastroplites zone in the Fort St. John 
area, the basal portion of the Haplophragmoides 49Q4-A fauna at the base 
of the fish scale sand zone contains a few specimens of Tritaxia , 
Hyperammina , Textularia , and Miliamoiina (?). This basal assemblage 
represents moderately deep, slightly brackish-water conditions. As the 
sea-bottom of the fish scale sand zone became more silty, this basal 
assemblage was rapidly replaced by a microfaunal assemblage dominated 
by Reophax, Ammobaculites , and haplophragmoides , with lesser

numbers of Proteonina and Verneuilina . This microfaunal assemblage 
indicates that the silt of the fish scale sand in this area was 
deposited in continuing moderately deep water with brackish tendencies. 

As deposition of silt subsided, the Haplophragmoides 4904-A fauna rapidly 
disappeared, with only a few species closely resembling Haplophragmoides 
4901-L and Proteonina 4901-F continuing up into the Pulchellia (?) sp.- 
bearing beds. 

The occurrence of Pulchellia (?) sp. and Acanthoceras above the 
fish scale sands up to the Double Flexible shale indicates that the 
Fort St. John sea remained moderately deep until the deposition of 
the Double Flexible shale beds. The microfauna within these 
Pulchellia- bearing beds is a degenerate fauna dominated by species 
closely resembling Proteonina 4901-F and Haplophragmoides 4901-L of 
the fish scale sand zone. Also present within these beds are: 

Theocyrtis (?), which appears immediately above the Second Tuff horizon; 
Hyperammina , which occurs briefly 90 feet above the base of the fish 
scale sands; rare specimens of Guoibelitria and Marginulina ; numerous 
fish scales and spores; and occasional fish bones, fish teeth, and 
carbonized wood fragments. The occurrence of the Radiolarian genus 
Theocyrtis (?) immediately above the Second Tuff could be expected 
considering the increased quantity of silica available, but its occur¬ 
rence along with other pelagic forms such as Gumbelitria and Marginulina , 
in association with Pulchellia (?) sp. and Acanthoceras , tends to 
corroborate the hypothesis that fairly deep-water conditions prevailed 


at this time. Fish remains, being pelagic, are not especially diagnostic 
because deposition of this material could take place under diverse

ecological conditions. The occurrence of "spores” and carbonized 


wood fragments probably represents material transported a considerable 
distance from land by winds and currents. The moderately deep-water 
species of Proteonina and Haplophragmoides occur almost continuously 
from above the fish scale sands to the base of the Double Flexible 
shale zone, indicating essentially static seas throughout this interval 
However, Proteonina and Haplophragmo ides , as well as spores, wood 
fragments, and pelagic Foraminifera suddenly disappear with deposition 
of the Double Flexible shale beds. 

The distinctive Trochammina 4615-A fauna makes its initial 
appearance at the base of the Double Flexible shale beds, providing 
a distinct faunal and lithological break. The Double Flexible shale 
is composed almost entirely of poorly-preserved fish scales cemented 
with a relatively small amount of mud, which would account for the 
flexible nature of this shale. Numerous pyrite buttons and fish bones 
are also present within this flexible shale. 

The prolific fauna of the Double Flexible shale is dominated by 
one species of Trochammina and two species of Miliamraina . This is a 
shallow-water fauna with strong brackish tendencies. The sudden 
appearance of this fauna, together with the remarkable abundance of 
fish scales, indicates rapid shallowing of the Fort St. John sea just 
prior to the deposition of the Double Flexible shale beds. The sea 
remained static throughout the deposition of the Double Flexible shales 
and was fairly widespread, as indicated by the known extent of 
contemporaneous beds, and by the occurrence of similar faunas in 
the Sikanni Chief Biver area, and in the ICiskatinaw Test Hole.

However, after the deposition of the Double Flexible shale beds, 
the Trochammina 4615-A fauna dwindles and becomes poorly preserved 
toward the First Tuff horizon, and is absent after the deposition of 
the First Tuff. Gradually changing ecological conditions, possibly 
a slow deepening of the sea, is postulated. 

An unsampled interval of about 117 feet occurs above the First 
Tuff horizon, and the fauna encountered immediately above this un¬ 
sampled interval is the distinctive Lituotuba 4500-C fauna. This is 
a prolific fauna, but is generally poorly preserved. 

The lower part of the Lituotuba fauna is dominated by one or 
more species of Lituotuba , along with minor numbers of Hyyeranmina , 

Haplophragmoides , Nodosinella , and Verneuilina . This is a moderately 

✓ 

shallow-water fauna. The lower faunule is gradually replaced by 
several species of Miliammina toward the upper part of the faunal 
zone, indicating further shallowing with probable brackish tendencies.

CORRELATION RITE THE EASTERN PEAGE BIVER AREA, ALBERTA 
Nielsen has reported very poor microfaunal recovery from within 
and near the fish scale siltstone band (fish scale sands) of the Lower 
Shaftesbury formation in the Eastern Peace Biver area, Alberta, but 
has included this fauna in the uppermost part of his Miliammina- 
Tritaxia fauna (3a). The writer examined Nielsen’s microfaunal suites 
from this zone, and found certain elements in common with the 


Haplophragmoides 4904-A fauna within the fish scale sand zone of the

CHAPTER III 

EORMAL DESCRIPTIONS OF UIOROFAUNA 

Certain new Foraminifera worthy of description were selected 
from the microfaunal assemblages recovered from the upper part of 
the Port St* John shales. These are here described and illustrated. 

All of the Foraminifera described have been specifically designated 
by a number rather than a name to avoid creation of manuscript names. 

The Foraminifera are described in alphabetical and numerical 
sequence, the number immediately following the generic name indicating 
the microfaunal suite from which the hypotype was taken. 

The stratigraphic positions of all microfaunal suites are shown 
in Fart II of the Appendix of this thesis.

Remarks: This species is distinctive because of the 
immediate development of almost the full diameter at the start of 
the triserial portion. This species resembles Gaudryina painoides 
Wickenden (1932), from the Boyne beds of Manitoba. The species from 
the Boyne beds is much smaller, relatively more elongate, and has 
more chambers. This species also resembles G-audryina hektori Nauss, 
from 25 feet above the base of the Lloydminster shale in Northwest 
Mannville No. 1 Well, Alberta. The Lloydminster species has more 
chambers and is much larger.

and less neatly coiled. The extreme variability of this form renders 
identification uncertain, and there is a possibility that more than 
one species is present. The generic assignment of this species is 
also open to question, as there is some indication that it might be 
a degenerate three-chambered Miliammina because there tends to be a 
greater constriction of the second tube at the base of the straightened- 
out portion.

slightly depressed; wall finely arenaceous with much cement and 
an outer coating of translucent cement; aperture terminal, simple, 
a slightly restricted opening at the end of the last-formed chamber. 

Length of hypotype 0.62mm., width 0.28mm. 

Hypotype locality: Mouth of St. John Creek, Sec. 14, Tp.84, 

R.18, W6th. meridian, British Columbia, locality B; Upper Fort St.

Remarks: This species resembles a species of miliammina 
described by Stelck from the Sikanni shales, 202 feet above the Fourth 
Sikanni sandstone on Sikanni Chief River, two miles below Alaska 
Highway bridge, British Columbia, The Sikanni species is smaller and 
somewhat finer-grained. The Sikanni species more closely resembles 
flattened specimens of Miliammina 4614-A.

Hypotype: University of Alberta Pal. Type Coll. 

Remarks: This species resembles a species of Miliammina 
described by Stelck from the middle part of the Dunvegan formation 
on Peace River, one mile west of the mouth of Hines Creek, Alberta. 

The Dunvegan species has a flared aperture and is slightly coarser- 
grained. This species also closely resembles Miliammina 4505-A 
from 160 feet above the First Tuff at locality C, but the latter is 
much coarser-grained, slightly larger, and the ultimate chamber becomes 
larger toward the apertural end.

Hypotype: University of Alberta Pal. Type Coll. 

Remarks: The weak partitioning of the last four chambers 
of this species suggests exterior constriction rather than chambering. 

The nature of the last four chambers and the small aperture introduces 
a possibility that this genus should be assigned to Hippocrepina . This 
hypotype is similar to the ultimate half of the Recent species Hippocrepina 
indivisa Parker, and may represent a megalospheric form of the latter 
genus. The weak chambering of this species is similar to that of 
Nodosinella 4501-B from 123 feet above the First Tuff on Beatton 
River, British Columbia, locality C. This hypotype also shows a remark¬ 
able resemblance to the Recent species Hippocrepinella hirudinea Heron- 
Alien and Garland, in shape, wall structure, aperture, and constrictions 
or wrinkling resembling chambering* 

Nodosinella 4501-B 
Plate III, Fig. 20,21,22 

Test uniserial, tapering rapidly, somewhat compressed, with a 
small proloculum and four later chambers increasing in size as added, 
chambers indistinct, at an angle of about thirty degrees to the axis 
of the test, width of chambers much greater than the length; sutures 
fairly distinct, thickened giving a double-wall effect, at an angle 
of about thirty degrees to the axis of the test; wall finely arenaceous, 
with grains set in a finely arenaceous matrix of grains and cement, 
surface irregularly pappilate; aperture terminal, large, at the end 
of the last-formed chamber* 

Length of hypotype 0.6mm., maximum width 0.4mm.

about 123 feet above the First Tuff. 

Hypotype: University of Alberta Pal. Type Coll. 

Remarks: The apparent chambers of this species could be 
caused by exterior constrictions of the test, in which case it could 
be assigned to the genus Hyperamminoides . This species resembles the 
initial portion of the microspheric form of a Pennsylvanian species 
Hyperamminoides elegans (Cushman and Waters) in wall structure and 
rapidly tapering test, but differs in that the sutures or constrictions 
of the former are at an angle to the axis of the test, and the part of 
the test later than the proloculum appears to be chambered. 

Hodosinella 4502-A 

Plate III, Fig.31 

Test elongate, somewhat compressed, uniserial, consisting of a 
small offset proloculum and three later chambers, chambers increasing 
in width to the mid-portion of the test, then tapering slightly toward 
the apertural end, proloculum distinct, remaining chambers indistinct; 
sutures curved, thickened, each suture marked by three incipient sub¬ 
parallel lineal depressions, only the initial suture distinct; wall 
finely arenaceous with grains to 0.008mm* in size, much cement giving 
the exterior a smooth dull finish and obscuring the outline of grains, 
chambers, and sutures; aperture wide, at the end of the last-formed 
chamber, about two-thirds the diameter of the ultimate chamber. 

Length of hypotype 0.46mm., maximum diameter 0.25mm. 

Hypotype locality: Beatton River, Sec.l, Tp,85, R.18, W6th. 
meridian, British Columbia, locality C; Upper Fort St. John shales 
about 129 feet above the First Tuff.

Remarks: This species resembles a species of Nodosinella 
described by Nielsen from the lower part of the Shaftesbury formation 
290 feet below the fish scale zone on Smoky River, Alberta. The 
Shaftesbury specimen differs in that it has two more chambers, lacks 
the distinctive offset proloculum, has a more restricted aperture, and 
has a thicker wall. The wide aperture of Nodosinella 4502-A is similar 
to that of Nodosinella 4501-B from the same locality, but 6 feet higher 
stratigraphically, and appears to belong to the same group. The chamber¬ 
ing shown by Nodosinella 4502-A strongly resembles the constrictions 
of Hippocripin a bendensis Harlton, a Pennsylvanian species from 
Oklahoma.

Test a single bottle-shaped chamber with rounded base, sides 
almost parallel, slightly tapered elongate neck set at an angle to 
the test; wall arenaceous, fairly thick, grains embedded in siliceous 
cement, slightly more cement composing the neck, grain size to 0.046mm.; 
aperture terminal, simple, round, at the end of an elongate neck. 

Length of hypotype 0.35mm., width 0.22mm.

Remarks: This species is almost identical to a species of 
Proteonina described by Nielsen from the lower part of the Shaftesbury 
formation, 142 feet below the middle gypsiferous siltstone band, on 
Smoky River, below Judah, Alberta. The Shaftesbury species is much

larger and coarser-grained, with a somewhat differently shaped 
neck. This hypotype shows a suggestion of an incipient second chamber, 
and could be an immature form of Reophax 4901-K from the same suite. 
However, Reophax 4901-K has no neck. 

GENQS REOPHAX Mont fort, 1808 

Reophax 4901-D 
Plate III, Fig. 4 

Test uniserial, tapering, chambers regularly increasing in 
size as added, five chambers composing the test; sutures slightly 
depressed, somewhat indistinct; wall arenaceous, of large well- 
sorted grains to 0.04mm. in size, grains embedded in translucent 
cement with a thin cement covering, though not obscuring the outline 
of the grains; aperture terminal, simple, at the end of the last- 
formed chamber. 

Length of hypotype 0.41mm., maximum diameter 0.18mm. 

Hypotype locality: Septimus Greek, Sec.20, Tp.82, R.18, 

W6th. meridian, British Columbia, locality C; Upper Fort St. John 
shales, one foot above the base of the fish scale sand zone. 

Hypotype: University of Alberta Pal. Type Coll. 

Remarks: This species strongly resembles a species of 
Reophax described by Stelck from the Sikanni shales 202 feet above 
the Fourth Sikanni sandstone on Sikanni Chief River, two miles below 
Alaska Highway bridge, British Columbia. The Sikanni species is much 
larger, with the sand grains of the wall less uniform in size. The 
last four chambers of this hypotype closely resemble those of a 
species of Bigenerina described by Stelck from the same locality as 


Reophax mentioned above, and there is a possibility that this form

Test small, uniserial, straight, tapering, composed of four 
chambers, chambers fairly distinct, increasing in size as added, 
initial chamber fairly large and bulbous, final chamber large and 
sub-pyriform; sutures fairly distinct, somewhat depressed, trans¬ 
verse; wall arenaceous, with grains set in much cement, and with an 
exterior coating of cement subduing the outline of grains, grain 
size to 0.068mm.; aperture terminal, simple, at the end of the last- 
formed chamber. 

Length of hypo type 0.57mm., maximum width 0.34mm. 

Hypotype locality: Septimus Greek, Sec.20, Tp.82, R.18, 

W6th. meridian, British Columbia, locality 0; Upper Fort St. John

Hypotype: University of Alberta Pal. Type Coll. 

Remarks: This species resembles Reophax nevirii Cole, from 
the Eocene of Mexico, but the latter differs in being much larger, 
with more distinct chambers and sutures. This hypotype also resembles 
an undescribed species of Reophax from 4 feet below the middle gypsi¬ 
ferous sandstone in Nielsen’s suites from the lower Shaftesbury 
formation below Judah Station, Alberta. The Shaftesbury species is 
somewhat larger, coarser-grained, and does not taper as rapidly.

GENUS TEXTULARIA Defranee, 1824 

Textularia 4902-C 

Plate III, Fig. 25 

Test small, elongate, tapering, biserial, flattened on the 
biserial side, consisting of two series of alternating chambers with 
eight chambers in each series, chambers distinct except in the earliest 
part, gradually increasing in size as added; sutures somewhat indistinct 
especially in the initial stages, sutures slightly depressed and limbate 
wall finely arenaceous, thin, with evenly-pebbled appearance on the sur¬ 
face; aperture at the inner margin of the last-formed chamber. 

Length of hypo type 0.32mm., maximum width 0.03mm. 

Hypotype locality: Septimus Greek, Sec.20, Tp.82, R.18, W6th. 
meridian, British Columbia, locality A; Upper Fort St. John shales, one 
foot above the base of the fish scale sand zone. 

Hypotype: University of Alberta Pal. Type Coll. 

Remarks: This species resembles a species of Textularia 
described by Stelck from the Kaskapau shales 74 feet below the base 
of the Inoceramus labiatus zone on liiskatinaw River, Arras, British 
Columbia. The Easkapau species has fewer chambers and is much less 
slender. The shape of the chambers of this hypotype somewhat resemble 
Textularia subhaueiri Cushman, from the Upper Cretaceous Byram marl, 
but the latter is much larger, coarser-grained, and stouter. There is 
a possibility that the first three chambers of this hypotype are coiled.

APPENDIX - PART I 

TECHNICAL PROCEDURE AND FIELD WORK 

FIELD WORE 

The samples examined by the writer were collected in the Fort 
St. John area, British Columbia, by a Pacific Petroleums Ltd. field 
party during the 1950 field season. The field party consisted of 
C. R. Stelck, W. G-. Bahan, R. Sutherland, J. Ontko, W. Panasiuk, 

e 

S. Paskvich, E. Rosen, and C. Butler-Stony. 

Samples of the Upper Fort St. John formation were collected 
at locality A by R. Sutherland and J. Ontko on Septimus Creek, B. C., 
See. 20, Tp. 82, R.18, W6th.; at locality B by R. Sutherland at the 
mouth of St. John Creek, B. C., Tp. 84, R.18, W6th # ; at locality C 
by R. Sutherland and C. R. Stelck on Beatton River, B. C., Sec. 1, 

Tp. 85, R.18, W6th.; and at locality E by W. 0. Bahan from a test 
hole drilled § mile downstream from Kiskatinaw bridge on the Alaska 
Highway in N?^ See. T P* 80 » B.17, W6th., B. C. 

Stratigraphically, samples used by the writer range from the top 
of a fish scale sand located approximately 690 feet below the base of 
the overlying Dunvegan formation, to a point approximately 175 feet 
below the base of the Dunvegan formation. The samples were tied in 
with several well established horizon markers, which in ascending 
order include: a fish scale sand immediately overlying a Neogastroplites 
zone, a tuff bed (Second Tuff), a double flexible shale bed, a tuff bed 
(First Tuff), and a cone-in-cone bed. Continuity of vertical section 






' 








between sampling localities was established by correlation of 
individual beds and direct measurement of the section between sample 
points* 

The samples were obtained by following a discontinuous sampling 
procedure. Normally, samples were taken at six-foot intervals, but 
intervals varied from three to ten feet, A shallow pit was dug at 
each sampling point and a six-inch section was sampled. Each sample 
was hand-picked to remove all ironstone matter and hard sandy material* 
Samples were immediately placed in postal-type cotton bags and were 
shipped directly to the Department of Geology, University of Alberta, 
Edmonton, Alberta* 

TECHNICAL PROCEDURE 

The procedure used in the preparation of microfossils for final 
study follows the outline given by A. R. Nielsen in his thesis (3a,pp.5-8)» 

Systematic examination of samples yielded certain morphologic types 
suitable for description and figuring. One hypotype of each morphologic 
type was selected and transferred to a single-cell slide. Several 
paratypes were mounted in the cell with each hypotype. 

Specimens were variously orientated and photographed, using 
Superpan Press film and a Leitz Wetzler M4B camera in conjunction with 
a Leitz No. 394635 microscope. The films were developed by the writer, 
using equipment available in the Department of Geology, University of 
Alberta* A magnification of thirty five times was used throughout* 
Printing, as well as enlarging wherever required, was done by a 
commercial firm (Silvertone)*

The photographs were retouched, where necessary, to accentuate 
certain features. Photographs of each specimen were then carefully 
cut out and remounted on a black mat surface. The set of photographs 
of specimens was again retouched to obtain a balanced intensity of 
contrast. The completed mount was then rephotographed by a commercial 
firm (Bell) to produce the plate used in this thesis.

APP5NDIX - PART II 

DESCRIPTION OF SECTIONS AND INDEX OF FORAMINIFERAL SUITES 

The writer’s foraminiferal suites were collected from the upper 
part of the Fort St. John formation, between the base of a fish-scale 
sand member to a point approximately 175 feet above the First Tuff, and 
175 feet below the base of the Dunvegan formation (see p.14 )• The 
interval between the First Tuff and a point about 117 feet above the 
First Tuff is unsampled. 

A. R. Nielsen (3 a ) completed a microfaunal study of the lower part 
of the Shaftesbury (Upper Fort St. John) formation in the eastern Peace 
River area, Alberta. Nielsen’s microfaunal collections were taken from 
the upper part of the Peace River formation and the lower part of the 
Shaftesbury formation, using the base of a fish-scale siltstone band as 
a marker horizon in the latter formation. 

The writer’s microfaunal suites were taken from the following 
lithologic succession of strata: 

LOCALITY A (Suites 4900-4944) Fort St. John formation from the base of the 
fish-scale zone to the Second Tuff, on Septimus Creek, British Columbia, 
in Sec.20, Tp.82, R.18, W6th. The section was described by ¥. G. Bahan, 
and the samples were collected by R. Sutherland and J. Ontko. 

8” Tuff--rusty colored, irregularly-bedded; lowermost 2” contains 
spotty, poorly-consolidated, greyish-white tuff intermixed 
with yellowish tuff. 

—This is referred to as the Second Tuff horizon in this report, 
and is figured in Plate II, Fig. 1, though not from the same 
locality.
