LEUCOCYTES AND THE REDUCTION 
OE METHYLENE BLUE 
IN MILK 


No J. STRYNADKA 








GENERAL INTRODUCTION 


The methylene blue reduction test is one of the 
three standard methods of estimating bacterial populations 
in milk which are in universal use in milk control work* 

This test is used on the Calgary and Edmonton raw milk 
supplies almost to the entire exclusion of all other bacter¬ 
iological tests* 

Operators of the test have observed for many years 
that there are occasionally milks of short reduction times 
which do not contain sufficient numbers of bacteria as 
measured by the plate count or the microscopic count to 
account for the reduction by bacterial action* Some of 
these milks were known to be high in leucocyte contents and 
for twenty years it has been customary to accord to leucocytes 
a reducing power of sufficient magnitude to be a factor in 
the reduction of methylene blue in milk* 

The present study which is an attempt to throw some 
light upon the reducing properties of leucocytes in milk, 
naturally divides itself into three phases which will be dis¬ 
cussed in the following three sections 

I* The accuracy of the available methods of measuring 
bacteria and leucocytes in milk* 

II* The role of leucocytes in the reduction of methylene 
blue in milk* 

III* The incidence of mastitis among the cows in the Edmonton 


milk shed

METHODS 


All sanples of milk were obtained by the author 
during a study of milk production problems in the Edmonton 
district and are divided into three classes, viz.:- 

1* Herd milk, which is mixed milk from one or 
more cows drawn into utensils of varying degrees of sterility 
the samples being taken from the cans# 

2* Udder milks, which are composite samples 
of approximately equal anDunts of milk from each milking 
quarter carefully drawn into sterile flasks from half 
empty udders which were in almost all cases previously 
washed with disinfectant solution* 

3 * quarter milks, which are samples drawn 
from individual quarters using the technique described in 
» 2 ». 

These samples were immediately brought to the 
laboratory and prepared fortesting* The maximum time 
elapsing between sampling and the start of the test was 
three hours* 

Standard Methods of Milk Analysis [ 1929 ) was 
followed for the plate counts, the microscopic counts, and 
the methylene blue reduction test, except that 1 % of glucose 
was added to the standard nutrient agar used in the plating 
technique* The standard methylene blue test was supplemented 
by a modified technique (Thornton and Hastings, 192?) which

consisted of shaking the tubes of methylene blue milk each 
half hour during incubation in the constant temperature 
water bath* The tubes used in the standard methylene blue 
technique were plugged with non-absorbent cotton while lubber 
stoppers were employed in the case of the modified technique* 
^he counting of plates was done with the aid of a lumi-lens 
colony counter and a hand tally was used for recording all 
bacterial aid leucocyte counts* 

The Breed factor of the microscope used in the 
microscopic technique was almost exactly 600,000* Microscopic 
counts of both bacteria and leucocytes are based upon the 
examination of a number of fields varying from 3 to 6000 
fields (whole smear) per smear* Unless otherwise stated, 
the count is based upon the examination of 60 fields* All 
leucocytes, lymphocytes and epithelial cells are classed as 
leucocytes in this study* 

Where the term "counts” is used it invariably 
means counts per cubic centimeter* 

In this study the possibility of the presence of 
unstained and therefore uncountable leucocytes in the milk 
was recognized but was disregarded* The fact that different 
kinds of leucocytes may have different reduction abilities 
was also disregarded. 

Reduction times are reported in hours and minutes: 


9:^0 meaning 9 hours and 30 minutes

THE ACCURACY OF THE AVAILABLE METHODS 


OF MEASURING BACTERIA AND LEUCOCYTES 


IN MILK 




INTRODUCTION 


A number of different methods of measuring 
bacteria in milk have been developed, but only three of 
these methods have retained a sufficient degree of popu¬ 
larity to be to-day in general use in milk control labor¬ 
atories, These three methods are: the Standard Plate 
Method, the Direct Microscopic Method, and the Methylene 
Blue Reduction Test, These methods are recognized by the 
.American Public Health Association in "Standard Methods of 
Milk Analysis", 

The accuracies of these methods have been 
studied during the past few decades and a great deal of 
controversy between different workers has resulted. In many 
cases in the past the accuracy of these bacteriological 
methods has been studied by comparing bacterial counts 
obtained by the same method from duplicate samples. In 
such cases it is possible that these counts may be affected 
by a constant source of error which affects all duplicates 
nearly proportionately. It is reasonable to suppose that 
such an effect may be produced on replicate plate counts 
by the clumping of bacteria, and it may be possible to obtain 
reasonably comparable replicate counts by this method, while 
such counts may not necessarily be a true measure of the 
actual bacterial content of the milk. In the early studies

on the accuracy of the methylene blue reduction test 
many workers compared it with the plate method assuming 
on the basis of experiments of the nature cited above 
that the plate method is reasonably accurate, and the dis¬ 
crepancies which were frequently observed between the two 
methods were in many cases attributed to the inaccuracy of 
the methylene blue reduction test* However, the more recent 
work shows a tendency to question the accuracy of the plate 
method* 

The experimental work on the* accuracy of the 
direct microscopic method as it is applied to milk analysis 
has not been very extensive* This is perhaps partly due to 
the fact that this method is less frequently employed in 
milk control work* 

In this section of this report an attempt will 
be made to illustrate with experimental data some of the 
reasons for these methods tending to give conflicting results 
so frequently. Particular attention will be drawn to the 
methylene blue reduction test and its relationships to the 
other bacteriological tests* 

Since the main reason for this study is to learn 
the effect of leucocytes in the methylene blue reduction 
test, and since recent work on the occurrence of leucocytes 
in milk has been very extensive, it was thought advisable 
to study the accuracy of the direct microscopic method

(Prescott and Breed l1911)) which is to-day almost univer¬ 
sally used in estimating the leucocyte content in milk* 

Data will he presented which will bring to light some new 
information on the accuracy of this method as it is applied 
in the quantitative studies of leucocytes in milk* 


PLATE C GUM'S AND METHYLENE BLUE 
REDUCTION TIMES OF HERD MILKS 


during the course of our study of milk contam¬ 
ination in this district it was frequently observed that 
many samples of herd milk and of udder milk gave very low 
plate counts and unexpectedly short reduction times* A 
number of such milks are reported in Table I* A similar 
relationship has been reported by Dorner (1933)* This worker 
found that of 331 samples of milk with bacterial contents of 
less than 30,000 per c.c* as shown by the Burri technique, 

129 had reduction times of less than six hours* Miles (1933) 
also reported discrepancies of the same nature, and on the 
basis of such results this worker comes to the conclusion 
that the only advantages the methylene blue reduction test 
has over the plate method are its cheapness and the compar¬ 
ative rapidity and ease with which the test can be carried 
out* According to this worker’s claim, the reductase test 
as compared vfith the plate method is not a fair method for

the grading of milk intended for liquid consumption® 

Miles also states that he found a closer correlation 
between the plate counts and the keeping quality than 
between the reduction time and the keeping time* His 
data, however, do not show this very clearly* While it 
is true that this investigator shows samples of milk 
among his data which reduced in less than two and one 
half hours and remained sweet for three days, this does 
not necessarily prove the inaccuracy of the reduction 
test* It may be that some of these milks came from ab¬ 
normal udders and were reduced not as a result of bacterial 
activity but due to causes other than bacteria* ^his worker 
also reports milks with low plate counts and exceptionally 
short reduction times* If such discrepancies are attributed 
to the inaccuracy of the reduction test then it seems 
that this worker failed to take into consideration the 
clumping of bacteria in milk, and also the effects of clump¬ 
ing on the plate count and the reduction time* It is obvious 
that the plate method does not measure the individual cells 
within the clump while on the other hand it is probable that 
the reduction test measures the a ctivity of all active 
bacteria present in the sample of milk* This, therefore, 
indicates that it may be the plate method which is at fault 
rather than the reduction test# 

In the past it has been usual to attribute such 


discrepancies to the inaccuracies of the reduction test

Due to the work of Skar (1913, 193D leucocytes have been 
viewed with suspicion in connection with their reducing 
properties in milk, and some workers attribute some of the 
pronounced discrepancies between plate counts and reduction 
times to the action of leucocytes in the reduction test. 

An attempt will be made in this paper to discuss this question 
and data will be presented which will throw some light on 
both of the above contentions. 

In examining the figures reported in Table I, 
we find many extreme and unexpected results* It will be 
noted that of the j>6 milks reported, l8 gave plate counts 
of less than j>0,000 and reduction times of less than six 
hours* We should also note that two of these milks reduced 
in less than two and one-half hours and gave plate counts 
of not more than j>0G per c*c. 

Data reported in Table II show the existence of 
marked differences between the reduction times of milks 
produced in sterile utensils and the reduction times of 
milks produced in producer’s utensils* These differences 
are more pronounced in the modified reduction times than they 
are in the standard times 0 On the other hand no such appar¬ 
ent differences are shown by the plate counts of these milks. 
The plate counts of producer’s utensil milks show in the 
majority of cases insufficient bacteria to account for the 
respective reduction times* Where keeping times were 
studied it was found that in every case sterile utensil 
milk remained sweet much longer than did the milk that was

produced in producer’s utensils, ^he plate counts and the 
methylene blue reduction times of the different milks pro¬ 
duced on these ten farms are averaged in Table II. The 
average standard reduction time for the sterile utensil 
milks was 12:20 as contrasted with an average reduction time 
of 8:16 for producer’s utensil milk. The average plate 
count of sterile utensil milks was 1,1?0 as compared with 
8,538 for producer’s utensil milks. We should note that 
the average plate count of the latter milks would be less 
than 4,000 if Milk U C 11 from farm No. 2 were excluded. These 
data show very clearly that it would not be fair to judge the 
bacteriological qualities of these milks on the basis of the 
plate count. These observations prove that bacteria must 
have been present in most of these milks, which the methylene 
blue reduction test measured more adequately than did the 
plate count, therefore, it was suspected that clumping of 
bacteria was responsible for the discrepancies noted, since 
it is universally recognized that bacteria, particulerily 
those from non-sterile utensils, tend to exist in large groups. 

Bata reported in Table III will show that many of 
these herd milks harboured large numbers of groups of bacteria. 
This is shown by the difference between group counts and in¬ 
dividual counts. Since these microscopic counts are based 
on the examination of 60 fields per smear, we do not consider 
them very accurate. To substantiate the results given by the 
microscopic examinations, smears were made from nineteen of 
these milks at the moment of reduction. All of these smears

were made from the tubes in the modified tests. If reduction 
of the methylene blue in milk is the result of bacterial ac¬ 
tivity then a microscopic examination of the milk at the 
moment of reduction should reveal sufficient bacteria to 
account for that phenomenon. The bacterial counts at the 
moment of reduction of the nineteen herd milks reported in 
Table III show that in every case there were enough bacteria 
present to account for the reduction times of these milks,. 
The accuracy of these counts is somewhat questionable as they 
are based on the examination of only five fields per smear, 
and it was found difficult to count the individual cells with 
extreme certainty due to the presence of large clumps and 
chains. These figures should, therefore, be considered only 
as estimates. It is believed that these estimates are 
reasonably accurate and in any case likely represent the 
minimum number of bacteria present. The average bacterial 
count at the moment of reduction of these nineteen milks is 
108,324,000 per c,c,, which is much higher than the average 
plate count of milk at the moment of reduction reported by 
Thornton and Hastings (192?), These workers reported an 
average plate count of approximately 21 million. It is 
reasonable to expect plate counts to be considerably lower 
than microscopic counts due principally to the clumping of 
bacteria. 

On closer analysis of the data presented in Table 
III, we find ten milks which showed plate counts of less than

50,000 and which had reduction times of less than six hours® 
These plate counts, therefore, seem to indicate that there 
were insufficient bacteria to account for these reduction 
times. When we examine the microscopic counts of these 
milks, we find that large groups of bacteria were found in 
all cases, and in the case of those where smears were mad© 
at the moment of reduction and examined microscopically, 
enough bacteria were observed to account for the reduction. 

The microscopic counts of individual cells alone show suf¬ 
ficient bacteria to account for the reduction times. If we 
were to assume a generation time of one-half to one hour for 
the bacteria during incubation of the methylene blue tests, 
we would find that the microscopic count of the individual 
cells would give an arbitrary count at the moment of reduction 
which would approximate the average of the 19 counts made at 
the moment of reduction as reported in Table III. On the 
other hand it is evident that the plate counts reported in 
Table III will not in the majority of cases give similar 
theoretical results. In Table YIII microscopic counts are 
reported where 1,000 fields per smear were examined. These 
data also show great variations between the bacterial plat© 
counts and direct microscopic counts. The following milks are 
the more outstanding in this respect, namely, milks Nos. 8, 

17, 25, 59 , 60, 68 and 70. It will be noted that large 
groups of bacteria were observed in all these milks. Upon 
noting the reduction times of these milks, we find that in 
no case these exceeded 9:30. Since these milks reduced in

comparatively short times and large groups of bacteria 
were observed, it may be concluded that the bacterial counts 
obtained by the plate method were far from being accurate* 

On the basis of these data we may conclude that 
the plate counts are often misleading as they do not measure 
the true bacterial content of milk when bacteria tend to 
occur in large aggregates. On the other beand, these results 
seem to show that the methylene blue reduction test measures the 
bacterial content of such milks much more accurately. This 
therefore, indicates that the reduction test is not affected 
by clumping of bacteria to the same degree as is the plate 
count. 


THE ACCURACY 

OF THE MICROSCOPIC COUNT OF BACTERIA 
IN MILK 


The accuracy of the direct microscopic method 
as it is applied to the measuring of bacterial populations in 
milk has been studied by various workers. The most extensive 
study that appears in the literature is reported by Breed and 
Stocking (1920). These workers investigated the accuracy of 
this method by comparing the counts on duplicate smears ob¬ 
tained by two analysts. The counts were based on the examin¬ 
ation of 100 fields per smear. The data reported by these 
investigators show that they were able to obtain counts that

checked rather closely. On the average it may be said 
that their results checked closer than one would expect 
when all factors that tend to affect this test are taken 
into consideration. These workers also compared the 
microscopic counts with the plate counts. Their results 
show that in most cases the plate count comes between the 
microscopic count of groups (isolated single cells, chains 
and clumps) and the microscopic count of individual cells. 

In the study reported here an attempt was made 
to gather some information on the extent of clumping of 
bacteria in milk and also on the distribution of climps, 
chains and bacterial cells throughout the smear. It has 
not been infrequently observed in the case of milks giving 
short methylene blue reduction times that there may appear 
very few or no bacteria when only 60 fields per smear are 
examined microscopically which would indicate insufficient 
bacteria to account for the reduction. We may question the 
accuracy of the microscopic counts particularly in the case 
of milks with low bacterial content for the following 
reasons: 

1. Where the bacteria, especially small cocci, occur 
singly, it is frequently impossible to distinguish them with 
certainty from stained, non-bacterial matter. This factor 
becomes less important in milks where bacteria are present 
as diplococci, chains or as clumps.

2. The uneven distribution of the bacteria in the 
milk and the small number of bacteria in the entire smear. 

An entire smear (0*01 c*c* of milk) would contain only 100 
bacterial cells if the original milk contained 10,000 
bacterial cells per c*c** If there were approximately 
6,000 microscopic fields per smear then in the example 
cited there would be an average of only one bacterium per 
sixty fields* The normal uneven distribution of these bac¬ 
teria is exaggerated because of clumping and therefore in 
this study it was not infrequently found that many times 
sixty fields had to be examined before an organism was 
encountered. This is illustrated in the figures of the 37 
udder milks reported in Table IY. 

An examination of these datm reveals a few sig¬ 
nificant things. In the first place it should be noted that 
in 22 of these milks no bacteria were found when only sixty 
fields per smear were examined. In 13 of the 22 milks, 
groups ranging from two to 1130 cells were found when 1,000 
fields were examined. We should also note that with milks 
containing less than 33*000 bacteria per c.e. as determined 
by the examination of 1,000 fields per smear, there were no 
bacteria encountered when only sixty fields per smear were 
searched. This, however, does not mean that no bacteria 
would ever be found in such milks when only sixty fields per 
smear are searched, but nevertheless this seems to indicate 
that there is only a small chance of encountering bacteria

in such milks when employing this microscopic technique# 

Samples Nos# 3 and 20 should be noted: these 
samples gave counts of 107,4-00 and 720,000 bacteria per 
c.c# respectively when 1,000 fields were examined, but no 
bacteria were found when only sixty fields were searched# 

In both of these milks large groups were observed# We 
should note, too, that in the case of 12 milks, more than 
100 fields had to be examined before any bacteria were 
encountered. The 1,000 field counts of these 12 milks 
ranged from 4,200 to 36,000 per c.c#, and the largest 
group found in any one of these milks was a clump of 6 
cells. This, therefore, is indicative that uneven dis¬ 
tribution of cells throughout the entire smear is not 
confined to very low count milks and those containing 
clumps and chains, but occurs also in milks containing 
relatively large numbers of bacteria existing as single 
and diplococci# 

If we compare the 60 and the 1,000 field counts, 
we find that in the majority of low count milks the exam¬ 
ination of 60 fields per smear reveals the absence of 
bacteria, while with milks relatively low in bacterial 
content but containing large groups of bacteria, a very 
high count may be obtained when only 60 fields are examined# 
This is illustrated by Samples Nos# 18 and 24. ^hese 
figures seem to show definitely that a microscopic count 
based on the examination of sixty fields per smear may be

very misleading, and does not invariably tell anything 
about the true bacterial content of milks that harbour 
relatively few bacteria, and of those milks where large 
groups of bacteria are found* 

In these data there are 9 milks reported of 
which 2,000 fields per smear were examined. If we com¬ 
pare the 2,000 field counts with the 1,000 field counts, 
we find in most cases rather wide variations between these 
figures. Samples Nos. 12 and 35 are the most significant 
in this regard. It will be noted that in both these milks 
large groups of bacteria were found. It appears that these 
variations are due entirely to the uneven distribution of 
chains and clumps throughout the entire smear. 

On the basis of these experimental results, we 
may conclude that the inaccuracies in the direct microscopic 
method of estimating bacteria in milk are mainly due to 
the uneven distribution of single cocci and of clumps and 
chains of bacteria in the stained smear. These results 
further show that this method may give misleading results 
particularly when used on low count milks and on milks 
that harbour many bacteria in the form of large groups.

THE ABILITY OF THE O.Ol C.C. PIPETTE (BREED) 
TO DELIVER A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE 
OF MILK FOR THE SMEAR 


Breed and Brew (1916) presented some data on 
the accuracy of the standardized 0.01 c.c. pipette. 

They weighed the amounts of milk discharged by the pipette 
and obtained an average weight of 0.0101 gram for 20 dis¬ 
charges. These workers reported 2.0 per cent as the 
maximum deviation from the mean for the accuracy of the 
pipette in measuring samples of milk for the smear. 

To substantiate the findings reported in 
Tables III and IV on the uneven distribution of bacteria 
over the entire smear, two series of 8 replicate smears 
in each series from two samples of aseptically drawn 
milk were subjected to a microscopic examination in which 
6,000 fields (entire smear) were examined. Data pre¬ 
sented in Table V show the results of this study. The 
samples were kept thoroughly mixed during the preparation 
of the smears. An smears were made of discharges from 
the same pipette which was thoroughly cleaned and dried 
after each discharge, ^he smears were all examined with 
utmost care under the microscope and in every case the 
total number of bacteria occuring in the entire smear was 
recorded. An ocular micrometer for the Breed technique 
was used with the regular standardized microscope, and

strips of the smear equal in width to the diameter of 
the circle on the ocular micrometer were examined. The 
first strip was started in the corner of the smear and 
the slide was moved slowly until the other side of the 
smear was reached. Then from here a new strip lying 
parallel and closely adjoining the first was examined in 
the same manner as the first. This process was continued 
until the whole smear was covered. In this way (by using 
the ocular micrometer) only the central part of the actual 
field was examined, which portion of the field appeared 
in a fairly uniform focus. It was, however, found necessary 
to focus the objective frequently in order to differentiate 
between bacteria and other stained matter. 

The figures reported in Table V seem to show 
quite definitely that the small portion of the milk drawn 
for the preparation of Treed smears is not always represen¬ 
tative of the sample of milk studied. Data pertaining to 
milk No. 1 show that the variations are mostly due to 
clumping of bacteria. This is shown by the fact that 
variations in the counts of individual cells are much 
higher than in the counts of groups. The relatively low 
variations in the group counts seem to show that these 
figures probably represent mostly bacterialcells and not 
stained non-bacterial matter. The most significant thing 
about these data is the fact that in some of the smears 
hardly any large groups were found, while in others large

groups were encountered. It is not likely that the 
large groups of bacteria were missed during the examin¬ 
ation as the smears were in all cases subjected to an 
equally thorough examination. Ihe fact that the group 
counts are as uniform as they are shows that the smears 
were thoroughly covered. 1 ‘he uniformity in the counts of 
groups seems to indicate that the 0.01 c.c. pipette when 
properly cleaned discharges uniform amounts of milk. 

We should also note that the average microscopic 
count of individual cells in sample No. 1 is j>.4 times as 
high as the plate count of this sample, while the highest 
microscopic count is more than 10 times as high as the 
plate count of the same sample. Duplication in the m iero- 
scopic counting may have been a.factor in this work, but 
was likely quite small, as this was guarded against as much 
as was possible. 

We maj/ conclude from the data reported in Tables 
III, IV and V that the inaccuracies of the direct microscopic 
method when used in the analysis of the classes of raw 
milk under discussion, are mainly due to the uneven dis¬ 
tribution of bacterial cells and of groups of bacteria 
throughout the entire smear, and also to the fact that the 
0.01 c.c. pipette does not remove a representative sample 
of milk for the preparation of smears. 

It should be noted that in this discussion no 
account was taken of dead bacteria and of bacterial cells

which may not have taken the stain* These factors may 
he important when making direct conparisons between the 
results obtained by this method and those obtained by 
some other method, but in a study of this nature these 
factors seem to appear less significant. It is possible 
that any error contributed by the inability of certain 
bacteria to take up the stain would be of a more or less 
constant nature and would affect the replicate counts 
equally* 

In the discussion heretofore, it has been proven 
that with herd milks which give low plate counts, low 
routine microscopic counts and short reduction times, and 
which show large groups of bacteria by the extensive micro¬ 
scopic examination (1,000 Helds per smear) and also enough 
bacteria at the moment of reduction to account for the re¬ 
duction, the methylene blue reduction test measures the 
bacterial populations far more accurately than does either 
the plate method or the routine microscopic method. Further¬ 
more, these data seem to § 10 w that the latter two methods often 
give misleading results with respect to bacterial populations 
in such milks* 

We have seen that clumping of bacteria is the 
main factor causing such discrepancies in the results ob¬ 
tained by the three different methods. It has been shown 
that large groups of bacteria are not uniformily distributed 
throughout the milk and that in the microscopic technique

it may not always be possible to obtain a representative 
sample of milk for the smears. Also since bacteria are not 
uniformily distributed throughout the smear it is impos¬ 
sible to secure accurate information on the bacterial content 
of such milk by the routine microscopic examination. ^he 
inaccuracy of the plate method due to clumping of bacteria 
is self-explanatory and need not be further discussed here# 

On the other hand the reduction test does not seem to be 
affected by clumping of bacteria in the same way and there¬ 
fore this test probably measures the bacterial populations 
of such milks much more accurately than does the plate method# 
So far we have only dealt with milks where enough 
bacteria were found to be present to account for the reduction 
of the methylene blue in the reduction test* We are yet 
to deal with milks which were found to give short reduction 
times, low plate counts and low microscopic counts, and in 
which insufficient bacteria were found at the moment of re¬ 
duction to account for that phenomenon* ^his f therefore, 
leads us to the study of the role of leucocytes in the re¬ 
duction test. This subject will be discussed in another 
section of this paper#

THE ACCURACY OF TEE DIRECT MICROSCOPIC METHOD 
IN ESTIMATING THE LEUCOCYTE CONTENT 
OE MILK 


Since the work already reported has shown that 
the direct microscopic method may give misleading results 
on the bacterial content of milk and since the quantitative 
aspects of leucocytes in milk are receiving a great deal 
of attention at the present time, and also since our study 
centers around the leucocyte contents of milk and their 
relationship to the methylene blue reduction test, it was 
thought advisable to gather some data on the accuracy of the 
direct microscopic method of estimating the leucocyte con¬ 
tent of milk* 

A search in the literature showed only a few 
instances where studieshave been reported on the accuracy 
of the direct microscopic method (Prescott and Breed, 1911) 
of estimating leucocytes in milk* It should be noted here 
that this method is in universal use at the present time for 
the enumeration of leucocytes in milk* 

Breed and Stidger (1911) demonstrated that by the 
use of this technique many more leucocytes were present in 
normal milk than had been previously thought to occur* 

The accuracy of this method has been studied by 
Prescott and Breed (1911). ^hey made a series of 31 tests 
in duplicate — counting 100 fields per smear, and found a 
variation of 14*3 per cent. However, they reported two

cases where the variation were 42.5 and 64.3 per cent 
respectively. In each case the leucocyte content was 
less than 250,000 per c.c.. According to the findings 
reported by these workers, the percentage variations tend 
to be greater with milks low in leucocyte contents. These 
investigators concluded that the variations seem to be due 
to inaccuracy in the counting rather than to the inaccuracy 
in the preparation of the smears. Even on the same smear 
a difference of 15 per cent may occur in two different counts 
according to their report. Since these workers did not 
present complete data and did not state by what method 
they calculated the variations it is difficult to appreciate 
the full significance of their figures. 

Some workers are of the opinion that the leucocyte 
counts are not accurate because of the tendency for leucocytes 
to appear in clumps. %ring the study reported here the 
observation in this regard has been that this seems to be 
true with milks exceptionally high in leucocytes, but in 
such cases it seems that clumping does not contribute very 
much towards the variations in the counts when as many as 
60 fields per smear are searched. With milks containing 
roughly less than one million leucocytes per e.c. clumping 
does not appear to be very prevalent® r ^he inaccuracies 
of this method seem to be due mainly to the uneven distribution 
of leucocytes over the entire smear. The data reported in 
Table VII will possibly give some support to this contention.

The data reported in Table VI give leucocyte 
counts of replicate smears made from four samples of milk* 
Each count reported is based on the examination of 60 
fields per smear* I'he variations are expressed in three 
ways. It will be noted that the maximum deviation from the 
mean varied from 25.05 per cent to 42.07 per cent, while the 
average maximum deviation from the mean for the four milks 
was 50*92 per cent. On the other hand, the average 
absolute deviations from the mean are fairly uniform for 
the four milks. These varied from 12.11 per cent to 
17.14 per cent while the average for the four milks was 
14.05 per cent. These data reveal that the direct 
microscopic method of estimating the leucocyte content 
of milk is subject to a greater degree of inaccuracy 
than has been anticipated. 

A Breed smear from each of the 7 milks reported 
in Table VII was examined by the following technique: 

720 fields per smear were observed and the number of leu¬ 
cocytes in each field noted. Per c.c. counts were then 
computed for each 60 fields in the order of observation 
giving a total of 12 such counts per smear. Throughout 
this work an attempt was made to prevent duplication in 
the examinations asmuch as was possible. 

Scrutiny of these data gives some idea of the 
distribution of leucocytes throughout the smear. T^e 
average maximum deviation from the mean for the 7 milks

was 44.24 per cent. The average absolute deviation from 
themean varied from 9*34 to 29*Q3 per cent with an average 
of 14.99 per cent for the 7 milks. 

In view of the fact that data reported in Tables 
VI and VII show high variations, it is evident that these 
variations were not due to the inaccuracies in obtaining a 
sample of milk for the smear, but were due to the uneven 
distribution of the leucocytes throughout the smear. This 
contention is supported by the fact that variations were as 
high among the counts obtained from the same smear as among 
thoseobtained from the different smears of the same milk. 

These data also seem to confirm the findings of 
other workers who have reported greater variations with 
milks low in leucocyte content. %en we separate the milks 
reported in Tables Vi and Vn that gave average leucocyte 
counts of more than one million, from those that showed less 
than this number of leucocytes per c.c., we find that the 
average maximum deviation from the mean for the former 
class of milks is 30*14 per cent, and for the latter class it 
is 39*16 per cent. The average absolute deviation from the 
mean is 12.03 per cent and 16.15 per cent for the respective 
classes. However, it should be noted that the figures for 
the latter class of milks are influenced considerably by 
milk No. 4 in Table Vll P When this milk is omitted, the 
average deviation from the mean for milks with leucocyte

counts of less than one million is 33*73 P er cent, while 
the average absolute deviation from the mean comes down 
to only 13*58 per cent* These figures, therefore, only 
tend to show that variations seem to be higher with milks 
relatively low in leucocyte content than with milks con¬ 
taining large numbers of leucocytes* 

In view of the ratios of the lowest counts to the 
highest counts reported in Tables ¥1 and VII, it appears 
that this method may often give misleading results on the 
actual leucocyte populations of milk* The average ratio 
of the lowest counts to the highest counts for the 11 milks 
is 1:1*90* Therefore it is evident that the highest count 
may be expected to be approximately 200 per cent of the lowest 
count* We judge this to constitute reasonable accuracy in 
the routine estimation of leucocytes in milk*

PART II 


THE ROLE OF LEUCOCYTES IN THE REDUCTION 

OF METHYLENE BLUE IN MILE 





INTRODUCTION 


There has been very little work reported on the 
effect of leucocytes on the methylene blue reduction test® 

Skar (1913, 1931) seems to have given this question the most 
consideration# In his reports he proves to his own satis¬ 
faction that leucocytes in milk exhibit very marked reduc¬ 
ing properties# However, he did not in any of his papers 
attempt to explain the mechanism of the action of leucocytes 
on the methylene blue# As far as research literature shorn 
there seems to be no adequate explanation for this phenomenon# 
In this paper an attempt will be made to show 
whether there is any relationship between the leucocyte con¬ 
tent of milk and the methylene blue reduction time# Data 
will be presented relative to the study of relationships 
between the leucocyte content and the bacterial content 
of a number of udder milks* Also the bacteriological con¬ 
dition of milks drawn aseptically from udders which showed 
symptoms of abnormality will be dealt with in this study#

THE LEUCOCYTE CONTENT OF MILK AND 
THE PRESENCE OF CHAINS AND CLUMPS OF BACTERIA 
AS DETERMINED BY 

AN EXTENSIVE MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION 


In this work aseptically drawn milks from 93 
cows were studied* In each case (with two exceptions) 

1,000 fields per smear were examined microscopically* 

With regard to milks Nos* 1 and 2 only 5 and 200 fL elds 
per smear were examined respectively* It will be noted 
that the bacterial counts were high for these milks and 
therefore many bacteria were encountered on examination 
only of a few fields per smear* 

Table VIII contains information on the maximum 
size of chains and clumps encountered in each milk* An ex¬ 
amination of these data shows that 64 (67*3 per cent) of the 
95 milks each contained more than 500,000 leucocytes* The 
remaining 31 ( 32*6 per cent) milks harboured 500,000 or 
less leucocytes per c*c* G lumps or chains of bacteria 
were found in 40 (6l*5 per cent) of the milks containing 
over half a million leucocytes, while on the other hand in 
only 8 ( 25»8 per cent) of the 31 milks each containing less 
than 500,000 leucocytes were clumps or chains of bacteria 
found* It should also be noted that in 20 (21*0 per cent) 
of all the milks studied only single cocci were observed, 
and in 2? (28*4 per cent) both single cocci and diplocoCci 
were observed. Therefore, in 4? (49*5 per cent) of the 95 
milks studied no clumps or chains larger than two cells

were found, while in the remaining 48 (30*3 per cent) milks 
clumps or chains were observed. 

Of the 64 milks containing over half a million 
leucocytes per c.c., 2? (43*3 per cent) were found to har¬ 
bour longchain streptococci when 1,000 fields per smear 
were searched. When we compare these results with the 
results reported in ^able XY where of the 80 milks con¬ 
taining over half a million leucocytes per c.c., 16 (20.0 
per cent) were found to harbour longchain streptococci as 
determined by the microscopic examination of 60 fields per 
smear, we find that these results show quite conclusively 
that by a microscopic examination of 1,000 fields per smear 
it is possible to detect the presence of longchain streptococci 
in milk far more accurately than by an examination of only 
o0 fields per smear. 

It should also be noted that of the 48 milks In 
whi©h clumps or chains of bacteria were found, J2 (66.6 per 
cent) reduced methylene blue in less than 10:00 by the stan¬ 
dard technique. On the other hand of the 40 milks which 
gave standard reduction times of less than 10:00 only 8 
(20.0 per cent) did not contain clumps or chains of bac¬ 
teria. The leucocyte content of these 8 milks varied 
from 180,000 to 13,960,000 per c.c. and the microscopic 
counts of bacteria varied from 6,000 to 31,000 per c.c. 

It seems evident here that in some of these milks there 
were insufficient bacteria and leucocytes to account for 
the respective reduction times. 


No rod shaped bacteria were obsei^d in any of the

udder milks reported in Table VIII* 

These data show that there is a greater tendency 
for clumping of bacteria in milks containing large numbers 
of leucocytes than is the case with milks harbouring less 
than .500,000 leucocytes per c*c* Most of the large groups 
of bacteria observed were in the form of longchain strepto- 
cocci* This therefore seems to be in conformity with the 
findings of other workers who report a relationship between 
the appearance of large numbers of leucocytes in milk and 
the incidence of udder infections* 


THE LEUCOCITE MV BACTERIAL COURTS 
0E MILK 


The major part of the work reported in the liter® 
ature on this subject is based on the bacterial counts 
obtained by the cultural plate method, while practically 
no attempt has been made to correlate the leucocyte counts 
with the bacterial counts obtained by the direct microscopic 
method* 

Cherrington, et* al* (1933) report plate counts 
of milk using two kinds of media, namely plain agar and 
blood agar* Their results on milk from healthy cows show 
an average plate count of 1,000 on plain agar and an average

of 1,600 on blood agar. The leucocyte counts of these 
milks varied from 20,000 to 132 , 000 ® The milks from dis¬ 
eased cows showed bacterial averages of 13,000 and 40,000 
on plain agar and blood agar respectively. The leucocyte 
contents of these milks varied from 21,000 to 13,640,000 
per c.c®. 

Copeland and Olsen (1926) reported bacterial plate 
counts and leucocyte counts of milk from 40 cows® Their 
report reveals that in cases where leucocyte contents are 
over one million, the bacterial counts are usually high. An 
average plate count of 3*40? for such milks was reported by 
these workers® 

Baker and Breed (1320) found that milks c out ail¬ 
ing large numbers of leucocytes usually though" not invar¬ 
iably contain streptococci* Tk ese workers, ho?/ever, did 
not report the relationship of bacterial to leucocyte counts 
on a quantitative basis. 

Breed (1929) states that numbers of leucocytes 
in milk may also be influenced by physiological disturbances 
in the milk secretion having no connection whatever with 
bacterial infection® 

The work reviewed above is indicative of some 
relationship between the leucocyte contents and the bacterial 
contents of milk.

the logarithms of leucocyte counts, and the logarithms 
of bacterial counts obtained by the direct microscopic 
examination of 1,000 fields per smear of each milk* It 
will be noted that the reduction times beyond 1^:00 are not 
recorded in figure I* In plotting this graph the milks 
were arranged in the order of increasing bacterial counts* 
For this reason the bacterial count curve is fairly smooth 
while the other two curves are comparatively irregular. 

This should, therefore, be kept in mind when examining and 
comparing the three curves. 

An examination of the logarithmic curves of leu¬ 
cocyte counts and bacterial counts shows some degree of 
relationship between the two curves, •‘•here is a general 
rise in the leucocyte count curve with the rise of the 
bacterial count curve. This relationship is quite apparent 
throughout the whole lengths of these curves. 

In view of the work reported in the first section 
of this paper, we may reasonably expect these microscopic 
counts to be closer to the real or actual bacterial contents 
of these milks than the counis obtained by the plate method, 
and consequently the above relationship between bacterial 
and leucocyte counts may presumably be of greater signif¬ 
icance than that which may be obtained when using plate 
counts for the same purpose* 

It will be noted that there are fewer milks con¬ 
taining leucocytes in excess of 500,000 towards the lower

end of the bacterial count curve. While on the other hand 
towards the high end of this curve the majority of milks 
contained more than 300,000 leucocytes per c.c,. The 
average bacterial count for milks containing less than 300,000 
leucocytes was 23,600 bacteria per c,c, f while the average 
for milks containing more than 300,000 leucocytes was 231,330 
per c.c, The average bacterial count for milk containing 
more than one million leucocytes was 216 , 636 . The last 
milk in figure I which is milk No. 1 in Table VIII was 
omitted from these computations as this milk appeared very

METHYLENE BLUE REDUCTION TIMES 

A considerable amount of work has been reported 
on the relationship of the plate counts to the methylene 
blue reduction times of milk. The literature shows that 
those reporting on this type of work were not able to find 
any close relationship between the results given by these 
two bacteriological methods. When we consider the fundamental 
principles involved in the two methods, we may expect no 
close relationship between the results given by these methods. 
On the other hand, very little work has been 
reported on the relationship between the direct microscopic 
counts of bacteria in milk and the methylene blue reduction

Troy (192j?) reported on the comparison of the 

methylene blue reduction test and the direct microscopic 
milk 

counts in grading/in milk plants® This worker reported 
a correlation of 86*2 per cent with regard to their ability 
to place milk into the same grades® The correlation re¬ 
ported by this worker appears to be closer than might be 
expected for the class of milk he studied® However, similar 
results need not necessarily be expected in the study of 
udder milks. 

In examining the bacterial count and the methylene 
blue reduction time curves in Figure I and also the date in 
Table VIII, we find that there is some relationship between 
the bacterial counts and the reduction times of these milks. 

There is a distinct rise in the reduction time curve with 
the rise of the bacterial count curve. A greater proportion 
of the milks with standard reduction times of less than 10:00 
are to be found towards the high end of the bacterial count 
curve. There is, however, one significant thing that should 
be noted with regard to the curves in Figure I: this is the 
occurrence of milks with short reduction times and relatively 
low bacterial and leucocyte contents. Milks also appear 
which show the opposite results, namely, high bacterial 
counts and fairly long reduction times. The latter condition 
was probably due to slow rate of bacterial multiplication 
during the period when the tests were inehbated in the water bath.

In cases where large numbers of leucocytes are found, one 

may attempt to attribute the short reduction times to the 

% 

action of leucocytes, but where leucocytes are found in 

relatively low numbers such an explanation does not seem 

reasonable. Results of the above nature seem to indicate 

that there may be some factors other than bacteria and' 

leucocytes which may be involved in the reduction of meth- 
blue 

ylene/in milk, primarily where there are insufficient 
bacteria to account for the reduction* 


THE LEUCOCYTE CONTENTS AND THE BACTERIAL 
PLATE COUNTS OE MILK 


On examining the data in Table IX, we find that 
the majority of milks with relatively high plate counts also 
contain large numbers of leucocytes. There are, however, a 
few very apparent exceptions to this rule. The most strik¬ 
ing are the following: milks Nos. 3, 8, 18, 19 and 21. 

Each of these milks contained more than 2,000,000 leucocytes 
and each gave a plate count of less than 1,000. Referring 
to Table VIII, we find that large groups of bacteria were 
found in milks Nos. 3 and 8 when subjected to the extensive 
microscopic examination. This may also have been true of 
the other three milks, but these were not examined similarily. 
It should be noted that of the 92 milks each containing more

than j>00,000 leucocytes, plate counts are reported for only 
65• The average plate count of these 65 milks was 20,448* 
Milk No. 1, which gave a plate count of 7,875,000 was ex¬ 
cluded from this average. The average plate count for milks 
containing 500,000 or less leucocytes per c.c. was 1,041. 
These averages are probably significant in spite of the fact 
that the plate counts varied from 5 to 511,000 for the former 
class of milks and from 25 to 17,500 for the latter class. 

We may therefore conclude on the basis of these averages 
that the plate counts are generally much higher for milks 
that are high in leucocyte contents than for milks contain¬ 
ing relatively low numbers of leucocytes. 


TEE PLATE COUNTS AND THE METHYLENE BLUE 
REDUCTION TIMES OF UDDER MILE 


The bacterial plate counts and the methylene 
blue reduction times of herd milks have been discussed in 
the first section of this paper, and a conclusion was 
reached, that no close relationship exists between plate 
counts and reduction times of such milks. Data in Table 
IX deal with a number of udder milks. These data show that 
there is a general relationship between the plate counts and 
the reduction ti .es of these milks. Many of the milks show ing 
high plate counts also show short reduction times. There

are, however, a large number of striking exceptions of 
which the following are the most outstanding, namely, 
milks Nos. 3, 3, 66 and 8l. All these milks gave short 
reduction times and showed low plate counts. Referring to 
Table VIII, we find that only small clumps of bacteria 
were found in milks Nos. 3 and 66, while no chains or 
clumps were observed in milks Nos. 3 and 8l. It should be 
noted that these results differ from those reported in Table 
III and discussed in the first section of this paper. The 
results reported in Table III show that large groups of 
bacteria were present in all of the herd milks whieh gave 
short reduction times and low plate counts. 

Data in Table IX also show a number of milks 
with relatively high plate.counts and long reduction times. 
The following seem to be good examples of such milks i 
milks Nos. 22, 39, 114, 123 and 142, 

On the basis of these data we may conclude that 
there is only a general relationship between the plate 
counts and the methylene blue reduction times, but, there 
are also milks which show a negative relationship. An 
explanation for this negative relationship is likely seated 
in a combination of factors which tend to influence both 
of these bacteriological tests. Some of these factors are 
known to us at the present time, but there may be others 
which have not yet come to light. It is possible that there 
may be certain unknown factors that may affect the reduction 
time, particularly in the case of milks that come from in¬

THE LEUCOCYTE COUNTS AND THE 
METHYLENE BLUE REDUCTION TIMES OF MILK 


The behavior of leucocytes with respect to 
the methylene blue reduction test of milk has not been 
studied as extensively as some of the other factors which 
influence this test* The reason that this has not been 
thoroughly investigated is likely due to the fact that 
many workers in the past were not inclined to attribute 
much importance to leucocytes and their action on the re¬ 
duction time in practical milk control work, 

Skar {1913} seems to have been the first to study 
this subject and as a result of his studies he concluded that 
leucocytes in milk have the power of reducing methylene blue, 
Barthel (191?) found that milk from a single 
animal can become decolorized in say 1:00 because of high 
leucocyte content in the secretion from one or more of the 
glands. He was not, however, inclined to attribute to 
their action a great importance in practical milk control# 
Skar (1931) again brought attention to the im¬ 
portance of leucocytes in the reduction test. Here he men¬ 
tions the prevalence of infected herds in Norway where short 
reduction times of milk from individual animals are obtain¬ 
able, but in these same areas the stable inspectors very 
seldom report quick reduction of the mixed milk from such 
herds, because of udder contamination. This worker states

that leucocytes in the numbers of roughly 6,700,000 per 
c.c. can not reduce the dye in milk if the test tubes stand 
still, but will reduce when the test tubes are turned over 
periodically, so that creaming is prevented. He attributes 
this condition to the fact that leucocytes go into the cream 
layer before the milk has decolorised. Creaming is, there¬ 
fore, prevented by a periodic shaking of the samples during 
incubation, and thus allowing the leucocytes to decolorize 
the dye. 

While the literature presents some fairly con¬ 
clusive evidence that living cells including leucocytes 
have a reducing power, yet proof as to what extent the leu¬ 
cocytes found in milk reduce the dye awaits further investi¬ 
gation. In the discussion that will follow, an attempt will 
bemade to bring out experimental evidence which may seem to 
support the contentions of those who have concluded that 
leucocytes in milk have a reducing power. However, very 
important evidence will be presented which will show that 
leucocytes are likely not causing the reduction themselves, 
but that there may be certain other substances associated 
primarily with abnormal milks which actually cause reduction 
of the methylene blue* 

An examination of data reported in Table IX shows a 
few significant conditions. The first of these is a rather 
close relationship between the leucocyte counts and both the 
standard and modified reduction times. This relationship is

also shown by the graph in Figure I. Tn the majority of 
instances, leucocyte count and reduction time curves rise 
and fall simultaneously. This, therefore, seems to show 
that there may be a closer relationship between leucocyte 
counts and methylene blue reduction times, than between 
bacterial counts (microscopic) and reduction times, A 
further analysis of the data in Table VIII shows that of 
the 64 milks containing leucocytes in excess of 500,000 per 
c*c., 38 (39*57 per cent) gave standard reduction times of 
less than 10:00; while of the 31 milks, each containing less 
than 500,000 leucocytes per c.c», only 2 (6.45 per cent) 
reduced the dye in less than 10:00. It should also be noted 
that of the 40 milks where chains or clumps of bacteria and 
leucocytes in excess of 500,000 per c.c, were found, only 
9 (22,5 per cent) did not reduce the dye in less than 10:00# 
In only one of the two milks containing less than 500,000 
leucocytes per c.c., and giving reduction times of less than 
10:00, were lerge groups of bacteria observed# 

Data in Table IX show that of the 57 milks which 
contained leucocytes in excess of 1,000,000 per c.c#, 35 
(61.4 per cent) gave standard reduction times of less than 
10:00. If we group these milks by using 500,000 leucocytes 
per c.c., as a dividing line between the two groups, then we 
find that of the 92 milks containing leucocytes in excess 
of 500,000 per c.c., 43 (46.7 per cent) were decolorized in 
less than 10:00. While of the 71 milks containing 500,000 
or less leucocytes per c.c#, 2 (2.8 per cent) gave reduction

times of less than 10:00. The 2 milks referred to are 
milks Nos. 136 and 1.50. Milk No. 136 showed a leucocyte 
count of 180,000 and a standard reduction time of 6:4.5. 

This milk showed a bacterial count of 6,000 when 1,000 
fields per smear were examined microscopically. These 
results, therefore, show clearly that there were insuffic¬ 
ient bacteria and leucocytes present to account for the 
short reduction time. In the case of milk No. 1.50, the 
reduction time of 92JO seems to be accounted for by the 
bacterial count of 43,200 when 1,000 fields per sirear were 
searched. Table Vm seems to &ow that milks Nos. 48, J2, 
65, 75, 8l, 82, 136 and 158 all contained insufficient 
bacteria and leucocytes to account for their reduction 
times, -dll these cases show evidence of the existence in 
milk of some substance other than leucocytes and bacteria 
which was capable of reducing the dye in the reduction test. 

It will be noted that there is a close relation¬ 
ship between the standard and modified reduction times. 

This relationship seems to be maintained with milks that 
are high in leucocyte contents and also with milks contain¬ 
ing relatively low numbers of leucocytes. The following are 
some of the exceptions to the above rule: in the case of 
milks Nos. 26 and 66, the standard reduction times were con¬ 
siderably shorter than the modified times. Such a condition 
may be expected in case of short time reducing milks where 
the introduction of extra oxygen a s a result of periodic

shaking of the tubes is a greater factor than the preven¬ 
tion of the rise of bacteria with creaming* Conditions 
of the above nature are uncommon with long reducing normal 
milks# When such results are obtained with short reducing 
milks, the difference between the two reduction times has 
been found to be in no case as great as it is reported for 
the two milks mentioned above* The other exceptions are 
milks N 0 s# 60 and 68# With these milks the modified reduc¬ 
tion times were short while the standard times were rela¬ 
tively long* This condition seems to support Skar ! s (1931) 
statement with regard to milks high in leucocyte content* 
However, both of these milks contained less than i f 0QG,000 
leucocytes per c.c., therefore leucocytes apparently did not 
account for the reductions. The explanation for these 
differences between standard and modified reduction times 
seems to centre around the bacterial contents of these milks. 
Referring to Table Vm we find that large groups of bac¬ 
teria were found in both of these milks# Both milks showed 
high microscopic counts of bacteria and considerably lower 
plate counts* These rather great differences between the 
plate counts and the microscopic counts confirm the findings 
of large groups of bacteria# Therefore, it seems that 
these differences between standard and modified reduction 
times were due entirely to the sweeping up of bacterial 
groups (Thornton (1930)) in creaming and thus preventing 
uniform reduction of the dye in the unshaken tubes#

Since these data show a fairly close relation¬ 
ship between standard and modified reduction times, and 
since the differences between these times appear small 
with short time reducing milks and greater with long time 
reducing milks, it appears as though the sweeping up of 
leucocytes with the cream in the standard technique had no 
bearing upon the reduction times of these milks* This con¬ 
clusion is based on the fact that the correlation between 
standard and modified reduction times was found to be fairly 
close in spite of the great diversity between the leucocyte 
contents of the milks studied. Therefore, these date show 
different results from those reported by Skar (1931)* 

Skar f s conclusion that leucocytes in numbers of about 
6 ,700,000 per c.c® are not able to reduce the dye when the 
tubes are not shaken does not seem to hold here* It may 
be stated that Skar»s conclusion seems logical if the 
leucocytes have reducing properties* If this is the case 
there is no reason that the creaming effect should not have 
the same influence upon leucocytes as it has with respect 
to bacteria* The sweeping of leucocytes and bacteria in 
the standard methylene blue reduction test has been fairly 
well proven by many workers who have studied this problem, 
therefore in considering our data we may safely accept the 
fact that leucocytes are swept up with the cream in the 
unshaken tubes. If we accept this to be the case while 
analysing our data and find no marked difference between

standard and modified reduction times of milks relatively 
high in leucocyte contents, we may reasonably conclude 
that leucocytes in milk appear to have no power of reducing 
the dye in the reduction test. 

toother point which is worth noting with respect 
to these data is the significant fact that milks No$,l8 
19, 20, 21, 22, 24 and 27 each contained leucocytes in ex¬ 
cess of 2 million per c,c» and none of these milks reduced 
the dye in less than 12s00 in the standard technique. Con¬ 
trasting these milks with milks Nos, 65, 66, 75, 8l and 1^6, 
which in each case harboured less than 900,000 leucocytes 
per c,c. and reduced the dye in less than 7;00, we find 
additional evidence here that leucocytes in milk play no 
part in the reduction of methylene blue. 


LEUCOCYTE COUNTS AND THE INITIAL BACTERIAL 
COUNTS CORRELATED WITH THE BACTERIAL 
COUNTS OF MILK AT THE MOMENT OF 
REDUCTION OF THE METHYLENE 
BLUE 


Yery little work has been reported on the bacterial 
content of milk at the moment of reduction of the methylene 
blue, Thornton and Hastings (1929) produced some important 
data on this subject. They used the plate method in making 
the determinations and reported an average plate count of

approximately 21 million and a variation of from 3.3 million 
to 43 million per c.e. of milk at the moment of reduction. 

Skar (1913) reported data on 4 samples of milk, 

2 of which contained 3>°09*0G0 and 6,706,000 leucocytes per c 9 c, 
respectively. The first sample he reports had a reduction 
time of less than 12:00 and the second decolorized the dye 
in 8:00 to 9:00. Skar reports that both of these samples 
were examined microscopically after 23:00 standing in the 
thermostat and very few bacteria were found in the first and 
almost no bacteria appeared in the second sample after this 
incubation period. On the basis of these results, this 
worker attributed the reduction in each of these milks 
to the action of leucocytes,* 

While Skar*s work appears quite significant, it 
may not have been extensive enough to justify his conclusions 
as the results reported were on the analysis of milk from 
only one cow. However, he reported that his conclusions were 
based on experiments of similar nature on other milks not 
included in his data. 

The work undertaken in this study was along some- 
what similar lines to that reported by Skar, except that 
a larger number of milks was studied and an extensive 
microscopic method was employed in the examination of milk 
smears. The milks that were chosen for this study con¬ 
tained varying numbers of leucocytes a These milks were 
subjected to thorough microscopic examinations immediately

after they were drawn from the udders, and also upon re¬ 
duction of the dye. The reason for these thorough micros¬ 
copic examinations was to find out whether these milks 
contained more bacteria than the plate method and the 

ordinary (60 fields per smear) microscopic examination, 

that 

seemed to show. It is believed/a microscopic examination 
of 1,000 to 2,000 fields per smear is more accurate 
than an examination of say 10 to 60 fields per smear. In 
analysing Skar’s data, it was thought that more bacteria 
may have been present than he observed. He may have failed 
to observe these when examining only a few fields per smear. 

An examination of data in Table X shows some 
striking results. We note a number of milks which were 
high in leucocyte contents and had short reduction tines 
and also contained relatively few bacteria at the moment 
of reduction. These data seem to show that there were in¬ 
sufficient bacteria in milks Nos. 3, 4, 3, 7* 8 , 10, 12, 13, 
16 , 26 , 66 and 8 l to account for the reduction of the dye 
in the times reported for these milks. By checking the 
leucocyte contents of these milks, one ma j be lead to 
conclude that leucocytes must have caused these short re¬ 
duction times. However, two of these milks, namely Nos. 

8 l and 66 contained relatively few leucocytes as compared 
with the leucocyte contents of the other 10 milks. Here 
it appears that there were insufficient leucocytes (if 
leucocytes have a reducing power) and bacteria to account 
for the short reduction times. Both of these milks must be

considered as abnormal, since both were obtained from cows 
two days after parturition* On the basis of high leucocyte 
counts, short methylene blue reduction times, and the history 
of these milks, we may class all of the 12 milks as abnormal* 
Therefore, since all of these abnormal milks gave short 
standard reduction times, and all contained insufficient 
bacteria to account for the short reduction times, and since 
at least two of these milks were relatively low in leucocyte 
content, it appears that there were factors other than the 
leucocytes and bacteria which caused the short reduction 
times of the 12 milks, and that leucocytes pla3red little 
or no part in the reduction of the dye* 

It seems reasonable to suppose that there may be 
some unknown reducing substance in milk, which probably occurs 
in an increasing concentration in milks which show greater 
tendencies towards abnormality* This field, however, re¬ 
quired further investigation before we may definitely ascribe 
the short reduction times to any unknown substance in the 
types of milks reported in this study. The results of 
this study lead us to the consiusion that leucocytes in 
milk are not as important in causing reduction of the dye 
in the reduction test as has been supposed by some of the 
investigators. Furthermore, these data seem to indicate 
that milks obtained from abnormal udders reduce the dye in 
a short time, irrespective of their leucocyte or bacterial 
contents. This, therefore, leads one to believe that 
certain milks appear to contain a reducing substance (or

substances) which probably occurs in an increasing concen¬ 
tration in milks exhibiting higher degrees of abnormality* 

A rather unusual condition will be observed in 
connection with the reduction times of milks Nos, 26 and 66. 
In both cases the modified reduction times were of longer 
duration than the standard times. It appears that the sub¬ 
stances which caused reduction in the unshaken tubes was 
not able to reduce the dye in the shaken tubes* However, 
partial reductions in the shaken tubes were observed prior 
to each shaking but upon shaking the tubes every half hour 
these partial reductions would disappear* This seems to show 
that the reducing substance must have had the power of re¬ 
ducing the dye but this power was not sufficient to cause 
complete reduction of the methylene blue during the course 
of the half hour period while the tubes remained at rest. We 
may now ask what caused the reduction in the respective times 
reported for the shaken tubes of these two milks* The answer 
is quite obvious that these reductions were caused by the 
bacterial activity, as the bacterial counts at the moment 
of reduction were 64,200,000 for milk No* 26 and 127,200,000 
for milk No. 66. These results, therefore, show that 
bacteria were responsible for the modified reduction times 
but some other factor or factors were responsible for the 
reductions in the unshaken tubes. 

It is also evident that neither leucocytes nor 
bacteria were responsible for reduction of the dye in the

standard tubes of milks Nos. 66 and 8l, as the leucocyte 
contents were relatively low in both of these milks and 
insufficient bacteria to account for these reductions 
were observed in the smears made at the moment of reduction 
of the dye. 

We should note that milks Nos. 27, 33, 33, 4-3, 

30, 33, 33, and 36 each contained more than 1,000,000 
leucocytes and none reduced the methylene blue in less than 
9:00 in the standard technique. In the case of all these 
milks, there were enough bacteria found at the moment of 
reduction to account for their reduction times. This, 
therefore seems to furnish conclusive evidence that leucocytes 
did not cause reduction of the dye in these particular 
milks. It appears that these milks while relatively high 
in leucocyte contents were possibly less potent in the re¬ 
ducing substance which is believed to occur in many abnormal 
milks. It is probable that these particular milks were 
normal in all respects except that the leucocj^te contents 
were relatively high. As the result of these conditions, 
it seems that reduction in these milks was not possible 
unless accounted for by the bacterial activity. 

When we exclude those milks which appear to have 
contained insufficient bacteria to account for the reduction 
of the dye and only consider the milks which contained enough 
bacteria to account for the decolonization, we find the 
bacterial counts at the moment of reduction to be fairly

uniform. While these counts varied from 67,800,000 to 
283,600,000, nevertheless they seem to he as uniform as 
may he expected. After all these are really estimates 
rather than actual counts* The average bacterial count 
at the moment of reduction for these 34 milks was 134 , 723 , 329 , 
which is considerably higher than the average plate count of 
milk at the moment of reduction obtained by Thornton and 
Hastings ( 1929 )* The average bacterial count for the 12 
milks which contained insufficient bacteria to account for 
their reduction times was 228,808. 

In connection with milks Nos. 3, 3 , 7 , 8, 10 
and 13, a decrease in the numbers of bacteria at the moment 
of reduction was noted. In these 6 milks there were actually 
fewer bacteria found in the smears made at the moment of 
reduction than in the smears made before the milks were 
placed in the water bath. These decreases in the bacterial 
counts as reported here may have been due to the inaccuracy 
of the method of counting or to the phagocytic action of 
leucocytes upon the bacteria. 

Incubation was continued in case of milks Nos. 

3, 3, 7, 8, 13, 26, 66, and 8l and results are shown in 
Table XI. An of these milks were incubated in the water 
bath for a period of 8:00 including the time before the 
milks were reduced. In each case a smear was made at the 
moment of reduction and then the test tube was again returned 
to the bath where it remained until a total incubation 
period of 8:00 was reached. When this period was reached

another smear was prepared from each milk, therefore the 
counts reported in Table XI are representative of the smears 
made efter the 8:00 incubation period. 

An examination of the data in Table XI shows that 
ohly one milk actually contained large numbers of bacteria: 
however, this same milk did not show enough bacteria to 
account for its reduction time of 0:55 (Table X). 

Comparing the initial bacterial count, the bac¬ 
terial count at the moment of reduction (Table X) and the 
bacterial count after the prolonged incubation (Table XI) 
for milk No. 15 , we note that there is very little difference 
between these counts® In fact the count obtained after the 
extended incubation period was numerically lower than the 
initial bacterial count of this milk. This, therefore, seems 
conclusive evidence that there were factors which tended to 
prevent bacterial multiplication or which destroyed the 
bacteria present in these milks-under the conditions of the 
methylene blue reduction test. 

The plate counts of milks Nos. 8, 66, and 8l are 
reported in Table XI. These milks were plated after the 
8:00 incubation period, i.e., during the same period when 
Breed smears were prepared. These plate counts are in all 
cases lower than the corresponding microscopic counts. They 
also show that there were insufficient bacteria present to 
account for the recorded reduction times. Comparing these 
plate counts with the initial plate counts reported in Table 
X, we find a great increase in the numbers of bacteria during

the incubation period, while the corresponding microscopic 
counts of these milks do not show any such high percentage 
of increase during the same period. This may possibly be 
explained by the fact that while shaking the tubes large 
groups of bacteria were broken up and clumping may have 
been prevented© 

These figures serve as further evidence that there 
were insufficient bacteria present in these 8 milks to account 
for the respective reduction times© 

It was observed that certain decolorized milks 
when the tubes were shaken and again replaced in the water 
bath did not decolorize again within a few minutes as would 
be expected, and as is the ease with milks which^are reduced 
due to bacterial activity. These observations have been 
made in connection with milks Nos, 8, 66 and 8l, These 
milks were thoroughly shaken after the 8:00 incubation in 
the bath and the original blue color reappeared. The test 
tubes were again returned to the bath and observations for 
reduction were made every half hour. The tubes received no 
further agitation. Milk No, 8 was reduced in 2 : 1.5 (this is 
comparable with the first reduction time of 2:10), while 
milks Nos, 66 and 8l were not decolorized when they were 
last examined 3*00 after the tubes were shaken. 

In view of these results, it appears that there is 
justification for a further investigation of this problem. 

This seems necessary before we can explain the results men¬

BOVINE AND RABBIT BLOOD LEUCOCYTES 
ADDED TO MILK AND THEIR EFFECT ON 
THE METHYLENE BLUE REDUCTION TIME 
OF MILK 


Data which we have so far presented dealt only 
with the role of the milk borne leucocytes in the reduction 
of methylene blue in milk, ^he results of this study have 
lead the author to the conclusion that leucocytes found in 
milk appear to have no effect on the reduction of methylene 
blue in milk* However, before definitely concluding that 
leucocytes have no reducing properties in milk, it seemed 
desirable to study the effect of adding Bovine and Rabbit 
blood leucocytes to milk. 

Since a search through the literature did not un¬ 
cover any work on the action of blood borne leucocytes in 
milk on the reduction of methylene blue, it is therefore 
impossible to present any review on this phase of the subject* 
However, Gay and Oram (1 933 ) deal with the action of Rabbit, 
Dog and Guinea Pig leucocytes on methylene blue in broth. 

These workers studied the effect on leucocytes of a substance 
named Streptococcus leucocidin , and found that this substance 
caused the disintegration of leucocytes, and as aresult of 
this the leucocytes lost their reducing properties. St. leu¬ 
cocidin is produced as a metabolic product of certain bac¬ 
teria, notably of the Streptococcus and Staphylococcus types. 
This product is claimed to exercise a fatal effect on the 
protective leucocytes not by repelling them but by destroy-

ing them after the micro organisms have become incorpor¬ 
ated in the leucocyte. These workers used methylene blue 
as an indicator of living cells. The data submitted in 
these investigations show clearly that leucocytes suspended 
in broth are definitely capable of reducing methylene blue. 
The table below reproduced from Gay and Oram (1933) illus¬ 
trates the above contention very clearly;

by repeated centrifugalizations, decantations and wash¬ 
ings with sterile saline until finally a clear suspension 
of approximately 500 million cells per c.c. was obtained* 

This leucocyte suspension was added to fresh udder milk 
according to the proportions outlined in Table XII* 

The Rabbit blood leucocytes were obtained from 
the peritoneal cavity by introducing physiologic saline 
solution therein* A bout 200 c.c. of saline were intro¬ 
duced into the peritoneal cavity early in the morning and 
100 c.c. late in the afternoon; three hours later about 
200 c.c. of exudate were obtained by aspiration. By centri¬ 
fugal! zing , decanting and adding fresh saline, a smaller 
volume was obtained which contained approximately 10 million 
leucocjrtes per c.c.. This suspension was immediately added 
to fresh udder milk according to the proportions outlined 
in Table XIII. 

A careful analysis of data reported in Tables XII 
and XIII shows quite conclusively that the leucocytes which 
were added to these samples of milk exhibited no measurable 
effect on the methylene blue reduction times of these milks* 
There may have been a possibility that these leucocytes 
lost their reducing power immediately after they were intro¬ 
duced into the milk. This seems to be borne out by the fact 
that these cells appeared to be in a disintegrated condition 
in the smears that were prepared from the milk samples 
immediately following the addition of the leucocyte suspension 
to the milk. The majority of the cells appeared as skeletons

and did not stain properly* This condition was more pro¬ 
nounced in connection with Bovine leucocytes than was the 
case with respect to Rabbit leucocytes. It is rather dif¬ 
ficult to explain these disintegrations when the leucocytes 

dis- 

were introduced into the milks such/integration was, however, 
not observed in the smears that were made from the leucocyte 
suspensions prior to their addition to milk® 

Data reported in Tables XII and XIII show clearly 
that the addition of varying numbers of blood leucocytes to 
samples of milk caused no measurable change in the reduction 
times of these milks® The microscopic examinations of smears 
made at the moment of reduction serve as further proof that 
leucocytes played no part in the reductions of methylene 
blue in these milks. In every smear examined microscopically 
enough bacteria were present at the moment of reduction to 
account for the respective reduction times® 

On the basis of these data, we may conclude that 
both Bovine and Rabbit blood leucocytes when introduced 
into aseptically drawn milk have no measurable effect on 
the reduction of methylene blue in milk® Incidentally, 
this study, therefore, further confirms the conclusions 
made with respect to the role of milk borne leucocytes 
in the reduction of methylene blue in milk®

THE INCIDENCE OF MASTITIS 


AMONG THE COWS IN THE EDMONTON MILK SHED 



-61- 


IHTRODUCTION 


In connection with the studies reported in the 
first two parts of this thesis, data are available which 
permit some comment on the incidence of mastitis among the 
cows in this district* 

Within the last few years, a great deal of work 
has been reported on mastitis among the cows in various 
parts of the continent, Valuable data have been collected 
on all phases of this malady. Some of the most outstanding 
work has been reported by the following research workers; 
Hucker, et. al. (1932), Hucker (1933* 1933), Hucker andl.ee 
(1932), Resell (1933) Hucker and Tidal1 (1933) and Cherring- 
ton et. al (1933)» ^he reader is referred to these papers 
for information on this subject which can not be given here. 
Most of the workers have definitely associated 
the excessive leucocyte content of milk with infections 
of the udder. There still is, however, a great deal of con¬ 
troversy among the different workers as to what leucocyte 
content of milk should be taken as a dividing line between 
normal and abnormal milk, 

Hucker (1933) states that cows producing milk con¬ 
taining more than 130,000 leucocytes per c.c, show past or 
present histories of mastitis. This worker further states 
that milk with a leucocyte count of 300,000 almost invariably 
comes from an infected udder, 

Cherrington, et, al, (1933) state that milks with

leucocyte contents of over 100,000 per c.c. almost invar¬ 
iably come from abnormal udders. 

In reviewing the contentions of the different 
workers, one appreciates that it is a difficult task to 
set a leucocyte standard for normal milk. However, since 
most of the authorities are in agreement that a leucocyte 
content of 500,000 per c.c® in milk is indicative of 
abnormality of the udder, it seems safe to take this figure 
as an arbitrary line of demarcation between normal and 
abnormal milk. Therefore, in the discussions in this paper, 
cows producing milk with leucocyte content of over 500,000 
per c.c# will be considered abnormal or suffering from mas¬ 


titis

THE LEUCOCYTE COUNTS OF MILK 
DRAWN FROM I 63 UDDERS 


The leucocytes from the standpoint of their 
quantitative content in milk have been studied rather ex¬ 
tensively. The literature reveals that there are great 
variations in leucocyte counts of milk from apparently 
normal udders. 

Breed (1914) discussed leucocyte counts of milk 
from 122 apparently normal individual cows® He found an 
average leucocyte content of 868,000 per c®c*® Of the 122 
cows, only 59 gave milk with leucocyte content of less 

than 500>000 per c.c® 

Copeland and Olsen (1926) obtained an average 
leucocyte count of 657,000 for 40 cows® 

Chemngton, et. al® (1953) reported leucocyte 
determinations of milk from 6 normal and 7 abnormal cows* 
These workers reported 144 representative counts of milk 
from the noimal cows, and their data show that 94 per cent 
of these samples contained more than 10,000 leucocytes 
per c.c®; 11 per cent contained more than 50,000, and J 
per cent contained more than 100,000 leucocytes per c.c®. 

Of the 168 counts pertaining to the 7 diseased cows, 99 
per cent showed more than 50,000 leucocytes per c®c*, 9& 
per cent more than 100,000, and 40 per cent contained more 
than 1,000,000 leucocytes per c®c®. These workers conclude 
that milk from normal udders usually contains less than

.50,000 leucocytes per c#c., whereas milk from infected 
udders almost invariably contains more than 100,000 leuco¬ 
cytes per c.c. 

The data presented in Table IX give some idea of 
the extent of leucocytes in milk produced by the cows in 
this district# 

Milks drawn from 163 cows representative of 14 
herds were studied# Of these 163 milks, 15 6 were apparently 
normal, while the remaining 7 milks were classed as abnormal# 
Among these 7 milks, milks Nos# 66 and 8 l were classed 
abnormal because they were drawn from cows 2 days after 
parturition, and the remaining 5 milks were classed abnormal 
due to their yellowish brown appearance and stringy con¬ 
sistency# In this study, the milks that were shipped to 
the distributing plants were considered as apparently nor¬ 
mal, while the milks that were not sold on account of their 
physical appearance were considered abnormal# 

Table IX presents data showing the leucocyte con¬ 
tents of 163 milks# Excluding the 7 abnormal milks, namely 
milks Nos# 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 66 and 8 l, we have left for our 
consideration the 156 apparently normal milks. Upon ex aim¬ 
ing the data pertaining to the normal milks, we find that 
86 ( 55*1 per cent) of the cows produced milk containing 
500,000 or more leucocytes per c.c a # It will he noted 
that only 10 ( 6 #4 per cent) of the cows produced milk with 
leucocyte content of less than 100,000 per c.c## The aver¬ 
age leucocyte content for the 156 milks was 1 , 187,000 per

c.c*, which seems higher than the averages reported by- 
other workers. The highest leucocyte count obtained in 
apparently normal milk was 13,960,000, and the lowest was 
30 , 000 . The milk with the leucocyte count of 13,960,000 
gave a plate count of 1,000 and a microscopic count of 
48,000 bacteria per c.c. when 2,000 fields per smear were 
examined. No longchain streptococci were observed in 
this milk during the course of the microscopic examination. 
The standard meth2^1ene blue reduction time for this milk 
was 1:43* It is therefore apparent that the short reduction 
time and the high leucocyte count appear to indicate that 
this milk was abnormal. This condition, however, was not 
shown by the plate count or by the microscopic examination, 
for bacteria. 

The highest leucocyte count obtained for the ab¬ 
normal milk was 120,000,000. The average for the 3 abnormal 
milks was 30,320,000 leucocytes per c.c.: milks Nos. 66 
and 8l were excluded from this average* 

If one were to apply the arbitrary leucoc 3 rte stan¬ 
dard of 300,000 leucocytes per c.c. as indicative of patho¬ 
logical conditions in the udder, then 33*1 per cent of the 
136 normal cows included in this study would fall into the 
abnormal class. On the other hand, if a leucocyte count of 
100,000 was adopted in this classification, then 93*6 per cent 
of these cows would have to be classed as abnormal or sus¬ 
picious.

It is evident from these data and from the work 
reported by other investigators that in order to set a 
definite leucocyte standard for normal milk, more research 
is required on the significance of leucocytes in milk, and 
on their relationship to specific udder infections# 


THE INCIDENCE OE MASTITIS IN ONE HEED 
OE 27 COWS AS SHOWN BY THE LEUCOCYTE 
CONTENT OE QUARTER MILKS 


Since a leucocyte count of 500,000 has been 
adopted as a dividing line between normal and abnoral 
milk, it was thought desirable that the variations in the 
leucocyte counts of milk from the different quarters of the 
same udder, and of milk drawn at different times during 
the lactation period should be studied* This study* was 
also undertaken with anticipation of securing some inform¬ 
ation on the incidence of mastitis among the cows of a 
single herd, based on the examination of quarter milks# 
Copeland and Olsen (1926) reported leucocyte 
counts in milk from individual quarters of 40 cows and their 
data show great variations in leucocyte counts of milk from 
the different quarters of the same udder# 

Hucker, et# al# (1932) reported individual quar¬ 
ter leucocyte counts of 221 cows which had been condemned 
by the tuberculin test* Their data also show great varia¬ 


tions

Baker and Breed (1920) presented data on leuco¬ 
cytes and epithelial cell counts of individual quarters 
of 21 cows. Their results also show high variations in 
both leucocyte and epithelial cell counts of the different 
quarter samples from the same udder* 

The work reported on the numbers of leucocytes 
in milk drawn at different times during the same period of 
lactation also show that the number of leucocytes secreted 
into the milk vary considerably at different periods. 

Ross (1911) studied the leucocyte contents of 
milk from 3 cows covering a period of 3 to 7 months and found 
in the case of 1 cow a variation of from 21,000 to 272,000 
leucocytes per c.c. and with another coyj which gave a high 
count, the leucocytes varied from 107,000 to 1 , 060 , 000 . This 
worker concludes that the numbers of leucocytes in milk 
from individual cows vary mostly within certain unstated 
limits. 

Cherrington, et* al. (1933) presented data on the 
leucocyte content of milk drawn at 6 different periods from 
6 normal and 7 abnormal cows. Their data also show wide var¬ 
iations. 

Breed (1914) studied the relationship between 
leucocyte counts and the period of lactation, and on the 
basis of the results obtained from 246 tests, he draws the 
following conclusion: 

fl It seems clear that the cell counts of the 
first 3 days of lactation averagemuch higher than 
those of later periods, although usually high

cell counts are seen in almost all of the later 
periods. When the counts are separated into 2 
groups at the 500,000 per c.c. mark, it is found 
that the ratio between the number of counts under 
this mark to the number of counts over this mark 
during the first 6 months of lactation (exclusive 
of counts obtained from colostrm milk) is 100:52. 

The similar ratio, for the counts obtained during 
the second 6 months is 100 : 82 . That is the majority 
of the high cell counts here given occurred during 
the latter part of the lactation period. 11 

Data presented in Table XIY give leucocyte 
counts of individual quarter milks from 27 cows. The samples 
were taken at 5 different periods during the evening milk¬ 
ings. All these cows were in the same herd, and were all 
considered normal by the owner. The time elapsing between 
the first and second sampling periods was 1 day, and between 
the second and third sampling periods, 5 da^rs elapsed. 

An examination of these data reveals that there 
are great variations between the leucocyte counts of milk 
from the different quarters of the same udder. These vari¬ 
ations are of the same nature as those reported by other 
investigators. The wide variations in the leucocyte counts 
of milk from the different quarters of the same udder are 
shown by the figures pertaining to the following cows: Nos. 

1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 19, 16 , 18 , 19, 22, 29, 26, and 27. 

Milk from cow No. 29 gave results that are the most outstanding 
in this respect. 

The figures for the 5 different milking periods 
also show wide variations in spite of the fact that all of 
the samples were drawn within a period of less than 1 week.

The following milks are worth noting with regard to the 
wide variations: namely R.F. milk from cow No. 1 ; R.F. 

No. 8; L.F. No. 15; X.F. No. 18; R.R. and L.H. No. 25; 

L.F. and R.R. No. 26 and L.F. No. 27. 

Of the J 12 quarter milks reported in Table 
XIV, 120 (58*4 per cent) contained more than 500,000 
leucocytes per c.c., and 50 ( 15*6 per cent) contained less 
than 100,000 leucocytes per c.c.. Therefore, if we set 
a leucocyte count of 500,000 as a dividing line between 
normal and abnormal milk, then 120 (58.4 per cent) of these 
quarter milks would be classed as abnormal. 

On the other hand, if we apply the leucocyte count 
of 500,000 as a line of demarcation between normal and ab¬ 
normal milk to the 21 cows, we find that 25 ( 85*1 per cent) 
of these cows would be classed as producers of abnormal milk 
from 1 or all quarters during 1 or all of the 5 sampling 
periods. 

This analysis, while only arbitrary, seems to show 
that mastitis is undoubtedly a very important economic factor 
in this herd. On the basis of the arbitrary standard adopted 
in this study, we may conclude that the evidence of mastitis 
among the cows in this herd appears to be much higher than 
would generally be anticipated.

THE INCIDENCE OF MASTITIS AMONG 
THE COWS IN 13 HEEDS 


Data in Table XV are representative of 14? cows 
from 13 Herds in this district* The figures representing 
the number of cows within the herd do not in all cases 
signify the total number of cows in the herd* In herds 
Nos* 3, 6, 12 and 13, all the milking cows were studied, 
while the cows reported on from the other ? herds were 
selected at random and these may not necessarily be repres¬ 
entative of the entire herd in each case* Another point 
which should be considered is the fact that the herds re¬ 
ported upon were selected from among those that were managed 
by herdsmen who were having some difficulty in producing 
milk that would stand up to the standard set by the City*s 
Health Department* The standard referred to is based on 
the methylene blue reduction test* All milks giving standard 
reduction times of less than 3:30 are rejected. W 0 rk 
reported by Thornton, et. al, (1934) on the sources of milk 
contamination in this distrct shows that the difficulty in 
producing milk which would stand up to this standard did 
not centre in the herd itself but in the methods of production 
and handling of milk* The utensils were found to be the main 
source of milk contamination* There was, however, one pos¬ 
sible exception, and this was in connection with herd No. 6 
{Table XV). During the survey on this farm, mixed herd milk

produced in bacteriologically sterile utensils gave a 
standard reduction time of .5:45* We note (Table XV) 
that a rather high percentage of the cows in this herd 
showed symptoms of infection, This particular herd was 
managed in a very unsatisfactory manner, and in this 
respect was not by any means representative of the average 
herd in this distrct® 

Data reported in Table XV classify the milk from 
14? cows representative of the 13 herds* An examination 
of these data shows that 80 (33»7 per cent) of the cows with 
in the 13 herds produced milk containing more than 300,000 
leucocytes per c.c* These data, therefore, show that 33*7 
per cent of the cows among the 13 herds showed symptoms 
of mastitis when their milk was classified on the basis of 
the leucocyte standard adopted in this study. The results 
obtained are comparable with those reported on the incidence 
of mastitis among the herds in other parts of this continent 
This disease undoubtedly is of a pronounced economic signif¬ 
icance to the dairymen in the Edmonton district, and it 
seems that studies, of the best methods of its diagnosis and 
treatment, are well justified.

MASTITIS MILK IN RELATION TO THE 
BACTERIOLOGICAL QUALITY OE 
MIXED HERD MILK 


Reference has already been made to Skar’e (1931) 
work where he states that short reduction times of milk 
from individual animals are obtainable because of udder 
contamination, but on the otherbsnd it is very seldom that 
short reduction times of mixed milk from such herds are re¬ 
ported where the reducU on is attributed to udder contamin¬ 
ation. 

The work by Thornton, et. al. (1934) shows that 
the prevalence of mastitis in the herd may but very rarely 
reveal itself in the reduction test of the mixed herd milk. 

The work reported in Table XVI covers a study of 
7 herds® The number of cows in each herd that show symptoms 
of mastitis are reported in percentage of the total number of 
milking cows within the respective herd. In segregating the 
cows showing symptoms of mastitis from the healthy ones, the 
same arbitrary standard was used here as is outlined in 
Table XV. In the case of each herd, the cows were milked 
in sterile utensils and in producer’s own utensils which

On examination of the data in Table XVI, we note 
a rather significant condition in connection with herd No. 2. 
Here we find a short reduction time of milk produced in sterile

utensils. Tlie sterile utensil milk gave a standard re¬ 
duction time of 14.5, while the milk produced in producer’s 
utensils during the same milking reduced the dye in 8:45. 
Comparing the reduction times of the sterile utensil milk 
and the producer’s utensil milk from herd No. 2 with the 
milks from the other 6 herds, we find that with the milks 
from these 6 herds the reduction times of sterile utensil 
milks were in all cases over 10:00. Also with every one 
of these 6 herds the reduction times of milks from producer’s 
utensils were shorter than the reduction times of milks 
drawn during the same milking into sterile utensils* The 
results pertaining to herd No. 2 do not, therefore, compare 
with the results given by the milks from the other 6 herds. 

It seems that this difference may be explained as being due 
to the fact that most of the milk which was milked in sterile 
utensils in connection with herd No. 2 probably came from 
diseased udders, while the milk coming in contact with the 
producer’s utensils during this milking may have come from 
the majority of the normal udders* 

If note the highest incidence of mastitis (as ob¬ 
tained by the standard adopted here) in herd No. 1 where 
66*6 per cent of the cows produced milk tending to be ab¬ 
normal, and the lowest incidence of mastitis was shown in 
herd No. 4 where 37*5 per cent of the cows showed evidence 
of mastitis as revealed in the examination of their milk* 
Comparing the reduction times of sterile utensil milks from 
these 2 herds, we find no significant difference between

these reduction times, ^he fact should he noted that 
outside of herd No. 2 the reduction times of sterile 
utensil milks from all 6 herds were quite uniform in 
spite of the fact that the incidence of mastitis among 
the cows within the different herds varied considerably. 

It will he noted that high variations prevailed among 
the reduction times of milk produced in producer’s utensils 
in connection with all 7 herds. These variations were no 
doubt due to the fact that the unsterilized utensils used 
on these 7 farms contributed varying amounts of contamina¬ 
tion. 

In view of these results we may conclude that 
the incidence of mastitis in the herd usually bears very 
little relationship to the methylene blue reduction time 
of mixed herd milk. There may be exceptions, however, where 
the high incidence of mastitis in the herd may itself 
cause short reduction time of mixed herd milk, but such 
occurrences are believed to be rare and only confined to 
herds under the most careless management. Data reported 
here, therefore,- show that short reduction times of mixed 
herd milks may very seldom be attributed to diseased udders, 
but are primarily due to sources of milk contamination other 
than the cow’s udder.

THE METHYLENE BLUE REDIE TION TEST 
AS A TEST FOR THE DETECTION OF 
MASTITIS AMONG THE COWS 


Since a fair degree of relationship has been 
observed between the high leucocyte counts of milk and 
the incidence of mastitis, and also since a fairly close 
relationship has been noted between the leucocyte counts 
and the methylene blue reduction times, it was thought 
advisable to summarize the data collected during the course 
of this study and find to what extent the reduction test 
may be used in the detection of mastitis# 

Throughout this discussion the cows producing 
milk with more than 500,000 leucocytes per c#c# will be 
considered abnormal or suffering from mastitis# The stan» 
dard reduction times of these milks will be studied and 
an arbitrary standard reduction time of 10:00 or less will 
be taken as indicative of mastitis milk# An attempt will 
therefore be made to arrive at the value of the reduction 
test in detecting mastitis among the cows# 

A summary of data reported in Table s IX, XIV, 
and XV shows that of the 624 milks, 292 (46#79 per cent) 
contained more than 500,000 leucocytes per c#c#. Of the 
292 milks giving leucocyte counts higher than 500,000, 

115 ( 59*58 per cent) reduced the dye in 10:00 or less in 
the standard technique# On the other hand, of the 552

milks containing less than .500,000 leucocyte per c.c*, 
only 9 (2*71 per cent) gave standard reduction times of 
10:00 or less* These data, therefore, show that the 
methylene blue reduction test is able to segregate approx¬ 
imately 40 per cent of the milks which are classified ab¬ 
normal on the basis of the leucocyte count of .500,000* 

If an.assumption is made on the basis of the 
work reported by Hucker, et. al* (1932) and Hucker, (1933) 
that the leucocyte count in excess of 300,00 incriminates 
approximately 80 per cent of the cows showing symptoms of 
mastitis, then the reduction test may be expected to detect 
approximately 30 per cent of the infected cows. 

On the basis of the data summarized above, it 
seems reasonable to conclude that the methylene blue re¬ 
duction test has some value in the detection of abnormal 
milk* It seems that this test is able to detect the 
majority of milks which come from cows showing definite 
symptoms of mastitis* This is shown in Tables IX and XIV* 
When we examine the standard reduction times of milks con¬ 
taining more than 3 million leucocytes per c*c«, we note that 
of the 28 of these milks, 24 (83.71 per cent) reduced the 
dye in less than 10:00*

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 


PART I 

The results obtained on the accuracy of the 
available methods of measuring bacteria in herd milk, show 
that the methylene blue reduction test probably measures 
the bacterial populations in milk where bacteria exist in 
the form of large groups more accurately than does the 
plate method or the routine microscopic method. This con¬ 
tention is borne out by the data pertaining to milks which 
gave short reduction times and low plate counts, and which 
were found to contain enough bacteria to account for the 
short reduction times when as many as 1,000 fields per smear 
were examined microscopically, or ?/here smears prepared at 
the moment of reduction showed sufficient bacteria present 
to account for that phenomenon. The discrepancies between 
plate counts and reduction times of herd milks are apparently 

due to the faultiness of the plate method when applied to 

the 

milks that harbour bacteria in/form of large groups* 

The inaccuracies of the direct microscopic method 
in estimating bacteria in milk seem to be due primarily to 
the uneven distribution of bacterial cells end groups of 
bacteria throughout the smear and also to the fact that it 
is not always possible to obtain a representative sample of 
milk for the smear with the 0.01 c.c. pipette*

The results show that the 1,000 field per smear 
microscopic bacterial counts are probably closer to the 
actual bacterial contents than the counts obtained when 
only 60 fields per smear are searched* This is in accord¬ 
ance with what may be expected when all the factors wMch 
tend to influence the routine direct microscopic method 
are taken into consideration. 

The results on the accuracy of the direct microscop- 

the 

ic method as it is applied to the estimation of/leucocyte 
content of milk show that this method does not necessarily 
give accurate results* In view of the fact that wide vari¬ 
ations were obtained among the replicate counts from the same 
smear, and also among the counts made on replicate smears from 
the same milk, it appears that these variations were due to 
the uneven distribution of leucocytes throughout the smears* 
These results, therefore, seem to show that the 0*01 c*c* 
pipette probably discharges fairly uniform samples of milk 
for the smears* 


PART II 

The results pertaining to the studies on the role 
of leucocytes in the methylene blue reduction test show that 
leucocytes in milk probably do not exhibit any reducing 
properties* While it is true that a close relationship has 
been found between the reduction times and leucocyte counts,

many exceptions were also observed. The results seem to 
show that milks which come from abnormal udders reduce 
the dye in a short time irrespective of their leucocyte 
and bacterial contents. It, therefore, appears that an 
unknown reducing substance is probably associated with 
the milks containing large numbers of leucocytes. This 
seems to-indicate that the close relationship between 
leucocyte counts and reduction times is likely established 
indirectly through the relationships between the presence 
of some reducing substance in milk and the incidence of 
abnormality in the udders. 

A summary of data pertaining to the role of milk 
borne leucocytes and Rabbit and Bovine blood leucocytes 
in the reduction test of milk, leads to the conclusion 
that leucocytes in milk (milk borne or added to milk) ex¬ 
hibit no measurable effect on the reduction of methylene 
blue. 

The results pertaining to milks where insufficient 
leucoc3?tes and bacteria were found to account for the re¬ 
duction of the dye serve as further proof that there is 
probably present in such milks some unknown substance which 
is capable of reducing the dye in the reduction test.

PART III 


A relatively high average leucocyte content of 
milks from apparently normal cows in this district seems 
to indicate that probably a high percentage of the cows 
in this district have had past or present histories of 
mastitis. 

In view of the fact that the majority of the workers 
are in agreement that a leucocyte content of over 300,000 
per c.c. is indicative of abnormality of the udder, it 
seems that it is not unreasonable to adopt this figure as 
an arbitrary line of demarcation between normal and abnormal 
milk. 

A standard reduction time of over 10:00 for aseptically 
drawn udder milk seems to be reasonable to expect for normal 
milk. It appears that udder milks which reduce in less than 
10:00 invariably come from abnormal or infected udders. The 
results of these studies, therefore, seem to indicate that 
the reduction test based on the standard reduction time of 
10:00 or less is capable of segregating approximately 40 per 
cent of the milks classed abnormal on the basis of the 
leucocyte count in excess of 300,000.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The studies on the leucocytes and the reduction 
of methylene blue in milk lead to the following results 
and conclusions: 

1* The results show that the plate counts often 
give misleading infoimation on the bacteriological condi¬ 
tion of herd milks where bacteria tend to occur in large 
aggregates* 

blue 

2* It appears that the methylene/reduction test 
measures the bacterial content of milk where bacteria tend 
to occur in large groups more accurately than does the plate 
method. This, therefore, indicates that the reduction test 
is probably not affected by clumping of bacteria to the same 
degree as is the plate count* 

JSo The bacterial content of milk at the moment of 
reduction is higher than is indicated by the plate count* 

4* The microscopic count based on the examination of 
60 fields per smear may be very misleading when applied to 
milks that harbour relatively few bacteria and those milks 
where large groups of bacteria are found* 

3, The inaccuracies in the direct microscopic method 
of estimating bacteria in milk are mainly due to the uneven

distribution of singlecocci and of chains and clumps of 
bacteria throughout the stained smear* 

6. The results show that the 0*01 c*c* pipette does 
not necessarily withdraw a bacteriologically representative 
sample of milk for the smear* 

7* The average maximum deviation from the mean for the 
microscopic bacterial counts (based on the examination of 
entire smears) was 74*06 per cent, as contrasted with an 
average of 35*0? per cent for the leucocyte counts* In view 
of these results it may be concluded that the leucocyte counts 
are reasonably accurate for routine wcrk* 

8* A large proportion of the milks containing more than 
300,000 leucocytes per c.c* were found to harbour clumps or 
chains of bacteria when 1,000 fields per smear were searched. 

9* The average bacterial count of milks containing 
more than 300,000 leucocytes per c.c* has been found to be 
much higher than the average for milks containing less than 
half a million leucocytes* 

10. Only a general relationship has been noted between 
microscopic bacterial counts (1,000 fields per smear) and 
reduction times of udder milks* 

11* A fairly close relationship has been noted between 
reduction times and leucocyte counts of udder milks*

12. A number of short time reducing milks gave 
results which show that these milks contained insufficient 
bacteria and leucocytes to account for the reduction. 

13* A close relationship has been observed between 
standard and modified reduction times of milks containing 
large numbers of leucocytes. This is indicative that the 
sweeping up of leucocytes with the cream in the standard 
tests had no bearing upon the reduction times. Therefore, 
such results seem to indicate that leucocytes in milk ex¬ 
hibit no reducing properties. 

14. Abnormal milks seem to give short reduction times 
irrespective of their bacterial and leucocyte contents. 

Where enough bacteria are not found in such milks to account 
for the reduction, it appears that the reduction is due to 
the presence of some unknown substance which causes the re¬ 
duction of the dye in such milks. 

13* Bovine and Babbit blood leucocytes when added to 
udder milk were found to exhibit no measurable effect on the 
methylene blue reduction time of such milk. 

16 . An average leucocyte count of 1,187,000 was ob¬ 
tained for 136 apparently normal milks. Of the 136 cows, 

86 (33m 1 per cent) produced milk containing more than 
.500,000 leucocytes per c.c. 


17. High variations were obtained between the leucocyte

counts of milk from the different quarters of the same 
udder* 


l8<> The results show wide variations between the 
leucocyte counts of milk drawn at different times during 
the lactation period* 

19* A high incidence of mastitis among the 27 cows 
within one herd has been observed* 

20* A study of the incidence of mastitis among 
the cows in ±J> herds reveals that this disease is undoubted¬ 
ly of an important economic significance to the dairymen 
in the Edmonton district* 

21* It has been shown that short reduction times of 
mixed herd milks may but very seldom be attributed to dis¬ 
eased udders* 

22. The methylene blue reduction test may be expected 
to detect approximately 30 per cent of milk coming from 
abnormal udders* 

23 . It has been found that 8.5*71 per cent of the 
milks containing more than 3 million leucocytes per c.c* 
reduced methylene blue in less than 10:00 in the standard 
technique.
