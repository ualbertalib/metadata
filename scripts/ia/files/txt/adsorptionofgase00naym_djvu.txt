HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 









Historical Introduction 


The phenomenon of adsorption v/as first 
discovered and described by C.W. Scheele in 1773. In the 
early history of its study the nature of adsorption was 
not known, hence was made synonymous with absorption. 
Subsequently it was recognized that the phenomenon 
occurred on the surface and the term adsorption was 
applied to this behavior. Adsorption now describes the 
behavior of a solid substance (adsorbent) in contact with i 
a liquid or gas (adsorbate) which gives rise to an increase 
concentration of the adsorbate molecules on the surface 
of the adsorbent as compared with the bulk phase of the 
adsorbate. 

Adsorption was found to be of two types 
depending on how the adsorbate molecule was held by the 
surface. In physical adsorption the molecules are held 
by Van der Waal’s forces. In chemical■ adsorption the 
molecules are held by chemical bonds. The type encoun*- 
tered in this work is physical adsorption. 

The phenomenon of adsorption is of great 
practical and theoretical importance In chemistry and 
allied sciences. The nature of adsorption has been the 
subject for a number of hypotheses, some of them 
contradicting each other. Possibly the most Important 
of these is one brought forward by Langmuir In his 
classical paper on adsorption (l). In this paper he

states liis mono-molecular layer theory which has been 
substantiated by much experimental evidence* 

The mechanism of physical adsorption of 
adsorbates on various adsorbents has been investigated 
and determined. It has been found that the amount of 
material adsorbed is dependent on the concentration (or 
pressure in the case of gases) of the adsorbate, tempera¬ 
ture, time and the nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent. 
In experimental procedure, the variable factor is usually 
the concentration (or pressure) while all the other 
conditions are held constant® A graphical representation 
of the data obtained is an isotherm in which the amount 
adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent is 'plotted against 
the equilibrium concentration or pressure at constant 
temperature. 

Since the extent and manner of adsorption is 
depend.ent on the nature of the adsorbent and adsorba,te, a 
relatively large number of different shapes of these 
isotherms is possible. The simplest of these, and one 
commonly exhibited, by chs,rcoal, shows a very sharp rise 
starting with zero concentration or pressure and then a 
flattening out. Diagramatically It can be shown thuss

Preundlich represented this type of graph 

mathematically as 

1 

v — kp 11 where v is the amount adsorbed, k is a 

constant, p is the equilibrium pressure or concentration 

and n) l» The Preundlich isotherm offers quite a useful 

means of expressing and comparing adsorption results and 

is still widely used for that purpose. The defects 

inherent in it are 1) it only holds over narrow ranges, 

and 2) it is purely empirical having no theoretical basis. 

It is therefore of little use as a means of elucidating 

the mechanism of the adsorption process. 

LangmiAir, in his monomolecular layer theory, 

brought forth a more useful expression known as the 

Langmuir isotherm. Assuming an adsorbed layer only one 

molecule thick, lie expressed the amount adsorbed as 

V r: P>bk where p is the equilibrium pressure or concentra- J 
14-pk 

tion and k and b are constants which hold for a given 
system. This algebraic expression may be resolved into 














4 


an equation for a straight line thus: 

£ — 1 4 . £• £ and. V are obtained from experimental data. 

Y ~ bk b 

The values of b and k may be obtained from the slope and 
slope-intercept of the p/Y versus P graph. The value b 
has been shown to be the maximum volume that can be 
adsorbed by a given charcoal. The Langmuir isotherm 
applies well to the experimental data obtained in this 
work and has been used throughout. 

Langmuir’s isotherm works well in cases where 
Preundlich’s isotherm fails, but is itself limited to 
monomolecular layer adsorption. Emmett, Brunauer and 
Teller, using a method which is a generalization of 
Langmiur’s treatment of unimolecular adsorption, have 
developed an isotherm equation applicable to multi-molecula 
layers and capilla.ry condensation an well (2). 

A useful application involving adsorption is 
that of measuring surface areas of adsorbents. Two 
common methods in use for doing this involve adsorption 
from solution, and gas adsorption in an evacuated system* 

Of the two the former has been longer in use. The latter 
method has been given an impetus by the development of 
the Emmett apparatus with its easy manipulation and high 
accuracy (3). 

■ 

Adsorption, as was previously mentioned, is a 
function of the nature.of the adsorbate and adsorbent. 

In the case of a porous material, such as charcoal, one 



















5 


7/ould have to choose suitable adsorbates for determining 
its surface area. Garner, McKie and Knight (4) offer the 
following criteria in choosing these adsorbates: 

(1) The longest molecular dimension should be 
smaller than the radius of the smallest capillary in the 
porous body. 

(2) The molecule should be capable of packing easily 
in the surface and in such a manner that the lateral 
forces between the adsorbed molecules increase the 
stability of the film. 

(3) The adsorbed molecules should be so oriented on 
the surface that the exposed groups of the molecules of 
the first layer exert weak subsiduary valency forces on 
the second layers, thus reducing the tendency to form 
multilayers• 

The surface areas of many charcoals have been 
determined using acids and alcohols in adsorption from 
solution. Lemieux and Morrison (5) began investigating 
the adsorption of the low molecular weight mono-carboxylic 
acids and benzoic acid on a series of seven activated 
coconut charcoals. Miller and Morrioon (6) extended this 
work to include the dicarboxylic and unsaturated dicar¬ 
boxylic acids on the same series. 

The work of Lemieux, Miller and Morrison 
indicated unimolecularity of adsorption of the fatty acids 
sud has revealed much concerning the nature of the char- 









6 


coal pores* They have shown that the screening effect of 
the charcoal is bxi important factor in determining the 
amount of adsorption taking place. They have come to the 
conclusion that the acid molecules are oriented vertically 
on the charcoal surface. On the basis of this Miller has 
been able to calculate pore radii* 

The object of the present work is to investigate 
the adsorption of the gaseous hydrocarbons on the same 
series with the use of the Emmett Apparatus. Although 
very little information concerning the adsorptive 
properties of these gases on such a, series has been 
reported, some work has been done using methane, butane 
and nitrogen on a single charcoal. Miller(6) determined 
the amount of absorption of nitrogen and butane by these 
charcoals. By comparison with the results of cabboxylic 
acids which are oriented vertically, he considered that 
butane is oriented vertically also. This is contrary to 
the horizontal orientation postulated by Brunauer and 
Emmett, and others. He attributes the vertical orienta¬ 
tion of butane to adsorption by induced, dipole formation, 
which considers adsorption to be a results of interaction 
between surface and adsorbed dipoles. Butane has a zero 
permanent dipole, but am induced dipole ©f 20*49 ml, along 
the long axis and 4*6 ml, along the short axis. 

Presumably vertica,! orientation would favor greater 
interaction and hence greater adsorption.

It is the object of this thesis to 
investigate the hydrocarbon gases from methane to 
butane m order to elucidate the nature of their 
adsorption. In this way it may be possible to confirm 
or deny the hypothesis of Miller end Morrison concerni'n 
the orientation of butane on a charcoal surface*

Experimental 

The apparatus used for this work was one 
described by Emmett (3) and others* The diagram of the 
apparatus, with explanations and the principle of its 
operation, is given by Miller in his thesis (6)* 

The gases required for this Y/ork had to be 
extremely pure* This purity was obtained, with possibly 
the exception of propane* The propane and butane were 
obtained from the Ohio Chemical Company and were specified 
to be 99*9^ and 99.9^-pure respectively* However, 
propane behaved badly for charcoals 4, 5, 6 and 7, and a 
reason given for this behavior was the possible contamina¬ 
tion of this gas by some foreign material in the tank or 
in the process of transfer to the ster age bulb. Purther 
investigation will have to be made to account for 
anomolous propane results* 

Butane and propane were allowed to enter the 
evacuated storage bulbs after passing through purifying 
traps immersed in ice-water, and dry ice-acetone (-50°C) 
baths for the respective gases. This procedure could 
be improved; in the future it is suggested that these 
gasses be liquified in a trap immersed in a dry ice-acetone 
btxth at; approximately -80°C* The non-condensable gases 
and lower molecular weight impurities would then be 
pumped off and the middle fraction allowed to evaporate 













9 


into the storage bulb to the desired pressure. 

Purified tank nitrogen was used in this work. 

The purification involved passing the nitrogen through 
a CrCl^ solution tower, then through anhydrous CaClg, 

P 2 O 5 and soda-ash driers, and finally through a trap 
immersed in liquid air. 

Pure methane was obtained by the low temperature 
fractionation (liquid air) of natural gas using a, 
fractionating column described by Verschoyle (7). 

Pure ethane pas prepared by the hydrolysis of 
ethyl magnesium bromide. This gas was passed through 
fuming HgSO^, concentrated HgSO^., 20% KOH and pelleted 
KOH scrubbers and was finally fractionated using liquid aii 


Helium purchased from the Ohio Chemical Company 


was used. Prior to storage in the bulb it was passed 
through an activated charcoal trap cooled in a liquid 
air bath. 

Ho quantitative analysis of the gases was made. 
In 0,11 cases they were assumed to be in a desirably 
pure state. 

The dead space in the adsorption chamber was 
determined at 0 °G in the manner suggested by Brunauer 
and Emmett, and described by Miller ( 6 ). In this 
determination pure helium is used; being an inert gas 
it is adsorbed to a negligible extent. It was assumed 
that helium obeys the ideal gas laws. Hence the dead

space at any temperature (V n ) could "be computed using 

the equation Y n - Y x 275 where Y is the volume 

T 

of the dead space at H,T,fh and T n is the temperature 
of the adsorption chamber during a run* 

The experimented, work is based on a principle 
suggested by Emmett and Brunauer, in which the adsorption 
takes place at or near the boiling point of the gas. 
However, to eliminate the possibility of capillary conden¬ 
sation and to make more reproducible results possible, 
use of a temperature several degrees shove the boiling 
point was found to be more satisfactory. The temperatures 
used during the runs end the boiling.points of the gases

propane and ethane could he obtained and no experimental 
data was available for computing this deviation. The 
corrections made for these two gases were estimated on 
the basis of their physical properties as compared with 
those of similar gases. Only the 11 dead space" volumes 
were corrected for the gas imperfections, and the new 
volume V-u was expressed as V n x 100 # -h h# where h is

There is some doubt as to whether the correction is 
important in this work; the necessity for it will be 
determined by further investigation. 

The same series of coconut charcoal (charge 35) 
was used in this work as was used by Lemieux and Morrison, 
and Miller and Morrison. This series is made up of 
seven charcoals of different degrees of activation all 
derived from the same original unactivated batch. The 
data supplied with these charcoals are given in Miller’s 
thesis (6). 

The amount of adsorption of each of the gases 
on charcoals one to seven was determined employing the 












12 


method described by Miller (6), In calculating the 
amounts of adsorption of these gases, all volumes were 
referred to S,T,P, The amount of adsorption (V a ) was 
determined from 

v a = V B - V b - V d where 

V-g gs,s volume in the burette before adsorption* 
Y*q — amount of residual gas in the dead space 
following previous adsorption, 

V-^ =r amount of gas in the burette following 
adsorption 

= amount of gas in the adsorption bulb followin 
adsorption* 

The values of P/V a were plotted against P in 
accordance with Langmuir’s isotherm* Good plots were 
obtained for all the gases. Only one run on each char¬ 
coal with each gas was made except for propane on 
cha,rcoals 1, 4, and 7* The graphs shown in Pig, 4 for 
propane on these charcoals represent the average of 
several runs made on each. 

The slopes of the straight lines were used to 
find the maximum adsorption (V m ) of each gas oy the 
charcoals.

Results 

The adsorption isotherms for nitrogen, methane, 
ethane, propane and butane are shown in figures 1 to 5 
respectively. These isotherms indicate that the 
Langmuir equation applies well to the experimental data, 
obtained. 

The maximum volumes of gases adsorbed (V^) 
were obtained from the slopes of the graphs. Lor the 
purpose of interpretation the volumes were converted to 
the maximum number of millimoles of gas adsorbed (Table l) 
The results obtained by Miller (6) on the same series 
with butane and nitrogen are given to show the effect of 
sampling and to a,scerta,in the reproducibility of results.

DISCUSSION OP RESULTS

Discussion of Results 

It was stated previously that the surfe.ce 

ares, of an adsorbent could be determined from the 

maximum volume (V m ) absorbed in a layer one molecule 

thick. The surfa.ce area in square metres per gram of 

adsorbent is given by VmITcr x 10“ 2 ® where V m is 

1000 

the maximum adsorption in millimoles per gram, U is 
Avogadro’s number and cr i s the area covered by an 
adsorbate molecule and is expressed in square angstroms. 
In the following discussion this area, will be referred 
to as the section area or effective absorption area,* It 
is not to be confused with the cross-sectional e.rea, of the 
molecule, that is, the area aJLong the short axis. 

Livingston (9) indics,tes that the surface area 
of a non-porous substance should be almost the same when 
determined by means of a variety of suitable adsorbates. 
This may not be necessaril^r true for porous materials 
such as charcoal because other factors enter into the 
mechanism of adsorption. Lemieux and Morrison (5) and 
Miller and Morrison (6) obtained charcoaJ. surf an e areas 
which varied with the activa.tion of the charcoal and the 
length of the fatty acid used. They suggested that the 
variation was due to the screening effect of the charcoal 
pores. The data presented in Table II on charcoaJL areas 
by ga.seous ebsorbates apparently substantiates their

results. That Is, the areas obtained also vary with 
activation and molecular size. However, it will he 
shown that this variation in the surface areas may he 
due to quite a different mechanism. 

Charcoal Surface Areas. 

Some difficulty was encountered in obtaining 
the values for cr, the effective adsorption area of the 
gas molecules used. Values for some of them were 
reported in the literature but there was much discrepancy 
in these. Brunauer and Emmett used 15.8 A°^ for solid 
nitrogen packing and 16.2 or 17.0 A 0 ^ for liquid packing 
(12) . Gatfdin and Bowdish have shown in their investiga¬ 
tions the 13.8 value to be the more - suitable area for 
nitrogen at liquid air temperature (10)• Jura and Harkins 
(14) used 15.4A oS consistently for nitrogen and justified 
the use of this value on the basis of sixty isotherms 
which they obtained. Brunauer and Emmett, assuming 
horizontal orientation, have calculated the section area 
for butane to be 32A° • Pineman, Guest and- McIntosh, 
also assuming horizontal orientation, have used 48A 0 ^ 
for butane in their work on a coconut charcoal series (ll) 
Livingston (9) attributes these discrepancies in the 
section areas to the packing. Por a given adsorbate 
this' packing varies with temperature, surface pressure 
and the adsorbent. He states that a correct value for 














17 


tlie section area of a molecule would have to “be obtained 
from an inter-relation of areas obtained from adsorption, 
X-ray, density and fiIra-balance measurements. 

The values for the effective adsorption areas 
for nitrogen, methane and butane used in this work are 
thos e given by Brunauer and Emmett in one of their 
papers (12)• The section areas of propane and ethane 
were computed from data given by Hendricks (13)• All 
these values are based on the assumption that the 
molecules are oriented horizontally, either in solid or 
liquid packing. 

The surface areas of the charcoals investigated 
in this work are given in Table II, The charcoal areas 
for both liquid and solid packing were determined, in the 

case of nitrogen, methane and butane* 

! i ( 

Set I gives the surface areas determined in the : 
present work. Set II gives the charcoal areas determined 
by Hiller with nitrogen on the same charcoal series as 
was used for set I. Set III gives the surface area data 
obtained by Eineman, Guest,and McIntosh on a similar 

footnotes to Ta,ble II: 

(1) (a) - the section area for solid packing 

(2) (b) - the section area for liquid packing 

(3) This value for cr is the one calculated by Miller 
(6) on the basis of vertical orientation of butane.

coconut charcoal series (11). The last two sets are 
included for comparison. There is fairly good agreement 
among the three sets. A comparison of sets I and II 
indicates the effect of sampling. When comparing the 
data in set I and II, one must remember that the histories 
of the two charcoal series differ. 

Surface Orientation 

The maximum number of millimoles of nitrogen, 
methane, ethane, propane and butane adsorbed by each 
charcoal were plotted against the number of millimoles 
of butane adsorbed (Pig. 6)• The butane versus butane 
graph is a straight line at 45° with the horizontal axis. 
It was believed that if these plots gave lines which 
eventually met, or shoY/ed a, tendency to he et each other 
towards the charcoals of high activity, then this would 
be an indication of orientation of the same nature as 
that encountered with the acids on charge 35 (5). 

However, the graphs obtained showed a contrary behavior 
as figure 6 indicates. The maximum numbers of millimoles 
adsorbed by the charcoals increase both with increasing 
activation and decreasing molecular size rather than 
approach a common V m with increasing activation as was 
the case with the acias (compare values in Tables I and 
IA) • The fact that the number of millimoles adsorbed, 
when plotted against butane, diverge with increasing 
activity instead of converge as do the straight- chained

aliphatic acids (5) indicates that the orientation of the 
gas molecules differs from that of the acid molecules. 
Whereas in vertical orientation the screening effect 
and molecular length were the controlling factors, in 
the case of the gaseous hydrocarbons there are indications 
that the important factor is the area occupied by a 
molecule horizontally oriented* »

At this point it might be well to differentiate 

II 

between horizontal and vertical orientation. Lemieux, 

- 

Miller and Morrison (5, 6) have indicated that the pores 
in these charcoals are cone-shaped. They assume these 
cone-shaped pores on the basis of the vertical orientation 
of the acid molecules. In vertical orientation the long 

axis of the molecule is normal to the charcoal surface. 

- 

The limitations in this type of adsorption are the 
screening effect and the chain length. Prom this 
argument it is easy to understand why the maximum

21 - 


volumes of acid adsorbed approach each other with the 
increasing activity of the charcoals* (Table IA)« At 
lower activations the number of millimoles of the larger 
molecules adsorbed are reduced by screening but at higher 
activations approach each other because of the reduced 
screening effect. This would be expected if the 
orientation were in such a way that the area occupied by 
each molecule were the same. 

In horizontal orientation it will be assumed 
that the same areaf are available to the various gases* 
Then the amount adsorbed would depend on the effective 
adsorption area of the molecule (assuming a unimolecular 
layer) • The maximum volume absorbed (V m ) is inversely 
proportional to this area. One would expect such a 
relation to give divergence in a millimoles absorbed 
versus millimoles adsorbed plot. 

Diagram of Vertical and Horizontal Orientation 



Acid ad-sorption Proposed gas adsorption 

(vertical) (horizontal) 

Let us assume that the orientation Is 

horizontal. Such an assumption can be substantiated 

with evidence from the literature. Brunauer and 

Emmett (12) have indicated that butane is orie nted with 











22 - 


the long axis parallel to the solid surface of an iron 
catalyst, Livingston in his work with n-heptane on 
smooth surfaces (including graphite) found that the 
section area of heptane corresponds to horizontal rather 
than vertical orientation. 

In discussing horizontal orientation the writer 
usually implies equal, or approximately equal surface 
areas available to all adsorbates providing their 
molecular thickness is of little or no importance. The 
fairly constant ratios in Table III (given later) seem to 
indicate that the same are an are available to all the 
gases. Hence the area of a given charcoal should be 
almcs t the same regardless of which of the gasses is used. 
The limitation is the accuracy of the values for the 
section areas of the gas molecules used. According to 
Livingston (9) these areas would be expected to vary for 
different adsorbents so that the values used in this work 
in computing the charcoal surface areas may not 
necessarily be correct. 

However, any error In the effective adsorption 
area, of any one molecule would be carried through for the 
seven charcoals. With this in mind it may be possible to 
compare the surface areas of the charcoals in another 
manner, A comparison was made in figures 7 and 8 where 
the surface areas of the seven charcoals as determined 
with nitrogen, methane, ethane and propane were plotted

against the surface areasgiven “by butane® The areas 
plotted were those determined on the basis of solid 
packing* On the basis of the assumptions made (that the 
molecules are horizontally oriented* and that 
approximately the same areas are available to all the 
gases), the graphs obtained in such a plot should be 
parallel or nearly parallel to the reference line (butane 
versus butane)* It can be seen from figures 7 and 8 that 
the lines for the gs.ses are nearly parallel to the 
standard line of butane® This seems to indicate that the 
assumptions ma.de initially are correct® 

The displacement of the approximately parallel 
lines in figures 7 and 8 indicates the possibility of 
finding more accurate values for the section areas of the 
molecules® This possibility will be discussed later* 

It is generally accepted that the nitrogen and. 
methane molecules are spherical or nearly so® Hence they 
should not behave differently whether the other hydro¬ 
carbon gases are vertically or horizontally oriented 
when adsorbed by charcoal® Using this characteristic 
of these two gases it would probably be possible to con¬ 
firm or disprove Miller’s vertical orientation hypothesis 
for butane (6)* The surface areas of the seven charcoals 
obtained from nitrogen and methane adsorption were plotted 
against the surface areas computed on the basis of Miller*s 
cross-sectionsl area of 20A°~ for butane (Pig. 9).

Tlie lines are not at all parallel to the "butane versus 
butane reference line* This behavior is to be expected 
from the argument presented in the previous paragraph 
and further confirms the horizontal orientation 
hypothesis proposed in this thesis. 

Miller based his hypothesis on (1) the approx¬ 
imately equaJL adsorption of butane and the 1 o\7-molecular- 
weight monocarboxylic acids by charcoals 6 and 7, and, 

(2) for these activated charcoals butane ?/ould be expected 
to have access to the seme area as the acids. The 
present work with the gaseous hydrocarbon series does Hot 
justify Miller’s deduction of vertical orientation for 
butane* 

On the basis of the above arguments it may be 
concluded that' the hydrocarbon homologs are horizontally- 
oriented v/hen adsorbed by a, charcoal surface. 

Effective Adsorption J. Areas of M o lecules 

It was previously suggested that the displace¬ 
ment of the lines from the butane versus butane reference 
line in figures 7 and 8 indicates the possibility of 
determining more accurate values for the effective 
adsorption areas of the molecules# The ratios, 
millimoles of nitrogen adsorbed 

millimoles of hydrocarbon adsorbed, were determined for 
all the hydrocarbon gases fox^ the whole, charcoal series# 
These ratios are given- in Table III. Similar rahios

reference gas but the one set will be sufficient here. 

It is interesting to note that the ratios for 

methane and ethane are fairly constant throughout the 

charcoal series. Jor propane and butane the ratio 

decreases with increasing charcoal activity until it 

reaches a fairly constant value starting with charcoal 4 

for propane and charcoal 5 for butane. However, this 

does not account for the displacement from the reference 

lines of the surface area versus surface area lines in 

figures 7 and-8* This displacement may be partly 

accounted for if a comparison of tables III and IV is made. 

Table IV gives the ratios of the effective 

adsorption areas of the gases. Since V m o<i for any gas 

cr 

adsorbate, then the V m ratios correspond to the inverse 
cr ratios.

the average V m ratios in

corresponding ratios for cr in table IV. The V m values 
are experimentally obtained and are in error by an amount 
which is determined by the experimeptal procedure used. 

The cr values are only estimated approximately and so are 
more liable to error. The effect of a low value for cr 
can be illustrated thus: 

Let us determine the surf an e area of a, charcoal by 
means of a gas A. 

Thi s surface area, ocY rn cr — kV cr 

m 

Let cr be the true section area of the gas A molecule, 
therefore, will give the true surface area, of the charcoal. 

Hence for any Op<cr, the surface area determined 
would be less than the true surface area. 

This is .presumably what has happened in the 
present work. The cr values for all the gases used are 
lower than the true values. Hence all the charcc/al 
surface areas given in Table II are too low. 

If the ratio between the cr values used in this 
work is the same an the ratio between the true values, 
then one would expect the surf one area of a given char** 
coal to be approximately the some regardless of the gas 
used for determining it. From Table II it is apparent 
that the ratio of the cr values used in this work is not 
the some as the ratio of the true values for the section 
areas of the gases. The surface areas given in table II 


























■ 
































28 


are in error "by an amount which is proportional to the 
variations in the tT/o ratios mentioned. To illustrate 
a little more fully take the case of butane and propane. 
Presumably the ratio of their section areas used in this 
work is closest to the true ratio of their section areas 
because from figure 8 one can see that the propane versus 
butane line is least displaced from the reference line 
(butane versus butane). There is a greater discrepancy 
between the present cr ratios from the true ratios for 
butane and the other gases, hence a greater displacement 
of their lines from the reference one. 

The above argument indicates that it should be 
possible to calculate the effective adsorption areas of 
the gas molecules from the adsorption data. Livingston 
substantiates this suggestion by saying that it is possible 
to determine the section areas of adsorbates adsorbed by 
non-porous solids. To be able to do so in the case of 
porous materials the molecules would have to be adsorbed 
horizontally so that the screening effect would be at a 
minimum. That is, each adsorbate Y/ould have to have 
access to approximately the same surface area* In this 
work this criterion is satisfied, particularly for the 
more activated charcoals* In order to be able to 
calculate the effective adsorption areas of the gas 
molecules, a particula,r. gas must be taken as a standard. 
Hitrogen is perhaps the simplest molecule and its section 








- 29 - 


area, is most accurately known. Using either of the 

nitrogen values, 13.8 A 0 '" (solid packing ) or 17.DA 0 '"" 

(liquid packing the effective adsorption areas of the 

other gas molecules may he obtained from the relation 

Vm for nitrogen x 13>8 (or 17.0). The areas 
V m for hydrocarbon 

which were thus obtained are given in Table V, (column 
a is IT 2 solid packing, column b is Hg liquid packing)• 

The awerage of all the areas of methane and 
ethane was taken because they are fairly constant for the 
whole charcoal series. For propane only the values for 
the last five charcoals and for butane the last three 
charcoals are averaged. 

Livingston indicates that the effective 
adsorption area varies with the adsorbent. Hence it is 
safe to state that the average values for the effective 
adsorption areas determined from the adsorption data are 
probably more accurate than those used in determining 
the surface areas given in Table II. However, the section 
areas determined from the adsorption data are not 
entirely justified either. The reason why they are not 
fully justified will be discussed later* 

It is interesting to note that the 46.7 A 02 
value for liquid packing of butane is in good agreement 
with, the -48 A° value used by Fineman, Guest and McIntosh 
for butane (11)*

The average values for the effective 
adsorption area in Table V have been used to recalculate 
the surface areas of the seven charcoals. These are 
given in Table VI. The five values for the surface area 
of any one charcoal are in good agreement with one 
another except in the case of the less activated char-* 
coals for which propane and butane show an anomalous 
behavior*

More accurate values for the surface areas of 
the charcoals a,re obtained by averaging the areas of any¬ 
one charcoal (Table VI*) * Only the values given by the 
first three gases were used in finding the average sur¬ 
face areas of charcoals 1, 2 and 3. The average surface 
areas of charcoals 4, 5, 6 and 7 were obtained by

averaging tlie values given "by the five gases. 

Screening Effect 

The discussion till now has "been based on the 
assumption that approximately the same surface areals 
are available to all the gases. This is substantiated 
to some extent by Table III. However, this table also 
indicates that for the less activated charcoals butane 
and propane do not behave the same as the other gases. 

It is possible to explain this anomolous behavoir on 
the basis of the screening effect of the charcoal pores. 

The gas molecules have a thickness which may 
be quite important in determining their penetrability 
into the finer pores. The diameter of the nitrogen 
molecule is from 3*0 to 3*5 A 0 . Methane and ethane 
each have a thickness of about 4 A 0 * Butane and propane 
are thicker. In these two gases the carbons are not 
situated in a straight line but in planes intersecting 
each other at 109°30 ! # The carbons are situated at the 
apices of consecutive intersecting planes. This 
accounts for their greater thickness which is approxi¬ 
mately 4.5 to 5*0 A 0 . The greater thickness of the 
butane and propane molecules would indicate that they 
may be screened by the finer pores in the lower activated 
chareoals* However, as the activity of the charcoal 
increases, the statistical distribution of pores sizes 

shifts in the direction of the larger pores. Consequently

these thicker molecules gain access to approximately 
the same, areas, as is indicated in tables III and V. 

In the previous seed on the effective 
adsorption areas of the hydrocarbon molecules were 
determined from the adsorption data on the basis of the 
area occupied by a nitrogen molecule* Also cone-shaped 
pores were assumed as suggested by Lemieux and Morrison 
(5)* The fact that the thickness of the hydrocarbon 
molecules' varies from that of nitrogen would suggest that 
the hydrocarbon gases do not have access to quite the 
some areas* This is probably true because the nitrogen 
molecule can penetrate further into the cone than can 
any of the others* Similarly methane and ethane can 
penetrate further than propane and butane* This would 
indicate that the calculated effective adsorption areas 
in table V are somewhat in error* Actually this should 
be a very slight error because the surfaces at the apices 
of the cones are probably only a small fraction of the 
total surface* Furthermore it would be very difficult 
to determine this small fraction of the total surface 
area, to which only the smaller molecules have access. 
Hence it is impossible at this point to correct the value 
given for the section areas in Table V,

In conclusion it must be noted that all 
calculations of charcoal surface areas and effective 
adsorption areas of the gases are based on the area 
occupied by nitrogen at the gas - charcoal interface* 
They can therefore, be only as accurate as the values 
(13*8A° 2 or 17*0A 0 '") used for nitrogen*

Summary 


The adsorption of nitrogen, methane, ethane, 
propane and butane by a series of charcoals (with 
increasing activity) was measured using an Emmett 
adsorption apparatus# 

The surface areas of the charcoals in this 
series were determined using the values given b y BrunaUer 
and Emmett for the effective adsorption areas of nitrogen, 
methane and butane and the values for the effective 
adsorption areas of propane and ethane calculated on the 
basis of data given by Hendricks# 

By comparing the results of Lemieux, Miller 
and Morrison with those obtained in this work it was 
possible to show that the hydrocarbon molecules are 
oriented horizontally on a charcoal surface# 

The present work does not confirm Miller , s 
hypothesis of vertical orientation of butane# 

. The effective adsorption areas of the hydro¬ 
carbon molecules were calculated from the adsorption data 
on the basis of (1) the substantiated assumption that 
approximately equal areas were available to all the gases, 
and (2) the assumption that the va-lues of 13*8 or 17 
for the section area of nitrogen are quite accurate* 

The surfa,ce llpeas of the charcoals in this 
series were recalculated using these new effective

adsorption areas ox the gases. There was good 
agreement "between all the gases for the surface area 
of any one charcoal# 

There are indications of some screening effect 
for all the gases but. it is most evident for propane 
and butane. The screening effect of the gas molecules 
is determined by their thickness rather than by their 
chain lengths#

Suggestions for future T/ork 

1# Only the straight-chained hydrocarbon gases 

were studied in this work. It should be possible to 
determine the adsorption of isobutane by this charcoal 
series with the Lmmett adsorption apparatus. The higher 
homologs such as the liquid pentane, hexane and. heptane 
isomers could be studied with the use of a McBain and 
B&kr sorption balance. 

2. Livingston suggests that the effective 

adsorption area, of an adsorbate molecule may be obtained 
by working yjith it on a non-porous adsorbent in conjunc¬ 
tion with an adsorbate whose area is quite accurately 
known. Hence it should be possible to determine the 
section areas of the gaseous hydrocarbons using a non- 
porous adsorbent. The values thus obtained could be 
compared with the section areas given in Table V 0 
This would bear out the importance of the screening 
effect in the adsorption of these gases by charcoal. 
Furthermore such investigations would give further proof 
to the exact nature of the orientation of these gas 
molecules. 

3® The heats of adsorption of the hydrocarbon 

go.ses may be determined by working at two different 
temperatures and. using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation*

4. In this work the time allowed for adsorption 
equilibrium to be reached was the same for each gas. 

This procedure is probably not fully justified since 
the time for equilibrium to be reached may not be the 
same for each gas. Because the sizes of the molecules 
differ, the rate of diffusion of the molecule s into the 
pores may have some importance in determing the amount 
of a gas being adsorbed. It is suggested that experi¬ 
mental proof be obtained whether the rate of adsorption 
is the same for all gases and, if it is not, that the 
rate of adsorption be determined for each individual gas. 

5. There is much confusion in the literature not 
only as to what the effective adsorption area should be 
but also whether solid or liquid packing takes place in 
adsorption at the boiling points of the gases. It is 
suggested that it may be possible to determine the 
exact nature of the packing. 

6. In this work very little consideration has been 
given to the activity of the respective charcoals. The 
rate of activation, starting with the crude charcoal, 
could probably be correlated with the amount of 
adsorption taking place, hence elucidating the nature and 
rate of pore formation. Activation of a given weight 

of crude charcoal results in a loss in weight between 
the initial and the higher activated one. This loss in

weight should "be equivalent to the pore-volume. An 
inter-relation of pore-volume and charcoal surface area 
should give the magnitude of pore radii* Unfortunately 
very little activation data is available on this 
charcoal series to make such a study possible.
