A STUDY OF THE CAUSES OF STERILITY IN MEDIC AGO 


SATIVA L. (ALFALFA) IN RELATION TO 
SEED-SETTING 


James Linden Bolton 


INTRODUCTION 


The problem of sterility in alfalfa, Medicago 
sativa, has been of considerable interest to professional 
agriculturists during the last twenty-five or thirty 
years. The plant is one of the most valuable used for 
forage purposes, but its great variability in seed 
production presents difficulties of much economic 
importance. Consequently, a large amount of literature 
reporting investigations conducted under a wide diversity 
of environmental conditions has resulted. 

Most of the reports have been concerned with 
ecological aspects or have involved entire populations 
of plants. It has been observed that individual plants 
exhibit the same relative seed-producing variability, 
and that these differences are maintained through 
consecutive years. Thus, it was decided to study, as 
carefully as possible, the processes involved in the

setting of seed in individual plants, known to vary 
widely in seed-setting capacity. It was hoped that an 
intensive study from this viewpoint would reveal 
important factors in the solution of the general problem. 

At the outset it was desired to obtain a 
reliable fertility index for each plant so that the 
influence of specific variables might be accurately 
measured. To accomplish this, data were accumulated for 
each plant with reference to the number of pods set and 
the number of normal and abortive seeds per pod. 
Experiments were also outlined to obtain reliable 
information on the amount of pollen, and its germinating 
ability both on artificial media, and on the stigma. 

Rate of pollen-tube growth was investigated as well as 
the number of pollen tubes penetrating the ovary. 

LITERATURE REVIEW 


The Origin and General Variability of Alfalfa 


The species Medieago sativa L. is generally 
recognized to be highly variable in its morphology. 
This variability has been emphasized by Fryer (16) and 
the validity of certain allied species and sub-species 
questioned. From his cytological study of the genus

Medieago he further concludes that, on the basis of 
ohromosome number and morphology, there is no apparent 
reason why M. media , or cultivated alfalfa, should not 
have arisen from the hybridization of M. sativa and M. 
falcata . Sinskaia (29), after observing M. sativa , M. 
hemicycla and M. falcata in their native habitats in 
Russia, comments on the extreme variety of the three 
species. He decided that M. sativa has given rise, by 
ecologic-geographical differentiation, to M. falcata 
through M. hemicycla . The Grimm variety is the one which 
composes the greater proportion of cultivated alfalfa 
grown in Canada and the northern United States. MeClymonds 
(24) believes it to be the product of a natural hybrid 
from a cross between M. sativa and M. falcata , and Kirk 
(20) cites it as an example of a collection of many lines 
developed under natural selection. 

The Effect of Climate on Seed-setting 


It is a common observation that alfalfa requires 
rather definite climatic conditions before satisfactory 
seed yields can be obtained, and reports from observers 
in various parts of the world are available. Alter (1), 
after an extensive survey of meteorological and yield 
data from the state of Utah, concludes that climate is

the controlling factor in seed production. He notes that 
the principal alfalfa seed exporting countries of the 
world have climates similar to the western plains and 
plateau regions of the United States. He remarks further, 
that satisfactory yields are obtained in humid areas only 
when drought conditions for corn prevail. A later report 
from Utah, by Carlson (6), stated that temperature was 
not found to be correlated with seed yield, but that 
some relationship between seed yield and relative 
atmospheric humidity was obtained. Spencer and Stev/art 
(36), working in Colorado, decided that hot days, cool 
nights and dry air during both the day and the night 
resulted in heavy seed crops, but that hot dry weather 
during the blossoming period was particularly unfavorable. 
Under Kansas conditions, Throckmorton and Salmon (39) 
state that heavy rainfall is necessary for early growth 
but that, while dry weather is favorable at blossoming 
time, heavy rains, high temperatures and hot winds 
prevent fertilization and reduce the set of seed. 

Similar weather to that given for Kansas is favored by 
McClymonds (24) in Idaho. However, he believes that dry 
weather in the spring is best. 

In Canada, Sigfusson (28) reports that the most 
profitable crops of seed are obtained in the drier parts 
of Manitoba, and Southworth (34) concludes that the more 
arid conditions prevailing at the Manitoba Agricultural

College were responsible for higher seed yields as 
compared to his former experience (33) at the Ontario 
Agricultural College. Dwyer (11) states that in 
Australia very dry and very humid areas are alike un¬ 
favorable to seed-setting. At Aberystwyth, Wales, 
Williams (44) reports a high yield during a hot dry 
summer as compared to a cold wet one, and Helmbold (18) 
considers that humid weather is unfavorable in Germany. 
Helmbold, however, believes that, while bad weather 
results in a reduction of bloom, its main effect is on 
the prevention of insect visits. 

The Effect of Density of Stand and Soil Conditions 


Another factor influencing seed yields is the 
density of the stand. Englebert (14) and Sigfusson (28) 
found that thin stands gave the best yields. McClymonds 
(24) obtained similar results and concluded that a maximum 
of the plant should be exposed to light and air. Spencer 
and Stewart (36) report that alfalfa in rows gave increased 
yields over solid stands, and spacing within the rows gave 
further increases. However, while thin seeding usually 
gave better yields, Carlson (6) states that it was equalled 
by thick seeding in good years. 

Soil conditions have been discussed by Spencer 
and Stewart (36). They concluded that the soil should

not be highly fertile since extreme vegetative growth might 
occur at the expense of seed yield. Heavy applications of 
manure were unfavorable and soils deficient in lime were 
not suitable. Englebert (14) found up to 80% of brown 
or blasted seeds in certain areas, and decided that it 
was due to a sandy soil which allowed the water to escape 
too quickly. Martin (22) also has found that aborted 
seeds are usually associated with drought conditions. 

Development of Floral Parts and Embryonic Growth 


Considerable research has been done by certain 
writers on the development of the floral parts of 
alfalfa and the embryonic growth of the seed. Cooper 
(10) found that the embryo sac developed normally into 
an eight-nucleate, seven-celled structure. The fusion 
of the polar nuclei was not noted before fertilization, 
and it was found that the antipodal cells persisted 
until shortly before this event. Similar results were 
obtained by Reeves (27) except that he reports the dis¬ 
appearance of the antipodal cells long before the embryo 
sac reached maturity. These workers both found fertiliza¬ 
tion occurring between 24 and 32 hours after pollination, 
and the formation of two- or three-celled embryos at 
about 31 hours. Cooper (10), however, followed the 
process further and noted two- to four-celled embryos at

48 hours; five- to six-celled embryos at 72 hours; and 
four- to twelve-celled embryos at 120 hours. Thus he 
demonstrated rather wide variations in embryonic growth 
rates. He also found, in unfertilized embryo sacs, that 
disintegration of the cytoplasm had commenced at the 
72 hour period, and that it was complete, and the embryo 
sacs greatly shrunken, at 120 hours. 

Martin (22) concluded that neither soil nor 
atmospheric moisture inhibited the development of ovules 
and that aborted seeds were due to arrested embryonic 
development. Aborted embryos have also been reported 
by Stevenson and Kirk (37) in self-fertilized lines of 
M. media . 

Arrested bud development or bud-blasting has 
been reported by Carlson (6) and Sorenson (32). Both 
writers believe this to be caused by insect activity and 
particularly by thrips. Carlson considers that it may 
be a significant cause of yield decrease, especially in 
thick stands and rank growth. He also notes that the 
amount of bud-blasting in adjacent strains suggests 
differences in resistance to insect attacks. 

Other observations by Carlson (4) concern the 
age of the flower and the survival of the pods set. He 
found that flowers one or two days in full bloom had the 
best chance of being fertilized. He also noted that 75%

of the pods set survive until harvest. His results further 
indicated that if 30 to 35% of the flowers set pods a good 
crop was obtained; 15 to 20% was not profitable, and 5 to 
10% was a practical failure. 

The Nature and Viability of Pollen as Related 
to Seed-setting 


In respect to the amount and viability of the 
pollen there is a fairly good agreement among various 
workers. Armstrong and White (2) noted a few plants 
which produced a medium or scarce quantity of pollen. 

They also noted pollen sterility resulting in a lower 
number of seeds per pod. Plants deficient in viable 
pollen were also deficient in the amount of pollen and 
in anther dehiscence. A definite relationship between 
the amount of pollen and the fertility of the plant was 
found, but they state that pollen was sufficiently 
abundant for fertilization in both high and low seed¬ 
setting types. Englebert (14) reports high percentages 
of non-viable pollen in sterile plants, and also plants 
with very little pollen or sterile anthers. She considered 
that vigorous and rapid germination of the pollen was 
associated with fertility, but that 22.5% of sterile 
pollen was unimportant if the amount was large. Clarke

and Fryer (8) found that the percentage of sterile pollen 
grains varied for different plants hut remained constant 
for the same plant under widely different greenhouse 
conditions. When plants selected in the field on 
evidence of sterility were examined they found per¬ 
centages of sterile grains running from 50$ to 90$. 

Following extensive experiments on pollen 
germination, Martin (22) concludes that germination of 
the pollen is dependent upon a proper relationship 
between atmospheric moisture and moisture supplied by 
the stigma. He obtained no germination at 100$ humidity. 
Southworth (34) considers that the pollen should be 
mature but not too old. 

The structure and content of the pollen of M. 
sativa has been described by Martin (23) and Reeves (26). 
It was found to contain much protein but no sugar, and 
starch was absent in mature grains. Fully developed 
grains contain a tube nucleus and a generative nucleus. 

Pollen-tube Growth Within the Pistil of Alfalfa 


Very little has been published on pollen-tube 
grov/th within the pistil of alfalfa. Armstrong and 
White (2) found, after a study of stigmas six to eight 
hours after pollination, that penetration was negligible

in untripped flowers, but had occurred in 84% of the 
tripped flowers. They conclude, however, that while 
penetration is somewhat better in fertile plants, the 
differences could not v/holly account for discrepancies 
in seed-setting. Cooper (10) found an abundance of 
pollen-tubes in the ovaries of fertile plants between Z1 
and 48 hours after pollination, but states that only one- 
half or less of the ovules show pro-embryos at this time, 
Carlson (6) also reports that the average yield is only 
four to five seeds per pod, whereas the potential ovules 
are from three to four times that number. 

Tripping as Related to Fertilization 


Tripping, or the release of the staminal column 
is an adaptation of the alfalfa flower which is very 
probably intimately related to seed-setting capacity. 

The morphology of the flower in relation to the tripping 
mechanism has been fully described and discussed by Ufer 
(41) and Armstrong and White (3)* 

In regard to the ability of alfalfa to pollinate 

and set seed without tripping there is some disagreement 
in the literature. Coffman (9) found that practically 
all alfalfa flowers dehisce their anthers before the 
"hooded bud" stage, and Englebert (14) states that

always show dehisced anthers and the stigma more or less 
covered with pollen. Carlson (4, 5) found, under natural 
development, that tripping occurred only to the extent of 
10.8$ while 37$ of the flowers set pods. Thus he concludes 
that under conditions in the Uintah basin of Utah, alfalfa 
tends to set seed rather freely in the absence of 
tripping. Kirk and Y/hite (21) report that pollination 
occurs in the early bud stage and that some plants, 
under greenhouse conditions, set seed freely without 
tripping. Piper et al (25), however, state that 
pollination is accomplished by a release of the staminal 
column, and Heimbold (18) and Ufer (41) report that 
fertilization never takes place without tripping. 

A recent article by Armstrong and White (2) 
presents evidence which may assist in the interpretation 
of former results. In about 80$ of the flowers examined 
in the erect standard stage, they found anthers dehisced 
and the stigma partly or wholly covered with pollen. 
However, they report a thin hyaline membrane covering 
the stigma of untripped flowers, and they believe that 
rupture of this film, by tripping or other means, is 
necessary before penetration of the pollen-tubes can 
take place. It was further noted that pollen tubes did 
not penetrate when they were germinated on untripped

stigmas at 100$ humidity, and that flowers tripped 
following clipping of the standard set few pods. Unlike 
Piper et al (25) these writers found a marked improvement 
in seed-setting when stigmas were scarified with a tooth¬ 
pick or Camel*s-hair brush. 

The Effect of Artificial Tripping on Yield 


It has been the general experience of 
investigators that artificial tripping gives greater 
seed yields over natural tripping. Hay (17) reports 
marked increases in a year when general seed-setting was 
poor. Clarke and Fryer (8) obtained 50$ more seed and 
also note that enclosure in glassine bags did not affect 
the amount set, if the flowers had already been tripped. 
Southworth (35), after two years of tests, reports no 
seed from untripped flowers but an abundance was obtained 
after tripping. Piper et al (25) found about 100$ 
increase following artificial tripping, and Tysdal and 
Clark (40) obtained approximately 50$ more seed under 
greenhouse conditions. Ufer (41) states that untripped 
flowers eventually wither and fall off, and Frausden in 
Denmark, reported by Carlson (5), obtained 400$ 
increases in pods set following artificial tripping. 
Carlson, from his own results, concludes that artificial

tripping not only improves yield but also tends to 
equalize the yields for different years. 


The Effect of Climatic Factors on Tripping 


Since tripping is so beneficial to seed yield 
it is interesting to consider the effect of climatic 
factors on this process in relation to the general 
weather conditions which have been found favorable to 
good crops of seed. It will be noted that, in general, 
factors associated with arid conditions are favorable to 
tripping, while factors tending to produce humidity have 
the opposite effect. 

Southworth (35) and Piper et al (25) concluded 
that wind or rain caused little or no tripping. Dwyer 
and Allman (12) consider rain unimportant since they have 
shown pollen to be inviable under excessive moisture. 
Helmbold (18) reports that vigorous shaking of the 
branches had no effect, but Ufer (42) found that wind 
tended to increase the favorable effect of heat. However, 
he attributed this fact to the probable drying action. 

The effect of heat has been extensively tested 

by Ufer (42) . The general conclusion is that heat 
causes tripping and if combined ?/ith a drying action, 
the process is accelerated. Drying of itself did not

cause tripping, Dwyer and Allman (12) found that alfalfa 
flowers tripped instantaneously at temperatures ranging 
between 100°F. and 108°F. The effect was similar whether 
dry heat, steam, or hot water was used. Englebert (14), 
Piper et al (25), Ufer (42) and Dwyer and Allman (12) 
have all found that tripping is readily initiated by 
exposing the flowers to direct heat supplied by a 
lighted match, cigarette or burning-glass. 

The effect of sunlight - undoubtedly its heating 
action - has been observed. Piper et al (25) state that 
automatic tripping is most frequent in bright sunshine, 
and that it was also very frequent when flowers were 
brought from the shade into direct sunlight. Dwyer (11) 
found that shaded flowers did not trip well. Armstrong 
and White (2) report that duration and intensity of 
sunlight are responsible for automatic tripping, and 
that artificial light did not compensate for sunlight 
under greenhouse conditions. Ufer (41) likewise considers 
that tripping is governed by the duration of hours of 
sunshine, and also by fluctuations in temperature. 

Helmbold (18), however, believes that neither sunlight 
nor wind, combined with pronounced dryness of the air, 
will cause tripping.

The Effect of Insects on Tripping 


A large number of observations have been 
recorded on the activities of insects in relation to 
tripping. Southworth (33) concludes that they are the 
limiting factor in alfalfa seed production, since he 
obtained no seed when they were excluded. Certain 
insects, for instance bumble-bees and leaf-cutting bees, 
are regarded by Piper et al (25), McClymonds (24), 
Englebert (14) and lifer (41) as being effective in 
tripping. Piper et al and Ufer also state that moths, 
butterflies and night-flying insects have a negligible 
effect. Helmbold (18) notes that honey-seeking insects 
are ineffective, but that the same insects when gathering 
pollen may cause self-pollination. The effect of the 
ordinary honey-bee is generally considered to be little 
or none. Ufer (41) made many observations of individual 
honey-bees and concludes that they are unimportant as a 
tripping agent. Southworth (34) and McClymonds (24) 
state that honey-bees were never noted to trip any 
flowers. Piper et al (25) and Englebert (14) consider 
their effect negligible. However, Dwyer and Allman (13) 
disagree with these conclusions in regard to honey-bees 
and are inclined to place them among the important agents 
which cause tripping. Their statements are based on 
general observations and caging experiments, and they

suggest that the failure of other observers to credit 
these insects with tripping has been caused by observations 
made when the flowers were not in a suitable physiological 
condition. 

Plant Individuality and Flower Structure 
as Related to Tripping 


Differences in individual plants is a factor 
which may have an important effect on tripping. Piper 
et al (25), McClymonds (24) and Ufer (42) report that 
plants vary widely in the ease with which their flowers 
are tripped. In a comparison of sterile and fertile 
plants, Armstrong and ?/hite (2) found that the fertile 
ones greatly excelled the others in the extent of self¬ 
tripping. They concluded that this factor largely 
determines the differentiation of fertile and sterile 
types. 

Armstrong and White (2) also studied the floral 
anatomy in relation to tripping. Differences were found 
in the length of the anterior wing processes and their 
degree of adherence to the keel, as well as in the size 
and tension of the staminal column. They conclude that 
these variations are important factors in determining 
the degree of automatic tripping.

The Mode of Pollination in Alfalfa and the 
Effect of Selfing on Seed Yield 


Very little appears to be known of the actual 
amount of self- and cross-pollination which occurs in 
alfalfa under field conditions. Kirk (BO) states that, 
although it is largely cross-fertilized, self-fertilization 
takes pjace to a considerable extent. Williams (44) 
reports that alfalfa is largely cross-pollinated, and he 
found a few plants which were more or less completely 
self-incompatible. Dwyer (11), however, finds that 
alfalfa is mostly self-pollinated. He also noted delayed 
tripping and considers that this, together with wind, may 
be important in effecting cross-pollination. 

If cross-fertilization is the normal mode of 
sexual behavior in alfalfa, it is to be expected that 
selfing would result in pronounced reduction in variability, 
and perhaps an accompanying loss in vigor. Tysdal and 
Clark (40) report a selfing programme up to the fourth 
generation. They found few lines in the first generation 
which were high seed producers, but segregation occurred 
later, and in the fourth generation some lines exceeded 
the original stock. Yield of forage tended to be 
maintained with seed yields in these tests. Stewart (38) 
found marked decreases in variability following selfing 
in many of the morphological characters studied. Due

to first generation selfing, approximately 50$ decrease 
in yield is reported by Carlson (6), although little 
further reduction was evident in the second generation. 
Kirk (19) found 19$ reduction of seed yield in the first 
28$ in the second; and 47$ in the third generation of 
selfing. However, he also noted some lines in the third 
generation which gave no significant decrease from the 
parent stock. In a later publication, (20), he reports 
70$ sterility in the second, and almost complete 
sterility in the fourth generation. Williams (43) 
reports a marked decrease in variability in the first 
generation of selfing and also a very marked decrease in 
vegetative vigor, which was most pronounced between the 
first and second generation selfings. He concludes (44) 
that, even after loss in vigor has been compensated, 
selfing results in a marked decrease of fertility in 
alfalfa. Spencer and Stewart (36) and Dwyer (11) also 
report a tendency for good seed-setting types to be poor 
forage producers. 

The Effect of Selfing on Pollen Sterility 


Inbreeding has also been noted to have an 
effect on pollen sterility. Armstrong and White (2) 
state that increases in pollen sterility were noted for 
each succeeding generation of inbreeding. Carlson (6)

reports the work of Torse 11 who concluded that pollen 
sterility was the chief cause of the reduction in 
fertility where selfing had been practised in alfalfa. 
Successive reduction was noted with inbreeding until a 
point was reached where no further loss of pollen 
fertility was noted. 

The Effect of Cross-pollination on 
Alfalfa Seed Yields 


Since inbreeding, in general, appears to cause 
marked decreases in seed-setting, it might be expected 
that in a partially cross-fertilized crop, such as alfalfa, 
artificial cross-pollination would give opposite results, 
and this has been the experience of all investigators. 
Carlson (6) obtained 44% pods set for artificial 
tripping (selfing) and 54% for artificial cross-pollina¬ 
tion. When selfed lines were allowed to open-pollinate 
he recorded a gain of about 15% which he attributes to 
hybrid vigor. Where fertilization takes place without 
tripping, he suggests that thrips may effect cross- 
pollination. Carlson (5) also reports the work of Fransden 
who obtained ratios of 1:5.8 for natural tripping 
compared to artificial tripping, and 1:6.9 for natural 
tripping compared to cross-pollination. While natural 
and artificial tripping gave approximately the same number

of seeds per pod, a gain of 246 % was reported in favor 
of cross-pollination, Dwyer and Allman (IS) obtained a 
better quality of seed when plants were caged with bees 
and they attribute this to more efficient cross-pollination. 
According to Bnglebert (14), two self-sterile plants set 
seed when cross-pollinated, although one other did not. 

Piper et al (25) found that cross-pollination increased 
the number of pods and the number of seeds per pod, and 
also that there were little differences in the results of 
cross-pollination between plants and between varieties. 

It has been found by Helmbold (18) that geitonogamy, or 
artificial cross-fertilization between floY/ers on the 
same plant, has the same effect as self-fertilization. 
Accordingly, he removed the pollen from a number of flowers 
and tested the effect of ordinary cross-pollination and 
geitonogamy. The latter gave only about 70 to 75 % of the 
seed-setting obtained by artificial cross-pollination. 

The Inheritance of Seed-setting in Alfalfa 


Although no genetical data are available on the 
subject of seed-setting in alfalfa, it is evident from the 
results of inbreeding and cross-pollination that the 
character is inherited. Helmbold (18) states that it is 
an individual characteristic conditioned by internal

generative causes, and he found marked differences in 
different plants. Southworth (25) found that the ability 
to set seed when tripped varied with individual plants 
and Kirk (19) found that seed-setting was not necessarily 
associated with forage yield. Similarly, Ufer (42) 
found that ease of tripping was not necessarily associated 
with fertility. Carlson (6) reports that seed production 
between varieties and strains varies widely and, as 
previously mentioned, he believed this evidence of hybrid 
vigor. 


The Use of Hybridization in Obtaining 
Higher Seed Yields 


In view of the variability among alfalfa plants 
it has been felt by some investigators that a hybridization 
and selfing programme may be valuable in obtaining higher 
seed-setting strains. Southworth (S3) concluded that 
interspecific hybridization between M. sativa and M. 
lupulina offered the best possibilities. After some 
years of selection he claimed (35) to have indications 
of a suitable strain derived from this cross. Stewart 
(38), however, believes that the great decreases which 
he obtained in variability through selfing, suggest good 
opportunities for hybridization and selection within the 
commonly cultivated varieties.

Summary of Literature Review 


To summarize briefly the review of literature 

which has been presented, a few points may be emphasized. 

It is evident that cultivated alfalfa is highly 
variable in seed-setting capacity, both in general and 
in regard to particular plants. The general variability 
may be due, at least partly, to mixtures in the original 
seed stocks of different ecological and morphological 
types. However, the particular differences between 
individual plants are very probably caused by differences 
in genetic factor combinations affecting fertility. The 
genes contributing to sterility would tend to be 
eliminated, or greatly reduced in numbers, in a self- 
fertilized plant, but not so in one, such as alfalfa, which 
shows evidence of considerable cross-pollination. 
Experiments on self-pollination support this belief - for 
example, the increase of pollen sterility in selfed lines. 

The effect of climate is also very important. 
However, its influence on seed yield is, probably, mainly 
secondary and due to the action of climatic factors on 
tripping, and on the activity of insects which effect 
tripping. 

Structural and anatomical differences between 
plants have also been demonstrated, and it is quite 
possible that they may have a vital bearing on the solution 
of the problem.

GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS 


Under this heading, reference is made to 
materials and methods applicable to all, or almost all, 
of the tests. Those attending particular experiments are 
given in the sections to which they specifically apply• 
Plants were selected with the object of 
obtaining two groups representing the extremes of seed¬ 
setting capacity. Prom a block of spaced progenies, 
twenty-one plants were chosen, which previously had been 
under observation for three or four years. Ten of these 
were rated as highly sterile, and the remainder were known 
to set seed abundantly under Edmonton conditions. 

The information relating to the origin and the 
two main morphological characters of each plant is 
summarized in Table I. The classification of each as to 
fertility or sterility is also included. As this table 
might suggest, the selection was based on ?«rhether or not 
the plants were good seed setters. 

In the fall of 1934 the plants were transplanted, 
each into a glazed earthenware crock with a hole at the 
base for drainage and containing about one cubic foot of 
soil. They were then stored in a root cellar to give 
them a dormant period. About the end of December they 
were removed to a greenhouse and kept at optimum moisture

conditions and at a temperature of approximately 75°F. 
Artificial light was used to supplement daylight until 
about the end of March, 

On May 7, 1935, all plants were transplanted 
to the field and spaced at a distance of four feet each 
way. A screenhouse was constructed to enclose completely 
the plot. This latter measure was adopted as a precaution 
against insect pollination at any period when experiments 
were being carried out. 

In all samples the flowers were fully opened 
and not more than three days old. Hienever yield was 
tested or pollen-tube growth studied, the flowers were 
artificially tripped in order to eliminate variation in 
fertility due to this factor. When a killing agent was 
required, a solution of 6 cc. of formalin added to 100 cc. 
of 70% alcohol was employed. This fixative may have had 
disadvantages in the subsequent staining of the material; 
however, it proved very convenient when many samples were 
taken over a fairly long interval, since the flowers could 
be left in it until it was desired to study them. 

In the statistical analysis of results Fisher’s 
analysis of variance (15) was used throughout. However, 
in computing significances the table of "F" values 
prepared by Snedecor (31) was used. A further modification 
was Snedecor’s method of calculating variance when the

numbers of individuals in different samples are unequal. 
This was necessary for the analyses of data on the 
percentage of pods set and the number of seeds per pod. 
Wherever comparisons of any two means were made, 
differences of at least twice the standard error of the 
difference were considered significant. 

PERCENTAGE OF PODS SET 


Twenty plants were used in this test, nine of 
which had originally been classified in the sterile group. 
On each plant approximately three hundred flowers 

representing about thirty racemes were tested. One-third 
of these were tripped on July 29 and the remainder on 
August 9. After all buds and untripped flowers had been 
removed, and the remaining flowers artificially tripped, 
each raceme was tagged with the date and the number of 
flowers tripped. Both lots v/ere harvested September 5, 
1935. The pods set on each raceme were counted and the 
number expressed as a percentage of the original number 
of tripped flowers. A summary of mean data is given 
in Table II, and in Table III the statistical analysis 
of the variance is presented.

Note : All "F" values are derived by mean square for 
variation/mean square for error. 


Highly significant variation for all factors 
tested is indicated by the statistical analysis. 

Due to the unequal sampling, a standard error 
applicable to any two means cannot be given. However, a 
range for this experiment may be stated which is 
derived as follows: 

The S.E. of a single determination = lean square for error 

= /256.5S 
= 16.02$ 


Considering the column in Table II representing 
the mean percentage of pods for both dates - 

The S.E. of the difference of any two means 
is 


equal to ^/ ^16.02 | 2 + s 


where N^ and Ng are the number of racemes for any two 
different plants.

Thus, the S.E. of the difference between the

V[ V ) 

the standard error of the difference of any other two 
means cannot exceed this value. 

Similarly, the S.E. of the difference between 
the two means containing the greatest values for N is 

3.44%, and the standard error 


n 


16.02) 2 + | 16.02) 2 


) 




of the difference of any other two means cannot be less 
than this value. 

Since twice the standard error is considered 
significant, then differences greater than 5.09 x 2 = 10.18% 
may be regarded as significant in all cases, and those 
less than 3.44 x 2 = 6.88% as not significant. 

It is apparent that the greatest variable is 
the individual plant. It is also evident that these 
variations occur between plants within a group, as well 
as between the sterile and fertile classes. Since the 
material was selected to obtain extreme differences, it 
is very likely that all gradations in percentage of 
pods set would have been obtained had a larger, and 
random, sample been taken. 

The variation due to dates is difficult to 
explain, especially since it occurs in either direction; 
that is, while most of the values for particular plants 
are higher for the first date, some of them are lower 
and vice versa. However, as indicated, the general

tendency is toward higher yields for the first date. 

It is possible that the weather subsequent to tripping 
offers a partial explanation. On July SI a steady rain 
commenced and continued for over twenty-four hours; 

1.61 inches of rain fell. This was followed by 0.32 
inches, August 4; 1.08, August 13; 0.21, August 17, and 
only light showers from then on. Thus it may be 
concluded that the pods set following the first date 
would be in a more favorable position for soil moisture 
than those set after August 9. The warm dry weather 
predominating during the middle and latter part of August 
would likely be favorable for automatic tripping, but 
not necessarily so for the development of pods. It has 
been reported by Alter (1), Englebert (14) and others, 
that rain following fertilization helps to increase 
yields. It is also suggested that the age of the season’s 
growth of the plant may have had some effect as, while 
the second date was less than two weeks after the first, 
it was very close to the end of the flowering period for 
the season. 

The interaction between plants and dates is 
interesting. A study of mean differences shows it to be 
mainly caused by plants in the fertile class. This may 
be explained by the fact that plants in the sterile 
group set so few pods, on either date, that differences 
in their reactions would tend to be masked. It is

possible that the variability of plants in the fertile 
group may have been partially caused by the position of 

the racemes. On the second date, it was frequently 
difficult to secure enough exposed flowers to make up the 
required two hundred and occasionally racemes obscured by 
shading were employed. Thus differences in the amount of 
shading and consequent variations in temperature may have 
affected the set of pods to some extent. 

THE NUMBER OF SEEDS PER POD 


After the pods obtained in the previous 
experiment had been counted, they were decolorized in 
70 % alcohol. With the use of a strong transmitted light, 
the number of seeds in each pod was easily counted. 

Since the numbers of pods obtained from plants in the 
sterile group were not large enough to provide an adequate 
sample, they were not included in this study, A summary 
of the data obtained is given in Table IV. 

The statistical analysis is presented in Table 
V. A highly significant variation for plants and also 
for dates is indicated, but plant and date interaction is 
not significant. As in the former experiment on the 
percentage of pods set, the significance of the difference 
between means representing the number of seeds per pod for 
both dates varies, according to the total number of pods 
analyzed for each plant. However, as previously stated,

In view of the results obtained for the 
percentages of pods set, it is probably to be expected 
that the number of seeds per pod should vary for both 
plants and dates. One might assume that factors tending 
to increase or decrease pod-setting would have a similar 
effect on the number of seeds per pod, since both pod¬ 
setting and seed-setting are necessarily dependent on 
fertilization. 

The fact that plant and date interaction is 
not significant indicates that each plant maintained 
relatively the same reaction for both dates. This 
suggests that the number of seeds per pod is less 
likely to be affected by environmental conditions than 
is the percentage of pods set. It has been noted in 
the literature review that Carlson (6) found that only 
about 75 % of the pods set survive until harvest. It 
is likely that the other were lost because of 
unfavorable environmental conditions. However, the 
number of seeds in the surviving pods would not 
necessarily be affected in the same way. Thus, if it 
can be established that the number of seeds per pod 
remains relatively stable, it may prove a more reliable 
index of inherent fertility than either the percentage 
of pods at harvest time, or the total seed yield.

THE PRODUCTION OF ABORTED SEEDS AND BLASTED BUDS 


Aborted Seeds 


In the data summarized in Table IY, all seeds 

which were recognizable as such are included. At the 

same time a record was kept of poorly developed or 
abortive seeds since they formed an important part of 

the total in some plants. The size of these seeds 
ranged from remnants, which could barely be seen with the 
naked eye, up to those which had attained about one-half 
normal size before growth had stopped. 

The origin of these seeds is a problem which 
may be important in the development of high seed-producing 
strains. When only plants in the fertile group were 
considered it was found that about 4% of the total seeds 
were abortive. This proportion would be quite 
appreciable in a crop of alfalfa seed, and would tend to 
decrease quality as well as yield. 

The full data are included in Table VI. They 
are not presented as conclusive results, but rather as 
an indication of what is likely to be encountered in 
selective breeding for seed production. The seeds 
obtained from the second date were not always fully 
mature, and it was rather difficult to classify them at

times. However, it is noteworthy that abortive or blasted 
seeds are not confined to plants selected for evidence 
of sterility, and also that their presence cannot well 
be attributed to environmental effects. Martin (22) and 
Englebert (14) have suggested that they are caused by 
unfavorable soil or moisture conditions. But as this 
experiment shows, there are individual plant differences 
which are quite probably caused by inherent genetical 
defects. It seems possible that zygotic lethals or 
inhibitor factors may be largely responsible. Particular 
attention is drawn to plant 33-4. In this instance, the 
ratio of normal to abortive seeds fits very closely a 

13:3 inhibitor-factor ratio. It will be interesting to 
test this plant further in regard to its genetical 
constitution for abortive seeds. 

Bud Blasting 


It may be noted in the description of plants 
used in this investigation (Table I) that one plant 
designated 10-20 is not included in any of the subsequent 
experiments. An abundance of buds were produced both in 
the greenhouse and in the field, but only about two 
racemes eventually developed flowers. The buds usually

attained the straight bud stage and then withered. 

Carlson (6) and Sorenson (32) have noted this condition 
in alfalfa and ascribe it to insect damage. However, 
insects were not noted to be numerous on this individual 
and, since it received the same treatment as the other 
plants, it is likely that, in this instance, bud blasting 
was caused by an inherent defect. 

PGLIEN YIABIUTY 


In the testing of pollen viability on stigmas, 
germination was allowed to proceed for two hours after 
tripping. The flowers were then fixed in the killing 
solution. The stigmas were dissected, placed on a 
microscope slide and then stained as described by 
Chandler (7) for pistils with a central canal. Pressure 
on the cover glass exposed the pollen tubes so that they 
could be counted. Conclusive data are not yet available 
from this study. 

The viability of pollen as evidenced by its 
germination on an artificial medium was tested in the 
following manner. After trying various concentrations 
of sugar it was found that 12$ cane sugar added to 1 
agar-agar gave the best results. The medium was poured 
into a Syracuse dish, allowed to cool, and a sample of

pollen from one plant was dusted upon it immediately. 

The dish was then covered and kept at room temperature 
for two hours. It was then placed in a cooling chamber 

at about 0°C. until it could be counted. A few drops 
of a weak solution of methylene blue placed on the 
medium just before a count was taken facilitated the 
process. 

Since the amount of pollen in the anthers of 
different plants varied, no set number of flowers was 
used to obtain a sample. Usually from five to ten were 
sufficient. One hundred counts were taken from each dish 
using a low power objective and 10X oculars. Only grains 
showing unmistakable evidence of germination were classed 
as viable. For convenience in computation the one 
hundred counts taken from a sample were grouped at random 
into ten groups for each plant. The total number of 
pollen grains tested in this way ranged from four 
hundred to fourteen hundred according to the plant under 

test. The average was from eleven to twelve hundred per 
plant. Samples were taken on March 26, 1935, while the 
plants were in the greenhouse, and to represent field 
conditions, a further set of data was obtained on July 8, 
1935. Unfortunately a method of measuring the amount of 
pollen produced was not devised and estimates only, of 
this factor, are presented. A summary of results is 
given in Table VII, and the statistical analysis is

Since the number of samples for each plant 
was the same, it is possible to give a significance 
value for any two means. If differences between plants 
for the mean percentage germination for the totals of 
both dates is considered, 3*83% may be regarded as 
significant. For differences between means of the two 
dates, values of 7.64% are significant. 

The variability of plants with regard to 
pollen viability is very striking. It is noticeable that 
plants in the fertile group are higher in percentage 
germination than those in the sterile class and that, in 
many instances, these differences are very wide. The 
only exception is plant 43-29. It appears that a low 
percentage of viable pollen is related to sterility - at 
least in some plants. However, the relationship is not 
very pronounced and certainly cannot account for the wide 
difference exhibited between the two groups in the 
percentage of pods set. Where plants have been estimated 
to have a low amount of pollen they also tend to be low 
in the percentage of viable pollen, and it is possible 
that these two factors may be related. 

If the results of this experiment are compared 
with those given in Table II, it will be found that a 
fairly close agreement exists between the percentage of 
viable pollen and the percentage of pods set - if plants

in the sterile group are considered. However, there 
appears to he no relationship between the two ratings 
if one considers plants in the fertile class alone. 

Thus, it is very likely that, after a certain level has 

been reached, the percentage of viable pollen has little 
or no effect on fertility. These conclusions agree with 

those of other investigators. Armstrong and White (2) 
state that pollen was usually abundant enough for 
fertilization in both high and low seed-setting types, 
and Englebert (14) concluded that 22.5$ of sterile 
pollen was unimportant if the amount was large. 

The lower pollen germination secured from 
samples taken under field conditions is difficult to 
explain, and this is also true of the plant and date 
interaction. However, it is believed that one class of 
non-germinating pollen may afford an explanation. Two 
types were noted. One of these consisted of small, clear 
grains. As previously noted, this class of pollen has 
been studied by Clarke and J^ryer (8) and found to remain 
constant in amount for a given plant under wide 
environmental variations. The other type was composed 
of normal-appearing grains. It is possible that this 
latter type might have germinated if a different medium 
had been used. However, it is also reasonable to assume 
that it may have been more sensitive to changes in 
conditions and consequently its viability more or less 
adversely affected by unfavorable variations in the

POLLEN-TUBE GROWTH WITHIN THE PISTIL 


For the study of pollen-tube growth within the 
pistil, material was collected at two different periods. 
The procedure at each period was to trip sufficient 

flowers on each plant for the experiment. Different lots 
of about ten flowers were taken at successive intervals 
after pollination, and killed and fixed in the formalin- 
alcohol solution. The intervals for the first period 
were 2%-, 5, 8, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, 43 and 49 hours - and 
for the second period 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, 27, 30, 
33, 36, 40 and 48 hours after pollination. Variations of 
temperature and of relative humidity were recorded by 
means of a thermo-hydrograph. 

After the material had been collected, it was 
embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained and mounted in 
Canada balsam. The sections were then examined with a 
low power objective and 10X oculars. Due to the hard 
tissue composing the outer part of the style, fresh 
material could not be examined by the staining-and- 
crushing method. It was also found that dehydration 
with n-butyl alcohol, recommended by Zirkle (45), 
improved the staining properties of the material, as

compared with staining after ordinary ethyl alcohol. 

Much difficulty was met in finding a suitable 
stain. This may have been due to the killing solution 
since formalin-alcohol is not usually considered a 
satisfactory fixing agent to be followed by the best 
stains. However, it was found that acid fuchsin gave 
very good differentiation in the stigma and ovary, 
although it was seldom possible to trace pollen tubes 
within the central and lower parts of the style. The 
following schedule for staining and mounting was devised: 

1 fo aqueous acid fuchsin - 1 to 2 hours.

It was necessary to use distilled water (pH 4.7) through¬ 
out as tap water (pH 7.7) removed the stain in the water 
changes. 

Because of the labor involved in the use of 
the paraffin method only three plants were studied. 

These differed widely in their seed-setting capacity. 
Plant 8-28 was one of the most fertile on test; 6-33 set 
a very low percentage of pods, and 1-12 had set no pods.

In obtaining the data summarized in Table IX 
only material collected at the first four intervals of 

each period was used. An examination of this table shows 
that the figures for plant 8-28 are higher than for plant 
6-33, both in the number of stigmas penetrated and the 
number of pollen tubes penetrating. However, the 
differences do not seem sufficient to account for the 
marked spread in fertility between the two. Plant 1-12 
is very low throughout but, on the basis of penetration

of growth of the pollen tubes as measured by the time 
at which they penetrated the ovary. The differences are 
quite marked for the July 31st period and if the number 
of pollen tubes present, at the interval when penetration 
was first noted, is considered, there are also apparent 
differences between the plants during the August 6th 
period. However, these latter variations may not be 
very significant. At any rate, it appears that under 
the more favorable conditions prevailing at the August 
6th period, difference in rate of gro?rfch of pollen tubes, 
between plants, tended to lessen. 

It is apparent that, while the variation between 
plants is the most noticeable, there are also definite 
differences in the same plant between the two periods. 
Examination of the temperature and relative humidity 
records given in Figure 1 offers an explanation. The 
material collected during the first period was pollinated 
at 4.30 p.m., July 31st, and was followed by about two 
days of wet weather. On the other hand, the material 
secured during the August 6th period, was pollinated at 
8.00 a.m. Wide fluctuations in temperature and humidity 
followed pollination, and these differences are 
particularly noticeable if attention is confined to the 
first four intervals when most of the penetration of the 
stigmas and ovaries took place. It is probable that 
either temperature or humidity conditions contributed

favorably to the rate of pollen-tube growth during the 
second period. 

Buchholz and Blakeslee (3) found a steady 
increase in the rate of pollen-tube growth in Datura 
Stramonium from 52°F. up to a maximum at 92°F. Smith 
and Cochrane (30) found 70°F. to 85°F. to be the optimum 
range for pollen-tube growth in the tomato. In view of 
these results it seems probable that temperatures of 
slightly over 70°F. may have accelerated the rate of 
pollen-tube growth in alfalfa as compared to a 
temperature of approximately 55°F. 

The opposite reactions of plants 1-12 and 6-33 
during the two periods are interesting. It will be noted 
that the numbers of pollen tubes penetrating both the 
stigmas and ovaries of plant 1-12 were much higher during 
the July 31st period. The opposite reaction is evident 
in plant 6-33. It is possible that a combination of 
temperature and humidity conditions may account for 
these differences. Martin (22) and Armstrong and White 
(2) have shown high humidity to be favorable for pollen 
germination in alfalfa. Smith and Cochrane (30) have 
demonstrated that a high temperature, 85°F., was optimum 
for pollen germination in the tomato. Plant 6-33 is 
decumbent, and it is probable that at the time of the 
second pollination, a high humidity would be maintained

in the flowers, and this, combined with the higher 
temperatures prevailing at the second period, would 
likely be very favorable for pollen germination. On the 
other hand, plant 1-12 is very erect in its growth habit 
and consequently its flowers would be exposed to the 
drying action of the sunlight and wind to a greater 
degree than those of plant 6-33. Thus the lower 
moisture conditions in certain flowers may have overcome 
the favorable effect of higher temperatures. 

GENERAL DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 


In this investigation dealing with sterility 
in alfalfa two main objects have been kept in mind. The 
first has been to discover, if possible, more precisely 
the causes of sterility. The second has been to apply 
later the knowledge gained to a practical plant breeding 
programme. 

Perhaps the most striking general result is 
the wide degree to which different plants vary in 
fertility under the same conditions. This variability 
has been demonstrated in all the experiments conducted 
and in all the observations made. It has also been 
shown that, under differing conditions, the same plant 
may react differently, or it may tend to remain stable.

These two results point strongly to inherent genetical 
factors, as affecting fertility, which are more or less 
favorably accumulated in particular plants. 

The adverse effects of selfing may not be too 
important. It is noteworthy that some of the most 
fertile plants used in the investigation are the product 
of first or second generation selfing and that, as pre¬ 
viously stated, other workers have found very fertile 
plants in the fourth generation of inbreeding. 

The studies on the amount and viability of the 
pollen and on pollen-tube growth suggest that, in plants 
varying widely in seed-setting capacity, these factors 
may be important, and that they may also be important 
between plants in the sterile group. Where the amount 
of viable pollen is above a certain level variations in 
this may possibly be disregarded as a cause of 
sterility - provided, of course, it remains constant 
under limited, varying environmental conditions. However, 
it appears that no single feature of the pollen can 
wholly account for the extreme differences between 
sterile and fertile plants. It is also fairly evident 
that, in fertile plants, these effects may be relatively 
unimportant in differentiating small degrees of seed¬ 
setting ability.

The application of temperature and humidity 
records to the interpretation of the results obtained 
indicate that in certain plants, these factors may 
influence both pollen viability and pollen-tube pene¬ 
tration. This suggests that environmental factors may 
be very useful in the detection of unstable plants with 
constitutions unsuitable for breeding purposes. 

In view of the results obtained in these 
experiments it seems probable that the seed-setting 
variability of alfalfa stands may be caused by a large 
proportion of unstable individuals which require 
favorable external conditions in order to set seed 
freely. Thus, where adverse conditions are likely to 
occur, it would seem important to analyze carefully 
foundation stocks for their stability under different 
environmental factors. 


SUMMARY 


1. A review of the important literature 
relating to sterility in alfalfa has been presented. 

£. Plants classified as sterile or fertile 
varied widely in their capacity to set pods when the 
flowers had been artificially tripped. These

differences were maintained both within and between the 
two classes. 

3. Significant differences in the number of 
seeds per pod were found between plants in the fertile 
group. 

4. When the results for two dates of tripping 
were compared, the percentage of pods set and the 
number of seeds per pod were lower on the second date. 

It is suggested that soil moisture and age of the 

plant may have contributed somewhat to these differences• 

5. From the analysis of single plant reactions 
on different dates, evidence was obtained to show that, 
for very fertile plants, the number of seeds per pod 

may be a more reliable index of inherent seed-setting 
ability, than the percentage of pods set. 

6. Blasted buds and abortive seeds were found 
to characterize particular plants. 

7. The test of pollen germination on an 
artificial medium gave wide variations between different 
plants. Much higher germination was secured from plants 
in the greenhouse than from the same plants later 
growing in the field. Differences in plant reaction 

to the two conditions were also highly significant.

8. Two classes of sterile pollen were noted. 
One consisted of clear, empty-appearing grains, and the 
other was apparently normal except that it did not 
germinate. It is suggested that the latter type may 
have been normal pollen adversely affected by 
environmental factors - thus causing differences in 
plant reactions, and in the lower germination obtained 
under field conditions. 

9. Pollen-tube penetration of the stigma 
and ovary was studied. It was found to vary widely 
during two different periods when temperature and 
relative humidity conditions were markedly different. 
Differences in single plant reactions were also noted 
in this experiment. 

10. The effect of temperature and relative 
humidity on pollen germination and pollen-tube growth 
is discussed. It is believed that these two factors 
have important effects on the processes leading to 
fertilization. 

11. It is suggested that an accumulation of 
genes which contribute to fertility, may tend to main¬ 
tain the seed-setting stability of a plant even when 
environmental conditions may be somewhat unfavorable.
