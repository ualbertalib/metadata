INTRODUCTION 




Introduction 


Adsorption is a process in which molecules or atoms are bound to the 
surface of a substance. The former is known as the adsorbate and the latter, 
the adsorbent. The magnitude of the forces which bind the adsorbate to the 
adsorbent constitutes a criterion for differentiation between physical 
adsorption and chemisorption. The former is characterized by a weak inter¬ 
action between adsorbate and adsorbent, and is sometimes known as M Van der 
Waals rt adsorption, which implies forces involved similar to those encountered 
in condensation. Chemisorption involves energies similar to those found for 
chemical reactions. 

Because the sorption of gases on charcoals usually involves physical 
adsorption, the term adsorption, as used here will refer only to physical 
adsorption. 

Adsorption is a function of many variables: time; pressure or concentration 
temperature; and nature of the adsorbate and adsorbent. The determination of 
an adsorption isotherm eliminates the temperature variable. However, the nature 
of the adsorbate and the time variable may be complicating factors. 

Usually, pressure or concentration is the variable in the determination 
of an isotherm. This is only strictly correct for adsorbents which present the 
same surface areas to various gases. Such a condition seems most likely to be 
encountered with non-porous adsorbents. However, Emmett (1), and, Beebe, 
Beckwith, and Konig (2) have cast some doubt on this presumption. They have 
indicated that the same non-porous adsorbent areas are not equally available 
to large and small molecules. They explain the variation on the basis of 
differences in packing of the adsorbate molecules.

A porous adsorbent presents an entirely different situation. The 
larger portion of the surface area of such a substance constitutes the 
walls of the pores. These pores vary greatly in size and present a major 
problem in the measurement of surface area. That is; the larger pores 
can be entered by a variety of different sized molecules, whereas the 
smaller ones will exclude the larger molecules from access to their internal 
surfaces. This is known as seiving, or screening. The accessibility of the 
gas molecule to the internal surfaces of these pores is dependent upon 
whether the molecule is horizontally or vertically oriented, as proposed 
by Nay and Morrison (3). They suggest that in the case of horizontal 
orientation, molecular thickness governs the screening effect as opposed to 
molecular length in the case of vertical orientation. 

An outgrowth of the seiving effect is the use of molecular size as a 
criterion of pore size or vice-versa. However, the effects of screening 
and molecular packing are not separable, particularly for larger adsorbate 
molecules and for smaller pores. The effect of molecular size as shown by 
comparison of the amounts of various gases adsorbed can give some idea of the 
pore distribution. 

Activation may be described as a process by which the surface area of the 
adsorbent is increased. A coconut charcoal is usually activated by steam at 
high temperatures and pressures. As activation proceeds, the distribution and 
size of pores changes. It has been shown by Fineman, Guest, and McIntosh ( 4 ) 
that the lower activated charcoals have a larger proportion of finer pores. 
This is in agreement with the findings of Nay and Morrison. The latter have 
shown that at higher activations a variety of different sized molecules have 
access to the same internal surfaces.

The average area of an adsorbate molecule in a monomolecular film 
on the surface of the adsorbent is known as the effective adsorption area 
of the molecule. 

The calculation of the adsorption areas of various molecules and the 
concomitant surface area calculations of the adsorbent may be carried out 
in numerous ways, dependent upon which method gives the best agreement with 
the data on hand. In this particular case, * the Langmuir equation was 
found to afford the best treatment. A form of this equation is: 


V m b 


+ JP. 
7m 


d)) 


where: P = equilibrium pressure 

V = volume of gas adsorbed 

V m = volume of gas required to form a monolayer 
b » constant 

A plot of P/V versus P will be linear, of slope l/V m , and with an intercept 
of 1/V m b. 

Nay and Morrison also made use of this relationship. However, they 
noticed that the isotherms obtained possessed a slight curvature, concave to 
the pressure axis. The curvature was more pronounced with the lower activated 
charcoals and with the larger adsorbate molecules. In order to account for the 
curvature in the Langmuir plots, they suggested that two processes were 
occurring simultaneously; adsorption and diffusion of the adsorbate into the 
finer pores of the adsorbent. They attempted to resolve these processes by 
the use of a pressure versus time graph for each point on the isotherm. The 
accompanying figure indicates the general type of curve they obtained.

The region a to b was considered by them to represent both processes, but 
mainly adsorption. The region b to c was considered to be mainly diffusion. 
Accordingly, they selected b as the end point of the adsorption process. 

In order to measure molecular adsorption areas, v the volume of gas 
required to form a monomolecular film on the surface of the adsorbent is 
obtained from the slope of the Langmuir isotherm. Then the relationship:

6 = adsorption area of gas under investigation, 
is used to calculate molecular adsorption areas. 

Nay and Morrison have made the following observations regarding the 
lower activated charcoals. 

(1) Molecules thinner than the reference gas reach larger internal 
surfaces, resulting in lower adsorption areas as compared with 
the correct ones. 

(2) Molecules thicker than the reference gas do not reach the same 
internal surfaces, resulting in larger adsorption areas than the 



correct ones

Nitrogen is generally chosen as the reference gas because its adsorption 
area is accurately known. An absolute calorimetric method developed by 
Harkins and Jura (5), yields an adsorption area for molecular nitrogen of 

o2 

16.2 A on the basis of liquid packing at the boiling point of liquid 

nitrogen ( - 196 °C)• This value is in agreement with that arrived at by many 

others using a variety of methods. There has been some indication that 
°2 

15*4 A is a better value. Livingston (6), reviews much of the recent work 

°2 

in this field and indicates that 15.4 A is the better value. 

The purpose of this thesis is to carry out the measurements of the 
adsorption of a number of hydrocarbon gases on a series of coconut charcoals 
of different degrees of activation. The work described here is a continuation 
of that reported by Nay and Morrison (3), and includes the following original 
material; 

(a) In addition to nitrogen, methane, propane, butane, isobutane, 
and acetylene which were studied by Nay and Morrison, measure- 
ments were made with propylene, butadiene- 1 , 3 , ? cyclopropane, 
and neopentane. 

(b) A different series of activated charcoals was used. 

(c) The equilibrium times were studied throughout. 

(d) The isotherms were measured at lower pressures.

Experimental 

I Materials 

The charcoals used were a series of steam activated coconut shell 
charcoals derived from the same initial charge, and which were activated 
for different lengths of time. 

Chemically pure helium, propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, and 
cyclopropane were obtained from the Ohio Chemical Co. The helium was 
further purified by passage through an activated charcoal trap immersed 
in liquid air prior to entry into a storage bulb. The other gases were 
purified further by fractional distillation. 

Pure grade butadiene-1,3,. and neopentane were obtained from the 
Phillips Petroleum Co. The butadiene-1,3, contained 0.02$ tertiary butyl 
catechol which acted as a polymerization inhibitor. It was removed, prior 
to fractionation and storage by passage of the gas through 40$ aqueous 
caustic soda followed by several drying towers containing the same material. 
Previous to its use, neopentane was fractioned. 

Tank acetylene was used subject to purification after the manner described 
by Farkas and Melville (7). 

Methane was prepared by hydrolysis of methylmagnesium iodide and purified 
as described by Farkas and Melville. 

The nitrogen used was oil-pumped tank nitrogen which was further purified 
by passage over the following in the sequence givens Dehydrite; copper de¬ 
posited on glass wool, at 400 - 450°C; copper oxide deposited on glass wool, 
at 400 - 450°C; Dehydrite; and finally activated charcoal at the temperature 
of liquid air. 

The copper and copper oxide were deposited on pyrex glass wool by allowing 
the glass wool to soak for a period of time in a saturated solution of cupric 
nitrate in ethanol. The glass wool was removed and the excess ethanol was 

ignited. The residue was then baked until brownish black.

of the residue were alternately oxidized and reduced several times at 
400 - 450°C using oxygen and hydrogen respectively. Between oxidations 
and reductions, the system was flushed out with nitrogen to reduce the 
explosion hazard. One portion was left in the oxidized state and one in 
the reduced state. 

It was found that the Apeizon stopcock greases were not suitable for 
this work since some of the hydrocarbon gases were soluble in them. Cello- 
Grease (No. 14 - ^37); manufactured by the Fisher Scientific Co., was found 
to be satisfactory. 

II Apparatus 

The apparatus used was similar to that described by Emmett (8), and 
almost identical to that used by Nay and Morrison (3). A glass mirror scale 
for reading pressures was used in the later part of the work. Previously, a 
calibrated wood meter stick had been used. 

III Method 

Manipulation of the apparatus and a description of the calculations are 
given by Emmett (8). 

Samples of 0.20 to 0.25 grams of charcoal (dry weight) were used. They 
were degassed at 250 - 300°G for approximately two hours immediately before 
use. 

Dead spaces were measured at 0°C using pure helium. It was assumed that 
helium obeys the ideal gas laws. 

Nay (9), made corrections on all his measurements for the deviation of 
the gases used from ideality. He found such corrections could be neglected 
in this type of work. 

All equilibrium pressure measurements were taken in the manner previously 


described. (Fig. 1)

No analysis of the gases was attemped. However, to ensure that 
impurities, such as air did not enter the system and to indicate the 
efficiency of the purification procedure, two quantities of each gas 
were separately purified and stored. Duplicate isotherms were then 
determined using each quantity of gas collected. Checks between the 
two isotherms were considered to indicate sufficient purity of gases. 

Brunauer and Emmett (LQ), have proposed an empirical principle that 
true physical adsorption takes place near, or at the boiling point of the 
gas, since the Van der Waals 1 forces involved would be at a maximum. 
Accordingly, all isotherms were measured as near to the boiling point of 
the particular gas as possible without encountering capillary condensation. 
The temperatures at which the isotherms were measured are indicated below.

Langmuir type adsorption isotherms (equation (1)) of ten previously- 
mentioned gases on nine charcoals were obtained in duplicate. Isotherms 
obtained for selected gases on certain charcoals are shown in Figs. 2 and 
3. The significant data for all isotherms is included in Table I. Table I 
lists the volumes (V m ) of gases required to form monolayers on the adsorbents. 
Each value is an average of two measurements which were obtained from the 
slopes of the duplicate isotherms. 

Table II shows the effective molecular adsorption areas of the adsorbates 
for each charcoal. They were calculated using equation (2). The effective 


adsorption area of the reference gas, nitrogen, was assumed to be 16.2 A . 

Table III lists the surface areas of the charcoals available to each 
adsorbate. They were calculated using the relationship:

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

Discussion of Results 


Table I shov/s the volumes of the gases (S.T.P.) required to form a 
monolayer on the charcoals. The application of this data follows: 

I Effective Molecular Adsorption Areas 

The average effective molecular adsorption areas for each gas are 
based on the underlined values in Table II which appeared to be limiting 
values. The average of the selected values should be such that the surface 
area of the charcoal calculated from it is close to that computed from the 
molecular adsorption area assumed for nitrogen. 


The use of 16.2 A as the effective molecular adsorption area for 

nitrogen was based on measurements made at -196°G (5). All the nitrogen 

isotherms here were measured at -190°C. Livingston (6) indicates that 
°2 

15*4 A is a better value at -196°C. However, in view of the lower tempera¬ 


ture used, 16.2 A is probably the better value in this case. 

Table IV shoves data obtained by Nay and Morrison (3) for some of the 


gases used here on another series of charcoals.

Nay and Morrison obtained this data on the basis of the effective 

°2 

molecular adsorption area of nitrogen being 16.2 A at -190°C. With the 
exception of acetylene, their isotherms were measured at the same 
temperatures as those for the same gases used here. The author found 
evidence of capillary condensation at -75°C, the temperature at which Nay 
and Morrison measured the acetylene isotherm. Accordingly, -6l°G was found 
to be the best temperature for the isotherm. 

The data in Table IV shows certain trends. The effective molecular 
adsorption area of acetylene increases with increasing activation. For 
methane, it remains about the same, while for propane, butane, and isobutane, 
it decreases. Nay and Morrison have suggested that since acetylene is a 
thinner molecule than the reference gas, nitrogen, it can reach larger internal 
surfaces at lower activations, while at higher activations, both gases have 
access to the same surface. Accordingly, they presume that methane and 
nitrogen have access to the same surface throughout the series, and that 
propane, butane, and isobutane do not have access to the same surface as 
nitrogen until at higher activations. 

The data in Table II show the same trends. The trends are less distinct 
than those in Table IV, especially for the thicker molecules. This indicates 
the presence of finer pores, capable of seiving the thicker molecules at 
higher activations. Morrison (11) has measured the adsorptions of several 
aliphatic acids on these charcoals and has noted similar erratic behaviour. 

This behaviour may affect the accuracy of the effective molecular 
adsorption areas, making it difficult to choose the best values for a good 
average. 

The behaviour of cyclopropane and propane suggests contamination of these 
gases.

Any comparisons of the values obtained here with existing data must 
be made between values measured at the same temperature and referred to 
the same molecular adsorption area of nitrogen. Also, it is preferable 
that the same type of adsorbent is involved. 

Comparison of the values for methane, propane, butane, and isobutane, 
obtained by Nay and Morrison with those obtained here, shows excellent 
agreement in the cases of methane and isobutane. The molecular adsorption 
areas of propane and butane are slightly larger than those arrived at by 
Nay and Morrison. 

Beebe, Polley, Smith, and Wendell 0-2) measured the molecular adsorption 

c 2 

areas of butane on carbon blacks and obtained values ranging from 39.7 A 

°2 92 c >2 

to 45.1 A. Emmett and Cines (13) found areas of 52 A and 41 A for butane 

c 2 

on two zinc dusts. The same authors (14) assigned butane a value of 49 A 

on porous glass. For butane on various powders and metals, Davis, De Witt, 

°2 

and Emmett (15) assign butane a value of 46.9 A . Butane on silica gel was 

oo 

found to have a molecular adsorption area of 46.5 A by Brunauer, Emmett, 

and Teller (16). Beebe, Kington, Polley and Smith (17) find the molecular 

area 02 

adsorptior/of butane on carbon black to be 45 A . 

For butadiene-1,3 on carbon black, Beebe and his co-workers (12) arrive 

°2 

at a molecular adsorption area of 32.9 A • 

Values of the molecular adsorption areas at different temperatures for 

some of the adsorbates used here are available and may be of interest. 

Beebe, Kington, Polley, and Smith (17) have found the molecular adsorp- 

°2 

tion area of neopentane on carbon black to be 57 A at 0°C. The value 

°2 

measured here was 65.5 A at 40°C. Emmett and Cines (14) found the value 

©2 

for acetylene on porous glass at -78°C to be 22.2 A as compared with the 

°2 

value found here at -6l°C of 22.3 A. Nay and Morrison (Table IV) assign 

©2 

acetylene a value of 19.8 A at -78°G.

The molecular adsorption area of propane on several aluminas at 0°C 
°2 

is 39 A according to Russell and Cockran (18). The value measured 

°2 02 

here at -39°C is 40.5 A . Granquist (19) presents values of 25.6 A 

°2 

and 27.8 A for methane on Fuller*s earth at -140°C as compared to 
°2 

19.7 A at -145°C, as measured here. 

In general, the higher the temperature the larger the molecular 
adsorption area. Unsaturated molecules such as acetylene may behave 
strangely due to possible chemisorption. In view of this the above 
comparisons show that the values measured here vary in the right 
direction. 

II Orientation of Adsorbate 

Unsymetrical molecules usually have two possible orientations, 
vertical or horizontal. All of the gas molecules used in this work 
except nitrogen, methane, and neopentane are unsymetrical molecules. 

Of the three exceptions, methane and neopentane are perfectly symetrical. 
Nitrogen is usually considered to be a spherical molecule and therefore 
similar to methane. Unsymetrical molecules such as acetylene, butane, 
butadiene-1,3, propane, propylene, and isobutane may orient themselves 
on the adsorbent with their long axes parallel to the surface. Tills is 
horizontal orientation. If oriented vertically, the long axis is normal 
to the surface. 

Cyclopropane also has two orientations, one with the plane of the 
ring parallel to the surface of the adsorbent, and the other with the ring 
normal to the surface. 

Nay and Morrison (3) have suggested that the orientation of the 
adsorbate is an important factor in this work. They propose that if

orientation is vertical entry into the pores is governed by molecular 
length; if horizontal, by molecular thickness. 

If the orientations of propane, propylene, butane, isobutane, and 
butadiene-1,3, were vertical, the effective molecular adsorption areas 
of these gases should be similar to that for methane. However, the 
molecular adsorption areas are larger the longer the molecule, hence 
horizontal orientation. Acetylene is a longer and thinner molecule than 
methane, yet it has a larger molecular adsorption area. Therefore it 
must be oriented horizontally. 

Lemieux and Morrison (20) have compared the adsorptions of several 
aliphatic acids on a charcoal series. They proposed a method to elucidate 
the orientation of the acids. This method has been applied to gaseous 
adsorbates by Nay and Morrison. In it the V ffi for a particular gas is 
plotted against the V m of a reference gas for each charcoal. The linear 
plots obtained are then compared with a plot of the V m for the reference 
gas against itself. Nay and Morrison indicate that the gases involved 
must be of similar cross section and suggest that lines of a slope greater 
than one indicate horizontal orientation, while parallel or coincident lines 
show vertical orientation. On this basis they presumed butane, propane, and 
ethane to be oriented horizontally, and infer that acetylene, ethylene, 
and isobutane have the same orientation. 

The gases used in this work were compared in the same manner. It is 
indicated in Fig. 5 that cyclopropane, propane, butane, butadiene-1,3, 
isobutane, and possibly propylene are oriented horizontally. 

The horizontal and vertical orientations of ail these gases except 
cyclopropane are quite distinct. In the case of cyclopropane, a consid.era-

tion of its molecular model will show that it has two possible orientations 


If it is oriented with the ring parallel to the surface of the adsorbent, 
the model will show that two thicknesses are involved. If the ring is 
normal to the surface, then the thickness involved is the same as one of 
the thicknesses associated with the other orientation. Both of the 



molecular adsorption areas and the three 


The fact 


that a best fit straight line of slope greater than one was obtained for 
several of the points (Fig. 5 ) in the plot of V m for cyclopropane versus 
V m for butane indicates only that the molecular adsorption area of cyclo¬ 
propane is smaller than that for butane. In view of the rotation of the 
methyl groups in a butane molecule, and the similarity of the cross-sections 
of cyclopropane, it would be difficult to establish the orientation of 
cyclopropane by the above method. 

The behaviour of neopentane can be used to indicate the orientation of 
some of the other adsorbates. Consideration of the structures of neopentane 
and propane will reveal that propane is as long as the former is wide. If 
propane were oriented vertically, its length would determine its entry into 
the pores. It would therefore be excluded from the same internal surfaces 
as neopentane. The surface areas of each charcoal which are available to 
each gas are shown in Table III. They show that propane has access to much 
more surface than neopentane, except at higher activations. Therefore, propane 
and,propylene for the same reasons,are oriented horizontally. Molecules which 
are longer than neopentane is wide should have access to less surface than 
neopentane if oriented vertically. Such is not the case at lower activations. 
Hence, butane, butadiene-1,3, and isobutane are oriented horizontally. 

Acetylene is a longer molecule than methane is thick. The former reaches 
larger internal surfaces than methane, as shown in Table III. Accordingly, 
acetylene must be oriented horizontally.

III Screening and Molecular Thickness 

It has been indicated that acetylene, propane, propylene, butane, 
butadiene-1,3, and isobutane are oriented horizontally. Nay and 
Morrison (3) have suggested that in such a case the molecular thickness 
determines the accessibility of the absorbate to the internal surfaces 
of the charcoals. 

The trends of the molecular adsorption areas shown in Table II 
support their suggestion. Molecules which are thicker than nitrogen, 
such as neopentane, isobutane, and cyclopropane show decreasing effective 
molecular adsorption areas as activation increases. This indicates that 
at lower activations, where the proportion of finer pores is greater, 
these molecules are being screened. The screening is very evident for 
neopentane. Accordingly, molecules which are longer than neopentane is 
thick, and molecules whose lengthsare similar to the thickness of neopentane, 
should show more pronounced or similar trends, respectively. For the former 
case, such molecules are isobutane, butadiene-1,3, and butane. The latter 
case involves propane and propylene. The trends for none of these adsorbates 
is similar in magnitude to that for neopentane. It is apparent then that 
molecular thickness governs the accessibility of these adsorbates to the 
internal surfaces of the pores. 

Acetylene is a longer molecule than methane. Methane is approximately 
the same size as nitrogen, as evidenced by the fairly constant effective 
molecular adsorption areas of methane throughout the series. The molecular 
adsorption ares of acetylene increases as activation increases. This 
indicates that it has greater access to internal surfaces than nitrogen. 

The suggestion is then, that its thickness determines its access to the 


pores

The nature of the cyclopropane molecule does not permit evaluation 
of its effects in screening. 

The trends in the surface areas of the charcoals, shown in Table III, 
illustrate the screening effect. They show that molecules which are thinner 
than nitrogen have access to greater internal surfaces at lower activations, 
while thicker molecules do not reach the same internal surfaces. As 
activation increases, the relative numbers of finer pores decreases. This 
is shown by the fact that all adsorbate molecules except propane and cyclo¬ 
propane reach the same internal surfaces at higher activations. This was 
also indicated by Nay and Morrison (3) who made measurements with nitrogen, 
acetylene, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, butane, and isobutane. 

The areas of the various charcoals which are available to methane and 
nitrogen are similar throughout the series. This is due to their similar 
size. 

Charcoal no. 19 shows certain peculiarities and will be discussed later.

IV Diffusion 

Figs. 2 and 3 show the Langmuir isotherms obtained for neopentane 
and nitrogen respectively, on charcoals 3 and 18. 

Nay and Morrison (3) have made measurements on another series of 
activated charcoals. Their measurements were made at higher pressures. 

The lowest pressure on any of their isotherms was in the neighborhood 
of 5 cms. of mercury. The author measured isotherms on a different series 
of charcoals at pressures as low as 1 cm. of mercury. Nay and Morrison 
extended their measurements to pressures in the vicinity of 50 to 60 cms. 
of mercury, and obtained about six points on the isotherms. The isotherms 
measured here extended to pressures of 30 to 40 cms. of mercury and were 
established by ten or twelve points. 

Nay and Morrison noticed that for the larger adsorbate molecules, such 
as butane, on the lower activated charcoals, the isotherms obtained possessed 
a slight curvature, concave to the pressure axis. They suggested that the 
curvature was due to diffusion of the adsorbate into the finer pores of the 
adsorbent. The type of curvature described by Nay and Morrison is indicated 
by the dashed line in Fig. 2. 

It was found that some of the isotherms obtained here showed a more 
pronounced curvature intially, as well as the slight curvature described by 
Nay and Morrison. The latter did not observe the pronounced initial curvature 
since their isotherms did not extend into the low pressure region where it 
occurs. 

The initial curvature was more pronounced in the case of the larger 
adsorbate molecules and the lower activated charcoals. At higher activations 
it was not detectable in the case of the smaller adsorbates, such as nitrogen.

The slighter curvature described by Way and Morrison behaved in a similar 
manner. 

The portions of the isotherms obtained for neopentane and nitrogen on 
charcoals 3 and 18 are shown up to a pressure of 24 cms. of mercury in 
Figs. 2 and 3. Some of the initial points on the isotherms for nitrogen 
on charcoal 18 have been omitted since they were coincident ( 0 cms. of 
mercury). These isotherms show the two extremes in regard to the curva¬ 
tures. The isotherms for other gases on intermediate charcoals showed 
curvatures between these extremes, dependent upon adsorbate size and char¬ 
coal activation. 

The method proposed by Nay and Morrison for finding the equilibrium 
point (Fig. 1) is based on the assumption that the portion of the curve 
a b represents mainly adsorption. The pronounced initial curvature noticed 
here for some of the gases on certain charcoals suggests that a b represents 
mainly diffusion. The extent to which this diffusion will affect the 
isotherms has not been measured. Due to the higher initial pressures in 
the isotherms measured by Nay and Morrison, it is probable that there was 
more diffusion throughout their isotherms than contemplated. Here it appears 
that most of the diffusion occurred initially. Accordingly, the almost 
linear portions of the isotherms obtained here should be more representative 
of adsorption than those obtained by Nay and Morrison. This is indicated by 
a comparison of some of the values for the molecular adsorption areas obtained 
here with those measured by Nay and Morrison (Table IV). Indications are 
that there is more diffusion in ihe case of larger adsorbate molecules. This 
should result in lower values of the molecular adsorption areas. The values

measured by Nay and Morrison for propane and butane are lower than those 
obtained here. Accordingly, one would expect good agreement with the 
values obtained for smaller adsorbate molecules. Such is the case. (cf. 
methane)• 

V Equilibrium Times 

Fig. 4 shows trends in the equilibrium times for the adsorbates used 
here. The equilibrium time referred to is that time which is indicated by 
point b in Fig. I. The curves shown in Fig. 4 were sketched according to 
the general trend of the times indicated by b for each point on the isotherm. 

These trends were not observed by Nay and Morrison (3), probably because 
they measured their isotherms at higher pressures. 

A distinctive feature shown in Figs. 4 (a,b,c,d, and e) is that the 
maxima in the curves decreases as the thickness of the adsorbate molecule 
increases. Indications are (Table III) that acetylene and propylene are 
thinner than nitrogen. Fig. 4 (f) shows a slight peak for these gases. It 
was noticed, that in general, the distinctive features (maxima, , Inflection 
points, etc.) of the curves for all adsorbates excepting neopentane became 
less pronounced and tended to shift to the right as activation increased. 

These observations suggest that the shape of the curves is due to the 
pore structure of the charcoal and the ease with which an adsorbate may enter 
the various sized pores. 

The diffusion effects previously discussed make further speculation on 
the nature of these curves difficult.

VI Charcoal 19 and Overactivation 

Overactivation is a process in which the surface area of the charcoal 
decreases, probably due to the breaking down of pore walls. Charcoal 19 
appears to be overactivated. Table III shows that it presents less surface 
to the larger adsorbate molecules, than charcoal 13, In the case of the 
smaller adsorbate molecules, there is no noticeable effect. This suggests 
that the larger pores are affected to a greater extent than the smaller 
ones. 

Because of overactivation, charcoal 19 is unique in this series of 
charcoals. For this reason it has been omitted in Fig. 5. (V m Plots) 

SUMMARY 


Nay and Morrison (3) have studied the adsorption of nitrogen, methane, 
ethane, propane, butane, isobutane, ethylene, and acetylene on a series of 
activated charcoals. Their work has been extended, using a different series 
of charcoals. In addition to nitrogen, methane, propane, butane, isobutane, 
and acetylene, the adsorption of butadiene-1,3, neopentane, cyclopropane, 
and propylene were investigated. 

The molecular adsorption areas of these gases were measured and are 
presented in Table III. 

All of the gases used here except methane, nitrogen, and cyclopropane 
appear to be oriented horizontally on the charcoal surface. The orientation 
of cyclopropane could not be determined due to structural factors. It has 
been shown that symetrical molecules of various sizes(neopentane and methane) 
are a great aid in indicating the orientation of unsymetrlcal molecules. 

The suggestion of Nay and Morrison that screening is governed by molecular 
thickness in the case of horizontal orientation has been strenghtened by a

comparison of the behaviour of neopentane and methane with that of the 
other gases. 

The diffusion process is suggested to be a more important factor 
than indicated by Nay and Morrison (3). On thisbasis, the method used 
here (low initial pressures) is suggested to give isothermswhich are 
more representative of adsorption than the isotherms measured by Nay and 


Morrison
