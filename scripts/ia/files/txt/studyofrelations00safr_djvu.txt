THB PROBLEM, ITS IMPORTANCE, AND DEFINITIONS . 

1. THE PROBLEM 

It was the purpose of this study to; 

(a) determine the degree of relationship between the classif¬ 
ication, placement, and terminal tests of the pre- 
matriculation school and the veterans’ first year 
university re suits; 

(b) determine the significance of these relationships, and 
to compare them with the correlation obtained from a 
control group; 

(c) infer the effectiveness of training in the pre-matriculation 
school. 


2, IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY 

The pre-matriculation school first opened its doors 
in January, 1945, and completed its work in August, 1948. No 
study determining the relationship between the pre-niatriculation 
tests and university success had yet been undertaken in Alberta. 
It was, therefore, decided by the committee in charge of testing 
in the pre-matriculation schools that a survey of this nature 
would help immeasurably to supplement the school files and 
possibly serve as a guide for youth training schemes in the

DEFINITIONS OF TERMS. USED 

(1) Pre-Matriculation school. 

The pre-matriculation schools were schools opened 
primarily to assist honorably discharged service personnel who 
lacked matriculation standing and who wished to pursue studies 
in the University of Alberta, At these schools the students were 
able to complete their studies in a minimum period of time. 

(2) Classification test. 

The classification test was a general test prepared by 
Dr. H.E. Smith, University of Alberta, and used to determine the 
mental maturity of the ex-service personnel before they commenced 
training at the pre-matriculation schools. 

(5) Placement tests. 

Placement tests were M screening tests” which determined 
the ability of the candidate and the grade level at which he or 
she should resume studies in the various subjects. 

(4) Terminal tests. 

Terminal tests were tests taken at the completion of 
training in the pre-matriculation schools. Upon passing the 
various terminal tests, matriculation standings were granted to 
|the students and they were then ready to enter the university.

Chapter II . 

THE HISTORY OF THE ALBERTA PRE-MATRICULATION SCHOOLS , 

THE PLACEMENT TESTS AND TERMINAL TEST S. 

1. HISTORY OF THE PIE-MATRICULATION SCHOOLS. 

The Dominion Government, after the second world war, 
had made it possible for discharged service personnel to pursue 
university studies. The candidates were provided for by pay¬ 
ment of fees and subsistence allowances while under instruction. 

Each province introduced its own scheme of tutorial 
work to assist ex-service people to complete matriculation 
requirements. (Table I.) 

Many discharged personnel in Alberta, who wished to 
attend the university, did not hold matriculation standing for 
entrance. As a consequence it was found necessary to set up 
certain schools in which matriculation studies could be carried 
on. 

In September, 1944, the Deputy Minister of Education, 
realizing that the University of Alberta was not in a position 
to provide secondary school training to candidates seeking 
admission to its courses, established a committee on the inter¬ 
rupted education of persons discharged from war service. This 
group was charged with the responsibility of instituting the

necessary educational facilities. The chairman of the committee 
was the late Dr. H.E. Newland, who was later succeeded by 
Mr. W.E. Frame, Chief Superintendent of Alberta schools. The 
administration of the pre-matriculation schools’ testing pro¬ 
cedures was under the direction of Mr. J.H. Ross, Regional 
Director (Alberta) of the Canadian Vocational Training scheme. 

Pre-matriculation schools were therefore established 
in Calgary and Edmonton at the inception of the programme. The 
following year the Red Deer pre-matriculation school opened its 
doors. 

The primary purpose of these schools was to grant 
matriculation standings to those persons who wished to pursue 
courses at the university, and did not have the necessary 
requirements for entrance. Under the tutorial system they were 
able to complete the requirements in a minimum amount of time. 

The average time per student spent at the pre-matriculation school 
seems to have been between five-and-a-half and six months. 

Before entering the pre-matriculation schools for 
instruction, candidates took placement tests in English, Social 
Studies, Science, Mathematics and General Ability. The tests 
were drawn up under a sub-committee of the pre-matriculation school 
committee, and a well qualified educationist was chosen to prepare 


each test.

The tests had originally been compiled with the 
under standing that they would be administered to persons who 
had been away from formal training for four or five years or 
even longer. Accordingly, emphasis was placed on the underlying 
principles in the subjects, rather than on a detailed grasp of 
factual knowledge. The candidates were thus given the opportunity 
of displaying their maturity, judgment, wide reading and knowledge 
of current events. 

Originally, the schools were conducted in such a manner 
that terminal examinations could be written by the candidates as soon 
as their instructors considered them sufficiently qualified. 

Students proceeded at their own rate of learning speed, and were 
free to write terminal examinations in any subject whenever they 
felt themselves capable of doing so. Nevertheless, after June, 

19^6, it was decided that the student personnel should write all 
their terminal examinations at one time, which would make the 
system more realistic and comparable to that in use in the high 
schools of Alberta. 

Certain faculties of the University of Alberta agreed 
to forego foreign language requirements. Language courses were 
offered in the pre-matriculation school for students who required 
them. 


The Director of the Examinations Branch, Department of 







- 7 - 


Education, was the custodian of all tests and examinations, 
and, upon request, would release them to the custody of the 
schools. 

Pre-matriculation schools in Alberta were operated 
from January, 194-5, up to and including August, 1948. During 
this time, the placement tests were written by 3#800 veterans, 
of whom 3*000 were in actual attendance at the pre-matriculation 
schools in either Edmonton, Calgary or Red Deer. The other 800 
were counselled into other pursuits. 

2. THE PLACEMENT TESTS. 

When the ex-service man or woman decided to enter the 
pre-matriculation school, he or she was first asked to take the 
placement tests. The purposes of these tests were* 

(a) to determine whether or not the prospective 
student had the ability and background to 
enable him or her to proceed successfully 
with studies in a university; 

(b) to determine the level at which the student 
was prepared to study, either at the Grade X, 

XI or XII levels. 


The following three-hour tests were givens 





: if:'

(a) General or Classification test, 

( b) Mat hematic s te st, 

(c) Science test, 

(d) English literature and Language test, 

(e) Social Studies test. 

Alternative tests were to be provided in each case 
and later forms C and D were prepared in English, Social 
Studies, Mathematics, Science and the General Ability tests. 
These tests were scaled in such a manner as to assess? 

(a) formal training taken in high school prior 
to enlistment; 

(b) general training and special courses received 
in the army during service; 

(c) casual learning acquired through reading and 
everyday experience. 

The committee also felt that a detailed knowledge of 
factual events should not be subjected to test. 

Supplementary sections were later prepared for the 
tests in Mathematics and Science (Physics and Chemistry) at the 
Grade XII level. Any candidate whose score on the regular test 
was high enough to warrant matriculation standing, was also 
required to take the supplementary tests in Mathematics and 
Science, if he or she proposed to enter the university faculties

in which Grade XII standings in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry 
were, matriculation requirements. In practice, however, the 
supplementary tests were not used, students being required to pass 
the terminal tests. 

Matriculation norms had been established by the high 
school inspectors, and all the placement papers were evaluated by 
a single board of qualified educationists. 

An agreement reached by the committee in charge of 
testing ruled that* 

(a) Any applicant who had taken the placement tests and who 
had sufficiently high marks in English 5 and Social Studies 
was granted matriculation in these two subjects. All other 
matriculation deficiencies had to be completed by terminal 
tests. He was then considered to have satisfied the 
matriculation requirements. 

(b) Any applicant who had previously completed part of the 
Grade XII requirements was to take the preliminary tests. 

The scores were to be reported to the Department of 
Veterans* Affairs. The D.7.A. counsellor, working in 
liaison with the university advisory service, then 
recommended the programme of training for the student, 
namely*. 

(i) that the applicant should take a refresher 
course in the subjects in which he already

held matriculation credits; 

(ii) that the tutorial instruction could be 
limited to those subjects in which the 
applicant desired matriculation standing; 

The original tests were given to a group of forty high 
school students of assorted ages, and an attempt was made to fix 
the percentile levels to indicate the grades at which students 
should commence their studies. 

It is further claimed, that the placement tests divided 
the individuals into three sharply defined groups, namely: 

(a) those with previous matriculation credits 
requiring some refresher courses before 
admission to Grade XII; 

(b) those requiring approximately two months 1 
intensive review of Grade XI, before proceed¬ 
ing to Grade XII; 

(c) those showing the need for three months 1 

”brush up” in Grade XI or previous grades.

terminal tests should be composed of Grade XII departmental

examination papers for the five years prior to 1945, Ail 
terminal test results were prepared by the Canadian Vocational 
Training officers under Mr. J.H. Ross, and then sent to the 
Examinations Branch, Department of Education, with the request 
that the results be put in a form suitable for transcripts. 
Consequently, students were graded on a percentage basis in one 
or more of the following subjects of the revised high school 
programme:

4. ESTABLISHMENT OF TIMES FOR TESTING.

schools, the placement tests were given to the student whenever 
he was ready to enter the school, and terminal tests were given 
to him at the time he was ready to complete his studies. After

Chapter III. 


PREVIOUS AND RELATED STUDIES . 

This thesis concerns itself mainly with the relation¬ 
ships between veterans’ marks in classification, placement, 
terminal tests, and first year university results. It is 
fitting, therefore, to include in this chapter, literature on 
intelligence tests, preliminary tests and final tests with their 
predictions of success as determined by university results. At 
the same time, reference should be made to various experimental 
schools that, in a like fashion to the Alberta pre-matriculation 
schools, have attempted to solve the problems of the veterans 
students’ matriculation standings. 

1. REVIEW OF STUDIES ON INTELLIGENCE 
TESTS AND THEIR RELATION TO 
SCHOOL RESULTS. 


Turney (ll) concluded that there was only slight 
correlation between success in university and intelligence. 
Specifically., he sayss 


”A number of investigators have submitted 
data indicating that the discrepancy between 
intelligence test results and achievement 
usually found in schoolroom situations is 
not necessarily the result of faulty measures 
either of intelligence or achievement - - - 
this discrepancy is due to types of behaviour 
we call industry, persistence, ambition, 
school attitude and dependability.* 4

Other writers also give credit to intelligence as a 
factor in school success, but not as the determining factor. 

Markey (8) believed that: 

n The general conclusion - - - is that 
the most reliable means of predicting 
academic success is a combination of 
intelligence and degrees of application." 

Boynton (l), Prescott (10) and Horn (6) are of the 
opinion that intelligence, though a vital factor in any success 
in school work, is overshadowed by purpose, application, determina¬ 
tion and emotion. 

Therefore, the conclusion arrived at by these authors 
is that intelligence is not the determining factor in success of 
schooling and is often over-estimated. 

2. REVIEW OF STUDIES ON PRELIMINARY TESTS 

In a recent article, Medsker (9) contended that the 
use of tests for admission and grade level placement had been 
increasing rapidly in the years since the war. The great 
increase of veterans in attendance at universities and high 
schools necessitated the use of preliminary tests as indicators 
of grade placement. However, the practice of using them for 
credit purposes is relatively new. He felt that: 

n Opponents of the test claim that no test, 
however good and regardless of the norms

"established for it, can substitute 
adequately for high school experience - 
pointing out the necessity for specific 
pre-professional subjects, benefit of 
content materials and values of extra 
curricular activities. They say that 
the tests are too easy - in proof thereof 
they tell of veterans who failed before 
going into school, but who upon returning 
score high in the tests." 


The general education development tests introduced 
by the United States Armed Forces Institute of Tests, were not 
measurements of specific course content, as are comprehensive 
examinations, but rather were an index of the students' ability 
to read, interpret, and evaluate materials in the five fields 
covered by the tests, namely, English expression. Social Studies, 
Natural Sciences, Literary materials and Mathematics. If? may be 
noted that the Alberta placement tests were suggested by the 
U.S.A.F.I. tests. 


Therefore, it can be seen that placement t&sts were 
evolved not only in Alberta, but also in various parts of the 
United States and were used as indicators for grade placement in 
the high schools. 


5. REVIEW OF STUDIES ON FINAL EXAMINATIONS 
AND THEIR RELATION TO UNIVERSITY SUCCESS. 

There have been innumerable studies made to denote the 
fact that there is a distinct relationship between success in 
high school and university. Since the terminal tests in the

Alberta pre-matriculation school were in reality final Grade XII 
examinations of previous years, it can be safely assumed that any 
articles relating to final examinations and high school results 
will satisfactorily cover the terminal examinations as well, 

Jones and Laslett (7) found that while college scholastic success 
can be predicted very satisfactorily from high school averages, 
college scholastic scores depend on industry and ability, and 
above all, high school composite marks are the best single 
criterion for the prediction of scholastic success. Byrns (2), 
Crawford and Burnham (^), Garrett (4) and Glatfelter (5), all 
believe that there is a high correlation between high school marks 
and university success. 

4. SURVEY OF LITERATURE ON 
VETERANS 1 SCHOOLS. 

The movement to send veterans back to schools and 
universities was started with the cessation of hostilities. Even 
in late 1944, according to Tyler (12), plans were being made in 
the larger cities in the United States to open special schools 
providing high school training for veterans. The feeling was 
general that the veterans should not attend schools side by side 
with 14, 15 and 16 year old pupils. 

Medsker (9) held that the country owed much to the 


veterans 


He says*. 



d ;r; ' tf<; ,C v ! L

“One responsibility is that of taking the 
veterans from the point of view at which 
we find him, educationally speaking, and 
of expediting the achievement of his 
goals as quickly as is educationally 
sound. The other responsibility is that 
of providing a counselling service that 
will really assist the veteran in his 
educational, vocational and personal 
adjustments." 


Woellner (l^) felt that in the case of all students: 


" using examinations, rather than credit for 
time spent to determine whether an individual 
can be benefited by the next higher level is 
a sound practice in the case of all students - 
- - - refresher courses for those who have been 
away from formal schooling for a long time, 
accelerated programmes for those who are able 
to profit by them, consideration of experience 
gained outside the classroom have educational 
advantages." 


Most cities in the United States undertook this pro¬ 
gramme to help veterans accelerate their high school training 
as rapidly as was educationally feasible. The Chicago 
experiment (9) was a typical example in this field. Several 
high school centres were established for veterans only, to 
enable them to pursue subjects which they needed for graduation 
on a tutorial basis, at their own rate of speed. Regular high 
school teachers were assigned to work with the men. When both 
the veteran and his teacher felt that he was fully qualified to 
write the final examination, he proceeded to do so. 


Therefore, the pre-matriculation schools in Alberta

METHOD OF SECURING AND ORGANIZING DATA. 

1. SAMPLE AHD CONTROL GROUP. 

A random sample of 587 veterans from the Calgary 
pre-matriculation school who took the placement tests was 
selected as representative of the normally distributed popula¬ 
tion of veterans who attended this school. The method of 
sampling was to select one out of every six veterans who had 
taken the placement tests to a total of 587. This method of 
sampling was considered sufficiently random for the purpose 
of this study. Of this group 107 registered at the University 
of Alberta prior to September, 1948. Unfortunately, in this 
sample there were only eight veterans who had written their 
terminal examinations after June, 1946. Consequently, the 
study of the group, and their results, was confined to the 
period prior to June, 1946. 

A further random sample of 107 students who had gone 
directly to university from high school was selected as the 
control group. The method of sampling was to select one out of 
every six names from the Registrar’s files to a total of 107. 

The thesis committee considered this method of sampling suffic¬ 
iently random for the purposes of this study.

2. DATA TAKEN FROM SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP. 

The following data were taken from the records of the 
veterans’ sample* 

(a) classification test scores, 

(b) placement test scores, 

(c) terminal test scores, 

(d) first year university averages, 

(e) second year university averages. 

In each case the average of the tests for each student 
was computed, with the exception of the classification test, in 
which instance the raw scores were used. Figures 1 to 5 inclus¬ 
ive and Table III, show the distribution of the marks in the 
tests and also denote the median scores together with the first 
and third quartiles. 

Grade XII high school averages and the first year 
university averages, were the only data taken from the control 
group records. 


5. THE SIZE OF THE SAMPLE. 

A size of 107 was used in all instances except two, 
in the determination of the correlation coefficients. The two 


exceptions occurred in*

(a) the determination of the correlation coefficient 
between the terminal tests and the first year 
university results. In this case a sample of 
85 was used, since only those students who wrote 
two or more terminal tests were considered; 

(b) the determination of the correlation coefficient 
between the first and second year university 
averages. In this instance, a sample of 82 was 
used, because some of the students did not continue 
their studies into their second year university. 

4. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. 

The statistical work of the experiment was divided 
into four main sections: (l) determination of size of correla¬ 
tions; (2) determination of the significance of the correlatior 
(5) determination of the significance of the differences betweer 
correlations in the veterans' sample; (4) determination of the 
significance of the differences between correlations in the 
veterans' sample and the correlation in the control sample. 

(l) Determination of the size of correlations. 

The following coefficients of linear correlation were 
found:

yr. university results - control group sample

These correlations, when found, gave a rough estimate 
of the relationships between the various pre-matriculation 
tests and the results obtained in university. The calculation 
of the coefficients of the various linear correlations was 
accomplished by means of the product-moment-method of correlation 
determination. (2, p.285). 

(2) Determination of the significance of correlations. 

The significance of each obtained correlation coefficient 
was tested against (a) the null hypothesis (b) Table 49 (2,p.298) 
(a) Null hypothesis. Each correlation was tested against 
the null hypothesis to determine its significance. 

In each case the assumption was made that a random 
sample had been drawn from a population in which the 
variables to be correlated were normally distributed.

With the null hypothesis that the parameter or 
population r (correlation coefficient) was zero, the 
method consisted of comparing the t (critical ratio) 
value for the obtained r with the t's to be expected 
by chance at the ,05 and .01 levels. The t for each 
given r was found by the formula 





If the obtained t in each case was larger than 
that expected at the 5% level, the null hypothesis 
was rejected on the assumption that the obtained r 
was significantly different from zero. If, the 
obtained t in each case was larger than that expected 
at the 1% level, the null hypothesis was rejected on 
the conclusion that the obtained r was very signifi¬ 
cantly different from zero. On the other hand, if the 
t fell below that expected at the 5% level, the null 
hypothesis was retained and the conclusion was made 
that the r was not significantly different from zero, 
and any differences which did arise were merely due to 
accidents in sampling. 

(b) Table 4p (2, p.298). The obtained correlation 

coefficients were next compared directly with those 
in Table 49. If the obtained r (with appropriate 
degrees of freedom) exceeded the r's to be found at

the .05 and .01 levels in the table, the coefficient 
of correlation was considered either significant or 
very significant. 


(5) Determination of the significance of the differences between 
correlations in the veterans* sample. 

The differences between the following correlations were 
found and their significance compared: 


classification test 
1st yr. university 

vs. 

and 

placement tests vs. 

1st yr. university 

classification test 
1st yr. university 

vs. 

and 

placement plus terminal 
tests vs. 1st yr. university 

classification test 
1st yr. university 

vs. 

and 

terminal tests alone vs. 

1st yr. university 

placement tests vs. 
1st yr. university 


and 

terminal plus placement 
tests vs. 1st yr. university 


(e) placement tests vs. 

1st yr. university 

(f) terminal plus place¬ 

ment tests vs. 1st 
yr. university 

The assumptions made in each case were that a random 


terminal tests alone vs. 
and 1st yr. university 

terminal tests alone vs. 
and 1st yr. university 


sample had been drawn from a population normally distributed 


in the correlated variables. 


The null hypothesis was used with the assertion that 



c 


. 



















- 33 - 


there was no significant difference between the two sample 

r ! s and differences which did arise were merely due to 
( 

accidents in sampling. The hypothesis further asserted 
that the two samples were drawn from the same population. 

If the critical ratio in each case proved to be larger 
than that expected at the 5% level of significance, which 
meant that a critical ratio of this size could only occur 
as an accident in sampling in less than of the cases, 
the null hypothesis was rejected and the conclusion was 
made that the difference between the two r’s was significant. 
If the critical ratio proved to be larger than that expected 
at the 1% level of significance, the null hypothesis was 
rejected with the observation that the differences between 
the two correlations was highly significant. If, on the 
other hand, the critical ratio fell below that expected at 
the 5% level - Table 29 (2, p#190) - the null hypothesis was 
retained with the observation that the difference between 
the correlations was not significant and further that this 
difference was due only to accidents in sampling. 

The formula used to determine the significance of the 
differences between the r's from the same sample contained 
three parts and was as follows:

The formula itself is relatively new (1946) and involves 
the use of a common variable. In the veterans’ sample 
the first year university results were found to be common 
to each correlation. As a consequence in order to deter¬ 
mine correlation^jWhich is necessary for further computation, 
six more linear correlations had to be found. The correla¬ 
tions used were*

(4) Determination of the significance of the differences between 
correlations in the veterans' sample and the correlation in 
the control sample. 

The following differences were found between r’s in the two 
independent samples (veterans’ sample and control group):

The assumptions made in each case were that two 
independent random samples had been drawn from two popu¬ 
lations, normally distributed in the correlated variables. 

The null hypothesis was used with the assertion that 
the difference between the two population r’s was zero, and 
except for accidents in sampling the difference between the 
two sample r’s should be zero. The formula used to derive 
the critical ratio is the one used to determine the signifi¬ 
cance of the differences between correlations, (l). 


C«- 



If the critical ratio proved to be larger than that expected 
at the 5% level of significance which meant that a critical 
ratio of this size could only occur as an accident in sampling 
in less than 5% of the cases, the null hypothesis was rejected 
and the contention made that the difference between r's was

than that expected at the 1% level of significance, the 
null hypothesis was rejected with the contention that the 
difference between the r‘s was very significant* If, 
on the other hand, the critical ratio fell below that 
expected at the 5% level - Table 29 (2), the null hypothesis 
was retained with the belief that the difference between the 
correlations was not significant and that further, the 
difference which did arise was merely due to accidents 
in sampling.

RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE DATA. 


1. THE DETERMINATION OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF 
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PRE¬ 
MATRICULATION TESTS AND THE FIRST YEAR 
UNIVERSITY RESULTS. 


The linear coefficients of correlations that were 
found are those shown in Table IV. 

According to Garrett (1, 




11 It is customary in mental measurement to 
describe the correlation between two tests 
in a general-way as high, marked or sub¬ 
stantial* low or negligible. While the 
descriptive label applied will vary some¬ 
what in meaning with the author using it, 
there is fairly good agreement among workers 


with psychological an

denotes indifferent or 
negligible relationship 

denotes low correlations 
present but slight 

denotes substantial or

high relationship 


rt This classification is broad and somewhat 
tentative, and can only be accepted as a 
general guide with certain reservations.'*

dealing with linear correlations. 

On the basis of this authority the following 

conclusions were reached; 

(a) the control group correlation shows a high degree of 
relationship - this indicates that there is a tendency 
for high marks in Grade XII to accompany high marks 

in university; 

(b) the veterans 1 group classification test vs. first year 
university correlation denotes a low but positive 
correlation - there is a tendency for high marks in the 
classification test to accompany high marks in university 
but the relationship is not consistent; 

(c) the veterans’ group placement tests vs. first year 
university correlation denotes a low but positive 
correlation - there is a tendency for high marks in the 
placement tests to accompany high marks in university 
but the relationship is not consistent; 

(d) the veterans’ placement plus terminal tests vs. first 
year university correlation shows a substantial or 
marked relationship - there is a more consistent tendency 
for high marks in placement plus terminal tests to 
accompany high marks in university, than there is in the 
placement tests alone;

(e) the veterans’ terminal tests alone vs* first year uni¬ 
versity correlation denotes substantial or marked 
relationship - therefore, this indicates that there is 

a tendency for high marks in terminal tests to accompany 
high marks in university; 

(f) the veterans’ first year university vs. second year 
university correlation shows a substantial or 'marked 
relationship - there is a tendency for high marks in 
first year university to accompany high marks in second 
year university in a fairly consistent manner. 

The conclusions derived from these correlations show 
that there is a definite relationship between the veterans’ 
pre-matriculation tests and the university results. These 
relationships range from slight in the classification test to 
marked in the terminal tests. There is a definite indication 
that high scores in the terminal tests tend to accompany high 
scores in the university results. On the other hand, high 
scores in the placement tests correspond to high scores in 
university results but not as consistently as do terminal tests 
scores. The classification test with the lowest correlation 
indicates the fact that there is a positive relationship with 
university results but that consistency between the two is 
unpredictable.

2* THE DETERMINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF THE VARIOUS CORRELATIONS. 

There is a positive need to determine the significance 
of the correlations. If none of the r’s were significantly 
different from zero, the 6ize of the correlation coefficients 
would be of little value. This would serve to indicate that in 
reality the correlation coefficients were not different from 
zero and that the size of the correlations had merely arisen due 
to sampling errors, and that in reality there was no relationship 
between any of the variables. 

The findings were as follow si 

(a) control group - Grade XII vs. 1st year university 

results - very significantly 
different from zero; 

(b) veterans 1 group - classification test vs. 1st year 

university results - significantly 
different from zero; 

(c) veterans 1 group - placement tests vs. 1st year 

university results - very signif¬ 
icantly different from zero; 

(d) veterans 1 group - placement plus terminal tests vs. 

1st year university results - very 


significantly different from zero;

(e) veterans' group - terminal tests alone vs, 1st year 

university results - very signif¬ 
icantly different from zero; 

(f) veterans' group - 1st year university results vs. 2nd 

year university results - very 
significantly different from zero. 

(Tables V. and VI.) 

If the true r were zero, the probability is less than 
1 in 100 that the control group correlation coefficient (Grade XII 
vs. first year university results r 53 *75) had arisen as an 
error in sampling. This probability of 1 in 100 was true in 
every correlation coefficient that was determined, with the 
exception of the classification vs. first year university results 
correlation. With the latter r the probability is only 5 in 100 
that an r - *23 could have arisen as an error in sampling if the 
true r were zero. 

Therefore, all correlations were significantly different 
from zero, and were not determined by chance alone. 

3. THE DETERMINATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE 
OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
CORRELATIONS OF THE VETERANS' SAMPLE.

test vs, the terminal tests alone. It was expected that the 
differences between the correlations would not be significant, 
because they had all been determined from the same sample. This, 
however, did not prove to be the case. The correlation co¬ 
efficient, classification test vs, placement plus terminal tests 
was r = .24, and the correlation between classification test and 
terminal tests alone was r ■ ,14 (Table VIII.) On the other 
hand, the other correlations in the veterans 1 group ranged between 
r = .58 to r 5 .90. Therefore, it can be seen that the two 
former correlations are definitely smaller in size than any of the 
other correlations. This indicated that there was little tendency 
for high scores in the classification test to accompany high scores 
in the placement or terminal tests. 

4. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN CORRELATIONS OF THE VETERANS’ 

SAMPLE AND THE CONTROL GROUP. 

The size of the differences ranged from .42 (control 
group - Grade XII vs..first year university and terminal tests 
alone vs. 1st year university) to .74 (control group - Grade XII 
vs. first year university and classification test vs. 1st year 
university). 

The r’s had been obtained from two independent random 
samples and their differences, being clearly significant, the 
conclusion was reached that no matter how often similarly selected 
samples from the two parent populations were compared, some

Chapter VI . 

CONCLUSIONS, IMPLICATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS 

FOR FURTHER S TUDY . 

1. CONCLUSIONS. 

The tasks undertaken were the determination of the 
relationships between various pre-matriculation school tests 
and university results; a comparison between the veterans’ 
sample and the control group; and the inference as to the 
effectiveness of training in the pre-matriculation schools. 

The following conclusions, based on the data, were reached: 

(1) In every instance a definite relationship between pre¬ 
matriculation tests and university success was obtained, 
as previously mentioned, rising from a low correlation 
in the classification test vs. 1st year university 
results to a marked correlation in the terminal tests 
vs. 1st year university results. 

(2) The classification test, or intelligence test, which had 
been prepared to determine the mental maturity of the 
ex-service personnel before entering the pre-matriculation 
schools, does not appear to have been of good predictive 
value in determining university success. The r between 
the classification test and 1st year university results

was only .2^ and hence there was no definite tendency for 
high marks in the classification test to correspond with 
high marks in first year university results. 


Other investigators have corroborated the fact that 
the correlation between intelligence and academic success 
is not necessarily high (Chapter III.). Horn (1, p. 396 ), 
in his essay, says: 


"The influence of intelligence, however, 
as measured by any given test, can easily 
be over-estimated. For while the reported 
correlations between intelligence scores 
and achievement are positive, they are not 
high, even in curricular areas where 
intelligence presumably must play an 
important part.” 


To discriminate between those students who should or 
should not have proceeded to university, the intelligence 
test might be invaluable. However, on the basis of the 
evidence presented by this study, the classification test 
was of little value in the prediction of success in 
university. 


(5) The placement tests showed a definite correlation with 
university success. However, there was no consistent 
relationship between high scores in placement tests and 
high scores in university results, r = .^2. The 
original purpose of this set of tests, namely to determine 
the academic ability and educational background of the 




.

) . 







- 55 - 


prospective candidate and to find out at what level 
the student was prepared to study, was an excellent 
one. Yet, as a predictor of university success, like 
the classification test, it had little value. 

(4) The terminal tests showed a marked correlation with 
university success, r = .50. This, in part, may be 
attributed to the fact that these tests were in 
reality Grade XII final examinations of previous years. 

The terminal tests were taken after a period of training 
in the pre-matriculation schools, whereas the placement 
tests were taken without any previous training. Conse¬ 
quently, the correlation between terminal tests and 
university success was much higher than the correlation 
between the placement tests and university success. 

The investigation was concerned with the study of 
the pre-matriculation schools prior to June, 1946. During 
this early period, students were permitted to write their 
terminal examinations at any time they felt prepared to 
qualify for matriculation standing in the subject. This 
meant that a student could, if he so desired, write only 
one examination at a prescribed time, rather than write 
six or seven in a week as is the custom in Alberta high 
schools. As a consequence, his marks in the terminal 
tests were naturally high. The median mark of the sample

- 56 - 


group in the terminal tests was 77*0 (Table III. and 
Figure A) as compared to 62.4 (Table III. and Figure 5) 
in the first year university results. 

(5) There is a significant difference between the control 
group correlation and the veterans’ sample correlations 
in every case. The control group sample showed a high 
degree of correlation between Grade XII marks and first 
year university results - much higher than did correlations 
of the veterans’ sample. 

(6) The pre-matriculation schools accomplished their major 
task to grant earned matriculation standings to ex-service 
personnel who were in need of them for university entrance. 

It is, however, difficult to infer the degree of effect¬ 
iveness of training in the pre-matriculation schools unless 
a further study is made to determine the record of success 
or failure of those students who attended pre-matriculation 
schools and are at present at university. 

2. ITALIC AT IONS. 

Certain implications arose from the study concerning: 
motivation for success in the pre-matriculation school; the 
difficulty of comparison in university success between the veterans 
group and the control groups the placement tests; and the control 















t: 












- 57 - 


group correlation with university success. These implications, 
although not proved by the data, are nevertheless possible or even 
probable. As a consequence, the following inferences were made; 

(1) Motivation and strength of purpose seemed to have played 

a larger factor in determing success in the pre-matriculation 
schools than did intelligence. 

(2) There was little basis for comparison in university success 
between the student of the pre-matriculation schools who had 
been away from formal training for five and six years, and the 
student of an Alberta high school whose schooling had not 
been interrupted. 

( 5 ) The placement examination was designed primarily to test 

general knowledge. On the other hand, university courses 
demand specific knowledge. Perhaps it is due to this 
fact that the correlation between the two is low, r = .^2. 

(4) The control group correlation between Grade XII and first 

year university is very high, r - .75. Other investigators 
have shown correlations between high school and university 
varying between .60 and .70. Had the correlation been 
even as high as . 70 , there would have been no significant 
difference between the terminal tests correlation and the 
control group correlation.

5. SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY . 

(1) A sample group should be taken from those students who 
attended the prs-matriculation schools after June, 1946, 
and their results should be compared with those in this 
study. There is little doubt that with the change in 
administration of the tests, a higher correlation with 
university results would be obtained. 

(2) A further study should be made of those pre-matriculation 
students who are at present at the university. Their 
record of success of failure would further augment the 
files of the committee, and provide material for a 
"follow up" survey. 

( 5 ) Further comparisons should also be made between the various 
pre-matriculation schools in other provinces to ascertain 
their value to students who entered university. A larger 
size of sample would give more definite results to the 
committee.
