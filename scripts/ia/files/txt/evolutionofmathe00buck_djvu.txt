ABSTRACT 


This thesis presents the history of high school mathematics 
in the Province of Alberta from 1889 to 1955* It endeavors to outline 
the changes that were made in the mathematics curriculum during four 
major periods of revision* The Annual Reports of the North West 
Territories up to 1905t and those of Alberta after 1905» which contain 
inspectors 1 reports, outlines of programmes, and final examination 
papers, have assisted in providing background for the early part of 
the period* Factors such as tradition, the university, pupil needs, 
and teacher qualifications, that were influential in shaping curriculum, 
have been evaluated* Representative textbooks have been named and in 
some cases discussed. 

Two factors have been largely responsible for major adjustments 
in the high school mathematics programme, namely, the non-selective 
nature of the high school programme, and the revised attitude toward 
the doctrine of formal discipline* The former has influenced curriculum 
by changing the objective of education from preparation of a select 
group for university to that of producing good citizens. In an effort 
to meet the needs of the non-selective group in high school, experimental 
courses in general mathematics were introduced, but they did not achieve 
their objectives* The changed attitude toward formal discipline has 
been responsible for a break with tradition in the mathematics programme. 
Geometry, which was a prominent subject at the beginning of the period,

declined greatly in status. Changes in teaching methods have accompanied 
revised curriculum. Because the secondary mathematics programme must 
be subjected to frequent evaluation and revision as the needs of 
students change, a mathematics sub-committee now forms an integral 
part of the Curriculum Committee of the Alberta Department of Education.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

The aim of this study is to trace the development of the 
teaching of mathematics in the secondary schools of Alberta from the 
time of the first authorization for high schools in 1889 until the 
most recent revision of the curriculum. The study does not include 
the evolution of secondary mathematics in the technical or commercial 
schools of Alberta. Secondary schools, or high schools» comprised: 
Standards VI, VII, and VIII from 1889 to 1912; Grades IX, X, XI,and 
XII from 1911 to 1937; and Grades X, XI, and XII from 1937 to 1956. 

A survey of what constituted the mathematics curriculum at 
different periods is presented. The periods selected are those in 
which major changes in curriculum organization were instituted. An 
attempt is mad© to indicate what was taught, and, to a certain extent, 
how and why it was taught. The content of courses of study is 
frequently included to facilitate comparisons. 

Textbooks used at each period are named. Sine© they were 
followed very closely through all of the earlier periods, and offer 
an insight into the philosophy of the programme in later periods, 
brief analyses of representative textbooks are given. 

Some university regulations have been included in order t© 
facilitate a comparison of matriculation requirements with the 
changing secondary mathematics curriculum.

Fairly extensive use has been made of the Territorial and 
Alberta Department of Education Annual Reports. They provide 
inspectors* reports, brief programme outlines, and examination 
papers, which furnish an authentic source for the history of 
secondary mathematics in Alberta. 

It is hoped that the history, as outlined in this thesis, 
might prove of interest to teachers of mathematics and to curriculum 
committees. Since early educational records are few and widely 
scattered, this thesis attempts to provide a convenient record of 
the evolution of the mathematics programme in Alberta high schools.

CHAPTER II 


THE FIRST HIGH SCHOOLS 

This chapter will present an outline of the development of 
high school mathematics from 1889» when the first high schools were 
organized in the North West Territories, to 1912, the time of the 
first Alberta curriculum revision. The influence of Ontario on the 
early high schools is discussed briefly. Then, since the philosophy 
of that pioneer in Territorial education, Dr. Goggin, gave such 
impetus to the progress of this period, consideration is given 
specifically to his influence on the mathematical thinking of his 
day. The effect of contemporary psychological tenets on mathematics 
is also discussed. The chapter concludes with an account of the 
mathematics curriculum revision of 1912. 

I. EARLY ONTARIO INFLUENCE 

In 1889 the high school made its first appearance in that part 
of the North West Territories now known as Alberta.^* There was much 
in its organization and in its mathematics curriculum to indicate the 
influence of Ontario. Dr. H. C. New!and in reviewing the background 
of Alberta’s educational system has said; 

The model for these foundations.had been set up on 

the pattern of the school system of Upper Canada. 

^In 1889 a. high school was organized in Calgary with Mr. James 
•Short as principal. Calgary School District No. 7 of the Province 
of Alberta. 1885-1935 , boold-et.

The school system of Upper Canada found its statutory definition 
in the School Acts of 1816 and 1846, but the spirit that informed 
it and the philosophy that nourished it were emanations from the 
genius of Canada’s greatest pioneer educationalist* Dr. Edgerton 
Ryerson. He it was who, having visited the schools of Europe, 
particularly those of Germany and the Old Country, and having 
studied at first hand the work of the great Horace Mann of 
Massachusetts, came back to Upper Canada, firmly resolved to give 
his free, self-governing fellow Canadians the kind of schools 
they needed; free schools for a free people.^ 

Many of the earlier men of distinction in the educational life 

of the Territories came from Ontario* Examples from the Edmonton area 

are W. G. Carpenter, G. C. McKee, and John T. Ross*3 Many of the 

earlier textbooks used in mathematics in the Territories were previously 

or concurrently in use in Ontario* Examples are the Ontario High School 

Algebra , J. Hamblin Smith’s Arithmetic , and MacKay’s Elements of Euclid .^ 

It is therefore not surprising to note that there was a 

similarity in the mathematics programmesfor the Territories and Ontario 

as early as 1891* In both areas the high school was divided into three 

Forms or Standards. Algebra, geometry and arithmetic were taught at 

all three levels in the Territories. Algebra and geometry were taught 

at all three levels in Ontario, but arithmetic which was offered at the 

first and second levels, was replaced by trigonometry at the third. 

Further details regarding the Ontario and Territorial mathematics 

programmes may be found in Appendix A and Appendix B.

It is apparent that considerable emphasis was given to mathematics 
in these early years. Several factors may have been responsible. J. H. 
Minnick^ suggests that at the time of the establishment of the high school 
in America, men were actively concerned with surveying land, and were 
interested in navigation. Knowledge of mathematics was thus a necessity. 
Also, when the high school was established there were but few subjects 
with a sufficiently definite body of material for effective teaching. 

A large amount of well-organized mathematics was available. It could b© 
taught fairly effectively with very little equipment and with little 
expense. Then too, the early high school served a special group of 
young men who were preparing for college. Plato wrote over the porch 
of his Academia, "Let no one who is unacquainted with geometry enter 
here."^ 

That geometry was accorded prominence in the high school programme 
at this time is apparent in its inclusion at all three levels. Euclid, 
after whom the early courses were named, lived about 300 B.G. His 
contribution to mathematics was that he gathered together all the 
essential facts of geometry which were known at this time and arranged 
them in a logical system. However, he was not just a compiler of 
results.as is seen from the fact that he invented new proofs for theorems 
when his sequence made earlier proofs inapplicable. His ideal was to 
have all his propositions follow as necessary conclusions from certain

axioms, postulates, and definitions explicitly stated in the beginning. 
Sir Thomas Heath says of the Elements of Euclid ; 

This wonderful book with all its imperfections® which 
indeed are slight enough when account is taken of the date 
at which it appears® is and will doubtless remain the 
greatest mathematical textbook of all time. Scarcely any 
other except the Bible can have circulated more widely 
the world over® or been more edited and studied.^ 

According to ¥. B. Gray, the point of view of John Sturgeon 
MacKay in his Elements of Euclid , which was the geometry textbook used 
in the first Territorial high schools® is that mathematics develops 

Q 

mental training. The textbook contains 191 propositions® some 
deductions® and a few historical notes. 

The foms of presentation include definitions® postulates® 
axioms® symbols and abbreviations® definitions® propositions 
and deductions • ••• Euclid®s order has not been altered and 
only minor changes have been made in the proofs.^ 

Gray suggests that the student is apparently to be encouraged to 

concentrate on the solution of deductions as well as the learning of the 

propositions• 

Emphasis on geometry was a natural consequence of the nineteenth 
century emphasis on mental discipline. Locke was one of the early 
exponents of this theory* He believed that the prim© purpose of 
education was to make man a reasoning creature. The process of learn¬ 
ing rather than the thing learned was important. He maintained that 
no subject could develop the ability to reason better than mathematics.^®

The notion that the mental faculties can be developed by training 
in one subject has been known in education as the theory of formal 
discipline. The term 9 formal* implies that it is the form of the 
activity and not its content, not the subject matter itself, that is 
important in education. And 9 discipline 9 suggests the real spirit of 
the theory which is that the major virtues of tenacious memory, an 
inflexible will, pure and impersonal judgment and reason are to b© 
secured only by full and vigorous exercise of the faculties . 11 

There was general belief during this period that the study of 
Euclid would teach students to reason. At the turn of the century 
some psychologists were beginning to test experimentally the validity 
of the claims made for mental discipline but as yet their influence 
had not been felt in the classroom. 

Th© prescribed arithmetic textbook in the first high schools 
was Hamblin Smith 1 s Arithmetic which was basically an English textbook 
adapted to Canadian schools by Thomas Kirkland and William Scott. Th© 
topics discussed in this book suggest that th© point of view is on© of 
utility. There appears to be a bias toward commercial applications. 

The preface states: “Special care has been taken t© adapt th© work t© 
the wants of th© business community." Ho business forms or illustrations 
are included however.

Development of the content is by the inductive method* 
Definitions are given, examples are worked with steps of procedure 
carefully explained, and then the rule is derived* Rules are printed

in italics. An exercise to provide practice in applying the rule 
follows. 

Highly complicated mechanical questions persist, for example ;T2

Some of the problems bear little relationship to the experience 
of the students:^ 


No. 169 Of two stalactites hanging from the flat 

roof of a cavern, one is 1.02 inches longer 
than the other, and the shorter one increases 
in length at the rate of 3*014 inches in a 
century* Find the rate of increase of th© 
other in order that they may be of the same 
length at the end of 125 years. 

No. 249 Two elephants which are 10 in length, 9 in 

breadth, 36 in girth and 7 in height consume 
one drona of grain; how much will be the 
rations of 10 other elephants which are a 
quarter more in length and other dimensions. 

There is no evidence of gradation of difficulty within the 
exercises and hence no provision for individual differences. 

Examination papers have been added to each chapter. In the words 


of the authors, H These are designed to stimulate the student to think 
for himself, and to assist him in preparing for the different official 
examinations.

II. DR. GOGGIN’S FORWARD LOOK IN MATHEMATICS 

In 1893* Dr. D. J. Goggin, Principal of the Manitoba Normal 
School in Winnipeg, was appointed Superintendent of Education for the 
North West Territories. Dr. Gog gin was bom in Durham, Ontario in 
1849. Many of his ideas regarding promotions, examinations, and 
curriculum, expressed sixty-five years ago, are very similar to those 
put forth by leading educationalists today. Mathematics teaching and 
curriculum were influenced to a considerable degree during his years 
as Superintendent, 

In 1902 the Programme of Studies for the Territories was 
thoroughly revised by Dr. Goggin. He had, so far as can be ascertained, 
no committee to assist him but rather had sole authority to shape the 
courses as he saw fit. The philosophy underlying his course is 
expressed in his statement: 

In the Programme of Studies provision is made for the 
teaching of those subjects® a knowledge of which is helpful 
in the transaction of business, the duties of citizenship, 
the care of the body, and the formation of moral character.15 

The high school courses, he thought, should be framed to meet 
frontier conditions. In view of his assertion: "It is the needs of 
the pupils and not the entrance requirements of colleges and professional 
schools that must shape the high school courses of study,it is

interesting to note that high school mathematics was not deemed 
superfluous for the average student* Algebra and geometry were to 
be taught in Standards VI, VII, and VIII, arithmetic in Standards 
VI, and VII f and trigonometry in Standard VIII. The decision to 
include trigonometiy may have been due to influence from either 
Ontario or the United States. In 1891 Ontario was offering trig¬ 
onometry in Form IV. In the early 1900 1 s in the United States the 
Committee on College Entrance Requirements presented its report on 
methods of securing better articulation between high school and 
college. One of the recommendations made was that trigonometry be 
offered in the eleventh grade, for the convenience of the university, 

Dr. Goggin selected C. Smith 8 s Elementary Algebra to be the 
algebra textbook for the three high school Standards. His choice 
was apparently a popular one because this book, which was written 
by the Master of Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge, remained in 
use in Alberta schools for more than twenty years. 

The presentation of material in Smith 9 s textbook is topical. 

A series of definitions is given at the beginning of the book. An 
index provides ready reference. Answers for problems are provided. 
Each topic is presented by means of definitions of terms, followed 
by examples, and then practice is given in the application of rules. 

An English tone can be detected in the fact that English

currency is invariably used in the money problems: 

No. 29 Divide £30 among 10 men, 20 women and 40 children, 
giving to each man 15 shillings more than to each 
child, and to each woman as much as to two children. ® 

The problems on the whole tend to be theoretical rather than 
practical. Geometric progression as presented here does not include 
any problems that suggest that this topic might have application in 
everyday life. There appears to be no consistent policy with regard 
to graded exercises. One hundred and sixty miscellaneous examples 
at the end of the book provide extra work for enterprising students. 

Estimates of the effectiveness of mathematics instruction at 
this time were given in the comments of the people who marked the 
departmental examinations. Some of these comments were included in 
Dr. Goggin*s reports. With reference to algebra, on© expressed 
opinion was: 

The language used in definition is not exact .... 

Candidates draw general conclusions from too few particulars. 

They have not mastered fundamental theorems so as to be able 
to apply them. They use long methods instead of the shorter 
ones which candidates at this stage should know how to apply. 
Algebra appears to be treated as if it were arithmetic.19 

The Course of Studies recognized th© need for a yearly 
preliminary review of algebraic theory. In Standard VI, Chapters I 
to XIV were prescribed, in Standard VII, Chapters I to XX, in Standard 
VIII, th© entire book. Thus the course recommended spiralling, even 
though Smith 3 s textbook did not follow such a plan.

The official Education Reports of the North West Territories 
contain information which enables us to detect the trend of mathe¬ 
matics teaching in the early days. That the teachers might have been 
tempted to subscribe to the tenets of transfer of training is suggested 
by the structure of geometry examination papers up to Dr, Goggin* s 
time. Ebiphasis was given to writing out geometry propositions. Dr. 
Goggin did not agree with such placing of emphasis. He recognized 
the fact that study of Euclid*s Elements was meant for mature, 
intelligent students and that intuitive geometry should be given as 
an introduction to the logical. His choice of Hill 8 s Lessons in 
Geometry for study in Standard Y, and to some extent in Standard VI, 
indicates that he was keeping in close touch with current mathematical 
thinking in the world at the turn of the century. Hill was a 
mathematician from Boston , and the general point of view of his Lessons 
in Geometry was far ahead of its time. The author# while residing in 
Germany in 18?? and 1878 made himself familiar with German methods and 
textbooks» and according to his own admission freely used the knowledge 
thus acquired in writing his book. It is likely that Professor Felix 

Klein of Germany was the man who most influenced Hill*s thinking with 
regard to geometry. Klein was urging that instruction in geometry 
should M emphasize the psychologic point of view which considers not 
only the subject matter but the pupil, and insists upon a very concrete

presentation in the first stages of instruction followed by a gradual 
introduction of the logical element," that there should be "a better 
selection of material from the viewpoint of instruction as a whole," 
that there should also be a "closer alignment with practical appli¬ 
cations," and finally that the "fusion of plane and solid geometry, 
and of arithmetic and geometry" should be encouraged. 1 2 ^ 

In England too, views that were currently considered radical 
were being expressed by Perry and his followers. In 1901 they were 
advocating that experimental geometry and practical mensuration should 

precede demonstrative geometry. Practical applications and laboratory 

22 

techniques were recommended. 

Against this background of non-traditional mathematical thinking, 

Hill prepared his Lessons in Geometry "to meet the wishes of those who 

23 

prefer a shorter and easier introductory course in geometry." J There 
are ninety-six lessons which cover many exercises and problems in his 
textbook. The sequence is: introduction, straight lines, angles, 
triangles, areas, similar figures, circle, ellipse, planes, surfaces, 
and volumes. The practical uses of geometry are stressed. 

Dr. Goggin selected Hillts book as a basis for the study of the

six books of Euclid in high school. H© commented in the course of 
studies; 

At first the pupil should discover geometrical truths through 
measurement, drawing, construction, and superposition rather than 
through logical demonstration. In demonstrations, clearness of 
reasoning, accuracy of statement and elegance of form should be 
emphasized. The subject matter of each lesson should be con¬ 
sidered in its relation to life, i.e., the actual occurrence in 
nature and in the structure of machines made by man, •••• and the 
application of the propositions to the ordinary affairs of life 
should be the basis and the outcome of every exercise. ^ 

Intuitive geometry, Dr. Goggin believed, must precede, demon¬ 
strative geometry. His adherence to this line of thought appeared 
to influence the geometry examinations. Some of the questions that 
were asked on the third class tests on Euclid, after Dr. Goggin 
became Superintendent of Education, were: 


In 1896: 

1. 

(d) 

Show how the distance across an 
impassible morass may be measured. 


2. 

(c) 

Two weights ar© suspended from a 
ceiling. Are they parallel? * 2 ^ 

In 1900: 

3. 

(b) 

A farm lies between two roads not 
parallel; determine when possible, 
where the owner should locate his 




house, that it may be equally con¬ 
venient to each road. ® 

In 1902: 

If 

two straight lines intersect® the vertical 


angles are equal. 

(a) Prove this proposition (l) inductively 
according to Hill (2) deductively according 
to Euclid. 

(b) Point out the advantages of the one 
method over the other.^7

Applications and deductions outnumbered the propositions on 
the tests. At the first and second class levels the geometry tests 
were a bit more formal, but there too, an effort to question in order 
to determine understanding of basic principles was apparent. 

The comments of those who marked geometry examination papers 

at this time suggest that the teachers were adjusting very slowly to 

the recommendations of their progressive superintendent: 

...They do not clearly distinguish inductive and deductive 
reasoning. Definitions have not been learned in any exact 
way. The drawing of the diagrams is often so inaccurate as 
to lead to positive error in reasoning. 

The propositions are, as a rule, written out correctly 
and neatly. Deductions and questions based upon the 
propositions are seldom attempted. It is evident that 
memory is playing an important part in this subject. The 
examiners urge that, through marks or otherwise, the value 
of deductions be emphasized. 8 

The lecture method of instruction in mathematics was apparently 
not given precedence* One of Dr. Goggin 8 s tasks as Superintendent 
was to train teachers. Although there is little information available 
regarding procedures at Normal School in the early 1900®s, careful 
perusal of the Third Class Professional Pedagogy Examination in 
Geometry and Mensuration for 1902 would lead one to believe that 
the Socratic, or question and answer method, was approved. Two of the

5. In five questions or less show how a class can be led 

to construct a parallelogram, given one side, on© angle, 
and one diagonal. 


6. Your pupils tell you that the perpendicular bisectors of 
the three sides of a triangle meet at a point but they 
cannot prove it. Give a series of questions that will 
lead them to the proof. ° 


Hamblin Smith 9 © Arithmetic continued to be the authorized 


textbook while Dr. Goggin was Superintendent. A report of the markers 
of the arithmetic examination papers suggests that inaccuracy in 


calculation and careless reading habits were the chief factors con¬ 
tributing to lack of mastery of this subject: 

Inaccuracy in calculation, ©specially where fractions enter in 
is a marked feature of the work. The reasoning of the better 
candidates is very fair but there is room for additional training 
in the expression of this reasoning. Too many candidates think 
more of getting th© answer than of presenting a logical solution 
in good English .... 

Inability to read the questions intelligently seems a too common 
cause of failure. Reasoning power is good but th© expression ©f 
reasoning in logical order and good English, while an improvement 
on last year 1 s work, is still not up t© standard .... Neglect to 
draw figures is the prime cause of failure in a number of solutions 
in mensuration.-' 0 

Opinions similar to those expressed in the reports quoted above 
were also heard in the United States during these early years. F. Milner, 
for example, in the School Review of February, 1898, comments: 

Each September finds me ready to begin the review of arithmetic 
with my 1*K3 or more seniors .... My pupils are not accurate in 
computation, they do not hold themselves responsible for such 
accuracy; they have no habit of persistently checking their work at

each step to be sure of themselves by the way* They are afraid 
of a fraction* If the result fails to "come out even" they are 
in despair. If they chance to discover that others in the class 
get the same result, they take courage, but their own work does 
not carry conviction, for they have not learned to rely on their 
own judgment. They are not sensitive to the reading of a problem, 
and consequently have no basis for a logical method of attack. 

They fail to see that arithmetic is part of a great mathematical 
whole 

No doubt this opinion, expressed nearly sixty years ago, has been 
repeated many times since, and would not appear out of place in a 
School Review of 1956* 

Dr. Goggin felt that arithmetic should be taught so that it 
would form a natural correlation with algebra. 

When a number of problems of a given type have been solved 
the teacher may, as a method of generalizing the results intro¬ 
duce literal expressions and so prepare for the introduction of 
algebraic language and the equation. The pupil who can find what 
six apples will cost if three can be bought for nine cents can 
easily be led to find what jd yards will cost if m yards cost n 
dollars. 32 

It would require a much more exhaustive study of Dr. Goggin®s 
work than is possible here, to estimate the contribution he made to 
education in the Territories. He resigned early in 1903, having 
accepted a position with a publishing company in the East. Although 
Dr. Goggin spent less than ten years as Superintendent of Education,

his professional leadership and his progressive attitude toward

III. THE 1912 CURRICULUM REVISION 


In 1905* after the Alberta Act came into effect, a provincial 
Department of Education was organized with headquarters at Edmonton. 

By adopting many of the regulations and administrative precedents 
established by the Territorial Department of Education, this new 
Department was able to carry on smoothly without making any immediate 
changes. Apparently Dr. Goggin*s 1902 curriculum revision met with 
approval because Alberta educationalists continued to use it until 
the year 1912. 

The mathematics teachers in Alberta in the early 1900 9 s received 
very little professional leadership. Courses of Studies before 1912 
gave teachers no guidance with regard to methods of teaching mathematics. 
Inspector of Schools D® A. McKeriicher, however, felt that a need for 
guidance existed: 

There is no doubt that many teachers found the program vague 
and indefinite and that there was considerable difference of 
opinion as to its meaning .... Unless the program is fully 
elaborated I believe, too, that a teachers 9 hand-book, setting 
forth precisely the work of each grade would be found useful and 
would be appreciated by all teachers. 33

Nor did the mathematics textbooks with their ungraded exercises 

offer much assistance. Perhaps the only concrete aid that was given 

was that offered to the teachers by the inspectors on their infrequent 

visits. It was unfortunate that the rapidly increasing number of school 

34 

districts, the problems associated with teacher shortage, and unfavor¬ 
able weather and road conditions mad© it difficult for the inspectors 
to give the needed guidance to their teachers. 

J. A. Smith, of the High River Inspectorate, mad© several comments 
that suggest that he was endeavoring to guide the teaching of mathematics 
in his area: 

I would like to see more original thinking in the study of 
arithmetic in the higher standards. Encouragement should be 
accorded the pupil who proposes an alternative form of solution, 
even though it be long and clumsy, for it is the best solution 
for the individual, since it is his own thinking. The exultation 
of individual discovery and accomplishment is invaluable in the 
study of arithmetic .... The teaching of algebra in many schools 
is nothing but a confused juggling with symbols. The weakness in 
the teaching of this subject I attribute to its entire separation 
from arithmetic. The teacher should see that the pupil constantly 
holds fast to the shoreline of arithmetic while he ventures out 
upon the sea of algebra.35 

Inspector Smith’s comments were probably a reflection of a 
general move in both England and United States at this time. Perry in 
England and Moore in America were calling attention to the need for 
reorganizing curricula with special emphasis on correlation, rather 
than strictly compartmentalizing mathematical subjects.^

A survey of examination papers for this period suggests that 
the ideas put forth by Dr. Goggin in the early 1890 8 s were not being 
practised to any great extent. Out of the 124 marks on the 1906 
trigonometry examination, 80 marks were allotted for formal definitions 
and proofs, and the remaining 44 for applications.-^ Similarly, the 
geometry examinations stressed the writing of propositions with very 
few deductions. There were no practical problems of the type that 
were included in geometry tests in Goggin 9 s time. 

Mechanical application of rules with little reference to 
practicality was typical of many examination questions in those days. 

The first two questions from a 1906 final examination in arithmetic 
illustrate this tendency: 

(1) What part of 12 bushels of wheat is 


1 

7 


2 I „ 2 of 1 

of ————2--S-of -£ of 5698 bushels? 

lot U 


(2) Divide 180 by 3.14159265 correct to five places of 
38 

decimals. 

By the year 1910, regardless of the fact that Dr. Goggin 8 s 
course of studies had caused a minimum of dissatisfaction, there had 
been several suggestions that a revision should be made. Perhaps 
educationalists were anxious t© formulate a programme that was strictly

an Alberta product, or perhaps the changing ideas regarding curriculum 

as expressed in Ontario, were beginning to be felt in Alberta* "Since 

the curriculum can never remain static, it is apparent that there would 

be a number of reasons for making changes after a period of eight or 

39 

ten years when no changes have been made.” 


The Alberta Trustees*Association, in the resolutions submitted 
to the Provincial Government in 1909# included this ones 

Resolved, that the Provincial Government be memorialized 
to promptly establish an adequate Secondary School System 
that will give equal opportunities to pupils of all classes. 

And a personal opinion was expressed by Dr. W. D. Ferris, 
President of the Association, which indicated that the trustees were 
beginning to be concerned with curriculum? 

There are several factors in our school systems which tend to 
injure the health of our growing boys and girls - and what I am 
saying here applies more ©specially to the future mothers of our 
nation. In many cases the hours of study are too long. There is 
an over-load of home work. Too much cramming and too many 
strenuous struggles at the term-end examination time. I claim 
it a crime to the nation to carry the cramming system to an extreme. 
Why should the fast-growing girls of to*day be made the hysterials, 
neurosthenics and childless wives of to-morrow? 

In answer to the general demand. Dr. Rutherford began to take 
the necessary steps toward inaugurating a new curriculum for Alberta.

A committee, with Dr. Tory as Chairman, was chosen to revise the high 
school course. Twenty-one people on the committee, all of them closely 
connected with education in the Province, were given the task of revision, 
a task comparable with that which less than ten years before had been 
performed by a single man. 

As a result of the revision, the old system of grading by 
Standards was discarded. The public school course was to be divided 
into eight grades instead of the former five standards. The high school 
course was to be divided into four high sehool grades instead of three 

senior standards. This system of grading was in general use in most of 

u 2 

the eastern provinces and in practically all of the United States. 

The new course was ready by 1912. It offered considerably more 

detail to the mathematics teachers. At the public school level, for 

example, a lengthy introduction to the arithmetic course was provided 

under the headings of: purpose, sense training, counting, mechanical 

facility, use of memory, and logic of arithmetic. 

Mathematics, at the secondary level, occupied an important place 

in the curriculum. As yet there was no apparent move against 

compartmentalization. The new course prescribed algebra and geometry 

in Grades IX, X, XI® and XII, arithmetic in Grades IX and X, and 

43 

trigonometry in Grade XII, At no time in the history of our province 
has mathematics occupied a more prominent place in the curriculum.

Details regarding the content of the various courses may be found in 
Appendix D. 

A new geometry textbook, Baker*s Theoretical Geometry for Schools « 
the content of which indicated a break with absolute dependence on Euclid, 
was authorized in Grades IX and X, An examination of this book suggests 
that geometry was still studied for the purpose of developing the reason¬ 
ing powers and the understanding of the nature of proof. It cannot be 
considered an introductory course, as was Hill 1 s textbook during Goggin’s 
time. The author says with regard to the content, H A considerable number 
of the propositions in Euclid are of little or no importance in the 
scientific development of the subject, and should be discarded.Some 
propositions were simplified, some omitted, and the sequence was changed. 
The propositions are introduced without any preliminary work in drawings 
and measurements. 

There are five Books in Theoretical Geometry for Schools . Book I 
presents propositions concerned with triangles, Book II presents 
parallelism. Book III presents ratio and proportion, Book IV presents 
the circle, and Book V presents similar triangles. Additional 
propositions are provided at the end of the book for those who desire 
further study. Exercises are, to some extent, graded as to difficulty. 

Baker placed the definitions at the front of the book where they

could be conveniently located, and suggested that they should be used 
as needed. His definitions are brief. He used a single diagram, for 
example, to illustrate all of the definitions that refer to a circle 


and its parts, listing them one after the other* Figure 1 illustrates 



A secant is a straight line 
which meets the circum¬ 
ference of a circle in two 
points, cutting it in at 
least one. 

A segment of a circle is the 
figure contained by a straight 
line and the part of the cir¬ 
cumference which it cuts off, 
as DEED, etc. ■§ 


* Taken from Alfred Baker: Geometry for Schools , Theoretical., pp. 19-20. 
Baker recommended that geometry should not be completely dissociated from 
the other branches of mathematics, arithmetic and algebra, which are 
studied at the same time. 


Euclid remained in favor at the Grade XI and XII levels, and the 
geometry examinations at this time were still very formal. One of the 
questions on the 1912 Grade XII geometry paper read as follows: 

13 (a) State definition 5* Book V, and illustrate it algebraically.^ 
In order to deal adequately with such a question, it would be necessary 
to memorize mechanically the specific textbook numbers of the definitions 
used.

Matriculation regulations have always had a significant influence 
on mathematics curriculum. Under the newly organized University of 
Alberta,^ in 1908, the requirements with regard to mathematics were as 
follows: 

For all courses: Arithmetic 

Algebra, Part I 
Geometry, Part I 

For B.Sc. in Applied Science: 

Algebra, Part II 
Geometry, Part II 
Trigonometry 

Algebra and geometry, Part I, were at Standard VII level. 
Arithmetic was also at Standard VII level. Algebra and geometry. Part II 
were at the Standard VIII level. 

The foundations of Alberta *s educational system were laid during 
the old Territorial regime prior to 1905. The course of studies, 
revised by Dr. D. J. Goggin in 1902, followed closely the programme in 
use in Ontario at that time. It continued, with only minor changes, to 
be used in Alberta until the curriculum revision of 1912. The content 
of the courses was academic, hence suited to the small, relatively 
select group of students who were registered in the secondary schools. 
Evidences of belief in the tenets of transfer of training and formal 
discipline may be found in the emphasis ©n Euclid in the course.

Education, influenced this period. Dr. Goggin, who was constantly in 
touch with mathematics experiments and procedures in many parts of the 
world, endeavored to select those features that were applicable to the 
frontier conditions in the Territories. He urged his teachers to try 
to make the subject matter of mathematics more meaningful. Introductory 
courses to Euclid were included in the programme of studies so that 
geometry would not be completely formal in content. The records avail¬ 
able seem to suggest that a few years after he left in 1903» some 
regression in mathematics teaching took place. 

A wider interest in the curriculum of the secondary schools 
was in evidence after Alberta became a province. Dr. Tory was named 
Chairman of the committee which undertook the Curriculum Revision of 
1912. Under this revision, mathematics retained enviable prominence 
in the course of studies*

CHAPTER III 


THE FIRST GREAT WAR INFLUENCES CURRICULUM 


This chapter tells the story of changing attitudes toward 
curriculum during the period from 1912 to 1925® It is a story of 
inadequately trained teachers, of crowded schools, of expressed doubt 
as to what the content of the curriculum should be, and of a new concern 
on the part of the public at large regarding the aims of education® The 
background for the major mathematics curriculum changes in the years 
ahead is presented. The 1912 programme of studies was in use throughout 
the war years and continued to be in effect until the curriculum re-vision 
of 1925 was completed. Details of the 1925 revision are given and 
discussed. 


I. THE SHORTAGE OF TRAINED TEACHERS 


It is likely that the teaching of mathematics suffered during 
the years from 1912-1918 for several reasons® The lack of qualified 
teachers was a contributing factor. Of the 1,28? candidates who wrote 
high school examinations in 1912, there were 746, fewer than fifty- 


eight per cent, who passed.^ In the Annual Report for that year, C® 


Sansom, Inspector for Macleod, stated that out of 94 rural teachers 
in his inspectorate, 20 were teaching on permits, 15 on third class 
certificates, 4l on interim certificates, and only 18 had permanent 


p 

standing.

Report. 1912. p. 25.

•Permit* teachers were not, on the whole, considered to be very- 
satisfactory, The following rather blunt remark by Inspector Thibaudeau 
is characteristic of many such remarks made by inspectors during this 
period: 

The number of "permit” teachers was again reduced to my 
considerable satisfaction. As scarcely one-fifth of these 
do at all satisfactory work the chief purpose served by the 
remainder is to "perpetuate stupidity aril keep down salaries."^ 

The war of 1914-1918 too, soon took its toll, A steady exodus of 
young men, especially those with degrees who were teaching high school 
mathematics, left the secondary schools very short-staffed. Although 
300 teachers came to Alberta from other provinces in 1918 there was 
still a shortage of 800 teachers,^ Provincial certificates were issued 
to high school and university students to help meet the emergency. 

After the war soldiers were admitted to Normal School with Grade X 
standing and were offered loans to enable them to complete the 
courses.^ Thus the mathematics situation did not improve. According 
to inspectors 1 reports for this period, the continual changing of 
teachers throughout the year in many schools was loitering the standard 
of efficiency.

Similar teaching conditions existed in the United States during 
the post-war years. Professor W. D. Reeve of Teachers® College, Columbia, 
deplored the lowering of teaching standards: "Almost anyone can teach 
mathematics in the United States," he stated .... "It is an old story 
that the athletic coach is often given a class in mathematics to 
justify his employment in the school. 

II. THE RECOGNIZED NEED FOR CURRICULUM SUITED TO THE 
CHANGING NATURE OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL POPULATION 

An awareness on the part of the inspectors that something would 
soon have to be don© about the Alberta curriculum was gradually becoming 
apparent. Dr. James 0. Miller, the Provincial Director of Technical 
Education, reported in 1915 that an examination of age, grade, and sex 
classification of pupils in Alberta secondary schools indicated that 
as soon as the compulsory age limit was reached, the selective process 
became free to act, with the result that the pupils who remained in 
school were relatively a specially selected group. If a student* s 
abilities led in directions other than those provided by the school®s 
programme, there was no place for him. Therefore he dropped out before 
entering, or during the period of progress through, the high school 
grades. Dr. Miller suggested that there was a very real need for 
reorganization of the secondary curriculum.^ 

J. A. Smith, Inspector of High Schools, indicated in his 1919

Yearbook (New York: 1929), p. 142.

report that he, too, felt that reorganization of the programme of 
studies was necessary in order to provide some definite relationship 

Q 

between the subjects studied and everyday experience and work. 0 

The Alberta Teachers* Alliance, which had been established 
during the war years, was anxious to obtain a new course of studies 
that would have content and methods adjusted to the changing times. 

In 1921 an official questionnaire was sent out to all Local Alliances 
requesting discussion of the type of curriculum that was deemed most 
desirable. 

D. L. Shortliffe, M. A., Edmonton, a prominent teacher of 
mathematics, frequently expressed his views regarding curriculum in 
the A.T.A. magazine. In the February, 1921 issue, he maintained that 
two fallacies, worthy of thoughtful consideration, existed. The first 
fallacy was that all children are approximately equal in talent, and 
hence no choice regarding curricula is needed. The second, and even 
less acceptable fallacy, which negates the first, is that sine© not 
all children have the same ability, the curriculum ought to be 
adapted to the most poorly equipped. He said? 

Fully fifty per cent of our present high school population, 
or at any rate, those above Grade IX, should be at good technical, 
commercial or agricultural schools. Then we could carry ©n in the 
various types of schools a system of intensive training with the 
kind of pupils adapted to it, instead of suffering under the 
present chaos, which seems to get worse instead of better with 
every new and high-sounding innovation. We talk glibly of "practical

education", "division of labour", "efficiency" and what not, and 
yet, paradoxically enough, almost every proposed high school 
curriculum which comes forward to claim our attention represents 
the complete negation of all these fine principles. We simply 
cannot get results of any sort, theoretical or practical, by 
trying to teach everything from biscuit-rolling to astronomy to 
the same individual. 

Shortliffe*s comments lead us to believe that the nature of th© 
high school population had changed and the selective factor no longer 
existed. Apparently he found many students unable to cope adequately 
with the mathematics prescribed. 

Shortliffe presented a third interesting fallacy that had close 
application to mathematics. Some educationalists at this time were 
advocating that a child should never be taught anything that he could 
not understand at the time. This mathematics teacher*s answer to such 
philosophy was; 

It would be far more practical to refer to first principles 
only at the very beginning of any topic in arithmetic, and even 
then very sparingly, and purely as a means of obtaining a "rule" 
or tool for use. Then we should go ahead and us© the tools at 
once, paying no further attention to their origin. It is useless 
to try to teach little children the philosophy of number — as the 
present admittedly indifferent results in arithmetic eloquently 
testify. 

High school students, too, were voicing opinions concerning 
curriculum. T.E.A. Stanley of South Calgary High School conducted 
a survey using 300 high school students, in an effort to get the 
students* viewpoint. His questionnaire was an enquiry as to the amount

of time spent on high school subjects, as to which subjects were found 
to be most difficult and which least difficult, and as to which subjects 
gave most, and which least, pleasure. A condensed version of the results 
gleaned, in so far as mathematics is concerned, is shown in Table I.

the 1922 Trustees* Convention: 

Most assuredly, children need to be taught to read and write; 
they should be taught arithmetic, but beyond these essentials, 
what ought to be taught, and how much of it, is not the great 
problem of education. It is not so much what the child shall study 
that matters as that he shall learn to study. This is the great 
thing; that his mind shall be so quickened that he will realize 
that there are wonderful things to be learned; that he shall be 
so inspired that he will desire to know more; that he shall want 
to know of the great world round about him; that he shall want to 
read, want to be informed, want to knoxs. This is the greatest 
thing that any school can do for the child; means of satisfying 
that want h© will find for himself 

The unrest and social disturbance that followed the war was a 
factor in making curriculum, which had hitherto been a problem strictly 
for educational authorities, a matter of concern to the general public. 
Voices were raised in many quarters. Canada*s participation in the war, 
as a nation among nations, had apparently fostered a new consciousness 
of the meaning of democracy and the rights it entailed. 

The Alberta School Trustees* Association, which met officially 
for the first time in 190?, had early evinced an interest in curriculum. 
The 1912 and 1913 Reports of their Annual Conventions suggested that 
practiced courses such as agriculture, manual training, and cooking and 
sewing would be advantageous. And now, with a major revision in the 
offing, their voices, too, were heard. 

In 1921, A. B. Hogg, a trustee, stated his opinion at the

trustees* convention: 

.♦.. I contend we must adhere to the oldfashioned doctrine 
of the three R* s. The three R*s, like the alphabet, are not 
merely funds of knowledge, A boy fifteen years old can learn, 
fairly well, the science of farming by working on a farm. He 
can learn it better if he can read well, write well and figure 
well. But on the farm there is not likely any way of his 
learning readily to read, write and figure. Let him learn, 
then, at school, first of all, these essentials. Technical 
education or vocational training may well remain a subject 
for students well advanced. 

The Honorable G. P. Smith, Minister of Education, speaking 
to the Alberta trustees at their convention that same year, told 
very simply of the background of preparation for the new secondary 
course of studies: 

We have gone to endless pains to get the opinion of teachers, 
of trustees, of the U.F.A,, of the U.F.W.A., ©f the Women*s 
Institutes, of Boards of Trade, of Canadian Clubs, of Rotary Clubs, 
of Inspectors, in fact of almost every organisation in the Province, 
and we have volumes of material up there now which we are sorting 
out and trying to classify in order to get some idea of just what 
kind of concrete suggestions w@ have received. Of course, there 
is a vast variety of opinion as to what should b© taught in our 
schools. Some people think that if you do not teach so much but 
teach very thoroughly what is taught then you are training the 
mind of the child so that he can go out and look after himself. 

Other people think you should try to teach everything in the 
school and send out a child a walking encyclopedia, ready to 
answer anything which comes in his way. Well now, perhaps some¬ 
where in between those two extremes lies the truth. Anyway, we 
are seeking for the truth, and we are trying to work out a scheme 
whereby the revised course of studies will be modem, will be 
flexible, will be flexible to the extent that it can be adapted 
to the needs of varying conditions. That it will b© modem and 
fully up to date and represent the best thought that we can get 
on the matter in this Province may be accepted. We are making 
an honest effort to do it. We are not going to have it done just 
by inspectors or teachers or professional men. We are starting 
out gathering opinions from all over and encouraging everybody 
to send in suggestions. Then w© are organizing a committee

composed largely of laymen from various occupations in life, who 
are going to consult with us and choose the subjects which they 
think should be taught in our schools* Then a professional 
committee will act together with that layman*s committee in 
limiting the extent of the work which will be covered in each 
subject by each class* Then a committee of specialists will do 
the actual writing of the courses of study according to the 
instructions given by the other two committees. We are trying . 
to work it out on a democratic basis, and I hope we may succeed. ^ 

This was truly a democratic attitude toward curriculum, no 
doubt accentuated by post-war opposition to anything dictatorial. The 
committee selected was a far cry from Dr. Goggin 1 s one-man committee 
in 1902, and even from the strictly academic group responsible for 
the 1912 revision.

As a result of the revision, the number of subjects that any 
pupil must take was materially reduced, with the suggestion that more 
intensive study of the subjects selected might take place. Provision 
was made for courses for Normal School entrance, for Matriculation to 
University, for commercial and technical work, and for a general course 
to obtain a good general educationThus the student had five choices 
from which to elect his course, in contrast with the narrow range 
afforded by the 1912 revision. 

It was recommended that the pupil should take six subjects in 
his first year, seven in his second year, and eight in his third year 
to give him twenty-one units which would be the equivalent of Normal 
Entrance or Junior Matriculation. Eight subjects in the fourth year 
would enable him to qualify for Senior Matriculation. Promotion was 
to be by subjects, a mark of fifty per cent permitting credit. The 
Committee^ recommendation was that candidates should write depart¬ 
mental examinations in all subjects 

It was not possible for the new programme to b© carried out in 
its entirety in the first year. The plan was that the Grade IX course 
would be introduced in 1923» the Grades X and XI courses in 1924, and 
the Grade XII course in 1925.

The content of the mathematical subjects, under the revision, 
was not materially changed except in the amount prescribed. Algebra 
and geometry were offered for three years instead of four. Algebra 
lost little in quantity but gained in intensity. Theoretical geometry 
was to be completed in the junior work and analytical geometry at the 
senior level. Arithmetic was offered only at the Grade XI level. It 
was hoped that by reducing the number of subjects, hence increasing the 
time per subject per week, and by eliminating all useless material and 
intensifying the remainder, to get better results than when the subjects 
were spread over more years. 

Crawford 8 s High School Algebra replaced C. Smith*s textbook. 
Crawford*s textbook, in the words of the author who was a Professor of 
Mathematics at the University of Toronto, was ”written from the stand¬ 
point of the pupil, and in such a form that he will be able to understand 
it with a minimum of assistance from the teacher. The question method 

is frequently used in developing the theory. The purpose of this is to 

19 

lead the pupil to think for himself.” The point of view of the author 
appears to be a combination of utility and preparation for later 
mathematical studies. Presentation is by means of theoretical develop¬ 
ment, definitions, worked examples, some oral problems, written problems, 
and a few illustrations. The latter are rare, and are merely explanatory 
diagrams, but nevertheless are an innovation in algebra textbooks. For 
example, the square of a trinomial is illustrated by means of the

as outlined in the 1924 revision. There was a need for such a book. 

An introductory chapter provides ample practice in making 
drawings and measurements as a foundation for the propositions to 
follow. Angles, parallel lines, the circle , and rectilineal figures 
form the background for numerous construction exercises in which 
neatness and accuracy are stressed. Such an introduction was in line 
with Dr. Goggin*s thinking, but was missing in Baker*s Geometry. 

Four Books contain the propositions. Book I deals with triangles. 
Book II with parallelism, Book III with loci and the circle, and Book 
IV with ratio and proportion. Following the proof of almost every 
proposition there is a set of graded exercises. The authors suggest 
that students should be encouraged to work out methods of their own. 

An abundant supply of miscellaneous exercises is provided at 
the end of each Book. At the end of Book IV, for example, there is 
a set of 119 problems, followed immediately by a second set of 96 
miscellaneous exercises. These extra questions serve to challenge the 
better students as they present more difficulty than the questions 
following the propositions. 

The language used in High School Geometry is simple and concise, 
and at the level of the high school student. Another useful feature of 
the book is a page which shows symbols and abbreviations used in the 
textbook. An index to definitions is given too. The definitions are 
clearly detailed, and almost invariably illustrated. Figure 3 is an 
example.

of Studies give considerable insight into the thinking of those 
responsible for mathematics curricula at this time, that section of 
the programme is given here in detail: 

AIMS AND VALUES 

The study of mathematics has both direct and indirect 
values, which are of sufficient importance to claim a 
considerable portion of time® Some of the direct values 
are: 

1. The principles and processes of mathematics are 
applied in affairs of life common to most people, 
whatever be their vocations. This may be seen in 
the almost daily use made of Arithmetic and the 
elementary principles of Algebra and Geometry. 

2. In some of the professions and in some parts of 
certain vocations, a knowledge of the principles 
and processes of mathematics is indispensable. 

The achievements of science and industry are the 
triumphs of civilization, and would have been 
largely impossible without the aid of mathematics. 

3. A knoivledge of mathematical results, principles, 
and processes is required for work in the various 
sciences, mental and social, as well as material. 

The tendency at the present time is to reduce the 
relations existing between the forces and the 
phenomena of the other sciences to a mathematical 
basis. 

The indirect values of mathematics may be stated 
as follows: 

1. The development of generally valuable concepts of 
number and space relations, which are fundamental 
elements in mental life, together with the develop¬ 
ment of certain mathematical thought modes. 

2. An understanding of mathematical language as used 
in all fields of science, and frequently in news¬ 
paper and magazine articles. 

3. The development of a scientific method of thought, 
such as the careful investigation of situations, 
and causes, the necessity of obtaining accurate 
results, and the need of indicating clearly the 
different steps in the operation.

4, The abundant exercise of numerous valuable mental 
traits, the generalization of these traits, and 
the possible transfer of improved efficiency. 

As pointed out in the General Introduction, transfer does 
not take place automatically, but the materials in teaching 
must be organized to produce the conditions that offer the 
most favorable opportunities for transfer. While the basis of 
transfer is found in the law of normal processes of dis¬ 
sociation and generalization, yet certain factors may be 
arranged to foster and facilitate these processes. 

Few subjects, if any, afford more opportunity for the 
exercise of valuable mental traits, most desirable to transfer, 
than mathematics. The reasons for this are: 

1. The materials of mathematics range all the way 
from the simplest to the most complex, and permit 
of unlimited manipulations in teaching, thus 
permitting the arrangements of conditions most 
favorable to dissociation. 

2. The material in the field of mathematics has been 
organized from the start for purposes of teaching* 

3* The certainty and accuracy of its data transcend 
that of all other subjects. 

In the selection of the obligatory subjects, a minimum of 
mathematics is made compulsory in all but the general course. 

On account of the fact that all students have not the necessary 
abilities and capacities to make a success of this branch of 
study, they are permitted to elect other subjects, which are 
more suited to them. Sufficient mathematics is offered as 
compulsory, to determine whether the pupil has the ability 
and the desire to continue in the more advanced work. ^ 

It appears that the thinking at this time was shifting frora 

the theory of mental discipline, which had long been a popular one, 

to giving the learner something that would contribute to a broader 

and more useful life. Transfer of training was also being viewed 

more realistically and the hope was expressed that teachers would 

realize that transfer would not take place unless th© work was 

properly developed.

Details regarding the 1925 mathematics curriculum may be found 
2U 

in Appendix E. 

Although no radical changes in the mathematics program occurred 
during this period, one cannot fail to detect some uncertainty in the 
minds of inspectors, teachers, trustees, and others, as to whether the 
curriculum was serving the needs of the students adequately. A com¬ 
bination of non-selective students and many poorly-prepared teachers 
rendered the existing academic course of questionable merit. The 1925 
programme attempted to meet the needs of all students by offering five 
different paths of study. 

This was a period of transition. Former ideas regarding the 
disciplinary value of studying mathematics were beginning to receive 
critical attention.

CHAPTER IV 


THE TREND TOWARD UNIFIED COURSES 

The non-selective nature of the high school population during the 
depression years following the First Great War necessitated considerable 
revision of the mathematics programme* The courses in existence were 
proving too difficult for the average student. This chapter outlines 
the controversy regarding retention of the traditional subjects or 
acceptance, in their place, of the unified courses which were gaining 
in popularity* Details of the curriculum changes are given and 
discussed, 

I. THE UNIT SYSTEM AND PUPIL NEEDS 

When the 1925 curriculum was introduced it was expected that the 
average student would be able to undertake and complete seven units 
per school year. Before long it became apparent that although the 
average student was attempting seven units, very few passed that number. 
For example, in 1925 the results of the academic examinations for first 
and second year high school were as follows?

It was apparent that the average student could be expected to spend at 
least five years in high school. The changing nature of th© school 
population was to a large extent responsible for adjustments necessary 
in the mathematics programme during this period. 

One of the aims of the unit system was to give more students a 
useful secondary education. With the depression offering little alternative, 
students continued to attend school. In 1925* high school students 
comprised 9*955 per cent of the total enrolment of Grades I to XII 
inclusive, in contrast with 5*38 per cent just ten years before.^ 

The trustees® magazines and inspectors® reports tell a story of finan¬ 
cial difficulties, overcrowded schools, and unprepared teachers. Such 
conditions were bound to affect the teaching of mathematics at this time. 

In an editorial in the October, 1926, A.T.A. Magazine . J. W. Barnett 
remarked with reference to the situations 

The coming into effect of the new course of studies for high 
schools has aggravated an already serious situation. Before the 
institution of the unit system a student failing in one or more 
subjects of his grade was generally required to repeat and writ© 
again on ©very subject of the grade in order to obtain a pass. 

Rather than repeat a whole year f g work th© student generally quit 
altogether, and the number of "repeats’* in Grades IX, X, and XI 
was thereby reduced to a minimum. Now, however, failure in any 
on© unit is no real barrier to the student’s pride or self-respect: 
he can carry a unit indefinitely and continue in the next unit of 
every subject in which he was successful. The result is far- 
reaching. By increasing the "repeats” the high school rooms become 
correspondingly overcrowded and the larger school boards stand 
aghast at the task before them .... 

Dr. Tory, President of the University, at a Calgary meeting, 
remarked, "The number of high school students could b® greatly reduced

if those who did not want to work were eliminated, for the number of 

3 

repeaters in each grade always tend to clutter up city high schools." 

By June, 1934, the enrolment in high school grades in Alberta was 
17.58 per cent of the total enrolment, twice as many high school pupils 
as there had been ten years before, and four times as many as there had 
been twenty years before.^ The academic program of 1924, which necess¬ 
itated considerable work in mathematics, was no longer adequate to meet 
the needs of the non-selective school population. As Chief Inspector of 
Schools H. C. Newland remarked % 

This high school population is by no means a homogeneous group. 

It exhibits a wide range of differing interests, abilities and 
personalities. The great majority of the group have no intention 
of proceeding to advanced academic studies. Of the 10,513 pupils 
now in Grade IX, two-thirds will not go beyond Grade XI, approx¬ 
imately 7 per cent will go to the Normal Schools, and 4 per cent 
to the University. Our greatest problem in secondary education is 
therefore, that of readjusting the instruction offered by our high 
schools to individual needs of our adolescent population. ^ 

Although the 192 5 course had attempted to offer a varied programme 
including general, technical, commercial, and academic patterns, the 
over-shadowing influence of the matriculation and Normal entrance courses 
predominated, and the small schools were offering the academic programme 
almost exclusively. A table in the 1924 Annual Report presenting the 
distribution of pupils in secondary grades by subjects of instruction 
indicates that more students were taking algebra and geometry than any 
other subject* Complete details are in Appendix F.^

II. THE ARITHMETIC CONTROVERSY 

The subject that was proving most difficult to the non-selective 
group of students in high school at this time was the Grade XI course in 
arithmetic. Under the 1925 revision, arithmetic, which previously had 
been offered in Grades IX and X, was to be studied for one year only, 
preferably in Grade XI. Mensuration, percentage, and business mathe¬ 
matics formed the core of the course. Stanley’s A Canadian Arithmetic 
for High Schools was the prescribed textbook in 1926. 

J. A. Smith, Inspector of Schools, stated in his 1925 annual report 
that the new programme taken generally was receiving a favorable reception, 
but that the Grade XI arithmetic course was causing considerable worry. 

It is interesting to note that Inspector Smith did not recommend that the 
course be simplified and brought down to the level of the pupil. He 
commented: 

V • b; 

The teachers handling this subject find that the majority of 
the students have not the necessary thorough background to handle 
successfully the course prescribed. There seems to be throughout 
the province a very strong demand for two years of Arithmetic in 
the high school. Raising the standard of the Grade VIII course in 
arithmetic might meet this demand .7 

In 1926 the Alberta Teachers* Alliance sent questionnaires to 

high school teachers regarding the course of study, and a delegation 

laid the results before the Minister of Education in July of that year. 

One of the most frequent comments of the teachers was that the arithmetic 

8 

course was too long to be adequately covered in one year.

at their convention in 192?, said with regard to arithmetic: 

I have no objection to the subject matter of the course 
as you may surmise, but one year is too short a time in which 
to do the work, and there is urgent need of arithmetic in the 
first year of the high school course, both for its own sake, 
and for the sake of the other mathematical subjects.^ 

He suggested that if the Grade VIII examination in arithmetic were more 

searching, and the minimum per cent required in it were raised, some 

of the disabilities might be erased.. 

The trustees, too, evinced much interest in the reduction of the 
amount of arithmetic prescribed in the new curriculum. Their protests 
found expression in resolutions at their annual conventions. As early 
as 1924 the Donalda Consolidated School District Number Fifty-seven 
submitted the following resolution: 

Whereas there is at the present time no arithmetic taught 
in Grades between VIII and XI; 

And Whereas a great number of pupils have to leave school 
before they reach or finish Grade XI; 

And Whereas we believe that a better understanding of 
Higher Arithmetic will be of more use to the average boy or 
girl after leaving school than languages; 

Therefore b© it resolved that this Association ask the 
Department of Education so to arrange the course of Studies 
that in future arithmetic will be taught in Grades IX and X. 10 

After lengthy discussion at the convention the motion was defeated, 

the general feeling being that there had not really been an opportunity 

as yet to give the course a fair trial.

The following year a similar resolution was again broached: 
Resolution No* 25 

Resolved, that the subject of Arithmetic be 
taught in Grades IX, X, and XI. 

Pineher Creek S.D. No* 121. 

Mr. McNally, in speaking to the resolution, said: 

Arithmetic is not being taught in Grades IX and X for the 
simple reason that you cannot reduce the number of subjects 
carried in any one year without taking something off. With our 
new and better way of teaching arithmetic in the public school 
in the elementary grades, and one year of arithmetic in Grade XI 
confined to the application of practical arithmetic, there is 
ample attention given to the subject. ^ 

Nothing daunted, in 192? the trustees once more showed concern for the 

status of arithmetic in the high school curriculum. In that year this 

resolution regarding arithmetic was presented: 

Resolution No. 18 

Resolved that the content of Arithmetic in High 
Schools be spread over two years and to meet this 
that the content of History in IX and X be reduced. 

This request was passed to the Curriculum Committee for consideration. 

A comment in favor of the existing course in arithmetic was made 
by Inspector E. L. Fuller. Speaking to the trustees in 1928 on"Practical 
Tendencies in High School Education", he cited the new course in arith¬ 
metic as an example: 

.... it is one of the tool subjects. A great deal has been 
done within the last ten years to eliminate from our courses subject 
matter of which there is little or no need, and processes a knowledge 
of which will seldom or never be required.

As a result the practice which a student gets to-day in 
arithmetic is different from that which he received twenty years 
ago. Problems in a modem text-book are mostly such as require 
direct processes of thought, and such as may be met by the student 
in actual life situations. They are not puzzles to test power in 
abstract arithmetical reasoning. 1 ^ 


III. GRADE TWELVE MATHEMATICS 


In 1929 a Curriculum Review Committee met to discuss the possibility 
of lightening the curriculum. C. 0. Hicks, reporting on recommended 
adjustments, said: 

Very little change was deemed necessary in the case of the 
units of mathematics. The main criticisms concerned the type 
of examination papers which sometimes prevailed. By setting 
questions of average difficulty covering the whole course in 
any unit, it was thought that unusually heavy casualty lists 
might be avoided entirely. ^ 

No change was made in either Algebra I or Algebra 2, It was felt 
that Algebra 2 was still a heavy course but that it should not be 
reduced. Algebra 3 was reduced by omitting sections which included 
work with surds, the remainder theorem, inequalities, maximaand 
minima, and part of the section on annuities."^ A new Analytical 
Geometry . prepared by Principal Sheppard of Strathcona High School, 
was to be in use in the fourth year. Three chapters of Conant«s Plane 
Trigonometry . the textbook introduced in 1925 to replace Hall and 
Knight®s Elementary Trigonometry , were to be omitted.*^

By 1932 there was much discussion regarding the type of Grade 

XII mathematics course best suited to the needs of Alberta students. 

There were educationalists in both the United States and Canada who 

were advocating unified mathematics. It was not a new idea. As far 

back as the early 1900*s Professor Felix Klein of Germany stated that 

the "fusion of plane and solid geometry, and of arithmetic and geometry”, 

1 ft 

should be encouraged. 

Professor William David Reeve of Columbia University recommended 
that mathematics should not be taught in "water-tight” compartments, 
but that whenever possible, correlation should take place.^There was 
a growing feeling at this time that "Arithmetic, algebra, and geometry 
should be taught together from beginning to end, each subject illustrating 
and illuminating the other two." Much experimentation was attempted 
along that line in the United States, and perhaps the most concrete 
result took the form of general mathematics courses. 

Professor Nunn, too, had contributed to the discussion. He felt 
that the idea of a functional relationship between variables, which at 
this time was receiving more and more prominence in textbooks, would be 
the unifying element:

As soon as the symbols of trigonometrical ratios are recognized 
as capable of entering into formulas and of being manipulated, they 
should be regarded as belonging to the vocabulary of algebra. There 
is, indeed, no principle except the invalid principle of formal 
segregation, upon which we can include the study of x or a in the 
algebra course and exclude sin x or tan x. All alike are pieces 
of symbolism invented for the description and interpretation of 
facts of the external world. Each represents a typical kind of 
function. To each corresponds a specific form of curve which may 
be regarded as the graphic symbol of the function. Both algebra 
and trigonometry would gain by fusion - the former through an 
added variety and richness in the illustration of its main themes, 
the latter by the removal of the excessive formalism which at 
present obscures its value and interest for the beginner. 1 

It would appear, however, that Alberta teachers were not 


enthusiastic about the proposed unification of Grade XII mathematics. 


D. L. Shortliffe, Edmonton, in a letter to the Editor of the A. T. A. 
Magazine claimed that there were two main advocates of unified math¬ 
ematics. First, the university professors wanted it because they 
claimed it was just the preparation needed for the coming scientist or 


mathematician. The other group, he asserted, was made up of fond 
parents of adolescents who found the present course hard. They had the 
idea that a unified mathematics course would be an easy one. Shortliffe 
said? 


To a mathematician, trained under the old system, the unified 
course will look easier than the present course. To the experienced 
teacher it will appear much harder. They are both correct: The 
mathematician looks at it from the standpoint ©f the ease with 
which he, with his training under another system, can grasp the 
principles and solve the problems. The teacher looks at it from 
the point of view of one whose job it is to 'put it over'.^

He felt that the solution would be to experiment with such a course, 
but that the present programme should be retained for those students 
who really desired a mastery of the rudiments: 

We say we are democratic. Very well, then, let us be democratic 
and give the people what they want. Moreover, let us be truly 
democratic and give different classes of people what these 
respective classes desire. It is undemocratic to refuse to give 
the desired preparation to a boy who wants to study mathematics 
at say Toronto University just because his comatose comrade is 
satisfied with an inferior article. We have talked loud and long 
on the desirability of administering different kinds of training 
to different kinds of people. Let us show our sincerity by doing 
this very thing in our Grade XII mathematics. Those who desire 
a low mathematical standard are entitled to it so long as they 
grant their fellows the equivalent right to a high one. ^ 

Opposition to the unified course was also expressed by 
T. E. A. Stanley, of Western Canada High School in Calgary. Speaking 
at the Trustees* Convention in 1932, he said: 

The idea that binding together a short treatise on Algebra, a 
short treatise on Trigonometry and a short discussion on Analytical 
Geometry unifies them, any further than they are unified by their 
interrelations as at present taught, is too preposterous to merit 
serious consideration. ... Algebra would get 12 or 13 weeks study 
in the year instead of 38 weeks. It is sheer folly to contend that 
more than a fraction of the present course of training could be 
successfully attempted. ^ 

In May of 1932 the Grade XII mathematics teachers received a 
circular letter from the Department of Education, intimating that the 
Grade XII mathematics programme was to be reduced to two courses, and 
that an entirely new course in algebra, sponsored by Dr. Sheldon and 
Dr. Cook of the University of Alberta, was to be substituted for the

present one in September# 1933* 

An editorial in the A. T. A. Magazine stated with regard to the 
letter of notification: 

While it has been felt that some change in the Senior 
Mathematical courses to meet modern requirements was necessary, 
it was assumed that the teachers would be consulted when such 
change was contemplated. Naturally the teachers rather resented 
this action of the Department. Protest meetings were held both 
in Calgary and Edmonton and resolutions passed favoring exper¬ 
imentation before any alteration was decided upon. ^5 

Representative teachers met with Dr. Sheldon and Dr. Cook to 

discuss the course. Disappointment was expressed by the teachers as 

it was felt that the standard was being unnecessarily lowered to conform 

to the capacity of the poorer students, and concern was expressed as 

to the probability of the course being accepted by some of the ©astern 

universities. A committee of teachers, including Messrs. Beacom, Hicks, 

Robertson, Roseborough, Shortliffe, Asselstine, MacLeod, and Miss T. 

But chart, met to discuss what they wanted in Grade XII mathematics. They 

presented to the Department a recommendation for two courses as follows: 

Unit No. 1: A course in Algebra, revised to include some elementary 
calculus to meet the requirements of the University. 

Unit No. 2: Analytical Geometry to the end of the Circle, and a 
trigonometry course dealing mainly with the solution 
of triangles. 

After meeting with University representatives Dr. Sheldon, 

Dr. Cook, and Dr. Wallace, the teachers 3 representatives finally agreed

on the following compromise course: 

Unit No, Is An Algebra course, revised as the teachers suggested, 

a suitable textbook already on the market to be chosen, 
the content to be selected therefrom by the University, 
and submitted to the Alliance for its approval, 

p/r 

Unit No, 2; Trigonometry as at present. ° 

The University would not consider accepting analytical geometry 
even as an optional subject for those intending to take a mathematics 
or science course. However the teachers were assured that it would be 
accepted for Normal entrance by the Department of Education,^ 

It would appear that opposition to geometry at the senior level 
was first voiced by the university. Ralph Beatley, of Harvard Graduate 
School of Education, reported that a group of five members of the 
Department of Mathematics at Princeton when questioned regarding a 
course of advanced secondary mathematics replied: 

Because of the great importance of algebra in mathematics 
in college and the relative unimportance of solid geometry, we 
advocate a combination of trigonometry and advanced algebra and 
have been doing so for at least five years." 0 

And also, from a member of the division of mathematics, at 
Harvard, comes this comment: 

What is needed is drill, or practice, in correct algebraic 
manipulation. When our students fall short in algebra (I mean 
college students), it is because they cannot add two fractions 
correctly, or cannot handle exponents, or the like. It isn't 
because of theorems they don't know, like the binomial theorem*

or the relation between coefficients of an equation and the 
symmetric functions of the roots. Their big need is accuracy in 
algebraic transformations. This defect, i.e, innocence of manip¬ 
ulative ability, has a first-rate chance in trigonometry, i.e. 
analytic trigonometry. There you get transformations galore, with 
algebra and trigonometry working together.^ 

In Alberta, up to the year 1932, students completing the work for 
Senior Matriculation in the high schools were required to present credits 
in nine specified units of the fourth year, three of which had to be 
in mathematics. After considerable negotiation, in which representatives 
of the teachers, the University, and the Department of Education 
participated, it was found possible to reduce the number of mathematics 
units to two. After September, 1934, credit in Algebra 3 and Trigonometry 
I was accepted as the equivalent of Mathematics 1 of the university 

course.3° 

The domination of the university with regard to the high school 
mathematics curriculum was rather severely criticized by Dr. G. M. 
Hutchinson, Principal of Calgary Central High School, when he spoke 
to the trustees at their 1934 convention.He suggested that since 
only about four per cent of the secondary school students go to college 
it was rather absurd that concern should be felt regarding adapting 
the curriculum to meet the requirements of the university:

. * •• As you know, a new course of Algebra has been arranged 
so as to include calculus and to embody the more modern ideas. 

In spite of certain difficulties (l) that all teachers are not 
familiar with the material, (2) that the ground-work of Algebra 
1, 2, and Geometry 1, 2, is not the best foundation to build such 
a course on, (3) that many students cannot find sufficient time 
to give to this subject to master it thoroughly, it is generally 
conceded that the new course, in its place, is an excellent one. 

To the boy or girl with an aptitude for mathematics it is a real 
course. It gives them the proper kind of training and even the 
most difficult parts are well within the limits of their com¬ 
prehension. Such students like it and their teachers like it. 

But it is altogether too difficult for those who have little 
liking or aptitude for mathematics. Such students, to get along, 
must spend hours every week on it, time required for other work. 
They are subjected to a great deal of mental anguish, and get 
nothing out of it. Unless the Department sets a very easy paper 
in June, many of them after doing their best all year, will fail. 

A too easy paper will kill respect for the course. 

The Department recognizes this fact and makes Algebra 3 an 
optional subject, but the University requires all students to 
take it for credit towards First Year standing. And of course 
nearly all students take it because all want matriculation 
standing for reasons already stated. To me, the situation is 
unreasonable. Until 1933» Geometry 3 was required as a unit. 

From now on it will not be accepted... Because of the requirements 
of the University, the course in Grade XII Mathematics is too 
rigid. The objections just mentioned would be overcome if a 
student could present any two units in Grade XII Mathematics or 
could substitute a Language or History of Literature for Algebra. 
Is it comprehensible that a girl who intends to specialize in 
History and English must have Calculus in her first year but 
cannot count History of Literature as a unit? ... It is readily 
appreciated that a student taking up engineering or specializing 
in mathematics should have all of those subjects taught in the 
course....^ 


The Algebra 3 course was revised in 193^* at which time a new 
textbook A New Canadian Algebra by Durell and Wright came into use. 
This course continued the treatment of functions of one variable begun

in Algebra Is 

The graphing of functions provides an introduction to the rate 
of change in a variable or a function, and thereby serves as an 
elementary introduction to the principles of the infinitesimal 
calculus.'*-* 

Elementary work in calculus was included in the high school programme 
for the first time. The concept of functionality was basic to the 
course. The textbook followed an inductive method. Previous algebra 
textbooks usually developed generalizations, stated laws, gave type 
questions to show the use of the law, and then provided for related 
drill. The basic purpose was to teach the use of a generalization. 

A New Canadian Algebra, on the other hand, presented exercises from 
which inductions were to be made. The student*s concept of the law 
was to grow gradually as he worked through the examples. The authors* 
philosophy is suggested in the comment: 

Repetitions of special types may e^ntually induce some kind 
of facility in handling them, but this method dulls the mind: 
it is variety alone which makes the pupil "keep thinking". ~* 

The adjustment of many teachers to the content and aims of the 
new course was not easy. At Summer School in 1933 an evening class was 
held for teachers of algebra wherein the revised course for Grade XII 
was reviewed and the contemplated textbook A New Canadian Algebra was 
examined. 35 The following summer it was deemed advisable once again 

to present a course based on the new Algebra 3 textbook,^

Some of the difficulty experienced by teachers and students 
with regard to the Algebra 3 course was attributed to the practice 
of too much rote learning and teaching in mathematics. Inspector of 
Schools H. C. Newland commented in the 193^ Annual Report: 

In general it may be said that much of the instruction now 
given in high school subjects encourages students to memorize 
factual material for reproduction at the final examination v 
rather than to assimilate ideas for practical use ... it is safe 
to say that a majority of the high school students have not the 
requisite mental calibre for mastering the abstract complexities 
of the purely academic subjects, such as mathematics and science 
»•» in many mathematics classes the students follow a memorized 
routine of mechanical manipulation, with little power of thinking 
independently about mathematical relationships, or of discerning 
them in familiar practical situations.37 

A few years later, in 1937t the Chief Inspector of Schools stated 
that the new course was not intended as a minimum requirement in 
preparation for examinations, but rather as a guide for the teacher, 
endeavoring to give him more initiative In deciding what was to con¬ 
stitute the course best suited to his students.Further comment 
was made: 

In algebra, fresh and labor-saving concepts in graphs ar© often 
ignored, and valuable time is wasted in laborious and mechanical 
point-plotting.39 

In their reports high school inspectors H. E. Balfour and D.M* 
Sullivan said that algebra is M often treated inadequately owing to

the teachers 1 unfamiliarity with the subject matter”. 

The results of the 1938 final examination in Algebra 3 showed, 
in the opinion of the marking group, "a lamentable and widespread 
ignorance of the most elementary ideas and manipulations involved in 
the course”.^ In deploring the poor results, S. W, Hooper said of the 
Algebra 3 course: 

There is no definite limit to what the course contains. In 
many questions a principle is implied, the teacher may draw 
attention to it, and presumably the students understand its 
significance. Unfortunately in too many cases the principle 
is met with only once, and teacher and student alike assume 
that the point, though interesting, is merely a side issue in 
the general subject under discussion. The result is that the 
course becomes a voyage of discovery with a great many detours 
on the way, all of course having some connection 'with the 
general route. 42 

He suggested that in theory, the aim of the new course was good, but 
lack of a definite limit rendered the external examination difficult. 

The measure of success of the calculus section in the Algebra 3 

- 

course was to a large extent dependent on a necessary foundation of 
meaningful graph work and clear ideas regarding functions. It would 
appear that the previous years 1 work in algebra did not adequately 
prepare Grade XII students for the work prescribed in A New Canadian 
Algebra .

IV. THE NEW CURRICULUM 


In 1934 the Honorable Perren Baker appointed a General Committee 
to revise the high school curriculum. The committee was composed of 
the following members: 

Dr. G. F. McNally# Deputy Minister of Education 
Dr. R. C. Wallace, President of the University 
Dr. W. G. Carpenter, Director of Technical Education 
Dr. M. E. Lazerte, Director of the School of Education 
Dr. John Macdonald# Department of Psychology at the University 
Mr. E. L. Fuller, Chief Inspector of Schools 
Mr. H. E. Balfour, Inspector of High Schools 
Mr. E. J. Thorlakson, representing the Alberta Teachers’ 
Association 

Mrs. A. H. Rogers, representing the Alberta School 
Trustees’Association , 

Mr., H. C. Newland, Supervisor of Schools^ 

One interesting feature regarding the personnel of this committee, in 

comparison with that responsible for the curriculum revision ten years 

before, is the absence of laymen. 

It became clear to the general committee that the new programme 

for Grade IX must be closely integrated with the programme for Grades 

VII and VIII. The junior high school movement, which became an important 

factor in American education about 1915* greatly influenced curriculum 
44 

in the United States. The influence spread to Canada. 

The years 1936 and 1937 were important ones in Alberta’s histoxy 
as they ushered in so many events, all of which either directly or 
indirectly influenced secondary mathematics teaching in Alberta, Enterprise 
education was introduced in the elementary grades. According to the

programme, "An enterprise is a definite undertaking; teachers and pupils 
agree on it and tacitly promise to carry it through •.• The outcomes 
of an enterprise comprise generalizations and insights, attitudes and 
appreciations, abilities and traits of character, skills and knowledge."^ 
The intermediate schools, comprising Grades VII, VIII, and IX, became 
a reality. Teachers attained professional status. The "Teaching 
Profession Act" made it possible for teachers to organize as a profession. 
The Act was passed in 1935 and amended in 1936 to make membership of all 
teachers compulsory. School Divisions were formed, thus extending second¬ 
ary education to many to whom it had not hitherto been available. Teacher 
training regulations were revised to raise the standard by requiring 
Grade XII standing for entrance to Normal School. 

The General Committee on the High School Programme took into 
consideration the large heterogeneous school population when they made 
their curriculum recommendations„ They suggested that the revised 
programme be introduced in Grade X in September, 1937 » in Grade XI in 
1938, and in Grade XII in 1939* A change was made from the "unit” system 
to the "credit" system. The school day was to comprise eight class 
periods one of which was to be used for elective study. Every subject 
was to carry as many credits as the number of periods per week devoted 
to instruction in that subject. One hundred credits would merit a High 
School Diploma. Mathematics was no longer compulsory. The only three 
compulsory subjects were English, social studies, and health and physical

education. Matriculation required seventeen academic subjects» five 
in Grade X, five in Grade XI, and seven in Grade XII. Algebra 1, 
Geometry 1, Algebra 2, and Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry, were 
academic electives worth five credits each. General Mathematics 1, 2, 
and 3 were optional subjects worth five credits each.^ 

The programme of studies for the high school was published in six 
bulletins. It was felt that the printing of separate bulletins would 
facilitate a more or less continuous revision of the programme. Sections 
or subjects could thus be revised without the necessity of reprinting the 
whole programme. Bulletin I, 1940, for example, contained; Regulations, 
Mathematics, Foreign Languages, General Shop, Home Economics, Bookkeeping 
la. Stenography la, Typewriting la, and Commercial Law.^7 

Departmental examinations were to be administered only at the 
end of Grade IX and Grade XU. Grade IX students were graded A, B, C, 
or D. There were no restrictions imposed upon A students; B students 
could elect only two academic subjects; C students were not permitted 

ho 

to take algebra or geometry; D students failed entirely. ° 

In the Introduction to the general mathematics courses the 

programme of studies outlined the aims of these subjects; 

The courses in general mathematics are offered to meet the 
needs of students whose special aptitudes or Interests do not 
lie in the field of mathematics, but for whom, nevertheless, some

knowledge of fundamental mathematical concepts and the application 
of these to practical situations of life will be of value. It 
is also a necessary course for students entering the senior 
high school with "C" standing from Grade IX, who desire to 
proceed with academic rather than with general subjects, and 
who can therefore profit from remedial work in mathematics 
before undertaking the courses in algebra 1 and geometry 1. 

To meet the needs of such a divergent group of students, the 
courses in general mathematics must contain a variety of topics 
from which the teacher may select those appropriate to the needs 
of his class. He may give the course a commercial, technical, 
or academic "bias” ... he may "dilute” the course if he finds 
it too difficult for his particular class .,. 

The teacher was not required to cover any prescribed minimum of 
of work. It was hoped that the students would be kept working at optimum 
efficiency on meaningful problems. A library of books was suggested in 
lieu of a single textbook. The programme of studies submitted a list of 
forty-six books from which to choose. General Mathematics 1 and General 
Mathematics 2 were each divided Into two sections: A and B. Section A 
was suggested as a core for all students. Section B was divided into 
three parts, the one to be selected depending on the type of school or 
of class. Details may be found in Appendix G. General Mathematics 3 
was a technical elective intended to be correlated as much as possible 
with problems that occurred in the shop courses taken by the students. 

The 1925 programme of studies had recommended the use of 
Crawford 5 s textbooks in Algebra 1, 2, and 3. The programme as outlined 
in Bulletin I, 1940, eliminated one year of study in algebra but there 
was little reduction in the quantity of material to be taught. T.E.A. 
Stanley of Calgary protested against the reduction in the time given

to algebra: 

The two-year course is not the equivalent of the three-year course, 
even with the same Humber of class periods. There is a time element 
in the acquisition of facility in algebra that cannot be ignored. 
Mental adjustment to the new modes of expression takes time. The 
progress in the subject is not directly proportional to the number 
of periods per week, any more than physical development may be doubled 
by taking sixteen hours exercise every twenty-four hours, instead of 

eight.50 

The new programme stated, with regard to algebra, that it was 
intended that the subject be approached from the point of view of the 
variable and function: 

The central problem here may be stated as follows: Given values 
of the variable, compute the corresponding values of the function. 

From the beginning the student should be directed to draw charts 
showing the curves (including straight lines) obtained by 'plotting 
the function against the variable.® 51 

The textbook selected in 1937 for Algebra I in order to implement 
the above theory was Algebra for Today by Betz, Robinson, and Shortliffe. 
Robinson was from Central High School in Calgary and Shortliffe was from 
Victoria High School in Edmonton. The textbook was reviewed in the A.T.A. 
Magazine by A. E. Rosborough of Str&thcona High School in Edmonton: 

The content of this new Algebra seems to me to be excellent. 

The topics treated are such that if mastered will make Algebra 
function as a powerful tool in the students® hands. Fundamental 
principles are stressed, and practice is furnished by means of 
a wealth of exercises. I like the functional and graphic approach 
to the solution of equations, and think the chapter on quadratics 
with two variables is particularly good. Logarithms are brought 
in their natural, place as part of the work on indices. The selection 
of topics and exercises seems to me to be the best I have seen and 
the chapter summaries, tests and review exercises should prove 
valuable. I believe that pupils will enjoy working with the book 
and that if they master the course they will know more mathematics 
than our former Algebra 2 students did.

There is just one serious difficulty I foresee. The course 
is excellent, but I fear it will prove more than can be handled in 
the time at our disposal... I suspect that the average class will 
be able to cover only from half to two-thirds of the examples given 
in the time at its disposal. 

A comment from the report of the high school inspectors in 1938 
suggests that the new textbook was a success: 

The new algebra text is serving to re-direct the work toward 
more thorough understanding of basic concepts and relationships, 
and away from long drills on the manipulation of poorly-understood 
symbols.-53 

The inspectors also remarked that the teachers were complaining that the 
context of Grade IX mathematics should be strengthened as it now appeared 
to afford an insufficient foundation for the algebra of Grade X. 

Geometry for Today by Cook, which was the prescribed textbook 
in Geometry I at this time, encouraged a more informal approach to 
geometry. Enunciations of propositions were given, as a rule, at the 
end of the chapter. Proofs of the propositions were omitted, but one 

u 

chapter entitled The Proof of Theorems gave hints as to how various 
propositions could be proven. In the words of the author: 

It is hoped that these hints will be consulted only when the 
student is in difficulty; a proof is more respected when it is 
approached through personal trial, failure and success. As the 
student begins to gain some appreciation of how his proofs rest 
fundamentally on the use of undefined words and unproved 
propositions, his earlier confidence may be somewhat shaken. 

But proofs do make the propositions hang together; there is 
system and order, even if the system is not rigid and the order 
is not irrevocable. Indeed, the student should begin to under¬ 
stand that theories and systems are not certainties or absolutes, 
but tools in human hands which may be used for furtherance or 
hindrance of human welfare ... the student is encouraged to 
explore and to organize. Consequently he should work through 
each property in detail, devise his own statements of findings 
and construct his own proofs. 3^

Quizzes at the beginning of Chapters I, III, and VI were to be used 
as pre-tests in order to determine the amount of review, new teaching, 
discussion, and problem work that would be necessary. Another new 
feature of this geometry textbook was the many illustrations depicting 
the application of geometry to everyday life. 

The course in Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry aimed to 
supplement the work of Algebra 2 with respect to the trigonometric 
functions and the graphical representation of functions ,, .^“ ; It dealt 
with some of the geometric properties of conics, and introduced some 
exercises in mechanics. During the year 1940-41 the course was to be 
based on material selected from three books: Conant, Plane Trigonometry : 
McDougall and Sheppard, Analytical Geometry for High Schools : and Merchant, 
Chant and Cline, Mechanics, An Elementary Textbook . 

Despite the use of three textbooks, the parts of the course were 
not to be treated separately.In so far as possible they were to be 
integrated with frequent reference to relevant parts of the course in 
Algebra 2.5^ Thus an attempt to encourage unified mathematics was made. 

This was a period of change in Alberta educational procedures. 

The introduction of school divisions, of the junior high school, and of 
the credit system marked this era as one with a forward look in education. 
In order that curriculum might keep pace with the growing non-academic 
element in secondary school population it was necessary to make adjust¬ 
ments in the mathematics programme. The feasibility of introducing

unified courses raised some controversy which eventually found 
expression in the acceptance of courses in general mathematics. 
The introduction of the elements of calculus was a departure from 
traditional algebra. Both arithmetic and geometry lost status in 
the high school programme. More than ever before it was becoming 
apparent that curriculum must be changing rather than a static 
entity.

CHAPTER V 


RECENT REVISION 

Increasing high school enrolments, with the resulting problem 
of educating and interesting students of varying intelligence, led 
to the need for mathematics revision during this period. A satisfactory 
curriculum had to be such that it would minister to the needs of non¬ 
university students who might provide useful service in other areas. 

The influence of tradition, current philosophies, examinations, and 
the university are briefly discussed. Consideration is given to some 
of the aims of the present Alberta programme in mathematics. 

I. CRITICISM OF INTEGRATED COURSES 

By the early 1940’s there appeared to be some question as to 
whether students of mathematics could achieve the same standard as 
formerly. H. C. Newland, Supervisor of Schools, stated in his Annual 
Report for 1940 that the new course was apparently acceptable to 
students, teachers, and parents, but that there were still some 
critics who complained about the lowering of academic standards: 

...it must be conceded that the high school group as a whole, 
embracing as it does a wider range of ability than e^er before, 
cannot reach the same standard in a subject like mathematics that 
is attained by a select group. But with a rigid programme, 
dominated by academic subjects, only two results were possible: 
either the standard of achievement was lowered, or a large number 
of students - almost a majority - was habituated and inured to

failure. With the revised programme, students can be graduated 
from the high school without failure if they elect the subjects 
proper to their aptitudes and interests: and if only those students 
attempt advanced mathematics who have a flair for the subject, the 
standard of achievement will not be lowered: on the contrary it will 
be raised. 1 

It became clear that the majority of students would persist in 

selecting algebra and geometry rather than general mathematics. The 

distribution of pupils in secondary grades by subjects of instruction 

in city and town schools in 1941 was as follows: Algebra I - 2783* 

Geometry I - 2708, General Mathematics I - 10?5» General Mathematics 2 - 
2 

352* E. L, Fuller, Chief Inspector of Schools, commented regarding 
the success of the revised programme: 

The trend in Geometry 1 continues to be away from the old 
formalization based on rigidly classified theorems and in the 
direction of increased emphasis on the significance of Geometry 
as a means of interpreting the environment. The new text in 
Geometry, introduced a year ago, has proved popular with teachers 
and students. The outline in Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry 
is still in the trial stage in the schools. A small minority of 
teachers try to cover too much detail in Algebra 1, General 
Mathematics is not fulfilling the high hopes under which it was 
launched. In many centres this subject is endured as a necessary 
evil, a hurdle which must be surmounted by the so-called G students 
in order that they may take their place in the traditional rout© 
leading to Normal Entrance or University Matriculation; where the 
teacher really appreciated the aims and possibilities of the subject 
and builds his own outline after careful diagnosis and planning, 
this course is meeting the students 9 needs.3 

The comment regarding trigonometry and analytical geometry has reference 
to the attempt to integrate the two subjects. In 1941 A. J. Cook pro¬ 
vided a provisional course for Alberta schools in which he presented a 
unified treatment of trigonometry and analytical geometry. Although the

original intention was that the course be tried experimentally for 
a period of one year and then be revised, it was prescribed for the 
ensuing six years. 

The War at this time was once again taking many of the Province*s 
best mathematics teachers to occupy positions as instructors in the 
Air Force, Army, and Navy. These were frequently replaced by inexper¬ 
ienced teachers who were often unable to maintain a high standard of 
4 

instruction. 

Alberta*s school programme, according to Supervisor of Schools 
H. C. Newland, had undergone only three revisions during the thirty- 
six years since the Province was formed. Newland was imbued with the 
idea that education should look more to the future and less to the past,5 
With the rapid changes in social, industrial and technological phases 
of life, he was afraid that education would lag too far behind. He 
recommended that a second revision of the high school programme, starting 
at the Grade X level, should be undertaken during the early part of 1942: 

No modem school programme of any kind can be expected to 
"stay put" for a period exceeding five years* duration... Many 
of the large school systems of the United States do not use a 
printed programme of studies. They employ special committees 
of curriculum experts, who work continuously with the teachers 
in rebuilding or refashioning the program of studies from year 
to year, or even from term to term. The curriculum in these 
systems is flexible and to some degree experimental, so that it 
can be readily adapted to changes in classroom activities or 
projects, or to the needs of pupils in particular groups, schools 
or communities.

When problems for study were outlined, the following were 
included: Should Algebra I and Geometry I be fused to make a new course 
in general mathematics? Should the programme provide attenuated as 
well as strength courses in mathematics? Is there still a consider¬ 
able amount of "dead wood" in the curriculum content of the academic 
subjects?"^ 

By 19^5 there seemed to be fairly wide-spread agreement among 
the teachers that the courses of study as outlined for Grade X algebra 
and Grade XII trigonometry and analytical geometry were too extensive 
to be covered completely in one year. The high school inspectors 
suggested that the difficulty was due to the fact that "many students 
who attempt these courses have no particular interest in mathematics 
or have insufficient ability to complete successfully academic courses 

o 

in high school mathematics". 

In the fall of 1945 a shortened course in general mathematics 
carrying three credits and listed as General Mathematics la was added 
to the first year programme. It was planned particularly for those 
pupils attending small high schools who needed to strengthen their 
background in mathematics before undertaking algebra and geometry.9 
The former five-credit units in General Mathematics 1, 2, and 3» were 
still available. 

The Curriculum Committee investigated and reported with regard

to the A. J. Cook textbook in Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry 
as follows: 

The sub-committee thought that* although the present book 
contained a great deal of valuable material, its form and style 
did not meet the needs of the majority of teachers. The sub¬ 
committee recommended that a new book be selected for the school 
term 1947-48, and that this book be Sprague f s "Essentials of Plane 
Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry". The sub-committee suggested 
definite revisions of the Sprague book which are being attended to 
at the present time.^® 

Th© revised textbook was in us© in Alberta high schools in 194?. The 
reception of Sprague f s book was definitely favorable.^ 

Bulletin 4, which was issued by the Department of Education in 
19509 stated that the three aims of teaching mathematics in high school 
were as follows: 

1. to provide a deeper understanding and appreciation 

of the power and usefulness of mathematics; 

2. to make mathematics a more effective tool for solving 
the complex problems of modem life; and 

3. to give a preview of, to estimate interest in, and to 
provide a sound basis for more advanced mathematics.^* 2 

Th© mathematics courses outlined in this Bulletin were Algebra I and 2, 
Geometry I, Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry I, and General Math¬ 
ematics I, la, 2,and 3»

by the Minister of Education and the President of the University, 
regarding matriculation revision: 

In revising matriculation requirements three main considerations 
seemed particularly important. It is essential that the general 
university standards should be maintained. It is desirable to give 
some greater measure of flexibility to the high school program so 
that it can be fitted to the varied needs of students» especially 
to those who may not be planning to come to university. It is 
undesirable to force on a high school student too early a decision 
concerning the faculty or school he will enter. As a result of 
consultation between representatives of the University, the Department 
of Education, and other interested parties, it was felt that certain 
changes could be made that would be in line, with these three main 
objects if it were possible to achieve an effective co-ordination 
of the high school teaching of the academic subjects with the 
university teaching, especially with the university teaching in 
the first year. It became apparent that such co-ordination was 
particularly important in two fields: namely, foreign languages 

and mathematics.^ 


The curriculum report states further that it was felt that three courses 
in mathematics, one each in Grades X, XI, and XII should replace the 
four courses presently required in the academic programme.^ Consultation 
between the high school curriculum committee and those members of the 
university staff who were familiar with the needs of the university 
with regard to mathematics, was recommended. The feeling of the two 
groups seemed to be: 

While the result will no doubt be that, at the end of Grade XII 
the amount of content covered is somewhat reduced, it is hoped that 
the necessary basic training will be given, and if first year 
university courses are well adjusted to the high school training, 
again, looking at the program of high school and university as a 
whole, it is felt that there need be no real lowering of standards. ^ 


The curriculum committee, after examining numerous current textbooks

and evaluating them, selected Mathematics for Canadians , Book 2, by 


by Bowers, Miller and Rourke to be the new Grade X textbook. This book, 
which was introduced in 1951 * followed Book I of the same series, which 
had been used in Grade IX the previous year. 

One feature of the revised mathematics programme was a new 
nomenclature for all courses. Grade X courses were to have numbers 
such as 10, 11, and 12, Grade XI courses numbers 3uch as 20, 21, and 
22, and Grade XII courses numbers such as 30, 31» and 32.^ The chief 
change in Grade X mathematics was the discontinuation of general mathe¬ 
matics. Three new courses were introduced, namely: Mathematics 10, 
Mathematics 11, and Mathematics 12. Mathematics 10 is primarily academic 
in nature and is intended for those students who may wish to take a 
matriculation pattern. However, there is no pre-requisite restriction 
whatever, and any student may include it in his programme. It replaces 
the old Geometry I course. Mathematics 10 embraces in its year*s 
work sections on geometry, algebra, and arithmetic. The geometry section 
contains propositions which cover the basic ideas regarding congruency, 
angles, area, proportion, and parallel lines. Proofs are given for most 
of the propositions. Deductions are included. Algebraic procedures of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, the solution of 
equations, factoring, and elementary procedures with functions and 
quadratics are included in the course. Arithmetical work is based on 
percentage, areas, and volumes.

The general tenor of the superintendents* comments with regard 
to the new Mathematics 10 course was favorable. 

The tea c hers find the topics, content and exercise material to 
be within the range of the pupils' ability; minimum requirements 
can be set by the teacher for the pupils who have some difficulty 
in mathematics mastery; the amount of teaching and practice 
material provided is sufficiently extensive to challenge the best 
learning effort of the pupils who are capable of advanced achieve¬ 
ment in the subject. Several of the reports are to the effect 
that the course and textbook material exceeded in length the 
amount which it was found possible to cover with the classes. 
Several request that a handbook or guide for the course be 
prepared to indicate a modified distribution of emphasis among 
the subject-sections of course and textbook. 

Mathematics 11 is a course in business arithmetic that appeals 
chiefly to commercial students. The recommended textbook is Business 
Arithmetic by Currie and Piper. Mathematics 12 is intended primarily 
for students who choose an industrial arts pattern in high school. It 
is recommended that use be made of the following two books: New 
Vocational Mathematics by Dooley and Kreigel and A Mathematics 
Refresher by Hooper. All of these new mathematics courses are five- 
credit courses. 

Mathematics for Canadians » Book 3» of the same series as the 
Mathematics 10 textbook, was introduced in Grade XI in the fall of 
1952. It is a comprehensive algebra textbook, academic in its demands. 
Since there was no provision made for the teaching of the geometry of 
locus and the circle in Mathematics 10, a supplementary booklet was 
supplied by the Department of Education so that these two topics might

be included in the Grade XI programme to form the Mathematics 
20 course. 

Informality, gained partly by the illustrations, quotations, 
poems, and chats with the students, characterizes both the Mathematics 
10 and 20 textbooks. The language used is simple. Explanations are, 
on the whole, clear. Rules are italicized and set apart from expla¬ 
nations. Exercises in both books are plentiful, and in Book 3 are 
carefully graded as to difficulty. 

Mathematics 21, usually studied at the Grade XI level, was 
expected to include topics such as statistics, purchasing, credit, 
budgets, investments, insurance and taxation, the authorized 
textbook is Mathematics for the Consumer by Schorling, Clark and 
Lankford. 

Mathematics 22, which is really an extension of its pre¬ 
requisite course. Mathematics 12, aims to give students preparation 
for entry into a technical institute or a trade. New Vocational 
Mathematics by Dooley and Kriegel is the prescribed textbook for the 
course. 

In 1953 the new Grade XII course in mathematics was introduced. 
One course, Mathematics 30, took the place of the two formerly offered. 
Miller and Rourke 1 s An Advanced Course in Algebra was the basic text¬ 
book. The first three chapters of Sprague*s Plane Trigonometry and 
Analytic Geometry , dealing with logarithms, trigonometric ratios, 
and the solution of the right triangle, were authorized. One chapter

from Mathematics for Canadians . Book 3» which has reference to systems 
of equations, formed a third section of the course. The elements of 
calculus were not included. In the preface to An Advanced Course in 
Algebra the authors state; 

.•. emphasis should be placed, not on the manipulation 
of expressions and equations but rather on the use and the 
interpretation of relationships between variable quantities... 

In accordance with these views, the present text aims to present 
the various topics of a second course in school algebra in the 
light of the function concept. Consequently the relational 
aspects of the graph, the table of values, the formula, and the 
equation are emphasized throughout the book ... While the need 
for drill problems has not been overlooked, the main object in 
the selection and arrangement of exercises has been to encourage 
the formulation of data in precise terms and the interpretation 
of results.^ 

It was found advisable the next year to introduce Mathematics 
31 as a three-credit elective. Mathematics 31 was the former course 
in Trigonometry and Analytic Geometry omitting the first three chapters 
of the Sprague textbook, which still constituted part of Mathematics 
30. The course was reinstated as a three-credit, non-examination 
elective for n the small group of students who might need such a course 
to meet the matriculation requirements of certain universities” 
Although a few schools received permission to offer Mathematics 31 9 
most students were required to take it by correspondence. The subject 
appeared to regain lost status the following year as its absence was 
beginning to be felt by the university. The 1955-1956 University of 
Alberta regulations stipulated that Mathematics 31» with B standing

mathematics, and physics. 


Ill PRESENT TRENDS 


When consideration is given to the fact that high school 
enrolments are steadily increasing and that the interests and abilities 
of today*s high school students are much more varied than were the 
interests and abilities of those of former years, the scope of the 
problem of providing a satisfactory mathematics programme increases. 
There seems to be little question as to whether or not mathematics 
merits a place in the Alberta high school programme. The Curriculum 
Branch of the Department of Education asserts: 

Mathematics is valuable and important in the modem world 
and therefore all students entering high school have need for 
more mathematical training. 

The claim that mathematics is important in the modern world and hence 
should not be omitted from any high school student*s programme, is 
supported by the two following quotations. A report of the Joint 
Commission of the Mathematical Association of America and the National 
Council of Teachers of Mathematics states: 

The paramount mathematical need of the average citizen is for 
greater knowledge of arithmetic than is now common. By arithmetic 
is meant more than computational facility and understanding of 
principles. There is needed also familiarity with applications

to a wide variety of problems or situations that confront people, 
and ability to understand certain mathematical ideas and procedures 
that may be encountered in ordinary readings. ^ 

In this connection too, from the 1950 revised edition of the 


Encyclopedia of Educational Research, comes this paragraph: 

The impact of World War II brought to light a very marked 
deficiency in mathematics among the inductees into the war¬ 
training program. The situation became so acute that the 
United States Office of Education, in conjunction with the 
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, appointed two 
committees to study the problem and make recommendations 
concerning what the schools should do to meet the emergency.^ 

Reports made by the two committees indicated that there was a need for 

a more functional program of mathematical instruction and a continu- 

ation of arithmetical experience for high school students. The aims 

of the present secondary mathematics programme for Alberta, as outlined 

in the Curriculum Guide, suggest an attempt to provide a functional 

programme. Arithmetic experience is available for those students who 

are interested in shop or commercial patterns. 

Among the factors that are exerting an influence on present-day 


mathematics curriculum are tradition, modern educational philosophy, 


examinations, and the university.

Through tradition, subjects such as mathematics, once established 

in the curriculum, have a tendency to maintain their place. There are 

still teachers, who as Professor Nutt says: 

.... are inclined to think in terms of the subject instead of 
in terms of the student. Subject matter has been standardized 
instead of stages of mental maturity of students. The teacher 
and the supervisor have been dealing with the subject so long 
that it has become a habit with them; it is regarded as something 
permanent and abiding; hence to leave out any of the sacred 
facts seems almost sacrilegious and criminal. On the other hand, 
the student is transient. Students come and students go; hence 
to leave the student out is justifiable. In fact, leaving the 
student out may be getting rid of an unappreciative butcher who 
haggles and mangles the sacred subject most horribly in his 
attempts to find food for mental maturing. The relief that is 
usually manifested by teachers and supervisors when a student, 
who is not getting on, drops out is a definite indication that 
the subject is more important to them than is the student. 

Whenever teachers and supervisors begin talking about education 
by means of the subject "getting on" in the student instead of 
the student "getting on" in the subject, then a radical change 
will come about in the teaching of secondary schools.^5 

The influence of tradition, or the feeling of satisfaction with the 

status quo, has been a retarding influence in mathematics curriculum. 

Traditional ideas regarding transfer of training have been dealt a 

blow. Professor C. H. Judd has given a clear challenge to teachers 

of mathematics in this statement: 

Mathematics as a subject cannot be described in my judgment

as sure to transfer. All depends on the way in which the 
subject is handled... Transfer is a form of generalization, 
and training can be given so as to encourage generalization, 
or training can be of such a type as to hinder generalization.^ 

If teachers wish, then,to train students to apply the basic principles 

of deductive thinking to non-mathematical situations, suitable materials 

must be brought into the classroom, and the general principles must be 

applied to a wide variety of examples. 

Professor John Dewey, an educational philosopher to whom much of 
the credit has been given for shifting major consideration from the 
subject to the child, says: 

Mathematics is said to have, for example, disciplinaiy value 
in habituating the pupil to accuracy of statement and closeness 
of reasoning; it has utilitarian value in giving command of the 
arts of calculation involved in trade and the arts; culture 
value in its enlargement of the imagination in dealing with the 
most general relations of things; even religious value in its 
concept of the infinite and allied ideas. But clearly mathematics 
does not accomplish such results because it is endowed with 
miraculous potencies called, values; it has those values if and 
when it accomplishes these results, and not otherwise. The 
statements may help a teacher to a larger vision of the possible 
results to be effected by instruction in mathematical topics.28 

Dewey implies that the educational value of mathematics represent, not 

values inherent in the subject itself, but rather possibilities to be 

realized through effective teaching. Mathematics must be taught in a 

way that will emphasize the possibilities of transfer of training 

before any disciplinary values can be realized. It has a place in a

programme of democratic education only if by studying it a student 
becomes more competent to cope with life.^9 

Similarly, Robert E. K. Rourke, co-writer of the textbooks 
authorized in Mathematics 10, 20, and 30, in Alberta, quotes and 
approves the following: 

The concept of the secondary school as a prepafcory school 
for college has fortunately given way to the present concept 
of the secondary school as an institution for the development 
of the pupil for intelligent and happy living.3^ 

Rourke suggests that we still have far to go before finding a 
satisfactory solution to the mathematical needs of the non-academic 
group. His textbooks indicate that he would encourage the develop¬ 
ment of the concept of functionality, and teaching with generalization 
in mind. 

In the setting of examinations an attempt has been made to keep 
pace with the changing mathematics curriculum. No longer is a student 
given ten or twelve random problems in a subject in mathematics, but 
rather, the test is generalized to cover as much of the course as 
possible. The 1956 examination in Mathematics 30, for example, 
presented thirty-seven questions, twenty-one of which were of the 
short answer type. Examinations have been devised to do more than 
test the measure of retention of memorized material. 31

Sub-examiners responsible for the marking of the final examination 

papers in Mathematics 30 in 1955 commented that students cannot handle 

fractions adequately, their graphs and diagrams are untidy and inaccurate, 

they fail to set up proper statements, and they lack precision in math- 
32 

ematical language.' These comments are surprisingly similar to those 
made by F. Milner fifty-seven years earlier.-^ 

The university has signified concern for the future of high 
school mathematics. In 1955 a university professor was invited to 
mark examination papers in Mathematics 30 in order that the university 
might receive a more realistic picture of the mathematics situation in 
the Province.^ Dr. W. G. Hardy, Professor at the University of Alberta, 
was responsible for a series of articles in the Edmonton Journal entitled 
"Education in Alberta", in which he said: 

... a new course, Mathematics I, to meet the watered-down 
content of high school mathematics, had to be put into the first 
.... because of the lowering of the standards in high school 
mathematics it will be more difficult to equip our graduates in 
engineering properly. You can*t have your progressivist cake in 
high school and get as much bread in university. This same 
problem of mathematics is affecting other programs in the 
scientific subjects.35 

Alberta teachers, generally, are not happy about the new

programme in mathematics. At the Edmonton Teachers' Convention in 
February, 1956, the mathematics teachers were unanimous in the opinion 
that the Mathematics 10 and 20 courses were too long to be adequately 
covered, in the time available, by the type of student in high school 
today. They requested a better textbook in Mathematics 30, and they 
wished to see Mathematics 31 reinstated as a five-credit subject. 

The teachers* comments regarding Mathematics 10 and 20 were given 
support in a statement made by the inspectors in the 1 955 Annual 
Report: 

Mathematics 20 is more effectively taught than Mathematics 10. 

Both courses are thought to be long and difficult, with insufficient 
attention to individual needs .^ 

It is apparent that the high school mathematical programme must 
undergo constant revision if it wishes to keep pace with changing social 
conditions. The present course in mathematics with its academic, business, 
and shop patterns, results in a vast majority of students electing the 
academic pattern. In non-urban schools for the year 1954-1955* 297 
students chose Mathematics 10, 43 chose Mathematics II, and 3 chose 
Mathematics 12.^ Thus, there is a wide divergence of ability among 
the students in today's mathematics classes. There is a danger, perhaps, 
in slow recognition of the rights of the more capable students who 
could benefit from an enriched mathematics programme. Currently, the

lack of homogeneous grouping has a tendency to discriminate against 
appreciation of individual needs. 

Director of Curriculum M. L. Watts^ suggests, however, that 
the mathematics curriculum regulations are flexible, and that 
principals may adapt the programme to accommodate local requirements. 

During this period the relative amount of mathematics taught 
in Alberta high schools decreased, as four academic courses were 
replaced by three. Geometry received the greatest reduction. A 
substantial coverage of algebra was maintained. Trigonometry and 
Analytic Geometry was reduced to a three-credit option. 

It now appears that mathematics curriculum revision in Alberta 
schools will be a continuous process. Constant revision is necessary 
primarily because of the changed character of the high school 
population. This revision has been further influenced by the changing 
attitudes toward the validity and feasibility of aims claimed for 
the study of mathematics.

CHAPTER VI 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

At the beginning of the period outlined by this thesis secondary 
schools in Alberta were few in number and were characterized by limited 
facilities and aims. A rather narrow classical curriculum existed in 
which mathematics was given considerable prominence. Those responsible 
for formulating courses of studies were influenced by educational 
policies in Ontario and the United States. 

Much of the early emphasis on mathematics was due to belief in 
the concept of formal discipline. It was commonly accepted that the 
training gained in studying mathematics would automatically be carried 
over into all other activities. Extreme ideas regarding formal discipline 
were discredited early in the twentieth century. Present views suggest 
that there is some transfer from one mental function to another but 
that it may be negative as well as positive and that it varies with 
intelligence and does not occur in an effective amount unless it be 
made a conscious aim both in the mind of the learner and the teacher. 

The early textbooks in geometry in Alberta followed the pattern 
set by Euclid. Until 1912 geometry was taught in all three standards 
of the high school. Dr. Goggin recognized that the pure logic of 
Euclid required mature intelligence, since appreciation of the logic 
involved in geometry need not necessarily result from memorization of 
the proofs. In an effort to compensate for the difficulties encountered 
by many students he introduced intuitive geometry as a preliminary to

the logical elements of demonstrative geometry. Baker*s textbook, 
introduced in 1912 and used as the background for study for four 
years of geometry in Grades IX to XII, gave indication of the first 
partial break with Euclid in Alberta. Some of the earlier propositions 
were simplified, some omitted, and the sequence changed. Following 
the First Great War the aims of the teaching of mathematics were 
discussed and revised, and McDougall and Sheppard*s geometry textbook 
was selected as one that was in accord with the approved aims. This 
textbook offered an introductory chapter of intuitive geometry. Many 
graded questions were provided, with the suggestion that originality 
in producing alternative proofs should be encouraged. The language 
employed was simple, and, for the first time, a textbook in geometry 
attempted to present a body of explanatory material supplementing the 
formal propositions. Cook*s Geometry for Today brought a new approach 
to geometry. Memorization of propositions was definitely discouraged 
as the book provided very few proofs, and practical applications of 
the propositions were emphasized. The 1951 revision left geometry on 
the programme as the core of Mathematics 10 where it now forms the 
major part of the course. Mathematics 10 includes algebra and arith¬ 
metic as i^ell. Only a skeleton set of propositions remains, just 
enough to enable the teacher to develop the nature of proof. 

Analytical geometry changed but little over the years. It was 
introduced first as a complete Grade XII course in 1926. Before that 
time some analytical geometry was combined with theoretical geometry

at the Grade XII level, to produce the course in senior geometry. 

Trigonometry, first introduced in the Alberta programme by 
Dr, Goggin, has also remained fairly consistent in content. Examin¬ 
ation papers suggest that there was more emphasis in the earlier years 
on the proof of laws, and in the later years on the application of laws. 
An attempt was made to introduce a unified course in analytical geometry 
and trigonometry first in 1940, when three textbooks were used, and 
again in 1941 when A, J. Cook’s provisional course was prescribed. In 
1947 it was decided to revert to a course in trigonometry and analytic 
geometry in which both subjects were clearly identified. In an effort 
to reduce the Grade XII matriculation requirements, Trigonometry and 
Analytical Geometry I was dropped from the curriculum in 1953# but it 
reappeared rather insignificantly in 1954, and more definitely at the 
request of the university as a three-credit, non-examination option, 
in 1955. 

Arithmetic was an important part of the Alberta curriculum at 
the beginning of the period. The point of view of the early texts was 
one of utility. Highly complicated mechanical questions were common. 
Routine application of rules, rather than originality of solution, was 
characteristic. In 1912 arithmetic was taught in Grades I& and X, in 
1925 only in Grade XI. Much difficulty was experienced with the Stanley 
textbook, no doubt partially due to the fact that the gap between Grade 
VIII arithmetic and Grade XI arithmetic was too great to permit effective 
continuity. The 1939 secondary programme deleted arithmetic as a

separate course. 

The algebra content over the years has remained fairly constant. 

G. Smiths algebra textbook, selected by Dr. Goggin for his 1902 
programme, continued in use in Alberta schools for more than twenty 
years. Solutions to questions were formed largely by rule and pattern, 
rather than by independent thinking. Spiralling was common. Calculus, 
which was introduced in 193^ as a new feature in secondary algebra, was 
deleted from the 1951 revision. A rather significant feature of 
twentieth century algebra was the increase in the concept of functional 
dependence or relationship, as opposed to the formal symbolism of algebra. 

General mathematics courses were introduced in Alberta schools 
under the 1939 revision. It was hoped that they would meet the needs 
of students whose aptitudes did not lie in the field of mathematics 
and who would not profit from the study of algebra and geometry. Since 
few students chose to study general mathematics, the aims were not 
achieved and it was deleted from the 1951 programme. Under the 1951 
revision mathematics courses designed specifically to accommodate those 
students interested in commercial or shop patterns replaced the general 
mathematics courses. 

The high school population during the early years was small and 
selective. Today the character of the high school population has 
changed and it is felt that consideration must be given to all of the 
students whom the aims of education are meant to serve. There is 
general acceptance of the fact that since society is always in a process

of development and hence the character of the secondary school 
population undergoes modification, secondary school curriculum 
must keep pace by offering frequent revision. To this end, 
curriculum revision committees are a permanent part of the educational 
system. Tradition is no longer regarded as a sole criterion for the 
selection of subject matter. Programmes of study are thought of more 
as means to ends rather than ends in themselves and subject matter 
can be justified only if it is the means through which desirable 
educational objectives can be attained. 

Conclusions reached as a result of this study include the 
following: 

(1) The theory of formal discipline to a large extent has been 
discredited in Alberta schools. Educationalists responsible for 
courses and textbooks, however, concede the fact that transfer of 
training is a possibility if made the specific aim of the learning. 

(2) In Alberta, efforts to fuse mathematical subjects have not 
been notably successful. An attempt was made to provide an integrated 
course in trigonometry and analytical geometry but the results of the 
experiment were disappointing. 

(3) Courses in general mathematics, introduced in Alberta to 
accommodate those students whose abilities were not academic in 
nature, did not achieve their purpose. Most of the high school 
students continued to select the traditional algebra and geometry

courses. 

(4) The amount of detail provided in the official Alberta Department 
of Education programmes of study increased steadily during the period. 

In the early years the textbook was named and a skeleton outline of the 
mathematics course was supplied. Present official programmes set forth 
the aims of mathematics teaching, give details concerning the course, 
name the textbook, often indicate supplementary references, and 
suggest where to place teaching emphasis. 

(5) Examinations in Alberta have kept pace with changing philosophies 
of education. The formal examinations in evidence at the beginning of 
the period were administered to all high school students in all 
prescribed courses. At the present time, external examinations, based 
on fairly generalized, knowledge, are administered only to students at 
the Grade XII level. 

(6) It would appear that the average standard of achievement in 
mathematics in Alberta, by the time students complete Grade XII, has 
been lowered. The University has introduced Mathematics I to supplement 
Grade XII mathematics in order that a foundation for the regular 
university mathematics courses may be provided. Heterogeneous grouping 
practice may be contributing to a lox<rered standard. It is likely that 
no single sequential course can meet the needs of all types of students 
in our high schools.

ARITHMETIC: 

The introduction to this course includes the comments, "Proficiency 
in computation can be obtained only by constant drill ... conscious self- 
drill in accuracy in connection with the production of meaningful and 
useful results ••• Algebraic equations, simple and quadratic, may be 
used to great advantage in the solution of arithmetical problems... 

In mensuration the truths of geometry should be fully applied..." 

1. Rules for checking. 

2. Approximate results. 

3. Contracted multiplication and division. 

4. Ratio and proportion. 

5. .Square root, cube root, by factors.

and frustum, pyramid, sphers. 

?. Test of divisibility. 

8. Longitude and time. 

9. Percentage: Trade discount 

Profit and loss 
Taxes 

Duties and customs 

10. Interest: Simple (with tables) 

Bank discount (with tables) 

Compound (with tables)

GEOMETRY: 

"The course in geometry begins with a series of drawings of figures 
to acquaint the students with the use of mathematical instruments ... 
to teach them to construct simple figures as they are required. 

The proofs of the propositions in geometry will afford ample scope 
to the pupils for the exercise of their ability in logical thinking, and 
give them the practice in reasoning from concrete figures, and in deducing 
generalizations from the concrete examples. Considerable use should be 
made of example in solving arithmetical calculations and algebraic formulae." 

GEOMETRY I: 

1. Facility in the use of geometrical instruments. 

2. Knowledge of plane figures and their elements. 

3. Practice in solving simple geometrical problems, including easy deductions.

GEOMETRY 2: 

1. To continue study of the properties of plane figures and the 
principles of plane geometry with simple exercises. 

2. To give training in the definition and solution of geometrical 
problems both theoretical and concrete. Theoretical proofs will be 
required on all the work of this course. 

3. To provide the geometrical knowledge and secure the technique required 
for more advanced mathematics. 

4. To train the pupils to use these geometrical principles in the solution 
of problems of immediate personal interest in the school and home, 

and in correlated science.
