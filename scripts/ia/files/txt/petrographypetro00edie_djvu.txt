ABSTRACT 


Cameron Elver volcanic belt, located fifty 
miles northeast of Yellowknife, ll*W*T*, consists of a 
steeply dipping Arohean assemblage of volcanic rocks and 
intercalated sills# The belt strikes north, is overlain 
stratlgraphlcally by a thick series of greywacke type 
sediments to the west, and intruded by a granodiorite 
batholith to the east# 

The volcanic rocks are largely light to dark 
green weathering pillowed lava flows, wlt^ minor inter- 
bedded agglomerate and tuff# The younger lava flows are 
more sialic than the older; basalt, andesite, dacite and 
finally rhyolite were successively extruded. 

The sills, which were injected along agglomerate 
horizons, consist of dark green weathering gabbro and 
diorlte# 

The volcanic rocks and Intercalated sills have 
been regionally metamojTphosed* As the granodiorite con¬ 
tact is approached frcsa the western part of the belt, 
there Is a progressive increase in metamorphic grade# 

In the lowest grade of metasiox*phiara, the basaltic and 
andesitic rocks consist chiefly of secondary feldspar, 
chlorite, and epidote# At a higher grade, hornblende 
appears, and with increasing netamorphism gradually takes

Since the initial mineral discovery in 1934, 
the Yellowknife Bay area has been noted for its 

spectacular gold deposits* (Lord, 1941) Althou^ the 
chief interest has centered around Yellowknife Bay 
itself, a good deal of exploration has been done in the 
surrounding district* The Prospect Street Syndicate 
was organized In 1946 in order to explore a belt of 
volcanic rocks along the Cameron River, some fifty 
miles northeast of Yellowknife* 


LOCATION OP MAP-ARSA 

The map-area covers only part of the belt of 
volcanic rooks which trend in a northeasterly direction 
along the Cameron River* This belt is shown on Plate 
IV, Geology of the Yellowknife-Beauliou area and Plate 
I, Geological Survey map 646A, Gordon Lake South, 
District of Mackenzie*

The author spent two seasons on the Cameron 
River volcanic belt and during that time was in charge 
of field work for Prospect Street Syndicate. The first 
season^ 1946, was devoted chiefly to initial prospecting 
which was rewarded with some success* During the summer 
of 1947, the exploration program consisted chiefly of 
dlaiaond drilling and geological mpping* 

file mpping, which covered an area of about 
three square miles, was carried out with tlic aid of 
enlarged aerial photographs. The scale used was on© Inch 
to 600 feet. In reproducing this map for the thesis, the 
scale was reduced to one inch to 1,000 feet. 


SCOPE OF THESIS RE3EABGH 


The research consisted primarily of a micros¬ 
copic examination of twenty-seven thin sections of rocks 
collected by the author from the map-area* These thin 
sections are considered to be fairly representative of 
the various rock types Aich ware employed as units in 
the field mapping* 

The microscopic examination was made in order to 
determine the mineralogical assemblages, textures and struc¬ 
tures of the rocks. "Hiis information, coupled with a 
chemical analysis of the granitic intrusive was used to

SOME C0HCEFTS OF REaiOHAL 

METAMOBFHISM 

General Conceptsjana^Derta^tl^on^ 

Metamorphism is broadly defined as any change, 
physical or ahemieal, in a rook# However, as practically 
all rooks have been modified to some slight de^ee since 
t^ey were formed, the term metamorphism is commonly 
reserved for those extensive changes involving new 
crystallisation or new textures throughout the body of 
the rock -- usually those changes below the belt of 
weathering involving higher temperatures than those 
normal at the surface* (Grout, 1952, p.375) 

Regional metamorphism is defined by Turner 
(1948) as metamorphism over wide areas under the com¬ 
bined influence of raised temperatures, variable 
pressure, and high shearing stress, all of which vary 
through a wide range of intensity# 

Hecrystalllxation is one of the most prominent 
of metamorphio processes* It is essentially constructive, 
and minerals are commonly enlarged or new ones are formed 
by It, The new crystals may be of the same composition 
as the original or may be products of reaction* Ho 
change in the total composition of the rock is necessitated, 
but heat and water are so universal that B<me changes in

hydration ar© eoimon and more or less addition or loss 
of other materials is not rare* {Grout 1952, p.405) 

l*h8 physical conditions that bring abo\it and 
control metamorphism are temperature, pressure, and 
shearing stress* A fourth factor, of great importance 
in facilitating and accelerating chemical and mechanical 
adjustments to these conditions, is the chemical activity 
of aqueous solutions and gases percolating through the 
intergranular network of the rook* Temperature Is the 
principal condition determining the nature of the 
assemblage of minerals produced by metamorphlsm of a 
rock of a given composition* Pressure also has some 
direct influence in this connection* High shearing 
stress, developed during the metamorphic deformation of 
rocks, usually under high confining pressures, not only 
directly determines the structure of the metamorphic 
rock but, like the circulating pore solutions, facilitates 
chemical reaction. The mineral assemblage produced also 
is possibly determined partly by the intensity of the 
shearing stress during chemical reconstitution of the 
rock* {Turner, 1948, p.4) 

The conception of metamorphism to be kept con¬ 
stantly in mind is that it is of a progressive nature* 

In response to rising temperat\n:*e, the substance of a 
given rock passes through a certain sequence of trans¬ 
formations, the stags actually reached depending upon 
the highest temperature attained. In the original rock.

however, there are. In most cases, some constituents which 
are more susceptible to change than others, in the sense 
of being affected at an earlier stage of the rise in 
temperature* They may dissociate, or react with one 
another, or merely recrystallise* In any early grade 
therefor© such a rock is only partially metamorphosed. 

It consists partly of new and recrystellised minerals, 
partly of ^residual** minerals still Intact* With con¬ 
tinued rise of temperature these are in turn drawn into 
the sphere of the process of metaimorphismi so that in 
any advanced grade the rook may be regarded as totally 
reconstituted, ttfarker, 1952, p*12) 

A ntmher of textural texmis applying to the 
preceding discussion of metamorphic rocks have been 
extensively used throu^out this thesis. Some of these 
terms are defined by Tyrrell (1941) as follows: 

Grystalloblastic — a texture in metamorphic 
rocks in which complete recrystallization has taken 
place* It does not show a hiatus in grain size, 

Blastophitic ~ a texture in metamorphic rocks 
wlierein original ophitic texture is recognizable. 

Biastoporphyritic — a texture in metamorphic 
rooks herein original porphyritic texture is 
recognizable. 

Palimpsest ~ a texture in metamorphic rocks 
herein reiiaaants of original minerals or textures are 
preserved.

Porphyroblastlc ~ a texture to metamorphlc 
rocks to .isshich metacjTysts form large crystals embedded 
in a fine grained groundmasst Ilk© the phenocrysts of 
a porphyrltic igneous rock* 

One of the earliest men to demonstrate the 
possibility of mapping zones of processive regional 
metaporphism was Barrow* His work was carried out on 
the Dalradian schists of the Highlands of Scotland, 
toe Dalradian schists arc regionally metamorphosed 
geosynclinal sediments. Injection of granite magma in 
the deeper levels contributed in Bcmo measure to local 
elevation and maintenance of hi^ temperature* Increase 
in degree of metamorphism was correlated directly with 
rise to temperature so toat isograds {lines of equal 
metamorphic grade) were also isothermals. Each zone of 
progressive metamorphism is defined by an index mineral, 
toe first appearance of which (to passing from the low 
to hi^er grades) marks the outer limit of the zone to 
question. Barrow chose politic (argillaceous) rocks, 
both on account of their wide distribution in the 
Dalradian and because of their sensitivity to variations 
in t©iiQ>@ratur©s and pressures, toe sequences of index 
minerals, to order of increasing metamorphic grade, is 
chlorite, brown blotit®, almndine, staurolite, kyanite, 
sillmnite. (furner, 1948, p.56}

Basic igneous rocks are also sensitive to 
temperature variations and maj therefore be used in 
metamorphlc soning* In derivltlves of basic igneous rocks, 
association of chlorite with albite at low grades, and of 
hornblende with more calcic plagloclase at medium and 
high grades is characteristic* However, neither chlorite 
nor amphibole is a satisfactory zonal index since, as 
shown especially by the work of Wiseman (1954), chlorite 
survives throui^out the biotite sons as defined for 
associated pelitic schists, ^11© the hi^-*grade hom^ 
blendes merge Into aetinolitic amphiboles that are 
stable under some conditions even at the lowest grades 
within the son© of chlorite* (furner, 1948, p.59) 

1*h© original minerals of basic igneous rocks 
are chiefly calcic plagioclase, a\igite, olivine, and 
iron ores, including boUi llmenite and magnetite* fhe 
anor^ite molecule of plagioclase is unstable under 
regional metamorphism, and breaks up into solsite, 
epidote, prehnlte, etc*, with the liberation of the 
albite* Under low ^ade metamorphism the products of 
the alteration merely psuedc^orph the feldspars as a 
very dense mlcrogranular mixture* Ihls substance is 
known as saussiirite and the alteration is called 
saussuritisation*

At an early stag© of metamorphism any ferromag- 
nesian mineral may break down into chlorite. The altera-^ 
tion of pyroxenes to chlorite frequently gives rise to 
calcite and quartz as by-products. In the next stage of 
metamorphism, hornblende may be produced directly from 
pyroxene, and epidote or zolsite and quartz may develop 
as by-products of the change* This process is known as 
uralitiaationi the secondary hornblende psuedomorphous 
after augite being called uralite. Dr. C.E. Tilley 
states that the hornblende may arise by chemical Inter¬ 
action between chlorite and calcite, or between chlorite 
and epidote, bo& reactions requiring the addition of 
silica. {G.W. Tyrrell, 1941, p.310-311) 

In the Dalradian and Moine series of Scotland 
a number of basic sills have been intruded at numerous 
horizons and subsequently metamorphosed in coimon with 
those strata* Their grade of metamorphism can therefore 
be correlated with the scheme of zones already established 
for the pelitic sediments, and representatives are found 
in every grade from the lowest to the highest. The 
primary minerals of these rocks were presumably chiefly 
basic plagioclase and pyroxene. In the lowest grade is 
a calclte-albite-ehlorite-schist and next an albite- 
epidote-ohlorite-schist, which may still carry calcite 
in greater or less amount, the next step is marked by 
the production of hornblende, still within the chlorite 
zone as indicated by the associated sediments. The

mineral appears first as slender needles embedded in the 
chlorite and sometimes enclosed in the albite. With 
progressive development of hornblende in this and the 
succeeding (biotite) asone, the chlorite rapidly 
dwindles, and the epidote is somewhat reduced in amount* 
Little granules of sphene appear about the same time* 

There is thus a distinctive type of albite-epidote- 
hornblende-schist, in ^ich hornblende gradually becomes 
the principle constituent* Hornblende continues to be 
the characteristic mineral in most higher grades, and 
the rocks may accordingly be named amphibolites* Ihe 
absorption of feldspar-substance into the hornblende is 
fovmd especially in the bluest grade of metamorphism* 

In entering the garnet son©, chlorite soon disappears, 
and the feldspar passes through oligoclase to andesine* 

Ihe epidote minerals may, however, survive in part well 
into the garnet-sone, giving as a recognised type an 
epidote-ai^hibolit©* Failing this, the rock is simply 
a plagioclase-amphibolite* In the highest grades of 
metamorphism (kyanite and sillinanlte sones) the 
^ mineralogical constitution is generally the same, but 
the rocks are of coarser texture, and often show little 
or nothing of a schistose character* Frcma amphibolites 
in the ordinary sense, they pass to hornblende-plag!o- 
clase-gnelss* Tlie feldspar is commonly a medium cmdeslne* 
{Barker, 1932, p*278-2a5)

Metamorphism of rocks of Intermediate and acid 
composition follows the same general lines as before, 
but with mlneralogical differences such as are easily 
predicable frcsa the different bulk-composition of the 
rocks# In 1±ie lowest grade a rock of mean acidity is 
represented by a calclte-*albite-3©ricite**chlorite-schist, 
and this is succeeded by albite-^pldote-sericite- 
chlorite--schist* Ihes© differ from the corresponding 
basic types by the coming in of a certain amount of 
white mica and quartis and usually by a hii^er content 
of albite aa compared with chlorite and the lime minerals# 
The early formation of acicular hornblende, which was a 
noteworthy feature in the former case, is not found here, 
but hornblende makes its appearance with advancing 
metamorphism, as chlorite and epidote dwindle# Biotite 
also becomes a prominent constituent, with or without 
some muscovite, and such rocks may be styled biotite- 
hornblende-schists# ‘The feldspar at this stage is 
oligoclase* Of the still higher grades of metamorphism 
in rocks of this kind there is less certain knowledge* 

The intermediate rooks comprise a wide range 
of bulk-analysis# In passing frc®i sub-basic to sub¬ 
acid rocks, quarts, potash-feldspar, and micas increase 
in amount, while chlorite, epidote, and hornblende 
decrease# The plagioclase too, becomes more restricted

to thB aodic end of the series» even in the most highly 
metamorphosed types* 

In rocks of definitely acid composition^ the 
proportion of chloi*it© and epidote is further reduced, 
and hornblende does not form* Quartz is more abundant, 
and white mica is the next constituent in importance* 

^en the primary minerals have been completely broken 
down the lowest grade is a sericite-schist* There is 
usually sufficient chlorite and iron-*oxide present to 
give rise in due course to biotit© but failing this a 
muscovite-quartz-schist is formed* Serlcitisation of 
the feldspar may begin and be completed at an early 
stageI but this is dependent upon the conditions and 
in particular upon a sufficient quantity of water* 

The reverse change, from mica to feldspar, belongs to 
an advanced grade* Biotite may bec<^© dissociated too, 
and its place taken by a red garnet* The final product 
is a gneissic rock often with a granoblastic or granulitic 
fabric* {Barker, 1932, p*286-290)

XI PEDOLOGY OF THE CAMEHOK HIV'ER 


VOLCAHIC BELT 


GEHEHAL SfATEMEHf 


Cameron Biver volcanic belt shown on plate 
If runs northwest Boss Lake and then swings north 

and northeast along Cameron fiiver. It ranges in width 
fro^a a fraction of a mile to two miles* The belt con¬ 
sists of lava flows with some interbedded tuff and 
agglomerate and minor intercalated sills* Iha volcanic 
rocks and associated sills form the oldest member of the 
Yellowknife ^oup and are of Archean age. 

Along the contact with the overlying sedimen¬ 
tary rocks, the flows strike parallel to the contact* 
According to Henderson (1945), they are vertical or 
overturned so that they dip at angles of 90® to 75® east 
and southeast* Some of the flows contain well-preserved 
pillow structures from which excellent determinations of 
the attitude can be made. All observations throughout 
the belt indicate that the flows top west and northwests

The Cameron River volcanic belt is in contact 
with a granitic bathollth to the east. This contact 
clearly shows an intrusive relationship indicating that 
t^e granitic rooks are younger than the rocks of the 
volcanic belt* 

The youngest rocks of tlie map-area are 
diabase dykes isdilch strike in a northwesterly direction.

specimen about 1700 feot farther east (slide E 16) is 
completely recrystallized. Ilmenite which is partly 
altered to leucoxene, appears to be a primary mineral 
but the hornblende is regarded as a product of 
recrjstallizatlon* 

In thin section, there is no evidence of 
original atxnictures which would serve to distinguish 
flows from sills* If any such evidence did exist, it 
has been obliterated by metamorphism* 

~ These rocks are recrystallized 
voloanics derived from massive basalt (la)* In the 
field they appear as medium to coarse grained olive-grey 
weathering rocks* ^^eathared surfaces are, as a rule, 
pitted, due to differential weathering of the less 
resistant feldspar* 

The greenstone, occurring in the eastern part 
of the map-area, is riddled with narrow granitic intru- 
sives of no particular shape nor pattern* The greenstone 
in all cases is not uniform. Frequently streaks or bands 
of markedly schistose material are noticeable on an out¬ 
crop* These bands are as a rule less than two feet wide 
and generally are highly contorted. Their schistose 
nature is attributed to high biotit© content* Although 
the author did not collect any of the schistose type for 
thin section study, glistening flakes of biotit© were 
observed on fresh surfaces of this rock.

A thin section of rock of generally massive 
character (E 24) shows the chief minerals to be hornblende 
(45^) and ollgoclase (35^) with minor amounts of blotite, 
quarts and ilmenlte* The texture Is crystalloblastlc, 
IlmenitCt ii^ part altered to leucoxenet is regarded as 
the only primary mineral* 

** Basaltic 

agglomerate and tuff beds occur chiefly in lenticular:* 
masses amongst the older basaltic flows* Ihe maximum 
thickness of the agglomerate and tuff Is less than 200 
feet and no agglomerate or tuff horizon can be traced 
for more than 1500 feet along a trike* Most of these 
beds appear to be heterogeneous mixtures of pyroclastic 
material* Fragments of bmb and lapilli size my frequently 
be observed* The fragments characteristically weather 
wit^ a pitted brownish surface as contrasted with the 
relatively smooth dark greenish grey surface of the 
matrix* 

A few imrrow bands of agglomerate smterial 
appear to grade into tuff at toe top* A sli#it color 
banding suggests stratification within this fine grained 
imterial* Ll^t olive*grey lamina© alternate with those 
of a darker greenish color* 

Microscopically, the basaltic agglc^rates and 
ttiffs vary a great deal in mineralogical composition*

The rock is a biotite-labradorite-horn-

rocks consist iminly of hornblende, labradorlte and 
quartz with minor amounts of ilmenlt© and biotlte. Of 
two tuff beds investigated, one has a similar composition 
to the aggl<®orat0s, but another is radically different* 
ihe predominant minerals in t^iis rock are biotlte and 
labradorlte with minor amounts of hornblende, quartz 
and ilmenite* 

All of the basaltic agglomerate and tuff rocks 
exhibit crystalloblastio textures* Of the four slides 
emmlned, three showed sli^t schistose structure with 
slight mineralization consisting of pyrrhotlte, carbon¬ 
ate and pyrite* 


flows 

constitute a considerable portion of the early succession 
of irrupted tmterial* They are characterized by well 
developed pillow structure* In a few instances, however, 
these rocks were observed to grade into massive types*

The typical pillowed basalts are fine grained, 
greenish-black weathering rocks* Quartz amygdulas, l/S 
to 1/4 inch in diameter, are cooiEon* The pillows appear 
bean shaped and their outer covering Is usually about 
one half inch thick* On the weathered surface, this 
shell invariably weathers out to fora a **U** shaped

The characteristic shape of pillows can be 
used to determine the attitude of beds* In all instances 
where pillows were closely examined, the tops Indicated 
that the successively yo\mger flows were to the west* 

"!he long axes of the pillows vai*y from less than a foot 
to over four feet* Ihese axes strike in general, 
parallel to the local trend of formations* 

A thin section (E 13) of on© of these flows 
shows the principal constituents to be hornblende (7C^) 
and basic plagioclase (ISfS) with minor amounts of quarts, 
clinosolsite and ilmenite* tte texture is crystallo- 
blastic* Quarts is considered to be prlmax^y amygdule 
filling and ilmenite too, is believed to bo of a primary 
nature* Hornblende, plagiocXase and clinoaoisite however, 
are regarded as the products of recrystallisation* 

These rocks 

form a distinct variety of pillow lavas* Their occur¬ 
rence is restricted to the southern part of Uie map-area, 
where they form a mass some 700 feet thick and 3800 feet 
long* 

In appearance, these rocks are medium to 
coarse grained and weather to a mottled greenish-black 
and pinkish-grey color^ Aclcular hornblende crystals 
in a matrix of feldspar are readily discernible in the

In comparing these rocks with the finer grained 
pillowed basalts (Ic}^ there is commonly a marked 
difference in pillov/ structure-# In the coarsex' grained 
flows, the margins of the pillows are much thicker, 
generally one to two inches wide* Moreoi^er, these 
borders are less distinct but they do present uimilstak- 
able e¥idenca of pillo?/ structure* 

k thin section (E 23} indicates that the 
principal minerals of these rocks are hornblende and 
andesinc in nearly equal proportions with a minor 
amount of ilmenita. Of these, ilmenite is considered 
to be the only primary mineral and the texture Is 
crystalloblastic, 

Feldspar^por^h^r^ flow^ * 

This porphyrltic flow rook is one of the best horison 
markers in the map-area and may be traced on strike for 
a distance of over 7000 feet. Its average thickness is 
about 200 feet but locally it swells to a thickness of 
500 feet* 

Characteristically, this rock eslilbits an 
uncommon type of porphyrltic texture, Phenocrysts of 
white weathering feldspax’ about the sise of hens eggs 
are widely scattered throughout the rock# On an outcrop, 
it is usual to find only one or two phenocrysta witliin 
an area of a square yard although locally they may appear 
more numbrous# The groundmass of the rock la medium 
grained and weatliers to a dark greenish-grey color.

Mlcroscopically, this rock consists chiefly of 
oligoclaso^ chlorite and hornblende, and is andesitic in 
co^osition. (thin section E 22) Small asionnts of 
biotite and tltaniferous smgnetite are also present* 

The texture is distinctly porphyroblasticj the primary 
feldspar phenocryats having been coa^Jletely recrystal** 

Used to a fine grained aggregate of oligoclase and 
chlorite* 

- This 

flow rook, like the porphyry previously described (le), 
is a good horison marker. It may likewise be traced on 
strike for a distance of over 7000 feet* Its thickness 
varies from about 50 to 150 feet. 

The chief difference between this rock and 
the previous porphjry (le) is the number and else of 
phenocryats* Whit© weathering phenocrysts of feldspar 
up to an inch in diameter are quite numerous, and locally 
may comprise ten percent of the rock. The phenocryats 
give the flow the general appearance of the ”bird porphyi^y” 
which is common amongst tlie volcanic rocks of the Yellow¬ 
knife Bay area* 

The flow shows pillow structure but this Is 
rather poorly developed and in fact may be absent 
altogether in certain places.

A thin section of the groundimss of this rook 
shows the principle constituents to be hornblende, 
chlorite and oligoclaae in about equal proportions, with 
a minor amoimt of ilmenite. (thin seotlon E 21) The 
rock is andesitic in composition* The texture is fine 
grained and appears to be blastophitic. Except for the 
ilmenite, all of the constituent minerals ai^e considered 
to be of metenorphlc origin. 

Ande£l^ejj^ ms^a^ve - these rocks are quit© 

widespread among the ^c^mger flows In the western part 
of the map-area. A mss of this rock over 900 feet 
thick outcrops south of ‘lurph/ Lake but in general 
accumulations of this material are much thinner. 

In the field, these flows weather to a light 
greyish-brown color, they are generally massive and 
devoid of pillow structure although locally a few 
poorly defined pillows are present. 

Under the microscope, a thin section shows tlie 
chief minerals to be andeslne, dilorite, lawsonite, 
epidote, quartz and llmsnlte in decreasing order of 
abundance, (thin section E 7) the textux*© is 
chrystalloblastic and with the exception of ilmenite, all 
of these minerals are considered to be products of 
recrystallization, the particular slide illustrates the 
effect of saussuritization and chloritization of primary 
minerals of the rock. 


PLATE DC 


Andesite, massive (Ig), thin section E 7, 
ordinary light, X 60, 


The rock is an andesine-chlorlte- 
epidote-hornfols and belongs to the lowest 
grade of metamorphism represented in the 
map-area. It consists chiefly of the dissocia¬ 
tion products of primary feldspar and pyroxene; 
a microcrystalline aggregate of andesine, 
chlorite, lawsonite, epidote, and quartz. 
Clusters of ilmenite crystals (black) are 
scattered throughout the slide. 


Andesitic tuff (Ih), thin section E 3, 
ordinary light, X 60. 


The rock is a quartz-biotite-schist, 
The lower part of the photo consists largely 
of andesine with numerous inclusions of 
biotite and the upper part of quartz (relatively 
lifcht) with only minor inclusions of biotite. 
Some of the andesine has been replaced by quartz 
and the serrate structure Is due to a concentra¬ 
tion of biotite around the edges of irregular 
unreplaced areas of andesine.

BPl • These frag- 

mental rocks weather ll^t grey to buff and are irregularly 
distributed atmongst the later flows of the map-area* They 
are of a lenticular nature and can seldom be traced for 
more than fifteen hundred feet. Their average thickness 
is about fifty feet. 

On the weathered surface, so®e of these beds 
show fra^ents of bomb and lapilli sise in a fine grained 
matrix. Others are more uniformly fine grained and these 
are apt to be cherty. In a number of places, there is a 
suggestion of stratification in the finer grained beds* 

A thin section of a fine grained cherty tuff 
from the northeast shore of Murphy Lake shows the mineral 
constituents to be largely mica, quarts, and andesine in 
decreasing order of abundance. The mica, which is 
responsible for the slight schlstosity of the rock, 
appears to vary in composition frc^ pal© green sericit© 
to reddish-brown biotite. The rock is highly silicified; 
in certain areas of the thin section, the feldspar has been 
completely replaced by fine grained quartz. The texture 
is crystalloblastic and no significant amounts of primary 
minerals were recognized. 


Andes it© " ^desitls pillow lavas 

are largely confined to the western part of the map—area. 
Masses of this rock vary from less than fifty to over 
five hundred feet in thickness. TTie largest mass contains

a considerable portion of interbedded agglomeratlc 
material and can be traced for about 6000 feet. How 
ever, most of the bands of lava are continuous for 
less than a thousand feet, 

fhe flows are fine to medium grained rocks and 
are characterized by their light greenish-grey weathered 
surfaces as contrasted to the darker basaltic types. 
Pillow structure is generally well developed and is 
similar to that observed in more basic types. In places, 
however, these flows appear to grade into flow breccias. 
In one locality, about 1500 feet east of the northern 
part of Murphy Lake, the pillows are variolitic. 
Spherules, abcaxt the size of peas, weather out along the 
Inside edge of the pillows, 

A thin section (1 5) of a flow from an outcrop 
about five hundred feet west of Murphy Lake shows the 
following mineralogical composition: Oligoolase 4^, 
hornblende 30^, chlorite 16^# llmenlt© 6^ and biotite 
4^, A section {M 6) of a stoilar appearing flow about 
1600 feet farther east shows a composition as follows: 
oligoolase 56^, hornblende 35^, ilmenite 4^, biotite 
2% and chlorite 1^, Ihese slides show a significant 
difference in relative proportions of feldspar, 
hornblende and chlorite* Both slides show crystalloblas- 
tic texture, with ilmenlte the only mineral considered 
primary. 


PLATE X 


Andesite, pillowed (li), thin section E 6, 
ordinary light, X 60. 


The rock is an oligoclase-amphibolite 
composed chiefly of fibrous hornblende (dark) 
and secondary feldspar (light). Ilmenite 
crystals (black) are scattered throughout the 
slide. The texture is crystalloblastic. 


Plow breccia, dacitic (U.), thin section 
E 4, ordinary light X 60. 


The rock is an andeslne-quartz-chlorlte- 
schist. The groundmass (clouded) consists of 
secondary feldspar with numerous fine poik&ilitic 
inclusions of chlorite. In the photo (upper 
right) is an aggregate of radiating clinozoisite 
crystals (high relief). In the lov/er left part 
of the photo fibrous actinollte occurs in an 
area of clear quartz, probable amygdule filling.

Hocks of this type are 

the dominant lavas in the northwest part of the map-area* 
A continuous band of this material may be followed for a 
distance along strike of over six thousand feet* The 
band pinches out west of the north end of Murphy Lake 
but is still continuous at the north boundary of the 
imp-area* The average width of the band is about one 
thousand feet* 

Ihe rock typically weathers to a light olive- 
grey color and is fine to medium grained* Angular 
fragments are usually lighter in color than the imtrix 
frequently project about the general surface due to 
differential weathering* 

Under the microscope {thin section E 4), the 
rock appears to consist chiefly of andesine, chlorite, 
and quartan in decreasing order of abundance, with minor 
amounts of actlnolite, clinosolslte, and ilmenite* The 
rock shows an amygdaloidal structure. lenses of quartz 
with fibrous inclusions of actlnolite are co^on* 
Clinozoisite occurs in radial aggregates Md it too 
appears to be amygdule filling, probably as replacement 
of a primary unstable mineral*

thickness ranges trom less than fifty to over three 
hundred feet. The sills are coiimionly bounded on the 
top or bottom by a schistose band of agglasjeratic or 
tuffaceous origin. 

The sills are smssive and coarse grained with 
a greenish-grey weathered surface. This surface, upon 
close examinatian, has a speckled appearance produced by 
dark green to black horablende or ohlox'^ite set in a light 
greenish-grey feldspar matrix. 

C^e large sill in the extreme northern part of 
the map-area, appears to have a porphyritlo top ten to 
fifteen thick. On the weathered surface, li^t greenish- 
grey phenoerysts of feldspar up to one half inch in 
diameter, project aboire the darker colored matrix. 
Although no contact with the main gabbro mss was 
recognised, this porphyritic band may have been the 
result of cca^oait© intrusion. 

In thiin section, sills which are relatively 
close to the granodiorlte contact are exposed chiefly 
of oligoclase (25 to 45^) and hornblende (50 to 70^) 
with minor amounts of ilmenite (thin sections E 18, B 19). 
Farther to the west and northweat, Ux® mineralogical 
composition is more complex (thin sections B 15, E 17, 

E 20). Oligoclase is predominant, chlorite the chief 
fex^caaiagnesian mineral, hornblende, epidote and blotite 
occur in leaser amounts. The ilmenite content (five

are commonly crystalloblastic or porphyroblastic but

the lower metamoi^hic grades, feldspar aggregates are

rhyolite forms a striking topographic feature visable for 
many miles# 

The rhyolite is fine grained and slightly 
schistose* Locally, it exhibits characteristics typical 
of flow breccias# 

In thin section {E S), the rock is made up 
largely of mica and quartz to nearly equal amounts. The 
mica varies frcmai pale green sericite to reddish—brown

In the Gordon Lake area, the volcanic asse^lage 
is overlain stratlgraphically by a thick succession of 
sodlmentarj rocks consisting chiefly of thin bedded 
greywacke with minor slate, Impare arkoae, and quartsite^ 
Many of the greywaoke beds show gradation of grain size 
from coarse at the bottom to fine at the top* l&ere 
does not appear to be any structural unoonfomity between 
the flows and sedimentst In fact intsrbedding of flows 
and sediments in places along the cmtact suggests that 
volcanism gave place to sedimentation wife little or no 
intervening period of erosion {Henderson, 1959, p*4-5)* 

The associatim of greywacke type sediments 
and altered greenstones in many of the Preean^rian areas 
of the wox»ld is not mere coincidence* 

PettiJohn C1945 p*966) suggests that sediffients 
of the geologic past have sccumulatod in the main, either 
in narrow geosyncllnes (eugeosynolines) or in ahallow 
epicontinental seas (miogeosynclines)* Thm charaateristic 
features of eugeosynollnal sedimentation include the great 
thiclmess of the deposits, the predaninance of greywaekes 
marked by graded bedding, and the presence of associated 
tuff and spilitle greenstone* In contrast, the sediments 
of epicontinental embayments (miogeosynclines} are cross- 
bedded well-washed sands, pure limastones and thin bedded 
shales, all of slii^t thickness* Since tlie deposits of 
eugeosynclines are orogenically deformed and downfolded.

they tend to be prosjorved, ishereas the undcfomned and 
thin accumnlaticTiS on the stable "platforms" are stripped 
by erosion. It follows, therefore, owing to the many 
opportunities for prolonged erosion since the Archean, 
that the only Archean sediments remaining today are 
tiiose of eugeosynclinal or erogenic aspect. 

The lava flows of the Cameron River volcanic 
belt appear to fit the general pattern of Archean 
eugeosynclinal deposition* 

Along Cameron River, the volcanic asserablage 
is considered to be incomplete due to assimilation of 
lower merabers by post-Yellowlmife granitic intrusion* 
Evidence of this is shown by the apparent variation in 
thickness of the assomblage due to truncation of the 
lower part by the granodlorlte mass to the east* 

{plates I and IIj* 

Of the voi.canic rocks exposed, there is in 
general, a continuous gradation from altered basaltic 
rocks at the bottom to dacitic and rhyolitic rocks at 
the top* 

This phenc^enon seems to be an ©xai^le of magma 
differentiation, duo to crystal settling in a reservoir 
deep within the earth^s crust {Larson, 1948, pp*162«l?2)* 
However, if differentiation by crystal settling actually 
took place in a magma reservoir, the yoimger succession 
of flows should contain a smaller percentage of the iron 
ore minerals* This is not the case in the imp-area, for

excepting the rhyolitic rocks, ilmonite (or titaniferous 
mgaetite) is present in all the rocks in rotiglily the 
same proportions* The only evidence for crystallization 
before extinision is the presence of large phenocrysts of 
feldspar in two of the rock types (le. If). Although a 
thin section of one of those porphyritic rocks shows an 
apparent deficiency of the ir(m ore minerals, this is 
attributed to the fact tliat the section is not represen-^ 
tative of t^e flow aa a whole, but consists largely of 
one altered phenocryst. 

Although no feeder dykes were recognized in the 
map-area, it is a well known fact that lava flows which 
cover large areas are formed by fissure Irruption rather 
than from central vents, fhe mechanics of extrusion are 
unknom but this may be envisaged as follows* During 
Uie development of a geosyncline by lateral compression, 
extension joints form alcsig the floor in a direction 
noraal to the axis of the basin or tension J^ractures 
form in the arclied area along the flanks of the geosyn¬ 
cline forming rifts parallel to tlie orogenic belt. 
Fracti«*lag of the floor or flanks of the geosyncline 
periodically relieves compressioiml stress imd ccmfining 
X'^ook pressure is drastically reduced at depth along the 
fissures. The fissures therefore, extend <mly to a depth 
such that the acacmipanying decrease in pressure has the 
effect of changing the rocks to the fluid state, ^us 
xaagma is generated and flows out over the floor of the 
geosyncline.

In the Gordon Lake area, the early rifts "tapped” 
undifferentiated basaltic magma, later flows a magma 
chamber differentiated to an andesitic composition* Final 
product of the chais^er was a rhyolitic magma* 

Some of the basaltic and andesitic flows of 
the mp-area show excellent pillow structure whereas in 
others this structure is wanting and the rock asaiames a 
massive character* 1h© reason for this is obscure but 
the answer is probably linked with the conditions under 
which the lava was extruded* 

In his article on "Submarine Pillow Lavas of 
Southeastern Alaska", A*F* Buddington (1926) makes the 
following statement* 

"Pillow lavas are of widespread occurrence 
in the formations of the Lower and Middle 
Ordovician, Middle and Upper Devonian, 

Permian, Upper Trlassie, and to a minor 
extent of the Upper Silurian in South-* 
eastern Alaska* Evidence shows that they 
all origimted under submarine conditions* 

Tertiary volcanics are present in large 
volume, but were formed under subaerial 
conditions and show practically no pillow 
lavas* Tamse data all support the 
hypothesis that pillow lavas, where 
developed in quantity over a wide area, 
are of subaqueous origin"* 


Since the qualifying oemditions are met, the 
pillow lava flows of the Cameron River volcanic belt are 
probably due to subaqueous conditlcHns while those in 
which pillow structure is wanting may be attributed to 
extrusion tmder subaerial conditions*

Flow breccia is a comaon structure in the 
dacite and rhyolite flows* The formation of flow brec¬ 
cias rather than massive or pillowed types is attributed 
to their higher silica ccntent* hence more viscous 
nature* A ncsi-elastic skin quickly forms on these 
lavas after eruption* This skin continually breaks up 
as the lava flows along and becomes incorporated within 
the liquid portion. This process continues imtll the 
i^ole mss consists of angular fragments to a viscous 
matrix which finally congeals. ThB angular fragments 
my consist in part of pyroclastic material blown from 
the mils of fissures and scattered over the top of the 
flow* 

Tuffs and agglomerates are formed by inter¬ 
mittent ©xplosive action that takes place in a volcanic 
eruption* This produces a fragmental type of igneous 
material (Tyi^ell» 1941, p.l5). In the Oamron Hlver 
volcanic belt the fra^ental rocks occur between imlike 
lava flows or# not uncommonly, within thick masses of 
more or less similar flow rock* The pyroclastlos 
generally are lenticular, a reflection of enviroj^ent 
of deposition* The pyroclastic mterial probably 
accumulated on an undulating surface and subsequent 
aerial or aqueous transportation agents redeposited 
the mterial in localllsed depressions. The presence 
of laminated bedding in some of the finer tuffaceous 
material Indicates a water-lain deposit#

Pyroclastic beds m&j be contaminated by sands 
and muds of sedimentary origin ^ich are co-deposited with 
the volcanic material (Tyrrell 1941* p*15). Contamina¬ 
tion of this sort probably accounts for the high (up to 
60^) biotite content of a nuihar of tuffaceous and 
agglomeratic rocks# 

Some tuff beds (thin section B 3) have a cherty 
appearance due to partial replacement of feldspar by 
silica bearing hydrothermal solutions# 

Sills of gabbro and diorite have extensively 
intruded the volcanic assemblage east of Cameron River. 

Th 0 mechanics of Intrusion is a subject of specxilation 
biit they possibly orlgimted in the following manner* 
During lulls between active lava eruption* fissures 
C€mtaining fluid mgim were sealed off near surface by 
plugs of congealed imterial of the same composition# 

Under these conditions* efficient increase in pressure 
from below caused bodily injection of magma along cleav- 
able horizons* without rupturing the surface covering# 
Magma followed agglomerate or tuff bands laterally trom. 
fissures until these beds terminated or the mgma became 
too visccms to flow, Thus <mly tuff and agglomerate 
lenses that are transected by fissures of this type are 

■ A; ■- - 

subject to sill intrusions# 

Remnants of agglomerate or tuff beds are present 
in a number of places along contacts of sills in the map- 
area* thus substantiating the preceding hypothesis.

Because only remnants of these beds remain, a consider¬ 
able porticai of the pyroclastic material has probably been 
assimilated by the intrusive sills* 

Althou^ sills may have been injected at a 
number of times during the Img period of vulcanism, 
their eoii^osltions are similar to the basalt and andesite 
flows, so that their age, for the min part, antidates 
the period of dacite flows* 

Ihe volcanic rocks and intercalated sills east 
of Cameron River have been regionally i^tamorphosed in 
the manner described in the introductory chapter* As 
the granodiorite contact is approached from the western 
part of the volcanic belt, there is a progressive change 
from low to hl^ grade metamox^hlam* 

In the rocks of basic to interned late composi¬ 
tion the low grade schists do not contain hornblende and 
are chiefly the products of dissociation of prlsmry 
pyroxene and feldapar — chlorite, epldote, and lawson- 
ite (thin section E 7}* With this mineral oompoBltlon, 
the rock is in a metamorphlc equivalent to the 

chlorite zone of the pelitic sediments* 

Increasing grade of metamorphism is brou^t 
about by development of hornblende (or actinolite) at 
th© expense of chlorite and other early dissociation 
products (thin sections S 4, E 17, E 6, E 15)* *fh 0 
hornblende in th© lower grades of matamorphism forms 
only a minor constituent of the rockj ultli^tely, in the

hi^er grades^ it becomes the dominant ferromagneaian 
mineral, and chlorite disappears altogether. The 
effect of this change is shown graphically on the 
isograd map (fig. 1). 

The isograd curves were drawn to fit data 
obtained by study of rock thin sections. For each thin 
section, the hornblende content was divided by the com-* 
bined amounts of hornblende and chlorite. This ratio, 
esEpressed as percentage hornblende, was plotted on the 
map. Thm isograd curves were drawn by interpolation. 

An apparent exception to the general picture 
is the presence of chlorite in a flow located about <me 
thousand feet east of Muri^y bake (tiiin section £ B2). 
Becauae of its orientation, this slide does not exhibit 
the schistose mtur© of the rock. The presence of 
chlorite is interpreted as being due to partial retrograde 
metamorphism of the hornblende wi^in a local sone of 
shearing* The retrograde effect of shearing action upon 
rocks of high metamorphic grade is discussed at sc^e 
length by Turner {1948, pp. B99-004). 

With reference to the isograds (plate ¥), the 
ssone of mixed hornblende and chlorite (area between curves 
1 and 3) corresponds to '^e upper part of the chlorite- 
zone and the biotlte zone of pelitic sediments. The 
outer limit of the almndine zone of pelitic sediments 
is represented by curve ^5”. In the zone between 
curve *3*^ and the granodiorite ocaitact, there is

supposedly a gradual Increase in metamorphic grade 
{staurolite, and silliaanit© grades of politic 

sediments)* However^ in these rocks the only ©videnc© 
of hi^er grad© of metamorphism is an Increase in g rain 
size 9 sine© hornblende is stable throughout this zone* 

Althou^ no chemical analyses were made a 
rough calculation from thie mineralogioal content indicates 
that the andesitic and basaltic rocks of the map-area are 
hi#i in soda* fhis indicates feat they belcmg to the 
spilitic kindredj which accardlng to Tyrrell C1941|r p*150)y 
fora the characteristic lams of geosynclinal deposition* 
However, Turner (1^48 p*124) in a ciM^lete review of the 
subject concludes that the hi^ soda content of spilltes 
is not due to the original character of the magim* He 
presents evidence to show feat development of albite in 
spilites is oasontially a metasc^iatlc process Involving 
addition of mgO and SiO^ wife ccmplementarj removal of 
CaO and AlgOg* 

In discussing the cause of metamorphi^ of fee 
rooks of the Cameron River volcanic belt, att^tlon 
feould be drawn to fee fact that fee granodiorit© Intru- 
siema shorn tm the map-area (plate II) represent only 
the contact zone of a huge batholithlc mass to the east** 
As shown on plate V, the Isograd curves are roughly 
parallel to fee outer limit of the granodiorit® intrusions* 
Because of this, the metamari^ism is attributed chiefly 
to heat and emanations derived fre^ fee granodlorite magma*

Purthef aubstantlation of this hypothesis may be derived 
tram an inspection of the chemical analysis of a sample 
of granodiorite (fig* 2)* fhis analysis indicates a 
relatively high soda content (4*48^ HagO) as ccmpared 
to norml granodiorites {5*29^ lagO)* If it is assiamed 
that emimtions were given off from this magma, then it 
should not be surprising to find that they were of a 
sodic nature, ttls accounts for the spilitic character 
of the rocks of the volcanic belt and agrees with Turner’s 
concept of spilite for^tion. 

A thin section (1 8 ) of rhyolite exhibits the 
characteristic metamorphism of rocks of acid composition. 
Although primary orthoclase has not completely broken 
down to aericite, the metamorphic grade probably corres¬ 
ponds to the biotite sane of politic sediments, for the 
rock contains over 20^ biotite*

Granodiorite (4), thin section E 1, 
crossed nicols, X 60» 


TiiO rock is a sodaclase-granodiorite 
composed chiefly of sodaclase (clouded^ In part 
showing multiple albite twinning) and quartz 
(clear) with minor biotite (dark). The slide 
exhibits mortar structure. 


As above, different part of thin 
section* The slide shows a large bent crystal 
of sodaclase with multiple albite twinning and 
aggregates of quartz crystals showing sutured 
contacts.

Granodl.orlt0^or£h2i:*2L L^l * ^ rock 

occurs in the extreme northern part of the map-area♦ It 
is not shown on plate II* The dyke is about fifteen feet 
wide and outcrops intermittently for a distance of several 
hundred feet* It strikes almost due west and the dip is 
steep to vertical* 

The rook is uniformly massive and weathers light 
pinkish-grey* Phenoerysts, about one millimeter in sis©, 
occtir in a fine grained groundmass* Tlie porphyrltic 
texture however, is not particularly evident in the hand 
specimen* 

In thin section, the mineral constituents are 
chiefly sodaclase and quarts with minor amounts of 
potash feldspar, sericite and biotite in decreasing order 
of abundance* The phenocryats are aodaclaae and cc^rise 
ten porsent of the rook* 

Museovi,te-bi£t^t 0 ^aMte - nearest granite of 

this type outcrops about four miles southeast of the map- 
area (plate I), and is mentioned only becaua© of its 
possible significance to eoonaiic geology and metamorphism. 

According to Henderson, t;he granite is a 

medium to rather fine grained^ pink weathering rock com¬ 
posed of quartz, mlcrocline, orthoclase, oligoclase, 
biotite and muscovite. Pykes and irregular offshoots of 
this granite cut the older granodiorite.

Since two granites are present» the younger is 
probably ProterEoic^ the older Archean (Henderson 1948 
p*48). 

In the following discussion^ the term granite 
includes all types of granitic rocks including granodior- 
its* 

fher© are two schools of thought regarding the 
origin of granite* One, the magmatic, maintains that 
granite magmas became primarily molten at great depths 
within the earth, and rose to their present positions by 
pushing aside or stoplng away the country rocksj and 
that vapoiH*s trcm this cooling magma have caused the 
alterations in the neighboring rocks that are grouped 
collectively under the name **granitl:sation^. 

The other school has come, by a succession of 
evolutionary steps, to the present view that granite 
bodies have originated essentially in their present 
positions, by the action of emanations** on the original 
country rocksi and that only under somewhat unusual and 
special circumstances have small - relatively smll 
parts of these granitised masses becoeie fluid, able to 
act like intrusive magm*

With reference to the laagsjatic theory, it is a 
well known fact that enormous volumes of batholithic 
rocks are c^sonly found only in motmtainous or orogenic 
areas* These batholiths are believed to have fox^med at 
a hi^er level than basic volcanic rocks; possibly the 
orogeny push&d down a portion of sial into hotter senes. 
Upward penetration of magma took place slowly, through¬ 
out wide zones, and was accompanied by a wave of 
granitization and migmatization of the country rocks. 

fhe process of granitization is considered to 
have proceeded as follows: emanationa consisting mainly 
of Ca and Ma ions arise frm a deep source into pre-exist¬ 
ing sedimentary, volcanic, or Intrusive rocks. These 
leans enter into co^lnation with the silica and other 
elements already present, forming feldspar and the other 
constituents of granite, and drive out all ions in excess 
of the amounts needed fc^ forming granite* ^is expulsion 
is Just as essential a part of granltization as the intro¬ 
duction of mterials. There is little or no change in 
volume during granitination, hence for every volume 
introduced another siust be driven out. 

The entering ions of lime and soda thus sweep 
ahead of them all ions not needed to form granite; In 
the main, these will be basic ions, such as iron and 
magnesia* These, therefore, travel ahead of the centre 
of granitization, for distances corresponding to their 
size and mobility* Becoming fixed in their turn, they

will formt at a greater or smaller distance from the 
centre, a zone of rocks more basic than the pre-existing 
country rocks* If these happened to have been basic 
types like andesites or basalts, the basified aureole 
may become very prominent, and Include types as basic as 
peridotite or horablendite* A particular characteristic 
of rocks thus basified is their high content of titanium, 
phosphorous, or manganese, making them unusually rich in 
titanlte, rutile, and apatite (Cooke, 1948 pp#54»36}* 

Althcmgh the author does not deny the possibili^ 
ty of granitization under certain circumstances, there 
Is no evidence of this process within the map-area* 
Contrary to the granitization hypothesis, there are 
indications of a sodic aureole around the granitic smas 
east of Cameron Biver, rather than a basified zone* 
Besides, there is no unusual concentration of titanite, 
rutile or apatite in metamox^phosed rocks* 

Metamorphism of the rocks of th# Cameron Eiver 
volcanic belt must necessarily have bean acco^llshed 
only by a tremendous amount of heat* If, as Uxo granlti- 
zation theorists claim, the large granite batholith east 
of the snap-area was never in a magmatic state, it is 
difficult to conceive how such a large volume of volcanic 
rock was raised to the hornblende grade of metamorphism. 
Ta& above discussion indicates that the granitizatlon 
hypotiiesis is not applicable in this instance.

On the other hand, there are no serious object¬ 
ions to the magiaatic theory of origin for the granodiorite 
bathollth east of the map-area* The steeply dipping 
volcanic rocks southeast of Gordon hake indicate that 
this area was part of an orogenic belt. Ihe orogeny was 
responsible fee:* folding down a huge synclinorum which 
extends many mile a to the west of the map-area, (plate I)# 
Volcanic rocks, forming the basal section of the strati¬ 
graphic column, outcrop along the eastern margin of the 
synclinorum. 

Within the map-area, there is undisputed 
evidence of intrusion in the form of dykes* Mag^ 

was injected into fissui^es and the irregular form of 
these intrusives is attributed to minor folding of both 
the dykes and host rock they ware still in a 

plastic state*

strike in a northwesterly direction. 

Under the microscope, the dykes appear to be 
of two distinct types, A thin section of diabase from 
the southwest part of the map-aroa shows the chief mineral 
constituents to be labradorite and audits with minor 
magnetite and some olivene, Hie chief minerals of the 
dyke rock frc^ the northern part of the map-area are 
andesine, augite and a minor amount of magnetite without 
olivene. Both rooks however, exhibit similar ophltlc 
textures* 

^smlt_Por£h 2 rjr only intrusive of this 

type was found abcmt one hundred feet north of the large 
bay on tlie east shore of lurphy Lake* It is actually 
only a minor ocourrenae but it attracted the authors 
attention because of its unusual appearance, Hi© width 
and exposed length of the dyke are approximately three 
feet and two hundred feet respectively, Ihe Intrusive 
strikes in a westerly direction and dips at a low angle 
to the north* 

In appearance, rock is massive and fine 
grained and weathers brownish-grey* Microscopically, 
it consists of andeslne 46^, augite 35^, magnetite 1^ 
and olivene 1^* Because the constituent minerals are 
relatively unaltered, the rook is classed with the late 
basic intrusives, Hie texture of the rock is porphyritic

with augite phenocrysts occurring in a fine grained 
intergrowth of andesine and magnetite. The rock con¬ 
tains small scattered amygdules consisting of aggregates 
of carbonate and quartz. Because of the high magnetite 
content and the amydaloidal structure, this rock is an 
unusual type of dyke rock.

formations in Canada may be arranged as follows from

events. Although the intrusive relationship between the 
two types of dykes is not known, their relative altera¬

of the mp-area is the older (djke not shown on plate II). 
This dyke is mad© up largely of andesine (Abg^) and augite 
and contains no olivene {thin section B 26). The arKiesine 
is considerably saussuritiaed* From its composition, this 
rock corresponds to group (S) of Moore(s classification, 
{quart^**diabase, norite, and diorite). 

In comparison, the other diabase dyke which 
outcrops in the southwest part of the map-area (also not 
shovm on plat© II) is relati¥ely tmaltered and appears 
much younger* ^Is dyke consists chiefly of labradorlte 
Ab^ and augit© and carries a small amount of olivene 
(thin section 1 25). This dyke corresponds to group (6) 
of Mooreclassification CollTene-diabase)* 

It Is not Idle intention of the author to correlate 
the ages of the diabase dykes with Moore*a table. It does 
seem Interesting howOTor, that on the Canadian Shield, the 
younger diabase is generally more basic than the older. 
Insofar as this thesis is eoncerned, the age^ of Uie 
diabase in the map-area is considered simply as Proterosoic 
as shown on Henderson*© mmp, Gordon bake South (plate I). 

With regard to the origin of the late diabase 
dykes, their widespread occurrence in the Horthwest 
Territories and elsa^x&re on the Canadian Shield, suggests 
that they were not formed in extension joints due to 
orogenic compression. Ihere are coE^3arativ©ly few places 
on the Canadian Shield where there is evidence of orogenic

these dykes is attributed to tensional fractures which 
extended down to the simatia layer of the earth*s crust* 
This probably resulted in ^eat lava flows of the plateau 
basalt type spreading over areas of the Canadian Shield* 
Such lava flows> if they did form in this manner, liave 
largely been stripped from the shield except in local 
areas iSiere orogenic folding (or down faulting) has

V APPENDIX A 


PETROGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION OF THIN SECTIONS 


Colors of hand specimens were determined by 
comparison with a rock color chart based on the Munsell 
system of color identification* This type of chart is 
distributed by the National Research Council, Washington, 
D.C* The Mimsell numerical designations are given for 
both the fi’esh and weathered rock surfaces. 

The composition of tPie feldspars was deter¬ 
mined by immersion in an oil of known refractive index. 

A standard set of lEimersion oils was made up of various 
proportions of medium-government oil and halowax oil. 

The set consisted of thirteen oil mixtures with index 
intervals of 0.005, covering the complete range of the 
feldspars from 1.520 to 1.580. The index of the oil 
mixtures was determined with an abbey refractpmeter 
using sodium vapour light. The work was carried out at a 
room temperature of 24®C t 1^. Determination of the com¬ 
position of th© plagioclase feldspar by this method is 
estimated to have a maximum possible error of ± 2$ alDite. 








-65- 


In classifying the metamorphic rocks, the 
terminology is based on that used by A. Marker. In the 
case of igneous rocks, reference was made to the 
terminology used by both P. Grout and A. Johannsen.

DESCRIPTIVE NOTES 

Most of the volcanic rocks (1) are older than the sedimentary 
formations (3, 4). They are greenstones similar to the pillowed 
lavas and associated pyroclastic rocks found in other parts of 
the region. Their contact with the granodiorite and quartz 
diorite is marked in places by a zone of greenstone (la) cut by 
numerous dykes related to the intrusive mass and ranging from 
granodiorite to quartz diorite. 

The division of the sedimentary rocks into relatively unaltered 
strata (3) and knotted quartz-mica schists and hornfels (4) is 
based on degree of metamorphism; a complete gradation exists 
between them. The greywacke, slate, impure arkose and quartz¬ 
ite are interbedded with one another and vary in proportions in 
different parts of the map-area. A narrow band of conglomerate 
occurs at the base of the sediments 3 miles south of the area 
east of the south end of Ross Lake. The conglomerate is appar¬ 
ently structurally conformable with the underlying volcanic 
rocks but may represent an erosion interval. Within the map- 
area no conglomerate was observed and sedimentary beds are 
intercalated with upper members of the volcanic assemblage 
and are succeeded by the main body of sedimentary strata 
without evidence of any erosional interval. 

Alteration of the sedimentary rocks is marked by the develop¬ 
ment of mica flakes along cleavage planes, as a result of which 
the rocks split along glistening micaceous surfaces. The more 
massive strata do not cleave readily and form quartz-mica 
hornfels. Both mica schists and hornfels are characterized by 
abundant spherical or ovoid knots that represent stages in the 
formation of new minerals. The knots may be 2 or more inches 
long but average to '/j inch. They are usually more resistant 
to erosion than the enclosing rock and stand out conspicuously 
on the weathered surface but in some beds they weather away 
to give the rock a pitted appearance. The knots vary from an 
early stage of indefinite shadowy aggregation to an advanced 
stage in which they appear as well defined crystals of cordierite 
and chiastolite. These metamorphosed rocks retain much of 
their original sedimentary structure. Bedding is perfectly pre¬ 
served and a gradation in grain size can be recognized in many 
beds. 

Throughout the map-area the sediments lie in a series of 
steeply dipping, closely spaced, isoclinal folds that in many 
places are overturned. Synclinal and anticlinal axes were locat¬ 
ed by determining the tops of beds, chiefly by observing the 
change in grain size from coarse at the bottom to fine at the top 
of a bed, Line.s on the man .showinn the trenri.s of hedrlinn were 
sketched from aerial photographs. The extremely close folding 
within the basin of Gordon Lake is due in part to the less com¬ 
petent, argillaceous character of the beds as compared with the 
more massive, sandy strata to the east and west where the folds 
are more widelyspaced. Near the southern boundaryof the map- 
area, close to their contact with the volcanic rocks north of 
Dome Lake, the beds are intensely contorted and drag-folded; 
elsewhere the fold axes are more nearly parallel over large 
areas. The folds plunge at steep angles and the direction of 
plunge reverses within short distances along many of the fold 
axes. The volcanic rocks also dip at steep to vertical angles and

hornfels. Both mica schists and hornfels are characterized by 
abundant spherical or ovoid knots that represent stages in the 
formation of new minerals. The knots may be 2 or more inches 
long but average Vi to Vi inch. They are usually more resistant 
to erosion than the enclosing rock and stand out conspicuously 
on the weathered surface but in some beds they weather away 
to give the rock a pitted appearance. The knots vary from an 
early stage of indefinite shadowy aggregation to an advanced 
stage in which they appear as well defined crystals of cordierite 
and chiastolite. These metamorphosed rocks retain much of 
their original sedimentary structure. Bedding is perfectly pre¬ 
served and a gradation in grain size can be recognized in many 
beds. 

Throughout the map-area the sediments lie in a series of 
steeply dipping, closely spaced, isoclinal folds that in many 
places are overturned. Synclinal and anticlinal axes were locat-

change in grain size from coarse at the bottom to fine at the top 
of a bed. Lines on the map showing the trends of bedding were 
sketched from aerial photographs. The extremely close folding 
within the basin of Gordon Lake is due in part to the less com¬ 
petent, argillaceous character of the beds as compared with the 
more massive, sandy strata to the east and west where the folds 
are more widelyspaced. Near the southern boundary of the map- 
area, close to their contact with the volcanic rocks north of 
Dome Lake, the beds are intensely contorted and drag-folded; 
elsewhere the fold axes are more nearly parallel over large 
areas. The folds plunge at steep angles and the direction of 
plunge reverses within short distances along many of the fold 
axes. The volcanic rocks also dip at steep to vertical angles and 
observations indicate that the flows all face west to northwest, 
Two well-defined sets of steeply dipping faults are recognizable, 
one striking about north 20 degrees west and the other about 
north 60 degrees east. Two sets of basic dykes occur parallel 
to the faults. 

The granodiorite, quartz diorite and allied intrusive rocks (5) 
comprise a heterogeneous assemblage that varies in appear¬ 
ance and composition from place to place. They weather pink 
to grey and are composed of quartz, oligoclase, biotite or horn¬ 
blende and some microcline. The quartz grains have a sugary, 
granulated appearance and the biotite flakes are broken. Large 
areas of granodiorite and quartz diorite contain abundant inclu¬ 
sions of hornblende-biotite gneiss and schist (5a). The inclu¬ 
sions vary from angular fragments to streaky, schlieren-like 
masses. Locally they make up as much as 50 per cent of an 
outcrop area. 

Hundreds of hornblende gabbro dykes cut the granodiorite, 
quartz diorite and adjoining volcanic rocks between Ross and 
Paterson Lakes. The dykes range from less than a foot to more 
than 150 feet wide and strike in general about south 20 degrees 
west. They are dark green to black, medium to rather fine¬ 
grained rocks, composed of hornblende and labradorite. Some 
of the dykes carry scattered phenocrysts of white-weathering 
feldspar up to one and even two inches long. 

The granite (6) is a medium to rather fine-grained, pink¬ 
weathering rock composed of quartz, microcline, orthoclase, 
oligoclase and biotite. Dykes and irregular offshoots of this 
granite cut the other granitic intrusives (5) and the hornblende 
gabbro dykes. 

The basic dykes weather red-brown and are composed of 
about equal amounts of pyroxene and plagioclase. 

Many quartz veins occur in the sedimentary and volcanic 
rocks. In the sedimentary rocks veins have been observed along 
the axial parts of isoclinal folds; along faulted drag folds and 
sheared slaty beds between those of more massive strata; and 
following bedding planes. Several veins have been found to 
carry gold but no deposits of commercial size and grade have 
yet been developed. The gold-bearing veins are sparsely min¬ 
eralized with one or more of several sulphides including pyrite, 
pyrrhotite, arsenopyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite and galena.
