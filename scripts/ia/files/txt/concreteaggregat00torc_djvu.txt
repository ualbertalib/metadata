PREFACE 


The quality of any concrete mix is fundamentally based on 
the quality of the materials which constitute the mix. Thus, assuming 
proper design and curing procedures are followed, the physical pro¬ 
perties which are to be desired in a concrete mix, such as strength 
and durability, depend on the physical properties of the cement, sand, 
and gravel which are used to make the mix* 

In most cases several different sources of sand and gravel 
exist in any one general area. Each source or pit may give aggregates 
of varying size and of varying physical properties. The problem arises, 
then, which aggregate is best suited to make good concrete. 

This decision is not a simple one to make. If there are 
several different sources of sand and several of gravel each type must 
be put through all of the standard American Society for Testing 
Materials tests first, individually, to determine their separate physi¬ 
cal properties and then, in concrete mixes, using different combinations 
of sand and rock* Only after a very comprehensive series of tests on 
the various mixes can a reliable judgment be made as to which aggregate 
is most suitable for different job conditions. 

In the investigation to be reported in this paper an evalua¬ 
tion of the different aggregates available in the Calgary and Edmonton 
areas is presented. This evaluation is presented on the basis of 
various sand and rock studies. The sand studies were made using one 
particular rock for every mix design, and the rock studies were made 
using one particular sand. In every case mixes were tested for com¬ 
pressive strength, for flexural strength, and for durability.

It should here be emphasized that the problem of properly 
evaluating an aggregate of necessity covers such a wide scope that, 
only by repeated testing, can a final general conclusion be made. In 
the following work as many tests were run as could possibly be done 
in the time allowed. Though they serve as a very sound basis for 
making decisions it is felt that many more tests would be of con¬ 
siderable advantage to check and to confirm any doubtful data. 

A second phase of this paper is an investigation of surface 
scaling in concrete due to CaCl^ which is frequently used to remove 

ice from pavements. Some work was done on this project last year in 

( 1 ) 

connection with air-entrainment studies , but since the results were 

( 2 ) 

not as favorable as those reported by Portland Cement Association , 
a further series of tests were carried out to investigate the effect 
of increased cement content and type of surface finish, as well as 
entrained air, on the resistance of concrete to CaC^ scaling.

The modulus of elasticity of concrete beams can be determined 
by a dynamic method. This method requires the measurement of the 
natural or resonant frequency of prismatic bars. Having determined 


the resonant frequency, a solution of the dynamic modulus of elasticity, 
*E* may be obtained by substitution in the following equation: 


E 


Un - 2 i 1 * f 2 e 

k 2 .1* 


x T 


where, 


E = dynamic modulus of elasticity, pounds per 
square inch 

^ = mass density — slugs/inch 

1 = length of specimen—inches 

f = resonant frequency 

k - radius of gyration of the section about an 
axis perpendicular to the plane of bending 

( k = for rectangular cross sections) 

t = height of beam 


m = number depending on mode of vibrating beam 
and on ratio d 

L 

= 1*.73 for fundamental and small ratios of d 

L 

T = correction term depending on ratio of thick¬ 
ness to length and on Poisson’s Ratio 
s l.ii for the specimens tested 


A more detailed description of the Sonic Apparatus and the 
Accelerated Freeze-Thaw Apparatus may be found in a thesis written 
by K.R. Lauer for M.Sc. Degree at the University of Alberta, 191*8,

Apparatus 


The beam to be tested is supported on two knife edges at its 
nodal points, (0.22k of its length from each end). 

The driving circuit consists of a variable frequency audio 
oscillator and a driving unit. The oscillator is a Hewlitt Packard, 
No. 11012, calibrated to read within t 2% of the true frequency over 
its range of use, (5#0 to 6000 cycles). The oscillator is coupled 
through a transformer to an 8-inch, magnet-type loudspeaker, a rod 
being cemented to the voice coil of the speaker for transmitting the 
vibration to the specimen. 

The pickup circuit consists of a pickup unit, an amplifier, 
and a meter. The pickup unit is an electro-magnetic type which 
generates a voltage proportional to the amplitude or velocity of 
vibration of the test specimen. 

Testing Procedure 

The specimen is supported at the nodal points. The driver 
is then brought into contact with the beam. The pickup is held in 
place at one end of the beam by a strong rubber band. The frequency 
of the oscillator is then varied until the amplitude of vibration of 
the specimen reaches a maximum as shown by the meter. The reading on 
the frequency dial is then recorded as the resonant frequency of the 
beam under test.

B. AUTOMATIC ACCELERATED FREEZING AND THAWING APPARATUS FOR CONCRETE 


The apparatus consists essentially of three tanks: 

1. A specimen tank 

2. A cold tank and refrigeration unit 

3. A thaw tank and heating unit 

1. Specimen Tank 

The inside dimensions of this tank are 27 inches long by 
21 inches wide by 21 inches deep. It is designed to hold k racks 
each of which is capable of holding 3 specimens, making a total of 
12 specimens in the tank at one time. Solutions are pumped into the 
specimen tank through two perforated pipes each running the length of 
the tank. One is for the incoming, cold solution and the other is 
for the thaw solution. There is a lj"-diameter drain pipe in the 
bottom of the specimen tank, and also an overflow pipe which is a 
lj-"-diameter pipe with the upper half removed. This defines the upper 
level of the flowing solution, 

2. Cold Tank and Refrigeration Unit 

The inside dimensions of this tank are 1*8 inches long by 
2k inches wide by 2h inches deep. It is insulated with k inches of 
cork. Four refrigeration plates in units of two are supported 6 inches 
above the bottom of the tank. The refrigeration is performed by a 
2 horse power, 220 volt, 60-cycle, 3-phase, water-cooled condensing 
unit using Freon F-12 as the refrigerant. This unit which has a capa¬ 
city of 10,000 BTU/hour, has a thermostat control set at - 20°F. It is 
adequate equipment for the 75 gallons of fluid which the tank contains. 
3* Thaw Tank and Heating Unit 


This is a circular tank, 2k inches in diameter by 1*5 inches

Concrete Mixers 

Two mixers are available in the concrete laboratory. 

The old laboratory mixer is a 0.5 cubic ft., tilting drum 
type mixer. It was designed and built at the University of Alberta 
as a scale model of the type of mixer used in the construction of the 
Grand Coulee Dam in Colorado. The mixer is powered by a 1/3 horse 
power electric motor and is operated at a speed of 20 revolutions 
per minute. A mixing time of five minutes was used with this mixer. 

The new laboratory mixer is a l| cubic ft., Lancaster 
Mixer, Type SKG, Serial No.303, manufactured by Volta Manufacturing 
Company, Ltd., "Welland, Ontario. It is powered by a 3 horse power 
Wagner Electric Motor and is operated at a speed of 20 revolutions 
per minute. This mixer is designed for laboratory work having an 
open, circular, removable type of drum in which the concrete is mixed. 
Vertical mixing blades rotate in an opposite direction to the drum 
and can be raised vertically to allow removal of the drum. 

Testing Machine 

The load testing machine which was used for measuring com¬ 
pressive strengths of cylinders jand flexural strengths of beams is a 
Baldwin Southwark Tate-Mery Testing Machine. It is a hydraulic, 
reaction-type load testing machine having a maximum capacity of 200,000 
pounds. The machine has a pneumatic load indicator and also a load- 
pacer which enables the adjustment of the rate of loading to any desired 
number of pounds per second. The load indicator has three scales: 

0 - 10,000 lbs. Low Scale 

0 - 50,000 lbs. Medium Scale 

0 - 200,000 lbs. High Scale 

This allows for the choice of whichever scale is required to give the 
maximum deflection of the needle thus enabling greater accuracy in reading.

PART II 

AGGREGATE INVESTIGATION 
INTRODUCTION — (SYNOPSIS) 

The purpose of this investigation was to analyze, in as 
comprehensive a manner as possible, the physical properties of several 
different types of sands and gravels obtained from the Edmonton and 
Calgary areas, 

( 1 ) 

The first step was to perform the standard A.S.T.M. Aggregate 
Tests. Each material was thoroughly investigated following the pro¬ 
cedures outlined in the booklet, ’A.S.T.M. Standards on Mineral Aggre¬ 
gates, Concrete, and Nonbituminous Highway Materials’, published by 
A.S.T.M. in September, 19U8. 

The next step was to investigate actual concrete mixes using 

the aggregates to be tested. At this point the problem arose of how 

to proportion the mix so that the aggregate tested would be given the 

best possible opportunity to show its optimum physical properties. 

( 2 ) 

Because recent publications have advocated the ’Fineness Modulus’ 
method of proportioning mixes in favor of the standard American Concrete 
Institute method of mix design^, an investigation was carried out to 
see whether this ’Fineness Modulus’ method of design gave better test 
results. 

On the basis of the above investigation a series of Sand 
Evaluation Tests were carried out in which a particular gravel was used

with all of the different types of sands, followed by a series of 
Rock Evaluation Tests in which a particular sand was used with all 
of the different types of rock to be tested. 

Aggregates were evaluated on the basis of compressive 
strength tests, flexural tests and durability in the automatic 
accelerated freeze-thaw apparatus.

A. CEMENT TESTS 


The cement used for all the testing was Standard Exshaw 
Portland Cement. In order to eliminate as much as possible the 
chance that any strength variations might be due to variations in 
the physical properties of the cement from bag to bag, a sufficient 
number of bags were opened and thoroughly mixed together to get a 
uniform total batch of cement. This batch was stored in a tight 
container and used for every mix. 

A chemical analysis was made of a sample of the mixed 
batch of cement.

CHAPTER II 


FINENESS MODULUS INVESTIGATION 

Summary of Kennedy^^ Report 

This report advocates the principle of proportioning the 
amounts of fine and coarse aggregate on the basis of an ‘Optimum 
Fineness Modulus 4 . The single index, known as ‘Fineness Modulus’, 
was originally conceived by Duff Abrams. It is computed from the 
standard sieve test simply by adding the cumulative percentages 
retained on every sieve up to, and including, the #100 sieve. For 
any particular type of sand and gravel combination there exists an 
Optimum F.M. This Optimum F.M. is taken from a series of tests run 
on the aggregate where, by varying the amounts of sand and rock, 
the combined F.M. of the mix is varied. Strength tests are plotted 
versus F.M. to give a curve of this type: 



From this series of curves the Optimum F.M. is taken.

and all future designs using that particular aggregate are based on 
combining sand and rock so as to get a combined F.M. equal to the 
optimum value. 

The combined F.M. of a mix is found by the following 


formula: 


where 


F.M. 

= P a M a + (100 - 

P a> «b 


100 


F.M. 

- Combined F.M. of 

sand and rock 

Pa 

= % rock in mix 


M a 

- F.M. of rock 



= F.M. of sand 



For the purposes of investigating the physical properties 
of different aggregates it was felt that, in order to get a fair 
comparison, each aggregate investigated must be given every opportunity 
to show its maximum potential desirable qualities. 

In the case of designing the mix proportions for making 
comparative concrete, it was necessary, then, to take cognizance of 
the Kennedy Report. For if a design based on F.M. would give maxi¬ 
mum compressive strengths, then that design should be the one used 
for our series of tests. 


General Outline of 'Fineness Modulus Design } Investigation 

Two sands were used in this investigation—Doncaster Washed 
Sand and Elk Island Sand. Each sand was combined with O.K. Construc¬ 
tion Company rock in varying quantities such that the combined Fine¬ 
ness Modulus of the sand and rock would range from lu8 to 5.8 in 
jumps of 0.2. This gave a series of mixes ranging from a very harsh, 
undersanded mix to a very fat, oversanded mix.

Two different cement factors were used for each mix: 

a) Cement to aggregate ratio of 1*8 

b) Cement to aggregate ratio of 1*5 

A constant slump of U” was to be maintained for every mix. 
For each different mix a total of four cylinders were poured, 
one to be broken at 7 days, and three at 28 days, and two beams 
for accelerated freeze-thaw tests at 28 days. 

The total number of different mixes poured was twenty-four. 
Twelve of those used Doncaster Washed Sand and twelve used Elk Island 
Sand. 


Sample Calculation of Mix Proportioning for F.M. Tests 


For F.M. = U.8 using 

O.K. Construction Rock (F.M. = 7.13) 

Elk Island Sand (F.M. » 3.^8) 

For a 1*8 mix, that is, 1 part cement to 8 parts aggregate 
P a M a + (100 - P a ) Mt, 


100 


= F.M. = u.8 


where: 

P a = % Sand 

M a = F.M. of Sand = 3.U8 
Mh = F.M. of Rock = 7.13 


therefore, 

P a x 3.U8 + (100 - p a ) x 7.13 = U.80 x 100 


Pa 


7.13 - U.80 _ 

3.65 


from the above we find that: 

% Sand = 63.9% 

% Rock = 36.156 


63.9

therefore the proportions are: 


Cement = 1 

Sand = 8 x .639 = 5.12 

Rock = 8x .361 = 2.88 

1:5.12:2.88:water to slump 

Similarly, mix proportions were designed for: 

F.M. = 5.0, 5.2, 5.1i, and 5.6 

Method of Fabrication and Testing Procedure 

Sufficient sand and gravel was taken from the storage bins 
each day for that particular day f s work. A close and regular check 
was kept on the moisture contents of all different aggregates. 

The rock was sieved down into three sizes— 1 "—3/I4., 
3/U”-3/8”, and 3/81/U ,f • It was then recombined in definite 
quantities of each sieve size so that a uniform rock of constant 
F.M. was assured in each mix. The cement used was Standard Exshaw 
Portland Cement. 

The mixes were mixed in the Lancaster Laboratory Mixer. 

All the dry aggregates were put in the machine and mixed together 
first. As they were mixing water was added until a slump of 
was obtained. A slump test was run on each mix to be sure that the 
specified U n slump was obtained. 

From each mix the following were fabricated: 

h — 6” Diameter x 12” High Qylinders 
2 ’ 3 2 " x Uj” x 16” Freeze-Thaw Beams 

The cylinders were made in the standard fashion, namely, 

3 layers, each layer being tamped 25 times with a 5/8” rod. 

The beams were made in two layers, each layer tamped 25 
times. The sides were then spaded with a steel trowel to insure

smooth surfaces. 

Both beams and cylinders were allowed to cure in the mois¬ 
ture room for 2h hours, after which they were stripped of the forms 
and stored in water until the time for testing arrived. 

One cylinder was broken in compression at 7 days after 
pouring, while the other three cylinders were tested at 28 days 
after pouring. 

Both beams were put in the freeze-thaw machine after 28 
days of curing. Sonic readings were taken on these beams at regular 
intervals to record the history of their breakdown of Modulus of 
Elasticity.

Instead, of plotting Compressive Strength versus Fineness 
Modulus on a single graph, it was decided that a more complete analysis 
could be made by plotting both Compressive Strength and Water Cement 
Ratio versus Fineness Modulus on the same graph, (Figs, 10 and 11 )• 

In this way the resulting effect on compressive strength as well as 
the change in W/C ratio for varying F.M. could be examined simul¬ 
taneously. 

For the Doncaster Washed Sand for both the 1*5 and the 1*8 
mixes we find that as the F.M. increases the compressive strength 
also increases. Even for high values of F.M. which indicate coarse 
mixes the compressive strength values increase. This is explained 
by noting that the respective W/G ratios show a corresponding 
decrease. 

In the case of Elk Island Sand the Fineness Modulus graphs, 
(Fig.11), show the same general characteristics, that is, the com¬ 
pressive strength curves follow according to the W/C ratio curve 
and do not show much variation due to decreasing F.M. The only 
exception to this is the curve for 1*5 mix where the compressive 
strength curve does indicate a decrease at higher values of F.M., 
even though the W/C ratio curve keeps decreasing. 

In Figs. 3 and k the Compressive Strength versus Water 
Cement Ratio curves are drawn for both sands. Even though the points 
include the complete scatter of F.M. from U.6 to 5»6, they show 
a very nice curve such as is commonly found for ordinary variations 
of Water Cement Ratio. 

From the foregoing curves it would seem that the values of 
compressive strengths indicate a very normal variation consistent 
with the variation in W/C ratios. The effect of the changing F.M,

seems very small, if at all evident. 

The durability curves, (Figs.12 and 13, are very interesting. 
The most striking point is the difference in durability between the 
1*8 mixes and the 1 : 5> mixes. An increase in cement content makes 
for a very large increase in durability. In fact, from a hi bag/yd. 
mix, (1 part cement to 8 parts aggregate), to a 7 bag/yd. mix, (1 part 
cement to 5 parts aggregate), we have an increase in durability factor 
at 200 cycles of more than a thousand percent. 

Another interesting point is that, in general, the Doncaster 
Washed Sand seemed to show better durability than the Elk Island 
Sand. This comparison is discussed in detail in the Sand Comparison 
Tests. 

As far as the effect of F.M. variation on durability is 
concerned there do not seem to be any definite conclusions from the 
graphs. The variations in F.M. are all mixed up in the group of 
curves and definitely do not show any tendency for increase or decrease 
in durability due to increasing F.M. Once again, this would indi¬ 
cate very little effect on durability caused by variations in F.M.

Summary and Conclusions 


a. Summary—Two different sands were used to test the Fineness 
Modulus Method of design. These were Doncaster Washed and Elk Island 
Sands. Tests were made using two different cement factors, (1 : 8 and 
1*5), for each sand and for overall Fineness Modulus varying from a 
very oversanded, rich mix, to a very undersanded, harsh mix. Every 
mix was tested for Compressive Strength and Durability in the 
accelerated freeze-thaw apparatus. 

b. Conclusions 

1. For lower values of F.M., (oversanded mix), a larger 
amount of water was required to maintain a constant slump of U n 9 
whereas for higher values of F.M., (undersanded mix), a much less 
amount was required for the same 1*" slump. 

2. Although the strengths were lower for low values of 
F.M. a plot of water cement ratio versus fineness modulus indicated 
that this decrease in strength was almost entirely due to increase 
in water cement ratio. 

3. No ! Optimum Fineness Modulus 1 was noted throughout 
the range of the tests. 

lw A decided increase in durability was noted for those 
mixes containing the larger amount of cement. An increase in cement 
from U-| bags/yd. to 7 bags/yd. caused an increase in durability 
factor from 500 to 2000 percent. 

5. The effect of variation in F.M. showed very little, 
if any, effect on the Durability Factor. In general there was a 
slight increase in durability for those mixes which were normal, 

(sand content not too high or too low), but this effect was so small

as to be of very little significance* 

6. On the basis of the above observations, it was decided 
that all the future test mixes would be designed according to the 
American Concrete Institute Standard Method of design since no 
obvious increases in physical properties were noted for the ’Opti¬ 
mum Fineness Modulus Method’ of design.

CHAPTER III 


COMPARATIVE SAND AND GRAVEL TESTS 


INTRODUCTION 

The most important tests in the evaluation of any of the 
aggregates under consideration are those in which the aggregate is 
actually used in a concrete mix. The concrete is then put through 
the standard tests, namely, Compressive Strength Test, Flexural 
Strength Test and Durability Test in the accelerated freeze-thaw 
apparatus. If the concrete is properly designed, fabricated and 
cured, and if for a series of sand tests, say, the same gravel is 
used for each different concrete mix, then any variations in the 
behavior of the concrete can be attributed to variations in the 
physical properties of the sand used in that mix. In the same 
manner a series of gravels can be tested using the same sand. 

For the mix design it was decided, on the basis of the 
’Fineness Modulus Design’ studies, (see Page 37), that since slight 
variations in fineness modulus of the sand and gravel combined had 
very little effect on those physical properties of the concrete to 
be studied, the standard A,C.I. system for design of concrete 
mixes^ would be utilized t throughout the tests as a basis for trial 
mixes.

GENERAL OUTLINE OF PROCEDURE AND TESTING 


Materials 

1. Aggregate—In order that all materials tested be in as 
uniform a condition as possible, all the sands to be tested were 
soaked with water for at least 2 days before testing, and all 
the gravel was soaked for 1 day. The samples were allowed to 
drain freely and moisture content determinations were made in every 
case Just prior to mixing. At the same time a sample of each sand 
was sealed, to have an absorption test run on it the following day. 

In this manner the amount of free moisture was determined very 
accurately. All gravel samples used were thoroughly washed over a 

# k screen to eliminate any clay and other soluble surface coatings. 

2. Cement—The cement used in every case was Standard Exshaw 
Portland Cement, the physical and chemical analysis of which is 
given on Page 17. The cement was a batch made up by thoroughly 
mixing several bags together to insure uniformity. The cement was 
stored in a tight metal drum. 

3. Water—The mixing water used was normal drinking water as 
obtained from the Edmonton City Water Supply. 

Weighings 

All weighings were made on the Laboratory Scale, to the 
nearest ounce. 

Mixing and Size of Batches 

The concrete for both the sand and the gravel tests was 

mixed in the Laboratory Tilting Drum, 1/2 cu.ft. mixer. The materials 

were added in the following order: 

1/2 Mixing Water 
Coarse Aggregate 

Fine.Aggregate and Cement (thoroughly premixed by hand) 
Remaining mixing Water

The concrete was mixed for 5 full minutes from the time 
all of the ingredients were in the mixer. 

Each mix consisted of two batches of about 80 pounds each. 
The first batch was emptied into a steel tray and then, when the 
second batch was completely mixed, it was dumped on top of the first. 
The two batches were then thoroughly intermixed by shovel. 

Slump Tests 

A slump test was taken on every mix. It was attempted to 
keep the slump as near to U n as possible. 

Specimen Fabrication 

For both the fine and the coarse aggregate evaluation tests 
the following specimens were fabricated: 

a) Cylinders— Standard 6 n diameter by 12” high compressive 
strength test cylinders poured in 3 equal lifts. Each lift was 
tamped 25 times with a 5/8” diameter rod. Three cylinders were 
poured for each mix all of which were tested at 28 days. 

b) Beams—These measured 3^ n x x l6 n . They were poured in 

two layers, each layer tamped 25 times with a 5/8” diameter tamping 
rod. The sides were spaded with a steel trowel, and the top struck 
off smooth with a wooden float. Two beams were poured for each mix. 
One beam was tested for flexural strength at 28 days, the other 

was put in the accelerated freeze-thaw apparatus at 28 days and 
dynamic modulus of elasticity values were determined at regular inter¬ 
vals with the sonic apparatus. 

Both the cylinders and beams were allowed to cure in air 
for the first 2k hours and then, with the forms stripped off, were 
cured in water at 70°F for 27 days after which they were given 
their respective tests.

TESTING PROCEDURE 


Compressive Strength Tests 

The cylinders were capped with a sulphur and fire-clay 
mixture to insure square and level surface bearing pressures* The 
cross sectional diameter of each cylinder was obtained to the nearest 
0.01 inches by averaging 2 diameters measured at right angles to 
each other near the centre of the length of the specimen. The 
cylinders were tested in a moist condition in the Baldwin Southwark 
Einery-Tate Testing Machine. The load was applied at a constant rate 
of 50 p.s.i. per second. 

Flexural Strength Tests 

The beams were tested in a moist condition. Centre-point 
loading was applied with the beam supported at each end. The clear 
span of the beam was 12 inches, centre to centre. 



The load was applied by the Baldwin Southwark Qnery-^ 
Testing Machine. The modulus of rupture was computed from the 
following formula:

The beams were first weighed in air and then in water to 
determine their volume. An initial sonic reading was taken in the 
sonic apparatus, (see Page 3 ). The beams were then put in indivi¬ 
dual sheet metal containers which, in turn, were filled with water 
and placed in the testing tank. The beam went through a cycle of 
freezing and thawing every two hours. Sonic readings were taken at 
approximately 0, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 , 100, 1?0 and 200 cycles. 

Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity of the beam decreased to less than $0% 
of the original E or when the beam had completed 200 continuous 
cycles. The values for Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity were computed 
from the relationship given on Page ' 

The history of the resulting breakdown or decrease in 
Dynamic E was plotted against the total number of cycles, A value 
for Durability Factor, (DFE), based on the Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity 
was computed for each mix using the following formula: 

DFE = 

M 

where, 

DFE = Durability Factor in percent of dynamic 
E at zero cycles.

Admixtures'—Charles E. Wuerpel, Proceedings of the American

SAND EVALUATION TESTS 


The following sands were investigated: 


Dewinton Sand 
Clarke’s Sand (Cochrane) 

A mixture of River and 


1 

2 


Dewinton 


Calgary 

Area 


Doncaster Washed Sand 
Doncaster Pit Run Sand 
Elk Island Sand 


Edmonton 

Area 


The River Sand was too coarse to use alone in a concrete 
mix so a mixture of -ir River Sand and ■§• Dewinton Sand was tested 
instead. 


Each sand was incorporated into a mix using the standard 
A.C.I. method of design. The rock which was used for all the sand 
tests was O.K. Construction rock. This rock was used because it was 
readily available and could easily be washed clean, sieved down into 
3 component-size fractions and recombined. The rock ivas recombined 
in the following amounts for each test: 


1" - 3/u« 

— 

30% 

3/it" - 3/8" 

— 

53% 

3/8" - #h 

— 

17 % 


Two different mixes were designed and run for each sand, one 
mix using £ bags of cement per yard of concrete and another mix using 
6§ bags of cement per yard of concrete. Each mix was repeated once 
making a total of 21* mixes.

Volume of Sand = 0.U5 x 19.79 = 8.9O 

Volume of Rock - 0.55 x 19*79 = 10. 89 

Weight of Sand = 8.90 x 2.61 x 62 .U = 1U50 lbs. 

Weight of Rock = 10.89 x 2.61 x 62.U = 1770 lbs. 

The quantities of materials used per cubic yard of concrete are: 

Cement = U37.5 lbs. 

Water = 310 lbs. 

Sand = 1U50 lbs. 

Rock = 1770 lbs.

RESULTS OF SAND EVALUATION TESTS 


Compressive Strength Tests 

A plot of 28 day, compressive strength versus W/C ratio 
is shown in Fig, 15 . 

Most of the points fell very nicely along the typical "W/C 
Ratio versus Compressive Strength” curve. In each case a ‘best fit* 
line was chosen from all of the points for each sand tested. 

From the curves it is seen that, for values of W/C ratio 
greater than about 0.65, concrete containing Doncaster Pit Run Sand 
shows the best compressive strengths with ELk Island Sand being only 
slightly below. In this high range of W/C ratios Clarke*s Sand is 
the poorest of all, falling very rapidly for slight increases in W/C 
ratio. 

For lower values of W/C ratio, (< 0.65), the concrete 
containing \ River and ^ Dewinton Sand drops considerably in 
compressive strength. On the other hand Clarke’s Sand picks up con¬ 
siderably and shows increasingly better compressive strength values 
for lower W/C. The Doncaster Washed Sand is, in general, much lower 
than the other sands. This is particularly strange in view of the 
fact that the Doncaster Pit Run Sand shows up very well in this plot. 
This may be explained by the fact that the Doncaster Washed Sand was 
brought into the laboratory early in the summer while the Doncaster 
Pit Run Sand was brought in late in the fall. Thus, because the 
batches were different, some variations might be expected. It has been 
past experience also, to note large variations in Doncaster Sand from 
batch to batch.

Flexural Strength Tests 

A plot of 28 day Flexural Strength versus W/C ratio is shown 
in Fig. 16 . 

Elk Island Sand shows by far the most favorable flexural 
strength, being about 15 to 20 per cent higher than any other sand. 
Doncaster Pit Run Sand is fairly high on the graph, but fails to show 
proper increases for decreasing W/C ratio. 

In this plot, as in the plot of compressive strength versus 
W/C ratio, both Clarke’s Sand and Doncaster Washed Sand show very low 
strengths for high values of W/C but pick up considerably for lower 
values of W/C. 

Both Dewinton Sand and the ^ River and Dewin ton mixture 

show medium good flexural strengths for high values of W/C, but indi¬ 
cate poor strengths for lower values. There does not seem to be much 
difference between either of these mixes. 

Durability Tests 

Two series of beams were tested in the freeze-thaw apparatus. 
The first series consisted of beams made from the different sands to be 
tested using 5 bags of cement per yard of concrete and also using 6§ 
bags. The plot of ’Percent Original Dynamic Modulus of Elasticity versus 
Number of Cycles’ for this run. No. 1, is shown in Fig. 17 . The 
whole series of mixes was repeated, (on different days), giving a 
second set of check tests. The results of run No. 2 are plotted in 
Eig. 18 . In both cases testing was continued until E had decreased 
to 50$ of the original or until 200 cycles had been run. 

The two sets of results are in fairly close agreement, with 
a few exceptions.

In run No. 1 the bag mix of Elk Island Sand shows 
much greater durability than the same mix in run No. 2. This is 
partly explained by the fact that a breakdown for several days occurred 
during testing of run No. 1, giving the beam a chance to ’recuperate’i 1 '* 

The 5 bag mixes of Doncaster Washed and Doncaster Pit Run 
Sands show much less durability in run No. 1 than in run No. 2. 

There does not seem to be any feasible explanation for this. 

With the exception of the above the results of both runs 
check fairly closely. 

The first interesting point to note is that the cement factor 
has a very decided influence on the durability. For nearly all of the 
sands tested the 6J bag mixes showed amazing increases in durability 
over the 5 bag mixes. From the values of Durability Factor, (DFE), 
shown in Table 13 it can be seen that increases of several hundred 
per cent and more occur. 

The most durable sand of those tested was Doncaster Pit Run. 
The Doncaster Washed Sand was next, having also a very high durability 
factor. Elk Island Sand which showed such exceptionally good compres¬ 
sive strength results, was not as good in durability. Except for one 
beam which stood up very well, all of the beams tested in the sand tests, 
and those tested in the Fineness Modulus Tests, showed much lower 
values of DFE than Doncaster Washed Sand. This would indicate that 
Elk Island Sand, though having excellent strength properties, does not 
show very good durability. This may be due to the thermal properties 
of the sand, (increased expansion and contraction), or it may be due 

^ If beams are allowed to rest for a lengthy time between cycles of 
freezing and thawing, they tend to regain some of their ’Modulus 
of Elasticity’. This phenomenon is called ’recuperating’.

to some other effect, such as the internal void structure of the grains. 
In many cases a low durability factor would be sufficient cause to 
reject the sand. 

All of the sands from the Calgary area show particularly 
low durability properties. Clarke's Sand is the worst in this respect, 
showing a DFE at 200 cycles of about 0.75 for 5 bag mixes and 

i 

about 1.50 for 6| bag mixes. 

The best mix of the Calgary Sands from the durability stand¬ 
point is the mixture of § River and \ Dewinton Sands. This mix, 
though showing very low durability for the 5 bag mix, indicates a 
very considerable increase for the 6J- bag mix. 

The Dewinton sand shows some increase in durability for the 
6J- bag mix, but this is very little compared to the other sands. 

A plot of Durability Factor versus 28 day Compressive 
Strength is shown in Fig.19 . This gives a very good illustration of 
the durability of all of the different sands as compared to their com¬ 
pressive strength. Once again, the order in decreasing durability of 
the different sands is seen. It is interesting to note that a very 
definite break occurs in all the curves at around 3500 p.s.i. For 
compressive strengths less than this value the durability factor drops 
very rapidly, whereas, for compressive strengths higher than this, the 
rate of increase in durability factor decreases rapidly. This bears 
out the fact that, for the sake of increased durability, it is well 
worthwhile to design mixes for a nominal strength of around 3500 p.s.i.

ROCK EVALUATION TESTS 

The following gravels were investigated: 

Alberta Transit Mix Rock — Calgary area 

O.K. Construction Rock 

Alberta Concrete Products Rock > — Edmonton area 

Bennett and White Rock J 

Each rock was incorporated into a standard A.C.I. mix 
design. Doncaster Pit Run Sand was used for each mix. 

The sand was kept pre-soaked and, for every mix at the time 
of mixing, a moisture content was run on the sand and a sample was 
also taken and sealed to have an absorption test run the following day. 
From this information the free surface moisture could be calculated 
accurately for each mix. 

Each rock was pre-soaked for 2h hours before mixing and 
allowed to drain freely for about 1 hour before mixing. A moisture 
content was run on a sample of rock just prior to mixing, and from 
the 2h hour absorption value of the rock, the amount of free moisture 
could be accurately determined. 

Two different mixes were designed and run for each rock, 
one mix using 5 bags cement per yard of concrete and the other mix 
using 6J bags. Each mix was repeated once making a total of 16 mixes. 

Table 13 shows the materials used in each mix, together with 
the slump, strengths and durability factors obtained.

RESULTS OF ROCK EVALUATION TESTS 
Compressive Strength Tests 

A plot of Compressive Strength versus W/C Ratio for all 
of the rocks tested is shown in Fig. 21 . 

The Alberta Transit Mix Rock shows the best compressive 
strength, giving a compressive strength of about 1*600 p.s.i. at 
28 days for a W/C ratio of 0.5. 

The curve for O.K. Construction Rock runs fairly close to 
the Alberta Transit Mix but is about 100 to 150 p.s.i. below it. 

The Alberta Concrete Products and the Bennett and White 
Rocks are fairly close to each other but are both about 500 p.s.i. 
below Alberta Transit Mix Rock, with the Bennett and White Rock being 
slightly below the Alberta Concrete Products Rock. 

Flexural Strength Tests 

Fig. 22 is a plot of 28 day Flexural Strength versus 

W/C Ratio. 

In this case the O.K. Construction Rock shows the highest 
curve except for lower values of W/C, (less than 0 . 5 ), where it tends 
to flatten slightly. The Alberta Transit Mix Rock is generally slightly 
below O.K. Construction Rock, being about 50-75 p.s.i. lower than 
O.K. Construction, 

Alberta Concrete Products and Bennett and White Rocks are 
once again both below O.K. Construction Rock with Bennett and White 
being the lowest for higher values of W/C ratio, (greater than 0.60), 
and Alberta Products dropping below Bennett and White for values of 
W/C ratio less than 0.60.

two beams for each different sand and for each different cement 
content, that is. Run No.l and Run No.2. 

Testing was continued until the Modulus of Elasticity had 
decreased to 50 % of the original, or until 200 cycles had been 
run. Two graphs of ’Percent of Original Dynamic Modulus of Elasti¬ 
city versus Number of Cycles’ were drawn, one for each run. These 
are shown in Figs. 23 and 2U 

The two sets of results check fairly closely in general. 

It will be noted from the two graphs that though' there is 
a considerable increase in durability from the 5 bag mix to the 6| 
bag mix, there does not exist quite so sharp an increase as did exist 
in both the Fineness Modulus Tests, (Figs. 12 and 13 ), and in the 

Sand Evaluation Tests, (Figs. 17 and 18 ). The main reason for this 
seems to be that in all cases the 5 bag mixes did not drop as rapidly 
in durability as they did in the other tests. 

We would expect this to happen since the standard sand used 
in all the mixes was Doncaster Pit Run and, from the Sand Evaluation 
Tests, we know that this sand shows considerably better characteristics 
than any of the other available sands. 

It is very interesting to note that in both sets of tests 
the 6| bag mixes of O.K. Construction Rock show the highest durability, 
whereas the 5 bag mixes of the same rock show the lowest durability. 

This seems very strange since, in nearly all the other cases, a rock— 
or a sand, for that matter—showing low durability for low cement 
content, tends to show relatively low durability for higher cement 
contents. 

The only explanation for the strange behavior of the O.K. 
Construction Rock is that this aggregate was the last to be tested.

During the testing of this aggregate difficulties were encountered in 
both the freeze-thaw apparatus and in the sonic apparatus. The 
freezing solution was not functioning properly because too much alco¬ 
hol had evaporated from it and as a result the refrigeration plates 
continually became coated with a thick layer of ice. At the same time 
the contact microphone pickup in the sonic apparatus broke down and 
a crystal pickup was used in its place. This pickup was too sensi¬ 
tive to harmonics, and consequently was not very satisfactory. 

Because of these difficulties, it is felt that the results 
of the O.K. Construction aggregate tests are not very reliable. 

As in the case of the Elk Island Sand, the Alberta Transit 
Mix Rock, which showed very favorable compressive strength and 
flexural strength characteristics, does not show such good durability 
properties. For this rock the durability factor is about % 0 % smaller 
than Alberta Concrete Products and Bennett and White Rocks for the 
5 bag mixes, and about 75-100$ smaller for the 6| bag mixes. 

The Alberta Concrete Products and Bennett and White Rocks 
seem to show about the same durability factors. Both are about 50$ 
higher than O.K. Construction Rock for 5 bag mixes, and about 50 % 
lower than O.K. Construction Rock for 6| bag mixes. 

From the plots of 'Durability Factor versus 28 day Compressive 

( 1 ) 

Strength', (Fig.25 ), and 'Durability Factor versus W/C Ratio', the 

listing of the rocks tested in order of decreasing durability factor 
is:— O.K. Construction Rock, Bennett and White, Alberta Concrete Pro¬ 
ducts, and Alberta Transit Mix. It should also be noted from these 
two graphs that a definite break in the rate of change of durability 
factor at a compressive strength of about 3000 - 3500 p.s.i., or at 
a W/C ratio of about 0,70 takes place. For lower values of compressive

strength than these the durability factor decreases very rapidly, 
whereas for higher values the rate of increase of DFE begins to slow 
down. Thus it would seem to be well worthwhile, from a durability 
standpoint, to design mixes for at least 3000 and, preferably, 

3500 p.s.i.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


Summary 

Several sands and gravels from the Calgary and Edmonton 
areas were investigated and evaluated* A complete set of preliminary 
investigations were run on each material according to the A*S.T*M. 
specifications, and then a series of mixes were designed according 
to the A*C,I. Standard Design Procedure in which each of the sand 
types was incorporated into concrete, using a particular gravel, 
followed by each of the rock types, using a particular sand. Evalua¬ 
tion was based on compressive strength tests, flexural strength tests 
and durability in freeze-thaw apparatus. 

Conclusions 

A. General 

1. Compressive strength and flexural strength tests are not 
an indication of durability. Aggregates giving very favorable compres¬ 
sive and flexural strengths may show very low durability factors. 

2. For a particular set of materials durability depends on 
the cement content. For low values of cement content the durability 
factor is very sensitive to changes in cement content. For higher values 
of cement content, (greater than about 6 bags per yard), slight changes 
in cement content do not affect the durability factor to such a great 
extent. It is therefore advisable to use a cement content such that 

the latter relationship exists. Design to a minimum strength of 3000 p.s 
will accomplish this.

best compressive and flexural strengths. Doncaster Pit Run also showed 
the best durability, but Elk Island sand dropped very sharply here, 
showing only medium durability . 

2. Doncaster Washed Sand showed comparatively low compressive 
strengths but showed considerably better durability, being slightly 
below Doncaster Pit Run Sand. 

3. The group of sands from the Calgary area showed, in general, 
poorer qualities than those from the Edmonton area. Dewinton Sand 
showed the best compressive and flexural strengths but the mixture of 

2 River and § Dewinton showed much better durability than Dewinton 
alone. 

k. Clarke f s Sand was the poorest sand of all. This sand 
showed the poorest flexural and compressive strengths, and also the 
poorest durability, having a maximum DFE even for 6J bags of cement 
per yard of about * 3». 

c. Gravel Tests 

l. Alberta Transit Mix Rock showed the best compressive 
strengths, and was only slightly low in flexural strengths. However, 
it dropped considerably in the durability tests, showing only about 
one-half the durability shown by O.K. Construction and Alberta Con¬ 
crete Products. 

2. O.K. Construction Rock showed the best durability for 
higher canent contents. This rock also showed excelledt compressive 
and flexural strengths and, in general, was the best of all of the 
rocks tested. 

3. Alberta Concrete Products Rock, though fairly low in 
compressive and flexural strengths, showed very good results in dura¬ 
bility tests. It was only slightly below O.K. Construction Rock in 
these tests.

k» Bennett and White Rock was in general the poorest of the

Its durability was very close to that of Alberta Concrete Products

PART III 

SCALING TESTS 


Introduction 

NaCl and CaCl 2 are commonly used during the winter months 
for the purpose of removing ice from city streets. The concentra¬ 
tion of CaCl^ is particularly great at street intersections and 
hills. Traffic tends to pick up the CaClg at these points and 
distribute it over a large number of side streets. Thus, the effect 
of CaClg on the scaling of concrete is widespread. Because of this 
fact numerous tests have been conducted with the object of determining 
some method of increasing the resistance of concrete slabs to surface 
scaling. 

In the general program of investigation of air-entraining 
agents there have been included several studies of the effect of 
air-entrainment on the resistance of concrete to CaClg scaling. 

Most of these tests have found that the entrainment of 3*5% air 
considerably increases the resistance of the concrete to CaCl 2 

(i&; 

scaling. In fact, tests conducted by the Portland Cement Association 
and other organizations^ have shown increases in resistance of con¬ 
crete to scaling up to several hundred per cent due to the entrainment 
of air.

However, in a series of tests run at the University of 
Alberta^ it was found that concrete slabs with entrained air ranging 
from k*5% to 7.0$ showed increases in CaC^ scaling resistance 
of barely 200$, The only difference between the two series of tests 
was that the Portland Cement Association carried out the scaling tests 
on a trowelled surface, whereas the University of Alberta carried out 
the tests on a wood-formed surface. 

As a result of this discrepancy in test results, it was felt 
that a further series of CaCO^ scaling tests were necessary to 
analyze more completely the effect of CaCl^ on different types of 
surface finishes and different cement factors, as well as entrained air

Specimens 

Each specimen consisted of a concrete slab having dimensions 
of 15” x 6" x 2”. A 1” x 1” dyke was formed around one surface 
either by building up the centre portion of the bottom of the form, 

(as in the case of Lauer’s work), giving a wood-formed surface to 
test, or by building up dykes of 1:2 mortar by weight on the top 
surface 2 hours after placing the concrete. 

The aggregate used for all slabs was Alberta Concrete Pro¬ 
ducts Gravel and Doncaster Washed Sand. Mixes consisted of the 
following designs: 


5S-N — 

Standard A.C.I. design — 5 bag per yard mix 
Slump = h n 

5s-a — 

Standard A.C.I. design — 5 bag per yard mix 
including k% air by air-entrainment 

Slump = u” 

7S-N — 

Standard A.C.I. design — 7 bag per yard mix 
Slump = A” 

7S-A — 

Standard A.C.I. design — 7 bag per yard mix 
including h% air by air-entrainment 

Slump = U” 


Ayr-trap was the air-entraining agent used in every case. 

A summary of the actual mix proportions used and other rele¬ 
vant data will be found in Fig. 

Each different mix design was tested for four different types 
of surface finishes: 

a) Wood-formed surface, (similar to Lauer*s work). 

b) Wood trowelled within 10 minutes after concrete was poured.

c) Burnished with steel trowel when surface water had evaporated 
and concrete was nearly hard, 

d) Wood trowelled within 10 minutes after concrete was poured. 
Given linseed treatment after 10 days of curing in moist room, 

A repeat run was made of each different type of slab tested 
making a total number of 32 slabs tested. 

Testing Procedure 

All test specimens were made up using the same standard 
procedure. The wooden forms were given a thin coat of vaseline to 
facilitate stripping. The forms were then filled with concrete, rodded 
25 times, and each surface was given its desired type of finish. The 
slabs were then placed in the moist room where they were left to cure 

for 2h hours, after which time they were stripped of the fonns. All 

of the (a), (b) and (c) type surfaces were left to cure in water for 

13 days, then in air for the next 1U days. They went into the 

refrigerator on the 28th day after being poured. The (d) type sur¬ 
faces were allowed to cure in the moist room for 10 days, and were 
then treated with a mixture of %0% boiled linseed oil and %0% 
turpentine at the rate of about 50 square yards per gallon, followed 
in 2h hours by an application of neat boiled linseed oil at the rate 
of about 70 square yards per gallon. These slabs were then allowed 
to cure in air until they were taken into the refrigerator on the 
28th day after they had been poured. 

Once a slab was in the refrigerator a 1/V* layer of water 
was poured on its surface and allowed to freeze overnight. After 
approximately 18 hours of freezing, 60 grams of CaCl 2 , (corres¬ 
ponding to about 3 lbs. per square yard), was sprinkled over the ice.

The slab remained in the cold room during the following 6 hours 
under the thawing action of the CaClg. During the last hour of thaw 
the slab was taken outside, washed clean of CaClg solution, and the 
surface brushed with a wire brush* 

The slab was then returned to the refrigerator, a fresh 1/U n 
layer of water was poured on the surface, and the cycle repeated* 

These cycles were repeated every day, except during Sunday, when the 
slab was allowed to remain frozen for some U2 hours. 

The calcium chloride used was of the same stock used last 
year. A chemical analysis of the lot indicated the calcium chloride 
to be of very good quality, having only 0.21# of sodium sulphate. 

A high percentage of sodium sulphate in salts used would increase the 
rate of surface scaling considerably. 

A visual examination was made of each slab after each cycle 
of freezing and thawing with calcium chloride. A code was set up to 
indicate the extent of the scaling of the surface. 

Code for Evaluating Amount of Surface Scaling 

F.S. = Fine scaling—scaling off of a fine layer of cement 
paste from the slab surface, 

L. S. = Light scaling—scaling off of a thin layer of fine 

aggregate exposing the coarser particles of fine aggre¬ 
gate as well as the coarse aggregate very near the 
surface. 

M. S. = Medium scaling—scaling off of fine aggregate, exposing 

the coarse aggregate. 

H.S. = Heavy scaling—scaling off of layers of fine aggregate 

exposing the coarse aggregate to a quarter of its thickness.

Discussion of Results 


The comparative results of the resistance to CaCl^ scaling 
shown by the different mixes and different types of surface finishes 
are best seen in Figs.2? to 30, (Graphs of slab scaling tests). 

It is interesting to note that, of the 5 bag mixes, those 
mixes containing approximately k% entrained air showed an increase 
of about 150$ to 200$ in CaC^ scaling resistance over the 
normal mixes. This is about the same result as that obtained last 
year. On the other hand an increase in the cement factor, ( 7 bags per 
cubic yard), showed as much, if not more, percentage increase in scaling 
resistance as the entrainment of k% air. In other words, a mix using 
about 7 bags per cubic yard with no entrained air showed about the 
same scaling resistance as a mix using 5 bags per cubic yard with k% 
air entrained. The greatest general resistance to CaCl 2 scaling 
was indicated by the slabs made with 7 bags per cubic yard and con¬ 
taining h% entrained air. These slabs showed about 150$ increase 
over the 7 bag normal mix and about 250-300$ increase over the 5 bag 
normal mix. 

In comparing the effects of different surface finishings it 
will be generally noted from all of the graphs that the linseed oil 
and turpentine-treated surfaces, during the early stages of the test, 
showed by far the greatest scaling resistance properties. 

However, after about 10 - 15 cycles of freezing and thawing, 
this surface showed a general tendency to break down very rapidly, in 
large layers, ending up at the end of the test showing very little, if 
any, increased resistance to scaling. 

It is the author’s opinion that the surface coating of linseed 
oil and turpentine tends to minimize the effects of the early stages

of surface breakdown but the damage, nevertheless, seems to be pro¬ 
ceeding underneath the surface layer, until it finally reaches a 
stage where the whole surface layer tends to break down very rapidly. 
As a result of such action it would seem that the extra cost of 
extensive linseed treatment would hardly be practical; instead, the 
same money would be much better spent if put into increasing the 
cement factor, or by using air-entrainment. 

Of the other three types of surface finishings tested there 
does not seem to be enough evidence from this particular series of 
tests to favor any one above any other. In general, the wood-floated 
surface, (surface b), seemed to show the most rapid signs of break¬ 
down. But it characteristically slowed down its rate of disintegra¬ 
tion at about 50 % Medium Scaling, and finally ended up exhibiting 
nearly as much scaling resistance as any other type of surface finish. 

The steel burnished surface, (surface c), showed in general 
much the same characteristics as did surface f d 1 , (linseed treated), 
that is, it seemed to withstand breakdown for some time, and then 
suddenly started to break down quite rapidly. Once again, it would 
seem that the same explanation would apply in this case as in the 
case of surface ’ d’. 

This series of tests still does not show anywhere near the 
remarkable increases in CaCO .2 scaling resistances as reported by 
the Portland Cement Association. The only variable that cannot be 
accounted for is the vigor with which the surfaces are scrubbed 
between each cycle. In this test surfaces were scrubbed with a 
2" x 6” steel brush for about 1 minute using a pressure of about 
15 lbs. That this is too severe does not seem very likely. A more 
detailed account of the handling of slabs in the Portland Cement

Association tests would perhaps reveal the reason for such variation 
in results. 

Summary 

Four different concrete mix designs were tested for resis¬ 
tance to CaCl 2 scaling. Each design was tested using a total of 
k different types of surface finishes making a total of 16 slabs. 

The whole procedure was repeated once as a check, making a total of 
32 slabs tested. 

The four different designs were as follows: 

a) E> bags of cement per yard, normal mix 

b) 5 bags of cement per yard, k% entrained air (with Ayr-trap) 

c) 7 bags of cement per yard, normal mix 

d) 7 bags of cement per yard, h% entrained air (with Ayr-trap) 

Each design was tested with the following surface finishes: 

a) Wood-formed surface 

b) Wood-floated surface 

c) Steel burnished surface 

d) Surface treated with Linseed Oil and Turpentine 

A layer of ice was allowed to freeze on the surface of each 
slab and was then thawed with CaCl 9 » These cycles were repeated every 
day with visual examination being made between each cycle. The test 
was ended when 100$ High Scaling was reached. 

Conclusions 

1. Definite increase in resistance to CaCl 2 scaling is shown 
by entraining h% air. An increase of l£0$ to 200$ was shown by 
both the f? and 7 bag per yard mixes when made with k% air.

2, The 7 bag normal mixes showed about 200$ more resistance to 
scaling than the 5 bag normal mixes. This indicates that an increase 
in cement content gives an increase in scaling resistance, 

3, Both the steel burnished and turpentine treated surfaces 
showed high resistance to scaling during the early stages of the 
test but then broke down very rapidly in the latter stages, showing 
at the end very little increase in resistance over the wood-formed 
and floated surfaces. Thus the type of surface finish did not indi¬ 
cate any great influence on the resistance of the concrete to scaling, 

iu The results of this test, though slightly better than those 
obtained in the tests conducted here last year, still do not show 
anywhere near the improvement for air-entrained mixes as reported 
by the Portland Cement Association,
