ABSTRACT 


For the study of phosphatase inactivation and cream 
volume impairment in the HTST region, the small commercial 
plate-type heat exchanger offers certain advantages over 
laboratory-size pasteurizers in that precise temperature, 
time and pressure measurements may be directly made at any 
desired point in the process. The experimental pasteurizer 
was of this type with a capacity of 1000 pounds/hour; 
temperatures were measured by indicating thermometers and 
thermocouples calibrated against an indicating thermometer 
graduated to 0.1°C. and certified by the National Research 
Council of Canada to 0.01°C.; milk times were calculated from 
water times measured by the salt-conductivity method; the 
thermal effect of heating-up and cooling was evaluated by 
Ball T s method; the Sanders and Sager phosphatase test was the 
criterion of inactivation and the cream volume was measured 
in graduated cylinders with a change of 1 percent indicating 
impairment. 

Assuming instantaneous heating-up and cooling, phosphata; 
was found to be inactivated at 160°F. in 16. S seconds and 
the Z value (the temperature range in degrees during one 
logarithmic cycle of time) of the semi-logarithmic inactiva¬ 
tion curve in the temperature range studied is 9*7°F. For

cream volume impairment only 15*0 seconds at 160°F. were 
required while the Z value of the semi-logarithmic destruction 
curve was 12.4°F. in the range studied. 

Because of the complexity of the creaming problem the 
measurement of cream volume destruction does not provide a 
satisfactory criterion of HTST pasteurization. There are 
also objections to the use of the phosphatase test as the sole 
field control of HTST pasteurization. Thus there appears 
to be justification for a specified minimum holding time of 
15 seconds at a minimum of 160°F.

FIELD CONTROL OF THE TEMPERATURE-TIME FACTOR 
IN HTST PASTEURIZATION 

INTRODUCTION 

Since the approval of the high-temperature short-time 
(usually abbreviated to HTST) method of milk pasteurization 
in Canada and the United States, the pasteurisation standard 
for this method has been one or other of three standards; 
either a minimum temperature of 160°F. for a minimum holding 
time of 15 seconds, or l6l°F. for 15 seconds, or l6l°F. for 
16 seconds- Since the fundamental purpose of milk pasteuriza¬ 
tion is to kill the pathogenic bacteria which may be suspended 
in'the milk, it then becomes evident that the heat-resistant 
characteristics of the pathogenic organisms must be known. 

It is accepted that Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most 
heat-resistant of the common milk pathogens. Thus, the 
immediate purpose of pasteurisation is to kill the tubercle 
organism and this has become the universal basis of pasteuri¬ 
zation. However, the heat-resistant characteristics of 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the region of HTST pasteuriza¬ 
tion are not definitely known. Thus, any estimation of the 
safety factor provided by HTST pasteurization is onl}?- an 
approximation and may or may not be close to that actually 
provided. 

The real practical and immediate criterion of pasteuriza¬ 
tion today is inactivation of milk phosphatase. In practice 
this test is now being used extensively to control the minimum

pasteurization temperature-time combinations. The upper limits 
of the temperature-time combinations should be below the point 
at which the creaming properties of the unhomogenized milk 
begin to be significantly affected. 

In this study it is proposed to investigate the feasibility 
of basing the field control of HTST pasteurization on the 
destruction of the milk phosphatase and the destruction of 
the creaming property of the milk when these criteria are 
applied to the finished milk. 


HISTORICAL 

Development of HTST Pasteurization 

The discoveries of Louis Pasteur that bacteria which 
cause "disease" of wine could be killed if heat is applied 
for a sufficient period of time, led to the scientific develop¬ 
ment of milk processing. This process is now universally 
called "Pasteurization". Weigmann f s treatise on "Pasteuriza¬ 
tion and Sterilization of Milk" (1$93) is one of the oldest 
known records of the step-by-step development of the process 
and machinery for pasteurization up to 1$93• Weigmann wrote 
of holding systems of regenerative heaters and coolers and 
of thermal death points years before interest in them became 
active in other parts of the world. He states that in l$3l

Fesca of Berlin, Germany, invented the first continually 
working apparatus for the heating of milk for the purpose of 
preserving same and in l£$6 Thiel invented the gravity flash 
pasteurizer. These flash pasteurizers were definitely of the 
"high-temperature short-time Tf type and represented the first 
steps in commercial pasteurization. 

Public health regulations prohibited the commercial use 
of flash pasteurization because the equipment and controls 
then available made it difficult or impossible to pasteurize 
milk satisfactorily. When the milk was heated to 160°F. not 
all pathogenic bacteria were destroyed. Higher temperatures, 
such as 1?0°F., reduced creaming but gave good results 
bacteriologically. Further, there were no quick-acting 
accurate temperature controls, the flow rate was not constant, 
there was no definite holding time and the mixing of raw and 
pasteurized milk was possible. Under such circumstances 
public health officials justly condemned flash pasteurization 
and consequently, it was superceded by the commonly known 
holder method which could be more accurately controlled in 
commercial operation. 

However, with improvements in automatic control devices 
and the use of hot water as a heating medium, milk could be 
made to flow at a controlled rate in a very thin layer over 
or between heated surfaces so that its temperature could be 
rapidly adjusted and regulated. This method provided more

accurate control of time and temperature and thus has become 
known as the "high-temperature short-time" modification of the 
process of flash pasteurization. HTST pasteurization presented 
new problems but soon gained the confidence of public health 
officials and thus has become a legal method of pasteurization 
in many parts of the world. 

For various reasons the holder method -is now being rapidly 
replaced by the HTST method. Yale (1933), reviewed the develop¬ 
ment of HTST pasteurizers in which provision was made for the 
control of the holding time for very short periods of time at 
temperatures in the range of 160°F. The first American 
pasteurizer of this type was the Electropure, manufactured by 
the Trumbell Electric Mfg. Co., Plainville, Conn. This 
pasteurizer was a modification of an earlier electrical 
pasteurizer based on the developments in electrical pasteuri¬ 
zation in England in the period 1913 to 1920. The first models 
were essentially flash pasteurizers as the holding time was 
estimated as being about 3 to 4 seconds; subsequent modifica¬ 
tions studied in 1927 are reported to have had holding times 
between the heater outlet and the cooler inlet ranging from 
11.1 to 19*7 seconds. Other types of HTST pasteurizers using 
hot water and steam as heating mediums, including the plate 
pasteurizer developed in England, were introduced between 1920 
and 1930.

Standards for Pasteurization 

A review of the early literature reveals that the times 
and temperatures recommended for heating milk showed wide 
variation and uncertainty. Variation in the reports of bacterio¬ 
logists on the thermal death times of pathogenic bacteria was 
one of the chief reasons that no single standard for pasteuri¬ 
zation was recognized. Another cause for uncertainty in any 
one standard was the variation in the temperatures and times 
recommended by leading bacteriologists of that time. 

According to investigations reported by North et al (1925) 
temperature-time combinations of 140°F. for 15 to 30 minutes 
were sufficient to destroy Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Con¬ 
sequently, in 1911 and again in 1917 the National Commission 
on Milk Standards in New York recommended 145°F. for 30 
minutes. However, this standard was soon shown to have an 
injurious effect on the creaming properties of the milk and 
as a result many areas adopted a standard of 142°F. for 30 
minutes. The Endicott experiments of 1921-1923, conducted 
by North et al, confirmed the safety of the adopted standard 
of 142°F. for 30 minutes. However, they recommended that in 
order to conform to this standard the indust^ must adjust the 
temperature of pasteurizing machines to a degree or two above 
the minimum temperature of 142°F. to allow for fluctuations. 

This led to the present minimum standard of 143°F. for 30 minutes 
for low temperature pasteurization in the U.3.A. and Canada.

At this time there was no acceptable standard for HTST 
pasteurization as it was not considered a dependable process. 
However, due to improvements in design of heaters, and in 
temperature control and safety devices, there developed a de¬ 
mand for recognition of this process as a dependable method of 
pasteurization. As a result, the U.S. Public Health Service 
in cooperation with the New York State, New York City and 
Pennsylvania State Health Departments in 1927 initiated studies 
on HTST pasteurizers. Moss (1940) and Fuchs (1951) both 
report that on the basis of this work the standard of a 
minimum of l60°F. for a minimum holding time of 15 seconds 
was recommended. Holland and Dahlberg (1940) report that around 
1927 the New York Standard for HTST pasteurization was set at 
a minimum of 160°F. for a minimum holding of 20 seconds, this 
standard being subsequently modified to 15 seconds holding at 
the same temperature. The U.S. Public Health Service Milk 
Ordinance and Code (1939) demands for HTST pasteurization 
heating to a minimum of 160°F. for a minimum holding time of 
15 seconds. This, according to Fuchs (1951), was changed in 
1949 to l6l°F. for the same holding period, the change being 
based on the findings and recommendations of Sanders and Sager 
(194$) regarding phosphatase inactivation. 

In Canada we do not have a standard ordinance and code 
for the handling of milk such as that prepared by the U.S. 

Public Health Service. However, the same temperature has been

seconds. However, according to Lethem (1950), this has now 
been amended to l6l°F. for the same time. In Europe higher 
temperatures are commonly used and little if any regard is 
paid to the consequent reduction in cream volume.

Thermal Death Times of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 


The themal death times of M. tuberculosis in the tem¬ 
perature range of holder pasteurization have received a great 
deal of study. The accepted fact that this organism is more 
resistant to heat than other pathogens likely to be present 
in milk was confirmed by Rosenau (190£). Further studies by 
North and Park (1927), Park (192?, a) and Park (1927, b) 
have attempted to establish the precise temperature-time 
combinations necessary to destroy this organism in milk. As 
a result, it is today generally accepted that this bacterium 
is killed in milk at 142°F. in 10 minutes. 

No equivalent data are available for the temperature 
range of HTST pasteurization but the studies of North and 
Park (1927) have carried much weight in establishing standards 
in this range. Since bacterial death is logarithmic, Dahlberg 
(1932) in plotting North and Park’s data on semi-logarithmic 
paper, obtained a straight line death curve. The resulting 
curve cuts the l60°F. line at 11.2 seconds. There is at present 
no experimental proof to confirm this extrapolated result. 

If the data of North and Park had represented true "thermal 
death points 11 then extrapolation may have been justified. 

Wilson (1942) in reviewing the investigations on this subject 
attempts to justify a thermal death time for this pathogen of 
12 seconds at 160°F. Park (1927, b) indicated the thermal

death point of tubercle bacilli in milk at 160°F. as 30 
seconds* 

In recent years a new conception of bacterial destruction 
has developed. According to Ball (1943) the trend appears to 
be away from the procedures that show absolute destruction 
points and. toward those that reveal rates of destruction of 
bacteria. In the broadest sense, therefore, theoretically 
there is no "thermal death time". Universal recognition is 
given to this conception in the canning industry and their 
processes are now based on death rates rather than thermal 
death points. These rate-of-destruction curves when plotted 
on semi-logarithmic co-ordinates yield straight line curves 
since bacterial destruction is logarithmic. Thus the Z value 
of these straight line destruction curves becomes an important 
factor in the evaluation of the thermal process. 

The "thermal death time" curve in Dahlberg T s analysis of 
the North and Park data has a Z value of 10.5°F. while Park T s 
(1927, a) data analysed the same way have a Z value of 12.&°F. 
Thus, considerable variation is evident which is caused by 
the inconsistency of the results to form a perfect straight 
line destruction curve. Obviously, techniques would cause 
such a variation. On careful analysis of the North and Park 
data in a manner similar to Dahlberg T s, one finds a distinct 
area in which the true "thermal death times" probably lie. 
Further, on extrapolation into the region of HTST pasteuriza¬ 
tion the "thermal death time" is found to be between 12 and

20 seconds at 160°F. Thus, the precise temperature-time 
relationships for M. tuberculosis are not definitely known 
but it seems, from the data mentioned, that the Z value lies 
in the neighborhood of 10.5-13°F. 

The Z value of the M. tuberculosis thermal death curve 
has a very iniportant bearing on present conceptions of pasteuri¬ 
zation. The inactivation of milk phosphatase has become the 
universal routine test for proper pasteurization. Although 
there is still much to be learned about the inactivation and 
temperature-time relations, nevertheless, the test can be 
reasonably soundly applied in low temperature long time 
(usually abbreviated to LTLT) pasteurization. As in the case 
of M. tuberculosis , the relation to HTST pasteurization is 
still somewhat obscure. If the Z value for inactivation of 
phosphatase lies between & and 9°F. as reported by Lear and 
Foster (1949), then it appears that the two destruction curves 
must cross at some point in the region of HTST pasteurization. 

That commercial HTST pasteurization is giving adequate 
protection is confirmed by the studies which have been made 
of commercial machines. Hiscox (1944) reviewed these in 1944. 
The results are from various parts of the world and although 
they do not represent true "thermal death times” evidence is 
presented that the times and temperatures at which the plants 
operated were sufficient to insure the destruction of all 
tubercle bacilli.

Development of Phosphatase Test 

The need for a practical test for detecting the degree of 
heat-treatment of milk has been felt for some time. Bacterial 
counts, recording thermometer charts and plant inspection do 
not always furnish reliable means of ascertaining that milk 
has been properly pasteurized. 

The heating of milk inactivates more or less completely 
the enzymes which were originally present in the raw milk. 
Consequently, several tests for pasteurization have been 
developed based on this inactivation. The completeness of the 
enzyme destruction obviously depends very largely on the tem¬ 
perature and the time during which the milk has been exposed 
to heat and on the specific characteristics of the individual 
enzyme. The enzyme peroxidase has been used as the basis of 
pasteurization tests but this enzyme is not inactivated until 
the heating is carried to about 170°F. which is not suitable 
today. The amylase test had considerable use but lacked 
sensitivity, while the catalase, protease and lipase tests 
for pasteurization have not been successful because of their 
heat inactivation characteristics. 

Kay and Graham (1934) claimed that at any temperature 
from 140°-l67°F. 96% destruction of phosphatase indicates com¬ 
plete destruction of M. tuberculosis . Shortly after this Kay 
and Graham (1933) reported the phosphatase test for pasteurized 
milk. The development of this test has provided a tool for

the control of pasteurization which has not yet reached the 
limit of its potential usefulness. The test was developed 
for British standards of pasteurization, i.e., 145°-150°F. for 
30 minutes, and according to Fasken and McClure (1940) slight 
modifications are needed to make the original test suitable 
for examination of milk pasteurized at 143°F. for 30 minutes. 
Modifications and improvements of the original test, up to 
1939, are reviewed by Burgwald (1939)• 

In 194& v , after extensive study, the phosphatase test, as 
modified by Sanders and Sager (1947), was made an official 
method by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists 
(194$) for testing fluid milk, cream, cheddar-type cheeses and 
the soft unripened cheeses as an index of the adequacy of 
pasteurization. The test of Sanders and Sager was adopted 
because it was more sensitive than preceding tests. A raw 
milk contamination of 0.1$ in pasteurized milk is detectable 
visually and a concentration of 0.05$ can be detected with a 
photo-electric colorimeter. 

The Nature of Phosphatase 

The enzyme phosphatase is a specific esterase which will 
hydrolyse esters of phosphoric acid. Since its first discovery 
in 1907 it has become increasingly important and it has now 
been established that some 15-20 phosphatases exist. Because 
of their importance in bone formation, carbohydrate metabolism

etc., we find them present in practically all living cells and 
in many biological fluids. The phosphatases are generally 
divided into two groups: alkaline phosphatase, with an optimum 
pH of from $ to 10, and acid phosphatase with an optimum. pH 
of from 4 to 5* 

Milk normally contains both the alkaline and acid phos¬ 
phatases. According to Mullen (1950) the concentration of the 
acid phosphatase in milk is low, being about one fortieth of 
the concentration of the alkaline phosphatase. Very little 
is definitely known about the chemical constitution of the 
phosphatases in milk. Since all enzymes are now thought of 
as being protein or protein-related materials it is reasonable 
to assume that phosphatase is at least partly protein in 
nature. These views are borne out by Massart and Vandendriessche 
(1945) who suggest that milk phosphatase is a "heavy metal 
(zinc) proteid". Andersen (1949) explains certain observations 
on alkaline phosphatases, by assuming that the protein of the 
enzyme is a mixture of several components which may be, accord¬ 
ing to Moelwyn-Hughes (1940), at different stages in their 
electrolytic dissociation. Qualitatively, however, the nature 
of the enzyme protein or associated protein may be related to 
the degree of specificity of the enzyme action. As to the 
protein nature itself, those enzymes thus far reported in the 
literature as crystalline and substantially pure are protein 
in nature. In this form, however, they may require for effect¬ 
ive action coenzymes or other materials which are themselves 
inactive.

As yet, no practical use has been made of the acid 
phosphatase which is present in normal raw milk* According to 
Mullen (1950) this enzyme possesses properties of thermo¬ 
stability being onl}?- 10-20% inactivated by the normal conditions 
of pasteurization. The enzyme, however, exhibits considerable 
instability towards visible radiation, being 50% inactivated 
by 60 minute exposure to spring sunlight, and is inhibited by 
chloroform and formaldehyde. In contrast, the alkaline phos¬ 
phatase which is present in normal raw milk has a practical 
value. It is inactivated during pasteurization and this 
property has been made use of in the development of the phos¬ 
phatase test for pasteurization. It is also very stable, being 
unaffected by several preservatives. Alkaline phosphatase 
has received considerably more attention than the acid enzyme 
in milk and therefore any further reference to phosphatase In 
this report shall mean the alkaline phosphatase unless other¬ 
wise stated. 

The location of phosphatase in normal milk has been in¬ 
vestigated by several authors. Invariably they report that it 
is located to a large extent, but not entirely, at the fat-serum 
interface. Kay and Graham (1934) believe it to be present 
either in the very thin, mainly protein, layer which covers 
the fat globules or is adsorbed on the fat globules in such a 
way that the greater part of it may be removed by further

treatment, e.g. churning. Further they report that on centri- 

A 

fuging melted butter nearly all the enzyme present is found 
dissolved in the aqueous portion which shows that the enzyme 
is probably not even in part fat-soluble. Sjostrom (1949) 
proposes a similar theory suggesting that milk phosphatase 
is linked with the proteins rather than with the lipoids of 
the fat-globule membrane. Hetrick and Tracy (194$) show that 
the enzyme probably is concentrated at the fat-serum interface, 
perhaps in a manner similar to agglutinin, since butter oil had 
no phosphatase activity and the buttermilk exhibited an activity 
approximately ten times that of skim milk. According to Rimpila 
and Palmer (1935) most of the phosphatase in cream appears to 
be so tenaciously adsorbed to the fat globule that even washing 
six times with distilled water failed to remove more than 50% 
from the cream. These observations led them to conclude defi¬ 
nitely that the enzyme in cream is a constituent of the fat 
globule "membrane" and cannot be washed awa}?- with water. 

The presence of phosphatase, like that of so many other 
enzymes, is indicated by activity rather than isolation. In 
the phosphatase test for pasteurization the presence of the 
enzyme is indicated by the liberation of phenol from di-sodium 
phenylphosphate by the activity of the enzyme. The phenol is 
then allowed to react with B.Q.C. (2,6-dibromoquinonechloroimide) 
and the resulting blue color lends itself to colorimetric 
analysis.

Inactivation of Phosphatase 

Bigelow (1921) observed the logarithmic nature of the 
thermal death times of bacterial spores at different process 
temperatures. These data, when plotted on semi-logarithmic 
paper, usually describe a straight line. The literature on 
the study of heat inactivation of milk phosphatase in the region 
of HTST pasteurization indicates that the rate of inactivation 
is rapid and, according to Kay and Graham (1935), Koppejan (1936) 
and Van Bever and Straub (1943), follows a mono-molecular law, 
i.e., is a first order reaction. However, other results seem 
to indicate that the inactivation is not strictly first order 
but, as Hetrick and Tracy (194$) mention, possibly a pseudo- 
first order reaction. According to Andersen (1949) the great 
increase in the velocity of destruction, caused by the rise in 
temperature, follows the Arrhenius equation. This means that 
the temperature-time relationships form a straight line when 
plotted in a semi-logarithmic manner. However, several investi¬ 
gators have shown that a plot of temperature vs. the log time 
for inactivation at that temperature yields a straight line. 

This observation becomes important in the evaluation of the 
thermal process. 

Marquardt and Dahlberg T s (1931) analysis of creaming 
results by the use of semi-logarithmic paper drew attention to 
this method for the analysis of creaming data which exhibit 
logarithmic phenomena. Kay and Graham (1934) established the

temperature-time combination necessary to destroy 96% of the 
phosphatase in milk and plotting these in a logarithmic form 
they obtained a straight line curve. On the same graph they 
plotted the straight line curve developed from the North and 
Park (1927) data by Dahlberg (1932). On analysing these two 
curves they attempted to justify the adequacy of the phosphatase 
test over the range 140°-l67°F. The Z value of their destruc¬ 
tion curve is approximately 11.7°F. which is quite different 
from that obtained by other authors. This is probably due to 
inaccuracies in measurements at higher temperatures since 
their shortest holding time was only 20 seconds. 

Since Kay and Graham’s original analysis of the inactiva¬ 
tion of phosphatase, several authors have again attempted to 
establish the temperature-time relationships necessary for the 
destruction. Holland and Dahlberg (1940) devised an experi¬ 
mental apparatus whereby the heating-up period was only from 
3 to 10 seconds depending on the desired temperature. This 
method reduced the heating-up period considerably but no mention 
is made of the cooling time. Presumably, the samples were 
removed and placed in an ice bath. When their results were 
plotted on semi-logarithmic paper a straight line curve over 
the range 140°-l65°F. was obtained, the Z value of this being 
$.35°F. The fact that the lower portion of the curve is not 
a straight line probably indicates that control of conditions 
at high temperatures are more important than similar controls 
at lower temperatures.

Sanders and Sager (194$), again using a laboratory 
pasteurizer, established a temperature-time combination which 
when plotted on appropriate paper gave a Z value of £.73°F. 

In this apparatus the milk required 6 seconds to be heated to 
the desired holding temperature, where it was held for periods 
of time which were accurate to 43 seconds, while removed samples 
were cooled in ice water. However, they attempt to justify 
heating-time lags by subtracting either 3 or 4 seconds, depending 
on sample size, from their total heated times. 

Hetrick and Tracy (194$) reported a straight line curve, 
for inactivation of phosphatase, which has a Z value of 9°F. 

They used a Mallory small-tube heat exchanger as their heat 
treating apparatus and reported that with this unit only 0.^3 
seconds were necessary to heat the milk to the desired tempera¬ 
ture. Samples were removed into test tubes which previously 
had been immersed in ice water but no times for cooling are 
reported. 

Lear and Foster (1949) developed an apparatus for heat 
treating milk which required 7 -1 seconds to reach the desired 
temperature. It was then held in a holding tube for a period 
of time which was accurate to seconds. Samples were removed 
by pipettes, after various time intervals, and cooled in ice 
water. With this unit the inactivation of phosphatase was 
studied and the reported straight line curve has a Z value of 
£.&2°F. Other Z values are reported by them and the signifi¬ 
cance of equal Z values is explained.

The results indicate considerable variation as to the required 
time necessary to produce the desired inactivation. There 
are probably three causes for this variation. Firstly, the 
methods of heat-treatment varied i.e., the heating-up and 
cooling periods were significantly different. Secondly, the 
methods of analysis for phosphatase varied. Thirdly, the end 
point chosen to indicate inactivation varied from as low as 
0.5 ppm (Lear and Foster) to 40 ppm (Holland and Dahlberg). 

The Sanders and Sager (1947) test for phosphatase 
inactivation has now been made the official method for analysis 
by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists and with 
this test the criterion of pasteurization is 2 mmg. phenol/ 

0.5 ml of milk which is equal to 4 ppm.

Creaming Inactivation 

Extensive studies by Dahlberg and his associates (1929) 
(1931) (1932) (1940) claimed that the time-temperature com¬ 
binations that result in a significant reduction in the cream¬ 
ing of milk are considerably above those required to destroy 
M. tuberculosis as shown by the data of North and Park. When 
they plotted these data and a line joining the standards of 
pasteurization on semi-logarithmic paper a considerable margin 
is to be observed between the pasteurization standards and 
significant reduction in creaming. This margin of safety as 
regards creaming is greatest for low temperature pasteurization 
and least in the region of HTST pasteurization viiere it is 
approximately 9 seconds. 

Early standards for milk pasteurization on this continent 
included a maximum as well as a minimum temperature but ex¬ 
perience with these standards soon demonstrated that the 
maximum temperature was determined by its effect on the cream 
layer. Consequently, present standards take cognizance of this 
fact. The principle that has been allowed is to set the minimum 
temperature as close to the point of cream volume interference 
as is practical taking into consideration the sensitivity of 
controller and recording thermometer. The change in the 
standard for holder pasteurization from the former 142°F. to 
the present minimum of 143°E. was made on this basis.

• The literature on the creaming of milk is extensive and 
no attempt will be made to review it. This subject is 
thoroughly covered by Dahlberg and Marquardt (1929) and more 
recently by Dunkley and Sommer (1944)• The main interest 
will be with information on methods of measuring and inter¬ 
preting significant impairment of creaming. 

Holland and Dahlberg (1940) outline the method that was 
employed in their studies and by others in the measurement 
and comparison of cream volumes. In this method the milk 
being studied is placed in 100 ml measuring cylinders that 
are stored in an ice-water bath. Storage is not necessarily 
maintained at this temperature and is usually at around 40°F. 
for a period of 24 hours. In order to measure the effect of 
various time-temperature treatments on cream volume a control 
is used that has been heated momentarily to 140°F. followed 
by rapid cooling to 40°F. The temperature to which the control 
is heated only needs to be sufficiently high to liquefy the 
fat which according to Sharp and Krukovsky (1939) and Dunkley 
and Sommer (1944) will result in the desorption of euglobulin 
and be followed by its reorientation at the fat globule 
surfaces when solidification of the fat globules takes place. 
Heating to a temperature of 135°-140°F. momentarily insures 
thorough liquefaction of the fat globules and does not 
interfere with creaming. It is a procedure that was esta¬ 
blished prior to present knowledge of creaming.

There does not appear to be any standard procedure for 
interpreting significant reduction in cream volume when study¬ 
ing the effect of a range of time-temperature treatment of 
milk. Holland et al (1940) in experiments at HTST temperatures 
considered that a reduction of one ml in cream volume below 
the control was sufficient to indicate a definite destruction 
of creaming ability and the next shorter holding period was 
plotted as the longest holding time milk could be held at 
that temperature without influencing adversely the creaming 
properties of the milk. Marquardt and Bahlberg (1931) took 
the time-temperature treatment that gave the first reduction 
of 0.2 percent or more in the creaming index as the point of 
significant impairment of creaming. Dahlberg et al (1941) 
chose the commercial pasteurization of milk at 144°F. for 
30 minutes as the endpoint and considered any reduction in 
cream volume below this point as significant. Millenkv and 
Brueckner (1941) in a comparative study of HTST and LTLT 
pasteurization conclude that a 2 percent difference in the 
cream volume is not noticeable when milk bottles containing 
milk with varying cream volume percentages were examined. It 
will be obvious that the significance of a 2 percent difference 
in the cream volume of bottled milk will depend upon the 
butterfat content of the milk and the shape of the upper 
portion of the bottle.

Pumping Characteristics of Milk arid Water 

The rotary pumps extensively used on HTST pasteurizers 
have positive displacement, which means that the fluid is 
delivered to the discharge pipe in successive isolated quantities 
under positive pressure. These isolated quantities may be 
small or large depending on the particular characteristics 
of the pump. Because such pumps have close mechanical clear¬ 
ances, there is little loss due to slip when the liquid being 
pumped is of high viscosity. The volumetric efficiency is, 
however, affected by variations in:- 

1. Pump speed. 

2. Pressure at discharge. 

3. Viscosity of the material being pumped. 

4. Vacuum on suction side. 

5* Amount of entrained air or gas in material being 
pumped. 

The pump may be operated at a speed above that at which 
its passages will be completely filled and, therefore, the 
volumetric efficiency will be decreased. 

According to accepted theories of hydraulics, as the 
pressure at the discharge increases, the material being pumped 
tends to be forced back through the clearances to the suction 
side of the pump. This material, the slip, increases not 
only with the discharge pressure but also with a decrease in

the viscosity of the materials being pumped. Theoretical 
displacement minus actual displacement equals slip, and as 
slip increases, the volumetric efficiency decreases. 

With an increase of vacuum at' the suction side of the 
pump, because of high suction lift or a long or crooked suction 
pipe, the entrained air or gas in the material being pumped 
will naturally expand and will occupy more of the pump 
displacement. A smaller portion of the displacement, there¬ 
fore, will be left for the liquid and the volumetric efficiency 
will decrease. 

The effect of viscosity on volumetric efficiency is 
related to pump speed as well as discharge pressure. At pump 
speeds that are low enough to permit the pump to fill, 
volumetric efficiencjr increases with viscosity because a more 
viscous liquid forms a better seal. 

Milk and water differ in their physical properties. 
According to Sommer (1946) the viscosity of milk at 30°C. is 
1.640 cp. while that of water is only 0.$01 cp. Their specific 
gravities also vary, milk being slightly higher, at 1.032. 

It is conceivable that these differences might be reflected 
in their pumping characteristics. Weber (1947) reports 
increases of milk flow over water flow in a study of commercial 
pasteurizers of from 0 to 23 percent, with the same pump 
setting. No explanation is offered in those cases where no

increase took place. Cuttell (194$) reports that the milk- 
rate will be slightly higher than the water rate under the 
same plant conditions. He attributes this increased milk 
flow rate over water to the greater density and viscosity 
of milk. However, no experimental evidence is given. 

Robinson and Moss (194$) studied 34 commercial HTST pasteurizers 
and found that because of the increased capacity on milk over 
that on water the holding time may be decreased as much as 
26,7 percent. 

Measuring Holding Time 

The requirement of a minimum of 15 to 1.6 seconds holding 
time in HTST pasteurization introduced the problem of develop¬ 
ing methods for measuring accurately the time of milk flow 
through the holder of HTST pasteurizers. The following are 
the methods that have been developed for this purpose:- 

1. Dye or visual. 

2. Salt or conductivity. 

3. Thermal. 

4. Bacterial. 

Both the dye and salt methods are adaptations from 
hydraulic engineering. The dye method was used extensively 
in the timing of retarder and other continuous flow pasteurizers. 
Its use in timing HTST holders has been discontinued on this

continent mainly because it cannot be used when pasteurizing 
milk and endpoint recognition is difficult, Cuttell (194$) 
states that this method is still extensively used in Great 
Britain. According to Dummett and Mongar (194$) the sensiti¬ 
vity of the dye method corresponds to a dilution of about 1 
to 5,000, while a modification of this method which they 
developed using nickel chloride with dimethylglyoxime as a 
detector has a sensitivity of 1 in 100,000. 

The salt or conductivity method is being used and tested 
extensively at the present time on this continent. The method 
as applied to the HTST pasteurizer is described by Roger (1939) 
and Fay and Fraser (1943)- According to Weber (1947) it is 
quite complicated and cannot be used directly on milk, it is 
not standardized and its accuracy is unknown. In a recent 
investigation Jordan (1949) studied this method extensively 
and determined that dye, salt, and bacteria are all transported 
at the sdme rate by a stream of flowing water. He concludes 
that, if sensitive means are used to measure dye and salt, 
these substances can be employed to measure the holding time 
of bacteria under the same conditions. Robinson and Moss 
(194$) found that a range in volume of injection of saturated 
NaCl solution from 50 to 150 ml had little effect on the 
holding time measurements when tests w^ere made on large 
installations. 

Thomasson (1945) introduced a thermal method of timing 
based on temperature changes recorded by the recording thermo¬ 
meter when cold pasteurized milk was introduced at the entrance

of the holding tube. Robinson and Moss (194$) used a modi¬ 
fication of this method on a number of commercial pasteurizers 
and compared it with the salt method. They reported the 
thermal method, in which the fluctuation of the recording 
thermometer needle was taken as the end point, to give 
holding times 1.81 seconds longer on the average than the 
salt method. This increased time is undoubtedly caused by 
a number of factors such as the sensitivity and response of 
the recorder-controller. Jordan (1949) reports some pre¬ 
liminary results in a comparison of an improved thermal timer 
manufactured by the Foxboro Company, Foxboro, Massachusetts, 
based on the measurement of a thermal wave produced in the 
heater section of the pasteurizer, thus eliminating critici3n 
of the injection of solutions into the holding tube. The 
preliminary results indicate that this method, comparable in 
accuracy to the salt test, can be used on milk while the 
pasteurizer is in operation. 

It should also be noted that the injection of bacteria 
into the holding tube has been employed as another method of 
measuring flow time. 

All the test methods reported in the literature for- 
che.cking the holding time of HT3T pasteurizers are based on 
the measurement of the holding time in the holder, a tubular 
section extending from the outlet of the heater section to the 
location of the sensitive bulbs of the indicating thermometer

and the controller-recorder. The length of time required for 
the fastest particle of milk to pass through this section of 
the pasteurizer represents only a part of the time that the 
milk is subjected to temperatures that are lethal to bacteria. 

In fact in some installations it may represent only approximately 
50 percent of the time that the milk is at or above 160°F. 

In this connection it is interesting to note that unpublished 
data of the New York State Department of Health, made in the 
early days of HTST pasteurization and reported by Weber (1947), 
show the inactivation of large inoculations of M. tuberculosis 
at 15$°F. for a calculated holding time of 2.2 to 3*7 seconds 
in the Electropure pasteurizer; and 152°F. when samples were 
taken at the outlet of the heater of a plate-type pasteurizer. 
These results point to the importance of the unmeasured or 
unknown time that is not measured in testing the holding tube 
but is of importance in the pasteurization of the milk. In 
addition to the lethal effect of the time-temperature factor 
in heating the milk to 160°F. or above there is the influence 
of the untimed portion of the milk above 160°F. and the time 
that the milk is subjected to a lethal time-temperature factor 
during cooling. It appears that if the holding time is to 
be controlled then the whole time that the milk is subjected 
to a temperature lethal to bacteria should be measured. It 
is doubtful whether this procedure is routinely feasible in 
commercial practice but an interesting application of this

principle was studied by Dahlberg et al (1941) in what they 
termed w Quick-Time TT pasteurization. In this modification of 
pasteurization, the milk was heated for intervals of 5, 6, 12, 
and 24 seconds above 140°F. with maximum temperatures in the 
range of l69 0 -177*5°F. They report that at the higher tem¬ 
peratures there appears to be a greater margin between the 
temperature at which creaming is impaired and the temperature 
that gave milk with a negative phosphatase test than existed 
in pasteurization at lower temperatures. 


EXPERIMENTAL 


I. Methods 

(a) Type of Pasteurizer 

The plate-type HTST pasteurizer used in this study is 
shown in Figure 1. This pasteurizer was arranged for a 
capacity of 1000 pounds of milk per hour. It was equipped 
with a Waukesha positive displacement pump, a type of pump 
used exclusively in the United States and Canada. The pump 
was located between the regenerative and heating sections 
of the pasteurizer in order to assure a higher pressure on 
the pasteurized milk in this section of the pasteurizer, 
which is a requirement of the U. S. Public Health Service 
(1939). This requirement is for the purpose of insuring

that the raw milk will always be under negative pressure 
and thus any leaks that might develop in the exchanger, 
because of flaws in the metal parts, will not permit entry 
of raw milk into the pasteurized product. In England pro¬ 
tection in this regard is not insisted on and controlled 
centrifugal pumps are used. 

The float control tank was located below the milk level 
in the pasteurizer, another provision to assure negative 
pressure on the unpasteurized milk in the regenerator. The 
milk was maintained at a uniform level in the float control 
tank and it was kept well stirred in order to assure a 
uniform fat content. 

The study was conducted during the summers of 1949, 1950 
and 1951. Recommendations at the end of the first and 
second summers resulted in alterations to the pasteurizer and 
thus completely comparable conditions did not exist through¬ 
out the investigation. However, most of the data used are 
from the observations of the last two mentioned years during 
which time the plate arrangements differed. Thus the 1950 
and 1951 conditions are referred to as plate arrangement 
A and B respectively. Results are recorded according to 
the particular plate arrangement of the pasteurizer and thus 
are indicative of the particular conditions for that year. 

To provide various thermal treatments, in the range of 
HTST pasteurization, the pasteurizer was modified by varying 
the holding tubes, which were carefully sloped upwards to 
prevent entrapment of air.

(b) Source of Milk 

The milk, ranging from 2.7 to 4.0% fat content, was 
supplied from the milk storage tank of one of the local 
dairies. The milk at the lower end of this range was rather 
low in milk fat for mixed milk from a number of herds but is 
accounted for in part at least by the predominance of Holstein 
cattle in the Edmonton milk shed. There may have been occasions 
when the milk in the storage tank was largely from one herd 
as the selection and shipment of the milk was not supervised 
beyond the request that it be taken from the storage tank 
in order to give better assurance of average milk. 

(c} Sampling Procedure 

The pasteurizer -was operated on water until the operating 
conditions were stabilized and the timing and flow rate 
measurements completed. The water was then displaced with 
milk and the heat-treatment of the milk proceeded with. The 
temperature of the heat-treatment was lowered to the lowest 
temperature necessary for that particular series and then 
gradually raised to the maximum temperature desired. Samples 
for phosphatase and creaming tests were taken off the cooler 
section at 40°-45°F. The time for the milk to flow from the 
indicating thermometer location, at the end of the holding 
tube, to the outlet of the cooler was determined and this time 
interval was employed to set the time of sampling at each 
temperature interval studied.

(d) T irn in g Me a sur era errt s 

All flow-time measurements reported in this study were 
made with the salt test when operating the pasteurizer on 
tap water, employing essentially the method as outlined by 
Fay and Fraser (1943)• The measurements were made just prior 
to heat-treatment of milk in each trial. At first the elect¬ 
rodes were mounted in rubber stoppers that were fitted into 
openings at the upstream end of the holding tube, the down¬ 
stream end of the holding tube, the pasteurized milk entrance 
to the regenerator and the cold pasteurized milk outlet of 
the pasteurizer. Fourteen gauge copper wire electrodes were 
2 mm. apart and 2 cm. long as recommended by Jordan et al 
(1949)• Later electrodes recommended for the 3A* Standard 
Method for Determining the Holding Time of HTST Pasteurizers 
by Means of the Salt Conductivity Test (1950), were used 
wherever possible. No differences were observed in the timing 
measurements when these electrodes were compared. The saturated 
salt solution was injected manually in 40 ml quantities, 
through a spray type nozzle to avoid impelling the solution 
in the direction of flow. All time intervals were measured 
manually with a stop-watch.

Food Sanitarians, the United States Public Health Service

Electrodes of 32 gauge sheet tin, insulated with 
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company special electrical 
tape No. 33, were inserted between the plates for measuring 
flow-times between selected points. These electrodes were 
found to be as sensitive as the regular electrodes previously 
described. Some difficulty was experienced in preventing 
short circuits because the space between the plates was only 
1-2 mm. 

(e) Definition of Terms 

Rate of flow:- the pounds of milk or water delivered within 
a given time measured with a stop watch, the time being 
usually 5 minutes and from this the rate, in pounds or 
gallons per hour, is calculated. 

Holding time:- the flow-time measured from the outlet of the 
heater to the location of the indicating thermometer and 
controller-bulb at the end of the holding tube. The 
holding times reported refer to calculated milk holding 
times unless otherwise stated. 

Pipeline time:- the flow-time measured from the outlet of 

the heater to the pasteurized milk inlet to the regenerator. 
Control time:- is the measured time during which the medium 
is not below the controlled temperature. 

Milk flow-times:- are calculated times found by multiplying. 

water flow-time by the ratio water flow-rate to milk flow- 
rate at the same pump setting.

Creaming index:- the numerical figure obtained by dividing 

the cream volume in percentage by the milk fat content of 
the milk in percentage. 

(f) Phosphatase Inactivation 

Because of its accurac}^ the phosphatase test as developed 
by Sanders and Sager (1947) was used in all determinations 
of phosphatase, with no important deviation from their method 
as laid down by the Association of Official Agricultural 
Chemists (194$). Color transmission was measured at 600 mu, 
using an Evelyn photo-electric colorimeter with 10 ml tubes. 
The quantities of phenol, after consideration of the controls, 
were read directl}^ from a standard transmission-concentration 
curve prepared with known amounts of phenol. All samples 
were tested the day following the heat-treatments and were 
stored in the interval between sampling and testing at a 

temperature of 40°F. A negative phosphatase test indicating 

/ 

pasteurization of milk is signified by a phenol level of 2 mmg 
per 0.5 ml of milk which is equal to 4 p.p.m. of phenol. 

In this investigation the procedure adopted by Sanders and 
Sager (194$) of reporting phosphatase activity as units of 
phosphatase rather than the concentration of phenol in p.p.m. 
was followed.

(g) Creaming Measurements 

Cream volume measurements were all made in duplicate 
on 100 ml of milk in 100 ml graduated cylinders. The milk 
as taken from the cooler outlet of the pasteurizer was 
poured into the measuring cylinders, leveled at the 100 ml 
mark, and placed in ice water. At the end of 4 hours and 
24 hours the cream volume was measured with calipers and 
recorded in percentage. After the 4-hour reading the 
cylinders were maintained at 40°F. until the 24-hour reading. 

The cylinders were carefully selected and only those 
with an accuracy within -0.5 ml were used. 

The control or activated sample was heated to 140°F. 
momentarily?- and then cooled quickly to 45°F. through a 
copper coil suspended in ice water. 

The 24-hour creaming measurements only are reported as 
it has been shown by Millenky and Brueckner (1941) that the 
cream volume of milk pasteurized in HT3T pasteurizers reaches 
a maximum in 24 hours. 

In the present study, on significant cream volume 
destruction, the cream volume in percentage is reported. 

This procedure was also adopted by Holland and Dahlberg 
(1940). For graphic presentation it was considered that a 
reduction of 1 ml in cream volume was sufficient to indicate 
definite destruction of creaming ability. This represents 
a change of \% in the cream volume since 100 ml graduates 


were used.

(h) Temperature Measurements 

All thermocouples and indicating thermometers were 
calibrated against a thermometer graduated to 0.1°C. and 
certified by the Physics Division of the National Research 
Council to 0.01°C. All temperatures reported herein are 
corrected to the nearest 0.1°F. on this basis. 

Temperatures between the plates we're calculated from 
readings of thermocouples of Leeds and Northrup copper and 
constantan wires held between the plates at a constant 
distance of 2 inches from the peripheral rubber gaskets. 
Insulation for the wires was provided where required and care 
was exercised to minimize interference with liquid flow. 

II. Results 

( a ) Performance of the Experimental HTST Pasteurizer 

(1) Holding Tube Difficulties 

The first holding tube provided with the pasteurizer 
consisted of a vertical U-tube extending downward from the 
outlet of the heater section at the top of the pasteurizer 
to the flow diversion valve. Calculated holding times for 
milk in this holding tube, based upon water flow measurements, 
were in the neighborhood of 7 seconds when the pasteurizer 
was operating at approximately its rated capacity. Thus the 
pasteurizer did not meet the specified holding time requirements.

Further investigation showed that considerable air was 
entrapped in this U-tube, which was, therefore, modified to 
give a gradual rise or slope to the line thus* preventing any 
entrapment of air in this section of the machine. Calculated 
milk holding times could then be varied within the range 
15-16 seconds. 

(2) Air Pockets 

The plate heat-exchanger and pipeline accessories other 
than the holding tube also offer many possibilities for 
entrapping air. It seems probable that air locks ma}^ influence 
the non-holding pasteurizing time in a manner similar to 
their effect in the holding tube. This aspect of the problem 
of HTST pasteurization was investigated further by making 
temperature measurements with thermocouples at the edges of 
the plates. Whenever the liquid entered the plate section 
at the top, it appeared that air would rise and block off a 
section of the plate to the downward flowing liquid* Thus, 
a portion of the plate w^ould be considerably higher in 
temperature because of the lack of circulation. This was 
shown by observing temperature differences across the plates 
of as high as 3$°F* When the liquid entered the plate 
section at the bottom then no air pocket would accumulate 
because the rising liquid would force the air out of the 
section. Evidence of this was indicated b^r temperature measure 
ments being the same at selected points across the plates.

Figure 2 illustrates the deposit of milk stone, etc., 
that accumulated on the first two plates, first pass, in the 
heater section. This accumulation was allowed to gather over 
a considerable period of time using plate arrangement B. 

An examination of the plates clearly establishes two areas; 
the area of deposit and the relatively clean area probably 
produced by the turbulence of the flowing liquid. Thus a 
relatively quiescent pocket is established in this particular 
section of the pasteurizer. It is believed that, when the 
pasteurizer is operated on milk, this area is occupied by 
a foam and, thus, the excessive heat would cause the TT baking 
on TT of milk solids, resulting in the diagram displayed on 
the photographed plates. 

(3) Leak Through Flow Diversion Valve 

The Taylor Flow Diversion valve, model 39VJI, with which 
this pasteurizer is equipped, has a milk-tight but ungasketed 
diversion port. During the course of the trials water 
leakage past this port w r a& observed to be as high as 2.5$ of 
the total flow. This leakage was collected and added to the 
regular flow in all w 7 ater flow-rate measurements. No leakage 
was observed when milk was being pasteurized. 

(4) Time Required to Stabilize 

When the pasteurizer was operated on water it was 
observed that there was a gradual decrease in the capacitv 
until a point of stability was reached. This is shown by 
the following typical results of changing flow rates observed

Therefore, the pasteurizer was operated for a period of time 
not less than 30 minutes, before any timing measurements were 
made. No attempt was made to determine the cause of this 
diminishing rate of flow. 

(5) Pumping Difficulties 

The Waukesha positive displacement pump provided with 
the HTST pasteurizer presented many difficulties in pumping. 
However, after several rearrangements of the plates, many 
of the earlier observed difficulties were overcome. Since 
air leaks on the suction side had a marked effect on pumping 
efficiency it became necessa^ to prime the pump whenever 
a tria.l was started. Once the seals of the pump became wet 
priming was not always necessary. Pressure measurements 
made during operation indicated the pump was operating under 
a head pressure of from 5-6 lbs. -while the suction pressure 
was so small that measurements were not possible with the gauges 
used.

(6) Holding Time on Diverted Flow 

Some HTST pasteurizers are equipped with a restrictor 
fitting in the diversion line. The purpose of this restrictor 
fitting is to maintain an equal head pressure during the 
operation of the pasteurizer in either forward or diverted 
flow thereby preventing reduction in the holding time. The 
machine under study was not equipped with a restrictor 
fitting and thus holding times for forward and diverted flows 
differed. The following results, made during a normal opera¬ 
tion, indicate that the water holding time on diverted flow 
is approximately 2 seconds less than the normal holding time 
in the pasteurizer under observation.

(b) Water and Milk Flow Rates 

During the course of the study comparative flow rates 
with water and milk were recorded on all trials. The milk 
flow-rate, for each trial, was made at the same pump setting 
as that for the water. The rates of flow were obtained in 
pounds per hour and then converted to gallons per hour. This 
procedure eliminates any difference in capacity due to the 
greater density of milk. Since approximately 75 trials were

completed, no attempt is made here to report all the data. 
However, in no trial was the milk flow less than the water 
flow. The lowest increase in milk flow was 3*7$ while the 
highest was 21.1$. This would seem to compare favorably 
with the results of Weber (1947) who reports increases of 
milk over water of from 0 to 25$. 

The fact that the speed of the pump influences the milk- 
water ratio is indicated by Table 1. These data are from 
the trials with plate arrangement A and indicate that at high 
pump speeds the percent increase is low, e.g., 5.1$, while 
at very low speeds the percent increase is high, e.g., 17.1$* 
The reason for such variability has already been explained 
on the differences in viscosity of the two liquids. 

The percent increase in milk flow is not constant when 
the pump is set at any particular capacity on water. The 
data reported in Table 2 were made with plate arrangement B 
and an attempt was made to operate the pump at the same water 
capacity throughout. Increases ranged from as 1ow t as 10.4$ 
to as high as 21.1$. Since the pump speed was not altered 
and since the same relative viscosity difference would remain 
fairly constant, it is evident that other factors must also 
affect the ratio. Weber attributes such variations to several 
factors. Firstly, variations in line voltage will affect 
pump speed and thhs vary the ratio. Secondly the pressure 
on the plates will affect the load on the pump. However, in

these trials the plate pressure was not varied once the pump 
was operating at the desired w r ater capacity. Thirdly, air 
leaks on the suction side of the pump will cause changes in 
capacity. It is believed that these air leaks, particularly 
at the gasketed edges of the plates, were the major factor 
in varying the milk and water flow ratio. This factor may 
be magnified in pasteurizers of small capacitor because gasket 
length per unit volume of liquid is greater. 

(c) Internal Temperature and Time Measurements 

In the interpretation of pasteurization efficiency of 
commercial HTST plants it is important to bear in mind that 
the milk is held at a lethal temperature for an appreciably 
longer period than is indicated by the holding time. Thus a 
margin of safety is provided which is of variable magnitude 
depending upon the particular characteristics of the 
pasteurizing unit. In order to determine times at lethal 
temperatures in the unit under study, thermocouples were 
carefully inserted between the plates and observed EMF readings 
were converted to °F. However, the plate arrangement for the 
machine was altered during the course of the observations, 
to obviate pumping difficulties. Therefore, measurements 
are presented here for both plate arrangements A and B.

plate arrangement B. The overall changes resulted in a 
smaller regenerative section and larger heater section in 
the B arrangement. 

Thermocouple measurements were made on both milk and 
water and no internal temperature differences were measurable, 
i.e., the point where the medium reached 160°F. was essentially 
the same for water as for milk. However, timing measurements 
had to be made on water and the water-milk ratio was used to 
calculate the corresponding data for milk. 

The two points of particular interest were 140°F. and 
loO°F. When these were determined, timing measurements at 
various locations throughout the pasteurizer were obtained 
and are summarized in Table 3* 

The calculated milk times contained in Table 3 were 
used for' constructing the flow diagrams illustrated in 
Figures 5 and 6. The slight differences are caused by the 
rearrangement of the plates. It should be noted that straight- 
line heating and cooling takes place in the regenerative 
section but the heating of the milk in the heating section 
is logarithmic. However, the important observation from these 
figures is that the so-called holding time of the pasteurizer 
studied represents only about 50% of the control time or 
actual time at the high temperature.. It may be seen that the 
milk in this particular unit is held at 160°F. for 26-27 
seconds which is in close agreement with results reported by

Rowlands (1950). Thus there seems to be a considerable 
factor of safety over and above the timing requirement of 
15 seconds holding. 

The conditions of heat-treatment with plate arrangement 
B are indicated in Table 4, the only variable being the 
pipeline time which was purposely varied in order to get 
several different heat-treatments. Therefore, the exact 
conditions of heat-treatment are known for each thermal 
effect studied. However, the lethality of the process, as 
indicated by phosphatase destruction, will also be affected 
by the short heating-up and cooling periods. An analysis of 
these two, thus, becomes necessary and is included in a later 
section. 

(d) Inactivation of Phosphatase 

(1) Rate of Destruction of Phosphatase 

If the rate of destruction of phosphatase in milk is 
a first order reaction as indicated by Van Bever and Straub 
(1943) then a plot of the logarithms of the concentration 
against times at any particular temperature should yield a 
straight line. To determine the characteristics of this 
destruction, various lots of milk were heat-treated in the 
pasteurizer under varying conditions of time. Samples taken 
at various temperatures were analysed for phosphatase activity.

However, only the results for two temperatures are reported 
here since other temperatures bear less relationship to the 
temperature of HTST pasteurization. Results for 15$.5°F. and 
160.1°F. are reported in Table 5 and are plotted in a semi- 
logarithmic manner in Figure 7. The inconsistency of the 
results to form a perfect curve may, in part, be accounted 
for by the fact that each observation for any one temperature 
was made on a different lot of milk. However, from the results 
shawn in Figure 7, it appears that as the destruction of 
phosphatase proceeded, the rate of destruction at constant 
temperature is very rapid at first and diminishes to a 
relatively very slow rate. This conforms to observations by 
Sanders and Sager (194$) and Hetrick and Tracy (194$) who 
report a similar deviation from a semi-logarithmic relation- 
ship. 

Further observations on the characteristics of phosphatase 
destruction were determined by heat-treating milk in the 
pasteurizer under varying conditions of temperature but 
relatively constant time. The first observations were made 
with plate arrangement A and the results of phosphatase des¬ 
truction are reported in Table 6. When the apparatus was 
altered to plate arrangement B the experiments on destruction 
of phosphatase were repeated and are reported in Table 7. 

In Figures $ and 9, the temperatures and average phos¬ 
phatase values of Tables 6 and 7 are shown plotted on the

arithmetic and logarithmic scales respectively. The curves 
in both figures deviate from a straight-line course in a 
direction that indicates a marked decrease in the rate of 
inactivation as the temperature is increased, i. e., the rate 
of destruction of the enz3nme by heat is most rapid at first 
but diminishes greatly as the concentration of active enzyme 
is reduced. 

The curves in Figures $ and 9 both show the deviation at 
a temperature of approximately 15$.5°F. At temperatures 
below this there is considerable similarity between them. At 
the temperature of 15$.5°F. the concentration of residual 
phosphatase is 0.$ units/0.5 ml milk in Figure $ and 0.9 units/ 
0.5 ml milk in Figure 9. Assuming an original raw milk 
concentration of 1000 units/0.5 ml milk, which is approximately 
the concentration according to Sanders and Sager (194$), 
these degrees of destruction would represent 99*92% and 99.91% 
respectively. This represents a destruction considerab^ 
greater than the 99*6 %o used by Andersen (1949) or Kay and 
Graham (1935), who thus, would not encounter the deviation 
from the straight line course of destruction. 

When 2 units of phosphatase/0.5 ml milk are considered 
the end-point, then inactivation is attained at 157.7°F. for 
both plate arrangements. This point is examined further in 
another section of this report. However, from this observation 
it appears that the pasteurizer, when operating at l6l°F. 
and 15 seconds holding time, must provide a thermal treatment 
considerably above that necessary to inactivate phosphatase 
to the degree called for by the Official Test. Thus the

holding time must only be a portion of the control time or 
actual time of heat treatment. On analysing the holding 
conditions throughout the thermal process this is confirmed.

This is presented as further evidence that the holding time 
is only a portion of the actual time at the higher temperature. 
The phosphatase test, of course, is a measure of the total 
thermal treatment and thus with a control time of approxi¬ 
mately 2? seconds it is expected that the desired inactivation 
to 2 units/0.5 ml milk would be attained at approximately 
157.7°F. 

(2) The Required Temperature-Time Combination 

The results obtained on the rate of phosphatase des¬ 
truction indicated that inactivation to 2 units/0.5 ml milk 
was reached at a temperature between 157° to 15$°F., when the

holding time in the pasteurizer under study is 15 seconds. 

This temperature was verified by heat-treating each of 2 
milks over the very narrow temperature range 157*3° to 
153.1°F. The ternperature was slowly raised through this 
range, samples for phosphatase tests being taken at regular 
intervals, and then lowered and the procedure was repeated. 

The results are reported in Table 3 and Figure 10 which shows 
inactivation at 157*6°F. The holding times in this series were 
in the range 16.19 to 16.23 seconds which is slightly longer 
than the previously reported average holding time of 15*57 
seconds for 10 trials. From this observation it appears that 
when the pasteurizer is operated at a temperature of l60°- 
l6l°F. and a holding time of 15-16 seconds, as called for 
by different regulations, a considerable margin of safety is 
provided when reliance is placed on the phosphatase test. 

To further illustrate the effect of heat-treatment on 
milk phosphatase the speed of the pasteurizer pump was increased 
to give various capacities above the normal capacity which 
gave a holding time of 15 seconds. The results of these 
flow-rate increases are recorded in Table 9 and Figure 11 and 
they show that inactivation was effected at a temperature 
of 159*7°F., when the holding time was only 10.35 seconds, 
i.e., the capacity of the pasteurizer could be increased 
60% and still produce phosphatase negative milk. This ob¬ 
servation not only lends weight to the accumulating evidence

that the so-called holding time is only a fraction of the 
total inactivating time but engenders greater confidence in 
this method of pasteurization. 

In order to appreciate the thermal effect of the 
pasteurizer on milk phosphatase it is necessary to know the 
heat stability characteristics of the enzyme, in the range of 
HT3T pasteurization. This problem was investigated by 
modifying the pasteurizer as previously noted. The shortest 
thermal treatment possible was provided by assembling a 
pipeline which lead directly from the outlet of the heater 
section to the inlet of the regenerative section. Then, in 
order to get varying conditions of time, this pipeline was 
increased. In all, seven different pipelines were assembled 
while the other conditions of heat-treatment were as heretofore 
noted. These pipelines provided control times of from 10.9 
to 79*2 seconds. The effect of varying control time is 
indicated in Table 10, the units of phosphatase indicating the 
amount of active phosphatase present after the particular 
heat-treatment. 

Since 2 units of phosphatase/0.5 ml milk represent 
phosphatase inactivation, the data in Table 10 were analysed 
to determine the conditions necessary for this destruction. 
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 11 contain the experimental measure¬ 
ments of the control time and temperature respectively at

which the phosphatase was inactivated to the required end 
point. However, the control time does not measure the inacti¬ 
vating effect of the heating-up and cooling intervals. The 
inactivating effect of these intervals was calculated by the 
method proposed by Ball (1943) and the results are shown in 
columns 4 and 5 of Table 11. The following equation, which 
is applicable to a semi-logarithmic heating rate and straight 
line cooling rate, was employed in this calculation:

HT in seconds. 

U = time necessary to inactivate phosphatase at 
holding temperature in seconds. 

B and A c = arbitrary constants. 

tgs = time consumed in rise of temperature of milk 
in seconds. 

HT = holding temperatures of pasteurization process.

The second and third terms in the right hand member of the 
equation express as equivalents the inactivating value of the 
heating-up and cooling intervals. Equivalent means the seconds 
of holding at the control temperature, HT, which would have 
the same inactivating effect.

In the application of this procedure to the sterilization 
of canned foods Ball uses the temperature of 170°F., which 
is 30°F. below the retort temperature, as the minimum lethal 
temperature. He stresses that a temperature having lethal 
effect should be selected, but it should be so chosen that 
only an insignificant lethal effect.will occur at temperatures 
below it. In applying the method to the data of this investi¬ 
gation, the minimum holding temperature for LTLT pasteurization, 
143°B., was selected as the initial and final temperature, 
as it satisfied these conditions. Arbitrary constants used 
in the equation were chosen according to the procedure outlined 
by Ball. The intervals tgg and t c ^ were measured on an 
enlargement of the heating-up and cooling divisions of 
Figure 6. 

The heating-up equivalents for the intervals between 
143°B. and the various inactivation temperatures, as tabulated 
in Table 11, illustrate clearly the importance of these 
intervals as the inactivation temperature approaches the 
region of HTST pasteurization. It is evident that at high 
temperatures, where the treatment time is short, the heating- 
up equivalent may account for a large percentage of the lethal 
or inactivating effect. The equivalent of the cooling 
interval indicates that its inactivating effect is of much 
less significance than that of the heating equivalent and also 

f 

that its magnitude is quite uniform between 160.7°F. and 153* 3°B*

The uniformity of the cooling equivalent in this narrow 
temperature range is understandable when the interval, only 
approximately one second because of the rapid straight line 
cooling, is considered. The summation of the control time 
and the heating-up and cooling equivalents is the inactivation 
time for each inactivation temperature. The values in the 
last column of Table 11 represent the inactivation time, at 
each temperature, if the heating-up and cooling were instan¬ 
taneous. They are the values of U for each inactivation 
temperature. 

In Figure 12, the U values are plotted on semi-logarithmic 
scale. The equation for this inactivation curve is:- 
T = 171.84 - 9.66 log t 
where T = temperature in °F. and 
t = time in seconds. 

The Z value is 9-7°F. In Figure 13 this curve is shown by 
line A and is compared with curve B which is based on the 
control time only at each inactivation temperature and thus 
excludes the heating-up and cooling periods. Curve B is 
also a best fit line with the equation T = 170.47 - 8.89 log t 
and has a Z value of $.9°F. These curves illustrate clearly 
the effect of the addition of the heating-up and cooling 
equivalents in the calculation of a phosphatase inactivation 


curve.

The straight-line course, as indicated in Figure 13, of 
the temperature-time inactivation curves conforms with results 
obtained by Sanders and Sager (194$). Holland and Dahlberg 
(1940), Kay and Graham (1935)? Lear and Foster (1949) and 
Hetrick and Tracy (194$) also report a similar straight-line 
inactivation curve. The Z values for the curves produced 
by these various authors establishes a range of from 8.2$ 0 F 0 
to 9°F. with Kay and Graham ! s the only deviation at Z = 

11.7°F. 

The 16. $ seconds required at 160°F. for inactivation 
is considerably less than that reported by several of the 
above mentioned authors. Most of the differences can be 
accounted for by the methods of analysis, the apparatus 
employed and the end point used to indicate inactivation. 
However, since Sanders and Sager employed similar methods of 
analysis and the same end point then some uniformity should 
exist. The fact that they require 24 seconds for inactivation 
at 160°F. is hardly in agreement with the 16.S seconds esta¬ 
blished by this investigation. If an end point of 2 units 
of phosphatase/0.5 ml milk is used in the analysis of Hetrick 
and Tracy T s (194$) results then approximately 15 seconds 
are required at 160°F. to produce the desired inactivation. 

In Table 12 the percentage values of the inactivation 
effect of heating-up and cooling are summarized. These 
values were obtained b}r applying the following equations:-

The data reported in Tables 6 and 7 were obtained under 
relatively similar conditions of heat treatment. Therefore, 
these 16 trials were each anal 3 ^sed for the temperature 
necessary to provide the desired inactivation. The last 
columns in Tables 6 and 7 contain the required, inactivation 
temperatures for each trial. An analysis of these tem¬

(e) Impairment of Creaming 

(1) Rate of Destruction of Creaming Property 

In order to determine the rate of cream volume destruc¬ 
tion, under the conditions of plate arrangement A, the 
impairment of creaming was measured in the temperature range 
155.£°F.-l64.9°F. These measurements are reported in Table 
13 where the creaming indexes for a series of trials with a 
holding time of 15 seconds are shown. For purposes of 
illustration the averages of the results are plotted graphi¬ 
cally in Figure 14 which shows the decrease in creaming 
indexes. In this figure lines A and B represent 1 and 2 
percent reductions in cream volume respectively.

The results show that there is a gradual decrease in 
the creaming index starting at the lowest temperature, 155*^°F. 
At 157*5°F. the cream volume has been reduced 1% and a cream 
volume reduction to a level of 2 % does not take place until 
160.1°F. is reached. However, it is doubtful if a cream 
volume reduction of 1 to 2 percent is commercially signifi¬ 
cant, According to Millenky and Bruechner (1941) a 2% 
reduction is insignificant commercially Mien 4 % milk was 
compared in American quart bottles. Marquardt and Dahlberg 
(1931) report that a 0.2 change in the creaming index is 
significant for experimental conditions. Holland and Dahlberg 
(1940) used an end point of 1% change in the cream volume. 
However, they stress that such a change would not be detect¬ 
able by the consumer. 

The nature of the curve in Figure 14 seemed to indicate 
that the rate of destruction of creaming property, as:illust¬ 
rated by the creaming indexes, does not decrease at a constant 
rate. Therefore, the data used to construct Figure 14 were 
plotted on semi-logarithmic paper and the resulting curve is 
shown in Figure 15. With the exception of 155*$°F., the 
changes in creaming indexes form a straight line relationship 
with changing temperatures, when the holding time is 15 seconds. 

The small change at 155.£°F. may have been due to factors 
other than heat affecting the creaming property of the milk.

Between the relatively high temperatures of 156.3°F. and 
I 64 .9°F, the influence of heat, on the destruction of creaming 
property, appears to proceed at a rate comparable to that of 
a monomolecular reaction. 

(2) The Required Temperature-Time Combination 

The impairment of creaming in the temperature range 
of HT3T pasteurization, was investigated at the same time 
as phosphatase was being studied. Thus the pasteurizer 
modifications previously noted are also applicable to the 
data on creaming. The effect of varying control time and 
temperature on the cream volume is indicated in Table 14* 

Since a change of 1% in the cream volume has been chosen to 
indicate significant destruction the data in Table 14 were 
analysed to determine the conditions necessary for this 
destruction. Columns 2 and 3 of Table 15 contain the experi¬ 
mental measurements of the control time and temperature res¬ 
pectively at which the creaming was destroyed to the selected 
end point. However, as already noted under Inactivation of 
Phosphatase, the control time does not measure the inactivating 
or destructive effect of the heating-up and cooling intervals. 
The destructive effect of these intervals on creaming was 
calculated by Ball ! s method (1943) 3 which has already been 
used in reporting phosphatase destruction. The calculated 
results for heating-up and cooling, expressed as equivalents, 
are shown in columns 4 and 5 of Table 15. These equivalents

again illustrate clearly the importance of the heating-up 
and cooling intervals as the temperature approaches the 
region of HTST pasteurization. 

The values in the last column of Table 15 represent 
the destruction times, at each temperature, if the heating- 
up and cooling were instantaneous. They are the values of U 
for each temperature and in Figure 16 these values are 
plotted on semi-logarithmic graph paper. The equation for 
this destruction curve is:- 

T = 174.60 - 12.41 log t 
where T = temperature in °F. and 
t = time in seconds 

The Z value of this curve is 12.4°F. In Figure 17 this curve 
is shown by line A and is compared with curve B which is 
based on the control time only at each destruction temperature 
and thus excludes the heating-up and cooling periods. Curve 
B is also a best fit line with the equation T = 172.93 - 11*49 
log t and has a Z value of 11.5°F. These curves illustrate 
clearly the effect of the addition of the heating-up and 
cooling equivalents in the calculation of a destruction curve. 
Figure 16 establishes that 15-02 seconds are required at 160°F. 
for destruction of creaming property. This is considerably 
less than the following reported observations:- 

Holland and Dahlberg (1940) 24.6 seconds 

Marquardt and Dahlberg (1931) 22.2 seconds 

Dahlberg (1932) 19-8 seconds

DISCUSSION 


HTST pasteurization is enveloped in not a little con¬ 
fusion resulting from ignorance of the precise thermal death 
time of the tubercle organism at the higher temperatures, 

When 160°F. for 15 seconds is adopted as a standard, a 
reasonable factor of safety above the thermal death time of 
M. tuberculosis is presumably included. But there Is still 
a disturbing element of conjecture about the lethal properties 
of heat in relation to the tubercle organism at this tem¬ 
perature. The extent of the supposed factor of safety is, 
therefore, unknown. 

Although a number of investigators have studied phos¬ 
phatase inactivation and destruction of creaming property at 
the higher temperatures, the results are conflicting. Not 
only are different temperature-time combinations reported but 
the Z values of the inactivation and destruction curves vary. 
Most of the studies are based on heat-treatment of milk in 
laboratory apparatus of the immersed coil type which generally 
have several disadvantages. 

The plate-type HTST pasteurizer used in this investigation 
offers certain advantages over the laboratory-type heat- 
exchanger but has the disadvantage of fairly long heating-up 
and cooling periods. This is, however, off-set by the ease 
with which accurate temperature and time measurements may

be made at will at any point throughout the apparatus and 
tends to be minimized if the effect of heating-up and cooling 
can be accurately calculated. Further, this pasteurizer is 
comparable to other larger commercial pasteurizers and, 
therefore, most of the results are probably indicative of 
commercial HTST pasteurization. 

The various sections of the HTST pasteurizer studied 
offer many possibilities for entrapping air. It seems probable 
that these air locks may influence the control time in a 
manner similar to their effect on the holding time. Further, 
the timing of these machines, by the salt conductivity method, 
necessitates measurements being made on water and then cal¬ 
culating the corresponding time for milk by observing the 
milk-water ratio which does:not appear to be constant under 
relatively similar conditions. There is no purpose in specify¬ 
ing a holding time unless it is maintained. Its maintenance 
is assured only if air is not permitted to be entrapped in 
the holding tube. This and other investigations have shown 
that entrapped air not only shortens the holding time but 
gives it an unpredictable variability?-. A sloping holding 
tube can prevent air locks in this section thereby eliminating 
its influence on holding time. This point receives heavy 
emphasis in American control of HTST pasteurization but appears 
to be largely ignored in Canada. It would seem that more 
rigid control of the slope and timing of holding tubes is 
desirable in this country.

The fact that phosphatase is not inactivated at 160°F. 
for 15 seconds while these pasteurizers turn out a phosphatase 
negative milk simply means that the holding time is on\j a 
portion of the total time of heat-treatment at temperatures 
sufficiently high to inactivate the enzyme. The total 
pasteurizing or control time is, therefore, of great im¬ 
portance,. Figures 5 and 6 establish that the holding time 
for the pasteurizer under investigation is only 59.9% and 
56.3%, respectively, of the control time. The phosphatase 
test is a measure of this control time plus the inactivating 
effect of the heating-up and cooling intervals,not a measure 
of the holding time alone. The fact that the holding time 
is only a portion of the control time is further illustrated 
by the fact that the experimental pasteurizer could be 
operated at 60% above its rated capacity.and still produce 
phosphatase negative milk. 

Although fairly sensitive methods of measuring for 
phosphatase have been devised, no comparable method has as 
yet been introduced to determine cream volume impairment. 

The method of measuring cream volumes in graduated cylinders 
offers only a relative comparison to the more accurate pro¬ 
cedure used for phosphatase determinations. However, results 
established by this investigation indicate that destruction 
of creaming property is similar to the effect of heat on 
phosphatase. Therefore, in the range of temperatures employed

in HTST pasteurization, some destructive effect must have been 
contributed by the heating-up and cooling periods in a manner 
similar to their effect on phosphatase* 

In Figure IS curves A and B represent the temperature¬ 
time relationships for phosphatase inactivation and impairment 
of creaming, respectively. These curves indicate that at 
temperatures below 162.2°F. the creaming property of milk is 
destroyed before phosphatase is inactivated and the Z value 
for creaming impairment is greater than the Z value for 
phosphatase inactivation. At l60°F. 16.S seconds are required 
to inactivate phosphatase to the desired end point, while 
15.0 seconds at the same temperature are required for the 
specified impairment of creaming property* These values tend 
to be considerably lower than the corresponding values reported 
in the literature. 

Tables 12 and 16 establish that at the temperature of 

1 

HTST pasteurization considerable heat effect is attributed 
to the heating-up and cooling intervals. For phosphatase 
these intervals combined provided 16.93% of the total 
inactivating time at 160.7°F. and decreases to only O.Sl% 
at 153 o 3°F. For creaming impairment the figures are IS,19% 
at 160.1°F. and 0.96$ at 151.3°F. 

In order to insure a minimum temperature of l6l°F. in 
HTST pasteurization the flow diversion valve is usually set 
to divert when the temperature drops-below l6l.5°F. There¬ 
fore, it is necessary in practice to operate the pasteurizer

sufficiently in excess of this temperature to avoid frequent 
diversion valve operation. At l6l.5°F. the data in Table 17 
show times of 11.7 and 11.3 seconds required for inactivation 
and destruction of phosphatase and creaming property res¬ 
pectively. The control time, symbol G, Figure 6, is 27*7 seconds 
when the holding time is 15.7 seconds. The addition of the 
heating-up and cooling equivalents would give a time of 
approximately 30 seconds at the control temperature, l6l.5°F. 

The HTST pasteurizer studied in this report, therefore, 
provides a heat-treatment considerably in excess of a 
minimum standard of l6l°F. for 15 seconds. 

The weight of evidence presented in this report is, that, 
within the temperature range investigated in the experimental 
pasteurizer, M. tuberculosis would be killed before phos¬ 
phatase is inactivated. Thus, it might appear that the 
phosphatase test is an adequate sole control of the process. 
However, the phosphatase test is insensitive to minute 
amounts of raw milk and its performance should be the 
responsibility of a trained chemist. In consequence, there 
would seem to be good reason for a specified holding time 
of 15 seconds at l6l°F. but little evidence to substantiate 
increasing this to 16 seconds at the same time. 

The fact that creaming oroperty is impaired before 
phosphatase inactivation forces the operator to adopt an 
arbitrary reduction value as being commercially insignificant. 
Such a value will vary with such things as the type and

composition of the product, the market requirements and the 
final container, and can be determined only by the trial 
and error method. The problem,is, therefore, complex and 
it is doubtful if it can be used as a satisfactory field 
control of HTST pasteurization. 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


As a result of this study the following conclusions 

apply to the pasteurizer studied: 

1, When the HTST pasteurizer was operated under conditions 
giving 15.6 seconds holding time phosphatase was in¬ 
activated at 157.7°F. Increasing the capacity 60% 

'1 1 ?s ]: 

still produced phosphatase negative milk when operating 
at 160°F. 

2 , The thermal treatment provided by the holding tube in 
the HTST pasteurizer studied is only approximately 
50% of the total thermal treatment provided. 

3, The Z value of the phosphatase inactivation curve, 
including the evaluation of the effect of the heating- 
up and cooling intervals, is 9*7°F. which is outside the 
range of Z values previously reported. Exclusive of 
this effect the Z value is $.9°F. which is within the 
range of those Z values previously reported.

4. Phosphatase cannot be inactivated without an accompanying 
creaming impairment. Inactivation can be effected, 
however, without a creaming loss that is commercially 
prohibitive. 

5. The Z value of the impairment of creaming curve, in¬ 
cluding the evaluation of the effect of the heating-up 
and cooling intervals, is 12.4°F. Exclusive of this 
effect the Z value is 11.5°P. 

6. At l6l°F., the present legal minimum for HTST pasteuri¬ 
zation in seven Canadian provinces, phosphatase is 
inactivated in 13.3 seconds while the cream volume is 
impaired in 12.3 seconds. At 160°F. the corresponding 
times are 16.& seconds and 15*0 seconds. 

7. (a) The heating-up interval from 143°F. to 160°F. is 
3.4 seconds. The thermal effect of this interval on 
phosphatase inactivation is equivalent to 2.0 seconds at 
160°F. and it accounts for 12.16 percent of the inacti¬ 
vation time at this temperature. At 152°F. the equivalent 
effect of the heating-up interval is 0.4 seconds and 

this represents only 0.4 percent of the inactivation 
time. 

(b) For impairment of creaming the heating-up interval 
to 160°F. is equivalent to 2.2 seconds and it accounts 
for 14.66$ of the destruction time at this temperature.

At 152°F. the corresponding data are 0.44 seconds and 
0.7 percent. 

$. (a) For phosphatase inactivation the cooling interval 

from 160°F. to 143°F. is the equivalent of 0.19 seconds 
at 160°F. accounting for only 1.1$ percent of the 
inactivating time at this temperature. At 152°F. the 
equivalent effect of the cooling interval is 0.1$ 
seconds and this represents only 0.2 percent of the 
inactivation time. 

(b) For impairment of creaming this interval is equi¬ 
valent to 0.3 seconds at 160°F. and it accounts for only 
1.64 percent of the destruction time at this temperature. 

At 152°F. the corresponding data are 0.3 seconds and 
0.4 percent. 

9. Entrapped air in the holding tube leads to varied but 
shortened holding times. 

10. Since the water-milk ratio is not constant under relatively 
similar conditions, it is necessary to determine the 

ratio for each trial when calculating milk holding times 
from the corresponding water measurements determined by 
the salt conductivity method. 

11. There are objections to the use of the phosphatase test 
as the sole field control of HTST pasteurization. 

There appears to be justification for a specified minimum
