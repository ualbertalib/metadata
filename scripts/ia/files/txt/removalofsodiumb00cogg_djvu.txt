THE REMOVAL OF SODIUM BICARBONATE 


FROM ALBERTA WATERS 








- 1 - 

DISCUSSION 

In the Province of Alberta there is a great variation in 
the composition of naturally occurring waters* Total dissolved 
solids range from 100 ppm* to over 2000 ppm» Generally speaking 
waters from deep wells are high in dissolved solids^ whilst 
surface waters have a low dissolved solids content. Waters from 
deep wells differ from one another in the type of dissolved 
material in different parts of the Province depending on the 
strata through which they have percolated. 

In some regions the waters are high in calcium, sulfate, 
magnesiiM, and bicarbonate ions, whilst in other districts the 
ions predominating are sodium, bicarbonate, chloride, and sulfate 
Waters of the latter type are found from aS far north as 
Edmonton and extend to the southern boundary of the Province# 

The outstanding features of these waters are high alkalinity, 
high pH, and low hardness. They are generally referred to as 
sodium bicarbonate or soda waters# 

Sodi\im bicarbonate waters have an unpleasant taste 
typical of baking soda. They attack such metals as zinc, tin, 
and aluminum, so that utensils made from galvanized iron, tin 
plate, and aluminum are rapidly corroded. In addition there 
have been reports of harmful physiological effects on humans 
and animals following the repeated ingestion of these waters, 

* ppm = parts per million parts of water.

From the standpoint of communities where sodium bicarb- 
onete waters are the principal sources of water supply^ the 
presentation of a means for the removal of the offending ion or 
ions would be of great service. The deleterious properties of 
such waters are chiefly due to the presence of the bicarbonate 
ion^ so it is this ion which should be removed* The object of 
this research is to study the properties of these waters and 
attempt to devise some simple means for the removal of the 
bicarbonate ion* The method presented should be such that no 
technical knowledge or skill is required and that no special 
equipment is needed. 

Considerable research has been carried out in the past 
on the effect of sodium bicarbonate ingestion. A brief review 
of the effects reported in the literature is presented here. 


A 


Physiological Effects of^Sodium Bicarl^nat^, 

Levison (23) reports that large or repeated doses of 
sodium bicarbonate daily may cause an increase in the body 
weight due to retention of chlorides and water in the body which 
may go on to the appear€ince of edema, even in normal persons* 
According to Polland (34)j ingested sodium bicarbonate increases 
the urea excretion by the kidneys* Hertz and Goldberg (14) 
report that sodium bicarbonate causes a marked decrease in the 
chloride ion concentration of the urine within one half hour*

They suggest that the retention of chloride by the organism 
under the influence of sodium bicarbonate depends on the direct 
action of sodium bicarbonate on the kidneys and a temporary 
impairment of their function* LeNoir, and Verpy (20), (21), 

and (22), report that sodixam bicarbonate will retard renal 
excretion in both normal and pathological kidneys* 

Widal, Lemierre, and Cotoni (40), and Labbe and 
Guerithault (19), present evidence of ed©iia in diabetics due 
to a retention of both sodium and chloride ions during sodium 
bicarbonate feeding* Mosenthal and Killian (27) report that 
sodium bicarbonate administered by mouth will cause a decrease 
in the acetone bodies in the blood of diabetes mellitis victims, 
accompanied by an increase in the carbon dioxide combining power 
and a decrease in the concentration of blood sugar* They report 
an initial rise in the concentration of acetone bodies in the 
urine and a decreased excretion of sugar* Hubbard and Wright (15) 
substantiate these observations and claim that not only is there 
a sweeping out of acetone bodies present in the blood, but also 
an Increased production of new ones* 

Nobuo Matsuoka and K Daita (24) noted that the chloride 
content of the whole blood increases and that of blood plasma 
decreases after the administration of sodium bicarbonate, 

Neuschloss and Planas (32) found that sodium bicarbonate caused

a protracted rise in the alkali reserve causing an alkaline urine. 
Arnold! and Benett (4) say that small doses of sodium bicarbonate 
change the pH of the blood after a short time although Reimann 
and Reimann (35) found that the blood bicarbonate itself remained 
close to the theoretical amoimt and noted that the deviation of 
the observed from the calcinated was greater during disease^ 

Cmunt (8) reports that small doses of sodium bicarbonate 
decrease the viscosity of rabbits blood whilst large doses 
cause a large increase in the viscosity in one to two hours 
followed by a gradual return to normal when the bicarbonate 
feeding is discontinued. He thought the influence of sodium 
bicarbonate on the colloidal condition of the blood played a 
part in the production of these effects. 

King and Hanford (17) conducted a series of experiments 

with dogs treated by the Pavlov method, and found that 1% 

sodium bicarbonate will excite gastric excretion in water starved 

free 

dogs, but less excretion than water, The/acidity of the alkali 
gastric Juice is less than that of the water Juice, although 
it is not different if the alkali is fed with meals or during 
digestion. Bennett (5) found that sodium bicarbonate excited 
the gastric mucosa causing increased secretion and the effect 
more than counterbalanced the neutralizing action of the salt. 
Keefer and Bloomfield (16) reported that the alkali did

neutralize the gastric juice without changing the total volume, 
but said th*at free acid reappeared, the time depending on the 
motility of the stomach, and that the alkali did not affect the 
motility of the stomach» Ghildrey, Alvarez, and Mann (7) claim 
that sodium bicarbonate interferes with digestion causing a 
decreased efficiency, 

Dickson and Wilson (10) found that very large doses of 
sodium bicarbonate inhibit gastric peristalsis , possibly due 
to changes in the tension of carbon dioxide in the arterial 
blood. Young (42) and Melnikov (26) report that small doses 
of sodium bicarbonate increase the tone of the small intestinal 
movement without altering the pendulum motion, although larger 
doses inhibit the movement» The electric excitement on the vagi 
after introduction of moderate doses of sodium bicarbonate has 
a positive effect, whereas large doses paralyze them. Sometimes 
sodium bicarbonate reverses the inhibiting action of the vagi® 
Stohr (39) found that small amounts of sodium bicarbonate will 
mobilize liver glycogen and leave muscle glycogen unaffected. 

The mobilization of liver glycogen and consequent formation of 
lactic acid, he considered to be a defensive reaction against 
alkalosis evident from the high alkali reserve, and so he 
thought that acid-base balance may be regulated by breakdown of 
carbohydrate ®

Wiley, Wiley, and Waller (41) fo\ind that daily ingestion 
of sodium bicarbonate produced a marked decrease in ammonia 
formation during the metabolism of inorganic salts, and caused 
a negative sodium balance* Haldane, Wigglesworth, and Woodrow (12) 
report that sodium bicarbonate deranges carbohydrate metabolism 
and gives rise to ac^ionuria, low respirator^’’ coefficient, 
slightly increased blood sugar, conversion of blood sugar to an 
isomer more dextro-rotatory’’ than dextrose, and after administration 
of less than one half of the normally tolerated dose of dextrose 
produces hyperglycemia and glucosuria. Sodium bicarbonate is 
also reported by the same authors to increase the consumption 
of oxygen®

Mattick and Wright (25) studied the influence of several 
salts on the yield and composition of milk* The salts studied 
included sodium bicarbonate which was found to lower the plasma 
calcium content of the milk when administered in large oral doses, 
although the general composition of the milk is not altered, 

Delaplane (9) found that sodium bicarbonate fed. continually 
at the rate of 3 to 3«3/o of the feed, or 1,6 to 2,0^ of the 
drinking water produced similar lesionsjto those in natural cases' 
of gout in chickens,

The bicarbonate ion then undergoes a further ionization into , 
hydrogen ion and carbonate ion; 

HCOj" H* + 003° 

Thus, there is production of free hydrogen ion in solution* 

Corrosion in much more rapid in acidic solution than in 
neutreil or basic solution. Corrosion in acidic solution is usually 
characterized by liberation of hydrogen gas from the surface 
of the metal being corroded. 

Aluminum, zinc, and tin are three metals which are 
considered to have a high resistance to corrosion by waters. 

For this reason they are widely used in the manufacture of 
cooking utensils, pails, tmiks, etc. in the form of aluminum 
metal, galvanized iron, and tin plate. 

All metals v/hen placed in solutions have a definite 
inherent tendency to go into solution in the form of ions, but 
since the solution must remain electrically^ neutral this can 
happen only if an equivalent number of positive ions from the 
solution are removed. In the case of bicarbonate solutions 
the hydrogen ion is available to re^t ,

A film of hydrogen forms on the surfacej and in acidic solutions 
is removed by the combination of hydrogen atoms into molecules 
of hydrogen gaS which are liberated as bubbles* 

H + H H2 

The removal of this polarizing film of hydrogen exposes more of 
the metallic surface, and thus the corrosion proceeds* 

In the cases of galvanized iron and tin plate, still 
another factor accelerates the corrosion reaction,- this is the 
galvanic effect. As the zinc or tin wears away, the iron becomes 
exposed to the solution and starts to corrode; 

Fe + 2 H'* +-+ Fe*^ + 2 H 

The difference in potential between the iron and the zinc or tin 
sets up a small galvonic cell and the flow of current from the 
anode (mor® corx*odible) to the cathode (less corrodible) accelerates 
corrosion locally. This local corrosion causes pitting and soon 
wears out the utensils. 

Because of the corrosive effect of the soda waters, 
aluminum, galvanized iron, and tin plate are of little value, 
and utensils made from these materials last only a few months. 

For reasonable service in such waters, vessels made from copper 
and enamelware must be used, and these are comparatively 
expensive.

Removal of^Sodiiom Bicarbonate from_Water^ 


The properties of sodium bicarbonate are such that 
its removal from a water supply might be possible by utilizing 
one of the following methods. 

(i) Use of Limes 

The use of lime for the softening of water is well 
known. Its use for the removal of sodium bicarbonate is based 
on the following reactions: 


CaO + H^O Ga( 0 H )2 (l) 

When calcium oxide is added to water, it takes on water and forms 
the hydroxide , and this readtion (l) is known as slaking, the 
product being slaked lime. For our purposes, lime, slaked lime, 
or lime water may be used. The second reaction takes place 
when the slaked lime comes in contact with the sodium bicarbonate 
solution. 


CsXOH)^ + 2NaHC0^ 2NaOH Ca(HC 03)2 (2) 

On standing, reaction (3) takes place, and it is the most 
important since 'it brings about the removal of the bicarbonate 
radical, 

Ca(HC03)2 CaC03 + H^O CO 2 T (3) 

The calcium carbonate should precipitate out, the carbon 
dioxide be liberated as a gas» The decomposition of calcium 
bicarbonate is fairly slow but may be hastened by agitation, 


especially In the presence of calcium carbonate nuclei.

Calcium carbonate haa a very low solubility in water as 
shown by Table I (6) where it is compared with barium carbonate*

One can see that the solubility of Calcium carbonate is 


so low in both hot and cold water, that the amount remaining 


would offer no problem from the standpoint of hardness# 


The amount of lime required can be calculated from the 


reaction equations?

2NaHC03 + CaO + H -0 ^ Ca(HC 03)2 + 2 NaOH

Therefore, for each 1 ppm of sodium bicarbonate in the water, 
one would require (56/168) m of CaO per litre.

(ii) Neutralization by Acid; 


Sodium bicarbonate can be removed from solution by 
simple neutralization with acid^ but this method has the 
disadvantage of introducing an acid anion into solution wliich 
in many cases is even less desirable than the bicarbonate 
radical itself. For example; 

NaHC 03 + HGl “»• NaCl H 2 C + CQ2 
2 NaHC 03 + H2S0^ Nao SO/, ^ 2B20 + 2 CO 2 

It may be seen above that although the bicarbonate is removed^ 
an equivalent quantity of chloride or sulfate ion is left in 
solution, 

(iii) Ion Exchange; 

Ion exchange may be regarded as a process of double 
decomposition wherein all the salts of the cation exchanger 
including those of the alkali metals, and all the salts of the 
anion exchanger, including those of the strong mineral acids, 
are insoluble and filterable,. If the cation exchanger reacts 
with a metal hydroxide, or the anion exchanger reacts with a 
mineral acid, the process may be regarded as simple neutralization 
where the salts foimed are insoluble and filterable. Thus, the 
cation exchanger is an insoluble acid, and the anion exchanger is 
an insoluble base, 

Myers, Eastes, and Urquhart (31) have shown that 
synthetic resin cation and anion exchangers exhibit typical 
Freundlich adsorption isotherms in contact with acids and

salts. The adsorption which takes place may be regarded as 
an example of chromatographic adsorption. Preferential adsorption 
phenomena are fairly common^ and are often accompanied by 
visual banding. In the case of anion exchangers^ the most 
highly ionized are preferentially adsorbed. The affinity of 
cation exchangers appears to be dependent upon valence and 
size of the individual cations and it is hard to predict which 
cation will be preferentially adsorbed, 

Myers and Eastes ( 29 ) in a paper on the use of synthetic 
resins for water purification, say that inorganic salts in 
solution can be converted to their corresponding mineral acids 
by replacement of the metal cation by hydrogen ion and this is 
done using one of the cation exchangers9 Myers, Eastes and 
Myers ( 30 ) report that resins made by the condensation of 
monohydric or polyhydric phenols with formaldehyde will produce 
cation exchange resins, but only the catechol t3rpe will exchange 
calcium ion. Gels m^de from tannin and formaldehyde have base 
exchange properties. Calcium ions are exchanged for sodium and 
hydrogen ions in simple phenolic resins at the phenolic hydroxyl 
groups. Exchange capacity is increased when strongly acidic 
groups such as alkyl or aryl sulfonic acids are incorporated 
into the resin lattice. Cation exchangers depend on the presence 
of aCidic groups which ’’split* salts in solution to form salts

of the cation exchanger and produce free acids in solution. The 
degree of splitting depends on three factors; 5 the strength of 
the acidic groups contained in the exchanger; the concentration 
of the salt in solution; the strength of the acid corresponding 
to the salt being split* Myers and Eastes ( 29 ) found the 
capacity of the cation exchangers to be independent of the 
particle size and the hardness of the water, and to be constant 
over long periods of repeated use. 

Anion adsorbents may be prepared ( 30 ) by the condensation 
of aromatic amines with aldehydes or monosaccharides; or by 
the condensation of aliphatic polyamines with polyhalogen 
derivatives of hydrocarbons. The name,anion exchangers,for this 
type of resin is a misnomer as it has been shown that they are 
feally acid^adsorbents• eg, 

2 RX + H2SO4 “»■ (RX) 2 ,H 2 S 0 ^ 

RX + HCl HX.HCl 

wheres RX is an anion exchange resin with an acid-binding 
substituent X, 

The action of anion exchangers may be considered as 
formation of an addition compound of the acid and the active 
groups (usually amino or imino) of the exchanger, Schw'artz, 
Edwards, and Boudreaux ( 37 ) consider anion exchange to consist 
of two processes of removals- salt formation involving amino 
groups; and adsorption. They claim that salt formation is the

main factor in solutions containing free acid® 

It is noted that the acid-adsorbents are only effective for 
strong acids, and that weak acids like carbonic are left in 
solution* Myers (23) reports that the acid binding capacity of 
acid adsorbents depends mainly on the chemical composition and 
molecular configuration,of the exchanger although other factors^ 
have some importance, eg. the degree of ionization of the acid, 
its' basicity, the influent concentration, the molecular size of 
the acid, etc*. 

The carbonaceous zeolites have one great advantage over other 
water treating materials in that they can be regenerated by 
simply reversing the reactions which take place during the 
softening of the water. The reactions which occur are true 
equilibria reactions and obey the Law of Ms^s Action so that an 
increase in the concentration of the products reverses the 
reaction, , Usually a large excess of regenerant is used, and 
a high concentration is employed so that regeneration will be 
neariwcomplete. Complete regeneration is possible but is not 
economically practical and so an optimum regeneration value is 
chosen. For regeneration of cation exchange resins, dilute acid 
solutions are generally used for those which operate in the 
hydrogen cycle, and common salt solutions are used for those which 
operate in the sodium cycle. For anion exchangers, solutions 
of sodium carbonate or dilute sodium hydroxide are generally used

and they are believed to act by neutralizing the fixed acid and 
freeing the resin* Thus^ the reactions during regeneration are 
as followss 

For Cation Exchange Resins operating in the hydrogen cycles 
2 NaR + H2S0^ 2 HR + NaaSO^ 

where: NaR is the sodium salt of the resin (exhausted state) 

HR is the hydrogen salt of the exchange resin ie. the 
resin ready to operate in the hydrogen cycle* 

For Cation Exchange Resins operating in the sodium cycles 
MR + NaCl MCI + NaR 

where: M is any metal cation removed from solution by exchange for 
sodium ion* 

NaR is the sodium salt of the resin^* ie. the resin ready 
to operate in the sodium cycle. 

For Anion Exchange Resinss 

2 (RX,HC 1 ) ^ Na2C03 2 RX + 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2 

where; RX.HGl is the exhausted state of the resin, in the form of 
its hydrochloric add salt, 

RX is the free resin, ready to adsorb acid* 

Certain of the cation exchangers are capable of removing 
bicarbonate from water, indeed any that operate in the hydrogen 
cycle can be adapted for the removal of bicarbonates® These 
exchangers convert sodium bicarbonate to free carbonic acid by 
the replacement of hydrogen ions for sodium ions. The carbonic

acid is then removed by simple aeration. The reactions involved 
are as follows: 

(i) HR •*“ NaHCO^ “»• NaR + H2GO3 
where: R is the cation exchange resin 

HR is the hydrogen salt of the cation exchange resin, 

(ii) i^CO^ H2O + C02t 

Reaction (i) usually takes place in a coltmin wheidn the water 
to be treated runs downward under pressure through a bed of the 
cation exchange resin (usually a carbonaceous zeolite), From the 
bottom of the column the water is led to a deaerator or degasifier 
where reaction (ii) takes place, as air is bubbled through the 
column bringing about decomposition of the carbonic acid* 

The main difficulty in using synthetic resin ion exchangers 
for solving this problem is that the rate of flow through the 
ion exchanger columns at atmospheric pressure is too slow to be 
practical. In order to obtain suitable rates of flow and thus 
produce sufficient treated water^ the raw water must be forced 
through the exchanger columns under some pressure. Householders 
who carry their own water in pails from wells find that synthetic 
resin ion exchangers as used in the ordinary way are of little 
or no value to them. In addition to this^ the exchangers 
require regeneration from time to time and this requires some 
technique. The most desirgble method of removal for our purposes 
would be one which is rapid^ inexpensive, and simple»

A Methods__of ^alvsis^ 

The methods used for the analysis of water are those 
recommended by the American Public Health Association (2) in 
their ’Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Sewage’® 
(i) Determination of Alkalinitys 

Alkalinity may result from one or more of the following 
three ions^- carbonate, bicarbonate, or hydroxyl*^ The amount of 
alkalinity is determined by titration with standard solutions 
of strong acids to equivalence points given by indicator solutions 
Phenolphthalein and Metl:yl Orange are used to obtain these 
equivalence points* The method is as follows: to a sample of 
water of known volume, phenolphthalein is added* The solution is 
then titrated with 0,02N sulfuric acid until the pink coloration 
just disappears* Then methyl orange is added to the same 
solution and the titration is resumed until the color changes 
from yellow to pink* 

Calculations are usually made in ppm of calcium carbonate. 

For a 100 ml, sample the method of calculation is this: 

Total Alkalinity » (ml. 0,02N H2S0^ x: 10) ppm CaC 03 
The total alkalinity may be expressed in terms of any other 
radical by application of the appropriate factor, eg, 
ppm NaHCO^ = ppm CaCO^ x 1,68 

Similarly, if the size of sample chosen is not 100 ml,, a suitable

The type of alkalinity present (ie, carbonate or non-carbonate) 
may be determined by a consideration of the relative amounts of 
acid used in the titration with each indicator. Table II (2) 
siimraarizes the relation between the alkalinity and the radical 
present. Values of all radicals are expressed in ppm calcium

to 0,0007163 gm, or 0.7163 mg* of chloride ion* A blank value 
or 0,20 ml, waS subtracted from each titration before calculation* 
Calculation of the chloride ion concentration wgs made in 
ppm of chloride ion as follows! 

ppm Cl” ^ ml* AgNO^ x 14*286 for a 50 ml. sample, 

(iii) Determination of Sulfatej 

Sulfate was determined by a volumetric method^ i.e. the 
titration of sulfate by a standard solution of barium chloride 
using tetrahydroxyq|Jinone as the indicator. The barim chloride 
solution was standardized by titration with standard sulfuric 
acid using tetrahydroxyquinone as indicator. The barium 
chloride used was 0,0543 N, i.e. 1 ml, 6f the solution WaS 
equivalent to 0,02608 gm, of sulfate radical* 

ppm SO^” = ml. 0.025N BaCl2 x 24 for a 50 ml, sample* 

Pr^aration of_Synthetic_Water£, 

In the preliminary stages of the research, as reported in 
this paper, synthetic waters containing only sodium bicarbonate 
in concentrations that might be met with in natural waters were

used. When a satisfactory method for removing sodium bicarbonate 
from such a water is developed^ the next stage is to use a water 
containing, in addition, chloride and sulfate ions. If the method 
is still successful, then natural waters of the bicarbonate type 
will be examined. 

These solutions were made by dissolving sodium bicarbonate 
in distilled water. Varying concentrations were used and these 
are indicated v/here the experimental results are given. The 
bicarbonate ion concentration was determined by titration of 
the solution with a standard acid solution and then the alkalinity 
was calculated the method described earlier in this paper. 
Results are reported as ppm of bicarbonate ion. 

It will be noticed that, especially in the more concentrated 
solutions, the total alkalinity is greater than that due to 
bicarbonate. The explanation for this excess alkalinity may 
be found in the hydrolysis of part of the sodium bicarbonate 
according to the following reaction: 

NaHC03 + H2O NaOH + H2O + CO2 

This increase 3 ji alkalinity made frequent restandardization of 
the bicarbonate solution necessary. 

Methods_of Removal of _Bicarbonates 

Several simple means for the removal of bicarbonate from 
water have been tried.

(i) Use of Lime: 

After consideration of the theoretical aspects of lime 
treatment, it was decided to try the effect of lime for 
bicarbonate removal. Different contact times were used, and the 
effect of agitation was noted as some solutions were stirred and 
others were not, 

100 ml. samples of standardized sodium bicarbonate solution 
were treated with the required weight of calcium oxide, and then 
25 ml. samples were carefully withdrawn for titration at the 
appropriate times. Triplicates were run on all tests. The 
Alkalinity was once more determined using both phenolphthalein 
and methyl orange, and from this the decrease of bicarbonate in 
ppm was obtained. The results ove summarized in Table III, 
where the values of all columns are expressed in ppm bicarbonate 
ion,

In runs 1 to 5 inclusive, both the original total alkalinity 


and the original bicarbonate were 23 ppm bicarbonate ion. In 
these runs 0,002 gm, of calcium oxide were added in all cases. 

In runs 6 to 13 inclusive, the original total alkalinity 
was 427 ppm bicarbonate ion and the original bicarbonate was 
3B7 ppm bicarbonate ion. In these runs, 0.55 gm, of calcium 
oxide were added. 

Obviously, for high bicarbonate waters, the use of lime 
?dll effectively remove the bicarbonate without leaving too 
large an amount of calcium carbonate in solution. From the 
standpoint of removal of bicarbonate, this method is satisfactory 
but, aS is shown by Table III, the resultant waters are not 
potable due to a high hydroxyl ion concentration. Lime treatment 
causes a sharp increase in the hydroxyl ion concentration of

the waters, and so this method must be discarded 


(ii) Neutralization by Acid: 

Bicarbonate may be readily destroyed by acid according to 
the equations 

HCO 3 " H 2 CO 3 H 2 O 4 . CO 2 

There are, however, several drawbacks to this method of removal, 
amongst them are the expensiveness of the acid, the dangers 
arising from careless use of acid, and the biggest disadvantage 
of all is that the anion from the acid is left in solution* 
Hydrochloric and sulfuric acids are the most commonly used, and 
their use results in chloride or sulfate ions being left in 
solution after the bicarbonate ions are removed* According to 
Hardenbergh (13) the allowable chloride content of water is 
250 ppm expressed as chloride ion 5 and the allowable sulfate 
is 250 ppm expressed as sulfate ion* 

In the case of the high bicarbonate waters considered here, 
the acid required to remove the bicarbonate would be such that 
an objectionable quantity of acid radical would be left in 
solution* It Was, then, suggested that dilute sulfuric or 
dilute hydrochloric acid could be used to remove the bicarbonate 
from the water, and then the residual sulfate or chloride be 
removed by some application of the ion exchange process. 

Standard acid solutions were used .and the amount of acid required 
was calculated from the normality of the acid and the knov/n

Knov/n volumes of a standard acid solution were added to 
200 ml* of bicarbonate solution, the volume of aCid used being 
such that it contained, nearly the same number of equivalents 
as the bicarbonate solution* Several minutes were allowed in 
order that the carbon dioxide could escape and then 25 ml* 
samples were withdrawn for determination of bicarbonate and 
chloride or sulfate| The remainders of the solutions were now 
passed through anion exchange columns at different rates of 
flow and once more 25 ml. samples were titrated for alkalinity 
and sulfate or chloride. 

The anion exchanger used was a product of the Resinous 
Products Corporation, Amberlite IR»4“AG, For preparation of 
the column, a 100 cm, glass tube with internal diameter of 3 cm. 

Was used. The tube was fitted with a rubber stopper at the 
lower end, through which ran a piece of glass tubing fitted with 
a stopcock* A close-.fitting screen of Monel metal was placed 6 
cm, above the rubber stopper. The screen was of a mesh small 
enough in diameter to retain the particles of the 3 in^ gravel 
bed just above it. The gravel used was that provided by the

and in runs 7, 8, 17^ and 18^ the tdjne for the solution 

to tun through the bed of Amberlite was 15 minutes* 

One should note that in all cases^ the non-biearbonate . ^ 
hardness is completely removed* By consideration of Tables I¥ 
and it may be seen that both hydrochloric and sulfuric acids 
will effectively remove the bicarbonate from solution^ but 
it is also obvious that the chloride ion is more rapidly and 
effectively removed by the anion exchanger^ Amberlite IR-4“’Ag, 
than is the sulfate ion, 

Myersj Eastes, and Mjers (30) report that Amberlite IR-4“AG 
has a high exchange capacity and excellent quality of ion removal 
bu.t may leave a little color in the treated water. The fi^st 
portion of the effluent after treatment with the exchanger did 
have a faint straw yellow color, but the subsequent portions 
were colorless or nearly so* 

A few experimental runs were made using the Permutit 
Corporation's ^DeAciditef, but the use of this exchanger was 
discontinued because it leaves a great deal of color in the 
treated water. Sometimes the .first portion of the water after 
treatment WaS a very deep yellow and the subsequent portions 
although paler were still highly colored. Keeping the bed 
soaked in distilled water when not in use and a preliminary wash 
of the bed with fresh distilled water does not stop this coloring 
of the solution.

The method of removal of bicarbonate by the use of acid 
is, then, effective, but there is the difficulty of the necessity 
of ion exchange procedure to remove offending anions* This 
method of removal of bicarbonates would find application where 
the bicarbonate content is so low that the residual anion after 
neutralization would be within the permissible range* 

(iii) Contact with Ion Exchangers? 

In their discussion of the mechanism of ion exchange, 

Kunin and Myers (18) reported that the signifigant feature of 
the ion exchange process was the time required for diffusion of 
the solution into the exchanger particle. This suggested that 
it might be possible to obtain some ,measure of bicarbonate removal 
by simple contact between exchanger and bicarbonate solution 
without the formality of running the solution through tightly 
packed beds of exchanger* 

Zeo“Karb H recommended itself most highly for this purpose. 
According to the claims of the Permutit Corporation, **Zeo~Ks^b H 
is a new zeolite, practically non siliceous, and absolutely 
resistant to agressive attack by acids and bases* When regenerated 
by acid it will exchange hydrogen ion for cations* It is the 
only known method for removing sodium bicarbonate from solution 
since it converts this salt to carbonic acid which decomposes 
into carbon dioxide and water,*’ Applebaum and Riley (3) have done 
extensive work with Zeo-Karb H as a method for the removal of

soditun bicarbonate. The;/” suggest that the sodium bicarbonate 
be run through beds of Zeo^Karb H where the sodium ion in solution 
is replaced by hydrogen ion from the exchanger^ and then the acid 
effluent be blended with raw water to neutralize it to the 
desired pH, The reactions involved would be aS follows for a 
high bicarbonate water containing relatively small amounts of 
chloride and siflfate.

It seemed, possible to carry out both reactions in one vessel. 
Weighed quantities of the exchanger’ under consideration were

added to beakers containing 100 ml. samples of the sodium 
bicarbonate solution, 10 ml, samples were titrated at various 
tirnes^” the alkalinity to both phenolphthalein and methyl orange 
being determined. Triplicates were run as before.

It may be seen that a very concentrated solution of sodium 
bicarbonate was used for the tests summarized in tables VI, VII, and 
VIII. The amounts of exchangers used were limited to 2 and 5 
grams for 100 ml* portions of this synthetic water. Obviously 
in such concentrated solutions this quantity of exchanger is 
not sufficient to reduce the alkalinity to any stationaiy value. 
Apparently at some point the reaction is reversed and carbonate 
is put back into solution. Zeo-Karb H appears to be the most 
useful of the exchangers for our purposes. 

The next series of experiments were run using more dilute 
sodium bicarbonate solutions whilst restricting the amount of 
exchanger as above. These results are given in Itables IX, X, 
and XI.

treatment of one normal dayfe requirements in a small community« 

A consideration of the tables shows that the same quantities 
of exchanger reduce alkalinity by a similar amount regardless 
of the concentration of the solution in which they are usedj,- 
this is especially so in the case of Zeo-Karb H, 

The concentrations of the solutions used to date are 
slightly tbove what might be expected in natural waters* The 
next step will be to work with waters containing only a few^ 
hundred parts per million of bicarbonate alkalinity. 

In the case of Zeo“Karb H there is a sharp initial 
drop in the bicarbonate content bf the water accompanied by an 
aljnost complete removal of carbonate. This type of removal is 
the desired kindj and if applicable to low bicarbonate waters 
may be of some val.ue. 

With the exchangers imberlite IR-=4*“AG and DeAcidite^ there 
is a small initial drop in the bicarbonate concentration but in 
most Cases the carbonate removal is insufficient. Apparently 
these exchangers do not give sufficient removal of bicarbonate 
to be of any value al't’hough they^ too^ will be tried in more 
dilute solutions«

Several methods for the removal of bicarbonates from 
water have been tried but a® yet no entirely satisfactory 
scheme has been devised# 

Treatment of high bicarbonate waters with lime will 
effedtively remove the bicarbonate but this removal of 
bicarbonate is accompanied by a sharp increase in the hydroxyl 
ion concentration of the water. This high hydoxyl ion concentratio 
increases the alkalinity so markedly that the water becomes 
dompletely unsuitable for domestic use# 

Neutralizai^ion with acid will remove bicarbonate but an 
equivalent quantity of anion from the acid is left in solution. 

It has been shovm that the anion may be removed from solution by 
application of ion exchange# 

In so far as ion exchangers have been tried^ there are 
good indications that Zeo-Karb H when added to a bicarbonate water 
rather than being used in a column will remove amounts of 
bicarbonate ion that might be found in bicarbonate waters# 

It would seem thiat this is the logical path along which further 
research may be conducted.

THE CORROSIOM OF DEInITM. ALLOYS 


BY CLEANUG AGENTS

I ^TTRODUCTION 

Although corrosion of meta].s has been paid a great deal 
of attention in recent years^ very little research has been con- 
ducted on the effect of corrosion by the saliva on metals used in 
the mouth aS integral parts of artificial dentures. This applies 
also to the cleaning agents used for these artificial dentures. 

As this is a problem which is of great interest to the dental- 
profession^ it Wg^s decided to attempt to measure the corrosion 
of such alloys and combinations of alloys when exposed to solutions 
of some of the common cleansing agents How used extensively for 
this purpose« 

Studies so far have been limited to the alloys known 
commercially as Vitallium^ Durallium^ Ticonium^ and Denchrome, 
in contact with the cleaning agents, Stera-Kleen, Polident, and 
Hygeol, These three substances were chosen because they are 
sold commercially on a large scale for the cleaning of 
artificial dentures# 

The problem of corrosion with respect to dental materials 
is slightly more complex than it appears on the surface, because 
as Skinner (11) points out ** The human mouth undoubtedly offers 
the most complicated and varied opportunities for corrosive action 
to which a metal can be subjected. The food eaten in one meal 
will be alternately alkaline and acid, varying in temperature 
from that of hot coffee to ice cream# The mouth fluids themselves 
are not entirely constant as to alkalinity and will vary in this

regard from mouth to mouth as well as in the individual mouth 
firom day to day.“ Thus, it is very difficult to make any 
prediction of the possible life of a dental alloy* However, 
we are mainly concerned with the effect on thS alloy of the 
Various cleaning ^geJ^ts used by those who wear artificial 
dentures, and no gttempt will be made to evaluate the alloys 
with respect to service in the mouth of the patient*

II TYPES OF CORROSION AND CORB.OSION TESTS 

A*jr 2 pes_of Corrosion 

In the report of Committee B3 of the A,S,T.M, on the 
corrosion of non-ferrous metals and alloys (l)^ they list the 
Various types of corrosion as theses 

(i) Total immersion corrosions- in which the 
metal or ^loy corrodes when totally immersed in liquid either 
at rest or in motion^ 

(ii) Alternate Immersion corrosions- in which 
the metal or alloy corrodes although it is not at all times 
completely immersed in the corroding medium® 

(iii) Spray or mist corrosions- in which the 
metal or alloy is exposed merely to a spray of the corroding 
medium® 

(iv) Gaseous or atmospheric corrosions- in which 
no liquid is observed either on the surface of the metal or alloy 
or even in its immediate environment® 

(v) Galvanic or concentration corrosions- in 
which the metal or alloy is exposed to varying concentrations 
of the corroding medium so that a small galvg^nic cell is set up 
which greatly accelerates the corrosion rate® 

The Same committee also defines corrosion a® an act of 
chemical attack^ and erosion as an act of mechanical attack* 

The definition they give is as followss "Corrosion is an act of

alteration by contiguous media having its origin at the surface 
of contact 

After some consideration, it becomes obvious that the 
kind of corrosion to be studied is either the total immersion 
type or else the alternate immersion type<» Since it is unlikely 
that artificial dentures are ever really dried, the type of 
corrosion with which we are concerned is probably most closely 
approximated^by the total immersion type of test, 

Tyoss of_Coi^osion_Testsj. 

In the same paper of the above committee, they also list 
three types of corrosion tests| 

(i) Service tests- The material is put into 
actual service and its aging is carefully watched, 

(ii) Service duplication tests- This type of 
test is done in the laboratory, usually on a small scale. An 
attempt is made to duplicate all service conditions which the 
sample may have to withstand, 

(iii) Accelerated corrosion tests- In this type 
of test, all conditions are made somewhat more drastic than those 
met with in practice and thus the corrosion rate is accelerated 
and measurements may be made much more rapidly. However, many 
sources believe the results of such tests to be much less reliable 
than those obtained from the other types of tests. Others feel 


that the saving of time more than compensates for %he loss of 
accuracy. 















- 46 - 


Due to the time element and to the difficulty of 
duplicating service conditions, it was decided to try the 
accelerated type of test« 

The committee B3 also postulates several criteria for 
corrosion, namely: 

(i) Loss in weight of the material corroded* 

(ii) Penetration of the metal or alloy by the 
corroding medim* 

(iii) Cohtamination of the corroding reagent by 
the products of corrosion, 

(iv) Corrosion itself ha^ a catalytic effect 
on the corrosive reaction, 

(v) General deterioration of the material 
which is corroded. 

They maintain that three factors govern the corrosion 
tate and that these factors are: 

(i) The presence and concentration of oxygen 
in the corrosion medium, 

(ii) The temperature of the corrosion medium. 

(iii) The degree of agitation of the corrosion medium. 

Aerations 

Many, indeed most, writers stress the importance of 
aeration of the corrosion medium for accurate corrosion testing, 
in order to control the doncentration of dissolved oxygen. There 








- 47 - 


are only two w^ys of controlling oxygen concentration effectively,- 
these are to remove the oxygen completely or else to saturate 
the solution with oxygen* Since dental materials are going to 
be used always in the presence of oxygen, and since the concen¬ 
tration of this dissolved oxygen will be often changing, it did 
not seem worthwhile to obtain the equipment necessary for control 
of oxygen concentration. It was the opinion of the investigator 
that some aeration of the solution would occur if the solution 
were shaken daily, and that this varying of aeration 

would probably more closely appro^dmate the conditions in actual 
service than would any scheme of controlled aeration* 

^ ' Temperatip^e Control^ 

The cleansing agents studied are usually used at or 
near room temperature which is 20® to 25®G* Because an accelerated 
test Was desirable, the temperature chosen was 50®G, 

The temperature of the corrosion medium Wg^s controlled 
as follows,- the flasks containing the corrosion medium were 
immersed in a large thermostatically controlled water bath. The 
accuracy of the temperature control was - 1®C, 

The original plan WaS to have some motion of the flasks 
in the constant temperature bath and thus to hgve some relat.ive 
motion between the corrosion medium and the test piece* As a 
shaker which could be used in a constant temperp.ture bath was

unobtainable from supply houses, it was decided to suspend the 
test pieces in flasks and to shake them manually each morning. 

The extent of such motion h^s not been determined. 

After some consideration of the v^^ious V/pes of tests, 
it was decided to use a continuous total immersion test cgrried 
out at a rate accelerated by an abnormally high temperature, and 
that the flasks should be shaken daily to provide a slight motion 
of the test piece in the corrodihg medium, 

Method_of Measurement^ 

R,M.Burns (4) suggests several methods for the measurement 
of coivosion, 

(i) Change in weight methods? 

(a) Laboratory atmospheric tests in which 
adherent products are formed produce a gain in weight, 

(b) Immersion tests usually give rise to 
the formation of products soluble in the medium and thus the 
corrosion is mgrked by a loss in weight, 

(ii) Rate of consumption of corroding reagent. 

(lii) Rate of increase of the concentration of 

the corrosion products, 

(iv) Pitting depth and density is a good measure 
of the corrosion in Cases where the corrosion is characterized 
by pitting. 

(v) Intergranular or surface corrosion rates

may be found in terms of tensile strength or elongation loss of 
specimens of appropriate shape and dimensions, 

(vi) Electrical methods; 

(a) Contact resistance of surfaces coated 
with corrosion products® 


G 


(b) Rate of increase of electrical resistance 
of small wires of metal as the cross sectional area is reduced 

by corrosive action, 

(c) Electric^ potential aid polarization 
in controlled environments® 

With the equipment available, the best method seems to 
be the loss in weight method. Since an immersion test is used, 
the products formed are soluble, and the corrosion is characterized 
by a loss in weight, 

Rawdon, Krjmitsky, and Finkeldaty (S) describe several 
possible tripes of apparatus for use in corrosion testing. It is 
a modification of their procedure for simple immersion testing 
which has been used for our tests. 

The apparatus consists of a large zinc-lined water bath 
equipped with a stirrer and a theruiostat which is capable of 
controlling the temperature within 1®C, In addition to the 
heater attached to the thermostat, an auxiliary knife blade 
heater is used to keep the temperature within about 5®C of that 
required. The flasks used for carrying out the tests were 500 ml.

Erlenmeyers equipped with rubber stoppers, A length of crochet 
cotton was passed through these stoppers, and this was used to 
suspend the samples below the surface of the corrosion medium* 
Size_and_Shape_of Test_Piece^ 

The A.S.T.M. Standards of 1939 (3) conta3jis an article 
on plant corrosion testing. They suggest that the size and shape 
cof the test piece should be governed by the following considerations 

(i) The ratio of the surface area to the volume 
should be large to give a maximum loss during the test. Thus, it 
is advisible to use thin test specimens, 

(ii) The size should be as large as can conveniently 
be handled in order to provide a more representative sample, 

(iii) The thickness should be governed by the 
weight which can be accurately determined and also by the form of 
the material. Castings must have a greater minimum thickness 
than wrought products* 

(iv) For convenience in calculation, they suggest 
that either the size of the exposed area b@ a whole number or a 
simple fraction* 

With all these cons3.derations in mind, it was decided to 
use specimens of 1 sq. cm.. This size was chosen because the 
material was provided in discs which were reasonably thin already, 
and pieces of this size will slip easily through the mouths of 
the erlenmeyers without the danger of touching or rubbing against 
the necks of the flasks* The weight of such pieces is easily

determined, running from 0.5 to 1,5 grams in the alloys used here* 


Mounting of^S^ecimensj 


In the same article in A.S.T.M. Standards of 1939 (3)? 
there is a discussion of the mounting of the test piece. They 
suggest that the sample shotild be mounted preferably by hanging 
on a piece of string or glass or other inert material. They 
list the basic requir^ents of the suspensory material aS these? 

(i) To prevent loss of the specimen due to 
causes other than corrosion, 

(ii) To eliminate the possibility of galvanic 
effects from metal°metal contact between specimens or between 
the containing vessel and the specimen*' 

(iii) To hold the specimen firmly in place* 

(iv) To provide protection for the specimen 
against mechanical damage. 

They also point ou that there is a necessity for electrical 
insulation of the sample during clamping. They suggest that the 
best method would be to drill a hole through the centre of the 
test piece and to pass the support through thj.s hole. This 
suggestion was followed in the cases of Denchrome and Durallium, 
but in the cases of Ticonium and Vitallium it was not possible. 

These latter two allo 3 rs are so hard that the machinist broke 
bits on them and could not get a satisfactorj^ hole. Accordingly, 
the centimeter squares of Vitallium end Ticonium were tied like 
little bundles for the purposes of the test. The suspensory

material used was crochet cotton, since this gives the strength 
of string for a much smaller diameter* 




Preparation of_the_Test Pieces 


The report on the corrosion of non-ferrous metals and 
alloj’^s which appears in the .A.S*T.M. of 1927 (2) suggests that 
no grinding be done on the test pieces, rather that they be cleaned 
by chemical means wherever possible* The 3 ;" suggest that corrosion 
be measured by weight loss, and that CP chemicals be used for 
all analytical work* Samples should always be prepared in the 
same way and the method of cleaning after the test should be the 
same as that used before the test for the preparation of the 
sample* The samples should be cleaned of adherent layers and 
also of grease. The method used for the cleaning of samples, 
both before and after the test is as follows? The sample is 
washed in concentrated hydrochloric acid for 1 minute, 
and then in water for. 15 minutes* Next the sample is given a 
5 minute bath in alxohol, followed by 5 minutes soaking in ether 
before storing in a desiccator for 1 hour before weighing.

Accordingly, since we wish to accelerate the test, a saturated 
solution of Polident is used* For this purpose, 20 gm, of 
Polident per litre of solution ^re employed* 

(ii) Stera-Kleenj 

The instructions for the use of Stera-Kleen are a® follows; 
*’Fill cap of bottle heaping full of powder and place in a glass 
or container for holding dentures« Add enough water to cover 
the plates (preferably warm) and allow to stand*** These directions 
give a saturated solution, and so, in the case of Polident 
20 gm. of Stera-Kleen per litre of solution are used# 

(iii) Hygeol; 

**Before retiring put plates into a glass of water to 
which has been added -g- teaspoon of Hygeol,** This gives a 
reasonably dilute solution of Hygeol, but in order to obtain 
observable results, it was decided to use Hygeol undiluted in 
the first series of tests* 

250 ml* of solution are used for each test piece. Originally 
the tests were run with only one sample in each flask,since this 
is recommended to give best results. In the last few tests, 
though, it was necessary to double up on the samples, being careful 
that the two samples in the flask were at no time in contact. 

In no Case were samples of different alloys put into the same 
flask at the same time.

Durayonjnd Acceleration_of the Test: 

Corrosion^ especially in the case of somewhat resistant 
alloys,is a very slow reaction, and for this Reason, more 
reliable results are obtained from longer times of testing. 

With an eye to the advisibility of a long duration of test 
and also to the short time available, it was decided to run 
tests for 30 days. It was hoped that with corrosion accelerated 
by an abnormally high temperature and by a high concentration of 
corrosion medium, the 30 daj'’ tests would give some indication 
of the corrosive effects of the several media on the alloys 
tested, 

Exoression^of Results: 

The corrosion is, then, to be measured by loss in weight 
of a test piece exposed for a certain length of time to a given 
solution. The sample is to be weighed accurately before and 
after the test, and the difference in weight is noted. From 
these figures the percentage corrosion can be easily Calctilated 
by using the following equations 

io corrosion - loss in weig^ht of sample ^ 100 

weight of sample before test 

The time is also carefully noted at the beginning and end of each 
test so the corrosion per unit time , i,e, the corrosion rate, 
can be easily determined. In the case of the alloys being tested, 
it was decided to c, 5 iculate the tine required for 1 gm, samples 
of each of the alloys to corrode completely in each of the media

corrodibility of each of the alloys in one corrosion mediiun, 
but wil], also give a comparison of the life of a single alloy 
in several corrosion media«

Uec hanism of Corrosion; 

Speller (12) says the driving force of dorrosion is usually 
electrochemical# The magnitude of the electrochemical potential 
determines the tendency of the reaction to proceed, whereas the 
rate of corrosion is determined mainly by the resistance set up 
by certain of the corrosion products, 

Con-osion in acid solution is more rapid than corrosion in 
neutral solution^ which in turn is more rapid than corrosion in 
alkaline solutions. Surface films on some metals such as chromium 
and aluminum have been shown to raise the potentials of these 
metals and so make them more resistant to corrosion. The initial 
rate of corrosion of a highly polished metal surface is abnormally 
low. Corrosion at normal temperatures increases with increasing 
concentration of dilute solutions of neutral salts^, but decreases 
again in concentrated solutions. 

Dissimilarity in the chemical composition of metals in 
contact with each other sets up a difference in potential which 
accelerates the corrosion locally^ accompanied by a flov? of current 
from the more corrodible (anode) to the less corrodible (cathode), 

of Corrosion of Metals_in Waterj

tendency to go into solution as ions but can only do so if an

SG^ehow removed^ In the Case of iron in water, hydrogen.plates 
out on the iron surface as a thin film which decelerates the 
corrosion reaction by insulating the surface from the solution, 
and also because it has a tendency to re-enter the solution itself 
in the ionic form, thus opposing the corrosion tendency, 
ii. Hydrogen is removed by one of tko reactions,- i»e. it may 
combine with oxygen to form water, or it may escape aS hydrogen 
gas. In general the iron which enters the solution is thrown 
down as rust and in a closed■system the supply of oxygen which is 
limited is gradually exhausted and chances of further corrosion are 
decreased. Typical chemical reactions are theses

The rate of the corrosion process will be that of the

Factors Influencing the Ooirosion Heaction^ 

(l) Factors associated mainly with the metal: 

(i) Effective Electrode Potential of a Metal in Solution: 









I'n- 






m 






/ 


j 




M, 


1 





The initial tendency of a metal to corrode in a solution 
is measured by the effective electrode potential at any instant 
between the metal surface and its ions in solution. The 
effective potential between two metals in contact with a solution 
is dependent upon the ion concentration in the so.lution, and so 
if two metals are close together in the electrochemical series 
there is a likelihood of the order being reversed. 

(ii) Overvoltage of Hydrogen on the Metal: 

On most surfacesj hydrogen has a considerable added 
resistance or 'overvoltage’ to overcome before it can be evolved 
as a gas. The factors which influence overvoltage determine the 
amount of work which it is necessary to do in opposition to the 
snirface tension of the solution in order to form and evolve gaseous 
hydrogen^ Electrical contact between a metal high in the 
electromotive series with a high overvoltagCj a^d a second metal 
lower in the electromotive series with a low overvoltage^ will 
break down the protection afforded by the high overvoltage^ 
permitting g^s evolution from the second metal and greatly 
increasing the corrosion of the first* Any active oxidizing 
agent will remove the polarizing film of hydrogen and thus remove 
the protective effect of the overvoltage* 

(iii) Chemical and Physical Homogeneity of the Metal Surfaces 

Surface non-homogeneities always increase locally the 


initial rate of corrosion 










- 59 - 


(iv) Inherent Inabilitjr to form an Insoluble Protective Film; 

Protective films may be invisible but very resistant^ 
apparently made up of one or more layers of oxygen atoms attached 
to the surface metal atoms b^r ordinary chemical valence* The 
formation of such a film causes the corrosion to slow down by 
bringing ^bout a change in the apparent potential of the metal 
during the initial period of exposure with reference to a standard 
hydrogen electrode* 

(2) Factors which vary mainly with Environment; 

{i) Hydrogen Ion Concentration (pH) of,Solutions i 

Obviouslyj, increasing the acidity of a solution faVors 
the deposition of atomic hydrogen* The pH of the solution is 
determined only by that part of the total acid present which is 
ionized, A change in pH may also change the solubility of 
certain of the corrosion products^* in the pK range from 4»3 to 
lOj the total acidity is usually more important than the pH^ since 
this is roughly called the neutral zone* In the neutral zone 
the dominant factor is the amount of dissolved o^^gen present 
which can remove the hydrogen that is formed® Increased 
alkalinity causes a decreased corrosion due to the formation of 
a protective coating of rust^ rather than to the decreased hydrogen 
ion concentration. In the acid zone, the formation of molecular 
hydrogen gas from atomic hydrogen is the most important reaction 
and thus the hydrogen overvoltage plays an important part* 

















- 60 - 


(ii) Oxygen in Solution Adjacent to the Metal; 

, Oxygen in solution is usually a dominant factor in the 

corrosion, but there are cases where the metals are subjected to 
serious deterioration in the absence of oxygen,- eg, in c^st iron 
the graphite forms cathodes with low overvoltage from which 
hydrogen gas can escape» 

(iii) Specific Nature and Concentration of other Ions in Solution; 

Chloride ions interfere with the fonnation of protective 
films on metals such as iron, aluminum, and copper, and they also 
tend to break down films already formed, perhaps by penetrating 
the film and breaking its bonds with the metal, or by peptizing 
the film* 

(iv) Rate of Flow of solution in contact with the metals* 

(v) Ability of the environment to form a protective coating on 
the metal, 

(vi) Temperature, 

(vii) Cyclic stress,- corrosion fatigue, 

(viii) Contact between dissimilar metals or other materials as 
affecting localized corrosion. Any metal such as iron ?/hich is 
above hydrogen in the electromotive series and which does not 
quickly form an impermeable protective coating when placed in 
a solution will tend to plate out a film of a'toiaic hydrogen on 
any more cathodic material with which it is in electrical contact 
in solution. This causes a flow of current through the metal from 
the point at which the hydrogen plates to the point at v/hich the

metal is dissolving. In the Case of more cathodic materials in 
contact with iron, the overvoltage is usually high enough to 
prevent the escape of appreciable amounts of hydrogen gas. 
However, the total amount of corrosion is determined by the total 
amount of dissolved oxygen which reaches the total area saturated 
v/ith the atomic hydrogen. The rate of corrosion of anodic are^s 
is accelerated to an extent depending on the area of the inert 
surface kept saturated with hydrogen. It has been shown that 
areas which are shielded from oxygen become anodic to the areas 
in contact with oxygen. The effect of restricting the access of 
oxygen to one part is not to increase the total corrosion, but 
rather to concentrate on the non-aerated areas the corrosion 
which would otherwise be spread over the whole surface.

IV EXPERIMENTAL 
A,_A^a2jsis of_ 

(i) Effect of Addition of Various Elements to Alloys: 

Rawdon and Krynitsky published a paper in 1922 (7) on the 
con'osion resistance of various types of chromium steels, aid in it 
they draw various conclusions regarding the protection afforded b^ 
the addition of various elements^ They report a marked decrease in 
corrosion in dilute hydrochloric acid for hardened samples of chromium 
steels containing 6*55 to 12^42$ chromium. In general,they say, cast 
alloys are more resistant to corrosion than forged ones, and those 
hardened by heat treatment ^re more resistant than the annealed 
ones. Polishing of surfaces seems to promote corrosion resistance 
and the addition of nj,ckel decreases the intensity of the corrosion* 
Skinner (11) also does some generalizing on the question of 
promotion of corrosion resistance by certain metals. He says a 
homogeneous solid solution type of alloy is more resistant to corrosio 
since it is a one phase system. The alloy must be homogeneous 
since the ’as cast’ condition is likely to be less resistant to 
corrosion than the properly annealed casting. 

Chromium dissolves in pure iron to form a solid solution 
and in so doing it lowers the critical temperature of the steel 
somewhat. Chromiiom forms complex carbides of unknown composition 
with any Carbon present thus decreasing the amount of carbon needed 
to form the eutectoid.* Chromium also enhances the hardness, strength 
and elastic limit of the steel. 









- 63 - 

Nickel lowers the critical temperature of the steel markedly 
and also lowers the amount of carbon needed to produce a pure 
eutectoid.* The ability of the steel to be hardened by heat treatment 
is 5.ntensified bjp the addition of nickel« 

Manganese dissolves in pure iron to form a solid solution 
but if carbon is present the manganese reacts with it to form a 
carbide whose composition is expressed by the formula 11 ^ 3 , Man¬ 
ganese causes a reduction of the critical temperature aOimost 
double the effect of nickel, and also reduced the amount of carbon 
required to form the pure eutectoid. Manganese is an excellent 
deoxidizer and general scavanger* 

* 

Definition of Eutectoid and Eutectics 

Eutectoid is an intimate mixture precipitated from a solid 
solution« When heated i'ts precipitation temperature it passes 

into a solid solution, and the time necessary for the alloy to 
homogenize completely is relatively long since the rate of atomic 
diffusion in the solid state is very low« Similarly when cooled 
through the eutectoid, no appreciable separation of the constituents 
occurs» 

Eutectic is an intimate mixture precipitated from a 
liquid solution, Vfhen a eutectic is heated above its critical 
temperature and then cooled, its components are e^^sily segregated 
due to the mobility of the atoms in the molten state#

Information from the manufacturers of the dental alloys 
to be examined indicated that they may contain chromium, vanadium, 
cobalt, nickel, and manganese in addition to iron. The; alloys 
were, accordingly, analysed for these metals* 

(ii) Determination of Chromium and Vanadiums 

Cliromium and Vanadium are determined together by a 
modification of the method suggested by Willard Diehl (15) in 
which the chromium and Vanadium are oxidized to chromic and vanadic 
acids respectively and then titrated with standard ferrous sulfate. 
The Vanadium is then determined separately on the same Sample and 
the chromium content is obtained by difference. 

The sample is dissolved in 15 ml, of 50^ phosphoric acid 
and 15 ml, water, then 1.5 ml, of concentrated sulfuric acid sre 
added for each gram of sample plus 3 ml, excess. After decomposition 
of the sample, the solution is boiled tin til the salts separate. 

10 ml, of water and 2 ml, of nitric acid are added and the solution 
is boiled until the salts separate again. This preliminary oxidation 
with nitric acid is repeated and the solution is boiled to destroy 
the oxides, of nitrogen. Next, the solution is diluted to 150 ml,, 
heated to boiling, and 10 ml. of silver nitrate solution containing 
2 o gm, of silver nitrate per litre are added and 1.5 gm, of 
ammonium persulfate, and the solution is boiled until a permanganate 
tinge appears,- if none comes, a few drops of 0,1N potass5-um per¬ 
manganate are added. The ammonium persulfate oxidizes the chromium

2V0S0^ + (NH4)2S203 + 4 H 2 O 2 H 7 O 3 + (NH^)2S0^ + 3H2S‘ 

The solution is boiled for 10 to 30 minutes to destroy the 
excess persulfate before diluting the solution to 200 ml., 5 ml» 
of ls3 hydrochloric acid are added to the boiling solution to 
reduce any permanganic acid in solution and precipitate the excess 
silver ion. The silver chloride precipitate acts as a Catalyst in 
the reduction of the permanganic acld^ the equation for the 
reaction iss 

2HMnC4 + 14HG1 2MnGl2 + 5 GI 2 + 8 H 2 O 

The boiling is continued for 10 minutes in order to ensure that all 
the permanganic acid is destroyed® 

The contents of the beaker are cooled to room temperature 
and 9 gm. of crystallized sodium are added to buffer the 

solution. The solution is stirred until all of the salt is dissolved. 
0.7 ml. of a 1% solution of dlphenylbenzidene is added (p,l gm, 
reagent is dissolved in 10 ml. sulfuric acid and 90 ml. glacial 
acetic acid are added) as indicator and the solution is allowed to 
stand 5 minutes for the color to develop before titrating with standarc 
ferrous sulfate (approximately 0.05N). The color change is from

nitric acid are added to oxidize iron and tungsten. The vsolution 
is evaporated to 10 ml, to get rid of all oxides of nitrogen 
and then transferred to a 500 ml. volumetric flask and cooled 
to room temperature, A fresh solution of zinc oxide is added 
in slight excess to buffer the solution which is then diluted

(iv) Determination of Nickel: 

The method used for the determination of nickel is 
the standard method to be found in any text on quantitative 
analysis (10), (15). The sample is dissolved in hot concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and then concentrated nitric acid is added 
to oxidize the ferrous salts and to decompose any carbides« 

The solution is boiled for 15 minutes and then diluted to 200 ml, 
40 ml* of a ^0% solution of tartaric acid Qve added to tie up 
the iron,aluminum, and chromium. The solution is neutralized 
with ammonia and 1 ml, is added in excess before silica and 
the insolubles are filtered off, and washed v/ith hot water 
containing a little ammonia. The solution is made slightly 
acid with acetic acid, heated to 60«'G, and 20 ml, of a 1^ 
ethanol solution of dimethylglyoxime are added followed by 
ammonia until the solution is slightly alkaline. The solution 
is then digested for 30 minutes at 60^0 and allowed to stand 
for at least 1 hour- to allow it to cool to room temperature. 

The precipitate is filtered off ttirough Gooch crucibles, washed 

. If 

with cold water, and dried in an oven at 110<> to 120®Cv Cobalt 
dimethylglyoxime forms but is soluble and so sufficient reagent 
must be added to tie up all of the cobalt, however, not more 
than a 5? excess of the alcohol solution of dimethylglyoxime 
may be added due to the insolubility of dimethylglyo^dme in 
Water,

(b) Tests for,Special Ions; 

The tests used for special ions were found mainly in 
Mellors treatise (5)# and they are presented here because they 
are not familiaTj^nd the results obtained with Polident aid Stera- 
“KLeen are also indicated* 

(1) Hydrogen Peroxide Test; 

If sulfuric acid is added to a solution of sodium borate? 
or potassium percarbonate and then the solution is extracted with 
ether and a drop of 1^ chromic acid solution is addedj blue 
perchromic acid is seen in the ethereal layer, 

NaB 03 & K 2020 ^ an alkaline solution + H 2 O 2 

(^^4)2^2^8 acid solution + oxygen and no H 2 O 2 test* 

KCIO^ & HIO^ a neutral solution and no gas^® 

Both Polident and Stera«Kleen give positive H 3 rdrogen 
peroxide tests indicating that they may contain borate or 
percarbonate or even a simple peroxide* 

(2) Potassium Permanganate Test; 

Perborate^ perchromate^ peroxide^ and persulfate all 
decolorize potassium permanganate. Chlorate in acid solution 
has no effect but in sodium hydroxide solution it gives a blue 
color, lodate haS no effect on potassium permanganate solution 
in either acid or basic solution* 

Both Polident and Stera-Kleen decolorize potassium 
permanganate completely in acidic solution. In sodium hydroxide 
they produce a bright red color indicating the absence of chlorate 
and iodate^___^_

(3) Silver Nitrate Tests 

Borate with Silver nitrate gives a heavy black precipitate 
which is insoluble in 10^ ammonimn hydroxide* Perborate acidified 
with nitric acid and treated with silver nitrate gives no reaction 
but if the solution is made ammoniacal with ammonium hydroxide, 
a silver mirror is formed. Potassium percarbonate in aeneous 
solution gives a white precipitate with silver nitrate, and this 
precipitate turns yellowish and then grey on warming. The 
precipitate is insoluble in 10^ ammonium hydroxide but gives a 
bluish liquid. If the solution is acidified with nitric acid, there 
is no change, bu.t in the presence of ammonium hydroxide a silver 
mirror is formed* taionium persulfate In aqueous solution gives 
a turbid solution and metallic silver when treated with silver 
nitrate. In the presence of nitric acid, a yellow solution is 
obtained, and in the presence of ammonium hydroxide there is 
evolution of gaS but no precipitate even on heating. Chlorate 
gives no reaction with silver nitrate in aqueous, nitric acid, 
or ammoniacal solution. In aqueous solution, iodate gives 
bright yellow crystals which are soluble ih ammonium hydroxide 
but insoluble in 20^ sodixm thiosulfate solution. Excess ammonium 
hydroxide causes a slight brownish turbidity and warming produces 
a brown precipitate* 

An aqueous solution of Polident when treated with silver 
nitrate gives a curdy white precipitate soluble in ammonium 
hydroxide but leaving a fine grey precipitate suggesting traces of

borate* If the white precipitate is heated it turns yellowish and 
then grey suggesting percarbonate • When a nitric add solution 
of Polident is treated with silver nitrate, a curdy white precipitate 
is formed which is soluble in ammonium hydroxide* If amraonium 
hydroxide is added first;, no reaction seems to take place although 
on standing the solution becomes turbid* No silver mirror test 
WaS obtained although it w^s repeated several times* 

Stera«Kleen gives a curdy white precipitate soluble in 
ammonium hydroxide but ^gdn a fine grey precipitate is left* 

If the white precipitate is heated, no color change is noted 
seeming to indicate ^ perborate rather than a percarbonate in 
this CaSe, Silver nitrate ^dded to an amraonaical solution of 
Stera-Kleen does not cause any immediate reaction although later 
the solution becomes turbid as in the Case of Polident* A nitric 
acid solution of Stera«»Kleen gives a curdy white precipitate of 
silver chloride when treated with silver nitrate and a® nsual 
this precipitate is soluble in ammonium h^’^droxlde* 

(4) Manganous Sulfate Tests 

A 1% solution of manganous sulfate, covered with a 
layer of petroleum ether to protect it from ox.idation by the air 
is used for this test* 

Sodium borate and potassium percarbonate give a decided 
brown with this reagent* Persulfates and iodates also give a 
brown color but this test is less sensitive* Chlorates have no 


effect 






- 77 - 


Polident gives a flocculent v/hite precipitate with manganaus 
sulfate, which quickly darkens to brown suggesting borate or 
percarbonate* Stera-Kleen also produces a white flocculent 
precipitate which darkens only slowly to brown,- possibly due to 
the presence of perborate. 

(5) Cofesdtous Nitrate Tests 

An air free solution of cobaltous nitrate, basic with 
sodium hydroxide, and having a petroleium ether cover is used. 

At first it is blue and then becomes faintly pink. 

Borate, persulfate, and percarbonate all produce a 
decided brown precipitate. lod^te and chlorate give no reaction. 

Polident produces a pink solution which turns greenish 
and then deposits a dark brown precipitate indicating the presence 
of borate or percarbonate, since persulfate has been shown to be 
absent. Stera-Kleen gives a pink solution which turns amber 
but no precipitg^te is noted. 

(6) Mickelous Sulfate Tests 

The test is the same as that used with cobaltous nitrate 
and a 1% solution of nickel sulfate is used. 

Borate, percarbonate, chlorate, iodate, and peroxide 
all give no reaction. Persulfate gives a black precipitate. 

When nickel sulfate solution is added to Polident a 
cloudy white precipitate with a greenish tinge is noted. The 
precipitate is soluble in ammonium hydroxide and was assumed to 
be nickel hydroxide. The atisence of a black precipitate confirms' 
the absence of persulfates.

Stera-Kleen gives no reaction with nickel sulfate* 

(7) Cerous Chloride Test: 

0,2 gm, of cerous chloride are dissolved in water and 
a few drops of hydrochloric acid are added to fonn the reagent. 

No cerous chloride was availit'ble so in this laboratory cerous 
nitrate was used. 

Hydrogen peroxide in the presence of ammonium hydroxide 
produces a faint yellow. Borate and percarbonate produce a decided 
yellow. Persulfate^ chlorate, and iodate give no reaction, 

Polident gives a white cloudy precipitate which turns 
yellow on standing and deepens to a d^rk yellow when ammonium 
hydroxide is added. This seems to indicate the presence of 
borate or percarbonate and to confirm the presence of peroxide 

Stera-Kleen also gives a white precipitate but in this 
Case it does not darken until the ammonium hydroxide is added, and 
then it turns a deep yellow* 

(8) Potassium Iodide Tests 

A 10^ solution of potassium iodide is used* 

An aqueous solution of persulfate will liberate iodine 
from potassium iodide, Percarbonates and perborates liberate 
iodine from potassiiim iodide when they are acidified with 
sulfuric acid. Chlorates do not liberate iodine from potassiiam 
iodide* 

Both Polident and Stera-Kleen liberate iodine when acidified 
with sulfuric acid and treated with potassium iodide and shaken 







- 79 - 


ivith carbon tetrachloride,- the Polident more strongly than the 
Stera-Kleen* Neither liberate iodine from potassium iodide when 
used in aqueous solution* 

Bromine is not liberated from potassium bromide under 
any conditions, and this checks with expectations, 

(ii) Quantitative Testss 

Qualitative determination showed that Polident and Stera- 
-Kleen did not contain hypochlorite, but that Hygeol did. The 
available chlorine in the Hygeol was determined by the follov/ing 
nethod (l 6 ), The solution is diluted with water to contain 
approximately 0,1^ available chlorine, 5 ml, samples of Hygeol 
were used and these were diluted to 50 ml, for titration, 10 ^ 
acetic acid is added dropwise until the solution just gives an 
acid reaction with litmus. The sample is then titrated with 0,1N 
sodium thiosulfate (standardized against a standard iodine solution) 
until one drop of solution fails to give a free chlorine reaction 
with starch potassium iodide paper,,

Chlorates do not interfere with the reaction between sodium 
thiosulfate and hypochlorbus acid in acetic acid solution, but in 
hydrochloric acid solution they are affected as follows; 

NaClO^ + 6HC1 NaCl + 3 H 2 C + 3 CI 2 

Miss Robertson determined the available chlorine in 
Hygeol by the method described above, and found it to be 0.9? , 
This checks with the information given on the label,- ’Hygeol 
is a stabilized solution of sodium hypochlorite containing 1? 
available chlorine.*

contains a trace of perborate, and of phosphate, 

Stera^Ideen is probably mainly sodium and potassium 
perborate, peroxide, chloride and carbonate containing traces 
of percarbonate and phosphate, 

Hygeol is most probably, simply sodium hypochlorite 
with perhaps a trace of borate.

Method of_Makin£ Tests: 


The method of procedure for the actual experimental 
work has been as follows. It will be recalled that the size of 
test piece chosen was one centimeter squares, and in all cases 
the samples were highily polished® The test pieces were cleaned 
by washing for 1 minute in concentrated hydrochloric acid , 15 
minutes in distilled water, 5 minutes in alcohol, and 5 minutes 
in ether, and then dr 3 ring in a desicci,tor for 1 hour before 
weighing to 4 decimal places. The method of cleaning had no

appreciable effect on the dental alloys since they are highly 
resistant to acids. 

The washed samples after weighing, were suspended by 
means of crochet cotton into the flasks containing 250 ml. of 
corrosion medium. The method of suspension for samples of 
Denchrome and Durallium was through holes in the centre of the 
test pieces. In the cases of Vitallium and Ticonium, the thread 
passed right around the samples. The concentrations used for 
the Folident and Stera-Kleen were 20 gm, per litre,i.e. a 
saturated solution. Hygeol waS used undiluted. The flasks 
were suspended into a thermostatically controlled water bath 
in which the temperature was maintained at 50®C,- excepting in 
the case of the Hygeol tests on the simple alloys, where the 
lower temperature of 47®G was useda 

The test pieces were left in the hot solution for 30 
day periods during which the flasks were shaken manually each 
morning in order to provide some motion of the test piece in 
the corrosion medium. 

At the end of the 1 month testing periods, the samples 
were removed from the flasks and cleaned in the same manner 
used for preparation of the test pieces^ The samples were once 
more weighed and thus the loss in weight was determined. From 
the weight loss, and the original weight of test piece, the 

percentage corrosion was calculated«

(i) Corrosion in Stera-Kleens 

The corrosion of the various dental alloys when exposed 
to saturated solutions of Stera-Eleen at a controlled temperature 
of 50<>C is given in Table IV. It will be seen that in all cases 
the loss in weight is small and can only be determined by means 
of the chemical balance. In no case can any of the alloys be 
said to be attacked by this cleaning agent,

Table. VI shows that Hygeol attacks the dental alloys 
more than either of the other cleaning agents tested* The

that on the soldered samples was 50®C^ Durallium and Vitallium 
are almost as resistant to Hygeol as they are to the other' two

attacked extensively by this cleaning agentj , The mixed samples 
are simple squares of the dental alloys soldered together by

SUMI.'^ARY 


Analyses have been made of alloys used for dental 
purposes, including Denchrome, Durallium, Vitalliugi, and 
Ticonium, These dental alloys have been examined for content 
of chromium, vanadium, cobalt, and nickel, since these metals 
tend to promote corrosion resistance* 

Some of the common cleaning agents have been analysed, 
those considered being Stera-Kleen, Polident, and Hygeol, 

Corrosion tests on simple samples of the alloys in 
concentrated solutions of the cleaning agents have been run 
and the percentage corrosion has been calculated* Experiments: 
have also been conducted with samples of alloys joined by 
means of a common dental solder* It should be noted that the. 
tests reported were carried out at a rate accelerated by an 
elevated temperature and by a high concentration of cleaning 
agent* 


All alloys testi^d were found to be very resistant to 
saturated solutions of Stera^Kleen and Polident* Durallium 
and Vitallium are resistant to Hygeol but Denchrome and 
Ticonium are attacked* In cases of joined samples, all are 
extensively attacked by Hygeol, even though the time of the test 
was much shorter* The accelerated corrosion in the case of 
joined samples may be due to galvanic effects®
