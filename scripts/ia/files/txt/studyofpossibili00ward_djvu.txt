A STUDY OF THF POSSIBILITBS OF WATJ^a-FLOODIHG AS A METHOD OF 


mcowm OF oil ffom bituminous sahd 

Part II - Datermination of the Viecoslty of the Oil Content of 
... Mt^'lnoua" . 


General Introduotion 

It le apparentt when om begins to consider the possibilities 

of water-flooding for recovery of oil fro® bituminous sand, that 

knowledge of the viscosity and of the viscosity-temperature relationship 

of this oil is essential*' No oalculations, based on the theory of the 

flow of fluids through porous media, can be made without having 

viscosity data on the bituminous sand oil at hand* These data must 

cover the range of variation in the oil* It is known from general 

observation that the oil varies in viscosity somewhat from bed to bed 

throughout the vertical section of the formation at any location and 

that it varies markedly from location to location over the lateral 

extent of the formation. Then there is the change of viscosity due 

to change of temperature to ooneider. Compared to ordinary petroleum 

the bituminous sand oil is very viscous* It is particularly viscous 

at the low formation teniperature of the bitimiinous sand deposit, nsLnely 

5b*F* or thereabouts*• Preliminary laboratory experiments on the 

(Z ) 

displacement by water of oil from bituminous sand in a flow-cell' ' 
indicated that a useful degree of displacement would take place only 


• Data regarding bituminous sand formation temperatures are given 
by Dr* G*S* Hume(i)* The Resr-arch Council of Alberta arranged for 
some direct observations of formetion temperatures with Mr. H*C* 
Spaetgens, Superintendent of Abasand Oils Ltd* A maxlmm thermometer 
was lowered into a mud-filled diamond drill hole in the Mildred-Ruth 
Lake area to a depth of 130 feet during winter weather. A temperature 
of 36®F* was recorded. Difficulties prevented the obtaining of more 
than the one observation*

ftt elevated temperatures* Just what temperature will be necessary for 
a particular bituminous sand is determined, obviously, by the viscosity- 
temperature relationship for the oil content of the bituminous sand* 

The determining of the viscosity of the oil content of a 
sample of bituminous sand is not as si^^^le a matter as it might appear 
to be on first thought. The difficulty is to get the oil separated 
from the sand without altering it in the process. The usual laboratory 
method of separation is to extract the oil rr<m the bituminous sand with 
a volatile solvent such as bensene and then to recover the oil from 
solution by evaporating the solvent* However, some of the light ends 
of the oil are evaporated along with the solvent and some solvent is 
left in the oil* Another method of recovery is to wash the bituminous 
sand with hot water^^ This operation causes the oil to float on 
the water as an oil froth* But this oil froth contains much water 
and considerable mineral matter* Removal of these impurities, 
inevitably, alters the oil. There is no known method of recovering 
the oil from bitvaalnous sand in completely unaltered form* The solvent 
extraction method is adequate when the problem is to measure some 
property of the oil that is not sensitive to slight degrees of 
alteration, such as specific gravity determinations. But viscosity is 
a very sensitive property and quite small deviations from a correct 
sample can lead to viscosity values that are so wrong as to be seriously 
misleading* Sinoe there is no way available for obtaining unaltered 
oil, the only alternative is to make the viscosity measurement on 
scroewhat altered oil and then to make corrections for the alteration*

Correction of s viscosity measurocaont on altered oil to 
oosipensate for the alteraticm may appear to be a dubious procedure* 

For the time being there seems to be no other way along which to proceed* 
Mention has been made of the method of extracting oil trom. b ituminoua 
sand by washing with hot water and tiien ridding the extracted oil of 
Ita water content arri of all but its very fine mineral content. Such 
recovered oil is altered, of course. But it is entirely free from 
organic solvent. If, now, a method of extracting and recovering oil 
from bituminous sand by bensene extraction is standardised, the 
standardized procedure can be used on samples of altered oil obtained 
by the hot water process. Mlscosity measurenients on the water-extracted, 
altered oil and on this same oil after having been dissolved in, and 
recovered from, benzene will differ. By working in this way with a 
series of hot-water-recovered oils which differ in their degree of 
alteration, it may be possible to discover a systematic scheme of 
correction which will bring measured viscosity vali^s to their true 
value with a useful degree of accuracy. If succesa is achieved along 
this line of approach to the problem, then bitveainous sand samples 
Can be extracted by the standardized procedure and corrected viscosity 
measurerfients can bo made on the recovered oil with confidence that 
the viscosity values so obtained at least approximte the truth. 

Thus viscosity data can be secured which will be of use in estimating 
the possibilities of water-flooding.

The viscosity of a fluid is a measure of its resistance 
to internal flow. In the oentijEjeter-graiii-seoond system, the unit 
of viscosity is the poise or centipoise (0.01 poise). These are 
the only fundainantal units in general us© at the present time. 

The poise may be defined as the tangential force in dynes required 
to move a plane on© square centiiiieter in area, at a distance of one 
centimeter from another plane of one square centirReter in area, 
through a distance of on© centimeter in one second. Expressed 
mathomatioally

where ■* the coefficient of viscosity in poises; 

F • the force in dynes per square centimeter tending to 
displace one plane with respect to the other; 

^v » the differerjoe in the velocity of the two planes in 
centiiaeters per second; 

L * the distance between the two planes in the fluid in 
centimeters. 

Modern usage restricts the above defiriition to certain 
fluids, called I'lewtonian, moving in viscous motion. In this 
case the viscosity is independent of the rate of shear and may 
be considered a property of the fluid. Most hoaogeneous fluids

of lofw or moderate viscosity are Hewtonian fluids for small rates 
of flow* It is apparent that the definition has significance 
only for Newtonian fluids moving in viscous motion* 

Some substances, in varying degrees, are non-liewtonian at 
all rates of flow, and for such anomalous materials it is freciuently 
difficult to establish their equivalent viscosity values. Harder 
asphalts and filled bitumens quite frequently fall into this class 
at ordinary temperatures* These substances usually exhibit various 
rheological properties, the most usual being plasticity, elasticity, 
thixotropy and dilatancy. These properties affect the viscosity 
determination adverselyC^), and whether or not accurate values of 
viscosity are obtainable depends on th® degree to which they are 
present at the temperature in question* Lighter bituminous raaterlals, 
on the other hand, are essentially viscous liquids over a wide range 
of temperatures and useful values of viscosity can be obtained 
without difficulty. 

The viscosity-temperature relationships of liquids which 
have viscous flow cbaracteristios are sometimes complex and consider¬ 
able work has been done in attempting to set up empirical approximations 
of experimental data* For asphaltic or bituminous substances, a plot 
of the logaritl:ya of the viscosity versus the temperature shows a 
rapid change in the viscosity over a wide temperature range(^)* At 
low and high teraperatures, however, the plot appears to b® practically 
a straight line within the limits of experimental error. The equation

This ©quwtion with o • 0*98 was fouiid to hold quite well for nor- 
plastio bitumens over a wide temperature rftnge(^)(®). In this caset 
If aoourate values of absolute viscosity are desired* the density of 
the material over the temperature range in question must be known. 

There has been some investigation into the effect of pressure 
on the viscosity of liquids^^)# It has been found that the effect is 
not great at moderate pressures* but that at pressures of one thousand 
pounds per square Inoh and upwards its effects are quite substantial* 
Paraffin-base oils have been found to show a greater change in viscosity 
with pressure than naphthenic oils* As a gei^ral indication of the 
effect of pressures, the viscosity is Increased about fifteen per cent, 
at on® thousand pounds per square inoh and about three- to eight-fold 
at ton thousand pounds per square inch* It has also been found, for 
a large class of oils* that viscosity changes of small magnitude are 
proportional to density changes* no matter whether the latter are 
caused by temperature or pressure^^^)* 

^uch work has been expended in developing various means to 
measure viscosity with the result that many different methods are 
available from which a choice can be made. Each method has its 
advantages and disadvantages depending on the circumstances and on 
the oharaoteristies of the type of material in question. There is 
no particular difficulty about measuring the viscosity of the more 
fluid liquids. The determination of the viscosities of highly 
viscous materials, on the other hand, requires special methods and 
presents problems not usually encountered in ordinary visco^try. 
However* no matter what method is chosen* the essential requirements

are that It should give acourately repeatable reading® of viscosity 
at a fixed temperature, and that it should be convenient to use when 
measuring the viscosity of liquids of the type for which it is intended* 

In general, viscosaeters are divided Into two classes: absolute 
viscoiaeters in which the constant for converting the readings to 
absolute units can be calculated from the dimensions of the apparatus| 
and praotioal viscometers in which the constants must be determined 
experimentally from measurements on liquids of known viscosity* The 
latter class Is scaaatimes referred to as “relative viscometers” • 

fhe simplest and most widely used types of visoomaters are 
those of the absolute viscometer class* they are dependent on the measure¬ 
ment of fluid flow through a capillary tube* the constants for such a 
viscometer are all ge<xaetriOBl and can usually be measured quite easily* 
Frequently, hosrever, relative jaeasurements only are desired, in idiioh 
case the instrument is calibrated with fluids of known viscosity* The 
theory of this type of viscemeter is based on Folseullle's law. This 
law postulates Newtonian flow and Is as follows:

In the cao© where th© liquid flowa under its crwn gravity head, A P 
is replaced by gph, where p is the density of th© liquid in grams 
per cubic oentiaster, h is the height of the liquid above the capillary, 
and g is the acceleration due to gravity in oentiraeters per second per 
seoond* 

Batch flow times are generally useda i*©#, th© time is observed 
for a fixed amount of sample to flow out of a reservoir through the 
capillary, the force generating the flow being supplied by the gravity 
head of tlie sample itself. It can be shown that the head, h, at any 
time, t, is proportional to the viscosity in any instruisent of the 
capillary type so that a mean value of h may be used and included in 
th© constant of the apparatus. Therefore Poiseuille’s equation can be 
reduced to the simple form 

■t=K^ (7) 

where K • th© constant for the apparatus, 
t • the tiise of flow in seconds, 

^ • the viscosity of th© fluid in poises, 
p • the density of th© fluid in grams per cubic centimeter. 

It is obvious from the equation that capillary viscometers in 
which th® liquid flews by gravity measure not th© viscosity but the 
viscosity divided by th© density. As noted previously, this value is 
termed kinematic viscosity, th© units being stokes and centistokes 
(0.01 stokes), the density of the material over th© temperature range 
In question must be kncnm If accurate values of absolute viscosity 
aare desired. However, since oils of a given viscosity show a 
ooH^aratlvely small range of density end because of Its simplicity 
and ready determination, the kinematic viscosity as such Is widely

used in the petroleum Industry* 

Several sources of error are inherent In capillary vlsco^ 
meters} and for some of these* suitable corrections can be made* 

Perhaps the most important is the "end effect" or the extra force 
necessary to accelerate the liquid at th© entrance and discharge ends 
of a capillary* this force cannot be distinguished from the true 
frictional or Yisoosity oostponent but it can be made negligible by 
having the length of the flow tube long in comparison with its diameter* 
The ratio of th© length to the diameter should be at least 
Another source of error is non-*^©wtonian or turbulent flow which, as 
noted before* usually leads to high vslues for the apparent viscosity* 

By applying the Reynold’s nmber criterion for the incidence of 
turbulent flow, this source of error esn be obviated entirely provided 
th© material is a Mewtonian liquid at low rates of flow* Reynold’s 
number values less than 0*1 are generally used in 

vlsoometry* Other sources of error in this type of Instruiisnt which 
are scaaetimes large enough to require consideration are drainage 
errors (11) 

and surface tension effects^^^K However, these errors 
are usually quite small and* in relative instniments, corrections 
can be made for them easily* 

The aoeuracy of measurement falls off with increasing 
viscosity not only in capillary tube visoomsters but in other types 
as well* This is due mainly to the effect that small temperature 
errors have on the result and follow from the fact that the magnitude 
of the change in viscosity with tenq>eratur© is larger the greater 
the value of th© visoosity^^^^. Pressure must be used to force the

heaTier liquids through a capillary tuba and tharaby another possible 
source of error is introduced with resultant decrease In accuracy* 

With increasing viscosity one is also likely to encounter the 
rheological properties mentioned previously which may lead to large 
Inacouracies* It can be seen, therefore, that more care is needed in 
the measurement of highly viscous materials if accurate results are 
desired* 

Of the 33iany types of capillary viscoaeters designed for the 
more fluid liquids and particularly for petroleum products, the modified 
Ostwald pipette, the Ubbelohde and the Fltssimons may be uientioned 
a© the most \ Th6St3 mr© all laodlfioatlons of the 

original Ostwald pipetr^e^^^) ana the essential feature of their 
operation is the aw&surement of the time of flew for the liquid meniscus 
to pass between two horlsontal lines on the capillary tube. The driving 
force for the oil flow is the fore© oi' gravity. The approximate 
practical viscosity rang© of the Ubbelohde viscometer is 0*01 to 1000 
stokes, of the Fitsslmons 0*006 to 12 stokes, and of the modified 
Ostwald 0*08 to 66 stokes* They have an accuracy of about 0.1 per cent. 

the capillary tub© method can be adapted to measure very 
high viscosities rapidly and simply. Two such methods Ixave been 
described by H.H. Trexler and H.S* Schweyer^^^^. In the first case 
a capillary tube is inserted into the container of heavy oil and 
pre8s^lre is applied to tl:^ oil surface forcing the oil into the 
capillary. The viscosity is calculated, easily, fS-om the pressure 
applied and the time the oil takes to flow a certain distance along 
the capillary tube. By us© of various sised tubes, viscosities from

less then 10 poises to more then 10^ poises een be sseesured. The second 
method covers the viscosity range frcaa 10® to 10® poises* This is 
accomplished by placing the material in a tub© about 5 centimeters 
Itmg. The internal diameter of the tub© will depend on the consistency 
of the material under test* The diameter of the tube usually varies 
from 0*25 to 2*00 centimeters* Pressure is applied to one end of the 
material in the tube* The length of extrusion of test material* after 
a certain time Interval* is measured with the aid of a eathetc^ter* 

The viscosity Is calculated from the pressure applied and the period 
of time for a certain length of extrusion* 

A group of viscometers related somewhat to the capillary tube 
type are those known as the "efflux” type. They have been de^loped 
fro® early convehtion in the petrolem industry* Here the measurement 
not of viscosity but of empirical constants related to it was developed* 
This practice still persists* The measurement depends on the time 
required for a fixed amount of the sample to flow from a container 
through an outlet under the action of gravity* The data are usually 
reported as the number of seconds required for the operation* Most 
widely used are the Redwood* Engler and Saybolt instruments The 

first is used largely in Britain! the second in European countries! 
while in Amerioa the Saybolt is employed almost exclusively* 

Ijone of these early petroleum visoometers measure viscosity 
directly* or even a property of the oil that is related to the 
viscosity by a simple function* Density is not taken into account 
and no corrections are made for end effects* The correlation between 
efflux time obtained by these instruments and kinematic viscosity

dopenda on the tenipereture in a complex manner* As a result of this, 
much effort has been expended on the oonatructlon of converelon 
formulae and tables* Perhaps the best method of oonverslon is that 
described by the A.S*T.i. Method D 446 employing emperioally determined 
tables* 

A large class of visccgneters entirely different in principle 
from the capillary InstriaRents may be generally described as the 
"falling ball” type* These are usually calibrated by using a liquid 
of known visooslty and they all depend^ more or leas# on Stokes 
Law which is as follows$ 

T - F r (a) 

Brr/^ 

where F • force in dynes per square centimeter^ acting on the 
sphere« 

r • radius of the sphere, 

V • velocity of the falling sphere in centimeters * 

« viscosity of the medim through which the sphere falls^ po.s<rs. 
The rate of movement of a sphere, differing in density from the 
oil and moving freely in it, is taken as an Indication of the viscosity. 
Gravity in this case, also, is the driving force. 

There are a number of "falling ball” type viscc^eters 
although they are not widely used* The most popular of these 
viscometers is the Hoeppler instruments^®^* This instrument is not, 
strictly speaking, a "falling ball" device because the sample is 
contained in a large cylindrical tube inclined at an angle to the 
vertical and the ball rolls down the lower side* A measurement is 
made by timing the movement of the ball between two lines on the

glass tubing which contains the sample* Excellent accuracy can be had 
using this method, the error being generally 0.1 to 0*6 per cent* The 
rang© of this instrument usually runs frcaa 1 to 10,000 poises* Large 
samples, howcTer, are required and it is rather Inconvenient to use* 

Also, opaque liquids cannot be tested in It unless special modifications 
to the instrument are built into it* flectrioal detection means are 
used and one elaborate device of this sort is described by D*C. Broome 
and A*R* ThomasAnother "falling ball" type of viscometer which 
can be used for opaque liquids is the "bell and bucket” modification^^^). 
In this case the procedure is reversed! the bucket falls while the 
ball remains fixed* The "falling coaxial cylinder” method is another 
modification that can be used to measure very high viscosities 
This type, however, is not adaptable to the maasurament of leer 
viscosities* 

Still another class of visooaeters, which may be called the 
“rotary" type are used quite widely* They ere, in general, fairly 
useful beoause of their simplicity and wide range* They are relative 
instruments and are usually calibrated by means of a liquid of known 
viscosity* In all cases the sample is held in a symmetrical container 
which either rotates with respect to a cylinder in it or the cylinder 
rotates with respect to the container* 

The best known examples of the "rotary" type are the 
MacMichael^^^) and the Stormer^^^) viscometers* In the former, the 
outer vessel is rotated at a constant angular velocity while the 
inner cylinder is suspended by a torsion element the torque on which 
is measured* The viscosity of the liquid Is, of course, related to

the torque measured* The Storaer instrument differs in that the 
outer vessel is fixed and the inner one is rotated a pulley-string-' 
weight arrangement* The time of fall of the weight Is observed and is 
a measure of the viscosity. The usml range of the Mae^ichael 
Yisoometer is approximately 60 to 260,000 poises, which makes it a 
fairly versatile instrument* 

Great accuracy camiot be had with the ^rotary" type instruiaents. 
This is due in part to the possible variation in the friction of the 
moving parts of the apparatus. Errors of five per cent, are not 
unusual. It has been found Idiat the spindle speed of the Storm®r 
viscometer which gives tli® best accuracy of results is six hundred 
revolutions per minuteObviously, this type of instrument would 
not be very useful for testing substances of very high viscosity. 

The viscometer desired for the present investigation into 
the viscosity-temperature relationship of bituminous sand oil was one 
which would be easy to construct, inexpensive, fairly accurate, rapid 
and easy to operate as well as useful over a very wide range of 
viscosities. After a thorough consideration of the various types of 
visoometers which have been used successfully, the on© finally chosen 
as the most likely to suit the necessary requirements was the pressure 
capillary tube type of R.H. Traxler and E.E. Schweyer^^®). An 
instrument was built and it has proved to be very satisfactory leaving 


little to be desired

The ^pressure Capillary Tube* fiscometer 

Deeerlption of th** ¥iseoTnnter and S®t*uj> 

The ”pressure capillary liube” vi»oc»i9©ter used in this 
investigation and its set-up are indioated by Figures 1 end 2. These 
photographs» along with the diagranKuatlo sketch* Figure S* clearly 
show the operating features of -ttie apparatus* 

The essential features of the set-up were a securely positioned 
oil reservoir into which a capillary tube, a pressure line and a 
thermometer were inserted* For the reservoir, use was made of a l/2 
inch statKiard iron pipe tee-joint* Into one end of the tee was threaded 
a l/2 inch standard plug and into the opposite end was placed a rubber 
stopper through which the oapillary tube was inserted. A standard 
1/E inch nipple 2 l/2 inches long was threaded into the other outlet 
of the tee. On the end of the nipple was a 3/4 to l/2 inch reducer 
which provided a convenient means for reosiving a tightly fitting 
rubber stopper* Through this stopper were inserted a calibrated 
thermometer reading to one-tenth of a degree Centigrade, and the l/4 
inch pressure line* That part of the tee opposite the capillary tube 
and in front of the l/2 inch plug was filled with lead in order to 
reduce the capacity of the reservoir and to insure that the viscometer 
could be operated on a very small voliane of oil. Enough space was 
left in front of the lead plug to allow of easy Insertion of the 
calibrated thermometer into the oil reservoir. A brass millimeter 
scale approximately 7 l/2 inches long, mounted on a short length of 
wood* was attached to the oapillary tube in such a manner as to 
facilitate measuring the movement of the oil along the bore of the

tub** Tho ¥l8eo:neter was held securely in position by a holder made 
of spruce wood* This holder oonsisted of a 2 inch by 4 inch base 
board one foot long on which was fastened two small blocks* These 
small blocks were placed so that the tee Joint could be inserted snugly 
between them* 

The viscometer was enclosed in a wooden cabinet with a 
double-walled glass door through which the flow of the oil alcaag the 
tube could be observed* The inside of the cabinet was approximately 24 
inohes in width, 20 laches In depth and 20 inches high* The walls 
were 2 inohes thick and were well Insulated with sonallte* In its 
construction, plywood was used for the outside walls, masonite for 
the inside walls and dry fir for the framework* The tightly fitting 
door had a frame of fir and hardwood and was supplied with a good set 
of steel hinges# The cabinet was preserved against further drying, 
with consequent warping and cracking, by varnish on the outside and 
glossy white paint on the inside* 

The other accessories in the set-up are also made clear by 
Figures 1 and S* The coaprassed air used in driving the heavy oil 
through the capillary was drawn from a constant pressure reservoir* 

A five-gallon bottle served this purpose, and was brought to the 
requisite pressure by use of a small Eberbaoh rotary compressor* A 
simple U-tube, glass manometer was connected between the air reservoir 
and the viscometer* The range of this manometer was one hundred cent¬ 
imeters of m&roury and readings could be approximated to one-tenth of 
a millimeter quit© easily* All air-lines were of l/4 Inch inside 
diameter rubber tubing with a l/l6 inch wall* The air pressure was 
held to the required value by use of Hoffman nickel-plated brass screw- 



olftmps* A l/4 horBepGW«r Fulton motor was used to drive not only the 
oorapressor, when needed# but also an eight-inoh four-bladed braes fan. 

The compressor forced part of th© motor assembly. The assembly ms 
mounted# along with a hardwood support for th® fan drive# on a base¬ 
board made of fir. The baseboard was 18 inches square with a thieloiess 
of 2 inches while the hardwood support was approximately 6 inches long# 

4 inches wide and 6 inches high. The two small l/2 inch inside diamrjter# 
brass bearings carrying the 12 inoh steel drive shaft for the fan were 
accurately positioned on th® hardwood block. The fan shaft extended 
through a l/2 inch opening on the wall to the Inside of the cabinet. 

Th® end of th® shaft was positioned 1 l/2 inches fress the inside wall# 

6 1/2 inches from the bottom and 8 inches from the door of the cabinet. 
The fan was driven at appreximtely on® thousand revolutions per 
minute and provided good air circulation end even temperature 
distribution within the cabinet. A bank of six thirty-two oandlepower# 
carbon filament lamps connected in parallel were used for heating 
purposes. The tempermture of the cabinet was controlled by a Fenwal 
bimetallic strip-type thermostat connected in series with the lamps. 

A second calibrated thermometer was pieced near the viscometer as an 
added check on the accuracy of temperature measurement. Th© fan shaft 
inlet through the cabinet wall# as well as the inlets for the pressure 
lines and electrical leads, were carefully sised and plugged to help 
prevent excessive heat leases at high temperature operation.

equation Is as followsi 

• P t (9) 

Oil 

This transformation is brought about by substituting w r^d for the 
volume* V, and rearranging to the above farm. In the “pressure 
oaplllary tube** method IT r^d represents the volume of oil la oubio 
oentlmeters flowing a distance d centimeters along a tube of radius 
r centimeters in time t seconds under a pressure head of F dynes per 
square centimeter. Since the end of the capillary tube is vented to 
atmospheric pressure* P is usually substituted for Ap. Also in this 
case the eoluisn of oil L being sheared is varying continuously, and 
is equal to the distance from the end of the tube at which the oil 
enters to the point midway between the place wl^re the flow starts 
and stops for each measurement. 

Capillary Tube Calibration 

To avoid large errors in viscosity ?ji©»aure^ent by the "pressure 
capillary tube" method it was necessary to calibrate the various sized 
oaplllary tubes that would be required in the determinations*. Froa 
an examination of equation (9) it is apparent that large error® could 
quite easily be introduced frm not knowing the radius with accuracy 
over the length of the tube used for measurement. It is also a well 
known fact that the cross•sectional ere* of » capillary may vary 
considerably over a short length of the tube. These v^riatloro^, if 

* Frequently* the tubes are too largo to be called capillarlesi a 
tube with an inside diameter of approximately l/Z centimeter is 
required to measure viscosities of approximately one million poises using 
a pressure head of fifteen to twenty pounds per square inch.

not taken into account^ may well lead to erroneous results in the 
▼isGOSlty measuroiuent* A short* quick method was therefore devised 
to measure the avera^^e radius of the tube over short intervals through¬ 
out its length. 

The following is a brief description of the method developed 
to arrive at accurate values of the capillary tube radius for use In 
calculating viscosities the "pressure capillary tube" method. The 
tube was first thoroughly cleaned and dried. It was now completely 
filled with clean mercury. One end of the tube was then plugged with 
a small wooden peg. Appro3clmtely 1 l/2 centimeters of the mercury 
column were now carefully poured from the- capillsry onto « siaall 
watch glass of known weight. The weight of this short length of 
mercury column was then found accurately to 1/10 of a milligram. 

After placing the capillary In a wrtical position the length of 
eactruded mercury was measured to the hearest l/lO of a mil 1 i ►.ietcr- 
This was aooomplished by use of calipers with ao aoourate vernier 
scale. This procedure was repeated over the length of bore required 
for viscosity measurement. Care ws tafean to work in a room where 
the temperature remained constant so as net to Introduce errors from 
the expansion or contraction of the mercury ooluain. The volusss of 
mercury corresponding to the various intervals of oolumn length were 
now calculated from the observed weights. The average radius of each 
interval was then found fr<M the calculated volumes and observed 
lengths of the respective intervals. These values were ncixitabulated. 
In an actual viscosity determination the tabulated radius values were 
used to arrive at the correct average radius over the interval of

oapillftry length in queetion* The radius of a portion of each 
capillary tube was cheeked by measuring its diameter* in miorons* under 
a low powered miorosoope* This was aooomplished by use of a Spenoer 
Filar mlorometor eyepiece* The radius values measured in this way 
checked very well with those oaloulated. 

The General Procedure Followed in Measuring Viscosity by the "Pressure 

Capillary Tube" Method 

A description of the general procedure that was used to find 
the viscosity of an oil sample by the "pressiire oapillary tube” 
viscoaeter is now outlined* A clean* dry capillary tube was first 
selected for the run* The sise of capillary chosen was dependent on 
the viscosity of the oil at the temperature of measurement* The 
oapillary tube was first inserted through a rubber stopper and securely 
fastened by means of fine wire to the millimeter scale* The sample 
wme then placed in the oil reservoir of the viscogaeter* A minimum 
volume of approximately 8 cubic centimeters of oil Was required for 
a successful viscosity determination* The rubber stopper* carrying the 
capil1Ury tube and scale* was inserted into the oil reservoir* The 
rubber stopper* carrying the calibrated ttermometer and pressure inlet* 
was also tightly fitted into place* Care was taken to position the 
thermometer bulb below the surface of the oil in the reservoir* If 
necessary* wire was used to bind the rubber stoppers to the tee-joint 
in order to prevent blow-outs at high pressure operation. The 
vlsocxneter was now placed in its holder near the door of the cabinet. 
After switching on the fan* the inside of the cabinet was brought 
uniformly to the required teniperature by means of the heating lamps.

By use of the thermostat alone the cabinet temperature was controlled 
to within approximately i 0.2'*F. At lower t 0 !aperatures, aided by the 
heat from a sixty watt lamp positioned near the outside of the glass 
door» the temperature was held to within ♦ 0.06*P« of the desired value• 
After the required temperature equilibrium had been reached between 
the circulating air in the oabinet and the oil In the viscometer, the 
air reservoir and viscoiaeter were brou^t to the desired pressure by 
iseans of the small rotary compressor* The air line from the compressor 
was now tightly clamped* The oompressor was then stopped by removing 
the belt drive between compressor and motor* When conditions had 
become steady, the time la seconds for the oil to move along the 
capillary between two readings on i^e milliiaeter scale was observed. 
These observations, along with the observed pressure head showing on 
the manometer, were recorded* This same procedure was repeated three 
or four times using successively lower pressure heads. After the 
determinations tlie depth of the oil above the capillary tube was noted* 
This oil head was converted to centimeters of meroury and added to the 
manometer reading to give the corrected total pressure head* The 
various values for determining the viscosity by equation (9) were 
calculated* The visoosi1^^ for each determination was then found, and 
the results ^averagod to give the final value at this particular 
texaperatura* 

The following precaution had to be taken when an oil sample 
was stirred or mixed to obtain homogeneity immediately before placing 
it in the viscometer for test* On stirring, small air bubbles were 
entrained in the oil and it was a necessity to allow ample time for

those bubbles to rise to the surface of the oil before the vlsooslty 
determination was carried out* If this precaution was not observed 
▼ery large errors would be the result* The length of ttuve it was 
necessary to wait was variable. This follows from the fact that the 
rate of rise of an air bubble was dependent on the viscosity of the oil* 
However, the following general rule was used successfully in the 
determinations where the sample had been stirred before piecing it in 
the viscometer. The oil was allowed to stand in the visooineter three 
or four hours at room temperature before making the determination, if 
the viscosity of the sample was approxiiiiately three thousand poises or 
less at 75®P* For an oil which was more viscous than this, the sample 
was allcwed to stand approximately twenty-four hours before making 
the determination. 

Accuracy of Method 

The over-all possible error of measurement by the *^pressure 
capillary tube" viscoi^ter, as used In the present work, was estimated 
to be approximately + 2 l/2 per cent* for oils of comparatively lew 
viscosity and t 5 l/2 per cent, for oils of very high vlsscosity*. 

An analysis of the errors of observation for an average vlsooslty 
determination showed an estimated possible error of approximately +2.0 
per cent. This is in fair agreement with the fact that the mean 
deviation of the determinations throughout the following experiiaents 
was approximately + 1.6 per cent. 

As noted in the discussion on visc<M 0 try, errors due to 
temperature measurement may boo<^e quite appreciable when testing 

♦ As a check on the "pressure capillary tube" method, the viscosity of 
anhydrous glycerol at 86•□"F* was found to oheok within ♦ 0*3% of 
accurate published data*

very viscous materials* It has been found, from the viscosity-temp¬ 
erature relationship subsequently developed, that an oil with a 
viscosity of 800,000 poises will be in error by approximately ±1.2 
per cent^ if the observed temperature is in error by ± 0.1*P. On the 
other hand if the viscosity of the oil is approximately 20 poises and 
the temperature is in error by ± 0.1®F. the percentage error in the 
viscosity is approximately ±0.4 per cent. Errors caused by tempera¬ 
ture measurement in this work were not great as care was taken to 
establish equilibrium conditions between the temperat\ire of the oil 
in the viscometer and the temperature of the circulating air in the 
cabinet before a determination was carried out. Calibrated thermometers 
were also used in the determinations to reduce the possibilities of 
large temperature errors. It has been assumed, however, in these 
experiments that the temperature could be measured quite accurately, 
or well within ± 0.2®P. This would, therefore, result in an error due 
to temperature measurement of about ±1.0 per cent, for the less 
viscous oil samples and ±2.0 per cent, for the very viscous oil 
samples. 

From the above discussion on temperature errors and from the 
mean deviation of viscosity measurement, it is apparent that the over¬ 
all possible error for the "pressure capillary tube" viscometer, as 
used in this work, would be in the neighborhood of ± 2 1/E per cent, 
for oils of low viscosity to ± 3 l/2 per cent, for oils of very high 
viscosity. 

Determination of the Effect of Mineral Matter on the Viscosity 

of Bituminous Sand Oils 

It was desirable to determine the effect of mineral matter 
on the viscosity of the oil samples that were used throughout this 
work. All the oil samples had some mineral matter present and, in

most oases, the amount in each sample 'varied considerably* It was 
belle-ved, therefore, that considerable error from this source would 
perhaps be introduced throughout the investigation which follows, if 
the effect of mineral matter on viscosity measurement was very great* 
With this in mind, a few viscosity determinations were carried out on 
oil samples with variable mineral matter contents in order to find 
the effect of the mineral matter on the viscosity of the oil* 

The following procedure was used to determine the effect of 
mineral matter on the viscosity of various oil samples* In the first 
series of determinations oil-free mineral matter was added to the 
oil samples. The mineral matter was obtained by centrifuging an oil- 
bensene solution* The oil, which was dissolved in the benzene for 
this purpose, was taken from the main supply. This oil initially 
contained approximately 2*7 per cent* mineral matter* A Dulin 
Eotarex centrifuge of eight himdred cubic centimeters capacity was used 
to recover a good deal of the mineral matter in the oil-benzene solution* 
The mineral matter, so obtained, was thoroughly dried before use in 
the various determinations* It was then added to 'various oil samples 
b;y screening through a two hundred mesh sieve* In the first 
determination an oil sa»tplo was taken fraa the main supply* A smell 
amount of mineral matter was added to the sample* The resulting 
mixture was well stirred before placing it in the viscometer for 
measurement at 84.4®F* After the viscosity was measiired the oil was 
sami^led for an ash determination* The percentage ash was considered 
to be equivalent to the percentage mineral mat'fcer in the oil sample. 

The ash was determined in duplicate by ignition at 1S70®F. The oil 
sample was now taken from the viscometer and a little more mineral

matter added in the same manner as described above* The viscosity 
and mineral matter determinations ipere then carried out in a manner 
also similar to that already described. After this same procedure 
had been repeated 4 or 6 times, the viscosity values of the various 
mixtux*es were plotted against the respective percentage ash values. 

(Fig,5-. P^^A) 

The resultant plot was determined to be a straight line.^ For the 
second determination a more viscous sample of oil had been prepared 
from the main supply. This was accomplished by heating two hundred 
cubic centimeters of the oil contained in a three hundred cubic centimeter 
evaporating dish. The evaporating dish and contents were heated on a 
small hot plate to approximately 266®?* The temperature was held at 
this value for about thirty hours. The oil was frequently stirred 
during the heating period. The procedure followed for determining the 
effect of mineral matter on this more viscous oil sample was identical 
to that already described. The values from this determination were 
plotted as before. The straight line relationship obtained in this 
ease^was determined to have the same slope as that obtained in the 
first instance. For the third determination, an oil sample was 
bensezie » extracted from bitmainous sand obtalr^d from Bitumount Ho. 4 
bed. This was accomplished by thoroughly dissolving five hundred gms. 
of bituminous sand in two hundred and fifty cubic centimeters of 
bensene*. This mixtur© was now extracted in the Dulin centrifuge. 

The residue in the centrifuge was washed successively with two seventy- 
five cubic centimeter portions of bensene. The extracts obtained frcaa 
the washings were then added to the main extract. Approximately three

using a one thousand cubic centimeter distilling flask. The oil- 
bensene solution was now poured into a five hundred cubic centimeter 
evaporating dish* Th© evaporating dish was placed on a constant 
temperature steam bath and the bensen© was further evaporated by 
keeping the mixture at a temperature of 176The recovery of oil 
was approximately seventy-five grams. Various quantities of mineral 
matter were added to about fifteen grams of this oil sample and the 
procedure carried through as previously explained. Th© viscosities 
and ash determinations were carried out and th© values plotted as 
before# Th© straight line relationship this time was determined to 
have a slop© considerably less than that for th# first two cases * (fig 5. 
Finally, the following procedure was carried out as the last deter¬ 
mination of this series# A sample of oil was taken from th© supply 
and some of the lighter oily constituents were evaporated in th® manner 
already described# In this case, however, the oil was not stirred 
during th© evaporation period of approximately thirty hours. During 
the heating process a considerable amount of th© mineral matter in the

th© end of the heating period the hot oil was poured into a beaker, 
cooled, stirred and sampled for a viscosity measureinent at 84#4®F# 

The mineral matter which had coated itself to the bottom of the 
evaporating dish was sorapec off with the small amount of oil which 
still remained. This material was thoroughly mixed. The procedure 
was now similar to that already described. In this case, however,

the mineral-matter-rich oil, obtained frotn the bottom of the

to be less than that obtained from the previous cases. From the

extracted mineral matter on th© viscosity of a bituminous oil sample 
was easily found. 

Determination of Viscosity-Temperature Relationships 

of Altered Bitumilious Sand Oils 
Another necessary step in this investigation was to 
determine the viscosity-temperature relationships for various bituminous 
oil samples. The properties of th© oil samples used in this invest¬ 
igation had been altered, in varying degrees, from what they were in 
the original bituminous sand bed, Th® viscosity-temperature relation¬ 
ships obtained from these samples, therefore, were not exactly 
representative of any particular bed of bituminous sand. It was believed, 
however, that there would be a uniform relationship between the viscosity- 
temperature curves of these altered oil samples and oil sauries 
contained in the bituminous sand beds. The procedure followed, there¬ 
fore, was considered necessary in order to ascertain, with accuracy, 
the general trend of the viscosity-temperature relationship for 
bituminous sand oil over a wide temperature range. This procedure was 
also a necessity in the correction method, subsequently developed, for 
finding the visooslty-temperatur® relationships of oils contained

A supply of altered oil had been provided for these tests* 

at B vtu^»v\o«Ar\V (Oil flQ.K+) 

This oil, obtained by the hot water separation methodj[^^, had been 
freed of its sand content by settling and its water content by 
evaporation* The water evaporation method that was employed to dry 
this oil is described by K*A* Clark and D*S* Pasternaok^^^K The supply 
of altered oil ocmtained approximately 2*7 per cent, of mineral matter 
and 0*1 per cent* of water* 

The following procedure was used to determine the viscosity- 
temperature relationships of altered bituminous oil samples. A number 
of oil samples of differing viscosity -mm prepared for test from, the 
main supply. Sample A, however, was taken direct frc^ the main supply 
and not altered further in any way before detenaining its viscosity- 
temperature curve* Oil samples Bx end Sg were pr©p{i»rcd by carrying out 
a bensen© extraction on two samples of biti^ainoue sand. The bituminous 
sand samples were obtained from Bitumount lo* 1 and Bitumcunt Ho* 4 
respectively. The extraction was carried out in a manner similar to 
that previously described. Oil Sauries C and D were further altered 
by the addition of different propojrtions of a light oil^^ or light 
ends as it was called. Sas^le C contained approximately 8.5 per cent, 
of the added light ends, while sample 0 contained approximately 4*0 
per cent* Oil samples E and F were further altered, to different 
degrees, by evaporating sotae of the lighter oily oonstiti^nts. This 
was accomplished in a manner siniilar to that already described* The 

♦^This oil was recovered during the evaporation of the water frcmi 
the oil supply used in these determinations. The color of the light 
ends was almost straw-yellow and had an A*P*I« gravity of 
approximately 44.0*.

Method of Approach to the Problem of Applying Corrections 
to the Viscosity and Specifio Gravity of Extracted Altered Oil 

Preliminary Discussion 

There is no known method of recovering the oil from 
bituminous sand in a completely unaltered for®. The hot water 
separation method* as noted earlier* yields an oil which contains 
much water and mineral matter* The removal of these impurities alters 
the oil to a considerable degaree. Oil recovery by use of a water- 
drive on a sample of bituminous sand packed in a flow cell also 
yields an oil that Is usually high in mineral matter and water content. 
Also* in using a water-drive to recover bituminous sand oil fairly 
high temperatures would have to be used in order to recover enough 
oil for test within a reasonable length of time, fl^se high temp¬ 
eratures would induce considerable loss of light ends with consequent 
altering of the oil sample* The solvent extraction method also 
yields an altered oil on evaporation of the solvent. In this case 
some of the light ends of the oil are bound to be evaporated along 
with the solvent and consequently lost. Then* on the other hand

aom© of tha aolvoat will be left bahliad In the residue unless the oil 
is heated to axoasslvely high temperatures. 

In this work the solvent extraction method was used for 
developing a method to obtain, with soma degree of aoouracy, the 
viscosity-temperature relationship for the oil content of any particular 
sample of bituminous sand. This procedure appeared to offer less 
difficulty than was presented by the other methods of oil extraction. 

The following considerations were involved in the approach 
to the problem of finding the correct viscosity of the oil extracted 
by means of a solvent, from a sample of bituminous sand. It was 
recognised from the outset that to recover the original oil frcsn an 
oil-solvent solution without any change in the physical aake-up or 
the physioal properties of the oil sample was almost impossible. TJw 
development of such a method was therefore beyond consideration. 

It was, however, considered possible that a method could be developed 
whereby the amount of solvent left in the oil could be balanced 
against the light ends lost frcmi tl^ oil during the solvent evaporation. 
The recovered oil In any such balance, so obtained, would exhibit the 
same viscosity-temperature relationship, and possibly the same specific 
gravity as the original oil sample. If such a standardised procedure 
could be developed, for a particular blt^Minous sand oil, and if the 
standardised procedure were carried out on other samples of bituminous 
sand oil with differing viscosity-temperature relationships the 
standardised procedure in this case, it was conjectured, would not 
give the correct viscosity or specific gravity values. In such oases 
a correction would have to be made to the laeasured properties in order 



* 32 . 

to obtain tho true valuaa* Any standardlaed soliront airaporation 
prooadure, theraforo, would in all probability haTa to involve soma 
sort of a oorrootion ourve. It was believed the most outstanding 
consideration of any standardised method, that could be developed, was 
that it should give reasonably small errors on any duplicate determin¬ 
ation. Another rather important consideration of a standardized 
method was a procedure which would not be too oomplicated or time 
consuming* 

A Brief Outline of the Method of Approach to the Problem 

A brief outline of approach to the problem of developing a 
standardized procedure for the determination of the viscosity-tempera¬ 
ture relationship and specific gravity of an oil contained in a sample 
of bituminous sand now follows. A definite weight of sample from the 
main oil supply was taken and dissolved in a definite volme of 
benzene. The oil was recovered from solution by evaporating the 
benzene under eartain set conditions. The viscosity of the oil was 
found by the ”pre88ure capillary tube" method at a certain 
standard temperature^. Duplicate determinations were carried out 
and the errors between determinations noted* This was necessary in 
order to test the standardized procedure being used* If such 
duplicate determinations did not check fairly accurately, other 
procedures under different sets of conditions were tried until a 
method was found whereby duplicate determinations would check with 

♦ The standard temperature throughout this work was taken to be d4.4®P. 
A atandard temperature was chosen at a value slightly above the average 
room tempetmiture so that equilibria temperature conditions for the 
viscosity determination could be arrived at without undue loss of time.

some aoouraoy. After a reliable standard method had been found* the 
next step was to prepare various oil samples of differing viscosities. 
These samples were prepared by varying the amounts of oily constituents 
present in the samples. An increase in oily constituents was brought 
about by addition of the light ends* previously metitioned* and a 
decrease in oily constituents by an evaporation of more light ends 
from the sample. (The properties of these samples, it was believe 
would approximate actual oils from quite a number of bitiMinous sand 
beds,) Tl^ viscosities of the various prepared samples wei^e 
determined at 84.4®F, The standardised solvent evaporation procedure 
was carried out on thee® prepared saiaples. The viscosity at 84.4*F. 
was determined on the oils so recovered. These viscosity values were 
adjusted for the mineral matter which each sample contained, A 
viscosity-correction curve was developed from the adjusted viscosity 
values* To do this, the viscosities of the oils recovered by the 
standardised method were plotted against the percentage that these 
viscosity values were in error from the values the corresponding oil 
sasuples had before the standardised procedure was carried out. The 
specific gravities at 77®F. referred to water at 77®F* were determined 
on the various prepared oil samples and on the oil samples recovered 
by the standardised evaporation procedure. The measured viscosity 
values of tiw various oil samples were then plotted against their 
respective specific gravities. The standardised solvent evaporation 
procedure was now carried out on the oils extracted from bituminous 
sand samples* The viscosities of the altered oils obtained from 
these determinations wore used to find tlie true viscosity values.

Thla w»« aoocMplished by use of the visoosity-oorrection ourv®. Frcta 
the viscosity-temperature ourves previously determined, it was an easy 
matter to find aocurately, by interpolation, the viscosity-temperature 
curves for the oil samples in question. The correct specific gravities 
at 77•f. could also easily be found from the plotted viscosity-specific 
gravity relationships* 

The Main Problem in Developing a Method for Applying Corrections 

The main problem in the development of a standardised method, 
was to find a procedure for evaporating tiie bensene so that the 
viscosity measurements on the recovered oils would check on duplicate 
determinations. It can be readily seen that large changes in the 
viscosity of the oil can quite easily be caused by small changes in 
the amount of bensene left in the oil, or by sisal 1 changes in the 
amount of light ends evaporated from the oil. Four distinct 
procedures were tried before a method was found whereby 

duplicate determinations could be cheeked with accuracy* 

The first solvent evaporation procedure that was attempted 
was quite similar to that previously described for the recovery of 
an oil which had been solvent extracted from a sample of bituminous 
sand* In this case 75 grams of oil, taken from the supply, were 
dissolved in the 500 cubic centimeters of benzene. The oil-bensene 
solution was then distilled in a 1000 cubic centimeter distilling 
flask until 210 cubic centimeters of the bensene were recovered. 

The distillation was carried out at a definite rate of bensene 
recovery. After the distillation, the residue was placed in a 500 
cubic centimeter evaporating dish* The evaporating dish was then

placed on a ateam bath and the residue further eiraporated for a period 
of one hour* The residue was held at a temperature of 176*F. through¬ 
out this evaporation* After the evaporatlon« the recovered oil was 
well mixed and sampled for viscosity measurement at 84*4®F* 

By using the above evaporation procedure, it was found that 
viscosity values from duplicate determinations could not bo checked 
any closer than about BO-30 per cent. 

The procedure used for the second method now follows* As 
before, 76 grams of oil were dissolved la 300 cubic oentifmsters of 
bensene* This solution was placed in a 1000 cubic centimeter 
distilling flask with a Hempel distilling coliiam, 9 inches in length, 
inserted into the top of the flask. The Hempel column was filled with 
small glass beads. The solution was noir distilled at a defixiite rate 
until 240 cubic centimeters of benzene were recovered. The residue 
was « placed in a three hixndred cubic centimeter evaporating dish* 

The evaporting dish was placed on a small hot plate which was at 
a definite temperature. The oil was gradually heated until the 

thermcmieter registered a te?iiperature of 280*F. The material was 
cooled, stirred and sampled iHsfore laaking a viscosity determination. 

By using this second evaporation procedure, it was also 
found that viscosity values from dv^lioate determinations could not 
be checked any closer than about 20-30 per cent. 

The third procedure involved dissolving 76 grams of oil in 
75 cubic centimeters of benzene and then evaporating in an electrically 
heated oven • The oven was controlled at a definite teisperature for 
a certain length of time. In erne set of determinations the temperature 
was controlled at 138*F. and in another set at 110*F. After a definite

period of tisie in the oablnet, the saoiples were removed, mixed well 
and sa 0 ^ 1 ed for test. 

The third procedure checked quite accurately when two 
duplicate determinations were heated In the oven at the same time. 
However, errors of 15«»20|^ were obtained whenever separate sets of 
determinations were made at the temperature in question. The accuracy 
of results appeared to be better at 110*F. than at 138*F. 

The procedure for the more successful fourth method, that was 
tried, now follows. In this procedure 80 grams of oil (77.3 grains on 
a mineral matter free basis) were thoroughly dissolved in 60 cubic 
centimeters of bensene. Approximately l/5 of the solution was poured 
onto, and evenly distributed over, an alumisam tray. (This tray was 
14 inches long, 10 inches wide and had S/4 inch sides which sloped 
outwards with an angle of 6®.) The excess oil was allowed to 
drain from the tray. The tray and contents were placed in the 
same cabinet as that used for th© viscosity determinations. The tray 
was positioned against the left wall ©t an angle of 10* with the 
vertical. Four more trays were successively ti;;»ted in ©n identical 
manner to that already described, the trays were positioned in the 
cabinet, one in front of the other, each at a similar angle to the 
vertical. One tray which was not oil •treated was placed in a similar 
position in front of those that were treated. Sisall nails served the 
purpose of positioning and holding the trays at the correct angle. 

(The photograph in Fig. 4 shows the position the trays assumed during 
a determination.) A time of 1 \/% minutes was allowed in the preparation 
and in the poaitionlng of each oil treated tray. Throughout the

solvent evaporation period the cabinet was kept at an average temp¬ 
erature of 79 •f. by loeans of the heating; lamps and motor-driven fan* 

The cabinet door was also left wide open during; the period of solvent 
evaporation* The first tray was removed from the oabinet exactly 
one hour from the time its initial treatment had begun. The oil on 
the tray was notu recovered by use of a sharp-edged wooden scraper. 

(This scraper was approximately 4 inches long by 2 inches wide with a 
thickness of l/2 inch.) The recovered oil was placed in a 26 cubic 
centimeter beaker* The other trays in correct order were slmilarily 
treated. The time allowed for scraping each pan was 2 l/2 minutes* 

The oil recovered usually amounted to about 20 cubic centimeters. The 
oilMtos finally stirred before sampling for the viscosity determination. 

This procedure was found satisfactory as duplicate viscosity 
determin tions on the samples obtained from the procedure checked 
almost within the accuracy of the viscometer. It w»5 also found that 
duplicate determinations checked quite &"ell even though the Initial 
volua» of bensene used for solution ms varied from the correct amount 
by 2 or 3 per cent. 

This standardised evaporation procedure js referred to as 
the Film ?^ethod throughout this work.

sand, 48 mentioned previously, the procedure would probably involve 
a viscosity-correction curve and some means for correcting the specific 
gravities of the oil samples to their true values. Two preliminary 
viscosity-correction curves were developed before a final viscosity- 
correction curve and visooeity-speoific gravity curve were found which 
could be applied to determine, with confidence, the correct viscosity 
and specific gravity of oils from some bituminous sand beds. 

The following is a description of the procedure used in the 
preliminary step to develop the desired viscosity-correction curve 
and viscosity-specific gravity curve* Oil samples with different 
viscosities were prepared from the main supply in a manner which was 
similar to that previously mentioned* The more viscous samples were 
prepared by heating to drive off more light ends, whereas samples with 
lower viscosities were prepared by the addition of varying proportions 
of the light ends previously mentioned* The viscosities of these 
samples were determined at 84.4®F. The required weights of the oil 
samples were now dissolved in the required volumes of bensene* The 
standardised method for the evaporation of the bensene was carried 
through. The visoositiejon the sample® ^/v . tfiis procedure were now 
determined* Both sets of viscosity values were adjusted for mineral 
matter and from the percentage error between the two values a viscosity- 
correction curve was developed* This curve was determined only over a 
short range of values. 

The main purpose behind this preliminary step was to find out 
in the quickest way possible if a correction curve could be developed 
by this procedure. The results obtained in this preliminary step were 
so encouraging that it was decided to further develop this line of 
attack on the problem. 



- 39 


It was recognited, that it would be neoesamry to somewhat 
modify, and considerably lengthen, the standardised solirent evaporation 
procedure already developed, if the method was to be applied to the 
extraction of oil from a sample of bituminous sand* In this case the 
bituminous «and-bensene mixture would have to be extracted by use of 
the Dulin centrifuge, and a much larger volume of bensene would have to 
be used in such a procedure. It was decided that about 300 cubic 
centimeters of bensene would be convenient to use for extracting, by 
use of the centrifuge, approximately 80-90 grams of oil from a sample 
of bituminous sand. It was also believed that these modifications 
would in all probability result in a correction curve quite different 
from the preliminary curve. 

The following procedure was now followed as a second. step 
in the development of the desired viscosity-correction curve and viscosity- 
speoific gravity curve. Two oll-bensene solutions, each containing 60 
grams of oil and 300 cubic oentiioeters of benzene, were prepared, the 
oil samples used in these two solutions had differing viscosities and 
were prepared from the main supply. These solutions were placed in a 
cupboard to evaporate at room temperature*. The air evaporation was 
continued until the volume of bensene present was 60 cubic centimeters. 

The voluoa© of benzene present was detemined by weight. The solution 
was thoroughly stirred before carrying out the tray evaporation 
procedure and viscosity determinations as described above. 

♦ It was decided to use room temperature evaporation as the 
preliminary work on the development of a standardized solvent 
evaporation method appeared to Indicate that low temperature 
evaporation led to more uniform results.

Since the results of those viscosity determinations indicated 
that the modified procedure would lead to a different visoosity* 
correction curve than the one Initially developed, the next step was 
to develop a correction curve by carrying out a standardised procedure 
in a manner identioal to that which would have to be used in the 
determination of the viscosity of the oil contained in an actual sample 
of bituminous sand. 

The following procedure was now followed as a final step in 
the develo|8aent of the desired viscosity-correction cijirv© and 
viscosity-specific gravity curve. An oil-ben«en© solutidn, containing 
90 grams of oil and 250 cubic centimeters of bensene, was prepared. 

This solution was now filtered through the Oulin centrifuge. The 
small amount of residue or mineral matter which remeined in the 
centrifuge bowl was washed sucoessivsly with 75 cubic centimeter and 
90 cubic oentissaeter portions of bensene. The two benaene washings 
were added to the main extract. After the solution had been 
thoroughly stirred, a weight of solution was poured off which contained 
approximately 77.^ grams of mineral raatter free oil. This weight of 
solution was calculated frcmi the weight of the total solution and the 
weight of the oil that was present. The weight of bensene with the 
77.3 grams of oil was now calculated. This weight of bensene was 
increased, by addition of more bensene, to a value which corresponded 
to a total bensene volume of SOO cubic centimeters. The resulting 
solution was once more thoroughly stirred before placing it in the 
evaporating cupboard. The procedure followed from this point was 
identical with that already described. In the same manner as previously, 
a final visoosity-oorreotion curve was developed by use of various oil 
samples of differing viscosities. These samples were once more

prepared from oil saa^les taken from the main aupply. The specific 
gravities of the various prepared samples and of the corresponding 
samples obtained from the film Method were determined at 77®F., being 
referred to water at 77®F. The specific gravities were determined 
with a possible error of approxitaately + 0.0005 specific gravity. 
Hubbard--Carmick type pyknometers with a volume of 25 cubic centlraeters 
were used in the determinations. Tlie viscosity of the various oil 
samples at 84.4*F. were plotted against the corresponding specific 
gravity values. 

In carrying out the Film Method to find the viscosity- 
temperature relationships and specific gravities of oils extracted 
fro-:r. samples of bituminous sand,. It ms mmsmry to make slight 
modifications to the procedure already described. As the first 
modification it was necessary to determine the oil content of the oil- 
bensane solution extractod fr<xn the sand in order to later determine 
the correct oil-benzene ratio for the tray evaporation procedure. 

As the second modification, it was necessary to alloFw a short period 
of time (about 45 minutes) for the extract from the centrifuge to 
stand without agitation in order to allow the ssmll water droplets from 
bituminous sand to settle out of solution* 

The following procedure was used to determine the oil content 
of the oil-benzen© solution extracted from the bituminous sand. It was 
first necessary to determine the water and ash content of the sample 
of bituminous sand. Then, after the extraction, it was also necessary 
to determine the water and ash content of the residue in the centrifuge* 
From these values, the percentage oil contents of the original 
bituminous sand and the residues could be determined. The percentage 
oil extracted was obtained fro;?; these two values, by difference. 



- 42 . 


The ash determinations were carried out at about 1370*F# in a small 
electric muffle furnace. The water content was determined by the 
standard A.S.T.M. method(2^). 

The following is a brief outline of the method used to find 
the viscosity-temperature curves and specific gravities of oils 
extracted from various saraples of bituminous sand. The Film Method 
procedure with the necessary slight modifications was carried out in 
a manner similar to that previously set forth. Duplicate determinations 
were Tuade on all samples of bituminous sand from the same bed. The 
corrected viscosities at 84*4*P. were found from the final viscosity- 
correction curve. From the average viscosity value of the two 
doteminetions the viscosity-temperature curves were constructed by 
interpolation frcsa the viscosity teruperature curves previously 
developed. The specific gravities at 77*F» were found directly from 
the viscosity-specific gravity relationship. Average specific gravity 
values were calculated for the duplicate determinations. 

determinations were mad© on fresh samples of bituminous 
sand from the following districts* bitumount, Kll’s Fiver, Kuth Lake 
and Abasand. Saaaples were taken fnm four distinct beds at Bitiamount. 
Throughout this work, the uppermost bed was referred to as Bltumoijuat 
Wo. 1, the lower bed as Bitumount Mo. 4 with the intermediate beds 
numbered in the correct sequence. 

Viscosity-correction curves were developed for ©11 oil 
samples with the exception of Ruth Lake oil. Confidence could not be 
placed in the corrected viscosity values from the Ruth Lake 


determinations

Care had to be exeroised to prevent air evaporation of 
light ends from the various bituminous sand samples, if large errors, 
between determined and actual properties, were not to result from the 
determinations*. Bituminous sand samples from Bitumount Mo. 1, 
Bitijimount No. 4, Ell*8 Fiver and Huth Lake were stored In air-tight 
sealers in order to prevent oil and water evaporation. Samples from 
the other beds were stored in 1 l/4 cubic foot sheet metal ‘carbide* 
cans with lids which were not entirely air-tight, the Film Method 
determinations on Abasand and Bitumount Ho. E, sampled from these 
metal containers, were carried out soon after the arrival of the fresh 
material. Therefore, it seems unlikely that any great error was caused 
by oil evaporation in these two cases. However, in the case of 
Bitumount Ho. 3 considerable tiiae was allowed to elapse before sampling 
for the Film ^iethod determination. Also, in this case the duplicate 
determination was made some weeks after the initial detercaination. 

Pram the two results obtained by these duplicate determinations, it 
was found that considerable oil evaporation was taking place from the 
metal container which held this bituminous sand. 

In order to arrive at a more accurate viscosity-ten^erature 
ourv© and specific gravity value for the oil contained in the samples 
of bituminous sand frcsa Bitumount Ho. 3, the follcswing procedure was 
carried out. The two corrected viscosity values determined for the 

* In this connection it is interesting to note that considerable 
evaporation does take place from bituminous sand oil even at room temp¬ 
eratures. Throughout the course of this work it had been observed that 
approximately 1000 cubic centimeters of oil with a viscosity of about 
1000 poises at 84.4®F. will Increase in viscosity 4 or 5 per cent over 
a period of about one month. All oil sasnples throughout this work 
when not in use were placed in air-tight sample bottles.

duplloata samples by the Film Method vrere now plotted against the 
time In weeks that had elapsed between sampling from the bed and 
sampling from the metal container* A straight line joining the two 
plotted values was extrapolated back to the time of sampling from the 
bed, Frcm this point the reoorreoted or actual viscosity was thus 
approxifiiately determined. This reoorreoted value was used in 
constructing the final viscoaity-temperature curve and in finding the 
correct specific gravity of the oil contained in this saTsple of 
Bituminous sand. 

Presentation^ Examination and Discussion of 0ata from 

Pete rminatione 

All the data for the various determinations are recorded in 
tabular form in the appexadix. 

Indices to the various Tables and Figures In this work will 
be found at the beginning of the thesis. 

The data that determined the ’change of vlsGosity with 
increase in percentage mineral matter* relationships, as shown in 
Figures 6 and 6, are recorded In Tables 1 and 12, The viscosity 
determinations are recorded in Table 1, while In Table 12 are recorded 
the ash determinations on these samples. 

An ©xainination of th© curves in Figures 5 and 6 Indicates 
the effect on the viscosity of adding centrifuge-extracted mineral 
matter to various oil samples, and the effect obtained by concentrating 
the mineral flatter in an oil saniple without removing the material from 
the oilT An examination of Curve H, Figure b, and Curve I, Figure 6, 
shows that the percentage increase in viscosity, for a certain mineral 
matter increase, is approximately the same in each case. These curves,

therefore, serve to Indioste that the j^erconta^e effect on the 
viscosity is the Same for samples with differing visoosity-tetaperature 
reletionahips• Cur\e G, Figure 5, indicates that the addition of 
oentrifuge-^xtraoted mineral matter to an oil sample, which has been 
axtraoted from bituminous sand with bensesie, effects the change 3ji 
viscosity ©t a different rate than when the same material is added to 
a hot water recovered oil sample. Curve J, figure 6, indioates the 
much smaller effect on the viscosity as a result of increasing the 
mineral matter in the oil sample by addition of an oil containing 
a high oonoentration of mineral matter* In this case the oil containing 
the high concentration of mineral matter has the same viscosity as 
the oil to which the mixture is added. 

A study of the above results indloates that during the 
centrifuging of the oil-bensene solution some bens®Jie-insoluble 
organic material was undoubtedly retained with the mineral matter. 

It can also be seen that the ’organic insolubles* appear to have a 
rather great effect on^v1.®cosity of the oil*. 

tm percentage effects on the viscosity caused by small 
amounts of mineral matter in bituualnous oil sample®, as calculated 
from Curve J, Figure 6, were used to correct for the mineral matter 
content in various oil sas^les used in connection with the vlseosity- 
correotion curve, fhe viscosity of these samples was adjusted to the 
mineral matter-free basis, flie viscosity values of the oil samples 
extracted from the various samples of bitualnous sand, prior to their 

* "The centrifuge-extracted mineral siatter on ignition gave a value of 
approximately 75 per cent. ash. F'roa this value and the curves of 
Figures 6 and 6, It was calculated that approximately 0.6 per cent, 
of ’organic insolubles* was removi^d from the oil by the centrifuging 
operation, and the removal of this faaterlal Increased the viscosity 
by about 15 per cent.

oorrootion by the viscosity-correction curv®, were also adjusted in 
the same way. This procedure put all the oil samples on a mineral 
matter-free basis and any errors which would bo caused by variable 
mineral matter contents were thereby eliminated. 

The data that are relative to the viscosity-temperature 
relationships of the various prepared oil samples, as shown in Figure 7,(foc^(efJ 
are recorded in Tables 2 and IS* In Table Z are recorded the viscosity- 
temperature data used in constructing the curves. TJie ash determinations, 
on each of the samples, are recorded In Table IS. 

The viscosity-temperature curves were found to have such a 
uniformity, that construction of a ccaaplete curve, by interpolation, 
from one known viscosity-temperature value of a bituminous oil sample, 
was made a simple procedure. An examination of the curves indicates 
that each is displaced, one from the other, a uniform number of units 
in the direction parallel to the abscissa. The variable mineral 
matter which the samples contained did not affect this uniformity of 
the curves. Also, the uniformity appears to hold good, not only for 
samples which were obtained by the hot water separation method, but 
also for those samples which were extracted by using benaene. From 
these facts it is readily seen that if the viscosity of the oil from 
a sample of bituminous sand can be accurately determined at a known 
temperature, the complete viscosity-temperature curve for the oil can 
be determined with confidence. 

The data that are relative to the preliminary viscosity 
correction curves, as shown in Figure 8 (curves A and C), are recorded 
in Tables 3, 4 and 14* In Table 3 are recorded the initial viscosity 
data for the various oil samples used in the determinations* In

Table 4 are recorded the vlsooeity data of the oil samplea obtained 
after recovery by the Film Method from the oil-benaene solution* The 
ash determinations on the oil samples after bensene solution and 
recovery are recorded in Table 1^* (The ash determinaticms on the oil 
samples before bensene solution were not determined, but are approx¬ 
imated 2*7 per cent.) 

The data that are relative to the preparation of the various 
samples used in the deteraination of the final viscosity correction 
curve are recorded in Tables 10 and 11* In Table 10 are recorded the 
data showring the effect of light ends on some of the prepared oil 
samples* These data are plotted in Figure 9* In Table 11 are recorded 
the data showing the effect of variation in heating time, at constant 
temperature, in the preparation of the more viscous samples that were 
used in the determination of the viscosity-correction cuxnre* These 
data are plotted in Figure 10* 

The data that are relative to the final viscosity-correction 
curve, as shown in Figure 8 and Figure 11, are recorded In Tables S, 6, 
IS and 16. In Table 5 are recorded the iidblal viscosity data for the 
various oil samples before bensene solution* In Table 6 are recorded 
the viscosity data of the oil samples recovered by the Film Method. 

The ash determinations on the oil samples before benzene solution are 
recorded in Table 15. The ash determinations after bensene solution 
end oil recovery are recorded in Table 16. 

Figure 8 indicates that the different procedures used in 
developing the viscosity-correction curves resulted in correction 
curves which were considerably different from one another. The curves 
which resulted from the various procedures appear to roughly parallel 


one-another

An analysis of the procedures used in the development of 
the visoosity-oorreotion curves indicates the reasons for the 
variation in the resultant curves# In the first case only 60 cubic 
centimeters of benseno were used to dissolve 80 grams of oil. All 
the mineral ?aatter present in the initial oil sample was also retained 
throughout the determination# Curve A, Figure 8# resulted from this 
procedure# In the second case SOO cubic centimeters of benijene were 
used to dissolve 80 grams of oil. All the mineral matter present in 
the initial oil was again retained throughout the test# However, this 
time the oil-benzene mixture was allcsnrod to evaporate at room temp¬ 
erature for one week until the voluisa of benzene present was equal to 
60 cubic centiiseters. The Film Method was now carried out in a 
manner which was similar to that used in the first case# It can be 
seen from curves A and C, Figure 8, that this change of procedure 
has resulted in an increase of approximately 24 per cent# in the 
viscosity of the oil recovered by the Film Method# fhis increase in 
viscosity was undoubtedly caused by a grea*^evaporation of oily 
constituents from the oil-benzene solution than was evaporated in the 
case where 60 cubic oentiraeters of benzene wex^ used to dissolve the 
oil*# In the third case the procedure was similar to that of the 
second case# In this instance, however, the oil-benzene solution 
was first put through the Dulin centrifuge before the air evaporation 
was started# This procedure removed approximately 86 per cent# of 

♦ The rate of evaporation of bituminous sand oil is increased, when 
dissolved in benzene, as the vapor pressure of the evaporating 
benzene balances part of the total pressure on the system. If the 
volume of benzene to be evaporated from the oil is increased, the 
amount of oil evaporated from the solution will also be increased 
as was found in these determinations#

the raineral laiatter which was in the initial oil sample. As noted 
earlier^ some of the material which was not completely soluble in 
the bensene was also quite possibly removed* As a result of the 
removal of these substances from solution, the final visoosity- 
oorreotion curve was again shifted. This shift was caused by a 
decrease in the viscosity of the recovered oil as compared with that 
recovered in the preceding case. Since curves B and C, Figure 8, are 
plotted on a mineral matter free basis, it can be seen that the 
removal of some of the organic insoluble material has resulted in a 
decrease of approximately 16 per cent.^ in the viscosity of the 
recovered oil.

An examination of the^visoosity^correction cu^ve^and 
relative data shew that the samples to which light end® were added 
make a distinct discontinuity in the curve and this appears to 
indicate that there is some intermediate fraction missing from the 
added light ends. Since the percentage error in these samples is 
much higher than it should be, it appears certain that some of the 
oily constituents, heavier than the light ends, were not recovered 
along with these lighter oils during the operation of evaporating 
the water from the oil that was used in these experiments. From an 
analysis of the water evaporation procedure this assumption appears 
to be borne out. 

The data that are relative to the viscosity-specific 
gravity relationships, as shown in Figure 12, are recorded in 
Tables 6, 6, 8 and 16. In Table 6 are recorded the initial viscosity

data for the various oil samples before beasene solution* In Table 
6 are recorded the viscosity data of the various oil samples which 
were recovered by the Film Method from the Oil-bensene solution. The 
data on the speoiflo gravity determiiMtions are recorded in Table 8. 
The ash determinations, used to correct the specific gravity determin¬ 
ations for the mineral matter present In the oil sanples are recorded 
in Table 16. 

An exaiaination of the two curves. Figure 12, obtained by 

•H^e viscosities of 

plottingKhot water recovered oils, and bensene extracted oils against 
the respective specific gravities at 77*F. referred to water at 77*F., 
indicates the change in the constitution of the oil brought about by 
the solvent extraction. It can be seen, that for the same viscosity, 
the specific gravities of hot water recovered oil samples are slightly 
greater than for oil samples bensene extracted. This is apparently 
diie in part to the removal of some of the ‘organic insolubles* during 
the centrifuging of the oil-bensene solution, and due in part to the 
retention of a small amount of solvent during the evaporation of the 
bensene from the oil. 

The data that are relative to the viscosity-temperature 
relationships of tVie oil samples from various bitiamlnous sand beds, 
as shown in Figure IS, are recorded in fables 7 and 17. In Table 7 
are shown the viscosity data on the oil sasiples recovered frasn. the 
Film Method. Also shown in Table 7 are the corrected viscosity data 
obtained by use of the viscosity-correction curve. The ash determin¬ 
ations, used to adjust for mineral matter present in the samples, 
are recorded in Table 17.

In Figure 14 ie shown a plot of the change of viscosity at 
84*4*F« and the change In percentage water content of Bitumount No. 3 
oil with storage tiaie in weeks. (The bituminous sand from this bed, 
as previously noted, was stored in a metal container which was not 
entirely air-tight.) The viscosity values of the oil samples recovered 
by the Film Method were corrected by the viscosity-correction curve 
before plotting them on this graph. 

The viscosity value used in constructing the viscosity- 
temperature curve for Bitumount No. 3 oil was determined from curve A, 
Figure 14. As previously noted this value was determined by extra¬ 
polation of Curve A to the time of sampling from the bitinainous sand 
bed. 

An examination of Figures 7 and 11 will indicate that it is 
a simple procedure to determine the viscosity-temperature curve for 
an oil sample recovered by the Film Method, the viscosity of the 
oil sample,after recovery by the Film Method, is used to determine 
the percentage error between this viscosity value and its true value 
at 84.4®F* This is aoocHapllshed by use of the correction curve. 

Figure 11. For example, if the viscosity of the recovered oil sample 
is 1000 poises at 84.4®P., then the percentage error ie positive and 
equal to 30 per cent. This percentage value of 1000 poises is 

300 poises. This figure is now subtracted from the viscosity 
value of the recovered oil to give a corrected viscosity of 700 
poises at 84.4®F. On the other hand, when the percentage error is 
found to be negatife the viscosity value corresponding to this 
error is added to the viscosity, at 84.4®F., of the oil recovered by

the Film Method. The complete viscosity-temperature curve is now 
derived from the visoosity-temperatur© relationships for altered oil 
samples. Figure 7, by simple interpolation. 

The data relative to the specific gravity determinations of 
the oil samples solvent-extracted fro^a samples of bitumirious sand 
obtained from various beds are recorded in Tables 7, 9 and 17. In 
Table 7 are recorded the viscosity data of the oil camples recovered 
by the Film Method. In Table 9 are recorded the specific gravity 
determinations on these samples. Also in Table 8 are recorded the 
correct specific gravities of the oil samples, as obtained frOT Curve A, 
Figure 12* The ash determinations used to correct the specific 
gravity deterailnations for the mineral matter present in the oil 
samples are recorded in Table 17. 

An examination of the viscosity-specific gravity relation¬ 
ship, Curve A, Figure 12, and the data from which the relationship 
was determined indicates that it is a simple matter to determine the 
specific gravity of an oil sample recovered by the Film Hethod after 
extracting the oil from a sample of bitisainous sand by use of benaene. 
The viscosity of the oil sample recovered by the Film J^ethod is 
first determined at 84.4*F. The correct viscosity at 84.4*F. is then 
found from the viscosity-correction curve. From this value, and by 
use of Curve A, Figure 12, the specifio gravity of the oil sample 
at 77*F., referred to water at 77®F., Is directly determined. 

An examination of the viscosity and specific gravity data 
recorded in Table 7 and Table 9 shows that in all cases, with the 
exception of Ruth Lake, the specific gravity values of the 
extracted oils from tlie various samples 



- 63 


of bituminous sand fall on the viscosity-specific gravity curve, as 
shown in Curve B, Figure 12, for oil samples recovered by the Film 
Method# The duplicate determinations, for the Ruth Lake oil recovered 
by the Film Method, checked very well with one another. It was found, 
however, that in this case the specific gravity value at 77*F. did not 
fall on Curve B, Figure 12. 

be al VeXf$£ihC6^ 

The reason Ruth Lake oil samples a or for that matter any 
other bituminous sand oils which may be at variance with the correction 
curves as developed in this work, appears to be the fact that the 
asphaltic constituents of tliese oil samples vary quite widely from 
the oil samples used in constructing the present viscosity-correction 
curve. Recent work by D.S# Pasternack, Research Council of Alberta, 
has shown the variation in some of the asphaltic constituents of oil 
samples from various bituminous sand beds. It has been found that 
the oily constituents, resins end asphaltenes may vary considerably 
from one bed to another. 

If the specific gravity of the oils as recovered by the 
Film Method falls on Curve B, Figure 12, it appears likely the viscosity- 
correction curve, as developed, will apply to the oils from various 
bituminous sand beds even though there may b® a slight variation in 
the asphaltic constituents of the various oil samples. It is highly 
probable that the general make-up of the oils from the bituminous sand 
beds which do fall on Curve B, Figure 12, is quite similar to the oil 
samples prepared from the main supply# This is to be expected for 
the Bitumount samples, for as mentioned previously, the oil from the 
main supply was recovered by hot water separation from bituminous 
sand taken from this locality. However, the fact that the specific 



54 - 


gravities of oil samples from Ell’s River and Abesand after oil 
recovery by the Film Method fall on Curve B, Figure 12, appears to 
indicate tJmit the viscosity-correction curve as developed in this 
work may apply to a wide variety of bituminous sand beds. On the 
other hand, since the specific gravities of Ruth Lake oil did not 
fall on Curve B, Figure 12, it seems quite possible that the general 
make-up of this oil is quite different from those samples which did 
fall on this curved. 

Frcxn an examination of the results obtained in this work 
and from the above discussion it can be seen that separate viscosity- 
correction curves would have to be developed for oil samples which 
are at variance with the viscosity-correction curve as developed in 
this work. The development of separate correction curves would be 
a necessity If accurate results are to be insured. In those cases 
where another correction curve has to be developed, it would be 
necessary to recover, by the hot water method, a supply of oil frcm 
the particular bitui^inous sand bed in question and then proceed in 
a manner similar to that already described. In this case, however, 
possibly S or 4 determinations would suffice to determine that part 
of the viscosity-correction and viseosity-specific gravity curves 
which would be of interest for the particular bituminous sand bed. 

In all probability, SLuy viscosity-correction or viscosity-specific 
gravity curves developed for beds which are at variance would 

* The history of this sample of bituminous sand from the Huth Lake 
area is not too well known. The sample was obtained during the 
Dcaainion Governinent’s recent well drilling program in that area. 

It seems possible that the sample may have been contaminated in some 
way. If this were the case, it may explain the rather disappointing 
results obtained from this bituminous sand.

Fr^th an examination of the viscosity-correction curve# 

Figure 11, the over-all possible error in determining viscosity values 
by this method was estimated to be approximately ^ 6 per cent, provided 
the oil samples are not at variance with the viscosity correction 
oiurve in question. The possible error was estimated from the maximum 
devi5?tlon of the values (exclusive of those derived from samples 
containing added light ends) which were used in plotting this 
viscosity-correction curve. 

In Figure 15 a temperature-specific gravity relationship 
for various oil samples and for water is plotted. The temperatures 
in degrees Fahrenheit are plotted as ordinates and the specific 
gravities at any temperature referred to water at 77®F. are plotted 
as abscissae. Curves A and B, Figure 15, were plotted from values 
calculated frcM data determined by K.A. Clark^^^^. These data were 
extrapolated as straight lines for a considerable distance. The 
extrapolated values, however, check quit® well with specific gravity 
data for heavy oils given by W.L. Melson^^*^). The specific gravity 
values for water were calculated from data originally taken from the 
Smithsonian Tables. 

From Figure 16, it is interesting to observe that for oils 
in the lower specific gravity range there are two temperature values 
above and below which the weight of a particular oil sample is greater 
than the weight of the water. Between these two temperature values 
the weight of the oil is less than the weight of the water.

In Figure 16 Is shown a viscosity-density relationship for 
those oil samples which were solvent extracted from samples of 
bituminous sand taken from various beds. The data to construct these 
curves were derived from the temperature-specific gravity curves. 
Figure 15, and the viscosity-temperature relationships of the oil 
samples solvent-extracted from various samples of bituminous sand, 
as shovm in Figure 13. 


Final Comaiente 

This experimental work, on viscosity measurement of oils 
from Alberta bituminous sand, was undertaken in conjunction with 
experimental ^^ork on the possibility of recovering oil from these 
deposits by means of an artificial water-drive. The water-drive 
experiments have indicated that water-flooding could be successfully 
used to recover oil, if the bituminous sand could be heated to 
moderate temperatures. Du© to the high viscosity of the oil and to 
the great variation in the viscosity over the extent of the deposit, 
a knowledge of the viscosity-temperature relationships of oils from 
various beds is ©specially essential in estimating the possibilities 
of economical recovery by water-flooding. For this reason 
considerable time and effort were expended in developing a method, 
and in determining, with scnae degree of accuracy the viscosity- 
temperature relationship curves for oils from a number of bituminous 
sand beds. 

The difficulties attendant on the determination of visoosity- 
te.perature relationships of the oils as contained in bituminous sand

beds were partially overOOTie by the development of a method which 
gives the correct viscosity values with fairly good accuracy. The 
procedure first involved the construction of a simple viscometer 
which gave reliable results within the eccuraoy desired. It was 
then necessary to determine the effect of small amounts of mineral 
matter on the viscosity of the oil samples to be used in the 
determinations. The viscosity-temperature relationships for various 
bituminous oil samples, which were In no way exactly representative 
of the oil contained in any particular bituminous sand bed, now had to 
be determined. Mext a method had to be developed for recovering the 
oil from an oil-benzene solution which would give viscosity values on 
recovered oil that checked on duplicate determinations. Such a 
method was finally found, after three preliminary attempts. The 
solvent evaporation method or Film l^^ethod, so developed, was used to 
determine preliminary viscosity-correction curves. It was found 
necessary to extend the procedure so that it would be identical with 
the procedure that would have to be used in the case of an actual 
solvent extraction of a bituminous sand sample. The extended Film 
Method procedure was now used to determine the final viscosity- 
correction curve as well as a viscosity-specific gravity relationships 
from which the correct specific gravity of oil samples could be 
determined. Duplicate oil samples were now recovered from various 
samples of bituminous sand by use of the Film Method. The viscosity 
values of the recovered oil samples were now measured at a certain 
temperature. From these viscosity measurements, the correct 
viscosities and specific gravity values of the oil samples were now 
determined at the same temperature frem the viscosity-correction 



- 68 


curve and the viscosity-specific gravity curve respectively. From 
the true viscosity values, the viscosity temperature relationships 
were determined, by interpolation, from the viscosity-temperature 
curves already developed for various altered oil samples. 

Evidence was found that in all likelihood th© correction 
curves, as developed In this work, would not apply to all samples of 
oil from the bituminous sand beds# It was believed that separate 
correction curves would bo necessary for those oil samples which 
differed very greatly from on© another in the relative proportions 
of th© asphaltic constituents which go to make up the oil# However, 
it was also thought quite possible that a simple relationship would 
exist between correction curves developed for those bituminous sand 
oils which wore at variance with on® another in this respect# If 
such a simple relation exists, the construction of a set of 
correction curves which would be applicable to oils from all 
bituminous sand beds should be a fairly simple matter.
