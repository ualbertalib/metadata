The aim of this investigation is to find 
out the values of certain local aggregates as con¬ 
crete materials, by making tests on mixtures de¬ 
signed by some of the most prominent theories. 

Thus, as well as learning something of the mater¬ 
ials used, experience with the methods of design 
will indicate to some extent Just how widely they 
may he applied, and what points in their use require 
special attention. 

The following pages give an outline and 
discussion of the recent proportioning theories, a 
description of the materials and methods and finally, 
the results and conclusions. 

CONCRETE AGGREGATE PROPORTIONING 

THEOR IES. 

Many theories have been put forward con- 
cerning the proper design of concrete mixtures. 

Most of the older theories were based on voids in 
the materials or density of the concrete, but newer 
theories and methods have supplanted these. It is 
interesting to note, however, that the voids theory 
has again appeared, within the last few months. 

Research work in recent years in the pro 
tio&ing of concrete aggregates has resulted in

1. THE FINENESS MODULUS METHOD, 

By Prof. D, A, Abrams, 

The first work done at the Structural Re¬ 
search Laboratory towards the finding of a method for 
determining proper aggregate proportions for concrete, 
was an investigation concerning the importance of the 
water content in the mix, A very large number of 
tests were carried out from which a curve was platted 
showing concrete strength against water-cement ratio. 

A curve of the form 

A 

S ; r - -gg- was obtained, where 
S - compressive strength of the concrete 
x = the water-cement ratio 

A and B - constants depending on the quality of cement, 
curing conditions, etc. This curve is shown in 
figure 1. 

The next step was to determine a function of 
the fine and coarse aggregates which would be suitable 
for use under all conditions and for all materials. 
Experimental work gave rise to a quantity known as 
the TT fineness modulus IT , In mathematical terms

where m is the fineness modulus, and d is tho diameter 
of the particle in inches. 

Tests then made, showed that increases in 
fineness modulus were accompanied by an increase in 
strength, up to a certain maximum value of the fine¬ 
ness modulus. For further increases the strength 
decreased. 

Prof. Abrams outlines the design of a concrete 
mixture in eight steps, given below. 

1* Knowing the compressive strength required of 
the concrete, determine by reference to Fig. 1 the 
maximum water-ratio which may be used. Subsequent' 
steps in the design of concrete mixes are only devices 
for securing a workable concrete using this water- 
ratio and a minimum quantity of cement. 

2 . Make sieve analysis of fine and coarse aggre¬ 
gates, using Tyler standard sieves of the following 
sizes: 100, 48, 28, 14, 8, 4, 3/8, 3/4, and 1-J- in* 
Express sieve analysis in terms of percentages of 
material by weight (or separate volumes) coarser tban 
each of the standard sieves. 

3. Compute fineness modulus of each aggregate by- 
adding the percentages found in (2), and dividing by 
100 . 


4 


Determine the "maximum size" of aggregate by 










5 


applying the following rules: If more than 20$ of 
aggregate is coarser than any sieve the maximum size 
shall he taken at the next la.rger sieve in the stand¬ 
ard set; if between 11 and 20$ is coarser than any 
sieve, maximum size shall he the next larger "half¬ 
sieve”; if less than 10$ is coarser than certain sieves, 
the smallest of these sieve sizes shall he considered 
the maximum size, 

5 0 From Table 1 determine the maximum value of fine¬ 
ness modulus which may he used for the mix, kind and 
size of aggregate, and the work under consideration, 

6, Compute the percentages of fine and coarse 
aggregates required to produce the fineness modulus 
desired for the final aggregate mixture by applying 
the formula: 


A-B 

p = ioo T^r 


a * * * $ 



Where p s percentage of fine aggregate in. total mixture, 
A s fineness modulus of coarse aggregate, 

B s fineness modulus of final aggregate mixture, 

C a fineness modulus of fine aggregate, 

7, With the estimated mix, fineness modulus and 

consistency enter Fig, 2 and determine the strength of 
concrete produced by the combination. If the strength 
shown by the diagram is not that required, the necessary 
readjustment may be made by changing the mix, con¬ 
sistency or size and grading of the aggregates, 

Tne quantity of water required can be determined

This formula takes account of all the factors 


which affect the quantity of water required in a concrete 

mixture. These factors may be classified as follows: 

1* "Workability" factor, or the relative consistency 

of the concrete® 

2. Cement factor, which is made up of two parts: the 
quality of cement so far as normal consistency is 
concerned (p); the quantity of cement in the mix 
(n). 

3i The aggregate factor. This includes the three 

terms within the parenthesis in Equation 4. The 
first term, involving (m), takes account of the 
size and grading: the second (a) the absorption, 
and the third (c) the water contained in the 
aggregate. 

Tables and charts based on the foregoing simplify 
considerably the design of a mix.

2. A LOGICAL SCHEME -FOR DETERMINING THIS 

VALUE OF AVAILABLE AGGREGATES Hd"TTS 
PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO'mE~ TRQBUCTIQN 
OF CONCRETES OF PER PATERA I NED QUALITY 
IN TgE FIELD* 

BJ- Prof. G• M• Williams 0 
This method depends wholly upon laboratory 
tests. In a paper by Mr® Williams, published in the 
May, 1921 number of the "Journal of the Engineering 
Institute of Canada," he proposes that the work be 
carried on in three steps:- 

No ® 1.- Divide the material from any source of supply 
on the No® 4 or the screen. .Prepare concretes hay¬ 
ing the same cement contents and flowabilities, varying 
the relative quantities of sand and gravel in the separ¬ 
ate batches. Four or five fine-coarse aggregate com¬ 
binations should be employed such as 3-7, 4-6, 5-5, etc. 
If material is available from more than ono source, 
similar combinations should be used for each. All tests 
should be fully comparable as to cement and cement con¬ 
tent, flowability, and other conditions. The same 
tests should be repeated if possible with other cement 
contents and flowabilities. In general two cement 
contents and two flowabilities should be sufficient to 
establish the best fine-coarse aggregate gradation and 
also determine the best source of supply® 

Ho. 2»- In step Ho. 1 the desirable fine-coarse aggre¬ 
gate ratio was determined. Under Step Ho. 2 concretes 
are prepared with varying cement contents which will 
give concrete strengths throughout the ranges employed 
in practice for wet and dry consistencies® Arrange 
these results in diagrammatic form, showing the re¬ 
lations between compressive strengths, cement contents 
per cub yard of concrete, volume of cement and fine 
and coarse aggregate. 

No.5.- Owing to variation in brand and quality of 
cement, inaccuracies in measuring aggregate volumes, 
differences in flowability from batch to batch, and 
variation in curing conditions it is not to be expected 
that concretes produced on the job will be as uniform 

in quality as those of the laboratory from which the 
wording diagram is originally devised. Therefore, it

is likely that a systematic method of sampling and 
testing of field concrete under uniform inspection 
conditions will indicate corrections and modifications 
which should he made to the original diagram. After 
a few applications to field work a. revised diagram 
may he prepared which will insure production in the 
field of concretes equal or slightly superior to those 
assumed in advance. 

Quoting from Technical Paper No, 58, of the 
U. S. Bureau of Standards, prepared under the direction 

of Mr. Williams,- 

"The relative compressive strength of concrete 
to he obtained from any given materials can he de¬ 
termined only hy actual teart of those materials com¬ 
bined in a concrete.”

TT MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION ”. 

by A. P. Mills. 

Proportioning concrete aggregates hy the method o 
surface areas is based on a combination of the methods 
of Prof, Abrams and Mr, Edwards# Use is made of the 
Abrams water-cement relation and Mr. Edwards 1 re¬ 
commendation that concretes be proportioned as the 
ratio of one gram of cement to a given number of 
square inches of surface area of aggregates. He found 
that all mixes having this ratio the same, were of 
equal strength# The practical work by the Com¬ 
mission has demonstrated the fact that water content 
to give mixes of constant mobility varies with the 
surface area of the aggregate. Hence, it follows 
























.) 








9 


that to maintain constant strength, and therefore a 
fixed ratio between water and cement, the cement must 
also vary with the surface area of the aggregate. 

Since the concrete must be of certain consistency for 
the job in which it is to be used, the water-cement 
ratio is fixed® The concrete strength required defines 
the ratio of cement to surface area® In the proport¬ 
ioning of a mix then the cement-surface area relation 
only need be considered® 

For any proposed aggregate, tables are made up 
showing the relation of strength to water-cement ratio 
and of cement-content to surface area, for normal or 
1*00 consistency® Any other consistency Is obtained 
by changing the water and the cement proportionately* 
There are a number of ways of determining the 
surface area but the original method used by Mr® 

Edwards is still considered to be the best® A sieve 
analysis is made dividing the particles into their 
respective sizes® Using the specific gravity, and 
assuming the particles to be spheres, the size and 
surface area of an average particle may be found® 

From this and the count of the grains of each size, the 
surface area is determined® Surface area is usually 
expressed in square feet per 100 pounds of aggregate®

A PROPOSED METHOD OP ESTIMATING 
TEE DENSITY AND STRSN&TH OP CON- 
GRETE AND OP PROPORTIONING THE 
MATERIALS BY THE E&tERIMENTUT 

and Analytical consideration op 

THE VOIDS in MORTAR AND CONCRETE, 


by Prof. A*11.Talbot* 

The following paragraphs from Prof. Talbot T s 
paper given before the American Society for Testing 
Materials, outline some of the principles and in¬ 
dicate something of the methods. 

"1. For a given amount of cement per unit of vol¬ 
ume of concrete in place (the quality of the cement 
and the quality and nature of the aggregate remaining 
the same, but the gradation of the aggregate varying), 
the greater strength is found in a concrete that has 
the smaller amount of voids and a lesser strength in 
one having the larger amount of voids (the voids being 
taken as the space occupied by the water and air). A 
definite relation exists between the amount of the 
voids and the strength of the concrete. The percent¬ 
age of voids may, therefore,be taken as an index of 
the strength of the concrete. ,T 

”2* For different amounts of cement and different 
gradations of the aggregate (the quality of the cemeiit 
and the quality and nature of the aggregate remaining 
the samef, the strength of the concrete varies with 
the ratio of the amount of cement used in a unit of 
volume of concrete to the voids in this volume ( or 
the reciprocal of this ratio may be used), and the 
strength may be taken to be a function of this cement- 
voids ratio. A relation with is found to be still 
better is that between the strength and the ratio 
found by dividing the absolute volume of the cement 
by the sum of the voids in the concrete and the ab¬ 
solute volume of the cement, which may be termed the 
cement-space ratio." 

"3. If the amount of mixing water be varied in 
such a way as to change the bulk of the concrete, 

1/he strength will be still a function of the cement- 
voids ratio of the resulting concrete, though the 
function may differ from that which applies at 
another water content." 
























11 


"4. For the usual concrete mixtures the hulk of 
the coarse aggregate is less than the hulk of the 
concrete, or, in other words, the hulk of the mortar 
in a given volume of concrete is greater than the voids 
in the coarse aggregate alone (using the term mortar 
to include the. cement, fine aggregate, and water). 

For such mixtures the voids in the concrete may then 
he considered to he made up of the water and the air 
voids in the mortar. The density of the mortar for 
the consistency used in the concrete is, therefore, 
an important factor in determining the strength of the 
concrete. ?T 

TT 5. If the amount of the water and air voids in 
the mix of mortar to he used in making the concrete 
is known (using the term mortar to mean the combinat¬ 
ion of cement, fine aggregate, and water which enters 
into the concrete), the voids in a resulting concrete 
may he calculated and the corresponding cement-voids 
ratio or cement-space ratio may he used as in index 
of the strength of the concrete.” 

”6. By determining the voids in mortars made with 
a given fine aggregate hut with varying proportions 
of cement, a characteristic mortar voids curve giving 
the relation between the mortar voids and the ratio 
of fine aggregate to cement may he made up for any 
given fine aggregate, and information will then he 
available on which to base calculations for voids 
and strength of concrete made with definite proport¬ 
ions of cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, and 
water. ,T 

TT 7o By determining the voids in various mortar 
mixes made with different fine aggregates of the same 
character and thus obtaining characteristic mortar 
voids curves of the given fine aggregate, comparisons 
may he made of the relative densities and probable 
resulting strengths of concretes made up with these 
mortars and with assumed volumes of coarse aggregate.” 

”8. Knowing the characteristic mortar curve of a 
fine aggregate, (the general nature and quality of 
the aggregate otherwise being known), the proportions 
of the mix required to give a specified strength 
(including the amount of cement, fine aggregate and 
coarse aggregate) may he calculated with a fair degree 
of accuracy.” 

”9. The foregoing principles and methods are most 
readily applied by the use of the absolute volumes of 
the cement, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate; hut

if the voids in the fine aggregate and in the coarse 
aggregate in a dry state or in the condition obtaining 
on the work are known, or the relation between the 
weights of the aggregate by bulk and by solid volume, 
the bulk of the fine aggregate and of the coarse aggre¬ 
gate required to make a unit of volume of concrete 
may be readily determined from the absolute volumes 
given by the calculations already referred to/' 

"10• If the mixture is such that the voids in the 
aggregate are not fully filled by the mortar, the 
mortar voids will not be the measure of the voids in 
the concrete; but if the voids in the concrete are 
known, the ratio of the cement to the voids in the 
concrete will still be an indication of the strength of 
the concrete, except in the more extreme cases," 

"11o The amount of voids in a specified mix of 
metfar may be used to determine the acceptability of a 
given fine aggregate," 

"12, The method may be used to design the mix of 
the concrete whatever the amount of cement used and 
whatever the ratio of eo,w se aggregate to fine aggre¬ 
gate, though when the mortar does not fill the voids 
in the coarse aggregate this feature must have 
consideration," 

"13, In making the mortar test of a fine aggregate, 
the voids should be determined for increasing amounts 
of mixing water. The amount of water that gives the 
minimum volume of the mortar (greatest density and 
least voids) may be termed the basic water content. 

The characteristic mortar voids curve made up from 
values of the voids for minimum volume of mortar may 
be termed the basic characteristic mortar voids curve. 
The basic water-content permits a very good consolid¬ 
ation of the ^articles of the mass when put into the 
mold; more water wells the mixture, as it also adds 
to the mobility of the mixture. For other water con¬ 
tents , giving the wetter consistencies, such as for 
example a 1,20 basic water content, characteristic 
mortar voids curves may be made up from the voids ob¬ 
tained with the specified water content ratios in the 
tests already made. If a larger amount of water than 
the basic water content is to be ttsed in the concrete, 
the characteristic curve for that proportionate water 
content should be used in the calculations, Generally, 
for the consistencies used in concrete work, the water 
content will range from 1,10 to 1,40 times the basic 
water content,"

ANALYTICAL TREATMENT. 

"Knowing the void properties of the mortar 
the application to the concrete mixture may he made 
by analytical considerations. The following notat¬ 
ion will he used: 

a s absolute volume in fine aggregate in a unit of 
volume of freshly placed concrete; 

h - absolute volume of coarse aggregate in a unit 
of volume of freshly placed concrete; 

c =3 absolute volume of cement in a unit of volume 
of freshly placed concrete; 

d - density or solidity ratio of the freshly placed 
concrete; 

v m » voids (air and water) in a unit of volume of 

the mortar or mixture of cement, fine aggre¬ 
gate and water as It exists in the concrete, 

v - voids in a unit of volume of the concrete. This, 
of course, will be equal to 1 -d*

1, R. B, Young, 

of the Hydro-Electric Power Commission, 
of Ontario, 

from " Canadian Engineer ”, No v . 1919, 

The work done hy the Hydro-Electric Power 
Commission was first to establish a relation between 
the fineness modulus and surface area methods. Curves 
showing fineness modulus against surface area for 
widely varying aggregates were constructed and the 
points were found to fall practically on a straight 
line. 

That the water varies as the Surface area for 
constant flowability, is forthcoming from the U e S« 
Bureau of Standards and Profo A. N* Talbot, besides 
the Hydro-Electric Power Commission. Very similar 
curves for the relation between compressive strength 
and water-cement ratio have also been obtained by 
Profso Abrams and Edwards, the U* 3, Bureau of 
Standards and the Hydro-Electric Power Commission. 

The shortcoming of the fineness modulus method 
is that it is dependent absolutely on the number and 
sizes of sieves used in its determination. The 
surface area method is not so dependent, any series of

commercial sieves "being suitable. The surface area 
is a property of the materials, over which, the sieves 
have no control. 

Investigations of the Hydro-Electric Power 
Commission have lead to three conclusions 

(1) That the fineness modulus is hut another 

and somewhat approximate method of defining the surface 
area | 

(2) That within the range of workable mixtures, 

both the ’’strength" and the "water required to bring a 
mixture to a uniform degree of plasticity" vary with the 

surface area. 

(3) That there is a fixed relation between water- 

cement ratio and strength for mixtures of the same 
cement, same aggregate and same age. 

8 # Prof* Williams, 

from " Canadian Engineer 0 " January, 1920. 

Prof* Williams has certain faults to find 
with the fineness modulus surface area methods* He 
claims that both methods disregard the basic fact that 
concretes to be comparable must have the same flow- 
ability. He belioves that there is no mathematical 
relation between the fineness modulus and surface 
area and that, therefore, Mr. Young’s conclusion, that 








16 


they are dependent, is erroneous* 

Objections to Surface Area Theory 0 

(1) The water formula proposed in the surface area 
theory reduces to a constant water-cement ratio for any 
fixed relation of cement to surface area of aggregate* 

(2) The important property of surface area, does not 
enter into the determination of the quality of mixing 
water, except in so far as it fixes the quantity of cement 
at the beginning, 

(3) The formula is not only incorrect in theory, but 

is inadequate in practice, and results in mortars and con- 1 
cretes varying widely in consistency, which are, there¬ 
fore, in no sense comparable on the basis of strength* 

(4) Tests indicate that compressive strengths in¬ 
crease as the ratio of cement to surface area decreases, 
although such increase is by no means proportional to 
the decrease of the ratio# 

Objections to fineness Modulus Theory * 

(l) The foundation of this theory is a water formula 
which gives no consideration to the varying water re¬ 
quirements of aggregates varying in surface areas# 

(2) It is shown that, with a given fineness modulus, 
the total surface areas of aggregates of different 
gradings may vary as much as 600$. 

(3) In spite of this 'wide difference in surface 











t

a 








17 


areas, it is claimed that resulting concretes of the 
same mix will have the same consistency. 

(4) Tests have shown that the consistencies actually 
obtained varied more than 25% with the above constant 
conditions, and such "ifTerences were measurable by all 
known consistency methods as well as apparent to the 
eye. 

(5) The strengths obtained in tests of such con¬ 
cretes are not comparable, since the condition of equal 
consistency admitted as necessary and fundamental by 
the proponent of the theory, cannot result. 

( 6) The addition of any factor to the water formula 
to properly take into account these varying water re¬ 
quirements, destroys the constant water-cement relation 
which is the criterion for equal strengths. 

(7) The strength results given in Table 2, Lewie 
Institute Bulletin ho. 1, would seem to discredit the 
surface theory as advocated hy Mr. Edwards. However, 
these tests are not competent to either deny or affirm 
that theory, since equal consistencies were not ob¬ 
tained. The strengths of the concretes would be con¬ 
siderably modified by the addition of sufficient water 
to result in equal consistencies.

In connection with the tests of the fineness 
modulus and surface area theories as carried out "by 
the U. S. Bureau of Standards, Prof. Ahrams has two 
objections to the way in which the tests were carried 
out • 

(l) Slump tests were made on 5 T 'x6 T? cylinders which 
were very unsatisfactory. 

( Z) The majority of the aggregates used were either 
too coarse or were of freakish grading unsuitable for 
use with the fineness modulus method. 

His objections to the surface area method are 
as follows 

(l) The areas of the finest particles of sand 
cannot be computed. 

{ Z) Crushed aggregate requires a greater quantity 
of water for the same grading than pebbles of a spher¬ 
ical form. 

(3) If the surface area method were strictly in¬ 
terpreted it would require separate treatment for 
practically each kind of aggregate. 

(4) The method requires laborious computations 

with the resulting chance of error. 

(5) It is not clear how the method can be applied 
to the simplest problems, for instance, to determine 

the best proportions of given fine and coarse materials

for a concrete mixture. 

(6) Theoretically there is no reason why the 
surface area method should give more nearly correct 
results than any other method. 

That the relation which Mr 0 Young found to 
exist between the fineness modulus and surface area 
is not true for graded aggregates is shown by the 
following theoretical demonstration:- 

Let 8 s surface rea of the total aggregate. 

m = fineness modulus of the aggregate. 

S 0 = surface area of aggregate size between 
the Nos. 200 and 100 sieves, 

and p p p - quantities falling between the 

various sieves. 

Then _S_ - S 0 ( +.£;) 

Op. * lp, -> 2p^-. np„ „ 

From this it ia seen that for a given value of 
8 an infinite number of sets of values may be found 

for p,p,p -. Prof. Abrams points out that for 

aggregates having the same fineness modulus variations 
in surface area up to 600$ occurred. He also calls 
attention to an investigation by Mr. Earle Pettibone 
on the amount of water required to wet the surfaces 
of sand particles. It was found that a twentieth of a 


pint of water was sufficient to produce free water in 






D 





20 


G 



20 


1 cubic foot of standard Ottawa sand* The water then 
required to wet the surfaces of concrete materials is 
negligible and this is the only factor which has any 
bearing on the surface area of the particles* 

4, Prof* Talbot, 


from American Society for Testing Materials * 

Vol* SIX po 491, 


Tests carried out by Prof, Talbot indicate the 
following:- 

(l) Por an aggregate haying a given maximum size 
of particles the amount of water required to produce 
a concrete of a given consistency is equal to a 
constant plus a term which is dependent on the surface 
area* The smaller the maximum size, the more water 
is required* 

( 2) The strength of concretes made up to have the 
same mobility are dependent upon the surface area 
within the range of practical workability* 

Mr. Talbot in his tests uses what he calls a 
"surface modulus”, determined from the formula 








This quantity is found to be proportional to 

the surface area, p p etc. being the quantities

between the various sieves*

Abram T s fineness modulus he gets a similar expression 
hut with different coefficients 

m st p + 0*9 p + 0.8 p +- +0.1 v . 

from which he deduces that the fineness modulus 
Jives undue emphasis to the larger particles if it is 
to he used in any way proportional to the surface 
area for any well graded aggregate. 

Concerning the water requirements. Prof. 

Talbot considers that more satisfaction is obtained 
when design follows the surface area method. 

5. GENERAL . 

In Prof, Williams 1 discussion of the fineness 
modulus and surface area methods he emphasises the 
point that flow results which he got on duplicating 
a number of Abrams 1 and Edwards 1 mixes, were very 
unsatisfactory and that, therefore, their results 
were not of much value. In reading his articles 
the writer has been lead to believe that there is some 
confusion in the distinction between the terms 
"flowability" and "consistency TT . Plowability is simply 
a measure of the plastic state of the concrete. 
Consistency is a measure of the water content of a 
mix in terms of the water required to produce normal 
consistency, for example, 1.25 consistency means that 
the mix contains 25 fo more water than is necessary to 







T - 


0 , „ 


r: ' 






give the state known as normal consistency. Where 
Prof. Abrams makes such a statement as "mixes of 
equal consistency" it is thought that Prof. Williams 
interprets it as "mixes of equal flowability*" 

In the S. A. method he objects to the water 
formula which he reduces to the same form as Abrams* 

s k, and also he objects to the fact that the sur¬ 
face area enters the computations only in connection 

with the cement and not with the important factor, 
the water. Ee seems to lose sight of the fact that 
the water is dependent on the cement and that there¬ 
fore the surface area controls the water content. 

Eis objections to the fineness modulus 
method may be reduced to two: - 

(1) Inadequate water formula. 

{ 2) Unsatisfactory method of describing an aggre¬ 
gate by a fineness modulus not depending in any way 
on the surface area. 

On the side of the surface area. Young, 
Williams, Talbot and Edwards are arrayed against 
Abrams who believes that the surface area is not of 
importance. 

The relation established by the Hydro-Electric 
Power Commission between the fineness modulus and 
surface area was shown by Prof. Abrams to be untrue. 





















































23 . 

but the point brought out by Young in that the fine¬ 
ness modulus is dependent on certain sieves is of 
some importance. 

The water requirements for the two methods are 
opposed, Prom work he has done. Prof. Talbot believes 
that design of the water-content by surface areas 
is the more satisfactory. 

Prof. Abrams 1 objections to the surface area 
method saem to be well founded though consideration 
of the fine material as cement does away to a large 
extent with the first one. 

The original method of computing surface areas 
seems to the writer, to be somewhat in error® Bus 
to the fact that the sphere contains the greatest 
volume for the surface area, any variations in 
shape increase the area for the same volume. 

Considering the particles as spheres would give 
a value lower than the true surface area® Por a 
pebble or gravel aggregate the error would be smaller 
than for crushed rock. 

While the surface area seems plain and straight¬ 
forward, the same cannot be said of the fineness modulus 
method. It seems difficult to realise Just- what 
significance the term "fineness modulus' 1 has, and why 
it acts as Abrams claims it does® 



A study of Prof. Williams 1 method shows Its 


simplicity. It gets away from numerical computations 
and yet the complexity of the problem makes it appear 
doubtful if any successful treatment of general appli¬ 
cation will be found without some mathematics in¬ 
volved. In his scheme there is one doubtful point 
and it is in the determination of the desirable aggre¬ 
gate gradation. It seems for results covering a 
considerable range that in the first series of re¬ 
sults two or more desirable aggregate gradations might 
be found as easily as one. Even if one set of proportions 
only were obtained for the desirable gradation it seems 
obvious that this combination 'would not be best for rich 
and lean mixes alike. 

This method is of narrow application in that 
the whole procedure must be carried through for ail 
the possible combinations of the materials available. 

The new method of Prof. Talbot seems as reason¬ 
able and sound as any so far advocated. Complete tests 
not being yet available the theory can hardly be 
criticised on the same standard as the other 
methods. Eis result is a development of the old 






25. 

maximum density and least void theory, and is the 
direct successor to a method of mortar voids advocated 
by a French engineer about thirty years ago. 

There is considerable computation necessary 
but the experimental voids determination has only to 
be gone through once for each material® 

From this study of proportioning theories 
two methods were selected by which to investigate 
the materials at hand. The two methods chosen were 
those of Abrams and Williams. They seemed to cover all 
tho points quite comprehensively, the one fx^om a some¬ 
what theoretical treatment, the other in a more 
purely practical way.

MATERIALS♦ - 

Tlie materials on which the investigation was 
carried out were obtained from the Engineering Depart 
ment of the City of Edmonton* There were two fine 
aggregates and one coarse one* The materials were 
taken directly from the storage bins ana were in the 
same condition as found on the ;job. A description 
of the materials making up the concrete follows. 
lo The Water* - 


Water from the city mains was used in all 
mixes* The average temperature was about 20°C© The 
salts present in the water are about as follows:- 


Calcium Gaxhonate 
Magnesium 11 
Calcium Sulphate 
Sodium Chloride* 


6*43 grains per gallon. 
4*16 " f? 

4*66 ti * n 

0.18 " l? " 


2* The Cement. - 

The cement used for the magority of the test 
cylinders was made by the Edmonton Portland Cement 
Co*, Marlboro, Alta* The stock of this cement ran 
out and as more of it could not be procured, Canada 
Brand Cement was used for the remainder of the 
pieces* 


The cement was tested according to the 1920 
tentative standards of the American Society for 
Testing Materials. The results of the tests were 


as follows:-

In each case the neat cement gave high strengths 
and the mortar low ones* From this it would seem that 
the bond between the cement and the sand was not as 
good as it should have been* 

Pats of neat cement remained sound through the 
boiling test but when stored in moist air, pats showed 
shrinkage cracks and slight warping* 

An ignition test of the cement showed a loss 
of sis and one-half { 6i~) per cent. Phis is a very 
high loss and considering the high neat cement strengths 
might indicate that the cement was very high in lime* 

It seems unfortunate that this cement was 
used but the preliminary tests showed it to be the 
best of a number of samples taken from different 
shipments. Ho Marlborough cement was available and 
the writer was obliged to use the best which could be 
immediately obtained. 

3. The Fine Aggregate* - 

At the time the materials were taken from 
storage the two sands in principal use were from pits 
along the Athabasca Line of the G.H.R.; one of them, 
commonly known as "silver Sand" coming from J. 

Watson 1 s pit at Perryvale, and the other known as 
"Artie Sand" from J. Bullman f s pit at Rochester. 

The Silver sand has a better appearance than the 








29 


other* It is lighter in color and does not contain 
as much silt or vegetable matter. The Artie sand, 
however, has the coarser grading. 

Miscroscopic examination shows that both sands 
are of quartz with fairly well rounded grains. The 
Artie sand has fine particles of clay and organic 
matter clinging to the grains, while Wat son f s looks 
fairly clean. A considerable quantity of coal is 
present in Bullman’s sand, and these lumps become 
pulverized and sptread all through the batch when 
mixed. There is also a coating of iron oxide on some 
of the grains of Bullman®s sand. It is probably this 
which causes it to be so dark in color, but it was 
not thought to be present in large enough quantities 
to affect the strength. There is also some free iron 
oxide in the sand. 

Colorimetric tests, for the organic material 
present, were made and were about as would be expected 
from the appearance of the sands. The "Silver Sand" 
showed a straw color slightly deeper in tint than 
the standard color solution. A deep cherry red was 
given by the "Artie Sand" and in one trial the liquid 
above the sand looked very similar to crude petroleum* 

Though the city is mainly concerned with highway 
construction, these sands are also in general use in 







30 


building work* 

The average grading which follows is in each 
case the mean of six (6) sieve analyses of different 
samples.

4. The Coarse Aggregate. -» 

The coarse aggregate was obtained by the City 
from the Huff Gravel Go., who operate a washing and 
screening plant at their pit about 55 miles west of 
Edmonton on the G.N.R. The gravel is screened, all 
fine material being wasted and all over two inches 
{ 2’ ? ) being crushed and deposited in a separate hopper, 
//hen a car is loaded one end may be filled from the 
hopper containing ordinary pit material, while the

other may corne from the crushed rock hopper which 
contains very little fine material except crusher 
dust. The result on the job is a coarse aggregate 
containing pockets of material which vary from a fine 
pebble aggregate to a coarsely graded crushed rock. 

All materials are washed and appear clean 
except for the crusher dust and hard clay lumps which 
cannot be distinguished from the pieces of rock them¬ 
selves except by close observance. 

The composition of the aggregate is extremely 
varied. The principal material is quartzite, but 
quartz, ironstone, flint, sandstone, limestone, trap 
and granite, are also present. All peicee are of 
good quality and, excepting the clay lumps, are not 
structurally deficient. 

Owing to the non-uniformity of the material; 
it was felt by the author that to cover the range 
liable in practice it would be necessary to investi¬ 
gate mixtures containing the extremes of the aggregate. 
For this reason the tests were carried out using the 
pebble material and the crushed rock as separate 
aggregates. 

The grading of each.which follows, is in 
each case the average of four (4) analyses:-

.'/hen taken from storage the materials were 


covered with snow and on exposing to the atmosphere 
in a w§rm room this became free water. The materials 
were stirred up and allowed to dry, and in this con¬ 
dition were incorporated into the mix. Samples im¬ 
mersed for three (3) hours in water showed no gain 
in weight so it was decided that the exposure was not 
long enough to cause any but the surface water to pass 
off. 


IlffTHODS.- 

Frorn the examination of the theories given 
above, it was decided to investigate the materials 
using two methods, Abrams 1 "Fineness Llodulus Method" 
and Williams' "Proportioning from a study of the

Aggregate. f In. order to cover a wide enough range 
to give fairly comprehensive results, two flowabilities 
and three strengths were fixed upon 0 In all then, there 
were two fine aggregates, two coarse aggregates, three 
strengths and two flowabilities. 

The combinations of materials, strengths, and 
flowabilities to give the desired results are illustrated 
below*

(c) Strengths: 

{ d) Flowabilities: 

For one fine aggregate and ope coarse it was 
seen that six (6) sets of test pieces were required* 

For the two fine and the two coarse aggregates then 
twenty-four (24) sets were required and with four (4) 
cylinders per set the total number of cylinders for 
this method was found to be ninety-six (96)*

i?or one sand and one gravel then, the cylinders 
required were seen to be seventy-six (76) and for two 
fine and two corase aggregates we would need four times 
as many or three hundred and four ( 304.) 

On account of the large number of cylinders 
required by Williams* method, and the lack of time, it 
was felt that both theories could not be used and so 
Williams 1 method was dropped. 

Strengths and consistencies used in design were 
as follows

In accordance with standard practice, 1200, 
2000 and 3000 lbs. per square inch at 28 days. 

( 2) Plowabilities: 

Of approximately 150 and 190, measured by 
means of the flow-table. These flowabilities were chosen 
as representing plasticities desirable for mass work 
and for building construction. 

The mixtures were all designed according 
to the steps laid dovn by Prof. Abrams, The 
necessary data, for use in design, are given above 
in the discussion of the fineness modulus theory. As 
an example of the method the following design is

Using Silver Sand (P*M. s 2.78) 
and pebble aggregate (F.M. - 7*07). 

We desire 2000 lbs* concrete of fairly dry 
consistency.

laid down by Prof. Abrams we find that the maximum 
size of the pebble aggregate is 1J-".

This design is that of set ho. 17 in table

hollowing the design of the mix, quantities 
of fine and coarse aggregates were weighed out to 
yield somewhat more than enough concrete for the cylinders 
required. The sand entered the mix as taken from the 
pile but the coarse aggregates were screened into the 
different sizes and recombined for each mix. The 
weighed aggregates, in the proper proportions, were then 
thoroughly mixed in a galvanised iron mixing pan and 
the volume measured, Prom the volume of mixed aggre¬ 
gate and the proportions of the mix, the volume of cement 
was found. Considering a cubic foot of cement to 
weigh 94 lbs a, the amount of cement, by weight, was de¬ 
termined. The cement was added to the mixed aggregate 








38 


and mixed in until the whole was a uniform color* 

Tlie water, determined from the volume of the cement and 
the water-cement ratio, was then added* When thoroughly 
mixed, consistency or flowability measurements were 
made with the flowtable and the slump cone* The con¬ 
crete was then placed in the forms. Consistency measure¬ 
ments were also made on the hatch just before the last 
cylinder was filled. Any concrete left over was 
weighed and wasted* 

The following figures show the quantities used 
in the mix designed above

For the first ten sets, four cylinders per set 
were made but this was reduced to three for the remainder 
owing to lack of time. The forms used in making the 
cylinders were of galvanized iron, in flanged sections 
which bolted together. All cylinders were six inches 









39 


in diameter by twelve inches high (6" x 12"). The 
concrete was placed in the forms in three layers of 
about 4 inches each, each layer being rodded with 
twenty-five (25) to thirty (30) strobes of a five- 
eighths inch (5/8 ,T ) steel rod pointed at the end. The 
forms were set on plate glass, and neat cement mixed to 
a stiff plstt was used as a cap on the bottom of the 
cylinder to give a good bearing surface for the testing 
machine and to eliminate as much as possible leakage 
of water from the concrete in the forms. Two to four 
hours after mixing the tops of the cylinders were also 
capped with neat cement. 

Twenty-four hours after mixing the forms were 
removed, the cylinders were numbered, weighed and 
placed in water where they remained for twenty-eight 
days. The range of temperature during storage was 
from eighteen (18) to twenty-four (24) degrees centi¬ 
grade. 

At the end of the storage period the cylinders 
were tested by means of a Riehlb universal testing 
machine, the breaking load only being noted. The 
load, was applied with the machine running at the 
slowest speed, such that idle the crosshead moved 0.05" 
per minute. The bearing plates of the testing machine 








40 


were placed directly in contact with the ends of the 
cylinders, no cushioning material whatever 'being used. 
RESULTS.- 

following the lines as laid down above, the 
various combinations, designed wholly by Abram 1 * method 
were made up into test cylinders, stored for twenty- 
eight (£8) days, and then broken. 

The particulars of each mix, with regard to 
design, plasticity, and strength are shown in table 2 
at the end of the report. 

There are a number of variations from the 
course outlined and the reasons for them will serve to 
illustrate some of the points which come up in the 
design of mixtures by Abrams 1 method. 

In the first place, the first four (4) sets 
were designed somewhat at random. A low fineness 
modulus was used and mixes resulted having very large 
proportions of sand. The strengh of design was in¬ 
tended to be twelve hundred (1200) pounds per square 
inch, but an error in the water-cement ratio used, in¬ 
creased the consistency obtained and decreased the 
strength to the value shown. The breaking strengths 
of these four sets indicate to some extent the com¬ 
parative strength values of the sands. 


Throughout the curves and diagrams following. 






41 


the points representing these mixes will, in many 
cases, fall outside the range of those of other 
mixes* 'This is due to tho fact that these sets were 
almost mortars and required very much more water than 
the other sets. 

The strength of design of three other sets, 
numbers five (5), seven (7) and twenty-two ( ZZ) were 
also altered by mistakes in the water-cement ratio. 
Owing to the difficulty of getting satisfactory tests 
on the second cement used, a one percent, error in the 
normal consistency used in the last three sets caused 
the strength of design to increase to about thirty-one 


hundred (3100) pounds per square inch. 

The realisation of the desired flowabilities 
also presented some difficulties. The lower limit, _io.. 
approximately one hundred and fifty (150), was obtained 
with fair satisfaction, hut the wetter mix was diffi¬ 
cult to control. At flowahility one hundred and 
ninety the concrete is in such a plastic state that a 


very small change in the water content causes a large 
change in the plasticity. Due to this fact, 
consistencies varied from one and one quarter (l.~ 
to one and thirty-five one -hundredths (1.35) the flo■/ 
in a number of cases was very much ovei one i.u~. 




42 


and ninety. However, as it was not necessary that 
this consistency he really obtained no wet mixes were 
repeated to correct the flowability. 

Before giving the curves and diagrams showing 
the consistency results, a few points concerning the 
methods by which the plasticity results were taken 
are worthy of mention. 

A few preliminary trials were made with the 
flowtable in order to see how the concrete behaved ..hen 
subjected to the motion given by the crank and cam. 

A thin layer of hardened concrete had gathered on the 
table and it was a question as to the manner and extent 
of its influence on the flow. It was found that the 
movement of the concrete was a rolling motion. At 
each jar the top of the pile flowed out towards the 
edges, there being practically no sliding of the con¬ 
crete over the surface of the table. The table was 
then cleaned thoroughly and on the smooth surface 
the roiling was altered to sliding. At each jar the 
top of the pile settled down thus forcing the lower 
edges to slide out over the table. The effect of 
cleaning the table gave a rather remarkable increase 
to the flowability. Concrete having a flow of one 
hundred and eighty-five (185) on the uncleaned table, 

gave values up to two hundred and thirty (230) on the 



( 






. 






clean galvanised iron surface. In order that con¬ 
ditions might be constant for all flowability measure¬ 
ments, the table was moistened before each trial* 

Another point, noticed later, was the effect 
of an air cushion between the wooden table top and 
the galvanised iron cover. In dry mixes no effect was 
noticeable but in certain wet mixes it caused an 
appreciable increase in flow* When the action due to 
the crank: had ceased, or nearly so, the air cushion 
shoved the iron cover up away from the wooden top, 
causing the concrete to flatten out on the table* The 
mechanics of the flov/tabie seem considerably involved 
and the author thinks that there are a numbor of other 
things which all have an effect on the spread of the 
concrete* 

The slump cone requires little comment, it is 
well known and universally used* However, there were 
a few points which cams up in its use that should be 
noted. 

When the form is withdrawn the concrete may 
slump down in a proper manner, or it may, and often 
does, topple over sideways, the whole top breaking Cxf 
It is suggested that the method of filling the form 
may have something to do with this* If the concre-j 
is shovelled in from the same direction in filling 







U.-JU 


the form, considerable segregation takes place, giving 
a pocket of coarse material at one side and fine at the 
other* Rodding alone do qb not get over this diffi¬ 
culty , and frequently on removing the form the mass 
tumbles over sideways* 

Shovelling the material into the form from 
all directions and then rodding, resulted in a more 
nearly homogeneous mass, and little trouble was 
perienced in obtaining satisfactory trials. 

In the tests made on the first four (4) sets 
and some others rich in fine aggregate, the slump 
test did not seem to fairly represent the plastic 
condition of the mix* The sand seemed to act as a 
binder and when the form was removed very little slump 
took place* 

The diagrams following show the results ob¬ 
tained from the flow-table and slump cone, and also 
illustrate the different results obtained from the 
mixes containing the different coarse aggregates* 

G QNSIS TBUGIBS * - 

The first diagram, fig. 9*, shows the 
plasticity measurements for all mixes. The flow, 
in per cent, increase of original diameter, is plotcd 
against the slump, in per cent, of original height. In 
the higher values the points cover a fairly wide range 
but at the lower end they are fairly close. I- is

here that the superiority of the flowtable shows up. 
?or a slump of up to ten (10) per cent., about one and 
one quarter (!£■) inches, the flowtable gives a range 
of about thirty (30) per cent., or approximately two 
and one-half (2-J-) inches, .Then we consider that the 
proper consistency for most concrete varies from about 
one hundred and fifty-(l50) to one hundred and ninety 
(190), or two hundred (200), we see that this 
iority of the flowtable within this range, is of con¬ 
siderable importance. The flowtable also gives less 
divergency in results for continued trials on any one 
mix, 

The next two diagrams, figs. 10 and 11 show 
the relation of flow and slump to the amount of water 
presen t in the mix. The points are very scattered 
and no very great advantage is apparent for either 
method. However, a study of the points shows that 
the flowtable becomes sensitive at a lower water con¬ 
tent than the slump cone and that, therefore, is pre¬ 
ferable for use with dry mixes. 

It will be noticed from these curves that the 
water contents of the mix for equal flibwabilities and 
for equal slumps are very different for the two types 
of aggregate. Separate diagrams, figs, 12 and 13,

have bean made up to show this relation. The points 
are here also somewhat scattered but a line may be 
drawn separating the points for each aggregate. In 
each case, both for slump and flow, a big advantage 
of the pebble material is brought out. To obtain 
the same flowability in mixes containing the dif¬ 
ferent aggregates much more water is required for 
the crushed rock mix than for the pebbles. The 
latter then must be the more economical , bepjause_ 
u sing less water., less c ement is require d for con¬ 
crete of the same strength. 

The plasticity or consistency results dis¬ 
cussed above bring out two points, one with respect 
to the methods and the other to the coarse aggregates 
employed. They may be briefly explained as follows:- 

(1) Of the methods of measuring consistency in 
the laboratory, the flowtable is slightly superior to 
the slump ccne. 

(2) Of available aggregates, the rounded grain 
or pebble aggregate is more economical than crushed 
rock consisting of angular pieces, owing to the 
fact that the desired strength and plasticity may be 
obtained with less water and, therefore, with a 
saving in cement. 




















s TRK1TGTHS • - 


. 7 . 


The strength results obtained from the tests 
are in accordance with Abrams 1 design. The curves are 
very similar to his. The first one, figure 14, cor¬ 
responds to his figure 1, Bulletin 1 of the Structural 
Materials Besearch Laboratory. It shows the com¬ 
pressive strength against the water-cement ratio and 
is practically identical with his curve which is shown 
dotted on the figure. The next ones, figures 15 and 
16, show the relation between fineness modulus and 
compressive strength. Owing to the fact that the 
mixes came out to odd ratios such as 1:6.3 the points 
plotted cover a considerable range. For the pebble 
aggregate the nature of the range at the upper end 
shows that for further increases in the fineness modu¬ 
lus smaller increases take place in the strength. On 
the other hand for the crushed rock the relation is 
still apparently nearly a straight line. 

Figure 17 shows the relation between the mix 
and the consistency for the different strengths. Three 
straight lines are obtained, one for each strength and 
all nearly parallel. 

It is astonishing that the.results obtained 
are so close to the strengths for which they were 
designed. The per cent, variation from the strength

of design is fairly small in all tut a few cases. 

Set number seventeen (17) shows the largest variation. 
The strength of design here was two thousand (2000) 
pounds per square inch while only thirteen hundred and 
ninety (1390) pound concrete was actually obtained . 
The trouble in this mix was its plasticity. It .was ' 
designed for a consistency of one and one tenth (1.10) 
and was found to be very dry. As shown by the table 
above, there was absolutely no slump for any of a 
number of trials. On the flowtable it gave a flow 
of one hundred and fifty-five but this does not re¬ 
present its true State of plasticity. Under the 
flowtalle test the concrete did not give the ordinary 
movement, but at each jar a little concrete at the 
top crumbled off and fell down around the lower edge. 
It was thought that a flowability of about one hundred 
and twenty-five (125) would more nearly represent the 
state of the concrete. On account of the dryness, 
the cylinders were far from satisfactory. They were 
rough on the outside and contained small air voids, so 
the strength results were low. 

Other large variations are those of sets 
six (6), seven (7), ten (10), twenty (20) and twenty- 
one (21). The largest variations in these sets are 
on the safe side but two of the sets designed for 





49 


twelve hundred pounds per square inoh fell twenty- 
five (25) and ywenty (20) per cent, below design. 

Just why this happened is difficult to say. Both 
mixes were fairly dry showing a slump of only one- 
eighth (l/8) of an inch and a flow of one hundred and 
forty-seven. They were both fairly plastic and 
smooth mixes but seemed a little too rich in sand. 
However, this should not cause such a decrease in 
strength. 

All the other mixes show smaller variations 
each way from design strength. Within the sets them¬ 
selves the cylinder strengths were fairly uniform, 
the divergency in results between the extreme cylinders 
in a set rarely running over ten (10) per cent. 

Sets twenty-four (24) to twenty-eight (28) 
inclusive were made with the second and poorer cement 
and the strengths obtained were considerably lower 
than the mixes using the good cement. The strength 
of these mixes were adjusted so that the average for 
all three thousand (3000) pound mixes v, s the seme 
as for sets twenty-one (2l! t twenty-two (22) and 
twenty-three (23), which were made with the good cement. 
To adjust the low strengths three hundred and twenty 
(320) pounds was added to the strengths of each of the 
last five mixes. 













50 


It now remains to consider the actual strength 
values obtained. They will first be considered from 
the point of view of ascertaining differences due to 
fine aggregates, then differences due to coarse 
aggregates and finally, the total results as an in¬ 
dication of the value and accuracy of the method of 
design* 

The accompanying table shows the strength 


values of the tests from the point of view of ascert¬ 
aining the values of the sands.

TABLE 3. ~ 

These figures show that there is considerable 


difference in the results for the sands. There is about 
20$ between the average strengths for mixes designed 
for equal strengths. The Silver sand falls consistently 
from six to nine per cent, below the strength of design 
for all tests made, while the mixes containing Arctic 
sand were about 15$above, except in the case of the 
three thousand (3000) pound concrete. Here, they fell 
down somewhat but are still very close to design strength. 
























51 


It would seem from these results that some 
propperty, or properties, of the Arctic sand was 
erufficient to more than balance up for the excess of 
organic material which it contained over the Silver 
sand. A glance at the grading shows that it is 
somewhat coarser than the silver sand, and, if they 
were equally clean, a slight increase of strength would 
be expected to result* However, when such an increase 
shows up in all the tests it leads to the question as 
to just hov; much faith can be placed on the eblor test* 
From these tests it would seem that in this sand, the 
dark color was given by substances which had little, 
if any, harmful effect upon the concrete. 


A table similar to that shown above has been 
set down for the coarse aggregates.

the average obtained is 2220V • For the three 

thousand (3000) pound concrete there is little dif¬ 
ference between the results which are slightly under 
design strength. From these figures it is apparent 
that as far as strength results are concerned there 
is little to choose between the two materials. 

Of the average results of all the mixes little 
need be said. They are remarkably close to the values 
for which they were designed.

YIELD.- 

From the quantities of materials used in the 
mixes and the quantities of concrete resulting the 
yield of the materials has been computed. Yield is 
here considered as the ratio of the volume of con¬ 
crete to the volume of aggregate in the concrete. The 
tables following show the yield results.

For the fine aggregates there is very little 
difference in yield. Each material is high for one 
strength and for the third strength they are equal. 

Por the coarse aggregates the crushed rock 
gives slightly higher values than the pebbles for all 
three strengths. 

In general, it may be seen that the yield in¬ 
creases as the strength or richness of the mix in¬ 
creases. Por low strengths and lean mixtures a re¬ 
adjustment of the particles seems to take place when 
the aggregate is incorporated into the concrete mix, 
and the resulting volume of concrete is less than 
the original volume of aggregate. On the other 
hand in rich mixtures the larger quantity of cement

seems to cause an increase in volume and therefore gives 
a larger yield. Prom the mixes designed and tested 
in the investigation 2000 lbs./sq. in. would appear 
to he about the strength at which tho volume of the 

Concrete equals the volume of the aggregate contained 
in it. 

From these results it would appear that 
■ l '£Q'£ 9 Abrams has developed a method of designing con¬ 
crete which is remarkably accurate and of wide 
application. In order to give a more detailed dis¬ 
cussion of the method from the experience gained in using 
it f each step will be taken in the order in which they 
are given above. 

The first step is as follows:- 

1 ’Knowing the compressive strength required 
of the concrete, determine by reference to figure 1, 
the maximum water-ratio which may be used. Subsequent 
steps in the design of concrete mixes are only devices 
for securing a workable concrete using this vater¬ 
ratic and a minimum quantity of cement.' 1 From this 
statement it would appear that the first thing to do 
when designing a mix is to look at fig. 1 and deter¬ 
mine the water-ratio to use for the desired strength. 

This is hardly correct as the curve is derived from 
a series of tests and depends to some extent on the 




















55 


various factors which enter into the work. On this 
account where any factor, or factors, change, a very 
similar and yet different curve is obtained. If the 
wording of this step were strictly interpreted, the 
formula which he gives later would not be required to 
give the water-ratio. The writer thinks that figure 1 
is given as an illustration of the for-: of curve which 
results from tests but was not meant to be used in the 
general design of mixtures* 

The second step deals with the sieve aiialysis 
of the aggregates to he used and this is straightfor¬ 
ward enough* The only point is that he specifies 
which sieves shall he used. Any difference in sieve 
sizes gives a difference in fineness modulus, and there¬ 
fore, a change in grading and in water-cement ratio* 

Steps three (3) and four (4) are straightforward 
hut in step five (5) it seems that a slight modificat¬ 
ion might he made. . In the table which goes with 
step (5) it says that for crushed rock consisting of 
angular particles a reduction of 0*25 should he ma.de in 
fineness modulus. This was followed in all crushed 
rock mixes, and almost all of these mixes appeared to he 
too rich in sand. However, no other change in reduction 
of fineness modulus was made and so no data were obtained 
with respect to this point* 





56 


The last steeps laid down are easily followed, 
and no difficulty was experienced with the formula 
used in determining the water-cement ratio* 

All of the mixtures proved very satisfactory. In 
no case was there a harsh mix and all were of a fair 
plasticity except one set, number seventeen (17). A 
few seemed somewhat rich in sand hut the crushed rock 
was very coarse and the large amount of sand may have 
been all or nearly all needed. 

Without experience in dealing with the method 
some difficulty would be found in designing mixes to give 
desired flowabilities. The flow depends on three 
things:- 

(1) The shape and size of the particles of the 
coarse aggregate. 

, (2) The proportions of the mix. 

(3) The consistency of design. 

These three factors work together and an 
accurate estimate of the flow which will result can 
only be obtained from data collected from work already 
done. 

The aggregates used admit of comparison only 
with each other. In the case of the two sands we have 
one of them giving results about as desired and the 
other one giving results slightly low. The first one.

Arctic Aand, contains considerable organic matter, but 
this is either of a harmless nature or else it is 
counteracted by the grading which is fairly coarse* The 
Silver sand is finer and cleaner but does not give so 
great strength, probably due to the difference in 
grading. 

Between the coarse aggregates there is very 
little choice so far as strength is concerned. As 
pointed out in the consistency results, however, the 
pebble aggregate possesses a real advantage over the 
crushed rock in that less water and therefore less 
cement is needed with it to give the same strength and 
fiowability. A disadvantage of the crushed rock is 
the large proportion of sand which must go with it to 
make up a mix. Since these coarse aggregates are from 
one material as used on the job modification would 
have to be made in order to keep the sand-gravel ratio 
correct, when removing the aggregate from the pile to 
the mixer. 

QOSTq- 

In figuring the costs of the concrete per cubic 
yard, general prices for the materials used were ob¬ 
tained. Prices for the opening of the 1922 season for 
materials delivered to the job were as follows:-

The cost of one cu. yd of each mix was com¬ 
puted and is shown in Table 2. An allowance of $1.25 
for mixing and placing was added to the cost of the 
materials. 

The following table shows the average costs of 
the concrete containing the different coarse aggregates, 
and also the average costs for the different strengths.

The average cost figures have been plotted 
with the strength in fig. 19. 

The costs of these mixes are considerably lower 
than the costs being obtained on the job. Some allowance 
is necessary for the different conditions but the figures 
show that even after considerable allowance has been 
made these mixes are still considerably cheaper than 
those being obtained in the fi-MA* Besides this, the 
strengths desired here were obtained while in a great 
many cases on the job it is not even approximated. Two 
thousand (£000) pound concrete costs, on the job, from

about $12*50 up and usually it turns out to be nearer 
twelve hundredttaJi two thousand pound concrete. 

A glance at Table 2, shows that the ordinary 
1:2:4 mix is approximately what was obtained here for 
two thousand (2,000) pound concrete* The volumes of fine 
and coarse aggregates are, however, modified to suit the 
other conditions of the mix*. 

RESUME * 

Summing up the results obtained from the tests, 
we have:- 

{1} Eor Consistencie s 

(a) The flowEable is slightly superior to 

the slump cone for plasticity tests* 

(b) To give the same flowability or slump, 
less- water is required for a mix containing well rounded 
pr pebble aggregate, than is necessary when crushed 
rock is used* 

( 2) Eor Abrams 1 Method of Design* - 

(a) Some difficulty is experienced in ob¬ 
taining desired flowabilities, but this should easily 
be overcome with experience in using the method* 

(b) Great accuracy as to strengths shows 
the reliability which may be placed on concrete designed 
by this method and correctly mixed*

( 3) For the Pine Aggregates* - 

(a) Of the two fine aggregates Arctic or 
Bullman’s sand gives the higher strength, and although 
a color test shows much organic material present, the 
strengths are slightly on the safe side of design. 

( b) The Silver sand falls slightly "below 
design strength over the whole range of tests although 
giving a much more favorable color test than Bullman's 
sand. 

(4) For the Coarse Aggregates. ” 

(a) The finer or pebble aggregate although 
not possessing any advantage in strength is more econ¬ 
omical than the crushed roch "because less water is 
needed to produce the desired consistency and a 
saving in cement results. 

( 6) For Ylfeld of the Materials« - 

(a) Little difference in yield is shorn 
between the fine aggregates. 

(b) Of the coarse materials crushed roch 
gives the larger yield. 

(o) In general the yield increases with 

the richness of the mix. 

( 6) For Costs of the Concrete.- 

(a) For changes in strength the cost 
follows approximately a straight line, increasing with 
the strength.

(b) Costs of these mixes are shown to be 
less than those being obtained in practice, aside 
from the fact of the greater reliability which 
may be placed on them. 

Indications of increased activity in con¬ 
struction have resulted already in bringing a number 
of new materials onto the local market® There are 
now about eight sands and nearly as many coarse 
aggregates, all from different sources. Of their com¬ 
parative values as concrete materials practically 
nothing is known and before they come into wide use 
they should be examined and tested. 

The fine aggregates almost all give a dark 
color test, but the results found in this investi¬ 
gation show that work should be done along this line 
to determine the value which may be placed on this 
test. A study of the economy resulting from washing 
the materials would also be of importance. 

Besides the ordinary fine and coarse aggre¬ 
gates there are a number of pit-run materials available. 
These require less handling and, if resets were carried 
out on them, would probably prove more economical 
than ordinary materials under some conditions. In¬ 
vestigations of the sand-gravel ratio, of the strength 








62 


and mix most suitable for the natural grading, and 
of the advisability of modifying the grading, are some 
examples of the problems which remain to be carried 
out in connection with these materials* 

This gives some idea of the size of the 
problem. Complete tests would require years of work 
but in order that some useful data may be on hand 
a systematic method should be adopted and carried out. 
Then when the need becomes pressing, at least a good 
beginning will have been made*
