ABSTRACT 


Growth and survival of root nodule bacteria in 
soil and humus cultures were studied by means of plate counts 
and respirometric methods. Screw capped glass jars were 
more satisfactory than cardboard cartons for packaging of 
seed inoculation cultures and mineral oil added as a 
sticker and preservative was not detrimental to growth and 
survival. The effect of various inorganic nutrient 
elements and sucrose was also studied. In general, any 
particular element stimulated growth only if the level 
of that element in the soil used as a base was below optimum. 
Nitrate and sucrose stimulated growth when either was used 
alone, but both used together greatly depressed growth. 
Respiration measurements on sterilized soils 
inoculated with Rhizobium meliloti showed that oxygen uptake 
was roughly proportional to soil organic matter content. 

The addition of plant residues greatly increased oxygen 
uptake, alfalfa having a greater initial effect than straw.

INTRODUCTION 


The function of the root nodule bacteria as 
agents of fixation of atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis 
with leguminous plants has been known since 1886, and the 
value of leguminous crops to mankind has been known for 
many thousands of years. All of the ancient civilizations 
of the old and new worlds knew of legumes and used them 
in their agriculture. Even more primitive peoples such as 
the Swiss Lake Dwellers left evidence of the use of peas 
and beans among the ruins of their villages, evidence which 
was found long after they had vanished as a people. 

As time went on the importance of legumes in 
any planned system of farming became more and more evident. 
Prom the time of the Romans onward, except for the time 
of the decline of all knowledge during the Dark Ages, 
anyone making a study of good farming practices was aware 
of the value of legumes as human food, livestock fodder 
and soil improver. However, it was not until the early 
part of the nineteenth century that the methods of scientific 
investigation were far enough advanced to be brought to 
bear on the problem, and it was not until after nearly one 
hundred years of investigation and sometimes acrimonious 
controversy that the difference, as regards nitrogen sources, 
between the Leguminosae and other plants, and the role of 
the root nodule organisms, was established.

Once it was definitely established that the 
microorganisms were necessary for the fixation of atmos¬ 
pheric nitrogen, research divided itself into two general 
classes# The first was the practical application of the 
new knowledge to farming practices; the second, pur© research 
on the morphology, life history and biochemistry of the 
bacteria, including the formation and structure of the 
nodule, the relationship between host and bacteria, and 
the mechanism of the fixation process® Research on the 
practical applications at first outstripped that on the 
other phases, and in the early part of the twentieth 
century a most voluminous literature on the inoculation of 
legumes in the field, on different types of inoculation 
cultures, and on requirements for growth and survival of 
the bacteria, accumulated® Later on, after satisfactory 
seed inoculation cultures and methods of using them had 
been made available, work was concentrated more and more 
on the mechanism of the process of biological nitrogen 
fixation® As new chemical and physical methods of investiga¬ 
tion became available, the intermediate steps in the fixa¬ 
tion process have been made more clearly visible, until 
there can now b© discerned the first vague outlines of 
possible mechanisms of fixation® However, the outlines 
have failed to stand out with a great deal of clarity, even 
in a general manner, and this has been especially true for

the symbiotic nitrogen fixing organisms* 

Nevertheless, while the investigation of the 
fixation process has been carried on, work on the practical 
applications of the problems has been found necessary* The 
existing inoculation cultures, while vastly superior to some 
earlier ones which have appeared and been discarded, have 
been found to require improvement* The problems of contamina 
tion, of maintenance of the moisture content and of aeration 
have been found to be paramount in the production of an 
inoculum which would supply a sufficient number of viable 
organisms for good inoculation of the seed to which it was 

applied* In addition, the survival of the organisms from 

, 

year to year under field conditions has been found to be of 
vital importance to perennial legume crops* 

This investigation has been concerned with the 
development of an improved legume inoculation culture, which 
would maintain a large number of viable organisms longer, 
in a form convenient for handling* The study of factors 
influencing the growth and survival of the root nodule 
bacteria in these cultures has been continued, and a study 
of the growth and survival of these organisms in field soils 


has been started*

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Sine© the discovery in 1888 by Hellriegel and 
Wilfarth, as reviewed by Fred et al (24) of the relation¬ 
ship between the nodules and the leguminous plant, and its 
bearing on the ability of legumes to fix atmospheric 
nitrogen, a voluminous literature on the subject has 
accumulated. Beijerinck, as reviewed by Fred et al (24) 
isolated the organisms responsible for root nodule forma¬ 
tion in 1888, and since that time the mass of papers has 
become so great that a brief review of the entire subject 
is impossible. Fred et al (24) have reviewed the literature 
prior to 1932, and Wilson (85) has dealt with the bio¬ 
chemistry of symbiotic nitrogen fixation as it was under¬ 
stood in 1939* The literature on growth and survival of 
rhizobia, and the development and use of legume inoculation 
cultures has been reviewed by Hedlin (31) though his review 
deals largely with the older papers* 

It is proposed here to review the papers published 
In the last twenty years insofar as is possible, referring 
to older papers only when necessary to preserve the contin¬ 
uity of the subject* 

(1) Occurrence of Rhizo bia in Soils 

In 1930, Wilson (80) made a study of the seasonal 
variations in the numbers of Rh« leguminosarum and Rh»

trifolii in field soils. There was a wide variation in 
numbers of both species, depending on the treatments 
received by the various plots. On acid soils, numbers were 
as low as one in five grams of soil. On other soils, 
numbers rose as high as 100,000 per gram* In general 
numbers of Rh. trifolii were higher than numbers of Kh* 
leguminosarum especially on the acid soils* There was a 
fall in numbers of both species during the winter, with 
an increase in the numbers as the temperature rose in the 
spring* 

Wilson (81) continued this study in 1951, using 
the same dilution method of counting, and again found that 
Rh* trifolii was present in larger numbers than Rh* legumino ¬ 
sarum* He was unable to relate this phenomenon to pH, 
moisture content or seasonal variation, except on the very 
acid soils, but thought there might be some connection with 
the type of inorganic salts present. 

V/alker and Brown (78) used Wilson*s (80) dilution 
method to study the relationship between numbers of Rh* 
meliloti and Rh* trifolii and soil management practices. 

They found that: 

(a) Numbers depended on previous cropping and 
fertilizer treatment history of the soil. 

(b) Numbers were larger when clover or alfalfa was 
grown every third year than when legumes were not grown, 

and also where alfalfa had been plowed up a month previously.

(c) The condition of the soil with respect to organic 
matter, lime and phosphate had a greater influence on 
numbers of rhizobia than did frequency of growth of the 
legume hosts. 

(d) Manure, limestone, crop residues or rock phosphate, 
alone, or especially in combination produced large populations 
of rhizobia. 

(e) Recommendations for inoculations should take into 
account the cropping and soil management history of the land. 

Thorne and Brown (63) continued these studies in 
1937 and obtained similar results. They found that legumes 
promoted a more stable flora of rhizobia and nitrite forming 
organisms. They found that number of nitrite formers 
reached a peak in the spring, but that no such peak existed 
for rhizobia. Finally, in 1946, Appleman and Sears (10) 
made a study of nodulation on the Morrow plot soils, and 
again found more root nodule bacteria on the fertilized 
plots, especially where the appropriate legume was grown. 

They also concluded that the bacteria were spread readily 
in barnyard manure, but that wind action played very little 
part in disseminating the organisms. 

From these papers, it would appear that rhizobia 
can survive very easily as free living organisms in the soil, 
under proper conditions, and that "natural” processes for 
spreading the organisms are usually very slow.

(2) Nodulation and Cross-Inoculation Groups. 

Originally the root nodule bacteria were thought 
to constitute a single species, infecting all leguminous 
plants# Later workers found a certain specificity of action 
whereby certain strains of organisms appeared to infect 
some species of legumes but not others, and in 1932 Fred, 
et al (24) listed a number of 11 cross-inoculation groups”, 
as determined by numerous earlier workers, in which the 
root nodule bacteria were divided into species on the basis 
of their power to form nodules on particular species of 
legumes, one species of rhizobia infecting a smaller or 
larger group of legume species# 

However, it has become obvious that the problem 
is not so easily settled# Allen and Allen (3), Wilson, 

Burton and Bond (86), Kroulik and Gainey (43), Nutman (55), 
and Burton and Allen (16) all found more effective nodula- 
tion and, especially, nitrogen fixation by certain strains 
of a given species than by others# Newton and Wyatt (53) 
emphasized the need for the use of effective strains of Rh# 

1eguminosaru m in the inoculation of peas grown on grey 
wooded soils# In addition. Burton and Allen (16) found 
that if crimson clover ( Trifolium incarnatum ) was inoculated 
with a mixture of strains of Rhizobium trifolil , some effective 


and some ineffective, a large percentage of the nodules were 
from the ineffective strains* However, the initial inoculation

was shown to be the important one* Later inoculation, after 
nodules had been formed, showed no effect when either 11 good 11 
or "poor” strains were used. Kroulik and Gainey (45) were 
interested in a possible correlation of resistance to infection 
by Rh * meliloti with resistance to Phytomonas insidiosa, the 
alfalfa wilt organism* « They found no correlation between 
the two, but found a highly significant difference in the 
performance of different strains of Rh. meliloti with respect 
to inf activity, and found that strains of both plant and 
bacteria were important* 

The work of Nutman (55) at Rothamsted is of parti¬ 
cular interest. In a study of "effective” and "ineffective” 

* 

strains of clover nodule bacteria he found no evidence of a 
change in ”effactivity” due to plant passage, but found that 
storage in the soil (a Woburn sandy soil) seemed to cause 
the production of a large number of ineffective variants of 
effective strains* In view of the present popularity of 
humus cultures for legume inoculations, his results appear 
worthy of careful consideration. Similar variants occurred, 
but far less frequently, in effective strains stored as 
stock cultures on agar slants. 

The appearance of strain variation complicated the 
theory of cross-inoculation groups, and further work indicated 
that the trouble was far from over. Carroll (17) found 
nodulation outside-the cross-inoculation groups, and con¬ 
cluded, after a study of forty-one legume species from

fourteen genera, that "the present day conception of, and 
practices in, legume group inoculation are illogical and 
unsound and should he revised." Wilson, Burton and Bond 
(86) found that certain species and certain strains of 
legumes and bacteria gave erratic nitrogen fixation perform¬ 
ance, but suggested that the carbohydrate-nitrogen relation¬ 
ship in the host plant was responsible. Appleman and Sears 
(8), however, found nodulation between cross-inoculation 
groups, and J. K. Wilson, (82, 83), cited five hundred 
instances in tilich a plant could be assigned to more than 
one cross-inoculation group. He suggests that from the 
scientific standpoint, the boundaries of the groups over¬ 
lapped so much as to be useless for species differentiation. 
Prom a practical point of view, it would appear that, while 
Wilson’s viewpoint may be somewhat extreme, attention to 
"effective” and "ineffective" strains is very important in 
the preparation of legume inoculation cultures. 

(3) Legume Seed Inoculation 

Once the existence and functions of the root nodule 
bacteria were recognized, it was soon realized that the 
bacteria were not native to all soils, and steps were taken 
to establish in soils originally deficient in the organisms, 
a population of the desired species of bacteria. 

The soil transfer method, in which greater or 
smaller amounts of soil known to contain the desired organisms

were spread over the field to he inoculated, was Introduced 
by Salfeld (as reviewed by Fred et al (24) )• Because of 
the inconvenience and labor involved, this method was soon 
replaced by others in which the bacteria were applied 
directly to the seed* Of these early methods, the most 
successful consisted of simply dusting the seed with soil 
containing rhizobia. Various modifications were less 
successful* 

Nobbe and Hiltner (as reviewed by Fred et al (24) ) 
first introduced pure culture inoculants, in which the 
bacteria were grown on the surface of a jelly medium and 
applied either directly to the seed or to a small amount of 
soil* 

The use of moist soil was introduced by Simon 
(as reviewed by Fred et al (24) ). A pure culture of the 
desired species of rhizobia was grown in sterilized soil* 
Since that time the use of this type of culture has been 
extended until it is used almost exclusively* A number of 
workers made studies of the effectiveness of these cultures, 
and nearly all arrived at the general conclusion that the 
medium used was a suitable habitat for the rhizobia, and 
that it oould be conveniently used to inoculate the seed* 

In addition, Albrecht (1) tested a dry soil culture, which 
he found to be unsatisfactory* Fellers (25) studied three 
types of commercial cultures, agar, liquid and soil and

muck cultures. He made plate counts of the numbers of 
bacteria and also made tests of the nodulation power of the 
cultures when applied to legumes. He gave a number of 
reasons for expecting humus cultures to replace agar or 
liquid cultures: 

(1) Soil or muck cultures possess greater viability 
than agar or liquid cultures• 

(2) More bacteria are usually present in acre size 
soil or muck cultures than in acre size agar or liquid 
cultures• 

(3) In soil or muck there is better aeration and the 
medium is a more natural one than agar or liquid cultures. 

(4) When humus or muck is used, many types of rhizobia 
may be added to the culture. 

(5) Sterilization of soil or peat is not always 
necessary or desirable since some organisms present in soil 
.aid the development of rhizobia. 

(6) Heat, light and exposure do not affect soil and 
peat cultures as much as agar or liquid cultures. Even 
after soil or peat becomes dry, it will support the growth 
of many bacteria. 

(7) The ease of inoculating with soil cultures gives 
them preference over liquid cultures. 

Some of these points may be open to question, but 
in general their applicability is as great today as at the 
time of Fellers f work.

Some work was done on the minimum and optimum 
numbers of bacterial cells in inoculation cultures* Results 
were not entirely in agreement with each other, but Fellers 
(23) concluded that a minimum of 1,000,000 cells per ml* was 
necessary to secure inoculation, and Hedlin (31) used 
1,000,000 cells per gram dry weight of humus culture as 
determined by the plate count method, as a limiting point 
in determining the effective life of humus cultures* 

Some mention should be made of the desirability 
of legume inoculation, and of more recent developments in 
legume inoculation* Whiting (79) found that inoculation of 
canning peas with the proper strains of Rhizobium legumino- 
sarum improved the yield and quality of the crop* Albrecht 
(1) obtained similar results with peanuts, but Vandecaveye (70) 
found that while inoculation, in Washington State, was 
satisfactory with the inoculants used, there were more or 
less undefined factors in the soil which adversely affected 
the subsequent growth and yield of alfalfa* Erdman (29) 
discusses a number of new developments in legume inoculation, 
including the advantages of using selected strains of rhizobia, 
and the complicating factor of chemical seed treatments, a 
bogey which had not arisen to plague the early investigators© 

He found that Spergon was the only chemical available which 
was not fatal to the bacteria used in inoculation, and the 
results obtained with Spergon were not conclusive* Baur (11)

obtained better results where chemical seed treatments 
were used, by bulking the inoculum with relatively large 
amounts of soil, muck or similar materials and sowing it 
in the drill row with the seed through the fertilizer 
attachment® 

Kadow, Allison and Anderson (37) found that the 
surest method of securing good inoculation when chemical 
seed treatment was used, was to establish the proper bacteria 
in the soil® Of three seed treatments used - Semesan, 
cuprous oxide and Vasco 4 (zinc oxide) - only cuprous oxide 
failed to reduce nodulation when commercial seed inoculants 
were used® Apparently when the soil was fairly dry, cuprous 
oxide did not interfere with inoculation, but the data were 
too limited for this to be established conclusively* It was 
also found that the application of graphite to the inocula¬ 
ted seed prior to chemical disinfection appeared to exert 
some protective action, but this was not definitely 
established either® 

Kernkamp (38), on the contrary, concluded that the 
use of Spergon as a disinfectant did not interfere with 
inoculation by "Hitragin" cultures* However, these results 
may be regarded with some suspicion, as the uninoculated 
controls grown in autoclaved soil developed rather large 
numbers of nodules®

now available, Collins (18) found all brands of commercial 
cultures available equally effective* 

Three other lines of investigation should be 
mentioned. The idea of inoculation of seed prior to sale 
is not new, but Orcutt and Whitman (56) reopened the question 
with the statement that they found living root nodule bacteria 
on the seeds one year after inoculation, where chemical 
disinfectants were not used. However, there is considerable 
doubt as to the value of this method. 

The use of mixtures of different species or strains 
of rhizobia in commercial cultures has become very common 
today. Hofer (54) and Bond (13) found that the mixed 
cultures were as effective in undulation as single strain 
cultures. 

Appleman and Sears (9) suggested an entirely new 
method of inoculation by using lyophiled (frozen and dried 
under vacuum) cultures as inoculants. In their experiments, 
the lyophiled bacteria were mixed with talc, calcium carbonate, 
or aluminium hydroxide to give bulk. The organisms survived 
up to thirteen i^eeks after mixing with the carrier, either 
on the seed or in test tubes. 

Moodie (49) made a summary of benefits from inocula¬ 
tion, reasons for poor results, reasons for inoculating ©very 
seeding, selection of the proper culture, and a list of the 
brands of inoculants available. Thornton (68) emphasized

the need for Inoculation with experiments showing the slow 
rate of migration of rhizobia through soil* Demolon and 
Dunez (21) confirmed this finding with a study of the spread 
of soy bean bacteria in experimental plots* 

(4) Growth and Survival of Hoot Nodule Bacteria 

Fred et al (24) listed nine factors other than 
energy source influencing the growth of rhizobia: air supply, 
temperature, drying, sunlight, reaction, presence or absence 
of various inorganic substances, vitamin B, dyes, and antag¬ 
onisms and symbiosis* The effect of dyes is of little 
importance in the survival of rhizobia in soils, and the 
effect of light of very little more. Nobles (54) was the 
only worker reviewed by Fred et al (24) to find a noticeably 
harmful effect of light on root nodule organisms in soil. It 
is undoubtedly true that light, especially of certain wave 
lengths may be fatal to the unprotected bacteria. 

However, Fred et al (24) made no mention of another 

> . 

factor, which has become more prominent of recent years, the 
effect of bacteriophage. This factor has been encountered 
in widely separate regions, and appears to be of sufficient 
importance to be discussed separately. The other factors 
listed above may be discussed in the order given previously,

mentioned (1888) the apparent need for oxygen in the growth 
of root nodule bacteria. Burris and Wilson (14) found a 
maximum rate of respiration at partial pressures of oxygen 
of Oel to 0.15 atmospheres. Konishi et al (42), however, 
found a repression of respiration of Rh 0 trifolii at oxygen 
tensions below that of normal air# 

Little and Burris (46) found the respiration of 
root nodule bacteria at low oxygen tensions to be stimulated 
by the presence of horse hemoglobin and to a lesser extent 
by the related red pigment found in root nodules# Hedlin 
(31) found that humus cultures of rhizobia died out rapidly 
when stored in sealed glass containers# Many other workers, 
as reviewed by Fred, et al (24), have obtained similar results, 
but on the other hand Jones (36) stored cultures of rhizobia 
for 11 to 15 years in small Freudenrich flasks containing 
a modified Ashby’s agar# The flasks were plugged with cotton, 
sealed with wax and stored at room temperature# The same 
medium was used when the organisms were plated out, and all 
12 cultures used produced typical Rhlzobium colonies. 

The oxidation-reduction character of the medium is 
also important, as was shown by Allyn and Baldwin (7)# They 
demonstrated by means of agar shake and petri dish cultures 
that the best growth of rhizobia occurs when the medium is 
poised at the proper level#

the thermal growth range of rhizobia as 0° to 47°C, and later 
workers, also reviewed by Fred et al, (24), have confirmed 
the correctness of this very closely as 0° to 50OC, with an 
optimum between 20 and 28°C<> Ockerblad was mentioned as 
having reported the thermal death point of rhizobia in 
liquid media as between 59° and 61°C with 10 minutes exposure. 
However, Gangulee (29) observed that in the soil alfalfa 
bacteria remained alive after exposure to 5QOC. for seven 
days • 

Later workers such as Wilson (84) found a growth 
optimum at 28° to 30°C. There was a decrease in rate of 
respiration at temperatures approaching 40°G. Allison and 
Minor (6) obtained similar results. Koffler, Johnson and 
Wilson (41) found that increased temperatures brought about 
an irreversible denaturation of respiratory enzymes, in 
contrast to the reversible denaturation brought about by 
urethane at suboptimal temperatures. Rhizobia, however, 
were found to be very resistant to low temperatures. Breal, 
Fred and Frazier, as reviewed by Fred et al, (24), found no 
evidence that freezing of the substrate caused injury to 
the rhizobia. Vass (75) froze Rhizobium leguminosarum 
cultures in a mannitol liquid, sand, and soil at temperatures 
ranging from -150C to -190°C for 5 minutes to 6 hours. All 
cultures were found to be alive at the end of the experiment. 
There was a gradual decrease in the numbers of bacteria in

the mannitol solution as a result of the longer freezing 
periods, but not in sand or soil, even at -19Q°C. 

(c) Effect of Drying; 

The sensitivity of rhizobia to drying was found 
to depend largely on other environmental factors* Harding 
and Prucha, as reviewed by Fred et al (24) found that 
rhizobia cannot survive on wads of cotton under ordinary 
atmospheric conditions* Chester, also reviewed by Fred et 
al (24), in 1907, found that in thin films on the surface 
of glass, they die rapidly. Temple (62), Vandecaveye (70), 
and Giltner and Langworthy (30), all found that rhizobia 
remained viable in air-dry soil for a remarkably long time. 

The bacteria were found to be much more resistant to drying 
in a clay loam than in sand. It has been found more recently 
that lyophiled (quick frozen, dried and stored under vacuum) 
cultures of rhizobia may survive a good many years. However, 
this involves factors not occurring in the study of survival 
of rhizobia in soils. 

(d) Effect of Reaction 

The reaction of the medium was early found to be 
worthy of study in connection with the growth of Rhizobium 
species. Moore, Maassen and Muller, Maz'e, Zipfel, Richmond, 
Salter, and Fred and Loomis were reviewed by Fred et al (24), 
and were of rather different opinions as to the effect of

reaction on rhizobia. Moore, in 1905, stated that the nodule 
bacteria would stand any degree of acidity which would permit 
the growth of the host plant* Maassen and Muller considered 
the bacteria very sensitive to the reaction of the medium. 

Maze divided the nodule bacteria into those accustomed 
to acid soil and those accustomed to alkaline soils. Zipfel 
observed that small amounts of acid or alkali did not affect 
the growth of the bacteria he studied. Richmond, in 1926, 
reported that cowpea and soybean bacteria were killed in acid 
soil within 3 1/2 years. 

Prucha, using alfalfa bacteria on agar slants, showed 
the bacteria to be more sensitive to HC1 than to equivalent 
amounts of HaOH. • 

Salter, and Fred and Loomis, found that a reaction 
near neutral was best for the growth of alfalfa and clover 
bacteria. Fred and Davenport (25) found that bacteria from 
different cross-inoculation groups behaved differently 
towards acidity. The lower critical pH for alfalfa bacteria 
was found to be 4.9, for lupine, 3.2. Thornton (67) found 
that a pH of 6.0 or higher was necessary for the survival 
of Rh. trifolii in some Florida soils. 

Where nodulation was concerned, Fred, Whiting and 
Hastings(27) found that the limits for nodule production in 
solution cultures were about pH 4.6 to 8.0, and for growth, 
about pH 3.9 to 9.6. The most favourable reaction for growth 
and nodulation was about pH 6.5* For alsike clover, growth

limits were between pH 5*0 and 10#0, with maximum growth 
and nodulation between pH 6 and 8. 

(e) Effect of Inorganic Substances: 

The elements listed by Fred et al (24) required 
by rhizobia for growth are those known to be required by 
higher plants* Phosphorus and potassium were reported as 
being essential for growth by several workers, including 
Truesdell (69), Bewley and Hutchinson (12) and Lohnis (48)* 
Nitrogen compounds, while preventing nodulation when present 
in fairly high concentrations (Wilson (85) ) are necessary 
for the growth of root nodule bacteria in absence of the 
host plant* Hills (52) found that 250 p*p*m* nitrate 
nitrogen in soil cultures of Rh* mellloti stimulated growth 
of the bacteria. Higher concentrations had a depressing 
effect, and concentrations over 1,000 p.p*m. were found to 
be toxic* 

Calcium was found to be beneficial by a great many 
workers* Fulmer (28) found a stimulating effect by calcium 
carbonate on the growth of rhizobia in Colby silt loam, but 
this may have been because of the production of a more 
favourable soil reaction. Alicante (4) obtained similar 
results. Pitz, as reviewed by Fred et al (24) observed a 
beneficial effect on the multiplication of rhizobia accompanying 
the addition of calcium sulphate to the medium.

Later studies have been concerned with attempts 
to determine the effects of trace elements and other factors 
on the growth of rhizobia. Albrecht and McCalla (2) found 
that calcium absorbed on colloidal clay supplied with other 
nutrients maintained normal growth of rhizobia* Steinberg 
(61), in the study of trace element requirements of rhizobia 
found that thorough purification of the chemicals used in 
the nutrient solutions gave slightly more clear-cut results 
at low nutrient levels* Lilly and Leonian (45) reported 
on the interaction of iron with several accessory growth 
factors in the growth of Rh* trifolii* They used thiamine, 

pantothenic acid, inositol, pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, 
riboflavin and p-amino benzoic acid alone and in various 
combinations, with and without iron. All were found to be 
stimulatory to growth under specified conditions® Mulder 
(50) stated that molybdenum was apparently required in 
symbiotic nitrogen fixation. 

(f) Vitamin B and Other Accessory Factors: 

Fred et al (24) merely mentioned that a large 
number of microbiologists had investigated the relation of 
vitamins to the growth of microorganisms. However, Allison 
and Hoover (5), Wilson, (85), Lilly and Leonian (45), and 
other recent workers have made it clear that many of the 
members of the B complex are accessory factors in the growth 
of rhizobia.

(g) Antagonisms and Symbiosis: 

The effects of the presence of other micro¬ 
organisms in cultures of rhizobia attracted the attention 
of a good many of the earlier workers. Fred et al (24) 
reviewed twenty papers dealing with the effects of other 
microorganisms on the growth of nodule bacteria. Of these, 
six cited beneficial effects as a result of the association, 
though the results were somewhat contradictory. Hino (33) 
was the only worker to report rhizobia as not being eaten 
by protozoa. 

Robison (57, 58) isolated six antagonists of 
legume bacteria. These were all common soil microorganisms, 
including Asoergillis wentii, which produced a bacteriostatic 
agent reducing the numbers of nodules on Trifolium repens» 
Furthermore, Hedlin (31) found that competition by other 
microorganisms greatly reduced the numbers of rhizobia in 
humus cultures. A paper by Lochhead and Landerkin (47) is 
of interest. In studying the antagonisms existing between 
Streptomyces scabies and other actinomycetes, they found that 
cross-antagonisms between the various antagonistic organisms 
were very numerous. This suggests that normally a particular 
organism antagonistic to any other would be unlikely to 
multiply to such an extent that the growth of the second 
organism would be completely suppressed. Thus, because of 
the complex nature of the microstructure of the soil, it is

normally unlikely that the population of rhizohia in soil 
would he unduly reduced by the action of other microorganisms* 

(5) Bacteriophage: 

The discovery of the influence of bacteriophage is 
comparatively recent in the study of legume inoculation, 
and the study is by no means complete, but its potential 
importance cannot be ignored. Demolon and Dunez (20, 21), 
in France, made a study of 11 fatigue” of soils growing 
legumes continuously for several years. They found reduction 
in yield to be due to decreased nodulation and, hence, 
nitrogen fixation. This was caused by a relatively non¬ 
specific bacteriophage attacking all species of rhizobia. 

The effects of the bacteriophage as shown by yield and 
nitrogen content of the crop could not be entirely offset by 
the use of nitrogenous fertilizers. They advocated as a 
remedy inoculation with phage resistant strains of bacteria. 

Vandecaveye and Katznelson (73) in Washington 
isolated a lytic principle effective against 80 per cent of 
their stock cultures of Rh* meliloti. They failed to find 
the phage in alfalfa fields less than three years old. How¬ 
ever, fields three or four years old were a good source of 
the phage. It was felt that poor alfalfa yields were frequently 
due to the presence of phage. Vandecaveye, Fuller, and 
Katznetson (72) found the same decreases in yield in alfalfa

grown two or three years on the same land* It was found 
that application of nitrogenous fertilizers increased 
yields markedly, but that inoculation with phage-resistant 
strains had no effect* The reduction in yield was as high 
as 60 - 70 per cent, and it was shown that disease of the 
plant was not the cause* Vandecaveye and Moodie (74) later 
found that the use of phage-resistant strains of bacteria, 
or of different strains of alfalfa, had no effect* Again, 
the use of nitrogenous fertilizers increased the yield* 

Kleczkowska (59, 40) at Rothamsted, developed an 
agar plate method for counting phage particles, and made a 
study of the interaction of the bacteriophage with rhizobia* 
The results were extremely interesting, especially from a 
practical standpoint* 

(1) The phage attacked only 10 - 15 per cent of the 
pea and clover bacteria strains tested* These strains were 
collected over a large area* 

(2) The phage was not unusual in its specificity* 

(5) Single small samples of turf contained both 

resistant and susceptible strains of rhizobia. 

(4) In the soil, a rapid development of resistant 
bacterial strains took place. 

(5) When a lysed culture had cleared, in a few days a 
further growth of the bacteria occurred* These organisms 
were found to be susceptible to the phage, but were protected

from lysis by some principle produced in the culture medium* 

(6) Resistant dissociants were as effective in nitrogen 
fixation as the parent strain* 

(7) Aseptically grown clover, inoculated with susceptible 
bacteria, produced resistant variants in the absence of the 
phage * 

These results differ markedly from those obtained 
by Vandecaveye and his coworkers, and from those of Demolon 
and Dunez (20, 21), in that they suggest that neither phage- 
resistant strains, as suggested by Demolon and Dunez, or 
nitrogen fertilizer, to which Vandecaveye finally resorted, 
are necessary* It may be possible that the different 
environmental conditions prevailing in the three different 
countries had some effect* 

(6) Respiration Studies of Soils and Rhizobia: 

Measurements of respiration, by various means, have 
been used for some time in studies of the metabolism of the 
different Rhizobium species* Walker, Anderson and Brown 
(76, 77) carried out experiments to determine the effect of 
nitrogen source on four species of rhizobia. At that time 
the need by rhizobiafor various growth factors was little 
■understood, and the lack of these growth factors, while 
recognized by Walker and his coworkers, exerted a masking 
influence on the results of the work*

Thorn© and Walker (65) and Neal and Walker (51, 52) 
carried out extensive experiments using measurements of the 
oxygen uptake to determine the effect on the growth of rhizobia 
of reaction of the medium, and to study the utilization and 
the extent of oxidation of carbonaceous materials* Thorne 
and Walker (66) later made a study of the effect of accessory 
growth factors on the oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide 
production of rhizobia* At that time the pure growth factors 
were unknown and various plant, soil and bacterial extracts 
were used as sources of growth factors* 

Konishi et al (42) measured the respiration of 
Rhizobium trifolii , Rhizobium lupini, and Rhizobium malilotl 
under different pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide* They 
found respiration to be reduced when the oxygen tension was 
below that of normal air, though the respiration of Rhizobium 
trifolii was depressed the least* The respiration of Rh» 
trifolli was found to be promoted in a partial pressure of 
carbon dioxide of 0*05 atmospheres* These results were not 
entirely in agreement with those of Burris and Wilson (14) 
who found the maximum rate of respiration to be reached at 
a p (>2 of 0*1 to 0*15 atmospheres* 

Wilson (84) developed a technique for using the 
"resting cell” technique for studying the metabolism of 
rhizobia, and found a growth optimum at 28° - 50°C and a 
respiration optimum at 37°C* The respiration rate decreased 
with time near 40°C. Thorne and Burris (64) used this

technique and a technique for making suspensions of rhizobia 
directly from the nodule to compare the respiration of root 
nodule bacteria from nodules and from stock laboratory 
cultures© There was some evidence that the cells from the 
nodules reached a maximum rate of respiration at a lower 
oxygen tension than did bacteria from stock cultures* 

Hoover and Allison (35), however, made respiration measure¬ 
ments on aliquots taken directly from growing cultures, 
avoiding the washing necessary to obtain ,T resting" cells* 

They also made a complete accounting of materials used and 
products formed* Both methods have their advantages* 

Burris et al (15) used the Warburg respirometer to 
compare the adaptation mechanisms of Rhizobium and Azotobacter, 
Little and Burris (46) in 1947, used the same type of 
apparatus to show that respiration of nodule bacteria at 
low oxygen tensions was stimulated by hemoglobin and by the 
very similar red pigment of root nodules, and in the same 
year Koffler, Johnson and Wilson (41) determined the combined 
influence of temperature and urethane on respiration of 
rhizobia. 

The measurement of the respiration of microorganisms 
in the soil is a different problem from that of making the 
same sort of determination on a pure culture of bacteria. 
Usually a much larger sample of soil is necessary, several 
grams of sample at least instead of a few milligrams, for

uniformity* In addition, the interactions between the 
bacteria and the enormous surface area present in soil 
are almost impossible to determine, and the micro-structure 
of the most uniform soil sample is extremely heterogeneous* 
Relatively little work has been done on soil 
respiration* Smith and Brown (60) in 1932, used a modified 
Barcroft differential manometer to show that carbon dioxide 
production of Iowa soils followed the bacterial growth curve* 
Corbett (19) followed the evolution of carbon dioxide from 
tropical soils by an absorption method, and found results 
similar to those of Smith and Brown while the rate of carbon 
dioxide production was increasing* Finally, Lees (44) 
described a modification of the Haldane constant-pressure 
respirometer, which offered a method of measuring the 
respiration of pure cultures of rhizobia, in soil as a 
substrate, and this method was used in the series of 
experiments described here*

MATERIALS AND METHODS 


The work reported here was divided into a study 
of the growth and survival of root nodule bacteria in 
mixed hurnus and soil, and in soil cultures under various 
treatments, and a study of the oxygen uptake of Rh» 
meiiloti in six soils from two Southern Alberta irrigation 
districts. Straw and alfalfa had been allowed to decompose 
for periods of approximately two to eight weeks in samples 
of these soils before they were steam sterilized and 
inoculated with Rh. meiiloti. 

(1) Growth and Survival Experiments: 

Inoculant bases used were: 

(1) A mixture of equal portions by weight of black 
mineral soil from the Soils Department plots 
south of the city of Edmonton with one of two 
peats obtained from near Winterburn and about 
four miles north of Breton. 

(2) A peat-carbon black mixture obtained from Mr. 

J. A. Robertson of Edmonton, who used it as a 
base for commercial legume inoculants. 

(3) A brown soil obtained near Lethbridge, which 
was used in one experiment to study the effect

of phosphate on the survival of rhlzobia 

in soil* 

In experiments designed to study the effect of 
different nutrient and other treatments on the growth and 
survival of rhizobia in the different inoculant bases* the 
cultures were stored in Erlenmeyer flasks of appropriate 
sizes and loosely stoppered according to the method used 
by Hedlin (31). The treatments used were CaC03, MgCOs, 

K 2 HPO 4 , CaSO^, sucrose, mineral oil, NaNOg, and sodium 
alginate, alone and in various combinations and concentrations. 
Six experiments were set up in which the suitability of two 
types of screw cap jars as containers was investigated. 

One type was a narrow-necked brown jar, in which the jar 
was plugged with cotton before the cap was put on, and the 
other was a wider mouthed 8 -oz. clear glass jar from which 
the cotton plug was omitted. Cultures stored in jars were 
given similar treatments to those received by cultures in 
Erlenmeyer flasks. In all cases, the inoculant bases were 
given the appropriate treatments, made up to forty per cent 
of total water holding capacity, sterilized for the length 
of time necessary for the soil used, according to the figures 
obtained by Simpson (59), and inoculated with 1.0 cc of a 
suspension of the bacteria grown In a yeast-extract sucrose 
solution, as recommended by Fred and Waksman (26). In

general, the initial number of bacteria per gram of base 
was relatively low. 

In all cases, counts of the numbers of bacteria 
were made by the plate method, using the yeast extract 
sucrose agar containing congo red, recommended by Fred et al 
(24), and by Fred and Waksman (26)* 

Pure cultures were used throughout the experiment, 
as Hedlin (31) had found that the presence of contaminating 
organisms reduced the numbers of root nodule organisms 
considerably, and it was found that contamination of the 
stored cultures was relatively rare* 

(2) Oxygen Uptake by Soil Cultures of Rh. Meliloti: 

Six soils from south-western Alberta were used as 
media in which the bacteria were grown, five of these soils 
being from the Magrath Irrigation District, and one from the 
east end of the Mountain View Irrigation District, on© mile 
west of Cardston* The Magrath soils were from the dark brown 
soil zone* and the general area is classed as clay and silty 
clay loam, though there are patches of lighter soil in the 
district* The Cardston soil was from the shallow black 
soil zone, and is a loam or sandy loam* These soils were 
chosen because the Cardston soil has been irrigated for 
only two or three years, while the Magrath Irrigation 
District is the oldest large project in Alberta, having been

irrigated for fifty years at the time the samples were 
taken. It was felt that if there were adverse effects 
from long continued irrigation, it would be more easily 
detected in these soils 0 Five of the soil samples were 
taken from fields growing alfalfa at the time, but soil 
number 3 was a sandy soil (loam) from a sugar beet field 
known to have been irrigated heavily for all of the fifty 
years of the operation of the district. 

The soils were as follows: 

(1) C. C. Spencer, Magrath, Silty clay loam, low 

lying, tendency to alkali. pH 7.5. 

(2) N. L. Hull, Cardston. Shallow black soil from 

Cardston, silt loam, high in organic matter, 

newly under irrigation. pH 6.3. 

(3) K. Hindly, Magrath. Loam, heavily irrigated for 

fifty years. (In sugar beets - 1950). pH 8.0. 

(4) 0. Owens, Magrath. Clay, lightly irrigated. pH 7.6. 

(5) W. Dudley, Magrath. Silty clay beside fertilizer 

trials. Excellent hay crop in 1950. pH 8.1. 

(6) J. A. Spencer, Magrath. Silty clay loam, beside 

fertilizer trials. Also good hay crop in 1950, 

pH 7.4. 

Two samples of each soil were placed in tumblers and 2 per 
cent by weight of chopped straw and alfalfa respectively were

added to the samples, which were then brought up to 50 per 
cent of the total water holding capacity of the soil* The 
moisture content was maintained by adding water at intervals 
and samples were taken every ten days to two weeks, dried 
at 45°C and stored in 4-oz. jars* 

The samples thus taken were ground in a mortar, 
and duplicate samples of twenty grams were weighed into the 
reaction vessels of a modified Haldane respirometer, as 
described by Lees (44)• The procedure and apparatus used 
by Lees were further modified by substituting a 25 ml. Mohr 
burette for the 5 ml. pipette making a correction to the 
burette reading for changes in room temperature, and replacing 
the air in the reaction vessels with pure oxygen* These 
modifications enabled the oxygen uptake to be followed for 
up to three days without opening the reaction vessels* 

After adding the soils to the reaction vessels, 
they were moistened with sufficient water to bring the water 
content up to 50 per cent of total water holding capacity, 
less 5 ml* which was later added as inoculum, plus 2 ml* to 
allow for loss in the autoclave. The soils were then stirred 
to break up the lump of puddled material formed when the 
water was added, the absorption cups and filter papers were 
placed in the reaction vessels and the vessels were stoppered 
with cotton and sterilized*

The inoculum was prepared by the method of Wilson 
(84) except that facilities were not available for concentra¬ 
ting and washing the bacterial cells by centrifugation. Two 
Roux bottles, each containing about 100 ml. of carbohydrate 
free media containing 0.1 per cent yeast extract, the salts 
of medium 79 (Fred and Waksman (26)) and 2.5 per cent agar 
were inoculated with 3 ml. of a suspension of Rh. meliloti 
obtained by washing a 48 hour culture of the organisms from 
a slant of the same medium. The Roux bottles were incubated 
for 48 hours, and the bacteria washed off the agar with 
physiological saline solution into a bottle containing glass 
beads. The suspension thus obtained was then filtered through 
sterile glass wool to remove clumps, and was relatively free 
from gum. The soils were inoculated with 5 ml. of the 
suspension thus obtained, oxygen was passed through the 
reaction vessels for fifteen minutes, the absorption cups 
were filled with 10 per cent NaOH solution, and the vessels 
were placed in a water bath at 30°C. and attached to the 
respiration apparatus. After being allowed to remain open 
to the air at least fifteen minutes to reach thermal equili¬ 
brium, the pinch clamps were closed, and the first set of 
readings of the burette were taken. Readings were then taken 
every two or three hours during the day over a period of two 
days. In all cases, a "blank” determination in the untreated 
soil was included. The number of mis. of 0g absorbed was 
calculated and converted to standard temperature and pressure.

(3) Field Fertilizer Trials With Minor Elements; 

Three fertilizer trials were placed on alfalfa in 
the Brooks district, and two in the Magrath district, to 
test the effect of minor elements on the yield of alfalfa, 
but the results were in all cases negative# 

(4) Counts of Rhizobium in Field Soils; 

Counts of Rh# meliloti were made on four soils from 
the vicinity of Edmonton, by the method of J* K. Wilson (80)* 
Since nodulation on these fields had been very poor for some 
time, and the presence of root nodule bacteria was uncertain, 
it was deemed advisable to make an attempt to make some 
estimate of the numbers of rhizobia present#

(a) Results of Experiments with Inorganic Nutrients 

and Sucrose, 

The results of these experiments are presented 
in Tables I - VII. In Tables I and II are the results of 
experiments designed to follow the growth of rhizobia over 
the first month after inoculation of the humus base, although 
the experiment reported in Table II was later extended to 
298 days. In both experiments the same nutrient treatments 
were used, and plate counts were made every three or four 
days. In the peat-black soil mixture (Table I) all treat¬ 
ments gave higher plate counts than did the check, except 
where magnesium carbonate alone was added, in which case 
the plate counts for the sixteenth and nineteenth days fell 
below that of the check. Ytfhere sucrose was present, the 
numbers rose less rapidly, but by the twelfth day, the counts 
of cultures to which sucrose had been added had risen to 
over 2500 millions per gram, and continued to rise to 3450 
millions per gram on the sixteenth day. The counts of all 
other cultures had reached a maximum about the ninth to 
twelfth day, and decreased to about 200 - 400 millions per 
gram on the 32nd day. On the 32nd day the count of the

culture to which sucrose had "been added was 840 millions 
per gram* By this time the average water loss from the 
cultures had reached 4*8 grams 0 

The experimental results in Table II, in which 
peat-carbon black mixture was used as a base, were rather 
different. In this base the difference between the 
counts of rhizobia in the check and those of the treated 
cultures was much less, except where sucrose was added 
to the medium. In the cultures containing sucrose 
the counts had risen to 5150 millions per gram by the 
fifth day, and at the end of 30 days were still over 4,000 
millions per gram, except for three counts which dropped 
below that level. Counts of all other treatments reached 
a maximum between about 3000 and 4500 millions per gram, 
which was reached somewhat later in those cultures to 
which dipotassium phosphate had been added although the 
results were somewhat irregular. These results were not 
obtained in the peat-*black soil mixture* 

This experiment was continued for 298 days, at 
the end of which time the highest count was 6.5 millions 
per gram, in the cultures to which calcium carbonate alone, 
and all nutrients plus sucrose, had been added. The count 
on the untreated base was 5.7 millions per gram. 

The average water loss was 3*8 gm. after 30 days, 
and 31*7 gm. after 298 days.

The results of adding dipotassium phosphate 
alone to the peat-carbon mixture are shown in Table III. 

The counts obtained were somewhat erratic* However, when 
0.20 and 0*40 per cent K^HPO^ was added, there was some 
indication that a higher count was obtained 0 In this 
experiment the highest count obtained was 3790 millions 
per gram, as compared to 5250 millions per gram where 
sucrose and potassium phosphate were added to the same 
medium, and the average water loss after 252 days was 
36«2 gm* 

Table IV gives the results of plate counts of 
rhizobia in peat-black soil mixture, given similar treat¬ 
ments to those used previously, and stored in 16-oz . 
brown screw top jars* The plate counts were much lower 
than those obtained in this medium before, but the peat 
was more coarsely ground when the medium was made up, and 
this may have affected the results. There appeared to be 
some stimulatory effect due to the addition of sucrose, 
but there was apparently little benefit derived from the 
other nutrients added* It is of interest to note that in 
263 days the average water loss was only 13*2 gnu 

The plate counts given in Table V were obtained 
from cultures grown in peat-carbon mixture in clear glass 
screw-top jars, half of which were stored in the refrigerator. 
The medium used was from a second lot of peat-carbon black 
mixture, obtained from discarded unused cans of commercial

legume inoculation cultures. The counts were as high as 
those obtained in the experiment described in Table II, 
at least in those cultures held at room temperatures, but 
it was difficult to detect any consistent trend in the 
plate counts resulting from the different treatments. How¬ 
ever, there did appear to be somewhat higher numbers in 
those cultures held at room temperature to which sucrose 
had been added. Of special interest were the high counts 
on the cultures stored for 402 days in the refrigerator* 

One experiment was carried out in which all the 
cultures were stored in the refrigerator for 54 days, and 
were then removed and stored for another 65 days at room 
temperature, and the results are given in Table VI* The 
same nutrient treatments were used as in the previous experi¬ 
ment (Table V) and similar rather variable results were 
obtained. Of interest was the fact that the addition of 
calcium carbonate alone or calcium carbonate plus dipotassium 
phosphate produced almost immediate increases in numbers 
of rhizobia present. In cultures to which sucrose had been 
added there was not a noticeable increase in numbers until 
after 39 days. After that time, the largest counts, in 
general, were obtained from those cultures to which sucrose 
had been added. 

The average water loss after 54 days was 1.4 gm.; 
after 119 days it was 7.5 gm.

In only one experiment were the bacteria grown 
in a mineral soil alone. In Table VII are given the 
results of plate counts of Rh. meliloti in a brown irrigated 
soil from near Lethbridge. The soils of that area were 
known to be probably low in phosphorus, so dipotassium 
phosphate was the only treatment added. It did not 
appear to affect the highest count obtained in the cultures 
held at room temperature, but appeared to maintain slightly 
higher numbers over a long period of time* In the refrigerated 
cultures a higher maximum count was obtained from the cultures 
treated with KgHPO^, and after 550 days the numbers were 
still higher in the cultures to vhich phosphate was added. 

(b) Results of Experiments with Sodium Nitrate 

Table VIII gives results of plate counts of 
cultures treated with two levels of sodium nitrate and on© 
of sucrose. The nitrate alone appeared to have a stimulating 
effect on the growth of the bacteria, but the most interesting 
result obtained was the marked decrease in numbers when 
sucrose and sodium nitrate were both present* The numbers 
were always very much lower than when sodium nitrate alone 
was present, and in three cases no colonies at all of 
rhizobia were found on the plates. These results were rather 
a surprise, so two other experiments were set up to obtain 
further information, and the results are given in Tables IX

and X. The results in Table IX showed that whenever sodium 
nitrate and either 1*0 or 2,0 per cent sucrose were both 
added to the medium the growth of the root nodule bacteria 
was greatly reduced. The numbers were lower when potassium 
phosphate was present, also. In general, where sodium 
nitrate alone was added the numbers were higher than in the 
untreated soil. The effect of adding sucrose alone was 
unexpected. It may have been because of a relatively high 
concentration of nitrate nitrogen in the peat used. 

Table X represents results of an experiment set 
up in an attempt to determine the concentration of sucrose 
at which the growth of rhizobia was seriously affected. 

The results in Table IX seemed to indicate that concentra¬ 
tions of 1,0% sucrose and 500 ppm nitrogen as sodium nitrate 
severely limited the growth of the bacteria, so four concentra¬ 
tions of sucrose below that level were tried. In addition, 
two concentrations of dipotassium phosphate were used with 
the sodium nitrate. 

The results were similar to those previously 
obtained except that after 119 days there were lower numbers 
where sodium nitrate alone was added than in the untreated 
base. Where 0,1% and 0,25% sucrose plus 500 ppm nitrate 
nitrogen were present, growth of the rhizobia was possible, 
though the numbers were generally lower than in the untreated 
soil after eighteen days. Where more than 0,25% sucrose

wag used, growth was uncertain, and frequently no colonies 
appeared on the plates, even at the lowest dilution used® 
Where phosphate but no sucrose was used, growth took place, 
though it was erratic, varying considerably between 
cultures having the same treatment® 

(c) Results of Experiments with Mineral Oil and 

Sodium Alginate 

These experiments were begun to determine 
the effect of materials of potential value as Stickers”' 
and preservatives on the growth of rhizobia in moist humus 
cultures* In Table XI are the results of an experiment in 
which sodium alginate and mineral oil were added to cultures 
of Rh* leguminosarum in peat-black soil mixture held at 3°G* 
In general, the addition of sodium alginate to the culture 
reduced the numbers considerably* Only one count, of 7.5% 
sodium alginate at 337 days, was higher than the correspond¬ 
ing count from the untreated soil* However, after 460 days, 
the numbers in most of the cultures to which sodium alginate 
had been added had risen to a few hundred millions per gram. 

In the cultures to which the mineral oil had 
been added much greater increases took place. Mostly the 
numbers were below those present in the untreated soil, but 
most of the counts obtained after 92 days were above 300 
millions per gram* The highest count obtained where mineral 
oil was present was 1057 millions per gram, with 12% mineral

oil present, after 224 days. The highest count in the 
untreated base was 1212 millions per gram, after 337 days. 
Where 24$ mineral oil was present, there were not as many 
high counts obtained, the numbers not rising above 100 
millions per gram until after 337 days, and beginning to 
drop again after 460 days. The other experiments in which 
mineral oil was added are summarized in tables XII, XIII, 
and XIV* Table XII presents results from an experiment in 
which rhizobia were grown in peat-black soil mixture in 
brown glass screw-top bottles. After 179 days the caps 
were removed from the bottles, which were plugged with 
cotton, to allow them to dry out. Only on the first count 
was there any apparent stimulatory effect from the presence 
of mineral oil* After that, there was no consistent trend 
towards higher numbers where the mineral oil was present. 

After the caps were removed, numbers in all cultures 
dropped sharply, there being very little difference between 
any of them. 

Table XIII gives counts of rhizobia in peat-black 
soil mixture in clear glass screw-top jars, in which the 
bacteria were allowed to grow for ten days, at the end of 
which time half of the cultures were placed in the refrig¬ 
erator at 3°C. The remainder were held at room temperature. 

In this experiment there was an apparent stimulatory effect 
in the cultures where mineral oil was present, especially 
where the cultures were refrigerated. The reason for this

was not clear, especially since where 12 % mineral oil was 
added, the counts were nearly always lower than where 
either 6 % or 24 % mineral oil was used. 

Since Rh, leguminosarum had been used in all 
previous experiments but one it was felt that cultures of 
other species of rhizobia should be tried in jars, in the 
presence of mineral oil. Table XIV gives the results of 
this experiment. These were much as expected, though some¬ 
what erratic: at certain times, there was an apparent stimu¬ 
lating effect where the mineral oil was added, and at other 
times there was an apparent depression. However, the 
numbers were well maintained throughout the experiment. 

Sucrose (0.5$) was added to some of the cultures 
in this experiment. There appeared to be a certain stimu¬ 
lating effect due to its presence, but it was not possible 
to carry on the experiment long enough to be sure of this. 

(d) Results of Experiments with Refrigerate d Cultures 

The results of these experiments are given 
in Tables V, VI, VII, XI and XIII. The results were again 
much as expected. Larger numbers of bacteria were, as a 
rule, maintained for a greater length of time. Where the 
bacteria were inoculated into the medium and immediately 
placed in the refrigerator, the increase in numbers was much 
slower than in corresponding cultures held at room temperature. 
This may be seen in Tables V and VII. It was also observed

that the maximum numbers found were not as great when the 
cultures were refrigerated in this manner. 

One of the more outstanding effects of refrigera¬ 
tion was on the water loss, as seen in Tables V, VII and 
XIIIo In comparison with similar cultures held at room 
temperature, the refrigerated cultures lost water much 
less rapidly, even after several months. The small 
amount of the added water lost may also be seen in Tables 
VI and XIo 

In Table XIII are given results of plate counts 
of cultures placed in the refrigerator after the numbers 
of bacteria had become relatively high. After 87 days, the 
drop in numbers in the unrefrigerated cultures as compared 
to the refrigerated cultures was easily noticeable. The 
water loss was also correspondingly greater. After 118 
days the difference was even more marked. 

(e) Results of Experiments with Screw-top Glass Jars 

Two types of jar were used, one a brown jar 
with a relatively narrow mouth, and the other a clear glass 
jar with a wider mouth* The brown jars were plugged with 
cotton below the cap, with the intention of preventing con¬ 
tamination, but it was found that the plugs absorbed moisture 
after a time and provided an excellent support for mould 
growth. The clear jars were not plugged with cotton.

The results of these experiments are given in 
Tables IV, V, VIII, XII, XIII and XIV, While no direct 
comparison with the growth in erlenmeyer flasks was 
possible under the conditions of the experiment, it may 
easily be seen that the numbers of bacteria in the jars 
were maintained at a level well above Hedlin f s (51) 
standard for minimum numbers in an effective inoculation 
culture• 

The problem of contamination was more serious 
when the brown jars were used, because of the moisture 
absorbed by the cotton plug. However, some trouble was 
experienced with contamination in the erlenmeyer flasks 
stoppered with rubber stoppers wrapped with cotton. It 
seems likely that the jars, if properly stoppered, should 
not be much more susceptible to contamination than a 
container or culture vessel plugged in the orthodox 
manner. Furthermore, it was noted that contamination was 
very much less frequent when the cultures were stored in 
the refrigerator.

(2) Oxygen Uptake of Rh» Meliloti in Soils. 


The results of these experiments are presented 
graphically. The number of days that the soil was incubated 
in the presence of straw or alfalfa before it was sterilized 
and inoculated with rhizobia varied. It was not possible 
to make comparisons between soils or between different 
determinations on the same soil, since it was not possible 
to use the same numbers of bacteria as inoculum for each 
determination. An attempt was made to determine the weight 
of organisms introduced in the inoculum, but this was not 
found possible. The weight of organisms was so small that 
the determination was probably considerably in error, and 
in addition the period of observation was long enough so 
that growth of the bacteria should have been considerable. 
Hence it was not considered valid to reduce the data to 
oxygen uptake per unit weight of bacteria in the inoculum. 
However, some comparisons are possible. 

As a general rule, where alfalfa or straw was 
added to the soil and the mixture moistened, sterilized and 
inoculated immediately, the oxygen uptake where straw was 
added was about 12-14 ml. in about 23 hours, and where alfalfa 
was added, about 20-22 ml. In soil number five, hov/ever, 
the oxygen uptake where straw was added was about 18 ml. 

Soil number two did not follow this general 
pattern. Oxygen uptake where straw was added was below that

of the untreated soil, and where alfalfa was added it was 
even lower® However, after the soil had been incubated 
with straw or alfalfa for 10 ** 66 days, these observations 
were reversedo 

The general trend was for the increase in oxygen 
uptake over the untreated soil to decrease as the incubation 
time before inoculation with rhizobia and measurement of 
oxygen uptake was increased from 0 to 66 days. When the 
period of incubation prior to drying,sterilization and 
inoculation was relatively long, soils number one, number 
two, number three, and number four showed greater oxygen 
uptake where straw had been added to the soil than where 
alfalfa was added® This was not the case with soils numbers 
five and six® The oxygen uptake for all cultures was 
generally lower in soil number three, and highest in soil 
number five® Soil number three was a loam, number two a 
silt loam, and the others were heavier soils, silty clay 
loams or clays* Soil number five was a silty clay which 
had been farmed very well for about fifty years* 

The oxygen uptake for the other four soils was 
about seven to nine ml* after approximately 45 hours in the 
respirometer. In soil number two the oxygen uptake was 
about as high at the end of the period of observation as 
for soils one, four and six, but was lower earlier in the 
observation period. The difference in oxygen uptake between 
treatments was greater after ten days incubation before

(3) Dilution Counts of Rhizobia in Field Soils 

These results are presented in Table XV. Good 
nodulation was obtained in all dilutions of the sample 
from the H. A. Craig farm, and from the east field of the 
University Animal Science farm. Nodules were poor or 
absent in the 1:100,000 dilution of the sample from the 
University Soils Farm and all dilutions higher than the 
1:100 dilution of the sample from the west field of the 
Animal Science Farm. Hence it was concluded that in the 
samples from the Craig farm and from the east field of the 
Animal Science Farm there were at least 100,000 rhizobia 
per gram of soil, in the Soils farm sample between 10,000 
and 100,000 rhizobia per gram of soil, and probably 
between 100 and 1,000 rhizobia per gram in the sample from 
the west field of the Animal Science Farm. Nodules were 
found on one check pot, but conditions were not ideal in 
the greenhouse where the pots were kept. While the pots 
were always watered with sterile distilled water, whenever 
the weather was warm enough outside to allow the snow on 
the roof to melt there would be water dripping into some 
of the pots from cracks in the roof. This certainly did 
not improve the chances of keeping the pots free from 
outside contamination.

(4) Fertilizer Trials on Alfalfa Fields 

Eight trials were put on in the spring and summer 
of 1950, three near Edmonton, three just north of the town 
of Brooks, Alberta, in the Eastern Irrigation District, and 
two on the Magrath Irrigation District southwest of Magrath# 
The two latter trials were put on just after the first 
cutting of alfalfa had been removed* The plots were one rod 
square, laid out In the form of a Latin Square, and the 
fertilizer treatments were (1) check, (2) sodium molybdate, 

(3) 11-48-0 + sulphur + copper sulphate + manganous sulphate 
+ zinc sulphate, and (4) sodium molybdate + all other 
treatments# For the trials at Magrath, a treatment of 11-48-0 
alone was added# However, no significant differences were 
obtained between any of these treatments# Hay yields were 
very good on all of the irrigated trials, and any increase 
due to the fertilizers would have resulted in phenomenal 
total yields#

DISCUSSION OP RESULTS 


The problems involved in the study of bacteriology 
as compared with those encountered in chemistry or physics 
may be compared to those of picking blueberries while wearing 
boxing gloves* When soil microbiology Is being studied, 
the analogous problem becomes more complicated by the 
necessity of reaching at arms length under a wire fence for 
the berries. Thus it may be seen that the results obtained 
represent observations of the end products of the micro¬ 
biological "reactions” rather than of the reactions them¬ 
selves. The impossibility of dissecting the blueberries 
under the conditions specified may be readily seen, but the 
analogous condition for the bacterial reactions is less 
obvious. Once this is recognized, the results obtained in 
this investigation may be better understood* 

(1) Experiments with Humus and Soil Cultures of Rhizobia 

The effect of the addition of inorganic nutrients 
to the culture medium appears to depend largely upon the 
amounts of those nutrients present in the base originally. 
Where nutrients of several kinds were added to peat-black 
soil mixture, the increases obtained in numbers of rhizobia 
were much greater than increases obtained when the same 
nutrients were added to a peat-carbon black mixture, which

Is an excellent base for the growth of rhizobia. Also,when 
phosphate was added to a brown soil low in this element, 
the numbers of bacteria were increased and maintained over 
a period of a year and a half* Sucrose, which alone of all 
the nutrients used, functions as an energy source for the 
bacteria, gave large increases in both bases, however. 

The effect of nitrates and sucrose on the growth 
of rhizobia was extremely interesting. Hills (32) had 
found that the presence of 500 - 1000 ppm nitrate nitrogen 
In the soil culture medium depressed the growth of rhizobia, 
and it was thought that the presence of an easily available 
energy source might stimulate the growth of the bacteria 0 
However, it was found that in the presence of all but the 
lowest concentrations of sucrose the growth of the bacteria 
was greatly repressed in cultures containing 500 ppm of 
nitrate nitrogen. Dilutions as low as one in five hundred 
(the dilution most commonly used in this work was one in 
five million) frequently failed to find any living rhizobia. 
No explanation has offered itself for this phenomenon, since 
the bacteria grow readily in the presence of much higher 
concentrations of sucrose alone. However, it seems apparent 
that it is important to control the level of nitrate nitrogen 
in the culture medium when making up commercial cultures. 

Mineral oil and sodium alginate were added to 
the humus cultures to Increase the numbers of bacteria which 
would stick to the seed when inoculation was done. Sodium

alginate was very sticky and appeared promising, but in 
the concentrations necessary for good sticking, the growth 
of the bacteria was much depressed. This was probably 
due to the excess of soluble materials introduced with the 
sodium alginate. After more than a year, possibly after 
the bacteria had consumed much of the soluble material, 
the numbers of organisms in these cultures rose very 
rapidly. 

Mineral oil was less effective as a sticker, 
but offered less of an obstacle to the growth of the 
bacteria. Satisfactory numbers of rhizobia were maintained 
for considerable lengths of time in the presence of large 
quantities of mineral oil* The value of mineral oil as a 
preservative was somewhat disappointing. Its value in 
preserving cultures of rhizobia on agar slants for a period 
of several years had been proven beyond doubt. However, 
in the humus cultures, there was no evidence that it 
preserved alive larger numbers of bacteria or that the 
cultures dried out more slowly when oil was used# 

The use of refrigeration in preserving humus 
cultures of root nodule bacteria appeared to give very 
promising results. In all cases, where cultures were 
refrigerated, larger numbers of the bacteria were preserved 
alive longer. Vass (75) showed that the rhizobia are not 
sensitive to cold, and the effect is probably partly at 
least the result of a simple slowing down of the metabolic

processes of the organism* If the cost of cold storage 
proves to be reasonable, this method promises to be very 
valuable in the handling of humus cultures of rhizobia. 

Screw-top glass jars appear to be a very satis¬ 
factory substitute for paper cartons in marketing commercial 
cultures of rhizobia. Cost may be a limiting factor, but 
on the other hand, the earlier jelly cultures of rhizobia 
were marketed in glass bottles. The rhizobia survive for 
some time in the glass jars, which allow aeration without 
excessive moisture loss, and especially in conjunction 
with refrigeration, should prove to be extremely useful in 
marketing effective cultures of rhizobia. Contamination Is 
a problem that must be considered, but it can probably be 
eliminated by proper handling and sterilization. It could 
not be worse than in the present paper cartons. 

The problem of the condition of the bacteria 
in the cultures is an Interesting one. The bacteria are 
non-spore formers, and yet it seems very unlikely that they 
are In a state of active growth. An attempt was made 
during the investigation to determine the respiratory 
activity of the organisms in humus cultures, both with 
the Lees respirometer and with a titration method. How¬ 
ever, it proved to be extremely difficult. There was no 
apparent oxygen uptake by cultures in the Lees respirometer, 
even after several hours, using the untreated cultures, or

the cultures moistened with either distilled water or very 
dilute sucrose solution* Similarly the amount of carbon 
dioxide produced over a period of one to three days was 
very small* Hence it was concluded that the organisms 
were probably in some dormant state, as similar much older 
cultures were giving plate counts of several hundred millions 
per gram* 

( 2) Oxygen Uptake of Rh* Meliloti in Soils 

This experiment was in the nature of a preliminary 
trial to obtain some idea of the possibilities of the Lees 
respirometer, as well as to gain information concerning the 
conditions influencing the survival of Rh* meliloti in 
irrigated soils* Surveys of th© nodulation of pea and alfalfa 
fields in the irrigation districts of southern Alberta had 
indicated that conditions were sometimes such that nodulation 
of alfalfa was very poor. This experiment was intended to 
be the beginning of an investigation into possible causes of 
the poor nodulation* 

The soils used were generally low in organic 
matter, except for soil number two* Thus organic materials 
were tried first to determine their effect on the growth of 
rhizobia in these soils, and to determine the length of 
time the effect, if any, would last in th© presence of th© 
general soil population#

When the determinations of oxygen uptake were 
made without any previous incubation of the soil-straw or 
soil-alfalfa mixture, the uptake of oxygen was very large, 
and the experiments could only be carried on for about 
twenty hours before the limit of measurement of the apparatus 
was reached# There was a much greater oxygen uptake where 
alfalfa was added* Mr# G# S. Cooper, of the Department of 
Plant Science, suggested that the amount of soluble carbo¬ 
hydrates in alfalfa was considerably higher than in wheat 
straw, and this excess was probably the reason for the increased 
oxygen uptake. The higher nitrogen content of the alfalfa 
very likely had some effect on the increased uptake also# 

It was expected that the decomposition of the 
straw and alfalfa by the soil microflora would reduce the 
supply of energy sources easily available to the rhizobia, 
but in turn would break down the more resistant parts of 
the organic matter, and make a certain amount of soluble 
material available. This appears to have been the case# The 
very large oxygen uptakes first obtained were not repeated in 
determinations made after the soil had been incubated for 
10 - 66 days• As the incubation time was increased, there was 
a progressively smaller increase in oxygen uptake, as the 
added organic matter was broken down, leaving the more resistant 
materials as the easily available ones were used up. In some 
cases, the oxygen uptake was greater where straw rather than 
alfalfa was added, after the soil had been incubated for a

fairly long period of time* This might he taken to mean 
that the straw was less readily broken down than the alfalfa 
at first, thus leaving more energy materials fairly easily 
available for a longer period of time. However, the evidence 
is not conclusive on this point, as the results were not 
consistent enough to be considered very significant. 

The type of soil and possibly its previous 
handling had some effect on the results obtained. Oxygen 
uptake was highest for the longest time in soil number six, 
a heavy soil which has been farmed very well for a good many 
years. Uptake was lowest in soil number three, a much lighter 
soil, also farmed intensively for about fifty years. 

Steam sterilization of the soil undoubtedly 
affected the results obtained. In previous unpublished 
experiments on the oxygen uptake of the unsterilized soils, 
soil number two showed a definitely greater uptake than did 
the others. Yet when steam sterilized in the presence of 
fresh organic matter, this soil had the lowest oxygen uptake 
of all. Simpson (59), Malowany, as reviewed by Simpson, 
and many other workers found that heat sterilization of the 
soil produced chemical changes in organic matter. It is 
probable that under some conditions toxic materials are 
produced. Sterilization by some other means, such as the 
use of ultrasonic methods or of non-persistent organic agents, 
if it could be accomplished without producing as great changes 
in the soil, would improve the resultso

The general form of the curves obtained indicates 
that after about two days the oxygen uptake by the bacteria 
drops to a very small amount. Plate counts on the soils at 
this stage would certainly show the presence of extremely 
large numbers of microorganisms* This is another indication 
that rhizobia in the soil are probably in a state of dormancy 
or semi-dormancy a good deal of the time* 

(3) Dilution Counts of Rhizobia in Soils 

If the numbers of rhizobia in soil were low, 
nodulation would of course be poor. It was found by Wilson 
(80, 81) and Thorne and Brown (63) that In Iowa the numbers 
of root nodule bacteria in the soils where the appropriate 
legumes were grown were In the neighborhood of hundreds of 
thousands per gram. Accordingly counts were made on soils 
from the fertilizer trial alfalfa plots near Edmonton, and 
on a sample from the University Soils farm alfalfa plots, 
where nodulation of alfalfa had been very poor for two or 
three years. However, it was found that Rh. meliloti were as 
numerous in two of these soils as in the soils studied by 
Wilson (80, 81) and by Thorne and Brown (63), and In only 
one soil were they rather scarce. It is probable that the 
very dry growing seasons affected the nodulation, rather than 
the lack of rhizobia in the soil.

(4) Fertilizer Trials on Alfalfa Fields 

No effect was observed on application of ferti¬ 
lizers to alfalfa plots. In the Edmonton area this was 
probably because of the dry summer® In the Irrigated areas, 
it is probable that some other factor or factors influenced 
the results obtained, as the soils of both the Brooks and 
Magrath areas are known to be low in phosphorus ® It is 
very likely that no minor element deficiency existed, but 
the lack of yield increase when phosphate was applied was 
very likely because of phosphate fixation® The fertilizers 
were of necessity applied broadcast, and it has been found 
in Alberta and elsewhere that it is usually necessary to 
drill in phosphate fertilizer at seeding time to obtain any 
appreciable results. This was probably the reason for the 
lack of effects observed*

SUMMARY 


(1) A study was made, first, of several factors 
influencing the growth and survival of rhizohia in humus 
and soil cultures, and second, of the oxygen uptake of 

Rh. meliloti in sterilized soils to which organic materials 
had been added* 

(2) The moisture content of the cultures was important; 
as water was lost, the numbers of rhizobia decreased* 

(5) The addition of sucrose to the humus cultures 
ordinarily produced large increases in the numbers of these 
bacteria. The addition of phosphorus, potassium or calcium 
carbonate also seemed to increase the numbers of organisms 
present, but the increase was less marked,, 

(4) The addition of sodium nitrate alone to the cultures 
appeared to stimulate the growth of the rhizobia. The 
addition of sucrose as well as nitrates produced a very large 
drop in the numbers of these bacteria. 

(5) Mineral oil did not appear to depress the numbers 
of rhizobia in the humus cultures to any great extent. 


(6) Sodium alginate inhibited the growth of these

bacteria if added to the medium in quantities large enough 
to affect the physical properties of the medium noticeably,, 

(7) Screw-top glass jars for packaging commercial 
legume inoculants appeared to be an improvement over the 
paper cartons now in use* 

(8) Refrigeration of the cultures was an excellent 
method of maintaining large numbers of living bacteria for 
a long time* 

(9) The water loss from refrigerated cultures was con¬ 
siderably less than from cultures held at room temperatures* 

(10) Oxygen uptake of Rh* melilotl in soil is discussed* 
The type of organic matter added to the soil, the texture 
and previous history of the soil and the method of soil 
sterilization all appeared to influence the oxygen uptake* 

(11) Dilution counts of Rh* melilotl in four field soils 
showed a fairly wide variation in numbers of bacteria in 
soils from the Edmonton area* 

(12) Fertilizer trials on several Alberta alfalfa fields 
showed no increases in yieldo Possible reasons for these 
results ar8 suggested*
