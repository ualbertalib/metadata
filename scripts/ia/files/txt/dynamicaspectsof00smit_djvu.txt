FOREWORD 


"♦..active; •♦.opposed to static and potential : belonging 
to, or characterized by, energy; forceful.' 1 

Thus in a dozen words Webster defines the adjective ‘’dynamic 
which is a key term in the title of this paper. For the purposes of 
this study the word has been taken at all times to connote movement, 
and it has been interpreted in terms of personal, immediate assis¬ 
tance to Education students “on the job” in this University. Such 
assistance as the experimental group received was not offered to 
them as they sat dutifully in a classroom, but as they moved about 
the halls, conducted lessons in the practice school, or experienced 
any of the numerous changes which make up the transition from High 
School to University life. To that extent, at least, the study has 
been “dynamic”. 

To seek an increase in the degree of personal interest taken 
in the individual teacher-in-training and the amount of personal 
assistance made available to him is only to keep step with modern 
procedure. In our time an ever-increasing amount of attention is 
being given to the subject of personal aid and guidance. To-day 
most large industrial concerns provide guidance services for their 
personnel; universities not only give guidance to their own students 
but offer courses in it, so that their graduates may go forth 
equipped to counsel others. And perhaps most important of all, the 
Provincial Departments of Education, through specially chosen and 
trained personnel, are urgently advancing programmes of guidance for 
use in the school. 

Of the many groups new receiving various forms of counsel¬ 
ling, few, in the opinion of the writer, stand more urgently in need 
of its benefits than the teachers. Since by the very nature of

their work, which is essentially personal, they will be expected both 
to give and to receive counselling, it would be difficult to exag¬ 
gerate the importance of guidance in the teacher-training programme. 
The following pages will be devoted to the task of outlining a recent 
experiment in this field.

CHAPTER I 


THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 


A Twofold Purpose 

Fundamental to this paper is the thesis that increased and 
personalized guidance to Education students will produce better 
teachers for the schools. From this thesis stems the twofold purpose 
of the study, which may be stated as follows: 

a) To provide evidence which will substantiate the thesis 
cited above, namely, that our students will leave the 
Faculty of Education as more effective teachers, poten¬ 
tially, if they have been better-counselled, 

b) To assemble information which may be useful later in 
introducing programmes of personal assistance in teacher¬ 
training institutions. 

Three Pertinent Questions 

Though all work done in the course of the experiment has centred 
around this double aim, three major questions were thought to have 
direct bearing upon its fulfilment. Set down in ascending order 
of importance, ana accompanied by brief suggestions as to how they 
will be answered in the pages which follow, these questions read as 
follows: 

a) What kind of people are entering the teaching profession? 
In answering this question prominence has been given to 
the strengths and v*eaknesses of each student's personality, 
particularly at the time of selection, when care was taken 
to choose as representative a group as possible.

b) What is the importance of the teacher 7 s personality? 

It would seem desirable that the people selected to teach 
our children should be at least as free from personality 
defects, social limitations, and inhibitions, as are 
those chosen for training in such other faculties as law, 
medicine or commerce. This point has been kept in mind 
at all stages of the experiment—in the selection of the 
students themselves, in the work done with them during 
the term, and in the final compilation of the case stud¬ 
ies. Some comment upon the personality of the student 
concerned will be found in each of the fourteen case 
studies which comprise Chapter III, and an attempt to 
suggest desirable personality traits as revealed in the 
course of this study will be made in the final chapter of 
the paper. 

c) Is there a possibility, through more direct contact with 
the students in such a teacher-training institution as 
this, of doing a more constructive, professionally-weighted 
job of teacher-training? 

For twenty-three years to the writer’s certain knowledge—and, 
one feels sure, for many years longer than that—professionalism has 
been earnestly and convincingly stressed by the staffs of the various 
teacher-training institutions in this province. And yet, compared 
with that of other professions, the professional consciousness of our 
teachers as a class leaves much to be desired. Time after time one 
meets teachers who feel that they must apologize for the fact that 
they are teachers. It is difficult to account for this frail sense 
of professional pride among so many members of a profession which is 
obviously one of the most useful in our culture, which is now at least

moderately well paid, and which receives ardent lip service from all 
quarters as a truly ’’noble 11 field of endeavour. It would seem that 
at least one reason for this absence of professional pride and re¬ 
sponsibility may be found in the rather formal manner in which fresh¬ 
man students are usually given their first introduction to the concept 
of professionalism. It has been felt that constructive work could be 
done in this and other areas of teacher-training if a more direct 
contact could be maintained between student and institution, pre¬ 
ferably by means of some form of guidance done on a distinctly per¬ 
sonal basis. 

We repeat, then, that in attempting to fulfil the twofold 
purpose stated above, three points have been consistently stressed— 
the importance of teacher personality, the desirability of considering 
a fair cross-section of the entrants to the teaching profession, and 
the belief that more direct professor-student contact in this Faculty 
will make way for a more constructive job of teacher-training. The 
actual design of the experiment is laid down in Chapter II, and is 
worked out in each of the case studies. 

Preliminary Procedures 

The preliminary procedures which led up to the experiment 
may be briefly outlined as follows. For the study itself fourteen 
first-year students (seven men and seven women) were selected by the 
writer from a larger group submitted by their professors. Of this 
group about eight 'were considered backward when chosen in mid-November, 
three or four appeared to be average students, and three seemed 
superior—not only on the basis of their intelligence quotients and 
academic performance up to that time, but with regard to personality 
traits as well.

Called together in mid-November, 1948, these students were 
told that they had been chosen as an experimental group, and that the 
purpose of the experiment would be twofold—to investigate the effect 
of increased personal assistance to the student-teacher, and to com¬ 
pile any information so acquired for purposes of future reference* 

All professed themselves willing to take part in the experiment. They 
were asked to feel free to bring in their problems at any time, a 
specific time and place being set aside for regular interviews. 

During the winter months a fair number of voluntary appointments were 
made and kept by the students, but most of the assistance given was 
the result of a scheduled programme planned for them* The nature 
and scope of this assistance will constitute the subject-matter of 
Chapter II. 

So far the business of this chapter has been to present with 
suitable explanations, the purpose with which the study was under¬ 
taken. It is now proposed to estimate to what extent that purpose 
has been fulfilled* 

Absence of a Control Group 

In a subjective study of this kind one weakness becomes 
apparent immediately to any informed observer—the absence of a 
control group* This lack has been recognized from the earliest 
stages of the experiment, and it will be readily admitted that, 
had it been practicable to use a control group,the results would 
have been more valid and the study more convincing as a whole. To 
select a control group that would have had any real value, however, 
would have been a very difficult undertaking. To provide a useful 
basis of comparison, the members of such a group would have had to

approximate those of the experimental group in numerous ways. Stu¬ 
dent for student, the two groups would have had to match as to age, 
sex, marital status, home town, rural or urban upbringing, sibling 
frequency, racial origin and education of parents. It would have 
been necessary that, student for student, the two groups be as nearly 
identical as possible in the matter of test scores - scholastic, 
achievement, aptitude, occupational interest, personality, and the 
rest. Finally, the investigator would have been confronted with the 
very real problem of matching fourteen pairs of young people who were 
of equal enthusiasm and reliability with regard to such details as 
the actual work to be done and the keeping of the inconvenient 
appointments which were often a necessary adjunct of this work. To 
perform such a feat was obviously impracticable in a total freshman 
population of 514. (i) The choice lay, therefore, between some un¬ 
satisfactory compromise involving the use of two ill-matched groups, 
and the decision to dispense with the control group altogether. The 
latter decision vra,s taken. 

Values of the Study 

To admit this weakness, however, is by no means to deny that 
the study possesses certain strengths. It is proposed to name a 
few of these briefly at this time. 

In the first place, the techniques used in this study, what¬ 
ever may have been their effectiveness, have been rather thoroughly 
tested, so that their reliability for this kind of work can now be 
assessed with some accuracy by future investigators. A case in point 
is the use of the wire recorder, which not only did well the job planned 
for it, but also proved invaluable in the establishing of rapport. 

(l) This figure includes attendance at both Edmonton and Calgary branches.

Some value also lies in the actual help extended to the stu¬ 
dents. There is no doubt that the majority of these students bene- 
fitted, in one way or another, from the assistance they received in 
the course of this experiment. This is especially true of the work 
done in the areas of practice teaching, discussion of test scores, 
and speech. Both on the basis of their own assurances and of reports 
which have come in recently it seems reasonable to assume that the 
time spent in this study was not wasted. 

Furthermore, a good deal was found out about the best way in 
which this personal help should be made available. For example, it 
was learned, and will be indicated in the fin&l chapter, that the 
volume and effectiveness of this help could be greatly increased by 
making certain changes in the status of the persons who gave it. 

A third value of this study lies in the fact that it gave an 
opportunity for the students to talk freely. In a situation where 
they found themselves at ease, they expressed views upon such topics 
as the status of the teaching profession and their conception of 
professional ethics. It is felt that these discussions were not 
only useful to the investigator in his work of evaluation, but also 
to the student, to whom the mere formulation and expression of ideas 
concerning his future profession usually proved a stimulating and 
constructive exercise. An example of this is found in Case No. 9, 
that of Joe Campbell, whose somewhat off-hand manner had caused cer¬ 
tain persons to feel concern about his sincerity earlier in the term. 
He now took advantage of one interview to express a keen appreciation 
of the importance of high ethical conduct within the profession. 

The above values are believed to be inherent in this study. 

If these values are sufficiently substantial to make the study of

some use in the future, one of the central aims of the experiment 
will have been accomplished, A second reading of the case studies 
reveals that, although the study as a whole might have been made 
more effective by one or two changes in technique, enough has been 
accomplished in a positive way to make worthwhile the time spent by 
both the experimental group and those who worked with them.

Chapter II 

THE MAJOR PROCEDURES CARRIED OUT IN THE STUDY 

1. Completion of the Interview Form 

This form was constructed for the purpose of obtaining informa¬ 
tion concerning the background of each student* It was completed by 
the writer in consultation with the students, each of v/hom was assured 
that all information supplied would be treated as confidential, and 
that such information, if used in any ensuing study, would be given 
as pertaining to anonymous case studies only. The Interview Form, a 
copy of which appears as Form I of the Appendix, is divided into 
ten major sections. Of these the first three deal with vital statis¬ 
tics as applied to the student, his father, and his mother. Sections 
4 and 5 are designed to reveal something of the student*s personal 
and scholastic history, while Sections 6 and 7 show the current term 
marks for November, December, February and April respectively, and 
the scores obtained on a number of standard tests administered during 
the year. Section 8 deals with home and cultural background. Section 
9 with the student’s campus record. The last section is reserved for 
a statement of special problems. 

The Interview Form has proved to be useful, both in getting needed 
information and in establishing rapport . 

£. Completion of the General Information Form 

This form, unlike the Interview Form, was completed by the student 
working alone. He was asked to supply freely such information as he 
wished concerning home statistics, pre-university occupation, time 
spent in the final year of High School, names and quantities of books.

magazines, and comic strips read, hobbies, and other miscellaneous 
experiences. 

3. Statements by Principals of the High Schools Last Attended 

It was felt that a more nearly complete picture of each student's 
background, both as to home and school, could be obtained if the 
principals of the high schools were consulted. Accordingly a cir¬ 
cular letter and a questionnaire, copies of both of which appear in 
the Appendix (Forms Ilia and Illb), were sent to the principals of 
the high schools last attended by the members of the group. Answers 
were received from former principals of thirteen students (the four¬ 
teenth student was a displaced person, whose former principal was 
inaccessible). It was possible to talk personally with four of the 
principals; the others made satisfactory returns by mail, though one 
principal was reluctant to reveal information concerning the student's 
family background. 

4. Observation of Rural Practice Teaching 

As part of their training in the Faculty of Education, all 
students registered for the Junior Elementary and Intermediate Cer¬ 
tificate have been required during the current year (1948-1949) to 
spend a substantial period of time in observation and practice teach¬ 
ing in rural schools. These schools are located in school divisions 
adjacent to the city of Edmonton. The writer decided to observe 
the nine M Junior E. and I." students in the group at least once as 
they worked in the rural schools to which they had been assigned. 

The purpose of this enterprise was to note strong and weak points in 
the student's work and later to offer suggestions where needed. 

This procedure was carried out; each of the students concerned

was visited once, four of them twice, and one of them three times. 

The method used was to pay a call, necessarily short as a rule, to 
the student during one of the half-days when he was in charge of the 
school, to observe him at work, to note down impressions upon a form 
designed for the purpose, and then at a later date to discuss the 
lesson with him. A copy of the form used is included in the Appen¬ 
dix (Form IV). 

5. Speech Training 

The speech of any teacher is surely one of the most important 
tools of his trade. Diction which is muffled and indistinct, consis¬ 
tent mispronunciation of certain words, excessive sibilance, mono¬ 
tonous delivery in oral reading or direct speech—all or any one of 
these can mar the best-laid plans of any teacher for a successful, 
convincing lesson. 

It was early decided to devote a portion of the time allotted 
to this study to the task of directing the students’ attention to 
their speech traits , good and bad. In doing so the writer was for¬ 
tunate in having access to the Faculty of Education’s ware recorder. 
This instrument proved most useful, not only in speech aid, but in 
establishing rapport between the students and the writer himself. 

This part of the programme of personal assistance was introduced 
by means of general discussions on the importance of good speech 
habits. Much was made of the fact that few of us have really heard 
our own voices. The next step was to introduce the wire-recorder, 
which was used by all students in the group at least four times during 
the winter. The first occasion was an informal gathering for the 
purpose of becoming familiar with the machine and overcoming "mike- 
fright”. On the second occasion each student read the selection

shown in Form V of the Appendix, after which he heard it played back, 
criticized his own speech where he noticed weaknesses, and heard 
comments and criticisms from the writer. The third "run" consisted 
of a reading, forty seconds long, of the passage from Hamlet, Act 1“ 

Sc. iv, beginning, "So oft it chances in particular men... 11 . 

This reading by each of the fourteen students was carefully 
kept, immediately in front of a forty-second blank space on the 
wire, until late in March. The fourth recording consisted of a 
second reading of the same passage, each student filling the biank 
strip left three months before on the wire. In this way comparisons 
were made and improvements, if any, noted. Results were tabulated 
on the form ''Record of Speech Deficiencies", which ajjpears as Form VI 
of the Appendix. 

6. Testing 

A fairly extensive programme of testing was carried out, the 
purpose being both appraisal of the students by the writer and self¬ 
revelation by the students themselves. With the exception of the 
Intelligence Quotients, which it is the writer* s practice never to 
reveal to any student, the results of all tests and inventories were 
discussed with those students who were interested—and the majority 
of the group were interested. 

The tests and inventories used for all students were: 

1. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test (Used both Fall and Spring). 

Z. The Nelson-Denny Vocabulary Test (" 11 " " " ). 

5. The Wellesley Spelling Test " " " « " ). 

4. The Psychological Corporation's Abstract (or Verbal) Reasoning Test. 

5. The Vocational Guidance Centre's Intelligence Test.

6. The Bernreuter Personality Inventory. 

7. The Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory. 

In special cases, and where requested, the Wechsler-Bellevue Intel¬ 
ligence Test, the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and the 
Iowa Placement Examinations for various aptitudes were used. 

The Wellesley Spelling test and the Nelson-Denny Reading and 
Vocabulary tests were given in October, and the same form of the test 
repeated in March for purposes of comparison. It was considered that 
the effect of the learning factor resulting from this duplication would 
be negligible after a five-month lapse. 

The results of all tests will be listed and discussed separately 
in Chapter III which is reserved for the presentation of the fourteen 
case studies. 

7. Information Concerning Audio-Visual Aids 

On the evening of March 9, 1949, Mr. Donald Hamilton of the 
Audio-Visual Aids Branch of the Provincial Department of Education, 
gave the group a short lecture on the facilities available in his 
branch. This was followed by educational films selected from widely 
different fields of instruction. Twelve of the group attended, 
two being unavoidably absent. 

The purpose of this lecture and screening was to give to the 
group some idea of the admirable resources now available in the field 
of audio-visual instruction. It was felt that this was the more 
worth-while in that a number of the school divisions have recently 
purchased projectors, both for motion picture films and for filmstrips. 

8. Voluntary Appointments 

In addition to the specific areas of personal assistance listed 
above, it was possible for the writer to meet and at times help the

students informally, at their own request. Details of the extent 
and effectiveness of this part of the programme will appear in a 
later chapter.

CASE STUDIES 

Introduction 

The writers purpose in this chapter is to set down the case 
histories of the fourteen students who formed the experimental group, 
and to record the results of the experiment in the form of fourteen 
case-studies. In order that these case studies may present as accurate 
a picture as possible of these young people, the following practices 
and rules have been strictly observed: 

a. All students have been treated with complete anonymity. At the 
head of each sub-section a case number has been given, while for 
purposes of reference fictitious names have been assigned to all 
students. 

b. Since it is realized that all the fourteen subjects are still 
living, and that they may in the normal course of events be expected 
to continue to do so for many years to come, a certain amount of 
discretion has been exercised in the writing of this chapter. 

The writer does not wish to expose any member of the group to 
such embarrassment as might result should the identity of each 
or any case become apparent to other members of the group, or to 
the public at large. 

The exercise of such discretion, hovrever, has at no time been 
permitted to bring about the exclusion of information considered 
essential to any usefulness which the study, when completed, may pos¬ 
sess. Where the choice has been found to lie between necessary ac¬ 
curacy and polite consideration, it has generally turned out that 
politeness has been sacrificed. Thus such details as the names of 
the home towns of the students have been readily omitted, while

their racial origins, perhaps almost equally revealing, may have been 
disclosed. 

c. Wherever possible, generalizations and subjective speculations of 
all kinds have been excluded from the main body of each study, it 
having been deemed wise to reserve such material for the final 
summary of each section. While certain phases of each study, such 
as the appraisal of speech deficiencies and the assessment of the 
student’s performance in the classroom, are of necessity arbitrary 
and general in their character, a consistent attempt has been 
made to give precedence to those things which have been found to 
be tangible and measurable in each case. 

d. Wherever rating scales have been used, as in the questionnaire 
sent to the students’ most recent principals, the scale has been 
composed of seven points. Of these, Ho. 1 was considered most 
favorable. No. 4 average, and No. 7 low. (See Form Illb, Appen» 
dix).

No. 1 The Case of Ann i/Vinter 


Ann ! s parents are both dead. They came from Europe and settled 
on a farm in Central Alberta. The father had elementary school 
education, and the mother left school in Europe at the age of ten. 

Mr. Winter died of heart failure in 1938, and his wife of a stroke 
four years later. 

Since the death of her mother Ann has kept house for her brother, 
attending school at the same time. Ann, who was twenty years old on 
coming to University, began school at the age of seven. Her I.Q. was 
measured at 127 on the Vocational Guidance Center Intelligence Test; 
her Departmental rating on the Grade IX finals was I5 A U . She spent 
four years in High School (l). 

Ann’s farm background as an orphan was unusual. It is well 
explained in a letter to the writer from the principal of the High 
School which she last attended; the last two paragraphs of this 
letter are illuminating: 

"...Ann lost both her parents and cannot be considered 
to have had any family life in the usual sense since she was a 
child. As far as I have been able to make out without too 
much prying, she and her brother inherited the family farm and 
carried on by themselves. They had an uncle nearby but apparently 
did not receive as much help from him as might have been expec- 
ted. As a result, they found it hard to make both ends meet. 

The struggle Ann had, and by all accounts it was a struggle, 
seems to have had the effect which might have been expected. She 
seems to have withdrawn into herself and to have shunned outside 
contacts. However, during her last year in school she seemed 
to improve considerably in her social adjustment, and I feel that 
she will turn out satisfactorily. In connection with her lack of 
participation in extra-curricular activities I would like to 
point out that she came to school by school bus from some dis¬ 
tance, and really had little opportunity to take part, most of 
such activities taking place outside of school hours. 


(l) The term If High School" in Alberta includes Grades X, XI and XII.'

"Probably as a result of her experiences, Ann has to an 
amazing degree the qualities of persistence and perseverance. I 
feel that they will carry her through any difficulties which may 
arise from her retiring nature. I would have no objection to 
having her on the staff of my school." 

At the first interview the writer was at once impressed by Ann’s 
extreme shyness. She blushed profusely when spoken to, and seemed 
most distressed at the mention of her parents. She wept during a 
considerable part of this interview, which the writer terminated as 
soon as possible after the signs of distress became evident. This 
weeping never occurred again; instead, Ann’s.self-confidence seemed 
to improve with every interview, though she remained very shy. 

Early in the term Ann’s clothing left much to be desired in respect 
to neatness, cut and general attractiveness. She seemed to improve 
considerably in this regard as the term progressed, and her appearance 
was quite acceptable, by ordinary standards, at the close of the year. 

Ann was consistently regular and dependable in the keeping of 
all appointments, and appeared interested, for the most part, in the 
progress of the experiment. Her social adjustment improved steadily 
throughout the year—indeed, in the matter of sheer improvement, this 
student was probably the most satisfactory member of the group. 

One must always remember her principal’s explanation of Ann’s 
lack of participation in the extra-curricular affairs of her high 
school. She herself states that in the country school which she 
attended before taking her High School grades in town, she was presi¬ 
dent of the students’ union for a time. 

During her term in the Faculty of Education, Ann Winter wrote 
term tests and/or finals in thirteen subjects. These marks appear 


below,

While not outstanding, these marks may be considered satis¬ 
factory; it is also noteworthy that in the majority of cases low 
marks occurred early in the term; the exception to this is in Ed. 

138, where the final was 46$, but previous good marks ensured a 
pass. 

Ann wrote ten tests and inventories of various kinds during 
the term. The scores of these tests and inventories are as follows: (l) 


(l) Nelson-Denny Reading, Nelson-Denny Vocabulary, and Wellesley 
Spelling Tests were given in October, and then repeated on the 
same ’identical 1 test in March.

Again, these tests scores present a favorable picture. It 
will be noted that in the three tests given in Autumn and Spring 
there is, without exception , an improvement in the score. The I.Q. 
is very good, and the score on the Abstract Reasoning Test— 70 %— 
is satisfactory. Discussion of the Bernreuter and Lee-Thorpe scores 
will be better left for the sections to which their profiles are 
attached. They are both quite satisfactory as will be shown later 
in this study. 

Like other students in the Junior E. and I. programme, Ann 


went to a country school for one week of observation in the fall 
term, and for two weeks of practice teaching in the spring term. The

writer visited her in the junior room of the two-roomed school in 
which she was working for one hour and twenty minutes during the 
afternoon of February 15, 1949. He had not entertained very high 
hopes of her performance, because of her acute shyness and lack of 
poise on former occasions. To his surprise, her performance seemed 
to justify the statement above, by Ann’s principal, that he would 
have no objective to having her on his staff. Excerpts from the 
writer’s report on the visit appear below: 

T, A pleasant surprise. I confess that I had gone to __ 

School expecting little from Miss Winter in the way of effec¬ 
tive teaching. It was most gratifying to discover that in front 
of a class she not only read far more fluently and with better 
expression than I had ever heard her read before, but that she 
held the attention and respect of the class at all times, 
showing resourcefulness on several occasions... Her weakness 
still lies in her nervousness, lack of self-confidence, and 
unconvincing speech. The nervousness will be the hardest of 
these difficulties to overcome ; I have already noted some 
improvement in her self-confidence, and the wire recorder shows 
clearly that her speech and oral reading have improved, though 
they are still far from satisfactory. Since her first recording 
there is a noticeable change for the better, especially in the 
variety of her inflection... If Miss Winter could be given some 
sensible guidance and timely encouragement, and if she could be 
advised by a sympathetic student or professor of her own sex on 
the matters of dress and poise, I believe that there is a fair 
chance that she might develop into a most successful primary 
teacher.' 1 

The section of the official Report on Practice Teaching which is 

known as "General Estimate" is herewith quoted# 

Grade "C" Miss Winter has certainly improved since her last 
visit here. She is a very good worker, a careful conscientious 
student, and willing to do all in her power to accomplish her 
aims in teaching. 

Sgd - 

Demonstration teacher 

Ann’s extracurricular activities on the campus were modest, but 
she entered into them with enthusiasm. They consisted of typing for 
the "Wonderbox" plays, and of playing volleyball in the house league. 
Three professors were asked to comment upon Ann’s progress.

personality, classroom participation, etc. These professors have been 
named simply, "A", ”B", and ”0”; their comments, in the same brief 
form in which they were given, appear below: 

Professor A: ’’Retiring, suffers from past environment; has promise.” 

Professor B: ’’Quiet; more ability than she shows at first; finding 
herself.” 

Professor C: ’’Scores on two recent tests in music— -80% and 70% . 

Ann’s personality is the product of an unusual environment. She 
is naturally shy; this was painfully apparent at the beginning of the 
term, bur she was much more self-possessed by spring. She has a good 
sense of humor. The writer feels that despite her reticence, Ann is 
quite well aware of her mental capacity, which is considerable.

Ann realized this by the end of the term. In the classroom, she 
appeared happy and at ease. 

The Lee-Thorpe profile -which appears below would seem to sug¬ 
gest that she teach elementary science and nature study; her field is 
almost certainly in the lower grades, and her interest in the natural 
sciences should make her work at this level more effective. 



listen to that all day." Apparently she had never before realized 


that her voice is an almost completely "level” monotone. She prompt¬ 
ly went home and practiced reading aloud, in an attempt to introduce 
variety into her voice. By February, when the writer heard her read a 
story to a primary class, she had won a considerable degree of success. 

Certain weaknesses appear on her "Record of Speech Deficiencies." 


These are:

a. The elision of middle consonants— ,, l l il” for "little”, "Squirl" 
for "squirrel", "Bari" for "Barrel", etc, 

b. Abuse of the "u" sound in certain words—"attitood", "dooks", 
"assooms", etc. 

c. Some mispronunciation—"partikler", "bedder". 

In summary Miss Winter may be described as an intelligent young 
lady, keenly interested in teaching, persistent though not aggressive, 
and what is especially important, sufficiently well aware of her very 
considerable mental poivers to profit by the knowledge. Handicapped 
by a starved social background, an almost completely monotonous voice, 
and a shy, retiring nature, she is nevertheless aware of her defi¬ 
ciencies and eager to correct the traits in her personality which 
cause them. She is probably the most improved student in the group. 
She is interested in her chosen profession and blessed with a good 
share of common sense and a quiet sense of humor. It may be said 
with confidence that her prospects of success as a primary teacher 
are good.

No, Z The Case of Elmer Wilson 

Elmer Wilson came to University from a farm in the southern part 
of the province. His father is well-to-do, but in poor health. His 
mother, who was a teacher before marriage, enjoys good health. Both 
parents were born in Eastern Canada and are of Irish extraction. 

Elmer has one older brother and one younger sister. 

Elmer began school at the age of six. He finished Grade XII at 
eighteen, and came to University at nineteen. His rating on the 
Grade IX Departmental Examinations was M A U . Four of his Grade XII 
courses were taken by correspondence, the whole of the High School 
course taking four years. As an alternative choice to Education he 
considered an electrical course at the Technical School in Calgary. 

His most recent High School principal rates Elmer and his family 
high socially. He places the home atmosphere and the relationship 
between parents extremely high. Elmer* s extracurricular interests in 
High School centred around dramatics, students 5 council, and mechanical 
contrivances. He is financing his year by means of a 15 scholarship”, 
the sale of his own cattle, and his own earnings. 

Elmer has an unfortunate nervous habit of which he was not aware 
until the writer pointed it out to him. This is a twitching of one 
of his shoulders, with a simultaneous turning of his head away from 
the person addressed. The result of this habit is to make others 
feel that he is ill at ease; this certainly militated against him in 
the classroom. 

Elmer 5 s academic record in the Faculty of Education, as revealed 
by his course marks, cannot be described as impressive. Both term and 
final gradings appear on the table below:

It will be noted that the Lee-Thorpe profile, with its high 
Business and Natural ratings, points to a career where business acumen 
can be used in conjunction with work outdoors. The farm would seem 
to be indicated. Elmer queried the Mechanical and Scientific ratings, 
contending that on the basis of his experience both should be higher. 

Elmer was observed in the classroom by the miter on two separate 
occasions. An excerpt from the informal report always completed on 
these visits reads as follows: 

"Mr. Wilson 1 s voice is clear enough, but a certain degree 
of nervousness is apparent, both in his voice and in the contor¬ 
tions of his face and body. This is distracting, if not dis¬ 
turbing, to the class. It is felt that Mr. Wilson could overcome 
this difficulty if he were aware of it (l), and if he were to 
make a conscious effort to improve his deportment. ...Personally, 

I believe that Mr. Wilson’s weakness in the classroom is mainly 
traceable to the nervous mannerisms mentioned above, and that if 
her could overcome them he would do much to improve his effective¬ 
ness as a teacher." 


(,1) The writer told Elmer of this nervous mannerism in a later interview,

The "General Estimate" given by the Demonstrator on the official 

"Report on Practice Teaching" reads as follows: 

Grade "C". "Although Mr. Wilson is not entirely at ease 
before a class, and has some difficulty in keeping it under 
control, I believe his sincerity of purpose and good-natured 
approach to the students outweighs these weaknesses. Experience 
and careful preparation will soon give him the necessary poise 
and confidence to master whatever situation arises in the class¬ 
room. " 

Elmer reports no planned extracurricular experience on this 
campus. 

As in all other case studies, the three professors commenting 
upon this student will be assigned letters of the alphabet instead of 
names. Their comments appear below: 

Professor "A" Not well integrated; hoT/ever, will ask questions and 
participate in class; some sense of humor. 

Professor "B" Nice boy; poor speller, but on a reading test where 
a score of 32 is normal for Grade XII, he scored 47. 
Poor score on Arithmetic tests; trying hard. 

Professor "D" Shy; tired all the time; yawns constantly—but not 
from lack of interest. 

Owing to the unfortunate mannerism mentioned above, Elmer appears 
to be constantly ill at ease and lacking in poise. This gives 
the impression that he is not confident, but of a somewhat apologetic 
personality—which is actually not the case at all. 

There is nothing exceptional in Elmer’s Bernreuter profile, which 


is shown below:

It will be noted that this profile is almost perfectly balanced, 
centering about the fiftieth percentile, with a minimum and maximum 
range of 41 and 69 respectively. 

A further sidelight on this student’s personality was supplied 
by a former divisional school superintendent who had visited the country 
school attended by Elmer Wilson when the latter was in Grade IX. This 
observer stated that even then Elmer was nervous and shy, but that 
he was a n stand-out' 1 , insofar as ability and achievement were concerned, 
in his school* 

Elmer professed an interest in teaching early in the term, and 
about mid-term requested information concerning a transfer from the 
Junior Elementary and Intermediate course to the Bachelor of Education 
programme. He was taken to the General Office of the Faculty of 
Education, where the information was supplied.

On the Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory, the profile 
of which is shown below, a low rating was given in the Mechanical 
and Scientific fields* Elmer’s contention, mentioned above, that 
these ratings were altogether too low, may have some basis in fact 
inasmuch as his most recent principal states that one of Elmer’s 
hobbies in High School was ’’mechanical contrivances”* 



Elmer’s work with the wire recorder revealed a tendency to 
muffled speech, a pronounced hesitancy in both reading and conversa- 

' 

tion, and a rather hoarse, gravelly quality of voice. All these 
. operated against him during his classroom performances, and undoubtedly 


were partly responsible for his failure in practice teaching. In 


addition, he mispronounced such vrords as ’’squirrel”, "pretty”, "Dukes”, 
and "attitude”. 

Elmer Wilson is an intelligent young man with a rural background, 
who was probably very badly placed in this Faculty. In view-of his own 
conviction that his mechanical aptitude is far in excess of the Lee-

Thorpe rating, and his fondness for work among machines, it is con¬ 
ceivable that he might have succeeded either in the Agricultural or 
the Industrial Arts pattern of the four-year Bachelor of Education 
programme. 

There is little further to be said on the subject of his failure, 
which was sufficient to relegate him to Category IV (l). His failure 
was complete, leaving no room for doubt, and no profit can accrue 
at this point from time spent in deploring it. In a later chapter, 
however, some comment may be made as to the reasons for this failure, 
and the measures which might have been taken to prevent it.

No, 3 The Case of Charles lounger 

Charles lives in Edmonton with his mother and younger sister, now 
in Grade XI in High School, His father, who was a United Church 
minister, died of cancer at the age of 56, in 1946, Mr. lounger 
was bom in Belfast, Ireland, and Mrs, Younger in Quebec. Mrs, 
Younger’s pre-marital occupation was teaching, in which she is still 
employed. Her health is good. 

Charles began school at age 5 years 11 months, and graduated 
from High School with full Senior Matriculation at age 17 years 
9 months, having spent three years in High School. His Departmental 
rating on the Grade IX examinations was ”A”. 

He had only the usual childhood diseases, and few of these. 

He does not read magazines, but read four books during the summer 
vacation of 1948. He was at all times very keen about this experi¬ 
ment; for example, he requested tests other than those usually 
given. His most recent High School principal and three members of 
the High School staff were all enthusiastic about Charles’ High 
School record and also about the home atmosphere, which the princi¬ 
pal rated high. The principal rated Charles’ social adjustment and 
maturity just above average however (3/7). Comments about Charles 
by three of his teachers are as follows: 

Mr. X: A fine boy. Good musician. Active in Young People’s work. 

A leader at ___ United Church. 

Mr. Y: A good student. 

Mr. Z: A good lad, and fine student. One of our best boys. 

From the comments of Charles’ principal, his teachers, and 
himself, it has been possible to obtain a good picture of his 
extracurricular experiences during his High School years. He did

The writer was able to observe Charles once only in his rural 

practice room. This room was the upper one in a two-room rural school. 

The visit lasted for one hour and ten minutes, during which time 

Charles taught two lessons. Comments from the writer 1 s report on these 

lessons appear below: 









J

■fJO-i.

"Mr. Younger taught two lessons while I was present. The 
first, which presumably was prepared beforehand, moved very 
slowly... The second lesson, which was handed to him without 
warning, was much the better piece of work... Mr. Younger’s 
voice is one of his major assets. I had discovered previously, 
in the course of work with the wire recorder, that he has a 
voice of unusual vigor and volume; in the classroom I learned 
that he is able to restrain it very well. His vocabulary is 
superior to that of most of the students whom I have observed. 

n The atmosphere in the room was satisfactory; it seemed 
rather tense when I first entered, but it improved quickly. 

The students, while freely acknowledging Mr. Younger as the 
man in authority, showed a healthy tendency to disagree with him 
on one or two points. He handled these situations sympathe¬ 
tically and successfully. 

"On the whole, the performance of this student was adequate, 
but not quite up to the expectations I had entertained in the 
light of him home background, his admittedly superior intelli¬ 
gence, and the extremely favorable recommendations accorded him 
by his high school teachers." 

Below is a copy of the "General Estimate" of this student as 

recorded on the official report by his demonstration teacher: 

Grade "B". Mr. Charles Younger has the makings of a very good 
teacher. He is interested in his surroundings—is alert and 
resourceful. He has versatility which will stand Mm in good 
stead. He showed good mental balance—diplomatically tactful— 
thus preventing too much familiarity with the class. Mr. 
Younger’s personality is such that the children responded well." 

Charles kept quite busy apart from his studies. His only im¬ 
portant campus activity ms the Mixed Chorus, but off-campus he was 
occupied with Church and Young People’s activities and Sunday School 
teaching. 

Below are the ratings of three of Charles’ professors, to be 
called Professors "I", "A" and "J" respectively: 

Professor I Bright, alert; one difficulty—"Younger is right"; very 
fixed ideas re English, for example. 

Professor A Bright, alert; one difficulty—"Younger is right"; still, 
will go places. 

Professor J Bright, alert; probably over-confident; needs a few 
knocks.

Below is his Bernreuter profile; he queried the extreme non- 
aggressive rating, and was much concerned about his high emotional 
instability score. The first of these points was probably well- 
taken; as to the second the writer is not so sure*

No one can deny that Charles is interested in teaching at present. 
He has taken a remote and difficult vacation school for the months of 
May and June, and before leaving he was at great pains to secure 
suitable books and supplies, partly at his own expense, in order to 
gain and hold the interest of the "problem” group with whom he will 
have to deal. 

Following is his Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory 
profile which seems to point to either teaching, which he has selected, 
or the ministry, which he has considered*

Charles was at all times most interested in the work with the 
wire recorder, and was keen to practice upon it. He has an unusually 
loud, clear voice } not at all unpleasant 9 but one which must be used 
with restraint. 

In summary it may be stated that Charles Younger is unusually 
well endowed for the profession which he has chosen. His mental 
capacity is well above average; his personality is engaging and 
virile in the extreme; his attitude towards his chosen profession 
is one of keen interest; and throughout the year he has shown indus¬ 
try and vigor in all his undertakings. 

On the other hand this student is not without certain handicaps^ 
and it has been noted that the advantage accruing from his intel¬ 
ligence, his originality and his industry, is partly discounted by 
certain rather undesirable traits. Two of these are his frequent 
impatience with other people’s plans , and his almost constant readi-

ness to denounce the methods employed by those under whom he works. 
Accompanying these characteristics is one which has already been 
pointed out in this paper by two of his professors—the conviction 
that "lounger is right". It is the writer’s opinion, however, that 
while Charles probably does "need a few hard knocks", he will, despite 
the personality handicaps enumerated above, probably develop into an 
extremely effective teacher. This would probably be best accomplished 
by the simple process of the mellowing which usually accompanies ex¬ 
perience, together with a more abundant self-knowledge which unfor¬ 
tunately will not necessarily accompany experience, but will result 
only from conscious effort on this student’s part.

No. 4 The Case of William Mantinga 

William’s case is an unusual one, in that he came from Europe as 
a displaced person, in the summer of 1948, and enrolled in the Faculty 
of Education the same autumn. His father was a farmer in a North- 
European country. He was educated to the ’’public school” level, and 
he enjoys good health. William’s mother,also received this level of 
education, her pre-marital occupation being house-keeping. 

William, who is 27 years old, began school at eight, having 
been introduced to the ’’three r’s” at home. He finished High 
School at twenty, after five years’ attendance. He had many ’’grim” 
experiences during World War II, and since the end of the war has 
spent some time in the University of Hamburg, He states that his 
preference as to school subjects has been History, and that he has 
always been very weak in Mathematics. He is enrolled in the four- 
year Bachelor of Education course here. 

William has a very mature mind. His low I.Q. score—91—cannot 
be considered valid; it was probably due to language difficulties. 
There was an improvement in his standing throughout the year despite 
worry over financial difficulties, which were so great that at one 
time he thought he would have to discontinue. 

William states that he has always regarded school as a means to 
an end rather than with enthusiasm. His extracurricular career in 
Europe was not mentioned, and his principal, of course, was not 
contacted. 

In view of his obvious handicaps, William has done fairly well 
academically. His term marks, listed below, are mediocre, with only 
one failure, and the writer has been given to understand (not by 
William) that this failure was partly attributable to his inability 
to understand one of the professors.

This student lived a considerable distance from the University 
and had to work for a living* As a result his campus activities were 
restricted to one field—dramatics. 

The opinions of three of William’s professors were as follows: 

Professor I Energetic; talks well. I am not sure he is well placed 
here. Has worked hard. 

Professor E Good scholar; interested; has done well despite his 
language handicap. 

Professor H Has maturity in background; lacks any facility In the 
idiom of our language. He is doing special written 
work for me. Shows keen interest in the results as I 
check his work. 

William is a pleasant person to meet—frank and engaging, and 
popular on the campus. 

The normality of William’s Bernreuter Personality profile is 


noteworthy

For obvious reasons this student's speech is greatly retarded. 

His work with the wire-recorder revealed glaring deficiencies early 
in the experiment, and the writer urged him to come for extra aid. 
However, for various reasons, ostensibly the remoteness of his lodgings 
from the campus, /illiani kept few appointments for speech training and 
practice. It must be added that on the few occasions when this student 
did attend, some characteristics of his speech, for example his pro¬ 
nunciation of the middle consonants in sucli vjords as "pretty" and 
"skating" was admirable—far superior to the treatment of the same 
words by most Canadians in the group. 

William Mantinga is a young man of good intelligence and unusual¬ 
ly rich background. He is rather strongly opinionated, and inclined 
to be critical. He ms, in the matter of the keeping of appointments, 
the least reliable of the group. The writer feels, however, that his 
absences were rather the result of deliberate choice than of any 
sense of irresponsibility; at all times William left the impression 
(which, admittedly, may be erroneous) that he found the work rather 
elementary and boring. 

In any case, it is certain that this student is learning to 
speak English in a needlessly difficult and expensive way. It is the 
opinion of the writer that William would have been well advised to 
have taken a job for one year, and thus to have acquired some faci¬ 
lity in the language before plunging into a University course. Thus 
he would have earned some money at a time when jobs were plentiful 
and would have, been better equipped to cope with his courses when 
he did come in. 

At present it is difficult to forecast how successful this 
student will be during the remainder of his four-year course; his per-

degree to which he will be successful in adjusting this performance 
upward is unpredictable at this time*

No, 5 The Case of Susan Carter 

Susan was raised in a small city. Her parents are both still 
quite young, of Canadian birth and Anglo-Saxon origin, lit?. Carter 
has been very prominent in political and community affairs. He is a 
successful merchant and holds Senior Matriculation plus one year’s 
college. His health is not very good; he has a heart condition 
which, while not serious, must be watched constantly. 

Mrs. Carter spent 12 years as a primary teacher prior to her 
marriage. She held a first class teaching certificate and has 
fairly good health except for some trouble with her back. She is a 
club-woman. 

Susan walked early (10 months) and talked early. She began • 
school at six and completed her matriculation at nineteen, having 
been delayed one year because of ill health. She spent five years 
in High School, having been '’recommended'* because of good term standing 
through Grade IX and all High School grades. She took one course— 
History—by Correspondence. She is an extremely intelligent girl, 
her.I.Q. on two reputable tests being shown as five points above the 
nearest score registered for any member of the group. 

For several years Susan has been seriously hampered by illness. 

A glandular trouble (thyroid) caused -fainting during the summer of 
1948, and also during her first two or three months at University. 

These spells were misinterpreted, at first, by certain persons; it 
has now been definitely established, however, that Susan was suf¬ 
fering from thyroid deficiency and was certainly not well during the 
early part of the term. 

Susan has two younger brothers, both of whom, she says, are 
"very kind" to her. The home atmosphere, both by her own account

and by that of her most recent principal, is definitely a happy one* 
With regard to her health, the principal had this to say: 

”Susan has had a severe handicap to overcome in the past 
few years in the matter of health, which prevented her from 
completing her schooling in the normal way* 1 ’ 

Susan appears to have had a fairly active extracurricular life 
in High School. She was a member of the. Drama Club and the Radio 
Club; she was a member of the Students’ Executive for one year, and 
was editor of the High School pa.per for one year. There appears to 
have been little interest in sport—probably because of her indif¬ 
ferent health. She reads a fairly good class of magazine and read 
five books during the summer vacation of 1948. 

Susan’s academic record on the campus has been disappointing. 
Her marks follow:

On this campus Susan has limited her extracurricular activities to 
Faculty Dramatics and the Radio Club. She has been relatively suc¬ 
cessful in both. 

Three of Susan’s professors expressed their opinions of her 
ability, class response and personality. Thier comments are reported 
below: 

Professor E: One of the brighter students; participation not marked. 

Professor F: Highly intelligent; adequate participation; "fragile 11 
personality—-opposite of robust in every way. 

Professor D: Capable of assuming responsibility; good dramatic 

ability—smooth temperament. Has left very favorable 
impression. 

This student’s manner is quite pleasing. She is very intelligent, 
but though she is aware of her own ability she does not appear to have 
permitted this knowledge to make her conceited. Her glandular trouble 
may be the cause of a certain nervousness and a hesitancy of speech 
which is apparent. After overcoming her illness two or three months 
after the beginning of the term, she appeared to the writer to be in

a much more settled state of mind. She was given a Bernreuter 
Personality Inventory with fairly satisfactory results, but owing to 
the fainting early in the term, it was decided to ask her to complete 
the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory as a check. The result, 
an almost perfectly normal, '’middle-of-the-road” picture, was most 
gratifying. Both profiles are shown below;

A further comment upon Susan's personality is to be found in the 
rating supplied by her most recent High School principal. He places 
her relatively high in popularity with her fellow-students and in 
general social adjustment and maturity. 

At no time has Susan expressed great enthusiasm for teaching. 

In reply to the question "Why Teaching" on the Interview Form (Ap¬ 
pendix, Form I) she answered, "I decided in half an hour, though I'd 
always hoped to teach drama and English." She had considered Arts 
and Science as an alternative to the Faculty of Education. 

The Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory shows a high pre¬ 
ference for the mechanical and artistic fields, which seems reason¬ 
able. Susan queried the comparatively low natural rating (50th 
percentile). The profile follows:

student in the group; the tone of her voice, also, is normally-very 
pleasant. There is some slight room for improvement in her pronuncia¬ 
tion ("sootable", "squirl") and once or twice a harsh vowel sound 
("loud”) was noted. In general, however, her voice is a cultivated 
and effective instrument. 

In summary it may be said that Susan Carter is exceptional intel¬ 
ligent, She has been handicapped not only during the current term, 
but over a period of at least 18 months preceding it, by serious 
glandular trouble. The result has been a mediocre record in a case 
where a brilliant one might have been expected. This girl, however, 
furnished as she is with such good teaching equipment as a keen mind, 
a good background, and an extremely pleasant speaking voice, promises 
to develop into one of the better teaching prospects in this group. 
Against these admirable attributes one must set a slight tendency to 
pose—a tendency which is quite unnecessary in view of her obvious 
gifts. However, in the opinion of the writer, Susan showed definite 
improvement towrard the end of the term both as regards her physical 
health and her personality traits. With three years of her course 
yet to go, and a year behind her in which consistent improvement was 
shown, it seems safe to predict for this student a successful teach¬ 


ing career

No. 6 The Case of Marian Elashcuk 

Marian came to University from a farm in a remote community in 
Northern Alberta. From age seven, when her formal education began, 
she attended a country school until the end of her Grade IX year, when 
she moved to a neighboring town and attended a two-room. High School 
for three years, graduating with her High School diploma at the age 
of seventeen. She states that under both these school experiences 
her attitude toward the school and education has been one of enthus¬ 
iasm. 

Marian’s parents are both second-generation Ukrainians. Her 
father received elementary school education only, is in excellent 
health, and is active in public affairs in his community. Mrs. Elas- 
chuk, a farm girl, proceeded to Grade IX in school. Her health has 
been good except for an operation for goitre and an appendectomy. 

Both parents are still quite young. The grandparents, with whom 
Marian lived while attending High School, vjere described by her last 
principal as "very fine new Canadians". 

Marian walked very early (nine months) and had no sickness other 
than measles during childhood. During the current term, however, she 
has had some goitre trouble. 

This student’s most recent principal paints an extremely favorable 
picture of her home, described as "very stable and affectionate". He 
continued in the same report: 

"Marian obviously has great respect for both her parents and 

her grandparents, who are also proud of her." 

He rates the socio-economic status of the family just above average 
(4/7) (l) and places Marian quite high (2/7) both in popularity with 

(l) In this rating scale No. 1 is considered high, and No. 7 low.

her fellow-students and in social adjustment and maturity. Respect for 
religion has been stressed in the home. There has also been plenty of 
singing, games and music in the evenings and on Sundays. 

Marian was active in the extracurricular life of her High School. 
She competed in elocution contests at music festivals, and went to 
country dances. Of her part in the organized extracurricular programme 
of her school, her principal has this to say: 

"Yearbook, library. Students 1 Union, dozens of committees. 
Students' Employment Bureau, and reading in English, French and 
(I think) Ukrainian. Also did much work at home." 

On the University campus, Marian's record has been relatively 

satisfactory. Of thirteen courses (including Practice Teaching) 

she failed one, Music, and must write a supplemental examination in 

this course. Her other marks, which are good.in relation to the 

average for the group, are listed below:

The writer paid this student one visit while she was. practice 
teaching. Her performance was relatively good* Although she was ill 
on the day of the visit, and had to leave the room for fresh air (the 
room was extremely ill-ventilated, and two of the children were sick 
also) she taught a very successful lesson. Two excerpts from the 
writer’s own report of the lesson, conducted in the Grades I, II and 
III room, are given below: 

'’Miss Elaschuk has a strong clear voice and a pleasant, 
almost jocular manner, which combine to keep the class in good 
spirits at all times. This was especially commendable in view 
of the fact that she was not feeling ’well, and was forced to go 
out of the poorly-ventilated room for fresh air as soon as she 
had completed her lesson. 

"Miss Elaschuk gives promise as a teacher. She is very 
good at ’Spotting’ difficulties and weaknesses. Her blackboard 
and map drills, conducted during the lesson observed, were very 
effective, and her use of the blackboard particularly showed 
good organizing ability.” 

Following is the "General Estimate” and grading as recorded upon 
the official "Report on Practice Teaching" by the Demonstration teacher 
in charge of the room:

Grade "B n . “Miss Elaschuk should be an excellent teacher 
of primary pupils. Her sense of humor and. her strength of per¬ 
sonality should carry her through the days without too much 
trouble." 

Marian omitted campus extracurricular activities during her term 
here, having been advised against them at the infirmary. Nevertheless, 
she made many friends, and was active off the campus in Church Y.P., 
C.G.I.T., and Junior Leader work. 

Three professors expressed themselves concerning Miss Elaschuk 
as follows: 

Professor F: Not highly intelligent; a wholesome, good-hearted girl 
from a happy home; her class participation is good. 

Professor J: She’s good; capable; good organizing ability; I was' 
agreeably surprised; has poise in front of the class. 

Professor B: Reading good (41/ 32); 56%, 81/ and 91/ on three Psycho¬ 
logy tests; written work rated "Good 11 ; working hard. 

Marian has a very pleasant manner; it is obvious that she comes 
from a home where there is plenty of mutual affection. She was not 
the most reliable student in the group, missing a number of appoint¬ 
ments without apparent good reason. She has a good sense of humor, 
much appreciated by the class which she taught. 

Marian is not completely mature; for example, there is a tendency 
to talk constantly of ".My Daddy". One professor noticed this also, 
and said that this tendency had been rather embarrassing during a 
short talk which Marian gave to one of his classes. Her classmates 
sensed it too, and began to glance at each other and wince slightly 
at each reference to "My Daddy".

This student is most enthusiastic about teaching. She was planning 
to relieve a Correspondence Supervisor during May and June of this 
year in a school very near her home, and "could hardly wait". She 
gave as her reason for selecting teaching the simple fact, "I like 
children". She does not mention having considered any alternative 
occupation. 

The Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest Inventory, which follows, 
indicates that teaching is a good choice for this student. If the 
preferenceswhich it shows are valid, she would be successful even 
beyond the primary level, and could teach commercial subjects and the 
arts to the Intermediate School level.

Marian’s voice has good quality and her speech shows no trace of 
her Ukrainian origin. This latter point is interesting, since she has 
spent considerable time with her grandparents, who were born in the 
old country. Some improvement in diction and pronunciation was noted 


during the term. Her errors on the wire recorder were those mady by 
most of the other students—fflerrel” for ’’Barrel 1 ', "forchun" for 
"fortune 11 , "jist" for "just", "Thad if" for "that if". There is also 
a slight thickness in her speech at times. 

All in all, Marian may be characterized as a cheerful, enter¬ 
prising girl of intelligence slightly better than average for this 
group, pleasant in disposition and manner, industrious, sociable, and 
gifted with a lively sense of humor. She lacks maturity and might also 
be accused of a minor tendency toward complacency. Her plentiful 
gifts, however, will more than outweigh! these minor disadvantages, and 
it seems safe to predict for this student a successful career as a 
primary teacher.

No. 7 The Case of James Johnston 

James is of Anglo-Saxon origin. His father, now deceased, was 
born in England, and his mother was born in Eastern Canada of Anglo- 
Saxon stock. Both had elementary education. Mr. Johnston farmed in 
Alberta, and since his death his widow and James 1 elder and only bro¬ 
ther have carried on. There are seven daughters in the family, James 
being the youngest in a family of nine. 

James started school at age six, missed two years after completing 
Junior Matriculation, and obtained his High School Diploma at the age 
of nineteen. His I.Q. Viras measured at 125, and his rating on the 
Grade IX Departmental Examinations was ’’A”. All his High School was 
taken in attendance except Biology 2, which he took by Correspondence. 
He spent four years in High School. He states that he has regarded 
attendance at school as a means to an end, rather than with either 
dislike or enthusiasm. 

This student is unusually quiet and unobtrusive; he shows oc¬ 
casional signs of a sense of humor, however. His I.Q., shown above, 
is three points higher than the average for the group. His most recent 
principal rates him, on a seven-point rating scale where No. 1 is 
high, 5/7 in popularity with his fellow-students, 5/7 in social adjust¬ 
ment and maturity, 2/7 in conduct within the community, and 4/7 in 
attitude toward school. James’ home appears to have been a normal 
one; he states that there was always plenty of company on Sundays and 
in the evenings. He has no worries as to health at present, and the 

only childhood disease he contracted was measles. 

H p 

During the two years prior to his arrival at university James 
stayed at home and assisted on the farm. His reading experience has

been quite limited—a few magazines of inferior standard and four or 
five books per year. His hobbies are skating and riding. This 
seems to be the sum of his cultural background* insofar as he ms able 
to describe it. 

During the four years spent in High School, James took no part 
in extracurricular activities; as the reason for this he points to 
the fact that he lived too far away from the school to participate. 

His principal confirms this statement. 

The year which James has just completed on this campus can only 
be described as extremely unsatisfactory. His academic marks follow. 
It will be noted that of the twelve academic courses taken, he was 
unsuccessful in six. This fact, together with his failure in prac¬ 
tice teaching (Education 159), resulted in his being placed in 
Category IV (l).

Some of James' results on the tests and inventories taken are 
interesting. On the whole these results are fairly satisfactory. The 
Bernreuter picture is undesirable, but not more so than those of 
several of the successful students* The second score made on the 
Wellesley Spelling Test is the highest made by anyone in the group— 
49/50. The scores are shown below:

The writer observed this student at work in his rural practice 
school on two separate occasions, eight days apart. The first lesson 
was an extremely weak and unconvincing performance, but a marked 
improvement was noted on the second visit, by which time James appeared 
to have won the confidence and friendship of all members of the class. 
On this occasion the Demonstrator told the writer of an unfortunate 
and disturbing classroom experience which James had suffered earlier 
in the week. The Demonstrator was of the opinion that this incident 
had so upset James as to have appreciably altered his final practice 
teaching grade for the 'worse. 

The following is a short excerpt from the writer 1 s own report on 
his first visit to this student: 

"Mr. Johnston is apparently very sincere, but he did not 
give a convincing performance. His voice is adequate in volume, 
but betrays his nervousness. I thought also that his preparation 
left a gcP'ddeal to be desired; he seemed to be groping for words 
and ideas as he stood before the class..,"

As indicated above, James left a much more favorable impression 
on the occasion of the writer's second visit. 

Below is an excerpt from the official "Report on Practice Teach¬ 
ing" as supplied by the demonstration teacher under whom James worked: 

"Mr. Johnston's work was generally very successful. He 
developed rapidly during the two weeks. Amenable to suggestion 
and willing to learn from his mistakes, he should, with experience, 
prove effective in the classroom." (Grade "C") 

Three of James 1 professors were asked to give appraisals of this 

student, based on their contacts writh him. Their comments are as 

follows: 

Professor I: Not too much ability; sincere; conscientious. 

Professor B: Under the line in both the arithmetic and the reading 
tests; I can now (early March) see-signs of life. 

Professor D: Very gentlemanly; "good scout"; eager. 

The majority of those with whom this student has been discussed 
have described his personality as "negative", but most of them agree 
that he wears well. The writer found that one of James' greatest 
troubles was his lack of drive; for example, even when special class¬ 
room facilities (which later proved valuable to him in his work) were 
put in his way, he did not appear anxious to use them. His Bernreuter 
Personality profile, which is shown below, is not encouraging:

At no time did James express enthusiasm for the teaching profes¬ 
sion. Asked early in the tern whether he expected to make teaching 
his life work, he replied that this was possible, but that he was 
really experimenting. He had considered pharmacy seriously before 
deciding upon education. In this connection, -hkwever, it is noteworthy 
that the Lee-Thorpe profile shown below indicates small interest in 
the business field, while the ratings as to preference for personal- 
social work and the arts are relatively good. On the basis of this 
picture, James chances in pharmacy would be little better than in 
education, unless the difference were made by the factor of interest, 
which was not prominent in his work in the Faculty.

James was interested in the work with the wire recorder, and was 
always very punctual in keeping appointments* His voice showed no 
glaring deficiencies, but it did register on the wire as somewhat 
monotonous—as in the classroom also* His errors in pronunciation 
were those of the typical Canadian senior matriculant who has given 
no special attention to speech. Some examples are: 

a. Distortion of the middle consonants in certain words—e.g. 
n preddy I! instead of “pretty" and "guilay” instead of M guilty”. 

b. Abuse of the U sound in such words as "duke" and "attitude”, to 
produce "dook” and "addatood". 

c. Elision of complete syllables in such words as "valuable” and 
"squirrel”, to produce "valu 1 bul” and "squirl". 

In addition to these specific difficulties there is a constant 
hesitancy in speech which leaves the impression of uncertainty and 
lack of self-confidence*

In summary, it must be stated at once that James Johnston’s 
failure did not come as a complete surprise. Not only does his shy, 
retiring, and generally hesitant personality appear unsuited to work 
in the schoolroom, but he gave very little evidence of persistence or 
industry throughout the year. While the writer feels, after two visits, 
that this student*s practice teaching performance was probably a more 
creditable one than the final official grading would indicate, never¬ 
theless it is quite impossible to build up any sort of case for him^ 
especially in view of his lamentable academic record. 

It seems unfortunate that James was permitted to enroll in this 
Faculty at all. Equipped as he is with a better than average intel¬ 
ligence and possessed of a personality patently better suited to the 
dispensary than the classroom, it might well be that he could have 
found a place in pharmacy, where his interests appear to have been 


all the time

No. 8 The Case of Joan Sparling 

Joan's parents are retired farm people living in Southern 
Alberta. Her father, an American of British origin, completed 
Grade VIII in school; his wife, who is of English-Scottish descent, 
extended her education to the completion of one year's training as 
a nurse. Both parents enjoy good health. 

Joan, who was eighteen years of age when she entered the Facul¬ 
ty of Education, is a rather quiet girl—not to the point of nonentity, 
but still rather unobtrusive. She has always, enjoyed good health, 
apart from the usual childhood diseases. One brother and two sisters, 
all younger than Joan, are attending school. Her relationships in 
the home appear to be normal. 

Fond of reading, Joan read "between six and ten" books during the 
summer vacation of 1948, ana reads a popular class of magazine regu¬ 
larly. Other hobbies are fancy-vrork and leathercraft. 

This student began school at age six and matriculated at seven¬ 
teen, after three years in High School. Her grading on the Grade IX 
Departmental Examinations was "A". Her' "best" High School subjects 
were Trigonometry and Algebra. Her most recent High School principal 
reports that her share in the extracurricular life of the school con¬ 
sisted of participation in Dramatics, Students' Council, and the pub¬ 
lication of the school paper. He rates her high in popularity with 
fellow-students, conduct in her community, and attitude toward school, 
but just above average in social adjustment and maturity. Religion 
has always been stressed in the Sparling home, and Joan's parents are 
said by her principal to have been consistently prominent in all 
church activities and most community enterprises. Their socio-econo¬ 
mic status is rated high (l/7).

Joan* s performance in the rural school to which she was assigned 
for practice teaching was in no way outstanding* She was rather quiet 
in the classroom, but perhaps by reason of her unruffled calm she 
appeared to be doing satisfactory work on the three occasions when 
the writer visited her. She has a. pleasant manner, which seemed to 
be appreciated by the children. Below is an excerpt from the writer’s 
informal report on his second visit: 

"...Miss Sparling was teaching a formal lesson in Health 
to Grades VII and VIII. She has a pleasant voice, rather low, 
but adequate for this group. Questions were well distributed, 
and answers show interest on the part of the class. I thought 
that her directions to the class when the lesson was finished 
were not sufficiently explicit. On the whole, the lesson was 
a good one, and the student-teacher showed considerable pro¬ 
mise. 11 

The "General Estimate" from the official "Report on Practice 

Teaching" by the Demonstrator is given below: 

Grade "C". "Miss' Sparling is a willing worker and I believe in 
time will overcome her difficulties and gain more assurance."

Below are quoted the comments of three of Joan’s professors who 
consented to appraise her as to apparent ability, class participation, 
and personality traits: 

Professor A: Retiring, sincere, conscientious; not many new ideas. 

Professor H: Never vouchsafes to offer her comments to the class, but 
responds to questions; average intelligence; did a very 
good job of oral composition; good voice inflection. 

Professor B: Very nice girl; I rated her written work "very good"; 
attentive; vast improvement during the year, 

Joan’s personality profile, as developed from the Bernreuter 
Inventory, is shown below. It is not a very satisfactory one. It 
will be noted that emotional instability, dependence, and submissive¬ 
ness are all indicated. The picture does show a happy medium between 
extroversion and introversion.

Joan was one of those students most keenly interested in the 
speech work done during the term with the wire recorder. On one oc¬ 
casion, when faced with an oral assignment in English, she came on two 
separate occasions for practice. She is naturally gifted in her voice, 
which is low and very pleasant in tone; some improvement in diction 
was noted during the year. Her pronunciation was not considered good 
at the beginning of the e:xperiment, and was still far from perfect 
at the close of the term. Typical errors were: 

a. The usual substitution of "d" for "t" in the middle of certain 
words—e.g., "dodder” for "daughter", "skading" for "skating", and 
"preddy" for "pretty". 

b. Abuse of the "u" sound—e.g., "addatood" for "attitude" and "noo" 
for "new".

In addition, Joan shows a slight hesitancy in her speech, but she 
is overcoming this difficulty. 

To sum up, it may be said that Joan Sparling is a young lady of 
good appearance and considerable personal charm, quiet and unobtrusive 
in her manner, of intelligence rather lower than the average for this 
group, but mentally alert, keen and active nevertheless. It seems 
reasonably safe to predict that this student, gifted as she is with 
such desirable professional qualities as a pleasant personality, a 
pleasing voice, and a willingness to work at her chosen profession, 
should meet with good success as a teacher, particularly in the primary 
field.

No. 9 The Case of Joe Campbell 

Joe came from what is generally termed a "better class home". 

His father is a distinguished jurist in the province and his mother, 
after completing High School in Ontario, was employed as a secretary. 
Both parents are of English extraction. 

Joe began school at six and one-half years. His rating on the 
Grade IX Departmental Examinations was "A". He did not take his High 
School.training in the ordinary way, but spent a number of years in a 
private boys 1 school in the east, returning to Alberta for his final 
High School year. He obtained his High School Diploma in this province 
at the age of twenty. 

It appears that Joe had some difficulty in making this transition 
from one type of school to another; he realizes this, and his comments 
on his experiences during his late 'teens are worth including. Under 
the heading "Miscellaneous Experiences" of the General Information 
Form he says: 

"When I was at the age of sixteen years, my father took all 
restrictions off me and told me to govern myself. At boarding 

school and on holidays in ___ and on my own I was forced to 

become pretty well Independent of others at an early age. Coining 
back to the High School (Fall, 1947) I found it took two-thirds 
of the year to become adjusted to the different type of school, 
but that fact changed my whole attitude." 

Joe's background may be surmised from the following information, 
which he supplied quite readily on the General Information Form: 

Not an habitual addict of the comics, he reads "all of them ir¬ 
regularly, none regularly". He reads a superior class of magazine on 
the whole, naming the following as examples of those read regularly— 
Time , New Liberty , Outdoor Life , Sports Afield , Field and Stream .

Argosy , and Outdoor Sports Manual , During the summer vacation, 1948, 
he read ’’eleven approximately” books, Joe gives as his hobbies the 
following sports ("as my favorites and in descending order of my 
ability to play them”)—(l) Hunting (waterfowl and upland game)] 

(2) Boxing] (3) Fishing (Trolling and casting)] (4) Football. He 
also enjoys, but does not claim prpficiency in skiing, ping-pong, 
hockey and golf. He is particularly good at boxing, and was Alberta’s 
boxing representative in his weight cla-ss at the Inter-Varsity Assault- 
at-Arms. The writer witnessed Joe's win in the final eliminations, 
when he conducted himself very creditably both as to proficiency in 
boxing and good sportsmanship. 

Joe lists his High School extracurricular activities as football, 
hockey, boxing and school government. His most recent principal 
speaks well of him in all departments of the questionnaire (Form Illb) 
though he does mention Joe’s difficulty of adjustment during the 
1947-48 term. Joe’s "weak” subject is Mathematics, according to his 
own declaration, and his strongest area is that of the languages— 
English, French and Latin. 

Joe is an extremely well-mannered and courteous young man; he is 
a good listener, and was at all times considerate of the feelings of 
the other members of the group. He invariably addressed the writer 
as ’’Sir”. 

Scholastically, Joe’s record on this campus has not been all that 
might have been desired. His term and final marks are listed below; 
it will be noted that, of seven courses, his best final mark (English) 
is 70/o, and that he failed one course.

Of these scores, Joe queried the Mechanical and Manipulative 
ratings; he maintained that he had always been fond of "tinkering' 1 
with cars and other machines. 


Joe’s extracurricular interests on this campus have been confined 


to boxing, some participation in the debating club, and fraternity 
activity* 

It would probably‘be said by any casual observer that Joe’s 
personality is both pleasant and forceful, and is characterized by 
habitual good manners. It has been said he is somewhat lacking in 
self-discipline, and it is certain that during the past two years he 
has at times shown a tendency to neglect his work to a degree which 
one would not expect in a student of his intelligence and social 
maturity. He himself felt, upon seeing the extremely favorable picture 
given by the Bernreuter Personality profile, shown below, that it did 
not reflect his personality with complete accuracy. His own remark 
was "I’m just not that good."

Joe states that for the past year he has "wanted, to try teaching". 
He appeared to the writer to be sincere in his declaration that he 
wishes to engage in teaching because of the service that this profes¬ 
sion will enable him to perform. The only son of a successful lawyer, 
with two elder sisters who are both university graduates, it seemed 
natural that Joe should study law. However, according to his statement, 
he has thought very seriously on this subject and his decision to 
become a teacher is entirely his own, taken for the reason given above.

Joe showed interest at all times in the work being done with speech, 
always arriving punctually for appointments and working conscientiously 
while present. He had unusually good diction at the outset; hence 
very little improvement was noted during the term. However, a pronounced 
hesitancy in speech, noted early in the year, seemed much improved by 
the close of the experiment. The only class of error in his pronun¬ 
ciation that vrns noticed was the common one of substituting "d" for "t" 
in such combinations as "thad if” for "that if", "a lod of" for "a 
lot of", and "wanding" for "wanting". 

Three professors expressed opinions of this student, and their 
comments are: 

Professor I: This student came in not arer-impressed with Education; 

has now come to recognize the importance of the teaching 
profession. My opinion of this student has improved. 

Professor E: Pretty good stuff; good intelligence and scholarship; 
nice personality. 

Professor H: Nice boy; average ability or better. Tendency to be lazy, 
due to the influence of the group in which he moves. Com¬ 
ments, even in class, not always in good taste. A minimum 
of work, however, will- produce a second-class performance. 

In summary, it seems safe to say that Joe Campbell will probably 
develop into a good teacher; he could develop into an exceptionally 
fine one. His great drawback, as Professor H has intimated, is a 
tendency to be lazy—certainly to procrastinate. The fact remains, 
however, that he did considerable ’work this term; he did obtain credit 
in six courses, after all. He is intelligent, personable, fortunate 
in his background, and somewhat along the way has most certainly 
acquired a proper understanding of the term "professional ethics". 

He is no bookworm, but appears to- lead a very well-balanced life. He 
is aware of his own weaknesses, and has already overcome them in part. 

All in all, his prospects for success as a teacher, especially in the 
senior grades, seem good.

Mo, 10 The Case of Sheila Wingate 

Two years above the average age for the group, Sheila comes from 
a town in Central Alberta, Her parents are both living and are of 
equal age, Mr, Wingate was educated to the Junior Matriculation level, 
and is of English extraction. He served in both World Wars, ending 
his service with the rank of Sergeant-Major in the army. Mr. Wingate, 
born in Ontario of Irish stock, completed Grade IX and then spent some 
time as a clerk in a store. Her home before marriage was on a farm. 

The family religion is Homan Catholic. 

Sheila began her school career at age six, was rated "B" on the 
Grade IX Departmental Examinations, and matriculated at age twenty-one. 
Actually she spent three years only in High School, her studies having 
been interrupted by a four-year absence, after which she returned to 
obtain her Senior Matriculation. 

This student says that she has always regarded school as a means 
to an end; nevertheless, she appeared throughout the term to be very 
interested in her work in the Faculty of Education. Her favorite sub¬ 
ject is Mathematics. She has a good Intelligence Quotient, and sets 
high standards for herself; for example, she considered that a language 
mark of 70%, ’which she made here at Christmas, was a ^deficiency". 

Sheila* s most recent High School principal, who appears to be on 
familiar terms with the family, speaks highly of her both as a student 
and as a person. She places the family at the top of a seven-point 
rating scale in every department except that of socio-economic status. 
Sheila had one sister and four brothers, but the third boy was lost on 
active service with the K.C.A.F. All family and home relationships 
are reported, both by Sheila and her principal, as most congenial.

The principal has this to say: 

"Hospitality and kindness seem to be the chief character¬ 
istics of the Wingate home. It is at home that the children 
acquired and developed a spirit of helpfulness and service to 
others. 11 

In High School Sheila was extremely active in extracurricular 
affairs, especially sports. She lists uhese interests as soitoall, 
hockey, curling, and work on the Students’ Council in Grades VIi, 
VIII, and IX. 

On this campus Sheila has completed a successful year. Listed 
above are term and final marks on all courses, including practice 
teaching (Education 159):

The writer was able to observe Sheila at work in her practice 
school on two occasions. His comments in the main were very favorable 
excerpts from the informal report prepared on this students work are: 

"...Miss Wingate conducted the lessons observed in a 
brisk, cheerful manner. I am of the opinion that at this stage 
she is a very promising student teacher..• The atmosphere of the 
school was excellent; the children were not merely co-operative; 
they were eager...A good enterprise, dealing with the cultures 
of the various nationalities in Canada, is well under way. They 
have called it M The Rainbow That Does Not Fade”, the implication 
being that each race will contribute something that will give 
"color 11 to the complete "rainbow” of Canadian culture.” 


The Demonstrator was enthusiastic about Sheila’s work, and rated

her highly. The writer concurs fully in this rating, which the student 
certainly earned with a very fine performance indeed. The "General 
Estimate" and rating from the official "Report on Practice Teaching" 
reads thus: 


"This student-teacher has the ability .to get very good 
results. Her teaching manner is pleasant and business-like. 

During the lesson presentations the pupils were interested and 
industrious. Management of the classroom was very satisfactory." 

Three professors consented to appraise this student as to per¬ 
sonality, class participation, and general academic performance. 

. Their comments are as follows: 

Professor ?: Could benefit by adding more liveliness, most zest, though 
she is improving. Good results on November tests; lower 
at Christmas. 


Professor B: Doing good work; 82% in number; reading good (41/32 on 

test where 32 is a normal score for senior matriculants). 

Professor D: Very keen toward work; eager to get at the job she is 

training for. 

Sheila 1 s Bernreuter Personality profile is shown below. It will 
be noted that it presents an average, "middle-of-the-road” picture.

Sheila’s interest in teaching was high when she was last inter¬ 
viewed by the writer in March, 1949. At that time she stated that she 
liked the course and the practice teaching very much indeed. Her 
Lee-Thorpe profile seems to indicate a career devoted to teaching such 
subjects as handicrafts or the natural sciences.

This student was at all times enthusiastic about the work in speech 
being done with the wire recorder. She has a clear voice, but there 
is a puzzling, dipt quality to her speech—puzzling, because it gives 
the impression that she is of French-Canadian origin, which she is not. 
Faults in pronunciation were minor and ordinary, such as ”noo” for 
’’new”, ’’berrel" for ’’barrel”, and ”er" for ”or”. 

To sum up, it may 'be said at once that Sheila Wingate is certainly 
one of the most promising student-teachers in the group. Her persona¬ 
lity is admirably suited to the teaching profession. She is cheerful, 
pleasant, and business-like, with recurrent signs of a good sense of 
humor. She has no unpleasant mannerisms at all. Her sincerity, common

No. 11 The Case of George Dorosh 

George, who was twenty years of age in November 1948, came to 
University from a farm in Northern Alberta. His parents were both 
born in Galicia, Ukraine, and received an elementary education there. 
Both enjoy good health and are still quite young—Mrs. Dorosh parti¬ 
cularly so. They are both very fond of music. 

George started school at age seven, was given an "A” grading on 
the Grade IX Departmental examinations, and graduated with senior 
matriculation at age nineteen, after four years in High School. He 
states that he has always regarded school with enthusiasm, and that 
his favorite subjects are Mathematics and Science. He has had no 
serious illness to impede his progress thus far. 

George has a very pronounced Ukrainian accent, a fact which is 
hardly surprising, since he says that Ukrainian is spoken almost ex¬ 
clusively in his home. During the summer vacation of 1948 he read 
four books, and the Saturday Evening Post is the best magazine that 
he reads regularly. His principal rates him as high in conduct within 
the community, high in attitude towards school, and rather low (5/7) 
as to social adjustment. Extracurricular activities listed are base¬ 
ball and curling, and hobbies are stamp collecting, hunting, and read¬ 
ing newspapers. This student realizes his weakness in English naming 
it as his "worst” subject. His most recent principal rates his home 
high (1/7) as a social unit, but not quite so high (2/7) as to atmos¬ 
phere. George has one brother, eighteen, and of the two boys the 
principal says, 

"There were two brothers at school, but they v*ere different 
in character."

On this campus, George has had a rather unsatisfactory year. As 
a student in the four-year B.Ed. programme he carried seven courses; 
of these his highest mark was 71 %, and he failed two courses complete¬ 
ly. His -courses marks are shown above. 

On the tests and inventories taken, George made the following 
scores:

(It should be noted that the scores made in Vocabulary, both Fall 
and Spring, are considerably the lowest in this group. This is to 
be expected, since English is not the language spoken in the home. 
It should further be noted that there was some improvement on all 
three tests as between Fall and Spring.)

It will, be observed that insofar as it is concerned with George's 
emotional stability and freedom from worry, this picture is a very 
favorable one; it is not so favorable in the degree to which it shows 
his dependence upon others and his submissiveness. It was pointed out 
to this student that if he intends to remain in the teaching profes¬ 
sion it might be well to give some attention to the two last-named 
phases of his personality. George himself doubts the validity of the 
"dependence" rating. 

This student stated early in the term that it was his intention 
to make teaching a career. He has had no teaching this term, out has 
appeared to be interested in the courses in which he is enrolled. He 
mentions having considered Engineering as a competix-ive field,. Below 
is his Lee-Thorpe Occupational Interest profile. George queries ohe

George was not at any time enthusiastic about the work in speech 
done on the wire-recorder, though he kept his appointments fairly well 
until Christmas. During the early part of the term his performance on 
the Recorder was most inferior, but some definite improvement was noted 
by April. 

Errors in pronunciation included all the common ones, such as 
"thuh arena" for "the arena", "dodder" for "daughter", and "stoodents" 
and "sootable" for "students" and "suitable" respectively. In addi¬ 
tion to these fairly common weaknesses, this student has difficulty 
with "th", which he generally pronounces as "d" in such ?fords as "this", 
"those" and "with". He is acutely aware of this last fault, and is . 
trying to overcome it. As noted in the preceding paragraph, his 
efforts are meeting 'with some success.

At present, at the close of the first year of George’s four-year 
course, it is extremely difficult to forecast his career in Education. 
His record to date certainly has not been auspicious; the writer is 
of the opinion that this is due in part to an inadequate adjustment 
to campus life. Here is a young man who, despite his speech and social 
handicaps, his retiring nature, and an Intelligence Quotient which, 
though satisfactory, is ten points lower than the average for this 
group, is nevertheless possessed of a good deal of personal charm# It 
is quite possible that he may develop into a successful teacher of 
High School Mathematics and Science, but in order to do so he will need 
an unusual amount of persistence and industry and, in the opinion of 
the writer, special guidance and encouragement as well.

No. 12 The Case of Berthol Hamaliuk 

Berthol's (Bert) parents are both second-generation Ukrainians. 
The father is a coal-miner whose education ceased at Grade IV. Mrs. 
Hamaliuk’s pre-marital occupation was home employment on the farm. 

Her education ceased at Grade I. 

Bert began school at age 6. His rating on the Grade IX Depart¬ 
mental Examination was ”A”. He obtained his High School Diploma 
at age eighteen and lacks only one subject. Physics 2, for his Senior 
Mat riculation. 

Bert is an extremely quiet young man, but although rather shy he 

’’opens up” on certain occasions—for example, in front of a class. 

« 

He is, and has always been, a very sincere, hard-working student, des¬ 
pite the rather startling statement on the Interview Form that his 
attitude toward school has been one of dislike. His most recent 
principal rates the family rather low as a community unit—that is, as 
to community prestige, participation in community enterprises, and 
participation in Church affairs. Bert has four brothers and five 
sisters. 

The cultural atmosphere of the home, by both Bert’s testimony 
and that of his principal, is Ukrainian. Bert states that practi¬ 
cally all the reading that is done in the home is in Ukrainian, and 
the principal has this to say~ 

’’members of this family tend to ’withdraw’ from, the Anglo- 
Saxon activities of the community.” 

This tendency to withdraw appears to have carried over to some 
extent into Bert’s attitude toward extracurricular affairs, in which 
he took little part in High School. (His principal states flatly, 

”no part”, but Bert mentions hiking, sleigh riding, and dancing).

His principal rates him low both as to social adjustment and popularity 
with fellow-students. He adds, referring to Bert's academic record 
and ability: 

"A plugger. Extremely diligent. Hard worker. Several 
testings showed Berthol's I.Q. under 100. Possibly the result 
of tension—lack of confidence. In spite of this he has a good 
academic record. Jorkl 11 

Indeed, Bert’s intelligence quotient has puzzled the writer during 
the past term. On the Vocational Guidance Center, as shown later in 
this paper, he scored 98. As the months passed however, his term test 
results took second place to very few in the group, and exceeded those 
of several students whose I.Q.'s were £0 points higher. Moreover, he 
did extremely well in practice teaching. It was decided to give him 
a different intelligence test, so he was asked to complete the Wechsler- 
Bellevue, which he did, scoring 118. On a third test, the Otis 
Quick-Scoring, his I.Q. was 107. This wide divergence among the scores 
of the tests themselves, and the lack of correlation betvjeen test 
scores and examination results, do not appear to "make sense". Perhaps 
his principal has found the answer—"Workl" 

Bert's academic record on this campus has been most satisfactory. 
His course marks, both term and final, are listed below. It will be 
noticed that he was successful in all finals, and that the mark given 
him in Practice Teaching (Education 159) is a very good one.

Bert submitted to the ten tests and inventories given to all 
members of the group, and, as mentioned above, was given two addi¬ 
tional Intelligence tests. The scores on these tests and inventories 


are as follows: 


a. 

Nelson-Denny Reading 

Fall . 
Spring 

.34/72 

.. 38/72 

b. 

Nelson-Denny Vocabulary 

Fall . 
Spring 

.. . 23/100 

c. 

Wellesley Spelling Test

. 42/50 


(Again, as in the case of George Dorosh, the poverty of vocabulary 
is noticeable. It. will be noted, however, that all three repeti¬ 
tions, even that of the vocabulary test, show some improvement 
as between Fall and Spring.)

The writer was able to observe this student in the classroom on 
two occasions. During the first visit the demonstration teacher was 
still in charge, and Bert assisted by checking seatwork, accompanying 
songs and marches by chording upon the piano, etc. On the occasion of 
the second visit, Bert was in complete charge of the room, and taught 
five lessons while the writer observed him. All these lessons shov/ed 
thorough preparation and a very conscientious classroom effort on the 
part of the student-teacher. Below is a short excerpt from the 
"general Comments" section of the writer's own informal report on Bert’s 
performance: 

"Mr. Hamaliuk handled the group with apparent confidence, 
and in my opinion shows promise as a teacher. Some minor weak¬ 
nesses could be mentioned: there was a tendency to fall into 
patterns when questioning the class or discussing a point with 
them. I thought also, that I detected signs of impatience— 
almost petulance—on his part when certain exercises were not 
completed. I think time will correct these failings. He is only 
eighteen."

The "General Estimate" from the official "Report on Practice 

* 

Teaching" by the Demonstrator consisted only of the grading, which 
was "B". 

Bert's extracurricular experience on the campus was not exten¬ 
sive, consisting only of some work for the Radio Club orchestra. 

Three professors e^ressed opinions of Bert's ability, class 
participation, and general performance. Their comments are as 
follows: 

Professor B: Nice student, but shy; wrote an interesting essay on 

fear. Poor reader—made score of 28 against a Grade XII 
mean of 32. I believe that this reading ability affects 
his I.Q. 

Professor C: Good scores on music tests. Shows ability to read at 
sight. 

Professor K: Not impressive in my field; very quiet, hard worker. 

This student's personality is of a quiet submissive type; he 
is very retiring to the point of extreme bashfulness. Considerable 
progress in the ability to adjust himself socially was noted during the 
winter. Moreover, since the end of the year he has taken a country 
school, and, in a letter to the writer, appears to be "fitting in" 
very well. There is still the same proclivity for "Workl" however. 
Below is Bert's profile on the Bernreuter Personality Inventory:

Bert queried both the "Dependent" and "Submissive" ratings on 
this inventory, maintaining that he was more self-reliant and much 
more aggressive than this picture shows him to be. 

Bert is definitely interested in teaching. The reason given for 
•choosing this profession: "I enjoy working with children", speaks 
for itself. In the recent letter, mentioned above, he outlines a day 
with nine grades, which keeps him busy from 8:50 a.m. until 5:30 p.m., 
with three more hours, from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m. each day for planning; 
he then concludes with the remark, "It is a lot of work and I cer¬ 
tainly like teaching." 

Below is his Lee-'i’horpe profile. Bert queries the very low 
"Natural" rating on this picture. The extremely high Personal-Social 
rate is interesting in such a. withdrawn and bashful person.

Despite the prevalence of the Ukrainian language in his home, Bert 
shows no trace of an accent. There is a slight tendency to primness in 
his speech, though; despite this, his conversation, like his good 
firm handwriting, flows quite smoothly. His deficiencies in pronun¬ 
ciation, as revealed on the wire recorder, follow the pattern usual 
among Canadians "who have had no special speech training. Examples are: 
"assed" for "asked", '‘had on" for "hat on", ‘"squerrel" for "squirrel", 
etc. In reading early in the term he doggedly insisted upon end¬ 
stopping every line in the Shakespeare, regardless of punctuation. Some 
improvement in this regard was noticed toward the end of the term. 

Berthol Hamaliuk may be characterized as a quiet, unobtrusive 
young man of average intelligence, whose social deficiencies are more 
than outweighed by a most unusual capacity for sheer hard work. Ori¬ 
ginally handicapped by an extremely shy nature and an apparent unwilling¬ 
ness to mingle with other young folk, he now appears to be overcoming • 
this disadvantage. If one may judge by his admirable scholastic record

No. 15 The Case of Mary Andrews 

Mary has had a rather unsteady school experience, moving many 
times from place to place within this province. Her father, formerly 
a farmer, is now (November 1948) employed with an oil-drilling company 
at a country point. He is of English extraction, born in Canada; he 
served in World War II, and is now an active member of the Legion. He 
is a teetotaller; his health is described as "fair". 

Mrs. Andrews is at present teaching in a country school in Central 
Alberta. Mary has one sister and two brothers. One other sister, 

Mary 1 s twin, died in infancy. 

Mary, whose age (November 1948) is 22, began school at 5 years 
9 months. Her age at Matriculation was 20, after five years in High 
School. She attributes this advanced graduation age to the fact that 
she moved a great deal. Her Grade IX rating on the Departmental 
Examinations was "B". Her Intelligence Quotient is quite satisfactory— 
119. 

This student's health has not always been good; in addition to 
the usual childhood.complaints, she has been troubled with anemia 
and some abnormality in the Basal Metabolism rate. 

Mary describes her home as '’normal”. During the depression 
there was some financial stress; the father was absent in the army 
from 1940-45, and has since been away much of the time due to the 
nature of his -work. Mary appears to respect her father and to be very 
fond of her mother. In her account of her "Miscellaneous Experiences", 
given on the General Information Form, Mary refers to her "nomadic" 
educational experience, and lists, by name, the astounding total of 


eleven schools attended since 1945.

Mary* s extracurricular career in High School appears to have 
centred around the piano, at which she is quite proficient. She makes 
no mention of sport, but does name knitting and reading as hobbies. 

She is familiar with the better class of magazines— Ladies 1 Home 
Journal , Saturday Evening Post , Time , Harper 1 s .the Atlantic Monthly , 
and .Etude . She reads few comics, and read two books during the summer 
of 1948. 

A recent High School principal of Mary 1 s interviewed personally 
by the writer, spoke highly of this student’s ability and ’’drive", 
but said that Mary was always behind, always striving to catch up with 
the work she had missed ‘while moving. This constant change of schools 
appears to have been a most serious deterrent in this student’s school 
career. 

On this campus Mary has had what must be described as an unsatis¬ 
factory year. At Christinas time she was excluded from one of her 
courses. Music 45, because of persistent absences, and eventually she 
dropped this course without permission. She also failed three other 
courses outright, and was absent from the final examination in a 
fifth. This places her in Category IV (l). 

Her marks in all courses, for both term tests and finals, are as 
follows:

The comments of three of Mary’s professors are as follows: 

Professor E: Average intelligence; very co-operative; good partici¬ 
pation; should be able to adapt herself fairly well. 
Fairly aggressive. 

Professor F: I received rather a ’’rustic” impression, both as regards 
speech and manner. This student was out of her element 
in a certain small study group conducted by members of 
the class. Average intelligence; co-operative. Tends 
to be a little loud; was rather boisterous during her 
own oral composition. 

Professor G-: A good girl; when I invited her to my home (l), Miss 
Andrews "took over” and prepared Thanksgiving dinner. 

She has strong opinions. A hard worker. She has ideas 
of her own—often good. 

This student’s personality seems to be marked by a lack of poise 
and confidence, despite her tendency toward boisterous laughter and 
somewhat loud conversation. This was particularly marked during the 
early part of the term, but the writer was able to notice some improve¬ 
ment in this trait toward the close of the year. 

Mary’s most recent principal ignored the questionnaire and letter 
sent him, but the second-last principal under whom Mary attended High 
School granted an interview to the writer. In this interview the 
principal attributed Mary’s poor achievement in High School to her

constant moving from school to school. It appears to both the writer 
and this principal that this student is not so much unstable as unset¬ 
tled. Her principal puts it this.way, "What she needs is to get caught 
up—just once." 

Mary's Bernreuter Personality profile is shorn below. It will 
be noted that of the four personality traits indicated on this picture, 
one only—that of self-sufficiency and independence—-might be described 
as favorable in one who is to work as a teacher.

Mary has at no time told the writer that she regards teaching 
with enthusiasm. She indicated, on the Interview Form, that she has 
regarded her school experience as a means to an end. Her Lee-Thorpe 
Occupational Interest Inventory, which follows, shows strong interest 
in the Personal-Social and Natural fields, with a fairly strong bent 


for business

Mary’s voice, as revealed to her on the wire-recorder /\as more 
volume than control. In addition there is a pronounced thickness 
noticeable in her speech which sometimes makes it difficult to dis¬ 
tinguish her s’s and soft c’s from the ^sh sound. The actual tone of 
her voice is pleasant enough, except when she increases the volume of 
her speech. Her pronunciation is about average for this group, being 
characterized by such errors as the following: "ut" for ”it", 

“dodder" for “daughter", "ejicate" for “educate" and “dooks" for 
"dukes". 

Summing up, it may be said that Mary Andrews has just completed 
a year which at best must be described as "patchy" and unsatisfactory. 

She is a young lady of good intelligence, indifferent health, strong 
opinions, and remarkable industry in the field which interests her at 
the moment. Most of her troubles seem to be attributable to an unsettled 
school history, a lack of perspective and an almost complete absence 
of purpose. Without these two latter sources of motivation, it was 
inevitable that her performance should become increasingly purposeless

is difficult to entertain strong hopes for this student, either as a 
second-year student in the Faculty of Education, or as a teacher 
afterward.

No. 14 The Case of Esther Laycock 

Esther came from a farm in Central Alberta to enrol in the 
"Junior E. and I." course in the Faculty of Education. Her father 
and mother were both born in central Europe. Her father died many 
years ago, from a rare skin disease. Esther was not sure of the 
extent of his education, but estimated it at the equivalent of Grade 
IX in Alberta. 

Esther’s mother re-married some years ago; her present husband is 
of the same racial extraction as herself. There are children from 
both unions. The mother is in good health; she was educated to Senior 
Matriculation level, and her pre-marital occupation was that of book¬ 
keeper. She holds a degree in violin and also teaches piano. 

Esther walked late and talked late; she began school at age 7, 
after one year’s attendance at a school in Europe. Her health is 
generally good, and has been from childhood; for a time during the 
past spring she was troubled with a type of rash which appeared on 
her face and neck, 

Academically her record has been very good. Her ”A M rating on 
the Grade IX examinations was so high that it won her the Governor 
General’s medal for her division. She graduated with Senior Matricu¬ 
lation standing, after three years’ High School, at the age of 18. 

Her I.Q., as shown on the Vocational Guidance Center and VJechsler- 
Bellevue tests respectively, is 135 and 134. 

The writer was able to visit Esther’s home, which appears to be 
one of congeniality and culture. Esther’s step-father participates 
in local enterprises and clubs, and the mother also is a member of 
various community clubs. Esther is very fond of her mother, and 
family relation in general seems to be quite harmonious. There have

always been group games, religious exercises, reading of both prose and 
poetry, and music ("yes, indeed") in this home. Esther has one brother, 
one sister, two step-brothers, and one step-sister. Her own brother and 
sister are twins. She spent four years in Switzerland from ages 3-7. 

Esther was active in the extracurricular affairs of her High School, 
which was a very large one (24 rooms). Besides her usual hobbies, which 
include reading poetry, knitting, piano (classical music preferred), sewing 
and fishing, she was president of the Dormitory Council and a member of 
the Mess Committee. She professes to have regarded school with enthusiasm 
at all times. 

Esther’s campus record, above, though not outstanding in view of her 
superior mental capacity, is generally satisfactory.

The writer was able to visit Esther once only while she was prac¬ 
tice-teaching in the rural school to which she was assigned. The visit 
was short due to stormy weather and the difficulty of obtaining 
transportation. By the meagre standards at his disposal, however, the 
writer would place this student high in comparison with other members 
of the group. Her preparation had been thorough, her deportment was 
good, and her rapport with the students excellent. She appears to be 
a very promising student-teacher. 

An excerpt from the writer*s own informal report appears,below: 

"Miss Laycock has a very forceful manner before the class. 

I am sorry that I was unable to watch her at work in a regular 
lesson (l). It occurred to me that she might, occasionally, be 
tempted to dominate the group to a point where adequate class 
participation would be impracticable. 

Her voice is strong and normally of good tone, though there 
is a tendency, at times, to a nasal quality. She is over-col¬ 
loquial, though not seriously so. All in all Miss Laycock pro¬ 
mises to become a strong classroom personality; this might develop 
into a fault, but it is certainly not a common one." 

The "General Estimate" and rating from the official "Report on 

Practice Teaching" are given below: 

Rating "B". "Miss Laycock*s interest in the pupils and their 
difficulties will make her a successful teacher." 

Esther is interested in politics, and her extracurricular acti¬ 
vities were restricted mainly to work in this field* 

Tliis student appears to be a person of an unusually strong, 
confident, and independent personality. Her strength of character, 
decisiveness, and self-possession are apparent before five minutes of 
any interview have elapsed. Her confidence was shown in many minor 


(l) This visit was made during the weekly "silent reading" period. 
Miss Laycock read to the children and taught them a Swiss yodel¬ 
ling song.

incidents during the year. One of these occurred during the opening 
session of the campus Parliamentary Forum, which was witnessed by the 
writer. As a member for one of the parties, she happened to be the 
only woman on her side of the house. During her maiden speech she 
spoke for twelve minutes, with continuous and unruffled calm, against 
a sustained barrage of heckling from her opponents. A further example 
of the same quality is to be found in the type of school which she 
has taken during the months of May and June. It is fifty miles, by 
jeep and wagon, beyond a small town at the end of the steel in 
Northwestern Alberta. 

Esther 1 s independence is shown by her means of financing her 
year: she insists on receiving no help whatsoever, but works for her 
board in Edmonton while accepting two "scholarships”—one from her 
division and one from the Provincial Government. 

In spite or because of her forceful, almost dominant personality, 
Esther seems fairly popular. She states that she has made no really 
intimate, but many "good", friends at the University. She has a good 
sense of humor, and is a girl of considerable personal charm. 

Three professors consented to appraise the personality, mental 
capacity, and class participation of this student. Their comments 
follow: 

Professor A: Good average ability; alert, good, willing participa¬ 
tion, nothing undesirable. Not altogether charming. 

Professor F: Almost unfavorably intellectual, may'spend her life 
crusading; may succeed at the cost of some softness 
and femininity. 

Professor B: Found herself not long ago. Good classroom partici¬ 
pation, improved attitude. Very superior reader. 

Paper on "fears", in Psychology, was excellent.

During the tern this student was always interested in the work 
done with the wire recorder, and was generally punctual in keeping her 
appointments for speech practice. She speaks fluently and has an 
extensive vocabulary, but there is in her voice a recurrent tendency to 
show a hard nasal quality. She realizes this but does not seem to have 
improved her voice in this regard during , the term. Like most members 
of the group, she is very careless of certain final and middle conson¬ 
ants, especially n t n . The result is such mispronunciations as the 
following: '‘dodder" for "daughter", "liddle" for "little", "a lod of" 
for "a lot of", "header" for "better", and "beaudiful" for "beautiful". 
Other weaknesses were "yesterdee" (very persistent), "sootable", and 
“perticular". 

In summary Esther Laycock may be described as a very bright young 
woman, alert, aggressive almost to dominance, favorably inclined toward 
teaching, with few handicaps other than those inevitably present in a 
person of her strong-mindedness and unusual managerial powers. She 
is, however, keenly aware of these handicaps; she is active and self- 
appraising, though by no means introspective. 

With her originality and enterprise, her willingness to improve 
herself, and her manifestly keen mind, this student should, with a 
reasonable amount of experience and mellowing, develop into a capable 


and effective teacher

CHAPTER IV 

Conclusions and Recommendations 

In this chapter the writer proposes to mention briefly some con¬ 
clusions drawn from his work with the fourteen young people concerned 
with this study, and to make corresponding recommendations. These 
conclusions and recommendations are of course the writer’s own personal 
reactions to a situation which he watched develop during the course of 
this experiment. They are of necessity arbitrary in nature, but they 
emerged from a fairly intimate and completely sympathetic study of the 
group concerned. As such, the writer feels that they may be of some 
use to others interested in the field of teacher-training* 

1. The first conclusion is that some such work as that done with 
this group is worthwhile; and sequent to this conclusion is the recom¬ 
mendation that a programme of direct contact and personal assistance 
to freshman education students be adopted by the Faculty of Education 
as soon as possible. This recommendation is based principally upon 
the fact that the writer, having watched the students in his group 
quite closely, feels no doubt whatsoever that a number of them 'were 
definitely helped by their contacts and experience in this study. At 
the same time it is realized that it would be no easy matter to extend 
personal assistance of this kind to five hundred students. It is with 
this realization in mind that the following few suggestions are made: 
a. That the freshman population of each of the two training institu¬ 
tions (Edmonton and Calgary) be divided into groups of not more 
than twenty. These groups, which would be mixed as to sex, racial 
origin and rural-urban background, 'would each be placed for pur¬ 
poses of guidance and personal assistance under a senior student.

preferably a graduate with some training in guidance techniques. 

This student would undertake the programme of personal assistance 
as part of the term work done in one of his courses. The kind of 
assistance which he or she gave would be principally of a personal 
nature—social hints, suggestions regarding study habits, sympa¬ 
thetic criticism of practice teaching performance, advice as to 
speech defects, English deficiencies, etc. The senior student 
might also be very helpful in a capacity of liaison between student 
and Faculty. In a word, the function of the student-counsellor 
would be to assist the. freshman student in making the transition 
from High School to University. 

b. That a professor in the Faculty be placed over one or more of the 
student-counsellors for purposes of control, assistance, and general 
consultation. It is estimated that each professor would have three 
or four student-counsellors responsible to him. He would meet 

this staff of counsellors several times during the year—twice in 
the fall term and three times in the spring term seems a reasonable 
frequency—in order to receive reports on student progress, problem 
cases, etc. Each professor would also meet the whole body of 
students for whom his student-counsellors were responsible at 
least twice during the year, preferably in early October and late 
March. 

c. That specific times and places for regular interviews between 
student-counsellor and freshman be set by the professor in charge 
of the group of student-counsellors. If possible these meetings 
would take place in pleasant, congenial surroundings. The writer 
did his "work at all times in a bare classroom, where it was not 
always a simple matter to put the student at ease.

d. It is further suggested that the professors, in committee, work 
out a general programme of guidance techniques for interpretation 
by the student-counsellors. It is emphasized that such a programme 
must be general only, and subject to the widest possible inter¬ 
pretation by those using them. To draw up a-formal "curriculum" 
for this purpose would be to throttle all initiative and doom 
the plan to failure from the outset. It is felt, however, that a 
few general hints might be very useful to the student-counsellors, 
especially during the first few weeks of the work. 

£. This plan, in order to succeed, must have Faculty approval. 

The Dean or a senior member of his staff should explain the purpose of 
the work to all senior and graduate students undertaking it, pointing 
out to them at the same time the advantages which would accrue, not 
only to the freshmen, but to themselves, if the job were well done. 
Further, the student-counsellors should work from the beginning under 
the direct, well-publicized sponsorship of the Faculty, and this re¬ 
lationship should be clearly defined for the freshmen—again by a senior 
staff member—at early meetings of their respective groups. There 
ought to be no doubt about the function of these student-counsellors.. 
All persons in the Faculty, from the Dean down to the most callow 
freshman, should understand that they have official status, and are 
part of the teacher-training organization. The writer feels that in 
his own Case a more definite clarification of his function, given to 
the study group by a senior member of the Faculty early in the term, 
would have greatly increased his effectiveness. It is not suggested 
that the project be allowed to degenerate into a "parade" of freshmen to 
the student-counsellor 1 s office, but nevertheless the official smile and 
blessing of the institution is essential to the success of the under¬ 
taking.

5. It is certainly true that the present plan of observation and 
practice teaching in rural schools lias enriched our teacher training 
programme. In several cases the writer was able to see marked improve¬ 
ment in performance as between two visits, eight or ten days apart, 
to the same student. It seems regrettable, however, that there should 
be such a wide difference in ability between the various demonstration 
teachers. Some of these people were excellent, and their well-behaved, 
attentive classes gave the practicing students every reasonable chance 
to turn in a good performance* Other schools visited left much to be 
desired, both in the discipline of the classes and the ability and 
performance of the demonstration teacher. The students assigned to 
these classes were at a disadvantage, surely, when compared with those 
visiting the better-organized rooms. For an illustration of this 
inequality of opportunity we may turn again to Case No. Z , that of 
Elmer Wilson. This student was assigned to a very old, draughty 
school building which, according to one of the teachers, was scheduled 
for demolition during the present summer (1949). As a result of this 
the children were uncomfortable, a fact which may have accounted for 
their restlessness; they v/ere easily the most inadequately disciplined 
of any of the nine classes visited. The teacher, who may be an ad¬ 
mirable person in some respects, set a somewhat poor example in spel¬ 
ling, making five errors in a brief report of 34 lines ("Black Bourd", 
"classe*s”, "sincerety", M class-room M and "outways"). This teacher 
also misspelled the student*s first name. 

It is recognized that with the present teacher shortage it is very 
difficult to secure a uniformly high grade of demonstration teacher. 

It does seem unfortunate that this lack of uniformity should work a 
hardship upon those students assigned to inferior classrooms. Perhaps

a half-day’s briefing session for all demonstration teachers, given 
by a Faculty member in October and again in January, would do some¬ 
thing toward establishing a few general standards of student appraisal 
at least. 

4. The work done in this experiment has caused the writer to feel 
strongly upon at least one area which is quite outside the immediate 
field of teacher training. This is the matter of selection. Rather 
careful consideration of the members of the study group has resulted 
in the twofold conviction that: 

a. Students are sometimes admitted to the Faculty of Education who 
have absolutely no business there. 

b. Students are sometimes permitted to enrol in one pattern of training 
when they are much better fitted for work in another. 

This claim is well substantiated in at least one case considered 
in this study. This was Case No. 2, that of Elmer Wilson. This young 
man, both by his own statement and that of his most recent high school 
principal, has always been keenly interested in "mechanical contri¬ 
vances". For instance, during the summer of 1948 Elmer successfully 
installed a hot and cold water system on his father's farm. Just 
prior to this he had been able to solve a persistent ignition problem 
in the lighting plant used in his farm home, although the company expert 
had been unable to do so. (l) His I.Q. on a reputable test is 126. On 
the other hand his percentile ranks on both spelling and reading tests 
are low. Shortly after Christmas he expressed a desire to change to 
the four-year programme, the costs of which his father was able and 
willing to pay. 

(l) This information was recently supplied by Elmer’s most recent 
high school principal.

It does not seem unreasonable to suppose that this boy would have 
met with at least moderate success in the Industrial Arts or Agricul¬ 
tural pattern of the four-year programme. Certainly his self-conscious¬ 
ness and his nervous mannerisms would have been less conspicuous in 
the shop than in the classroom. As things now stand, he has failed 
completely in the Junior Elementary and Intermediate course, and is 
lost to the teaching profession. The writer believes firmly that this 
waste could have been prevented by a more careful job of selection. 

This job ought to begin in the High School. It is suggested that 
not later than completion of Grade IX, each student should be given a 
set of five reputable tests—one in each of the following areas— 
scholastic ability (intelligence), achievement, aptitude, occupational 
interest, and personality. The scores made by each student on these 
tests should be entered on his cumulative record card. Throughout his 
High School career the following information should be added to these 
test scores in each student’s file: 

a. An anecdotal picture of the student’s High School career, written 
objectively by his teachers and/or guidance officer. 

b. His complete academic record. 

c. Autobiographical material, obtained in co-operation with his 
English teachers. 

d. A subjective appraisal by his principal and/or guidance officer. 

Such an appraisal might be made twice—once upon entering the High 
School, and again upon leaving it. It need hardly be mentioned 
that if this appraisal is to be of any use it must, though subjec¬ 
tive in nature, be based upon a completely fair and unbiassed con¬ 
sideration of the student’s merits and weaknesses. 









- 119 - 


The above data would be used throughout the High School years by 
guidance personnel to direct the square pegs toward the square holes. 

By a judicious use of these data a fair amount of screening could be 
done before the students arrived at University at all. 

Presumably, by the end of the final High School year, most of those 
students planning to enter the Faculty of Education would have declared 
their intention to do so. A copy of the contents of the files of all 
such students would then be forwarded to the Faculty of Education, 
where the next step in selection would be undertaken. 

A fact which must be faced at once is that no qualified student of 
good health and character can be excluded from enrollment in the 
Faculty of Education on the basis of unfavorable scores made upon 
standardized tests. Such action would not be consonant with democra¬ 
tic procedure, and is out of the question. Nevertheless, if despite 
the screening done in High School, the student’s results upon all or 
several of the tests written indicated emphatically that he was ob¬ 
viously ill-fitted for the teaching profession or for some specific 
area within it, then these results might well be used by qualified 
counsellors to direct such students into suitable fields, either within 
the teaching profession or outside of it. In this way a good deal of 
wastage could be avoided. 

It is suggested that this part of the work of selection be done in 
the Faculty, by a person or persons qualified in guidance procedures, 
during the first week of the fall term. A certain amount of testing 
is done at present during the first week, but it is the writer’s con¬ 
tention that in the manner outlined above, this testing programme 
could be extended and made more effective.

The above four recommendations proceed directly from the writer’s 
reaction to various observations made during this study; perhaps they 
will serve to stimulate a certain amount of thought and discussion among 
those interested in teacher-training. In any case, it seems reasonable 
to assume that whatever may be the significance of the recommendations, 
the case studies upon which they are based will be of value. These 
case studies represent the results of about five and one-half months 
of rather intimate work with the group involved. It is hoped that the 
data so collected will be of some use to investigators as a quarry from 
which to take straight factual material for comparative purposes in 
any similar study conducted in the future.

Dear Mr.: 

In connection with graduate work in the Faculty of Education I am 
conducting a survey of the progress of fourteen first-year students. 

My objective is to discover whether or not a certain amount of per¬ 
sonal interest in, and personal guidance to, the freshman student in 
Education will enhance the value of the training he receives in such 
an institution as this. 

In addition to immediate guidance and assistance M on the job”, I 
wish to make a fairly thorough study of each of my fourteen students. 

A part of this study is concerned with their High School careers and 
home background, and in this connection I am asking you to complete 
the attached questionnaire. 

The student under consideration is _____ 

who attended _________while you were principal 

there during the year_____. 

Any information you submit will, of course, be regarded as con¬ 
fidential. The names of the students will at no time appear in 
any paper I may write on this subject, but case numbers only will be 
used. 

If, for any reason, you fell that you wish to omit a part of 
any of the sections, by all means do so. I shall appreciate it keenly, 
however, if you will return the questionnaire, as fully answered as 
possible, at your earliest convenience. I am. 

Yours very truly.

Speech Test rfl - Experimental Group 

1* I saw the Dukes yesterday, coining home from skating* They both had 
on a new ski suits, but neither of them had a hat on. Mrs. Duke 
had on a beautiful squirrel coat, of all things - can you imagine 
anything more incongruous at the arena? 

£. Teachers of speech always have their students say this: The rain 
in Spain, they say, falls mainly on the plains. It's very pretty 
if one says it properly. 

3. Lines from Hamlet 1-4-11 23-36 

So oft it chances in particular 

That, for some vicious mole of nature in them. 

As in their birth, —wherein they are not guilty. 

Since nature cannot choose his origin— 

By the o’ergrowth of some complexion. 

Oft breaking down the pales- and forts of reason, 

Or by some habit that too much o’erleavens 
The form of plausive manners, that these men 
Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect. 

Being nature’s livery, or fortune’s star, 

Their virtues else —be they as pure as grace. 

As infinite as man may undergo— 

Shall in the general censure take corruption 
From that particular fault. 

4. Conversation regaraing professionalism in teaching . 

Smith : Now Mr. (Miss) I wonder if you would give me your opinion 
of the teaching profession, as a profession, when compared with 
that of a doctor or a lawyer. 

Student replies ; 

Smith : Next, would you give me two reasons for the opinion which 
you have just expressed. 

Student replies ; 

Smith : Finally, will you offer two suggestions for improving the 
teaching profession in a professional way? 

Student replies ; 

5. A teacher’s voice is one of his most valuable possessions; he 
should care for it, as a good surgeon cares for his instruments. 

He should use it only at suitable times; sometimes he should not 
use it at all, I once heard a school inspector say that he liked 
to go past a classroom door now and then and "hear a nice, loud 
silence”. 

To the ladies, particularly, I should like to commend the words of 
Lear concerning his daughter Cordelia, 

’’Her voice was ever soft, gentle and low. 

An excellent thing in woman. 1 ’
