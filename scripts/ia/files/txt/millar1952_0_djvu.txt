Fifty-one strains of Bacillus subtllis , 
isolated from various materials, were studied for var¬ 
iability in antibiotic production* The isolates varied 
greatly in their antibiotic properties. Some proved to 
be inactive, but the majority were either moderately or 
strongly active towards the test bacteria used. 

When the antibacterial activities of the 
strains were compared with that of B. subtills A32, many 
of the isolates were found to be considerably less active 
while others exhibited degrees of activity equal to that 
of the A32 strain. Differences in antibiotic activity 
believed to be related to differences in the types of 
antibiotic produced were exhibited when the antibacterial 
spectra were compared with the spectrum of A32. 

High antibiotic activity was found to be closely 
associated with the lactos.e fermenting ability of the iso¬ 
lates studied. Other physiological and morphological 
characteristics were less closely associated with the 
antibiotic properties of the strains. 

Paper partition chromatography gave negative 
results when solvent systems employing water as the station¬ 
ary phase were used. Reversed phase paper chromatography, 
however, gave more promising results.

VARIABILITY OF BACILLUS SUBTILIS IN RELATION 


TO ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION 


R. L* Millar 


INTRODUCTION 


Antibiotics have been derived from fungi, act- 
inomycetes and bacteria. Not only different species of 
each, but even strains of a single species have been shown 
to differ in the oroduction of antibiotics. The variaole 
nature of this property may be evidenced in the amount of 
a particular antibiotic produced or in the type or types 
of antibiotic produced. 

Among the fungi exhibiting this property are 
species of Penicillium. These have been shown to vary 
greatly in their ability to produce the antibiotic penic¬ 
illin. Winsten and Spark (1) have shown that Penicillium 
chrysogenum Thom Q -176 may produce as many as eight diff¬ 
erent penicillin types. 

Streptomyces griseus (Krainsky) comb , nov. is 
representative of the actinomycetes, which have yielded a 
number of antibiotics possessing different biological and 
chemical properties. Schatz et al (2) was the first to 


report the production of the substance, streptomycin, by thi

(5) have since been obtained as additional products from 
it. 

Bacillus polymyxa (Prazmowski) Migula and 
Bacillus s u btills Cohn emend Prazmowski are bacteria 
which are exceptionally good sources of antibiotic sub¬ 
stances. Porter et al . (6), reported that there appeared 
to be important differences among 65 isolates of B. poly ¬ 
myxa In respect to their antibiotic production. Varying 
degrees of effectiveness of the isolates were demonstrated 
against the test organism used. Several substances have 
been isolated from B. polymyxa which are very closely re¬ 
lated chemically and practically indistinguishable biol¬ 
ogically. The name polymyxin has been given to these 
substances as a group, and the individual compounds have 
been distinguished by the letters A, B, C, and D. 

Bacillus subtilis has yielded a greater number 
of antibiotic entities than has any other bacterium. 

Marked variability in the chemical nature of these has 
been clearly shown. The first to be described was sub- 
tilin, a polypeptide isolated by Jansen and HIrschmann (7)* 
This was found to occur within the cells of the organism. 
Bacitracin (8), another antibiotic produced by 33. subtil is, 
differs from subtilin by accumulating In the culture liquor, 
free from the cells. A third agent of B . subtilis , bacillin, 
has been described by Foster and Woodruff (9)* Still other 
products of this organism are subtilysine (10), endosubt-

PREVIOUS STUDIES ON THE ANTIBIOTIC PROPERTIES OF 
BACILLUS SUBTILIS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA 


The strain of Bacillus subtilis , referred to here 
as A32, was isolated by Jackson (17) and later identified 
by Dr® N. R. Smith of the United States Department of Agri¬ 
culture® On the basis of its non-phytotoxicity and its 
antagonism to Xanthomonas translucens f, sp . hordei-avenae 
(S® J. and R®) Dowson emend Hagb®, the A32 strain was 
selected by J® J® Goodman (18) for detailed study® 

Goodman’s investigation dealt firstly, with the 
isolation and purification of an antibiotic from this organ¬ 
ism and with factors affecting its production and secondly, 
with the use of this antibiotic in the control of the 
bacterial pathogen Xanthomonas translucens which causes 
Bacterial Blight of barley® 

Further studies on the purification of the active 
substance produced by A32 were made in co-operation with the 
Chemistry Department of the University. Gordon (19), under 
the supervision of Dr® R® B® Sandin developed a method by

which the antibiotic could be obtained in a partially 
purified form* 

In the investigations reported here, A32 has been 
used as a standard to which the antibiotic properties of a 
number of other strains of B» subtilis have been compared* 

OBJECTS OP THE INVESTIGATION 


The main objects of the investigations reported 
here were as follows: 

1* To determine if the strain of Bacillus subtilis 
referred to as A32 can be commonly Isolated from 
various local sources and in particular from 
seed and soil. 

2* To study the ability of local strains of Bacill us 
subtilis to produce antibiotically active material 
and to determine if the strains which produce 
appreciable amounts differ from the A32 strain in 
either the quantity or in the type of antibiotic 
produced. 

3. To determine if the ability of strains of Bacillu s 
subtilis to produce antibiotically active material 
is associated with any physiological or morphol¬ 
ogical characteristic of the strain.

SOURCES OF THE ISOLATES 


Introduction 


Bacillus subtilis , one of the spore-forming 
"bacteria, is widely distributed in nature and has been 
isolated from a number of sources. Soil and decomposing 
organic matter have been reported (20) as natural habitats 
of this organism. However, plant vegetation and the air 
have proved to be other fruitful sources. 

The subtenolin-producing strain was obtained by 
Hirschorn et al . (15) from aga.r plates that had been seeded 
with Escherichia coli (Migula) Castellani and Chalmers and 
Staphylococcus aureus Rosenbach, respectively, and inocul¬ 
ated with material from dusty surfaces in the laboratory. 
Similarly, Johnson and Burdon (14) isolated the strain which 
yields eumycin by exposing agar plates to contamination with 
dust. Johnson et al . (8) isolated the bacitracin strain 
from cultures of contaminated tissue removed at operation 
from a compound fracture of the tibia. A strain, isolated 
from a contaminated culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
var . hominis (Schroeter) Lehmann and Neumann was found by 
Newton (13) to produce bacilipin A, bacilipin B and bacil- 
ysin. The strain which yields bacillin (9) and the A32 
strain were obtained as isolates from soil. 

In the present investigations a number of mater-

ials were tested for the presence of Bacillus subtills. 


Fifteen samples of wheat seed and fourteen samples of 
soil obtained from quite widely separated localities in 
Alberta were tested particul&rly for the presence of those 
organisms exhibiting a likeness in growth characteristics 
to those of the A32 strain* Materials tested for the pres¬ 
ence of this and other strains of B* subtilis were seed 
(wheat, oats, barley, peas, lupine, sugar-beet, sunflower), 
wheat flour, ground pea material, oat glumes and air* 

Isolation of B. subtilis from Different Sources 


Isolation from wheat seed following hot-water treatment 

During the investigations on the isolation of 
B* subtilis from various materials, wheat seed which had 
been hot-water treated was tested as a potential source* 
Eight isolates resembling the A32 strain in their growth 
characteristics were obtained* This suggested that the A32 
strain might be a common contaminant of hot-water treated 
seed* To test this possibility, the following method was 
employed* As reported here, the method represents a mod¬ 
ification of the hot-water method developed as a control 
for the disease Loose Smut of wheat* 

The seed used consisted of samples of wheat ob¬ 
tained from fifteen locations in northern Alberta. Dupli¬ 
cate lots of seed from each of the samples were tested in 
two plates, each containing seven or eight seeds*

Small glass cylinders containing 5 ml. of dis¬ 
tilled water were bunged and sterilized. Lots of seeds 
of each of the various samples were added to a number of 
the glass cylinders and sterile, perforated glass-beads 
were added, as checks, to the remainder. 

The seeds were allowed to soak for 4 hours at a 
temperature of 1$° - 20°C. At the end of this pre-soak 
period, the cylinders containing the seeds were transferred 
to a hot-water bath (49°C) for 1 minute. Following this 
pre-heating period they were transferred to a second bath 
where they were kept for 10 minutes at a temperature of 51° 

- 53°C. The cylinders were then placed in cold water to 
cool their contents. 

The seeds and the bead-checks were transferred 
fromthe cylinders to potato-dextrose agar plates in an 
inoculation chamber which was washed down prior to the 
treatment with 1:1000 mercuric chloride soliition and then 
irradiated with ultra-violet light for 1 hour. One-ml. of 
the water suspension remaining in the cylinders, following 
removal of the seeds and the bead checks, was mixed with 
about l£ mlo of potato-dextrose agar in a Petri plate. 

The agar was cooled to about L[6°C before it was mixed with 
the water suspensions. As soon as the agar had hardened 
all of the plates were placed in a 30°C incubator. 

None of the organisms that appeared in the plates 
containing the seeds resembled A32 in their growth charact¬ 
eristics when they were grown on potato-dextrose agar slants.

A similar result was obtained from those plates prepared 
from the water suspensions# No growth was apparent in any 
of the check plates# 

These results indicate that the A32 strain does 
not commonly occur as a contaminant of hot-water treated 
seed* The eight isolates previously mentioned, were obtain¬ 
ed from seeds which had been treated without adequate control 
being taken against contamination from the air, or from 
equipment used in the test# The fact that such isolates 
were not obtained when the test was properly controlled 
against contamination indicates the necessity of suitable 
precautions being taken whenever investigations of this 
nature are performed# 

Isolation from the Soil 

The A32 strain, as reported by Goodman (18), was 
isolated from Edmonton black soil# In order to determine 
the prevalence of this strain in soil, samples of soil from 
widely separated localities were collected and subsequently 
tested by the following methods# 

Each sample was thoroughly mixed within the sample 
tube with a sterile needle# The needle was then flamed, 
cooled by wetting with 0*85 percent sodium chloride solution 
and plunged into the soil sample. The soil particles which 
adhered to the needle when it was withdrawn were transferred 
to 10 ml# of sterile saline solution# This process was 
repeated with each soil sample to give duplicate stock 
suspensions#

The stock suspensions were treated as follows: 

(a) The suspensions were left standing for one hour 
and then shaken for 1-2 minutes to free the bac¬ 
teria from the soil particles; 

(b) . Following the above procedure the suspensions 

were pasteurized (80°C for 10 minutes), cooled 
in running tap water, and kept overnight. 

The pasteurized and the non-pasteurized stock 
suspensions were then tested by the following methods for 
the presence of the A 32 strain: 

(a) One loopful of each suspension was transferred 
to sterile potato slices and incubated at 4o°G 
for 48 hours; 

(b) One-ml* lots of the suspensions were transferred 
to 10 ml* lots of asparagine broth and incubated 
at 30°C for 4 days* Following the incubation 
period, streak plates of each broth culture were 
prepared on potato-dextrose agar after which the 
plates were incubated until definite growth had 
been made; 

(c) One-ml* lots of the suspensions were serially 
diluted to 1:1000 dilutions. Each of the stock 
suspensions and the 1:1000 dilutions were then 
plated and incubated at 30°0 for 5 days. 

To detect contaminants from sources other than 
those under test the following checks were included: 

(a) Sterilized samples of Edmonton black soil; 

(b) Sterilized samples of soil to which had been

added one loopful of a suspension of A32; 

(c) Suspensions of A32 alone* 

The checks were treated in exactly the same man¬ 
ner as the collected soil samples with duplicate preparations 
made in each case* 

Aside from the checks the test yielded only one 
colony of an organism whose growth characteristics on 
potato-dextrose agar resembled those of A32. This isolate 
was obtained from a 1:1,000 dilution plate of a non-pasteur- 
ized soil suspension* Except for this single isolate, the 
presence of the A32 strain in the soil was demonstrable only 
in the sterilized samples to which it had been added* A32 
was also recovered from those plates and potato slices pre¬ 
pared from the A32 suspensions* 

The results obtained by this test were in agreement 
with a previous one, not reported here, which failed to yield 
organisms similar to A32 when Edmonton black soil was inves¬ 
tigated as a potential source. The fact that only one 
isolate was obtained in the test described above suggests 
that this organism was a contaminant from the air* 

Additional evidence in support of these findings 
was obtained in further studies. In these, suspensions of 
A32 in dilutions of 1:1,000,000 and 1:100,000,000 were added 
to test-tubes containing approximately 10 ml* of (a) sterile 
and (b) non-sterile Edmonton soil* Tubes of soil to which 

sterile distilled water was added served as checks* All of 

o 

the tubes were incubated at 30 C for a period of up to two 
weeks. Each of the soil preparations was tested for the

presence of A32 after intervals of time of ij.8 hours, 1 week, 
and 2 weeks had elapsed. This was done in two ways: 

(a) By the transfer of soil particles to agar plates; 

(b) By preparing agar dilution plates from pasteur¬ 
ized and non-pasteurized suspensions of the various 
soil preparations* 

At no time during the period of the test were 
organisms of the A 32 type recovered from tubes which init¬ 
ially contained non-sterile soil. Similarly A32 was not 
obtained from sterile soil to wnich sterile distilled water 
had been added. Colonies of the A32 type did appear, however, 
in plates to which soil particles were transferred from the 
preparations consisting of sterilized soil and the added A32 
suspension. They were also produced on agar dilution plates 
prepared from this soil preparation. The nature of the 
bacterial growth which appeared in plates prepared from the 
non-sterile soil, preparations was very variable but consis¬ 
ted largely of organisms with a smooth type of growth. 

This was in direct contrast to the type, of growth exhibited 
by the A32 strain which has been described (18) as being 
distinctly rough. 

Discussion 

The growth of A32 on potato-dextrose agar may be 
described as flat, dull, opaque, and having a rough ground- 
glass-like topography (18). As organisms resembling A32 in 
their growth type were not isolated from either pasteurized 
or non-pasteurized soil, it is concluded that bacteria of

the A32 type do not commonly occur In the soil examined# 

Bacillu s subtlli s occurs as strains whose growth 
is either rough or smooth in appearance. That A32 could 
not be recovered from non-sterile soil, to which it had 
been added, suggests that there may be associated with 
such soil, some factor or factors which can effect a change 
in the growth type of this organism. The preponderance of 
bacterial colonies from the non-sterile soil whose growth 
was smooth in appearance might be considered as additional 
evidence in support of this hypothesis. Furthermore, antag¬ 
onism to A32 by organisms already present in the soil may 
have had the effect of killing, or at least inhibiting, 
further growth of cells of this strain# 

I solation from o ther mater ials 

The following method was used to test for the 
presence of strains of B# subtllis as contaminants of var¬ 
ious kinds of seed. 

Seeds were transferred from sterile Petri plates 
to a 70 percent ethanol solution where they remained for 1-2 
minutes. They were then rinsed in sterile distilled water 
and transferred to potato-dextrose agar plates containing 
about 20 ml# of agar. The forceps used in making the trans¬ 
fers were flamed between steps# These operations were 
performed in an inoculating chamber which had been prev¬ 
iously washed down with 1:1000 mercuric chloride solution 
and exposed to ultra-violet irradiation for 1 hour. Ster¬ 
ilized glass beads, which had received the same treatment

as the seeds, served as checks. All plates were incubated 
at 30°C and were examined daily for the presence of bacter¬ 
ial growth. Only bacterial growth occurring on or immed¬ 
iately around the seeds was transferred to slants for further 
observation. 

Wheat flour, ground pea straw and oat glumes were 
tested by sprinkling small quantities of them on the surface 
of agar in plates from a sterile camel T s hair brush. 

Air-borne isolates were obtained by exposing agar 
plates to contamination from the air at various locations 
outside of the laboratory and within the greenhouses. 

All of the isolates from these sources were sub¬ 
jected to pasteurization (80°C for 10 minutes) as a 
preliminary means of selection since B. subtilis is a 
spore-former and therefore is resistant to this treatment. 

A list of the isolates, which were later tentatively iden¬ 
tified as strains of B . subtilis , the methods used for their 
isolation and the sources from which they were isolated is 
given in Table I. 

Discussion 

A total of 5*4 strains of B. subtll is were obtained 
from the various materials tested. Of this number, 8 were 
isolated as contaminants of hot-water treated seed as prev¬ 
iously reported. Subsequent tests, however, indicated that 
these isolates were from sources other than the hot-water 
treated seed. The single soil isolate, obtained from a 
suspension of non-pasteurized soil, on initial transfer to

potato-dextrose agar resembled the A32 strain in its 
growth characteristics* However, on subsequent transfers 
distinct differences were apparent. These results, under 
the conditions of the tests, give strong support to the 
conclusion that the A 32 strain does not commonly occur in 
the soil nor as a contaminant of hot-water treated seed* 

Of the remaining isolates, 8 resembled A32 in 
their growth characteristics* However, only 3 of these 
were from seed (oat and pea). One was isolated from ground 
oat glumes, one from pea straw and the other 3 isolates 
were obtained by exposure of agar plates to contamination 
from the air* Since one-half of the isolates resembling 
A32 resulted from contamination of plates during the iso¬ 
lation work it is concluded that the A 32 strain is not com¬ 
monly present on or in the various materials tested. This 
appears to be particularly true of seed and soil. 


IDENTIFICATION OF THE ISOLATES 


Introduction 

Strains of Bacillus subtilis exhibit marked vari¬ 
ations in growth types* Whether the growth is flat, warty, 
folded, adherent or nonadherent, dry moist, smooth or 
mucoid depends on the stage of growth (20). The extreme 
variability exhibited by this organism in its growth char¬ 
acteristics, which might be easily confused with those of 
other species of the genus, made it apparent that a class-

ification of the Isolates as to species was necessary. 

The difficulties involved in classifying B. s u b - 
till s are reflected in the literature on the subject. The 
most recent and complete review on the subject has been 
given by Smith, Gordon and Clark (20). Since there is no 
universally accepted classification for this organism, all 
workers reporting on the production of antibiotics by strains 
of this organism may not have used the same species of 
aerobic spore-forming bacillus (13)* 

Gibson and Topping (21) and Gibson (22) have 
presented one method of classification for 6. sttbti lis. 

However, in the work reported here the method of classif- 

r 

ication given by Smith and co-workers (20) has been used 
for the identification of the isolates. 

Methods and Media 

The methods used and the media employed were the 
same as those described by Smith et al . (20) with two ex¬ 
ceptions. The following criteria were iised in the ident¬ 
ification of the isolates: 

(a) Pasteurization (80°C for 10 minutes); 

(b) Gram*s Stain, vegetative cell size and spore size; 

(c) Growth on nutrient agar, glucose-nitrate agar and 
potato-dextrose agar slants; 

(d) Growth on potato - potato slices were prepared 
as described by Fred et_jfL. (23); 

(e) Fermentation of carbohydrates (xylose, dextrose, 
maltose, galactose, lactose and sucrose);

(f) Reduction of nitrates to nitrites - the method 
recommended in The Manual of Pure Culture Study 
(24) was used in place of the method outlined 
by Smith et al . (20); 

(g) Voges-Proskauer reaction; 

(h) Starch hydrolysis; 

(i) Gelatin hydrolysis* 

Each of the tests was duplicated for each isolate 
and in those instances where doubtful results were obtained 
the tests were repeated* The A32 strain was included with 
the isolates in all of the tests performed* 

On the basis of the identification tests 54 isolates 
were tentatively identified as strains of B* subtilis * All 
of these strains are within the limits specified for veget¬ 
ative cell size and spore size* They are gram-positive and 
survive pasteurization. They reduce nitrates to nitrites, 
react positively to the Voges-Proskauer test, and hydrolyze 
starch and gelatin. Acid without gas is produced by all of 
the isolates from xylose, dextrose, maltose and sucrose. 

Acid production from galactose and lactose, however,varies 
with the strain. Pigment production on potato-dextrose 
agar varies from creamy-white, to orange, to yellow, to pink. 
A description of the type of growth on potato-dextrose agar 
slants (Table II) and on potato slices (Table III) is 
presented*

COMPARATIVE STUDIES ON THE PRODUCTION OF 
ANTIBIOTICS BY STRAINS OF B. SU3TILIS 


SPOT-INOCULATION TESTS 


Introduction 


The ability of an organism to produce an anti¬ 
biotic may be tested by a number of methods. One which is 
commonly used is the streak method. Robbins and co-workers 
(25) used this procedure to test 300 species in 42 genera 
of the Basidiomycetes for their antibacterial activities. 
Agar plates which had been seeded with a bacterium were 
inoculated by streaking inoculum of the fungus across the 
agar surface. Resultant inhibition of growth of the test 
bacterium was taken as evidence of the antibacterial pro¬ 
perty of the fungus under test. Waksman et al . (26) tested 
the antibacterial properties of a large number of actino- 
mycetes by this method.

was essentially similar to that used in the streak method* * 

Test plates were prepared by seeding nutrient- 
dextrose agar*** with 1 ml. of a suspension of a bacterial 
test organism. The suspensions were kept relatively constant 
by adding a standard loopful of bacteria from a culture of 
the test organism to 10 ml. of sterile distilled water. One- 
half ml. of the resulting suspension was added to each pla/fce. 
To the one-half ml. suspensions were added approximately 15 
ml. of melted cooled agar. After the agar was added to the 
plates they were swirled around to distribute the test or¬ 
ganism uniformly throughout the agar and then set aside to 
harden. When the agar had hardened the plates were spot- 
inoculated, A loopful of bacteria from a culture of each of 
the isolates was transferred to the centre of individual test 
plates. The plates were then incubated at 30°Co Examination 
of the plates for antibacterial activity was made when growth 
of the test organism was clearly visible in the plates. 

In the first test employing the spot-inoculation 
method, three strains of a bacterial plant pathogen, Xantho- 
monas translucens , were used as test organisms. These were 
Xanthomonas translucens f. sp . cerealis Hagborg (1015)> 
Xanthomonas translucens f. sp . undulosa (S. J. and R.) 

Hagborg (1018), and Xanthomonas translucens f. sp . cerealis 
(Hagborg). Each of the 48 isolates tested was spot-inocu¬ 
lated on individual test plates seeded with one of the three 
test organisms. The A32 strain was included as a standard. 


*Nutrient-dextrose agar: Bacto beef-extract 3 gm., bacto pro¬ 

teose-peptone 5 gm., dextrose 20 gm., distilled water 1000 ml.

Discussion 

It will be seen from the table that considerable 
variability in antibacterial activity by the B. subtilis 
isolates is evidenced against the Xanthomonas strains. The 
variability demonstrated was fairly uniform against each of 
the test organisms. This is hardly an unexpected result 
since the test bacteria are strains of a single bacterial 
species. This property suggests that the physiological 
processes of each test organism are very similar. Conseq¬ 
uently the antibacterial activity exhibited by many of the 
isolates against one of the pathogens is probably effected 
through a similar mode of action against the others. This 
hypothesis is supported by the fact that each of the isolates 
showed almost the same degree of activity against each of 
the pathogens. 

Those strains whose growth type was smooth in 
appearance were generally either not active or only weakly 
antagonistic under the conditions of the test. Four of these, 
however, produced from the edges of the bacterial colonies, 
fan-like outgrowths which differed from the central portions 
of the colonies in presenting a rough type of growth. Wher¬ 
ever these rough sectors occurred in the plates moderate to 
marked antagonism of the bacterial test organisms was also 
apparent. It is believed that the change in growth type may 
result either from an accumulation of metabolic by-products 
in the medium or possibly from a decrease in the amount of 
surface moisture present in the plate. 


The character of roughness in growth type was

associated in each case with those isolates giving the 
greatest activity against the Xanthomonas strains. How¬ 
ever, not all of the rough appearing isolates are active 
to the same extent. 

Antagonism of B, subtilis Isolates 
to Other Test Bacteria 


Robbins and co-workers have reported (25) that 
of the Basidiomycetes which they studied the slow-growing 
ones appeared to be the most active antagonists. This 
question of a possible relation between the rapidity of 
growth and production of antibiotics was given attention 
in the present investigations. 

Method 

The spot-inoculation method was used in studies 
designed to determine if the antibacterial activity is 
related to growth rate in B. subtilis . Plates seeded with 
the test organism were prepared as described above. The 
test bacteria employed in this test have been designated 
X - 190, X- 191 and X - 192" e The B. subtilis isolates 
were tested against each of the test organisms as follows. 

A standard loopful of bacteria from a culture of an isolate 
was spotted in four places on the agar surface of each test 
plate. All spots received approximately the same amount of 
inoculum. Following their inoculation the plates were in-

cubated at 30°C until growth of the test organisms was 
visible. 

It was apparent, on examination of the plates, 
that a number of the isolates tested were antagonistic to 
one or more of the test bacteria. This antibacterial act¬ 
ivity was evidenced as halos, or clear areas free of growth 
of the test organism, surrounding the colonies of the active 
isolates. The size of the inhibition zone in relation to 
the size of the B. subtilis colony producing it, was taken 
as a measure of the antibacterial activity exhibited by an 
isolate against a particular test organism. The results 
are summarized in Table V.

The results show that 54 percent of the Isolates 
tested produced degrees of inhibition greater than 5 ram. 
against X-190 whereas only 29 and 31 percent of the isolates 
showed a corresponding amount of inhibition against X-191 
and X-192 respectively* These findings cannot be attributed 
entirely to X-190 being a more sensitive test organism than 
either X-191 or X-192* The possibility that nutrient agar is 
a more favorable medium for the production of antibiotic 
materials by the isolates must also be considered. 

The degree of inhibition exhibited by the A32 
strain was fairly uniform against each of the test organisms. 
Three of the isolates however, differed from A32 in the nat¬ 
ure of their antibacterial spectra.

In Table VI it is quite apparent that the anti¬ 
bacterial spectra of the isolates V9> V33 and V34 differ 
sharply from that exhibited by the A32 strain. These 
results suggest that the types of antibiotics produced by 
these isolates may differ slightly from the active material 
produced by A32* However, when the media employed In the 
test are considered, a different explanation is suggested* 

The low level of activity exhibited by the isolates when 
they were tested on the potato-dextrose agar medium indicates 
that there may be present in this medium some factor which 
limits the amount of active materials produced by the isolates* 

The character of the Inhibition was found to vary 
with the isolates. The most pronounced type of inhibition was 
that in which the B* subtilis colonies were surrounded by a 
sharply-defined clear zone, indicating complete inhibition of 
the test bacteria* Other isolates produced zones of Inhibit¬ 
ion which were limited by zones of stimulation. Both these 
types have been described (25) by Robbins et al * In some 
instances, zones of stimulation were apparent which extended 
beyond that limiting the clear area surrounding the B* subtilis 
colonies. In these plates the stimulation zones appeared as 
concentric rings* 

The property of antibiotic production was not found 
to be very closely associated with those Isolates which grew 
rapidly* Generally the more active isolates were also the 
slower growing forms* Quite often an isolate which had made 
more growth in one plate than another demonstrated greater

antibacterial activity in the plates containing the lesser 
amount of growth. 

Under the conditions of the tests, considerable 
variability was shown by the isolates in their ability to 
produce antibiotically active material. Of those strains 
capable of exhibiting antibacterial activity, only a few 
were slightly more active than the A32 strain. However, 
this relationship varied with the medium and the test 
organism used. The fact that almost one-half of the is¬ 
olates produced antibiotically active material is an 
indication of the active role Bacillus s ubtilis may play 
in natural antagonisms. 

STUDIES ON THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF 
BROTH FILTRATES OF B. SUBTILIS ISOLATES 


Introduction 


•While the spot-inoculation method is a useful 
procedure for demonstrating the antagonistic properties 
of a number of isolates, it has certain limitations. The 
most important of these was experienced in attempts to 
compare the antibiotic activities of two or more isolates 
having different grov/th rates. To overcome this difficulty, 
the Isolates were grown in a liquid medium and the resulting 
broth cultures were passed through bacterial filters. The 
bacteria-free filtrates were then tested for antibiotic

activity against several test* bacteria* 

The antibacterial spectrum of an antibiotic is 
a record of the degree of activity which it exhibits against 
a number of test organisms. In addition, such a spectrum 
is often sufficient to identify the antibiotic* 

The following studies, employing culture fil¬ 
trates of the isolates were undertaken for two purposes* 
These were to determine if # the isolates differed in their 
ability to produce: 

(1) different quantities of a particular antibiotic 
and (2) different antibiotic compounds* 

The filtrates were consequently tested with these purposes 
In mind by the paper-disc agar-diffusion method of assay* 

Paper-Disc Agar-Diffusion Method of Assay 


Vincent and Vincent (27) were the first to sugges 
the paper-disc agar-plate method* It has been widely used 
in testing culture filtrates of bacteria, actinomycetes, 
and fungi for antibiotic activity*. The method as used in 
studies on polymyxin has been described by Stansly and 
Schlosser (28) 0 On analyzing their results statistically, 
they obtained an error of ^ 15 > to 20 percent* 

The following procedure, hereafter referred to a s 
the paper-disc agar-diffusion method, was employed to test 
the activity of culture filtrates of B. subtllis Isolates*

Highly absorbent paper discs (Schliecher and Sehuell No. 
740 -S) measuring 12.7 mm. in diameter were sterilized in 
the autoclave and allowed to dry before being used* Test 
plates were prepared, as previously described. When the 
agar had sufficiently hardened the discs were placed on 
the agar surface. A pair of forceps was used to dip the 
discs into the filtrates to be tested. Excess solution 
was allowed to drain from a disc by touching it lightly to 
the inner surface of the flask containing the filtrate. 

The disc was then transferred to a test plate. Four discs 
were similarly prepared for each filtrate, but only two of 
these were transferred to a plate. Duplicate plates, there 
fore, of each test organism were prepared for each filtrate 
The forceps were flamed between the application of each 
disc and the cover of the test plate was raised just high 
enough to allow the disc to be inserted. The plates were 
then incubated at 30°C until growth of the test organism 
was clearly visible* Zones of inhibition as evidenced by 
halos surrounding the discs were taken as indications of a 
filtrate’s antibiotic activity. The widths of the halos 
were measured to the nearest *5 mm* 

Filtration Through Berkefeld Filters 


One-hundred ml. lots of .03 percent asparagine 
medium (18) were dispensed into 500 ml. Erlenmeyer flasks 
and sterilized for 15 minutes at 1 $ - 17 lb. pressure.

One ml. of a suspension of an isolate was added to each of 
three flasks. The suspensions were prepared by adding a 
standard loopful of bacteria from a culture of an isolate 
to 10 mlo of sterile distilled water. After the bacteria 
were added, the flasks were incubated at 30°C for 4 days. 
The broth cultures of each isolate were then bulked and 
passed through a Berkefeld filter into sterile receiving 
flasks. Two sizes of filters (No. 1 and 3) were used. 

The filtrates of 9 isolates and that of the A32 strain 
were tested by the paper-disc agar-diffusion method for 
activity against each of the bacteria shown in Table VII. 
The filtrates were tested against certain of the test or¬ 
ganisms on both nutrient agar and potato-dextrose agar. 

Results 

As shown in Table VII, the levels of activity 
exhibited by V3, V8, V10 and Vll are considerably higher 
than those shown by A32, V2, V4, V7 and V9 for the same 
test organisms. It will also be noted that the antibacter¬ 
ial spectra of the former differ quite markedly from the 
spectra of the latter. Since the isolates do not corres¬ 
pond in the pattern of their antibiotic activity towards 
the various test organisms, the results suggest that the 
antibiotics produced by V3, VS, V10 and Vll are probably 
different antibiotic compounds. 

The spectrum of the V2 isolate is very similar 
to the spectrum of A32 when the antibacterial activities

exhibited by these strains are compared. Two marked diff¬ 
erences, however, are evidenced when the activities shown 
towards X -192 and X-191 grown on nutrient agar medium are 
examined. In these instances, the antibiotic activity ex¬ 
hibited by the V2 culture filtrate is 5 times that shown 
by A32. These differences suggest that the active material 
produced by V2 is also somewhat different in type from that 
produced by the A 32 strain. 

The degree of activity shown by each of the fil¬ 
trates was influenced greatly by the medium employed. This 
was apparent when the filtrates were tested against three 
test organisms on both nutrient agar and potato-dextrose 
agar media. In many instances, the degree of activity ex¬ 
hibited by the filtrates on nutrient agar was much less than 
on potato-dextrose agar. 

When the activities of the filtrates are consid¬ 
ered on the basis of the amount of antibiotic present marked 
variability is apparent. Figure 1 and Figure 2. Two of the 
filtrates contained very little antibiotic whereas the others 
apparently contained varying amounts^ It is not possible, 
however, to attribute these results to differences in the 
ability of the Isolates to prodiice different amounts of a 
particular antibiotic. In subsequent studies, employing the 
Berkefeld filters, it was discovered that the filters adsorbed, 
or inactivated, appreciable amounts of active material. This 
was made apparent when filtrates, which had become contaminated, 
were refiltered to remove the contaminant. Filtrates possess¬ 
ing certain levels of activity when tested following a second

filtration were found to be completely inactive* As two 


different sizes of filters were employed in the test, 
varying amounts of active material may have been removed* 
Goodman (18) has shown that Nuchar, an activated 
charcoal, alumina and soil effectively adsorb the anti¬ 
biotic material produced by the A32 strain. Other sub¬ 
stances tested reduced the antibiotic activity of broth 
cultures to varying degrees. The diatomaceous earth, of 
which Berkefeld filters are composed, was found in the 
present studies to be another material which readily ad¬ 
sorbs J132 antibiotic. 

Filtration Through Seitz Filters 


The Seitz bacterial filter, the filtering part 
of which consists essentially of a filter-paper pad, was 
also used to measure the degree of activity produced by 
B. subtilis isolates in a broth medium. Flasks containing 
.03 percent asparagine medium were inoculated with suspen¬ 
sions of the isolates and incubated at 30°C for 4 days. 

Three flasks, each containing 100 ml. of medium were pre¬ 
pared for each isolate. Following the incubation period, 
the cultures of each isolate were bulked and passed through 
a Seitz filter. The filtrates were then tested for activity 
against various test organisms. The values shown in Table 
VIII represent the average inhibition exhibited by B. subtilis 
isolates towards each of the test bacteria. Four measurements.

one for each of four discs, were obtained by measuring the 
widths of the halos surrounding the discs. In Table IX the 
results are expressed as ratios which are obtained by comp¬ 
aring the average inhibition shown by each isolate towards 
a particular test organism to that exhibited by the A32 
strain against the same test organism.* 

Further studies employing broth filtrates differred 
from the foregoing test not only in the isolates which were 
tested but also in the quantities of culture liquid which were 
filtered. Smaller quantities of medium were employed in order 
to shorten the time required for filtration. Results of these 
studies are presented in Table X and in Table XI. In one test 
(Table X), 200 ml. of broth culture of the isolates were filt¬ 
ered and tested for antibiotic activity. In another (Table XI) 
only 100 ml, of culture liquid were filtered. 

Discussion 


The variability in antibiotic production exhibited 
by the isolates, as shown in Table VIII and Table IX, may 
result not only from the amount of antibiotic produced but 
also from the type or types of antibiotic produced. Some 
of the isolates appear to produce the same type of antibiotic 
as that which is produced by the A32 strain. This is apparent 
when the antibacterial spectra of V3, Vip and V7 are examined, 
since the degree of activity shown by the isolates is almost 
the same as that shown by A32, towards the same test organisms.

On this basis, a significatn difference in the degree of 
activity shown by V3, V4 and V7 probably represents, under 
the conditions of the test, a difference only in the amount 
of a particular antibiotic produced.* 

The isolates V2 and V10, however, exhibit degrees 
of activity which are markedly different from that of A32 against 
the various test bacteria* In these instances the differences 
which are significant may be best explained on the basis 
that V2 and V10 produce antibiotics which are different in 
type to the active material produced by A32. 

The fact that the filtrate of V9 was completely 
inactive towards almost all of the test organisms suggests 
that this isolate does not produce antibiotics active against 
the test organisms used* However, results presented in a 
subsequent section of the text indicate that the Seitz filter 
adsorbs all of the active material produced by this isolate* 

This would occur if either the quantity of antibiotic prod¬ 
uced were limited or if the antibiotic type compound were more 
readily adsorbed by the filter than those of other isolates* 

The antibiotic activity shown by V8 and V12 toward 
certain of the test organisms is significantly different from 
that of the A32 strain. The differences, however, are not 
so marked as those which are apparent on comparing V2 and V10 
with A32. Although the pattern shown by V8 and V12 suggests 
that the differences are related to a difference in the type 
of antibiotic produced, a comparison of these results with 
those of other tests is necessary to support this hypothesis*

It will be noted, in Table X, that the degree of 
antibacterial activity exhibited by VI3 contrasts markedly 
with that shown by A32 against certain of the test bacteria* 
In three instances, VI3 was almost 5 times more active than 
A32 against the same test organisms* These large difference 
in antibiotic activity against some of the test organisms 
and the almost equal degrees of activity shown toward others 
suggests that there is a chemical difference in the type of 
antibiotic produced by these strains* Vll and Vli|, however, 
under the conditions of the test, appear to be very similar 
to A32 in the nature of their antibiotic activity* 

From the results presented in Table XI, additional 
evidence of variability in antibiotic production by the is¬ 
olates is shown. The isolates Vl6, V20 and V2f> apparently 
possess antibacterial spectra which differ from that of the 
A32 strain* These differences in the antibacterial spectra 
suggest that the isolates Vl6, V20 and V25> also produce an¬ 
tibiotics somewhat different in type to the active material 
produced by A32# The antibiotic activity exhibited by V28, 
however, is similar to that shown by A 32 towards the test 
bacteria; the active material produced by these strains is 
therefore probably of the same type* 

When the three tables of results. Table VIII, 

Table X and Table XI, are compared on the basis of the de¬ 
grees of activity exhibited by the A32 strain in each test, 
a marked reduction in antibiotic activity is apparent* This 
reduction is associated with the smaller quantities of cul¬ 
ture liquid which were employed. From these results and the

results presented in a subsequent section of the text, it 
is quite evident that appreciable amounts of antibiotic 
material are removed by the Seitz filter when culture 
liquids are passed through it. Relatively larger amounts 
of active material are removed when small quantities of 
culture liquid are filtered than when larger volumes are 
filtered* 


STUDIES ON THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY OF 
BROTH CULTURES OF B.'SUBTILIS ISOLATES 


Penicylinder-cup Method of Assay 


Broth cultures which had not undergone any treat¬ 
ment likely to modify antibiotic material present in them 
were tested by the penicylinder-cup method of assay* 

Test plates were prepared by adding 15-mi* of 
melted, cooled agar to Petri plates containing a one-half 
ml* suspension of a test organism. The plates were swirled 
to distribute the test organism uniformly throughout the- 
agar medium. When the agar had sufficiently hardened sterile 
penicylinder-cups were transferred with a pair of forceps to 
each plate. The so-called cups are small cylinders, measur¬ 
ing 8*5 iMa in diameter, whieh are open at both ends. The 
tapered end of a cup was placed on the agar surface and by 
gentle pressure it was pressed into the agar* Two plates.

each plate containing two cups, were used for each isolate 
tested* 

The isolates were grown in 0*03 percent asparagine 
medium for Ij. days at a temperature of 30°C o Samples of the 
culture liquids were pipetted into the cups from 1-ml. pip¬ 
ettes* Only enough medium was added to the cups to just 
fill them. The plates were then kept at 5°C for approxim¬ 
ately 6 hours after which time they were incubated at 30°C 
until growth of the test organism was clearly visible* 

The period in which the plates were kept at 5°© 
provided an interval in which growth of the test organism 
was at a minimum. This afforded a longer period for diffu¬ 
sion of the active material through the agar and resulted 
in larger zones of inhibition* 

In a preliminary trial 50 isolates were tested 
for antibiotic activity against three test organisms, X-190, 
X-191 and B* polymyxa * The degrees of inhibition shown by 
the isolates towards X-190 are given In Table XII. Those is¬ 
olates which were either inactive or only weakly active 
against X-190 showed a similar result when tested against 
X-191 and B* polymyxa * Several of the Isolates, however, 
when tested against X-191 and B* polymyxa , exhibited apprec¬ 
iable degrees of activity. These isolates were re-examined 
for their antibiotic properties using the pen!cylinder-cup 
method. Results of this test are given in Table XIII*

Discussion 


The results shorn in Table XII compare very 
closely with the results obtained when the isolates were 
tested for antibiotic activity by the spot-inoculation 
method (Table V). The broth culture studies show that, of 
the 50 isolates tested, 26 of them or 52 percent produce 
appreciable amounts of antibiotic material as evidenced by 
degrees of inhibition of X-190 measuring more than 20 ram* 
When the isolates were tested against this organism in the 
spot-inoculation tests, 54 percent of those tested showed 
what are considered to be comparable degrees of activity* 
Under the conditions of the broth culture test 
l4 isolates showed no antibacterial activity towards X-190* 
Six isolates were weakly active, producing inhibition zones 
of l6 mm* or less. In 4 instances, the inhibition zones 
were quite large. However, some growth of the test organism 
was apparent within the zones. This type of inhibition is 
described as diffuse since the test organism*s growth was 
not completely inhibited within the inhibition zone* 

When the more active isolates are compared on 
the basis of their antibacterial activity against three test 
organisms (Table XIII), variability in antibiotic production 
is again evidenced. The degrees of activity shown by the 
isolates towards X-190 agree quite closely with the activity 
shown by them in the preliminary test (Table XII). The gen¬ 
erally lower values observed for most of the isolates are

probably a result of the shorter period in which the plates 
were kept at 5°C. In the preliminary test the plates were 
held for 9 hours at 5°C, whereas, on the second test the 
plates were at the lower temperature for only 6 hours* Two 
of the isolates, V26 and V38, were much less active when 
tested the second time. As shown in Table XIII, they are 
only very weakly active against the test bacteria employed. 
Subsequent tests showed a similar result which indicates 
that the antibiotic properties of these organisms have been 
modified. This indicates that the antibiotic properties of 
these isolates are not very stable. Artificial culture of 

v 

the isolates may have caused the loss of the property for 
antibiotic production* 

The test plates of X-191 and B. poly my xa were 
kept for 9 hours at 5°C. By comparing the antibacterial 
activities of the isolates against these two test organisms, 
differences are observed which indicate that the types of 
antibiotic material produced by a few of the isolates prob¬ 
ably differs from the active material produced by A32. 

Pour of the isolates V9* V10, V30 and vlj.8 show a marked 
reduction in the degrees of activity.shown towards B. polymyxa 
from that shown towards X-191* This behavior is decidedly 
different from that of A 32 which is highly antagonistic to 
both of these test organisms. This implies that there is a 
chemical difference between the types of antibiotic formed 
by each of the four isolates and that produced by the A 32 


strain.

COMPARATIVE STUDIES ON THE ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITIES 
OP BROTH CULTURES AND BROTH FILTRATES 


Comparison of Berkefeld Culture Filtrates with 
Seitz Culture Filtrates 


The following procedure was employed to det¬ 
ermine the relative amounts of adsorption of antibiotic 
material from broth cultures of A32 by Berkefeld and Seitz 
bacterial filters. One-hundred ml. of asparagine broth 
medium were added to 500 ml. Erlenmeyer flasks. The flasks 
were then sterilized in the autoclave for 15 minutes. Two 
kinds of inocula, pasteurized and non-pasteurized were used 
in the test. These were included to determine the effect 
of such inocula on antibiotic production by A32. Suspensions 
of inoculum were prepared by transferring loopfuls of bacteria 
from a culture of A32 to test-tubes of sterile 0.85 percent 
saline solution. One loopful of bacteria was added to each y 
of three test-tubes containing 10 ml. of saline solution. 

One of the tubes was then placed in a water-bath where it 
was kept for 10 minutes at a temperature of 80°C® This 
treatment, commonly known as pasteurization, has the effect 
of killing the vegetative cells of bacteria. It does not, 
however. Inactivate the spores of those bacteria capable of 
forming them. Following the heat treatment of one of the 
suspensions^ one ml. of the pasteurized suspension and a 
like quantity of the non-pasteurized suspension was added

to individual flasks containing asparagine medium. A total 
of three flasks for each treatment were prepared. A single 
flask containing broth medium, to which 1-ml. of saline 
solution had been added, served as a check. All of the flasks 
were incubated at 30°C for 4 bays. Following the incubation 
period, the contents of two flasks of each treatment were 
bulked. One-half of the resulting culture liquid was passed 
through a Berkefeld filter. The remainder was filtered 
through a Seitz filter. Culture filtrates were then tested 
by the paper-disc agar-diffusion method of assay. The re¬ 
sults are given in Table XIV. Neither of the check prepa¬ 
rations exhibited antibacterial activity against the test 
organism used in the test.

Discussion 


It is clearly evident that the Berkefeld filter 
removes considerable amounts of antibiotic material from 
broth cultures of A32. It is further evident that this 
property of the filter assumes added importance when or¬ 
ganisms are compared on the basis of the amount of antib¬ 
iotic they produce* Those organisms which produce antib¬ 
iotic material that is readily adsorbed by the filter would 
be considered less active than others whose antibiotic is 
not adsorbed to the same extent* 

The results also show that there was no effect 
on the amount of antibiotic produced by cultures of A32 when 
two kinds of inocula namely pasteurized and non-pasteurized 
were employed* 

Removal of Antibiotic Material from B* subtilis 
Broth Cultures by Seitz Filters 


In a preliminary test, broth cultures of B* sub ¬ 
til is isolates were filtered through Seitz bacterial filters* 
The culture filtrates and the non-filtered broth cultures 
were then tested for antibiotic activity by the paper-disc 
agar-diffusion method* Cultures of the isolates were pre¬ 
pared by adding one-ml* suspensions of each of the isolates 
to individual flasks of asparagine broth* Two flasks were 
prepared for each isolate and all of the flasks were incub-

the broth cultures of each isolate were bulked and one-half 
of the resulting culture liquid ?/as filtered through a Seitz 
filter. Both the filtered and non-filtered culture liquids 
of each isolate'were then tested for antibiotic activity. 

The test organism employed in the test was X-190. Two plates, 
each plate containing 2 discs, were used to test each culture 
liquid. In those test plates containing discs which had been 
dipped in the non-filtered lots of broth, growth of the iso¬ 
late was apparent from some of the discs. Other discs were 
sufficiently free of growth, however, to permit readings of 
the amount of adsorption ?\hich was evidenced. The results 
are presented in Table XV.

Discussion 


It will be seen from the table that the Seitz 
filter removes appreciable amounts of antibiotic material 
from broth cultures of B. subtilis isolates® In those 
instances where growth from the disc was very extensive, 
it is not possible to relate the reduction in activity 
to adsorption by the filter. A part of the activity 
evidenced when the broth cultures were tested may have 
resulted from antibiotic that was produced during the 
period in which the plates were incubated. However, if 
the results for the Isolates A32, V3> VI0 and vlfj are 
examined, it is quite evident that the filter was res¬ 
ponsible for a loss of antibiotic material from culture 
liquors of these isolates. 

Adsorption of A32 Antibiotic by Seitz Filters 


In the studies employing broth culture filtrates, 
it was noted that Seitz filters appeared to remove relat¬ 
ively greater amounts of antibiotic material from small 
volumes of broth cultures than from larger volumes. The 
following procedure was used to determine the amount of 
antibiotic material removed by the filter when successive 
5>0-ml. lots of broth were filtered. Flasks of asparagine 
medium were inoculated with 1-ml. suspensions of B. subtilis

Following the incubation period the contents of three 
of the flasks were bulked to give 300 -ml. of culture 
liquid. This volume of liquid was then passed through 
a Seitz filter in 5 > 0 -ml. lots with each lot of filtrate 
caught in a separate receiving flask. The container of 
the filter was allowed to empty completely before an 
additional lot of culture liquid was added to it. "When 
all of the lots of broth had been filtered they were 
tested for antibiotic activity by the penicylinaer-cup 
method of assay. Culture liquid which had not been 
filtered was also tested.

Discussion 


It will be seen from the table that a relatively 
greater amount of antibiotic material is removed from the 
first 50-mi# of culture liquid than from successive 50-ml. 
lots. After the first 100-mi. of liquid have passed through 
the filter, the amount of antibiotic removed becomes almost 
constant when more liquid is filtered. One possible explan¬ 
ation of these results Is that broth cultures of A32 may 
contain more than one antibiotic. When the first 50-ml. 
lot of liquor is filtered, the filter removes both types 
of antibiotic material from the culture liquid. On the 
filtration of further quantities of liquor, the filter 
becomes saturated with respect to one component but not 
the other. Filtration of additional lots of medium, there¬ 
fore, effects a removal of antibiotic material of only one 
type. Such an effect might be evidenced if the two com¬ 
ponents were present in different proportions. 

Comparison of the Antibacterial Activities of Broth 
Cultures and Broth Filtrates 


Benedict and Stodola (29) have reported that

the culture filtrates suggests that differenced in anti¬ 
bacterial activity may have resulted from differences in 
the amounts of antibiotic adsorbed® When broth cultures 
of the isolates were tested, the degrees of antibacterial 
activity exhibited by many of the isolates were quite un¬ 
iform. If similar amounts of antibiotic were removed by 
the filters from broth cultures of the isolates, the deg¬ 
rees of antibacterial activity of the filtrates should 
show the same uniformity. This would be particularly true 
if the active materials produced by the isolates were the 
same. The following procedure was used to test this 
hypothesis. 

One-hundred ml. of asparagine broth medium were 
dispensed into 500-ml. Er.lenmeyer flasks. The flasks were 
sterilized in the autoclave, allowed to cool, and then in¬ 
oculated with 1-mi* suspensions of the isolates. Two flasks 
were prepared for each isolate. Following an incubation 
period of 4 days at 30°C, the contents of replicate flasks 
of each isolate were bulked® The bulked lots of culture 
liquid were then tested for antibacterial activity against 
X-191o A total of 25 strains, including the A32 strain, 
were tested by the penicylinder-cup method for antibiotic 
activity. Following the addition of samples of the culture 
liquor to the cups, the plates were kept at 5>°C for 6 hours. 
They were then transferred to a 30°C incubator where they 
remained for l6 hours® The degrees of activity of the diff¬ 
erent isolates are shown in Table XVII® The figures shown 
represent averages of !i readings for each isolate; the meas-

urements were made to the nearest 0.5 mm. 

After the culture liquids were tested, as des¬ 
cribed above, they were passed through Seitz bacterial 
filters. As only two filters having equal capacities were 
available, the culture liquors of the isolates were kept 
at 2°G until siich time as they could be filtered. Poliow¬ 
ing individual filtrations, the filter-pads, whose iden¬ 
tities were maintained, were removed to sterile Petri 
plates. The filters were thoroughly washed, rinsed in 
distilled water and sterilized prior to each filtration. 
Following the filtration of a culture liquor, the filtrate 
was transferred to the low temperature. When all of the 
culture liquids had been filtered, they were tested by 
the procedure used in testing the broth cultures. The 
periods at which the plates were kept at 5°C and 30^0 
were also 6 and 16 hours respectively. The degrees of 
activity exhibited by broth filtrates of the isolates 
are also given in Table XVII. A simple analysis of var¬ 
iance was made for each set of results* The least sig¬ 
nificant differences (L.S.D.) obtained are included in 
the table. 


Discussion 


The loss in activity exhibited by A32 on fil¬ 
tering culture liquor through a Seitz filter (Table XVII) 
is comparable to that which was lost In a previous test

(Table XVI) when the same volume of liquid was filtered* 

As shown in Table XVII, the amount of active material re¬ 
moved from the A32 culture liquid as compared to the am¬ 
ounts removed from broth cultures of many of the isolates 
is relatively small (Figure 3). Marked variability in 
the degrees of antibacterial activity evidenced on testing 
the culture filtrates is apparent* The relative degrees 
of activity exhibited by the broth cultures, however, are 
much more uniform* 

Eight isolates differ from the A32 strain by a 
significant amount when the degrees of activity exhibited 
by the broth cultures are compared* Twenty of the 24 
isolates tested show a significant difference when the 
degrees of activity exhibited by broth filtrates are com¬ 
pared* The lack of uniformity in the relative degrees of 
activity shown by the filtrates suggests that the active 
materials produced by many of the isolates are antibiotic 
compounds which differ in type from that produced by A32* 

Standard errors inherent in the penicylinder-cup 
method of assay varying from i 4 percent to ^ 30 percent, 
depending on the number of replicates used and the degree to 
chich the techniques employed were standardized, have 
been reported (30)* Pure antibiotic preparations of known 
concentrations were included whenever broth cultures were 
tested for antibiotic activity. As pure A32 antibiotic was 
not available for comparison, in the studies reported here, 
the method of assay employed is not strictly analagous 
to those which have been reported. For this reason, only those

isolates which showed marked differences from the A 32

biotic produced# B* subtilis strains which evidenced 
such a difference are V3 (Figure 3) , V12, Vll|> Vl6, V20, 
V25, V30 and v48. 

Because only 100-ml. of broth culture of the 
VI4 isolate were filtered, results shown for this isolate 
are not comparable to those given for the A32 strain* The 
quantity of Vll culture filtrate which was tested, however, 
was the same as the quantity tested of VI4* Since the 
degree of antibacterial activity of the broth filtrate 
of Vl4 is much less than that of Vll, these isolates also 
appear to differ in the types of antibiotic compound which 
they produce* 

Antibacterial Activity Evidenced on Testing

The individual filter-pads through which the 
culture liquids of the B* subtilis isolates had been fil¬

the pad, removed from the under-side, were placed on the 
surface of agar test plates* Two such pieces of an air- 
dried pad were transferred to test plates of X-190. The 
plates were incubated overnight and measurements for an¬ 
tibiotic activity were made the next day* The diameter 
of inhibition zones which were apparent around many of the

Discussion 


Although the areas of the bits of paper which 
were transferred to the plates were not constant, the In- 
hibition zones developed within individual test plates 
were qiiite uniform in size. The largest difference app¬ 
arent between diameters of two zones within a single plate 
was 8 mm, the average difference exhibited for any one 
plate was 2 mm. 

It will be apparent from the results given in 
Table XVIII that the antibiotic produced by many of the 
isolates is not permanently adsorbed by the filter pad. 

In a few instances, though active material was removed 
from the culture liquid by the filter, no inhibition of 
the test organism was evidenced on testing the filter-pad. 
This suggests that the active material is either perman¬ 
ently adsorbed or Inactivated by the filter. 

On comparing the results shown for Vll and Vll]., 
it is evident that the antibiotic material produced by Vll 
is considerably more active than that of the Vl4 isolate. 

In the foregoing test, an apparently greater amount of 
active material was removed from the broth ciilture of VI4 
than from the culture liquor of Vll, The amount of active 
material 'released by the filter-pad was considerably less 
than would be expected on the basis of the relative amounts 
adsorbed. This is additional evidence In support of the 
hypothesis that the active materials of Vll and Vl4 are

different antibiotic compounds# 

The degree of activity evidenced by V12 active 
material, on testing the filter-pad, is much less than that 
exhibited for A32. Although more antibiotic was removed 
from the culture liquid of V12, considerably less is shown 
in the filter-pad test plates# These results suggest that 
there is a difference in the antibiotic type compounds 
produced by these strains# 

EXTRACTION STUDIES OP THE ANTIBIOTIC 
MATERIAL PRODUCED BY B* SUBTILIS ISOLATES 


Extraction Procedure 


One hundred ml* of #03 percent asparagine 
medium were dispensed into f?00-ml# Erlenmeyer flasks# The 
flasks were then sterilized in an autoclave for 1$ minutes# 
Suspensions of B * subtilis isolates, using a loopful of 
bacteria of each isolate in 10 ml* of sterile distilled 
water, were prepared* One ml. of a suspension was added 
to each of V~> flasks. The flasks were then incubated at 
30°C for Ij. days* Following the incubation period, the 
broth cultures were bulked giving a total of 15>00 ml# of 
broth culture for each isolate* 

The culture liquids were then extracted 3 times 
with n-butanol# Enough butanol was added for each extraction

to form a layer after the mixtures were shaken. A volume 
of butanol equal to 15 percent of the total volume of culture 
liquid extracted was used for the three extractions« Follow¬ 
ing the third extraction the mixtures were saturated with 
sodium chloride and were then warmed slightly* This had the 
effect of causing most of the residual butanol to separate 
out# The method differs slightly from that employed by 
Goodman (18)• One modification consisted in not removing 
the bacterial growth from the culture liquid* This was not 
done for two reasons* Firstly, previous studies had shown 
that both the Berkefeld and the Seitz bacterial filters re¬ 
moved varying amounts of antibiotic from the cultures* Sec¬ 
ondly, the subjection of the bacterial cells to extraction 
with a solvent might remove antibiotic material which was 
held within the cells* Another difference consisted in not 
extracting the culture liquid with petroleum-ether prior to 
the butanol extraction* 

The broth layers following the butanol extraction 
were tested for antibiotic activity by the paper-disc agar- 
diffusion method* Only traces of activity were found to be 
present* 

The butanol extracts were treated, in part, acc¬ 
ording to the method described by Gordon (19) for purification 
of the antibiotic of B* subtills A32. The butanol extract, 
together with an added equal volume of water, was distilled 
in vacuo until all the butanol was removed* The distillation 
temperature was about 25°C* The resulting water suspension 
was shaken three times with chloroform* Five-ml* of chloro-

form were used for each extraction. The mixture formed on 
the addition of the chloroform, when left overnight, separ¬ 
ated into layers. The water layer from the third chloroform 
extraction was centrifuged at approximately 4500 r.p.m. for 
30 minutes. This effectively reduced the number of bacterial 
cells held in suspension and resulted in more accurate read¬ 
ings when the water layer was tested for antibiotic activity, 
as it was immediately following centrifugation. 

Only those isolates that produced appreciable 
amounts of antibiotic, as determined by the penicylinder-cup 
test, were tested by the above procedure. None of these, how¬ 
ever, showed any activity when the water layers following a 
chloroform extraction were tested. 

Discussion 


The procedure described above is apparently a sat¬ 
isfactory one for the extraction and partial purification of 
antibiotic material produced by the B. subtilis isolates studied. 
Since only traces of activity were apparent when the water lay¬ 
ers were tested, it would appear that the active material of 
each isolate has certain similar properties. 

Tests Employing Chloroform Extracts 


Chloroform extracts of the isolates were tested by 
the paper-disc agar-diffusion method against several test or-

Discussion 


The activities of the chloroform extracts show 
considerable variation in the degree of inhibition they ex¬ 
hibit against the test bacteria (Figure 4) • It will be 
noted from an examination of Table XIX that the antibacter¬ 
ial spectra of V10, Vl 6 and V3£ are different from the spectra 
of A32 and V3« This is most evident when the degrees of in¬ 
hibition towards X-193* B> polymyxa and X-194- are compared 
with the activity shown towards X-191• The inhibition evi¬ 
denced against X-191 by all of the extracts is uniformly high*

However, the degree of activity shown towards the other test 
organisms varies from marked inhibition by the A32 and V3 
extracts, to only slight inhibition by V10 and V35> and mod¬ 
erate inhibition by Vl6. These results are further evidence 
that different isolates may produce different antibiotic 
type compounds. 

A consideration of the results presented in Table XX 
sh'dws that the differences in the antibacterial spectra of 
the isolates tested are not very great. On the basis of this 
test therefore, it would appear that the antibiotics produced 
by the isolates Vllj, Vl?> V39* and v!|9 are very similar 

to that pro duced by the A 32 strain. 

Considerable difficulty was experienced when fur¬ 
ther tests employing chloroform extracts other than those 
recorded in Tables XIX and XX were performed. Not only the 
chloroform extracts but also chloroform check preparations 
showed considerable variation. This variation was evidenced 
In repeated trials and also between replicate discs within 
a particular test. It was assumed that the variation was 
possibly due to the use of different batches of chloroform. 

The presence of a toxic factor in one of them could account 
for the Inconsistency of the r esuits. However, definite 
proof in support of this assumption was not obtained.

Tests Employing Ethanol Solution 


Chloroform extracts of B» subtilis isolates 
were evaporated to dryness under vacuum* The resulting 
solids were bro?/n in color and in some of them crystalline 
structure was apparent* The addition of 30 ml* of 95 per¬ 
cent ethanol brought only a part of the solid material into 
solution. White-colored residues remained which were sepa¬ 
rated from the amber-colored solutions by filtration through 
Whatman #1 filter paper* Following this treatment the ethanol 
solutions were transferred to a 5°C refrigerator in which 
they were stored until all of the chloroform extracts had 
undergone the procedure described above. The periods the 
solutions were held at the low temperature prior to testing 
them for activity varied from 2 days to 3 weeks* The peni- 
cylinder-cup method of assay was employed in testing the 
solutions for antibiotic activity* The white residues and 
the filter papers used in filtering the solutions were tested 
by transferring small amounts of each to agar plates seeded 
with a test organism. X -190 was employed as the test bacter¬ 
ium. Three plates, each containing two cups, were used in 
testing the solution of each isolate. The figures presented 
in Table XXI are averages of six readings made for each 
isolate tested* None of the white residues or the filter 
papers tested showed any activity.

Discussion 


At the time the extraction s tudies were initiated, 
no satisfactory method was available for testing the anti¬ 
biotic activity of broth cultures prior to chemical extrac¬ 
tion. Consequently only by comparing the activities of the 
isolates as shown in the broth culture studies (Table XII 
and Table XIII) with the activities exhibited by the ethanol 
solutions (Table XXI) is it possible to determine the effect 
of the various chemical treatments on the antibiotic material

produced by the isolates. 

The degree of antibiotic activity shown by each 
of the isolates V2, V14, V17, V39, V41 and V49 is appar¬ 
ently only slightly modified by the extraction procedure. 
Antibiotic material produced by V17 and V40 was apparently 
very much affected by the chemical treatments employed. It 
will be noted, however, that a flocculent precipitate was 
present in the ethanol solutions of V26 and V40 when the 
test was performed. Precipitation also occurred in the 
ethanol solutions of V2, V14, V19 and V39 following an 
interval of about 2 weeks. During this period and for 
about 2 weeks prior to the test, the solutions were kept 
at a temperature of 5 G C. Following the transfer of the 
flasks from the low temperature to room temperature, only 
one flask, after approximately 24 hours at the higher temp¬ 
erature, had a precipitate remaining in it. When the sol¬ 
utions were subsequently tested for activity against X-190, 
X191 and B. polymyxa there was considerable variability 
evidenced in replicate test plates of some of the solutions# 
Solutions of A32, V2 and V29 exhibited degrees of antibiotic 
activity which were fairly uniform between replicate plates 
in a particular test. However, reduction In activity was 
evidenced when further tests were performed. These results 
suggest, that under the conditions of the test, the antib¬ 
iotic materials of the isolates tested were modified in some 
way in the presence of the ethanol. As the ethanol solutions 
were not all prepared at one time, the antibiotics of each 
of the isolates may have been at different stages of inact-

ivation when the tests were performed* It is not possible, 
therefore, to relate the differences in antibiotic activity 
shown in Table XXI to differences in properties of the 
antibiotics entirely* 

The degree of activity shown by the V29 isolate 
is this study is very much different from the activity shown 
by it in the spot-inoculation and broth culture studies* 

This result suggests that there is active material contained 
in the cells of this isolate which is released during the 
extraction procedure* Jansen and Herschmann (7) have found 
that subtilin is obtained as an antibiotic product of the 
interior of the cells of a strain of B* subtilis * The 
active material is removed from the cells by a chemical 
extraction procedure* 

ASSOCIATION OP CULTURAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL 
CHARACTERISTICS WITH THE ANTIBIOTIC 
PROPERTIES OP B* SUBTILIS 


The association of a cultural or physiological 
characteristic with the ability of an organism to produce 
antibiotics would greatly facilitate the discovery of new 
antibiotic-producing strains* With this in mind, the follow¬ 
ing characters of the B* subtilis isolates were studied in 
relation to the ability of the isolates to produce anti¬ 
biotic material*

Growth Type 


Growth of the isolates on potato-dextrose agar 
slants showed considerable variation in type. When com¬ 
pared in relation to their ability to produce antibiotic 
material in broth culture, the most active strains were 
found to have a rough type of growth (Table XXII). Not 
all of the rough strains, however, were antibiotically 
active. Isolates whose growth was smooth were either 
only weakly active or inactive. 

Color of the Isolates 


The isolates were grown on potato-dextrose agar 
slants and on potato slices. Following their incubation at 
30°C the cultures were examined for the production of pig¬ 
ments. While both of the media supported pigment formation, 
the potato slices gave slightly more intense colors than the 
potato-dextrose agar slants. The isolates were compared on 
the basis of color in relation to antibiotic activity 
(Table XXII). Cultures exhibiting a pink coloration are 
either only weakly active or not active in the production 
of antibiotic material. The most active isolates are those 
whose cream color is similar to that of the A32 strain. 

Other strains, however, exhibiting this color are among 
those isolates which produce no active material when grown 
in broth culture. Two strains which are orange in color

produce appreciable amounts of antibiotic* Four yellow 
strains have been very variable throughout the investi¬ 
gations in their ability to produce antibiotically active 
material. The property of producing active material which 
they possessed during the earlier studies appears to have 
been lost. Such behavior has also been reported for strains 
of Penicillium chrysogenum (31)• 

Reaction to Alcoholic Ferric Chloride 


Jansen and Hirschmann (7) found B. subtilis 
isolates possessing a high subtilin activity to give an 
intense blue color, and those with little subtilin acti¬ 
vity no color, on the addition of a few drops of a one 
percent alcoholic solution of ferric chloride to £ ml* of 
broth culture. In the studies reported here, none of the 
isolates gave a blue color with ferric chloride which 
suggests that none of the strains tested, under the con¬ 
ditions of the test, produces subtilin. Some of the cul¬ 
tures, hov/ever, as a result of the treatment showed a. 
layering effect with the material in the top layer having 
a coagulated appearance. This characteristic was found to 
be closely associated with weak antibiotic activity.

Carbohydrate Fermentation 


In the identification studies, the isolates were 
tested for their ability to utilize a number of sugars. 

The sugars employed in the tests were xylose maltose, 
galactose, lactose, dextrose and sucrose. Some of the 
isolates were found to be incapable of utilizing galactose 
and lactose. However, all of the isolates fermented xylose, 
maltose, dextrose and sucrose. An ammoniacal-nitrogen 
medium was used for the fermentation studies. It was made 
up as follows: 

Ammoniacal-nitrogen medium 

NHf^PO^ - 1 gm. 

KC1 - 0.2 gm. 

MgSOj^ - 0.2 gm. 

Agar - 13.0 gm. 

Distilled water - 1000 ml. 

The pH was adjusted to pH 7*0, and 12 ml. of 
an O.Olj. percent solution of bromcresol purple were added 
as an indicator. After tubing and autoclaving, a solution 
of the test carbohydrate, sterilized separately by filtra¬ 
tion through a Seitz filter, was pipetted into each tube in 
such quantity as to result in an 0.5 percent concentration 
of the carbohydrate. The tubes were incubated overnight 
and examined for contamination. They were then inoculated 
and observed for growth, acid production, and gas, after 
2 and lip days. The production of acid by an isolate was

taken as evidence of the ability of that isolate to utilize 
the test sugar* The change in color of the agar from purple 
to yellow indicated acid production* 

The results of the tests show (Table XXII) that 
a very high degree of association exists between the abil¬ 
ity of an isolate to produce appreciable amounts of anti¬ 
biotic material and its ability to ferment lactose. In 
almost every instance, those isolates which do not utilize 
lactose are also not active or only weakly active* However, 
those isolates which utilize lactose, as evidenced by the 
production of acid, also produce appreciable amounts of anti¬ 
biotic* Forty-seven of the 52 cultures tested showed this 
relationship at the time the tests were performed. The 
other 5 isolates were later found to also conform to the 
earlier results. 

When the isolates were grown in lactose broth a 
very high degree of association between the ability of an 
isolate to produce appreciable amounts of antibiotic mat¬ 
erial and its ability to lower the pH of the broth was ob¬ 
served* The broth was prepared by essentially the same pro¬ 
cedure as that followed in preparing the lactose agar* How¬ 
ever, neither agar nor bromcresol purple were included in the 
broth medium* Tubes of the medium were inoculated with the 
B* subtilis strains after which they were incubated for 4 
days at 30°C. Following the incubation period measurements 
of the pH of the individual cultures were made with a 
Bechman pH meter* The values obtained are shown in (Table XXII)*

It is quite evident from the results presented 
in the table that those isolates which cause the greatest 
reduction in the pH of the broth are also the ones which 
exhibit the greatest antibiotic activity* In only two 
instances, was this not found to be the case. The pH value 
obtained for the vlj.8 isolate suggests it is not very active 
in the production of antibiotic material* Since vi|8 does 
produce appreciable amounts of antibiotic it is difficult 
to explain this result in relation to the high degree of 
association which is evidenced by the other isolates. The 
fact that acid was produced by the VI 4.8 strain on lactose 
agar slants, however, suggests that a contaminant may have 
been present which inhibited the utilization of the carbo¬ 
hydrate by the isolate when it was grown in the broth. 

The degree of activity which was shown by the 
V38 isolate towards various test bacteria in subsequent 
tests does not support the findings given in Table XXII 
for this isolate* The property of antibiotic activity 
which it possessed in so me of the earlier studies appears 
to have been modified* The antibiotic property of V26 
appears to have been similarly modified.

CHROMATOGRAPHY STUDIES 


Introduction 


Paper chromatography has been successfully used 
in studies on various antibiotic compounds. Goodall and 
Levi (32) found the method valuable for testing purified 
penicillin for traces of other penicillins, Kluener (33) 
employed a paper chromatographic method for the quantit¬ 
ative estimation of penicillin entities. Chromatography 
of a broth culture of Penicillium chrysogenum Q-176 showed 
eight different penicillins to be present in the culture 
liquor (1), Home and Pollard (34) in studies on strep¬ 
tomycin have reported a chromatographic method which they 
describe as an apparently highly selective one for this 
antibiotic. All the polymyxins have been readily Ident¬ 
ified following their separation onpaper (35), Polymy¬ 
xin E was found to be identical in qualitative composition 
to that of polymyxin A, but its rate of movement on paper 
was approximately equal to that of polymyxin B, Porsyth 
(36) studied the antifungal products of several fungi and 
found the method useful in screening the various fungi for 
their antibiotic properties. 

The outstanding success of the method in determin' 
ing the chemical nature of antibiotics as well as other 
organic substances and many inorganic compounds suggested 
the possibility of Its application to antibiotics prodticed

by B. subtilis . 


Methods and Results 


Broth cultures, broth filtrates, butanol extracts 
and chloroform extracts of A32 and some of the more active 
B. subtilis isolates were tested according to the method of 
Gonsden et al . (37)* Test solutions, of pre-determined anti¬ 
bacterial activity, were spotted (20 ul./spot) on strips of 
Whatman #1 filter paper and developed with various solvents. 
The solvent systems employed were: 
n-butanol - water; 

n-butanol - glacial acetic - water; 
n-butanol - ethanol - water; 
chloroform - water* 

When a solvent had moved the desired distance the paper 
strips were air-dried and tested for movement of active 
material* This was done by placing the strips on the 
surface of a layer of agar which had been seeded with the 
test organism X-190* The agar layers were contained in 
8 n x 12 ,f Pyrex-glass trays. The trays to which the strips 
had been added were placed at 5°G to permit leaching of 
active material from the strips and at the same time to 
delay growth of the test bacterium* After a period of 1 
hr* at the low temperature, the strips were removed from 
the trays and then incubated at 30°C for approximately 
l6 hrs♦ Following the incubation period, the trays were

examined for antibacterial activity* 

Paper strips spotted with a mixture of amino 
acids or a mixture of sugars were developed with the 
test strips in a few instances as a check on the method* 

The positions of the amino acids, following development 
with one of the solvents, were determined by spraying the 
strips with a *1 percent solution of ninhydrin in n-butanol* 
The positions of the sugars were determined by spraying the 
paper with aqueous potassium permanganate (1 %) containing 
sodium carbonate (2^)* 

None of the solvent systems shown above were found 
satisfactory when employed for the chromatography of test 
solutions of A32 and the B* subtilis isolates* None of the 
strips exhibited any antibacterial activity when tested 
against X-190* Those systems which conta.ined n-butanol, 
however, gave good separations of both amino acids and 
sugars when these substances were developed at the same time 
as the test strips of the B* subtilis strains* No amino 
acids or reducible carbohydrates were found to be present 
when the strips spotted with the antibiotic solutions were 
sprayed with ninhydrin or potassium permanganate solutions

Other attempts to obtain a migration of active 
material along the paper were also made* The methods used 
for the chromatography of streptomycin (34) and penicillin

suspended in a boiling tube with one end of the strip 
immersed in a broth filtrate of A32. Movement of the fil¬ 
trate solution up the strip was apparent* When the liquid 
had moved the length of the paper, the paper was then air- 
dried and tested for antibacterial activity against X-190. 
Only that portion of the strip which had been immersed in 
the broth filtrate solution showed any activity when tested 
against the test bacterium* Paper strips, used to test 
butanol extracts of A32 by the same procedure, exhibited 
antibacterial activity throughout their length* 

The active material of the A32 strain during the 
process of partial purification apparently undergoes a loss 
in water solubility* This became apparent on testing dis¬ 
tilled water to which a small amount of A32 solid material 
was added* for activity against a test bacterium* No act¬ 
ivity was exhibited by the water preparation* Heating the 
suspension to approximately 95°C for 5 minutes did not 
appear to increase the solubility of the active material 
in water* 

Datta et al * (38) found paper which had been im¬ 
pregnated with aluminum sulfate useful for the separation 
of vitamin A and its derivatives* They emphasized the 
possibility of extending the method to the separation of 
large water-insoluble organic molecules* When the method 
was applied to chloroform extracts of a few of the B* sub - 
tilis strains, movement of the active material was not 


obtained. Antibacterial activity was exhibited only by

those areas where the chloroform solutions had been spot¬ 
ted on the paper. Irrigation of the paper with chloroform 
and benzene did not result in any movement of active mater¬ 
ial along the strips. 

The most promising method employed in the 
chromatography studies was that of Kritchevsky and Tiselius 
(39). They found that paper which had been drawn through a 
5 percent solution of silicone in cyclohexane proved to be 
a satisfactory support for the separation of substances 
such as the steroids which have limited solubility in water# 
In the studies reported here, the following procedure was 
employed# 

Strips of Whatman #1 filter-paper measuring 
10 x 30 cm. were drawn through a 5 percent solution of Dow 
Coming silicone #1107 in cyclohexane. The paper was ren¬ 
dered hydrophobic by this treatment and readily adsorbed 
vapors of chloroform. After the papers had been treated 
with silicone, they were blotted between absorbent papers 
and dried at 105°C for 1 hr. Thirty ul# of different chlor¬ 
oform extracts were spotted at 2 cm. intervals along a line 
7 cm. from one end of the paper. 

The solvent system employed consisted of 6 vol. 
of distilled water, 10 vol. of absolute ethanol and 10 vol. 
of chloroform. These were shaken in a separatory funnel. 
After a period of 1 hr. the non-polar layer was added to the 
bottom of the chromatography chamber. The paper on which 
the test solutions had been spotted was then transferred to 
the chamber and suspended from a glass trough*

The chamber was left standing for 1 hr. to equilibrate both 
the chamber and the paper with respect to the non-polar or 
stationary phase. The polar or mobile phase was then added to 
the trough and the paper was irrigated with this phase for 
22 hr. 

After the solvent had moved the desired dis¬ 
tance along the strip, the paper was removed from the chamber 
and air-dried. It was then tested for movement of active 
material against the test organism X-190. 

When the trays were examined following an 
incubation period, no movement of antibiotic material was 
apparent. However, inhibition zones were present which 
corresponded to the positions on the paper at which the 
chloroform extracts were spotted. 

In a second trial, 105 ul. of chloroform ex¬ 
tract were spotted on the paper. The paper was developed 
as in the foregoing test, but the volumes of the different 
solvents employed were 4 vol. of water, 10 vol. of absolute 
ethanol and 10 vol. of chloroform. When the papers were 
tested for antibacterial activity, inhibition zones corres¬ 
ponding to the positions at which the test solutions had 
been spotted were apparent. In addition, a large zone of 
inhibition was present which corresponded to the position 
on the paper marking the solvent front. 

In a further trial, the papers were again spotted 
with 105 ul. of test solution and then developed with the 
mobile phase of a solvent system consisting of 6 vol. of 
water, 10 vol. of absolute ethanol and 10 vol. of chloroform.

These conditions resulted in a movement of active material 
along the strip. In this trial, however, the inhibition 
zones did not coincide with the position on the paper 
marked by the solvent front. The distance the active 
materials had moved from the starting line relative to 
the distance the solvent had moved from the same position 
was calculated and expressed as a ratio. The values ob¬ 
tained for the various B. subtilis strains tested were A32 - 
.850, V3 - #954, V10 - .868 and V16 - .909. These values 
represent the position of only those zones of inhibition 
which were clearly defined. Other zones of inhibition 
which were less distinct 7/ere also apparent. 

Discussion 


Paper chromatography has been extensively used 
for the separation and identification of many compounds. 

Many solvent systems have been reported. However, in almost 
all of these, water has been used as the stationary phase. 
The use of such systems for substances which are relatively 
insoluble in water limits the use of paper chromatography 
for these compounds. 

In the present studies, those systems in which 
water was employed as the stationary phase failed to give 
satisfactory results when applied to the active material of 
the B. subtilis strains tested. As A32 solid material is 
apparently either insoluble or only very slightly soluble

in water, this may be one explanation for such negative re¬ 
sults. Asparagine broth medium contains the mineral salts 
dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and potassium 
chloride. The fact that the active material of an A32 broth 
filtrate did not move along the paper when strips were sus¬ 
pended in it, suggests that the antibiotic is immediately 
"salted out” by this treatment. In the earlier studies, 
only small quantities of the test solutions were applied to 
the papers. Since filter-paper can effectively adsorb anti¬ 
biotics produced by strains of B. subtil is , this may have 
been an additional reason for the lack of movement of the 
active materials in the earlier studies. 

In the studies employing filter-paper, impreg¬ 
nated with aluminum sulfate, inhibition zones were obtained 
only at those positions on the paper to which the chloroform 
extracts had been applied. These results suggest that the 
treatment of the paper with aluminum sulfate caused the 
active material to be strongly adsorbed to it and therefore 
irrigation with chloroform and benzene was ineffective. 

Kritchevsky et_al. (39) found that substances 
having only limited solubility In water could be readily 
separated by reversing the phases of a two-phase solvent 
system. This was effected by treating the paper with sil¬ 
icone. Following such a treatment the non-polar phase, 
which is adsorbed by the paper, acts as the stationary phase; 
the water, or polar-phase, acts as the mobile phase. When 
this procedure was employed for test solutions of B. subtllis 
strains, the movement of antibiotic material was found to

depend on both the quantity of test solution applied to 
the paper and the volume of water included in the solvent 
system# Although some active material was retained at 
those positions at which the test solution were applied 
to the paper, the degree of adsorption of antibiotic to 
the paper does not appear to be very great. When larger 
quantities of the test solutions were applied, movement 
of active material was apparent. The rate of movement of 
the antibiotics in relation to the rate at which the sol¬ 
vent moves apparently depends on the volume of water which 
is included in the solvent system. By increasing the 
volume of water from 4 volumes to 6 volumes, the rate at 
which the antibiotics moved was noticeably decreased. On 
the basis of the results obtained in the present studies, 
reversed phase paper partition chromatography should prove 
to be a valuable method for determining the chemical nature 
of those antibiotics produced by B. subtilis which have 
limited solubility in water. 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION 


During the past few years much interest has been 
shown in the bacterium B. subtilis . This interest has 
arisen in part from the many reports describing antibiotics 
produced by this species. The present studies designed to 
ascertain the variability in antibiotic production of local 
strains of this species, have demonstrated among them, vary-

ing degrees or antibacterial activity ranging from in¬ 
activity to strong activity towards the test organisms 
used. Approximately 50 percent of the strains tested 
were found to produce appreciable amounts of antibiotic 
material. 

The A32 strain was shown to be a much more 
active strain than many of the isolates tested and to be 
equal to several others in the degree of antibiotic act¬ 
ivity which it exhibits. If media and test conditions 
other than those which were employed, had been used in 
the studies, different results might have been obtained. 

The conditions used in the tests were those found by 
Goodman (18) to support maximum antibiotic production by 
A32. These conditions, however, may not have been opti¬ 
mum for maximum antibiotic production by some of the 
isolates. Poster and Woodruff (9) have reported that the 
bacillin strain of B. subtilis exhibits two types of act¬ 
ivity depending on the culture medium employed. Eirschorn 
et al . (15) reported that the medium used for the production 
of subtenolin greatly influences the yields of this anti¬ 
biotic. A medium containing d 1-alanine gave the highest 
yields, whereas, media containing peptones and complex 
organic enrichments were found to be very poor. Subtenolin 
production was slightly stimulated by the presence of copper 
and strongly stimulated by the presence of manganese. 
Subtilin production is similarly affected by the presence 
of the latter element (7). In the present studies only 
asparagine broth medium was employed. If other media had

been used some of the weakly active strains might have 
exhibited greater degrees of antibacterial activity. 

When the antibacterial spectra of the is¬ 
olates are compared with the spectrum of A32, pronounced 
differences, as determined by various methods, are app¬ 
arent. These differences are believed to be related to 
differences in the types of antibiotics produced. In 
Table XXIII the isolates which exhibited such differences, 
as determined by the various studies indicated in the table, 
are listed. The antibiotics produced by some of the iso¬ 
lates shown in the table may prove valuable not only for 
experimental purposes but also in the control of plant 
and animal diseases. 

Studies on the polymyxins have demonstrated 
that the differences exhibited by the individual antibio¬ 
tics are not absolute (29, i|0)» They are, important, 
however, and are related to differences in the chemical nature 
of the compounds. This has been confirmed by various chem¬ 
ical and biological studies, but more particularly by the 
use.of paper chromatography (35)• By this procedure 
the amino acids threonine and o< - IT - diamino butyric 
acid were found by Jones (35) to enter Into the composition 
of all the polymyxins studies. However, the presence or 
absence of the amino acids D-leucine, phenylalanine and 
serine varied with the antibiotic. These differences and 
the rate of movement of the intact antibiotic on paper 
have been used to classify the polymyxins.

A situation similar to that found to exist with 


the polymyxins may become apparent when more data on the 
chemical nature of the antibiotics of B* subtilis are ob¬ 
tained* The differences shown for some of the isolates, 
while not absolute, are marked differences in several in¬ 
stances* It may be that the antibiotics produced by some of 
the isolates differ from that of the A3 2 strain in either the 
size of the molecule or the presence of various constituent 
groups* As only one broth medium was employed in the studies 
this may have resulted in the production of a substance com¬ 
mon to each strain with possibly other active materials pro¬ 
duced in varying amounts* 

High antibiotic activity was found to be closely 
associated with lactose fermenting ability in the strains of 
B* subtilis studied* This close association between these 
two properties suggests that the fermentation of lactose may 
prove to be a valuable criterion for the isolation of new 
antibiotic producing strains* Such a criterion would be 
particularly useful in screening large numbers of B* subtilis 
isolates for their antibiotic properties. 

Jansen and Hirschmann (7)? as previously des¬ 
cribed, have shown cultures high in subtilin activity to 
give an intense blue color on the addition to the medium of 
a few drops of alcoholic ferric chloride* This was not 
found to be a property of any of the isolates tested in the 
present studies. If a medium favorable to the production 
of subtilin had been employed, some of the isolates might

have given a positive reaction to the test. Goodman (18), 
however, on comparing the antibiotic properties of A 32 and 
a subtilin producing strain found the subtilin strain to 
give a positive ferric chloride test .even when grown in a 
medium supporting maximum production of A 32 antibiotic. 

This suggests that the isolates differ in their antibiotic 
properties from subtilin producing strains of B._ subtilis♦ 

The reversed phase method of paper partition 
chromatography shows considerable promise as a procedure 
for the separation of the antibiotics produced by B. sub ¬ 
tilis isolates. If it should prove to be a successful 
method it will greatly facilitate the classification of 
antibiotics produced by new antibiotically active strains. 
Other procedures employed in paper chromatography may 
prove useful in studies on hydrolyzed material. However, 
unless the antibiotic is in a pure form it would be diff¬ 
icult to separate the impurities from the actual constit- 
uents of the active materials. Such impurities may be the 
result of growth products of the isolate which are anti¬ 
biotically inactive. 

The marked variability exhibited by. the species 
B. s ~a.btllis may prove to be a valuable property in future 
fundamental research on antibiotics.

SUMMARY 


lo This investigation was undertaken to study the 

variability in antibiotic production of local strains of 
Bacil lus subtills . A strain of this bacterium, referred 
to as A32, was used as a standard with which the antibio¬ 
tic properties of the isolates obtained in the present 
study were compared. 

2. Soil- and wheat seed were tested particularly for 

organisms resembling A32 in growth characteristics. Various 
other materials were examined for the presence of this and 
other strains of B. subtills . 

3« Isolates resembling A32 were not found to be 

commonly present on or in the various materials tested* 

This was particularly true of soil and seed. 

4® The A32 strain could not be recovered from non- 

sterile soil to which it had been added. 

5® A total of 54 isolates were obtained from various 

sources and tentatively identified as strains of B. subtilis . 
The antibiotic properties of of these were studied. 

6» Marked variability in antibiotic activity as 

determined by spot-inoculation tests was exhibited by the 
isolates towards strains of Xanthomonas translucens « Fifty- 
four percent of the isolates showed appreciable amounts of 
antibiotic activity towards another test bacterium X-190. 

7. Broth cultures of some of the isolates after fil¬ 


tration through Berkefeld and Seitz bacterial filters differed

in the types of antibiotic present in them 


8 0 In studies employing non-filtered broth cultures 

°f B* s ubtilis strains, a wide range of antibacterial activ¬ 
ity was exhibited# Fifty-two percent of the isolates tested 
were shown to produce appreciable amounts of antibiotic 
activity against the test organism X-190# 

9# Both Berkefeld and Seitz bacterial filters were 

found to remove antibiotic material from broth cultures of 
the Isolates. 

10# When the antibacterial activities of broth cul¬ 

tures and broth filtrates were compared, results were ob¬ 
tained which indicate that some of the isolates produce 
active material which differs from the type of antibiotic 
produced by A32# 

11# Extraction of broth cultures with n-butanol effec¬ 

tively removed antibiotic material produced by the more active 
isolates# When butanol extracts were distilled in vacuo over 
water, extraction of the water layers with chloroform effec¬ 
tively removed the active material* 

12. Strains of B*_ subtilis exhibiting the greatest 
antibiotic activity were found to have a rough type of growth. 
Some of the rough strains, however, were inactive* Isolates 
whose growth was smooth were either only weakly active or in¬ 
active. 

13. Isolates which produced a pink pigment when grown 
on potato slices were only weakly active in the production of 
antibiotic material.

tion of subtilin was negative for all strains. 

15* High antibiotic activity was found to be closely 

associated with the lactose fermenting ability of the 
isolates. 

l6o Paper partition chromatography gave negative 

results when solvent systems in which water was employed 
as the stationary phase were tested. 

17# Reversed phase paper partition chromatography 

was found to be a promising method which may prove valuable 
in the separation and classification of antibiotic materials 
produced by J3. s ubtilis strains having similar antibiotic 
properties to those used in the present study.
