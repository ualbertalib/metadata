INTRODUCTION 







INTRODUCTION 


The evaluation of Old Testament scholarship, as it has 
studied the priestly and prophetic sides of the religion of 
the Hebrew people, has been almost always and almost \in- 
animously in favor of the prophets. That this is a consid¬ 
ered and able judgment I do not intend to deny. But 
insofar as this evaluation has deprecated the legitimate 
place and work of tlie priesthood I think it has been unjust. 
It has become an unfortunate cliche among Biblical students, 
especially those who deal in over-simplifications, that the 
prophetic is always synonymous with the good, and the 
priestly is always synonymous with the bad in the history of 
Israel, Therefore the priests have very rarely been 
deemed worthy of the study that has been accorded the 
prophets and this has meant even greater misunderstanding 
of them, 

I hope that this present study may serve to alleviate 
some of the ignominy that has been cast upon the priesthood, 
not by praising them beyond their desert, but by shov/ing 
their distinct place in the social and religious life of 
Israel, and the development of this status and work as the 
development of the nation and of the people demanded it • 

We must first of all cast aside our modern pre¬ 


suppositions and fix firmly in our minds that no one in

the ancient Semitic world doubted the existence of God (or 
gods), and no one doubted the validity of religion. Prof¬ 
essor Meek has defined religion as: ^ 

"man’s belief that there is in his environment that 
which is greater than himself and upon which he 
feels to some degree dependent, and with which he 
accordingly attempts to establish a, relationship 
of mutual interest and good will." 

This is obviously not a sufficient definition for religion 
in our day, but it is sufficient for that of the day in 
which our study begins and throughout most of the time 
through which it extends. If this is so, and we recognize 
the priesthood as the agency, or at least the prime agency, 
through which this relationship was established and main¬ 
tained, then we must see the importance of its position 
and work in the society of its day. 


it has long been recognized, as Eenri Bergson has 

p 

expressed it, that: 

"It is useless to maintain that (social progress) 
takes place of itself, bit by bit, in virtue of the 
spiritual condition of the society at a certain 
period of its history* It is really a leap forward 
which is taken only when society has made up its 
mind to try an experiment; this means that society

must have allowed itself to be convinced, or at any 
rate allowed itself to be shaken; and the shake is 
always given by somebody * Great •*. reforms have 
appeared at first unrealizable and have been so in 
fact. They could only be realized in a society whose 
spiritual conditions were already those which these 
reforms were to induce through their realization.” 

We cannot, nor do we wish to, seriously argue that the 

priests of Israel ever convinced Israel that she should try 

a social experiment, nor that they were ever the ’somebody* 

who gave the shake to the nation. But the priests were the 

element in society which kept that society at the level 

induced by previous shakes and made it possible for the 

next ’somebody* (usually a prophet) to shake the people 

into a new level of society. The people were always kept 

aware of religious values, especially of the religious 

covenant they had made with their God at Sinai, and this 

was a necessary and valuable preparation for the work of the 

prophetic ’shakers*. But losephus states this point much 

better than we are able: ^ 

"What form of government then can be more holy 
than this? what more worthy kind of worship can 
be paid to God than we pay, where the entire body 
of the people are prepared for religion, where an 
extraordinary degree of care is required in the 
priests, and where the whole polity is so ordered 
as if it were a kind of religious solemnity?**

This preservation of the spiritual level and maintenance of 
a kind of religious solemnity is shown especially by two 
things that will be mentioned in the pages of this study: 
first that the priests were the preservers of tradition and 
law, and second, that they were the preservers of the 
writings of Israel, even the writings of the prophets to 
whom they were supposed to be completely antagonistic. That 
this argues for an appreciation of what the prophets had 
done and were doing seems an inevitable conclusion and would 
force us to re-evaluate the position of the priest for that 
reason alone. 

But apart from the necessity of re-evaluating the 
history and position of the priesthood, and understanding 
of the priesthood in general and of the Old Testament in 
particular is necessary as a background for the under¬ 
standing of many very important elements in the Christian 
religion. ^ A correct interpretation of much of the 
teaching of Jesus and Paul presumes an understanding of the 
institutions with which they dealt. The correct inter- 


^ The term ’Christian’ applied to our religion may be 
very misleading, for actually our religion ought to 
be called ’Hebrew-Christian’, lest we forget that much 
of our religious tradition is directly from the Hebrew 
faith and much even of the early Christian church trad¬ 
ition is indirectly from the Hebrew faith.

pretation of the history of the church since New Testament 
times also presumes this understanding of Hebrew-Christian 
institutions. This has been borne home to me only recently 
by the association in one or two classes in the Hebrew 
Priesthood of a Professor of Church History who felt his 
need in this area. 

I have made my apology for the study, if any apology 
were necessary. Now I must say a word or two concerning 
the difficulties and the method employed. 

The most difficult problem in dealing with any phase 
of the life of the Hebrews in any period is the relevance 
of the sources. All of them, as we have them, are late or 
have been edited by late hands. 'i‘his means that all strands 
of authority must be handled very carefully and nothing 
may be assumed as to date without an attempt to show why 
the date assumed is possioie, jji’obable or certain. However, 
it is generally agreed that even late parts of the Pent¬ 
ateuch and other writings preserve early material, especial¬ 
ly relating to ritual matters and the cult. Therefore, it 
will be permissible to use sources in almost all the 
Biblical books, as long as we are careful not to use them 
indiscriminately and without good grounds for considering 
each of the proper antiquity for our purposes in each case.

After considerable hesitation and consultation as to 
the method of division of the material I have finally 
decided to treat the subjedt in historical periods rather 
than in topical divisions. This facilitates the use of 
sources and makes for a more integrated work. Furthermore, 
there are numerous treatments of the topical divisions 
within each historical period, whereas there are very few, 
if any, treatments of the subject in this developmental 
method from period -to period. 

This study has been carried on over a period of two or 
three years and even yet I feel the inadequacy of the 
treatment. However, if I were to wait until such time as 
I were sure of every point the study would probably never 
be written. Lfuch of every study is soon superseded by new 
material and must be discarded; but much of every study 
also remains of permanent value. I hope that some of what 
I have put down herein may be counted among the latter.

THE MTURE _0F PRIMITIVE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 





Chapter I 


THE NATURE OF PRIMITIVE RELIGIOUS BELIEFS 

The Hebrew people were Semites and their religion, 
in its earliest manifestations, did not differ essentially 
from that of the Semites in general* Therefore, it would 
seem expedient to begin our study with an examination of 
early Semitic religion in general. But we cannot long 
pursue this examination without realizing that the Semites, 
themselves, were only a branch of the whole human family 
and that many of the elements of their religion are 
elements which are common to all mankind in earliest times, 
and to primitive tribes that still persist in our own day* 
We must, then, go back this one further step to seek the 
origins of the beliefs and customs and institutiohs which 
appear among the Semites arid particularly, for our study, 
among the Hebrew people.^ 


Most of this preliminary chapter is based, for source 
material, upon the first few chapters of Oesterley, 
W*0*E., and Robinson, T*H*, Hebrew Religion , (New York, 
Macmillan Company), 1930* Other works have been 
consulted and may be referred to from time to time.

It is obvious that we cannot hope to study the prim¬ 
itive stages of the religion of the Semites at first hand 
since they have long since outgrown that stage of their 
history. But we may study them through the sources available 
to us; and we may study the customs and beliefs of primitive 
peoples who still exist in remote parts of the world today 
and infer with most anthropologists and sociologists, that 
these same customs and beliefs prevailed among primitive 
peoples of all ages and places. When we find vestigial 
remnants of these customs and beliefs in the earliest 

literature that has come down to us from the Semitic peoples 

2 

this inference is given added support. 

There are three stages of belief through which all 
early conditions of men pass at some time. These three, 
animism, totemism (with its related elements, taboo and

ancestor-worship) and polytheism, were probably preceded by 
other less distinct religious phenomena , but we may pass 
over them as being too indistinct for study, and begin with 
these • 

Animism is the belief that many objects have activity 
enough to affect man’s life and that such objects are 
animated by a life and will similar to that of man’s own. 
The movements of trees in the wind, the sound of their 
leaves rustling in the breeze, the twisting, rolling motion 
of streams and rivers, the bubbling up of streams and wells 
and springs, the strange shapes of stones and their power 
to do harm if toppled from their places;' all these things 
suggested life of some kind,^ Among the Semites, the idea 


3 

Mana is the term applied to the earliest ’ideas of the 
holy’. It is, according to H. H. Codrington’s definition 
in The Melanesians , (Oxford, University Press), 1891, 
p. 119, "a power or influence, not physical, and in a 
way supernatural; but it shows itself in physical force, 
or in a kind of power or excellence which a man possesses. 
This Mana is not fixed in anything, and can be conveyed 
in almost anything, but spirits, whether disembodied souls 
or supernatural beings, have it and can impart it; and it 
essentially belongs to personal beings to originate it, 
though it may act through the medium of water, or a stone, 
or a bone,” 

^ Soije scholars make a distinction between animat ism , which 
is the belief that these objects were alive themselves 
or that the life was within them, and animism which is 
the belief that the objects are animated by a power out¬ 
side themselves which only animates them from time to 
time and is not confined to them alone. The distinction 
makes no particular difference to this study.

of trees, especially evergreen trees being life-producing 
was quite common. Later they were thought to be the abodes 
of gods and godesses. In some of the ritual texts which 
have been excavated in Mesopotamian cities, cedars and cypr-** 
esses and tamarisks are mentioned in this connection. 


We might be sure that the Hebrews held these same 
beliefs even if we had no direct evidence. But we do have 
such evidence in the form of reminiscences of these ideas, 
and in some quantity, in the Old Testament# Genesis 12;6-8 
reads; ^ 

And Abraham passed through the land unto the place 
of Shechem, unto the terebinth (oak tree) of Moreh. 
And the Canaanite was then in the land. And Yahweh 
appeared unto Abram, and said; ’Unto thy seed will I 
give this land* and he builded an altar unto Yahweh, 
who appeared unto him. 

Two things should be noted here. First, the tree is called 
the oak of Moreh, which completely translated would be *the 
oak of teaching*. This would suggest that the tree was 
used for the obtaining of oracles, which was certainly a 
practice in the Orient and among the early Greeks. Second, 


5 All quotations taken from the Old Testament, unless 
otherwise noted, will be taken from The Holy Scriptures , 
(Philadelphia, The Jewish Publication Society of America), 
1917, except that I have read ’Yahweh* where this text 
has ’the Lord*. I have chosen this text because, in 
general, it stays much closer to the Hebrew text than any 
of the other translations. I shall feel at liberty to 
change it when I find it inconsistent with the Hebrew or 
if I think I may give a better translation, but all such 
deviations will be noted.

this is the place where Yahweh appeared to Abram and where « 
Abram built an altar to Yahweh. In other words, this was 
a sanctuary. We know, of course, that Shechem was one of 
the earliest and best-known sanctuaries in Hebrew 
tradition. Hosea (4:13) uses this same term »oak» ( jli.v ) 
to mark an illicit shrine. This and other such passages 
would mark it as an early, probably primitive, practice 
among the Hebrew people. ^ 


Likewise the presence of supernatural power in streams 
or rivers or wells or fountains (moving water in general) 
was a commonplace belief among the early Semites. The 
Hammurabi inscription in Ivlesoptamia mentions Naru, the 
river-god.*^ There are n\imerous allusions to water-witches 
and to formulae to work against them. In the Babylonian 
New Year festival the high-priest had to bathe each morning 
before sunrise in the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and on 
the fifth day of the festival, the temple, E-sagil, was 
purified by sprinkling water from these rivers in the 
sanctuary. The classical writers have Many references to 


6 Other such passages are: Gen. 13:18, 17:1 (the oak of 
Mamre -- the Amorites are otherwise mentioned as the 
earliest inhabitants of Palestine 14:13), Gen. 35:4,8 
(burial place under a tree), Ex. 3:2-5 (the burning-bush 
episode in Moses’ life), lud. 4:4-5 (Deborah judging under 
a palm-tree; we shall see later that judging was assoc¬ 
iated with the sanctuary in early Israel). 

^ is probably the same word as that which itself meant 

river, in Hebrew *nahar» („ 1 H D ).

streams from which oracles were obtained even as late as 
the Greek period. So it is not strange that we should find 
vestigial remnants of these beliefs also in the Old 
Testament. 

Wells and springs played a large part in determining 
the situation of sanctuaries in early times. The names or 
these sanctuaries remained through the Biblical period and 
betrayed the primitive origin of them. En-mishpat (spring 
of judgment Gen. 14:7), En-shemesh (spring of Shemesh — 
the sun-god — Josh. 15:7, 18:7), En-eglaim (spring of two 
calves, suggestive of the two bull images of Jeroboam, 

Ez. 47:10), En-ha-tannim (spring of tue dragon, Neh. 2:13), 
Eeersheba (well of seven, or seven wells, Gen. 21:22-23), 
Beer-lahai-roi (well of the living one who sees me, Gen. 
16:14), Beer-elim (well of gods. Is. 15:8) are examples of 
the remnant of this belief. 

V/hat it was about stones that suggested the presence 
of life is much more difficult to determine, but that they 
were connected with animism, and much later v/ere thought 
to house indwelling deities cannot be gainsaid. Among the 
Khasis of Assam the sacred upright stones are regarded as 
males and the flat table stones as females. ® In some

cases tribes may have seen something about the shape of the 
stone, or the markings on the surface that suggested life* 


We have no evidence from Babylonia of the worship of 
stones or animistic beliefs connected with them. It may be 
that the two upright pillars found at the entrance of all 
temples was a survival of the idea. We do have evidence in 
the Old Testament* In Gen. 88;ll-£2 Jacob connected the 
awful presence of God with the stone which he had been 
using for a pillow; 

And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said: 
♦Surely Yahweh is in this place; and I knew it not*. 
And he was afraid and said: ’How full of awe is this 
place! This is none other than the house of God and 
this is the gate of heaven*. And Jacob rose up early 
in the morning, and took the stone he had put under 
his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured 
oil upon the top of it. And he called the name of 
the place Bethel (house of God), but the name of 
the city was Luz at first* (Gen. 88:16-19). 

When Joshua made the covenant with the people at Sheckem, 
he wrote the words in a book and. set up a stone as a wit¬ 
ness, speaking of it as of a thing alive (Josh. 84:87): 

And Joshua said imto the people: * Behold, this 
stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath 
heard all the words of Yahweh which he spoke unto 
us; it shall be therefore a witness against you, 
lest ye deny your God. 

When the Philistines sent away the ark of Yahweh on the 
cart drawn by oxen, the oxen travelled until they reached 
a field in Shechem and stopped before an upright stone and

before this stone the people offered sacrifice (I Sam. 6:14). 
This might be a coincidence but it seems much more likely 
that the stone had great significance for the writer of the 
story. 


The next step in the religious evolution of all 
primitive tribes is the belief in demons. This is essent¬ 
ially the same as animism except that the demons seem to 
have an existence of their own apart from the objects which 
they may animate and their activity is not confined to the 
animation of objects. Indeed, they seem to be completely 
disembodied or connected with mysterious presences which 
can never be seen to be described, ^^st tribes have elab¬ 
orate ceremonies and many trinkets to be worn and potions 
to be taken toward off the evil activity of these demons. 

Of this belief, too, we find reminiscences in the Old 
Testament. Many of the terms that can be shown to mean 
demons have been laboriously explained away but there is no 
more reason to get rid of this belief than of any of the 
others. ^ 

In Num. 81:6 we read of fiery-serpents. The Hebrew

word for ’fiery’ here is that which is later translated 
’seraphim’: 

And Yahweh sent fiery-serpents (seraphim-serpents) 
among the peof)le and they bit the people, and 
much of the people died. 

Brown-Driver-Briggs think that they were originally 
conceived as mythical creatures with serpent’s bodies 
and certainly such mythical creatures were thought to exist 
(cf. Is. 14:29, 30:6) whether they were thought to be demons 
or not. In Lev. 17:7 we read that the people shall no more 
offer sacrifices unto the ’’selirim” which were apparently 
thought to be some sort of demon which needed placatory 
sacrifices. II Chr. 11:15 says that priests were even 
appointed for them. Probably the ceremony of Lev. 16 
retains an element of this placating of demons. Ihere a 
goat is sent off with the sins of Israel on his head, back 
to Azazel in the wilderness. Azazel may well have been the 
demon or god of the waste. 

Another thought category of early primitive religion 
is totemism and all that is connected with it. Totemism 
denotes a form of society in which -che memcers or a group or 
clan think themselves as connected by kinship {even by blood* 

^^Brown, F., Driver, S.H., and Briggs, C.A., A ^brew and 
English Lexicon of the Old Testament , (Boston, Houghton, 
Mifflin Company), 1906, p. 977. ~

relationship ) to the plant or animal from which they 
believe their clan to have descended. The clan partakes of 
the many of the characteristics of the plant or animal. 

This is very characteristic of Indian tribes and of native 
aboriginal tribes of the south seas. But again we find 
traces of it among the early Hebrews. IMny of the tribal 
names are animal names, the most obvious being Leah (wild 
cow, Rachel (ewe), and Caleb (dOg). Though kinship with 
the tribal animal is nowhere seen, kinship with the tribal 
god is (Num. 21:29, 48:46, Jer. 2:27). 

Closely connected with totemism is taboo. It grows 
out of the idea that certain things and animals are holy or 
dangerous and are therefore forbidden. Among all tribes it 
is forbidden to eat the sacred animal, and often to even 
disturb it is violation. Taboo spreads to other things, at 
first connected with the sacred animal and its sanctuary^ 
and then to other less related things. In Hebrew language 
1 taboo is ’unclean’ ( ) and there are innumerable lists 

of acts and conditions which are ’unclean’ given in the 
Priestly literature and especially in the book of 
Leviticus. 

When the tribe considered itself no longer related to 
a sacred animal but instead as descending from a

particular patriarch, elements of ancestor worship crept in* 
It consisted ef keeping up social relationships with the 
dead ancestor, especially the head of the family* This idea 
was wide-spread in Egypt but can be seen in the other 
Semitic lands as well* In Israel, it is most clearly seen 
in the veneration of burial-places into sanctuaries (cf. 

Gen* 23:lff, Geu* 13:18, 18:1 and so on)* It is seen in an 
earlier day in the archaeological remains of cave dwellings 
in Palestine• 

The final step in primitive religious thought is 
polytheism, the belief in many gods and godesses* This is 
similar to the belief in spirits and demons in one sense, 
that the deities are absolutely amoral* They may be good or 
bad in their effect on people but this is not a part of 
their nat\ire, it is due to their caprice and to general 
conditions* The major point of difference is that the gods 
and godesses have individuality, which to Hebrew people was 
bound up with the idea that they had names. There is no 
need to argue the prevalence of polytheism among the 
Seidltes* The name ’elohim* for Gtod is plural and may be 
explained as a plural of majesty but undoubtedly is a 
reminiscence of the earlier time when the gods were plural* 
The inscriptions in Babylonia and Egypt and even as closely 
connected with Israel as the Has Shamra texts in Phoenicia

all list innumerable deities with their consorts. The 
Baals are constantly arising in Israelite literatiire as 
rivals to Yahweh and the defection from Yahv/eh worship to 
worship of them was a problem never solved in pre-exilic 
times. 3ven within Yahweh worship itself, in the earlier 
periods of Israelis histoiy, the gods of other natiohs were 
recognized as real gods but were just not recognized as 
having any authority on Israelite soil nor for Israelite 
interests. 

This, then, is the general background out,of which the 
Hebrew religion among many others developed and the envir¬ 
onment in which the priesthood or priesthoods grew up» V/e 
have said nothing about priests in the primitive period, and 
we can say but little. But where there was belief in 
supernatxiral spirits, in special places where the spirit 
manifested its power, in amoral and capricious gods and 
godesses, there must have been ideas about ways and means 
I of utilizing the good potentialities of this power and 
I protecting oneself from the evil potentialities of it* 
Marrett’s well-known statement that negatively the super¬ 
natural is taboo because positively it is mana, instinct 
with power above the ordinary suggests that people

knew where they stood in relation to the supernaturalo 

Now it is natural that they should suppose that the 
abnormal person, the neurotic-epileptoid to use a term of 
our own day, was, like the moving tree and the bubbling 
stream, animated by an external spirit or power. This 
would be strongly emphasized at times of epileptic fits 
and abnormal seizures which would, for the time being, 
throw the person out of his own mind and, to the mind of a 
primitive person, put him in control of the will of the 
spirit. These became the shamans, the medicine-men, the 
wonder-workers and their abnormal characi^enstics became 
the criteria of fitness to serve the supernatural spirit 
who threatened disaster or offered help. Radin gives many 
examples of the initiation of primitive shamans and 
medicine-men and diviners and in each case they must be 
abnormal, and they must be subjected to great physical and 
mental pain or torture to fit them for complete occupation 
by the spirit from time to time, -however, some of them 
admitted that there were those among them who were not 
actually abnormal but who had to conform to the 
established pattern to keep their position.

At any rate, the first holy-men ^3 were these spirit- 
possessed shamans. The early Hebrew prophets, at whom we 
shall have occasion to look again in connection with the 
early Hebrew cult, were of this shamanistic type. They 
were men possessed by the spirit of Yahweh (I Sam. 10:6, 
11:6, 19:20, 23) and under the influence of that spirit 
(though we must not confuse Yahweh with mana or animistic 
spirit during the Biblical period ) they let themselves go 
in wild, uncontrolled frenzy (I Sam. 10:5-12, 19:18-24, 

II Ki. 9:11). It would seem that in the earliest strata 
of the Old Testament we are still pretty close to this 
particular aspect of primitive religions. 


It would seem a very safe conjecture that the very 
earliest period of the religion of the Hebrew people was 
closely analogous to primitive religion wherever it is 
found and that the origins of religious institutions among 
the Hebrews must be found in these primitive conceptions. 
V/e now leave the primitive period and step into the next

These may correspond to the Hebrew ’ish elohim’ ( bi ’ x 
o'’) and the Canaanite ’qedeshim* ( Q’ hi T p )• These 
latter became in later times in Israel the sacred prost¬ 
itutes of the cult and were not recognized as the 
legitimate part of the religious oultus. Originally 
they were. See Dussaud, Rene, Les Decouvertes de Ras 
Shamra et l^Ancien Testsiment , (Paris, Librairie 
Orientaliste Paul Geuthner), 1937, p. 110.

Chapter II 


NOMADIC PERIOD 






Chapter II 


N0M4DIC PERIOD 

Scholars are unanimously agreed with the Biblical 
narrative of the history of th© Hebrew people to this 
extent, that they did not begin their history as a united 
people in the land of Canaan, But the Biblical account of 
the homogeneity of the Hebrew people from the beginning, of 
their going down to Egypt, of their sojourn in the wilder¬ 
ness during the exodus from Egypt and before the conquest 
of Canaan, and of their settling in Palestine as a people, 
will not stand up under the light shed by archaeology and, 
indeed, by that shed by a careful examinatioh of the 
Biblical traditions themselves. 

The term *habiri’ found in early documents ^ has been 
equated, by most Old Testament scholars, with ’Hebrews’ 
but not as meaning a distinct and \inited nation of people. 
They were rather just a part of the Hittite and Hyksos 
incursions from the north into the fertile crescent and 
they came as mercenaries with these groups or as refugees 
from other parts of eastern Asia. Some of them may have 
moved on south into Egypt and some may have stayed in

Canaan and settled down to a certain extent. Most of them 
led a nomadic life for many decades on the fringe of the 
Palestinian agricultural land and made frequent bothersome 
raids into the more settled country. It is in this role 
that they appear in the Tel-el-Amarna letters. Probably 
they lived in tribes and had little to do with each other. 
Very few of them, probably not more than one or two tribes, 
went-on into Egypt. Many scholars have conjectured that 
only the tribe of Levi went there. Certainly the invasion 
of Canaan which came within two or three centuries is not a 
united invasion of one people coming in from one di recti on o 
Neither the Biblical records nor the archaeological data 
will support such a thesis. We are rather forced to see 
the origin of the Hebrew people as such in several distinct 
groups Though Meek sees three amphictyonies of tribes: 
Asher, Dan, Maphtali, Issachar and Zebulun in the north; 
Machir, Gilead, Gad, Reuben, Ephraim, Manasseh and 
Benjamin in the east central section: and Judah, Simeon 
and Levi along with the Kenites, Calebites, Kenizites and 
Jerahmeelites in the south; yet these groups would not be a 
political or religious unit, but simply a grouping together 
for safety or aggression as occasion demanded. 

^ Meek, Hebrew Origins , pp. 39-40. 








-18- 


There is good reason to believe that the Hebrew tribes, 
before they amalgamated, first in the northern and southern 
confederacy and finally in a united kingdom, had each its 
own tribal god, V/e have noted in the last chapter that 
many of the tribal names suggest animal or even totem gods; 
Leah (wild cow), Rachel (ewe), Caleb (dog), Simeon (hyena), 
Deborah (bee) and others. The god of Ephraim was 
evidently a bull-god 3, The names Jacob-el and Joseph-el 
found in Egyptian and Babylonian inscriptions ^ would 
indicate that Jacob and Joseph were originally the names of 
the tribal gods and the tribal names were taken from them. 
This might be argued also for such names as Israr^l, 

I sham-el and Jerahme-el though these do not appear with the 
loss of the ’el’ element. Other tribal names that are 
found in earlier or contemporary inscriptions and 
literature are Edom, Dan, Gad Asher. We have ample 
evidence in Canaanite material that both Zebul and Jeshur 
are god-names and the Hebrew Jeshurun and Zebulun may well 
be personalized forms of these, Benjamin is probably 
derived from ’bene Meni’ and Meni appears as the name of a 
3 

This point and the serpent-god of the Levite tribe will 
be discussed fully in the later part of the paper which 
deals with the rise of the Levites to the priesthood 
and so will not be more than mentioned here.

god (though often translated as Destiny) in Isaiah 65:11* 
Issachar is almost certainly derived from ’ish Sakar’ 
meaning *man of Sakar* where Sakar is the name of the god. 
The tribal god of Levi was the snake-god, Nahash or Nehustum 

This means that the earliest priest, whatever his 
origin may have been, was a tribal priest only. Vv'e have 
seen that the earliest ’man of God’ or ’holy-man’ was the 
one who was thought for various reasons to be possessed by 
the spirit of the supernatural or the spirit of the god. 

When the god was thought to reside in a particular place 
or in a particular cult object, the priest would be 
associated with that place or object. Nomadic tribes could 
hardly think of their tribal god as being limited to one 
place since they moved about so much and so regularly and 
might never have occasion to return to the place. It was 
customary for nomadic tribes to consider their god as 
dwelling in some object which they could.carry around with 
them. Among the Bedouin tribes even today there is a 
similar tribal representation of the deity. Musil has 
described the Markab of the Ruwala tribe ^ as being a 
square board box carried on a strong camel wherever the

tribe wished to go# It chooses the road the tribe is to 
follow, it spurs them on in battle, and if it is lost to any 
other tribe the power and spirit of the tribe goes with it 
until such time as the I^IIarkab or some little part of it may 
be recaptured. Musil thought this was a peculiar instit¬ 
ution to the Rwala Bedouins but Morgenstern has shown that 
it was quite a common one ^* Many Bedouin tribes had 
similar structures with similar importance. In fact, he 
finds evidence that every tribe had its own. They were 
called ‘otfe’s or kubbes and were all of the same nature as 
the markab and the Hebrew ark with local variations. Musil 
points out that the markab was also an insignia of the 
chief of the tribe and was kept in his tent or near it# 

Since these tribal objects were always attended by a priest 
of shaman of some kind, this would suggest that the chief 
or sheikh of the tribe was a kind of priest or shaman *par 
excellence*. Certainly this is supported by the Biblical 
evidence of the priestly activity of the leaders of the 
tribes — Moses installing the Levites as priests, David 
conducting the ark to Jerusalem, Solomon conducting the 
services of dedication of the temple.

Most scholars point out ® that there was a time when 
all men invoKea the god for themselves and offered 
sacrifices and performed all priestly duties. They offer as 
their evidence the sacrifices of Abraham and Isaac and Noah 
and others. What they say is true, but in each case the 
one doing the priestly duties is the head of the family and 
so probably head of his particular clan or tribe. This 
would constitute him priest in the eyes of the people, if 
what we have conjectured is right, and so it is not a breach 
of the priestly rites. 

The insignia of the dignity of the tribal chief was 
the staff (Jud. 5:14, Gen. 49:10) and this became such an 
important symbol that the words came to be used for the 
tribe itself (matte, shebet). The staff of Moses had 
tremendous supernatural power during the exodus from Egypt 
and through the desert. He used it to strike water out of 
the rock and it turned into the serpent-deity which was the 
tribal god of Levi (Ex. 7:15, 7:17, 14:16, 17:5ff). It 
seems that it was the symbol of the god and that it was the 
means of carrying the god with the tribe. It was in the 
hands of the priest-leader of the tribe.

We have conjectured that the sacred object of the 
Tribe of Levi was the snake-staff of Moses. We know that 
the sacred object of Israel as a whole, possibly only of 
Ephriam while the tribes were still separate, as Meek and 
Morgenstern believe, was the sacred ark of Yahweh. It is 
quite clear that they considered it at least the residence 
of the deity, if not the deity himself. II Sam.. 6:16, in 
telling of the bringing up of the ark from Kiriath-Jearim 
to Jerusalem says: 

And it was so, as the ark of Yahweh came into the 
city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul, 
looked out at the window, and saw King David 
leaping and dancing before Yahweh. 

When the tide of battle was going against the Hebrews at 

the battle of Eben-ezer they brought the ark of Yahweh into 

their camp (I Sam. 4:6-7): 

And when the Philistines heard the noise of the 
shout, they said: ’Y/hat meaneth the noise of this 
great shout in the camp of the Hebrews?* And 
they knew that the ark of Yahweh was come into 
the camp. And the Philistines were afraid, for 
they said: * Surely God is come into the camp*. 

And when the Philistines captured the ark from the Hebrews 

Phinehas* wife named her new-born child Ichabod, for she 

said (I Sam. 4:22): 

The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of 
God is taken. 

The glory {tizid) of Yahweh is very often equated with the 
presence of Yahweh and this is probably its meaning in this

instance. Other passages which bear out the same 
identification of Yahweh with the ark are: Num. 10:35-36 
and II Sam. 6:17ff. It is evident, too, from the miraculous 
things it caused to happen in the camp of the Philistines 
and the way in which it guided the oxen pulling the cart 
on which it was placed (I Sam. 5 and 6) that they thought 
it contained some divine power. 

Just as we have seen that the sacred objects of the 
Rwala and other Bedouin tribes were always attended by a 
priest, or spokesman for the god, so we see that the same 
was the case with the Hebrew ark. 

That it was kept in the sanctuary when not carried 

into battle is shown by I Sam. 4:3-4i 

Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out 
of Shiloh unto us, that he may come among us and 
save us out of the hand of our enemies. So the 
people sent to Shiloh and they brought from thence 
the ark of the covenant of Yahweh of hosts. 

In I Sam. 7:1, when the ark was brought into the house of 

Abinadab, they had to sanctify (_)LiiTp ) someone, Sleazar 

the son of Abinadab, to keep the ark of Yahweh. In Jud. 

17 :5, when Micah made for himself an ephod and terraphim he 

had to consecrate comeone to be his priest. The terraphim 

were hever a legitimate part of the Hebrew cult and the 

ephod was either another sacred object almost identical with 

the ark or a later glossator’s insertion where »ark»

should have been read 9. in either case the priest was 
necessary because of the presence of the sacred object of 
the tribe. In II Sam. 15:24, when David was fleeing from 
Jerusalem: 

Lo, Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him, 
bearing the ark of the covenant of God, and they 
set down the ark of God. 

In I Ki. 2:26, serving the ark seems to be almost a synonym 
for the priesthood: 

And unto Abiathar the priest said the king: *Get 
thee to Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou, 
art deserving of death; but I will not at this 
tijue put thee to death, because thou didst bear the 
ark of Yahweh, God, before David my father, and 
because thou wast afflicted in all wherein my 
father was afflicted. 

In,the later priestly legislation the Levites were to 
carry the ark and the sacred utensils (Num. 4:1-3, 15, 
3:29ff, I Chr. 15:2, II Chr. 5:4ff) and the priest was to 
perform all ceremonies connected with it (Num. 4:4-14, 
18:1-7). Now the ark, if it existed at all in the Second 
Temple, certainly never had to be carried anyv^here, so 
this must be a reminiscence of this earliest of functions 
of the priesthood. For it seems to me that this was the 
earliest function of the Hebrew priesthood of which we 
have actual witness in the Old Testament records.

The two root words used of the priesthood in the 
Hebrew language may bear this idea.out. If ’cohen* ( 1113 ) 
meaning priest , is to be derived from the root »kun* ( JID) 
meaning to stand . be present at , or stand before , it would 
mean one who stands before * This use of the root ’kun* 

( j'JD ) is actually an idiom for doing service in general^^ 
and this would certainly support the idea we have gained 
from the other evidence Likewise, the term Levite, 

’lewi’ ( ) may be derived from the root ’lawah* 

( ), meaning to twine , or to attach oneself to . which 

could well have been used to designate an escorting 
attendant priest or priesthood which attached itself to the 
sacred object, the ark, during the nomadic period. 


The primary and original object and function of the 


priesthood, then, was to provide the deity, thought to be 


resident in the sacred object, with a permanent attendant^^. 


who for some reason or other was thought to be peculiarly

However, we shall have occasion to see that it ma^ also 
have been derived from the Arabic *kahina* (vLvAp ) 
Meaning ’diviner, soothsayer*. This would stillsupport 
our idea as it is developed in the following pages. 

This root and the origin of the Levitical priesthood 
will be dealt with more fully in the section on the 
rise of the Levites.

suited for this position. But this is a very general 
service and there were more specific functions connected 
with it, which were also nomadic in origin and character* 
The chief among these was the giving of oracles, or the 
communication of the will of the deity to the people , 


The earliest suggestion of this is the account in Num. 10; 

33 of the guidance through the wilderness; 

And they set forward from the mount of Yahweh three 
days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of 
Yahv/eh went before them three days journey, to seek 
out a resting place for them. 

Now, we have seen how the sacred objects of the Bedouin 

tribes guided them on their journeys but only through the 

word of the attendant priest,-^ and we may be sure that it 

was in the same way that the ark guided Israel. The 

instances in the Bible which refer to oracles given through 

the ark are almost all connected with military campaigns. 

In lud. 18:5, 20:27-28, I Sam, 14:18, 37-43, 23:9-12, 30:7 

we have such cases. In each case there is involved in the 

oracle-giving, either an ark of Yahweh (lud, 20:27 and 

I Sam. 14:18, 36ff.) or an ephod (lud. 18;5, I Sam.23:9-12,

30:7)* We have shown the ark to have been the sacred object 

of the Hebrews. There has been much controversy over the 

19 

nature of the ephod. Arnold has made a very strong case 
for the idea that the reading »ephod» wherever it means a 
solid object, has been substituted for the reading ’ark’ 
which was original. The strongest support for this is in 
I Sam. 14:18 where the Masoretic text reads ark { J ^ ) 

and the Septuagint reads ephod {tC^ovS ) suggesting that the 
Hebrew original from which it was translated into Greek had 
ephod ( ) there which was a later reading substituted 

for ark ( )• This seems sound reasoning to me. At 

any rate it was a sacred object of some kind; it might have 
been originally the sacred object of one of the other tribes 
whose memory was not entirely wiped out when the tribes 
came together and adopted the ark as the national sacred 
object. 

The manner in which the priest obtained this oracle 
from the sacred ark (or from Tahweh through its medium) is 
also a matter of some conjecture. Two things we know for 
certain: first, that the ark was believed to contain two 
objects, ordinarily thought to be the two tables of stone

which moses received from ^ahweh (Deut. 10:1-5) but 
possibly originally two sacred betyls second, that the 
Urim and Thummim (whatever they may be) were priestly 
instruments for something or other (Ex» 28:13-30, Lev. 8, 
Deut. 33:8)* Muss-Arnolt compares the chief featiires of 
the Urim and Thummim with the chief features of the Tablets 
of Destiny of the Babylonians and comes to this 
conclusion: 

"These feat\ires have led us to assume that the 
Babylonian Tablets of Destiny and the Urim and 
Thummim were originally one and the same, a 
means by which, according to the belief of the 
early ancestors of both nations, the divine 
powers (or power) communicated their will and 
their decisions to king and natioti." 


In I Sam. 14:41-43, Saul speaks to Yahweh, presumably 

through the priest (vs. 36-37) and his ark (v. 18), and 

refers to the process as one of taking lots; 

Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel: 
’Declare the right.’ Ahd Jonathon and Saul were 
taken by lot, but the people escaped. And Saul 
said; ’Cast lots between me and »Jonathon, my son’. 
And Jonathon was taken. 

For this last part the Septuagint gives a much fuller 


i^rgenstern in "The Ark, the Ephod and the Tent of 
Meeting" notes that the ’kubbe’ of the Bedouin tribes 
contained two betyls. The word betyl is a variant of 
bethel meaning ’house of deity’ or ’habitation of deity’®

reading; 

Why dost thou not answer thy servant this day? 

If it he in me or Jonathon, this iniquity, Yahweh, 

God of Israel, give Urim; hut if this iniquity 
dwells in thy people Israel •••• 

This reading, if there h? any good basis for it, would 

substantiate Muss- Arnolt’s conclusions. 

The function of judging attaches to the priest from 

this nomadic period for two reasons. It was natural that, 

in the case of a dispute between two people over any 

matter, the word of ^ahweh would be sought to decide it 

and this word would come through the priest by manipulation 

of the sacred lot, From the very earliest times onward in 

Biblical literature the sanctuary was the depository of law 

and the priest the mediator of it. In the oldest 

Pentateuchal legislation (Ex. 22:7ff) the sanctuary is the 

19 

place where legal questions were to be settled . It 
would seem logical, then, to believe that the function of 
judging as a function of the priest existed in the nomadic 
period, too* 

The second reason is, as we have seen, that all prim¬ 
itive peoples make their tribal leader their priest, or at

least one of their priests, and we know, from ancient and 
modern Semitic literstxire, that the chief or sheikh of the 
tribe was the supreme judge. In later times (with the 
Hebrews, after they entered 4nd settled in Palestine), a 
more complex legal system grew up in which the elders of 
the city formed a court which sat in the city gate. This 
was predominantly a civil court, although in the Deut- 
eronomic period the priests were again associated with it 
(Deut. 17:8). 

The lot would be the chief way of determining justice 
but there are hints of other methods even more magical. 

The story of the testing of the woman accused of adultery 
by making her drink the * bitter water» which would cause 
her to miscarry if she were guilty (Num. 5:11-31) is surely 
a remnant of an earlier practice than the time of writing 
(it is fo\md in the Priestly writing) for it is analagous 
to practices common among the Semites of an earlier time. 

The nomadic period of the history of the Hebrews, 
then, was a period in which the priesthood was still^ 
largely undeveloped. The priest attended the sacred 
object'*^ among the Hebrews the ark; he communicated ther 
will of the god — at first a different god for each tribe, 
then the god Yahweh for many of them — to the people by 
means of the sacred lots; he was often the chief or sheikh

of the tribe; he was not settled in one place for the 
tribe moved about and the priest must move with it and 
with the sacred ark. 

The next period in the history and development of 
the priesthood is the period of settlement in Canaan and 
the period in which the sacred object was more or less 
stationery in one sanctuary and the tribe remained in one 
place. It is also the period in which the influence of 
agricultural life and the religion of their agricultural 
neighbors would be felt by the Hebrews. 

This is the period to which we now give our 
attention.

(THE SAHCTCARY PERIOD) 








Chapter III 


THE PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT 
(The Sanctuary Period) 

As long as the Hebrew people were nomadic there was 
practically no possibility of there being a permanent 
sanctuary, and where there is no permanent sanctuary there 
is very little opportunity for a cult to be built up. 
Therefore, in the nomadic period the priesthood was very 
simply organized and had very simple duties and specific 
functions. In fact, one man often acted as sheikh, priest, 
military leader and general handy man. Two things happened 
when the various tribes entered Palestine. First, the 
various tribes united for the invasion into two or three 
main groups. There was a northern amphictyony of tribes 
under Joshua which entered Palestine from the north and in 
the eastern central section. There was a southern 
amphictyony of tribes under M^ses (or under the Judahites 
as some scholars claim) which entered Palestine from the 
south. Only on the basis of this general hypothesis can 
all the facts of both Biblical narratives and the arch¬ 
aeological evidence be accounted for. Furthermore: ^

”The Hebrew tribes installed in Canaan tried then 
to perpetuate the regime of quasi-anarchy which 
was theirs in the desert. But the necessity of 
defending their land which they now cultivated, 
their orchards, their towns and cities against the 
Philistines who were disciplined and well-armed, 
obliged these old Bedouins who had become tillers 
of the soil to accept the new creation of regional 
dynasties such as that of Gideon and of Jephtha, 
and then a national monarchy embracing all the 
tribes.” 


Second, with the sacred object established in one 
place, the functions attached to it and to its attendant 
priesthood became more complex, the ritual involved in its 
attendance was added to and new ritual evolved, until a 
sanctuary with a considerable cultus grew up around it. 

There are many reasons for believing that there were 

other cult members of the sanctuary attendance than just 

the priests. Meek has pointed out that the early Yahweh 

2 

prophets were of the shamanistic type and there are ^ny 
cases where these prophets are associated with the cult 
When Saul came to Samuel to inquire regarding his father’s 
lost asses Samuel gave him certain directions among which 


2 Meek, ”Some Religious Origins of the Hebrews”, p. 125. 

Much of the material on the cult prophets in this 
chapter was gained from a reading of a paper by Mr. 
Herbert Otwell, "Prophet and Cult in Ancient Israel”, 
written for a seminar on the Hebrew Priesthood in 
Pacific School of Religion, 1945. None of it, however, 
is taken either verbatim or as organized in his paper.

was that in I Sam* 10:5: 

After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, 
where is the garrison of the Philistines; and 
it shall come to pass, when thou art come 
thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a 
band of prophets coming down from the high 
place with a psaltery, and a timbrel, and a 
pipe, and a harp, before them; and they will 
be prophesying® 

In at least two other passages {II Ki® 2:3, 4:38) the 
groups known as the ’sons of the prophets’ are shown to be 
residing at sanctuaries. 

So they went down to Bethel. And the sons of the 
prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, 
and said unto him .... (2:3). 

And Elisha came again to Gilgal; and there was a 
dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets 
were sitting before him .... (4:38). 

In view of these two passages and of the connection of the 

prophets with the high-place ^ in I Samuel, it could well 

be that II Ki. 2:5 also refers to a sanctuary, though we 

have no assurance that lericho was a sanctuary site. 

So they came to Jericho. And the sons of the 
I prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha 

1 and said unto him .... (2:5). 

jvyelch thinks this is so, and when we note that it is cast 
in the Identical mold of 2:3 as a literary unit this seems 


The ’high-place’ was the customary place for a sanctuary 
with the Canaanites and it was one of the customs, later 
abolished, which the Hebrews seem to have taken over 
from them.

an almost inevitable conclusion. ^ 

Furthermore, the prophets are grouped as one unit 

with other instruments of the cult, when Saul vainly tried 

to consult Yahweh toward the close of his life (I Sam.E8:6) 

And when Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh answered 
him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by 
prophets. 

So Saul went to visit a ’woman that divineth a ghost’ 

(I Sam. 28:7) and when she raised the ghost of Samuel, Saul 

confessed to him (I Sam. 28;15b): 

”I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make 
war against me, and God is departed from me, and 
answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by 
dreams; therefore I have called thee ...” 

When Jezebel was trying to wipe out Yahweh religion 
(I Ki. 18), Obahiah hid a group of four hundred prophets. 
Surely they must have been part of the cult and that they 
were a band is very similar to the fact that the Baal 
prophets wiped out by Elijah were also four hundred in 
I nximber. 

\ 

And, in that connection, Elijah himself was a prophet 
of Yahweh, closely enough connected with the sanctuary cult 
to sacrifice to Yahweh, and to rebuild his altar, and say, 
(I Ki. 19:10):

have been very jealous for Yahweh, Grod of hosts; 
for the children of Israel have forsaken Thy cov¬ 
enant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy 
prophets with the sword. 


V\fhoever wrote II Ki. 4:23 thought it was customary 
for the prophets to be consulted on festival days, which 
were special days in the cult of the sanctuary, for he 
wrote: 

And she called to her husband, and said: ’Send me, 

I pray thee, one of the servants and one of the 
asses, that I may run to the man of God, and cojj^e 
back.’ And he said: ’Wherefore wilt thou go to 
him today? It is neither a new moon nor sabbath.’ 

This term ’man of God’ is customarily thought to mean the 

early prophet, whom Mr. Otwell has called the cult prophet. 

It may well be that he is yet another member of the 

sanctuary cult, similar to the ’qedeshim’ of the Ras Shamra 

texts. This is Dussaud’s view : 

”As for the ’qedeshim’, they are, as their name 
indicates, men particularly consecrated to the 
deity. It may be that their institution merited 
the discredit thrown on them by the Old Testament; 
but it is not certain that this was primitively so. 

We must not forget that the Biblical authors accused 
of prostitution all the adorers of strange gods. 

In the period with which we are occupied, the title 
(consecrated one’ ought to correspond to that ’man 
of God’ (o’ hi'.V ) applied to seers and 

prophets in the'Old Testament.”

At any rate, we have shown that the early sanctuary 
was served by cult prophets as well as by priests. There 
is another class of attendant of the deity who may or may 
not be equated with the priest. That is the »seer* of the 
early records of the Old Testament. 


Samuel is such a person, and it is in this capacity 
that he meets Saul and directs him to find his father’s 
asses (I Sam. 9:18ff); 

Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said: 
’Tell me, I pray thee, where the seers house is’. 
And Samuel answered and said: ’I am the seer; go up 
with me unto the high-place, for ye shall eat with 
me today; and in the naming I will let thee go, 
and will tell thee all that is in thy heart. 

7 

Otwell makes Samuel a prophet throughout his life, but 

there is good reason to believe that in this early part of 

( 

his career he was a priest. For in I Sam. 8:11 he is 
dedicated to the service of Yahweh, a terminology which is 
characteristic of the priest’s position, and in 8:18 he 
wears an ephod before Yahweh, a costume which, in 8:88 
(though this is a late passage), is identified with the 
service of the priest. 


In II Sam. 15:87 Zadok, who is certainly a priest and 
nowhere called a prophet, is referred to as a seer.

Lofthouse ^ thinks that the priests, *kohen* ( jfl'D),

place there were a niimber of different attendants of the 
deity and the work of the deity, but that in the formative 
stages of that cult, which is the stage which we are 
discussing in this chapter, these various members were not 
differentiated very much or very clearly either in nature 
or in function. 

This is the period in which hundreds of sanctuaries 
sprang up throxighout Israel. Though we have spoken of the 
ark as the sacred object of the Hebrews we must not think 
of it as singular, or that necessarily all the sacred 
objects would be the same. It is very probable, though we 
have no definite evidence of this, that the tribes still 
kept their individual tribal objects. Traces of the snake 
idol remained in the worship of Israel as late as the 
reformation of Hezekiah when it is recorded (II Ki. 18:4) 
that: 

L. 

He removed the high-places, and broke the pillars, 
and cut down the Ashe rah; and he broke in pieces 
the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto 
those days, the children of Israel did offer to it 
and it was called Nehushtun. 

The periodic revival of the worship of the golden calf in 
the northern kingdom may indicate that the calf was the 
cult object of that group of tribes. Arnold has shown

that there must have been far more than one ark of Yahwreh 
in Israel, and he has conjectured that every sanctuary had 

one« 

Certainly we know that there were many sanctuaries and 
that there was not very much connection, the one with 
another, ’•‘■'he terms sanctuary and high-place are synonymous 
in early literature ^3. Families often had their own 
personal sanctuaries with priests to attend them (cf* 

Judges 17:1-5). 

We may be quite sure that the Hebrews just adopted the 
local sanctuaries which they took over fromthe Canaanites 
on their entrance into the land. Along with this they must 
also have taken over certain of the rites that were pract¬ 
ised at them. The earliest calendar of religious festivals 
is a Canaanite calendar. Only four of the names of the 
months in it survive in the Bible but of these four, 
three have been found in Canaanite inscriptions and so we 
we may add to our four the extra names in those

inscriptions. Many of the religious customs banned by the 
Deuteronomic reform were originally Canaanite customs. This 
is especially true of rites connected with agriculture and 
fertility of the soil. 

The function of Judging, which attached to the 
attendant of the ark in the nomadic period, now attached 
to the priest of the different sanctuaries. But after this 
Judging had been done for a few years a considerable body of 
common-law would be built up and matters would be brought 
to the priest which would require his reference not to the 
oracle but to previous decisions. Only thus can we account 
for the fact that Moses is represented as acting as Judge 
in the disputes of his people (Ex. 18:14ff) pre-supposing 
a certain body of law already accumulated and without any 
reference to any extraordinary method of learning Yahweh’s 
will. Only thus, too, can we account for the codes of law 
that make their apr;earance at such an early stage of 
Hebrew history. 

The preserving of tradition and of law became their 
duty. The stories of each shrine, telling of the myth¬ 
ological origin of them, were kept at the shrine by oral 
transmission. The place which memory plays in Old Testa¬ 
ment is a large one and it is closely attached to the shrine 
as ’the place where Yahweh God shall

remembered there*. 

There are no specific passages regarding the practice 
of sacrifice in this period, as being the duty of the 
priesthood. Sacrifice has always been the most significant 
religious act of early religions. But for many centuries 
of Hebrew history the priest was not necessary to this act. 
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob sacrificed whenever and wherever 
they pitched their tents and with no help save their own 
(Gen. 12:6-8, 13:18, 26:25, 35:9-15). When Moses made the 
covenant as described in Ex. 24:5, the sacrifice was 
performed by the young men of the clan. Kings, like Saul 
(I Sam. 14:35) and David (II Sam. 6:17,18); prophets, like 
Elijah (I Ki. 18); ordinary individuals, like Gideon (Jud. 
6:24-26) and Manoah (Jud. 13:19), sacrificed without ado. 
Jeremiah went so far as to say that sacrifice had never 
been commanded by.Yahweh; so, as far as he was concerned 
anyway, it was never one of the original functions of the 
priesthood (Jer. 7:21ff). 

But by the time of the Deuteronomic Code it had become 
a duty of the priesthood and it may well be that it was 
during this period of the sanctuaries that it was beginning 
this trend. In the earliest period and in the nomadic it 
was a family affair. But when the sanctuaries grew up

sacrificing was transferred to them. At least that is the 
implication in the Deuteronomic Code when it commands that 
sacrificing shall no longer he done at the local sanctuaries 
hut shall he brought to Jerusalem (Deut. 12:Iff). 

V/e have seen, then, that this period of settlement in 
Canaan was a period in which there were numerous local 
sanctuaries served hy local priests, cult prophets and 
seers and other local functionaries. There was no organized 
priesthood. But this is not the story which we are told in 
the sources which were written hy J and E and edited and 
added to hy P, the Priestly writer. This story tells us 
that Moses instituted the priesthood, that he set apart the 
levites to he priests of Yahweh, that they and they alone 
served that office until the time of the Exile. After the 
Exile they were relegated to a subordinate place in the 
temple service to the Zadokite priests. We are not yet 
concerned with the post-exilic picture hut we must give 
considerable space to the Priestly theory of the priesthood 
and it is with this that the next chapter will deal. It 
will carry us through two periods which will he the 
subjects of the following two chapters hut we must risk this 
confusion in order to present an orderly discussion of the 
problem of the Levitical priesthood. 









Chapter IV 


THE RISE OF THE. LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD 







Chapter IV 


THE RISE OF THE LEVITICAL PRIESTHOOD 

The term ’Levite* is such a common one in our Biblical 
vocabulary that we suppose it to have been used throughout 
the Old Testament and into the New. By checking with 
Young, R., Analytical Concordance to the Bible , (New York, 
Funk and Wagnalls Company), we discover that out of a .total 
of three hundred and forty-four occurrences, only fifty- 
two are in pre-Exilic literature while two hundred and 
ninety-two are in Exilic and post-Sxilic literature Of 
the fifty-two early references, twenty-six were in Deutv 
eronomy. This would certainly suggest that the theory of 
the Levitical priesthood from the very beginning was the 
figment of the imagination of the Priestly writer. 


V/e begin our examination of the evidence with two 
early passages in which Levi appears as a secular tribe* 

I ^ This chapter is based upon a paper, A History of the 

Levites . written by Mr* Herbert Otweil, for a seminar in 
the l!^acific School of Religion, on the Hebrew Priesthood. 
I acknov/ledge my indebtedness to Mr. Otweil for an 
organization of the material but I have covered all his 
sources thoroughly and feel that the chapter as here 
given is largely my own. 

2 ky source in working out the date of the references was 
Driver, S.R., Introduction to the Literature of the Old 
Testament , (New York, Charles Scribner’s Sons), 1898.

The first is the ’curse* of Simeon and Levi in Gen* 49:5-7: 

Simeon and Levi are brethren; 

Weapons of violence their kinship. 

Let my soul not come into their council; 

Unto their assembly let my glory not be united; 

For in their anger they slew men, 

And in their self-will they houghed oxen. 

Cursed be their anger for it was fierce, 

And their wrath for it was cruel; 

I will divide them in Jacob, 

And scatter them in Israel. 

Though the reference here is to individual persons, the 

consensus of the opinions of scholars is that it really 

refers to tribes. Various dates have been assigned to this 

passage but all are early. Skinner would seem to place it 

very early since Simeon is not mentioned in the invasion of 

Palestine . Meek places it in the time of the early 
4 

monarchy . If we accept these dates it means that at this 
early date we have a reference to the tribe of Levi which 
does not refer to it any priestly functions or character¬ 
istics, but instead curses it along with Levi for its very 
brutal secular nature. 


Another passage just as important in this same 


^ Skinner, J., A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on 
Genesis , (New York, Scribner’s)7 1917, (international 
Critical Commentary Vol. I), p. 518. Skinner does note 
that the ’P’ account of the invasion mentions Simeon but 
the portion ascribed to Simeon is part of that usually 
ascribed to Judah: Josh. 19:1-9, 15:26-32, 42, I Chr. 
4:28-33).

connection is Genesis 34. Although there is considerable 
confusion within the chapter most scholars, among them 
Skinner ^ and Burney give it also an early dax.e. The 
confusion may be a result of the conflation of the J and 
E sources for this is certainly JE material. T"he incident 
occurred during the invasion of Palestine by the Hebrews. 

It is too long to quote in full. Jacob had settled near 
Shechem, inhabited by the Hamorites. One day, his 
daughter Dinah was violated by the men of the town when she 
went in to visit some of the women. Jacob was ready for 
vengeance when he found out that the violator wanted to 
marry her. The Israelites agreed to this on the condition 
that all the men be circumcised. The Hamorites agreed to 
this condition hoping to make a permanent alliance but 
before it could be effected Simeon and Levi came into the 
picture (vv, £5-30): 

And it came to pass on the third day when they (the 
Hamorites) were in pain (from the clrc\imcision) 
that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, 
Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword, and 
came upon the city unawares, and slew all the 
males. And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son 
with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out 
of Shechem’s house and went forth. The sons of 
Jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city,

because they had defiled their sister. They took 
their flocks and their herds and their asses and 
that which was in the field; and all their wealth, 
and all their little ones and their wives, took 
they captive and spoiled, even all that was in the 
house • And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi: »’Ye 
have troubled me, to make me odious unto the inhabit¬ 
ants of the land, even unto the Canaanites and the 
Perizzites; and I being few in number, they will 
gather themselves together against me and smite me 
and I shhll be destroyed, I and my house. 

The answer to this charge is simple and concise: ^Should 

one deal with our sister as with a harlot?’’ 


Burney, Skinner and Meek agree that this is an account 
of a treacherous attack by the tribes of Simeon and Levi 
upon a Canaanite city. The first two think it is the city 
of Shechem, Meek that it is a southern city since both 
Simeon and Levi are southern tribes and invaded Palestine 
from that direction ^. It may well be that this is the 
occasion of the disappearance of Simeon and Levi as secular 
tribes. Por, from this time onward, Simeon does not appear 
again and Levi only as the priests, or as a group of priests 
Rowley ® thinks the two tribes fled south, Simeon to be 
absorbed by Judah along with soi^e of the Levites, and most 
of the Levites to move further south and into Egypt during 
Iknaton’s reign.

It seems logical to connect this story in Gen. 34 with 
the curse in Gen. 49:5-7. Jacob here protests that these 
two tribes have ruptured his peaceful relationships with 
his Canaanite neigriDors and that he may have to suffer for 
it. Their weapons resulted in great slaughter in this 
story and this agrees with the description in 49:5. And 
the impression left by both of them is that ^evl was a 
secular tribe. Supporting evidence is found in other slight 
references. In Gen. 29:34 the J writer gives the birth 
account of Levi and derives the name from a root meaning 
joining (the same root as we observed in a previous chapter) 
but the joining is a matter of love between Leah and Jacob, 
and not the priestly connotation we noted it might have had. 
This new connotation may have been introduced later when 
they were a priestly group. In Ex. 2:1 the L writer lists 
Levi as one of the tribes to enter Egypt before the revel¬ 
ation of Yahweh to Israel; therefore it must have been a 
secular tribe at this time. Deut. 10:8 presupposes a 
period in which Levi was a secular tribe; otherwise the 
setting-aside of Levi for priestly duties would have no 
meaning. 

Now, if Levi were once a secular tribe, as we have 
concluded, there is the possibility which we mentioned 
earlier in connection with all the tribes, that it

worshipped another god than Yahweh. even have the word 
of the E, D and P writers that there was a time when the 
Israelites did not know Yahweh. The suggestion which many 
scholars support and which we mentioned before, that the 
tribal god of Levi was the snake-god, becomes a definite 
possibility* Skipworth ^ derives the name »Levi’ ( )

Waterman mentions a Levi-el in an Egyptian inscription 
which suggests a serpent deity of some kind. The name of a 
Levite which occurs in I Chr. 2:10,11, Ruth 4:20, lx. 6:23 
is Nahshon, strongly suggestive of Hehushtun, the serpent- 
deity image mentioned in the Old TestamentMeek has 
amassed several different types of evidence in this connect¬ 
ion and we give it briefly here Moses, who was a 

Levite, set up a serpent-deity in the desert to heal the 
people (Nem. 21:5-9). He used the magic wand (the serpent

insignia) in Egypt and against the iimalekites (Ex. 17:8-16). 
The wand turned into a serpent in the narrative of Ex. 4:2ff 
and performed many miracles (Ex. 7:15, 7:17, 14:16, 17:5ff). 
Many serpent names among the Levites in comparison with 
practically none among the other tribes is a further 
supporting observation. Certainly the archaelogical 
findings in Palestine have shown the presence of serpent 
cults in the country during the period of the Hebrew 
occupation. 

To understand the period during which the Hevites 
gradually became the priestly guild of the Hebrews we must 
have clearly in mind the earlier chapters of this paper. 

The sanctuaries were scattered all over the land. They 
were largely personal or family sanctuaries and at the most 
were merely local. They were served by individual priests 
who were drawn from the locality of the sanctuary and the 
reverence paid to the sanctuary was not so very great. 

After all, the little boy Samuel, who was just beginning 
his apprenticeship as a priest’s assistant was allowed to 
sleep in the room where the sacred object was kept (I Sam. 
3:3). Until there were enough sanctuaries and comparatively 
large ones, ,no widely organized or related priesthood was 
possible or necessary.

story of the sanctuary of ^“^Icah (Jud. 17-18). Here Micah 
made iroages for himself and set them up in his household 
and established one of his own sons as priest to attend it. 
But a wandering Levite from the south appeared seeKing 
empioymeuu. When he met Micah this conversation took 
place (vv. 9-10,); 

And Micah said unto him; ’Whence comest thou?’ And 
he said to him: ’I ara a Levite of Bethlehem in 
Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a 
place’. And Micah said unto him; ’Dwell with me, 
and be unto me a father and priest, and I will 
give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a 
suit of apparel and thy victuals.’ So the Levite 
went in. 

This done, IViicah was very content for he was sure Xahweh 

would prosper him now that he had a Levite for a priest. 

Later, the tribe of Dan passed by on a military movement 

to the north and the Levite priest predicted success for 

them when they stopped to enquire. So when the rest of the 

tribe followed after this vanguard they took the Levite 

with them saying to him when he objected {18;19b): 

’Hold thy peace, lay thy hand upon thy mouth, 
and go with us, and be to us a father and a 
priest; is it better for thee to be priest 
unto a tribe and family in Israel?’. 

This account indicates a certain priority of the Levites 

in the priestly service. But the Levite was invited to 

become priest; there is no hint that he had any prior right 

to the position. And the sanctuary is a local one, not a

large or hi^ly influential one* 

There is another story in Judges 19-20 concerning 
another Levite. It is one of those grim stories which 
justify the comment that ’there was no king in Israel’* 

A Levite who lived in the highlands of Ephraim had taken 
for'himself a Bethlehemite concubine. She became angry with 
him and returned to Bethlehem to her father’s home. The 
Levite followed and after some time brought her back to the 
north, as far as Gibeah the first day. That night the men 
of Gibeah demanded that he come out that they might have 
intercourse with him (cf. the story of Sodom and Gomorrah). 
His host refused but sent out his concubine in his stead. 

In the morning she was dead from the treatment she had 
received at their hands. Yi/hen he reached his home he 
called upon the tribes of Israel to avenge this treatment 
and the offending tribe of Benjamin was nearly wiped out. 

Our concern is not with the morals of this story but 
with the nature of the Levite involved. He lived in the 
hill-country of Ephraim (19:1, 29) and he was, during this 
! story, on his way from Bethlehem to his home which was the 
’house of Yahweh’ (19:18). He seems to have been connected 
with Judah originally for it is there that he sought his 
concubine. His present sanctuary-home can not be very

important since the Israelites whom he calls upon for help 
seek the word of Yahweh not at his shrine but at Bethel 
(20:26). It would seem plausible, then, to argue that this 
Levite-priest, originally from Judah, was now serving a 
private or local sanctuary in northern Israel. It might be 
maintained that Bethel had by this time already become the 
sanctuary of the north, but it can be as well maintained 
that the troops went there because it was close to the 
scene of their activity. 

We have seen, now, that Bevites did serve individual 

sanctuaries in this period of numerous local sanctuaries. 

13 

Kittel also holds to this view that the priesthood was 
a heterogeneous lot serving sanctuaries widely scattered 
and not the least co-ordinated. He cites Shiloh as an 
ancient Yahweh sanctuary served by an ancient Levitical 
priesthood. 

However, not all sanctuaries were served by Levites. 
Samuel, himself, was not such a one. I Chr. 6:33,34 makes 
the claim that he was, but a much earlier narrative 
telling of his birth tells another story (I Sam. 1:1-2)>

Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, 
of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was 
Elkanah, the son of ileroham, the son of Elihu, 
the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 

And he had two wives; the name of the one was 
Hannah eind the name of the other was Peninnah; and 
Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 

In Gen. 25:23 the I writer speaks of Rebekah going off 
to consult Yahweh and no mention of a priest is made. But 
we have seen that the characteristic function of the priest¬ 
hood in this early period is giving the oracle of Yahweh 
and it is almost necessary to suppose that she consulted 
Yahweh through such a priest. The regular practice of J is 
to mention that a priest is a Levite if he is so. This 
would suggest that he was not. Even as late as the 
Holiness Code the priests are referred to only as priests 
and never as Levites . This would seem to be evidence 
that priests were not always Levites and we have already 
seen that Levites were not always priests. 

Indeed, there are evidences that the Levites did not 
gain their priestly position as a group v/ithout some con¬ 
siderable opposition and struggle. 

Num. 16:1-7, 16-19, 27b-34 is seen by Cook as such a

piece of evidence, the narrative of the opposition to Moses 
by Korah and his group: 

Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the 
son of Levi, with Dathan and Ahiram, the sons of 
Eliah, and On the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, 
took men; and they rose up in the face of Moses, 
with certain of the children of Israel, two 
hundred and fifty men; they were the princes of 
the congregation, the elect men of the assembly, 
men of renown; and they assembled themselves against 
Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them: *Ye 
take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation 
are holy, every one of them, and Yahweh is among 
them; wherefore then lift ye up yourselves- above 
the assembly of Yahweh? 

So Moses offered to stand them a test which was to be the 
offering of sacrifice and burning of incense before Yahweh. 
The ground opened and swallowed up Korah and his group. 

The sacrifice as it is given must be a later interpolation 
probably along with the later strand which makes the whole 
group Levites (though v. 1 states that only Korah was a 
Levite). The story is not historical but a later 

I 

reminiscence of the difficulty which the Levites had in 
gaining their priestly position. 


Waterman thinks that Ex. 3S is another such reminis¬ 
cence though there is confusion in the chapter It is

the, story of the making of the golden calf by Aaron and the 

denunciation of it and choosing of the Levites by Moses; 

Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said; 
*Whoso is on Yahweh’s side, let him come unto me*. 

And all the sons of i^evi gathered themselves 
together unto him. And he said unto them; *Thus 
saith Yahweh, God of Israel; Put ye every man 
the sword to his thigh, and go to and fro from 
gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every 
man his brother and every man his companion, and 
every man his neighbor. And the sons of Levi did 
according to the word of Moses; and there fell 
of the people that day about three thousand men. 

And Moses said; ’Consecrate yourselves today to 
Yahweh ... that he may also bestow upon you a 
blessing this day.* (Ex. 32;26-29). 

This story is another reminiscence of a difficulty which 
faced the Levites in gaining the priestly guild for them¬ 
selves. Only in this case the antagonist consists of the 
bull-cult of northern Israel. 


There is considerable evidence for the theory that 
the bull-cult of the north and the Yahweh cult of the south 
strove for the upper hand in the religious life of Israel. 
This evidence and the theory is rooted in the duality of 
literature, culture and history which is manifest throughout 
the Old Testament records. It demands some attention at 
this time,' though part of the discussion must necessarily 
be a slight digression from our main subject. 

We have seen that the invasion of Palestine by the 
Hebrews was not a united drive but was accomplished by

separate drives in which there was a general northern 
amphictyony and a general southern one. It is also a 
general southern one. It is also a commonplace now among 
Old Testament scholars that the strands of Fentateuchal 
narrative with extension into Joshua, Judges and probably 
even Samuel and Kings, are largely divisable into northern 
and southern traditions. The northern material, E, and the 
southern material, J, were combined into the one work about 
650 B.G. and since, by this time the northern kingdom had 
fallen and the northern tradition had fallen into the hands 
of the southern editors, we would expect to see that the 
southern material was given the priority in narrative and 
interpretation . This would be even more pronounced in 
the priestly editing of the whole Pentateuch in about the 
fifth century B.C. Under both these sets of editors the 
state god was Yahweh and all possible traces of any other 
worship would be cut out or minimized to the extreme in his 
favor. So any evidence we find will be small and indirect, 
but all the more telling when we realize this editing 
prejudice. 

Every biblical reference which we have locates

bull-worship in the north and never connects it with the 
south. The sanctuary particularly connected with this 
worship is Bethel, furthermore, there are many references 
to Joseph and to Jacob and to Ephraim, all of them northern 
tribes and all of them used to designate the north as 
against the south, as the bull or the sons of the bull 
Gen. 49:22-25 is such a passage. I use the American Tran¬ 
slation for reasons I will explain after the quotation: 

Joseph is a young bull, 

A young bull at a spring, 

A wild-ass at Shur. 

Shooting at him in enmity 
The archers assail him; 

But their bows are broken by the Eternal, 

And their arms and hands trembled. 

At the might of the bull of Jacob, 

At the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel, 

liost translators render the first line, 7Moseph is the son 

of fruitfulness^^ and the second last, ^^At the hands of the 

mighty one of Jacob'' or similar words. But these are not 

as easily unaerstood in their context as one version we 

have chosen and our choice is easily defensible. The word 

rendered ’fruitfulness♦ is ’Porath’ ( 1 d ), the word 

rendered ’Bull’ is ’Parah’ ( Ul 9 )• Without the 

r T 

Masoretic points the similarity is extremely close and 
confusion of this kind often results. The mention of

archers shooting at him is meaningless when applied to a 
fruitfulness but full of meaning when applied to a bull. 

The words rendered ’at the hands of the mighty one’ are 
’Yede Abhir’ ). The word Y^d^’ can mean power 

or might and does mean so in many Old Testament passages 
and the word ’Abhir’ is used only as a synonym for God and 
always of the north. Further, its close relative ’abbir’ 

( 3. y ) is used in a number of cases as a synonym for 

•bull' (cf. Is. 10:13, Ps. 22:13) ^0, Therefore, our 
translation of the passage would seem the better, and as 
translated is a direct testimony to the relationship of the 
north to the bull-cult. The regular method of referring to 
a tribe was as ’the son of’ the God. In this case, what we 
have called ’young bull’ is really ’son of the bull’. If 
the reading ’abhir’ or ’abbir’ be permissably translated 
’bull’ then Psalm 132:2,5 are similar cases: 

How he swore to Yahweh, 

And vowed to the bull of Jacob. 


Until I find a place for Yahweh, 

A dwelling for the bull of Jacob. 

and so is Isaiah 1:24: 

Therefore, this is the oracle of Yahweh, Yapweh 
of hosts, the bull of Jacob. 

Brown-Driver-Briggs, op cit , p. 390 (sec. 2). 
^°. lbld. p. 7.

These are manifestly written in a time when the two trad¬ 
itions had become one, so that Yahweh can be equated with 
the bull of Jacob, but it is nonetheless valuable evidence 
of an earlier existence of two separate traditions. Deut. 
33:17 needs no revising of text or change of ordinary 
meaning of a term to preserve the reference. It is the 
blessing of Joseph: 

His firstling bullock, majesty is his. 

And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox; 

With them he shall gore the peoples all of them, 
even the ends of the earth; 

And they are the ten-thousands of Ephraim, 

And they are the thousands of Ivlanasseh. 

When David conquered the north or annexed it to the 
southern kingdom he brought with him to the north the 
worship of Yahweh to replace bull-worship. This is shown 
by the growing use of Yahweh names through the whole of 
Israel during this period when they had been limited almost 
entirely to the southern part and to Judah in particular 
before this time. But this did not mean that bull-worship 
disappeared. In all probability it did not. Otherwise we 
cannot explain how it reappeared under the reign and 
encouragement of Jeroboam when once again the north and 

south had separated. The story of this separation is told 
in I Ki. 12:28-33; 

Whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves 
of gold; and he said unto them; »ye have gone up

long enough to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, 0 Israel, 
which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt”* 

And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put 
he in Dan. And this thing became a sin; for the 
peonle went to worship before the one, even unto 
Dan. And he made houses of high-places, and made 
priests from among the people, that were not of 
the sons of Levi. And Jeroboam ordained a feast 
in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the 
month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, and 
he went up unto the altar; so did he in Bethel, 
to sacrifice imto the calves which he had made; 
and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high- 
places that he had made. And he went up unto the 
altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth 
day of the eighth month, even the month which he 
had devised in his o^vn heart; and he ordained a 
feast for the children of Israel, and went up unto 
the altar, to offer. 

He made new gods (or as we have said, restored old ones) 
v/ith the implication that the people had forsaken them for 
a time ; he got rid of the Levite priests (which seem not 
to be counted among the Israelite people) and engaged local 
priests; he set up a separate feast day from that celebrated 
in Judah. And all this was centered around the worship of 
the golden“Calf. 


This cult persisted until the reign of Ahab and 
Jezebel under whom a revolt began to organize with the 
leadership of ^ahweh prophets and Jehu, their instrument. 

The revolt finally overthrew Ahab and his wife and re¬ 
established the Yahweh cult. But the bull-worship continued 
under the guise of Yahwism. Undoubtedly the priests of the 
bull-cult (Aaronites as we shall see in a moment) trans-

ferred their allegiance, but not their forms of worship, 

to Yahweh, So the editor of II Kings 10:29ff says: 

Kowbeit from the sins that Jeroboam, son of Nebat, 
made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from them, 
the golden calves that were in Bethel and that 

were in Dan . But Jehu took no heed to 

walk in the law of Yahweh, God of Israel, with 
all his heart; he departed not from the sins of 
Jeroboam, wherewith he made Israel to sin* 


Now, we have shown the existence of the bull-cul'& in 
the north and its rivalry for the worship of the people of 
Israel. V/e may also show that Aaron was the eponym of the 
northern Priesthood as Moses was the eponym of the 
Levitical priesthood which began in the south. 


Aaron never once occurs in the J dociiment of the south 
and he appears in the E document, as it has come to us with 
undoubted editorial marks, in only an inferior relationship' 
to Moses. I'he only place where he appears in his own right 
is in the narrative of the making of the golden calf, in 
Exodus 32. 

"The golden calf is his: he demands the material of 
which it is made: he fashions it: and he presents 
it to the people, and dedicates it. Certainly if 
any of the recorded acts of Aaron be historical, 
the episode of the golden calf can best claim to 
be so donsidered." 21

This would certainly suggest that in the original 
northern document Aaron was the original priest of the bull- 
cult of the north and that the sons of Aaron were the 
legitiroate priesthood of the cult which had its centre at 
Bethel when it became nationalized. It was only as the 
northern document was edited by the southern editors, first 
of the JE compilation and much later of the P edition, that 
Aaron was relegated to a minor place as an assistant to the 
original Bevite, Moses, and most traces of the bull-cult 
were wiped out as best they could. 

As we have said, the rise of David as monarch of the 
whole of Israel also seems to have spread the Levitical 
priesthood as the legitimate priesthood throughout all the 
kingdom. There are hints that Saul had not been so disposecU 
He ordered that the priests be slain when he discovered 
that they were aiding David (I Sam. 28:18) and the city of 
Nob may have been a Levitical stronghold for Abiathar was 
from there and he was a Levite. At any rate David 
advanced Abiathar as far as a priest could be advanced. 

It may be only accident that ‘^eremiah refers to David as 
king and the Levites as priests in the same breath, but it 
may also be because of a casual connection which existed 
in people’s minds as to ths relationship between David and 
the Levites. (Jer. 33:17):

For thus saith Yahweh: There shall not be cut off 
unto David, a man to sit upon the throne of the 
house of Israel; neither shall there be cut off 
unto the priests the Levites a man before me to 
offer burnt-offerings and to do sacrifice 
continually. 

As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, 

Neither the sand of the sea measured; 

So will I multiply the seed of David my servant, 
And the Levites that minister unto me# (33:22). 


At any rate, David did establish the Yahweh priests 
who were in the south the Devites and except for the period 
of the revolt of <^eroboam and the re-establishment of the 
bull-cult in the north, the Levites remained the priests of 
Yahweh at least until the exile, being the sole priests 
during the Deuteronomic period. In the post-exilic period 
they are commonly considered as inferior to the Ladokite or 
Aaronite priests and we shall have to examine the evidence 
in that period when we come to it to see whether this 
traditional view is correct or not# 


We have seen that the i^evites were at first a secular 
tribe; that later they began to become individual priests 
of individual sanctuaries throughout Israel; that they had 
to fight for their position with the priests of other cults, 
notably the Aaronite priests of the northern bull-cult; and 
finally were instituted priests under David and sole priests 
under the Deuteronomic reform. 













- 65 - 


But we have not seen yet just how the transformation 
took place from being a secular tribe to being a priestly 
group, and to this we must devote a page or two before 
leaving the matter of the Levites and continuing with our 
historical survey of the development of the Hebrew priest¬ 
hood. 

It seems probable that their secular defeat is 
recorded at Shechem, or hinted at in the conclusion to that 
incident. The Harmorites recuperated from the blow they 
had received, retaliated against Simeon and Levi and 
dispersed them as a tribe. It is likely that they received 
little or no aid from other Israelite tribes who desired 
to live in peace with the native Canaanite population. 

After this defeat they moved south and allied themselves 
with the tribe of Judah and other southern tribes. At least 
they must have allied themselves with these tribes closely 
enough to borrow their god. Hor the Levites, we know, 
became priests of Yahweh and Yahweh was originally the god 
of the south. Skipworth points out that only the J strand 
of tradition knows Yahweh as God from the beginning. He 
believes this is because Yahweh was always the tribe of 
Judah Budde, on the other hand, maintains that the

Levites got their god ^ahweh from the Kenites at the time 
of the exodus from Egypt under Moses. Rowley thinks both 
Levites and ludahites got Yahweh from the Aenites In 

any case, it is evident that the Levites attached themselves 
to the southern tribes after their dispersion as a secular 
tribe themselves and at that time adopted lahweh as their 

godo 


But how did they succeed in getting themselves accepted 
as priests of a cult to which they had formerly not belonged? 
Meek gives good reasons in contemporary culture for the same 
phenomena elsewhere They are two. first is the 

characteristic belief of primitive peoples that the shamans 
of other tribes are more important than their own tribal 
shamans. In the Old Testament this viev\^ is shown in the 
attitude of Naaman toward Elisha (II Ki. 5) and of Hazael 
toward the same prophet (II Ki. 20:7). Both these instances 
might be written off to Hebrew pride and a bit of tall 
story-telling were it not for the same phenomena found 
elsewhere. Tylor gives many instances of this, a few

will illustrate the point, i'he Malays are a much higher 

race culturally than the Jakuns, but: 

To the Malay, the Jakun seems a supernatural being, 
skilled in divination, sorcery, and facination, able 
to do evil or good according to his pleasure, whose 
blessing will be followed by the most fortunate 
success, and his curse by the most dreadful 
consequences ..... 27 

Others closer home are the fear the white man has for the 
potency of the magic of the natives of the West Indies and 
Africa, as well as the respect for the powers of the 

i 

Gypsies in fortune-telling, and the Scottish opinion that a 
popish priest can cast out devils and cure madness and the 
Presbyterian clergy have no such power. 

The secpnd is that mantic power is widely associated 
with snakes and snake cult priests or shamans. In Hebrew 
the word for serpent { lu j] J ) differs from the word for 

T T 

divination { li) nj ) only in the pointing. And we have seen 

“ T 

that Levi was a serpent-worshipping tribe. Even when the 
Levites adopted Yahweh as their god they did not entirely 
forsake their serpent-god and that motif crept into the 
Jerusalem cult from time to time (cf. I Ki. 1:9 and II Ki. 
18:4). 

There are, however, some inscriptions in South Arabia

at a place called El-Ola, which suggest that a group of 

priests named Levites also filtered into that area and 

became the priests of the native tribe, adopting their god. 

Three which G-ray cites are: 

”{dedi(cated to V/add the »lawi».” 

^he entrusted to Wadd and .... ’Abdia and all that 
he possessed .the two ’lawis’.’’ 

"his (lawi) at Salman daughter of his lawi’at Adat 
..* he possesses Wadd..." 

These are dated variously as anywhere from 1500 to 700 B.C. 

If dated early enough this term would be contemporary with 

the Hebrew usage of the same term. It is very possible 

that some of the Levites went that far south and became 

priests of the god Wadd just as those who adhered to the 

southern Hebrew tribes became priests to the god Yahweh. 

Certainly we know that the Minaean tribe in the Orient 

became priests to more than one other tribe so we see that 

it is not an impossible situation. 

It is probable that as the tribe of Levi became more 
and more accepted as the priestly caste of the Hebrews 
other earlier individual priests and priestly families 
(such as Samuel and perhaps Zadok, and Aaron) were taken

into their group and assimilated. This is why it is 
possible in Deuteronomic tribes for the Levites to be named 
the sole priestly group without too much opposition.• 

We may now leave the question of the i^evites and their 
rise to priestly preeminence, and return to our discussion 
of the development of the priesthood in general through the 
various historical periods. ’We had finished through the 
period of settlement and of numerous sanctuaries. Our next 
historical period is that of the early kings and the 
monarchy both consolidated and separated. To this period

THa PERIOD OP THE MONARCHY 














Chapter V 

THE PERIOD OF THE MONARCHY 

vVe ha-ve seen that the last great judge of the Hebrew 
people was priest, seer and prophet, all functions connected 
with the cult. Vi/e have noted in the nomadic period that the 
shaman or priest was probably considered the one best able 
to lead the tribe or clan and so the offices of tribal 
leader and priest were often synonymous in that period tooo 
^^ow we have to consider the period of the kings of Israel, 
and Judah, a period when the priesthood is well established 
and when the Levites are gaining ascendancy in it. 

The first king of the Hebrews was Saul. Lods thinks 

that he, too, was attached to a sanctuary when he was 

sailed to the leadership of Israel by Samuel Certainly 

the aetiology of the story of the birth of Samuel indicates 

that it should be referred rather to the birth of Saul. 

And it came to pass when the time was come about 
that Hannah conceived, and bore a son; and she 
called his name Samuel: ’because I have asked him 
of Yahweh’. (I Sam. 1:20) 

The word ’asked’ is in Hebrew ’sh®iltiw’ ( 7* which 

Is from the same root as ’Saul’ ( S ^ x /J ). The usual

pattern of these aetiological stories is for the reason for 
the giving of the name to he a direct pun upon the name 
itself and this would be true only if the name of the child 
were Saul* Therefore the birth story should probably refer 
to Saul instead of Samuel and it is Saul who is then 

p 

dedicated to the service of the sanctuary . 

It is interesting to note that both Saul and David 
v^ere anointed to their office. Anointing was a religious 
practice. In the story of Jacob’s dream and belief that 
God was present in the place, he arose in the morning and 
took the stone which had been his pillow, and when he had 
set it upright, he poured oil upon it to indicate its 
sacred nature (Gen. 28:16-19). The verb ( 7i ti ) and the 
noun ( V" k)^) of anointing are used only of kings and in 
the post-exilic period of high-priests David (I Sam. 
16:3), Saul (I Sam. 10:1), Solomon (I Ki. 1:39), Absalom 
(II Sam. 19:10), Joash (II Ki. 11:12), Jehoahaz (I Ki. 23:30) 
and Jehu (II Ki. 9:3) are all definitely mentioned as 
having been anointed to their royal positions. iind..Hosea’s

condemnation (Hos. 7:3);

indicates that it was a regular practice. 

We know that there were priest-kings in the Semitic 
world at this time and earlier. Hooke points out ^ that 
in the various city-states of Mesopotamia (ca. 2000 B.C.), 
the general ritual pattern of all festivals centred around 
the sacred person of a ruler, a priest-king, or divine king, 
upon whom the fortunes of the state depended. Vve see the 
same indication in Phoenicia where Tahnit and his father 
Echumenazer, kings of Sidon, were priests of Astarte. And 
Genesis 14:18-20 has preserved the memory of a king 
Melchizadek, king of Shalem (perhaps cognate with 
Jerusalem) who was at the same time priest of the god El 
Elyon . We see it carried on in the practice of the 
Hebrew kings. David wore the linen ephod, a distinctly 
priestly garb, when he danced before the ark on the way to

Jerusalem (II Sam. 6:14). Solomon conducted the sacrifices 
and pronounced the "benediction on the people at the 
inauguration and dedication of his temple in Jerusalem 
(I Ki. 8:54-61). He also ended the priesthood of the 
dynasty of Abiathar and put Zadoh and his sons in its place 
(I Ki. S:26-27, 35). Jeroboam did much the same thing 
(I Ki. 12:31) as well as installing the notorious cult of 
the bull in the northern kingdom. When Ahaz saw an altar 
to his liking in Damascus he ordered its installation in the 
Jerusalem temple and it was done (II Ki. 16:10). I'hese 
among many other such references to kingly power indicate 

that the king in Israel, like the kings in other parts of 

( 

the Semitic Vvorld, was regarded as a sort of high-priest over 
all others. 

During the reign of David the Levites were encouraged 1 
in the priesthood. This evidenced by the favoritism shown 
by David to Abiathar after Saul had massacred all Abiathar’s 
priestly brotherhood and exiled Abiathar himself. But the 
pendulum swung again v/hen Solomon succeeded David and 
banished Abiathar and put Zadok in his place.. This must be 
taken to mean, of course, that Zadok replaced Abiathar in 
the priesthood of the Jerusalem cult but the Levites were 
not ousted from the other sanctuaries in Israel at this 
time. The house of Zadok remained in Jerusalem <lomi ! 












- 74 - 


to the time of the exile. This ww icnow because of the 
regular reference in Ezekiel to the Jerusalem priests as 
’the Sons of Zadok’*^. '-^'he family of Zadok is not Levitical. 
An anonymous prophecy in the time of Eli states that God 
was rejecting the house of Eli and was going to appoint a 
priest who would walk in the ways of Yahweh and serve him 
forever (I Sam. 2;27ff). In I Ki. 2:27 this prophecy is 
understood to apply to the installation of Zadok, which it 
could not do if Zadok were of the house of Eli in the 
Levitical descent# 

However, the Levitical priests were the dominant priest-^ 

hood in this period and the Zadokite priesthood was soon 

written down as Levitical (ef. I Crh. 24:3). And in 

Jeremiah’s time (or later as this passage is probably later 

than Jeremiah himself) the Levitical priesthood is seen to 

exist for all time henceforth; 

Eor thus saith Yahweh: ’There shall not be cut off 
unto David a man to sit upon the throne of the 
house of Israel; neither shall there be cut off 
unto the priests, the Levites, a man before me 
to offer burnt-offerings, and to burn meal-offerings 
and to do sacrifice continually. (Jer. 33:17)# 

We must note again, lest it be forgotten, that when 
Jeroboam reinstituted the bull cult in the north, which 
lasted until the Jehu revolution, he removed the Levitical

priests and put Aaronite priests in their place. These 
Aaronite priests, too, continued even after the Jehu 
revolution, to serve as priests and are another example of 
the way the Levitical priesthood assimilated rival priest¬ 
hoods as they rose to ascendance in the cult. 

Something should he said of the functions of the priests 
in this period. There is nowhere given a list of their 
duties (except in the Priestly code which is a reading back 
into history the functions which attached to the priest¬ 
hood in the post-exilic commyuiity). But there are state¬ 
ments from which legitimate inferences may be made. 

V/e made mention of the function of judging in the 
nomadic period and the period of settlement. This function, 
of course, continued. But it did not retain its strictly 
* judging’ character. Torah , which originally meant decision 
of the oracle now comes to mean teaching and gains a 
much higher ethical and religious content. There is the 
necessity of teaching the people the proper way of approach¬ 
ing the deity. That this is supremely important must be 
the conclusion upon reading the story of the death of Nadab

and Abihu for ♦offering strange fire» to Yahweh in the 
religious ceremonies (Lev, 10), But even more important is 
the ethical connotation that became associated with the 
teaching, '■‘•he denunciations of the priests by the prophets 
who arose to uphold morality suggests that the priests had, 
up to this time, been doing their job of teaching moral 
living fairly welx, or at least that this was a recognized 
part of their work. Hosea is concerned with the moral wel¬ 
fare of the nation and his charge is not that the priests 
have no place in the life of the people, but that they have 
not given the proper attention to what was their correct 
duty: 

My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; 
because thou hast rejected knowledge I will also 
reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me; 
seeing thou hast forgotten the law of God, I aiso 
will forget thy children. (Eos. 4:6). 

Even as late as leremiah and Ezekiel, instruction or 

teaching is recognized as the characteristic function of 

the priest, and it must be in this period that it became 

such. V/hen the people were plotting against Jeremiah in 

the confidence of their own institutions they said: 

Come, let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for 
instruction (Torah) shall not perish from the priest, 
nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the 
prophet. (Jer. 18:18). 

Ezekiel characterizes the three offices in the same way:

Calamity shall coins upoii calamity, and rumour shall 
be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of 
the prophets, and instruction shall perish from 
the priest, and counsel from the elders. (Ez. 7:26). 

Three other minor functions must have had their 
beginning in this period though they do not receive 
articulation until the Deuteronomic period. 

The first is the function of blessing. Deut. 10:8 

describes the function of the priest as threefold: 

At that time Yahweh separated the tribe of Levi, 
to bear the ark of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh 
to minister unto him, and to bless in his name 
to this day. 

The two first ones are early functions as we have seen. The 
last must be at least as early as the period of the monarchy 
For, when David had brought the ark to Jerusalem and carried 
out the appropriate ceremonies, he blessed the people in 
the name of Yahweh (II Sam. 6:17ff). And when Solomon 
dedicated his new temple, he also blessed the people in the 
name of Yahweh before he dismissed them (I Ki. 8:14, 55). 
These are both instances of the priestly prerogative of 
blessing. 

To us this function may seem of minor importance, but 
it was not so to the Hebrew mind. For to the Semitic mind, 
the act of blessing is the act of bestowing the life-power 
Df the blesser upon the blessed. Since the priest

re presented the god, his blessing in the name of the god, 
was a bestowal of the life-power of the god upon the 
people ‘J-Ms makes it of prime importance, perhaps one 
of the most important of the priestly duties* 

"■‘•'he second function referred to is that of preserving 
the traditions and folk-stories of the various sanctuaries, 
either by word of mouth or by some means of recording. 

This function is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in early 
literature. But the fact that the stories were preserved 
and that they group themselves about specific sanctuaries— 
Jacob at Bethel, Abraham at Hebron, Isaac at Beersheba, 
and so on—seems to prove that such a work was carried out 
by someone attached to the sanctuary, and thus most 
naturally the priests 


The third function, a very minor one, is that of over¬ 
seeing the cult prophets which apparently flocked to 
Jerusalem when the Temple was built* Our evidence for this 
is Jeremiah’s letter to the exiles, but we may assume

safely that the same conditions prevailed from the time of 

the building of the temple* (Jer. 29:24-29): 

Because thou hast sent letters in thine own name 
unto all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to 
Zephaniah the son of Masseiah the prophet, and to 
all the priests, saying: Yhhweh hath made thee priest 
in the stead of Jehoiada, the priest, that there 
should be officers in the house of Yahweh for every 
man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that 
thou shouldst put him in the stocks and in the collar. 
Nov; therefore, why hast thou not rebuked Jeremiah 
of Anathoth who maketh himself a prophet unto you? 


Before we leave this period it would be well to draw 

attention to the more menial tasks which would be the 

priest’s in any temple, or large sanctuary. We are apt to 

think of the priests as living off the fat of the land and 

getting rich from the fees paid them, and of doing nothing 

to pay for their position and upkeep. We have seen already 

that they had a definite and important place in the 

community but apart from that, they earned their keep by 

the mechanical and janitorial services they did in keeping 

up the temple and ±zs service for the use of the people. 

I quote Oesterley and Robinson to close this chapter of 

our study on a very mundane and practical note: 

The sanctuary itself needs attention, i'he altar 
must be constantly -cended, its fires must be kept 
alight, and the portions reserved for the exclusive

use of the god must he burned. It is true that 
the actual slaughter of the victim was carried 
out by the worshipper himself, except when the 
sacrifice was offered on behalf of the community 
as a whole, but the presentation of the blood and 
the fat was probably performed only by duly 
qualified persons. Moreover, animal sacrifice 
is a disgusting thing, and it was necessary that 
something be done about keeping the premises 
fairly clean, v/hile the ashes of the altar itself 
had to be removed at frequent intervals if the 
fire was not to be choked out by them. 









Chapter VI 


THE DEUTERONOMIC PERIOD 








Chapter VI 

TES DEUTERONOLiIC PERIOD 

'^he Deuteronomic Law, largely contained in the present 
Book of Deuteronomy, 5-26 (perhaps more precisely 12-26 ^), 
represents a real milestone on the history of the develop¬ 
ment of the Hebrew priesthood. For it is the first con¬ 
temporary legal material we have which deals with the 
position and function of the priesthood. As we saw in the 
last chapter this book undoubtedly reflects in some matters 
the status of the priest in the preceding period. But, 
since its law is built around the one main idea of the 
centralization of worship in Jerusalem at the Tem.ple, and 
the destruction of the rural shrines and high-places, the 
majority of its enactments deal with the priesthood in the 
period when this reformation was carried out, or at least 
partially carried out. 

Up to this time the priestly duties have not been 
limited to any particular group of people, though we have 
noted that the Levites have been gaining ground and are 
definitely favored under the rule of David. This 
partiality was checked slightly when Solomon instituted

the Zadokite regime in Jerusalem, but now, with the law of 
the Deuteronomic Code, the Levites are again in a favored, 
indeed in a monopolistic position. Throughout Deuteronomy 
the terms ♦priest’ and ’Levite* are synonymous. There is 
no indication of any other group of people, or individuals, 
acting in the capacity of priests. It is on the basis of 

p 

this fact that Baudissin believes that though Hilkiah, 
chief priest in Jerusalem under Josiah, may have found the 
book and brought it to the attention of the king, as 
recorded in II kings 8:22ff, he had nothing to do with its 
origin. For Hilkiah was a Zadokite and he v/ould not have 
sanctioned the competition of the non-Jerusalem Levites to 
his own group already entrenched in the Jerusalem cultus. 

It is possible, though not probable, that.the Zadokites 
were already at this time considered as part of the 
Levitical priesthood. I say ’not probable’ because 
Ezekiel’s restoration some time after this time retains a 
real distinction between Zadokite and Levite priests. 
However, whatever may be the reason for the lack of mention 
of Zadokite priests in Deuteronomy, no one can deny the 
identification of the priests always with the Levites. 

At that time Yahweh separated the tribe of Levi to 

bear the ark of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to

minister unto him, and to bless in his name unto 
this day. (Deut* 10:8). 

Did I not choose him (Eli’s household) out of all 
the tribes of Israel to be my priest,, to go up 
unto mine altar, to burn incense, to wear and 
ephod before me? (I Sam. 2:28, part of the Deut- 
eronomic editing of the historical books). 

Deuteronomy 17:9, 18, 24:8, 27:9, 21:5, 31:9 and others 

are illustrations of the use of the phrase ’the priests, 

the Levites’. It seems also a logical conclusion from 

Deut. 18:6-8 that the fact of being a Levite means that 

the priestly function i^a open to the individual, regardless 

of v;hat the immediately former residence or occupation may 

have been: 

And if a Levite comes from any of thy gates out 
of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with 
the desire of his soul unto the place which Yahweh 
shall choose; then he shall minister in the name of 
Yahweh his God, as all his brethren the Levites do 
who stand before Yahweh. They shall have like 
portions to eat, beside that which is his due 
according to his father’s houses.^ 

Only twice are the priests mentioned in Deuteronomy without 

being described as Levites, or sons of Devi. But in view 

of the overwhelming usage on the other side, it would seem 

that these are instances where we should supply the 


^ This passage also suggests that the Zadokites were 
considered as Levites by the writer, since the phrase 
’his brethren the Levites’ should refer to his brother- 
priests already serving in Jerusalem, who were pre¬ 
dominantly Zadokite.

missing word or phrase 

Furthermore, duties elsewhere in the Old Testament 
clearly defined as priestly are in D attributed to the 
Levites. They are to bear the ark (Num. 3:31, 4;15, 

Dt. 31:9, Josh. 8:33) but in I Kings 8:3-6 this is the 
priest’s duty; they are to stand before Yanwen oo minister 
to him (we have seen this the earliest duty of the 
primitive priests) and they are to bless in his name (as 
David and Solomon had done). This seems to indicate, as 
the rest of our evidence does, that the Levites are now 
sole priests. 

The transformation from secular tribe, as we saw the 

Levites in Chapter lY, to priestly tribe, as we see them 

in D, is illustr8.ted best by the two poetic passages 

blessing (or cursing) the tribes of Israel; 

Simeon and Levi are brethren. 

Weapons of violence their kinship 


Cursed be their anger for it was fierce. 
And their v/rath, for it was cruel; 

I will divide them in Jacob, 

And scatter them in Israel. (G-en. 49:5,7)

Yifelch, op cit , p. 92. Welch thinks, however, that these 
priestly duties and rights are older than the Deut- 
eronomic reform, being a part of the code not stressing 
centralization, p. 99.

And of Aevi hs said: 

Thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, 

Whom thou didst prove at Massah, 

With whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah; 


They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, 

And Israel thy law; 

They shall put incense before thee, 

And v/hole burnt-offering upon thine altar, 

Bless , Yahweh, his substance, 

And accept the work of his hands; 

Smite through the loins of them that rise up against 
him 

And of them that hate him, that they rise not again. 

(Deut. 53:8, 11). 


Likewise, the sacrificial function which was before 

performed by almost anyone (not even a priest was necessary, 

though the trend toward his participation in the rite was 

probably begun before this) is now in the hands of the 

priests at Jerusalem We see this in the passage just 

cited. V/e see it also in Deut. 26:3: 

Thou Shalt take of the first-fruit of the ground, — 

-- and thou shalt put it in a basket and shalt go 

unto the place where Yahweh thy God shall choose 
to cause his name to dwell there, ^nd thou shalt 
come unto the priests that shall be in those days 

--— and the priest shall take the basket out 

of thy hand, and set it dovm before the altar of 
Yahweh, thy God. 

There are no elaborate directions given in the Deuteronomic 

Law as there were later in the Levitical Law for the exact 

requirements in perfoiming the sacrificial ceremonies, but 

^ The word ’priests* used in this chapter will naturally 
refer to the priests, the Levites, since for the writer, 
or writers, of D there were no others.

we may safely assume that there were set rituals for the 
occasion. 

Certainly we see that the temple service was becoming 
more elaborate and with this elaboration went a multipli¬ 
cation of the duties of the priests* In connection with the 
offerings and sacrifices there were ritual litanies to be 
repeated by the offerer and heard by the priest and we may 
infer that the priests had first to teach these litanies to 
the people, along with the proper way to approach the deity* 
One of these litanies is given in Deut. 26:5-11* Another 
litany, not in connection with sacrifice, was led by the 
priest in the Temple and all the peonle were to respond 
*Amen’. One such, made up of a series of curses upon those 
who disobeyed the law of God is given in Deut* 27:14-26* 

The law had to be read periodically in the hearing of all 
the people (Deut* 3i:9ff)* Apparently there was a sort of 
ritual to be performed in the presence of the army before 
it went out to do battle (Deut* 20:2): 

And it shall be, when ye draw nigh unto the battle, 
that the priest shall approach and speak unto the 
people and shall say unto them: Hear 0 Israel, ye 
draw nigh this day unto battle against your enemies; 
Let not your heart be faint, fear not, nor be 
alarmed, neither be ye affrighted at them; for 
Yahweh your God is he that goeth with you, to 
fight for you against your enemies to save you. 

There were also certain other ritual duties which took the

priest away from the Temple. If anyone had been murdered 
and the murderer was unknown so that he could not be 
punished,and his life taken as an expiation for the crime 
and the sin against God, the elders of the city nearest the 
scene of the crime were to lead a heifer which had never 
been in harness dov/n into a valley which had never been 
ploughed or sown, and were to break the heifer’s neck in 
that valley. Then the priests, presumably from the Temple^, 
are to come near and supervise the ceremony of ritual 
expiation wherein the elders wash their hands over the 
heifer. 

We can see that ritual is becoming more and more 
important in the work of the priests, and this is what we 
should expect with the cultus of the one central temple 
having become the focus of the worship of .the whole nation* 

The function of judging still belongs to the priests 
in this period. However, the two great streams ^of legal 
jurisdiction have been fused by the writer of this law. 
Judging has belonged to the priest at his sacred object 

^ Though Baudissin thinks this is evidence of the 

continuing activity of recognized priests outside of the 
central sanctuary in Jerusalem, op cit , p. 75.

almost from the very beginning of his existence. But the 

Hebrew people also had a tradition of courts of elders who 

judged disputes within each city. V/e meet this group in 

Old Testament literature often. Morgenstern has given a 

brief survey of their rise and development in the near 

east It is not our place here to discuss this, but we 

must recognize that such secular courts did exist and 

developed alongside of the priestly function of judging. 

If there arise a matter too hard for thee in 
judgement, between blood and blood, between plea 
and plea, and between stroke and stroke, even 
matters of controversy within thy gates; then 
thou Shalt arise, and get thee up unto the place 
which Yahweh God shall choose. And thou shalt 
come unto the priests the Levites, and unto ttie 
judge that shall be in those days; and thou shalt 
enquire, and they shall declare unto thee the 
sentence of judgement. (Deut. 17:8ff)* 

The secular and priestly judges are here together and 

apparently meet in the Temple (as the phrase ♦where Yahweh 

God shall choose* usually means) to decide the cases which 

were brought to them. 


However, their connection with the Law is not merely 
that of judging. They have also to preserve the lav/ as it 
has been handed down to them, (Deut. 31:24f):

Mo ses cornmanded the Levites, that tore the ark of 
the covenant of Yahweh, saying: Take this book of 
the law, and put it by the side of the ark of 
Yahweh your Gk)d, that it may be there as a witness. 

and Deut. 17:18: 

And it shall be when the king sitteth upon the 
throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him 
a copy of this law in a book, out of that which 
is before the priests the Levites. 

They must also teach the law to the people: 

They shall teach Jacob thine ordinances, 

And Israel thy law. (Deut. 33:10). 


Still another function that becoiiBs apparent for the 
first time in this period is that of diagnosing leprosy 
and giving instructions as to its treatment and the ritual 
necessary to cleanse oneself from its uncleanness. Deut. 
24:8 warns the people to observe carefully all the 
instructions the priests might give in case of a plague of 
leprosy and to obey these instructions corapletely. 

Leviticus 13 shows the priests as diagnosticians of the 
disease. Although this is a later document it is probably 
a reminiscence of a function attaching to the priesthood at 
least as early as this Deuteronomic priesthood, for it the 
directions of the priests were so important in the event of 
a plague, it is likely that the priests were considered the 
repository to some extent of medical lore as well as of the 
law

Though the Law Book of Deuteronomy provided that all 
Levitical priests whithersoever they might come should find 
acceptance in the new central sanctuary on equal terms with 
the priests even then in the Temple service, this was not 
carried out quite so meticulously as was written. 

According to the narrative of II Kings 23, losiah 
distinguished between three classes of priests. The 
kemarim ( Q\.l o ) he deposed altogether. In harmony with 

‘ T ; 

usage elsewhere in the Old Testament we must conclude that 
these were the priests of foreign cults and the worship 
of other gods than Yahweh. The kohanin { O ' J T1 T) ) were 
assembled by him, but he did not permit the priests of the 
various high-places throughout the land to serve the altar 
of the Temple, though they were allowed to eat mazzoth 
bread with the other priests (23:9). Seemingly, he divided 
thus betv/een the priests of Jerusalem and the priests who 
had served the high-places in the rest of the land. 

Although this maj^ be anticipation of a later chapter, 
there seems to be some confirmation for this separation in 
the views of Ezekiel on the subject. He gives the 
Zadokite priests (Jerusalem priests) the first place in his 
suggested restoration of Israel and subordinates the 
Levitical priests and in 44:10ff he gives his reason for 
this: '

But the Levites that went astray from me when 
Israel went astray, that went afar from me after 
their idols, they shall hear their iniquity; and 
they shall he ministers in my sanctuary, having 

charge at the gates of the house . 

. and they shall not come near unto me 

to minister unto me in the priest’s office . 

Ezekiel is putting into his vision of future things that 
separation which was already taking place in the reform¬ 
ation under losiah. 

There are other indications of rank within the priest¬ 
hood of the temple, hut whether these further divisions 
denote superiority rather than just division of function 
cannot he known from present information, 

Jer. 19:1 refers to ’elders* of the priests’ along with 
’elders of the people’. It may he that this class of 
priests held some elected or appointed office similar in 
relationship to the ordinary priests with the relationship 
between elders of the people and ordinary citizens. 

Jer. 20:1 refers to ’Pashhur, the son of Immer the 
priest, who was chief officer in the house of Tahweh’. He 
had Jeremiah put in stocks when he heard him prophesying. 
This position would seem to correspond to the rank of priest 
to which Jeremiah refers in his letter to the Exiles, 

Jer* 29:26: 













-92- 

Yahweh hath mde thee priest in the stead of 
Jehoiada the priest, that there should be officers 
in the house of Yahweh for every man that is mad, 
and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest 
put him in the stocks and in the collar. 

Jer. 35:4. refers to ’the keeper of the door’., seemingly 
as an office of at least one member of the temple priest¬ 
hood. More of these same officers are referred to in 52:24 

q 

along with a chief priest and a second priest 

And the captain of the guard took Seriah, the 
chief priest, and ZephaniaJi, the second priest, 
and the three keepers of the door. 

t 

Furthermore, ths fact, that there were several different' 
ranks among the priesthood that came back from exile with 
Zerubbabel would seem to indicate that they must have been 
part of the priesthood of the pre-exilic temple, for there 
would be no opportunity or necessity for the origin of such 
ranks in the worship system in Babylon. 

The priests of the temple v;ere not left without any 
means of livelihood. Their quarters would be provided in 
the temple as many passages indicate (Deut. 35:4ff and 
others). They were allowed to own land though they could 
not neglect their calling of the priesthood (Deut. 18:8, 


9 

We shall have occasion to be speaking about the 
Morgenstern theory of the anointing of two priests 
when we deal with the origin of the High-Priesthood 
at a' later point in this paper.

10:9)* i'br their services they received some of 
the choicest parts of the animals of sacrifice: the 
shoulder, cheek and maw of all cattle and sheep (18:3), 
the best of the corn and oil (15:19) and the best of the 
wool for their clothing (18:4). They were not allowed the 
best fruits of the trees, however (26:2,4) 


Cornill points out that the emphasis in this 
period is no longer on making known the will of Yahweh or 
teaching that will in simple oracles to the people, but is 
on the codified law and the ritual prescriptions of the 
temple service. The whole cultus seems to be more and more 
an institution for propitiating sins and the priests 
mediators through whom the propitiation may become 
effective• 

"Deuteronomy substituted for the living revelation 
of God in human heart and in history, the dead 
letter. For the first time a book was made the 
foundation of religion, religion a statute, a lav/. 

He who followed what was written in the book was 
religious and he alone." 

This is certainly the view which the Deuteronomic editors

of the books of the history of the Hebrews up to that time 
book in their editing work (Judges, Joshua, I and II Samuel, 
I and II Kings). And it is interesting that this should be 
the pronouncement upon the achievements of the priests by 
a writer on the prophets of Israel, y/hat he says is 
largely true and the progress of the priesthood followed 
the lead of this formuiaLea rexj.gious life. But we must 
remember that even Jererciah seems to have given his support 
to the Deuteronomic reform for a time and it may well be 
that the priests who backed the reform were just as 
reluctant to see the religious life go the way it did go in 
spite of their reform of the religious life of the nation. 
Hot all was ritual and cold lav/. The priests still taught 
the people, they still judged the cases of the people, and 
they still mediated the will of Yahweh to the people, 
albeit in a more formal and less direct way than in 
previous days.

Chapter 7II 



TH3 PERIOD OF THE EXILE 













Chapter VII 


THE PERIOD OP THE EXILE 

For this period our direct sources are practically 
non-existent and our indirect sources very meagre. The 
material we have is divided into three parts as it pertains 
to the three distinct locales into which the people of 
Israel were themselves divided. There is that which gives 
us information about the priesthood as it continued to 
exist and serve in the homeland of Palestine even after the 
deportations of 597 and 586 B.C.; there is that which 
touches on the priesthood and its activities and organizatior. 
in the captivity of Babylon; there is the third field of 
literature which projects itself into the future and deals 
with an ethereal restoration of the nation under a priestly 
hierocracy governed directly by Yahweh. Tlie first two 
sources must be drawn out of their hiding places where 
they nestle unsuspected in writings which deal with other 
subjects and times. The last is contained almost entirely 
in the Book of Ezekiel though there are the barest hints in 
the work of the Second Isaiah. Since it is a unified work 
and is concerned with an ideal place and time and is 
extremely important for an understanding of the history of 
the priesthood and of the priestly frame of mind, we will

deal with it in the next chapter devoted only to it. The 
other two will occupy us in this chapter. 

Until fairly recently it has been the consensus of 
accepted scholarly opinion in this field that the downfall 
of cTerusalem and the captivity of the southern kingdom by 
the Babylonians in 597 and 586 B.C. left the homeland of 
Palestine utterly desolate and v/ithout any of the elements 
of their former life. Indeed, Baudissin, in his article 
on the Priests and Levites skips directly from the 
priesthood under losiah to the priesthood as envisioned by 
Ezekiel, without even a remark as to the state of the people 
or of the worship in Palestine in the interval. 

Though anything further than this is conjecture, we 
can know for certain that worship did not cease in either 
north Israel or Judah at the time of their respective 
desolations and deportations. Meek thinks what happened 
jwas something like this the captivity of Judah left 
very few of the priests of Jerusalem (Zadokites) in the 
land, and such as v/ere left were fugitives. For the time 
being there was nothing for them to do, and the most

dangerous place for them to be was, at the temple in 
Jerusalem. 3o.they would naturally migrate to the nearest 
priesthood still functioning, v/hich was the Aaronite 
priesthood in the northern kingdom at Bethel. Y/hen 
conditions became more stable and less dangerous for the 
priests in the south, the priests naturally moved to the 
Temple in Jerusalem. For Jerusalem had grown steadily in 
importance during the time since its establishment as a 
royal shrine, and even when it was in iniins it would remain 
the chief sanctuary of the land The people of Jerusalem 
needed priestly leadership and the Deuteronomic legislation 
gave the Aaronites as much right in Jerusalem as any others 
(Deut. 18:6-8). So under them and the sprinkling of 
Zadokites that had joined them, and of country Levites who 
had not served the hi^-places of foreign deities, the 
Temple cultus in Jerusalem was re-established* 

Morgenstern reconstructs the history of the priest¬ 
hood at this time in somewhat the same way i/Vhen the 
Zadokites were exiled to Babylonia, the Levitioal priests 
who had been allowed to come into Jerusalem from the

country skrines, but were relegated to a subordinate 
position in the Temple service, were left in virtual charge 
of what was left of the Temple ana ±os services. They 
continued the temple routine even though the temple was in 
ruins. 


Whether the reconstructions of the priestly history 

of this period in Palestine are correct or not, we do know 

ttiat v/orship continued. In Jeremiah 41:4ff we read: 

And it came to pass the second day after he had 
slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, that there 
came certain men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and 
fromSai];iaria, even fourscore men, having their 
beards shaven and their clothes rent and having 
cut themselves, with meal-offerings and frankin¬ 
cense in their hand, to bring them to the house 
of Yahweh. 

This was some time after the Temple had been destroyed and 

R 

yet the services seem to be carried on as usual * 
Zechariah 7:1, also later than the desti*uction of the 
Temple, tells of a delegation of'Bethel elders who came to 


Morgenstern and Cornill both think that this festival 
to which the men were coming must have been the annual 
Sukkoth festival. Cornill has difficulty in so 
believing because this is the third of the month and 
the Sukkoth festival (acc. to P) was f3x>igL the 15th 
to the £2nd of the month. Morgenstern has shown the 
Sukkoth festival to have been celebrated under the 
earliest calendar from the 3rd to the 9th of the 
month and so fits his theory in. cf. Morgenstern, J., 
”Two Ancient Israelite Agricultural Festivals^^ Jewish 
Quarterly Review , Yol. 8, pp. 45ff, and "Three 

Calendars of Ancient Israel”, Hebrew Union College 
Annual . vol. 1, pp. 13-78. -—- —

inquire of th.e ’priests of the house of Yahweh’, indicating 

that the priesthood was still Jmown to be functioning 

normally. When the Temple was being rebuilt in Jerusalem 

after the Exile, certain men described as the adversaries 

of Judah and Benjamin (Ezra 4:lff) came to Zerubbabel and 

offered to' help with the building: 

then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the 
heads of the father’s houses, and said unto 
them: ’Let us build v/ith you; for v/e seek your 
God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since 
the days of Ssarhaddon, king of Assyria, who 
brought us up hither. 

These were part of the ’people of the land’ brought in by 
Assyria after the defeat of the northern kingdom, probably 
living in the north, and, at any rate, apparently worshipping 
at the Temple ruins during the Exilic period in Palestine* 

0 

Welch gives a very convincing argument for believing 
that Nehemiah 10:1a, £9-40, is a pact between the northern 
Israelites who had separated themselves from the ?people 
of the land’ and the Judeans who were left in Judah during 
the exile. The pact, he says, was aimed at keeping the 
race and the worship pure (but note Ezra 4:Iff), at raising 
the necessary taxes and supplies to keep the Temple

operating (since it had before then been supported from 
the royal treasury), and at maintaining the old forms of 
worship. If this be so, then it is further evidence to 
show that the priesthood continued to function in 
Jerusalem on the site of the Temple (cf. Neh. 10:40b-- 
”we will not forsake the house of our 0-od”), 

V/e owe much more to the priesthood in Palestine in 
this period than has generally been acknowledged. The 
fusing of the priesthoods of the north and the south, which 
had been nominal heretofore was now actual. Many of the 
traditions and laws and writings of the northern cultus and 
people were brought into contact with those of the south for 
the first time. Although Pfeiffer and some others place 
the date of the combining of J .and E sources into one 
narrative at about 650 B.C., Meek contends with some force 
that it was during this exilic period that tiie two 
documents were fused into one with the emphasis on the 
Judaean point of view since they were fused at the southern 
shrine. At any rate, many traditions, and perhaps actual 
documents, which would have been lost in the exile or, if 
saved by the captives, colored by the Babylonian influences,

were preserved for us by the priesthood of the Jerusalera 
temple which continued to function during this period. 

When we turn to the priesthood in Exile we have 
practically no source material whatsoever, except that 
provided in Ezekiel which is to be the subject of the next 
chapter, ‘^‘here were priests in the captivity. In neither 
account of either deportation is there express mention of 
the priests among the captives (II Kings 24-25, II Chron. 
26). But II Kings 25:18ff tells of the captivity of the 
chief priest, the second priest, and the three keepers of 
the door of the temple, and we may safely assume that when 
the vessels of the temple were all taken, and everything 
about the temple destroj^ed, the priests would not be left 
in its sex*vice, furthermore, we have the letter of 
Jeremiah to the exiles in which he addresses the priests as 
well as the others (Jeremiah 29), and Ezra and Nehemiah 
portray the return of the exile under Zerubbabel as 
including priests of all ranks and numbers. 

But as to the activity of the priests in Babylon v/e 
are left entirely to almost unfounded conjecture. We will 
see, in the next chapter, that certain elements of the 
book of Ezekiel reflect conditions of the priesthood in 
exile; but they just reflect, they do not deal with those

conditions or state them outright. 

'One thing, however, that must he said about the priest¬ 
hood in Exile in Babylon is that the Babylonian ritual 
patterns, priestly organization, and mythology in the cult, 
had a tremendous Influence on the Hebrew priesthood, and 
this influence is attested in every realm of the priestly 
Code which is our source for the Post-Exilic priesthood. 

I\aor gens tern has sho^Am ^ that the whole calendar 
system was changed, first from the Canaanite solar calendar 
to the Babylonian numerical calendar which was of a luni- 
solar nature, then to the Babylonian named calendar which 
was almost entirely lunar in character, and that many of the 
feasts of the Hebrew cult were changed in date to conform 
to these nev; calendars and in nature because of the 
influence of the Babylonian festivals upon them. The first 
change came during the exile, the second change much later 
but as a result of the exilic Babylonian influence. 

The Priestly account of creation and of the flood and 
so on, definitely reflect the influence of the same myths 
in Babylonian thought. Pfeiffer does not concede this

influence but does admit that P derived many ideas from 
Second Isaiah, who all scholars are agreed was very greatly 
influenced by Babylonian thought. 

On the festivals of the Jews, especially the New Year 
festival, the ritual pattern of the Babylonians had 
tremendous effect . 

The organization of the priesthood itself which in the 
immediate post-exilic period produced a high-priest, must 
have felt the' impact of Babylonian priestly organization. 

So, though the activities of the priests and their 
functions in exile are not known, the period was very 
important for later developments in the Hebrew priesthood*

Chapter 7111 


EZEKIEL»S RESTORATION 







Chapter VIII 


EZEKIEL’S RESTORATION 

Tv/o distinctions are made very clear in the writing of 
Ezekiel. First, the division between laity and clergy is 
drawn distinctly. None but the clergy may enter the inner 
court of the temple. This may have been implied in the 
Deuteronomic period but it is not stated explicitly. 
Furthermore, as we shall see later in this chapter, very 
special holiness was required of the priests and the lack 
of this holiness made the distinction much more figid. 
Second, the distinction between the Zadokite priests (in 
Ezekiel, considered as ’the priests’) and the Levites is 
stated in fact and function. .Yahweh has rejected the 
services of all Levite priests except those who are ’sons 
of Zadok’. The others have been degraded to the status of 
Temple servants. They are still,'however, the concern of 
the cultus and provision is to be made for their upkeep 

All this is, of course, Ezekiel’s reconstruction of 
the future priestly hierarchy, and it never can be taken as 
representing an actual period of Hebrew history. This must 
be kept in mind throughout this chapter.

In Ezekiel 40:46 we read: 

. and the other chamber, lacing north, is for 

the priests who have charge of the altar, that is, 
for the sons of Zadok who alone among the sons of 
Levi may approach Yahweh and minister unto himo 

This viewpoint is repeated in 43:19, 48:11, 44:15 and other 

passages in the book. In 48:1£, 13, 2£, provision is made 

for the upkeep of these aegraaea Levites by the setting 

aside ^in perpetuum* of an area of land which is to provide 

income for them. The explanation for Ezekiel’s 

repudiation of pre-Exilic conditions (for such a repudiation 

is implicit in his careful exclusion of the Levites from 

the inner cultus) is given in 44:10-16: 

But the Levites that went afar from me, when Israel 
went astray, that went astray after their idols, 
they shall bear their iniquities; and they shall 
be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at the 
gates of the house, and ministering in the house; 
they shall slay the burnt-offering, and the sacrifice 
for the people, and they shall stand before me to 
minister unto them. Because they ministered unto 
them before their idols, and became a stumbling- 
block of iniquity unto the house of Israel; there¬ 
fore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith 
Yahv/eh God, and they shall bear their Iniquity* 

And they shall not come near unto me to minister 
unto me in the priest’s office, nor to come near 
to any of my holy things, unto the things that are 
most holy; but they shall bear their shame, and their 
abominations which they have committed. And I will 
make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all 
the service thereof, and for all that shall be done 
therein. But the priests, the Levites, the sons 
of Zadok, that kept the charge in my sanctuary, when 
the children of Israel went astray from me, they 
shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they 
shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and

th© blood, saith Yahweh God; they shall enter into 
my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my holy 
table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my 
charge. 

It is quite clear that Ezekiel is not repudiating a Levitical 
priesthood, but is simply narrowing the priesthood within 
the Levites to only those of the Jerusalem Zadokite family® 
He justifies this with the assertion that only the Zadokite 
priesthood remained faithful to Yahweh, all other priests 
having led the_ people astray. There are two questions of 
historical fact in these two basic presuppositions or 
polemics of Ezekiel. The first is whether or not the 
Zadokites were Levites at all. We have taken the stand in 
a former chapter that the Zadokites were an independent 
group of priests who were absorbed into the Levitical 
priesthood when it was rising to power in the early mon¬ 
archical period. At that time they were considered Lev¬ 
itical to all iijtents and purposes because all priests were 
supposed to be Levitical. The second is whether the 
Levites did serve foreign idols and shrines and lead the 
people away from the worship of Yahweh. The evidence does 
not point to this as a characteristic movement among the 

Levites; there were bound to be a few who would do so* 

For that matter, even if they had done so that was not the 
responsibility of the Levites in Ezekiel’s own time* 
Wellhausen v/axes quite bitter on this point, asking what 







- 107 - 


kind of justice it is that allows a prophet (?) of a God 
of justice to condemn an entire group to degradation be¬ 
cause of something that some of their fathers may have done 
in a generation now past (and especially a prophet of 
individual responsibility) I think the explanation is 

rather this: that Ezekiel looked back on the Deuteronomic 
Reform and found it good, and that he himself probably came 
from a Zadokite family and inherited from his father an 
antagonism against the Levitical priests outside Jerusalem 
that arose out of a pre-exilic struggle for power between 
them. 

The emphasis in priestly function in Ezekiel is on 
sacrifice. 40:38-46, 43:20-27, 44:15-17, 44:27-28, 45: 
18-24, 46:2ff, 46:20-24 all deal specifically v/ith this 
function and many other passages are based upon it. Like¬ 
wise is there 8Ji emphasis on the keeping of festivals and 
of teaching the difference between clean and unclean. Even 
the function of judging which has attached to the priests 
from the beginning is here connected directly with ritual 
and festival. 

And they shall teach my people the difference 

between the holy and the common, and cause them to

discern between the unclean and the clean. And 
in a controversy they shall stand to judge; 
according to my ordinances shall they judge it; 
and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in 
all my appointed seasons, and they shall hallow 
my sabbaths. 

This linking of functions (teaching and judging) which 
heretofore have been ethical and moral, with completely 
ritualistic and ammoral elements, is a characteristic which 
will come up again in the post-exilic period with the 
Priestly Code. Therefore, since Ezexiel is the originator 
of the phenomena in Hebrew thought, or at least the first 
writer in whom it comes to the fore, we might as well deal 
with it here as later. 


Ezekiel has been thought of variously as a prophet 
and a prophetic-priest, im examination of the vocabulary 
which he uses reveals that of those terms and concepts 
dharacteristically used by the prophets he uses practically 
none, whereas of those terms used by the priestly writers 
he uses almost all and at great length . This would 
indicate that he was far more the priest than the prophet 


^ Mi Her, A. D., Morality and the Priestly Writings , 

unpublished. In this paper Dr. Miller examines the use 
of such prophetic terms as » justice ♦ ( ^ ui^ ), right¬ 
eousness ( p j ^ ), kindness ( ), loyalty ( T) ] ^ y ), 

compassion ( 'a'M/vp ), goodness (j,77j) and love (-n^n-Tiy' ), 
and such a priestly word as ’holy* ( u3 ttp ). The"^' 
results of the examination are significant^

and such prophetic elements as are found are a veneer put on 
to get a hearing and prestige. The ♦Holiness of Yahweh’ 
for the priests in general and Ezekiel in particular meant 
a grand transcendence and apartness and majesty and not at 
all the loving, merciful, just Gk)d of the prophets. The 
emphasis in every instance is on statutes, ^ sanctuary, 
my sabbaths, I am Yahweh, and so on’ 

This meant that no distinction is made between 
ritualistic demands and moral demands of religion. They 
are all commands of Gfod and obedience is the prime virtue. 
This can, and sometimes probably did, mean a moral activity 
on the part of man and on the part of the priests, but it 
also could and did mean that the priests could look at the 
cult and the religious life as a means of satisfying a God 
who was not particularly moral. 

The restoration of Ezekiel is just this sort of 
thinking. The country was to be set up as a priestly 
hierarchy in which the first principle would be obedience 
%o Yahweh, the second would be satisfaction of Yahweh v/ith 
sacrifice and festival, and the' third would be mainten¬ 
ance of the priestly guild which served the house of Yahweh.

Many special restrictions were imposed upon the 
priests. They v/ere to wear linen clothing to avoid 
sweating (44:17f) for this was a form of uncleanness, but 
they must not wear these clothes in the cuter court lest 
the holiness of their garments harm the people (44:19); 
they were to cut, not shave, their hair; they were not to 
drink wine when officiating in the ceremonies (44:20); 
they were not to marry save they marry an Israelite virgin, 
or the widow of a priest (44:22); they were not to defile 
themselves by touching a dead body unless it be a relative, 
in which case they were excluded from the inner court for 
seven days after their purification (44:26ff); they were not 
to eat animals which had died or been killed by other 
animals (22:31)<. 

The priests are to be well provided for, both in 
residence and in provision for food. great deal of the 
chapters 40-48 is given to a description of the temple 
and all its courts and residences, v/itli the stated parts 
set apart for various ranks of priests, i'hey are to have 
portions of the cereal-offering, sin-offering and guilt- 
offering (42:13f), and also the best of all the first- 
fruits and the best of the baked food of every household, 
and part of every oblation that is offered in the temple 
44:S8ff)^.

We must regard the book of Ezekiel as a note standing 
outside the periodical survey of the development of the 
priesthood, historically speaking. It was a vision which 
never came to pass, and, il uur uuserveitions on the post- 
exilic priesthood are correct, did not even have a great 
influence on the period which followed its writing. To 
this period we must now turn. 









Chapter IX 



PERIOD OF TEE ACTUAL RSST0R4TI0N 













Chanter IX 


PERIOD OF THE ACTUAL RESTORATION 

The usual picture of the return of the lews from 
captivity in Babylon has been a greatly exaggerated view.* 
This is largely a result of the day when scriptural 
material was not separated as to date but was accepted at 
its face value as authentic history for whatever period it 
purported to describe. Therefore, the Priestly history 
contained in Chronicles, which is really a history written 
in retrospect and with an ecclesiastical axe to grind, has 
been often accepted as an accurate source for the period of 
the return from exile. Likewise, the books of Ezra and 
Nehemiah, actually priestly sequels to Chronicles and 
written by the same author, have been used with confidence 
to reconstruct this period simply because they purport to 
deal with this period* 

So the picture that has been given is of a grand and 
glorious return of 42,000 (according to Ezra) exiles from 
Babylon, with hosts of priests and much equipment and with 
the full blessing and co-operation of Cyrus, the triumphant 
Persian king. Actually, probably not more than a few 
hundred returned under the leadership of Sheshbazzar. If 
Gyrus did give them help of money and escort it was only

for the journey and not for any time after they had arrived 
in Jerusalem. Torrey ^ does not think there was any actual 
return in any body at all. The Babylonian exiles who did 
return did so as individuals, or perhaps families, just as 
the Hebrew population drifted back and forth to and from 

other parts of the Near Eastern world. 

1 

However, the actual historical events of the return 
do not concern us here. It will suffice for out study to 
understand that about 520 B.C., well after the conquest of 
Babylon by Cyrus and any return that may have taken place, 
the poor, unrefined and largely unenthusiastic community of 
Jews in Jerusalem began to rebuild the Temple • The 
prophets Haggai and Zechariah (writing very near together 

I 

about 520 B.C.) were in large part responsible for the 

2 

decision, after much delay, to rebuild the ruined temple . 

Our really contemporary and authentic sources for this 

period are these prophets, Haggai and Zechariah, and the 

prophetic book which is called Malachi (written about 

460 B.C.). One of the most important contributions they

have to make to the study of the development of the priest¬ 
hood is their use of the term »high-priest» 13 7? ) 

(Hag. 1:1, 12, 14, Zech. 3:1, 8). In each case the 
reference is to Joshua. It is interesting that this title 
is used only nineteen times in the whole Old Testament# 

Three of these occurrences are in the Priestly writings, 
where we should really expect to see it innumerable times 
in view of the interest that writer has in building up a 
genealogy for the high-priest in his own day, (Num. 35:25, 
28, Josh. 20:6). And within a few verses of the use of the 
title the simple term ’the priest’ ( ] V.^V ) is used to 

designate the same office# The title is used of Joshua 
eight times (six of them given above). And strangely 
enough, though Joshua appears twelve times in Szra-Nehemiah, 
he is not once referred to in those words. Both 
Morgenstern and North suspect the authenticity of every 
one of the nineteen occurrences. They would hold that the 
earliest authentic use of the title ’high-priest’ is in a 
letter from the Elephantine colony in Egypt to the ruler of 
Judaea in 408 B.G. There a complaint is lodged with

lohanan, the ’kahana rabba* which is Aramaic for »high- 
priest^ They would admit that Joshua is given the same 

position as later became the high-priesthood but, since it 
was an entirely new office, it had mt yet received this 
title* -^his position is raoher aoaourui, since it requires 
the exclusion of all the passages which use the term and 
there are many of them in these admittedly authentic pro¬ 
phetic books. At any rate, even those who deny the actual 
title, admit that the position existed. 

There were no high-priests in the pre-exilic period 
and there is none in Ezekiel^s restoration. It is somewhat 
difficult to conceive from whence the concept came. The 
only logical explanation seems to be that it is an 
elevation of the dignity of the ^chief priest» of older 
times, in view of the fact that the king, who used to 
function as ’the chief priest’ as we have seen, was no 
longer in existence and was prevented from coming back into 
existence by very close watch from the Persian administrat¬ 
ion. It is conceivable that, had Zerubbabel’s ambitions 
and the program on his behalf which was advocated by some 
of the prophets at that time been achieved, the priest, 
Joshua, would have continued simply as ’chief priest’ of the 
Jerusalem sanctuary with Zerubbabel, the king, acting as 
chief priest for the land.

Neither Niaggai nor Zechariah make any mention of 

Levites alongside of priests The earliest mention of 

Levites is in the Memoirs of Ezra (7:27, 9:15), There Ezra 

tells of gathering together the people and the priests at 

the river that runs to Ahava and: 

there we encamped three days; and I viewed the 
people and the priests, and found there none of 
the sons of Levi. (8:15). 

So he sent some men to plead with the Levites to send some 

of their number to be priests in the house of God, Thirty- 

eight finally responded to the call (8:18-19). In other 

parts of Ezra-Nehemiah there is a sharp distinction between 

priests and Levites and these Levites so distinguished 

must be those thought of in the narrower sense as the 

descendants of the unfaithful Levites of the pre- 

Deuteronomic period. Harper ^ suggests that Ezra 10;5: 

Then arose Ezra, and made the chief of the priests 
the Levites and all Israel, to sy/ear that they 
would do according to his word. 

is an indication that the terms ’priest’ and ’Levite’ are 

still used synonymously, '^his may be so, for when they are 

named in such a list and a distinction is meant the 

conjunction ’and’ is usually written in (cf. Ezra 2:70). 

But this is exactly v/hat we find in three Greek manuscripts^

- 117 - 

Certainiy the witness of the rest of Ezra and Nehemiah 
agree with the distinction bstv;een the two groups (Ezra 
2:36-40, Neh. 7;39-43), 

In th6 IVIemoirs of both Ezra and Nehemiah a further 
distinction is made in the priestly orders, -i-'he Levites 
and the singers and the doorkeepers are separate classes. 
These latter two meet us for the first time in this period® 
But it is difficult to conceive of them having grown up in 
the Exilic period where there was neither Temple nor elab¬ 
orate cultus and where there would be no need nor place for 
such priestly functions, •^hey are more probably to be 
equated with orders that survived from the earlier temple, 
since indications from lall over the Near East are that 
every temple in almost every period had an elaborate scheme 
of attendants 

Haggai and Zechariah (2:llff and 7:3) show that one of 
the main functions of the priests was to give oral direction 
on matters of the clean and the unclean and other matters 
affecting religious observances. Though these writers are 
prophets these functions they attribute to the priests are

typically priestly, as we nave seen in the last chapter. 

Though we have seen a distinction between the priests 

and the Levites, there is not much in Ezra and hehemiah 

to suggest that this distinction prevented the Levites 

from assisting in the service of Yahweh much more closely 

than they were allowed to do by the restoration ideal of 

Ezekiel. Ezra 6:18 states: 

And they set the priests in their division and 
the Levites in their courses, for the service of 
Gor, which is at Jerusalem^ 

This may imply a distinction in function but usually 

* service of God» means priestly service in its highest 

sense. This service was varied. The priests are to offer 

sacrifice (Ezra 3;E-6, 6:10} and to pray for the king of 

Persia (6:10). They are to purify the people, themselves, 

and the gates of the temple (Neh. 12:30).. They are to 

read the Law in the presence of all the people (Neh. 8:2), 

they are to teach that Lav/ to the people (Neh. 8:9), and 

if we may judge from, the title which is given Ezra (the 

priest, the scribe of the Lav/) they were also to copy and 

preserve the Lav/. They seem even to have an official 

position along with the princes, for, when a covenant or 

document is drawn up, they set their seals to it just as 








-119- 

do the princes (Neh. 10:2 ®). ^ 


The great achievement of this period, it would seem, 

is the inauguration of the position of ’high-priest’. 

This office iDecomes supremely important for the remainder 

of the history of the Jewish people until the Temple was 

finally destroyed and with it the priesthood of Israel 

came to an end in 65 A.D. Gray says of the high-priest: 

The essential feature of the post-exilic high- 
priest is this: he is the supreme priestly and 
also the supreme Jewish civil figure in the comm¬ 
unity; when the Jews were a subject people, as for 
the greater part of the period they were, the high- 
priest was the highest native official, answerable 
for the people to the sovereign power; when for a 
brief period the Jews were free, the high-priest, 
at first in substance and afteriArards also nominally, 
was also king. The high-priest occupies the highest 
rank in the community; and next to him come, not 
princes, but priests* 


Since he did occupy such an eminent and powerful 
position throughout the period to which the rest of this 
paper is devoted, I think it worth while to deviate just 
slightly and devote the next chapter to a brief comparison 
between the pre-Exilic king and the post-Exilic high-priest* 


® If we accept Welch*s view in "North Israel’s Share in the 
Restoration of the Temple Worship’’, we will have to con¬ 
sider this passage earlier than this restoration period* 

^ How much of this material regarding these specific 
functions is the view of the P writer and how much is 
authentic for this period is very uncertain. However, 
most of these functions have been seen in earlier periods, 
so there is no particular reason to rule them out here 

simply because the source may be late.

Chapter X 



PRS-SXILIC KING AND POST-EXILIC HIGH-PRIEST 












Chapter X 

PRE-EXILIC KING AND POST-EXILIC HIGH-PRIEST ^ 

We have already seen ^ that kings were regularly 
anointed to their high position in Israel. In the later 
period the ceremony was performed only upon the High-Priest 
and his immediate assistants. The consecration ceremony 
is described in some detail in the Levitical Code (Lev. 
21:10ff, 6:20ff, 14:36ff). That the anointing was not done 
promiscuously among the priests in general but was 
restricted to the High-Priest himself, is shown clearly by 
the fact that just after the dedication of the second temple 
the term ♦the anointed priest’ i ) became the 

official title. ♦♦Beyond all question, this ’anointed 
priest’ had taken the place in the cult formerly held by 
the king”^ ^ «

in the temple in Jerusalem, as it had never been in the 
monarchical period. Therefore it was manifestly much 
easier and more practicable for one priest to minister on 
behalf of the whole people than it had been when shrines 
were scattered and religious allegiances centred at various 
points throughout the length and breadth of the land. How¬ 
ever, Morgenstern argues ^ that there were occasions in the 
monarchical period when the king acted on behalf of the 
whole people in a priestly role. These occasions were the 
annual New Year Day celebrations when the king entered into 
the Holy of Holies to receive from Yahweh the judgment on 
the people for the year past and to learn the destiny of the 
nation for the year that still lay ahead ♦ This cannot 
be discussed as fully as should be done in this chapter, 
but we do know that New Year’s Day was an important festival 
with regard to the kingship throughout the Semitic world* 
When Cyrus conquered Babylon in 539 B.C. he was recog¬ 
nized as the Great King immediately, but was not termed 
King of Babylon until he had grasped the hands of Marduk 

^ In many of his papers (and in his ^os Studies ) but most 
specifically in ”A Chapter in the H!istory of the High- 
Priesthood”* 

® This is an obvious anachronism, since the Holy of Holies 
is an invention of P, or of his period. In the monarch¬ 
ical period it was at first the tent sanctuary, and 
then the inner court of the Solomonic temple.

on his first New Year’s Day in office and received premiss¬ 
ion from him to rule his conquered domain. The Hebrew 
ceremony which Morgenstern is trying to reconstruct is 
probably a parallel one to this in which the king on each 
New Year Day would receive the right and pov/er to rule from 
the hands of Yahweh. On all other occasions the local 
sanctuary with its local priesthood would suffice. 

V/hen the temple was rebuilt and completed after the 

Exile in 516 E.C. it was appropriately and traditionally 

dedicated, most probably upon this New Year’s Day 
0 

festival . The language used of the dedication (Ezra 
6:16ff) is very close to that used in I Kings 8:63ff which 
is the corresponding pre-exilic occasion. Now, however, for 
the first time in the entire history of the nation, there 
is no king to play the important role* So it devolved upon 
Joshua, the head priest and only representative the people 
had, to take his place (Ezra 3?2, 6:17, Zech. 3:3ff)* By 
the time the Levitical Code was written the same ceremony, 
and apparently at the same festival, had become the 
ordained ceremony for the consecration of the High-Priest 
(Lve. 8:35, 9:23,34) . 

® Ezra 3:6 says it was on the first day of the seventh 
month, v/hich we know in the Jewish adaptation of the 
Babylonian calendar was New Year’s Day. 

cf. also Ezekiel’s legislation 43:26ff,

^nother relationship between the post-exilic High- 
Priest and the pre-exilic king is in the manner of their 
costumes, Unfortunately, not very much is given us in the 
Old Testament about the characteristic manner of the kings’ 
dress. Both Samuel (II Sam. 6:14) and the Chronicler , 

(I Chr. 15:27/ tell us of David wearing the linen robe and 
ephod. On the particular occasion described to us he was 
in attendance upon the Ark and it is presunBd that the 
ephod was part of his religious costume, not part of any 
royal costume. But it does show that the King v/ore it as a 
part of his paraphernalia, at any rate. The ephod became 
the characteristic apparel of the priests in general and a 
part of the elaborate costume of the High-Priest (I Sam. 
2:18, 22:18, Ex. 28:4-8). Also a part of the costume of 
the High-Priest was the crown ( itJ-Lev. 8;9) which, in 
all probability was part of the regular apparel of the king 
in the monarchical period (II Sam. 1:10, II Kings 11:12, 

Ps, 89:40). 

But far more significant than these by far is an 
illustration which comes from Assyrian archaeology. The 

breastplate of the Hi^-Priest as described in detail in 
Exodus 28:15-30 is almost identical with the breast-plate 
of King Ashur-nasir-apal of Assyria. This has been 

published as seen in an amber statuette found in Assyria

”The breastplate of judgement was inset with stones 
and enclosed in gold in their settings; there were 
three insets in each row, corresponding to the 
three rosettes in the Assyrian breastplate, but 
they were in four rows according to the tribes of 
Israel, not in three as on the statuette. In each 
of the insets was a Jewel; this makes it more 
plausible that the breastplate of the statuette 
was similarly adorned. In the breastplate were 
the Urim and Thummim, the casting lots of the 

Judgement to answer »yes* or *no’ ... 

In the breastplate of the statuette we have a valued 
parallel to Biblical practice, for its date is a 
trifle less than a century after the time of 
Solomon*^ 


It is not possible to say how the Eigh-Priest’s plate 
copied that of the Assyrian Ashur-nasir-apal, whether 
through an intermediate stage in which it was part of the 
Hebrew royal costume (which would seem most probable), or 
whether directly from the Assyrian costume, but that there 
is a close relationship seems i^uite certain in view of the 
extreme similarity of the two. It is not an uncommon 
thing for the Assyrian or Babylonian customs thus to have 
affected the Jews; if anything, it was quite a regular 
thing.

In the manner of succession and substitution the 
kingship and the High-Priesthood are also parallel. In 
Persia the king was required to name a substitute (who 
would become his successor) whenever he went off to war, 
because of the danger of his mission and the possibility 
that he would not return. There is every probability that 
the same custom prevailed in Israel. In the present Torn 
Kippur ceremonies in the Jewish church and in the time in 
which the Mishnah was being written or its tradition 
accumulated, two priests are appointed for the dangerous 
ceremony of entering the Holy of Holies. That it was 
always considered dangerous is illustrated by -the death of 
Nadab and Abihu who ’offered strange fire’ before Yahweh 
in the ceremony and were killed for their mistake. Nov;, 
Ibrgenstern interprets the ’two sons of the oil’ in Zech. 
4:14 as meaning the two anointed priests, tm^o because of 
the danger involved. The traditional view tha-t the second 
son of the oil was Zerubbabel is difficult to hold inasmuch 
as Zerubbabel was never anointed to his office. - Since we 
have seen that the king played the part of priest in this 
ceremony in the pre-exilic times, and it was at the time of 
the New Year Day v/hen he received his commission to rule, 
it is logical to suppose that he also appointed a second in 
rank who would be his successor in case he did not survive.

This might seem very tenuous as an argument but we do have 
the Persian analogy to give support to our argument. And, 
just as in the royal line the successor v/as a son of the 
king (I Ki. l:33ff) and preferably the eldest (II Chr. 21:3) 
so also in the High-Priestly succession, son succeeded 
father (Ex. 29:29ff, Lev. 16:32). 

In II Kings 16:10ff we see how Ahaz rearranged the 
furniture of the temple to suit his own purposes and how 
he brought from Damadcus an altar to his liking. This 
v/ould indicate, especially v/hen Urijah, the priest, complied 
readily with all his instructions, that the furnishings of 
the house of Yahweh were completely in royal charge. Yet 
in Numbers 4:4-14 it is plainly stated that the furnishings 
of the tabernacle are to be the explicit charge of Aaron 
and his, sons (this is the Levitical Code), and in Numbers 
18:1-7 the Levites are permitted to help with the ordinary 
tasks in the temple but not to have anytihing to do with the 
altar or the inner court. This is plainly another detail 
in v;hich the prerogatives of the king in pre-Exilic times 
became the prerogatives of the High-Priest in the Post- 
Exilic period. 

In the period of the kings it was commonly believed 
that the sin of the king brought disaster to all the people.

In II Sam. 21:lff we read of the famine in the land brought 
on by Saul’s sin. In II Sam. 24 there is the account of the 
plague that came upon Israel because of David’s sinful 
numbering of the People. In II Kings 17:l6ff it is plainly 
implied that the destruction of the K^rthern Kingdom was a 
result of the evil actions of Jeroboam. But this concept, 
too, was carried over into the later period and attached to 
the Iligh-Priesthood. In Lev. 4:S we read of the necessity 
of a special sin-offering because of even an unwitting sin 
of the priest which brought guilt upon the whole ^people. 

The duties, also, in large measure, becacie the duties 
of the High Priest. The latter being under the civil and 
military jurisdiction of the Persian government, makes this 
true in only a lii?mted sense. But the kiag’s duty of 
judgment becomes that of the Bigh-Priest and so on. 

We have said enough to show, alike in important and in 
unimportant details, that the post-exilic Eigh-Priest fell 
heir to the pre-exilic position, function and trappings of 
the king. There is a good foundation for the statement of 
North that: 

’’The liigh-Priest, though he is not so called, 
v/as, in effect, the king.” H

THE LATER POST-EXILIC PERIOD 


( 






Chapter XI 


THE L^TER POST-EXILIC PERIOD 

■ For this last period in the history of the priesthood' 
of the Old Testament, v;e have the most material and the 
material most clearly written by and about the priesthood. 
The J and E documents concerned themselves very little with 
the priesthood. It is true that they do have material 
bearing on the history we have tried to reconstruct but it 
is ineidental to their narrative and they are not concerned 
to put forward any particular idea. The D document did 
try to establish the v/orship at the< single central 
sanctuarj^ and to tliat extent were concerned with the priests 
It also gave ascendancy to the Levi tic al priesthood and x>hat 
emphasis is noted in it. V/e come now to the P document and 
the Holiness Code as well as to the Priestly history 
contained in large part in Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah. 

Although we have considerable material for our study 
in these writings its use is attended with inniimerable 
difficulties. Most, if not all, of it attempts to give 
the history of the whole priesthood, most of which is-long 
since past and gone. It does this in terms of the priest¬ 
hood existing in its own time but using characters and 

events from the historical period v;ith v^hioh it purports to

deal. This introduces much confusion as to interpretation. 
vVhat does it mean for the time of the P writer when he 
gives as one of the duties of the Levites the carrying of 
the ark in the desert? The ark, if it was in existence at 
all in the second Temple, certainly never had to be carried 
about. But what duty in the second Temple does this refer 
to, if any? Furthermore, we have to decide as to the 
accuracy of the writer in tv/o fields: in reporting pre- 
Exilic conditions, and in reporting conditions from his own 
time. V/e may conclude that it is quite unhistorical for 
the pre-Sxilic period but that even its unhistorical 
sections are only anachronisms and are true for the later 
period in which he is writing. Or we may conclude that it 
is unhistorical even for the period in vtrhich he wrote. 

This will become clearer as we dig into the material itself. 

The distinction which was made in Ezekiel’s ideal 
restoration is put into practice by the Priestly "writer. 

The priesthood is divided into tv/o parts: the Aaronites 
and the Levites. The Zadokites, whom Ezekiel attempted 
to make supreme are, however, not given that distinction. 
According to P the priesthood was established in the time 
of iloses. Before that tijQB no sacrifices had been offered 
and therefore there had been no need of priests. It is 
interesting to note that P ties the priesthood to sacrifice

whereas we have seen that this function was not required 
of the priests until the Deuteronomic period. In this 
respect, then, the P record is not correct. Moses 
installed as priests his brother Aaron and the sons of 
ri-aron. Henceforth only direct descendants in this line may 
act in the office of priest. ’Sons of Aaron’ and ’priest* 
are synonymous terms (Hx. 28:41, 29:44, 40:12ff, etc*). 

But we have seen the priestly ideas growing stronger 
concerning ritual, cleanness and uncleanness and so on, and 
so we see in this document that even of the Sons of Aaron 
only those who have satisfied the qualifications for ritual 
purity may act as priests. No Aai-onite who is disfigured 
or has any bodily defects may serve (Lev. 21:17ff); none 
who has defiled himself with a corpse, or shaved his head 
or beard, or profaned the name of God, or married a harlot 
or violated woman or divorced woman, or who is a leper or 
been made unclean by contact v/ith a leper, or refrained from 
washing his hands and feet in a bath before approaching the 
altar, may act the office of Priest (Lev. 21:1-9, 22:1-8, 

Ex. 30:19). A special costiome was required for serving at 
the altar. This is described in Ex. 28:40ff and 39:28ff. 

The functions of the Aaronite priests are innumerable 
and mostly concerned with ritual matters. Numbers 4:5-16 
gives minute instructions as to what they must do with all

the furniture of the inner sanctuary to make ready for a 
journey. Now, the setting of the, instructions is that of 
the nomadic period, hut they arise out of a detailed know¬ 
ledge of the duties of the priests at the time of the 
writing and not the duties of the priests at the time to 
which they are ascribed. The passage serves to indicate 
that they, and they alone, were allowed to use all the 
utensils mentioned, almost all of which have to do with 
sacrifices and offerings of various kinds. By far the 
majority of the functions of the priest at this time were 
so CO nc erne d. 

^'The early chapters of the book of Leviticus largely 
form a handbook for the guidance of the priests as 
to the animals required in different cases and as 
to the correct procedure in carrying out the 
ritual.^ ^ 

Burnt-offerings (Lev. 1:3-9), offerings of the flocks 
(l:10ff), offerings of fowls {1:14-17), meal-offerings 
Gh. S),.sacrifice of peace-offerings (Ch. 3), offerings for 
various kinds of sin (Chs. 4 & 5) and others through 

I 

jchapter 9 are dealt with minutely. G^apters 11-15 deal with 
various kinds of uncleanness: a woman having borne a child, 
a person with leprosy, a man having had an issue; and gives 
the ritual requirements which the priest must prescribe in

each case. 

At the altar the priest also has manifold duties. 

The offerer of the sacrifice must kill, flay and cut up his 
own victim (this differs from Ezekiel’s requirements in 
this respect), but the priests have to sprinkle the blood 
in the sanctuary (Lev. 1:5, 11, 15), they must lay the 
sacrifice on the altar and cause it to go up in the sacred 
fire (Lev. 1:7-9, 12f, 15-17). They have to pour out the 
drink-offering (Hum. 6:17) and they offer incense at the 
incense altar (Ex. 30:7ff). They have charge of the table 
of the shew-bread (Lev. 24:8) and the sacred candlestick 
(Ex. 27:21). 

Apart from the sanctuary they have special duties. 

The function of blessing, v/hich we have seen before, is not 

only assigned but the actual ritual blessing is prescribed: 

And Yahweh said unto Moses, saying: ’Speak unto 
j^-aron and his sons, saying: On this wise ye shall 
bless the children of Israel; ye shall say to them: 
Yahweh bless thee and keep thee; Yahweh make his 
face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee; 
Yahweh lift up the light of his countenance upon 
thee and give thee peace. So shall they put my 
name upon the children of Israel, and I “will bless 
them. (H-um. 6:22). 

Judging and teaching, as we should expect in the 
priestly writing par excellence, is a matter of ritual and 
religious concern. Determining the value of persons, beasts.

houses and fields that have been vowed to Yahweh hut about 

which there is some dispute (Lev. 27:8, 11, 14, 16) have 

to be decided by them, and the difference between clean and 

2 

unclean things and acts (Lev. 10, Eag. 2:11). 

The High“Priestly office, which originated in the 
period of restoration immediately after the Exile, when the 
people had no native leader save the priest of Leiusalem, 
is here thought to have been appointed by Moses and con¬ 
tinued by family succession in an unbroken line down to 
the time of writing. Aaron was the first high-priest. At 
his death Hliezar succeeded and was in turn succeeded by 
Phinehas (Nu. 25;llff). mn elaborate genealogy is worked 
out from this beginning to confirm the present high^priest 
in his position. For the first time it is clearly stated 
that the primary task of the High-priest is that of national 
mediator. ' Ee is'the only person allowed into the Holy of 
Holies on the Day of Atonement, and he must make 
propitiation for the priests, the congregation and the 
sanctuary (Lev. 16:6ff, Ee. 30:10, Lev. 4:3ff, 9:8ff, 4:ibif 
9:15ff, et al). Wb have noted that this function may well 
be a parallel to the Semitic custom of the king entering 
into the Temple of the God to receive from him the right 
to rule for another year, the judgment of the nation for

the past year, and the destiny of the nation for the year 
to come Temple is coiapletely in the charge of the 

High-Priest (Zech. 3:7)* The sacred oracle is in the posse 
ession and charge of the High-Priest. The actual manip¬ 
ulation of the Urim and Thummim is not here the magical 
practice it was in the earliest period but is instead a 
ritual matter. The judgments obtained would be from the 
Law. Special dress is required for the High-Priesthood, the 
most notable part of which was the breastplate of judgment 
to v;hich reference was made in the last chapter The 
rest of the costume is described in detail in Exodus 28 
and Leviticus 8. 

The Hi ^-Priest does not yet have the temporal power 
vfhich he achieved in the last period of the Hebrev*^ history, 
as we shall see in o\ir next chapter. But the parallels 
which exist between his position and that of the king of 
pre-Exilic Israel, suggest that the people considered him as 
actual as well as spiritual head. It is just the over- 

^ This custom has been discussed by me in an unpublished 
paper ^’The Hebrev\r New Year'% written in 1945 for a 
seminar on the Semitic Priesthood in Pacific School of 
Religion. It would be superfluous to do more than just 
mention it here.

lordship of Persia that prevents him from exercising it. 

Although the ^iaronic priests are Levitical in descent, 
there is a definite distinction made by the Priestly writer 
betv/een Priests and Levites. Whether such a rigid 
distinction actually existed is a matter we shall now have 
to give our attention to. The usual view is that it did 
exist However, others insist that there is much ideal- 
ization and wishful thinking in P , some believe that the 

n 

late attitude toward the Levite is imre invention , while 
at least one reputable scholar would say that the whole 

Q 

story is pure dream-stuff Our only approach to the 
problem is to see whether there is any internal contra¬ 
diction within the v;ritings of the priestly writer himself, 
and what light other late writings throw on the matter. 

We do find such contradictions. In P we find a basic 

contradiction concerning the one to whom the Levites are 

devoted. In Numbers 3:6, 9, 10 we read: 

Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before 
Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.

.thou shalt give the Levites to 

Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given unto 
him from the children of Israel, ^vnd thou shalt 
appoint Aaron and his sons that they may keep the 
priesthood; and the common man that drav^reth iiighL 
shall he put to death. 

But in the same chapter, verse 40, we read: 

And. Yahweh said unto Aoses: Number all the first¬ 
born males of the children of Israel from a month 
old and upward, and take the number of their names. 
And thou shalt take the Levites for Me, even 
Yahweh, instead of all the first-born of the 
children of Israel. 

Some attempt is made to smooth over this contradiction in 

Numbers 8:16ff (reading here only 18f): 

xi.nd I have taken the Levites instead of all the 
first-born among the children of Israel. And I 
have given the Levites - they are given to Aaron 
and to his sons from among the children of Israel, 
to do the service of the children of Israel . 

If Aaron were truly the earthly representative of Yahweh 

then Yahweh would naturally assign his priests to his 

service, and this explanation would be logical; Eow^ever, 

Hebrew thought did not allow of a mortal being considered 

equal to a God and even if they did, this passage still 

seems to involve more than just that idea. The Levites 

are also to be living substitutes for the sacrifice of the 

first-born of the whole of Israel. Lhe logic is so 

involved and the Hebrew (especially the beginning of the 


In the only passage'in the Old Testament where such an 
identification is made even in simile (Ex. 4:16) it is 
fmses who is the man anu Aaron who is to be his spokesman.

phrase ’They are given....’) is so strangely put together 
that one cannot escape at least the vague feeling that it 
represents an attempt to gloss over what was originally a 
flat contradiction. 

Again In Numbers 16, the account of the revolt of 
ho rah, entirely P material, there is another instance of 
inner contradiction having been glossed over. In this case 
we do not stand alone in this assertion. Both 3. A. Cook 
and R. Kittel find here a composite account, yet both 
components they believe is P material. The one tells the 
revolt of lay Israelites against the usurpation of priestly 
authority by the Levites (16:2“7a, 16:15a, 18, possibly 
vv. 19-23, 24, 26-27), while the other tells the account as 
if it were a rebellion among the Levites against the rise of 
the Aaronic priesthood {16:1a, 7b, 8-11, 16, 17, 35, 17:1-5) 
The first gives priestly authority to the Levites for the 
revolt failed. The second shows the Aaronic priesthood to 
be the choice of Yahweh since the revolt of the Levites 
failed. This latter account shows special pleading for 
something the author favored but could not achieve, or 
which he achieved only after great opposition.

Later writings, if we accept the hard lot assigned to 

the Levites by P, begin to ease the position of these 

Levi tic al priests. Numbers 18:3 (P) states that ’'they shall 

attend to you, and the charge of all the tent; only they 

shall not come nigh unto the holy furniture or the altar". 

Yet I Ghron. 23:28-38 makes the Levites the servants of the 

priests with the duty of purifying all the holy things, and 

of offering praises and offerings unto Yahweh. v/e know 

that the idea of holiness among the priests did not grow 

less as time went on so we v/ould expect the process to work 

the other way. Purely the P account cannot be accurate. 

In II Ghion. 17:8 the Levites, along v/ith princes and priests 

are given the teaching function: 

. and with them the Levites, even Shemaiah, and 

Nethaniah, . the Levites; and with 

them Slishama and Jehoram, the priests^ And they 
taught in ludah, having the book of the Law of 
Yahweh vdth them; and they went about throughout 
all the land of ludah, and taught among the people. 

And in II Ghron. 35:4-6 the Levites are told to stand in 

'the holy place and offer sacrifice for the people. Yet 

the other P record was that the Levites v/ere not to stand 

in the holy place or offer any sacrifice, imd again in 

II Ghron. 29:34 the author comes right out and declares 

the Levites more worthy than the priests: 

But the priests were too few, so that they could 
not flay all the burnt-offerings; wherefore their 
brethren the Levites did help themj'^iH the \vork

was ended, and until the priests had sanctified 
themselves; for the Levites were more upright in 
heart to sanctify themselves than the priests. 

Curtis calls this the Chronicler^s personal bias in 

favor of the Levites, but it is hardly the bias we should 

expect a v/riter of the Priestly school to have, unless 

perchance he were a Levite. 


Handling holy objects, teaching the lav/, offering 
sacrifices, are all functions of the priest in this late 
period. Yet we have seen here that they are all also 
assigned to the Levites. II Chron. 30:28 adds still 
another such function: 

Then the priests, the ■‘^evites, arose and blessed 
the people; and their voice was heard, and their 
prayer came up to his holy habitation, even unto 
heaven. 


Other post-Exilic literature bears out the same 
identification of -i^evites with priests and priestly 
functions, llalachi 2:4-8, 3:3, Isaiah 66:21, Jer. 33:18, 
21f are soriie examples, lialachi seems quite explicit on the 

ft 

matter: 

And now this commandment is for you, 0 priests.

This confusion vdthin the P document, this open 
contradiction between P and the Chronicler, this lack of 
support for the P polemic in writings outside the Priestly, 
this complete spread of such material all over the post-

is made between priest and Levite, and especially where such 
distinction implies subordination of tiie Levites it is a 
polemic of the Priestly writer for some reason or other*

with extreme difficulty only that they may be translated 
into terms of the post-Exilic period. Apart from these 
their duties are those we have mentioned above which are 
of a uniform priestly nature, and not subordinate. 

But we have two questions to ansv/er, once we have 
adopted the view that trds distinction and subordination is 
a fiction of the P writer. First, what happened to the 
Levites? In the New Testament all mentions of them are 
very suspect, coming from G-entile v/riters or Dispersion Jews 
who would know the LXX but not actual conditions in 
Palestine and so would presume that Levites still existed. 
The probable answer is that the use of the term Levitical . 
priests disappeared because of the lack of distinction in 
the priesthood. Second, why did the Priestly writers 
deliberately re-v/rite history in an attempt to make the 
distinction we have seen, and v/hy was it not challenged? 

The second part is easiest answered. The reading public 
at the time would be mostly priestly and there would be no 
particular objection. The first part is not so- easy. 

Berry thinks it was done to make the Temple cultus 
impressive. Servants were elevated to Levitical rank and 
the cultus ¥/as elaborated and broken into many divisions.

McNeile thinks it was done to give the priests (Aaronic) 
the right of sacrifice, for the earlier Mosaic priesthood 
had not possessed that right exclusively. ‘I'herefore an 
Aaronic priesthood, parallel with the Mosaic or hevitical 
priesthood, was invented to give this sacrificial 
authority. 


The most probable reason, in my opinion, is that given 
by Pfeiffer 

The aim of the Priestly Code is to show how the only 
God in existence became the invisible sovereign of 

the Jewish community .In other v/ords, the 

Priestly Code is just as dogmatic and detached 
from reality as the apocalypses. P'he only difference 
is that, whereas the apocalypses dreamt of a 
political kingdom of God in an age to come, the 
Priestly Code dreamt of a purely ritualistic ideal 
kingdom of God, belonging to the dim past. 

They desired to reconstruct the Jewish State as a theocracy® 

The Levitical tradition had been too long known to have 

served in a different kind of state and since it was 

insufficient for the task they were forced to create a 

priesthood v/ith more authority and less known history. A 

Aaron was the best prospect, since he was brother ofMoses, 

yet had not been connected v/ith a priesthood that had 

served under a monarchical state. The revision was carried

out much more thoroughly in P than in Chronicles since the 
historical tradition had already attained too great 
sanctity to allow such a ruthless change, importunately, we 
have had preserved for us the Chronicler’s work as well as 
the work of the Priestly school that wanted to change the 
whole history for the sake of an ideal state. 

Both residences and maintenance were provided in some 
degree of luxury for the priestly service of the Temple. 
They were exempt from taxes or tolls or levies of any kind 
themselves (Ezra 7:24) and they were to receive a tenth of 
all the wealth of the land for their support (Lev. 27;30ff) 

Courses of both Priests and Levites are mentioned as 
though they were divided into groups for special service 
(Ezr. 6:18, I Chron. 24:lff), and there is at least one 
reference to the presence of serving-women in the Temple 
(Ex. 38:8)., There is a similar reference in I Sam. 2:22b 
which Baudissin thinks is a priestly interpolation into the 
earlier narrative. There is no intimation as to what their 
tasks were, except that they ministered at the door of the 
tabernacle and were provided with brass mirrors. Certainly 
they were very unimportant members of the priestly guild.

is not entirely clear. The temple is once again the centre 
of all worship, the priesthood (even when we have cleared 
away the Aaronic-Levitical division) is a very complex 
business with many laws for their service, their sacrifice, 
and their upkeep. The emphasis is on ritual and legalism 
and upon the transcendence of Yahweh above all. Sven with 
the ideal of the Yahweh-theocracy minimized as an 
unrealized priestly fiction, the whole cult was nevertheless 
largely a priestly order and hierocracy. 

This is really the end of the Old Testament picture 
of the priesthood but it would be well to carry our study 
just one step further to see v/hat happened to this priest 
centred community when it achieved partial autonomy and was 
able to put some of its priestly Ideals into action. This 
we see in the Eellenistic period, which is the subject of 
our last chapter.

TH2 HELLENISTIC 


PERIOD 












Chapter XEI 


THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD 

The period in the history of the Near-Eastern Orient 
which is usually referred to as the Hellenistic period 
coincides very roughly with the inter-testamental period of 
Jewish history. This has long been recognized as one of 
the most difficult in which to give a clear picture and an 
authentic one of events, because of the lack of source 
material. However, scholars have now been able to date 
many of the Apocryphal and Pseudepigraphal writings in this 
period and to glean much extra information frora sources 
outside of Palestine and the pictiire of events and general 
culture of that time has been given more definite and 
concise shape* 

Although this has been true of the general picture, 
when we come to consider the subject of this study in that 
period all is not so bright. The sources we are able to 
use must be divided into three sections. First, there is 
the character of the High.-priesthood when it was separated 
from the civil power both before and after the strictly 
Maccabean revolt and rule. Second, there is the character 
of the High-Priesthood when it was combined with the civil 

rule during the period of.Maaccabean dominance* Third,

there is the character of the ordinary priesthood which 
continued to function throughout the whole period under the 
High-Priesthood. It would not be fair or accurate to apply 
references to any of these single sections to all three and 
we must be very careful in this respect, in the use of our 
sources. We have' considerable material for the second 
division but for the other two, especially the last, we have 
to search very closely to be enlightened. 

After the return of the lews from Babylonia and the 
failure of Zerubbabel’s ambitions for the rule of his 
country, Judaea was allovized a large measure of self- 
government. About the only requirements laid upon her were 
that she should pay a definite tax, furnish a certain 
number of young men for the standing army and keep the peace* 
The High-Priest was virtually head of the Jewish state 
from this time on, so long as the Jews complied with the 
easy terms we have mentioned, and they were allowed to rule 
themselves in their customary religious manner. 

Below the High-Priest there was an aristocratic ruling 
class of two strains--the descendants of the old families 
of wealth and royalty in the pre-exilic period, and the 
priestly families v/ho traced their descent back somewhat 
dubiously to David, or even to Aaron. The priestly families

final ly won out and took for themselves the offices and 
positions of social and civil influence. It is easy to see 
how this would happen when one considers the wealth that 
would come to the priests hy virtue of the law. It v\ras 
specified that the best of a man’s produce should go to them 
(£Izekiel 44:28ff), amounting, according to Jev^ish tradition, 
to one fortieth of the whole (Numbers 18:12). -^fter this 
had been taken, one-tenth of the entire crop had to be paid 
to the Levites, whose duty was to pass one-tenth to those 
higher up (Lev. 27:30ff, Num. 18:24ff). To the priest went 
the first-born of all the cattle or a mone 3 ?’ equivalent, to 
him the redemption money of every first-born male, (Num. 
3:46). According to Bailey and Kent ^ this would be the 
equivalent of about thirt^r dollars todaj'-. When a Jew killed 
an animal for food, part v/ent to the priest; when he 
sheared a sheep, a tenth of the price must be paid to him; 
a part of ever 3 ^ sacrificial animal and every meal-offering, 
sin-offering add trespass-offering became priests’ fees 
(Lev. 7). The punctual payment of these became a matter of 
conscience and a guarantee that Yahweh would in turn bless 
the giver. No wonder under such a system it paid to be a 
priest, and even to intrigue and bribe and murder one’s way

into the High-Friest’s chair. 

Of course, the people expected in return for all this 
tribute to be given some service and the priesthood was not 
all graft and corruption. It servea its useful functions, 
as we have already seen, and even if they had only wished 
to graft, there was a written law beyond which they could 
not go. This law had been enlarged by the priests of the 
Exile, who having had no Temple to serve had turned their 
zeal to perfecting the traditions and ritual of their 
worship. Other additions had followed in continual pro¬ 
cession after the rebuilding of the Temple and right down 
into this Hellenistic period. This law^ was binding on 
priest and people and was a safe-guard of popular rights. 
Since the law v/as supreme over all, he who had perfect 
knowledge of it and was skilled in interpreting it, would 
rise to a position of power and dignity in the state. Ezra 
is the first such scribe of whom we have reference in the 
Old Testament, and until his time they were practically 
non-existent. But in this Hellenistic period and down into 
the New Testament period, the scribes are perhaps as 
numerous as any other priestly group, ^t first the 
scribes v/ere just priests but later seem to have included 
laymen. They began to be prominent in the Persian period 
and by Jesus» day the scribe seems to overshadow even the

priest. 

I give this general picture of conditions just before 
the inroads of Kellenism, because I believe that, except 
for a little Hellenistic modification in the whole period 
and considerable Hellenistic influence in one period with 
which we will deal more specifically, this picture remains 
fairly authentic, insofar as the regular priesthood is 
concerned, right through the period with v/hich we are 
concerned in this chapter. 


When Alexander conquered the near east, he included 
Palestine in his broad sweep. In the period that followed 
immediately Palestine was the unhappy borderland between 
Egypt and Syria. In 301 B.C. Ptolemy won control of Pales¬ 
tine and retained it for the next century. 

"Down to S00,B.G. Judaea was under Ptolemaic rule 
and little is heard of its history, except stories 
of quarrels betv/een the tV'JO leading families, the 
Oniads, who held the High-Priesthood, and the 
Robiads, whose stronghold was near Heshbon in 
Ammon, and may or Miay not have been partly of 
, Ammonite blood. As regards literature, the 
third century seems a blank." ^ 


However, my contention that the priesthood went on 
much the same is supported by what we can glean from

references in intertestamental literature: 

Fear God with all thy heart 
And reverence his priests. 

V/ith all thy strength love him that made thee, 

And forsake not his ministers. 

Glorify God and honor the priest 

And give them their portions as it is coiomanded thee, 
The food of the trespass-offering, and the heave- 
offering of the hand, 

The sacrifices of ri^teousness and the offerings 
of holy things.^ 

This might have come equally v/ell from the post-exilic 

Biblical period as from the Eellenistic period, hlore 

specifically, the descriptions of Onias, High-Priest about 

300 B.C., as being of such godliness that all the kings of 

surrounding nations did honor to the Temple and Ben 

Sirach’s song in praise of Simeon, son of Johanan (Simon 

the lust) both reflect much credit and no irregularity 

within the priesthood at this time. Indeed, Simon: 

became the typical embodiment of the High-Priest- 
hood in pre-Maccabean days to the imagination of 
later lews. It is given as his characteristic 
maxim that the three pillars upon ^^^rhich the world 
rests are the Law, hoiy ritual and loving- 
kindness. ^

But when Antiochus III, the Great, wrested control 
of Palestine from the Ptolemies and then was succeeded in 
187 B.C. by his son, Seleucus IV Philopater, the priestly 
aristocratic group at the top of the priestly hierarchy 
began its road toward secularism and civil power. Ihe 
public offices of the religious Jewish state became for 
them objects of worldly intrigue. Against this tendency 
there developed a group of men with a more ardent and 
determined spirit of piety and a refusal to compromise v/ith 
the Hellenistic influence that was beginning to shape the 
minds and manners of the less determined Jews. These 
’hasidim’ were largely from the poorer classes, but drew a 
few of their members from the higher groups and even 

7 

included Onias, the Kigh-Friest, among their number. This 
party (for a party it soon became) kept the Jewish people 
from going over completely to the Hellenistic camp but 
could not accomplish the impossible. Indeed, if we may 
trust Josephus and correctly date and interpret one or two 
other sources, it is doubtful if even Onias and his priests 
were as pious as they have been generally represented. 

^^This Onias v/as one of the little soul and a great lover of 
money”; he didn’t pay his taxes and, when Buergetes 


7 . 


Son of Simon, the Just, and grandson of Onias I. 













- 152 - 

threatened to occupy Jerusalem, ”so sordidly covetous was 
Onias that nothing of this nature made him ashamed” And, 

if Tarn is correct in dating Zechariah 9-14 in this 
particular period, the priesthood also stands in this 
condemnation: 

fTis they who make my people stray like sheep, 
V/andering for lack of a shepherd* 

My anger is hot against the shepherd, 

And I will punish the leaders. 

..Woe betide that worthless shepherd of mine. 

Who leaves the flock to itself. 

May the sword strike his arm and his right eye, 

May his arm be withered and his right eye blinded, 

Up sword against my shepherd, 

Against my High-Priest* ^ 


A further indication of the secular bent of the priest¬ 
hood, and it must include the whole Temple system, is the 
banking system which Simon betrayed to Heliodorus. The 
description is indicative of something more than just an 
ordinary temple treasury, so common in the Orient. It is 
much more suggestive of the sort of thing that Jesus found 
in the Temple of his day and condemned so roundly

Further weight is added to this comparison when we consider 
the vision of Zechariah of the day when God would purge the 
Temple of all its impurities: ^»And in that day, there shall 
be no more a trafficker in the house of Yahweh' of Hosts” 
(Zech, 14:21)* It seems that even as early as the beginning 
of the second century B*C* the priests had begun to make the 
Temple a den of thieves# 

Simon, one of the aristocracy, in an attempt to win the 
Eigh-Priesthood for himself, slandered Onias and told Helio- 
dorus about the treasure in the Temple* Heliodorus failed 
in his attempt to take it. Then Onias went to Antioch to 
present his case against Simon* Heliodorus, in the meantime, 
murdered Seleucus IV to gain his throne. But before any of 
these schemers could gain by circumstances Antiochus IV, 
Epiphanes, seized the throne and invested Jason (brother of 
Onias) with the High-Priesthood inisrael* 

"^his is the period of the worst defection of the 
people and the priests from their law and life toward the 
Hellenism which both Antiochus and Jason tried to impose 
Upon them* 

The priests were no longer interested in the 
services of the altar, but, despising the sanctuary 
and neglecting the sacrifices, they hurried to 
take part in the unlawful displays held in the 

palaestra, after the quoit-throwing had been 
announced#

We had gone astray from the path of the Eternal, 
and with foolish hearts worshipped the works of 
men's Ip^^nds, idols and images of men that are 
dead* 




The priests took more delight in exploits of games 
and valor than they did in their proper pursuit of the study 
of the Law Jason encouraged such trends as much as he 

could* 


He obtained leave to remodel Jerusalem, as a new 
Antioch, on Hellenistic lines. The indispensable 
gymnasium rose in the heart of the city; the 
younger members of the Jewish aristocracy eagerly 
formed a body of 'epheboi' and flaiinted the streets 
in their ephebic garb, which corresponded to the 


Greek country dress, chlamys and broad-brimmed 
hat By the act of its ov/n people, Jerusalem 


had renounced its age-long isolation and come into 
line with the great Hellenic world. 


As Jason had plotted against Onias, so another was soon 
plotting against him. We know him only by his Greek name, 
Menelaus, through Josephus. He carried on the Hellenizing 
program even so far as to allow Antiochus in the sacred 
temple and to touch the vessels, many of which he himself 
sold and gave away as gifts

Wearing the hat came to be a particular mark of the 
recognition of Hellenistic ways. cf. Olmstead, A.T.,

This is not a very creditable characterization of the 

priesthood, but it is probably much easier to blame than to 

understand* Certainly the High-Priests must be adjudged 

guilty as the leaders of their people. But the ordinary 

priesthood was probably not as bad as they have been painted 

by reflected condemnation, at least not the majority of 

them. What compromising they did was more than likely at 

the direction of the people and of the superior priests. 

They seem to have felt some remorse at the course which 

public opinion was forcing them to take. The author of 

Jubilees seems to me to echo a familiar answer in the reply 

he puts in the mouth of Terah, Abraham’s father, when 

Abraham seeks to turn him frojji idolatry (a clear case of 

telling of the present in a narrative imputed to the past): 

I also know it, my son, but what shall I do with 
a people that have made me serve before them? And if 
I tell them the truth they will slay me; for their 
souls cleave them to worship them and honor them. 

Keep silent, my son, lest they slay thee. 

And certainly the fact that the Maccabean revolt was 

touched off by a priest who refused to conform to the new 

way, and that he found enough support to remain at large and 

inflict defeats on the enemy (even though part of the reason 

lay in the other distractions which pulled at the Syrian 

ruler), suggests that not all of the people or the priests

! were satisfied to give in. The ceremony of sacrifice used 
in Second Maccabees 1:23 is the usual way of sacrificing 
with no particular Hellenistic influence; when Nicanor went 
to the Temple to demand the surrender of Judas, he found 
the priests offering up the usual sacrifices when 

i 

I Janneus polluted the temple by oreaiting the Pharisaic 

i 

regulations of the sacrifice the people, and probably the 

priests, hurled citrons at him and reviled him as being

I unfit for the priesthood All these incidents suggest 

i 

that the priesthood in general was far from being completely 
bad or completely swayed by Hellenistic influences# 

But whatever may have been the character of the 
general run of the priesthood it is clear enough that the 
High-Friesthood, during the rule of the Maccabees, was just 
a political office ranking with other political offices 
throughout the Orient. 

When Jonathon ”put on the pontifical robes” his first 

act was to "raise great forces and have abundance of armor

been his father’s before, he propitiated God by sacrifices, 

and then made an expedition against Ptolemy” When 

Aristobulus succeeded his father ’’intending to change the 

government into a kingdom, for so he resolved to do^ first 

of all he put a diadem on his head” . All the official 

correspondence during this period was sent to kings or 

governors in most countries. But in Judaea’s case it was 

written and sent to the ’hi^-priest’ The reasons 

given in First Maccabees (14:27-41) for bestowing the High- 

Priesthood on each of the Maccabean rulers in turn are 

entirely secular reasons and have no reference to priestly 

or spiritual qualifications for the position. Antiochus 

VII even gave to Simon the right to issue his own coinage , 

a prerogative which was usually strictly a royal one and 

often a sign of the assumption of royal power. 

So completely had the life of the nation crystallized 
around its faith, and the High-priest become its 
acknowledged head, that the new monarchy was 
combined with the priesthood. Politics and religion 
could not henceforth be separated.

After Alexander Janneus, the civil and religious 
offices were again divided by Alexandra, ‘■‘•he Pharisee 
party, which had grown out of the Hasidim, had supported 

j 

I John Hyrcanus in his desire to be ruler of Judaea. But 
iwhen he gained power he felt more affinity with the Sadducee 
party, which had grown out of the old priestly aristocracy. 
When some bold voice among the Pharisees demanded that 
Hycranus should cease to usurp the High-Priesthood, 

whether he continued to hold the political power or not, he 

i 

became a declared enemy of the Pharisee party and even 
'tried to put down their distinctive practices and beliefs 
by force. The tension was even worse when Alexander was 
ruling and it found expression when the people, who were 
on the side of the Pharisees, pelted him with citrons in 
the Temple and he retaliated by slating six thousand of 
them. Josephus reports that it was Janneus advice to his 
wife, Alexandra, that she should make peace with the 
Pharisees. ?/hether this is so or not, the fact is that 
she did let them more or less run matters d\iring her reign. 

In appearance, the Hasmonaeans had won a victory for 
righteousness over worldliness (the Pharisees had even 
asked Pompey to do away with the Kingship so they could 
devote their whole attention to religion But in

reality it was a compromise. There would no longer be any 
open breach of the Law, no visible sign of idolatry, no 

I tampering with the sacred ritual. But the Hellenistic 

I 

spirit of worldliness and practical considerations still 
continued to work upon the people though held within these 
limitations. 

The High-Priest continued to have considerable civil 
power over the Jews as long as he cooperated with the (now) 
Roman representative. The lower ranks of the priesthood 
still devoted themselves to temple duties and services, 
interpretation of the Law, and pious (at least outwardly 
pious) living. The Sadducees and Pharisees remained in 
opposite camps right through the period of Jesus* life. In 
65 A.D. the High-Priesthood was abolished and the ancient 
history of the Jewish priesthood caime to an end with it.

CONCLUSION 


We have traced the history of the Hebrew priesthood 
from its beginnings to its end, stopping occasionally to 
discuss some controversial element in its development. We 
have noted that it began in common with the priesthoods of 
most primitive peoples, that ita earliest development was 
conditioned by the needs of the Hebrew people as they moved 
j from their nomadic setting into an agricultural setting, 
and then progressed into city life, commercial life, 
political life, with all their attendant dangers and inter¬ 
relationships. 

I At no place have we found that the priesthood was 

particularly aggressive in its leadership—it followed the 
needs of the people, rather than led the people into new 
ways of life which produced new needs. But at the same 
time, it must be stated that we have nowhere found that the 
priesthood was particularly a regressive force. Its main 
contribution to the history of the nation was to consol¬ 
idate the people in those new steps each time the nation 
went forward. 

We have not found evidence to substantiate the thesis 
that the priesthood was morally a bad influence on the 
people. Its function of judgment, of preserving the Law

(jmich of which v/as moral, even when written by priestly 
writers), of resisting innovations to the cult (except in 
certain very corrupt periods, when we must suppose that the 
priests were no worse than the people in general), and of 
keeping the relationship of the people to their God 
constantly before the people, were functions without which 
the Hebrews might have been much less worthy of respect and 
! admiration than they are. 

I 

I We have seen that the record of the priesthood, as it 
is presented on the face of the Old Testament record, is 
jnot at all points trustworthy, because of the external 
I motives which many of the historians had. But we have also 

j 

i seen that all the material necessary for a comparatively 
I trustworthy account are present in the Old Testament records 
and that patient and diligent searching will find them out 
and put them together correctly. 

A very fitting summary of the view which our study 
seems to substantiate, at least as applying to the Old 
Testament Priesthood as a whole, is given by Dr. A. D. 
Miller, and with his words I bring my study to a 
conclusion 

The priests were not without value to Israel’s 
religion. The prophets came and went, the priests

were continuous* Much of what the prophets taught 
in one generation the priests took up later and 
taught to all succeeding generations. The prophets 
were not organizers, but dreamers, and usually 
their visions were much too lofty for the people* 
The priests anchored what they were able to 
receive of the prophets^ teaching to a ritual that 
kept it from being wholly lost* As Nehemiah’s wall 
preserved the Jewish race and faith, though it did 
induce a narrow patriotism, so the well-nigh 
fanatic^‘ reverence for the law created by the 
priestly classes resulted at length in even the 
writings of the prophets themselves being received 
as sacred, and also brought the writings of the 
Jews safely through the Greek peril* 

Nor were individual priests without their high 
ideals. No doubt there were priests worthy of the 
noble words of Malachi 2:4ff: 

*Por my compact was made with the priest of 
Levi, Says Yahweh of Hosts: my compact was 
with him, life and peace I gave him, ay and 
reverence — he did revere me, he did stand 
in awe of me. True instruction came from 
his mouth and no wrong issued from his lips; 
in peace'and honesty he lived close to me, and 
he turned many away from evil* For the lips 
of a priest ought to treasure wisdom, and men 
ought to seek direction from his words, since 
he is the spokesman of Yahweh of Hosts**
