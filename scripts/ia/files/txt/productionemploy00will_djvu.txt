PRODUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT IN ALBERTA 


In discussing the present pattern of production and em- 
employment in Alberta this general outline will be followed. 
First, a picture of the production of Alberta in 1941 by in¬ 
dustrial groups is given. Following which a comparison of 
Alberta with the other provinces is made in relation to primary 
and secondary production, and in the degree of diversification 
each province has reached. Next, a general view of Alberta is 
presented, wherein the broad trends of production and Alberta’s 
contribution to Canada’s total output, is developed. 

After this general presentation, a breakdown of Alberta’s 
1941 production is examined. A comparison of the commodities 
produced within the major industrial groups of Alberta is then 
made with those produced in the other provinces. Consideration 
also is given to the degree of diversification within these in¬ 
dustrial groups in each of the provinces. A statement touch¬ 
ing upon the trends within the main production groups of Alberta 
is followed by an estimate of the external trade of the Province 
in relation to the export and import of commodities. 

Employment in Alberta is then discussed and the relative 
importance of the different industrial groups in providing jobs 
is considered. Next, comes a description of the location of 
Alberta’s natural resources, and her chief manufacturing centres. 
Consideration is accorded also to where rural Albertans now 
live and to the shifts that are taking place in the rural pop¬ 
ulation. 

Finally, an introduction of the factors which influence 
the location of industry is brought in and an attempt is made 
to weigh their probable effects on future industrial expan¬ 
sion within Alberta.

I. PRH3 iJNT PATTERN OF PRODUCTION IN ALBIRTA 


2 


PRODUCTION BY INDUSTRIAL G-ROUPS 


Dross and Net Production in Alberta, 1941 , 

The Province of Alberta had in 1941, a total gross pro¬ 
duction of $443,175,858 as shown by Table 1. In terms of net 
production - ^ the above figure would be $276,898,177 or 5.87 per 
cent of the net production of the Dominion. 

Closer inspection of Table 1 will reveal the predominating 
position occupied by agriculture which accounted for 58.3 per 
cent of the total net production. Two other industries stand 
out from all the others, namely, manufacturing and mining, 
their combined contribution being approximately 28 per cent of 
the total, divided about equally between them. The construction 
industry, which is subject to quite wide fluctuations, made a 
net addition of 5.7 per cent. The value of the products of the 
remaining industries, forestry, fishing, trapping, electric 
power and custom and repair, made up about 8 per cent of the 
total net production. 

It may also be seen from this Table that the primary in¬ 
dustries of the Province were responsible for nearly 75 per cent 
of the total net production. 

Comparison with the Other Provinces. 

Alberta’s setting in relation to the other provinces is 
shown by Table 2, which gives for 1941 the percentages of the 

l/ n Net" production represents the total value less the cost of 
materials, fuel, electricity purchased and process supplies 
consumed in the production process. For purposes of ordinary 
economic discussion, the net figure should be used in prefer¬ 
ence to the gross, in view of the large amount of duplication 
that the latter includes.

2 The totals for manufactures involve duplicated amounts that 
were deducted in computing the total production. The dupli¬ 
cation arises from including in two places a number on in¬ 
dustries that may be regarded as extractive or as manufact¬ 
uring processes, e.g., sawmills, butter and cheese factories.

value of net production in each industry for each province. 

Apart from the Yukon and Northwest Territories, Alberta stands 
next to Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island in the percentage 
of production attributable to the primary industries, the figures 
being 76.9 per cent, 82.8 per cent, and 78.8 per cent, respect¬ 
ively. 

Ontario and Quebec are the two main industrial provinces 
of the Dominion, their secondary industries accounting for two- 
thirds in the case of Ontario and three-fifths in the case of 
Quebec, of their total net production. Due to the relatively 
large primary production of these two provinces compared to 
the others, the primary group is responsible for only 44.92 per 
cent of the total production of Canada. 

The provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba and 
British Columbia show a very similar pattern as between primary 
and secondary industries. In each instance the net production 
is roughly three-fifths from primary industries and two-fifths 
from secondary industries. 

Although Alberta is in a more favorable position than 
either Saskatchewan or Prince Edward Island, if a closer balance 
as between primary and secondary industries is desirable, it 
may be seen that Alberta has considerable industrial develop¬ 
ment to undergo to reach a position comparable to that of Man¬ 
itoba. 

The degree of diversification found in each of the prov¬ 
inces is brought out by a further examination of Table 2. As 
was pointed out above Alberta has about three-quarters of her 
production concentrated in the primary industries.

Agriculture is the back-hone of Alberta’s economy and 
in only two other provinces does this industry rank relatively 
higher, namely, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island. 

Mining ranks second in importance in the primary group 
for Alberta. Excellent fields of high grade bituminous and 
lignite coal are found throughout the Province. Turner Valley, 
the oil center of Canada, is responsible for a substantial 
share of the mineral production of the Province in the form of 
petroleum and natural gas. While the bulk of petroleum pro¬ 
duction comes from this field, large quantities of natural gas 
are obtained from Medicine Hat, Viking and other areas. It may 
be seen that, while mining is relatively more important in 
Nova Scotia and British Columbia than in Alberta, it is relatively 
less important in Quebec and Ontario ?/here it constitutes about 
one-tenth of the total net production in each case. 

Forestry is relatively unimportant in Alberta, whereas, 
it is the first ranking industry in New Brunswick and first 
along with manufacturing in British Columbia. 

Alberta’s fishing industry, centered on the larger lakes 
in the central and northern parts of the Province, is as yet 
comparatively small. This industry reaches its greatest develop¬ 
ment on the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts of the Dominion, where 
two of the four great sea-fishing areas of the world are located. 

Manufacturing is the leading secondary industry in all the 
provinces, as might be expected. Alberta leads Prince Edward 
Island and Saskatchewan in the percentage of net value attribu¬ 
table to this industry, but does not quite reach one-half the 
percentage of Manitoba, where one-third of all net production

comes from manufacturing. 

The construction industry in Alberta compares favorably 
with the other provinces; Alberta leads Ontario, Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan relatively, and is only slightly under the per¬ 
centages for Prince Edward Island, Quebec and British Columbia. 

Briefly, it may be stated that Ontario and Quebec are 
essentially industrial provinces; Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, 
Manitoba and British Columbia show a good industrial develop¬ 
ment backing their basic primary industries. On the other 
hand, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island are pre¬ 
dominately devoted to the primary industries, mainly agriculture, 
and have varying degrees of secondary industry development. 

Trends in Alberta Production . 

During roughly the last twenty years the net value of 
production in Alberta rose in the 1920*3, fell in the 1930*s 
and is now on the rise again. For the census years indicated 
in Table 3 it may be seen that 1926 represented the peak year 
of production (column one). A very sharp decline was registered 
in 1931 and this was followed by a further reduction in 1936. 
Although 1941 is shown slightly under 1926 in the first column, 
if the figures are adjusted for changing prices as shown by 
column 2, we find that 1941 was the year of the greatest net 
production. This 1941 figure represents a substantial increase 
over the average of the five years shown in the Table; the in¬ 
dex numbers show a rise of 50 points in this respect. 

Alberta’s contribution to the Canadian total is shown as 
a percentage in column four, and on a per capita value basis

in column five. Alberta’s percentage of the Canadian total in¬ 
dicates that her relative output has declined from 1926 to 1941. 
This decline is no doubt explained by the impact of the depress¬ 
ion during the 1930’s on the prices of agricultural products 
which form such a large part of Alberta’s total production. 

The still further decline as shown by the 1941 figure, may be 
largely due to the abnormally low crop yields of that year and 
to the extra impetus given to highly industrialized provinces 
by war contracts. 

The increasing volume of net production from the Province 
is more clearly shown in the per capita columns. Although per 
capita production in 1941 was still under the peak year of 1926 
(around 40 points by the index) a substantial gain has been re¬ 
corded over the 1936 figure. War conditions causing shortages 
of labor, especially on farms, have no doubt been partly re¬ 
sponsible for the higher output per person in 1941. 

Although agricultural production is responsible for by 
far the largest share of Alberta’s total production, its re¬ 
lative importance is showing a slight decline. Except for the 
depression year of 1931, the production of this industry in 

1941 is the lowest in percentage of total output of any of the 

1 / 

years shown in Table 4. A low crop yield in 1941 may account 
for part of this decline. 

Forestry shows a small gain in recent years in relative 

l/No attempt has been made to adjust the percentages in Table 
4 for changes in the level of prices for the years considered.

importance, while fishing and trapping have remained practically 
unchanged. 

Mining production brings to light a rather wide variation. 

In 1921 this industry contributed 17.3 per cent of Alberta’s 
total production, while in 1926 it was responsible for only 
9.2 per cent. The figure for 1941 is about at the average of 
the years reviewed. 

Electrical power reveals an increase in relative importance 
in 1941 when compared to the 1920’s, but its relative position 
has not materially changed since 1931. 

There is a decided upward trend to the percentage of total 
production resulting from the construction industry. The con¬ 
tribution in 1941 represents 5.7 per cent of the total, an in¬ 
crease of nearly 100 per cent over the twenty-year period. Large 
building committments by the Dominion Government for the Common¬ 
wealth Air Training Plan and for other military establishments 
in Alberta may account for the rather inflated figure for 1941. 

Custom and repair shows only minor changes as would be 
expected from a service industry which is so closely related to 
the population needs. 

Although the manufacturing industry is intimately related 
to Agriculture, there is a decided trend toward an increase in 
its relative importance. From 1921 to 1941 the Table shows 
that manufacturing has increased its net production from 9.7 
per cent of the total to 14.8 per cent, a gain of over 50 per 
cent. 

During this interval the development of the Turner Valley 
oil field has led to the establishment of a petroleum refining

industry. Also the expansion of sugar "beet production in the 
irrigated areas of Southern Alberta has made necessary the 
building of sugar refineries. These two new manufacturing in¬ 
dustries, together with other new ones, have, along with the 
expansion of manufacturing establishments already producing, 
been largely responsible for this increase.

BREAKDOWN OF MAJOR INDUSTRIAL GROUPS 

Alberta Production, 1941 

Agriculture 

Due to an abnormally low crop yield in 1941, the esti¬ 
mated gross value of agriculture production in Alberta for 
the year 1940 is presented in Table 5* The seven-year aver¬ 
age for field crops was found to correspond closely to the 
1940 production and for that reason the 1940 figures were 
chosen. 

The growing of field crops is the principal occupation of 
the farming population of Alberta and in 1940 produced $136, 
572,000 gross or approximately 65 per cent of the total agri¬ 
cultural production. Wheat continues to be the main crop 
accounting for 65 per cent of the total field crops production. 
In the "other" group the main production comes from grain hay, 
hay and clover, sugar beets and root crops. 

Livestock makes a very important contribution to the 
agricultural economy of the province. In 1940 this amounted to 
approximately one-third of the value of the field crops. Hogs, 
cattle and calves were mainly responsible for the showing made 
by this branch as they supplied roughly 90 per cent of the total. 

The production of dairy products on Alberta farms has 
been increasing steadily. Table 5 reveals that in 1940 the 
total gross production was valued at $19,532,344. Of this 
total fluid milk and cream accounted for nearly one-half of 
the total. Creamery and dairy butter production made up 
practically all of the remaining portion, with cheese and 
ice cream showing relatively small amounts.

The poultry group shows a very even division between 
egg and poultry meat production, the total representing 3.6 
per cent of the total agricultural output. 

Honey, wool, and fur farms comprise the other group and 
combined their production amounts to less than 1.0 per cent 
of the total. 


Mining 

The non-metallic minerals constitute the chief mineral 
resource of Alberta, as a reference to Table 6 shows. From 
the almost inexhaustible coal resources a gross production of 
$19,332,471 was realized in 1941. This was almost 50 per cent 
of the total mineral production. Petroleum and natural gas 
production together was nearly as large as coal, while salt was 
responsible for practically all of the remaining output of this 
group. 

Cement and other clay products consisting of principally, 
sewer pipe, bricks and brick-tile, and pottery were produced to 
the value of $1,937,174. Most of the cement production comes 
from Exshaw on the C.P.R. west of Calgary, while the manufacture 
of clay products is largely centred around the city of Medicine 
Hat where natural gas is utilized in the manufacturing process. 

Other structural materials found scattered throughout the 
province accounted for 1.5 per cent of the total mineral pro¬ 
duction. 

Electrical Power 

A total of 319,743,000 kilowatt hours of electrical energy 
was generated in Alberta in 1941. Of this total hydraulic

stations generated 179,409,000 kilowatt hours and fuel stations 
generated 140,334,000 kilowatt hours. 

Edmonton, with the largest fuel generation plant in the 
province, generates power from coal and operates its own dis¬ 
tribution system. Medicine Hat uses power derived from natural 
gas and supplies her own requirements as well as those of the 
adjoining town of Redcliff. Lethbridge uses coal-generated 
power and has, like Edmonton a power exchange agreement with 
the Calgary Power Company (hydro-electric power) covering 
peak period needs. The Canadian Utilities Limited distributes 
power generated from coal from the City of Drumheller to towns 
north and northeast of theX centre. 

Hydro-electric development is confined to plants located 
west of Calgary on the Bow River and its tributaries. In¬ 
stallations rated at 71,997 h.p. were in use in 1941. Addi¬ 
tional installations have been made since then and at the end 

of 1944 the horse-power rating hadl been increased to 92,920 in 

1 / 

central electric stations and to 2077 in other industries / 
This development represents less than one-quarter of the avail¬ 
able power at ordinary minimum flow for 24 hours on sites where 

2 / 

measurements or careful estimates have been made.— In other 
words, Alberta has not, as yet, developed one-fourth of her 
minimum water-power possibilities. 

Based on the figures presented in Table 7 it may be seen 
that while hydraulic stations have only 46.39 per cent of the

total installed horse power capacity, they produced 56.15 
per cent of the total electrical energy. It will also be 
noticed that as between steam and diesel plants, the diesel 
is relatively small having only 3.18 per cent of the total 
installed capacity. Diesel-engine plants are found princi¬ 
pally in towns and villages where the demand for electrical 
power is small. 


Manufacturing 

Manufacturing, the second ranking industry in Alberta, 
is principally concerned with the processing of the natural 
resources of the province. The importance of the livestock 
industry is reflected in the position occupied by slaughter¬ 
ing and meat packing which from the point of view of the per¬ 
centage of the total for all leading industries leads in capi¬ 
tal invested, persons employed and net value of production, the 
figures for these three categories being equally high as pre¬ 
sented in Table 8. Butter and cheese making, although much 
more decentralized, presents much the same picture as slaughter¬ 
ing and meat packing but on a reduced scale. Here also is found 
a pattern of near equality in regard to the percentage of total 
capital used, persons employed and net value of production. A 
quite different view is presented on examination of the petrol¬ 
eum products industry. With a relatively large capital invest¬ 
ment representing 8.89 per cent of the total, it was responsible 
for 13.09 per cent of the total net value of production while 
employing only 3.32 per cent of the total persons employed in 
all leading industries.

Flour and feed mills, breweries and the miscellaneous 
group, of which sugar refining is the principal one, show a 
high capital investment compared to the net value of the pro¬ 
duct while at the same time employing relatively few persons. 

In contrast to the above mentioned industries, bread and baking 
products, printing and publishing, men’s factory clothing and 
planning mills and sash and door factories employ greater num¬ 
bers of persons in relation to the amount of capital invested 
and to the net value of production. The manufacture of railway 
rolling stock ranks relatively high in the amount of capital 
invested and in the number of employees but is low in the net 
value of the product. The remaining industries listed in the 
Table are on the whole small and show a rather balanced pattern 
in regard to the points previously compared. 

The last two columns in the Table attempts a comparison 
of the productivity of the different industries of the Province. 
The second last column represents the amount of capital required 
per employee for the leading industries of Alberta. The last 
column shows the productivity of the worker in terms of net 
production. It would appear that the most desirable type of 
industry for a comparatively new country such as Alberta would 
be one which had a high net value of product per employee while 
at the same time having a low capital investment per employee. 
This "ideal" industry would be especially beneficial from the 
standpoint of employment offered, in that additional capital 
invested would tend to increase the number of workers more than 
proportionately. 

On a small scale the fruit and vegetable preparations in¬ 
dustry comes closest to the "ideal” industry in Alberta. Table 8

reveals a low capital investment per employee with a moder¬ 
ately high net production per person employed for this in¬ 
dustry, The manufacturing of petroleum products illustrates 
an industry where a large capital investment per employee is 
combined with a high degree of productivity per employee. 

This industry is naturally suited to large scale operations 
involving large capital sums but requiring a relatively small 
labor force. The amount of capital per employee as shown by 
the Table does not, however, take into consideration the 
costs of proving the oil area. The addition of such sums would 
in most cases materially increase the capital invested per 
employee figure. Another group of industries, of which saw¬ 
mills is an example, show a low capital investment and a low 
net value per employee. In the case of sawmills, the mills 
in Alberta are usually small and make use of a relatively large 
amount of manual labor combined with a limited amount of machinery 
Although employing large numbers relative to the capital in¬ 
vested, sawmills offer only seasonal work in the main. Industries 
with a high capital investment per employee but with only a 
moderate return per employee may be illustrated in the case of 
breweries and flour and feed mills. In both these industries, 
and especially so in the case of breweries, a large plant is 
required for economical production of the product. Both in¬ 
dustries are capable of a fair degree of raechanization and this 
along with the large plant makes for a relatively high capital 
investment and for a relatively small number of employees#

Comparison with Other Provinces, 1941 

1/ 

Agriculture 

The leading branch of agricultural production in Canada 

2 / 

in 1940 was the growing of field crops which accounted for 

3/ 

over 50 per cent of the gross value of all fam produce. 

Although this group was also the most important one in each of 
the provinces, it had a rather wide range of importance. For 
example, in Saskatchewan field crops were responsible for 
about 75 per cent of all agricultural production while in British 
Columbia they produced only one-third of the total. In Prince 
Edy/ard Island, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Alberta, they con¬ 
tributed over 50 per cent of all agricultural products and 
slightly less than 50 per cent for Nova Scotia, Quebec and 
Ontario. The Alberta figure was roughly 65 per cent which put 
that province next to Saskatchewan in the importance of field 
crops in the agricultural economy. 

Fam animals ranked second in Canada and second in all 
provinces with the exception of Nova Scotia and British Columbia 
where they were third and fifth respectively. Their relative 
importance was greatest in Ontario where approximately £7 per cent 
of agricultural production was due to the raising of farm animals, 
and least in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and British Columbia, 
where they contributed about 13 per cent. Over one-fifth of 

l/Canada Year Book 1943-44. p. £14. 

£/The year 1940 was chosen for agriculture production for reasons 
previously stated. See page 13. 

3/The gross value figures submitted make no distinction as 

between crops sold or those used as materials for other kinds 
of production such as feeding of livestock.

Alberta’s agricultural production came from the raising of 
farm animals, principally hogs and cattle, placing Alberta 
next to Ontario in this important branch. 

Milk production ranked third in Canadian totals for 1940 
and it attained substantially the same position in all the 
provinces except Nova Scotia where it stood second. Its re¬ 
lative importance was greatest in Quebec, Nova Scotia, Ontario 
and British Columbia in that order, where the range was 16 
per cent to 20 per cent of the total agricultural production. 

Its relative importance was least in Prince Edward Island, 
Alberta and Saskatchewan where production ranged from 6 per 
cent to 9 per cent of the total production. Alberta produced 
milk to the amount of roughly 7 per cent of her total agricul¬ 
tural production. 

Listed fourth in importance for Canada was the production 
of poultry products. This position held for all the provinces 
with the exception of Nova Scotia where it ranked fifth, below 
fruit and vegetable production. About 13 per cent of British 
Columbia’s agriculture production was due to poultry products 
with Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and New Brunswick each show¬ 
ing around 8 per cent attributable to this source. In Saskat¬ 
chewan and Alberta poultry products v/ere of least relative im¬ 
portance, the figures being roughly 4 per cent for the former 
and 3.5 per cent for the latter* 

The production of fruit and vegetables came fifth on the 
list of Canada’s agricultural crops. It also ranked fifth in

New Brunswick:, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta. In British Columbia, with its famed Okanagan and 
Kootenay fruit valleys, this was the second most important 
crop while it placed fourth in Nova Scotia. This group pro¬ 
duced nearly 25 per cent of British Columbia’s total agri¬ 
culture products and roughly 13 per cent of Nova Scotia’s, 
where production is centered in its well-known Annapolis valley. 

The aggregate gross value of fruit and vegetable production was 
highest in Ontario and next highest in Quebec but the propor¬ 
tion of the total production was only around 5 per cent to 6 
per cent in each case. Alberta produced these products, prin¬ 
cipally vegetables, to the amount of not quite 2 per cent of 
the total agricultural production. 

Tobacco growing held sixth position in Canada as a whole 
but its culture is confined to three provinces, namely, Ontario, 
Quebec and British Columbia. Of the total production, Ontario 
raised about 84 per cent, Quebec about 15 per cent and British 
Columbia slightly less than 1 per cent. This crop, however, 
constituted but 2.8 per cent of Ontario’s total agriculture 
production and less than 1 per cent of Quebec’s. 

The remaining agricultural products were of varying im¬ 
portance in the different provinces. Fur farming ranked seventh 
in Ontario and Saskatchewan and stood eighth in Quebec. In 
Alberta the fur farms produced slightly less than fl,000,000 in 
1940. However, for 1942 Alberta was the leading fur producer 
of Canada accounting for over one-fifth of the total Canadian 
production. Maple products were produced in Nova Scotia, New Bruns¬ 
wick, Quebec and Ontario, with over three-quarters of the total

coming from Quebec* Clover and grass seed is mainly culti¬ 
vated in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Manitoba, and British 
Columbia with the first three named responsible for the bulk 
of the crop. Ontario leads in the production of honey and wax 
with Saskatchewan, Quebec, Manitoba and Alberta following in 
that order* Wool production is centered in Ontario, Alberta 
and Quebec where 70 per cent of the crop is produced. Alberta’s 
clip amounted to roughly 23 per cent of the Dominion’s total* 

A well-balanced farm economy has a stabilizing influence 
on farm income and is particularly to be desired in a country 
such as Canada where agriculture ranks as the second leading 
industry* As might be expected from the older more populous 
provinces, agriculture has attained a voider degree of diver¬ 
sification than is shown by the newer prairie provinces. 

Quebec has the best-balanced farm economy of any of the 
provinces. Here field crops led with slightly over 40 per cent 
of the total, followed by farm animals with 22 per cent, milk 
production with about 20 per cent and maple products, fur farm¬ 
ing and tobacco raising making up practically all of the remain¬ 
ing production. 

The agricultural production of each of the Maritime pro¬ 
vinces shows a somewhat similar pattern. Nova Scotia has a 
better balance than either of the other tv© provinces. Field 
crops produced a little over 40 per cent of the total, while 
milk production, farm animals, fruit and vegetables and poultry 
products accounted for over 50 per cent. Both in Prince Edward 
Island and New Brunswick field crops were responsible for well

over one-half of the total production, contributing 63 per 
cent and 56 per cent, respectively. Farm animals, milk products 
and poultry constituted the bulk of the remainder in the case 
of Prince Edward Island, while the above along with the fruit 
and vegetables made up nearly all New Brunswick’s remaining 
production. 

Ontario’s agriculture is fairly well diversified with field 
crops contributing about 40 per cent of the total and farm 
animals bringing in nearly 30 per cent. Milk production reali¬ 
zed about one-sixth of the total and poultry products about 
one-half of that amount. Fruit and vegetables and tobacco 
raising together were valued at around 10 per cent of total pro¬ 
duction. 

Of the three prairie provinces, Manitoba showed the best 
balance, being less dependent on field crops than either Saskat¬ 
chewan or Alberta. However, the production patterns of Mani¬ 
toba and Alberta were very similar. The respective figures 
for the two provinces were: field crops 60 per cent, 65 per cent; 
farm animals 20 per cent, 21 per cent; milk 10 per cent, 9 per 
cent; with the remaining production very evenly balanced. 
Saskatchewan showeda very high percentage of agricultural pro¬ 
duction due to field crops ( 75 per cent). Farm animals pro¬ 
duced 13 per cent, milk roughly 7 per cent, poultry products 
and fruit and vegetables nearly all the remainder. 

British Columbia’s agricultural production is comparatively 
small for so large a province. This is explained by the mountain¬ 
ous nature of the province as a whole and the large area covered 
by forests which results in a relatively small amount of land

suitable for agricultural purposes. In spite of the small 
production, it shows a good balance as between the different 
groups. Field crops make up about one-third of the production, 
fruit and vegetables around one-quarter, milk and poultry- 
products about one-seventh each, and farm animals over one- 
ninth.

Mining 

Canadian mineral production in 1941 attained an all-time 
high of over $560,000,000 gross, an increase of over $30,000,000 
compared with the previous year. Ontario has since 1907 been 
the leading mineral-producing province in the Dominion and in 
recent years has contributed approximately 50 per cent of the 
total. This was true of 1941 when Ontario 1 s total mineral 
production was nearly $270,000,000 or about 48 per cent of the 
Canadian total. The metallics group, principally, gold, nickel 
and copper, was responsible for the larger part of the Ontario 
production. Gold, lead, zinc, copper and silver were the main 
minerals produced in British Columbia which ranked next to 
Ontario in this group. Quebec followed British Columbia in 
the extraction of metallic minerals with production of gold 
and copper being greatest. Manitoba and Saskatchewan came next 
in the order named, their contribution being mainly copper, gold 
and zinc. Alberta*s production of metallics was negligible, 
amounting to a mere $8,285, in the form of gold. 

The production of fuels in 1941 for all of Canada was 
valued at over $85,000,000 of which Alberta produced nearly

$39,000,000 or about 46 per cent, the highest of any of the 
provinces. Coal, crude petroleum and natural gas were the 
principal fuels making up Alberta’s total. Nova Scotia was 
the second largest fuel producer, with coal as the sole fuel 
mined. Ontario, third on the fuel list, produced small quan¬ 
tities of natural gas and crude petroleum. It is interesting 
to note that for 12 million M cubic ft. of natural gas, Ontario 
received $2,000,000 more than did Alberta for 30 million M cubic 
feet. Apart from six and one-half millions of dollars worth of 
coal mined in British Columbia, the value of fuels produced by 
the remaining provinces was very small. 

Quebec lead in the production of non-metallics, other than 
fuel, and in other industrial minerals. Of the Canadian total, 
Quebec was responsible for 70 per cent and of this amount, 
asbestos contributed about 90 per cent. Ontario with salt and 
quartz, Nova Scotia with gypsum and salt, and British Columbia 
with sulphur and peat moss followed in that order. Saskatchewan 
had a substantial production of sodium sulphate, while the 
Alberta total was made up almost exclusively of salt from Water¬ 
ways in which the production was second only to Ontario. 

Ontario and Quebec with two thirds of the Canadian total 
are predominant in the production of clay products. Bricks, 
structural tile and sewer pipes are their principal products. 
Alberta ranked next to the two leading provinces producing 
about 12 per cent of the Canadian total, mainly in the foim of 
pottery, sewer pipes, bricks,'and structural tile. British 
Columbia and Nova Scotia each produced a little better than one- 
half of Alberta’s total; British Columbia specializing in fire-

brick and sewer pipes, while Nova Scotia concentrated on mainly 
sewer pipe, and brick. 

Other structural materials, consisting of chiefly cement, 
lime, sand and gravel and stone, were produced in Ontario and 
Quebec to the extent of three-quarters of the Dominions total. 
Alberta followed British Columbia and Manitoba in this group, 
being responsible for slightly over 4 per cent of the total. 
Alberta produced mostly cement, with sand and gravel and lime 
following in that order. 

In comparing Alberta with the other provinces in total 
mineral production, it is clear that Alberta’s 1941 position 
as fourth-ranking producer was due to her fuel resources which 
are the largest yet discovered in Canada. 

u 

Electric Power 

The generation of electrical energy in Canada is largely 
centered in the central provinces of Quebec and Ontario where 
in 1941 over 80 per cent of all electrical power was produced. 

The leading position of Quebec in this field can be seen from 
the fact that 53.£8 per cent of all electrical energy generated 
in 1941 was from this province. This production came from 
slightly under 50 per cent of the total installed equipment in¬ 
cluding auxiliary plants and was practically all hydro power. 

The reasons for this large hydro-electrical power production 
were mainly, the location of the pulp wood industry near the 
power sites and the export of power to nearby Ontario industries.

Ontario ranking next to Quebec, produced 28.92 per cent 
of tbe total electrical energy for Canada with 27.86 per cent 
of the total power equipment. Here, as in Quebec, with no 
coal mined in the Province and the large power site at Niagara 
Palls near at hand, hydro-electric power generation seemed the 
solution to part of the fuel shortage. As a consequence prac¬ 
tical! y all the power generated in Ontario is hydro. Alberta, 
on the other hand, with very large coal fields spread through¬ 
out the province and with a comparatively small industrial de¬ 
velopment, has not had the same necessity for the development 
of her water-power resources. Ms in 1941, Alberta produced 
only 0.96 per cent of the total electrical energy of the Domin¬ 
ion from 1.99 per cent of the total plant equipment. Only 
Prince Edward Island with 0.04 per cent and Saskatchewan with 
0.59 per cent produced less electrical energy than Alberta. 

i/ 

Manufacturing 

Ontario and Quebec are by far the most important manufactur¬ 
ing provinces in Canada. Their combined production in 1941 
amounted to $4,963,000,000 or over 81 per cent of the gross 
value of manufactured products of the Dominion "The proximity 
of Ontario to the coal fields of Pennsylvania, the water power 
and other varied resources of the two provinces, and their near¬ 
ness to the larger markets of Canada and the United States have 

2 / 

all contributed to the above result."

The statistics show that in all industrial groups in 
1941, with the exception of the textiles, where Quebec held 
the lead, Ontario lead in the value of gross production. In 
the wood and paper products group, British Columbia made a 
creditable showing but the production there only amounted to 
approximately 50 per cent of that of either Ontario or Quebec. 

The animal products group was the most important in 
Alberta in respect of gross value of product and ranked second 
in the amount of capital invested and in the number of em¬ 
ployees. For all of Canada, Alberta's animal products group 
ranked fourth in gross production, slightly under Manitoba, 
and fifth in the capital investment and in the number of employ¬ 
ees. 

The manufacture of vegetable products ranked second in 
Alberta for value of gross production, first in the capital in¬ 
vested and third in the number of employees. The Alberta in¬ 
dustry stood fifth in Canada for gross production and capital 
investment and sixth in the numbers of employees. Again the 
Alberta position came only slightly under that of Manitoba 
except for the numbers of workers where Manitoba exceeded Alberta 
by about one-third. 

Third ranking position in Alberta in the value of gross 
production and in capital invested was held by non-metallic 
mineral products. This group, made up chiefly of petroleum re¬ 
fining, was fifth, however, in the number of employees. The 
Alberta gross production ?/as only slightly under that of Nova 
Scotia which followed the two leading producers, Ontario and 
Quebec. Alberta ranked fifth in the capital invested and third

in the number of workers. 

For the remaining industrial groups, textiles and textile 
products, wood and paper products, iron and its products, non- 
ferrous metal products, chemicals and allied products, Alberta 
stood in seventh position in nearly every instance, ranking 
ahead of Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan and below Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick and Manitoba. 

Manufacturing in Alberta tends to be carried on in re¬ 
latively small establishments, there being only three plants 

i j 

in the province employing over 500 persons. Quebec showed the 
highest degree of concentration in 1941 with nearly 44 per cent 
of all workers in establishments employing 500 or more persons. 
Alberta had a concentration of roughly IS per cent, about one- 
half that of Manitoba. 

Ontario, with a manufacturing production about equal to 
the remainder of Canada, had the most diversified group of 
manufactured products. Notable among the capital goods pro¬ 
duced were automobiles, agricultural and other machinery, and 
electrical apparatus. Branch factories of many large United 
States industries have been located there, e.g., automobiles, 
vegetable food products, etc. 

The manufactures of Quebec, the second leading industrial 
province, were more specialized than thoseof Ontario and 
manufacturing establishments on the whole were larger in size.

Among the leading industries were, pulp and paper, non- 
ferrous metal smelting, textiles, tobacco, and boots and 
shoes, all of which lend themselves well to large scale pro¬ 
duction. 

The third ranking manufacturing province, British Columbia, 
had a widely diversified production based chiefly on her 
forests, fisheries, agricultural lands and mineral resources. 

The wood industries, including sawmilling, pulp and paper and 
planning mills, were outstanding here. Shipbuilding and repairs 
has greatly expanded since 1940 and in 1941 ranked as the second 
manufacturing industry. Fish-curing and packing, slaughtering 
and meat packing, petroleum refining and fruit and vegetable 
preparations all made important contributions to the industrial 
output of British Columbia. 

Nova Scotia was the leading manufacturing province in the 
maritimes, and. primary iron and steel, fish-curing and pack¬ 
ing and shipbuilding and repairs were her principal industries. 
New Brunswick’s manufactures were largely centred on the pro¬ 
ducts of her extensive forests, pulp and paper and sawmilling 
being in the lead. Prince Edward Island processed principally 
agriculture and fishery products. 

Of the three prairie provinces, Manitoba showed the high¬ 
est degree of diversification in manufacturing. As a distribut¬ 
ing centre for the West a number of allied manufacturing in¬ 
dustries have grown up in support of its commercial activities. 
However, the manufacture of agriculture products predominated 
with slaughtering and meat packing and butter and cheese lead¬ 
ing all industries in the gross value of production. Other

important industries were railway rolling stock, flour and 
feed mills, factory clothing and chemical pit)ducts. Saskat¬ 
chewan concentrated on the manufacture of agriculture prod¬ 
ucts. Petroleum refining using Alberta crude oil has been 
a recent development. An automobile assembly plant and one 
for non-ferrous metal smelting helped somewhat in expanding 
the manufacturing total. Alberta, although not showing quite 
the same degree of diversification as Manitoba, manufactured 
a much wider range of products than did Saskatchewan. Besides 
having industries which are common to all three prairie provinces 
such as slaughtering and meat packing, butter and cheese, flour 
and feed mills, and others whose products are consumed within 
small local areas, e.g., bread and bakery products, Alberta 
manufactured petroleum products, sugar beets, glass and clay 
products and fruit and vegetable preparations, most of which 
are not manufactured in the other two provinces. 

Trends in Alberta Production 

Agriculture 

In setting out the trends of production in agriculture in 
Alberta during the last ten years we must keep in mind the fact 
that agricultural prices during the early thirties were badly 
depressed as a result of the slow down of all productive activity 
The returns from agricultural products during this term of 
years were very low as compared to other branches of production 
where prices could be supported somewhat by curtailing output. 
Therefore, rather than tracing the value of production during

this period, a fairer method would indicate using the volume 
of production as a measure of comparison. 

The total acreage under cultivation in Alberta has shown, 
with minor reductions in 1934 and 1935, a steady increase from 

i/ 

1930 to 1941. There has been added in each of these years 
new land to the extent of about 300,000 acres per year. During 
this period a movement away from sub-marginal lands of the brown 
soil zone has been taking place. New lands coming under culti¬ 
vation seem to be concentrated more in the older settled regions 

2 / 

rather than in the fringe areas, census divisions VI, I and X 
showing the largest increases. 

Acres cropped to wheat, the principal field ciop, ha^ shown 
only minor variations during this period. The largest acreage 
sown to wheat was in 1940 when a good crop year yielded the 
largest wheat crop in the Province’s history. Areas seeded to 
oats have remained fairly constant but barley acreage has been 
greatly expanded, a sharp rise starting in 1935 has doubled the 
cultivated area sown to this cereal. This spectacular increase 
can be traced to the decided concentration on hog production, 
particularly since the outbreak of the War. Rye production has 
shown no material changes, but since 1937 the area under flax¬ 
seed has increased, a big jump in the acreage showing in 1941 
with another material rise coming in 1942, both due to increased 
demands for T #ar purposes. 

l/Figures used in tracing the trends of agricultural production 
are taken from: Agricultural Statistics of Alberta . Department 
of Agriculture, 1943. 

2/While the aggregate increase in acres appears to have been 
greater in established areas, the fringe areas show the larger 
relative increase.

Potato production has declined slightly due to a small 
reduction in the acreage in crop. There has been a steady 
increase in sugar beet growing, the area cultivated in 1930, 
14,500 acres having risen to 27,600 acres in 1942. Other 

nosrt-Y 

field crops showing material increases/vsince the outbreak of 
war are; field peas from 1,300 acres in 1930 to 16,000 in 
1942; beans, an increase of 2000 acres; mixed grains an in¬ 
crease of nearly five times the 1930 figure and alfalfa a rise 
of over five times the 1930 acreage. 

The raising of livestock is a very important branch of 
agriculture in Alberta and the general trend seems to indi¬ 
cate that an increasing emphasis will be laid upon it. Apart 
from a gradual reduction in the horse population due to the 
introduction of power machinery, all other forms of livestock 
are on the increase. The cattle population was at its lowest 
point since 1915 in 1931 but a gradual increase occurred from 
then until 1935 when a decrease again set in lasting until 
1939. Cattle marketings ¥/ere comparatively low during the 
early depression years, but reached their highest point in the 
last twenty years in 1936. The marketings in 1940, 1941 and 
1942 reveal minor gains over 1939. The production of hogs is 
closely related to the prevailing prices for an alternative 
use for certain coarse grain crops. This fact is reflected 
in the large upsurge in swine production in 1931 and 1932 when 
compared with 1930, an increase of over 100 per cent W && 
recorded. During these years the prices of coarse grains 
were abnormally low and as a result the grain was marketed in 
the form of hogs. Except for 1936 hog production fell until

the first year of the war when a sharp rise came about. Since 
then, under the stimulus of rising prices and war demands, 
production has grown sensationally. Sheep production has shown 
only minor ups and downs since 1930 but the effect of doubling 
of the price of wool by a set Government price has been to 
bring about greater expansion in the raising of sheep (the 
numbers of sheep rose from 702,500 in 1941 to 828,000 in 1942). 

The dairying industry has shown steady progress since 
1930 with only one slight set-back in 1939. Creamery butter 
production effected a remarkable rise from 1930 to 1942, a 
period in which a gain of over 100 per cent was attained from 
virtually the same number of operating creameries. Factory 
cheese production presents an even more spectacular picture 
than that of creamery butter. In this interval an expansion 
in the number of cheese factories from 10 to 20 resulted in 
a four-fold increase in the cheese output. Ice cream output 
has risen from 542,000 gallons in 1939 to 930,000 gallons in 
1942, an increase of over 70 per cent. 

Egg production has been expanding since 1939 and in 1942 
production was highest in the Province’s history, although the 
numbers of laying hens were less than in all but one year of 
the 1920’s. Scientific poultry farming resulting in a high¬ 
er production per bird was responsible for the better show¬ 
ing of recent years. For the ten-year period ending in 1931 
the average production per hen was 83.6 eggs per year while 
in the ten-year period ending in 1942 the average production 
was 101.8 eggs per year.

Shorn-wool production in Alberta reached an all-time 
high in 1942 when 442,800 sheep yielded 3,720,000 lbs. of 
wool. There has been an increase in the number of sheep 
shorn since 1939 although the 1942 figure is still under that 
of 1932 when 488,100 sheep were clipped. A tendency toward 
better yields per sheep is evidenced in the increase in the 
average weight per fleece. For the years 1933-37 the aver¬ 
age weight was 7.6 lbs. per fleece while for the years 1938- 
1942 the average yield was 8.1 lbs. per fleece. 

A remarkable growth has taken place in the apiary in¬ 
dustry. The number of beekeepers has risen from 4,450 to 
27,500. Production of honey and wax per hive varies greatly 
depending on weather conditions and therefore, the average 
production per hive shows considerable variation. The in¬ 
crease in total production is due to the additional hives 
brought into use. 

Fur farming showed steady progress in Alberta up until 
1937 when there were 587 farms in operation. The following 
two years saw a big increase, the number of farms rising to 
822. With the outbreak of war prices declined and a number 
of marginal producers were forced out of business, but not¬ 
withstanding these circumstances, the Alberta industry showed 
small gains in 1940 and 1941.

The value of minerals produced in Alberta was f30,427,742

has shown a steady increase reaching an all-time high of 
$47,359,811 in 1942. Due to the limitations imposed on the 
comparison of production of different years by means of value 
we shall again use the volume of production as a means of 
measurement. 

Starting with the fuels which constitute the principal 
mineral group in Alberta, we find that that group as a whole 
has shown steady progress since the early thirties. 

Goal, the most important mineral in the province, has 
risen from a low production of 4,564,015 tons in 1931 to 7,754,153 
tons in 1942. Most of the increase has been registered since 
the outbreak of war, 1942 production being 40 per cent greater 
than that of 1939. An indication of the general trend of coal 
production in Alberta may be obtained from the Canadian indexes 

u 

of volume of mineral production. Using 1926 as 100, the 1931 
output v/as 74.3, the 1936 production 92.4 and the 1942, 114.5. 

As Alberta produces a large share of the Dominions coal these 
figures give a good view of the trends of Alberta production. 

Although coal production has been increasing it came from 
fewer mines. From 1930 through to 1942 there has been a grad¬ 
ual reduction in the number of mines operating. While the 
number of large mines (over 200,000 tons production per year) 
have been increasing and the number of medium-sized mines 
(100,000-200,000 tons per year) have remained about constant, 
the small mines (under 1000 tons per year) have been decreasing 
in numbers since 1933. Employment in the coal mining industry

has fallen also; the number of workers dropped from 8,889 
in 1930 to 6^040 in 1942. Mining efficiency has improved due 
to a greater concentration within the industry. The number 
of tons of coal mined per man underground in 1930 was 871 as 
against 1^322 in 1942. 

Strip-mining, carried on to a limited extent prior to 
the war, has been encouraged by government assistance. This 
practice, although mining coal with a minimum of labor, must 
of necessity be confined to low grade coals found close to the 
surface. No extensive development of this method is to be 
expected because the coal is not of a nature suited to trans¬ 
portation any considerable distance. 

Production of natural gas has been increasing since 1934; 
the 1942 volume was over 130 per cent greater than in 1934. 
During the 1930's repressuring of the depleted Bow Island field 
was carried on by using waste gas from Turner Valley and this 
field now serves as a reserve, along with the Foremost field, 
for use in case of interruption to service in the Calgary- 
Lethbridge pipeline. At Steveville, 100 miles east of Calgary, 
large gas flows were obtained from three wells drilled in 1939. 
This field is being further explored. 

Farther north, the Viking field, which supplies Edmonton, 
has reserves of gas sufficient for some years to come. The 
Kinsella field, 10 miles east of the Viking area, has been 
out-lined by three wells. This field has not been drawn on 
but its reserves of gas, estimated to be much greater than those 
originally existing at Viking, form a reserve which vdll be

Petroleum production in 1930 was 1,398,160 barrels of 

crude oil while in 1942 a production of 10,117,073 barrels 

1 / 

was realized* Turner Valley has shown steady progress and 
has been responsible for by far the greatest share of the 
oil produced. The number of producing wells in this field 
has increased from 180 in 1939, to 197 in 1942, while during 
the same period the number of wells in other fields increased 
from 21 to 30* 

Production from oil fields outside of Turnery Valley has 
advanced rapidly during the last few years. Notable among 
the new producers are the Vermilion and Taber fields which 
were responsible for the bulk of the oil recovered outside of 
Turner Valley during 1942* An indication of the increase in 
the fields outside of Turnery Valley is shown by the rise in 
output from 78,300 barrels in 1941 to 139,335 barrels in 1942. 
In 1941 production v\ras less than 1 per cent of Turner Valley’s 
total while in 1942 the figure rose to 1.37 per cent. Although 
the difference between Turner Valley and the other fields is 
still considerable, it is significant that the other areas are 
beginning to close the gap. 

In 1930, 2,067 tons of bituminous sands were processed. 
Since that date production rapidly fell off until it was sus-

pended in 1936. Considerable development work has been carried 
on since 1936 and in 1941 production was resumed at the 
Abasand plant at McMurray. A fire in the winter of 1941-42 
caused a delay but production was resumed by midsummer of 1942. 
From then until the end of November 11,156 tons of oil sands 
were mined from which 10,041 barrels of crude oil were recovered. 
Technical difficulties in the extraction process coupled with 
remoteness from consuming markets have tended to bring this 
resource along rather slowly. Hov/ever, developments of recent 
years hold out the possibility of a rapid, utilization of these 
oil-rich sands. 

Starting in 1925 salt was produced on a commcercial basis 
near McMurray from a well which had been originally drilled 
for oil. Transportation difficulties developed and after a 
period of three year^ operation the plant was closed. In 1938 
production of salt was resumed at Waterways where a plant was 
erected adjacent to the railway. From a production of 4,045 
tons in 1938 the quantity of salt mined has risen rapidly until 
a record total of 22,360 tons was reached in 1942. The Water¬ 
ways field is estimated at 500,000 tons to the acre and explor¬ 
atory wells have proven a considerable area close to the rail¬ 
way. Expansion here will be limited only by the effective demand. 

The production of clay products was very adversely affect¬ 
ed by the economic depression for they are closely allied to 
the construction industry. Generally, production was relatively 
high in 1930 but dropped drastically until the low point was

reaCxhed in 1933. Since then recovery was gradual until 1940 
following which time substantial increases were recorded due 
to the demands of construction for war purposes. A few com¬ 
parative figures will show the general trend of production; 
common brick (soft mud process) 1930—7,298 M, 1935--3,087 M, 
1940—3,275; common brick (dry press) 1930—10,886 M, 1935— 
4,806 M, 1940—7,292 M; hollow blocks, 1930—13,123 M, 1935— 
3,022 M, 1940—5,437 M; drain tile, 1930—48 M, 1935—52 M, 
1940—269 M. It may be seen , from the few items listed 
that the 1940 figure has not in most cases reached the volume 
of production of 1930. The apparent slow recovery of brick 
making may be explained by the tendency to substitute rein¬ 
forced concrete and concrete blocks for bricks. Glazed and 
unglazed pottery has increased sharply since 1939 when the 
value of production just passed the 1930 amount. The figures, 
unadjusted for changing price levels, are; 1930—fl67,402; 
1939-$180,017 ; 1942—#476,183. 

Cement production in 1942 passed the previous high volume 
recorded in 1931. Lime has with minor dips shown progressive 
increases, production in 1942 being over 3 times that of 1930. 
Sand and gravel production has shown wide variations since 
1930. An output of 1,626,989 tons in 1930 fell to a low of 
281,122 tons in 1933 and then rose to a high of 1,722,465 tons 
in 1940. Production fell off greatly in 1942 when only 481,644 
tons were produced.

Electric Power 

The generation of electrical energy in Alberta has been 
increasing sinfie 1931. This is to be expected for during this 
period population has increased and new industries using power 
have started up. However, an increase of over 100 per cent has 
been recorded in the production of electrical energy from 1931 
to 1942. Although it is true that the Alberta domestic service 
consumption per customer has risen from 518 kw. hours per annum 
in 1931 to 657 kw. hrs in 1941 it is also apparent that the 
greater part of this increased consumption has resulted from 
uses other than domestic service. War conditions have made 
extra demands for electricity in Alberta as well as in other 
provinces and it may well be that a substantial part of this 
increased use of electricity is due to these circumstances. 

The generation of hydro-electric power in Alberta goes 
back to a period prior to the beginning of this century but 
it was not until 1911 that the first large installation took 
place. In May of that year the Horseshoe Falls Plant on the 
Bow River, 55 miles west of Calgary was brought into operation 
with a capacity of 20,000 h.p. The following year the Kananaski 
Falls Plant, two miles west of the Horseshoe Falls Plant, with 
a capacity of 12,000 h.p. was completed and started operations. 
No more large installations were made until 1929 when. the 
Ghost River Plant, 32 miles west of Calgary came into pro¬ 
duction with 2 units of 18,000 h.p. capacity each and with 
provision made in the intake works for an additional 18,000 h.p. 
unit.

The latest hydro-installation in Alberta was the Cas¬ 
cade Plant, near Anthracite, 5 miles east of Banff which 
began producing in 1942 with a single 23,000 h.p. unit. 

Water for this plant comes from Lake Minnewanka by way of a 
control dam and pumping station. There is a head of 340 feet 
of water at this plant. 

Solid concrete gravity type dams were constructed at the 
Horseshoe Falls Plant and at the Kananaski Falls Plant when 
these two plants were built. The G-host River Plant was pro¬ 
vided with a storage reservoir of 2,866 acres capable of im¬ 
pounding 74,000 acre feet of water at the time of its con¬ 
struction. In 1933 a preliminary dam was constructed at the 
Upper Kananskis Lake, which supplied 40,000 acre feet of stor¬ 
age. In 1942 the final dam was completed at this point which 
made available 96,000 acre feet of water for the low water 
period. 

Other indications of the growth of hydro-electric power 
in Alberta&re: (1) transmission line mileage increased from 
150 miles in 1925 to 2,051 miles in 1945, (2) centres served 
in 1925 were Calgary, Cochrane and Morley while in 1945, 166 
cities, towns and villages were connected to hydro-electric 

i/ 

transmission lines. 

The number of central electric stations in Alberta gen¬ 
erating electricity from fuel increased from 51 stations in 

2 / 

1931 to 70 stations in 1942.

While there was an increase in the number of steam 
engines, steam turbines and internal combustion engines 
during this interval, from 83 in 1931 to 138 in 1942, the 
average size of the generating unit decreased from 709 
h.p. to 571 h.p. 

A total increase in main-plant equipment of fuel stations 
of only 19,977 h.p. occurred from 1931 to 1942 and of this in¬ 
crease the municipal power plant at Edmonton accounted for a 
large share by installing a new 15,000 h.p. steam turbine in 
1937. Although this 1937 installation at Edmonton replaced in 
part obsolete equipment there was a net increase in the capacity 
of the plant. Even if no other large fuel using power units 
were put into operation during this period the above figures 
show that the average size of the new units installed was re¬ 
latively small. 

Generally speaking the trend of electrical power de¬ 
velopment in Alberta during the period reviewed was toward a 
greater utilization of hydro-electric power. Many places 
formerly generating their own power from fuel have changed 
over to the purchase of hydro-electrical energy for reasons 
of convenience and costs. Most of the new fuel stations open¬ 
ing up during this time have been of a size required to serve 
the needs of small local areas.

merits in Alberta rose from 774 to 1108, an increase of about 
56 per cent. However, during the same span of years the total 
capital invested in manufacturing has shown only a moderate 
increase from #84,405,147 to $95,676,518 or about 13 per cent. 
The net value of production advanced from $40,692,898 in 1930 
to #45,958,219 in 1941. A significant feature during this 
time was the relatively large increase in the cost of materials 
used in manufacturing in 1941 as compared with 1930, In 1942 
the cost of materials was 64 per cent of the gross value of 
production while in 1930 they constituted only 55 per cent. 

As has been pointed out previously the processing of 
agricultural products constitute the larger share of Alberta’s 
manufacturing. Prices of agricultural commodities were gen¬ 
erally higher in 1941 than in 1930 which may partly account 
for the higher cost of materials used in manufacturing in 
1941 as compared to 1930. Notwithstanding the increase in 
prices, the figures seem to indicate a further swing toward 
those manufacturing industries whiph use agricultural pro¬ 
ducts as the main raw material. 

Power equipment installed in manufacturing establish¬ 
ments in Alberta in 1930 amounted to 23,849 h.p., made up 
of 21,434 h.p. in steam engines and turbines, 2,283 h.p. in 
internal combustion engines and 132 h.p. in hydraulic turbines 
and water wheels. For 1941 comparable figures were; 32,269 h.p. 
for steam engines and turbines; 13,987 h.p. for internal 
combustion engines and 12 h.p. for hydro, a total installation 
of 46,268 h.p. The very low hydraulic installations are ex¬ 
plained by reason of the fact that practically all of Alberta’s

hydro-electric power is generated in central electric 
stations. During the period under review the number of elec¬ 
tric motors operated on purchased power or otherwise, rose 
from 45,407 in 1930 to 78,607 in 1940, a gain of 75 per cent. 
However, shifting from belts and shafting to individual motors 
at each machine does not necessarily indicate an increase in 
power used equivalent to the additional motors installed. The 
general shift to a greater use of power equipment is reflected 
in the noticeable growth recorded by it during these years. 

Total power equipment installed nearly doubled from 1930 to 
1941. 

There has been a very gradual increase in the number of 
workers during this period if the decrease due to the de¬ 
pression is disregarded. Total employment in manufacturing 
has risen about 25 per cent during this time; from 13,323 

j 

employees in 1930 to 16,861 in 1941. This growth is about 
what would be expected from a normal increase in the total 
population. An interesting fact is that during these years the 
number of wage earners has shown an advance of only 11 per cent. 
The reverse of this is true in regard to salaries and wages. 
Average salaries paid in 1930 were #1862- as against 11496- 
in 1941, while average wage payments rose from |1080 in 1930 

u 

to #1118- in 1941. The drop in the average salary paid may 
be in part the result of relatively larger numbers of women 
working in salaried positions in 1941 than in 1930 and re¬ 
ceiving lower salaries on the whole than would be paid to men 

1/The 1930 average includes salaries and wages of employees 
of central electric stations, whereas, these are not in 
the 1941 averages.

working in similar positions. 

Slaughtering and meat packing, the leading manufactur¬ 
ing industry in 1930, continued as the leader in 1941, hav¬ 
ing a gross production of over three times the next ranking 
manufacturing industry, The number of establishments advanced 
over 100 per cent (from 6 in 1930, to 13 in 1941), while at 
the same time the number of employees rose from 1,246 to 2,630, 
Petroleum products (gross $14,329,999) moved from third to 
second place and butter and cheese (gross $14,320,370) advanced 
from fourth to third place at the same time increasing the 
number of factories by 13. Sawmills jumped from tenth to fifth 
place on the basis of gross value of production. The number 
of sawmills rose from 96 to 250, employees from 1,447 to 2,196 
but the capital investment from $2,849,762 to only $2,923,893. 

Industries not listed among the leading industries of 
Alberta in 1930, but appearing in 1941, in order of importance 
based on gross value of production, were: clothing, men’s 
factory; planing mills, sash and door factories; aerated 
and mineral waters; castings, iron; printing and bookbinding; 
fruit and vegetable preparations. Besides the above, other 
leading manufacturing plants in 1941 which have either come 
into being since 1930 or have increased production are: malt 
mills, sugar refineries, wood preservation plants, glass and 
cement factories. 

Briefly, during the period under review the following

(1) Manufacturing in Alberta has followed closely 
general economic conditions. The incidence of the depression 
resulted in greatly curtailed output but demands for war pur¬ 
poses and generally improved business activities have acceler¬ 
ated manufacturing production during recent years. 

(2) Manufacturing establishments processing agricultural 
products, e.g. meat packing, butter and cheese, etc., have 
stepped up production greatly since the outbreak of war. 

(3) Manufacturing industries based on forest products 
have also advanced to higher positions since 1930. 

(4) Some new industries have been established and are 
making satisfactory progress. 

(5) One large establishment, the nitrogen plant at 
Calgary, has been set up recently mainly based on the avail¬ 
ability of cheap power and natural gas. This may be the fore¬ 
runner of others who may locate in Alberta for similar and 
other reasons.

II. DISPOSAL OF ALBERTA PRODUCTION 

Alberta’s export and import trade is very difficult to 
measure because there are no man-made barriers to this trade 
movement. As the province is land-locked practically all 
commodity movements to and from it are by rail or by road, 

A relatively small amount of trade is carried on with the 
Northwest Territories by means of the Mackenzie River system 
and by air. 

It must be pointed out that although practically all 
inter-provincial and international commodity movements to and 
from Alberta are handled by common carrier it is practically 
impossible to get accurate figures relating to this movement, 
particularly pertaining to the actual goods moved and the 
quantities of each. The Provincial Government is, through the 
Statistical Branch of the Department of Trade and Industry, 
making a noteworthy effort along this line but many necessary 
figures are only available on a voluntary basis from report¬ 
ing businesses so that noticeable gaps still exist in present¬ 
ing a full picture of Alberta’s external trade. It is with 

dU 

this limiting factor in mind that following discussion is pre¬ 
sented. 

Some measure of the volume of commodity trade can be had 
from the loadings and unloadings of freight carried by the 
railways. Since the early part of the present war inter- 
provincial trucking has been drastically curtailed and this 
would naturally mean that nearly all movement of goods in and

out of the Province would be by rail. 

In 1941 there was 9,502,991 tons of freight loaded at 
Alberta points while in the same year 2,852,735 tons were 

u 

unloaded. This would indicate a much larger tonnage of goods 

moving out of the Province than is brought in. As to the 

value of the goods moving in and out of the Province, it 

might be noted that, in a general way, the exports consist 

of bulky commodities low in value, such as grains, livestock, 

2 / 

coal, etc., while the imports consist of manufactured goods, 
high in value in relation to weight. 

Just what surpluses of commodities does Alberta have 
with which to trade for necessaries which she cannot produce 
herself, or does not as yet? As pointed out in an earlier part, 
Alberta is primarily a producer of goods related to the prim¬ 
ary industries, principally agriculture and mining. It would 
be expected, therefore, that the products of these two industries 
would form the backbone of the Province’s export trade. 

AG-RICULTURAL PRODUCTS 

What is the picture in regard to wheat, the principal 
agricultural product raised and exported? The average annual 
production of wheat in Alberta for the years 1936 to 1942 was 
roughly 130 million bushels. The per capita consumption of wheat 

s/ 

has been estimated to be about 4 bushels, representing a con- 

l/Ganada Year Book 1942 p. 519.. 

2/Due to the large variety of goods imported into Alberta 
no discussion of them will be presented here.

sumption of about 3.2 million bushels by Albertans. Seed 
requirements would be approximately 12 million bushels for the 
average acreage seeded. The amount of wheat consumed by live¬ 
stock can only be roughly approximated but a generous allow- 

y 

ance would probably not exceed 14 million bushels. The amount 
of wheat available for export after making the above deductions 
would be in the neighborhood of 100 million bushels. 

The production of sugar from the sugar beet has made Alberta 
more or less self-sustaining in this very necessary commodity. 
Alberta produced in 1941 over 85 million pounds, assuming a 

LJ 

per capita consumption of 100 pounds, this would leave about 
5 million pounds available for export. 

Alberta 1 s annual potato production from farms averages 
around 2 million hundredweight. This figure, of course, does 
not take into account considerable quantities of potatoes 
raised in small garden plots. A per capita consumption of 
potatoes for 1941 of 201.4 lbs. would require around 1,600,000 
cwt. while potatoes for seed would take nearly 400,000 cwt. No 
estimate of the amount of potatoes fed to stock is available but 
disregarding this factor it may be seen that Alberta produces 

y 

about enough potatoes for her own needs. 


1/This includes an allowance for poultry feed of one bushel of 
wheat per bird for the total poultry population of nearly ten 
millions. In 1942-43 the quantity of wheat fed to livestock 
and poultry was the highest on record amounting to 28 million 
bushel. Of the 1941 'wheat crop about 19| million bushels went 
to feed livestock. 

2/Human consumption estimates used in this section are from the 
Canada Year Book and from Food Consumption Levels, 1944. 

King’s Printer, Ottawa. 

3/This estimate does not take into consideration sweet potatoes 
which are imported to the extent of roughly 4,800 cwt.

Alberta produces a large surplus of livestock, much of 
which is exported in the form of live animals and as meat 

1/ 

and meat products. Computations based on 1941 figures indicate 
that there was available for export from the Province 113 
million pounds of dressed beef, or about three-quarters of the 
total production. Veal available for export after Provincial 
requirements were met would amount to about 4 million pounds 
dressed weight. About 84 per cent of the hogs produced in 
the Province are consumed elsewhere. This exportation amounted 
to the impressive total of about 240 millions of pounds dressed 
weight in 1941. Over one million pounds of dressed mutton and 
lamb were shipped outside of Alberta during the same year. 

About 10 thousand horses were marketed, the majority moving 
to outside points. 

Creamery butter and ice cream are the main dairy pro¬ 
ducts exported from Alberta. Total butter production for 1941 
was approximately 50 million pounds, of which about 35 million 
pounds was creamery butter* Albertans consumed all the dairy 
butter and about 16 million pounds of the creamery butter, 
leaving available for export 19 million pounds of creamery 
butter. Alberta produced an estimated 3^ million pounds of 
factory and dairy cheese. Cheese consumption estimated at 4.3 
pounds per person would require about the same amount as is 
produced. After supplying her own needs Alberta has about 50 
thousand gallons of ice cream available for export, to adjacent 
parts of British Columbia and Saskatchewan.

Poultry production which has expanded greatly during 
the last few years is more than meeting the needs of the 
Province* Total production of chickens, turkies, geese, 
and ducks amounted to nearly 20 million pounds in 1941* 
Consumption at 20 pounds per capita would require about 16 
million pounds for Alberta’s population. This would leave 
available for export about 4 million pounds. Egg production 
also greatly exceeds the Provincial requirements. About 11 
million of the 28 million dozen eggs produced in 1941 were 
marketed outside of the Province. 

Although the production of wool in Alberta has been 
rapidly increasing it is not as yet sufficient to meet the 
needs of Alberta’s population. In 1941 Alberta produced 
3,282,000 pounds of wool and consumed 7,556,000 pounds based 
on a per capita consumption of 9.5 pounds. 

Alberta produces generally a light colored, mild flavored 
honey with a low moisture content. In 1941 the production 
amounted to 3,120,000 lbs. Consumption based on 1.9 lbs. per 

u 

capita, would require 1,512,700 lbs for Alberta. It would 
appear that there is a considerable quantity, about one half 
of the production, available for export. 

MINERALS AND OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES 

One of Alberta’s principal natural resources is the widely 
distributed coal areas of high grade bituminous, serai-bituminous

and lignite coals. Apart from the coal fields of Nova Scotia, 
Alberta is the only province that has coal areas that are 
extensively mined. In fact, Alberta possesses about 87 per 
cent of Canada’s known coal resources. Considerable quantities 
of Alberta coal are exported to the neighboring provinces and 
some find a market as far east as Manitoba and Ontario. There 


have been limited quantities exported to the neighboring states 
to the south. In 1941 the disposition of Alberta coal 'was as

Since the latter part of 1937 Alberta has changed over 
from an importer to an exporter of petroleum. Although some 


imports still enter the Province, exports far exceed imports. 

Oil is sent largely to the neighboring Province of Saskatchewan 
(179 million gallons in 1941) where two large refineries and 
a number of small ones serve that Province and parts of western 
Manitoba. Alberta oil in a refined form is still being shipped 
into the Northwest Territories even though oil production at 
Norman Wells has been greatly increased. 

Large proven fields of natural gas, sufficient to meet 
the future needs of the Province for many years to come, produced

30,905,440 in. cu. ft. in 1941. Except for relatively small 
quantities exported to Montana from the Milk River Area, 
all the Alberta production is utilized within the Province 
mainly for heating purposes. It is also used as a raw material 
in the new nitrogen plant located on the outskirts of Calgary, 
from which considerable quantities of fertilizers are ex¬ 
ported. 

The products of Alberta’s forests are in the main used 
within the Province. Considerable quantities of timber are 
utilized as pit props in coal mines, for telephone poles and 
for railway ties. Although able to meet her requirements of 
certain types of rough lumber and having a small surplus for 
export, Alberta still imports large quantities of lumber, prin¬ 
cipally from British Columbia. 

Alberta lead* the Dominion in the value of furs produced 
in 1942, production accounting for over one-fifth of the Canadian 
total. Some furs are processed and consumed within the Province 
but the larger part is exported as raw fur. 

Commercial Fisheries are relatively small and are con¬ 
fined mainly to the larger lakes of the central and northern 
parts of the Province. The quality of the fish caught is 
excellent and considerable quantities are marketed outside of 
the Province, in fact, special markets have been developed as 
far away as New York and Chicago. Besides providing fresh fish 
for the local markets the fishing industry is important In 
supplying food for fur farms.

MNUEACTURBD GOODS. 

Alberta’s export of manufactured goods are confined 
principally to processed food products, such as, meat, 
flour, sugar, creamery butter and canned vegetables. In 
addition to these commodities a number of others are disposed 
of in vaiying quantities outside of the Province. Expanded 
production of salt at Waterways has resulted in small quan¬ 
tities moving to Saskatchewan and British Columbia. Class 
and pottery products from the Medicine Hat area were disposed 
of for a number of years as follows:

Large quantities of fertilizers from the Calgary plant 
are moving to outside points. Other goods exported in re¬ 
latively small quantities include; men’s and women’s factory 
made clothing, lumber products (sash and doors, etc.), tents 
and awnings, and related textiles, etc.

III. EMPLOYMENT IN ALBERTA 


This section deals with employment in Alberta by in¬ 
dustrial groups based on the 1941 census releases of the 
Dominion Bureau of Statistics. Bor each of the three div¬ 
isions made, i.e., all Alberta, the four largest cities and 
Alberta excluding the four largest cities, two tables are 
presented. The first table in each case gives the numbers of 
gainfully employed persons by industries and the second shows 
the percentages in each industry and in addition the proportion 
of men and women in each individual industry. Relative im¬ 
portance of the industrial groups for total employment, pro¬ 
portion of sexes employed and the importance of certain in¬ 
dustries for female employment are discussed. Outside of the 
cities, employment is weighted heavily in favor of the primary 
industries and in order to give a better picture of the relation¬ 
ships of the other industries to one another the primary group 
has, in the main, been passed over. 


BlgLOIHffNT IN ALL ALBERTA 

The number of gainfully employed persons in Alberta in 
1941 was 308,168, consisting of £67,733 men and 40,435 women 
and constituting about 40 per cent of the total population. 

The leading industry of the province, agriculture, as 
might be expected, provided employment for the most persons, 
there being 145,194 men and £,435 women working at that 
occupation. This constituted 47.81 per cent of all employed 
persons. j^Trad e, including the retail and wholesale branches,

had 21,035 or 9.30 ^er^cent of the total emplo yed^ The 
service group To± ± owed - noxt -with 16.36 per-cent of _all persons 



^ employed.^The position of this group is accounted for by 

the fact that 68.38 per cent of all women employed are employed 

'Trade 

in service industries. %ie was the second ranking group for 
the employment of women and accounted for the slight advantage 
this industry had over manufacturing in total employment. 
Although manufacturing followed agriculture in providing em¬ 
ployment for men it ranked only fourth in total employment for 
the reason given above, namely the concentration of women in 
the service and trade groups. Transportation and communi¬ 
cations ranked next with 6.26 per cent of all persons so em¬ 
ployed. Construction and mining provided employment for 7.20 
per cent of Alberta’s population, practically all of which 
were men. 

Industries requiring muscular strength and endurance are 
naturally the ones in which men are employed to the near ex¬ 
clusion of women. Such industries are easily recognized by' 
an inspection of Table 10 Y/here, with the exception of manu¬ 
facturing and agriculture, the first six listed show that 
less than 5 per cent of the total employed persons were Yeomen. 
While men are employed in all occupations, there are certain 
occupations which are well-suited to the special abilities of 
women. The Table reveals that the service group of industries 
v/as the one where female employment exceeds male, 54.86 per 
cent of all employees in this type of work being women. In two 
sub-classifications of this group, namely, professional and 
personal, the number of women employed were greater than the

number of men (Table 9). The large female make-up of the 
professional group is explained by two professions, teaching 
and nursing, which in the case of teaching is largely composed 
of women and in the case of nursing is almost exclusively 
female. 

Over 70 per cent of personal service was performed by 
women, domestic workers, beauty parlor operations, waitresses, 
etc., accounted for the larger part. 

Nearly one-fifth of all employees in trade groups were 
women, the greater number being in retail trade. This in¬ 
dustry, as was the case with finance, has turned to female 
help to replace workers who have joined the services or have 
taken over the more strenuous war jobs. 

Manufacturing offers a rather limited sphere for women in 
Alberta due to the fact that the leading manufacturing in¬ 
dustries are such that there are relatively few jobs that re¬ 
quire only a small amount of physical exertion. Transportation 
and communications employed women in about 5 per cent of all 
jobs, and practically all as office staff, or as telephone and 
telegraph operators. Very few women work directly in agriculture 
as compared to men although over 6 per cent of all women em¬ 
ployed were in this industry. The construction, fishing, and 
mining industries as was pointed out above, are largely restricted 
to men, there being only 162 women in all three industries in 
1941. 

EMPLOYMENT IN URBAN CENTRES 

Nearly 30 per cent of all gainfully employed persons in 
the larger cities of Alberta in 1941, were in the service in-

dustries, with about equal numbers of men and women in this 
group as 'Table 12 reveals. The importance of the larger 
population centres in the distributive industries is shown by 
the fact that the trade groups were the second largest employers 
of labor (over one-fifth of all workers). Closely following 
was manufacturing which had 16,454 employees, slightly less 
than one-fifth of the total. The concentration of the manu¬ 
facturing industries in these larger centres is brought out 
by the fact that of the 26,637 employees in all manufacturing 
industries, 16,454 were in the four large urban centres. The 
transportation and communications group was the next most im¬ 
portant industry, taking 9,746 workers, or 11.34 per cent of 
all employed persons. Construction with 6,127 employees, the 
primary industries with 4,957, and finance with 3,240 made up 
together, about one-sixth of the total working force. 

Edmonton had the largest force of gainfully employed per¬ 
sons in the province, there being nearly 40,000 in 1941. Meat 
packing plants, garment factories, wood-working factories, 
flour and feed mills, butter and cheese factories, two breweries, 
iron foundries and numerous other manufacturing establishments 
employ over 6,000 men and women. 

As the seat of the provincial government, Edmonton has a 
large number of civil servant employees. The main line of the 
Canadian National Railways passes through Edmonton, a divisional 
point, where round-houses and repair shops engage many men. 

Calgary, a divisional point on the Canadian Pacific Rail¬ 
way, also has railway repair shops and in addition does con-

siderable manufacturing of railway rolling stock at the‘Ogden 
Shops. Large flour mills, meat packing plants, breweries, 
petroleum refineries and a recently built ammonia plant, are 
a few of the large manufacturing industries. Calgary had 36,931 
gainfully employed in 1941. 

Medicine Hat, with a total 4,149 employed persons, special¬ 
izes in flour milling, having the greatest milling capacity of 
any city in Alberta. Two firms are extensively engaged in the 
manufacture of various clay products, and a glass plant is 
located in nearby Redcliff. There is also in operation the 
only flax-crushing plant in Alberta. 

Lethbridge, the southernmost city in the province, has 
among other industrial establishments, a brewery, a flour mill, 
a vegetable canning factory and an oil refinery. The total 
persons gainfully engaged in Lethbridge was 5,976 in 1941. 

Larger cities offer more occupational opportunities for 
women than do the smaller centres and rural areas. Whereas 
in Alberta as a whole, about 13 per cent of all employed persons 
were women, the percentage drops to less than 10 per cent if 
urban centres over 5,000 are omitted. The female employment 
in the larger cities was nearly one-quarter of the total persons 
employed, e.g., Calgary 22 per cent and Edmonton 25 per cent. 

As was shown for the Province as a whole, the service industries 
accounted for largest group of women workers in urban centres; 
5ust about one-half, in this instance. In personal service 64.7 
per cent of all employees were women while the professions had 
57.5 per cent women. Finance followed service in the employ¬ 
ment of women, the 916 women so employed represented 23.3 per

cent of all workers. Trade, especially retail trade, is 
another occupational group in which relatively large numbers 
of women find employment. In this classification nearly one 
out of every four persons was a woman. About 2,000 wornen 
were working in manufacturing plants while in transportation 
and communication there were about 500 female workers. Very 
few city women find employment in the construction or primary 
industries. 

miPLoyivcaNT in rural alberta. 

The primary industries predominate in the employment of 
persons outside of the larger urban centres. Table 14 shows 
that over 70 per cent of all persons were employed in this 
group. The service industries ranked next to the primary 
group. Trade, manufacturing and transportation and communications 
employed about equal number of persons, in each case less than 
5 per cent of the total workers. Construction employees are 
relatively few in non-urban areas and there were only 1,106 
persons employed in finance. 

In 1941 over 75 per cent of all women employed in rural 
Alberta were found in the service industries. Out of a total 
female employment of 20,292, there were i£ ,357 women in this 
industry. The primary group, particularly agriculture, had 
2,398 women employees representing about 12 per cent of all 
females employed. Wholesale and retail trade provided Jobs 
for around 7 per cent of the total female labor force and 
ranked next to the primary group.

IV. LOCATION OF PRODUCTION AND RURAL POPULATION 
WITHIN ALBERTA. 


NATURAL RESOURCES 

Alberta’s chief natural resource is her large area of 
fertile soil. Farm lands of varying productivity stretch 
from the international boundary in the south to roughly the 
56th parallel of north latitude and from the foothills re¬ 
gion of the Rocky Mountains to the border of Saskatchewan. 
Within this general area there are some regions of non¬ 
arable land to be found while outside of it most of the arable 
land lies along the Peace River as far as the Fort Vermilion 
area. 

Moving north from the southern boundary of the province 
the following main types of farming are carried on; ranching, 
south and west of Lethbridge and continuing north in the foot¬ 
hills regions to a point generally west of Calgary, in the 

A 

brown soil zone, east of Calgary extending from Medicine Hat 
north to the 52nd parallel, and in the area west of Grande 
Prairie; grain farming, in many parts of the brown soil zone, 

and in the area between Lethbridge and Calgary; mixed farming, 

¥ 

from Calgary north to Edmonton and continuing to Athabasca, 
from Edmonton east to the Saskatchewan boundary, and in the 
Peace River area; root crops (sugar beets, field peas and 
beans, etc.), in the irrigated areas surrounding Lethbridge 
and around Brooks (east of Calgary).

Forested parts range from the area west of Red Deer 
north to the region north and west of Edmonton. Lumbering 
operations are principally confined to the Rocky Mountains 
Forest Reserve, Timber areas in the northerly parts of the 
province are extensive but very little exploitation has taken 
place as yet. 

Practically all the verities of big game animals native 
to Western Canada are found in the mountain sections of Alberta 
between the international boundary and the area south of G-rande 
Prairie and also in the northern-most parts. Came birds are 
found throughout the province and fur-bearing animals are 
trapped in most of the regions north of Edmonton. 

Whitefish and lake trout are found in commercial quantities 
in most of the larger northern lakes, Lesser Slave, Athabasca, 
Lac La Biche (east of the town of Athabasca), Cold (on the 
Saskatchewan boundary) and Wabamum (west of Edmonton) being 
the main ones. 

Alberta is particularly rich in coal deposits. . Coal is 
found in three distinct layers— the Kootenay, the Belly River 
and the Edmonton formations. The highest grade and the hard¬ 
est coals are found in the mountains, a lower grade in the 
foothills, and a lignite type on the plains. 

Some districts mining coal in^Kootenay formation where 
the best coal is obtained, are^ Crow*s Nest Pass in the 
mountains east of Lethbridge; Canmore, near Banff; Nordegg, 
west of Red Deerjand Mountain Park, south-east of Jasper.

In tJie Belly River formation, where lower grades of coal 
than the mountain coals are found, Lethbridge, Taber (east 
of Lethbridge) and Saunders Greek (west of Red Deer) are a 
few of the principal mining districts. Farther to the east 
in the plains region is found the Edmonton formation, where 
Drumheller, Edmonton and Pembina (west of Edmonton) are coal 
centres. 

Natural gas is widespread. Principal producing fields 
are Medicine Hat, Turner Valley (south-west of Calgary) and 
Viking (south-east of Edmonton). Other gas areas may be seen 
by reference to the accompanying map (Plate I.). 

In Turner Valley, the richest producing oil wells in 
Canada are to be found. Wainwright and Vermilion fields, both 
east of Edmonton, produce a fuel oil suitable for railway use 
and are developing into producers of considerable importance. 
There are numerous other small fields where only limited de¬ 
velopment has taken place as yet. These are located mostly 
in the southern and eastern parts of the province, e.g., Taber, 
Princess (east of Calgary), Red Coulee (Alberta-Montana bound¬ 
ary) and Dina (south of Lloydminster). 

Large deposits of bituminous sands are found in the 
general vicinity of McMurray. From this same area comes all 
of Alberta’s present salt production. 

Building stone is found in many places reaching from 
Lethbridge north to Red Deer and also in the mountain areas 
around Banff and Jasper.

Deposits of limestone, shale, etc. are confined to the 
Rocky Mountain regions while clays are widely scattered, the 
main producing areas being around Medicine Hat, Calgary and 
Edmonton. 

Some of the other minerals found in Alberta are: ben¬ 
tonite, Drumheller and near Jasper Park; copper, west of 
Calgary; alluvial gold on the banks and bars of many of 
the rivers; gypsum, north of Edmonton and north of Jasper; 

I u. 

helttim, from Bow Island gas; iridium, upper waters of Peace 
River; iron, nine miles east of Blairmore; ochre, seventy 
miles north of Edmonton and west of Banff; sodium sulphate, 
east of Edmonton at Birch Lake; talc, west of Banff. 

Water power development at present is confined to the 

Bow River and its tributaries east of Banff. The principal 

* 

rivers where the largest water power sites are available are 
the Slave, Athabasca and the Peace. These sites are, how¬ 
ever, in rather remote areas of the province. Other rivers 
in the province have water power possibilities but in many 
cases dams for impounding water to provide reservoirs for 
storage would be required. 

MAMIEACTURINC CENTRES 

The manufacturing centres shown on the accompanying map 
(Plate II) are arranged in order of the value of net product¬ 
ion for 1942. The size of the black dots are representative 
in a general way of the net production of each place although 
they are not proportional to it. It must be pointed out that 
certain relatively large centres in the province are not shovm

for two main reasons. In the first case, unless the town or 
village had three or more establishments it was not listed 

u 

in the government publication. This provision eliminated 
places such as, Raymond and Picture Butte (sugar refineries) 
and Exshaw (cement) etc. In the second case, a centre may 
have had a relatively large value of gross production but when 
the net production was found the amount was less than f50,000, 
below which figure no places are mapped. For this reason, 
towns like Barrhead, Didsbury, St. Paul and others, do not 
appear. 

The predominating positions in manufacturing held by 
Galgary and Edmonton are quite apparent from a casual in¬ 
spection of our map. It may also be seen that Medicine Hat 
and Lethbridge showed up fairly well but the other points on 
the whole carried on very little manufacturing. Some of the 

leading manufacturing industries of the larger cities have 

2 / 

already been set out. The establishments in the smaller 
centres are mainly producing for local consumption from raw 
materials close at hand. A few representative types of manufactu 
ring found in these places are; flour milling, butter and cheese 
sawmills, planing and sash and door factories, bread and bakery 
products, etc.

zones of the rural population density in 1941. In Table 
15, a further analysis is made, in that population density 
1941, is not only related to soil zones but also to the long¬ 
time average yields occurring within these zones. 

Before proceeding with an interpretation of Plate III 
and Table 15 it might be well to indicate what is mean by 
rural population. The Dominion Census defines rural population, 
as all people who reside outside of incorporated towns, villages 
or hamlets. Strictly speaking Plate III and Table 15 are not 
indicative of a purely rural population, because some un ¬ 
incorporated villages and hamlets are included in the count. 
However, these unincorporated villages and hamlets are few in 
number, and the picture presented is reasonably accurate. 

Soil may affect density of population in two ways; that 
is, by soil texture and soil zone. Soil texture varies from 
sands to clays, and in many parts of the province where moist¬ 
ure is a limiting factor, the texture of the soil determines 
its productivity. Such an area is Acadia Talley, which is a 
clay pocket located in an area of lov? productivity but which 
is reasonably productive. This quality of soil texture as re¬ 
lated to productivity influences density of population in 
localized areas. Data however, have not been gathered on this 
particular phase of rural population density. 

In Alberta there are six broad soil zones, commencing 
from the south-east corner of the Province and moving north 
and west, namely, brown, dark brown, shallow black, black,

transition and grey. Rainfall increases in a north and west¬ 
erly direction and thus has caused each soil zone to be more 
fertile until the black soils are reached. The grey wooded 
soils, however, are less fertile again, not because of lack 
of precipitation, but because of leaching which has not per¬ 
mitted these soils to build up plant foods such as organic 
matter and nitrogen. 

Reference to Plate III indicates that the brown soil 
zone is one of relatively sparse population. Possibly one-- 
third of the entire zone supports a population of less than 
50 persons per township and well over three-quarters of it 
has less than 100 persons per township or 3 persons per section 
of land. It is true, of course, that ranching and extensive 
wheat farming are conducted in this zone because of relatively 
scanty rainfall which has resulted in low and variable pro¬ 
ductivity of the land. This type of agriculture means a low 
density of population. The apparent contradicition to the 
light concentration of population within this zone as shown 
by Municipal District 66 is explained by the fact that the 
greater part of this district is within an irrigated area, 
where the land is capable of supporting a dense farm population. 
The relatively greater yields per acre of this district accounts 
for in part, the larger population per township in the brown 
soil zone than in the dark brown when the average yield is 15- 
17.9 bus. per acre (Table 15). However, in this instance the 
171 persons per township in the brown zone is the average of 
only 3 municipalities, one of which is M.D. 66 with an average

-3 munioipalities, one of ~.whi 
^- v e rag - e )of from 250-300 persons per township. It must be 
remembered that this zone contains most of the land adminis¬ 
tered under the Special Areas Act of 1938. Land coming under 
this Act is mostly sub-marginal and can support very few per¬ 
sons under ordinary methods of agriculture. It would appear 
then that for this zone as a whole some relationship exists 
between the productivity of the soil and the density of the 
population. 

Proceeding from the brown soil zone north and west on 
our Plate we may see clearly that the progressively better 
soils of the dark brown, shallow black and black soil zones 
are supporting increasingly larger populations. In the black 


zone there are no districts which average less than 200 persons 
per township and in the greater part of it the average is 300 
persons or more. The increasing density of settlement of the 
area from M.D. 341 north to M.D. 607 and from M.D. 520 to 
roughly the eastern boundary of the province may be due in 
part to a change in the type of farming, mixed farming re¬ 
placing the growing of grain crops which predominates in the 
shallow black and dark brown zones. This area also has a high 
concentration of farms v/here dairying is carried on more or 
less intensively. This type of farming demands a relatively 
larger labor force than grain farming. Within this same zone 
are to be found many settlements populated by families of 
Trench, German and Russian origin who usually have larger 
families than do persons of Anglo-Saxon stock. 

The fringe areas, made up of the transition and grey-

wooded soil zones, have a relatively dense population but 
here settlement is limited somewhat by the necessity of clear¬ 
ing the land of trees. The population of the Peace River area 
as a whole is somewhat sparser than the southern regions of 
the province which were settled first. However, there are 
districts with good black soil in the Peace River region where 
agricultural advancement and density of population would 
equal that found in the black soil zone south of Edmonton. 

It would be expected that the grey-wooded soil zone as 
such would in the future if fully settled, support a population 
approximately as dense as that now inhabiting the black soil 
zone. That is, the typical size of farm is likely to be the 
half section unit and the relatively low productivity of the 
soil will be dealt with by cultural means rather than by ex¬ 
tending the size of the farm unit. 

Changes in Rural Population 

Since the beginning of civilization populations have 
been shifting throughout the world because of economic condi¬ 
tions and for various other reasons. This is none the less 
true of Alberta between the period 1951 and 1941. 

The first contributing factor to a shift in the density 
of population may be caused by immigration from other provinces 
of Canada or from other countries. The population within the 
province may also shift because conditions may seem more 
favorable in one area than in another. Lack of rainfall created 
an exodus of people from the south-eastern part of the province 
from 1931 to 1941.

Trends in rural populations may also be affected by 
size of families increasing in any particular area. This 
in turn may lead to smaller farms. 

A change in type of faming in any area may in one in¬ 
stance cause an increase in the rural population for such a 
change may necessitate the hiring of more labor. On the other 
hand, greater mechanization may decrease the population by 
dispensing with hired help and by increasing the size of farm. 

In Plate IV shifts in the density of Alberta’s rural 
population is expressed on a percentage basis. Generally it 
will be noted that the population in the brown and the dark: 
brown soil zones has decreased as between 1931 and 1941. This 
decrease resulted from drought conditions and low prices which 
convinced many farmers that the area was over-populated with 
respect to its productive capacity. However, within this area 
L.I.D. 123 has shown an increase in population density of 35 
per cent. L.I.D. 123 (which contained the former G.P.R. 
irrigation district and which was turned over to the resident 
farmers in 1935 under the name of the Eastern Irrigation 
District), has had an increase in population due to an expans¬ 
ion of irrigated acreage. Farmers from both the drought areas 
of Saskatchewan and Alberta were encouraged to move into this 
area. 

The shallow black and the black soil zones show less 
productive variability than the previous two zones just dis¬ 
cussed and consequently support a reasonably stable population.

Where rural population increases have taken place 
within the former two zones it is believed they may have 
resulted from; (1) increases in size of farm family, 

(2) decreases in size of farm, and (3) changes in the type 
of agriculture practiced resulting in the necessity of hir¬ 
ing more labor. 

Rural population in the transition and grey wooded soil 
zones have shown marked increases between 1931 and 1941. 

This has resulted from the scarcity of suitable agricultural 
land elsewhere and the availability on the fringes of free 
or very cheap land. During the depression period drought- 
ridden farmers and unemployed from the cities moved to these 
fringe areas in an effort to gain independence. In some cases 
also, sons of established farmers in the black soil zone sought 
farms in the fringe areas because of the lack of available 
lands near their homes. 

In reference to the changes of rural population on Plate 
IT it should be realized that these changes are on a per¬ 
centage basis, that is, in a well-settled area a small in¬ 
crease is indicated by a small percentage change; in a 
sparsely populated area a similar increase is noted by a large 
percentage change. In the transition and grey wooded fringe 
regions the percentage change has been high but the aggregate 
increases have in most cases been small.

V. FACTORS AffjJSCTING- LOCATION OF INDUSTRY 


AVAILABILITY UP RAW MATERIALS 

Alberta’s manufacturing development has been largely built 
up on her abundant natural resources. The leading' industries 
of the Province are those whose main source of raw material 
has been the produce of the farm, the forest and the mine. 
Agricultural production which overshadows that of all other 
industries is responsible for the high ranking positions held 
by the slaughtering and meat packing, the flour mills and the 
butter and cheese factories, as well as contributing sub¬ 
stantially to such industries, as bread and bakery products 
and fruit and vegetable preparations. Sven the brewing in¬ 
dustry depends on high grade Alberta barley for its principal 
raw material. Petroleum refining, another leading industry, 
relies on the crude oil obtained from Turner Valley and other 
producing fields within the Province. 

Alberta’s forests, it is claimed, rank next to her fertile 
soil and provide the raw material for her sawmills, planing 
mills and sash and door factories, etc. 

That a limited amount of exploitation of the natural 
resources of Alberta has taken place will not be denied, but 
it seems pertinent here to inquire if the exploitation has 
reached its economic limitations. A casual inspection will 
reveal that there are certain raw materials in Alberta which 
are, as yet, not fully developed. The extensive proven coal 
reserves are ample evidence of this fact. What are the reasons

for this rather limited development? 

Natural resources differ immensely in quality. Some 
of these differences are from the economic point of view 
immaterial, e.g., that land in most places is level and firm 
enough for buildings, while other differences are very relevant 
from the point of view of various industrial activities. 

Alberta coal, for instance, varies greatly in quality ranging 
from a hard semi-anthracite to a low grade soft brown prairie 
lignite. Clearly, everything else being equal, the good coal 
will be mined and the poor coal passed up. Again, in case of 
the forest areas the better quality trees are cut and the poorer 
ones left standing. Thus, it is quite evident that one import¬ 
ant limiting factor in the development of the natural resources 
is the quality of the product. 

Accessibility of the resource is another very important 
factor in determining whether or not continued development 
in the industry will take place. Resources in accessible places 
are usually worked first, the more inaccessible the resource 
area, the more distant the time when it will be opened up. Again 
referring to the coal resources of Alberta we are reminded of 
the vast reserves which are yet untapped in the more or less 
inaccessible reaches of the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains* 

The costs of extraction also play an important part in 
deciding the limit to which development will take place. Mines 
become worked out and continued production can only be possible 
at increasing costs per unit recovered. Continued cropping of 
the agricultural lands uses up the natural soil constituents and

the productivity of the land can only be retained by adding 
in the form of fertilizers, etc., that which has been removed. 

If these extraction costs continue to increase more inaccess¬ 
ible resources and those of poorer quality will come within 
the range of economic development. 

The effect of the market for the resources has an im¬ 
portant bearing on the degree of the development. A large home 
market or one reached by good transport relations will naturally 
create a demand for these products which can be met only by ex¬ 
panding the degree of their exploitation. If, on the other 
hand, the local market is small or the transfer relations are 
relatively poor, a definite limitation is placed on the continued 
expansion of that resource. 

If a progressive development of the abundant natural re¬ 
sources of Alberta is to take place, it would appear that certain 
changes in these limiting factors and in other things will have 
to take place. Obviously an increase in population or cheaper 
transportation facilities would aid materially in bringing 
about further developments. Introduction of new and more economic¬ 
al techniques could materially reduce the cost of extraction. 
Opening up of new areas by improvement in roads, etc., could 
conceivably bring into production resources of a higher quality 
than are now in use. 

The possibilities regarding certain raw materials of which 
Alberta has plenty of supplies, are manifold. Some of these raw 
materials have had limited uses up to the present and some are 
as yet undeveloped. Bituminous tar sands, located on the Atha¬ 
basca and Clearwater Rivers, come to mind when we think of un-

developed resources. Here is found one of the largest deposits 
of asphaltic material known. They are estimated to be at 
least 10,000 square miles in area, with a possibility of still 
greater deposits. Some of the sand has been used experimentally 
and successfully too, for surfacing highways'and at present 
pilot plants are producing gasoline, tractor and diesel fuels 
as well as asphalt. Other by-products from the manufacturing 
process are possible, such as, roofing materials, paint, etc. 

This development is still in the experimental stages and no 
doubt the necessary technique of extraction and manufacturing 
will make it economically possible to distribute these products 
to the great Prairie markets which await them. 

Reference might be made to the future possibilities in the 
utilization of coal, numerous by-products are possible from 
the processing of the large bitumnious beds of coal found in 
Alberta, of which oils, perfumes, aspirin, acids, dyes, and 
gasoline are but a few. Hydrogenation of coal, developed on a 
large scale in certain countries of the world, offers interest¬ 
ing possibilities for new industries in Alberta. Although the 
process has been considered impracticable from a cost basis com¬ 
pared to the recoveries from oil, continued depletion of world 
oil resources along with improved technological methods could 
bring about the establishment of such industries in Alberta. 

Other raw materials at present being only partly used or 
being discarded as waste suggest potential future industries. 
Until only recently natural gas was wasted in terrific quantities, 
but now is being used not only for heating but as a raw material

for the manufacture of nitrogen fertilizers. Consider also 
the waste of straw from our agricultural crops. Paper and 
paper products of certain kinds, can he made from straw. 

Linen cloth has been made experimentally from the short fibres 
of the seed flax plant and there are numerous other uses to 
which many other agricultural wastes might be put. Whether 
Alberta can economically use these wastes has yet to be proven. 

Let us consider why certain raw materials produced in 
Alberta are shipped out as such and are not manufactured or 
are manufactured on a very small scale within the Province. A 
few such raw materials are, wheat and coarse grains, flax, hides, 
wool, furs and timber. 

It may be said that regions, like individuals, reap cer¬ 
tain advantages from specialization regardless of the difference 
of productive equipment. This specialization makes it possible 
to produce on a large scale; and will enable full individual 
division of labor and the use of the most efficient size of 
plant. Certain commodities can be produced very cheaply in 
large factories and when spread over large markets reach great 
numbers of consumers. Other commodities however, may be pro¬ 
duced in small establishments ;just as efficiently as in large 
ones and they tend to be produced near the market. 

If certain productive factors -- raw materials, tools and 
machinery — are completely divisable, then any combination of 
them would be possible regardless of their absolute quantities. 

It would be possible then to establish any size of plant which 
would produce at the lowest co^st per unit or commodity. How-

ever, the size of the plant is important, for in many cases 
only a large-size establishment can combine the productive 
factors to give the most economical scale^production. 

Not only the scale of production but also the, cost factors 
must be considered in deciding whether Alberta’s raw materials 
may be processed within her boundaries. The cost of power, 
the wages that must be paid different grades of workers, the 
interest rates demanded for the use of capital and the local 
taxes are all important considerations. A comparison with 
other areas might reveal that costs in Alberta are lower than 
in these other areas. But does this necessarily mean that the 
manufacturing should take place in Alberta? The answer I 
think, is no, for it might be more advantageous to devote 
additional productive factors to those goods in which Alberta 
has special advantages than to others which, although capable 
of being made at lower cost in Alberta, offer less in total gain. 
This may account for, say, the shipment of wool from Alberta in 
the raw state and the importation of manufactured woollens. 

For clearly, it would be to the advantage of the Province to 
devote additional factors to the production of, for instance, 
flour mills, rather than to wool manufacture, if the net gain 
is higher in the former case. 

FACTORS AFFECTING COSTS 

There are a number of factors which constitute the main 
costs of producing a manufactured article. Some of the most 
important ones are, laid-down costs of the raw material or 
materials, cost of labor of all*grades, cost of power, interest

payments for the use of capital and taxes. 

When interested parties are seeking a site for the 
establishment of an industry they are vitally concerned with 
the costs of the different productive factors which will go 
into their product. They want to find, to the best of their 
judgment, a location which will give them the most economical 
combination of factors they need and in the quantities and 
qualities desired. Naturally this will mean a comparison of 
the total costs of production using one site as compared to 
other possible locations. 

Also, the quantities of each factor to be used is of 
vital importance. Certain kinds of production use different 
quantities of each of the factors as compared to other types 
of production. For instance, oil refining requires relatively , 
large quantities of capital in the form of plants and machinery 
compared to the number of workers, while an industry such as 
a clothing factory uses relatively large amounts of labor. 
Consequently, the prices to be paid those factors which^needed 
in large quantities are more important than the prices to be 
paid for factors used in limited amounts. 

It is proposed here to discuss some of the main constituents, 
apart from raw materials, which go into a manufactured product 
and to compare their costs in Alberta with costs in other regions. 

Electricity and Fuel 

The Place of Electricity and Fuel 
in Production Costs. 

In considering the power factor as one of the principal 
costs of a manufactured product, it must be recognized that

there are two important aspects in relation to it. One of 
these is its cost and the other the adequacy of the supply. 

Of the two, the latter in many cases, is of greater import¬ 
ance due to the relatively small part the cost of power is 

of the value of the manufactured product. 

1 / 

J?rom a recent report the cost of power for all industries 
in the United States was shown as 0.8 per cent of the value of 
the manufactured product. Calculations based on figures re¬ 
leased by the Dominion G-overnment indicate that the cost of 
fuel and electricity for all Canadian industries was only 2.87 
per cent of the gross value of production while the same costs 
for Alberta were only 1.76 per cent. These costs for Western 
Canada cities were, Winnipeg 1.71 per cent, Edmonton 0.84 per 

cent, Calgary 2.38 per cent, Regina 2.38 per cent, and Leth- 

2 / 

bridge 0.79 per cent. It might be interesting to inquire into 
the differences in these fuel and electricity costs as between 
say, Winnipeg and Edmonton and Lethbridge. Although the type 
of industries in the Manitoba centre differ somewhat from those 
in Edmonton and Lethbridge, it is no doubt true that the low 
costs in the latter cities &re due mainly to the relatively low 
prices paid for coal and natural gas. On the other hand, cheap 
hydro-electric power available at Winnipeg tends to offset, to 
a certain extent, the higher costs of coal there.

It has been estimated also that the cost of electricity 
for making a barrel of flour costing some $5.00 is about 50, 

1 / 

or about 1 per cent of the value of the manufactured product. 

Except for certain industries such as, the pulp and paper, 
electro-chemical or metallurgical, where electric power is 
used mainly for purposes other than for mechanical power, the 
above facts would seem to indicate that fuel and electricity 
costs are a rather insignificant factor compared with other 
factors in determining the total cost of the finished product. 

Adequacy of the available supply, as was mentioned above, 
may be of greater importance than cost of power. A manufactur¬ 
ing plant should have available, for instant use small and large 
amounts of power as the need arises. This requires a location 
where large amounts of power are available so that individual 
users’ varying demands may be met. Also, if large supplies 
are available the varying yearly needs may be more adequately 
supplied for many plants cannot foretell what their future power 
requirements may be. 


Sources of Electricity and Fuel in Alberta. 
Electrical power is mainly generated in Alberta from water¬ 
power and from fuels such as coal, gasoline, fuel oil (d6isel) 
and natural gas. 

Coal is used extensively for power generation where it 
is found nearby. Edmonton, Drumheller and Lethbridge are the 

l/Proceeaings of Midcontinent Research Conference at Minneapolis, 
Minnesota, 1943. p. 50.

larger producers using coal at present, although the widely- 
scattered coal fields make many other population centres 
potential users. 

Medicine Hat, wainwright and Vermilion use natural gas 
as a fuel for electrical energy production, each of these 
centos being in close proximity to a producing gas field. 

All hydro-electric power plants in Alberta are owned 
and operated by the Calgary Power Company, who had install¬ 
ations totalling over 90,000 h.p. at the end of 1944. This 
development is all west of Calgary where four power plants, 
the Cascade plant located near Anthracite, the Horseshoe and 
Kananaskis plants near Seebe, and the Ghost plant at the mouth 

i/ 

of Ghost River generate all Alberta*s hydro-power. In addition, 
there are three large reservoirs impounding about 370,000 acre- 
feet of water in the vicinity of the producing plants. Addition¬ 
al sites in this general area and in other parts of the Province 
are available when there is a demand for increased power product¬ 
ion. No recent survey has been made of possible water power 
sites but conservative estimates show that a bare minimum of 
about 400,000 h.p. could be developed. 

In addition to the power already mentioned there are a 
number of small electrical generating plants using gasoline and 
deisel fuel oil. In the main, these plants serve small towns 
and in many instances, are not within economical distances of 

l/The Calgary Power Plant at Prince’s Island with a capacity 
of 2,000 h.p. has not been used in recent years.

the power lines of the larger distributors. 

The principal fuels available in Alberta, coal, natural 
gas and petroleum, have been discussed in preceding parts 
and there is no need to stress again their abundance or access¬ 
ibility. 

Comparison of Costs with Other Centres. 

Although the cost of power is a relatively small element 
compared with other costs of manufacturing in many industries, 
it is nevertheless a cost which must be considered. 

A comparison of costs of certain types of electrical 
energy in selected Canadian cities is set out in Table 16. It 
will be noted that while Edmonton and Calgary have the highest 
costs of the cities shown for 200 k.w. hrs. consumption of 24- 
hour commercial lighting service with a 1-kilowatt load, their 
comparative position improves when 1000 k.w. hours under a 
10-kilowatt load is used. In fact, Calgary compares very favor¬ 
able with Winnipeg, a centre with exceptionally cheap electricity. 
A comparison of 24-hour small power costs brings the Alberta 
cities into a still more favorable light. Under a 5 h.p. load 
and consuming 746 k.w. hrs. of electricity, Calgary and Edmonton 
rank next to Hamilton on a cost basis. If the load is in¬ 
creased to 100 h.p. and the consumption reaches 7,457 k.w. hours, 
Calgary and Edmonton show the smallest costs of any of the cities 
compared, displacing Hamilton which leads for all other types 
of power shown. 

The costs as shown above would seem to indicate that as 
far as small power requirements are concerned the Alberta centdirs

of Edmonton and Calgary compare favorably with representative 
cities across Canada. It is recognized that electricity costs 
vary with the average rate of consumption per day and at 
different times during the day and during the year. There is 
no doubt that costs in Alberta cities would considerably lessen 
if a number of large commercial or manufacturing concerns were 
added to the lists of consumers. 

It is a fact that the costs of hydro-electric power to 
large consumers located near the generating source is cheap. 

As Alberta has as yet, only one such plant in operation, the 
nitrogen plant at Calgary, the average cost of hydro-electric 
power will tend to be higher to large consumers in Alberta 
than will such costs to firms more favorably situated. 

Coal is used not only as a source of power but also as 
a fuel for producing heat. Many manufacturing processes call 
for an application of heat to materials as a part of the manu¬ 
facturing technique. Although this heat may be produced by 
electrical means in some cases, there are probably more industries 
which require heat from coal if only from a cost viewpoint. 

Also the necessity of heating the premises during the colder 
months require the use of coal or gas as a fuel, electricity 
again being too costly for this purpose. 

In regard to the costs of coal Alberta presents a very 
favorable picture. During 194X~the manufacturing industries 
of the Prairie Provinces used considerable quantities of bit¬ 
uminous coal found only in one of the western provinces, Alberta. 
Table 17 reveals that the cost of such coal per ton to Alberta 
industries was only one-half the cost to Manitoba users and

However, the point seems to he that Alberta has a definite 
advantage over the other two prairie provinces in respect to 
costs of the better grades of coal. 

Alberta offers a material advantage over any of the other 
provinces in regard to costs of natural gas. Although only 
two other provinces produce natural gas in sizable quantities 
and only Ontario and Alberta in substantial quantities, the 
cost of the Alberta product is greatly below that of the other 
two sources, as may be seen from Table 18. Not only in cost 
but in quantities available does Alberta hold the advantage, 
for both the Ontario and New B^swick fields are showing signs 
of depletion.

To summarize the points offered above it might be said 

that: 

(1) Alberta does not offer a comparative advantage to 
large consumers of cheap hydro-electric power. However, the 
hydro-electric Company now operating in Alberta is willing to 
quote competitive rates for prospective industrialists wish¬ 
ing to locate in Alberta. For users of certain classes of 
small power, costs in Alberta compare favorable with other 
Canadian centres. 

(2) Alberta definitely offers a comparative advantage 

to consumers of coal of various grades and especially to those 
users whose manufacturing process has a technical preference 
for that fuel, such as, foundries and machine shops, brick, 
tile, lime and cement works, etc. Also, where factories and 
other buildings must be heated during certain seasons of the 
year a cheap supply of coal in abundant quantities is a con¬ 
siderable advantage.

(3) Alberta has in the case of natural gas a comparative 
advantage over any other part of the Dominion. Here plenteous 
supplies are available at costs far below any other region* 

Wages. 

"From the point of view of production costs and competi¬ 
tion the height of money wages and the quality of labor are the 
vital circumstances. The worker, on the other hand, is in¬ 
terested in the things his wages can buy, his real wages in terms 

y 

of commodities and services." 

The importance of labor costs is not the same for all in¬ 
dustries, for in some, considerable quantities and grades of 
labor are used while in others only small quantities are ne¬ 
cessary. For example, the wages of labor are higher in proportion 
to the gross value of the product in furniture making, than in, 
say, sugar refining, the Canadian percentages being roughly 36 
per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. In the former case, the 
cooperating factors of materials and capital are relatively 
scarce compared to the latter. 

How do labor costs in Alberta compare with those in the 
other provinces of the Dominion? In the comparisons which 
follow it must be pointed out that only the general trend of 
?/ages can be indicated due to the multiplicity of job classi¬ 
fications foutid in various industries and to the lack of com¬ 
parative wage statistics.

The wages paid to agricultural workers in the different 
provinces shows a range of $88 for men and $71 for women as 
between the highest and lowest paying province (Table 19). 
Alberta ranks fifth from the top for men and third for women 
indicating a somewhat median position for both males and fe¬ 
males.

1Wages and Hours of Labor 

in Canada, Report 25, 

P. 


Department of Labor* 


The earnings per day of coal miners for the various 
provinces show that Alberta miners as a whole receive higher 
wages than do miners working in other areas. The total yearly 
wages would not tend to show the same spread, for Alberta 
miners work on the average fewer days per year than do miners 
engaged in the other provinces.

^Figures calculated by dividing number of man days worked 
into the total wages paid. 

^Average of the average number of days worked for the years 
1936 to 1940 inclusive. 

Very few significant differences in wages paid to the 
various trades and other occupations show^in Table 21, are 
to be found. In the building trades, Montreal and Halifax 
wage rates appear lowest, followed by Hamilton, Winnipeg and 
Edmonton which are about the same and are all below the general 
average of Vancouver. Edmonton’s rates for blacksmiths and 
machinists are lowest for the cities shown. For the printing 
trades, Halifax and Hamilton are lowest while Vancouver shows 
the highest average figure for the group. Edmonton pays about 
the average for all the cities compared. 

Certain civic employees (Firemen and Policemen) receive 
the lowest wages in Halifax and the highest in Hamilton and

Vancouver. Edmonton is slightly under Winnipeg and about 
on a par with Montreal, although the hours of work are 
shorter in Edmonton than in Montreal. Apart from Hamilton, 
civic laborers are higher paid in the Western centres than 
in the Eastern ones. 

The cost of factory labor is comparatively low in Edmonton 
but it must be realized that the average wage shown by 
Table 21 is for a very small group of factories, namely, nine, 
whereas, apart from Halifax, not less than twenty-five differ¬ 
ent establishments are included in the average figures given. 
Also no recognition has been made of the labor force as be¬ 
tween male and female workers. A heavier weighting of female 
employees in certain areas would tend to a lower average wage: 
due to relatively lower wage payments made to women as a group. 

A further indication of the comparative labor costs may 
be had by reference to the per capita wages and salaries paid 
per week in the Canadian economic areas.

mainly to their more highly industrali'zed production which 
calls forth a higher money wage. Although the second largest 
manufacturing province in the Dominion, Quebec, falls 'below 
the Prairie Provinces in the average weekly wage paid, there 
may be several reasons for this, one immediately coining to 
mind being, a relatively high proportion of women and child¬ 
ren working. It is evident, however, that average wages paid 
to prairie workers are not excessive and from the employer’s 
point of view compare quite favorably with those paid in Ontario 
and British Columbia. 

ISTo attempt will be made here to bring out. any qualitative 
difference there might exist between labor in different parts 
of Canada. The usefulness, skill and dependability of workers 
varies greatly in different countries but Canada is sufficiently 
homogeneous to show little variation in these respects as be¬ 
tween provinces. Strikes, labor disputes, etc., occur in each 
of the provinces and it cannot be justifiably said that any 
particular province has more than its proportionate share. 

The average Canadian is an alert, intelligent and industrious 
worker and under similar working conditions vail produce as well 
in one part of the country as another. Also, the adaptability 
of Canadian workers across the country, in acquiring new skills 
readily, as shown by our greatly expanded war production, 
augurs well for prospective employers no matter where they may 
wish to locate. 

From the point of view of the worker, real wages, as was 
pointed out above, are what he is primarily interested in,

As this index is prepared from a standard budget of wage- 
earners and salaried workers earning on the average about 
f1500 per year, it gives a fairly representative sample of 
living costs throughout the Dominion. It ?dll be noted that 
Edmonton had at this date the lowest cost of living figure 
listed. As this index is constantly changing, Edmonton’s 
position may vary also in relation to the other cities but from 
a number of different periods inspected within the last few 
years the position of Edmonton has remained substantially near 
the lowest index figure. 

In looking at a breakdown of these index figures, we 
find that the main reason for Edmonton’s position was the

cost of fuel which,was 5 full points below that of the next 
lowest centre, namely, Halifax. Rental costs were about one- 
half point above Vancouver, the lowest, and four and one-half 
points below Winnipeg, the next highest. Edmonton showed the 
lowest figure for the miscellaneous group and was slightly 
over the Toronto low for food. For the clothing group, Edmonton 
was highest and for home furnishings and services was third 
highest. 

In summarizing the labor situation in Alberta the follow¬ 
ing points are submitted for consideration: 

(1) The costs of labor in general in Alberta are about 
at the Canadian average. 

(2) Although there is no large body of employable skill¬ 
ed workers available at present, there are considerable num¬ 
bers of workers who are capable of learning, in a minimum of 
time, essential industrial skills. 

(3) Alberta has a dry, sunny climate which is stimulat¬ 
ing and healthy for energetic workers. 

(4) The cost of living in Alberta is as low as found in 
any other province. 

(5) There is available a sizable body of female labor 
which could be utilized in many light industries.

Interest. 

The costs of capital in the form of interest payments 
are not discussed in this outline in any detail due to the 
lack of comparable figures for the Canadian Provinces. It 
is presumed that differences in interest rates do exist for 
capital employed in Eastern Canada as against capital in¬ 
vested in the Western provinces, due partly to the fact that 
a large part of the capital is controlled in the East and in¬ 
vestment in industries close to the capital source, ceteris 
paribus, is to be preferred. The more distant the investment 
the higher the risk element seems and this is expressed in 
the form of higher interest rates for investments in distant 
regions. Especially true is this differential rate operative 
when various forms of instability enter the picture, such as, 
revolutions, wars, and unstable governments. In case of loans 
made to these areas of uncertainty an added risk premium is 
demanded which in the long run should just balance the losses 
incurred from the additional risks. Professor Black has the 

y 

following to say about interest rates; "During the early 
1920* s, local interest rates were nearly twice as high in 
Montana as in Massachusetts. They were high in all the south¬ 
ern states. For large enterprises, however, eastern capitalsts 
were willing to invest their capital in the West and South at 
only slight premiums." 

There can be little doubt that the conditions referred 
to above apply to a certain extent in Alberta as compared to 

l/ Production Economics , p. 199.

Eastern Canada. The Province is still relatively new country 
and even with its abundant natural resources no appreciable 
capital fund has, as yet, been built up. It takes time to 
accumulate a capital reserve and in the meantime a lot of the 
development of the province must depend on sources of capital 
to be found elsewhere. 

Taxes 

Taxes influence costs of production as well as the prices 
of productive factors. Within the boundaries of a particular 
country^local and provincial taxes are naturally the ones 
which concern an individual firm or enterprise. 

A comparison of the tax levies which a business might 
be expected to pay by reason of locating in a certain pro¬ 
vince, city or place presents a number of difficulties. In 
some instances, the amount of tax payable would depend on 
the discretion of the assessing body within, of course, the 
bounds of its authority. A favorable assessment of the land 
and improvements of an establishment might make a very material 
difference in the amount of taxes to be paid. Again, in cer¬ 
tain places, special levies for community services are not in¬ 
cluded in the general tax. For example, some cities make an 
additional charge for garbage removal and disposal while other 
centres include such costs in the general tax. From the fore¬ 
going, it appears evident that a very close study of the tax 
structure v/ould be necessary in order to adequately appraise 
the full tax burden to be met in any particular location. 

It is proposed, therefore, in the following discussion to merely 
highlight some of the taxation features of certain Western

Canadian cities; namely, Edmonton, Calgary, Medicine Hat, 
Saskatoon, Regina, Winnipeg and Vancouver. 

In all the cities listed above, the land assessment is 
based on the fair actual value of the land* Business im¬ 
provements are assessed in most cases at a certain percentage 
of the fair actual value. The percentage varies in different 
localities ranging from 60 per cent of value in Edmonton to 
50 per cent in Calgary and Vancouver* Regina make provision 
for assessing at 30 per cent of the replacement value less 
depreciation. The mill rates of the cities are not all readily 
available but for those at hand, Edmonton levied at the rate 
of 49.5 mills, Calgary at 42.5 mills and Saskatoon at 43 mills. 

All cities listed except Vancouver impose a business tax 
with some variations in each of the centres. Edmonton, Calgary, 
and Winnipeg assess on the full annual rental value of the land 
and buildings. Medicine Hat takes 10 per cent of the full 
assessed value as a basis for assessment but Regina and Saska¬ 
toon base their assessment on the floor space occupied. Cal¬ 
gary has a fixed rate of 8 per cent for all types of businesses 
but both Edmonton and Winnipeg classify by kind of business 
and levy graduated rates. In addition, Winnipeg breaks down 
the annual rentals and charges progressive percentages on in¬ 
creasing rental values. Eor illustrative purposes, a whole¬ 
sale oil dealer occupying premises with a rental value of, 
say, #1200 would pay a business tax of #96 in Calgary, #180 
in Edmonton and #204 in ?/innipeg. 

Licenses are collected in most of the cities but their 
purpose in the main is to regulate and control and so are

usually of a nominal nature. In some of the cities they may 
he offset against the business tax, e.g., in Edmonton and in 
Medicine Hat but in others no rebate is allowed, e.g., in 
Calgary. 

In addition to the general tax on land and improvements 
and the business tax, firms in Alberta are levied on by the 
provincial government for social services. This tax is assessed 
on the full value of the land only and is fixed at 3.59 mills. 

Special considerations to new concerns starting up within 
most of these cities have been made in the. past but the general 
policy at present is not to grant any such preferences. In 
Edmonton power to make any special agreements regarding a re¬ 
duction in taxes is vested in the City Council. Calgary, on 
the other hand, requires a majority vote of the rate payers. 

The preference in most cases takes the form of a fixed assess¬ 
ment amounting to around 25 per cent of the fair actual value. 

In Medicine Hat special consideration is extended to a large 
flour mill whose products are for export rather than domestic 
1 consumption and in Vancouver a preference is made to certain 
elevators whose business is the export of grain and grain pro¬ 
ducts. 

It is apparent from the material presented above 

that no definite decision may be reached on the exact amount 
of taxes a business might have to pay in any of the given 
localities-. The process of finding the best location from 
a tax point of view would involve preparing specific information

on the type of structure and improvements contemplated and 
selecting possible sites in different localities. The cost 
of the building site could be definitely obtained and assum¬ 
ing that the improvements were assessed at the same amount 
in each of the cities a fairly accurate approximation of the 
probable property taxes could be made. Once the size and 
approximate value of the establishment had been decided upon 
the amount of the business tax could be computed as well. 
Licenses, where they are necessary, present no particular 
problem as they are in most cases a specified amount based 
on the type of business conducted. 

MARKETS 

Local 

The markets for Alberta^ manufacturing industries may 
be divided into different groups. There is first the purely 
local market for manufacturing establishments catering to the 
immediate needs of the community. In this category would 
come bread and bakery products, newspapers, and so on. The 
size of these producing plants are closely related to the 
population needs. The next group is particularly concerned 
with supplying a market wider than a purely local one, in 
most cases, provincial in scope or even in certain industries 
export markets. Examples of such industries would be, sugar 
refining, meat packing, flour milling, pottery and glass, 
etc. Here the manufacturing establishment is considerably 
larger than for those supplying purely local markets and 
certain economies from larger scale production result. When 
the production from the manufacturing industries exceed the

consumption within the province outside markets must be found. 

As yet the market within Alberta is too limited for the 
large scale manufacturing of certain consumer goods for local 
consumption. This is a disadvantage to the people of the 
province because of the necessity of paying a higher price for 
imported goods. 

Due to the similarity between the three prairie provinces 
in respect of production it would appear that both Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba offer very limited possibilities for disposal of 
goods manufactured in Alberta# British Columbia offers better 
opportunities and there is tendency for trade between these two 
provinces to increase. In general it would seem evident that 
Alberta will have to look to the Eastern Seaboard or to ex¬ 
port for a market for her excess manufacturing production. 

This movement of commodities to the coastal regions entails 
considerable distances requiring carriage by rail and in¬ 
volving transportation costs which have to be met. This 
brings us to the consideration of transportation conditions 
within the province and with the outside. 

Transportation 

facilities and Costs to User. 

Transportation facilities available in Alberta consist 
of railroads, roads, water and air. At the present time 
Alberta is served with a fairly complete network of railways 
reaching most of the accessible parts of the province. The 
railway mileage is relatively high per capita but comparatively 
low in respect of the area of the province. A large area in 
the northern part of the province is practically uninhabited 






114 


except for a few Indians and trappers, etc*, and this partly 
explains the relatively low mileage for the province as a 
whole. 

There are three railway lines which might be considered 
heavy traffic lines, namely, the transcontinental line^ of 
the Canadian Pacific Railway passing through Calgary, the 
transcontinental line of the Canadian National passing through 
Edmonton^and the branch line of the Canadian Pacific from 
Calgary to Edmonton. The remaining lines are on the whole 
medium to light traffic lines and they scarcely pay for them¬ 
selves. 

T'ct/ti/M 

The Prairie Standard torafTrc rates apply to. all points 

DVt 

on railways between William in the east to Jasper and the 
Crow’s Nest Pass in the west with the exception of places on 
the Northern Alberta Railway to Waterways. This rate schedule 
tends to equalize railway transportation costs as between the 
larger centres and the smaller towns, especially if less-than- 
carload-lot shipments are involved. However, it is doubtful 
if the smaller centres are able to take advantage of the re¬ 
duced rates applicable to carload lot or commodity-rate ship- 
ments. This presents one difficulty which growing'manufactar¬ 
ing industry might have to overcome by reason of locating in 
a small centre of population. 

The highways of Alberta consist of about 5,000 miles 
of surfaced roads and 90,000 miles of earth roads. Of the 
surfaced roads, 700 miles are of bituminous pavement or

■bituminous surfacing and the remainder of gravel or crushed 
stone. About one-sixth of the earth roads are improved 
roads. The wide expanse of the province together with the 
necessity of providing some type of road for outlying areas 
poses a considerable problem for the public bodies concerned* 
Large areas in Alberta are in need of any kind of all- 
weather road and if the plans of the present government are 
carried out a large increase in surfaced roads serving the 
more populous areas should result. Good roads have particular 
significance in relation to local and provincial distribution 
of manufactured products as well as benefitting the marketing 
of agricultural and other commodities. It is reasonable to 
assume that truck transportation in Alberta will greatly ex¬ 
pand as it has done elsewhere when more good hard-surfaced 
roads are available. 

Facilities for water transportation are veiy limited 
within the province. At present there are river boats oper¬ 
ating on the Peace River from the town of Peace River to Fort 
Vermilion and on the Athabasca River from McMurray down river 
to the Arctic Ocean. Navigation on both these rivers is con¬ 
fined to a relatively short season due to freezing over during 
winter. 

There are, in addition, two other problems connected 
with water transportation on the Athabasca River: (1) low 
water in the late summer when navigation must cease or the 
boats carry part cargoes, and (2) the 16-mile portage between 
Ft. Fitzgerald and Ft. Smith.

Freighting by air has been carried on in Alberta for 
a number of years. This development is confined to the mov¬ 
ing of certain types of freight into the North and bringing 
out furs, mineral concentrates, etc. There has also been 
some freighting of fresh fish from outlying lakes to the rail¬ 
way. The effect of air transportation in respect of the 
carrying of freight generally appears, however, to be some¬ 
thing only the future can foretell. 

From the foregoing it may be seen that transportation 
in Alberta depends very largely on the railways. Although 
the freight rate problem as it affects Alberta has not been 
reviewed, numerous cases could be cited where apparent rate 
discriminations against places in Alberta exist. Let one 
suffice. Freight rates on coal from Drumheller to points 
within a 700 mile distance are 62 per cent higher than rates 

y 

which apply on coal for a similar distance from Montreal. 

There can be little doubt that, with Alberta so dependent 
on railroad transportation, a downward revision of freight 
rates would be of material benefit in the industrial develop¬ 
ment of Alberta. 

Transportability. 

We have already discussed the location of the main con¬ 
suming centres within Alberta and mention has been made of 
the transportation facilities available. G-iven the location 
of these consuming areas and the transport facilities at hand 
the transportability of commodities will be a factor affecting 
production. Production of certain commodities may prove un-

economical merely because of difficulty of transport. On 
the other hand, different commodities relatively easy to 
transport may be economically produced within the area. 

Take the case of finished goods; if they are more 
difficult to transport than the raw materials from which they 
are made, production will tend to be located near the con¬ 
sumption point. For this reason such commodities as bread 
and ice cream are manufactured close to the market, and we 
have production known as "market localized." Conversely, 
if the raw materials are more difficult to transport than the 
finished product made from them, there will be a tendency to 
locate production near the source of the main raw material. 

This is particularly true if the raw material is "weight¬ 
losing", that is, if the larger part of its total weight is 
discarded when manufacture takes place. In the production 
of beet sugar, for example, we find that the refineries are sit¬ 
uated in the beet growing area, giving rise to what is called 
a "raw-material localized" industry. 

Another aspect of transportability is the fact that cer¬ 
tain commodities cannot undergo transportation for long distances 
due to their perishable nature, e.g., fruits, milk, fish, etc. 

In any event if they are moved any distance special facilities 
must be available in order that they may reach the market in 
sound condition. Many examples are before us each day of 
goods processed in such a manner as to overcome this perishable 
feature. Hermetieal sealing, quick freezing, and dehydration 
are all designed to increase the transportability of the perish-

able or bulky product. These techniques have improved the 
transportability of many commodities and have made their 
production "raw-material localized." 

A somewhat analagous situation in relation to perish¬ 
ability is the movement of Alberta coal. Certain coals mined 
in Alberta are so friable that they crumble into small pieces 
when subjected to handling. This property would naturally 
lead to the consumption of this type of coal near its source. 
If,however, it were of a suitable nature briquetting or some 
other processing might be attempted in order to find for it 
a wider market.

VI. CONCLUSION 

It is proposed here to merely indicate some of the main 
features which present themselves from the foregoing sections 
of this thesis. 

The present pattern of production reveals the predomina¬ 
ting place agriculture has in the economy of Alberta. As we 
have seen nearly two-thirds of all production comes from this 
one industry. Coming into more prominence is the raising of 
livestock and other sources of farm income which lessen some¬ 
what the dependence on field crops. 

Mining in Alberta means fuels; for coal, oil and natural 
gas are outstanding. Electric power brings to our attention 
hydro developments on the Bow River and innumerable possi¬ 
bilities from fuels. Sugar and oil refineries, potteries, 
salt and fertilizer plants, etc., suggest a beginning to¬ 
ward a wider range of manufactured products. 

Agricultural products are Alberta’s principal export; 
it is estimated that 10 out of 13 bushels of wheat grown in 
Alberta goes to outside points in one form or another and that 
only one hog in every 5 raised is consumed by Albertans. 

Alberta’s coal and oil find outside markets as do* such 
manufactured products aSjSugar, salt, glass and pottery. 

About 55 per cent of the working population of Alberta 
are farmers. For every seven persons employed in Alberta one 
is a woman. Women seem to find the service industries suit 
their talents best, for this group accounts for nearly seven 
out of every ten women employed.

Although, the natural resources are widespread certain 
areas are identified with particular resources. For lumber 
we look to the wooded regions of the foothills; for fish, the 
large northern lakes; for high grade coal, the mountain mines; 
for oil, Turner Valley; for natural gas, again Turner Valley 
as well as Viking and Medicine Hat; and for fertile soil the 
prairie and parkland regions. The manufactures of Calgary 
and Edmonton we find overshadow the remaining centres in the 
province. In the high grade black soil zone the rural populat¬ 
ion has a density of over 9 persons to the square mile. 

Many raw materials in accessible areas await future 
developments. The bituminous sands of the McMurray region 
constitute probably the largest potential oil field in the 
world. Alberta could supply Canada's coal requirements at the 
present rate of consumption for scores of years to come. Costs 
of production are moderate. Fuel is exceptionally cheap and 
electrical power is readily available at favorable rates. 

./ages are not excessive while the cost of living is as low as 
any place in Canada. Interest rates may be slightly higher 
than in older settled parts of the country but are not un¬ 
reasonably out of line. Local taxes in Alberta's cities in 
comparison with taxes elsew T here do not discourage industrial 
development. 

With a population density of 3.2 per square mile Alberta 
represents a rather limited local market for her produce. The 
railway network has a good coverage of the populated area but 
the fact that of all the surfaced roads in 1942, only 1 mile 
in 6 was hard surfaced suggests a pressing need. Alberta

It may be with complete justification that Professor

that Calgary may surpass Ottawa and even rival London as a 
focus of the Empire^*".
