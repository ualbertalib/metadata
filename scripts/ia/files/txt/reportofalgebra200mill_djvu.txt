CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 

Two thousand five hundred and sixty-nine students 
wrote the Algebra 2 examination in Pune 1940. Eight hun¬ 
dred and seven of these students secured less than one 
quarter of the total possible mark. Two thousand two hun- 
red and thirteen students made less than half the total 
possible mark. Twenty-nine students secured seventy-five 
per cent or more of the total possible score. 

The results in 1941 were very much the same as in 
1940. In 1942 the results were much better but a different 
type of examination was given. 

The purpose of this investigation is to analyse the 
errors made by the students and so discover, if possible, the 
cause of these low scores. The examination papers will be 
criticized and suggestions offered.

CHAPTER II 


PROCEDURE EOLLO. .SD IN CARRYING OUT THE STUDY 

The Faculty of Education made arrangements with the 
Department of Education to obtain the sample papers. For 
each year there were approximately three hundred sample 
papers. 

The method of procedure was simple. One problem 
was considered at a time. For example, Problem 1 on the 
1940 paper was taken. Every answer paper was studied and 
all the various solutions recorded. The total number mak¬ 
ing each type of error was found and listed as a per cent. 
Where only two or three papers showed the same type of 
errors they were classified as miscellaneous errors. 

The same procedure was carried out for each of the 
three papers. Comments were made on the results obtained. 
The results were given as percentages under the following 
headings: 

(a) Correct Solution 

(b) Did not Attempt the Problem 

( c) Common Errors 

(d) Miscellaneous Errors 

There were 297 papers in the sample lot for the 1940 
examination, 309 for the 1941 examination, and 322 for the 
1942 examination. The percentages given are based on these 
totals but should be reasonably true for all the answer 
papers. What the probable error is, in using these samples 
instead of all the answer papers, is shown in the fallowing 

- 2 - 


cases 



3 


Assume problems not attempted as incorrect. 

Sample lot 300 papers. 

Oase 1. 60% correct 40% incorrect 

Standard Deviation from correct score is 

/60 A 40 - 2 i/zxo 
r 30U 

Since the sample is large, the distribution under 
simple sampling conditions is normal and the range of the 
score is from 60 - 3(2//^) up to 60 - 3(2/13) 

That is, the probable range is from 52 to 68 per 
cent correct. 

The maximum range would occur when 50% were correct. 

In this case the s. d. would be/2500 = ,/25 %, which is not 

V 300 v 3 

much greater than that shown in the above case. 

Case 2. 90% correct 300 sample papers 

Standard Deviation is /90 A 10 - 3 

V 300 

The range is from 90-3 j/Tf to 90 - 3 /3 
That is, the range is from 85 to 95. 

These illustrations show that for all practical 
purposes the percentages obtained from the samples are 
reliable.

On the average, only one student in seven could 
correctly solve both parts of this problem. More 
surprising still, about one in ten did not even attempt 
it.

The problem could, be solved easily in two ways. 

They could use the method of generalization or they could 
take special cases. 

Many of those who solved the problem, simply wrote 
the answer so they may have obtained it by guessing. Nearly 
everyone realized that the answer would involve 9, /9, or 

9 , but the incorrect guesses were almost as numerous as 


the correct ones.

Many,of the students made mechanical errors and so 
got entirely unreasonable answers. They failed to use the 
, graph to test the correctness of their results. 

For practical purposes, the best method to use 
would be the approximate result as found from the graph. 

It can be found quite accurately and it is the simplest 
method. The problem does not state the method of solution 
required and yet no marks were allowed for this solution. 

If more emphasis were placed on approximate answers and less 
on mechanical solutions by formulae, we probahley Y^ould get 
much better results. 


























v> .

The sketch of the graph was fairly well done. 

Most of the difficulty arose from failure to note the 

2 

significance of the minus sign in front of x . That is, 
the student showed a line which continued to rise.

Question 3

This question is very fair. There is a problem 
practically identical to this one in the text. The solution 
does not require the memorization of a formula as it depends 
solely on the knowledge that volumes of similar figures are 
to one another as the cube of corresponding sides. 

There are five problems in the section on Ratio that 
compare volume of similar objects. There are also several 
of these problems in the Revision exercises. This should be 
sufficient to make clear to the student how the principle 
actually works. 

Nearly half of the students did not attempt the prob¬ 
lem. This probably indicates that the students are not sure 
of themselves in problems involving ratio. The large 



10 


number comparing volumes of similar objects as being 
directly proportional to their radii are probably just 
following the line of least resistance. The numbers are 
given, so without thinking how they should be used, the 
students put them down in the simplest manner possible. 
The students get an answer of 8 to 1, which seems correct 
to them because it happens to be a ratio of simple whole 
numbers. 

Of those who made mechanical errors several 
failed to find 1?8 correctly. Two students said that 
1^8 was equal to ZV2.

The students generally consider this section of the 
text relatively easy. This is shown here by the large num¬ 
ber attempting the problem. The poor results are probably 
due to the fact that many students depend too much on the 
answer to show them how to work the problem. The student 
has a general idea of the method. He tries one method of 
solution and checks_with the answer in the text. The 
correct answer generally indicates any error he may have 
made. The student learns to manipulate numbers so that his 



12 - 


answer will check with that given in the book but he does 
not really comprehend how the problem should be solved. 

There were a very large number of mechanical errors 
in the work on this problem. Practically all of these 
errors were in multiplication. 

If a problem such as: "What is the value of 10 04 ?" 
is given, practically all of the students will solve it 
correctly. That is, they have learned how to solve a type 
problem but they fail to understand the principle; so when 
a problem is varied slightly, they do not know what to do.

There was no difficulty evaluating dy . Practically 

ax 

all students can solve simple differentiation if there are 

no difficulties in indices present. 

The chief error in part "C" was in taking dy — ax 

dx Ay 

and so finding the value ofThis is a logical error 

since they have just been asked to find dy . To avoid this 

dx 

error the question might be worded: "Find AT from first 
principles." 

The relatively large number of errors in "G (2)" as 
compared with the errors in "b" is due largely to difficulty 
with "c (1)". 


About one half of those who got "d" correct, solved 

it by finding the value of y for the two given values of x, 

and so finding the average slope. The others founds 

z^x 


using first principles. 

Those -who solved the problem graphically received no 
credit for their effort; yet some received half credit for 
an ans?v ? er of 32, when the correct answer was 3.2. I believe 
that an answer which is approximately correct, as found from 
a graph, is worth more than an unreasonable ansY^er obtained 
from the correct formula. 

96 % of the students solved "c" correctly. That is 

they could find the value of d£ but only 30;$ knew what it 

dx 

was when they had found it.

Many students stopped working when they saw that 
they were not getting ratios expressed in small whole 
numbers. The example in the text has the ratio given as 
10 : 15 : 21 : 14. The students apparently thought they 
had made an error when they did not get small numbers in 
their ratio and so did not try to finish the problem. 

16% of the students made mechanical errors. This 
was much the same as in problem 4. Both problems involved 
approximately the same amount of mechanical work. This 
means that one may expect to find one error in six where 
the work requires several multiplications to be made.

21 °/o of the students could not solve the second part 
of the problem due to trailing error. Problems of this type 
should be avoided as much as possible. 

This type of problem does not require much thought. 
The students learn the rule and then apply it mechanically. 
The fact that only 5% did not try it indicates that the 
students like this type of problem.

The students did not do very well on the graph. They 
don f t know what to do with x - 0. Many of them broke off the 
graph at x = 1 and x = 9. Those who gave the correct 
solution for "e" but did not state how they got it probably 
used their graph.

Apparently very few of the students remembered the 

first rule of differentiation in respect to three variables: 

tr If y is a function of x and x is a function of t^ the rate 

at which y changes is given by dy; = dy; X dx tf 

dt dx dt 

28% of the students tried to find the value of 
(x - 5x + 4) by multiplication. When you consider the 
marks given for the problem this method is obviously not a 
good one. Of all those trying this method less than 1 % 
managed to get the correct result. Probably only the weaker 
students used this method but the percentage of mechanical 
errors was certainly very high. 

The problem is relatively easy in comparison with 
those given in the text but all of this section on differ¬ 
entiation proves to be very difficult for the students.

The large number who did not try this will be made 
up of two groups. One will consist of those who are rushed 
for time and so are looking for easier problems. The others 
are ones who realize that this type of problem is too 
difficult for them.

Some students answered part "d" as follows: "The 
point is a minimum because it is lower than any point on 
either side of it." Of course, the answer expected, was in 
terms of the first and second derivative. This answer 
shows that the student understands the question and prob¬ 
ably deserves credit. 

15$ of the graphs drawn received no credit and 
deserved none. They were freehand sketches in the full 
sense of the word. There were a fairly large number of 
straight line graphs.

A large number of students did not try this question. 
Since a much greater number tried the following problems, 
this is an indication that the students consider this type 
of problem to be quite difficult. 

Students, as a rule, tend to avoid problems involving 
graphs. I believe that the topic of graphs has been handled 
quite badly all through the grades. 

Probably one of the main reasons why graphs have not 
been used and understood better by students is illustrated 
here. In practically all parts of the question some students 
gave an approximate result obtained from the graph. In all 
cases no marks were given for their effort. I believe that 
the students who can draw graphs and get an area or slope 
approximately correct should be given credit for their work. 
They show that they have understood what they have done. 

Part marks are given for problems with ridiculous answers 
where the correct method has been used and a mechanical error 
has been made. In my opinion this policy is bad.

The problem is a standard one and should have been 
easy enough for the majority of the students. 

The chief error in ’’a” was in forgetting the con¬ 
stant. This trailing error affected "b” thus resulting in 
a double penalty. 

The number of mechanical errors was high. This 
shows up in all problems where much mechanical work is 
required.

It was surprising to find that only two thirds of the 
students could find the average of these numbers. This may 
have been due to the number of marks given for the question. 
The correct solution would seem too easy for the number of 
marks given. 

Part n b" is well worded but the fact that in all pre¬ 
vious problems of this type the students had been asked to 
find the n^* 1 term, made them think this was a different type 
of problem. 

Part f! c ,? is merely a test of memory work. Most of 
the students memorize formulae even if they do not understand 
them. This is shown in part ft d tT . The students knew the 
formula but could not apply it to solve the problem.

Of those who had n a" part correct, very few showed 
how they got their result. 5 fo of the students could not get 
the general solution after solving the special case. 

Part rT c rf proved too difficult for the students. The 
examiners expected the students to know the value of jplf23 
but apparently the students did not know this. Probably the 






35 - 


students did know the answer in relation to cubic measure, 
but not having the cue, failed to think of it. 

Another surprise was the relatively large number 
giving an answer of 577 or 1243. Apparently these students 
saw nothing amiss with these results. The students have not 
been trained to check their results against an estimated 
answer to see if their final ansv^er is reasonable. 

In TT d n part, more students gave the sixth terra than 
the fifth. Probably they neglected to count T? l n as a term 
and only thought of terms involving x.

Since answers only were required, we can only infer 
how the incorrect answers were obtained. In some cases the 
incorrect method used is quite obvious. 

The marking was not done any too well in this quest¬ 
ion. In part "e" the answer 4~^ was marked incorrect but 
since the problem is stated using a negative index surely the 
answer is correct using the same form. In part tr g TT a fairly 

large number of students gave answers of J*1 ” or tf -” and re- 

x^ 

ceived no credit. In the first case they gave more than was 
required, in the second case they used a symbol instead of 
a word. In both cases I see no reason for marking them as 
incorrect. 

Part fT b’ f was badly done. Most of the errors were 
due to forgetting to add the constant. This was a common 
error on problem 12 in 1940. 

Part ,T d tT proved to be quite difficult. Students 
experience difficulty whenever zero is encountered. Of those 
who stated that the maximum value is zero probably some really 
meant that the maximum would occur when x = 0. 10$ gave the 

maximum value as -2 1/2. It appears to have been obtained 
by making an equation, -2x = 5, and solving it. Those who 
gave the answer M 4 tT took x = t 1. They took as small a value 
of x as possible and yet avoided fractions and zero. 

On part "d" I made a special check. Of those whose

marks were above the median 80 % got this part correct. Of 
those whose marks were below the median 22%o got this part 
correct. Briefly, this problem rates high as a test of the 
students’ ability as shown by the results of the examination. 

It is uite likely that many of the correct answers 
in part T ’g” were obtained by chance. //hen one considers this, 
the results are quite poor. This is another instance of 
weakness in graphical work. 

Part "h TT could have been solved easily if the students 
had taken special values of x. Pupils should be encouraged 
to take specific cases and so determine the correct solution. 

Parts ’’i” and ”3” indicate that students can get 
answers much better than they can explain results. They have 
learned to manipulate figures but often don’t understand what 
the figures mean.

This problem involved quite a lot of reading in 
order to find out what was required. The problem is up-to- 
date and should arouse pupils 1 interest. The good student 
finds little difficulty with this type of problem. Its 
solution seems to depend more on mental ability than on 
learning a set method. 

The marking could have been better on this problem. 
There were several instances of correct results with no 
marks given. Then there were many papers with correct re¬ 
sults but the answer was not simplified. For example, 27 

36 

was given instead of 3. Many of these were given no credit, 

4 

some were given 1 mark and some i^ere given 2 marks. Some 
correct results were given 2 instead of 3 marks.

Some of these miscellaneous answers were: 

12<W<12; 0<W<66 2/3; 0<CW<25; 

50<W<* 1; 6<W<44. 

Those few having all parts correct had high scores. 

This problem proved to be very difficult for the 
students. The problem does not depend upon memorizing 
some intricate formula. Certainly most of the students 
know how to find the circumference and area of a circle 
when given the diameter. 

The students lack power of visualization. They 
have not learned to make quick sketches to aid them in 
problem solving. 

Trailing error is introduced again in this problem. 
If the first part is not correct the students cannot solve 
part n b w . It is very difficult to avoid all cases of 
trailing error but I believe it should be avoided as much 
as possible. 

Part ”c" should be easy enough for any grade twelve 
student but only 3% got it correct. 79% of the students 
did not try the problem. Possibly this section of the text 
has proven so difficult that the students have become con¬ 
fused. They look for a difficulty which does not exist. 

It would be interesting to find what per cent of the 
grade nine students could solve this problem. If a fair 
number of them could solve it we could assume that this 
topic had not been treated well in grade twelve.

This problem proved to be unusually difficult. In 
part "a" the rule is given but the students clearly do not 
know the conditions under which it applies. 

• In part H b ,f the rule can be used almost directly 
to get the correct result, so a fair number of students 
succeeded in getting it. 

In part tf c ff where the problem had to be changed, 
so that it would take the same form as the example much 
difficulty was experienced. Over 20% of the students gave 
ridiculous answers for part n c tt and apparently did not 
notice anything wrong with them. 

By merely glancing at the problem the student 
should realize that the answer should be slightly over 3. 
If he fails to get this result, when he calculates it, he 
should certainly check his work for errors.

The problem if more difficult than the one given 
the previous year. Students have a great deal of 
difficulty with negative indices. This probably accounts 
for the 20$ lower number of correct answers. It would 
have been better, perhaps, to give one rather simple prob¬ 
lem in integration as well as the more difficult one, to 
find out if they understood the principle.

The results on this problem are much lower than 
on a similar problem in 1940. Apparently teachers are 
not stressing the method of determining Ay . 

Mechanical errors are quite frequent. It is quite 
evident that accuracy and checks are not given major

The students generally like these problems. There 
is a considerable jump in the number who tried this 
problem over the number who tried the three preceding 
questions. 

In part Tt a tT more students tried to solve the prob¬ 
lem as a combination than as a permutation. They failed 
to realize that the same group of three could vary as to 
president, vice-president, and secretary. 

One ansv^er for rt b” was 100,800 and one for n c n was 
237,120. That is, they do not realize when the result is 
ridiculous. 

The problem was quite fair. The first two parts 
should not have caused difficulty if the students really 
understood this section of the text. The last part vms 
more difficult but serves well to test the better students.

Part "a’ 1 can be done without much mental effort. 
Pupils memorize the method and then apply it without much 
thought as to what is implied. The relatively high 
percentage correct indicates this quite well. The per¬ 
centage of mechanical errors is fairly high but not above 
normal where this amount of work is required.

Part T, a Tt should be easy enough for anyone who 
has taken first year of algebra. Some of those, who did 
not try it, may set have thought it was*worth trying, 
since so few marks were given and their time may have 
been nearly up. 

In part tT c n , 6% of the students just gave the 
points where the curve crossed the axis. Probably the 
students were rushed and did not read the question care¬ 
fully enough to see what was required. 

The students who tried part ff d tT had a great deal 
of difficulty in finding the height of the triangle. Some 
of them tried to get the equation of each line and so 
solve the point of intersection. Many different types of 
errors were made.

of similar objects. It is a good problem and should have 
been handled better by the students. 

Pictograms are very often interpreted wrongly in 


much the same manner as the students handled this question

Most graphs, which the students are required to

draw, have y plotted against x. That is probably the 
reason why so many tried to work this question in this 


manner. 






- 75 


In part "d" all work reasonably accurate was 
considered correct. The ones listed as mechanical errors 
gave results far from correct. 

Since "d" part was wrong in many cases, parts "e" 
and "f" could not be solved correctly. This is another 
place where trailing error occurs. Students do not clearly 
understand what the equation y - mx f b represents. 

The marking on this problem was certainly not good. 
In part "a" several students were given credit on the 
graph part of the paper and also on their foolscap sheet. 

On part "b n the point in error is (5.8, 11.5) if 

one considers y plotted against x. It is (14.44, 11.5) if 

2 

one considers y plotted against- x . The markers were not 
consistent in marking these two answers. In many cases 
either one was given credit; in other cases either one was 
marked incorrect. 

On part f? c tT the majority of the students who - had 
plotted y against x were given no credit for the best 
fitting straight line drawn through these points. Some 
of them however were given credit for this result.

Apparently there was much guessing done on the 

first part of this question. Most of those who were 

wrong, stated that the first two' parts would be negative 

and the last two parts would be positive. This answer was 

favored, probably, because x has negative values in the 

first two cases and positive values in the last two cases. 

Part of the trouble with those who showed their 

work was in finding d^ of 1. This involves the use of the 

dx x 

negative index which always seems to confuse students. 
Trailing error was very much in evidence in this problem. 

The graph was very badly done. Since this question 
is very near the end of the paper; it is quite likely that 
many of the students did not have time to finish all of 
the paper; so decided it would take too much time to draw 
the graph.

Probably many of those who got the correct result

The following incorrect answers were fairly 

common: 

ft It gives minimum values.” 

"Where curve crosses x and y axes we get the 
roots of the equation." 

"Equation gives you turning points, and 
maximum and minimum values." 

"The roots tell you vhiere the curve crosses 
the x axis." 







81 - 


"It gives the value of x when y = 0" 

"where graphs cross, the roots are real and 
equal." 

Most of the students tried this question-. Prac¬ 
tically all of the graphs were drawn by making a table of 
values. Many of those who did use factors made errors in 
factoring. 

Part "b" was answered much better than one would 


expect from results on previous graph questions

The first three questions are quite simple ratio 
problems. The lower percentage correct on the first 
problem is probably due to the wording of the problem. In 
nearly all problems of this type the question is, "what is 
the ratio of x:y?" 

Question 3 was answered better than the other two. 
It seems to be a more difficult problem but of course the 
students can mentally check their results by using concrete 
examples. Apparently about ten per cent do not know the 
meaning of "inverse ratio." 

Question 1 indicates that students are not much 
concerned about checking their results. 3 2% gave the ratio 
as 5/4. A simple check would have shown them that this was 



incorrect

This problem proved to be very difficult for the 
students. Over half of them forgot about the diameter, 
or straight side, of the semicircle. 

Although it did prove to be difficult I believe 
that this is a very good problem. The “wording is clear 
and if the students visualize or sketch the figure it 
should not prove troublesome. 

The students have had very little practice in 
formula construction and so are often afraid to try. Very 
little emphasis is placed on this topic anywhere in the 
high school course.

This is a problem which should not be too difficult 
for anyone who has taken Algebra 1. Part of the difficulty 
is probably due to the fact that students often take 
Algebra 1 in grade ten and then take Algebra 2 in grade 
twelve. This means that the students often forget a great 
deal that was learned in the first algebra course by the 
time they start the second course.

In question 41 and 42 we find that the students 
cannot read graphs. In question 41 many of them lost marks 
for not stating that the change was a rise. Probably many 
of them thought this was so obvious it was not necessary 


to state it.

A large number of students forgot to state the 
sign in their answer. They were given three marks out of 
four in this case which I think was quite fair. 

15$ of the students just ignored the index in y 2 . 
Some probably did not notice it and some probably did not 
,'know what to do with it. 

We again find students who do not understand how 
to use fractional indices. Negative and fractional indices 
should be given more attention in school.

One-third of the students found the values of x at 
which there was a maximum or a minimum but they did not 
calculate the maximum and minimum values. There was some 
variation in marking this result. In most cases it was 
given two marks but in others it was given four marks. I 
believe that four marks is a fairer value when one considers 
what part of the work has been done correctly.

The wording of this question tended to confuse 
the students. Many of them probably knew the correct area, 
but when asked to mark it with four lines; the found they 
had two lines extra, so they put them in some place. 

It would have been better to say "shade the area" 
instead of asking for it to be shown by four heavy lines. 

Question 48

This problem proved to be too difficult for any of 
the students. Most of the students could not construct 
the formula and set up the integral. Those who did succeed 
in doing this made errors in integration or made mechanical 
errors. Either this section has been presented badly or it 
is too advanced for high school students.

Students who have taken grade twelve mathematics 
should be able to solve a problem like this. As a matter 
of fact, it used to be.done in grade nine arithmetic and 
did not prove too difficult then. 

I believe that the section of the text on annuities, 
perpetuities, and capitalization, confuse the students so 
much; that they fail to solve simple problems like the one 
given here. 

This topic could be presented in a much simpler 
form. Apparently teachers have not shown the students the 
easier method of solving problems of this type. The 
text gives a method and the instructors follow this 


me thod.

Some of the difficulty in this problem is due to 
failure to read the question carefully. 27% gave the 
answer based on choosing one non-fiction book. The students 
take rt at least one ft to mean merely "one’ 1 . 

While this difficulty arises in all problems it 
causes more trouble in this section of the book than in any 
other. Students must learn to read carefully in order to 
see what is given and what is required.

The table above shows that the examinations were 
excellent, in allotment of marks for each section of the 
text. The problems on the examination seem to be fair 
samples of those in the text in regard to. difficulty. 

Each question was classified as to its topic. Then 
the average percentage„correct for every problem from a 
section was found. Some of the problems in certain sections 
were relatively easy and some were relatively difficult. It 
must be admitted that the final average obtained therefore 
is not an exact picture but they probably show the relative 
difficulty of the sections. The percentages correct do not

total marks. From this, I had hoped to find which problems 
served best, for selecting the better students.

are much better than others for testing the general ability 
of students. The extremely small number, in some cases, who 
did have the correct answer; makes any general conclusions 
unwarranted. 







CHAPTER VII 


COMMENTS 

The 1942 paper had fifty-six questions on it. 

The table of results show that a much higher percentage 
of the problems were attempted than on the two previous 
papers. This would indicate that the paper was not too 
long. 

The 1942 paper eliminates trailing error which 
shows up so much on the first two examinations. This is 
the chief advantage of this type of examination. 

The results obtained on problems of approximately 
the same type, as shown in the table in the summary, 
indicate that the quality of the students for the three 
years remains about the same. 

The marking in the 1941 paper was not good. On 
this examination there were too many careless mistakes 
made by the markers and there seemed to be a poor system 
used for allowing partial credit for questions.

The above difficulties are the principal causes of 
the poor results on the last three examinations. .aving 
found the cause can we find a cure? 

The most outstanding weakness is in simple arithmet¬ 
ical calculations. This is especially apparent in multipli¬ 
cation. Where problems were given which required multipli¬ 
cation the average error in this alone was about twelve per 
cent. 

Several remedies are available. One, is to insist 
on a higher standard in the lower grades. A second, is to 
take short periods for practice in the high school. A third 
one, and one that should be insisted on at all times, is to 
check the result. One of the simplest and fastest methods 
is to obtain the approximate answer by inspection and compaie 
the final answer with it. 

As an illustration of the importance of this point 
let us consider Air Navigation. Our students fail these 
examinations, and, what is much worse, lose their lives; not 
because the subject is so difficult that they cannot under¬ 
stand it, but because they cannot add, subtract, multiply 
and divide. They never learned to check their results in 
school and it is hard to break old habits. They put down a 
wind of 1S0/40K when it should be 360/40K and end up in the 
sea when a simple check of their result would have shown 
them their error.

Teachers and examiners are at fault for allowing 
nearly full marks for these so-called mechanical errors. 
Rightfully enough, perhaps, when it is in the second or 
third decimal place but fatal practice when ridiculous 
answers are given nearly full credit. 

Another point in connection with this is the fail¬ 
ure to allow credit for an answer obtained from a graph. 
Often in practice, an approximate answer as found from a 
graph is all that is required; yet this is discouraged in 
every way. 

Teachers and students have apparently paid little 

attention to the excellent treatment given in the text for 

finding/\y and showing what it means. In all problems 

where /\y was desired the percentage correct was very 

small but nearly all of the students could find dy. Stu- 

dx 

dents should certainly understand what they are trying to 
do before rushing ahead with a method which will give a 
correct result but may be meaningless. 

Students have learned how to draw graphs but they 
have not learned how to use them. This type of learning 
is of little value. Somewhere in the high school course, 
students should really learn how to use graphs. Then, 
having learned how to use them; they should be encouraged 
to use them at every opportunity. It is not laboriously 
drawn, exact, graphs that we should demand; but quick, 
rough, sketches which give us a picture of the problem.

Get an approximate answer from a sketch; and then, work 
out the problem; should be the general procedure in many 
cases. 

The difficulties listed in Class A are chiefly 
problems for the lower grades. No teaching of advanced 
principles can give good results when the elementary 
principles are not understood. 

The difficulties listed in Class B are problems 
for the individual instructor. In some cases a simpler 
approach to the problem will enable the student to under¬ 
stand it. In other cases more definite instruction is 
required.- In all cases more practice in working simple 
problems, in which the principle is involved, should be 
carried out. 

The difficulties listed in Class C are in a differ¬ 
ent category. I believe that the text itself is largely 
to blame here. The topics are either too difficult for 
students at this level or the treatment of the topics in 
the text is not satisfactory.

' The Text 

The results have been bad and the first thing to 
be blamed is the text. Let us consider it. 

Algebra 2 is only required by those students who 
intend to go to university. For all others it is an option 
which they may take if they wish; the only requirement being, 
that they have credit in Algebra 1. 

The text has been prepared primarily for those who 
are comparatively good in mathematics. It is intended, I 
believe, to test the students’ ability to do University work. 
For this purpose I believe it is good. For the average 
G-rade twelve student, however, I believe it is not satis¬ 
factory. 

If we can find some method to prevent those students 
who are not fitted for it, from taking Algebra 2, then the 
text is excellent. If we cannot, then the ham done to these 
students is too great to balance the good. The weak student 
needs to build up confidence and confidence is destroyed when 
students attempt that which is completely beyond them. 

One section of the text should be omitted for all 
students or else treated much more fully. This is the sec¬ 
tion on Annuities and Perpetuities. Probably 95% of the 
students leave this section of the book in a thorough muddle. 
They .are so completely bewildered, that they even forget what 
they once knew. Omit this section and one of the big diffi¬ 
culties in this course will disappear.
