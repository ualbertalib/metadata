CHAPTER !• 


PURPOSE OP THE INVESTIGATION. 

The complete purpose of this study is to discover just 
how selective our educational system has become. In other 
words, is there equal opportunity in education? Has occupa¬ 
tion of parents or economic status of parent or guardian any¬ 
thing to do with who goes to our high schools, universities 
and normal schools? One of the aims of modern education is 
to see that all have an equal chance to get higher education. 
Our aim in this investigation is to determine whether or not 
this equal chance exists. 

The problem will be considered from various angles 
and an attempt will be made to answer questions such as the 
following: 

1. Why are enrolments in the High School grades 

so much smaller than they are in the Elementary 
and Intermediate School Grades? 

2. What is the probability that a child, whose father 
is in one of the professions (or any of the other 
vocational groups), will get the advantages of a 
high school education? 

3. What is the probability of a child now in high 
school getting to University? How does this 
vary for the different vocational groups?

4. What is the probability of a student now in high 
school getting to Normal? How does this vary 
for the different vocational groups? 

5. What relationship exists between economic status 
of parents and post graduation plans of students? 

6. Does the standing obtained on the Grade IX 
examinations and the economic status of parents 
influence the probability that a High School 
Student will get University or Normal School 
Training? 

The survey is being carried out in two parts of the 
Province of Alberta. One study is under way in the city of 
Edmonton; this study, herein reported, is confined to the 
Cardston Inspectorate, which is largely a rural area. The 
findings should be fairly indicative of the conditions 
prevalent in the entire Province.

CHAPTER II 


DESCRIPTION OP AREA (CARDSTON INSPECTORATE) 

WHERE INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED OUT. 

I shall first describe the area included in the Cardston 
Inspectorate. I believe that the data, and the conclusions 
drawn from them will be more significant and meaningful if 
every reader is acquainted with the territory and with the 
general conditions foiind therein. 

By giving a full description of this area, I wish to 
show that it is one of the most prosperous districts in the 
Province, and, also, that St. Mary’s River School Division, 
which makes up the larger part of the Cardston Inspectorate, 
does as much or more to provide educational facilities and 
opportunities than does any other School Division. Such being 
the case, if hl^er education for the people in this area is 
found to be selective, then I feel that we would be fairly 
safe in saying that it is selective over the entire Province. 

The Cardston Inspectorate is in the extreme south-west 
corner of Alberta. Its exact location is shown in Figure 1. 
Most of it is a highly productive area, the normal amount of 
rainfsLll being great enough to ensure a good crop every year. 
However, there is considerable acreage under irilgation aro\md 
Glenwood, Hill Spring, Magrath and Raymond. On the irrigated 
land sugar beets are grown extensively. However, throu^out

the entire area wheat Is the chief crop. In the foothills 
there Is a considerable amooint of ranching. 

There are woollen Mills at Magrath. Due to certain 
war orders to he filled, these mills are running continuous¬ 
ly. There is a large sugar factory at Raymond. It has a 
huge payroll during the maniifacturing period and a certain 
number of men and women are employed the year round. On 
the whole i-^j^ght be said that the people in this Inspectorate 
are well off financially. All farm and ranch lands are very 
productive, and the two factories furnish employment to large 
numbers of people. 

The Blood Indian Reserve runs down through the centre 
of the Inspectorate, almost cutting it in two . The educa¬ 
tion of the Indians is taken care of by two large residential 
church schools, St. Mary^s Catholic School and St. Faults 
Anglican School. Also, within the boundaries of the 
Cardston Inspectorate, are fourteen Colonies of the 
Hutterlan Brothers. There is a one-room school located 
in each Colony. It is quite the exception in a Hutterite 
school, or in an Indian School, to have any student go 
beyond Grade Eight. In fact many stop before this grade 
is reached. At the present time there are no students

in the Colony Schools tsiklng work beyond the eighth grade, 
and there are only two Indians who are taking work beyond 
this level of attainment. It is therefore evident that a 
large portion of this Inspectorate is settled by people who 
are not greatly concerned about higher education of any kind. 

Educational Facilities and Opportunities. 

Every student in the Cardston Inspectorate has an 
opportunity to get a high school education. I might ex¬ 
plain that the Cardston Inspectorate includes the St. Mary’s 
River School Division and five outside districts. These 
other school districts are Cardston, Galt (Stirling), 

Magrath, Raymond and V/aterton Park. Figure 2 shows the 
exact location of these centres. 

Figure 3, on page 8, gives the location of Divisional 
Schools that offer instruction in the High School grades. 
W^^ilght list and classify them as follows: 

There are 2 six-room schools, offering Instruction 
in all grades from I to XII inclusive. These are located 
at Glenwood and Hill Spring . At these centres, two 
rooms are devoted exclusively to the work of Grades IX to XII. 
There are 4 four-room schools offering instruction in all the 
grades. The two senior rooms in each of these schools handle 
the work from Grade VII to Grade XII inclusive. Under this

arrangement no High School room In any of these four schools 
offers more than seventy high school credits. In other 
words, we may say that the arrangement makes it necessary for 
students to take four years of high school before they 
graduate. However, such is not the exception in any high 
school in the Province. These four schools are located at 
Del Bonita , Jefferson , Motintain View and Provo * 

At the 2 three-room schools, located at Spring Coulee 
and Leavitt , credits are offered up to and Including Grade 
XI. There are 5 two-room schools that are prepared to 
offer a similar programme. These are at Aetna , Beazer , 
Botindary Creek , Kimball and Woolford . In the two and 
three-room schools we are working on what we call a three- 
year cycle. That Is, every student Is given the opportunity 
to get all of the Grades X and XI credits In three years. 

In addition to the Divisional High School centres 
listed above, there are 5 one-room schools In the Division 
that are offering Instruction In Grade IX. These are 
Carway , Harrlsvllle , Mammoth , O.K. , and Park Bend . 

Of the five schools outside the Division, four of 
them are large centres and offer Instruction to the end of 
Grade XII. These are Cardston, Magrath, Raymond and 
Stirling (Galt S.D). Waterton Park has a two-room school 
Sind offers Instruction to the end of Grade XI.

There are 62 Schools Districts in the Cardston Inspec¬ 
torate; 57 of these are included in the St. Mary’s River 
School Division, and, as stated before, 5 are outside the 
Division. In the 57 districts there is an operating school 
in each of 32. The children in the other 25 districts are 
transported by van to larger centres, or the parents con¬ 
cerned are paid a certain fee in lieu of transportation. 

Thus all the pupils in these closed districts have an 
opportunity to attend a school which, in most cases, is 
one of the larger ones in the Inspectorate. 

In the districts where schools are operating, 
financial assistance is given by the School Division to 
those students who wish to proceed with higher work than 
that which is offered in their own district schools. First, 
there is an allowance in lieu of transportation. Pupils 
in Grade IX are allowed three dollars per month, while the 
stiidents of Hi^ School Grades are given six dollars per month. 
In order to get this aimount they must attend at least eighteen 
days during the month. If they attend for a lesser period 
they are paid at the rate of thirty cents a day. 

If a High School student resides at a point which is 
closer fo one of our Divisional schools than it is to a town 
school outside the Division, he or she is expected to attend 
the Divisional School. However, if they wish to do other-

wise, they may do so at their own expense. If the place 
of residence is closer to a town school, and if the subjects 
offered at the school in their own district are not the ones 
desired, then they are permitted to attend the town school, 
and the Divisional Board makes a certain allowance for tuition. 
This is in addition to the transportation fee. Four dollars 
per month is allowed for Grades X and XI, and five dollars 
for Grade XII. Therefore it is apparent that, under certain 
circumstances, a student can get as much as eleven dollars 
($11) per month to assist in defraying his costs of education 
if he attends an outside school. 

It is a policy of the St. Mary’s River Divisional 
Board to centralize educational facilities wherever possible. 

An adequate van service has been provided to serve these 
centralized schools. From this statement, and the fore¬ 
going explanations, it should be clear that the St. Mary’s 
River School Division is doing its best to see that all 
divisional students get an opportunity to attend a high 
school. In other words, we might say that a considerable 
simount has been done to break down the selectiveness of 
secondary education.

CHAPTER III 


METHODS EMPLOYED IN CARRYING OUT INVESTIGATION. 

Description and Distribution of Material. 

To get the information required for this study 
a special questionnaire was drafted. These questionnaires, 
together with teachers’ instruction sheets, were distributed 
to all schools Included in the survey and were cinmpleted by 
all the students in Grades IX, X, XI and XII. 

Accompanying the material distributed, a personal 
letter was addressed to each of the teachers concerned, 
giving the p\irpose of the survey and asking for cooperation. 
The letter suggested that the questionnaire sheets be given 
out to the students on the 14th or 17th of November. In 
other words, an attempt was made to have all the survey 
sheets completed at approximately the same time throughout 
the entire Inspectorate. The letter also requested that a 
detailed account be made, on the day the questionnaires were 
distributed, of the actual total enrolment of each school 
in order that the total enrolment for each grade in the entire 
Inspectorate could be obtained. All completed questionnaires 
were returned to me by mail. 

To facilitate the matter of following this report 
a copy of the Survey Q:uestionnaire follows.

CHAPTER IV. 


ENROLMENTS OF SCHOOLS INCLUDED IN SURVEY. 

There were twenty-seven schools included in this survey 
twenty-two Divisional Schools and the five schools outside 
the Division. That is, there are twenty-seven schools in 
the Cardston Inspectorate besides the Indian and Hutterlte 
Schools. Twenty-three of these offer instruction in one or 
more of Grades IX, X, XI and XII. 

The following table gives the total enrolments for 
all Grades in the twenty-seven Schools already referred to.

^iVhen Table I is analysed some interesting informa¬ 
tion is brought to light. First, it is quite evident 
that attendance in Grades I to IX is more or less uniform. 
For certain reasons drop-outs increase throughout the 
H igh School Grades. 

The average enrolment in the first nine grades 
is 289.8. This is more than twice as great as the en¬ 
rolment of Grade XII. The percentage decrease in enrolment 
from Grade IX to Grade XII is 46.4, or an average of 15.5 
per cent decrease per school grade. When one considers 
the fact that most of the students take four years to 
complete the three high school grades, it is clear that 
the number of drop-outs before reaching Grade XII is 
really greater than these data show. 

There may be several influencing factors which 
would cause over half the students in this Inspectorate 
to drop out before reaching Grade XII. No doubt the 
chief ones would be some or all of the follov/ing: 

1. Lack of interest on part of stu-dent or parent. 

2. Lack of finances. 

§. Poor or failure standing of student.

Th© answer to this question could be obtained 
only by having complete Information on these people who 
have left school. A partial ahalysls of this problem 
will be attempted in a later chapter. However, even 
in the absence of any further evidence, I believe we 
would be safe in saying that the trend indicates a 
certain degree of selectiveness for secondary education.

CHAPTER V 


VOCATIONS OF PARENTS OR GUARDIANS AND THE 
SELECTIVENESS OP SECONDARY EDUCATION. 

High School Enrolment. 

The basic information for this part of the report 
is tabulated in Table II on the following page. The 
vocations of parents are listed in the same order as 
they occur on the Survey Questionnaires. All students 
in Grade IX completed questionnaires as well as those in 
the High School Grades. Consequently, Grade IX is in¬ 
cluded in certain tabulations. In some cases, it will 
be seen that relationships between Grade IX and Grade 
XII are quite Indicative of definite trends which show 
the selective character of education in these higher 
grades. 


In all tabulations, the number of students listed 
in each category is the total for all schools in the area. 
Table II shows that 513 students out of 809 have parents 
or guardians who belong to the Agricultural group. That 
is, 63.3 per cent of all students of Grades IX, X, XI and XII 
in the Cardston Inspectorate borne from the Agricultural 
Group. The rest of the students are fairly well distributed 
among the other sixteen vocation groupings. In fact, the 
sample is so small in certain cases that it is difficult 
to draw conclusions or make comparisons with any degree 
of accuracy. For this reason it appears necessary to 
combine related groups.

The ’'Proprietor*' £Lnd "Managerial Service" groups mi^t 
be combined to form a "Business" group. The Commercial and 
Clerical Services are similar and could be combined. Ihls 
is also true of the various trade groups, i.e., vocations 7, 

8, 9, 10 and 11 on the original list. Then Public and Per¬ 
sonal Services could be considered together. However, certain 
other groups, such as "Professional" and "Agricultural", must 
be taken separately. Group No. 15 of the original list might 
be left out as there are only 2 out of 809 in this group. It 
will be necessary to omit No. 17, "Occupation Unknown", from 
the revised list, as we are Interested in specific vocations 
only. 

The Revised List of Vocations will read as follows: 

1. Business 

2. Professional Service 

3. Commercial & Clerical 

4. Agricultural Service 

5. Trades 

6. Transportation 

7. Public & Personal Ser. 

8. Common Labor 

In the Tables and Figures of the succeeding pages, all 
students are grouped, v/here necessary, to make eight vocation¬ 
al groups instead of seventeen.

Students going to University 

After knowing how the 809 students, as subjects of 
this Survey, are classified as to grades and vocations of 
parents, we might investigate the probability of a student 
now in High School getting to University and how this prob¬ 
ability varies for the different vocational groups. The 
following Table includes only those students who are in the 
three High School grades at the present time, l*e., grades 
X, XI and XII.

Prom the foregoing Table and Figure, it is quite 
noticeable that the Professional Group leads all others in 
this particular piece of investigation. That is, there is a 
greater probability that a student, whose parent is in one 
of the professions, will get a University Education than it 
is for a student from any other group. 

We might interpret the data further as follows: If a 
student has a parent, who is classified in the Business 
group, there is a probability of 44.7 per cent that he will 
go to University; if his parent is in one of the professions, 
the probability is 70.6 per cent, and so on for the rest of 
the vocational groups. 

The percentage of students going to University from 
the different groups varies from 7.7 to 70.6 This is a wide 
range of probabilities and consequently one may say that 
there is a hi^ degree of selectiveness in education, as far 
as High School students going to University is concerned. 

Students going to Normal. 

In a similar manner we might investigate the prob¬ 
ability of a student now in High School getting to Normal 
and, also, how this probability varies for the different 
vocational groups. Table IV gives a summary of the findings 
in this regard and the same data is represented graphically 
in Figure 6.

The prohahility of a student going to Normal is slightly 
greatest for the Common Labor group, that is, 27*8 per cent* 

The probabilities for students from the professional and agric¬ 
ultural groups getting to Normal School are approximately the 
same, 23.5 per cent and 23.4 per cent, respectively. Percent¬ 
ages going to Normal from groups 5 and 7 are very low, while 
there are no students, whose parents are engaged in the trans¬ 
portation services, going to Normal.

selectivity for the groups of students going to Normal is not 
as great as it is for those going to University. Neither is 
the Normal School training as popular a choice as is University 
training. 

It is interesting to compare the percentages of students, 
for each vocational group, going to University with the percent¬ 
ages of students going to Normal. This comparison is made clear 
in Figure 7. 

In order to make a complete interpretation of these data 
one must realize that University training takes three or more 
years while the Normal School course takes one year. The time 
and cost for University training are considerably greater than 
for Normal training. Realizing these facts, we must conclude 
that the comparison in question gives more definite evidence 
of the selectiveness of secondary education. 

As stated before, the percentages of students going to 
University are very high for certain groups and very low for 
others. That is, where more time and money are necessarily in¬ 
volved, the range of percentages is quite large. The converse 
is true for Normal School training where time and money needed 
is much less than it is for University training. 

Professional people are usually regarded as taking the 
lead in the pursuit of higher education for their children. 

They are also prominent in affairs of state. Perhaps it is

not only their financial standing that is responsible for the 
fact, that the greater percentage of students from this group 
continue education beyond the secondary level but, also, be¬ 
cause the parents in this group realize more fully the necess¬ 
ity of higher education. It has been more or less traditional 
for a child of a professional parent to continue his studies 
mitil he has graduated from some University, College or Normal 
School. 


It is also true that, until more recent times, certain 
vocations, such as Agriculture and Common Labor, have been con¬ 
sidered by many to be less desirable than business or the pro¬ 
fessions. The Professional Service still carries considerable 
prestige. 

Prom the comparisons and observations made in this 
chapter, we have further evidence that secondary and higher 
education are selective in character as far as the students 
of the Cardston Inspectorate are concerned.

CHAPTER VI 

ECONOMIC STATUS OF PARENTS AND ITS INFLUENCE 

ON POST GRADUATION PLANS OP STUDENTS. 

A considerable amount of Information in regard to the 
economic status of parents and guardians was obtained from the 
survey questionnaires. In fact, so much information was given 
that I have chosen to investigate the entire question from 
three different angles. Consequently, this chapter is divided 
into three parts. 

Part 1; Economic Status of Parents, based on ownership of 
Business and Home, and its influence on post grad¬ 
uation plans of students. 

First, I have considered the economic status from the 
standpoint of ownership in regard to Business and Home . To 
do this I divided all students in Grades IX to XII, inclusive, 

into two groups - those who are resident in the country and 

villages and those who are resident in towns. There are several 
villages in this area but, in practically all cases, the people 
who live in them are farmers, who operate farms in the summer 
and live in the villages during the winter months. Therefore, 
it is evident that in many v/ays, the conditions of those living 
in the villages are quite similar to those living in the count- 

In the country several rent the farms they operate, and 
in such cases, they are considered as ov/nlng neither Business

nor Home. By the classification of parents into three groups, 
a definite trend in regard to plans of hi^ school students 
following graduation is evidenced. The three classes referred 
to are: those who own both Business and Home, those who own 
either Business or Home and those who own neither Business 
nor home. In the tables these conditions are referred to 
as frequencies two, one and zero. As indicated heretofore, 
this part of the survey includes the students in Grade IX, 
the final year of the Intermediate School, with the three 
High School grades. 

All students are divided into four groups : those 
who plan on attending both University and the Normal School, 
those who intend to go to University, and those who plan on 
attending the Normal School only. Those who have other or 
no plans are grouped in one class. 

The dtudents resident in towns have been classified 
in a similar manner and listed against the three parent 
groupings. 

The information obtained in regard to ownership 
was compiled and recorded on separate sheets. They follow 
in order of grades. All data were summarized to assist in 
drawing conclusions.

The data on each grade supply interesting material for 
study and certain conclusions could be dravm from each table. 
However, in this instance we are more interested in the total 
higli school enrolment and, therefoi'e, tables and figures that 
suiTimarize the data are used.

The above table is a complete summary. All students 
from Grades IX, X, XI ahd XII are Included. From the informa¬ 
tion given we can draw the following conclusions; 

1. The higher the economic status of parents the greater 
is the percentage of students going to University. 

2. The higher the economic status of parents the greater 
is the percentage of students going to Normal. 

3. As the economic status of parents decreases the 
percentage of students not going to either Uni¬ 
versity or Normal Increases.

Table IX shov/s that two percentages for students 
going to University are similar. These are for students whose 
parents own both Business and Home and those whose parents own 
either Business or Home. There are also t wo percentages in 
the Normal School column that are nearly the same. If the 
percentages in both the University and Normal School columns 
are considered together, the trend is more definite. 

For example, we might place all students who are going 
to either University or Normal in one group. Then this group 
could be compared with the group of students who are not going 
to either University or Normal. In the following table this 
classification is shown in its relation to the economic status 
of parents. The students who live in the country or villages 
are shown separately from those who live in towns. 

Conclusions and Comparisons. 

The data on students who reside in the country or 
in villages show that post graduation plans are definitely 
influenced by the economic status of their parents as 
measured by ownership of Business and Home. 44.4 per cent 
of students whose parents own both Business and Home are going 
to the University or Normal or both. 42.1 per cent of students 
whose parents own either Business or Home are going to University 
or Normal or both. 37.0 per cent of students whose parents 
own neither Business nor Home have similar plans. That is,

as degree of ownership descreases so, also, does the percentage 
of students who plan on taking work beyond the secondary level. 

Similarly, the data on students resident In towns 
show that students' post graduation plans are Influenced by 
economic status of parents. For economic status frequencies 
2, 1 and 0 the percentages of students going to University 
or Normal or both are 56.3, 52.8 and 36.0 respectively. There 
Is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of students who 
plan on continuing their studies after High School for the 
group whose parents own neither Business nor Home. 

A comparison between the percentages of country and 
village students going to University or Normal or both, and 
town students going to University or Normal or both, is shown . 
graphically in Figure 8. 

Comparing the two graph lines, it is evident that 
ownership in towns has a greater influence on students' 
post graduation plans than does ownership in the country and 
villages. Where there is no ovrnershlp the influence appears 
to be about equal for the two groups. 

Part 2. Economic Status of Parents, based on Income Tax, 

Life Insurance and ownership of Motor Car, and its 
influence upon students' post graduation plans. 

This investigation is similar to the one just pre¬ 


ceding. The chief difference being that economic status is

her© measured by three factors: (1) Tax on Income, 

(2) Life Insurance, (3) Ownership of Motor Car. 

After careful consideration of a sample group, 

I decided that using these three factors in one in¬ 
vestigation would be more indicative of economic status 
than would each one considered separately. For example, 
ownership of a motor car is rather common and quite 
often a parent with a fair income pays no tax because 
of his exemptions. In the case of Life Insurance, one 
often finds that a person in a lower income bracket is a 
holder of a small policy. 

The compiled information follows in tables that are 
arranged in order of school grades. The economic status 
frequencies three, two and one,and zero refer to the 
factors stated above. For example, a parent whose 
frequency is three pays income tax, has a Life Insurance 
Policy and owns a car. If two of these are true the 
frequency is two, and so on for the other frequencies. 
l^Vhere the father is deceased this Information is not 
readily available for the guardian, therefore such cases 
are treated separately.

Now we might calculate the percentage of students 
going to University, the percentage of students going to 
Normal and the percentage of students not going to either. 
This information is given in table IVT.

There are at least two definite conclusions that we 
might draw from Table XVI: 

1. The higher the economic status of parents, the 
greater is the percentage of students going to 
University. 

2. As the economic status of parents decreases the 
percentage of students not going to either Uni¬ 
versity or Normal increases. 

No doubt the percentages in the University column bear 
a certain relation to the percentages in the Normal School 
column. That is, when a percentage is high, as is the first 
one in the University column, the corresponding percentage in 
the Normal School column is not as large as we might have 
reason to expect. So, again, we might group all students who 
are going to University or Normal or both,in order to get 
another viev/ of the situation.

The above table shows that 61.1 per cent of the students 
whose parents pay Income Tax, have Life Insurance, and own a 
motor car are going to University or Normal or both. For fre¬ 
quencies 2, 1 and 0 the percentages of students going to 
University or Normal or both are 49, 45.3 and 37, respectively. 
From this table we might conclude as follows: 

1. As the economic status of parents increases so also 
does the percentage of students going to University 
or Normal or both increase. 

2. Conversely, as the economic status of parents increases, 
the percentage of students not going to University or 
Normal or both,decreases. 

A graphical representation of the two columns of percent¬ 
ages given in Table XVII is shown in Figure 9.

Part 3. 


Economic Status ol* Parents, based on the number of 
Conveniences found in the home, and its influence 
upon post graduation plans or students. 


The economic status of parents for this section is based 
on the number of conveniences found In the home. The conveniences 
referred to are those given in Section 33 of the Survey Question- 
naire. They are as follows; 


1. 

piano 

6. vacuum cleaner 

2. 

radio 

7. ice refrigerator 

3. 

telephone 

8. electric or gas refrigerator. 

4. 

typev/riter 

9. bathroom • 

5. 

writing desk 

10. bicycle. 


In table XVIII students coming from homes having from 
six to nine of the above conveniences are placed in one group, 
while those coming from homes having from three to five of the 
conveniences are placed in another group, and students coming from 
homes having from zero to two conveniences are placed in a third 
group. These economic states are given as frequencies 6-9, 3^5 
and 0-2 respectively.

After an examination of Table XVIII we might conclude 
as follows: 

1. The higher the economic status of parents, the 
greater is the percentage of students going to 
University. 

2.As the economic status of parents decreases, the 

percentage of students not going to either University 
or Normal increases. 

If we group all students going to University or Normal, 
or both, and consider the percentages in relation to number of 
conveniences in the home, it is obvious from an examination of 
the data that we would get similar results to those in Table 
XVII and Figure 9 of Part 2. 

In the three parts of this chapter v/e have found that 
economic status is a definite influence for students going to 
University, but the influence is not as great for students going 
to Normal. However, the conclusion that secondary education is 
selective in this area is not upset by such an observation. 

This chapter does show that where University training is cantem- 
plated, economic status of parents must necessarily be high.

CHAPTER VII. 


GRADE IX STANDINGS AND ECONOMIC STaTUS OF PARENTS 
IN RELATION TO POST GRADUATION PLANS OF STUDENTS. 

Prom the following Tables we should be able to judge 
the effect, if any, of Grade IX standing obtained and the 
number of conveniences found In the home, on the student’s 
regard for higher education. 

The conveniences referred to are those listed in 
section 33 of the Survey Questionnaire, but, instead of 
using three frequency groupings, 6-9, 3-5 and 0-2, as we did 
in Chapter VI, Part 3, I have chosen to use eleven groupings, 
namely, frequencies 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 8, 1 and 0. 

After listing the students who are going to University 
or Normal or both, I added the number going to both to those 
going to University and also to those going to Normal. 

This have the total going to University and the total going 
to Normal. 

The first table is a summary and serves as a basis 
from which to work. It also serves as a check on most of the 
numbers found in succeeding tables. Some students neglected 
to indicate the Grade IX standing obtained. These are included 
on the first table but are omitted from the succeeding ones.

Prom the preceding Tables and Figures, the following 
facts are evident: 

1. The higher the standing obtained on the Grade IX exam¬ 
inations, the greater is the tendency for a student to select 
University training. 

2. The greater the number of conveniences foiuid in the 
home, the higher are the standings obtained on the Grade IX 
final examinations, 

3. It naturally follows that, on the average, the more 
conveniences found in the home, the greater is the tendency for 

students to select University training. 

4. For those students who select Normal School training, 
the number of conveniences is not as great and the Grade IX

standings aro not as high, on the average, as they are Tor 
students going to University. 

Considering the relative costs of University training 
and Normal School training, again we conclude that secondary 
education is selective in every sense of the word. 

Table XXIII Includes only those students who Indicated 
either University or Normal as their choice following graduat¬ 
ion. By leaving out those students who are going to both 
University and Normal School, v:e might get a more accurate 
picture of the Influence of economic status as measured by the 
n\imber of conveniences found in the homes,

Tlie average number of conveniences found in the homes 
of those students going to University is 5.0, while the average 
number of conveniences found in the homes of students going to 
Normal is 3.6. These figures have reference only to those 
students included in Table XXIII. 

That is, on the average, students going to University 
come from better homes, as far as household equipment is con¬ 
cerned, than do the students going to Normal. 

Figure 13 gives a more definite picture of the relation¬ 
ship that exists between standing obtained on Grade IX examinat¬ 
ions, the number of conveniences found in the home and the 
student*s post graduation plans. 

The students who are going to both the University and the 
Normal School have been left out of this tabulation because they 
would naturally come from homes similar to those of students 
who would choose University, but not necessarily similar to the 
homes of those who would choose to attend the Normal School only. 

Table XXIII and Figure 13 show quite convincingly, that 
students who are going to University are usually those who have 
obtained a high standing on the Grade IX Examinations and come 
from homes that have a large number of these ten important con¬ 


veniences*

All of this mlgjit suggest that these better equipped 
homes permit more leisure time and perhaps have more good 
books, as well as radio, etc., which assist in building in 
background that is a definite help to students In the matter 
of obtaining higher scholastic standings* 





CHAPTER VIII 


PROBABILITY OP STUDENTS IN GRADE IX REACHING GRADE XII. 

An Analysis of High School Drop-outs. 

This report Is made up of several Investigations In 
regard to all the students In the Cardston Inspectorate who 
are registered In Grades IX, X, XI and XII. The total enrol¬ 
ment, 809, Is made up as follows: 


Grade IX-265 

Grade X -207 

Grade XI-195 

Grade XII- 142 


In an earlier chapter It was noticed that the enrolments 
In Grades I to IX are very much the same* This suggests that 
most of the pupils that enter Grade I continue at school until 
they reach Grade IX* After reaching Grade IX, there are evid¬ 
ently many students who drop out, some each year* For example, 
enrolments of 265 In Grade IX and 142 in Grade XII, Indicate 
the truth of such a statement* 

By examining the data, we might discover some reasons 
why the Grade XII enrolment is so much smaller than the enrol¬ 
ments of Grades IX, X and XI. 

The follov;ing questions could be Investigated with the 
Infoimiatlon at hand: 

1* Are the drop-outs distributed proportionately among

vocational groups of parents or do they come from certain 
groups in greater proportions? 

2, Is the economic status of the parents of Grade XII 
students better on the average than the economic status of the 
parents of Grades IX or X students? 

Let us consider these questions in turn. The following 
table lists the enrolments of Grades IX and XII for the eight 
vocational groups.

can be made: 

(a) The Grade IX enrolment of students from these eight 
vocational groups Is 252 and that of Grade XII Is 138, That Is, 
the Grade XII enrolment Is 45.2^ less than the enrolment of 
Grade IX. 

(b) Assuming that the Grade XII enrolment would be simil¬ 
ar to the enrolment of Grade IX, If there were no drop-outs, 
and all other things being equal, we might conclude that the 
differences in enrolments, as shov/n in Table XXIV, suggest the 
sources of the greatest number of drop-outs. Therefore, we con¬ 
clude that the probability of having students drop out from the 
first two vocational groups is very small, while there would be 
a considerable number di^ out from the other vocational groups. 

An estimate of the probability of a student in Grade IX 
reaching Grade XII can be arrived at by calculating, for each 
vocational group, the percentage difference of enrolmentssfor 
the two grades. We might consider Grade IX's enrolment to be 
100 per cent and then find what percentage of this Grade XII*s 
enrolment would be, each vocational group being considered sep¬ 
arately. The result of such calculations is shown in Table 
XXV. 


For the Business and Professional Groups we conclude 
that there is 100 per cent probability that a student in Grade 
IX will reach Grade XII. For the Commercial and Clerical group

the probability is 28.6 per cent, for the Agricultural Group 
56.1 per cent and so on for the rest of the groups. A graph¬ 
ical representation of these percentages is given in Figure 14. 

From what has been said and, more especially from a study 
of Figure 14, we can estimate the probability of percentage 
drop-out from each vocational group. In fact, the probability 
of drop-out will be the converse of the continuation percentage. 
For example, we have stated that there is a 56.1 per cent prob¬ 
ability that a Grade IX student from the Agricultural Group will 
reach Grade XII. Conversely, we can say that the drop-out prob-

ablllty will be 43.9 per cent for this group. The probability 
of* a Grade IX student, whose parent is a common laborer, reach¬ 
ing Grade XII is 25 per cent. The drop-out probability from 
this group is 75 per cent. 

The observations made are sufficient to show that high 
school drop-outs come from certain groups and in different pro¬ 
portions. This being the case we again conclude that secondary 
education is selective. 

To answer the second question, we might refer back to 
Part 1, Chapter VI, where the economic status of parents was 
measured by ownership of Business an Home. 

For Grade IX, 159 students have parents who own both 
Business and Home and 36 students have parents who own neither 
Business nor Home. In Grade XII, 93 students have parents who 
own both Business and Home while only 18 students have parents 
who own neither Business nor Home. For complete ownership there 
is a drop of 41.5 per cent in enrolment and for no ownership a 
drop of 50 per cent. 

This is not a large drop but, assuming that the general 
nature of the enrolments in this area does not change greatly 
from year to year, we conclude that drop-outs between Grades 
IX and XII are influenced to a certain degree by parents* econ¬ 
omic status as measured by ownership of Business and Home - 

the greater percentage drop-out belonging to the non-ownership 
group of parents.

CHAPTER IX 


SmaiARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
Summary of Report 

The following observations may be made from this invest¬ 
igation: 

1* Enrolments in all school grades remain about the same, 
until the end of Grade IX. 

2. The yearly drop-out in the three Hi^ School Grades 
averages about 15 per cent of the preceding grade’s 
enrolment. 

3. The greater portion of all students (about 63 per cent) 
in Grades IX, X, XI and XII in the Cardston Inspector¬ 
ate have parents or guardians that belong to the 
Agricultural Service Vocational Group. 

4. The vocational group that has the greatest percentage 
of its students elect to attend University is the 
Professional Service Group. 

5. Normal School training is about 40 per cent less popul¬ 
ar than University training for the students in this 
area. 

6. Most of the students who select Normal School training 
come from the Agricultural Group. However, this report 
shows the Common Labor Group to have the greatest per¬ 
centage of its students elect this type of training. 
Only a slight difference exists, however, over certain 
other groups.

7« The higher the economic status of parents, the greater 
is the tendency for students to plan on education above 
the secondary level. 

8. The higher the standing obtained on the Grade IX final 
examinations, the greater is the tendency for students 
to select University or Normal School training. 

9. The higher the standing obtained on the Grade IX final 
examinations, the greater is the number of conveniences 
found in the home. 

10. Also, the higher the standing obtained on the Grade IX 
examinations and, consequently, the greater the number 
of modern conveniences in the home, the greater is the 
tendency for students to elect University training 
rather than Normal School training. 

11. The drop-outs from Grade IX or X to Grade XII, are not 
distributed equally among all vocational groups -- the 
greater percentage belonging to groups such as Agricul¬ 
tural and Common Labor. 

12. The number of drop-outs in the Higii School grades is 
evidently influenced, to a certain extent, by economic 
status of parents. It is found that, on the average, 
the economic status of parents of Grade XII students 

is slightly better than the economic status of the 
parents of Grade IX students.

Concluslon. 

Prom the observations made In the Summary, we conclude 
that the character of secondary education in this Province is 
Selective , That is, evidently there is not equal opportunity 
in education. The Vocations and Economic Status of students^ 
parents or guardians have considerable influence in selecting 
who are to attend our High Schools, Universities and Normal 


Schools
