Chapter One 


INTRODUCTION 

The rural church and the community which 
surrounds it and composes it are my life and home. I 
say this by way of Indicuting my viewpoint for I know 
that the influence of ray home comiaunity and early life 
upon my development and thinking has been cTeat. To what 
extent it has clarified, to what extent it has limited 
my understanding, I do not know. I say this also by way 
of recognition of tne one rural church l have Known and 
lived in. 


iunongst my earliest memories I cherish the 
recollection of clambering into the deinocrat with my 
parents, brothers and sisters, to drive three and a half 
miles to church which then was held in a room over the 
one store our hamlet boasted. There were, as I remember 
it, my parents and the two youngest in the front seat, 
four or five of assorted ages in the back seat, and tv/o 
boys hanging their legs over the tailboard. That trip 
was made regularly, winter or suiamer, fair weather or not 
so fair (within reasonable li its). The church had been 
long established in the commu-ity before X Knew it, and 
family attendance had long been takea for granted. My 
earliest { and to some extent, my latest) impressions of

it were of beinr: dressed up and mf'etinfa: In a special way 
many of our nelr.hbors. The late Dean E. A. Rowes has 
given a good description of the country family church* 

"The women gather about the front of the church, on the 
platform or on the ^c,rass, exchangin,^ kindly Inquiries as 
to healths, and indulging in a little harmless gossip; 
their children neanwhile standing stiffly in unfamiliar 
iiunday garb, overwhelmed with a ^^reat self-consciousness 
and a wish that somebody would make a laove.” ^Vxuch of his 
description of the service itself also sounds familiar* 

"The sermon is long, but we are sup osed to concentrate; 
someone will be sure to ask us later about it; or at least 
inquire the text* Sometimes the subject is interesting to 
one part of the congregation, sometimes to another* We 
note that three of the fathers have mastered the knack of 
napping occasionally, unless interrupted by some of the 
family* 

In the main the exhortation aims to reach the 
people ’where they live’, but the purpose is sometimes 

obscured by theological lore . We join in singing 

the closing hymn, which always seems to touch us more than 
the other two; and we bow for the benediction* I^o matter 
how critical we have been during the service, no matter 
how inattentive, we are ail affected by the prayer for the 
Father’s blessing upon us and upon those we love* We leave

the old church more reverently than we entered it; our 
leave-taking with neighbours is subdued, and the influence 
of the service rests, remains, and abides with us as we 
take our way homeward.”(1) 

I can see now as I could not then that the real 
community of people, in contrast to those who are simply 
living near one another, was born in and nourished by that 
common church experience. The strong women’s organization 
that grew there was one indication, the picnics we had 
were happy results, wot only did we have Sunday School 
picnics, but for many years the custom was established of 
taking the family supper to the afternoon service and 
repairing after the service to the community picnic 
^rounds b;^ the river for oi swim, cl friendly buxl in 

which men and women and children alike were Involved - the 
minister was pitcher, and a minister who was a frequent 
visitor delighted to play first base in opposition to my 
father, thougii both men had learned the game after most men 
have ceased to play. Then the mothers would announce that 
all due preparations had been made and we would sit down 
with our closest pals to the richest variety of country 
food ever assembled by the co-operative efforts of many 
good cookse

L3ometlme later Roman Catholic f and lies and non- 
ohurch people availed themselves of the whole afternoon for 
similar pursuits but there was a difference. They had 
better ball games but less fun and somehow did not produce 
the same results for any but the few who could play well. 

It was not a function of the community I think. 

I know now that that rural church came to life 
in me, it got into my blood though I did not recognize it 
until I had studied in the udiversity for a year. Then I 
decided to enter the ministry - though not as one decides 
o'f* two business « be sball “n-roceed wi tb^ f*or T 

had seen the church and was called to serve it. Later in 
my training I knew also that it must be the rural church, 
inti thus arises this thesis, written as it is from a 
particular point of view which I have thought it best to 
Indicate. 

Through the activities of my father and a host 

of others who comprise and direct rural organizations, 

through my four summers’ work on rural mission fields, and 

through talking* and reading and observing, I have entered 

into the life of rural Alberta. I have seen the problems 

and difficulties of our far- neighbors magnified and 

liultiplied in the rural population of Alberta. »ye were 

Qot alone in our problems of indebtedness, 
health

struggle with the unruly elements in oo-operatlon with 
which — or in spite of which — we made our living, I 
have seen that we were more fortunate than most in 
maintainin a standard of ooinmuriity and f^oo6 country life, 
..e have a two-room school, a community church, and a new 
community hall -- each one a source of, and a result of 
community pride and welfare, I have seen strong, healthy 
young men and women leave our community for the professions 
of teaching, nursing and preaching. Some have gone into 
business, some have prepared for and accepted the life of 
a modern farmer which is now a higiily developed business, 

I have seen many others who left school as soon as possible 
to work on farms — with their fathers, their neighbors, 
and tn a few instances, to establish their own homes. 


I have seen too, with alarm, how few farmers’ 
sons have been able to take up positions in the community 
which show proiLise of permanence and strength. The 
burden of debt on almost every acre of land, the amount 
of capital equipment necessary for the successful 
operation of a farm, the isolated and stren^ious life of 
the farmer, and the uncertainty of adequate returns for 
his labor all combine to make a forblddin/?: picture. It 
is inevitable that other opportunities are sought. The 
advent of war not only offered alternative activity to 
those who were, unsettled, but presented a challenge to

the patriot sm of rural youth as well as adventure and 
travel long denied. Recruiting; officers have stated that 
e ilistment from rural areas proportionately far exceeds 
that of urban centres. A survey of any rural area In 
-Alberta (and the same is true elsewhere) will reveal how 
completely rural young manhood and womanhood have responded 
to the call of ar:uy, airforce, navy, munition plants, 
aircraft repair, and industry. The results as already 
observable in rural organizations and institutions and as 
predictable Ir records of production, standards of health 
and 1‘vlng are Imcinently threatening, lural communities 
in w.rens ^re disliitee:;i:nting Ui.der of present 

day conditions. 

ivleanwhile I am a member of a Ciiristian church 
and am now a uinister in it. I have become absorbed In 
history of Christian thought and institutions, and have 
felt the strength and redemptive power and the joy of 
fellowship with God and man. I believe in the church as 
the chief agency of that fellowship, the visible forra of 
it, the organizational unity of Christians who seek ever 
to share it, to extend it, to deepen it. The gospel of 
Jesus has been understood by some to mean the salvation of 
individual souls. »vhlle religious experience must 
primarily be personal, it must issue in social experience 
and expression if it will be true to itself. A Kew

England writer in 1911 stated, 

"The evident weakness of present day :rotestant 
sentiment Is its individualism. Solitary living, 
has criven us solitary religion •••• Our evangelism 
has been content to tell salvation to the Individual 
soul and lay no bondage upon that soul for service 
to the community •••. Individual souls have been 
overdosed with a gospel of their personal 
importance." (1) 


In a later chapter consideration will bo given 
more fully to the message and mission of the church. 
Suffice it to say here that 1 consider the preaching of 
the salvation of the individual soul an inadequate 
expression of the Christian religion and incapable of 
satisfying the religious needs of a conteTiporary Christian 
or of a Christian society. The United Church of Canada 
has given its attention and energies to the salvation of 
men in their communities since ail men are created 
equal and subject to a coimaon jJod and Father, no one of 
them can be exempted from the demands and duties thus 
inc jmbent upon him. His salvation must be in terms of his 
relationships to God and man. "V/e believe that the Church 
the society of the redeemed, was brought into existence 
by God himself through the work and risen newer of Christ, 
rtho in calling men into fellowship with Himself, calls 
them by the seune act into fellowship with one another In 
Him." (the emphasis is mine) (2)

The gospel we proclaim Is thus applicable to the 
life of man in hlo environment and is the source of his 
fellowship with others. To achieve Its purpose, the church 
(lUst know the environment in which Its members live, must 
^eco-rnlze all the forces that work against the salvation 
iind fellowship of its members, must recognize and nourish 
everything that enhances and enriches the quality of life. 
The Church uust bring the transforming:; power of God into 
she situations in which men live, into their objective as 
^^ell as into their subjective lives. The Christian church 
las lonr acknov/led^ed this derfiand and has been foreiiiost 
.n healing, teaching, labor legislation and working 
conditions of nen, in clearance of slums and in opposition 
CO anti-social tendencies. 

iiuch a conception of the church requires fresh 
emphasis, however, when its v/ork in rural Alberta Is 
considered. One is forced to ask to what extent the 
Christian church at work has known the real environment of 
Its members. Has it recognized the forces that are 
Irectly opposed to the development of the fellowship it 
envisages? Has it, as a body, concerned itself with the 
problems of a farmer’s life? No one person can presume 
to speak for the ’church in Alberta’, nor for any one 
ienomination of it. lowever, from my reading of Conference 
^nd Jyiiod minutes, ana from my experience in it as member

and mlnl.st.a’T', and rr^m my a^nta<^ts mral orj^nlzstlons, 

I feel justified in nttyin^j that the Alberta Conference of 
the United Church of Canude, and at least many of the 
iTesbyterles which compose it, do not reflect or display 
an awareness of or fundamental concern for rural conditions 
except in so far as they affect the organized church, 
(Questions which might be classed under the term ’rural 
sociology^ are singularly scarce in church discussions. 

As an instance of the degree to v/hlch this is 
true may I cite an occasion in a southern Alberta ''resbytery 
meeting. All but one of the ministers, and all but two 
of the lay members were from the country or from some 
towns immediately dependent upon farms. One of the most 
distressing problems facing farmers at tne time was the 
price tnat the Federal government was about to set for 
wheat. At the time great efforts were being made to 
rouse and jcrive exnression to nublic oninion. The outcome 
affected the livelihood and welfare of every home in that 
area though not all v/ere aware of it. One of the farmer 
members sat without comment through raost of the afternoon 
but towards the end of the session he arose. He apologized 
first for introducing a subject that was outside the 
interests of the organized assembly. He then stated In 
a few very clear words the significance to that area of 
the demand the farmers were mskinv for a reasonable price

He then thanked the chairman for the time granted him, 
and the Presbytery, with a brief word of approval from the 
chairman and not a word of discussion, continued with its 
own business. 

Of course they had and always will have many 
problems of church polity to discuss; the a.^^enda proialsed 
to occupy all the available time, but surely a proposition 
which directly affected the daily bread, and therefore 
the prayers, of aluiost all its moiabers bad a legitimate 
place on any Presbytery a^/eiida! If one could dismiss the 
incident as merely an incident no one would be greatly 
concerned, but it is a commentary upon ecclesiastical 
consciousness throu^^hout Alberta. As soon as I have 
written that sentence X realize, of course, that izi many 
rural communities the minister is as Keenly aware as any 
man could be of the conditions in his pastorate, and is 
doing all wit hill his power to help the farmers meet their 
problems. But, I repeat, that awareness and concern vras 
given little place in his preparation for the ministry and 
is not apparent when he meets with his fellow churchmen 
to review their work and outline their activities. In an 
article in The U. ited Church Observer, T. L. Tucker 
states,

That statement seems to me to be tine of the

Dmdition. It is exemplified in the attitude of man who 
accept a rural .ministry as inevitable until they can ^.ain 
’’promotion" to a city church. It appears again in the 
iridely accepted sentiment which ranks ministers in direct 
proportion to the porulatlon of the town or city in which 
bhey serve. It is involved, though not solely responsiblo 
for the disparity between rural and urban wsalaries. It is

body gives to rural life developments and possible aids

jxperlmenting with couiiiiuiiity credit unions, co-operative 
farms, adult eauoatlou programs, vsorkineS with faimers on 
the staggeriu^^ problem of uebt und rehabilitation? 3uch 
projects would, I think, not be considered outside the 
range of the work of the church — or at least of chuich 
people -- for they are community rather tlian priiaailly 
political riroblens. Tho nufr^er '-rutt surely llo In the 
fact that the oliuroh nas not been conscious of the area 
in which much of its work is done, is not fa^’^lliar with 
the specific problems which arise therein and hence has 
given no direct attention to the solving of thein nor 
provided her ministers with the necessary trraining to 
intelligently apply themselves to them when they do meet 
the:":. Vie have not developed and trained a rural ministry 
and we must do so or become inconsequential# 

It is perhaps worth glancing briefly at the 
iini.^rtance of our rural work, not as it related to the 
welfare of the church but to the life of the nation in 
its broadest extension as well as in its many areas taken 
by themselves, it has been often said, but I think seldoip. 
reelized, that the farms are the basis and foundation of 
the national economy and of the nation’s cultural welfare; 
that 1'* the CDuntr3'' suffers, everrone in the nation feels 
it. !<^i£s ^velyn Dewey speaks thus of the Country wife 
kovement t-S she knew it in the "i.itecl States Wo decades ago

*’Clty dwellers, realizing that a country can 
be only as stronfj as Its agriculture, have 

sought to help.Farmers feed the nation; 

if they fail, we must either make a costly 
readjustment so that we cun get food from 
other countries, or we must fail with the 
farmers .... Agriculture is the fundamental 
industry of a nation on which all other 
industries rest."(l) 

Farmers do not o:.ly supply the nation’s food. They raise 
the families also. The ’drift to the cities’ has been a 
long term tendency for rural areas have consistently 
r ared larger families than have urban centres. Rural 
conditions with an abundance of room at least outside, and 
work, and usually of food, naturally are more suited to the 

those in 

large family than are/\the .;-ore crowded, adult-world of the 

cities and towns. The drift to the cities has many 

currents, some of them inevitable, and it must be recognized 

and duly planned for. In.the opinion of some writers, 

"If the democratic nations are to live, the 
cities cannot continue to drain people from 
the farms and villages ’.d.thout giving full 
measure in return."(8) 


In more local and immediate terms the rural areas 
demand our attention for food production, universally 
recognized as a ^;.ost otent war weapon^is ^ost seriously

presence of a huge wheat surplus does not warrant too 
much optimism with regard to the possibility of a 
continuous s pply of the variety of food a nation demands 
at any time. Every rural ar a that I know can anticipate 
reduced production of essential foodstuffs unless some 
improvement is made over preseni. conditions. A part of that 
improvement must be in terms of community situations for 
the second source or ur^^ency lies in the dangers of rural 
wa time conditions to living conditions, standards of 
health, of education, and of welfare generally. It is 
simply impossible for the present farming population to 
carry the burden they are now shouldering without 
seriously impairing their lives. »<hat does it mean, not 
only to them but to the whole of society eventually, that 
men of sixty-five years ana their wives of sixty years 
are undertaking the operation of entire farms? Those two 
are responsible for their own living, for the care of 
their stock, for long hours in the fields both in spring¬ 
time and In h^irvest, in addition to all the worry towns’ 
people have ^or their sons, their homes, their possible 
future -Oi-u tho welfare ox oheir own community as well as

Immediately, is that of plannlnf.; and working now for the 
future rural population. We may seem to be borrowing 
troui'le by look’n^ into the next five or ten years but it 
is a mark of wisdom and a needed caution to do so now. One 
of the most distressing problems acoomnanying warfare is 
the rehabilitation of all who have been unsettled by it. 

In our situation alniost everyone ’s included, already 
thousands of men have been discharged from the Canadian 
army and their numbers will increase with the years. It is 
not too _uch to hope that within reach of our planning 

C vouictS 

great of them will be no lon.:;er required for combat 

duties. The experience of other wars and their aftermaths 
w uld indicate that many of them will be put on the land. 

It would also indicate that successful rehabilitation will 
be more difficult to ac^ieve because of the numbers in¬ 
volved, the changed nature of farming, the complexities of 
our economy, and in addition^the increased awar^^ness on the 
part of the men themselves of the unattractive, unpromising 
prospect of farming us they have known it and as they can 
foresee it in nostwar years. Unless a great deal of 
stabilization and permanence has been provided in rural 
areas in anticipation of their return as well as in answer 
to the needs of the present, we shall know greater hardship 
than we have known to date. 

In such a setting the r-rai church must proclaim 
the gospel of its Lord — are we able?

Chapter Two 


THS PROCESS OP SKTTLEiidENT 


’^The process of settlenient consists not alone in the 
ipir^ation of peo-nle to new physical environments and 
the development, by invention and borrowing, of ways 
of uxploltin^/ virgin ire sour cos. It includes also 
the cstablistoont of social Institutions and the 
evolution of ways of social living. Tlie pioneers, 
men and esnooi.nlly women, v;ho came to the Canadian 
prairies, brought with thoio., not only physical 
strength, some knowledge and some capital, but also 
fa'^lliaritjT vrith Institutions in other places, social 
attitudes and habits, bits of civilization from a 
great variety ox unu counti’ies. In the 

arduous struggle of the frontier, nev? ways of life 
wer^^^ forged. Institutions borrowed from older 

communities, and, in sof’^e cases, new ones were 
invented to meet the new needs. In the process of 
tine, the population of a frontier region responds 
to the difficulties It encounters, and evolves a 
character of Its own end with It appropriate social 
institutions.”(1) 


This thesis is a study of one of tl'te social 
Institutions v;hich have thus been brought to 41berta and 
leveloped in response to ttie needs of the settlers. The 
3hurch is faced with some •^ecullarl3’ difficult problems 
In an area of settlement such as Alberta because every 
^roup of peoble brings a meoiory or fore:' of the church it 
>8s known. The wide varl-ety and diversity of backgrounds

and others have not been dealt with. I h* ve nicked out 
indications and illustrations from a complex nlcture to 
develop the thesis rather than attempting to give a full 
study. 

2) Consideration is given in the main only to 
the kethodist and J-resbyterian churches for the years 
preceding their union in 1925, and to the United Church of 
Canada since its inception. This does not discount the 
work or significance of other churches or imply that they 
can be dismissed thus easily. I am primarily interested 
in the work of the church in which I have influence. In 
addition, the statistics of these churches were more 
readily available than were those of other denominations. 

erhaps the churches so studied may be taken as the 
clearest example of the adaptation of an institution to its 
environment and at the same t^me as approximately 
representative of those most like it. The chief defect in 
such a treatment lies in falling to reveal the distinctive 
work of some other bodies, and the important inter¬ 
relationships amongst all churches. 

3) No check has been discovered as to the accuracy 
of the church statistics. They are gathered by men who are 
untrained and not always accurate in such vvork and hence 
may be subject to a relatively high percentage of error.

In addition there Is the well-known reluctance to rernove 
Danes from the membership roll and the ea^mess to add 
names to it. ihe correction of this tendency is well 
illustrated in thv records of the con‘relation at Olds. 

.^hlle the Total number under Pastoral Oversight was 
annually reported as being bOO from 1929 to 1936, the 
membership of the church had increased from 190 in 1928 to 
214 in 1931, then it suddenly dropped in one year to 173, 
and increased very slowly for the next seven years. 

4) Finally, there is the difficulty of comparing 
oiiuroa recoras oefore and after the Union of the churches. 
Different terms of reference v/ere used, the boundaries of 
the units of organization did not always correspond, and the 
division of the cresbyterian Church further complicates the 
comparison. 

Having made due allowance for the above liiaitations 
let us proceed to a survey of the settlement of Alberta. 

The outline provided by Dr. C. A. Dawson and £iss Younge 
in their study, Pioneering in the prairie Provinces: The 
Social Side of the Settlement Process, is clear and of 
value in tracing the settlement of one of the Prairie 
Provinces. The principles set forth in their second 
chapter, The Settlement Cycle in the Prairie Regj.on, are 
here used almost in summary with such additions and 
alterations as seemed necessary for this study.

A. The Era of Subsidiary Af^riculture. 

The initial thrust of ’^o’^ulatlon — apart from the 
casual and slilftinp: elements in the trading outposts — 
was along the iiost accessible and fertile river valleys. 
River transportation was too slow and inadequate for 
agricultural produce if it could have been developed. 

Hence there were small farming settlements surrounding 
trading posts with all the produce being consumed locally, 
the communities being characterized by a diversity of 
activities and almost complete self-sufficiency except for 
tools and some clothing. 

B. The Era of /^.gricultural Dominance. 

with the construction of railroads, relatively 
cheap transportation became ossible. The completion of 
the Transcontinental railway in 1885 opened up quite new 
prospects for the new provisional district. Settlers could 
come in easily and their goods could be sblrped out 
regularly, land companies were given land grants with the 
proviso that they bring in stipulated numbers of settlers. 
The coming of the first truns-continental railway did not, 
however, have iaimediate results in settlement. Some 
advance spade work was done in preparation for the mass 
movement during the years which immediately preceded 1900 
and the decade and a half which followed that date.

Frevious to the advent of the railway, rioulture was 
carried on about the trading posts and on small clearings 
along the river beds. The farmer gained his livin/: from his 
own farm, the produce he could sell to the in-coming 
settlers, and the work he could get on the construction of 
railroads, roads, and telephone lines. Community life was 
at a minimum since settlements were isolated and the men 
were away from home for long periods at a time. It was a 
tLiiS of uiui clearing ana preparing- for a new day 

about to dawn. 

A different type of settlement prevailed In the 
southern r>art of Alberta where circumstances lent themselves 
more readily to ranching. Ranching established a larger 
household unit but life was lived under conditions of 
frontier isolation marked by its own self-sufficiency. The 
commercial nossibillties of ranching had been established 
in the United States in sijallar areas and it is not 
surprising that the same type of settlement spread northward 
into Canada. In addition, through investment and other ways 
there was a connection with British upper and middle-class 
society. The ranching enterprise was gradually pushed back 
towards the foothills and into smaller areas by the small 
farraer with his more intensive use of land and more 
localized settlement.

Whenever a shipping point could be established 
Kvithln 20 miles of his farm, the farmer could begin his 
expansion program which so typified the whole of central and 
southern Alberta after the turn of the century, ’^ith the 
farmer came the community and permanent social structure 
Including schools, stores, churches and social customs 
hitherto impossille. iils local commu^iity finds its place 
In a network of interdependent communities, the largest of 
nfhich Is a central city. From the latter, by way of a 
series of smaller cities, towns,and villages,comes knowledge 
3 f the affairs of the larger world. For at this stage of 
development the farm and the farmer’s local community are 
interdependent parts of a far-reaching whole. 

There are in addition the communities settled 
about.mining and logging industries which are of consider¬ 
able im.portanoe in the settlement of i^lberta as well as in 
the concerns of the church, but these have a story of their 
own and will not be discussed in this thesis. 

While the general cycle of agricultural settlement 
is as outlined above, many factors operate to produce 

regional differences as a study of a mnp of settlement in 
alberta at any period of its history will show. The 

chief differences are those of soil, climatic conditions, 

and transportation. It is to be noted, of course, that

these are inter-related and the zones thus differentiated 

display great vuriatlons within themselves. The three main 

regions are classified as follows: 

a) The prairies of southern and eaatern Alberta were, 

before settlement, open rolling grassianas on what is known 

as a brown type of soil. It is fertile and the growing 

season comparatively long but the rainfall is variable and 

on the average slight. 

^ recipitation in the region varies, on the 
average, from a high of 20 inches to a low 
of 8 inches •••• The Northern Plains region 
is best described as semi-arid and 
unpredictuoly variaole.** (1) 

Ranching was the first and best suited agricultural pursuit 
over most of the area, especially previous to the develop¬ 
ment of railway lines. Once shipping points were numerous 
and markets open for wheat, fanning rapidly displaced 
ranching in all but the western boundaries of the region. 

The food demands of the first Great War and the attractive 
prices for the high quality grain which could be -TOwn so 
easily there completed the expansion of grain farming, 
unfortunately, no thour-ht was given to the future of the 
country by farmers or authorities and the disastrous results

are only too well known today. A type of a^’:riculture and 
settlement had been adopted which the land would not 
support. The result was untold heartbreak and loss 
occasioned by the widespread and necessary abandonment of 
farms and homes. A recent survey reveals the following 
conditions; 

’’The records show 4,421 occupied farmsteads in an 
area of 51,093 parcels. This represents on the 
average, close to one foiLily to every 12 parcels, 
or three square miles ... Three thousand, one 
hundred and sixty buildings, or 42% of ail 
buildings found in the area were unoccupied ... 

In Class 1 parcels (the least productive class) 

63% of the broken land is recorded as idle. At the 
other extreme, more than 99% of the broken land 
in Class IV (the most productive class) has been 
recently cultivated.” (1) 

The following digest of census returns indicates the 
trend of settlement in this area better than does 
description. The four census divisions numbered 1, 3, 5, 


and 7 

roughly 

cover the 

area under 

consideration numbering 

from 

south to 

north.

Two trends of aettlement are apparent In these 
fi,<rures: 1) population in each of the divisions increased 
rapidly for the first twenty years of this century* This 
period includes early pioneering and ranching in the first 
jrears and then the rapid displuceraent of ranchers by 
farmers in the ’wheat boom’ of war and imiiiediate post-war 

jrears* Then caije the slump from which the three southern 

divisions never recovered completely. 2) the southern parts 
[>f the region were settled first but did not attract 
settlers at as high a rate as the northern areas, nor did 
they prove as stable. Of coursf; the western and northern 

fringes of the region border the more productive class¬ 
ification of* land whiob the second the main 

regions of alberta. 

B) The parhlands of Alberta form a crescent border about 
the prairies as Indicated above. It is estimated that one 
half of the total ac‘9q;jage is suitable for cultivation, one 
quarter is marginal, and one quarter is not suitable for 
cultivation. (1) 

"This area suffers less from erosion than the 
Great. Plains, is dotted by small patches of 
woodland, called ’bluffs’, has a rolling 
topo>rraphy, and is quite suitable for machine 
a? 3 riculture. The soils of the Park Belt are 
black, of high fertility, and receive a much

greater preolpltatlon tiian the Great Ilaine, 
The annual rainfall is from 14 to 20 inches 
and for the five ruonths growing season it 

ranf^es from 9 to 14 inches.livestock is 

important for a variety of reasons. There is 
a relatively ample supply of water for such 
stock. A growing weed menace in some parts 
... the presence of lar er urban markets ... 
the frost hazard west of the Celgary-’Cd lonton 
line and a treater humidity have made for the 
imnortance of farm animals, especially swine. 
Kurthermore, the concentration of Central 
^.uropeaii immi^'rants in the Park Balt has 
resulted in an emphasis on nixed farming.’^(1) 


As might be expected, settlement in this area 
began early and has been consistent and stable, a map of 
rural settlement in 1886 displays the total population to 
be in the Park Belt and the foothills ranching areas in 
the south west except for some 2200 peoples scattered v.lthin 
10 miles of the nev/ transcontinental railway. The main 
settlement surrounded the cities of Calge-mr npA ^fi'^onton 
and the freighting trail between them, and the remainder 
was on the banks of the horth Saskatchewan river. (2) A 
digest of census returns slmlar to that made for the 
prairies shows the same trend. Census Divisions numbered 
6, 8, 11, and 10 were used in that order which includes the 
bulk of the Park Belt progressing from south to north and 
east.

In contrast to the prairie region, the settlement 
here was already significant at the turn of the century* it 
increased steadily in every division, and supports a total 
population almost four times as g»eat although it should 
be noted that the resiono here co^kpared ure ouly veiy 
roughly comparable in area. 


C) "North, northeast, and west of the Park Belt 
lies wooded territory which has been slowly 
settled us opportunities in the areas described 
above have receded. The soil in these wooded 
areas is grey in color, shallower in der>th, and 
much less fertile than that of the Park Belt. 
Relatively heavy clearing eosts add to the 
difficulties of settlement here .... While rain¬ 
fall is mor abundant, the frost hazard is also

much greater •••• V.hoat Is not the dominant crop 
in these outlying wooded areas, except In inter¬ 
spersed patches of parklands, Ooarse grains and 
grasses grown in conjunction with animal husbandry 
are the chief sources of inco lie . In such districts 
the possibilities of livelihood lie mainly in the 
direction of I'dxed far.^iing. ierhaps th.e out¬ 
standing obstacle to settlement in the outlying 
wooded areas is the scattered distribution of 
suitable land, bmall and widely separated areas 
suitable for settlement make transportation 
facilities and institutional services expensive 
or not feasible at all. Thus apart from the 
larrer pseudo-prairies and patches of the better 
wooded soils, population density is very low and 
seems dei?tlned to remain so. The march of settle¬ 
ment into wooded areas under the Irnovm conditions 
of settlement ^nust be slow and uncertain.” (1) 


Census divisions numbered 9, 12, 14, and 13 
have been chosen as representative of this region. There 
are perhaps more approximations Involved in this area than 
in either of the other two similarly treated. Division 
Do. 9 Includes an extensive coal mining area. Division Nos. 
14 and 13 border the North Saskatchewan river and thus 
include a considerable a<r9(page which might better have been 
included in the park Belt. In some degree Division Ko. 12 
more truly represents the grey wooded soil region but the 
four divisions are hero presented even though they are 
somewhat too favorable.

The features to be noted in this table are, as in 
the former study, the relatively early settlement except in 
division ^io* 12, ana the pro(^:ressive increase over the whole 


period. The chief difference lies in the slower increase 
of settlement than in either of the other two areas, and a 
lower total population than the Park Belt, e higher total 
population than the ; rairie. 


There is one other major region of settlement in 
Alberta which differs mainly in location rather than in soil 
type or climate. The -teace River region has been studied 
at some length by .-rofessor 0. a. Dawson and is of 
CO slderable importance ^because it recapitulates the 
history of the grassland settlement .... (and) .. furnishes 
an ideal ’case’ for study.” (2)

The story of the i'eace idver settleaient is an intriguing 
one and is well told by Irofessor Dawson. A soamary of his 
account Is here given as an introduction to the country. 


"The discovery of the Peace River area was Indicental 
to the fur trade of the Canadian Vest ••• Fort Pork, 
founded in 1702 six miles above the confluence of, 
the Smokv and " e neer the site of the 

present town of i^eace River, Dunvegan established 
in 1600, and Fort iit. John in 1006, were lux^yortont 
posts within the ^eace River Country". (1) 

The fresh meat trade became of considerable importance, 

"horses were brought in as early as 1809 •• 
domestic cattle were rlentiful at Dunvor^inn by 1840 
as evidence by the •••• earliest records of butter 
makih^^ in .dberta The need for a i.jore 

varied food supply led naturally to agricultural 

experiments .... (Agriculture, however,) . 

remained a minor industry. It was not to be 
expected that fur traders would promote this 
industry, since its expansion would mean the 
disappearance of the fur business. 

"At Shaftesbury was the first af':ricultural 
settlement of any importance. Anglican and 
Catholic missions wer^ established in the late 
1880’s. They encouraged farming and, towards the 
close of the century, a number of half-breeds and 
a few white people occupied small farms fronting 
the river .... A sample of wheat from iJ.s (Rev. J. 
Gough Brick,ioiglican)< rtook first prize at the ^ 
International Seed Exhibition at Chicago in 1896. 
..... The climate ai a fertility of this new area 
became widely knovm in tiie first decade of the 
twentieth century. The p:rov/th of agricultural 
settlement v/as slow in these early years because 
the distance to market was so great .

^The broken topof:raphy and tho p;re8t variety of 
aoll types ^aake for widely separated settlements, 

•••• climatic conditions also have their effect. 

Hecords show that total precipitation varies from 
9.76 to 22.12 inches per year ... 

”The aovement of a.';ricultural settlers into this 
northern regions w^s dependent upon the increasing 
density and expansion of settlement in th^ j:-authern 
areas of the three iralrie irovinces ... The most 
Important single event in the development of this 
region was tho entry of the railway. The Edmonton, 
Limvegan and British Jolumtia liailway, built by 
private capital, reached Peace rdver town In 1916. 

... The whole frontier was astir. Speculative 
fever nulsed in the veins of those near and far 
away ... Town building was only incidental to the 
wave of land settlement ... The railway had 
tanped the region and war prices were being paid 
for wheat in the world markets. 

”The process of expansion v;as by no means even, for 
there were counterforces which at one moment retarded 
settj.omout ana at another set it more violently in 
motion.”(1) 

ilfithout f^irther detail or description, the purposes of this 
thesis at this stage may be met by setting forth the census 
returns as has been done for the other regions. The settle¬ 
ment corresponds to Division To. 16.

Professor Dawson notes, 

**After the irreat on th=*re came a 

period of recession from 1921 to 1925 This 
setback was caused by fallln^ v;heat ^^rlcea 
lilgn freight rates, by a drop iii caiiie prices 
and after the dry year of 1924 .••• ' he next 
it meant larger holdin s unaer the dlr^^ction of 
more competent fanr; management* 

'’The next “»erlod of vl/^prous expansion bep:an in 
1926, gathered full force in 1927 jnd 1928, and 
finally came to a halt under the full wei-ht of 
d^resaed market conditi ina in 19 31.” (1) 

It ntl^'ht move of some value to compare the settlements 

of the four regions thus described and to see their 

relationship to the settlement of the province as a whole. 

The following table indicates the increase in p pulation 

for each census year in each of the four regions surveyed 

above. Xhe figures are derived from the totals given in 

the above tables, total for the province anc are from the 

Mberta census, 1936.

Thus do 

the tides 

of settlement 

run. 



Too often such statistical tables are treated 
simply as intereatln/^ statistics, the reason for compiling 
them foPi^otten. tor this thesis they reveal the swirling 
currents of population with v/hom the United Church of 
Canada is concerned. They show that in 1911 there were 
189100 new people mostly in the central, southern and 
eastern parts of the province. Could the church minister 
to them? Did it have sufficient men who had sufficient 


training to mciet the needs of so many stianc*ors7 And 
could it give attention to tne awakening co^imiunity in the 
"eace ivlver country? These figures also show that between

1921 and 1926 almost 26000 people had been unsettled in the 
few and llrclted areas here studied* J ov^ nit»ny broken homes 
do them represent*!^ nd where did they ^^o when they left 
the prairie and fewoe River reo'lons? ^Vas the church able to 
meet them at their new deatlnatlon? Could It understand 
wh> tiio ulaaater naa come upon them? //as It able to learn 
that It ml^ht help others to adjust mors per’^aanently to 
their olrourastances and so prevent the re-occurrence? And 
if that many left their homes, how meny more were in equally 
desperate conditions but atayod because they saw no better 
alternative? 

Only by collecting the experiences of hundreds 
of ministers who lived with their people throughout the 
period could those questions be answered properly, oome 
indications of the answers can be ontuined by conducting 
n survey of the churches, in so fur as that is possible, 
over approximately the sajiie areas and the same tiiiie* To 
that task attention is now directed but confined to a study 
of the Methodist and Presbyterian churches until 1925 and 
of the United Church of Canada, Alberta conference, 
following that vdate. The study will consist of a broad 
st^tlstioc?.*. survey or tno church, a more intensive invest¬ 
igation o. the work of the church in representative areas, 

and thence to broader Questions of chur 'h policy to be 
further defined later. 









Chapter Three 

TflE DEVKL'jJMSNT OK The: ChURCH 

”Xh 0 Country ohurcl ia the weather vane oi* 
oomniunlty pro^Nfierity. It ib a voluntary 
Institution, divinely given as an in cx of how 
well the fanner is getting on.” (1) 

One roi*?ht exnect, then, that the expansion of the 
church would follow closely the expansion of settlerient 
itself. A study of church records proves this to be true. 
In the last chapter it was notol that the earliest and 
heaviest settlements v/ere in the ranching areas of the 
south, along the Park Belt, tana on the banks of the main 
rivers. Upon the entry of the railroad, with increased 
demands for wheat, and the consenuent profit in wheat 
farming on the prairies, new communities were formed very 
ouickly. In rostv/ar years the economic structure of the 
prairie settlements proved unsound and thousands of homes 
were abandoned. In the meantlroo the completion of the 
e.D. Sr B.C. liailway as far as teace River in 1916 provided 
the outlet for a rapidly growing new area of hacitution.

it is in^res^lii;^ to note tLat t^s peak iu number 
of ministers was reached as early us l^Vsi in the i'ark Beit 
and its western fringe, ijollowin^; that ante the numbers 
declined steadily except in the year ld<J0 and again in the 
years 1928 to 1930 where it temporarily increased end then 
down again. In the other regions the v/aves of settlement 
are fairly clearly marked. On the rairies the numbers 
Increased reiTiularly until 1920 when numbers of ministers 
like total po^ul^itio^ until tne later 1920 

reached a peak in 1930 and then steadily declined as has 
the total population. 

The Methodist and Iresbyterian churches began to 
to be aware of the new northern settlement (which strangely 
is airriost the oldest as we have seen above). Numbers of 
Eiiinisters foliov/s an uncertain level until 1920 when 
increasing settlement is reflected in an increased number 
of ministers. The population slump of 1926 is followed by 
a decrease in the number of mihisters in i926 ^nd 1928. 

The peak is reached in 1930 to 1936 foliOAing which the 
decline is ai-ost steady. The provincial total reveals an

In the latter part of tho decade to reach a oeuk in 1930 
which is followed by a oonaistent and alaraln^ decliae --

It has already been noticed In Table F that the 
total population for the p3X)vince and for each of the areas 
excent the rairies has increased and Is still doinr so 
though not so rapidly. Does tiiat mean that the United. 
Church is being suporseded by some other denomination*? or 
that all churches are losing; ground? or that fewer ministers 
are responsible for larger units of- populativjn? 

The first of those questions is answered by the 
following statistics;

show a decline In total meintersblp, all of the Irotestant 
denominations except the TTnlted Churcn have declined In 
pe’'C 0 ntap:e of the total poTDulatlon. The Roman Oathollo 
Church displays the most significant advance la membership 
the Greek Orthodox Church probably reflects the increasing 
percentage of European peoples in the province. Certainly 
amongst Protestant denomlnatl ns, however, the United 
Church is not being superseded but is rather taking 
precedence. It would seem then that the third query 
receives an affirmative ansv:er -- fewer ministers are 
directly rosponsible for larger units of population. 

Evidence that this is the case may be derived 
from the Year hooks of the Oiited Church, alberta Conference.

Two significant fe.cts are to be notsd in Table I. 

In the first place, the church in 1941 listed 124,896 people 
as being directly under pastoral oversight, But there were 
193,664 peorle gave the census takers to understand that 
they were "nlted Church members or adherents. That is, 
there are 68,768 men, women and children in Alberta alone 
who should he on the United Church rolls. Of course, many 
are not interested at ail but felt that they ha-, to name 
soune churoh* Others are livin^ out of tiie wu.y places 
and have never made any contact v/ith a minister, and some 
may be accounted for on different rounds. It does mena^.

however, that the United Uburch.I j reoronslble for thorn 
which increuseo the unit of people pur minister which la 
the second point of ’nterez’^ in .'chi? I, 

Ith few very minor oxceptiona the ratio of 
po''.ulation per minister has inuraaseci ateadily. On the 
basis of the census rtjport, the ratio expressed in terms of 
Table J would be in 1S41, 8.24 hundreds of people per miniate 
That raises some very serious q^uestioLLS for the church as 
to future policy, how far can that tendency go without 
seriously impairing the worK of the church? flas the 
standard of the v/orJc already been lowered? Personal 
experience would indicate that, in spite of improved 
methods of transportation and the increased iobility of 
both the minister and his people, suen a tondency means a 
larger proportion of euen mnn*s time bsin^ spent in sheer 

rd otTi 

orf/ani:iationul d lff i culty , marrying and ourying. One 
expects, of course, to fulfill these ministerial duties, 
they have their own importance, but they do not sum up the 
tforlc of the Christian church or of the Christian minister. 

The figures that havi been given have been on a 
total provincial basis and have made no distinctions as to 
area and as to tiPe peicentage of rural and urban communities* 
jne wonders how the church has adjusted to the increased 
responsibility, iiave some areas been abandoned more quickly

This comparison is of vary general nature; it 
does not taka into account the percentage of United Church 

members and adherents in tho total population which varies 
with the different rogions, dependins largely upon the

The problems resulting from a decreased number of ministers

It naturally is from those areas which are less densely

Church partly corrects that tendency hut cuunot wholly

amoiipst cities, towns and villages means that even on the

problem. For example, the addresses as given in the

Chapter lY 


THE CHURCn IN THREE RURAL COmJNITIES 

In keeping with the order followed throughout 
ihls theals, the first rural oomraunlty to be studies la 
.ocatod In tho Prairie area, or as we have known It, 

.udg4-^A‘ characteristics of the Region will be re- 

sallcd from the treatiaent in the former chapter. It is 
'semi-arid and unpredlctably variable* In so far as climate 
ts ooncorned. Settlement was slow until the railways were 
jxtendod to make shipping points available. With expanding 
Jiiid apparently inexhaustible markets under the stimulus of 
she war, farms were rapidly built up. Tables A, E, and F 
reveal the rate of increase, the instability of the social 
structure, and the final decline and serious depopulation 
md abandonment after 1931. 

ihe following chapter outlines the extent to which 
the church followed tho same pattern of expansion and 
retraction. The number of ministers in the Prairie Region 
iropped from 53 in 1931 to 31 in 1942, that Is a decrease 
)f 22 men’ in 11 years. 

The community selected is one of the posts thus 
lepopulated and from which the church has withdrawn its 
oinister. This treatment Is entirely dependent upon census 
ind church records, hence no attempt will be made to deal

vith social and personal factors which are an important 
part of the story. 

Chinook and Cereal are two adjacent villages 
Located on the Canadian National Hallway nAnning east out 
3f Drumheller throu/^h Ranne and on Into Saskatchewan 
through Alsask. They are in the middle of Census Division 
o. 5, or more srecifically, are in adjoining comers of 
cuniclpal Districts Dos. 275 and 242. For pumoses of this 
fpork, tlo four townships icmiediately surrounding the two 
rillsfl'ee have been selected. These fomi a block 12 miles 
square with the railway running diagonally through it and the 
vlllsfces centrally placed. The more accurate description is;

The villages are first listed in the Census of 
L916 when, as Table A shows, the country was rapidly filling 
ip. The story of settlement in the four townships may be 
very briefly told by a comparison of census returns for the 
rural areas and, after their formation, the villages.

The church thus reported Is of the klethodiet 
denomination until 19;:^5, when it became a united Unurcn of 
Canada* Both Chinook and Cereal are listed ixa charges from 
the years 1917 to 1926 but the meoibership figures are here 
combined. There is no way of discovering how many of the 
members listed after 1931 are resident in the area and how 
(T.any have moved away but retained their memberahip in the 
local church. The numbers listed as being Under Pastoral 
Care might give some indication but, as it will be r*otlced, 
tney vary widely and are a most approximate guide. The 
history of the Chinook-Cei*eal church may be roughly sketched 
in the followln/T manner. 

The new farming settlement had had a very brief 
life before a Kethodist mission was established in the midst 
of it. In all probability they might be said to h.ve 
brought it with them. The churcn hud a comparative 
abundance of ministers at its disposal and us early as 1911 
when the area is first listed in tne census returns, a 
aiinister was posted to Chinook, xhe euri^ reports on 
membership are somewhat erratic but a general increase at 
least is definite. In 1917, by which time rhe total 
poTiulatlon of the four townships nad much inoi*e than 
doubled and the two villages had been incorporated, a second 
charge was opened at Cereal. The two village churches each 
made substantial gains In membership until 1923 though little

ohon<j:e le reflected In th-J reoord until 1926. Psrhapu the 
new system of Keepinc, re»«ords -- or at least th« now uluroh 
which collected and compiled them -- Is responsible for the 
sudden drop In membership between 1925 ad 1926. There Is 
no record In the Dlf^sts of the oynod of Alberta of there 
being a Presbyterian church in either of the villages so 
the decrease at tha time of union may in all probability be 
accounted for as a revision of the mombershlp roll. 

Certainly one would expect that tho population slump cf the 
Gilddle 1920*8 would be reflected In th*^ church. At any rate, 
the two chargee are again combined In 1926-27 with a total 
membership which had deoreasod from a peak of 103 In 
1920-21-23 tc 88. robi'bly not many could forses that their 
church was on the decrease for several yoers to come, yet 
such was the case. The ehi*roh membership Increases and 
decreases lend to lag aomswhat behind those of total 
population. Thus It is that the 1931 rise In population 
resulted in an Increased church membership throughout 1931- 
1936, than it continues downward. 

In the records of the United Chi^rch of Canada for 
the year 1939, the name end standing of the CMnook-Cereal 
charge does not appear, hor hes it since that date. 

Chinook is row listed as a preaching point wlt2*in the 
fonngptov.n charge. Cereal ie sloilerly included under the 
3yen field.

For ths tli/i-^ belnf' its iiistory au ai. or^uiii^^d obiirch is 
ended. The question we mujt ask is, why did that ha pen7 
'Vhat were the obstacles which could not be over cone? 

Sometimes the racial origins of people limit or 
prohibit the work of a Protestant church yet this does not 
seem to apply according to the 1956 census report.(1) 

This table is based on izunlcipal L'isoricts Ivos. 242 and 272 
and thus is only roughly true of the smaller area included 
in them.

The predominantly An.;lo-3azon and Scandinavian population 

would lead one to expect the greater numbers of people in 

Protestant churches. The figures on the >'locv 

are not available but the proportions of people in the 

various churches throughout Census Division ho. 5 lends 

support to the expectation. (2)

The most obvious reason for the decline of the 
church is, of course, the depletion of population which,

as has been pointed out, is serious. Coasidorabie survey 
vork has been done in tne area oi‘ which the ^/hl no ok-Cereal 
!)lock is a part. The maps and charts issued on the basla 
[)f that study yield the following facts about the four 
townships with which we are coiicsrAAoU; (1) 

Farms occupied in 1956 and 1939 . 41 


Farms occupied since 1936 . 3 

Farms abandonee since 1936 . 21 


It will be recalled that the last figures given 
on rural population (Table#)) were from the 1936 census. 
This report shows how much further the area has been 
depopulated. A dlffer(3nt sort of index is provided by a 
study of farm buildings in the area. These|were graded 
ss well as counted. (2)

Thus is recorded a story of serious disintegration 
and privation to the point of despair. The condition of 
farm buildines Is one way of measuring a farmer’s prosperity

iind his Iatv3re3t in uxJ Morii. in this area both must have 
:reached a low atib lor many poopie, ierhaps this in itself 
;.s enough to account Tor Che failure of the church to 
Burvive, Yet the story is not all told* 

The church in Chinook was orened with a smaller 
total population, and more scattered, than in 1941 for the 
y^illages alone contain 204 people *(1) It has been interest¬ 
ing and important to discover (see able 0) that while the 
ria.lngea siifecLea oy the same expansion ana retraction 

cycles, they do not display the v/ide variations which the 
rural area does. Indeed, the 1941-census shows some Increase 
In the vlllares which could scarcely be true in the country 
ilthoug.- figures are not available. It is perhaps 
significant that the church follows more closely the trends 
cf the country. 

One factor not yet mentioned as responsible in the 
dissolution of the charge is the availability of a minister 
f'or it. For the first time since its inception the charge 
was without a minister in 1937 and 1938. In other words 
it died without the benefit of clergy. The total numbers 
of clergy in the province had fallen off quite noticeably

since 1930 end tbo Toed por mlx^lster had increased more than 
proportionately. Thus la ^^iven an instance of the retreat 
of the church which is inadequ'Ately Liauned, 

Finally, it must be said tliat there is uot the 
demand for the church that there had been in an earlier day. 
It did not seem as Important to the coj.'iiuiilty in 1930-39 
as it did when the settlement was nev • This is said in a 
very general way .1th no knowledge of tlie thinking of that 
area in particular, Ead It been a truly vital instltutl n 
in the lives of the people who were left, some better 
arrangement would have been made. In many communities the 
church is thought oi as a spent force so far as community 
life is coiicerA^od, axsoit a necessary one for the proper 
conduct of haptlsns, v/eldings and funerals. 

The rural communitj’ failed, or at least in most 
respects lost its life, because it did not or c'^uld not 
sake the necessair/ adjustments to an extremely variable and 
unpredictable climate. Their social structure would not 
stand the strain of the poorer years. The church lost its 
place along with the people because its members moved way 
In large part and those who were left had not the ^snay or 
:he will to sup* ort it, or at least to demand the services 
of one of tne 243 men at work ^n the province. It too had

The next rural coflununity to come unaor die cue si on 
ie that of Olds. It is situatlren on the main line of the 
Canadian i^acific Railway about one third of the distance 
from Calgary to tSdmonton. It is located near the aouthern 
end of the Paric Belt region on the northern edge of Census 
Division No. 6, and is an old and well-established settle¬ 
ment . 


’’Wheat is the main cash crop near Olds, but tlie 
district is also noted for its dairy, live stcciw, 
ana nog-producing enterprises ... a provinoial 
agricultural colie *e and experiment station, 
situated on the outskirts of Olds offers excellent 
educational facilities to youn^- people in adjacent 
areas.” (1) 

”Farm ovners comprise 77 percent of all operators 
.... Associated with this large owner group are 
small proportions of owner-tenants and of tenants 
..... The explanation seems to be in the fertile 
soil and the arnle rainfall of tbf" Olds district.”(3) 


The area chosen for this study is again composed of 
the four townships immediately surrounding the town of Olds

It Is regretted that, as In the former oase, the 
1941 reports on population per township are not available, 
and the comparison Is Incomplete* The town has made steady 
prowth except for 1916 to 1921, ihe explanation for the 
drop In rural population In i9il and In the urban In 1916 
to 1921 Is not known to the writer but does not seriously 
affect the growth of the town and bomiiiunlty* Both have boon 
substantial and the resulting settlement rouglily 4f times 
the density of the similar area about Chinook and Cereal. 

The racial origins of the settlers are favorable 
to the work of a Protestant church.

early. In 1904 the ilethodlst church lists 108 members and 
the i resbyterian church was on the [ground also thoup;h their 
membership at that time Is not known by the writer* The 
i.^ethodlst membership varied from 105 In 1908 to 165 in 1922 
In the pre-union days but Is marked by a general Increase 
over the whole period. In 1925 tho Methodist membership 
was listed as being 152, The Presbyterian voted against 
Onion and decidad to continue in its own ri.’ht. The United 
Church thus was the continuance in the main of the former 
i'etbodlet the membership Increased to 177. 

The Unite Q Church history is tna auiua sotz of 

variation in membership as the “^thodlst has been. The 
figures vary from 16G in 1924 to 214 In 1951 but show a 
gredu&l increase over the entire period to a total of 210 
in 1942* 


The contrast between this and the Chinook-Cereal 

situation is marked. Aiere is no problem of depleted 

settlement end disintegration under physical circumstance, 

Cn the contrary, the population of both town and country 

has increased steadily. They were not faced by the 

dominance ofaracial group of a non-Protestant sort. 

indeed, Irofessor Pawson describes tlm religious composition 

of tho Olds district in the following terms.

in tho town ^nd 95 percent In the adjoining rural

areae but they divided themselves Into six major 
and several minor denominational /groups, Aooordlnr 
to census reports, the United Church group Is the 
largest both In town and country, where It forms 
39 and E0 per cent, respectively, of the total populations 
The rresbyterians form the second largest group In 
Olds Itself but they are only the fourth largest 
group in the o en country. Thf. Augllouns rank t Ird 
In both Pa^^tists cn^ Lutheranr are mainly 

ccrcentrated in the rirai arcuo v/here they rank second 
andififth in importance, -^’ht; Jat^olic

areas, ranks fifth and sixth respectively, t'.ennonltes 
numberlnc soTe 300 pertono, most of whom live In the 
rural areas, form the seventh largest ^roup in both 
town and country.’* (1) 

The prcbleiTiS facing the United Church of Canada in 
ttL- Olds sotting thus arpeer tc be mainly cultural rather 
than physical cnes, Oenominationaiiaiu, secularism and 
apathy are probably the grastcet obstacles because the 
Bociel ar.d tconoNiic stx^icture of the people has so far 
it least proven stable. That does not mean that the people 
irbo live there have no problems in tbeir living. It does 
lot mean that the physical and economic environment will 
ilways be favorable. It does mean that the problems here 
encountered are of a social ana cultural sort in their 


prl' ary nature. They are none the less rural. Indeed the 
church in Olds would seem to he as close to the centre of 
the life of r\iral Alberte as it is possible for any on 0 n^‘'"^^ 
ot only is the town a rural centic for one ui' tue oest;

responsible for meeting the needs of the few hundred rural 
Albertan young people who assemble from all over the 
province to attend the agricultural college there. Those 
who work for the IVture of nlbert-x envisage the tlt» when

to its rhyal.cal environment to provicie tla security and 
stability now arparont in the Olds Go/tniurilty. The future 
of tbo church ir Alberta lies in that environuent. Has 
it a place in e stable rural economy? -^hat sort of men

be recalled that the third region was the fringe to the

between tbj black soil cf the -Jids district and the

Chapter V 


PRINCIPLES, PROBLEMS, aI D PRO"CSALS 


**We believe that the Church Is the orRan of Christ’s 
mind and redemptive wlll^ the body of which Ha Is 
the Head. Under Him the Church Is called to the 
proclamation of the everlasting Gospel with Its offer 
of salvation, to the worship of God, Creator and 
Redeemer, to the loving service' of mankind, ana to 
the care and nurture of the flock.”(1) 


The essential nature of the church Is unqualified 
love and service to all. Its practical nature Is the 
r-^cognltlon and removal or barriers between man and man, 
between man and God, and the fostering In eve^.y human heart 
of communion with Gk>d. I'he Institutional nature of the 
Church often tends to blur and confuse the primary task and 
to rob it of meunine, vaUu service* rrofessor F. Scott 
states very aptly that, 

”Jesus himself laid down no directions as to how 
his foil )wers were to order their society. He only 
gave them a task to fulfill, end left them to 
d'SU-cover for themselves how they night do so most 
effectively. Again and again the church must 
organize Itself afresh to meet the requirements of 
each new time, and according as it Is best fitted to 
the time, it gives reality and meaning to Its message.(8) 


On the basis of such an understanding tlds chapter 
is designed to consider the organization of the United 
Church of Canada in the face of the requireiaents of our

time in the province of Alberta. It la apparent that aome 
draetic readjustment must be made if the church is to keep 
up even the present standard of work. The total population 
of the province la increasing, new areas of settlement are 
being oT'ened up in the northern and marginal regions, new 
social needs are felt in the older, more a ;ttled ooimunitles 
In the face of that, the number of men enp-at^ert In 
of the church is being steadily and drastically reduced. 
Surely all who have Interest and Influence in the work of 
the church in .^^Iberta are constrained to face the facts and 
to reorganize their resources accordingly. In such spirit 
the following principles are set down. 

Principles upon which the work and effective service of 
the church depend: 

A) Llinisters of the church must become aware of and be 
trained for the environment in which the work is to be done. 

It has already been demonstrated in this thesis 
that the work of the church followed very closely the 
pattern of settlement. It is not an indepenaent agency 
working with or for a group of people. It is the a,-ency 
of those people, its destiny is very closely correlated 
with theirs. From its Founder the church has learned that 
it can only save its life by giving it freely In service to 
men. It is thus inevitable that the life and work of the 
church changes with the life and needs of the people

imongat whom and to whom It mlnletera. In Alberta as we 
aave seen, the vast majority of the population Is rural. 

It must accordingly become aware of the needs of rural 
people and must train .nst of Its workers to meet those 
leeds. Still further, the needs of rural people vary vdth 
the stability and age of the settlement In which they live. 

In Alberta the growth In rural consciousness may bo 
braced in the history of the social and political 
Institutions which rural peonle have evolved. The United 
?’armers of Alberta, the many co-operative organizations of 
the snnller local variety as well as the alberta ’.vh^ at Pool, 
Jairy and xoultry xooia, une uo-opcratlve Council, and 
finally the .^.Iberta Federation of Agriculture, are all 
illustrations of developnent, progress in social thinking, 
and awareness of the Interdependence of all agriculturists, 
3uch institutions mark a sharp contrast to the earlier 
pioneer days In which rugged indlvlduliiisra was the pre¬ 
vailing philosophy. The population of Alberta has not only 
increased and spread out, it has also changed Its social 
aature and consequently has different needs. Has tne church 
Deen aware of that change? Ihe answer cannot be simply 
?iven but the life and possible service of the church 
lenends upon its ability to grow with the settlement. 

This process in the development of an agricultural 
settlement has been traced as follows;

ienionstrable that tho problemb facing the church at the 

preoeiit tine arc the coniifunity problens and not solely those 

>f personal conduct. The biVangelism and ^ocial Service 

Report presented to the Alberta Conference of the United 

Church of Canada in 1939 can scarcely te taken as expressive 

cf awareness of all United Church ministers but it is at 

least an indication that many are thinking in broader terms. 

’’We are drawing attention to the depreciation of values 
in Canadian life over the p st-war period, the rrov^th 
of slum conditions in our cities, and the hopelessness 
of debt-ridden farmers, which ultlmately^affoct us in 
our Tork of building character and maln^ing spiritual 
values, and realizing the Kingdom of God on earth.”(1) 


The aim here is not to outline the nature of 
society and its problems but to affirm the principle that 
the church must know the needs of its people In order to 
fulfill its ftinctlon as the agency of God’s redenptive 
power. 


B) The church must fill a distinctive and relevant place 
in the lives of people. 


There are many institutions designed to meet the 
needs of people in contemporary society. Clubs meet social 
needs, in some areas Cr dlt Unions and Co-operative 
projects help them economically, schools are widespread and

<*oveniinent supported honoe "o fer towards supplying their 
oduoatlon, District Agriculturists give valuable aid In

^Itted to meet? 

From the nature of Its calllnf' the church must be 
iltl'iiately responsible for the condition generally designated 
3L8 ’community* amongst the people of any one district. It 
Ls the authority upon matters of personal living and personal 
relationships. It is the revealer and insplrer of the 
highest life of man. »»hlle other insltutlons work towards 
the solution of technical and broadly social problems, the 
church alone can adequately meet the central ones of moral 
ind sniritual living, -^here is r.o substitute. If the 
church should fail to do its appointed task, the community 
sither disintegrates or evolves a real church to replace the 
cne which has ceased to be. Instances of the former are all 
too numerous. Ihe writer has no knowledge of the second 
alternative having been achieved. Ihus is a tremendous 
responsibility placed upon the church. There are innumer¬ 
able ways in which the lives of men are degraaed and made 
less spiritual. The chuich must eventually ^-uard against 
them all unless there are other agencies already effective. 
The preaching of high levels of living Is not only ineffect¬

unJuEt and irreparable debt. The relati nshlp between 
money and morals, or more marlcedly between money £*nd 
rell^.lon, Is painfully obvious whether a man has too little 
or too much. The task of the c^u^oh Is to help men so to 
stowwira Oixair resources that the life of the community of 
men is ennobled by them ratiier than degraded, that they may 
become truly citizens of the Kingdom. 

It is most encouraging^ to discover Instances in 

which the church has demonstrated this function. A current 

magazine contains an article entitled, ’Church Builds a 

Community*. (1) In July of 19i£ a young married parsjn. 

Rev. Calvin Schnucker, accepted an invitation to the pulpit 

of uamsey Refonaed Church, Iowa. 

"The church was a typical box-ahaped, wooden structure 
unpalnted for 15 years, witn window sills rotted out, 
and almost impossible to heat.... There had been a 
oiortgage on the church since 1894, and it was 
considered at inevitable as the law of gravity. 

Youth was conspicuous by its absence at services.” 

After two years of discouraging labor, he had an offer to 

a more prosperous field but he decided to stay. 

”V/ith that decision came another -- to dig deep into 
the community, find what was wrong and why the 
church was r.iostly a Sunday and funeral affair.” 

The district was in a grave condition. 

”The farmers had anywhere from $60.00 to $100.00 
an acre in xoney or mortga es tied uo in their land”.

Thon oaLie the ora ah* ^ight-caut com tuici two 
dollar hogs spelt ruin as curely ua if fire had burned 
houses and ^•loods devastated lands. For scores, all the 
results of a llfetlma of toll and saorlflca v;ere 8we]:t 
away. Foreclosures spread llko an epldeiiilc. Owner-ope rated 
farms dropped from the 65 percent of the prosperous daye 
to 20 percent In the country where kaiusey church i‘i loc*jkteu* 

The young minister sensed that more than property 
was being lost. A once substantial coromunlty was threatened 
with socl^ dlslnterratlon. detenilned that soTiethlng 
radical must be done to restore the land to the people. 

The radical methods he used need not be re3ated here though 
they are of great interest, ^u flee it to say that they 
• Deluded the preaching and glorification of rural life, 
beating the drums of thrift — alL'iost to the point of an 
obsession, the formation of a nev» agreoiueut tetween the 
insurance companies which held the mortgages and the 
dispossessed tenant formers, the aidin: of people who wsre 
trying to get a start, and finally, the use of expert 
agricultural advice was sought and its value demonstrated. 

The result is little short of a miracle. 

**The fall of 1942 saw 60 families well installed on 
owner-operated farms ... To date, not a sin^e f.— 
has been roreclosed on or even threatened, and all 
payments are up to date -- more than that, not one 
appeared in tne country’s long delinquent-tax list

••Wlth indlvldutil aohleye.Tient has gone oommunity 
progress. Nine new school houses haye been built 
In the area. Roads everywhere have been improved. 

When rural eleotrifioation started» oohnuoker 
organized a co-operative to brin^* the lines to his 
parish ... The church boomed. Young peonle 

swarmed in They started a Junday School in a 

schoolhouse 23 miles away, paid all the expenses, 
and now it is a mission church.... They (the 
community) are faithful to church and to S^inday 
suiiooi, ana in audition they have Tuesday night 
as their own. The fact that five young men have 
gone under Sohnucker^s leadership into the ministry -- 
most of them to serve rural fields — indicates 
that he doesn’t neglect his mein job." 


Thus has one church acted to chock the dis¬ 
integration of a community in the only way it could be 
rinally checked. It was not acting out of character in 
tackling the debt and poor livinr conditions of its members. 
Lt was simply facing the facts of its environment and 
neeting the needu of the people. Their response to 
iriproved conditions is altogether commendable to them and 
to the church. It was a noble work and a worthy pattern 
for all rural churchmen to follow. 


It might be argued by some that he faced an unusual 
situation, that rural Alberta communities do not offer the 
8affl.e opportunities. 

aural r^loerta communities have a history of their 
own and none of them is quite like that of the Ramsey 
Cliurch. The most alarming sln^'le fector in the rural

ha va termed ’oommunlty* is very seriously Jeopardized even 
in many of our most stable areas, iieferenoe was made in 
the first chapter to the writer’s home conir;unity• The 
block of farms immediately surrounding the ho/ne farm ere 
only a part of the whole community yet they form a natural 
community illustrate what has happened in 

many rural areas. In 19;30 twelvj fsAruiStoads supportea 10 
families and two bachelors. There was some debt attached 
to every home but they were all regarded as comparatively 
stable. Today five of those families have left; three 
because of foreclosures, one family died out and left no 
successors, the fifth quit farming. At present two families 
own their homes though there is still some debt attached to 
each of them. Five farmsteads are owned by absentee land¬ 
lords one of wnich has no tenant. Five farmsteads are in 
the hands of mortgaf,e companies and at present have no 
permanent residents on them. This farming block is not 
exceptional though it does contain a rather larger than 
isual percentage of small farms. It is however, a rough 
Indication of what is happening over a great part of rural 
alberta. 


The negnit^ide the task suggests the third 
principle upon which the v/ork oi rurai. onurch aepends.

agenoies wliloh are at once an express.on of, and a 
contributor towards, the welfare of the coamiunity. 

The Department of Jaixteiision of the University of 
Alberta has a far-reaching and valuable service to render 
to country peonle but is dependent upon the agency of soma 
local institution. The rural minister neglects one of his 
most valuable allies in being ignorant of this work. 


Rev. W. A. E. Doe of Barrie, Ontario, records 
come deducations from the oxp 0 Tr»lence of th« rural obur^^h 
in iJimcoe County. They are of relevance in Alberta also. 

1. "The minister should discover the agencies in his 
area at work for rural betterment and seek ways 
and means of co-operating with them. Paramountly 
this would apply to the Dominion-wide federation 
of Agriculture, of which he should become a 
member. 

2. V/here any actual prograinme is undertaken, or is 
in prof^ress, as the Federation of Agriculture 
Farm lorum, etc., the minister can do much by 
active cooperation himsalf and by encouraging 
his people from the pulpit and in visitation, so 
that as far as possible these prograL^nsas become 
the progra.iime of the church coinmunity, the loiuister 
an unofficial organizer. 

3. In the pulpit he should endeavor to inspire in the 
farmer hope and confiaenoe in thj future, and 
pride in his vocation and his essential and 
inalienable place in the national life. 

4. Far greater use of Rural Life Sunday ... 

5. Church-sponsored rural life conferences ... 

6. The genuine identifying of the minister with the 
peo'^ie of the comirunlty is most important ..."(1)

iodide the point. The calling of the church, the 

ice of v.od amongst his people, must never be forgotten, 

church is not simply a crutch to ecoaoTiio refonn or to

church must always hold centrali

not! alone of goods, securities, and social Institutions,

Protblems the church in Alberta must face, 

1, The po'^julation of Gilberts is of a very diverse nature. 
It is very mixed racially and denominationally which 
inelvitably complicates the work of any of its churches. 
iV hitl e this has bean a long-standing problem in .alberta, 

re is reason to believe that it must be faced still more 
listically. The 1941 census reports, for exanple, that 
Greek Orthodox membership has increased from 26,427 to 
991 during the last 10 years. That is, from 3.6 per 
to 4,3 per cent of the total po ulation. Romen

be dependent upon the success with which it meets the needs 
and wins the loyalty of its people. 

3. The most widespread difficulty the church in town, city 
DT country faoes Is the -vith v/]iich people 

rortird the church and its work. The lack oT 
support, tiiw few men who are called to its ministry, the 
Dpeii opposition to itp pro -ram and claims ere all indications 
Df the difficulty with which the church is faced. 

Reliction has lost the place it once had as the 
supreme sanctioning body and standard in society. It has 
lot successfully gained a new position. In part the con- 
iition is caueea by sheer ignorance of the claims and 
laaes of religion. In so far as that is so, it is a matter 
)f education. There has teen a marked increase of late in 
Religious Education in schools. The church records reveal 
that this is by no means a new development. For meiny years 
the matter has been before the Conference and bynod meetings 
mt progress has been slow. One of the chief deterrents 
to it throughout seems to have been the lack of ability or 
(mthusiasm on the nart of mlT^1pt«rs in -’rklng use of the 

oossibilities there have been in the puba.ic scnoolb. iho 
opportunities are reater now than they have ever been, 
ihe experi(fe>nts have been successful, teachers and pupils 

hike it. It remains for the church to be alert and co- 
(►perative.

!• ine final problam facing tno church is that of 
loriously depleted ranica of cler’y. This difficulty follows 
loon the others and is as much a symptom of the church’s 
5onditlon as the cause of It. It vlll not be overcome 
ipart from the other defects. Attempts have been mnde to 
Lmprovo methods of recruitlnr young men and ?/lth some 
success, but nothing of permanence has been ao laved. 

Thera are many further problems that could be, 
vlth equal validity, Included in this list. Perhaps sou» 

)f th3 Icey ones have been omitted. Certainly, however, 
ihey do indicate the necessity of the church taking very 
eriously the matter of considering Its position with the 

'b'c.

]iecessary to more adequately use its resources and fulfill 
:.t3 great task. 

Three proposals mijht be ]::iade spcciria«-.lj.y at tnua 
';ifue on the basis of this study. 

If the principles outlined above have any merit they 
demand men of a high degree of training. Furthermore it 
must be a training of a sneclal sort since it must prepare 
uhem for work in particular environments. It is notable 
tnat the Methodist Church recogiiized the need for training 
men to meec rural situations. Its training, of probationers

It is altogether re,grettable that such a study 
has been discontinued. ^parently it v/as lost in the 
process of the union of the churchee at which time the 
training of etudonts was left entirely with the colleges. 
•Vhatever the reason, there 1b nothing at present In the 
training of an Albertan for the ministry that compares In 
scope and thoroughness ?.ith such e course. Whether 
ministers are again asked to take some part in the training 
of men or whether the colleges can devise soi^e way to 
achieve the same end is another problem. It is certain 
that the training is needed if there is to be an informed, 
effective ministr:/ in rural Alberta. 


It is notable, too, that the interest did not stop 
with the students, ihe conference also studied sociology.

A Rural Surrey was conducted In 19ie-17 which staged Its 
purpose as follows: 

^At the last Annual Conference a Committee was 
ap:olnted to secure data fro . all the .iiasions 
and Circuits bearing on the Rural life of this 
province, which may serve as the ground work of 
the pastoral address and a nrofi^ablo consideration 
at conference of the manner in which our church may 
best serve the community •••'* 

'^usstlons are based on 4^onulation; population 
ohungea, the activities of young people, nationalities, 
size of fanii, tenure, economic conditions* Other sections 
are luoiio iJchools, Social Life and Instltutloi s, Literary 
and Cnurchet. Such work Is long overdue in our present 
condition* A siri.ilar survey would be of inestimable value 
to those who make It, to all who work 'vith or who are 
interested in rural life, both as a basis for cofrparlson 
with the former survey and In its own rivht* 

8. The second proposal is really a ’'art of the first 
in that it also has to do with tho training of students* 

It is, however, more specific and iminadiately possible* The 
three Irairie Trovlnces are sufficiently alike and inter¬ 
dependent to be handled as a unit of study for a rural 
sociologist who would divide his time between the three 
Fralrie Theological Colleges and whose work would be 
s-eciflcally that of preparing men for the work of the church 
in the rural environment* The addea expense would be 







-00- 


entlrely Justified by the aVsolute need of the western 
churches and comnunltles and by the promise of a return of 
the church to larp«r usefulness, 

3. The third proposal has already been 8 U 3 . ssted by 
some offloliils of the church, it has to do with the 
pcssitie reorganization of rural chui'oh districts to maJee 
tore effective use of loc^l resources and to conform mors 
nearly to the natural economic configuration of the 
community. 

The need for reorganization is suggested not only 
by the shortage of men and tha many that have 

already taken place, but by the situation wMch exists in 
such a com runity as Olds which has already been dlscuesed. 

In that instance the town was the economic centre for a\ 
large area Including the fringe conimu.jity of oundre. The 
same might be said of every major town on the Canadian 
Fuclflo line between Edmonton and Cal^v^ry as well as of many 
l^istricts to the east of Edmonton and in the Peace River 
region. It was noted that at Olds the church had made a 
steady but slow ^^rowth and had no effective 00 cation 
with the oundre people who contributed to the life of the 
town and were really a part of its people. 

It would seem reasonable that the major church 
5 f tho area should consider Itself responsible for the

religiou3 needs of the entire area. Of courae the mlnleter 
Is available for weddings and funorals. A.nd they may 
attend services *n Olds whenever they wish, but no 
consistent effort has yet been made to minister to tl elr 
commur.ity life. The difficulties of doing so are great 
of course. The minister is very busy with the many 
problems of a towxi of almost 1400 people. The church 
members are involved in their own business and their own 
social problems. The difficulty is not that someone is 
slacking. It is rather that they have not yet found a way 
to become effective over the whole area for which they are 
really responsible. in as wei± established a 

cer.tro as Olds the raalor liniitotton is thct tine rather 
than of money, it will be ranembored ia thw growth 

of the Kansey Church the stage v;as reached at which a^ 
Sunday School and eventually a missioii church was 
established in a com/iunity 23 ailes distant. That type of 
activity is of the very nature of Christianity when it 
becomes a part of the lives of people/. It is perhaps a 
matter of increasing the staff of ths churchy for the needs 
of the fringe conr-iunltics are modical and educational in 
a way in which the needs of the more stable comnunity are 
not. There has not been an abundance of trained community 
workers but here would seem to be au area where one might 
be employed just as social workers are employed in the 
larger cities.

The need Is for the church to tfclrk In regional 
terms* 'hat are the needs of the several oontmurltles 
around the regional centre? Vvhat are the total resources 
in terms of workers? Whore does the financial responsib¬ 
ility lie? how best can ail tne contributory a^;;encie8 and 
workers combine their efforts to most efficiently develop 
Ciiristian coiuiaui.ities over the v/hole arca^ 

In conclusion of the thesis, the d mend for an 
Increased rural consciotisnoss in the cloirch in Alberta 
mist be stressed* Too long has the country' been neglected 
and jlveii what has be on left over. Thu.t Interest and 

..IjLj- be. uoiiionsnratea when the Conference finds it 
necessary to appoint a nev/ coronittee either as supplementary 
to or analagous to the Coinnittee on Evangelisn and Social 
Service* Unless sone such adjustmt>nts are nada to meet the 
needs of the rural areas of Alberta, the next chapters of 
church history will be a more sorry continuation of the 
present one* The prayer of ali Cod’s servants must be that 
they may live and serve that His Kingdom, the only true 
iemocracy, may be known amongst man. Ihis prayer I now 
take for the church I serve*
