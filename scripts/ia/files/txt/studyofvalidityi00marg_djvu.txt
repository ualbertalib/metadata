ABSTRACT 


This investigation deals with the ’’Paracolon bacilli” as en¬ 
countered in Enteric Bacteriology, An attempt has been made to 
determine the validity of the classification of such strains in 
the genus raracolobadrum as suggested, by Borman, Stuart and 

Wheeler (1944). 

Cultural and biochemical as well as serological characters 
were investigated. Mention is made for comparative purposes, of 
the study of the pattern of protein metabolism as determined by 
"paper chromatographic” methods in a concurrent investigation by 

another worker. 

The genus faracolobsctrum as defined by Borman, Stuart, and 
Wheeler was found to be valid. The validity of the species 
Paracolobactrum aerogenojdes was also accepted* The species 
Paracolobaetrum intermedium was, with one reservation, found to 
be valid. The validity of the third species, Iaracolobactrum 
colifoms was questioned. 

The similarity of the biochemical reactions of this genus 
and. those of the genus Salmonella were indicated and the pract¬ 
ical value of the adopted classification in differentiating be¬ 
tween the two genera was demonstrated.

According to Sandiford (1935), the term "Paracolon" was first 
used by Gilbert and Lien in 1893 when they described a group of 
cclifcrm bacilli found in the faeces of dysentery patients. These 
organisms did not ferment lactose, (time of incubation not stated) 
but they produced acid and gas in other test substances. They 
varied as regards indole production and motility. 

Stuart et «1 (1943) tell us that the term was again used by 
Widal and Nobeccurt in 1897 to describe s. slowlactose fermenting 
bacillus isolated from patients suffering from gastro-enteritis. 

%nce the beginning of the present century, reference to such 
organisms has become increasingly frequent in medical literature. 
Generally they have been described as paracolon bacilli but in 
certain instances as "aberrant ccliforms tt . At the present time the 
term '"Paracolon ft seems to be preferred. 

.Articles by such authors as Seeliger (1951) working in 
Germany, Sevitt (1945) in Dublin, Sandiford (1935) in Cairo, and 
Stuart ©t al (1943) working in Providence, U.S.A. indicate that 
the occurrence of such strains is widespread indeed. 

Unfortunately, however, with the increase in the number of 
references to these strains, the problem of their classification 
has at the game time become increasingly complicated. There seems 
to be not a little confusion between the various authors as to the 
definition of the paracolon bacilli.

The problem has become of sufficient importance to merit some 
discussion in recent text-books (Topley and Wilson - (1946) and 
Breed, Murray and Hitchens (1948)). 

Topley and Wilson describe them as follows: 

"These organisms ferment lactose late, weakly, 
irregularly, or not at all. Some constantly 
give rise to non-lactose fermenting variants. 

Some produce gas abundantly, and some in only 
small quantity; others are completely anaer- 
ogenic. A few species are pathogenic for man; 
others are under suspicion; others again are 
almost certainly non-pathogenic. Some are 
found in faeces, some in water, some in soil 
and so some in other situations.” 

Breed, Murray and Hitchens describe the genus Baracolo - 
bactrum (Borman, Stuart and Wheeler (1944)) as: 

’’Short rods characterized by consistently delayed 
fermentation of lactose (occasionally negative). 

Glucose is fermented with the formation of visible 
gas. Certain forms attack carbohydrates character- » 
istically at 2(PG to 30°C but not at 37°C. Anti¬ 
genic relationships to other genera in the family 
are fairly common, even with respect to major anti¬ 
gens, The type species is Paracolobactrum aero - 
genoiaes . M

CLASSIFICATION 

In spite of the increasing importance of paracolon bacilli 
there has, as yet, been no international agreement on either defin¬ 
ition or classification. In fact only a brief examination of the 
literature is necessary to indicate the variety of organisms to 
which the term "Paracolon" is applied* 

Sandiford (1935) is one of several authors who regard 
paracolon' bacilli as organisms giving acid and gcs in glucose and 
mannite in 24 hours, no change in sucrose or lactose in t: e same 
time, and not agglutinating with paratyphoid" antisera. The 
summary of Sandiford 1 s article indicates that he considers indole 
production an additional feature necessary to the identification of 
paracolon bacilli. 

Sevitt (1945) has studied a number of strains of paracolon 
bacilli with regard to their aetiological importance in an out¬ 
break of infantile diarrhoea in Dublin. He defines paracolons 

as follows; 

"Gram-negati e rods of the genus Bacterium which 
either fail to ferment lactose, or ferment it 
late or irregularly. They attack other sugars 
however, producing acid or acid and gas. Bio¬ 
chemically they usually differ fro© the Salmonella 
and dysentery groups, They differ from Proteus. 
in failing to spread cn solid media if ©cttleV 
Most strains fail to liquefy gelatin and do not 
produce HpS, Most paracolon bacilli closely re¬ 
semble the coli-aerogenes group, but differ from 
©embers of the group in their failure to or slow¬ 
ness to attack lactose."

He divides his strains into four groups as shown in Table 1.

Schwabacher (1949) in a biochemical classification makes a 
preliminary division on tb© fermentation of sucrose. Her class¬ 
ification can be represented by Figure 1. 

After using such a tentative classification she states that: 

M There was no constant association between biochemical 
and serological groups. Nor was there an antigen 
common to all or even the majority of paracolon 
strains. 51 

In neither of these classifications are "generic” or specific 
definitions given. The biochemical reactions listed are somewhat 
limited in each case as they do not include such reactions as the

CLASSIFICATION OF THE PARACOLON BACILLI

“Imvic” group. The strains studied are varied and are occasionally 
quite dissimilar. 

Borman, Stuart and Wheeler (1944) have suggested a consider¬ 
ably more extensive classification than any of these just consid¬ 
ered. Not only is it more extensive but genera and species are 
well defined. In their article entitled “The Taxonomy of the 
Enterobacteriaceae” they have to a certain extent rearranged the 
entire tribe of Enterobacteriaceae and they have added several new 
genera. One of these is “ Paracolobactrum “ which seems to cover 
the paracolon bacilli as they arc generally identified. 

Figure 2 represents their suggested classification. 

Tie genus Colobactrum is defined as follows: 

"Aerobic, non-sporing gram-negative short rods. 
Fermentation of glucose and lactose with form¬ 
ation of visible gas in 24 hours at 37°C. Widely 
distributed in nature as saprophytes. A common 
antigenic pattern is not diseernable within any¬ 
one biochemical type.” 

The genus Paracolobactrum is defined as follows: 

“Aerobic, non-sporogenic, gram-negative rods 
characterized by consistently delayed ferment¬ 
ation of lactose (may occasionally be negative). 

Glucose is fermented with the formation of visible 
gas. Certain formsattack carbohydrates at 25°C 
but not at 37°C. Antigenic relationships to other 
genera in the family is fairly common, even with 
respect to the major antigens.” 

In each case the definition is ammended by subdivisions as 


in Table 2

Edwards, West and Bruner (1948), West, Edwards and Bruner (1947a) 
and (1947b). Accordingly an attesqpt has been made to determine the 
serological relationships between members of the P. aerogenoides 
group as found xvithin this Province.

METHODS 

1. Collection of strains 

The majority of the cultures investigated wre derived from 
faecal and urinary specimens received in the Bnterobacteriology 
Department• 

Specimens were planted directly to MaeConkey and SS agar 
plates (Difco) and were introduced into tetrathlonate broth. 

To the latter about 1 gram of faeces was added or up to 3 cc of 
urine and the plates together with the tetrathionate broth cult¬ 
ures were incubated overnight at 37°C. On the following day, sub¬ 
cultures were made from the tetrathionate broth to MacConkey and 
SS plates. In all cases the plates were examined after overnight 
incubation for the presence of white {non-lactose-fermenting) 
colonies. If such colonies were present they were picked to lact¬ 
ose broth and peptone water. Two picks were md© from each plate 
unless the colonial mor hologf suggested that there were more 
than two types of colonies present - in this case a suitable num¬ 
ber were picked to include all types present on the plate. Colo¬ 
nies of dubious non-lactose fermenting qualities were also picked 
to exclude the possibility of overlooking possible pathogens. 

Further biochemical reactions were determined on the strains 
w ich were negative in lactose broth in 24 hours. These reactions 
included fermentation of glucose, sucrose, mannitol and duleito! 
as well as the production of hydrogen sulphide and indole. The 
original lactose broth was read again after 4P hours incubation. 

Proteus, Pseudomonas and Alkaligenes were recognised on

these reactions. SalmonsII and Phigella were suspected on these 
reaction? and confirmed by appropriate serological tests* There 
remained a group which fell into one of the following three cat¬ 
egories: 

1* Organisms which fomented both glucose and mannitol >/ith 
the production of acid and gas, and which, because of a positive 
indole reaction, ./ere excluded from the Salmonella group* 

2. Organisms which fermented both glucose and mannitol with 
the production of acid and gas and which, because of a negative 
agglutination test were excluded fr.m the Salmonella genus. 

3. Orgahlsms which fermented glucose only with the production 
of acid and gas. 

This group formed the H probable Paracolors” and further bio¬ 
chemical reactions were determined as follows: 

1. Fermentation’ of arablnose, xylose, sorbitol, inositol, 
rhamnose and salicin. 

2. Utilization of citrate and urea. 

3* Fermentation of sodium d-tarirate. 

4. Gelatin liquefaction. 

5. Reaction in litmus milk. 

6. Determination of Voges Proskauer and Methyl Bed reactions. 

These tests permitted a fiml identification cf r Faracolo - 

bactru^ ” strains and the others were discarded fr m this investig¬ 
ation. In this work the ” ?ar?--colobactrum ” do not include any 
sucrose positive strains nor any anaerogenic strains. It was found 
early in the investigation that sucrose positive strains occurred

very frequently and to include them would have given too many 
cultures to handle conveniently. By the definition given earl¬ 
ier, ; aracolobactrum is aerogerdc. The majority of anaerogenic 
strains can probably be classified under ** Proshigella ** and do 
not concern this investigation, 

2, Maintenance of cultures for study . 

In many instances a considerable time interval was likely 
etween the isolation and subsequent studies of the organisms, so 
it was necessary to adopt a method of maintaining them in culture 
until required* All strains to be kept were planted on egg saline 
slants, incubated overnight, sealed with paraffin wax, and stored 
in the refrigerator* lumbers of transplants varied. In some 
cases none were made, 

46 of the cultures isolated in the early part of the invest¬ 
igation were dried and maintained in that condition until required. 
The method of Stamp and Stone (194?) was adopted. It is not only 
simple but requires relativeljr little time* 

A large number of these dried cultures were transplanted 
after a time interval of approximately two years* The discs 
were placed in plain broth and incubated at 3?°G. overnight. In 
all but three instances good growth was obtained. In these three 
instances new discs were placed in serum broth and incubated as 
before* Good growth was then obtained with these also. 

3* Serological methods .

tion and in both cases the method of Edwards and Bruner (1942^ 
was used. 

The antigen used for preparation of an M 0 M antiserum was 
a 24 hour broth culture boiled for two hours and preserved by 
the addition of0,4$ formalin. It was found that the use of 
standard amounts of broth (30ee) gave antigens of comparable 
and suitable density and standardisations for density was not 
carried out* 

Fully grown male rabbits were used, and injections were 
given intravenously using the marginal vein of the ear* The 
primary dose was 0*5 cc and injections were given at five day 
intervals doubling the dosage each time to a maximum of 5 ec* 

A trial bleeding was done five days after the fifth injection 
and a good titre was obtained in most cases* A few animals re¬ 
quired a sixth injection but in only one case was a good litre 
net obtained at this time, /-'hen a satisfactory tit re was ob¬ 
tained, the animal was bled and the serum preserved with merth- 
iolate* The majority of animals dood the injections well. In 
the latter part of the investigation a few animals experienced 
severe reactions following the initial dose* The initial dose 
was then reduced to0*25 cc doubling the dose for further in¬ 
jections as before. 

n K tt antisera were prepared in somewhat the same manner. 
Antigens were again 24 hour broth cultures, this time preserv¬ 
ed immediately by the a Edition of 0.4$ formalin, without boiling. 
Strains to be used for M H tf antigens were passed through soft

agar several times to ensure the development of forms with maximum 
flagellar substance for use as antigen* The primary injection was 
0.25 cc. A good litre was obtained after three injections rather 
than five* The animals were bled and the serum again preserved by 
the addition of merthioX&te. 

4* utination tests , 

a) !> Q* a^aluiin&tion tests * 

wo methods were commonly employed in the performance of ”0 |! 
agglutination tests. The tube m ethod employed boiled broth antigens 
sirailiar to those used for the preparation of antiserum.* Tubes 
used were 10 x 75 am and 1 cc each of antiserum dilution and anti¬ 
gen was placed in each tube* ■ These were incubated for 4 hours at 
52°C and then overnight at room temperature. Tests were read with 
the aid of a fluorescent light against a dark" background and were 
considered positive when the supernatant fluid had become clear and 
the organisms had formed a granular sediment at the bottom of* the 
tube. Antiserum dilutions varied with the particular test being 
carried out. 

The slide method employed in almost all cases a 1/10 dilution 
of the antiserum in saline and the antigen was supplied by the sus¬ 
pension resulting from the suspension of the growth from an agar 
slant (15 x .120 mm tubes) in not more than 1 cc of normal saline* 

To a drop of antiserum in a hollow ground slide a drop of the 
antigen suspension was added and the mixture was mixed first with 
a wooden applicator and then rotated for several seconds. The 
reaction was observed with the aid of fluorescent light against a

dark background over a period of not more than two minutes. 

i 

Agglutinations were recorded as 4 +++ (collet©} to + (doubtful), 
b) *H W agglutination teats . 

These were always carried out as tub© tests. The antigen 
was prepared in the same way as that used in the preparation of anti 
sera. 1 cc each of antigen and antiserum dilution indicated were 
placed in a 10 x 75 mm test tube in a 5£°C water bath and incubated 
for one hour. At the end of this time the tests were read with a 
fluorescent light against a dark background. A positive test show¬ 
ed clear fluid with loose, fluceulent clumps of organisms. These 
tests were not allowed to stand for more than fifteen minutes so 
that cross reactions due to w 0** agglutination did not become evident 
5. Absorption tests. 

Preliminary tests with *Q n antisera of high titre and their 
homologous antigens indicated that the following method supplied 
sufficient absorbing suspension to absorb all antibodies present. 

For each absorption four antigen bottles were used. These 
were twelve ounce flat bottles with a slant of plain agar on one 
side. They were inoculated with a suspension of the organism in 
broth using about 1 cc of suspension for each bottle. The sur¬ 
face of the agar was covered with the fluid to ensure uniform 
inoculation and then the bottles were incubated for 84 hours in 
such a position that the fluid remsi xfa. on th© surface of the 
agar. On the following day 10 ec of normal saline was added to 
each bottle and the growth suspended in the fluid. The suspen¬ 
sions were collected in tubes and centrifuged, Th© clear supern-

atant was discarded and the sediment used as the absorbing sus¬ 
pension , To half of the suspension 1 cc of serum to be absorbed 
was added# This was placed in a 52°C water bath for tw hours. 
After centrifuging the supernatant was removed and added to the 
other half of the absorbing mixture. The process was repeated 
and the supernatant from the second incubation was the absorbed 
serum. This serum was cleared with chloroform and stored in the 
refrigerator for testing* The usual type of ?, 0 r? tube agglutina¬ 
tion was used to determine the efficiency of the absorption in 
each case. 

Procedure for M H M serum was almost identical except of course 
that the procedure for W H W agglutination was used in determing the 
efficiency of the absorption.

INCIDENCE OF PA R* COLO N BA CULT AND FA CTORS RE LATED T HERETO 

1. Incidence of Paracolon bacilli 

Tie discussion of the classification of the paracolon bacilli 
indicated the variations in the definition of this term when dis¬ 
cussed by different authors. It is therefore difficult to draw any 
comparisons regarding the incidence of such organisms from figures 
noted in different papers. 

Sandiford (1935) working in Cairo, found that of faecal 
specimens sent to his laboratory for culture for various reasons, 
16.1# of those examined for dysentery, 10*4$ of those for enteric 
fevers, c> .6 of those considered normal and 4*4$ of urines yielded 
paracolon bacilli. He did not include sucrose fermenting or indole 
negative strains in this investigation. 

Ssviit (1945) working in Dublin on the problem of infantile 
diarrhoea, found that 26.21 of the faecal specimens from patients 
and 111 of the controls (normal) yielded paracolon bacilli. He 
apparently did include sucrose positive and both indole positive 
and indole negative strains. It must be pointed out that in his 
work he was dealing with a very limited age group, up to two 
years of a ( ;,e only. 

In Edmonton, during the year 1950, 794 "enteric" specimens 
were received. On culture, 76 or 9$ yielded Salmonellae or 
Shi a ell c-e and 239 or 30$ yielded strains that fell into the 
’’probable paracolon 11 group. Of these, 91 or 11$ were actual 
S-'arscolohr otrum strains (according to the definition given on 


page 5)

2. Incidence of Par a co lofc actrum species 


To the above paracolons were added 77 cultures isolated by 
the general bacteriology section of the Laboratory and 16 
cultures isolated by the Provincial Veterinary Laboratory. 

These strains were isolated during the same period and were 
included for purposes of comparison. 

The strains from the general bacteriology section (ident¬ 
ified by the letter M) were from a variety of sources such as 
urines, sput-ums* wound swabs and foodstuffs. 

Cultures received from the Veterinary Laboratory(ident¬ 
ified. by the letters AP) were from either animal or avian(pou¬ 
ltry) sources. They were isolated, during the course of routine 
examinations carried out by that laboratory. 

A total of 334 strains were examined and classified as 
M probable paracolon.” Of these, 119 were found to be D aracolo- 
bactrum strains and the others were discarded for a variety of 
reasons. Some discarded strains were anaerogenic and some man- 
rite negative. Many were urea positive or did rot correspond to 
the definition in other respects. 

Table 4 gives the source of strains and their specific id¬ 
entity in the genus f'aracolobactrum.

The work of Stuart et al (1%3) offers some comparison on the 
incidence of the various strains. 

They examined all paracolon strains submitted to them at Brown 
University in Rhode Island, U»S,A,, over a period of five years. 

Of 465 strains considered, 77*4$ were from patients suffering from 
gastro-enteritis, 18,1$ from food handlers, and 4*5$ from "others." 

Table 5 compares the identity of the strains encountered.

The percentage of P. aerogenoides is the same in each case, 
although the comparison is not entirely justifiable, since the 
number of strains considered in the Brown University survey is 
approximately four times greater than in this investigation. It 
might also be pointed out that almost half of the P. intermedium 
strains met with in Alberta, originated in the same institution. 
The workers in the Brown University survey said that they 
saw some evidence of geographical segregation within the paracolon 
group since ’’with few exceptions, strains fra?- one locality were 
frequently identical with cultures from the same, but seldom with 
the strains from different localities 1 *, 

3, Effect of Differential media on Incidence 

Some authors have suggested that the incidence of paracolon 
bacilli has increased with the introduction of various ,J enrich¬ 
ment media”. Table 6 indicates the incidence of the various 
species in relation to the media used in this investigation.

Table 6 shows that P, coilforme was isolated roost frequently 
from the direct plates, and especially from direct MacConkey, The 
isolation of P, aerogenoides was not so significantly related to 
the type of culture medium used, but there was certainly no evid¬ 
ence that it was particularly favoured by the "enrichment medium".

PARACOLOBA CTRUM 

During the time interval that elapsed before special studies 
were undertaker., a few strains died, As a general rule, only one 
strain from each patient was kept for special investigation. For 
these reasons the number of strains remaining available for special 
investigation is less than the number indicated in Table 4* 

All strains were gram negative bacilli of the usual coll form” 
type, orphologicully, there was some difference between species* 

P, coliforme strains were somewhat shorter and fatter than the other 
two species ; P, aerogenoide-s o ccasionally showed rather uneven 
staining which could be described as "barring* 1 . 

On Mac donkey’s and S3 agar the colonies frequently had a slight¬ 
ly brownish tinge, but in no instance could they be regarded as lac¬ 
tose fermenters* 

Table ? represents the biochemical reactions encountered in 
the strains reserved for special study. It also indicates their 
identity according to the Borman scheme. Several points stand out. 
The absence of sorbite and inosite fermentation was a general 
character applicable to the genus. Hydrogen sulphide production on 
the other hand was limited to the intermedium group, as was with 
one or two exceptions the capacity to ferment duleite. 

The variations between the general biochemical characters do 
not vary more than those of established species within the genera 
-Salmonella and Shigella . 

Occasional strains possessed fermentative activity consider¬ 
ably different from their respective species patterns. The problem

2. Cultural and Biochemical Reactions 

These strains were morphologically fairly uniform and indist¬ 
inguishable from usual Snterobacteriaceae such as Salmons 11ae and 
E. coli . They were non-haemolytie, for the most part sluggishly 
motile, and with one exception non—chromogenic* One strain $M2533 
produced a lemon yellow pigment, but since in all other respects it

Strain •'•■' P8 serves well as the type culture. It was a gram- 
l motile bacillus P.J^lorr by 0l $ a- 
ruder. Unevenly stained or "barred" forms were fairly frequently 
seen. Some variation was seen in colonial morphology. Hough 
forms appeared frequently. These were proceeded by slightly flat¬ 
tened colonies not usually seen in this family* Tn addition this 
phenomenon was contort to 3 11 strains. Approximately half of the 
strains studied produced small colony variants, which were indist¬ 
inguishable biochemically from the usual large forms. In liquid 
media the production of a ®mm or pellicle on the surface of the 
media was not, uncor-mon. This was not necessarily associated with 
roughness and could readily be removed from broth antigens by fil¬ 
tration. 

The production of a rather pungent unpleasant odour was common 
in this specie?. This odour me not noted in other Pamcolohaotrua 
bled somewhat that of alpha imphtMlasdii ®. 

The biochemical reactions mm fairly uniform.. Olueese and 
maurmite mre fermented in 24 hours ’with the production of acid 
and gas* Sucrose, duXdt®, sorbite and inoeite failed to be ferm¬ 
ented in the s ms time. 3 strains gave faint reactions in salicin

eighth day and in most cases it took from 14 to 24 days to appear. 

6 strains had still failed uo produce fermentation at the end of 
30 days. 

Strains 028 and #M2533 were the only ones which clotted milk 
although a number of the other strains produced acid. At the end 
of twelve days 11 strains had produced acid in litmus milk and 
three had rendered the medium alkaline. The rest of the strains 
produced no observable change in this time. 

Table 9 gives the detailed biochemical reactions of this 
species. Strains #32 8 and #M2533 varied in several respects from 
the other strains included. 

With the exception of these two strains already mentioned, 
#328 and #$2533# the former citrate positive and the latter indole 
positive, these reactions are fairly uniform.

OBSERVATIONS ON THE SUL TPRA L AND BIOC HEMI CAL R ACTIONS OF THE 

p# imvimm im group 

1# Incidence * 

16 strains isolated belonged to this species# Of these, 12 
remained available for special study# Eleven were isolated from, 
faecal specimens and the other one was received from the Provin¬ 
cial Veterinary Laboratory. 

2, Cultural and Biochemical Reactions 

The first strain encountered, ,'la, served well as the type cul¬ 
ture for this species. It was ,a gram-neg tive, non-sporir.g red 2^*^ 
long and 0#*k^ in diameter# It grew well on ordinary media produc¬ 
ing the usual !, ccliform T1 type of colony. It was nor:- - chronic gen i c and 
on blood a; or ncn-hnemclytie• In common with the other strains 
studied it produced mere than the usual amount of turbidity in liquid 
media. This was accompanied by the production f some sediment# 
Strain #la, in common with most of the other strains studied, 
produced an unpleasant odour, which could be described as %ildly 
putrid R . 

Tabic 12 indicates the biochemical reactions of this strain and 
the other strains belonging tc the same species# It will be re¬ 
called that the particular criteria for inclusion in this species 
were a negative Voges Proskauer reaction and a positive citrate 
reaction in 24 hours. Strain #la, in common with the other mem¬ 
bers of the species, failed to ferment inosit© or saliein, but

did ferment arabincse, xylose, rhamncse and maltose with the prod¬ 
uction of acid and gas, Ac indicated in Table 12, fermentation of 
dulcite varied v’th the strains, 

Lcctose was fermented by the eighth day, but rarely was much gas 
produced by this time, Xn fact, gas did not appear in any significant 
amount even after another week’s incubation. Sucrose fermentation, if 
it took place at all, was much slower than lactose* ^ucrose tubes 
were incubated for two weeks, and there ws only a very faint suggest¬ 
ion of colour change. This did not appear in all tubes and was not 
sufficient to indicate definite acid production, hydrogen sulphide 
was produced in large amounts by all strains except #123 which was 
alec th only strain producing indole, Lome strains were able to 
liquefy gelatin partially, but this ability w s not general and was 
at best slow and weak. All strains were motile. 

Litmus milk was acidified and clotted by all organisms* The 
tire required was a little longer than that for the fermentation 
of lactose. 

Strain #123, in spite of its positive citrate reaction and 
negative Vbges Proskauer, in many respects appeared to be more 
closely related to the P. coliforme roup. It acidified and 
clotted litmus milk more rapidly than any of the other strains. 

This fact in conjunction with the positive indole reaction and 
the negative hydrogen sulphide suggest the P, cellforme rather 
than the ?, intermedium species,

In other respects, however, they did not conform to the general 
pattern of protein metabolism for the group* 

A detailed study of the amino acid utilization by the ?, aerogenoides 
group was carried out in the same investigation* Some similarity in the 
utilization of alanine was detected within the following pairs and groups 
of strains: 

1* #251 and #345

In the investigation of the antigenic composition of the I-- * aerogenoides 
group which follows, some similarity may b© seen between these groups and 
those whose somatic antigenic makeup is related*

PRELIMINARY PISCU3SI0* CP THL CULTURAL ATP BIOCHEMICAL CHAb'CTEKS 

OF ' HK GENUS PARA COLOB AGTRIP 

The morphological and biochemical reactions of the strains 
studied conformed to the genus Paracolobactrmn as defined by 
Borman et al (1944). The boundaries of this genus, as described 
by them^are wide and the main point of differentiation from the 
Salmonella genus is the ability to ferment lactose slowly. While 
this difference between the two genera is not readily discernable, 
other differences became evident from the mor; hological and bio¬ 
chemical studies undertaken. 

All strains placed in the ^aracolobaetrum genus failed to fer¬ 
ment inosite. None were able to utilise urea as the sole source of 
nitrogen and were therefore not members of the Proteus group. The 
three different groups within the genus presented certain reactions 
characteristic of each species which, when combined with the gen¬ 
eral generic reactions^ served to differentiate them from other 
species and genera. While the pattern of protein metabolism did 
not demonstrate a pattern characteristic of the whole genus, it 
did demonstrate patterns for each group which were different from 
those of other genera studied. A consideration of each group 
separately will indicate more clearly the differences between the 
two genera. 

Strains placed in the P. aerogenoides group showed definite 
continuity in cultural and biochemical characters. They were 
characterised by the production of a particular odour, by pecul¬ 
iar colonial variations, and by the ability to produce acetyl-

methylcarbinol in large quantities. They were also able to synthe¬ 
size a particular protein (polypeptide) material which was again 
characteristic of the group. 

Two strains § 32$ and #42533* whose biochemical reactions and 
protein metabolism patterns varied somewhat from those of the rest 
of the group, were able to produce this particular protein, although 
in reduced quantities. In general, the morphological and biochemical 
characters of these strains together with the protein metabolism 
patterns are sufficiently uniform and sufficiently distinctive to war¬ 
rant their incorporation in the species. The relative importance of 
certain characters in establishing this species pattern will be class¬ 
ified in a later serological study. The classification of the two 
M aberrant strains" # 32$ and #$2533 which are for the present tentat¬ 
ively left in this group will then be re-considered* 

The reactions of the P, coliforme group were not so clear cut, 
while the protein metabolism was similar in all strains studied, it 
was investigated, in only a? proxi ately one quarter of the strains 
used in my investigation. In biochemical reactions (Table 11), the 
variations were considerable and occasional reactions (e.g. ferment¬ 
ation of lactose) unstable. The variation in biochemical character® 
was not distinctive enough to suggest the formation of sub-groups. 

The difficulty in establishing a uniform relationship in strains 
ostensibly belonging to the F, coliforme (Borman et al) raises the 
doubt of the validity of the species. It is felt that the strains 
included in this group can be classified as members of the I ara- 
colobactrum genus but until serological or other evidence is forth-

coming, they cay not be considered as one species. 

With one exception, the v . Intermedium group showed definite 
continuity in cultural and biochemical reactions as well as in the 
. pattern of protein metabolism. As already indicated, a number of 
investigations of this grout* have been made by other workers and 
four sub-groups have been suggested. Their work, in conjunction 
with the very limited results reported her© indicate the validity 
of this group. According to the classification of Borman et al, 
the utilization of citrate is the distinguishing character of the 
group. It is felt however, that, for the time at least, this group 
should be limited to hydrogen sulphide producing and citrate posit¬ 
ive strains. According to the work of the other investigators all 
strains comprising the four groups just mentioned are producers of 
hydrogen sulphide. Strain # 123, the one citrate positive, hydro¬ 
gen sulphide negative strain which was studied in this group, was 
in most other* respects more closely related to the P, collforme 
group. Since the validity of the P, collforme species is questioned 
here, further work may indicate that before final species division 
some citrate positive strains should be included in this group. 

The results of this biochemical investigation indicate that the 
use of a ”basic” set of fermentation reactions, lactose, glucose, 
sucrose, and m&nnite, a medium for the detection of hydrogen sul- 
phide production, another for the determination of citrate utiliz¬ 
ation, as well as the simple biochemical tests for the production 
of indole and of acetylmethylcarbinol are sufficient in most cases 
to differentiate between the species.

With the following basic 24 hour biochemical reactions, abse¬ 
nce of fermentation of lactose or sucrose, acid and gas in glucose 
and mannite, no hydrogen sulphide production and a positive Voges 
Froskauer test (for acetylraethylearbinol) identifies the P. aero- 
gen oide3 group, With the same basic reactions, a positive indole 
test and failure to utilize citrate identifies 75^ of the P. coli- 
forme group. 

The identification of the P. intermedium group presents a differ¬ 
ent problem. Their close resemblance to the genus Salmonella on 
primary isolation has been already pointed out. $o definite means 
of ready differentiation has been determined. Practically two 
points were noted, however, on© was the production of a charact¬ 
eristic odour, the other was the production of an unusual amount 
of turbidity accompanied by sediment in liquid cultures. These 
characters appeared, from the very limited investigation carried 
out here, to be fairly common to the group. These two characters, 
particularly when accompanied by negative agglutination reactions 
with p lyvalent Salmonella antisera, seemed to indicate T \ Inter¬ 
medium strains. Obviously, because of the close resemblance to 
the Salmonella genus, the ’’nuisance value” at least of this species 
is very great. 

Since serological studies are often of value in the determin¬ 
ation of species, they will be considered in the following section 
before a final evaluation of Borman’s classification is made•

1. Choice of species for sr eciaj study 

The results presented in the foregoing section of this invest¬ 
igation indicate that the species P, aerogenoides possesses some 
interesting morphological and biochemical characters. It also shows 
continuity in the biochemical reactions, r , coll forme did not show 
such continuity, nor did it appear to possess any distinguishing 
morphological characters. The antigenic pattern of the species T « 
Intermedium has, as indicated on page 6 , already been studied 
in detail by a number of workers. Accordingly, ?» aerogenoides was 
the species of choice for a detailed serological study, 

2, Preliminary invest!gsation 

Before proceding with a detailed study of the somatic antigenic 
pattern, it was deemed advisable to determine the presence of the 
5i K f! antigens as described h Kauffmann (1947)* These are the so- 
called ?? envelope” antigens and the cause of ®*0 n Inagglutinability 
in many instances. An n 0 w antiserum, prepared against strain #20, 
gave strongly positive agglutinations with a living suspension of 
of the same strain. This indicated that this strain at least did 
not contain these J! K” antigens, A further group of eight somatic 
antisera were prepared and tested in the same fashion. Since there 
was still no evidence of the presence of “K” antigens, the prepar¬ 
ation of M 0” antisera was continued and the problem of K K H antigens 
was, for the time at least, not further considered.

During the course of the investigation, strain 295 be¬ 
came rough. To date all attempts to re^isolate the smooth 
form have been unsuccessful* Had this antigen remained avail¬ 
able and had antiserum from, strain #26? been available, these 
antigenic relationships rai^at have been further clarified* 

It is of interest to note that strains #2$, #lf?, #26? 
from faeces and #268 from urine were all isolated from the one 
patient at different times, while the strains #779 from faeces 
and ; ?8Q from urine, were both isolated from another patient 
from specimens collected at the same time. Of the first series 
177* #267 and ,{'268, were all from group 1 f the four somatic 
groups; #28 appeared to have a very different somatic antigenic 
composition* Of the two strains isolated from the second pat¬ 
ient, the faecal strain #779 also fell into the group 1, while 
the urinary strain #780 showed some relationship to strain #28.

one individual, it is noteworthy that in each case the same

Two feet# earn be- deduced frm the results of the so&atic a$glu- 
tlmtloa teste Just given* 

1* The somatic Antigone of Em .fflj&rogenoides are eoHg&sx .In nature. 

This is demonstrated by the fact that in a mmhm of cmm where 
absorption has oonpletely removed an antibody, the '’mirror** or 
reverse reaction has not oceursd* It is further demonstrated by 
the fact that in other cases absorption does not completely re¬ 
move tb# antibody but erely reduces its titre* 










































(45 


2. Strains isolated before and oft; r tho isolation of the invest¬ 
igated strains shew, with one exception, antigenic relationship to 
these strains studied in the investigation* 

Table If shows that the two strains #7090/51 and 162/52 (both ty¬ 
pical ?* aero£;enci'.»es ) show some somatic anti enio relationship to the 
aberrant strain #M2533* ‘*hile the antigenic connections are not 
great, this does demonstrate, in addition tc its ability to produce 
the polypeptide, a further connection of this strain #M&533 to the 
rest of the P*^p erogenoid e s group. No connections veve found between 
the somatic antigens of the strains studied and the antiserum of 
the aberrant strain 4328* 

6 * Pr eparation of flagellar antisera 

The investigation of the flagellar antigenic relationships 
was on a much smaller seal© than the investigation of the somatic 
relationships* Only 75% of the 34 strains used previously ware 
motile* Babbits became unobtainable so that antiserum production 
was severely curtailed. 

Two antisera were prepared, from strains #28 and #494* 

Tube agglutination te is wore done with antigens of all motile 
organisms and the two antisera. As befor , the titre of -11 pos¬ 
itive reactions was determined* 

7* Determ in ation cf flagell ar .a ntig e nic r ; :L ctions hirs 

The antiserum of #28 agglutinated only one anti, en, that ox 
strain #295* A titre of 1/3200 was obtained in this case and ab¬ 
sorption reduced the titre to 1/200. 

The antiserum of 494 ag lutinated strain #328 to a dilution 
of 1/400 and that of #M68G7 to a dilution of l/fCO. In neither 









(46 


case did absorption reduce the tifcre. The other antigens were 
not agglutinated by either of the two available an-1sera. 

The flagellar antigenic investigation is too limited to give 
any indication of strain relationship. Unless phase variation ex¬ 
ist s, it does suggest a type variation in M H ,f antigens within "G" 
groups, since strains 2$ and #445 identical in their somatic anti¬ 
gens, possess different flagellar components. 

The fact that the flagellar antigen of the aberrant strain 32$ 
is related to that of #494 is noteworthy* While the antigenic conn¬ 
ection is not great, this does demonstrate, in addition to its ability 
to r produce the polypeptide, a further connection of this strain #320 
to the rest of the P, aerogenoides group. 

The ability to produce the polypeptide, and the serological relat¬ 
ionships just demonstrated are sufficient to warrant maintaining the 
two aberrant strains 32$ and #M2533 in the P* aerogenoldes group.

unLor^.c^im - 

Slide agglutination tests were carried out using the three 
polyvalent P, aerogenoidcs somatic antisera prepared earlier and 
all available ', coliforme and r ’, intermedium strains. No posit¬ 
ive reactions were obtained with the P, intermedium species. Two 
strains of r, cellforme, r?09 and 724 gave positive tests, both 
with antiserum 111, These strains were tested with the individual 
members of the polyvalent antiserum and tube agglutinated to a 
titre of 1/6400 by antiserum # 530 $ and to a titre of 1/50 by anti¬ 
serum • • 533* Strain #724 was agglutinated to a titre of 1/25 by 
antiserum ;'AP113• Antiserum #M5308 was absorbed by strains P7C9 
and this procedure reduced the homologous titre to 1/400. While 
some relationship exists between the two.strains, this shows 
that the two strains are not identical. 

Flagellar agglutination tests carried out using the two anti¬ 
sera from strains 2d and #494 and broth antigens of all ; , coli- 
forme and P, Intermedium s trains were entirely negative, 

A flagellar and a somatic antiserum each prepared from strains 
;314 of the ? , intermedium grout, failed to give any positive 
agglutination with appropriate antigens of the (■ , aerogenoides species. 
The flagellar investigation was not of significant magnit¬ 
ude to determine any inter-relationships. 

The results of these tests indicate that there is no relation¬ 
ship between the P, aerogenoides strains studied and the strains of 


P, intermedium that were studied

trast to the small number with individual antisera*

Tube agglutination tests were carried out using polyvalent 
Salmonella antisera €tnd H H W antigens of the motile strains of P* 
aerogenoides . 

The polyvalent antisera included 16 individual antisera, 
again sufficient for the identification of 90 % of Salmonella strains. 

All agglutination test© were negative. 

3* Investigation of the relationships to the Shigellae 

Tube agglutination tests were done using polyvalent Shigella 
antisera* These antisera included individual antisera for 19 
Shigella strains* ‘They did not include any of the Sachs strains* 
Their composition is listed in the appendix. 

Two positive agglutinations were obtained* Strains #162 was 
agglutinated by Sh*. alkalescens to a dilution of 1/25 and strain 


AP113 was agglutinated by Sh * sonnei antiserum to a dilution of

OBSERVATIONS OF THT. SEROLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS WITHB? THE ':'ECT~:;. 

P. INTERMEDIUM 

A large proportion of the strains of >■. intermedium studied 
had originated in the same institution. The brief histories avail¬ 
able suggested that in the majority of cases, these strains were 
isolated from patients who suffered from intercurrent infections 
while hospitalised for other illnesses of prolonged duration. 

Accordingly antisera were prepared from one of these strains, 
$314. Tests were then carried out using these antisera and the 
appropriate antigens. In addition, antigens prepared from one 
strain since isolated, from the same institution, and from two 
other serum were included in the tests. Table 20 shows the 
results that were obtained using and JS 0” antisera prepared 
from strain #314*

HtELIKO ARY PI PCI) ICN OF niT. SEROLOGICAL IHVEtTIGATIOKS 

The extensive investigation of the somatic antigenic pattern 
of the I, aero^enoides species, demonstrated inter-relationships 
within the group* It also showed that the relationships to the 
other species and to the Salmonella and Shigella genera were 
minor indeed. These two observations agree with, the cultural 
and biochemical observations as well as with the observations 
on protein metabolism in demonstrating the validity of the 

species Paracolobactrum aerogenoides , 

* 

The degree of antigenic variability within the species can¬ 
not be assessed from the numbers f strains examined. However, 
it is evident that there are several comparatively large anti¬ 
genic sub-groups within the entire species, as well as some small 
sub-groups. The various unrelated strains encountered may or may 
not indicate the existence of other small groups. 

The biochemical variations within the species did not conform 
to the somatic grouping. This latter fact is not however signifi¬ 
cant in other groups. To cite only one example, the antigenic 
pattern of S, paratyphi C, two varieties of S, choierae-suls , and 
S, ty-hi-suis is almost identical, yet there is considerable 
variation in their fermentative activities. The study of aarf.no 
acid utilization as carried out by Yanda gives some strength to 
the present grou ing although ti e has not yet proven whether 
we are justified in cor elating amino acid utilization and anti¬ 
genic akeup. 

Several facts suggest that the somatic antigens are complex

in nature. Residual antibody often remained 1 ■ considerable amount 
after absorption procedures. ocripocal absorption of closely relat¬ 
ed antiser often gave ghly diver, ts. The variation in 

agglutination re ctions of strains isolated from the same individual 
at different times may be significant; it might suggest either a 
complexity of antigenic makeup with di arent factors predominating 
but it could be explained by the presence of two different strains 
in the same individual* Yet in the case of a rather uncommon org¬ 
anism, this latter possiblity would be at least unexpected. 

The results of the investigation failed to demonstrate the 
presence of any !! K tr or "envelope*' antigens. 

It is unfortunate that the flagellar investigation could not 
be more extensive. Only one fact can be deduced from the results 
obtained. Unless phase variation exists, strains identical in 
their somatic antigen are not necessarily completely alike, since 
strains 2$ and 445, identical in their somatic antigenic make¬ 
up possess different 11 H** antigens. 

The fact that P. aerogenoides shows only very minor relation¬ 
ships to the ?* californe g roup rmd the Salmonellae and Shigellas 
emphasises the validity of the species. 

While no serological investigations of the other two groups 
were carried out, sufficient serological investigation was done 
to indicate that the I. intermedium species and the indole negat¬ 
ive strains presently placed in the r; . col:; forme group have no 
major antigenic connections with the genus Salmonella .

PART FIVE 


DISCUSSI®!

DISCUSSION 

In this investigation a study was made of the morphological 
and biochemical reactions and of some of the serological relation¬ 
ships of the genus Faracolobac tram as defined by Borman, Stuart, 
and Wheeler* An attempt was made to determine the validity of the 
genus as a whole and of the species within it as suggested by the 
same authors* 

A detailed study of 7? strains and a less detailed study of 
42 additional strains apparently belonging to this genus was made* 
These strains were gram-negative, non-sparing rods wh5.ch ferment¬ 
ed glucose and man nit e with the production of acid and gas in 24 
hours* They failed to ferment salicin or inosite within the same 
time. Gelatin was in some instances liquefied but in every inst¬ 
ance this reaction was very slow* Urea was not utilized as the 
sole source of nitrogen in 4B hours* As defined by Borman et al 
the boundaries of the genus Faracolobaetrum are wide and the main 
point of differentiation fm; the Salmonella genus is the ability 
of the Earacolobactrum genus to ferment lactose slowly, While 
this difference between the two genera is not readily discernible, 
other differences became evident from the morphological and bio¬ 
chemical studies of the individual groups placed within the genus 
by the above authors. The three different groups, within the 
genus presented certain reactions characteristic of each group, 
which when combined with the general reactions just listed served 
to differentiate them from each other and from the 3aurtonella genus*

groups as determined in another investigation carried out concurr¬ 
ently with this one, showed that while there was no pattern chara¬ 
cteristic of the whole genus, patterns could be demonstrated for 
each group which were different from those of other genera studied. 

Since serological investigation of the whole genus f*ara c olo- 
bactrum was not attempted, opinions of the validity of the genus 
can be based only on biochemical and morphological studies, with 
the assistance of the studies on protein metabolism as carried 
out by Yanda. 

It is felt that sufficient evidence has been given to warrant 
t e acceptance of the validity of the Earacolobactrum genus. Fur¬ 
ther discussion will indicate that the species as defined by Borman 
et al cannot all be accepted at present. 

The group F, aerogenoides was the subject of the most exten¬ 
sive study in this investigation. From a cultural and biochemical 
viewpoint, the validity of this species has already been accepted. 
Two aberrant strains #32$ and #M2533 were tentatively placed in the 
species until serological investigations were completed. The sero¬ 
logical studies not only demonstrated much somatic inter-relation¬ 
ship within the group, but also showed only very minor connection 
to the other groups and to the genus Salmonella . Relationships 
between the two aberrant strains just mentioned and other members 
of the group were also demonstrated. These serological relation¬ 
ships confirm the validity of the genus T) ara c ol oh a. c t rum aerogenoides 

and also confirm the tentative identity of strains #328 and '2533

as members of this species.

Cn page 35 it was stated that strains included in the P, con¬ 
form© group eoula • 0 classified as members of the Paracolobactrum 
genus* It \n r else stated that the variation in their biochemical 
reactions w. r as considerable and not distinctive enough to suggest 
the formation of sub-groups. Because of the variation in biochem¬ 
ical reactions, the validity of s species Paracoioh ctr m coli 'one

ing ,f . dine© serological investigation in this regard has not been 
attempted, those strains must still be considered as 1- aracclcbactrum 
but the validity of the species P. colli orne must remain unaccepted. 

The term belliorme group n is convenient in referring tc strains not 
of the other two species and will be retained for this purpose only. 

Cn a basis of the results of this investigation and those cf 
other authors (page 36) the species ?. intermedium was accepted 
on biochemical grounds, with the reservation that only hydrogen 
sulphide positive, citrate positive strains be included. Since 
• gain, the serological investigation was insufficient, the accep¬ 
tance c-f the validity cf this species must remain on biochemical grounds 
alone. 

The results of the biochemical section of this investigation 
indicate the resemblance between the reactions of tf genus Salmon¬ 
ella find the genus Para colobactrum and thus indicate the need for 
simple and rapid methods of distinguishing between the two genera. 

Ho single test can be accepted ss a valid differential point 
but the use of a ’’basic” set of biochemical reactions seems to 
distinguish adequately the great majority of strains and in doubt-

V-lrnonells antiser^ vd.ll provide oonfirmatery positive or negat¬

The biochemical reactions, in most instances, differentiate, 
not only between the two genera, but also between the species of 
ar •colobactrum Fermentation of glucose and mannite with acid 
and gas, while lactose and sucrose remain unaffected, and the prod¬ 
uction of acetymethylcarbinol identifies the species r '. aero gen- 
older. r ith similiar fermentation reactions, the production of 
indols, associated with the inability to form aaetylmethylcarbinol 
identifies 757- of the f . coliforme group • \ . i nter.nedium strains 

are not so easily distinguished, While numerically they are not 
important, their close resemblance to the Salmonella© gives them a 
’’nuisance value” of so 2 ;e magnitude. Tv@m the results of this Unit¬ 
ed investigation, points of practical importance are the production 
of the typical odour, associated with unusually turbid broth cult¬ 
ures and negative agglutination with oolr; 1 .Vie :.r.t$mt . 

All these suggest the identification of T. intermedium . This is 
usually confirmed by fomentation of lactose in from three to ten days. 

Mention of the results of an investigation of the protein met¬ 
abolism of the genus "aracolobactrum as determined by "paper chromato¬ 
graphic" methods has been included* It helps to confirm the validity of 
the species F. aerogenoides , and shows sane agreement with the somatic 
antigenic pattern of this sped :.,. Results of similar metabolic invest¬ 
igation of the other two species within the genus Par: colobactrum sugg¬ 
ested the validity of these two species also but they were based on

2* A "basic* set of bi oetiessic&l reactions serves to differ- 













(63 


entiate all of the P. aeromeno5.dps and 75? of the strains of the 
so-called P. collforme group from the °almoneIla genus. It is 
not sufficient to permit immediate differentiation of the species 
P. Intermedium frc the genus Salmonella . The production of a 
characteristic odour and an unusual amount of turbidity in broth 
cultures were of some assistance in differentiating between these 
two latter grour-s. 

3a. Serological investigation carried out indicated much re¬ 
lationship of somatic antigenic factors within the species P. aero- 

genoides . Evidence was presented to indicate the complexity of 

- 

these antigens and a possible co-relation between the somatic anti¬ 
gens and the amino acid utilisation of certain strains was sugges¬ 
ted. Investigation of the flagellar antigenic makeup was limited 
and sufficiently only to indicate considerable heterogenietv. 

No evidence was found to indicate the presence of the antigens 
of Kauffmann* No major antigenic relationships to other members 
of the genus Paracolobactrum nor to the Salmonella or Shigella 
genera were demonstrated. 

3b. Detailed investigations of the antigenic makeup of the 
P. Int ermedium species and the P. coll forme group was not attem¬ 
pted. No evidence of serological relationship was found, however, 
between the genus Salmonella and either the species '. intermedium 
or the indole negative strains of the P. coliforme group.'
