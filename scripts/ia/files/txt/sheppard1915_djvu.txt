UNIVERSITY OP ALBERTA 


FACULTY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 


The undersigned hereby certify that 
they have read and recommend to the Faculty 
Council for acceptance a dissertation on 
"The Radial Velocities of Stars" submitted 
by Ross Stanley Sheppard, B.A., in partial 
fulfilment of the requirements for the degree 
of M.A. 


Edmonton, 
April, 1915. 













RADIAL VELOCITIES 


The velocity of a star may be resolved into two 
component velocities,one measured along the line 
(called the line of sight) drawn from the star to the 
observer and the other at right angles to this line. 

The former component is known as the star T s TT Radial 
Velocity." This paper outlines the method I used at the 
Lick Observatory under the direction of Dr. W. W. 
Campbell, to deduce these radial velocities , and some 
of the measurements I made. 

APPARATUS. 

This work is carried on with the 36 inch refracting 
telescope having a correcting lens which corrects for 

halving a- 

chromatic aberration and A spectrograph attached to its 
eye end. 

Three main features of the spectrograph are: 

1. Collimator. 

E. A prism box containing three dense glass prisms. 
3. A camera tube. 

The light from a star having passed through the 
lenses of the telescope falls on a slit in the upper end 
of the collimator. The slit is varied in size 
depending upon the brightness of the object that is 
being observed, but is usually about l/40 mm. wide and 
a/2 mm. long.

Before 1900 the slit used was straight and hence the 
lines in the spectrum were curved and hence a curvature 
correction had to he applied. Since then a curved slit 
has be$n used which makes the spectral lines straight 
and thus the curvature is eliminated* To he 
absolutely accurate I should say the curvature of the 
slit is computed to give straight lines in the middle of 
the photographed spectrum. To the red of the middle the 
stellar and comparison lines will he slightly concave 
toward the red, and to the violet of the middle the lines 
will he slightly concave toxvard the violet. The 
departure from straight lines in the regions of good 
definition are so slight that no difficulty is 
exporiended in the measurements and the slight curvature 
errors in the two directions will usually balance. 

This slit is placed exactly in the focus of the 
lenses of the telescope and the combined instrument is 
moved by clockwork in such a manner that during the. 
entire exposure the image will constantly fall on the 
slit. (The observer has to watch the position of the 
image through a small guiding telescope and adjust the 
position of the telescope by means of small cranks so 
that the image falls upon the slit.) After passing 
through the slit the ra.ys diverge until they enter a 
small lens at the lower end of the collimator which

renders them parallel. This beam then falls upon the 
three prisms which separate its rays forming the Star's 
spectrum. This spectrum falls on a photographic plate 
in the camera tube. 

At the same time that the star spectrum is being 
photographed, two other spectra (comparison spectra) 
are also photographed on the same plate but to the sides 
of the star spectrum. This is accomplished by having 
two electrodes (iron, titanium or some metal) at each 
side of the slit and about a millimeter apart so that 
an arc can be formed between them. By means of a total 
reflection prism this light is reflected through the 

in 

slit and passes through the prisms and is deviated A the 
same^as^the light from the star. This light forms the 
spark spectrum of the elements in the electrodes and 
since the burning metal is neither approachingnor 
receding from the instrument its characteristic lines 
should occupy their norms! or zero velocity positions. 
These comparison spectra are photographed at different 
intervals throughout the exposure so that an^ 
temperature change weald effect the star and comparison 
spectra alike, 

In order to make certain that the temperature 
■effect (a change in temperature changes the index of 
refraction ox the prisms and hence changes the position 





( 4 ) 


of the lines in the spectrum) Ls as small as possible, 
the entire spectrograph ls enclosed in a tight-fitting 
box lined with thick felt on whose inner surfaces 
resistance wires are placed. As shown in the 
photograph these resistance wires are connected to a 
thermometer mounted inside the case. About an hour 
before the observation is to be made this heating case 
(as the felt lined box is called) is put around the 
spectrograph and the temperature of the air in the case 
raised to that selected for the night’s work, wnich is 
about one degree higher than the outside atmosphere. 

The current is then stopped by just breaking the 
mercury connection in the ther .mometer. The current is 
then automatically regulated by the ther mometer. 

Owing to the focal length of the telescope changing with 
change of temperature the focus of the spectrometer is 
set every day that it is used, according to a scale wnich 
has been obtained experimentally . There is an electric 

i 

fan in the box which is turned on ocasionaily during the 
night to insure no stratification of the air. 

nearly all the spectra are obtained with the three- 
prism spectrograph as outlined above, but for certain 
stars a one-prism spectrograph is used. When light 
passes through three prisms its spectrum is broadened 
more than if it passes through one prism of the same kind ; 












and at the same time its intensity is much less. Hence 
if we are observing bright objects, for example: stars 
of the lower magnitudes, we use the three prism 
spectrograph, whereas tor very faint objects, for example 
comets, nebulae and stars of higher magnitudes we use the 
one prism. 

In the spectrum of any metal some lines are more 
intense than others. In order to have the lines in the 
comparison spectra as uniform as possible a slide with 
indentations is put in front of the 

photographic plate during part of the time that the 
spark spectra are being secured. These projections on 
the slide are placed in the position that the brighter 
lines in the spectrum would fall. Hence when the slide 
is inserted these bright lines fall on the slide instead 
of the pnotographic plate. 

The photographs show the spectrograph attached to the 
telescope with every thing ready for observations to be 
made. The path of the light and the working of the 
various parts can be probably more easily followed irom 
the following diagram.

THEORY. 


According to Doppler's Principle, the motion of a 
star towards the observer or from the observer is 
indicated by a displacement ox the lines in its spectrum 
from their normal positions; towards the red end if the 
star is receding from him, towards the violet end if it 
is approaching him.

~y\ z number of waves received by observer in a 
mean solar second , 


z changed values of A and n resulting from a 


velocity of the light source amounting to 
±Y Kin per second. 


# Theoretically it makes a slight difference whether 
the light source or the observer is moving, but 
practically the difference is negligible. 

Taking velocity of light as 299^860 Km per second, 
we would have ri waves in a space 299 / 860±Y Km depending 
upon whether the source is approaching or receding from 
the observer.

i. e. A change AX corresponds to a relative recession or 
approach of ± Y Km per second and equals the normal value 
of the wavelength multiplied by the ratio of the relative 
velocity of the scource and observer to the velocity of 
light. 

Hence to get the velocity Y. of a star, necessary to 
change the apparent wavelength by 1 Angstr'om unit, we let

i. e. A velocity Y of approach or recession will change

Hence conversely we have the method to deduce the radial 
velocity which will produce an apparent change in the 
wavelength. This is done by measuring the displacement 
IA % which is usually done by the micrometer and the result 
is expressed in terms of one revolution v of the micrometer 
screw. Equation (2) is now written;

place of the indices of refraction we may use the 
angular deviation as given hy the prism or (what we use 
in practice) the linear distance between the lines on the 
photographed spectrum, by means of a microscope. 

Hence our formula may he written

where n is the reading of the lines on the 
linear scale defined hy the micrometer. 

How taking any three %'s make the readings. 

These readings give us three equations of form (1) 
which enable us to deduce the constants. Hence knowing 
| the constants and the wavelength of the line we are to 
measure, we can deduce what its linear reading on the 
microscope should he if it was not displaced hy any

Take a fine grained plate and secure a good 








spectrogram of the sun. Place this spectrogram on the 
micrometer and starting at any known line note the 
micrometer reading of that line, lake another good line 
whose wavelight is known, and note its micrometer reading. 
Repeat with another line. (These lines should not cover 
too large a range on the spectrum.) 

: T_jp_ mea su re \ 

The part of the spectrum measured is immaterial, 
provided the lines in the part measured are distinct. 

In the case of G and K type stars the part used (afterl900) 
Is chiefly from 4395 A to 4600 A, while for A and F 
type stars the chief lines are 4481 A, 4549 A, and 4552 
A. The spectrogram is placed on the micrometer in such 
a position that the comparison line, say 4595, has 
about the same reading as.the position it should have, 
deduced theoretically as above. (Before starting a 
measurement, care should be taken that the illumination 
should be as uniform as possible. ) The reading which the 
comparison and star lines have are now noted. When the 
lines have been measured going one way the plate is 
reversed and the same lines are measured coming back 
thereby increasing the accuracy in a two-fold way, 

(1) Doubling the measurements, 

(2) Any personal equation which may arise in 
the measurement of the line is neutralized by measuring

|it coming from the opposite way. A carve is now drawn 
as indicated from which we get the position (micrometer 
readings) which comparison lines or lines of zero velocity 
would have if there were such lines having the 
wavelengths given in the first column. 

Then the micrometer readings on the star minus those 
on tne zero or comparison lines are the observed 
displacements) Uthis displacement is expressed in 
fractions of one revolution. 

Method of Reduction of a Spectrugr am, 

The enclosed measurements indicate clearly the method 
of deducing the radial velocity of a star from the 
! spectrogram. 

fl) The first column contains the wavelengths of all 
lines (stellar and comparison) that were measured. 

(2) The second column contains the micrometer 
readings for these lines as given in a reduction table, 
deduced as indicated above. 

(5) The third column contains the micrometer 
readings on the star lines. 

(4) The fourth column gives the micrometer readings 
on the comparison lines. 

(5) The fifth column contains the micrometer 
readings which lines of zero velocity would have if there 
were such lines having the wavelength given in the first 
column.

(6) The sixth column contains the displacements due 
to the motion of source of light. 

(7) The seventh column contains the value y\I, or as 

it is usually written vV 6 .— see (3) 

(8) The eighth column contains the velocities of the 
star as obtained from the measurments on the various 
lines. (Equation 3 .) 

The average of these measured velocities is taken as 
the observed velocity of the star. 

This observed velocity is due both to the motion of 

. 

the star and of the observer. The latter is made up of 
four components ail of which must be eliminated from the 
observation before the component of the star’s velocity 
with reference to the sidereal system can be determined. 
The four components arise from: 

1. The rotation of the earth on its axis. 

£. The revolution of the earth about the common Centre 
of Gravity of the earth and moon. 

5. The revolution of the earth about the sun. 

4. Motion of the Solar system as a whole. 

At present the direction and velocity ox this (*t) 
component are not definitely known. Different observers 
have obtained different results as indicated in the 
following table.

From the above table, Campbell’s results taking 1047 
stars may be at least considered quite near the correct 
values. 

When the corrections for the first three motions are 
applied the observations are said to be reduced to the sun.

These corrections are worked out by logarithms and 
tabulated so that in deducing the velocity of a star 
they are obtained by referring to some table. 

The results given below illustrate the measurements 
and reduction necessary to deduce the Radial Velocity 
of any star. 

Spectrograms of over seventeen hundred stars were 
jtaken, and their radial velocities deduced by the method 
indicated above; some of these mlate.s were moor so that 
very little weight could be given their measurement. 

The velocities of,ten hundred and forty seven- of the 
mlates whose linns were better defined we re taken and 
used in forming ten hundred and forty seven ec;nations

Similar results were obtained by grouping the ten 
hundred and forty seven stars into one hundred and seven 
two groups each group having a, lit■le over six stars 
on the average. flee average velocity of the stars in 
any group was talien as the velocity of that group and,:
