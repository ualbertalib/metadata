INTRODUCTION 

Mature reading is dependent on several 
factors lack of facility in any one of which is a 
serious handicap for the student# No one will 
question that the mature reader has a more rapid 
reading rate than the immature one# This Is so be- 
cause he has greater ability in word recognition, 
a greater span of recognition, fewer regressive 
eye movements, shorter periods of fixation, and 
finally, greater ability in recognizing the 
meanings of words* Although the mature reader 
has attained a high degree of mastery in all of 
these, he frequently does not progress uniformly 
in the various habits# The rate and order of 
development of the reading habits depend to a great 
extent on the method of teaching employed# There 
is no doubt that some methods of teaching are more 
efficient and economical than others* This leads 
one to ask: What methods will ultimately be most 
desirable for the proper developmental progress 
in reading. Buswell (1 - p#10) enumerates the 










2 


following aspects or elements of the reading pro¬ 
cess and its development: 

*1. The development of a broad recognition 
unit, as measured by the average scop© of 
eye-fixations» 

2„ The development of habits of quick 
recognition, regardless of the size of the 
unit, as measured by the duration of 
fixation pauses. 

5. The development of precision of recog¬ 
nition and regularity of progress across 
printed lines, as measured inversely by 
regressive, or backward ©ye movements* 

4* The development of habits of expression 
or recognition in terms of thought units, 
as measured, for the oral process, by 
timing rhythm of pronunciation* 

5* The development of independence in 
word recognition*" 

The purpose of this study is to determine 
the effects of a particular teaching technique on 
the reading rate and comprehension of students in 
the elementary school©

CHAPTER I 

THE HISTORY AND NATURE OP THE PROBLEM 

Much research has been done in reading* 
All authorities are agreed as to what constitutes 
good reading, and have now established reading 
norms for the various ages and grades* However, 
there Is no reason to believe that good as well 
as poor readers cannot improve. Therefore, it 
may become necessary, at some future time, to 
revise, in an upward direction, the reading norms 
we now have. Difference of opinion exists, not 
as to what elements are concomitant with good 
reading, but over what techniques and methods of 
teaching reading will bring about the best results® 
In order words, which methods are most economical 
and efficient? 

The greatest amount of research in 
reading has been done in the field of remedial 
reading. Many theories for improving the back¬ 
ward student have been put forward and have been 
used with greater or less success depending on

the particular situation and circumstances 
surrounding the individual case. It seems reason¬ 
able to suppose that many of these "cases’ 1 for 
remedial treatment would have been better readers 
had a better method of teaching been employed* 
Nevertheless, because of individual differences, 
there will always be some readers who are poorer 
than others, and, in consequence, there will always 
be a need for remedial teaching. 

"Two notable results of the studies prior 
to 1910 form the basis of present-day reforms in 
teaching reading; namely, the clear-cut distinction 
between oral reading and silent reading and the 
recognition of individual differences in reading 
habits and needs." (2 - p.892) The distinction 
between oral and silent reading revolutionized the 
methods of teaching reading in use up to that 
time, while the recognition of individual differences 
made authorities wary in suggesting any general 
panacea or cure-all for reading ills. It is 
necessary, then, to treat silent and oral reading 
as separate entities and to devise general methods

for teaching them* remembering, at the same time, 
that all students cannot be made to conform to any 
one general teaching technique, but rather, that 
the teaching technique must be made to conform to 
the need of the individual. When viewed in this 
light the problem of teaching reading becomes very 
complex and intricate indeed. 

Should the span of perception not be 
great enough, definite steps must be taken to 
bring about an increase in it. The scientific 
method of attack is not to apply more and more of 
the usual reading, but to devise a direct and 
positive approach. "One type of remedy, which has 
frequently been tried in reading, is the use of 
short-exposure exercises. Where this method has 
been applied at the proper stage of development 
improvement has usually occurred." (1 - p. 139) 
However, one must remember that rapid recognition 
and a large span of recognition are not the only 
elements in the reading process. Some pupils 
require training in these skills while others 
require training in the experiences which will

' " •' ' .. 





























6 


supply the ideas necessary to facilitate inter¬ 
pretation* The main thing to remember is that a 
slow rate of reading shows that the pupil f s 
equipment is in some respect incomplete* 

A controversy exists as to whether 
mechanical devices have justified themselves as 
being practical in the field of reading. Some 
authorities doubt if the special training so pro¬ 
vided is of any value. Traxler (3 - p.149) says 
that "on the whole, both expert opinion and the 
results of research have been somewhat unfavorable 
to the use of expensive gadgets* M Other authorities 
are equally certain that such devices are bene¬ 
ficial* For example, Taylor (4 - p.151) states 
that "controlled reading with the Metron-O-Scope 
combines all the ideas underlying (1) short 
exposure as a means of broadening the span of 
recognition and reducing the reaction time, and 
(2) classroom methods for conditioning an efficient 
eye habit in reading*" It would appear that 
scientific study should be able to throw light 
on the controversy and assist in deciding in 








- 7 - 


favor of one of the two divergent views or perhaps 
in establishing the truth of each depending on the 
conditions and circumstances surrounding the 
individual situation# 

The purpose of the present study is to 
discover if there is a significant increase in 
reading rate and in reading comprehension among 
children in the elementary school as a result of 
drill in perception carried on by mechanical 
means. The assumption underlying this experiment 
is that any change in the reading ability of the 
experimental group as compared with the control 
group is the result of the mechanical drill 
carried on since all other factors which influence 
the two groups are constant.

CHAPTER II 

APPARATUS AND PROCEDURE 

The appartus used in this study is shown 
in Plates I and II and was determined partly by 
expediency and partly by the desire for simplicity. 
The various parts are numbered on the plates. 

They consist of (7) an epidiascope or opaque 
projector, (3) a translucent screen, (1) and (8) 
a system of pulleys, and (2) gummed tape. A 
timing device (6) was fitted to the lens of the 
projector which allowed exposures to be timed 
at intervals of from one seeond to one one-hundredth 
of a second. The opaque projector was used be¬ 
cause it was the only one available. Its use, 
along with that of a translucent screen, 
necessitated the devising of a system of pulleys 
so that the "film-strip' 1 could be pulled through 
the projector from the opposite side of the screen. 
The shutter on the timing device was opened by 
means of a string used as a trip rope. The gummed 
paper together with the perception units made 
up the "film-strip”. 


It is felt that the apparatus

is simple enough to be duplicated wherever a 
projector is available• 

Vocabulary for the drill was obtained 
from the readers in actual use in the classrooms. 
The two, three, and four-word units were, for the 
most part, combinations of the single-word units. 
Lists of the perception units appear in the 
appendix. The word units were typed on white 
paper and attached to the gummed strip at regularly 
spaced intervals. Thus the gummed roll became a 
sort of film-strip. 

The method used in the study consisted, 
essentially, of timed exposures of perception 
units, flashed on the screen, which the subject 
repeated on recognition. Subjects were brought 
into the laboratory singly and given drill be¬ 
ginning with the single word units. Then the 
unit span was progressively increased to two, 
three, and finally four words. At each change 
in the perception span the subject started with 
the shortest exposure time at which he was able 
to recognize the units, and speeded up to one

one-hundredth of a second* 

Accurate records of each subject’s pro¬ 
gress from unit to unit were kept in detail* A 
diagrammatic sketch of these records appears below* 
Each error which the subject made was indicated by 
a check-mark in the proper Tt time-column” opposite 
the appropriate perception unit.

Subjects for the experiment were selected 

from the elementary grades of University 

Demonstration School* Pupils in grades 2, 3, 4, 

5,and 6 were used. The subjects were selected in 

have 

such a way that it was possible to/a n control ff for 
each student used in the experiment, that is, they 
were selected in pairs. The pairing was done on 
the basis of chronological age, I. Q., and 
ability in silent reading as indicated by the 
Stanford Achievement Test in grades 2 and 3, and 
the Nelson Silent Reading Test in grades, 4, 5, 
and 6* In this way, the twenty subjects (four 
from each grade) used in the experiment each had 
a "control* 1 in his class who received exactly the 
same instruction except for the experimental 
drill. The students were also given Gray’s Oral 
Reading Test but were not paired in this respect. 

Each subject in the experimental group 
was drilled at regular intervals and the total 
drilling time amounted to three and one-half 
hours. At the end of the drill period, the

Table V shows the initial and final 
scores of the experimental and control groups 
in Reading Rate* The tests used in grades 2 
and 3 were the Stanford Achievement Tests; 
those used in grades 4, 5, and 6 were the 
Nelson Silent Reading Test* In both cases the 
initial and final tests were equivalent forms 
of the same test* The score, in this case, 
refers to the reading rate in terms of the 
number of paragraphs completed in the allowed 
time, twenty minutes* The final column re¬ 
presents the gain of the individual student 
in the experimental group over that of his 
control* A negative quantity indicates that 
the control had a greater gain than the 
experimental subject*

CHAPTER IV 

REACTION OP INDIVIDUALS OP EXPERIMENTAL GROUP 
TO THE DRILL PROCEDURE 

The following chapter is a brief capi¬ 
tulation of the more significant reactions of 
the individual subjects in the experimental 
group• 

Subject tt 2A tt 

This student was started on the first 
series of fifteen words at the rate of one-fifth 
of a second. Similarly with the second and third 
series. On her first ft run fr through the forty- 
five words she made twenty-five errors, but by 
the third drill period she got them all correct. 
She was started on the fourth group of fifteen 
words at one-tenth of a second and on the final 
group at one-fiftieth of a second. She started 
the two-word units at one-twenty-fifth of a 
second, the three-word units at one-fiftieth of 
a second and the four-word units at one-twenty- 
fifth of a second. In every case she progressed

successively through the intermediate stages up to 
one one-hundredth of a second* 

Before the beginning of the drill period 
this girl became emotionally distraught when faced 
with an oral reading situation. Her home-room 
teacher feels that she now has a better method of 
attack as a result of the perception drills and 
that she is not so nervous when in a reading 
situation as she was formerly. 

This student shows a gain over her 
control on every graph® 

Subject n 2B w 

This subject shows a gain on every 
graph, far greater than her twin in the control 
group. 

Subject "2C n 

This student shows a gain on ©very 
graph, far greater than her twin in the control 
group. 

Subject tf 2D n 


This student was also a very emotional 
one. She was started on the single word units at

one-half second. With her as with subject "2A" 
the nervousness was largely dispelled during the 
period of time during which the drill was carried 
on. She is now able to read orally with greater 
ease than was formerly the case. Her graph on 
oral reading shows considerable increase in this 
skill. 

Subject w 5A ft 

This student shows considerable gain 
over his control in the Paragraph Comprehension 
test and in the number of items completed. 
SubjectJ^B" 

This student also showed considerable 
gain over his control in the Comprehension test 
and in reading rate. 

Subject »5C n 

This students gain is not equal to 
that of her control on the Paragraph Comprehension 
test or in rate but exceeds that of her control 
on Gray’s Oral Reading Test* 

Subject n 3D u 


This subject shows a loss in comparison 

















- 44 


with her control on each one of the tests. 

Subject t1 4A tl 

This subject shows an increase over her 
control in every case. 

Subject 11 4 B 11 

This subject had difficulty with the 
three and four-word units. She had to go over 
these more often than the others in her class. 
Although she shows a gain in every case it is 
less than that of her control in the Paragraph 
Comprehension Test and only equal to the gain 
of the control on the other two tests. The 
possibility exists that more drill would have 
increased her eye-span and thus her score. 

Subject ”40 ” 

This subject shows a gain over her 
control in rate but a loss as compared with the 
control in both the Paragraph Comprehension 
Test and in Gray’s Oral Reading Test. There is 
a possibility that had the drill been of a 
meaningful nature her score would have been 
higher.

Subject ”4D U 

This subject missed a considerable part 
of the drill period. Thus, though she received 
the same amount of drill as the others, it was 
not given at the same regular intervals. She 
is equal to her control in rate and in Gray ’ s 
Oral Reading Test and surpasses the gain of her 
control on the Comprehension Test# 

Subject n 5A” 

This pupil was one of the poorer ones 
dealt with in the study. He started the first 
and second series of fifteen single word units 
at one second. His vocabulary was poor and 
consequently he had to be taught a considerable 
number of words. However, after having learned 
the words and getting the single word units at 
one one-hundredth of a second he showed an 
amazing development and finished the drill period 
on the same material as his class-mates. He 
shows an increase over his twin in the control 
group on the Paragraph Comprehension Test and 
on Gray’s Oral Reading Test but his increase in

in rate is not so large as that of his control. 
Subject ft 5B tf 

This student had considerable difficulty 
in getting the three-word units* An interesting 
fact is that after laboriously going through the 
three-word units on a Friday, she was tentatively 
tried on the four-word units on the following 
Monday and succeeded very well* Her increase 
or gain is greater than her control in rate, equal 
to that of her control in Comprehension and less 
than that of her control in Gray’s Oral Heading 
Test. 

Subject tf 5G n 

This student missed a considerable part 
of the drill period. She received the same 
amount of drill as the other subjects but the 
drill periods were crowded together rather than 
being at regularly spaced intervals. Her graphs 
show a greater increase than her control on 
Gray’s Oral Reading Test but less increase in 
Comprehension and rate. 






47 


Subject "5D " 

The increase of this subject is equal 
to that of her twin in rate but less in compre¬ 
hension and less on Gray’s Oral Reading Test. 
Subject n 6A !t 

This subject could not get the three- 
word units at one one-hundredth of a second. 

He did not get to the four-word units at all. 

In order to check all possibilities the school 
nurse tested his eyes and found his vision to 
be normal. The only test on which he shows a 
gain was Gray’s Oral Reading Test but even here 
his gain is not equal to that of his control. 
Subject ”6B n 

The gain of this subject exceeds that 
of her control on Gray’s Oral Reading Test and 
in rate but is less than that of her twin on the 
Paragraph Comprehension Test. 

Subject n 6C ft 

This was another of the poorer students 
in the experimental group. He showed a great 
deal of Interest in improving his reading ability.

His graphs show considerable gain over that of 
his twin in Paragraph Comprehension and in rate 
but less than his twin on Gray T s Oral Reading 
Test* 

Subject ri 6D rc 

This student shows an increase greater 
than that of his control in every case©

CHAPTER V 
CONCLUSION 

A statistical treatment of the results 
obtained by the individual classes of the ex¬ 
perimental group was impractical in that the 
number in each was too small. There were only 
four subjects In each class and, therefore, 
the grades had to be combined to make a more 
valid basis for study. The scores of Grades 
2 and 3 were combined to determine the first 
critical ratio and for each subsequent ratio 
the scores of another grade were added. In 
this manner progressively larger N J s were ob¬ 
tained with a resultant increase in the 
reliability of the critical ratios* 

Table VII gives a summary of the final 
test data from which the Critical Ratios were 
determined* n Aggregate Scores” refers to 
the summation of \/c&4haloty Scores and Compre¬ 
hension Scores for each of the Experimental 
and Control groups*

The 0.Q5 level of significance suggested 
above means that the chances are only 5 in 100 or 1 
in 20 that the obtained differences in scores be¬ 
tween the control and experimental groups were due 
either to sampling errors or individual differences* 
This gives a great deal of confidence in scores 
which attain this level. Although many of the 
ratios do not achieve Fisher 1 a level of signi¬ 
ficance they approach it and are indicative of 
a probable trend. Furthermore, many educational 
authorities feel that in dealing with subjective 
material of this nature the arbitrary levels of 
significance established by Fisher, for concrete 
and objective data, are much too restrictive© 

However, the use of total scores obtained 
by the summation of paragraph comprehension and 
vocabulary scores, as was done in Table VII, 
obscures some rather interesting facts. For 
this reason each set of scores has been summarized 
individually and the critical ratios shown in the 
following tables©

It can b© seen from Tables IX and X 
that in grades 2 and 5 the increase in paragraph 
comprehension scores results in a critical ratio 
of 1.87 which almost equals the Fisher level. 

The summations grades 2, 3, and 4 on the same 
item results in a ratio of 1.96 which consider¬ 
ably exceeds the requirements for significance. 

It is quite evident, therefore, that the two 
| grades most affected by the drill in paragraph 
comprehension were grades 2 and 4. 

Tables XI and XII show up a rather 
startling result of the drill. The higher grades 
seemed to have made a good deal of improvement 
in their vocabulary scores. Why this should be 
is difficult to say since the drill on per- 

j 

ception made no effort to stress vocabulary. 

The number of words used was hardly large enough 
to cause any appreciable growth in vocabulary. 

Finally, then, the perception drill 
definitely did result in an increase in reading 
rate and comprehension. According to statistical

theory the increase was not great enough to rule 
out the element of pure chance entirely but for 
practical purposes it can be assumed that the 
increase is significanto

CHAPTER VI 

IMPLICATIONS, CRITICISMS, AND SUGGESTIONS 


It is not possible to accept the results 
in any experimental study without further ex¬ 
perimentation to verify or discredit the findings® 
However, in such experimentation it 'would seem 
logical to follow whatever leads the present 
study seems to indicate. Some of the leads are 
as follows: 

1® Pupils In Grades II and IV showed 
greatest improvement® 

2. Pupils in lower grades generally 
showed more improvement than those 
in higher grades® 

3® Poorer students of any grade showed 
more relative improvement than those 
who were better at the beginning. 

4. Pupil reaction to the drilling pro¬ 
cedure suggests that such drill may 
be a valuable aid In building 
vocabulary. 

It Is not in the nature of this study to explain 
the ?hy or wherefore of the above. Should these 
leads be found to be intrinsic In other studies 
of a similar nature there is no doubt that they 





,

57 


can b© accounted for by definite psychological 
principles. 

It is possible to make many criticisms of 
the present study* These criticisms along with 
suggestions as to their remedy may be of aid in 
the preparation of further experimental designs. 

1. A projector using a reflecting rather 
than a translucent screen would give 
better, clearer cut outlines of the 
perception units. 

2. In connection with the above it would 
appear that a white t, film-strIp ,, 
rather than brown would give the 
perception units a better background. 

3. Some mechanical device should be 
constructed so that each time a per¬ 
ception unit is in the projector it 
will be projected onto the screen in 
precisely the same spot. 

4. There is the possibility that the 
senior students generally and the 
better students particularly were not 
subjected to perception units of large 
enough span or perhaps the limitation 
of the timing device did not allow 
them the increase in rate of which 
they were capable. Either of these 
possibilities would explain why such 
students did not show "the same 
relative increase as the junior and 
poorer students.

5. There should be a way to measure 
"rate of perception" and "span of 
recognition" directly rather than 
indirectly as was done in this study* 

For example, it would be interesting 
to determine the eye-span of the 
subjects at the beginning and again 
at the end of the experiment* It is 
only by so doing that anything could 
be determined in connection with the 
eye-span. 

6* Possibly the students should have 
been paired as to rate on the 
Paragraph Test rather than on total 
score* 

7. More definitely, they should have 
been paired on the basis of scores 
on the Paragraph Comprehension Test 
rather than on the Paragraph and 
Vocabulary Tests combined because this 
study should not have any effect on 
vocabulary* 

8* The possibility exists that the 

students should have been paired as 
to socio-economic status as there 
is no doubt this is an important 
factor in vocabulary development 
and thus in comprehension. 

9. Sex differences were not taken into 
consideration in the present study. 

10. It is a definite psychological 

principle that drill with meaning 
is far more valuable than purely 
mechanical drill* 

Therefore, It is suggested that the labora¬ 
tory set-up should not be entirely divorced from 





'

the classroom situation but rather that the drill 
carried on In the laboratory be given the meaning 
it should have and thus be fitted into a definite 
learning situation. Mechanical drill has shown 
Itself to be partially successful; meaningful 
drill should be far more successful.
