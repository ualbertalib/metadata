Vapor-liquid Equilibria in Hydrocarbon Systems 


Introduction 

The study of vapor-liquid equilibria in hydrocarbon 
systems, under high pressure, is of great importance both 
from a theoretical and a practical point of view. Until 
recent years (1930 on), little work had been done on the 
solubilities of gases at high pressures except for such 
gases as nitrogen, o:. 3 g , hydrogen and carbon dioxide. 

The publication of a report on TT The Function of 
Natural Gas in the Production of Oil” by Miller (£ 6 ), 
seems to mark the beginning of a period of intensive study 
of vapor-liquid equilibria at high pressures in hydro¬ 
carbon systems. 

The report draws attention to the great importance 
of conservation of gas in the production of oil* The 
following points are shown to be of importance. 

Gases dissolved in the crude petroleum, in under¬ 
ground formations, form the chief expulsive force in most 
oil fields. 

B. The amount of gas dissolved in crude oil appears 
to be in direct proportion to the pressure. 

0. The dissolved gases reduce both the viscosity and 
surface tension of the crude oil in proportion to the

amount and nature of the gas dissolved. Such a reduction* 
in viscosity and surface tension* makes it easier for the 
oil to drain through the sands. It is evident that it is 
desirable not to waste natural gas occurring in.petroleum 
servoirs if the maximum production of crude oil* at min¬ 
imum cost, is to be obtained. 

The report definitely shows that, where gas is us 
efficiently, the wells have a longer period of flowing 
life and a more economical production. 

At the time of this report (1929) relatively little 
data on the solubility of natural gases in crude oils and 
the physical properties of such systems was available. 

Such information is of importance in the study of the 
mechanics of processes occurring in oil formations and 
estimation of oil reserves. 

The study of vapor-liquid equilibria in hydrocarbon 
systems is also of importance to i n dustry. In: , 

particularly in the chemical industries and petroleum 
refining, the trend has been towards the application of 
higher operating pressures. In the design of equipment for 
such processes, a knowledge of the solubilities of gases 
in liquids, at pressures above those for which data exists, 
has been found necessary. This is due to the fact that 
under high pressures ( 40 to 50 atmospheres and more) the 











behavior of gases, and particularly of hydrocarbon gases, 
deviates greatly from the ideal gas law and simple modi¬ 
fications of it. 

Examples of processes for which such data might be 
necessary are: 

(1) The separation of gases by preferential solution 
in a suitable scrubber liquid. 

(2) Condensation of vapors in the presence of a 
non-condensable gas. 

(5) Rate of chemical reaction may be controlled by the 
solubility of a gas. 

A theory, based on thermodynamics, has been formulated 
for the explanation of the vapor-liquid equilibria of hydro¬ 
carbon systems but insufficient experimental data for a 
test of the theory has as yet been obtained. 

The study of vapor-liquid equilibria in hydrocarbon 
systems'in this laboratory, was undertaken with the view of 
its application to the Turner Valley oil field and also to 
obtain data to test the theory mentioned above. The work 
in this laboratory was started in 1932 by Argue (2) and 
continued from 1934 to 1936 by Johnson f18). The lack of 
data, on the vapor-liquid equilibria of simple hydrocarbon 
systems, made it necessary to study such systems before the 
study of complex systems found in oil horizons could be 









undertaken. Two component systems or at the most, three 
component systems, were studied under equilibrium condi¬ 
tions up to the critical pressure of complete miscib¬ 
ility of components (where possible). 

This thesis is a continuation of the previous work 
done in this laboratory (2,18). It is divided into two 
main parts,and a third short one. 

Part I 

A. The vapor-liquid equilibria in a methane-pentane- 
isopentane system. 

B. The preparation of pure methane and its use in the 
study of the vapor-liquid equilibria of the methane-n 
heptane system. 

Part II 

In addition to the work outlined above, a description 
of methods and apparatus required for accessory measure¬ 
ments has been included. Cf these, a method of deter¬ 
mining the mean molecular weights of a naturally occurring 
naphtha (Sterling Pacific ho. 2 ) and its fractions is suf¬ 
ficiently important to describe in detail. The method 
offers a convenient means of characterizing the liquid 
fractions recovered from solubility measurements. 



















Part III 

The next stage in the investigation is the study of 
the vapor- liquid equilibria in complex hydrocarbon 
systems such as those found in huiier Valley. idditional 
apparatus required in this next stage has been devised. 

A description of this apparatus has been included. 
Preliminary experiments on the P - V curve of the 

(] 2) a 1 pas have been conducted.

Part I 

literature Review 

A relatively "brief review of the literature is pre¬ 
sented. Attention is given principally to the report of 
other work related most closely to the present problem. 

Of the earlier work on liquid, non-hydrocarbon systems* 
principal reports are those of Wroblewski (51), 

Sander (43) and Hachnel (15A) on the solubility of carbon 
dioxide in water and some organic solvents. More 
recently, much work has appeared covering a wider range 
of pressures and dealing with such systems as nitrogen 
and water. A few of the important papers are mentioned 
below. 

larsen and Black (22), in connection with studies of 
the synthetic ammonia process, determined the solubility 
of nitrogen and hydrogen, mixtures in ammonia over a wide 
range of conditions. The summary given for their work is 

as follows, quote: 

"The solubility of a mixture of hydrogen and 
nitrogen (3:1) in liquid ammonia has been determined 
through a temperature range -25.2°C to 22.0°C and at 
pressures of 50, 100 and 150 atmospheres. The temper¬ 
ature coefficient is positive. The solubility of the 







-o- 


3:1 mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen more than doubles 

. 

oonforms olosely to Henryk law of gas solubility#" 
unquote. 

Saddington and Erase (37) studied the vapor-liquid 
equilibria in the system nitrogen-water. They worked up 
to pressures of 300 atmospheres and to temperatures of 
250°C. 

They found that, • as predicted by Eeunen f 19A) and 
others, the solubility of nitrogen in water passes through 
a minimum point in the neighborhood of 70° to 80°G. 
Pressure caused a decided increase in the amount of 
dissolved nitrogen but Henry’s law did not explain the 
increase quantitatively. They recommended that,liquid 
phase, density measurements be made in order to test the 
applicability of Poynting's relation for the calculation 
of vapor phase compositions from the compressibility of 

i 

the solution. 

Wiebe and Gaddy (48) worked on the solubility of 
hydrogen in water at 0, 50, 75 and 10G°0. from 25 to 1000 
atmospheres pressure. 

The solubility of hydrogen in water showed a minimum 
within the experimental range. They conclude that, 
"existing data show that minima are a general phenomenon 


that can be deduced from the known behavior of mixtures 








and not necessarily dependent on specific properties of 
the solvent or solute.” 

,/iebe and Daddy (49) also studied the solubility of 
heliiim over a similar range of conditions as those used 
for nitrogen. like hydrogen and nitrogen, helium showed 
a minimum of solubility (at a lov/er temperature). 

Krichevskii and Kazamovskii (21) report on a method 
for the calculation of the solubilities of nitrogen and 
hydrogen in water at high pressures. 

The method, while based in part upon the rrn odynamic 
theory, is to some extent empirical and is not of general 
application. The method fails when the mutual solubilities 
of the components mailing up the system are great. 

The more useful part of the literature, as far as 
the present work is concerned, is that dealing with 
hydrocarbon systems. This is somewhat scanty compared to 
the literature reviewed but it is growing rapidly. The 
earliest comprehensive study is that of McDaniel (25). 

He determined the solubility of hydrocarbon gases in 
organic liquids, at different temperatures, at atmos¬ 
pheric pressure. The work is considered classic, in being 
reliable and it initiated far reaching studies. 

Mills and Heithecker (27) worked on the solubility of 
a natural gas in crude oil and found that the volume of 
the oil increased, and that the specific gravity decreased. 












as the amount of gas dissolved increased, 

Beeoher and Parkhurst (4), and also Dow and Calkin (7) 
confirmed these results and showed that increasing temper¬ 
ature decreased the solubility of the gas. 

Frolich (12) and his co-workers studied the solubili¬ 
ties of methane, hydrogen and nitrogen in a series of sol¬ 
vents up to pressures of 100 to 140 atmospheres in the 
case of methane and as high as 200 atmospheres in the case 
of hydrogen and nitrogen. 

They draw the following conclusions. 

(1) If a gas does not form a chemical compound with the 
solvent, it follows Henry ! s law over a wide range of 
pressure within the limits of error allowed in 
engineering calculations. 

(2) ^he solubilities of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen and 
methane may, for practical purposes, be considered 
linear functions of the recorded absolute pressures 
(depending upon the extent to v/hich the solute and 
solvent obey the perfect gas laws). If corrections 
for deviations from the gas law are made, the linear 
relation holds to high pressures. 

Probably as a result of the report made by Hiller (26) 
and of recent developments in the petroleum industry, the 
American Petroleum Institute is supporting a comprehensive 























- 9 - 


study of'’Phase Squill in Hydrocarbon Systems’. 

Sage and Lacey (38) and co-workers are publishing a 
series of papers on this project. Their first results 
(39) deal with the methane-propane system. Regions of 
"retrograde condensation" were observed. "Retrograde 
condensation" refers to the phenomenon of evaporation or 
transfer of vapor from the liquid to the gas phase which 
occurs when the gas pressure is increased at constant 
temperature. The phenomenon was observed over a range of 
pressures, starting at some pressure below the critical 
pressure of complete miscibility of components and be¬ 
coming more pronounced as the critical pressure is 
approached. 

Sage and Lacey (40) draw some important conclusions 
from their study of the solubility of a dry natural gas 
in crude oil. Quote, "When dealing with hydrocarbon 
systems involving volatile constituents in the original 
liquid phase, the term ’solubility 1 , in its strict sense, 
cannot be applied. The process whereby equilibrium is 
attained between the liquid and the added gas does not 
consist merely of a partial dissolving of the latter, but 
involves a mutual interchange of constituents between - the 
two phases; the composition of both phases changing with 
pressure." 

A simple dissolving process occurs only if the tern- 












- 10 - 


perature of the system is well "below the critical temper¬ 
ature of the solvent and the pressure of the system well 
below the critical pressure of complete miscibility of’ 
the mixture. 

The solubility of a dry natural gas in any given crude 
oil at 100°F. was found to be almost directly proportional 
to the saturation pressure. A simple solution of the gas 
in the oil was assumed. 

A change in the gas composition was found to have a 
marked effect upon the solubility. Pure methane was found 
to be much less soluble than a dry natural gas containing 
8.6% ethane and 6.6% propane. In the early work in this 
laboratory, the same phenomenon was noted by Johnson (18). 

Sage and Lacey (41), in work upon the solubility of 
propane in different oils, found that the solubility of 
propane in an oil increases rapidly as its partial 
pressure approaches the vapor pressure of pure propane. 

The apparent specific gravity of the dissolved pro¬ 
pane is greater than that of pure saturated propane 
liquid at the same temperature. 

The lav/s of ideal solution appear to apply to pro¬ 
pane rather closely when it is dissolved in crystal oil 
(a highly refined oil containing no volatile constituents).

Further reports on various hydrocarbon systems studied 
by Sage and Lacey and their co-workers are to be found 
in the volumes of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry 
1935, 1936, 1937 and 1938. 

Previous work from this laboratory (U. of A.) deals 
with the methods and apparatus (18A) and concerned the 
investigation of a number of systems which were substant¬ 
ially two-component systems. (18) The liquids studied were 
n heptane, cyclohexane, benzene and toluene. Since the 
report (18) on these liquids, Johnson has studied hexane, 
methyl cyclohexane and n pentane. The gas used was 
largely methane with small amounts of nitrogen. The 
conditions of the experiments included temperatures from 
25°C. to 115°C # and pressures to 5400 lb. per sq. inch, 
except in cases where the system had a critical pressure 
of complete miscibility of the components which was 
lower than this maximum pressure. 

Johnson (1B) concludes that the ideal gas laws fail 
to express the behavior of the systems studied. Henry’s 
law holds good to pressures up to approximately one third 
of the critical pressure of complete miscibility, but 
fails to explain the experimental results above this 
pressiire. The rapid increase of solubility with pressure 
resulting in a single phase system probably explains this. 









- 12 - 


Poynting's law fails at very low pressures. This is 
explicable on the basis of the great mutual solubility of 
the components in the systems studied. The great mutual 
solubility results in the two phases becoming more and more 
alike as the pressure is increased. The comparison of 
different systems showed agreement with predictions; the 
lowest critical pressures occurred with paraffinic hydro¬ 
carbon systems, the intermediate critical pressures with 
the c37*cloparaffins or naphthenic hydrocarbons, and the 
highest critical pressures with aromatic hydrocarbons. 

This order is to be expected as the mutual solubility of 
methane with other hydrocarbons decreases as the molecules 
become more unlike, that is in .the order paraffins, cyclo¬ 
paraffins and aromatics.

Theoretical Considerations 

Most of the equations developed for the equilibrium 
in two component-two phase systems have been for systems 
in which the two compounds are relatively immiscible and 
such equations are not readily applicable to the predic¬ 
tion of the properties of complex hydrocarbon systems. 

Johnson (18) has given a very good review of the 
literature dealing with efforts to correlate experimental 
results obtained for various systems with various formulas 
and theoretical equations. 

For the general study of equilibrium in two-component 
-two phase systems the Phase Pule, F* C - P + 2 may be 
used. If one condition, e.g. temperature, pressure, or 
volume is fixed arbitrarily, F = i f and the behavior of 
the system is univariant and can be represented graphi¬ 
cally by a line. The results for previous work done in 
this laboratory are plotted in this way. 

Gibbs (13) gives a qualitative treatment of the 
general case of a mixture of gases. He neglected the sol¬ 
ubility of the gas in the liquid. 

Hoozeboom (36) took into account the solubility of 
the gas in the liquid (assuming it to increase with 
pressure). He predicted the existence of a critical 
pressure above which the system becomes a single phase. 
















- 14 - 


The gas and liquid are miscible in all proportions above a 
certain pressure. This has been confirmed by Johnson 1 s 
work (18), Critical pressures were reached for most of 
the hydrocarbon systems at pressures within the experimental 
limits (5400 ycf in this case). 

Henry's law and Raoult's law are applicable to hydro¬ 
carbon systems only at low pressures. 

Randall and Sosnick (34) have shown that Dalton's 
law is not applicable to gaseous solutions if one component 
is a vapor existing in a concentration above that corres¬ 
ponding to its normal vapor pressure. 

An equation applicable to systems of highly miscible 
gases and liquids such as hydrocarbon systems is desirable. 
It is also desirable to consider both phases. 

Such equations can be developed by the use of the 
differential calculus, but they are of little practical 
application until the various coefficients have been de¬ 
termined experimentally. The increasing amount of experi¬ 
mental work being done, in recent years on phase equili¬ 
bria in hydrocarbon systems, is rapidly supplying data 
from which such coefficients can be computed. 

The following development of such differential equa¬ 
tions is due to Boomer (6) and Johnson (18B).

The coefficients in equations (3) and (4) must be 
evaluated by experimental data before the equations 
become of practical importance. Sufficient experimental 
data on the systems studied in this laboratory has not yet 
been obtained to allow of evaluation of these coefficients. 

The pressure-volume-temperatures relations of the 


individual phases as a function of composition are required. 
A qualitative explanation of the experimental curves for 
the liquid phase can be made by means of the following 
development based on a suggestion due to Gillespie (14).

Bassett (BA) has shown this to be the case for

This takes place in hydrocarbon systems as had been 
shown in the experimental results of Johnson (18). From 
equation (5), then, it may be predicted that the pressure- 
composition curve for the liquid phase will show a curva¬ 
ture concave to the pressure axis at low pressures, since, 

(tx? )

As the phases approach identity with higher pressures, 
the curve will change direction, becoming convex to the 
pressure axis and ultimately at the critical pressure, 
becoming parallel to the composition axis, as,

i.e. when the molal volume of the liquid component is the 
same in each phase, the composite oil-pressure curve will 
parallel the pressure axis. Evidently, at pressures 
below this point, the slope of the curve becomes increas¬ 
ingly great, since the difference in molal volumes increase 
Lting's rule). However, if the gas is soluble to any 
in the liquid the assumption that - O is 
incorrect, and also, changes ii AN A and AV^ must be 
considered. 

The quantity, A\4 ) is always positive and approaches 
zero as the pressure approaches the critical value. -A\//

and increases with increasing pressures to zero at the 


critical pressure. At low pressures,

Below this pressure # the vapor oont< the gas phase

The greater the solubility of the gas in the liquid, the 
lower will be the pressure of minimum vapor content in the 
gas phase.

At this point, the critical pressure, the composition-

represents the point of union of the gas phase and liquid 
phase curves. 

By a similar method of approach the composition of the 
liquid and gaseous phases can be expressed as functions of 
temperature under conditions of constant pressure. 

By means of these relations, it can be predicted that 
the critical pressure of a system will be lowered as the 
temperature is increased. This agrees with the expert-

mental results.

IIATEPIALS 


The gas used in the exp ' ts with the pentane- 
isopentane mixture was available from previous solubility 
work done in this laboratory. The preparation of this gas, 
referred to as las 3, hereafter, is described in a paper 
by Boomer, Johnson and Thomas (6A). 

The composition of this gas . i , - 

5.3 - 0.5% nitrogen, with 0.2% or less of 
gases such as hydrogen, ethylene etc. The P-V-T relations 
of las 3 are discussed by Johnson (18). 

The gas used in the experiments with the heptane was 
prepared from Viking natural gas in a manner to be des¬ 
cribed. The natural gas from the Viking field is high in 
methane content. In addition to methane it contains 3.5% 
higher hydrocarbons and 5.7% nitrogen. The gas as purified 
contained 99.4 to 99.5% methane, the remail ii 0.6 to 0.5% 
being mainly nitrogen. A typical combustion analysis gave 
a C/H ratio of 2.966, indicating that no ethane was pr : .. 
The density at IT. T. P. was 7.200 x 10" ~ grams per c.c. 
(density of pure methane is 7.168 x 10“ 4 grams/c. c.). 

The pentane-isopentane solvent was obtained from 
Turner Valley naphtha by fractional distillation. m he 









first stop in the fraotionation yielded a fraction con¬ 
taining the hexanes and pentanes. This first fraction was 
refractionated and the pentane-isopentane fraction ob¬ 
tained. The fraction had the following properties*

solubility apparatus and (4) the analytical apparatus. 

(l) The Low Pressure las Purification System. 

In the previous vapor-liquid equilibria work done in 
this laboratory and for the pentane-isopentane system as 
described bed , 'os B t was used. As has already been 
mentioned this gas was essentially 95.0% methane and 5% 
nitrogen. Before going on to the study of the vapor- 
liquid equilibria in Turner Valley naphtha, it was decided 
to determine the effect of the 5% nitrogen by doing some 
work with pure methane and n-heptane. 

The method adopted for the purification of the Viking 
natural gas was liquefaction of the gas - by means of liquid 
air, followed by a fractional distillation to remove such 
impurities as ethane and nitrogen. 

Since methane boils at -161.5°0., nitrogen boils at 
-195.8°C. and ethane at -88.3°0., it seemed reasonable to 
expect a good separation could be obtained by fractionation. 

Several condensers were constructeaf6) before satis- 















-28- 


factory results were obtained. 

The low pressure gas purification system which was 
finally evolved is shown in Fig. 1 and Pig. 2. The Viking 
natural gas from the city mains entered the system at the 
f connection, A. The connection to W acted as 
valve if a blockage occurred in the rest of the system. 
Carbon dioxide was removed by passage through the soda- 
lime tower. later-vapor was removed by passing the gas 
through a calcium chloride tower, a concentrated sulphuric 
acid bubbler, H, and a large solid K 0 H tower. 

The gas then passed into the condenser, C, which was 
cooled by liquid air added to the space, ', 

Dewar tube, T, and the thin copper cylinder, P. This 
space contained glass wool. 

The copper cylinder and the Dewar tube rested upon the 
corks, I, and were enclosed in the metal container, 1 . As 
the gas passed through the coil in the upper part of the 
condenser it was cooled, and, upon entering the main body 
of the condenser, it condensed as a liquid, lion-condensible 
gases passed upwards through the reflux section. This 
section was packed with single coils of aluminum wire about 
0.5 cm. in diameter. The top of the packed section came 
to within approximately 1 cm. of the thermocouple, B.

This thermocouple was used to measure the temperature

, 

mined. From the flowmeter, the gas could he passed through 
the tube, X, to a continuous gas analyzer. This analyzer 
(46), of the thermal conductivity type, was used to indicate 
when gas of constant composition was being obtained. /hen 
desired, the gas was p s 3 to a water sealed gas holder 
through the connection, 1. The condenser, G, could be 
heated at the bottom by means of an electric heating coil 
connected through the wires, D. This heating element was 
wound around a small diameter section at the bottom of the 
condenser and it was covered with asbestos insulation. 

The procedure in purifying the natural gas was of 
necessity a batch process. liquid air was blown into the 
space, E t from a liquid air container, until the space was 
filled to within one to two centimetres of the top. 

Gas was allowed to enter the system through the tube, 
and leave through the tube, X, the rate of flow being 
about 700 - 800 c.c. per minute. It took between 2 -ir - 3 
hours to fill the lov/er section of the condenser with 
liquefied gas. 

’hen the condenser was filled with liquefied gas, the 
heater, 0, was turned on, and when the condensed gas

f 

, closed. 'L'he current input to the heater was adjusted 
so that a good reflux was obtained in the packed section 
of the condenser. The rate of off gas was about one litre 
per minute. r hen the composition of the off gas had be¬ 
come steady, as shown by the continuous gas a 2 ~. zer, the 
stopcock, r, was reversed and the gas passed through, T , 
to a water-sealed ,gas holder. About ten litres of gas 
had to be boiled off before the composition became constant. 

hen nearly all of the liquified gases had been distilled 
the.stopcock, H, was again reversed and the residual con¬ 
densate, which contained any ethane present, was distilled 
off into the atmosphere. 

Approximately 60 litres of gas could be made per run. 
When operating steadily, i.e. one batch run after another, 
it took about two pounds of liquid air per run. In addi¬ 
tion to the liquid air added at the start of the run, more 
liquid air had to be added from time to time during the 
course of the run. The total used per run was approximately 
two pounds. A run took about &§• to 4 hours to complete. 

(2) The compression and high-pressure storage and 

_ m 

purification system is shown in Fig. 3. (diagrammatic). 

It v/as not possible to use the three stage compressor 





















- 33 - 


av ail able in the labo I , as this compressor had to he 
used frequently in connection with other research being 
conducted in the laboratory. The frequent flushings of 
the large compressor, which would have been necessary, and 
the accompanying wastage of gas and opportunity for im¬ 
purities entering the system, were avoided bj i g the 
system shown in Fig. 3. 

As mentioned above, the gas from the liquid air 
fractionating column shown in Fig. 2 passed to a water- 
sealed gas holder. A half-inch pipe line connected this 
water sealed gas holder to a small single-stage compressor, 
A. 3y means of compressor, A, the gas from the gasometer 
could be pumped into the intermediate pressure tank* B, 
up to pressures of. a maximum of about 140 pounds per 
square inch. The gas pressure in tank, A, was recorded 
by the gauge, l-j_. 

From, 3, the gas was compressed by means of compressor 
C, into the high pressure storage cylinder, 3, ( 5 litre 
capacity). The gas pressure in cylinder, 3, was recorded 
by the Bourdon gauge, Og. 

From the high pressure cylinder, 3, the gas passed 
through the high pressure purification system. The units 
in this system were: a charcoal adsorb© hich removed

. 

served to remove any oxygen present. The furnace was 
followed by another II 0 H drier, I, and charcoal ad¬ 
sorber, J. By opening valve 6 con: ection could be made to 
the solubility apparatus. $3 was a calibrated Bourdon 
gauge used for measuring pressures in the solubility 
apparatus • 

Tank, B, could be isolated from the rest of the system 
by means of valves 10 and 2, It could be flushed inde¬ 
pendently by means of valve 1. Cylinder, D, could be 
isolated by means of valves 3, 4 and flushed by means of 

valve 7. 

Bor obtaining pressures higher than 900 to 1000 pounds 
per square inch, valve 3 was shut, valve 9 opened and by 
means of the hydraulic pump, L t a glycerol-water ire 

was pumped into the cylinder, D, from the reservoir, K. 

The gas in D was thus compressed until the desired pressure 
was reached. The solution could be withdrawn at valve 7 
when it was desired to pump in more gas. This arrangement 
enabled high pressures to be reached with smaller amounts 
of gas than would have been required with the large com-

Oas B for the work on the pentane-isopentane system 
was introduced from storage cylinder, l! t through valve 11. 

Samples of the gas oould be withdrawn for analysis 
or density determination at valves 1 and 7. 

(3) The Solubility Apparatus. 

The solubility apparatus used is shown in Pig. 4 and 
Fig. 5. The design and calibration of this apparatus has 
already been described by Argue and Johnson (2, 18, 18A). 

The apparatus was so made that the gas and liquid phases 
reached equilibrium with each other at a reasonable rate. 
For the purposes of analysis known volumes of each phase 
could be withdrawn. 

The sample of the gas phase was obtained from the gas 
phase pipette, A, which had a volume of 11.206 - 0.005 e. . 

The sample of the liquid phase was obtained from the 
ehase pipette, B, which had a volume of 21. - 

.0.005 c.c. The ends of the pipettes A and B were connected 
to the central chambers through l/lG” and l/4 M tubing , 
respectively. The pipettes with their contents could be 
isolated by closing valves 2, 3, 4 and 5. The contents 
could be withdrawn for analysis through valve 6 and 7. 

The volume of the central chambers was approximately 70 c.c.

"The whole as; embly was pivoted at G and could be 
oso lllated 90° by the gear train and crank, D. 

The gear train was so equipped with cams and a clutch that 
the pipette assembly was held in each extreme tilted 
position for one-half minute during each oscillation. 

The tilting motion was sufficiently rapid to provide 
agitation of the contents of the central cylinders. To 
assist in promoting the desired agitation a close-fitting 
steel piston and a steel ball were placed in the liquid 
phase pipette, B. This piston and the ball moved from 
one end of the pipette to the other when oscillation 
occurred. 1T 

During an experiment the temperature of the pipette 
embly was maintained constant to within 0.1°C.by a 
thermostatically controlled oil bath shown in Dig. 5. 

This bath was heated electrically. 

The oil bath with its heaters could be lowered clear 
of the pipette assembly to allow access to the valves. 

Dor details of the construction of the apparatus, 
packing of the valves, calibration etc. the reader is 
referred to Johnson (18).

figure 7 shows the essential parts of the apparatus 
used for collecting and measuring the expanded contents 
of the pipettes. 

A brief explanation of Figure 7 is as follows. ’A* 
was a glass-to-metal joint at the junction of a flexible 
copper tube (from the solubility apparatus) and the

used either for evacuating the pipettes and the apparatus 
to the left of stopcock 4, or for circulating the gases.

by means of ground glass joints and could be removed for 
the purpose of weighing.

casing from air currents in the room. The temperature 
of the gas in the bulbs was determined by means of a 
calibrated thermometer hung inside the case. The volume 
of all tubing between sto>cooks 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 
was determined as 46.7 c.c. to the 60.0 mark on the 
manometer. The three large bulbs in seric;. a total 

volume of-6575.4 c.c., not including the volume 46.7 c.c. 
The smaller bulb had a volume of 1024.3 c.c. not includ¬ 
ing the volume 46.7 c.c. 

■p* is an accurately calibrated density bulb by means of 
which samples of the gas in the system could be removed 
and weighed. The weight of the bulb could be determined 
when evacuated and when containing gas at a xnown temper¬ 
ature and pressure. From the weight and volume of the 
gas its density could be determined. By means of stop- 
cod:, 1", samples of the gas could be taken to the can- 
bust ion analysis apparatus shown in ^ig* • 

Connection to mercury diffusion pumps in series with 
an oil pump was made at stopcock 6.

used (6B).

for measuring the volume of the gas sample. The temper¬ 
ature was determined by means of a calibrated thermometer 
immersed in a water jacket surrounding the pipette. The 
pressure was measured by means of manometer, ’K 1 (shown in 
Fig, 7). The whole apparatus could be evacuated by the 
same evacuating system used for the expansion apparatus. 
The connection was made at B through stopcock 4,

the Sprengel pump was operated. 

'K' was a safety valve used to prevent mercury entering 
the furnace in case of the jet pump being disconnected 
accidentally. 

’S’ was a copper oxide tube 38 cm. long and 1.9 cm, in 
diameter, containing about 200 grams of copper oxide- 
cerium oxide mixture. During an analysis the temperature 
of the tube was maintained at 800 t 10°0, by means of an 
electric furnace. Previous . ork had shown this tempera¬ 
ture to be the best for rapid, complete oxidation of the 
hydrocarbons.

Method of Operation 

The pipette assembly. Fig. 5, was tested under pressure 
for leaks fby immersion in the oil bath) and then evacuated 
and flushed with gas from the storage system. A funnel 
was fitted to valve 8 and the correct amount of liquid, as 
from experience, was added. Valves 6 a 2 7 \ i 
closed; valves 2, 5, 4 and 5 were left open; 
was raised and connection to the high pressure storage and 
ification system e ie at valve 8. Gas was then 
admitted into the apparatus until the desired pressure was 
reached. Valve 8 was then clos 1 oscillation started. 
After about fifteen minutes, connection was again made to 

















- 47 - 


the gas sup^l; and any necessar adju: tment o ’ the pressure 
was made. This cycle of operation was repeated until no 
change of pressure in the 'ipettes could he observed after 
one hour of oscillation. The oil ' th was thei lowered 
and valves 2, 3, 4 and 5 closed quickly. 

The next step in the procedure was the removal of the 
pipette contents to the expansion apparatus* While equi¬ 
librium was being attained, the expansion apparatus to the 
right of stopcocks 1 and 2 was evacuated to a pressure of 
less than 0.1 mm. of mercury. When equilibrium had bee 
reached, connection between the solubility apparatus and

The gas was allowed to expand at approximately 100 c.c. 
per minute. After the pressure in t ’ pett ©d

the left of stopcocks 7 was evacuated by means of 

pump, D, until

was less than 0,1 mm. of mere . 1 # 2 # 

and re closed, the condenser was rei 

weighed. Prom the difference between the weight with 

condensate and the empty weight, the weight of liquid 

condensate could be computed. 

The gas in the bulbs, M, was then circulated for 
one-half an hour to a 1 o r or more (depending upon the 
composition of the gas) by means of the Toepler pump* 

The pump was then shut off; stopcock 7 or 8 (depending 
upon the storage space being used) was closed and the gas 
in the pump was pumped over •* nt o ':h b "V , the 
in the pump being raised to stopcock, 10, which was tl 
closed. The pressure and the temperature were recorded 
along with the bulb space being used. Prom this data 
the volume of gas at IT. T. P. was calculated. Density 
determinations were then made upon the gas by means of 
the density -bulb P. Prom the volume at IT. T. P. and 
the density, the total weight of the gas from the pipettes 
could be computed. This added to the weight of the liquid 
condensate gave the total weight of the pipette contents# 
Since the pipette volume was known, it was a sii pie

pressure of less than 0.1 mm. of mercury. During this 
evacuation the mercury supply and discharge tubes con¬ 
nected to the Sprengel pump were shut by means of screw 
clamps. Stopcock 2 was closed, stopcock 1 opened to the 
gas expansion apparatus and a sample of gas was taken in 
ipette, C, the temperature and pressure being re¬ 
corded. Stopcocks 3, 4, 5 and 6 being closed, stopcock 
1 was reversed and the gas sample waa allowed to expand 
into the evacuated apparatus. The level of the mercury 
reservoir of the Sprengel pump was adjust nd circu¬ 
lation of the gas sample through the system comenced. 
Oxidation of the gas was usually completed in 15 to 20 
minutes. The disappearance of condensed water vapor in 
the side-arm of tube, D, was a good indication of the 

















- 


near completion of the combustion. The circulation was 
stopped momentaril , ' ok 5 was reversed, 6 

opened and the level of the mercury in the reservoir of 
the Sprengel pump adjusted. Circulation was again 
started and oxygen, as required, allowed to enter the 
system at 5. This added oxygen oxidized the remaining 
traces of hydrocarbons and reoxidized the reduced copper 
in the combustion tube. 

Circulation was continued for about an hour. The 
Sprengel pump v/as then shut off, and the stopcocks on 
the absorption tubes closed. The absorption tubes were 
removed, allowed to come to room temperature and re¬ 
weighed with their contents at atmospheric pressure, as 
before• 

The combusion gave an accurate carbon-hydrogen 
analysis which, in conjunct:’ wit! the density deter¬ 
mination, enabled the calculation of the gas composition 
when only the three components, methane, nitrogen and 
liquid vapor, were present. 

The results of the combustion analysis, together 
with the total weight of the liquid and gas yielded 
sufficient data for the computation of the phase compo- 
sition.

Hesults and Discussion 

Calculations: 

Por the experiments with Gas B and with the puri¬ 
fied methane it was possible to compute the complete 
composition of the phases from the experimental data. 

The weight of carbon dioxide and water produced in a 
combusion analysis enabled the weight of carbon and 
hydrogen to be computed. Prom the density, volume and 
temperature measurements the weight of the sample burned 
could be found. 

Prom this data the composition could be computed as 
follows, using pentane as the example.

Johnson (18) has given a detailed discussion of the 
errors involved in the investigation. The standard pro¬ 
cedure, developed in the earlier work, was duplicated in 
the present investigation as nearly as possible. The 
deviation in duplicate runs was from ± 0.5," at the lower 
pressures to t 0*2% or loss at the higher 

Data and Results. 

The results obtained are shown in the form of tables 
and graphs. F] pentane-isopentane las 3 system and the 
n heptane-las B system are discussed separately# 

n Pentane-isopentane las B System. 

The results for this system are shown in Table 1. 

The results obtained by Johnson for the n-jaentane Gas B 
system are shown in the lower half of Table 1. Owing to 
the small size of the sample of the n-pentane isopentane 
mixture, it was not possible to obtain complete data up to 
the critical point. 




















In a work* 

solubilities are expressed as moles of methane per mol 
of liquid. The vapor concentration of the gas is expressed 

■h 

Tor the purpose of ready comparison, the 
obtained for the n-pentane isopentane Gas B system and 
the n pentane Gas 3 system, have been plotted on the 
same graphs. 

The pressure-density curves are shown in -’ig. 0, 

The density of the liquid phases decreases in each case 
due to the solution of the gas as the pressure increases. 
The density of the vapor phases increases in each case due 
to the increasing concentration of pentane vapor in'the 
vapor phase and also to the decreasing specific volume 
of the gas. 

The critical pressure (at 25°0J for l. e n-pei tai e 
Gas B system occurred at a pressure of 186 atmospheres, 

From Fig, 9 it is evident that the critical pressure for 
the n-pentane isopentane Gas sj ste ./ill be somewhat 
lov/er than this, since, at the same pressure, the 
density of the liquid phase is less, ar 
phase more, than for the first system# 

The variation of solubility with pressure is shown in 
Fig, 10. Concentrations are expressed as oles of methane

This can be considered as methane with two of the hydrogen

would be expected that methane would be more soluble in 
the n pentane-isopentane than in the n pentane alone. ! . 
increased solubility in the mixture would be due to the 
greater solubility of methane in the isopentane in the

miscible; the system becomes single jhase. 

The concentration of pentane in the gas phase 
(expressed as moles of pentane per mol of expanded gas) 
as a function of pressure is shown in Figure 11. It is 
evident that the liquid to gas ratio at I f 

reaches a minimum and then increases. The minimum is 
explained by the fact that at low pressures the concentra¬ 
tion of gas increases more rapidly with pressure than 
does the vapor pressure of pentane* However, at high 
pressures, the vapor pressure of pentane increases more 
rapidly with increasing pressure than does the gas con¬ 
centration. The mass concentration of pentane vapor in

the methane which replaces the nitrogen of Gas B is more 
solubl ■ 8 nitrogen. This fact was i •©- 

vious work done in this laboratory. Previous work has also 
shown that nitrogen gas takes up only about 20* less 
heptane than does methane. 

The results obtained would appear to indicate that 
the presence of 5 fo or less of nitrogen in the Gas B 
would not cause sufficient deviation from the results 
obtained with pure methane to justify the additional 
cost of removing the nitrogen content of the methane. The 
difference in the pressure-density curves for the n- 
heptane and Gas B and for the n-heptane and pure methane 
is within the limits of the experimental error. The 
greatest difference appears in the solubility of the gas 
in the liquid, the pure methane being 1 to 1. ore 
soluble than Gas B within the pressure range studied.

Summary of Part T 


sthod for the purification of natural gas by low- 
temperature fra al distillation has been presented. 

The fractionation was carried out at atmo spheric pressure 
and produced ga£ containing 99*5% methane, the- remaining 
constituents being nearly all nitrogen. The method 
involves little initial outlay for equipment but the oper 
-ating costs are considerable owing to the expense for 
liquid air. Sage : I '38' 3thod for the 

purification of natural gas by fractional distillation at 
reduced pressure. The initial cost for equipment for their 
method would be greater however. Efforts to reduce the 
nitrogen content to less than 0.5 to 0.6% by the method 
used in this laboratory were not successful. The form¬ 
ation of a constant boiling mixture of methane and nit¬ 
rogen was suspected but not investigated. l r o reference 
to the formation of such a constant boiling mixture.could 
be found in the literature. 

The vapor-liquid equilibrium of the i-pentane isopen¬ 
tane Oas B system has been investigated and the results 
compared to those obtained for the n-pentane '"’as B system. 
The critical pressure was found to be reduced itoy the

Introduction 

The study of-the vapor-liquid equilibria in a hydro¬ 
carbon system (c.g. methane gas with a pure liquid such 
as heptane), did not offer great analytical diffi . 

- ciibed in Part I, the determination of 

the carbon to hydrogen ratio by means of a combustion 
analysis and of the density of the gas, together -..itli¬ 
the volume of the gas and the weight of the liquid conden¬ 
sate, yielded sufficient data to enable computation of the 
qc position of the vapor and liquid pha . ' T c .v a, _ 

J.63 _ dr ocarbon system, such as that of the hydro- 

3 associate ith occurring naphtha, 

cannot be analyzed so readily. 

Since this research includes in its field the study of 
natural gas and naphtha fractions such as occur in Turner 
Valley, a convenient method of analyzi] 

complex hydrocarbon mixture was sought. The analysis of 
such hydrocarbon mixtures is best carried out by cans of 
fractional distillation with equipment such as the Pod-

equipment was not available in this laboratory and so . 
study of other physical perties, for the raeasua 
of whioh equipment was available, .... .The 

chief limiting factor was that the measurements must be 
made on small san les, *am. 

a mixture of hydrocarbons which, ii 

ion, appeared to offer the r 
information as to the character of the ixture was the 
mean molecular weight* It appeared possible to determine 
with precision the molecular weights of mixtures by the 
cryoscopic method, in a suitable solvent, using only 
small samples of the mixture. The only other property 
in this class was refractive index. 

Aside from its importance in connection with the vapor- 
liquid equilibria studies, the determination of the 
molecular weights of hydrocarbon mixtures is of importance 
in the design of refinery equipment and in correlating 
other physical properties of such mixtures with the 
average molecular cc lexity. In what fbllows, the 
principles of cryoscopic methods and a precision 
apparatus for mean molecular weight determinations ..ill be 
described.

Literature Review. 

Several reports on the determination of the mean 
molecular weights of petroleum fractions were found in the 
literature* The folic ' istitutes a brief review of 

some of these reports and their bearing upon the problem 
being studied. 

Vilson and Wylde (50) made determinations of the 
average or mean molecular weights of various oils in 
connection With work on vapor pressures of volatile solvent 
They used a cryoscopic method with benzene as the solvent. 
Satisfactory results are reported for gas absorbent oils 
(l . .. 160 to SCO) and fair results for oils with molecular 
weights up to 400. They obtained the value of the • ean 
molecular weight by plotting the values obtained for the 
molecular weight against freezing point lowering and then 
extrapolating this line back to zero freezing point 
lowering. This principle of determi ing the freezing 
point lowea ' i i ‘ dilute solution, Where the 

solution s m ay b e c on si der e d perfect, is of : e mo s t 
importance. In trie work, 

Generation of oil in the pure solvent increased, the 
apparent mean molecular weight increased, -hey explain 
this on the basis that some of the constituents of the

The nature of the solvent is important for another rea; , 
particularly in the present work as the naphtha contains 
relatively light hydrocarbons. It is es ential that the 
solvent used is not a constituent of the mixture. 

Epperson and Dunlap (8) determined the mean molecular 
weights of ten fractions of lubricating oils by a cryoscopic 
method, using three solvents, namely,- benzene, nitrobens 
and ethylene bromide. They used the regular Beckmann 
freezing point apparatus v/ith the addition of a mechanical 
stirrer and equipment for keeping the solvent under slight 
pressure v/ith dry compressed air. Sufficient solute was 
added to give a freezing point loweri . " . 

Extrapolation to zero freezing point lowering was not 
used, food agreement was found between the values of the 
mean molecular weights as determined ii the three solvents. 
They claim that this agreement tends to preclude any evi¬ 
dence of associat ion between the molecules of the solvent 
and the solute. It is obvious that in'this wprk, none of 
the solvents could be a constituent of the lubricating 
oils used as solute. 
















Viscosity determinations v/ere also made on the oil 
fractions and various blends of these fractions. The 
results indicate a possibility of predicting the viscosity 
of blended oils from the values of the mean molecular 
weights. Keith and Ho ess f 19) have carried out similar 
work. 

This viscosity mean molecular weight relationship was 
not directly ap licable to the work on the vapor-liquid 
equilibria because the small size of the sarmies of liquid 
available in the work, and the volatility of the ne 
frac tio ns, make accurate vis co s i t y measurements diffi ] . 
However, the existence of such a relationship suggested 
that similar relations might exist between mean molecular 
weights and other more useful properties. 

-enske, McOluer and Cannon (9) report a method for 
obtaining average molecular weights, of com'lex high- 
boiling hydrocarbon i: tui js, based on 1 ' 

The mean molecular weights were also determined V a 
cryoscopic method. Cyclohexane was used as the solvent 
because of its high cryoscopic constant, ^hey determined 
apparent values of the mean molecular weights, at various 
concentrations, and extrapolated to zero concentration. 

The greatest difference in the results as obtained by the 
two methods was 7f.

ted data shows that imourities (other than moisture) and 
moisture have an adverse effect on molecular weight deter¬ 
minations, The experimental method adopted also was 
shown to have an influence on the results. They conclude 
that discrepancies found in cryosco*ic determinations of 
molecular weights of oils, as reported ii the litei tur , 
are due primarily to impurities and econdly to the exper¬

the solid solvent crystallizes out, the concentration of 
solute in the remaining solvent increases steadil

prepared in the pure state 1 tively easily by fractional

The nitrobenzene used as a solvent was prepared from 
nitrobenzene G.P. grade. The nitrobenzene was filtered and 
then recrystallized twice; three-quarters of the liquid

which proved to give more satisfactory results. The copper

8. The refractive Indea of tl 

obtained immediately after the molecular 
weight determination. 

9. The density of the naphtha-'fraction. 


The values in column 7 of m able 9 were obtained from 
the graphs shown in Figure 20. 

This figure shows the apparent mean molecular 
weights of the various naphtha fractions 'lotted against 
the depression of the freezing point, from the straight 
lines obtained from the experimental points, it is 
evident that the relationship between the lowering of the 
freezing point and the apparent molecular weights is 
linear in nature within the limits of error of the metncd. 
The lines for the different fractions are very nearly 
parallel as can b seen in Figure 20. This would seem 
to indicate that the relationship between the apparent 
"ocular weight, the slope of the lines and the con¬ 
centration of solute, is the same for the different 
fractions in Series I. Such a result would be predicted

on the basis of work by ^all end °rnith (35) referred to 
previously. 

The value of the true mean molecular wei ht of each 
fraction was found by extrapolation to zero depression of 
the freezing point. The fracti , , , 

Series I did not differ greatly in boiling range and the 
values of the mean molecular weights of the tliree fraction 
were nearly the same. These fractions, 
were very volatile and the values found were probably 
greater than the true Dlecul ' ht of the orig¬ 

inal fraction. This error was caused by loss 01 solute 
due to vaporization. 

The experimental data for the sterling ~aC'. ~ic 

, > are 

column headings in Table 10 are the sane as in Table 
The values in column 7 of Table 10 were obtained from the 

graphs shown in figure 21. 

The linear relationship between the apparent mean 
molecular weight and the dei : freezing point 

is apparent. The relationship is again of a fairly 
regular ’character in passing from one fraction to another 
This is indicated h„ the fact that the lino, are nearly 
arallel. The slope, i.e. the rate of iner 

apparent mean molecular weight.
