SYNOPSIS 


The main purpose of this investigation was to ex¬ 
plore the efficiency of certain group and individual 
intelligence tests as predictors of academic achieve¬ 
ment at the junior high school level. In this study 
achievement was represented by the raw scores on a na¬ 
tionally standardized achievement test consisting of 
Reading, Arithmetic, and Language subtests. Three estab¬ 
lished group intelligence tests and one individual intel¬ 
ligence test were administered to a group of students at 
the Grande Prairie Junior High School. Pearson 1 s co¬ 
efficients of correlation between the intelligence quo¬ 
tients and the component achievement raw scores provided 
the basis for evaluation. The significahce of the coeffi¬ 
cients was determined by using the null hypothesis and 
Garrett 1 s Tables. 

Though each of the intelligence quotients showed a 
significant relationship with achievement raw scores, the 
writer concluded that reasonable accuracy could not be 
expected in predicting an individual’s probable success 
in academic achievement from an intelligence quotient. 

The positive correlation obtained between the measures 
was sufficiently high, however, to make reasonable predic¬ 
tion of class achievement. It was quite obvious that the 
measured intelligence was only one of the important factors

making for success in academic achievement. It was further 
revealed that there was a need for identifying the test 
from which an intelligence quotient was derived because the 
results obtained were not necessarily equivalent. 

The investigation revealed that there was no one test 
which was consistently superior as a predictor of academic 
achievement in the junior high school. The individual in¬ 
telligence test failed to produce substantially higher co¬ 
efficients of correlation with achievement raw scores. On 
the basis of this study, it was felt that group intelligence 
tests could be used more efficiently if the various intelli¬ 
gence quotients were converted into comparable measures. 

The additional study of intercorrelation of intelligence 
quotients indicated the need for reconciling the measures 
obtained from different tests.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEM 

The entire educational system from kindergarten 
to university is constantly concerned with the prog¬ 
nosis and measurement of achievement. Promotion implies 
that the pupil is ready to pursue successfully the 
program of the next grade level. In the past, schools 
have adopted various testing procedures aimed at the 
assessment of the abilities and achievement of their 
students. However, the predictive values of such 
procedures have seldom been fully appraised. School 
activities have proceeded as if pupils who sit together 
in classrooms were alike in ability, skill, adjustment, 
and interests, and that the attainment of the objectives 
of the curriculum by all could be more or less taken 
for granted. The current criticisms of our schools 
tend to emphasize the necessity for more accurate 
measurement and prediction of achievement throughout 
the entire range of elementary and secondary education. 

Failure to measure achievement effectively, coupled 
with inadequate knowledge of the capacity of our pupils, 
makes for ineffective classroom organization and 
instruction. Measurement which fails to diagnose areas 
of strength and weakness leaves the teacher relatively 
helpless in coping with the situation. Repetition of

grades has not proved the answer to the problem of 
inadequate achievement. The pupil’s special problems, 
needs, and difficulties must first be identified before 
they can be subjected to remedial treatment. Since most 
of the pupils are promoted annually it is desirable that 
at each grade level their difficulties should be elimin¬ 
ated so that they are really prepared to advance to the 
higher level. 

Although tests are by no means infallible, good 
paper-and-pencil tests assist the teacher in the evalua¬ 
tion of group and individual capacities and limitations. 
Test results may play a major role in confirming teacher 
judgment of individual pupils, in grouping for remedial 
or enriched instruction, and in prediction of probable 
success in higher learning. The data furnished by a good 
test afford a means of making comparisons between the 
average test score for a given group and that of a larger 
population on which the test was standardized. This 
information is useful in determining the extent to which 
individuals or groups tend to deviate from the standard¬ 
ization population. With reliable measures of intelli¬ 
gence and achievement, teachers can predict the achieve¬ 
ment for the class as a whole and need no longer apolo¬ 
gize when classes with low average intelligence do not 
reach the norms established for average or above- 
average groups. In addition, specific areas of achieve¬ 
ment or non-achievement are revealed both for classes

and for individuals, and dictate the emphasis of the 
subsequent teaching program. 

Although there has been a considerable advance 
of scientific knowledge in the area of mental testing, 
the tests now used are still imperfect. The need has 
long been felt for an evaluation of the different 
intelligence tests as to their ability to predict 
success in scholastic achievement. The investigation 
reported herein was undertaken in an attempt to secure 
information as to how the commonly used intelligence 
tests actually compare when correlated with raw scores 
on a standardized achievement test given to the same 
group of students at a junior high school level.

CHAPTER II 


EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
I. THE EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH 

The precise problem of this investigation is to 
explore the efficiency of certain group and individual 
intelligence tests as predictors of academic achieve*- 
ment. In this study achievement will be represented by 
the raw scores on a nationally used achievement test 
consisting of Reading, Arithmetic, and Language sub¬ 
tests. Four intelligence tests will be used: three 
established group tests and one individual test. The 
efficiency in prediction of achievement of each of the 
intelligence tests will be studied in terms of the 
component raw scores on the achievement test. 

II. THE SELECTION OF SAMPLE 

Since the purpose of this investigation was to 
examine the results obtained by a group of junior high 
students, a sample was readily obtained from the Grande 
Prairie Junior High School. The method of random num¬ 
bers was used to select one hundred subjects out of the 
available one hundred and sixty students. The subjects 
were listed according to grade and the first twenty 
selected in each grade became the subjects for the

individual intelligence test. The sample of one hundred 
pupils was used for the group intelligence tests and 
the battery of achievement tests. 

III. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children was 
administered individually to twenty subjects in each of 
the three junior high grades. In addition, these sixty 
subjects were given the following tests, namely, Otis 
Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test, Beta, Form A; 
Henmon-Nelson Test of Mental Ability, Form B; Terman- 
McNemar Test of Mental Ability, Form C, and the 
California Achievement Test, Intermediate Battery, 

Form BB . For the purpose of this investigation the 
following raw scores of the California Achievement 
Test, Intermediate Battery, Form BB, were tabulated: 

(a) Reading Vocabulary 

(b) Reading Comprehension 

(c) Arithmetic Reasoning 

(d) Arithmetic Fundamentals 

(e) Spelling 

(f) Mechanics of English 

(g) Total Language 

(h) Battery Total 

The Pearson product-moment technique was employed 
tp find the relationship between each of the above 
eight achievement raw scores and the I.Q. f s obtained 
on the three group intelligence tests and on the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children. 

As an additional study the group test I.Q. f s of 
the sixty subjects were correlated with each of the 
three WISC I.Q. f s.

IV. ADMINISTRATION OF TESTS 

With some financial aid from the Grande Prairie 

Public School Board and the co-operation of the teaching 

staff, all the pupils in the Grande Prairie Junior 

High School were given the three group intelligence tests 

and the California Achievement Tests. The individual 

intelligence test was administered during the first 

four months of the school year. The group tests were 

administered on the following dates: 

Otis Quick-Scoring - October 17,1952 

Henmon-Nelson - November 7,1952 

Terman-McNemar - December 9,1952 

California Achieve¬ 
ment Battery - week of Jan.16,1953 

Before the administration of each group test the 
homeroom teachers discussed the procedure in handling 
the tests. It was agreed that all the homeroom teachers 
would administer the test at the same time and that 
they would do the initial scoring. The tests used in 
the present investigation were re-checked for mechanical 
errors. 


V. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS 

The significance of an obtained coefficient of 
correlation was tested against the null hypothesis. 

The null hypothesis assumes that the traits measured 
are uncorrelated and that the true or population r 
is zero. The significance of an obtained r was deter¬ 
mined by entering Garrett 1 s Table 49 ^ with N-2 degrees

of freedom and comparing the sample r with the tabulated 
entries. When the number of cases is 60 a calculated r 
must be .255 to be significant at the ,05 level and 
*331 to be significant at the .01 level. When the 
number of cases is 100 a calculated r must be .197 to 
be significant at the .05 level and .257 to be sig¬ 
nificant at the .01 level. This means, in the latter 
case, that only five times in 100 trials would an r 
as large as .197 appear by accidents of sampling if 
the population r were actually zero; and once in 100 
trials would an r of .257 appear if the population 
r were zero. For an obtained r of . 35 , since it is 
larger than .257, we conclude that the null hypothesis 
is disproved and that the obtained r is significantly 
different from zero at the .01 level. 

VI. LIMITATIONS OF STUDY 

The ideal approach to the determination of equi¬ 
valent or comparable scores on several different tests 
would be to administer the different tests to the same 
group of subjects in such fashion as to minimize 
practice effect, and within a sufficiently short span 
of time that no appreciable growth in the functions 
measured would take place between the testings. The 
many practical difficulties of this method, particularly 
with a group sufficiently large to yield dependable 
results, constitute one of the principal reasons why so

few studies of this kind have been made. 

A second approach, perhaps less satisfactory on 
theoretical grounds, involves the administration of 
each of the tests to groups assumed to be equivalent 
or matched with respect to the abilities measured by 
the tests. 

The present investigation follows the first 
suggested method. The intelligence tests were spaced 
to overcome the practice effect to some degree but it 
may be questionable if the span of time was short 
enough to prevent an appreciable growth in the functions 
measured. Pearson’s product-moment correlation technique 
which was used in this investigation does not take 
account of any such change. 

To discover the relationship between intelligence 
and school achievement, uninfluenced by maturation, 
we must rule out or control the age factor. This could 
be accomplished experimentally by selecting subjects 
of the same age. However, it is practically impossible 
to find a large sample of subjects of exactly the same 
age. To overcome this difficulty investigators usually 
use the more involved technique of partial correlation. 
Since this technique was not used, the coefficients of 
correlation obtained in this investigation will tend to 
be slightly higher than they would be if the age factor 
were held constant.

CHAPTER III 


RELATED STUDIES 

Although prognosis is a common topic in educational 
literature the writer was able to find few studies com¬ 
paring the predictive value of the various intelligence 
tests at the junior high school level. Also, there was 
comparatively little research material on the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children or the California Achieve¬ 
ment Tests. This is not surprising when one realizes that 
these tests have been on the market for only a few years. 
However, numerous studies have shown that correlation 
coefficients between tested intelligence and later academ- 
ic achievement range from .40 to .60 . "If scores on a 
standardized achievement test are used in place of marks 
as the later criterion of academic success, the correla¬ 
tions are considerably higher.” ^ 

In a summary of the relationship between scores on 
mental ability tests and achievement in various subjects, 
Louttit ^ reported medians of the coefficients of correla¬ 
tion between intelligence test scores and ability in a 
number of school subjects as follows: reading .60, 
spelling .51, arithmetic .55, and handwriting *10 . 

Cohler ^ studied a group of superior children in 
grades 6, 7, and $ and found the correlation between 
mental age and achievement age to be .5& •

Aaron ^ in 1946 summarized the results of 24 studies 
which reported correlations between general high school 
achievement and a measure of intelligence. The correlations 
ranged from .25 to .65 with a median of .4$ . She con¬ 
cluded that the relationship between high school scholar¬ 
ship and intelligence measures at the present time was 
just about the same as when group mental tests were first 
used. 

7 

Jordan administered four mental tests to the same 
group and arrived at the following correlations with 
high school marks: Otis Intelligence .45, Terman Group .492, 
Army Alpha .476, Miller Mental Maturity .476 . 

d 

Adams showed that correlations between high school 
scholarship and intelligence tests given in the elementary 
grades are of similar magnitude. He used data derived 
from administering the National Intelligence Test to 
pupils in grades 4, 5, and 6. When these pupils reached 
college, Adams found that the I.Q. derived in the fourth 
grade correlated .46 with the high school average and 

.49 with the college freshman average. 

9 

Bailey made a study of the correlations between 
group mental tests, the Stanford-Binet, and the Pro¬ 
gressive Achievement test used in the Colorado Springs 
Elementary Schools. All mental tests from which informa¬ 
tion was used for correlations were given within a three- 
month period. Correlations were computed between the I.Q. T s 
and grade placements on the achievement tests by means of 
Pearson’s product-moment method. California Short-Form

Test of Mental Maturity vs Progressive Achievement grade 
placements produced the following coefficients of cor¬ 
relation: Grade 4, .62; Grade 5, .65; Grade 6, .66 . 

Median I.Q.’s for the tests were computed. It is interest¬ 
ing to note that the median Stanford-Binet I.Q. was 107.9 
and the median California Test of Mental Maturity I.Q. 
was 102.7 . 

Willis W. Clark ^ states that numerous studies have 
shown the positive correlations of achievement in basic 
skills with intelligence scores. These correlations, when 
corrected for normal range, are ordinarily in the vicin¬ 
ity of .70 . As an example, he gives the correlations 
obtained between scores on the Progressive Achievement 
Tests, Elementary Battery, Form A, for 300 pupils (100 
each in grades 4, 5, and 6) and mental ages obtained with 
the California Mental Maturity Test, Elementary Series. 

The coefficients of correlation are: Reading Vocabulary .74; 
Reading Comprehension . 76 ; Arithmetic Reasoning .73; 
Arithmetic Fundamentals .60; Total Language .52; Total 
Battery .84 . It is to be noted that this test does not 
measure the true quality of language but rather the 
mechanics of language including grammar and spelling. 

The coefficients of correlation given above are rel¬ 
atively higher than the ones obtained in the present 
investigation. The difference may be attributed to the 
"correction for normal range” which Clark used in com-

puting the coefficients of correlation. It is a known 
fact that when one deals with a select group the obtained 
coefficients of correlation tend to be lower than when 
a normal population is used. 

Grace Thompson Altus 11 administered the Wechsler 
Intelligence Scale for Children, California Test of 
Mental Maturity, and the Progressive Reading Test to a 
representative sample of 55 junior high school students. 
The coefficient of correlation between WISC Full Scale 
I.Q. and California Test of Mental Maturity I.Q. was .Si, 
holding age constant. The coefficient of correlation 
between WISC Verbal I.Q. and Progressive Reading Test 
grade placement was .S 3 , holding age constant. She con¬ 
cludes that the WISC is valid in comparable school 
settings. 

12 

Bolton used the semester marks of 212 senior 
high school students and four I.Q. f s to determine the 
best predictor of scholastic achievement. His study 
revealed that the Terman-McNemar I.Q. was the most 
effective predictor with the Otis-Quick Scoring, Califor¬ 
nia Mental Maturity Verbal, and California Mental Matur¬ 
ity Non-Verbal I.Q.’s following in the order named. 

13 

Dr. Alfred S. Lewerenz made a comprehensive study 
of the data for five different intelligence tests admin¬ 
istered to 2S4 twelfth grade students at South Gate High 
School, Los Angeles.

The Terman-McNemar raw scores gave a relatively 
high correlation with reading vocabulary raw scores, a 
fairly high correlation with arithmetic reasoning and 
reading comprehension raw scores, and a lower correlation 
with arithmetic fundamentals raw scores. 

From the tables it is apparent that the Otis Test 
had the highest correlations with mathematics achievement, 
while the Terman-McNemar Test had the highest correlations 
with reading achievement. 

Lewerenz concludes that the Terman-McNemar Test is 
the most consistent measure of the five intelligence 
tests used. "This is shown by its having (1) the highest 
raw score correlations with grade point average, (2) the 
highest correlations with reading vocabulary and comprehen¬ 
sion, (3) the mean score closest to the average mean, and 
( 4 ) the closest decile scores to deciles of the averages 
of the three tests. T! ^

Cyril Burt conducted a study of 300 pupils of 
ages between 7 and 14 years. Between scholastic attain¬ 
ment and Binet mental age he obtained a correlation of 
•91* This unusually high correlation was due to the wide 
range in ages. When he used partial correlation to keep 
the age factor constant, the correlation was reduced to 
.63. 

Willis W. Clark ^ presents data for 1172 eleventh 
grade pupils who had been given the Progressive Achieve¬ 
ment Test, Advanced Battery and the California Test of 
Mental maturity, Advanced Series. The correlations 
obtained are: reading vocabulary . 6 $; reading comprehen¬ 
sion . 70 ; mathematical reasoning .63; mathematical fund¬ 
amentals .53; language .4$; total battery .71. The low 
language correlation is most likely due to the apparent 
weakness of the Language test which does not measure the 
true quality of language. 

22 

In 1931 Turney and Fee conducted an investigation 
to determine the comparative value of five group mental 
tests used in the junior high school. In this study 190 
grade seven pupils were used. The tests used were: 

1. The Terman Group Test of Mental Ability, Form B. 

2. Haggerty Intelligence Examination, Delta II. 

3 . McCall Multi-mental Scale. 

4* National Intelligence Test, Scale A, Form I. 

5. Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability 
Intermediate Examination, Form B.

The group mental tests were administered in May, 

1931 and the Stanford Achievement Tests were given 
during the first week in September, 1931. Other data 
used as criteria were the semester letter marks for each 
pupil assigned by the teachers of reading, of arithmetic, 
and of social science. 

Table VI gives a summary of the medians, standard 
deviations, and arithmetic means of the intelligence 
quotients obtained by the various tests.

M Assuming that the median intelligence quotient of 
the Stanford-Binet may serve as a criterion in determining 
the discrimination and validity of the five tests, they 
may be ranked according to the deviation of the median 
intelligence quotients from it as follows: 1. Terman, 

2. Otis, 3 . National, 4 . McCall, 5. Haggerty." 2 ^ 

If we assume that a smaller standard deviation is 
more discriminatory, then the Terman test would rank first 
among the group tests. It is to be noted, however, that

the Stanford-Binet standard deviation is smaller than any 
of the group test standard deviations. It is surprising 
to note that the Otis test ranks last on the basis of 
this criterion. 

25 

Turney and Fee ' conclude that on the basis of 29 
criteria of discrimination and validity, all of which did 
not have equal value, the tests ranked as follows: 

1. Otis 

2. Terman 

3. Haggerty Delta II

CHAPTER IV 


THE QUALITY OF THE TESTING INSTRUMENTS 
I. INTRODUCTION 

Not all published tests are good tests, "Despite 
the great progress in psychological testing since 
World War I, the variety of characteristics which can 
be measured still leaves a great deal to be desired. 

The measuring instruments we now use even for the most 
adequately measured traits such as intelligence and 
vocational interest are still crude and half-understood. 

II. TESTING INSTRUMENTS 

THE WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN 

The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, or 

the WISC as it is commonly called, was published in 1949 

27 

According to Richards, the widely used Revised Stan¬ 
ford - Binet Scale tends to be weighted with verbal 
items and has been found to be discriminatory in cases 
where there is evidence of poor schooling, linguistic 
handicap, or reading disability. Because this is rather 
serious criticism David Wechsler, clinical psychologist 
at New York’s Bellevue Hospital, constructed a test 
which seemed more appropriate to his needs. The Wech¬ 
sler - Bellevue Scale provided some means of revealing 
more about the pattern of an individual’s mental

functioning. With verbal and performance abilities 
weighted equally, it is now possible to calculate a 
Verbal, a Performance, and a Full Scale I.Q. for each 
subject• 

The Adult Scales earned such a favorable reception 

that the author decided to construct a similar test for 

younger subjects. This new battery, the WISC, is made up 

largely of items taken from Form II of the Adult Scales. 

The main additions are new items at the easier end of 

each subtest to permit examination of children as young 

as five years of age. Wechsler contrasts the Bellevue 

Scales and the WISC as follows - 

Even though the materials overlap, the WISC 
is a distinct test from the Wechsler-Bellevue 
Scales, and is independently standardized. 

The directions for presenting and the stan¬ 
dards for scoring and assignment of weights 
and bonuses are quite different. 

The WISC is different from other individual tests 
of intelligence in several important ways. ff One of the 
most important innovations in the standardization of 
the WISC, n states Wechsler, n± s that, for the first 
time in a comprehensive individually administered bat¬ 
tery for use with children, I.Q.’s are obtained by com¬ 
paring each subject’s test performance not with a com¬ 
posite age group but exclusively with the scores earned 
by individuals in a single age group. 11 Each person is 
assigned an I.Q. which, at his age, represents his rel¬ 
ative intelligence rating. This assigned intelligence 
quotient is a deviation I.Q. since it indicates the

degree by which a student deviates above or below 
the average performance of individuals of his own age 
group. The I.Q. of 100 on the WISC is set equal to 
the mean total score for each age, and the standard 
deviation is set equal to 15 I.Q. points. This arrange¬ 
ment, Wechsler claims, will produce I.Q. f s which, on 
the whole, are fairly close numerically to I.Q.’s of 
other well-standardized tests like the Stanford - 
Binet. 

The WISC is composed of twelve subtests of which 
six are classified as Verbal, and six as Performance. 

The Verbal Scale includes tests of Information, Com¬ 
prehension, Arithmetic, Similarities, Vocabulary, and 
Digit Span. The Performance subtest include Picture 
Completion, Picture Arrangement, Block Design, Object 
Assembly, Coding, and Mazes. Ordinarily only five 
Verbal and five Performance tests are administered to 
the subject and the intelligence quotient is calculated 
on this basis. The subtests Digit Span and Mazes are 
usually omitted because of their low correlations with 
the other tests of the scale. While it is permissible 
to give all subtests, the total weighted scores obtained 
require prorating before the I.Q. f s may be computed 
from the tables.

THE OTIS QUICK - SCORING MENTAL ABILITY TEST 

The Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Tests com¬ 
prise three tests - Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. The Beta 
test is a modification of the Intermediate Otis Self- 
Administering Test. It is used in grades four to nine. 
Kuder states that "Otis tests are among the easiest and 
most economical to score." 

Otis points out that "a measure of brightness 
comparable to the I.Q. can be found from scores obtained 
on the Beta Test." 3^ Although these measures are not 
quotients he calls them Beta I.Q.’s because they are com¬ 
parable to I.Q.’s obtained from other tests. 

One common measure of the reliability of a test is 

the coefficient of correlation between the different forms 

of the test. The coefficients of correlation between Forms 

A and B in grades four to nine range from .65 to .9& with 
^ 32 

an average of .79 . 

Otis suggests that the most appropriate criterion of 
the validity of the Beta Test is the actual rate of pro¬ 
gress of pupils through school. "This criterion was used 
in the standardization of the Otis Intermediate Examin¬ 
ation, from which most of the items of the Beta Test were 
taken." 33

THE HENMON - NELSON TEST OF MENTAL ABILITY 

The Henmon-Nelson Tests of Mental Abilty, High 
School, are used in grades seven to twelve. This test 

o I 

is available in three forms - A, B, and C. Anastasi * 
states that this test serves the need for a preliminary- 
rapid exploration and rough classification. 

The average reliability coefficient reported by the 
authors is .&9 for grades 7, 8, and 9* ^ The split- 
half method and the Spearman-Brown correction formula 
were used to determine the reliability coefficient of 
the test which is timed for thirty minutes. According to 
Cronbach ^ this method will produce a spurious coef¬ 
ficient when applied to an intelligence test which is a 
speed test. 

This test is provided with the Clapp-Young self¬ 
marking device which simplifies scoring. 

THE TERMAN - MCNEMAR TEST OF MENTAL ABILITY 

The third group intelligence test used in the present 
investigation was the Terman-McNemar Test of Mental Ability, 
Form C. This revised version of the popular Terman Group 
Test of Mental Ability is designed for use in grades 7 
through 12. There are two forms, C and D, each composed 
of seven subtests - Information, Synonyms, Logical 
Selection, Classification, Analogies, Opposites and Best 
Answers.

R.L. Thorndike in reviewing this test stated that 

"restriction to verbal materials has had the effect of 

37 

narrowing and purifying the function measured." 

"The split-half reliability coefficient for the Terman- 

McNemar Test of Mental Ability was .96 when determined 

on 279 cases in grades 7 through 9 in Portsmouth, New 

Hampshire. The inter-form reliability (between Forms C 

and D) was .95 when determined on 239 cases in grades 

7 and 9 in Concord, New Hampshire." ^ The validity of 

the revised test is based on the correlation obtained 

between the revised test and the original test which 

had such a long and successful usage. This correlation 

39 

coefficient is reported as .91 by the authors. 

The Terman-McNemar I.Q. is a deviation I.Q. based 
on the degree of deviation of the subject’s obtained 
raw score from the norm of his age group. A simple device 
is used to obtain the I.Q. directly from the raw score 
tables. 

THE CALIFORNIA ACHIEVEMENT TEST BATTERY 

The California Achievement Test Battery, Inter¬ 
mediate Form BB, was used to determine the academic 
achievement of the pupils included in this investigation. 
These tests replaced the Progressive Achievement Tests 
which, according to Witty, "had excellent diagnostic

features and conformed with the best practices in test 
construction and standardization.” ^ 

The California Achievement Tests are "standardized 
and each item has been selected for its diagnostic value 
in measuring achievement in one hundred two essential 
elements of reading, arithmetic, and language skills.” ^ 
There are four equivalent forms at each of the four 
levels - Primary, Elementary, Intermediate, and Advanced. 
A Diagnostic Profile and a Diagnostic Analysis of Learn¬ 
ing Difficulties are special features of these tests. 

The Profile reveals graphically the student’s achieve¬ 
ment in terms of grade placement and age without compu¬ 
tation. The Analysis of Learning Difficulties provides 
a basis for remedial work. 

Each of the forms at the intermediate level consists 
of three tests - Reading, Arithmetic, and Language. The 
Reading test consists of Reading Vocabulary and Reading 
Comprehension; the Arithmetic Test consists of Arith¬ 
metic Reasoning and Arithmetic Fundamentals; and the 
Language Test consists of Mechanics of English and Gram¬ 
mar, and Spelling. 

The coefficients of reliability reported by the 

authors range from .35 for Spelling to .97 for the Total 

42 

Test (Complete Intermediate Battery). Although no 
figures are given in the manual the authors claim that 
the tests possess a high degree of validity. ’’Many

studies have been made of the individual test items in 
the various tests under a wide variety of conditions. 

With few exceptions, the value of the individual items 
has been repeatedly vindicated, and they have been re¬ 
tained in the tests.” ^ 

As suggested by the authors, the tests are narrow 
in scope because they f, measure some of the most tangible 
and easily identifiable objectives of the curriculum.” ^ 
With reference to the Language Test it should be noted 
that this is a narrow test of skills rather than a test 
of quality of language achievement. The method of scoring 
tends to make the Language score questionable. The fact 
that over-capitalization and over-punctuation are not 
penalized casts a feeling of doubt as to the validity of 
a subject’s score on the Mechanics of Englidh. The Spelling 
Test also contains an element of guessing. It consists 
of thirty sets of four words each. The student must 
decide which, if any, of the four is misspelled in each 
set. Under such conditions the resultant Language score 
would necessarily present a different picture from that 
obtained by analyzing and evaluating actual pupil lan¬ 
guage responses. 

Although it is understood that the various tests 
are imperfect it does not mean that they are to be aban¬ 
doned. ”Tests provide facts which help us understand 
people. They almost never are a mechanical tool which

available, its use will generally save time and obtain

be kept in mind that most tests are narrow in scope and 
that the test results present only a portion of the true 
picture.

CHAPTER V 


ACHIEVEMENT IN READING 

I. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO READING VOCABULARY 

In the present study achievement in reading is 
based on two component raw scores obtained on the 
California Reading Test. The California Reading Test 
has two subtests, namely, Reading Vocabulary, and Reading 
Comprehension. 

The Reading Vocabulary test is composed of 1$0 words 
which must be properly identified. In each case the 
identification of the key word is made by matching it with 
a word of the opposite meaning selected from the four list¬ 
ed. The test is divided into four sections: Mathematics, 
Science, Social Science, and General Vocabulary. 

Table VII gives the coefficients of correlation of 
intelligence quotients with Reading Vocabulary scores.

"The value of r as a measure of correspondence may¬ 
be profitably considered from two points of view. In 
the first place, r*s are computed in order to determine 
whether there is any correlation (over and above chance) 
between two variables; and in the second place, r f s are 
computed in order to determine the degree of closeness 
of relationship when some association is known, or is 
assumed, to exist." ^ 

An r of .30 between WXSC Performance I.Q. and Reading 
Vocabulary raw score indicates a slight correlation which 
is inadequate for individual prediction. "The correlation 
must be #70 or more between measures of general intelli¬ 
gence and school grades or between achievement in English 
and in history to be considered high, since r’s in this 
field usually run from .40 to . 60 ." ^ it is to be noted 
that "a correlation of #50 permits predictions only 
slightly better than guessing." ^ Consequently, the r 
which is to be used in predicting the scores of individuals 
should be much higher than the r, the purpose of which is 
to forecast the achievement of a selected group. Since 
the r f s given in the above table are not relatively high 
their use in individual prediction is limited. However, 
with the exception of the WISC Performance I.Q., the I.Q. 
scores could be used as adequate predictors of class 
achievement in Reading Vocabulary at the junior high school

The coefficients of correlation are relatively 
significant. With the exception of the WISC Performance 

I. Q. the r’s are significant at the .01 level. This 
means that only once in 100 trials would an r numerically 
larger than a given value appear by accidents of sampling 
if the population r were actually . 00 . We conclude then 
that the obtained r is very significant. 

The Terman-McNemar I.Q. appears to be the best 
predictor of Reading Vocabulary raw score at the junior 
high school level. The next best predictor is the WISC 
Verbal I.Q. Of the group intelligence tests used in this 
investigation, the Henmon-Nelson seems to be the weakest 
predictor of Reading Vocabulary raw scores. 

II. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO READING COMPREHENSION 

The Reading Comprehension Test is divided into three 
sections, namely, Following Directions, Reference Skills, 
and Interpretation of Meanings. The multiple choice method 
is used to test the development of skill in silent reading 
comprehension in each of the above mentioned sections.

intelligence quotients with Reading Comprehension raw

WISC I.Q. f s appear to be better predictors of Reading 
Comprehension than of Reading Vocabulary. This improve¬ 
ment in prediction does not apply to the group tests. 

The coefficients of correlation are all significant 
at the .01 level. In each case we may be highly confident 
that the true r is not zero. 

The WISC Verbal I.Q. appears to be the best predictor 
of Reading Comprehension raw scores. The WISC Full Scale

tors. The WISC Performance and Henmon-Nelson I.Q. f s are 
relative!y the weakest predictors of Reading Comprehension 
raw scores at the junior high school level.

CHAPTER VI 


ACHIEVEMENT IN ARITHMETIC 

I. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO ARITHMETIC REASONING 
In the present investigation the achievement in 
Arithmetic of the sample of junior high school pupils 
results from the administration of the California 
Arithmetic Achievement Test which yields scores in 
Arithmetic Reasoning and Arithmetic Fundamentals. 

The Arithmetic Reasoning score is a composite score 
consisting of scores on Number Concepts, Symbols and Rules, 
Numbers and Equations, and Problems. The test is of the 
multiple-choice type designed to reveal the presence or 
absence of essential mathematical knowledge. 

Table IX gives the coefficients of correlation of 
intelligence quotients with Arithmetic Reasoning raw 
scores•

In Table IX all the coefficients of correlation 
are positive and range from .21 to .36. We may conclude 
that there is a slight correlation between I.Q.’s and 
Arithmetic Reasoning raw scores obtained in the present 
investigation. It is to be noted that there is definitely 
a lower relationship between I.Q. f s and Arithmetic Reason¬ 
ing raw scores than between I.Q. f s and either of the Reading 
raw scores. 

With the exception of the WISC Performance and the 
Henmon-Nelson r T s, the coefficients of correlation depart 
significantly from zero at the .01 level. This means that 
the obtained r f s could not be attributed to sampling errors 
at the risk of being wrong once in 100 trials. 

The WISC Verbal, WISC Full Scale, and Terman-McNemar 
I.Q. T s appear to be the best predictors of Arithmetic 
Reasoning raw scores at the junior high school level. The 
Henmon-Nelson I.Q. is definitely the weakest predictor of 
Arithmetic Reasoning raw scores. It is to be noted that 
the Otis Beta I.Q. with an r of .26 is more significant 
than the WISC Performance I.Q. with an r of .31. The 
explanation lies in the fact that as the number of cases 
is increased an r does not need to be as high in order to 
be significant. 

It is interesting to note that the WISC Full Scale 
coefficient of correlation was higher than the WISC Verbal

coefficient of correlation. This was not so in the case 
of the two Reading tests. There the WISC Performance 
subtests tended to lower the WISC Full Scale coefficients 
of correlation. 

II. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO ARITHMETIC FUNDAMENTALS 

The Arithmetic Fundamentals test consists of four 
sections - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and 
Division. The test is of the multiple-choice type designed 
to test the mastery of the essential fundamental processes. 

Table X gives the coefficients of correlation of 
intelligence quotients versus Arithmetic Fundamentals raw 
scores.

that there is slight to substantial relationship between 
intelligence quotients and Arithmetic Fundamentals raw 
scores. It would appear that there is definitely a 
greater relationship between the I.Q.'s and Arithmetic 
Fundamentals raw scores than between I.Q.’s and Arithmetic 
Reasoning raw scores. However, the degree of relation¬ 
ship does not approach that reached by the I.Q.’s and 
the two Reading tests. The three WISC I.Q.’s indicate a 
marked increase in the prediction of Arithmetic Fundamen¬ 
tals raw scores. This increase in prediction is not as 
obvious in the case of the three group test I.Q. f s. 

The WISC Full Scale I.Q. appears to be the best 
predictor of Arithmetic Fundamentals raw scores at the 
junior high school level. It is very interesting to note 
that the WISC Verbal I.Q. and the WISC Performance I.Q. 
are equally good predictors in this case. Here again the 
Henmon-Nelson I.Q. is the weakest predictor. The Terman- 
McNemar I.Q. is the best predictor among the group test 
I.Q. f s but it does not predict Arithmetic Fundamentals 
raw scores nearly as well as the WISC I.Q. T s. 

It is to be noted that all the coefficients of 
correlation are significantly different from zero at the 
.01 level. The larger sample used with the group tests 
was responsible for raising the significance of the low 
coefficients of correlation.

The WISC Performance subtests seemed to increase the 
predictive value of the WISC Full Scale I.Q. This 
increase is more obvious in the case of Arithmetic Funda¬ 
mentals raw scores than that of Arithmetic Reasoning. 

This relationship may be due to the nature of the Arith¬ 
metic tests which did not include involved mathematical 
problems. 

III. CONCLUSIONS 

1. There is slight, positive correlation between intelli¬ 
gence quotients and Arithmetic Reasoning raw scores. 
The coefficients of correlation range from .21 to . 36 . 

2. There is a higher relationship between intelligence 
quotients and Arithmetic Fundamentals raw scores. The 
coefficients of correlation range from .26 to . 52 . 

3 . The relationship between the intelligence quotients 
and the two Arithmetic raw scores is not as high as 
the relationship between the intelligence quotients 
and the two Reading raw scores. 

4. All but two coefficients are significant at the .01 
level. The coefficients of correlation between 
Arithmetic Reasoning raw scores and each of WISC 
Performance and Henmon-Nelson I.Q.’s are significant 
at the .05 level. 

5. The WISC Verbal, WISC Full Scale, and Terman-McNemar 
I.Q.’s appear to be the best predictors of Arithmetic

CHAPTER VII 


ACHIEVEMENT IN LANGUAGE 

I. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO SPELLING 

The achievement in Language of the sample of junior 
high school pupils used in the present investigation 
results from the administration of the California Language 
Achievement test which yields scores in Spelling, Mechanics 
of English and Grammar, and Total Language. 

The Spelling test consists of thirty sets of four 
words each. The pupil must identify the misspelled word 
if there is one. If there is no misspelled word the pupil 
is asked to mark the answer "None". This portion of the 
Language test differs most from the Progressive Language 
Achievement Test in that the words are not dictated by the 
examiner and the pupil is not required to write the words. 

Table XI gives the coefficients of correlation of 
intelligence quotients with Spelling raw scores.

In Table XI all the coefficients of correlation are 
positive and range from .37 to .54. From this we may 
conclude that there is a substantial relationship between 
intelligence quotients and Spelling raw scores. 

All the coefficients of correlation are significantly 
different from zero at the .01 level. 

The Terman-McNemar I.Q. appears to be the best 
predictor of Spelling raw scores at the junior high school 
level. It is interesting to note that the WISC I.Q. f s 
are relatively weaker predictors of Spelling raw scores. 

The weakest predictor in this case is the WISC Performance 

I. Q. The Henmon-Nelson I.Q. is the weakest of the group 
test I.Q.’s but it equals the best WISC I.Q. which is the 
WISC Full Scale I.Q. 

II. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE TO MECHANICS OF ENGLISH 

The Mechanics of English and Grammar subtest consists 
of four sections - Capitalization, Punctuation, Words and 
Sentences, and Parts of Speech. The test is designed to 
measure objectively a student*s knowledge of the mechanical 
elements of language. The test does not include any original 
or creative writing. It is essentially a test of the 
narrower aspects of language. Another apparent weakness of 
the California Language Achievement test is the method of 
scoring. There is no penalty for over-capitalization or 
over-punctuation. "Although there are 20 numbers in this

test, only 10 punctuation marks are actually needed. When 
the student marks the test correctly, he marks 10 N f s which 
indicate points at which no punctuation is needed. When 
the test is scored, either by hand or machine-scoring 
stencil, the N T s are ignored and credit is given only for 
the correct punctuation marks. There is no penalty for 
over-punctuation, ordinarily indicated by too few marks in 
the N column and too many in the other columns. tT 

Table XII gives the coefficients of correlation of 
intelligence quotients with Mechanics of English raw scores.

In Table XII all the coefficients of correlation are

conclude that therelationship between intelligence 
quotients and Mechanics of English raw scores at the junior 
high school level ranges from negligible to substantial. 

The WISC I.Q. T s produced coefficients of correlation 
which were less significant than those produced by the

group test I.Q.’s. The sole insignificant coefficient 
of correlation in the present investigation occurred in 
the correlation of the WISC Performance I.Q. and the 
Mechanics of English raw scores. On the assumption that 
the true r in the population is zero, the obtained r of 
.14 could be attributed to errors of sampling, and hence 
is not significant. It is to be noted that the relatively 
low coefficient of correlation produced by the Otis Beta 
I.Q. is highly significant because of the larger sample. 

In fact all the coefficients of correlation produced by 
the group test I.Q.’s are significant at the .01 level. 

From the Table it appears that the Terman-McNemar 
I.Q. is the best predictor of Mechanics of English raw 
scores at the junior high school level. The Henmon-Nelson 
I.Q. is in second place although it is considerably weaker 
as a predictor of Mechanics of English raw scores* It is 
interesting to note that the WISC Verbal I.Q. practically 
equals the predictive value of the Henmon-Nelson I.Q. and 
that the WISC Full Scale I.Q. is weakened considerably by 
the Performance subtests. The WISC Performance I.Q. has 
no practical predictive value in this case. 

III. RELATION OF INTELLIGENCE AND TOTAL LANGUAGE 

The Total Language score is made up of Spelling and 
Mechanics of English scores. As was pointed out earlier,

the California Language Achievement test does not test 
the broader aspects of language but the drill or mechanical 
elements of language. This apparent weakness is further 
increased by the method of scoring which does not penalize 
over-punctuation or over-capitalization.

intelligence quotients and Total Language raw scores.

In Table XIII all the coefficients of correlation are

conclude that there is generally a substantial relation¬ 
ship between intelligence quotients and Total Language raw 
scores at the junior high school level. 

All except one coefficient of correlation was highly 
significant at the .01 level. The WISC Performance I.Q. 
produced a coefficient of correlation significant at the 
.05 level. This means that an r of size .31 could occur 
five times in 100 trials due to errors in sampling.

The Terraan-McNemar appears to be the best predictor 
of Total Language raw scores at the junior high school 
level. The correlation obtained is not as high as one 
would expect. This could be attributed to the nature of 
the Language test used. It is interesting to note that 
the remaining I.Q.’s, with the exception of the WISC 
Performance I.Q., are practically equal in their prediction 
of Total Language raw scores. The WISC Performance I.Q. 
is the weakest predictor of Total Language raw scores in 
the junior high school. 

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

1. The coefficients of correlation of intelligence 
quotients with Spelling raw scores range from .37 

to .54 indicating that generally there is a substantial 
relationship between intelligence quotients and Spelling 
raw scores at the junior high school level. 

2. The Terman-McNemar and Otis Beta I.Q. T s appear to be 
the best predictors of Spelling raw scores. 

3 . The WISC I.Q. f s are slightly inferior to the group 
test I.Q.'s in predicting Spelling raw scores. 

4. -The coefficients of correlation of intelligence quotients 

with Mechanics of English and Grammar raw scores range 
from .14 to .41 indicating a relative weakness in the 
relationship between these scores at the junior high 
school level.

high school level. 

9. The Terman-McNemar I.Q. appears to be the best predictor 
of Total Language raw scores. 

10. The WISC I.Q.'s, with the exception of the Performance

test I.Q. ! s in predicting Total Language raw scores.

predictor of Total Language raw scores in the junior 
high school.

CHAPTER VIII 


AN 

ANALYSIS 

OF 

THE EFFICIENCY 

OF PREDICTORS 

I. 

RELATION 

OF 

INTELLIGENCE TO 

ACHIEVEMENT 


In spite of the greatest care in standardization, 

different intelligence tests yield different I.Q. T s. 

Nevertheless, the I.Q. T s obtained from standardized 

intelligence tests are more reliable and valid than the 

teacher 1 s judgment of pupil ability. "While in general 

pupils with higher I.Q. T s receive better marks than pupils 

with lower I.Q. f s, the fact remains that a few pupils with 

low I.Q.’s do excellent work, while some with relatively 

50 

higher I.Q.’s fail." There is little doubt that person¬ 
ality factors play an important role in scholastic achieve 
ment. Thus the mere knowledge of a pupil T s I.Q. does not 
reveal accurately to the teacher what any student will 
achieve. Although this may be true in individual guidance 
whenever class averages are used prediction of class 
achievement is more reliable. 

Table XIV gives a summary of the coefficients of 
correlation obtained between intelligence quotients and 
California Achievement Battery Total raw scores.

In Table XIV all the coefficients of correlation 
are positive and range from .41 to .53. From this we may 
conclude that there is substantial relationship between 
intelligence quotients and academic achievement as measured 
by the California Achievement Test Battery Total raw scores. 

The coefficients of correlation in each case depart 
significantly from zero at the .01 level. 

The Terman-McNemar I.Q. appears to be the best 
predictor of Battery Total raw scores. It is interesting 
to note that the coefficient of correlation in this case 
(r = . 58 ) approaches the highest coefficient of correlation 
obtained in correlating intelligence quotients with 
achievement test raw scores. The highest coefficient of 
correlation (r = .61) was obtained between Terman-McNemar 
I.Q. and Reading Vocabulary raw score. 

The WISC Verbal and WISC Full Scale I.Q.’s are almost 
tied for second place in predicting Battery Total raw 
scores. 

The Terman-McNemar I.Q. is definitely superior to 
both the Otis Beta and Henmon-Nelson I.Q.’s in predicting 
Battery Total raw scores at the junior high school level. 

The Otis Beta I.Q. does not appear to have any practical 
superiority over the Henmon-Nelson I.Q. in predicting 
Battery Total raw score. 

The WISC Performance I.Q., although the weakest 
predictor of Battery Total raw score, is practically tied 
with the Henmon-Nelson I.Q.

Kendall deals with the problem of tied ranks by 
employing what he calls the TT mid-rank method". "When 
there is nothing to choose between individuals, we must 
clearly rank them all alike if we rank them at all; and 
our method has the advantage that the sum of the ranks 
for all members remains the same as for an untied rank¬ 
ing. "51 There are two instances where tied coefficients 
of correlation occur - WISC Full Scale and Henmon-Nelson 
I.Q.’s produced equal coefficients of correlation with 
Spelling raw scores; and Otis Beta and Henmon-Nelson I.Q.’s 
produced tied coefficients of correlation with Total 
Language raw scores• 

One way of determining the relative effectiveness 
of the various intelligence quotients would be to compare 
the sums of rank order. The lower the sum the more 
effective the predictor would be. From Table XIV the 
best possible predictor w ould have a sum of eight; the 
weakest possible predictor would have a sum of forty-eight• 

Table XVI gives the relative effectiveness of the 
various predictors based on the sum of rank order as 
indicated in Table XV.

predictor. It is to be noted that the WISC Full Scale 
and WISC Verbal I.Q.’s are closely related and are both 
more effective predictors than the Otis 3eta I.Q. The 
Henmon-Nelson I.Q. is in second-last place being decided¬ 
ly superior to the WISG Performance I.Q. as an effective 
predictor of achievement raw scores in the junior high 
school.

CHAPTER IX 


INTERCORRELATIONS OF INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS 

I. VARIATIONS IN INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS 

Intelligence cannot be measured directly. "Intelli- 
gence tests generally give heaviest weight to two aptitudes, 
verbal comprehension and abstract reasoning. Other apti¬ 
tudes are typically included, but the ones included and 
the extent to which they are stressed depends upon the 
content and construction of the particular test. Differ¬ 
ences between results on various tests of intelligence 
can be explained in these terras .”^ 2 It is commonly assumed 
that all students have had approximately the same opportu¬ 
nity to learn, and differences in intelligence are inferred 
from differences in success on the test. In spite of the 
greatest care in standardization, different tests will 
yield different intelligence quotients for the same pupil. 

It is desirable, therefore, to make comparisons between 
the various tests. 

II. CORRELATION OF INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS 

In addition to the main investigation, the various 
intelligence quotients were correlated. Table XVII shows 
the coefficients of correlation between certain group 
intelligence quotients and the three WISC intelligence 
quotients.

(All the above coefficients of c orrelation are significant

In Table XVII the coefficients of correlation range 
from .62 to .32 indicating that there is a fairly high 
relationship between the WISC I.Q. f s and the three group 
test I.Q. T s. Although the sample is not very large, the 
obtained coefficients of c orrelation are all significantly 
different from zero at the .01 level. 

The Terman-McNemar I.Q. has the highest degree of 
relationship with the WISC I.Q. f s. It is interesting to 
note that although the Performance subtests seem to cause 
a relatively lower relationship with the Terman-McNemar 
I.Q., the WISC Full Scale I.Q. indicates a higher degree 
of relationship with the Terman-McNemar I.Q. Since the 
Terman-McNemar Mental Test is considered to be a verbal 
test, it was rather surprising not to find a higher 
coefficient of correlation between the WISC Verbal I.Q. 


and Terman-McNemar I.Q

The Otis Beta I.Q. seems to be in second place as far 
as the over-all relationship with the WISC I.Q. T s is 
concerned. As in the case of the Terman-McNemar I.Q. the 
Otis Beta I.Q. and the WISC Full Scale I.Q. tend to show 
a higher correlation than the WISC Verbal I.Q. and Otis 
Beta I.Q. The Otis Beta I.Q. produced a relatively high 
coefficient of correlation with the WISC Full Scale I.Q. 

In the case of the Henmon-Nelson I.Q. we find a 
somewhat different situation. Here the coefficient of 
correlation between the WISC Verbal I.Q.’s and the Henmon- 
Nelson I.Q. T s is higher than the coefficient of correla¬ 
tion between WISC Full Scale I.Q.’s and Henmon-Nelson 
I.Q. T s. Although the Henmon-Nelson l.Q.’s appear to show 
as high a correlation with the WISC Verbal I.Q.’s as do 
the Terman-McNemar I.Q.’s, they do not show as good a 
correlation as the other group test I.Q. ! s when it comes 
to WISC Performance I.Q. 1 s or WISC Full Scale I.Q. T s. On 
this basis we may conclude that the Henmon-Nelson I.Q.’s 
appear to show relatively less correlation with the WISC 
I.Q. 1 s. 

We may further conclude that the Otis Beta I.Q., 
the Terman-McNemar I.Q., and the WISC Full Scale I.Q. 
could practically be interchanged at the junior high level. 
Also, the Henmon-Nelson I.Q., the Terman-McNemar I.Q., and 
the WISC Verbal I.Q. could be interchanged since they show 
a high degree of correlation.

CHAPTER X 


CONCLUSIONS 

The purpose of this investigation was to compare 
the predictive value of certain intelligence tests used 
in the junior high schools, A summary of conclusions 
follows. 

1# There is a substantial relationship between in¬ 
telligence quotients and academic achievement in the 
junior high school. The coefficients of correlation for 

I.Q. ! s versus the various total raw scores of the sub¬ 
tests of the California Achievement Battery range from 
.14 to .61 with an arithmetical mean of .50 . 

2. The Terman-McNemar Test of Mental Ability appears 
to be superior to both the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental 
Ability Test and the Henmon-Nelson Test of Mental Ability 
in predicting academic achievement as measured by the 
raw scores of the California Achievement Test, Inter¬ 
mediate Battery. The coefficients of correlation between 
intelligence and achievement for the group intelligence 
tests were: Terman-McNemar .53, Otis Beta .47, and 
Henmon-Nelson .43 • 

3. The use of WISC Full Scale I.Q. as predictor of 
academic achievement in junior high schools seems justi¬ 
fiable . The WISC Full Scale I.Q. T s produced coefficients 
of correlation ranging from .26 to .56 with an arithmet¬ 
ical mean of .45 .

4. The WISC Full Scale I.Q. is superior to all 
group test I.Q.’s in predicting Arithmetic Fundamentals 
raw scores (r = .52) . 

5. The Terman-McNemar I.Q. is superior to all the 
I.Q. f s used in predicting Reading Vocabulary raw scores 
(r s .61), Total Language raw scores (r = .43), and 
Achievement Battery Total raw scores (r = .53) . 

6. The WISC Verbal I.Q. is the best predictor of 
Reading Comprehension raw scores (r = ,60) . 

7# The WISC Verbal I.Q. is better than the Otis 
Beta I.Q. in predicting all of the achievement subtest 
raw scores except Spelling. 

3. The WISC Verbal I.Q. is a better predictor than 
the Henmon-Nelson I.Q. in all cases except Spelling, and 
Mechanics of English and Grammar raw scores. 

9. The WISC Verbal I.Q. is superior to the Terman- 
McNemar I.Q. in predicting the Reading Comprehension and 
Arithmetic Fundamentals raw scores. 

10. The WISC Performance I.Q. is the weakest pre¬ 
dictor in all cases except Arithmetic Fundamentals and 
Arithmetic Reasoning raw scores. 

11. The WISC Performance I.Q. appears to be a 
better predictor than the Otis Beta I.Q. and the Henmon- 
Nelson I.Q. in the case of Arithmetic Reasoning and 
Arithmetic Fundamentals raw scores.

12. The WISC Performance I.Q. seems to be a better 
predictor than the Terman-McNemar I.Q. in the case of 
Arithmetic Fundamentals raw scores. 

13. The WISC Full Scale I.Q. is a better predictor 
than the Otis Beta I.Q. and the Henmon-Nelson I.Q. in 
all cases except Spelling, and Mechanics of English and 
Grammar raw scores. 

14# The Otis Beta I.Q. is a better predictor than 
the Henmon-Nelson I.Q. in all cases except Mechanics of 
English and Grammar, and Total Language raw scores. 

15. The Henmon-Nelson I.Q. is relatively the weak¬ 
est predictor among the group test I.Q.’s used in this 
investigation. 

16. The Terman-McNemar I.Q. appears to have the 
greatest relationship with the WISC I.Q.*s. 

17® The Henmon-Nelson seems to have the least 
relationship with the WISC I.Q. T s. 

From the above conclusions it is quite obvious 
that no one intelligence quotient has proven to be 
outstanding in predicting academic achievement in the 
junior high school. It appears, however, that the 
Terman-McNemar I.Q. is the most successful predictor in 
this investigation. This finding is noteworthy in that 
it is similar to the findings of Bolton 53 and Lewerenz 5^ 
in their investigations of intelligence tests at the 
senior high school level.
