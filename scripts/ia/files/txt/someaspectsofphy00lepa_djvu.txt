INTRODUCTION 


Studies in recent years have shown the prevalence of 
variable degrees of vitamin A deficiency in the population. 
Such deficiencies are conveniently detected and measured by 
visual adaptation tests, such as that described by Pett (17)• 
The work here reported arose as part of investigations on 
vitamin A being carried out by Pett, with his visual adaptat¬ 
ion apparatus. 

Por the problems in hand, it was first necessary to 
obtain or develop a reliable method for the estimation of 
vitamin A in blood plasma. This method is described in sect¬ 
ion I. 

When the analytical method had been proven, it was 
utilized to investigate the basis of the visual adaptation 
test. Such visual tests depend on the bleaching of visual 
purple (rhodopsin) in the rods of the retina® Since vitamin A 
enters the composition of visual purple, the rate of its 
resynthesis, and consequent recovery from a bright light, 
will depend, at least in part, upon the available supply of 
vitamin A in the blood. This is the assumption upon which 
such an adaptation test is based. This basis had not been 
tested by blood analysis. Evidence is here reported from a 
study of individuals with different visual adaptation times 
and different blood vitamin A levels, that there is a 
correlation between recovery time in the Pett visual test and 
the blood vitamin A level.

The physiology of any food substance is concerned 
with its digestion, absorption, distribution in the blood and 
tissues, functions in the body and excretion. These factors 
are elucidated to some extent by quantitative analyses, seek¬ 
ing to balance the amount eaten with the amount excreted. 
Section III of this thesis is concerned with such problems. 

Since a large percentage of the vitamin A given to 
subjects could not be accounted for as such, a search began 
for destruction products. 

Spectographic methods revealed a rather broad ab¬ 
sorption band at 275Win the blood and faeces of individuals 
who had taken massive doses of vitamin A. This band, not 
shown by blood and faeces of individuals on a normal diet, 
seems to indicate a degradation product of vitamin A. Evid¬ 
ence is given in section IV from purely chemical investigat¬ 
ions on vitamin A concentrates, of a relationship of this de¬ 
gradation product to vitamin A*

Method 

Aside from the biological method, which is the basis 
of all others, there are two chief means of assaying vitamin A. 
One depends on measurement of absorption of light in the ultra 
violet region of the spectrum. Vitamin A has an absorption max¬ 
imum at 328pp. Calculation of an extinction coefficient from 
this absorption, and use of an arbitrary factor, 1600, enables 
one to compute the value of a vitamin A source in terms of in¬ 
ternational units. This widely accepted method was used to 
assay vitamin A concentrates needed in the present work. 

The other means of assay is by measurement of the 
blue color produced by vitamin A with chloroformic antimony 
trichloride against some standard. This was first described 
by Carr and Price (3). 

In apiDlying the above methods to measurement of vit¬ 
amin A in blood plasma, certain difficulties are presented. 

Pirst vitamin A must be extracted from the plasma quantitatively. 
Some method of measuring small amounts of vitamin A must be 
devised. Some attempts to satisfy these requirements are 
already presented in the literature. 

All the investigations on blood vitamin A reported 
have been done on serum or plasma. The vitamin seems to be 
absent from the ’’formed elements” of the blood. 

The first blood vitamin A analysis methods tried 
by us, that of Rosenthal and Szilard (20) and that of Clausen 
and EcCoord (6), gave inconsistant results. 




- 4 - 


An attachment of vitamin A in the "blood. plasaia 
was indicated, by the investigations of Thiele and Scharff (21), 
von Eekelen and Emmerie (23), and Lindqvist (14). Consequently 
all these authors are of the opinion that a saxoonification step 
is necessary in any blood vitamin A analysis, to release the 
vitamin for extraction. Some preliminary experiments, by us, 
showed that much higher values were obtained after saponific¬ 
ation than without it, unless the extraction time be greatly 
prolonged in the unsaponified samples. In the latter, the 
results become more comparable. This explains why the methods 
of Rosenthal and Szilard (20), Clausen and McCoord (6) give 
inconsistent results, as they use no saponification. 

The method used by Lindqvist seemed the most satis¬ 
factory one available. It contained some detailed steps and 
manipulation, which it was thought could be modified or elimin¬ 
ated. 

The first step investigated was the saponification. 
The method, as used by Lindqvist, required an half-hour sapon¬ 
if ication on a boiling water-bath. This was the minimum time 
tried in his investigation. From Table I it will be seen that 
this treatment destroys some of the vitamin, and that higher 
results are obtained with a 5 minute saponification. It also 
shows that suitable values can be obtained at a lower temper¬ 
ature by prolonging the saponification time. It is notable 
that the results are more consistent with shorter heating times

Lindqvist extracted the saponified plasma with 
diethyl ether, and after some manipulation evaporated this 
off, taking the residue up in petroleum ether for measure¬ 
ment of the yellow color* It was found that equally good 
results, and a saving in time was obtained by direct ex-

Since the petroleum ether must be evaporated off, 
an investigation was carried out to find the minimum number 
of extracts and volume necessary to extract all the vitamin A 
from the plasma. This was found to be accomplished by 35 ml. 
of petroleum ether, used as 3 successive portions. 

The procedure developed is as follows? 

The 10 - 20 ml. of blood is removed from the arm by venipuncture 
into a syringe containing a pinch of sodium oxalate. It is 
centrifuged, the plasma taken off, and samples of 3 - 5 ml. 
measured into 50 ml. erlenmyer flasks for duplicate estimat¬ 
ion. One-tenth the plasma volume of 60% alcoholic KOH is added, 
and the samples are refluxed on a boiling water-bath for 5 
minutes. The mixture is quickly chilled, then receives half 
its volume of 95$ ethanol. It is extracted three times with 

















































- 7 - 


successive portions of petroleum ether, 15, 10, 10 ml* The 
petroleum ether extracts are pooled and received two success¬ 
ive washes with 20 ml* portions of distilled water. The ex¬ 
tract is dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate. It is filtered 
and washed into a 100 ml. erlenmyer flask. In this it is 
evaporated at 50°- 4C°C. with a stream of nitrogen. The res¬ 
idue is taken up in about 1 ml* of petroleum ether and washed 
into a small tube (8 X 75 mm.) with a further small portion. 

This is dried with a very small amount (0*05 gm*) of anhydrous 
sodium sulphate and filtered into a second such tube which has 
a. graduation at 2ml* With washings the volume is brought to 
2 ml. 

This extract contains the vitamin A and carotene of 
the original plasma. Since the solution is yellow, due to 
carotene, and at a definite volume, the amount of carotene can 
be measured by comparison with a suitable standard. To do this, 
it is put in the cup of a colorimeter, and the intensity of the 
yellow color matched with that of a 10mm. depth of 0*02% 

K 2 Cr 2 0 7 solution. It is calculated as carotene, though this 
may not be strictly correct. The solution is washed back 
into the tube. 

Since the antimony trichloride reaction with vitamin A 
takes place in chloroform, the carotene and vitamin A must now 
be quantitatively transferred to chloroform. This is accomp¬ 
lished by evaporating off the petroleum ether in vacuo at room 
temperature, and taking the residue up in 0.25 ml. of chloroform.

The chloroform solution is transferred to the colorimeter 
cup and another 0*25 ml* portion used to wash it in. Then 
0.50 ml. of saturated (30%) antimony trichloride in chloro¬ 
form is added. The resulting blue color is quickly matched 
against that of a 10 mm. depth of 5% CuS0 4 *5H 2 0. This blue 
color is due to carotene as well as vitamin A, and must be 
corrected for the amount of carotene found. However, this 
correction seldom amounts to more than 2 - b% of the total 
plasma vitamin A value. 

The calculations involves 

(1) a comparison of the yellow dichromate standard with pure 
carotene in petroleum ether. 

(2) a comparison of the blue copper sulphate standard with 
the blue color developed by known quantities of pure vitamin A. 

(3) ascertaining the amount of blue color developed by a 
given amount of (3- carotene under these conditions. 

Pure (3- carotene (kindly supplied by S. M. A. Cor¬ 
poration) was weighed and dissolved in petroleum ether to give 
standard solutions. It was found that, on average, 1.12 
of p- carotene per ml. in petroleum ether gave a yellow color 
equivalent to that of 10 mm. of 0.02 % IC^Cr^O^ when matched 
at 10 mm. 

YItamin A solutions in chloroform, free of carotene 
were prepared by weighing out quantities of a concentrate which 
had been assayed by the makers and by us spectrographically.

These solutions were used to develop blue color for compar¬ 
ison with the 5% copper sulphate solution. It was found that 
1.85 I. U. of vitamin A gave a blue color, which at 10 mm. 
was equivalent to a 10 mm. depth of the copper sulphate 
standard under the conditions of the test used in blood vit¬ 
amin A determinations. Results of this are shown in Table 3.

The validity of such colorimetric methods must be 
confirmed in several ways# 

(1) The intensity of color at different depths or concentrat¬ 
ions should follow Beer’s La?/ by showing a proportionality 
change as the concentration changes# That the estimation of 
yellow color in this method follows the above requirement is 
shown by the following results, obtained when 0 - carotene 
solutions ?/ere matched against 0.02% K 2 Cr 2 0 7 10 mm* in depth. 
Each result is an average of some 10 closely agreeing figures.

Similarly, with the vitamin A, development of blue

(2) The method must continue to show this proportionality in 
the presence of plasma. This was tested out hy added, known 
amounts of vitamin A and carotene to plasms, and following the 
full analysis procedure. The range covered and values obtained 
were substantially the same as shown in the above tabulations. 
Further verification of compliance with Beer’s Law is given 
by the following figures. 


Plasma used in ml. 10#0 7.5 5.0

(3) The method in this case is not finally confirmed until it 
has been shown that changes in the blood vitamin A level follow¬ 
ing administration or deprivation of vitamin A in the human 
individual are detected by it. This proof is reserved, however, 
for the next section, since it is also concerned with blood, 
vitamin A level and. the visual test. 

Discussion. 

The requirements of a blood vitamin A analysis method, 
sought were as follows: 

(i) It should require only relatively simple and inexpensive 
apparatus. 

(ii) It should require a minimum of time and manipulation, 
liii) It should give accuracy of 5% or better. 

Tfihile instruments like the photoelectric colorimeter, 
used by Kimble (13) in one such blood vitamin A analysis method,

are desirable, it has been shown that sufficient practice en¬ 
ables one to obtain good results with an ordinary colorimeter. 

The method still possesses some considerable mani¬ 
pulation, but is a definite improvement in this respect over 
that of Linaqvist (14). The other methods referred to are 
over-simplified in their means of separating the vitamin from 
the plasma. 

Accuracy greater than that obtainable with this some¬ 
what new method is not needed for most purposes, as it will be 
seen later that values for blood vitamin A vary over a wide 
range♦ 

The results in Table 3 indicate 1*83 I. U. of vitamin A 
is equivalent to the 5% copper sulphate standard when both are 
at a 10 mm. depth. However, it should be noted that small var¬ 
iations in the concentration of the antimony trichloride solut¬ 
ion in this range {Xd% approx, on dilution by the test solution) 
make appreciable difference in the amount of blue color developed. 
Consequently, when a fresh reagent is made up, it should be 
standardized by use of a freshly made up solution of vitamin A 
in chloroform. The value 1.83 is that obtained with the reagent 
used in the blood analysis experiments described, and for conven¬ 
ience, other reagents made up after were adjusted to give this 
value.

I i• Correlation of Blood Vitamin A Analysis 
with the Pett Visual Test, 










- 13 - 


In all cases, the subject was given the visual test, 
as described by Pett (17) and a sample of 12 - 20 ml* of blood 
taken from an arm vein. This was used to carry out a plasma 
vitamin A analysis in duplicate, as described in section I* 

The results obtained with one subject, A.L., who was 
by the criterion of the Pett visual test, normal as to vitamin A, 
or nearly so, are given below. Administration of 20,000 I. U. 
of vitamin A orally as Halibut liver oil showed that four hours 
after ingestion of vitamin A, there is a significant rise in 
the blood level indicating that about 8 % of the total ingested 
vitamin A is in the circulation. Also the recovery time for 
the visual test is significantly reduced*

Table IV shows the results obtained with one subject,

the normal condition. These data show that both a rise and fall 
of blood vitamin A level can be detected by the analysis. It 
shows the close relationship of the blood vitamin A level with 
the visual test.

While the above experiment was going on, various 
people, with different recovery times, were hied and their 
blood vitamin A levels determined. The blue values obtained 
were corrected for carotene found in the plasma. The carotene 
values did not seem significant. These subjects were all 
males, ages 20 - 30 years, in good health, not under treatment, 
nor on special diets. Thus it was hoped the chief variable 
would be "recovery time" in the visual test. Results of these 
analyses are shown in Table 5. 

Also Figure I, Appendix, shows the curve obtained 
for the 26 people, plotting blood vitamin A against recovery 
t ime. 

The curve is a rectangular hyperbola, with the

where Y is plasma vitamin A in I.lJ./lOO ml.

Discussion 

The points about the curve in Figure I show con¬ 
siderable dispersion. While this might be due to inherent 
errors in the visual test or in the blood analysis, or both, 
there is a possible physiological explantion worthy of consider¬ 
ation. Observations suggest that the widely divergent points 
represent persons not in an equilibrium condition. This means 
the blood level of vitamin A was changing, either up or down, 
owing to absorption or transference of vitamin A into the 
tissues, and the visual test is not sensitive enough to de¬ 
tect this fact. 

Since it was not possible to control all such 
factors in the 26 persons studied, the fact that most of the 
points follow the curve closely is all the more significant. 

It means that small variations of normal physiological type, 
detectable by blood analysis, do not register sufficiently 
on the visual test to bias interpretations. Pett (17) has 
pointed out that his visual test has been limited to a cert¬ 
ain degree of sensitivity so as to be very rapid and simple 
in operation, and hence of greater value in routine clinical 
practice. The form of the correlation curve is of some phy¬ 
siological interest. While it is more usual to think of a 
correlation in terms of a straight line, this is not possible 
here, since it would then cut the axes, thereby representing 
zero and even negative amounts of vitamin A and adaptation 
times. This curve suggests that a person may exist at a 





























r'

- 18 - 


certain low level of vitamin A, with a retarded recovery time, 
as a kind of subsistence level* To build such a person up to 
what might be an optimum level would seem to require a large 
amount of vitamin A and nearly double the blood level* Such 
indeed has been the finding on treatment rex^orted by Pett (17)* 
Considerable interest attaches to the question of 
the dividing line between optimal and suboptimal blood levels. 
The values here reported for 26 people compare favorably with 
those of de Haas and Meulemans (7), namely 90 - 120 I.U./100 ml. 
plasma as good, 45 - 90 I. IT. as satisfactory, and under 
45 I. U. as insufficient. As Pett suggests, any group of 
people includes types falling on two distribution curves, and 
a given value might be optimal for one person, but somewhat 
suboptimal for another, nevertheless, the evidence presented 
by Pett shows a fairly clear separation into two groups. The 
form of the curve in Figure I bears out this general idea of 
two groups of people, one at each asymptote, and a transition 


zone 






Ill• Balance Experiments 







- 19 - 


A. Blood and Faeces Analysis 
The subjects of these balance experiments were all 
males, 20 - 30 years of age, in good health and not under 
treatment, nor on special diets. 

The first balance experiment was carried out w r ith 
three subjects. They were, by the criterion of the visual 
test, normal as to vitamin A status. Each of these was given 
a 20 grain charcoal pill. After a short interval, a blood 
sample was taken and 10,000 I. U. of vitamin A administered. 
The vitamin A source used was a carotene-free concentrate, 
50,000 I.U./gm. Further blood samples were taken from each 
individual at intervals of 1, 3, 5 and 8 or 24 hours. These 
were all analyzed for vitamin A as described in section I. 

The faeces were collected, and that containing the 
charcoal was analyzed for vitamin A and carotene. The faeces 
analysis method in all these cases was one, with slight mod¬ 
ifications, reported by von Wendt (24). 

The method, as used., was as follows. The day f s 
stools were mixed with anhyd.rous sodium sulphate and extracted 
with 95^ ethanol, first 300 ml., then 3 successive 100 ml. 
portions. For each extraction the alcohol was mixed with the

rapidly with suction. The combined extracts v/ere mixed with 
200 ml. of 60 % alcoholic K0H and refluxed on a boiling water- 
bath for 10 minutes. The extract took 5 minutes to reach 
boiling point. The saponified extract was chilled, diluted to

50/5 alcohol with distilled water and extracted with 200 ml*, 
then with 4 successive 100 ml* portions of petroleum ether* 

The combined extracts were washed 5 times with distilled water 
in 100 ml. portions* The resulting solution was dried with 
anhydrous sodium sulphate and filtered into a grad-uated cy¬ 
linder* Aliquots of this were taken for analysis. 

For carotene estimation, the yellow color was 
matched against 10 mm. of 0*02/5 KgCr 2 0 7 solution in a colori¬ 
meter. The yellow color was calculated as {3- carotene. For 

g rc 

the three subjects, carotene value as p- carotene was found 
to vary from 300 -700y per day f s faeces. 

For vitamin A analysis, an aliquot of the petrol¬ 
eum ether extract was taken, the solvent evaporated off in a 
stream of nitrogen, and the residue taken up in chloroform. 
This was mixed with chloroformic antimony trichloride and 
vitamin A calculated from the blue color developed. The 
amount of blue color developed, in each case only accounted 
for the p- carotene in the faeces, as the latter also gives 
a blue color. We thus conclude, that following the ingestion 
of 10,000 I. IT. vitamin A there ?/as no free vitamin A excreted 
in the faeces.

As may be observed 

from Table

greatest 

percentage of the dose 

given, 

accounted 

for in 

the blood, 

is 3*19$, in the case 

of L.B. 

P. In thi; 

s same subject, the 


amount recovered in the faeces is 0.46$ of the dose given* 
Thus 96.35$ must he considered as withdrawn by the tissues, 
or disposed of in other ways* It does not seem probable 
that this large proportion of such a large dose could be 
withdrawn in so short a time* In view of this, and the 
findings of Bauman, Riising and Steenbock (2), that only 
10-20$ of administered vitamin A could be accounted for by 
whole analysis of rats, it was decided to pursue the in-* 
vestigation further* The problem appeared to be one of 
sea.rch.ing for destruction products of vitamin A in the blood 
and faeces. We began the search for such products by 
spectrographic examination of purified extracts of the blood 
and faeces after administration of vitamin A*

B* Spectrogra p hic Investigation. 

Three subjects were again given doses of 300,000 
I. U. of vitamin A. Control blood and faeces samples were 
collected just previous to this. 

A blood sample was taken from each of the three 
subjects 4 hours after administration of the vitamin A. The 
faeces of each for the next three days were collected and 
pooled in each case for analysis. 

Both blood and faeces were analyzed for vitamin A 
as previously described. In addition, aliquots were extracted 
and prepared for spectrographic examination in the following 
manner. 

11) B1o o d PIasma 

The aliquot of the blood plasma sample was sapon¬ 
ified, extracted, washed and evaporated to dryness in a 
stream of nitrogen at 30°- 40°C. It was then taken up in 15 ml* 
of absolute ethanol plus 1.5 ml. of 60^ alcoholic K0H. This 
solution was refluxed on a boiling water-bath for 10 minutes, 
chilled quickly, extracted with 25, 20, 15 ml. of petroleum 
ether. The combined extracts were washed twice with success¬ 
ive 20 ml. portions of distilled water, once with 10 ml. of 
dilute alcoholic KOK and then with 3 successive 20 ml. portions 
of distilled water. The extract was dried with anhydrous sod¬ 
ium sulphate, filtered, and evaporated in a stream of nitrogen. 
The residue could then be taken up in the required amount of

cyclohexane-ethanol mixture for spectrographic examination* 

(2) Faeces. 

An aliquot of the fa,eces extract in each case was 
evaporated to dryness in a stream of nitrogen at room temper¬ 
atures and the residue taken up in 10 ml. of absolute ethanol 
plus 1 ml. of 60% alcoholic KOH. The solution was refluxed on 
a boiling water bath for 10 minutes? chilled? extracted with 3 
successive portions of petroleum ether and otherwise prepared 
as the blood samples. The final residue was taken up in 
cyclohexane - ethanol mixture for spectrographic examination. 

The same treatment was used for the control blood 
and faeces samples. 

The absorption curves for these extracts are illus¬ 
trated by the examples in Plates I - IV inclusive? Appendix. 
Curves obtained with all three subjects are shown in Figures 
II? III? Appendix. 

Table 12 presents some information on the extracts 
used for this examination.

The petroleum ether extracts from faeces varied 
in volume, roughly as the size of the specimen. Since these 
were not all adjusted to the same volume, and different dilut¬ 
ions had to he made to obtain suitable spectrographie plates, 
the information involved is given in Table 13.

Liscussion. 

Several facts are apparent from the balance exper¬ 
iments* The blood analysis data show that normal individuals 
reach a maximum blood vitamin A level 4 to 5 hours after oral 
intake as was also found by de Haas and Meulemans (7), and 
Chesney and McCoord (5). In none of the cases observed did 
more than 8% of the vitamin axopear in the blood stream at 
its maximum level. More usually, the proportion in the blood 
was much less than this. In no case did excretion of vitamin A 
in the faeces exceed 4% of that administered. The excretion 
was more usually of the order of 0.4^* 

If the values for increase in blood vitamin A and 
faeces vitamin A be calculated as percentages of the dose, 
these percentages are comparable in different sized doses. 

About the same percentage of the dose occurs in the blood 
whether 10,000 or 300,000 I. U• be given. Although no ex¬ 
cretion was shown for doses of 10,000 I. U., the amount com¬ 
parable to that excreted after 300,000 I. U. is only 50 - 100 
I. IT. This latter amount could arise from error in assuming 
that all the yellow color of the extract is due to carotene® 
That there is an error in this assumption is indicated by 
the investigations of Moore (15) on bovine faeces. He found 
30% of the color due to yellow pigments of no vitamin A act¬ 
ivity. This error, however, would not be very significant 
in respect to the deductions for carotene in blood., or that 
for carotene in faeces after large doses of vitamin A. 












•30- 

Blood and faeces of normal individuals after large 
vitamin A doses have "been shown to contain a substance giv¬ 
ing an absorption maximum in the ultra violet at about 275}ip 
Since this maximum was not found in the control faeces or 
blood, nor in the vitamin A concentrate, it would seem that 
this absorption band must be attributed to the presence of 
some chemical entity produced metabolically from vitamin A* 
Further chemical evidence will be presented that such is the 
case and that the product is partially oxidized vitamin A*

IV. Chemical Treatment of Vitamin A Concentrates. 








- 31 - 


It was assumed that the substance showing absorp¬ 
tion at 275pp , found in blood and faeces after giving large 
doses of vitamin A was either an oxidation or a reduction 
product of the vitamin. Experiments were planned to test 
this hypothesis on the material used for the feeding exper¬ 
iments (50,000 I.U./gm.). Eventually, two other concentrates 
were also used. These were a Ling-Cod liver oil (196,000 
I.U./gm.) and a Shark liver oil (112,700 I.U./gm.) 

In each case a 50 mg. sample of the oil was weighed 
into a 50 ml. erlenmyer flask; 20 ml. of 95% ethanol and 2 ml* 
of 60% alcnholic K0H were added, and the solution v*ras refluxed 
on a boiling water-bath for 10 minutes. Then it was quickly 
chilled, diluted with‘distilled water to 50% alcohol, and ex¬ 
tracted with 25, 20, 20 ml. of petroleum ether. The combined 
extracts received washes in the extraction funnel with 2 
successive 20 ml* portions of distilled water, with 10 ml. of 
6% alcoholic K0H, and finally with 3 successive 20 ml* port¬ 
ions of distilled water. The extract was dried with anhydrous 
sodium sulphate, filtered, and washed into a 100 ml. erlenmyer 
flask. The solvent was evaporated off in a, stream of nitrogen 
at 30°- 40°C. and the residue taken up in 20 ml. of absolute 
ethanol. 

The above purification, when carried out on 50 gms. 
of the Shark liver oil, yielded about 6 gms. of a yellow-orange 
oil, having E led. = 543, potency 870,000 I.U* vitamin A per 


gram 






- 32 - 


The solution of purified residue in 20 ml. of absol¬ 
ute ethanol was convenient for oxidation or reduction treat¬ 
ments, and the reaction could be carried out in the same 
vessel. 

Reduction was tried, with 5 gms. of sodium amalgam 
added to the purified extract in 20 ml. absolute ethanol. 

The reaction v/as allowed to proceed for 20 minutes at 70°C. 
Then the solution was chilled, diluted with an equal volume 
of distilled water, and extracted with 3 successive portions 
of petroleum ether. The resulting petroleum ether solution 
was washed with five successive 20 ml. portions of distilled 
water. This extract was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, 
filtered, evaporated in a stream of nitrogen at 30°- 40°C., 
the residue taken up in cyclohexane-ethanol mixture, and ex¬ 
amination with the spectrograph carried out. A typical vit¬ 
amin A absorption curve, with maximum at 328TO was observed 
and no irregularities. A 90% destruction Y/as indicated. 

Since reduction showed none of the characteristics 
desired, oxidation ?/as tried with hydrogen.peroxide. The 
latter assayed 28.35% hydrogen peroxide. The treatment pro¬ 
cedure adopted for this oxidation Y/as almost identical in- 
all three oils, varying Y/ith the oil only in respect to the 
time it was exposed to the oxidant. One was exposed 20 min¬ 
utes to get the desired effect, another 35 minutes. 

In the preliminary work, both v/ith blood and faeces

extracts, after vitamin A administration and in these in vitro 
oxidations, one component at least, of those absorbing in the 
ultra-violet, proved somewhat unstable. Hence precautions had 
to be introduced into this procedure. 

To the solution of purified concentrate in 20 ml* 
of absolute ethanol, 5 ml. of the hydrogen peroxide solution 
were added. The mixture was maintained at 70°C. in a water- 
bath, and nitrogen was bubbled through it. At conclusion of 
the required time, the extract was diluted with an equal vol¬ 
ume of distilled water and quickly chilled to -22°C. in a 
freezing mixture. The diluted solution was then extracted, 
three times with petroleum ether, first 25 ml., then two succ¬ 
essive 20 ml. portions. The combined extracts were ?/ashed 5 
times with successive 20 ml. portions of cold distilled water, 
dried with anhydrous sod.ium sulphate and filtered into a 100 ml. 
flask. In this the petroleum ether was quickly taken off under 
vacuum. The residue was taken up in cyclohexane-ethanol mix¬ 
ture, diluted to the required concentration and examined 
spectrographicall 3 r at once. 

On suitable oxidation treatment "with hyd.rogen per¬ 
oxide, the three vitamin A concentrates all gave absorption 
curves of the same nature as those obtained with blood and 
faeces after vitamin A administration. ‘That is they all ex¬ 
hibited the absorption maximum due to vitamin A at 328pp 
and also a maximum in the vicinity of 275pp . The curves

obtained for these oils before and after oxidation are shown 
in Figure IV, Appendix. Also examples of the plates obtained 
with two of these are shown in Plates V - X inclusive, Append¬ 
ix. These curves of the oxidized oils tended to slip, show 
less absorption, for the first hour or two after the chemical 
treatment, but after this, no further change was observed. 
Repeat plates on the same solutions to show this change are 
included. 

Discussion 

Since oxidation of a purified vitamin A concentrate 
produces a substance with an absorption band identical to that 
of the substance in blood and faeces after a vitamin A dose, 
it would seem the substance in question is an oxidation pro¬ 
duct of vitamin A. 

In work on vitamin A assays, Morton and Heiibron (16) 
report that one of the first decomposition products on oxid¬ 
ation of vitamin A exhibits an absorption band at 275 - 285pp 
Edisbury and Morton (9) found a material in a vitamin A con¬ 
centrate which was insoluble in 83% methanol and showed a 
bioassay too high to be residual vitamin A. This fraction 
gave an absorption band at 285 - 290pp . Castle et al (4) 
report obtaining from vitamin A concentrates a substance absorb 
ing at 270 - 280pp which they state to be an oxidation pro¬ 
duct of vitamin A. Karrer et al (12) separated a highly concen 
trated vitamin A into two fractions, one absorbing at 328pp 
the other at 270pp.. Edisbury et al (8) report that ozone

• ■ ' 























- 35 - 


attacks vitamin A with production of first, a compound having 
an absorption maximum at 290pp , then one with maximum at 272pp 
On the basis of similar structures, the latter authors deduce 
that absorption of vitamin A at 328pp. is due to the straight 
chain of four double bands and a slight shift, due to the 
fifth in the ring. They suggest that probably ozone attacks 
a double band in the side-chain, then another, both selectively. 

This literature all seems to confirm the chemical 
identity of the product found absorbing at 275pp as being an 
oxidation product of vitamin A. Under the conditions where it 
was found in both blood and faeces, at least two explantions 
are possible, and both should be considered. Either the oxid¬ 
ation product is produced in the blood after absorption, in 
which case some must be excreted again, or it is produced in 
the gastro-intestinal tract and part of it absorbed. A study 
of individuals with varied metabolic abnormalcies, such as liver 
dysfunction and faulty fat absorption, might throw some light 
on this point. 

Criticism could be offered that perhaps the source 
of this material in blood, and faeces extracts v/as oxidation 
during the purification procedures. However, this possibility 
is small when it is considered that the oils which were exam¬ 
ined after the same procedure of saponification, etc., did not 
shov/ any such characteristic absorption* Also the calculation 
of vitamin A in blood and faeces from the spectrographic

1. A procedure for analysis of vitamin A in blood plasma has 
been described. 

2. A correlation between blood vitamin A level and the Pett 
visual test for vitamin A deficiency has been established. 

3. Quantitative experiments on the absorption of vitamin A 
indicate that 88 - 96 % of the vitamin ingested can not be 
accounted for in blood and faeces as vitamin A. 

4. A substance was found in blood and faeces after ingestion 
of large doses of vitamin A which seems to be a closely re¬ 
lated oxidation product. 

5. i‘hat this related substance is an oxidation product of 
vitamin A has been demonstrated by purely chemical invest¬ 
igation. 

6. The nature of the oxidizing system* and the Importance of 
the fate of the oxidized product* remain to be determined.

I. Description of Solvents Used in this Investigation. 

1• Petroleum ether* 

The petroleum ether used was a benzin obtained from 
Merck and Co#, quoted as having boiling range 30° - 60°C. It 
was dealt with in 3 litre batches. The 3 litres of benzin 
were treated, in a flask, with 2 gms. KMn0 4 dissolved in 
200 ml. of distilled water. The flask was shaken at intervals 
for 2 hours, then distilled into an ice-packed receiver. This 
treatment removes aldehydes, aliphatic unsaturateds and per¬ 
oxides. The distillate was dried with anhydrous sodium sul¬ 
phate, filtered into a flask, and fractionated through a 
Snyder type bubble column. The first fraction, distilling be¬ 
tween 35° - 40°C., of which there was some 2 litres, was 
collected. The remainder was made available for other labor¬ 
atory uses. The first fraction was treated in a separatory 
funnel with two successive 50 ml. portions of 20 % fuming sul¬ 
phuric acid at room temperature, mixing by frequent shaking. 

An orange, oily acid layer was finally separated off each time. 
This results in conversion of aromatics present into sulphonic 
acids, so that they are later removed. The petroleum ether was 
washed with water, -with sodium hydroxide solution, and finally 
with several portions of distilled water. The resulting pur¬ 
ified solvent was dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and 
distilled. Yield about 1.5 litres. 

The precautionary measure of this purification was 






















- 39 - 


considered necessary to "be certain no materials would be in¬ 
troduced which might interfere in the spectrographic examin- 
at i or.i s. 

2. Absolute Ethanol. 

A 7 litre batch of 95% ethanol was put in a 12 litre 
flask with 3 kg. of fresh, lump quick-lime, 28 gnu of KMn0 4 
and 130 gnu of KaOH. The mixture was refluxed on a water-bath 
for 6 hours on each of 2 successive days. Then a 3*5 foot 
fractionating column of metal turnings, a distillation head, 
condensers and receiver were attached. The system was closed 
except through a calcium chloride tube from the receiver. 

Distillation was carried out at the rate of 3 - 5 
drops per second. The product, some 3.5 litres, was shown by 
density and chemical tests to be free of water, peroxides, 
aldehydes, ketones and amyl alcohols. 

3. Chloroform. 

The chloroform used as solvent for the blue tests 
was U. S. P. standard. 

4. Cyclohexane-ethanol. 

The solvent used for spectrographic examinations 
was a mixture of 20% cyclohexane, 80% ethanol by volume. The 
alcohol alone is not a sufficiently good fat solvent to take 
up some of the residues involved, and this mixture proved 
very satisfactory. The cylcohexsne was a special grade obtained 
from Eastman Kodak Co. for spectrographic work. It gave no 










- 40 - 


absorption in the region being examined, 370pp to 260pp. 

Since cyclohexane gives different extinction 
coefficients for vitamin A than are obtained with ethanol 
as solvent, as indicated by Smith et al (19) and Gillam and 
SI Ridi (10), ethanol was used in any standardization of 
vitamin A solutions* 

I 1 • Instruments Us ed* 

The spectrograph used was a rotating sector type, 
with horizontal plate-holder attached for the photometric 
recording of absorptions* This instrument was calibrated by 
measurement of the extinction coefficient of an aqueous sol¬ 
ution 0.000075 M to K 2 Crp 7 and 0.05 M to K0H, as reported by 
Baly et al (1). 

The colorimeter used was a Leitz Hcrocolorimeter, 
with 10 mm. cups for standard, and solution cups of 2 ml* 
capacity and some 25 mm. depth.

Publication, by Pett and LePage (18), of the blood 
vitamin A analysis method in section I brought numerous re¬ 
quests for development of a simple analysis, suitable for rout¬ 
ine clinical use. Accordingly, an attempt was made in this 
direction. 

The chief requirement of such a method is that it 
take little time and less constant attention on the part of 
the technician than that described for research purposes*

The first attempt at simplification involved tak¬ 
ing up the blood plasma on Plaster Paris, drying, and ex¬ 
tracting in a soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether* 

Drying at various temperatures from 50°- 100°G* 
gave destruction. This was overcome by drying for 5 minutes 
at 50°C. under vacuum. Holmes et al (11) have shown that 
such phenolic comxjounds as pyrogallol and hydroquinone will act 
as antioxidants for vitamin A. Pyrogallol. was added to the 
Plaster Paris for this purpose. 

It was finally concluded from numerous determinat¬ 
ions that the Plaster Paris held the carotene, and a variable 
amount of the vitamin A, adsorbed on its surface, even where 
prolonged extractions were used. This approach was therefore 
given up for the present. However, adsorption may be over¬ 
come by using a petroleum ether-methanol mixture or methanol 
as solvent. Further vfork in this direction Is anticipated.
