STUDIES OF SULFUR OXIDATIOU AIID REACTIQU EFFECTS 


III ALBERTA SOILS* 


IIECRODITCTIQU* 

Sulfur is a component of soils and as such is of 
primary importance in soil and plant economy. It is a. 
constituent of proteins and therefore essential to life 
in all its diversity* Sulfur exists in air, usuaUly 
combined v/ith oxygen, ih very small amounts as compared 
to nitrogen or oxygen* Waksms.n states that, "Sulfur 
resembles nitrogen in the trcinsf ormationfe into which it 
enters and in the types of microorganisms which causes these 
transformations. There is in the sulfur cycle apparent 
duplications of the processes associated with the nitrogen 
cycle 

The transformations to ¥/hich sulfur is subjected in 
the soil may'-De summarized under four headings: (l) oxidation 
(2) reduction, (3) synthesis into proteins, and (4) decom¬ 
position of proteins and protein derivatives containing 
sulfur. Microorganisms are generally conceded to be

essential factors, instrumental in causing the changes of 
sulfur in its various phases, excepting the synthesizing 
processes.’ Purely chemical changes, however, are not 
excluded as contributory factors in the various transformations^ 

Sulfur may occur distributed throughout the soil to 
a considerable depth. It is doubtful, however, if the 
sulfur belov/ the feeding range of plant roots is of much 
value as a source of plant food. In certain Alberta soils 
(76,77) it is not uncommon to find that the relatively 
soluble salts have leached to greater depths, forming 
sulfate layers at the point of precipitation of the salts. 

In badly leached surface soils, therefore, the sulfur 
present is largely in the form of organic matter and to a 
soffie\?i/hat lesser extent in complex insoluble mineral compounds. 

The soluble salts of sulfur constitute the source of 
available sulfur for plant growth; hence, the sulfur present 
in organic matter and in insoluble form, is not directly 
e.vailable as plant food. The insoluble, complex 4 ,inorganic 
sulfur c)om.poundsof soils are continually being converted into 
soluble form through the agency of weathering. By the de™ 
composition of organic sulfur compounds, sulfur is also 
liberated in some simple form, such as hydrogen sulfide. 

The hydrogen sulfide and other sulfides in solution are 
slowly o.xidiz 0 d to sulfur, under natural conditions (71). 

The sulfur thus formed, as well as elememtary sulfur when added 
to soils, undergoes further o.xidation, the resulting end 
product being sulfuric acid. .During the decomposition and 
oxidation processes, some gaseous sulfur compoundsrnay find 






3 

their way into '.he air and thus he lost to plants® 

However, to compensate for this loss (68,14) some sulfur 
is continually being returned to the soil dissolved in 
rain -water. 

The sulfur oxidizing' power of soils is by no means, 
a new subject of investigation, . It has been studied by many 
v/orkers among whom are Johnston (32), who worked virith Oregon 
and Tdississouri soils; Joffe and TIcLean (31), a.nd Halversen 
and Bollen (19), who worked chiefly with Oregon soils* 

REVIEW 0? LITERATURE, 

The oxidation of sulfides to sulfur, and thence to 
sulfuric acid, is largely a biological process in vdiich the 
so-called sulfur ba.cteria are the a^cting organisms* 

According to Taksman (71) the sulfur bacteria were first 
studied extensively by Winogradsky, who isolated them from 
sea slime and sulfur springs. Up to the present time the 
sulfur bacteria from these sources have been investigated 
more thoroughly than any others. 

Morphologically the different groups of sulfur bacteria 
are not related to one another, but belong to a great many 
different genera. Waksman (71) divides the sulfur bacteria 
into five groups oh a basis of physiological and morphological, 
differences; 

(1) Colorless, thread forming bacteria., accumulating 
sulfur within their cells. 

(2) Colorless, non-thread forming bacteria, accumulating 
sulfur within their cells. 










4 

( 3 ) Purple bacteria, accumulating sulfur within their 
cells. 

(4) Bacteria oxidizing sulfur and sulfur compounds, 
but accumulating sulfur outside their cells. 

(5) Bacteria oxidizing elementary sulfur and not 
accumulating sulfur within or without the cells. 

Members of genus Beggiatoa, belonging to the first 
group, were the first organisms to attract attention in 
connection v/ith oxidation of sulfur compounds. In 1870, 
Cramer pointed out that the minute granules found within 
the cells of Beggiatoa consisted, of sulfur. 

Of the five groups mentioned, only the last two 
members are concerned with the oxidation of sulfur in soils, 
the other groups, up to the present, have been isolated 
only from sea waters, fresh waters, sea. slime, and sulfur 
springs. 

Nathanson and Beijerinok (1903,1904) were among the 
first to study members of group four, ITathanson isolated 
Thiobacillus thioparus from sea water, while Beijerinok 
discovered Thiobacillus denitrificans . These two organisms 
or closely related strains, have heen-Isolated from .soils. 
Both bacteria grow best in slightly alkaline media,. 

T. thioparus is stricly aerobic, ¥/hile ^ denitrifleans 
can utilize nitrates as source of oxygen, thus liberating 
free nitrogen. Both bacteria are autotrophic^that is, 
development is normal in the absence of organic compounds 
in the media, the sole source of carbon for metabolic

processes being dissolved carbon dioxide. Dernolon (11) 
found certain ainmonifying bacteria capable of oxidizing 
sulfur to sulfates in inoculated sand and in pure culture 
media. Joffe (28) working v/ith fungi in pure cultures, 
supplied with sulfur and insoluble phosphates, found that 
40 per cent of the phosphates added went into solution 
after six months, the reaction not going below pH 4.2® 

He concluded therefrom that fungi are able to oxidize 
sulfur. 

Only one species, Thiobacillus thiooxidans (65,66), 
has been definately classified under group five, although 
there a.re undoubtedly other forms not yet isol8.ted. This 
bacterium is aerobic and autotrophic in nature and possesses 
the extraordinary faculty of flourishing in extremely acid 
solutions, exhibiting like the nitrate formers a marked in- 
difference to the high concentration of its end product. 

The optimum reaction of the medist is pH 2.0 to 3.0* It is 
extremely sensitive to the nitrate anion but can ¥/ithstand 
concentrations of sulfate as high as 20 per cent of T.'!gS04. 
This organism is usually not present in common cultivated 
soils unless these have been treated with application of 
sulfur. This bacillus has bean found to be the most active 
in converting insoluble rock phosphate to the soluble form, 
through the production of sulfuric acid from elementary 
sulfur, in the Lipman soil-sulfur-rock phosphate compost 
process (27,44).

Taksman (74} states that the soil reaction, expressed 
as hydrogen-ion concentration has greater significance in 
soil biochemical processes than the quantity of acid sub¬ 
stance present. In quoting 'ATollenweber, taksman states that 
potato scab is caused by a number of species of Actinomyces, 
and that these organisms are very sensitive to acid (.05 per 
cent) and much less sensitive to alkali (,25 per cent), 
taksman, working with pure cultures, found the limiting re¬ 
action to vary with the strains of A. scabies , but for nea.rly 
all strains the limit was pH 5,0 to 5*2, with pH 4*8 the 
absolute limit for the most acid resistant forms studied. 

The control of the potato scab organism, by regulation 
of the soil reaction, has not given uniformly satisfactory 
results, chiefly/ because of the chemical and physiological 
complexity of the soil, such as that buffer effect, adsorption 
powder, texture and moisture content; a.nd partly because of 
the inherent biological characteristics of the potato itself 
and the diversity of the microflora, existing in the various 
soils® 

Sanford (58,59) states that development of the 
pathogenicity of A. sca^bies is largely independent of soil 
reaction between pH 5,4 to 8*5 when dealing with infected 
tubers. The high acidity limit of groth of the pathogen is 
in accord with the findings of ¥aksman (74). 

Martin (40,41),on the other hand, obtained partial 
control with sulfur applications giving a. reaction somewhat 
nearer the point of neutrality and, as a consequence, holds

that regulation of soil acidity is the most promising 
method of controling A» scabies . 

The effect of high hydrogen-ion concentration on 
the solubility of aluminum and consequent alleged toxicity 
to plants has been investigated by Tlagistad and others 
(39, 38, 67), The results thus obtained indicate that 
aluminum does not exist in appreciable quantities in 
solution in soils between pH 4*5 to 9,0, 

Increased solubility of calcium and potassium, as a 
result of sulfur oxidation, is reported, by .many inYestlgators 
(l, 61, 46, 47, 67), The extent of solubility of these two 
constituents appears to vary with different soils depending 
on the chemical composition* 

Other experiments, usually v/ith composts, have been / 
conducted with the intention of converting insoluble phosphates 
and potassium into soluble form (27, 29, 30, 34, 44, 52, 55)» 
This biological process shows some promise of becoming of 
practical value. The- insoluble phosphatic a.nd potassium rocks 
do not liberate their constituents in soluble form to any 
appreciable extent until the reaction reaches pK 2*0 to 3^0 
and^consequently^direct application of these constituents 
mixed with sulfur to soil without previous composting would 
seem inadvisable. 

The addition of sulfur along v/ith the rock phosphate 
fertilizer treatments of soil has not ax3preciably increased 
the availability of the phosphate, due to the 





8 


fact that the calcium of the silicate complex is attacked 
as readily as the calcium of the insoluble phosphate (3). 

The use of sulfur and its oxidation product in the 
reclamation of black alkali soils, by converting the car¬ 
bonate salts into less harmful compounds,has been the 
subject of considerable research (21,23,24,51,57)« This 
method of reclamation, in all probability, will only be of 
value in disposing of residual salts ¥/-hich can only be 
removed with difficulty by drainage and leaching* The 
sulfuric acid causes flocculation of the colloidal particles 
and, hence, considerably aids percolation and leaching of 
dispersed soils. 

Treatments of sulfur, serving chiefly as the source of 
a limiting element in plant nutrition, has given surprising 
increases in crop yields, especially of alfalfa,, in certain 
basaltic regions of Oregon and Y/ashington (31,48). 

Johnston (32) states, as a result of his investigations, that 
the arid Western soils are low in their sulfate recuperative 
powers, especia^lly under prolonged cropping, and hence 
require a larger initial supply of sulfur ,tha.n do the' more 
humid soils. The greater recuperative power, which is chief¬ 
ly the result of biological oxidation of the sulfur compounds, 
explains why a need for sulfur fertilization has hot been 
more apparent in the more humid middle Western soils with a 
low sulfur and sulfate content. 

Again, the question of the effect of sulfur oxidation 
on a,mmonification and nitrification has been the subject of

much investigation (2,7,16,37,48)« The results obtained 
indicate that, excluding the heavy applicatio-ns of sulfur, 
decomposition of organic matter is not retarded, and that 
in all soils, excepting slightly buffered acid soils, 
nitrification is not restricted to any marked extent. 

Studies on the relationship of sulfur oxidation to 
the rnicroflora of the soil (12,54] indicate that small 
applications of sulfur are somewhat beneficial in increasing 
bacterial ninabers, but larger treatments of sulfur quite 
definitely reduce the bacterial numbers. The effect of the 
sulfuric acid apparently is one of partia.l sterilization 
of the media. 

DESCHIPTIOIl QF SOILS TTSSD TIT THE IlTVESTIGATIOiT . 

In the study of the oxidizing power of Alberta soils, 
S8.mples representing the three major soil belts of the Province 
were used. A brief description of these soil belts may be 
of some value in interpreting the results obtained and is 
therefore presented herewith. 

Beaver Lodge Loam. This soil represents the Black Soil Belt, 
which has its greatest expanse in South-central A.lberta and 
contains approximately seven million acres; much of this 
acreage, is now under cultivation. The soils of this area 
are normally covered with vegetal ion consisting of long grass , 
dotted here and there vlth mixed willow and pola.r groves. 

Over a period of time this type of vegetion has fostered the 
accournulation of much residual organic matter and, as a con” 
sequence the soils of this area are generally very fertile.

The average annual precipitation varies from 15 to 18 
inches, with the heaviest rainfall occurring during the 
growing months. 4 favorable moisture distribution to¬ 
gether with an absence of warm dry winds may be consider¬ 
ed the primary cause of the presence of the Black Soil 
Belt flora anid the conseauent accumulation of plant 
residues. 

The Beaver Lodge loam used in this experiment is 
a virgin black loam, rich in all esential plant food 
elements and of a high organic matter content. It 
carries 0.626 per cent of nitrogen and apx^roximately 
0.065 per cent of sulfur. 

Pigeo n L ake Loamt This, soil represents,the Wooded Soil 
Belt, which is an area in extent somewhat less than two- 
thirds of the Province, and occupyihg the northern and . 
north-western parts of the Province. At the present 
time very little of this soil belt is under cultivation® 
The soils of this region are usuall\^ low in organic raatter 
content, though generally covered with a layer of organic 
residues up to two or three inches in thickness. This 
residues consists principally of leaf mold and v/ood in 
the various stages of decay. The rapid 8.nd complete 
decomposition of this siurface masterial and the absence of 
grass roots, percludes the accumulation of much stable 
residual organic matter, except under swamp conditions. 

In this belt are found our ma-in muskeg and swamp areas. 
The annual precipitation is approximately the sa,me as

for the Black Soil Belt. The vegetative covering is 
largely poplar and spruce and very little grass. This 
form of vegetation does not foster organic matter 
accumulation, hut, on the other hand, promotes the loss 
of essential plant food elements from the surface 
horizon through leaching and hence, owing to the loss 
of soluble salts, these soils are usually slightly acid 
in reaction. Being low in organic matter content and 
depleted in essential elements by leaching, these soils 
readily respond to corrective treatments of limestone, 
phosphorus and nitrogen. The absehce of residual organic 
matter and loss of certain salts is reflected in these 
soils by the grey to light brown color, low water-holding 
capacity, and poor physical condition. *^rom the stand** 
point of fertility they are our poorest soils. 

The sample used in this study was somewhat higher 
than the average soil of this area in nitrogen content, 
as it contained 0.230 per cent of this element* The 
sulfur content of similar soils is a.pproxime.tely 0.030 
per cent. 

Brooks Loam; This soil represents the Brown Soil Belt, 
■^hls belt covers the entire south-eastern part of the 
Province, consisting v/holly of plains land, and cover¬ 
ing approximately thirteen million acres. Within this 
region a.re found our main "alkali” areas. The soils of 
this belt are fairly well supplied with essential plant 
food elements excepting nitrogen. They are, hov/ever, 
considerably lower in organ'^ c matter content than the 









12 

Black Soil Belt soils; this difference is attributable 
to a lower average rainfall, which varies from 12 to 15 
inches, and the prevalence of warm winds. These two 
factors combined, have restricted the growth of 
vegetation and likewise the accumulation of organic 
matter residue. These factors, also, have prevented 
the profitable cultivation of much of this area, and . 
hence only a small proportion is being cultivated, ihe 
brown loam used in this investigation has a nitrogen 
content of 0.131 per cent; soils from the same locality 
carry 0,045 per cent of sulfur, 

i;XI?S R IT£5hTAL j\E]TH01)S . 

The organic matter used in the experiment was 
cured, green sweet clover, finely ground. The super¬ 
phosphate . used is a,-recent product of the Trail, B.G, 
smelters; this fertilizer was finely ground to insure 
thorough distribution v/ithin the soil samples. Calcium 
carbonate (C,P.) was used as a source of lime, and 
ordinary flowers of sulfur as the elemental sulfur con¬ 
stituent. All experiments were carried on in duplicate. 

The soils used in the tumbler experiments were 
ground to pass a 20 mesh screen and thoroughly air dried 
at room temperature.100 grams samples of the air-dry soil 
were v/eighed into glass tumblers and the computed fertilizer 
mixtures thoroughly mixed with the dry soil. The tumblers 
were labelled and distilled water added to the samples to 
60 per cent of the water-holding capacity of the soil. 

The tumblers arere stoppered with perforated covers and 




13 


then incubated in a dark cupboard at room temperature, 
which varied from 18 to 25^0* Twice a week the tumblers 
were stirred with a spatula and more distilled water 
added, if necessary, to bring the tumblers up to weight. 

At the end of the incubation period the samples 
were weighed and each divided into halves. 25 greans of 
one half of the moist sample vv’as used for the determin*- 
ation of the hydrogen-ion concentration of the soil 
sample. The other half of the sample, representing 50 
grams of the original sample, wa.s oven dried at 110 to 
llo^C for 48 hours, after which it was analysed for its 
v^ater soluble sulfates. The soluble sulfates ¥/ere de¬ 
termined in the usual nay adopted in sulfate analysis, 
the sulfur being precipitated and weighed BaS04« 

The samples'\Yere heated and v/elghed alternately until 
two consecutive weighings of each sample agreed within 
0.0005 gra.ms of each other. 

The soil reaction was determined colorimetrically, 
using a set of buffer solutions prepared according to 
dlark (4) and checked against a potentiometer. The 
moist 25 gram samples, taken as stated above, were pla.ced 
in shaker bottles and 50 cc, of C02“-ree distilled water 
a,dded to each; the bottles were then agitated on a wheel 
for 30 minutes. The supernatant liquid ^ras filtered 
through a Buchner filter, previously .washed with COg-free 
water. The first 10 to 15 eo nortion of ea.ch filtrate 
was discarded after having rinsed the receiving flasks*

S^CPERII'ISirrAL RESULTS. 

The results of the laboratory experiments with 
sulfur oxidation in the soils from the three., soil belts 
are reported in tables 1 to 4* 

As stated elsewhere, the experiments were conducted 
in duplicate. From a perusal of the data it will be 
noted that the results reported a.re based on the averages 
of the duplicate samples for each period. ^Aliile ’in some 
instances the duplicate analyses failed to produce close 
agreement, as is frequently the case with biological 
investigations, yet, on the vfnole the differences are well 
within the x)robable error of the method. Therefore, in 
the interests of simplicity and to facilitate a numerical 
comparison of the results obtained, the individual results 
of analyses have not been included in the tabulated data. 

Table 1 gives the results of sulfur oxidation in 
the Beaver Lodge loam. The samples receiving no sulfur, 
changed in soluble sulfates to some extent as the in¬ 
cubation period- progressed, though on the whole they 
remained fairly constant. 

In considering the rate or velocity of the reaction 
as distinct from the total amount of sulfate produced 
at the end of each period there are apparent differences.

Tor the sulfur treatments the increments at the end of 
each i3eriod over the period immediately preceding (hottom^ 
1st column each period), after subtracting the sulfates 
of the untreated samples, were as follows: 211, 994, 234, 

- 289 and - 16 at the end of 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 vreeks 
respeotiYely* Prom a consideration of thes^ figures it 
at once becomes apparent that the Yelocity of the re¬ 
action had reached a maximum at the end of the 4-week 
periode The peak of the total sulfate accumulation,how¬ 
ever, was not reached till after six weeks, when 70 per 
cent of the added sulfur or 1439 pounds, ha.d accumulated 
as sulfate* A drop in total sulfates is noticea.ble at 
the 8-and lO-week periods® It is doubtful, hov/ever, if 
this difference is significant® Evidently oxidation was 
only proceeding slowly?-, if at alL, or the sulfate was 
perhaps' reacting with certain soil constituents to form 
insoluble compounds which, in turn, would not be included 
in the soluble sulfate figures* 

If the results for the supplemented sulfur 
treatments, after having subtracted the sulfates due to 
the supplementary fertilizers, are analysed in the same 
mauiner it is noticeable at once that they all had the 
maximum rate of oxidation during the first six weeks of 
incubation* 

Prom the sixth to the tenth week of incubation 
there was a slowing down of the rate of oxid.ation or the 
sulfates have been transformed to the insoluble state*

The maximum acoumulation of sulfates has oocurred, in 
all three cases, at the end of ten weeks. 

In order to determine the effect of the 
supplementary fertilizers on sulfur oxidation, It is 
necessary to calculate the sulfate increase or decrease 
of the supplemented sulfur treatments as compared with 
sulfur alone. In table 4 is a summarized report of the 
data contained in the second -column of each incubation 
period of tables 1 to 3, From an inspection of table 4, 
it is apparent that^ after a somev/hat beneficial effect 
during the first two weeks of incubation, all supplements 
have retarded oxidation till after the 8-week period in 
the Beaver Lodge loam. At the end of the 10-wsek period 
there is a beneficial effect in all eases. The addition 
of organic matter and calcium carbonate caused con¬ 
siderable retardation in the oxidation process during 
part of the incubation period. The differences 
attributed to the suppleraents are in the same direction 
for all three treatments and moreover, at the beginning 
of the period, are of such magnitude as to be beyond the 
limit of the probable error. \^ere the differences are 
within the limits of probable error they are, neverthe¬ 
less, supporting the same conclusion as is derived from 
the more significant figures. 

In order to ascertain if elementary sulfur would be 
oxidized in dry soil without the aid of much biological 
activity, an analysis was made of dry soil, and dry

soil to which sulfur had been added at the same rate 
as used in the tumbler experiment. The average of 
duplicate samples, treated with sulfur at the rate of 
2,000 pounds per acre, gave 234 and 240 pounds of 
sulfate sulfur per acre at the end of 2- and 4-weeks 
incubation periods, respectively, '^he duplicate un¬ 
treated dry soil samples gave a.n average of 329 pounds 
of sulfate sulfur per acre after a 2-week period of in- 
cubcition. The difference in the results are not con¬ 
sidered significant and as the greater sulfate sulfur 
content wa.s obtained from the untreated samples, serve 
only to emphasize that little oxidation of sulfur takes 
place in soil over a short incubation period without 
the aid of biological agencies. 

In table 2 are presented the data covering the 
sulfur oxidant ion in the Pigeon Lake loam. The oxidiz¬ 
ing power of this soil, as revealed by the figures, is 
on the whole much lower than tha.t of the Beaver Lodge 
loa^^ The results for each treatment \vhere sulfur was 
added show a gradual upward trend with smellier fluctuations 
and only a few larger divergencies of any importance 
(5’ig.l). 

The untreated samples and the samples treated with 

calcium carbonate and with organic matter all remain 

at 

fairly constant and^about the same level in their sulfate 
content throughout the period of incubation. The super-

phosphate treated samples also remained nearly 
constant, but at a higher level of sulfates, as the 
fertilizer contains some sulfate. 

The supplementary treatments (Table 4 and fig.l ) 
have had less effect on the rate of sulfur oxidation 
in this soil than in the Beaver Lodge soil under 
similar treatment. ¥/ith two exceptions (GaG 03 after 
the 2-weeks and clover after the 6-weeks incubation 
periods), all supplements have depressed sulfur 
oxidation till after the 8-weeks period. Clover and 
calcium carbonate produced a beneficial, effect during 
the 10-weeks incubation period. The superphosphate 
on the other hand, has had a depressing effect on 
sulfur oxidation throughout the period of incubation. 

It is noteworthy, however, that the sulfur and the 
sulfur supplemented treatments, excepting clover, all 
fluctuated in a most erratic fashion (see table 2)» 

The organic matter on the other hand, had a stabilizing 
influence on the sulfate production, showing a steady 
and gradual increase in soluble sulfates as the in¬ 
cubation period progressed (See fig, 1), This observation 
is in accord'with the results obtained with the Beaver 
Lodge loam, although in the latter the effect is less 
marked, which is to be expected with soil already rich in 
organic matter.

of sulfur oxidized, obtained with the sulfur treatment 
after eight weeks of incubation, was less than 50 per 
cent of the quantity of sulfur added. 

The sulfur oxidizing power of the Brooks loam 
was studied sepa.rately after the Beaver Lodge and Pigeon 
Lake experiment had been completed and the data were 
available. As these data indicated that considerable 
sulfur remained unoxidized, it was considered desirable 
to extend the incubation period somewhat in order to 
ascertain if a greater percentage of sulfur would be 
converted to sulfates. And, as certain preliminary soil 
reaction studies had revealed that the reaction was but 
little affected by the 2,000 pounds sulfur application, a 
larger application of sulfur (6,000 lbs,) was also in- 
eluded in the experiment, Further, it was decided to 
limit the scope of the experiment by omitting the 2- and 
4- weeks incubation periods. The results of the modified 
experiment are recorded in table 3. 

The Brooks samples receiving no sulfur, like those 
of the two preceding soils, remained fairly constant 
throughout in their sulfate content. The superphosphate 
treatments again were at a higher level of sulfates than 
the other treatments not receiving sulfur. As the super¬ 
phosphate undoubtedly contained some sulfates, the results 
for this fertilizer alone cannot in any sense be considered 
as indicating the production of sulfates over that of the

untreated samples. If the sulfates of the untreated 
soils are subtracted from the superphosphate treated 
samples after each incubation, for all three soils, 
it is seen that the figures approach a constant which, 
with one exception (Beaver Lodge, 4-weeks period) lies 
between 300 and 400 pounds of sulfate sulfur for the 
particular rate of superphosphate application (4,000 
lbs, per acre), 

"Vhere sulfur was applied alone the samples receiv¬ 
ing the 2,000 lbs. application had 50 per cent of the 
sulfur oxidized at the end of 6 weeks and only slightly 
over 60 per cent at the end of 14 weeks. With the 
application of 6,000 lbs. of sulfur per acre approximate¬ 
ly 30, 37 and 53 per cent of the sulfur had been 
oxidized &,t the end of 6, 10 and 14 weeks respectively. 

These figures indicate that the sulfur oxidizing 
microorga,nisms are irioapable of oxidizing as great a 
percentage of the sulfur when large applications are 
made, although the total amount of sulfur oxidized is 
about tv;ice as great with the 3-ton as with the 1-ton 
application,(upper part table 3). 

The sulfur supplements, after some fluctuation 
throughout the period, appear finally to have had a 
slightly detrimental effect. The sulfur alone behaved 
as erratically as any treatment, a.nd it is difficult 
to drav/ a definite conclusion as to the effect of the

supplements. 

If a comparison of the three soils is made it 
is apparent, judging-from the untreated lots, that the 
Beaver Lodge loam, is from one and one-half to two- 
times as high in native sulfates'(210 to o30 lbs. 
sulfur) as the two other soils. The Brooks loam is 
slightly higher in sulfates than the Pigeon Lake loam, 

(140 to 160 and 90 to 150 lbs. sulfur, respectively). 
Similarly, if the oxidizing powers of these soils are 
compared (See fig. 1), they again range themselves in descend¬ 
ing order of native sulfates, the Beaver Lodge loam 
being first a.nd the Pigeon Lake last. The Beaver Lodge 
soil, however, is only slightly more effective than the 
Brooks loam,and both are considerably more efficient 
than the Pigeon Lake soil. 

It is quite apparent that all three soils possess 
a definite and vigorous sulfur oxidizing power capable 
of converting added sulfur into soluble sulfates. 

Again, the effect of the supplements has varied 
with each soil. It is noticeable that in the Beaver 
Lodge loam, clover and calcium carbonate caused con¬ 
siderable retardation of the sulfur oxidizing processes, 

■^ith the Pigeon Lake loam the general tendency was for 
supplement treatments to cause a retardation of sulfur 
oxidation, superphosphate the only treatment causing 
retardation of any importance*

THE E?Fi-JCT Q? EERTILTZERS OH THE l:OIL I!EACTIOH . 

In table 5 are recorded the results of the in¬ 
vestigation into the effect of fertilizers on the soil 
reaction. It will be noted that certain fertilizers 
used in the sulfate experiments have been excluded. 
However, a preliminary part of the investigation had 
revealed that the excluded fertilizers had no apparent 
effect on the reaction of the soils under investigation; 
hence the elimination. 

At the beginning of the experiment the air-dry 
Beaver Lodge and Pigeon Lake soils were slightly acid 
and the Brooks soil slightly alkaline in reaction. 

These reactions, however, are all well within the limits 
for normal productive soils. 

The Beaver Lodge loam has remained practically 
una.ffected by all treatments, although there has been a 
tendency to approach nearer to the point of neutrality 
as the incubation period progressed. This soil apparent¬ 
ly possesses a tremendous buffer capacity as shown by the 
unchanged reaction after the addition of 6,000 lbs, of 
sulfur per acre, of which in all probability at least one- 
half had been oxidized at the end of 14 weeks (Table 3), 
Por the Pigeon Lake loam the reaction also tended 
towards neutrality except v/here sulfur had been applied. 
The one ton sulfur application had changed the reaction 
from pH 6.2 to pH 5.6 at the end of 6 weeks. 


However, 




r 





[ 


c 




29 


this increase in hydrcgen-ion concentration was not 
maintained at the end of 10 weeks. 7ith the three 
ton sulfur application there was a pronounced change in 
reaction, the duplicate samples giving a pH of 3.5 and 
4,4 at the end of 6 weeks. This was subsequently re¬ 
duced to pH 3.4 and 3.2 after 10 and 14 weeks respectively. 
This soil possesses a lower oxidizing power than the 
Brooks loam, hence it is safe to assume that less than 
one-half of the sulfur added had been oxidized at the 
end of 14 weeks, and yet, if compared v/ith the latter, 
a higher hydrogen-ion concentration had been obtained. 

The net result v/ould therefore indicate that the Pigeon 
Ir-ke loam possesses a somewhat lower buffer capacity 
than the Brooks loa.m* 

The results for the Brooks loam are very similar 
to those of the Pigeon Lake loam, if the fact that a 
slightly alkaline soil was used to begin with, is con¬ 
sidered. The one tom sulfur a^pplication v/as sufficient 
to reduce the pH from 7.2 to 5.8 at the end of 6 weeks. 

This reaction, ho¥/ever, was not subsequently retained 
at the end of 10 and 14 weeks. 7ith the three tons 
application of sulfur a hydrogen-ion concentration of 
pH 5.3 had been obtained at the end of 6 wee'.'s. This 
hydrogen-ion concentration was increased to pH 4.2 at 
the end of 10 weeks and ma.intained at 14 weeks.

GRSE!T HOUSE EXPER IT.IENT, 

An experiment was conducted in the green house 
with Beaver Lodge and Pigeon Lake soils for the purpose 
of studying the effect of sulfur, supplemented or alone, 
upon the growth of inoculated alfalfa. Ordinary one- 
gallon earthenware pots were used as containers. The 
pots received the same rate of fertilizer application 
as used in the tumbler experiment. However, the growth 
of alfalfa was uneven and gave such irregular yields that 
the data obtained are deemed valueless and consequently 
are not presented. The reaction was determined on each 
pa>t of soil at the end of the experiment, but the results 
obtained failed to show any significant differences which 
might explain the irregular yields of alfalfa. 

SIPf£4RY OP IIETHQBS. 

The sulfur oxidizing power of three soils, each 
from one of the major soil belts of the province, was 
determined by laboratory experiments. The soils plus 
their treatments, were placed in tumblers, water was 
added to 60 per cent of the vmter-holding capacity of 
the soils, and the tumblers incub^3,ted at rooroi temperature. 
The soils were analysed at definite intervals over a 
period of lo to 14 weeks. 

The trea,tments consisted of sulfur at the rate of 
2,000 and 6,000 lbs. per acre. The effects on sulfur 
oxidation caused by supplementing the sulfur treatments

v/ith calcium carbonate, superphosphate, and organic 
matter were ascertained. 

The sulfur oxidizing pov^er was estimated by deter¬ 
mining the amount of sulfur converted to water-soluble 
sulfates in a given time. The sulfates were determined 
gravimetric-ally, being precipitated by BaCl 2 s^nd weighed 
as BaS 04 . 

From a consideration of the sulfate data, after 
having subtracted the native soil sulfates and the sulfates 
due to supplements, the effect of such supplements on 
sulfur oxidation was determined. 

A separate experiment (necessitated by unsatisfactory 
results obtained with the Berkfeld filters employed at 
first) was conducted for the purpose of measuring the 
effect of the sulfur treatments on the hydrogen-ion con¬ 
centration of the soils. The soil reaction was determined 
colorimetrically, using a standard set of indicators 
prepared according to Clark (4). Pot culture experiments 
with the same soils were conducted in the green house for 
the purpose of studying the effect of sulfur, alone or 
sux>plemented, upon the growth of inoculated alfalfa. The 
yields of alfalfa obtained were so irregular that the data 
obtained were considered va-lueless. 

3ULfI4RY OP RESULTS.

under investigation all possess a definite end vigorous

sulfur oxidizing power. 

In all three soils the sulfur oxidized at the 
greatest rate during the first six weeks of incubation. 

^<7ith 2,000 lbs. of sulfur per acre the amounts converted 
to water-soluble sulfates after 6 weeks incubation v/ere 
(max. and min. of all treatments) 50-72, 44-50 and 16-35 
per cent and after 10 v^reeks, 57-73, 46-62 and 30-40 per 
cant for the Beaver Lodge, Brooks and Pigeon Lake soils 
respectively. 

A marked difference exists in the sulfur oxidizing 
povfer of the three soils, studied. The Beaver Lodge loam 
possesses the highest oxidizing capacity, the Brooks 
loa-rn coming next ¥/ith a somewhat lower capacity and the 
Pigeon Ladce loam ranking third, with only slightly better 
than one-half the. capacity of Beaver Lodge loam. 

A significant difference exists in the percentages 
of sulfur converted to sulfates with sulfur applications 
of 2,000 and 6,000 lbs. per acre. In the Brooks loam, 
the percentages converted to sulfates at the end of 6 and 
14 vreeks of incubation are 29 and 52 per cent, respectively, 
for the 6,000 lbs. of sulfur, and 51 and 62 per cent, 
respectively, for the 2,000 lbs. of sulfur application. 

The actual amount of sulfur converted to sulfates v/ith the 
6,000 lbs. sulfur treatment is about twice as great as with 
the 2,000 lbs. sulfur treatment., 

The supplementary fertilizers d.id. not consistentely 
increase or decrease the rate of sulfur oxidation in the 




.1 



1 , 





T 






33 


soils, except in one case, in which superphosphate 
was added to '.Tooded Belt soil (Pigeon Lake loam). 

Tn this case the quantities of sulfur oxidized were 
less at the end of each incubation period than where 
sulfur alone was added. The organic matter (clover) 
had a stabilizing effect on sulfur oxidation in all 
soils tending to produce a steadier increase in 
sulfur oxidized throughout the periods of incubation. 

ITo direct correlation exists between the amounts 
of sulfur oxidized and the change in hydrogen-ion con¬ 
centration with treatments up to 6,000 lbs. of sulfur 
per acre. 

The 2,000 lbs, application of sulfur had produced 
a significant change at the end of 6 v;eeks in the Brooks 
and Pigeon Lake loams. This depression in "pH. value, 
hov/ever, was not,sustained at 10 and 14 weeks, the soils 
having reverted approximately their original reaction. 

\?ith the 6,000 lbs, of sulfur e-pplication the 
Pigeon Lake and Brooks loam experienced approxirae.tely 
the same numerical change in ,pH values. Using the 
dry soil 'pH as basis, the change in the reaction, over 
the same period, was from IpH 7,2 to 4.2 and 4.2. 

These results tentatively indicate that betv^een 2,000 
and 6,000 lbs. of sulfur per acre ¥/ould be required 
to inhibit the potato scab organism under la.boratory 
or green house conditions. 

The Beaver Lodge loa.m possesses a tremendous buffer

capacity, as even the larger sulfur applic-itions 
failed to create any apparent increase in the hydrogen- 
ion concentration of this soil.
