WILD FRUITS OF THE PRAIRIES 
THEIR CHARACTERISTICS AND SOURCES, 
PROPAGATION, AND CYTOLOGY. 


Percival Duncan Hargrave. 


GENERAL INTRODUCTION. 


Wild fruits would seem to provide promising material 
for selection and breeding work in horticultural development 
in Alberta and other prairie provinces. Genera that are 
available in wild form in the prairie provinces, include the 
following: Gorylus, Grossularia, Ribes, Fragaria, Rubus, 
Amelanchier, Sorbus, Crataegus, Prunus, Vitis, Shepherdia, 
Vaccinium, Sambucus, and Viburnum. 

An effort has been made in this investigation to locate 
specimens with characteristics which appear to be of outstand¬ 
ing value and to propagate these plants at the University of 
Alberta for comparison with other selected plants. Meanwhile, 
it has been necessary to solve certain difficulties encountered 
in gemination of seed. The considerable variation that has 
been apparent in the plants of a given genus, or species, 
collected from scattered points, has been studied from a tax¬ 
onomic standpoint, particularly with respect to identification 
of the specimens. A cytological study, especially on chromosome

PART I. 


CHARACTERISTICS AND SOURCES• 


Factors That Affect Distribution* 


Distribution of wild fruits in the prairie provinces 
of Canada has been determined by a number of factors* such as 
the area involved, elevation* vegetation zones* temperature * 
and rainfall* These are reviewed briefly to present a pre¬ 
liminary sketch of the scope of the work* 

Area *- 

The prairie provinces extend from the 49th parallel to 
the 60th parallel and approximately 1*100 miles from eastern 
Manitoba to the western border of Alberta* The area involved 
is 753*497 square miles* 

Elevation •- 

“Each of the provinces provides a fairly distinct steppe 
in elevation* The elevation varies, in Manitoba* from 500 to 
1*000 feet; in Saskatchewan, from 1,000 to 2,000 feet; and, in 
Alberta* from 2*000 to 5*000 feet. The first prairie steppe 
Includes the Manitoba plain west of the elevated portion bounded 
by the Pembina* Riding* Duck* Porcupine, and Pas Mountains* The 
second prairie steppe extends from the first one westward to a 
line from longitude 103° 30 ! and the 49th parallel in a north¬ 
westerly direction to Battleford* The third prairie steppe in¬ 
cludes the western part of the prairie provinces to the foothills*

Vegetation zones.- 

~ There are three main vegetation zones. They run at 

right angles to the three steppes and are closely allied with 
soil types (Pig* 1)o

The three main vegetation zones are: (a) northern 
coniferous forest; (b) deciduous forest; and, (c) prairie. 

The deciduous forest is not well defined. The northern 
coniferous forest extends into the deciduous forest and this, 
in turn, into the prairie, especially along rivers and stream 
valleys. 

There are two types of deciduous forest. The first, or 
oak, divides the deciduous forest of the east from the true 
prairie. The second, or poplar, stands between the northern 
coniferous forest and the true prairie . The deciduous forest 
area extends from the 49th parallel in Manitoba in a curved 
line, first towards the northwest, through Saskatoon to 
Stettler, and then south along the foothills. 4- - parkland - ar e a- 
o r aspen consociation - b e- tw - een prairie and deciduous forcet 

e xtends into the prairie -. The deciduous forest varies in width 
from 25 to 150 miles and is generally considered as a climax 
community. Moss (57) . Bird (8) has divided the poplar com™ 
munity into three parts: (a) prairie community; (b) willow 
community; and (c) aspen community. 

Wild fruits are found mostly in the* deciduous forest, 
in the park very dark brown soil area; in the transition timber 
and park soil area, and, to a more limited extent, in the 
prairie plain dark brown soil area. Scattered clumps of 
fruiting shrubs also are found in the draws and coulees of the 
plains brown soil. The Cypress Hills, an unglaciated area, 
and the Qu»Appelle Valley, located in the plains brown soil 
area have numerous wild fruits. (Pig. 2*)

Rainfall 

Rainfall of the prairie provinces is discussed by 
Stevens, Hurd and Grindley (75), as follows: 

"in southeastern Alberta, a large part of western 
Saskatchewan, and generally in the northern regions of the 
three prairie provinces, the annual precipitation averages less 
than 15 inches. In a portion of sotitheastern Alberta and 
southwestern Saskatchewan, where the winters are fairly mild, 
where spring comes early, fall late, and the heat of the summer 
is often intense, the average annual amount is between 10 and 
12 inches. In eastern Saskatchewan, from the Touchwood Hills 
southeasterly to Moose Mountain creek, and generally throughout 
southern Manitoba, the annual amount exceeds 15 inches, while 
in a portion of the Red River Valley in Manitoba it exceeds 
20 inches • In a narrow strip close to the Rocky Mountains in 
southwestern Alberta, in the upper valleys of the Red Deer 
River and its western tributaries, as well as in a large portion 
of the basin of the North Saskatchewan River in Alberta, and in 
the basin of the Athabasca river, 15 inches is also generally 
exceeded. In the extreme southwestern portion of Alberta, the 
annual amount averages 20 to 30 inches." 

About 60 to 70 percent of the precipitation is from 
April 1 to August 31. Approximately one-half of the total 
occurs in June, July and August. 

The northern and western portions of Alberta, the 
northern part of Saskatchewan, and the greater part of Manitoba 
are covered with snow during the winter months. They suffer 
less from lack of moisture than the southern prairie portions

which frequently are free from snow covering during the greater 


part of the winter# 

Temperature•- 

Temperatures vary widely and suddenly in the prairie 
provinces# This in itself is a serious problem in horticultural 
development of hardy fruits. It is possibly equally as signifi¬ 
cant as low temperature readings# 

Temperatures of -20° to -30° F# are common and -60° 
to -70° Po have been recorded in the northern parts. In 
Alberta, temperatures of 60° to 75° F. are possible in mid¬ 
winter. The marked fluctuations in winter are limiting factors 

f IocVu&Uqqs 

in the adaptability of fruit plants. The reactions in temper¬ 
ature, however, are less severe as one passes from west to east 
and from south to north. The high temperatures in the south 
are frequently accompanied by warn, dry, Chinook winds. Alberta 
has, generally, the mildest winter of the prairie provinces 
followed in order by Saskatchewan and Manitoba (Fig# 3**) .

April is considered the first spring month with an 
average temperature of 55° F. at midday. Cold waves may occur 
during this time to lower the temperature to -5° P. It is 
during this period that the wood, fruit buds and leaf buds, 
having completed their rest period, are the most susceptible 
to injury. (Fig. 4*)

During summer, the western half of Alberta has almost 
a similar temperature from north to south* The northern parts, 
of the balance of the prairie provinces, are on the average the 
same as western Alberta but the southern parts have higher 
temperatures* The agricultural area of the Peace River averages 
a 30 day shorter growing season than that of southeastern Alberta, 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba,, (Pig* 5*-) 

Under the above conditions it is considered practically 
impossible to acclimatize cultivated varieties from regions with 
a milder and more equable climate* Development of improved sorts 
will undoubtedly require that at least one parent contribute 
hardiness. It is hoped that this work will serve to provide 
information and material of value for future work and breeding*

LITERATURE REVIEW 


Our knowledge of the prairie flora is based largely 
on the work of the Geological Survey of Canada and of a few 
botanical collectors• Some areas are well described, whereas 
others have been treated only in a general way. A review of 
the available literature, however, helps to give a picture of 
the distribution of the wild fruits. 

Geological Surveys .- 

The ear lie s t information of technical nature on the 
prairie flora is that given in the reports of the Canadian 
Geological Survey, then directed by A. R. 0. Selwyn. 

In 1875 and 1876 John Macoun (51) accompanied 
Selwyn on a geological journey which covered the territory 
from the Peace River across the northern part of the prairies 
via Edmonton to east of Prince Albert* The fruits noted as 
found in the district are listed in Table I, Column 15. 

McConnell (54) reported a list of the raspberries found 
in 1879-80 between Edmonton and the Peace River (Table I, 

Column 4) « 

Bell (7), in 1879-80, mentioned the fruits found in 
the territory which he covered. This represented the country 
north of Peace River, from Peace River to Edmonton and that 
drained by the rivers to the west of Hudson Bay (Table I, 

Column 5) • He gave the range of Primus ameri c ana Marshall 
as the Rainy River, the Red River, the lower part of the 
Assiniboine River and the southern end of lake Manitoba.

Prunus pennsylvan ica was described as being "widely distributed* 
extending nearly to the edge of the timber"* In his (6) report 
of 1881* he also included notes on the flora of the Lake of the 
Woods and adjacent country (Table I, Column 6) • 

Dawson (25), in 1887-88, described the country in the 
northern part of Alberta, the Yukon* and Northwest Territories 
and reported the northern range of Amelanchier alnifolla as 
parallel 58. His list includes the fruits (Table I* Column 7) • 
Reports of Botanists.- 

EewTs“7"Downing, and Moss (46) ; Dowding (28) ; and Moss 
(57), in 1928-32 studied the vegetation of central Alberta and 
described a number of communities which occurred in the parkland.® 
The fruits mentioned are tabulated in Table I, Columns 9* 10, 
and 11o 

Raup*s (60,61) flora of the Peace River district, the 
northern part of Alberta, the southern part of the North Wesfc- 
territcries and of Wood Buffalo Park describes and lists the 
fruits of the territory (Table I* Columns 3 and 8) • 

Rydberg (66,67) described many of the species which 
occur in the west (Table I* Columns 1 and 2) . 

Climate was found by Turresson (76, 77* 78) to influence 
a species and divide it into ©cotypes® This conclusion was 
drawn after working with transplanted material and from plants 
raised from seed gathered In different climatic areas. He 
found, that ear line ss increased and Might decreased from south 
to north. The biotypes of the species in one region were shown 
to be genetically different from. those in another®

Questions of Classification and Synonyms .- 

A survey of the literature on the flora of the prairies 

leads to the conclusion that many of the species are not 

clearly defined or the variations known* Is Amelancbier 

v. " ' 

alnifolia of all reports the same? Can we be certain that 
Prunus melanocarpa , P, demissa , and P, virginiana are all present 
in the same range or that Lon ice re villosa and Xylosteon caeru- 
leum are not the same under different environments? The American 
Cranberry bush ( Viburnum opulus americanum Ait . or V* trllobum 
Marsh and V» ame rica num as described by Darrow (19) is (or are) 
wia^lv distributed on the prairie* Are these terms synonymous 
with one another and with the V* opul us of Europe ? Darrow (19) 
segregated them according to fruit characteristics - the latter 
is described as bitter, and the former as clear and acid* 

Rozanova (65) in an investigation into geographical 
and ecological variation found that spinosity and glandulosity 
varied* She believed this variation to be geographical and 
ecological* This being the case, are Rubus strigosus and R* 
melanolasius ecotypes rather than distinct species? 

Another problem presents itself in, the Vaco i ni ace ae * 

(ktt) Pars 

Oxycoccus palustris Pers• and 0* macrocarpus two 

species which are easily set aside, have 0 * microcar pus Tarcz 
as an intermediate type? The question is whether the latter is 
a hybrid or a marked variation in one or the other A due to 
varying combinations of characters. Sinskala and Stchenkova 
(73) working with Vaoclnium uglinosum L* and V* myrtillus L* 
as well as with V* vltis-idaea found that there was no sharp 


difference between characters of ecotypes and concluded that

the wide variation must be due to genetic differences seg¬ 
regating and recombiiiiT# The difficulty encountered was that 
their material was not grown under controlled conditions due 
to the difficulties in propagation. 

The late D# W.Buchanan (9), in 1907, wrote as follows: 

"The European gooseberry and plum, both of which are 
now represented by numerous varieties of unsurpassed excellence, 
are said to be inferior in their original wild form to our 
native species. With this knowledge before us, there would 
seem to be no reason why some species at least of our wild 
fruits should not form the basis from which many fine cultivated 
varieties will in time be evo3,ved. To talk of our provinces as 
a fruitless region in view of the existence of all these native 
species, seems ridiculous* 11 

Buchanan realized the value of the native plum and made 
reference to the selection work that had been done on it up to 
that time and the introduction of seedlings of it from the 
United States* 

Since that time, the plum has received great attention, 
as also have the sand cherries Prunus besseyi and P* pum i la # 

The late George P. Chipman (11) has done much to make these 
and other fruits increasingly popular in western Canada# He 
realized the lack of any literature pertaining to fruit growing 
in the west# With his wide contacts he possibly had more 
knov/ledge of the horticultural work in the prairie provinces 
than any other one person and with this experience he made the 
following statement:

U I feel today that the delusion under which we have 
always labored — that because of our climate we are forever 
prohibited from growing worth-while fruit, is completely 
dispelled* 11 

Discussing the native fruits of the west Chi man 
points out that no work has been done with the native hazel¬ 
nut, the high-bush cranberry, or the wild pincherry, which 
he felt had possibilities* 

Rydberg’s (67) classification has been used throughout 
the text, except as otherwise noted* A number of the species 
reported in the literature have a number of synonyms. 

These are listed in Table II*

Material and Methods 


In order to make the collection as wide in ±t3 repre¬ 
sentation as possible various means of securing specimens were 
practised, such as: (a) correspondence with interested persons, 
and (b) personal trips* So far as possible, the personal 
knowledge of the type of country from which the material came 
was desired* Funds available made this possible for certain 
southern parts of Alberta where the author lacked personal 
observation* The northern part of the province was not visited 
because, although funds were available for this purpose, wet 
conditions during the times of year suitable for collection 
made a trip there impossible* 

Many contacts were made by personal correspondence* 
Without the aid of friends and parties interested in horti¬ 
cultural progress the collection would not have reached its 
pre sent proport ions * 

The specimens were collected during the spring and fall 
of 1934 and the spring of 1935* The work did not start until 
late in the spring of 1934* By that time the plants had leafed 
out, so the material collected was planted immediately it was 
received; hence, no attempt was made at that time to save 
cytologioal material* 

The fact should he home in mind that in collecting the 
individuals of a species from a certain location, it is the 
exceptional plant, in most cases, that has been taken.

The plants received in the fall of 1934 were heeled- 
in over winter and, along with the collections of the spring 
of 1935, were potted. The pots were plunged to the rim in 
soil and carefully watered. When the desired root material 
had been gathered for cytological study the potted plants were 
removed to the orchard and planted permanently. 

In the fall of 1934 and the fall of 1935 seed collect¬ 
ions were also made. Owing to the greater ease of obtaining 
these, the lower cost of transportation, and the possibilities 
of selection, a large part of the collection was obtained in 
this way. 

As soon as the seed was received it was washed clean 
and stored. Its further treatment will be discussed in the 
section on propagation. After germination, the seedlings 
were pricked-out into thumb pots, and then into 2§ u pots in 
which they were wintered in a root cellar. Early in January 
1936 they were moved to the greenhouse so that cytological 
material could be taken before planting out in the orchard 
in the spring. 

Both of these methods immediately limited, temporarily, 
the scope of the intended work® The problems of vegetative 
propagation and of seed germination had first to be dealt with 
and solved. The working out of this has taken a great deal of 
time and in turn has delayed identification. Successful 
transplanting of the fruit trees necessitated severe pruning 
and often cutting hack to ground level. The resultant growth 
has not yet, in a large percentage of the cases, been sufficient 
for identification. Seedlings obtained from seed gathered in

the fall of 1934 do not yet average 3 inches in height, and 
seed collected in the fall of 1935 is just commencing to 
germinate. 

As the material was gathered and planted it was system¬ 
atically labelled so that each plant could be readily identified 
as to its genera, place of origin, and the group with which it 
was gathered. The label numbers indicate the type of material, 
number of collection, number of plant in collection. When there 
are four numbers, the third number refers to a seed collection 
and the fourth to a number originating from one of the seeds. 

For example, 1-5-1 identifies a Saskatoon, the sixth collection 
made, and the first plant in that collection® Furthermore, 

2-3-1 -3 identifies a seedling Chokecherry, the eighth collection, 
the first group of seed in this collection, and the third seed¬ 
ling. 

Where shading, as in the Vaecinlaceae ,was necessary, 
special precautions were taken in this respect® 

Each genus was planted in the horticultural area at the 
University of Alberta in a section generously set aside for 
this purpose by Mr. George Hareourt (who has since retired) . 

The genera and species, where possible, were segregated and 
planted in rows 6 feet apart and 2 feet apart in the row. This 
spacing eventually will allow them to be care filly compared 
one with another. 

From time to time, as the plants have come into bloom, 
material has been pressed and species of the flowers preserved 
for identification purposes .

Amount and Sources of Collections* 


The transplanting and seed collecting which was started 
in the spring of 1934 is now represented by 580 specimens from 
178 collections* The collections represent widely different 
c 11-matic and ©daphic conditions. A large portion of Alberta 
is represented. Material from the balance of the prairies is 
representative but from widely scattered locations* 

Province 

Prairie^distriets from which collections have been obtained 
are: Alberta - Cypress Hills, Medicine Hat, Coleman, McLeod, 
Brooks, Carseland, Calgary, Midnapore, Banff, Windermere, 

Irricana, Howie, Morrin, Laeombe, Rocky Mountain House, Provost, 
Vegreville, Tofield, Hastings lake, Edmonton, FaIlls, Drayton 
Valley, Evansburg, MacKay, Edson, Obed, Clyde, Athabasca, Peace 
River, and Slave Lake; Saskatchewan - North Battleford, Saskatoon, 
and Maple Creek; Manitoba - Dropmor© and Brandon. 

The details of each collection can be found in Table III* 
The species name when known is given. No positive identification 
has been made and all are thus in a temporary state. It will 
be, on an average, two years before this can be accomplished. 

The origin, collector, type of material collected, and the date 
collected are also given. A few of the collections, due to 
adverse conditions, did not survive.

Characteristics * 


Corylus•- 

^Uhe northern parts and scattered southern parts of the 
prairie provinces have distributed over them, from east to 
west, one or other of the two forms of hazel nut* The species 
are Corylus cornuta , the beaked hazel nut, and G_* americana , 
the lipped hazel nut. Chipman (10) said of the native hazel 
nuts: 

“Growing all over our western provinces we have a 
valuable, but quite undeveloped, horticultural plant in our 
native haze3. nuts. They grow wild in various places all the 
way from the northerly limit of our agricultural settlement. 

Many families gather them in the autumn and have a pleasant 
pastime cracking hazel nuts for their tasty kernels during 
the long wintery evenings. They ape also used for cake, 
icing, candy, nut bread and other confections. Yet despite 
their great possibilities of development I cannot find that 
any one has ever cultivated them or that any selective breed-* 
ing work has ever been done with them. We therefore have a 
pioneer field in which to work* 11 

C. cornuta is the most widespread and shows the great - 
e s t variation. It is found as a small shrub 1 or 2 feet 
to 15 or 20 feet in height. Where it has a fair opportunity, 
without too much competition, the bushes are prolific bearers 
and vigorous growers. The nut of this type is covered with 
a husk that extends to form a beak. The husk is covered with

fine, sharp bristles that make harvesting unpleasant, 

C, americana , the lipped hazel nut, never becomes 
more than a small shrub and is confiend to Manitoba, eastern 
Saskatchewan, and the Cypress Hills, It is hardy where grown 
in other parts of the prair5.es and lends itself well to culti¬ 
vation and ornamental planting. The leaves of this species 
are brightly colored in the fall of the year whereas those of 
C, comuta turn to a golden yellow. The nut when ripe is 
exposed at the end, and the lip-like edges of the husk curl 
back. This makes the nut easier to remove, C» americana 
starts bearing younger than G, comuta , 

Both species are self-sterilG, sucker freely, and are 
attacked by the nut weevil. They can be propagated by suckers, 
from hard wood cuttings that have been stored over'winter and 
rooted in a propagating bench with gentle bottom heat in the 
spring, or by budding and grafting. 

In selection work with the hazel nut, care should, be 
taken to save the late blooming types and types with catkins 
which are resistant to frost, 

Amelanchier • - 

This is commonly known in the west as Saskatoon, Else¬ 
where it is known as Shadbush, June berry, Sha&blow, and 
Servieeberry, There are about 25 species of Amelanchier, most 
of which grow in North America, Of these, five have been 
reported on the prairie and are edible, 

A, alnifolia is the most widely represented. Under 
natural conditions and varying habitats it ranges from a small

shrub 3^- to 4 feet higji to a tree 20 feet high. It is on© of 

the few fruits that ranges from the northern to the southern 

limits of the prairies* It is even found in the coulees of 

the driest regions. In the aspen community^ Amelanchier forms 
sfroicim 

the middle strat a, and here it attains its greatest height* 

The racemes of white flowers are amongst the first to appear* 
Pull bloom occurred at Edmonton on May 26 in. 1935, which is a 
little later than usual due to the season. Earliness of bloom 
makes it subject to frost damage; otherwise, it is a consistent 
fruiter, and not siibject to periodic production* The fruit of 
different plants varies widely in quality, size, sweetness, and 
juice content* It resembles the Huckleberry in shape but lacks 
the tartness of flavour* When fully rip© the fruit is deep 
purple* There are exceptions to this as red and white fruit 
are found* These lighter colors are found occasionally in 
large clumps and likely have arisen by natural hybridization, 
or by mutation* The white-berried form is high in pectin and 
of sweeter flavor than the dark berried* 

The most promising type so far collected is from Saska¬ 
toon lake in the Peace River district* The fruit of the plants 
in this collection is superior both in size and quality* This 

higher quality seems to be inherent rather than environmental, , 

Under ccjlnv&hon, the QuahtY <of frcx\\ from the? Lck< 2 SasK^toon pitot's 

a - g under cultivation the yield and - quality is - imDroved - * 

continues, robe superior ro rhea of plenfs from other sources. 

The collection from Bropmore is from stock selected and 

re-selected by P* L* Skinner who is a very keen observer and

Under cultivated conditions, the Saskatoon is best 
grown in hedge row or clump and it makes an attractive 
ornamental planting* The plants are not particularly sen¬ 
sitive as to soil requirements* Under natural conditions 
they are found on both sour and sweet soils, and in partial 
shade or exposed to the sun* Material transplanted from the 
wild requires priming to the ground level* In fact, the best 
success in transplanting is obtained by the use of roots alone* 
Suckers may also be transplanted successfully if severely 
pruned* Nursery stock, grown from seed, is successfully 
transplanted without this severe pruning* Selected material 
can be successfully budded on other Saskatoon stock where it 
makes a good union and vigorous growth* The length of life of 
a budded stock has not been tested* Pruning of the old wood 
keeps down disease and increases productiveness* The wood 
sometimes is attacked by a fungus disease which causes witches 
brooms. The foliage is susceptible to a bacterial blight. 

The fruit is widely used in the fresh state, in preserves, as 
a beverage, and dried* 

Grossularia *- 

“Among the bush fruits the Gooseberry offers great pos¬ 
sibilities for the fruit breeder* The English type goose¬ 
berry is superior in size and quality but is not hardy and the 
American type is only half-hardy in most regions. At least 
six species occur in the prairies. G* missourlensis (Nutt) 

Cov* and Britt*, although not reported as occurring on the 
prairies of Canada, is common in Alberta south of a line 
from Coutts to the Cypress Hills* The other five species.

(Table II) , are widaspre a dover the q n tiro wo 3 They com¬ 
monly form the under-bush on hillsides, riverbottoms, and 
poplar bluffs. There is a wide variation as to 3pines, habit 

of growth, and flavour of fruit. The majority are very thorny. 

in color 

The fruit is acid to taste, black to yellov/. smooth, and low 
in yield. The plant collected by W. S. Watson at Colinton is 
possibly the exception in this regard. It Is completely spine¬ 
less, the fruit is sweet when ripe, and the plant is a vigorous 
grower# The one objection is that it tends to be prostrate in 
habit. This specimen has come from a moist, cool habitat# 

The most promising material seen during my experience 
is that commonly found northeast of Medicine Hat at a place 
called Bull Springs and in scattered sheltered locations from 
there to Maple Creek. 

Some characteristics of the various prairie gooseberries 
(ineluding Limnobotrya) are as follows: 

mlssouriensis (Nutt) Cov. and Britt. 

Strong upright grower, with few strong 
spines. The fruit varies in color from 
gold to dark purple and is well flavoured# 

2. G. oxycanthoides (L) Mill. Low in yield. 

Under natural conditions, fruit small, 
tasteless, black when ripe, and smooth. 

Bush medium size 9 fairly compact, and very 
bristly. 

5. G. cynosbati (L) Mill# Fruit tasteless, 
re&dish’^blacV, rounded and elliptical, 
pubescent or prickly. Bush large with weak 
spreading branches. The wood is usually 
slightly bristled with thin spines at the 
nodes . 

4. G. setosa (Lindl) Cov. and Britt. Very 
sfmTTar To G. oxycanthoides but not quite 
so bristly.

5. G« inermis (Rydb.) Cov. and Britt. The 
spine's "at the nodes are few and the inter¬ 
nodes are not bristly. The fruit has a 
glabrous skin. 

6. Gr* hirtella (Michx) Spach. Somewhat similar 
to & . oxycantholdes . 

7. Limnobotrya lacustris (Pers) Rydb. This 

specTes, although" natura1ly found in very 
damp, even wet, locations, grows well under 
cultivation. Both stems and fruit are densely 
bristly. 

Ribe s. - 

The currants are most abundant in the Parkland area. 

To the south and north of it they are found in scattered 
locations in river bottoms, in coulees, or where deciduous 
trees mingle with the conifers. Of the wild species, R. 
americanum Mill and ChrysobQtrya aurea (Pursh) Rydb. are of 
greatest interest. The fruit of the former is highly variable 
in quality, high yielding, larger than average, sweet and 
black. The greatest drawback is their uneven habit of ripen¬ 
ing. The bush is a strong grower, high and compact, but 
susceptible to miIdew. 

C. aurea is the tallest growing of our native currants 
and is found in the dry regions to the south* It is hardy and 
does exceptionally well under cultivation on the moist rich 
soil farther north. The fruit is variable in size and is 
larger than that of the commercial varieties but is very low 
in yield. The flavor and quality of the black (or yellow) 
fruits is superior in quality to that of the cultivated var¬ 
ieties and they seem to be resistant to the currant maggot.

R. glandulosm and R♦ t riste , the latter is the most important., 
This species is a trailer, is foimd in very moist locations 
and is resistant to mildew. The fruit is red, has a pleasant 
flavor, and is mild, sweet, and early. 

The strongest and best fruited plants so far in the 
collection are those specimens of R. amerleanum Mill, from 
Howie, Alberta. The plants are upright growers and seem to 
be free from mildew. 

Fra gar ia . - 

The strawberry, represented, by a number of species, is 
common in the wooded areas of the prairies and the foothills. 
Various forms are found in the shaded, woods and open grassy 
meadows. The fruit is highly flavored. The plants make many 
runners and are completely hardy, even with no snow covering* 
Of the forms represented, F* americana , (Porter) Britt, and 
F. glaunca (S.Watt) Rydb. are the most interesting, especially 
the latter. F. glatmca is either closely related to or a 
form of, F. chiloensis Duchesne which is one of the parents 
of cultivated varieties. 

The three groups in the collection show their marked 
difference in growth characters under cultivation. Here they 
will be much easier to identify than under natural conditions 
where environmental factors are involved* 

Rubus .- 

This c genus is divided into three classes (a) the 
raspberry, (b) the dewberry, (c) the group into which fall 
R. articus L. and R. chaemaemorus L.

The problem of Identification and classification with¬ 
in the first group of species is as complicated here as in the 
eastern states® Rubus melanolasin.s Focke is the most widely 
distributed. Species escaped from cultivation and hybrids be¬ 
tween them and wi3.d. species are common along highways and rail¬ 
road beds. Forms are found from the prairie community to the 
rocky shores of Great Bear Lake on the Arctic Circ3-e. They 
thrive equally well under both conditions » The flavor and hardi¬ 
ness exhibited make them of great value, although they seldom 
grow more than 3^- to 4 feet tall. The canes ape densely bristly. 
The plants collected from Fort Simpson are remarkably vigorous, 
although they seem to have a dwarfed habit. 

The dewberry is represented by R. pubescens Raf 3 This 
is widely spread in the moist woods, is a strong grower under 
c\iltivation, and is hardy, but is a poor bearer. Another 
species is reported from Manitoba, with a heavier type of wood 
and berries born singly. 

R. articus L. and R. chaemaemoru s L. are common in the 
muskegs. The latter extends beyond the line of tree growth in 
the north where the fruit is widely used. 

Sorhus•- 

It is not represented in the collection but is commonly 
found in the foothills and Slave Lake regions. 

Crataegus 

" Crataegus occurs in scattered clumps throughout the 
wooded areas. 

Primus . - 

The stone fruits comprise an important grotip on the 
prairies. Cherries and plums are represented. The former are 
most widespread from east to west and south to the far north.

Pmnus nigra and P, amerioana are confined in the wild 
to Manitoba and southeastern Saskatchewan. These two species 
are now widely cultivated throughout the west* They are fre¬ 
quently found at the fords of rivers in an apparently natural 
state, in groves which are possibly the result of pits dis¬ 
carded by early settlers and traders. Selected varieties in 
cultivation vary widely in color, size, and flavor of fruit» 
With protection from the wind, they are completely hardy over 
the entire west and endure extremely low temperatures without 
damage. The short growing season which prevents ripening of 
the fruit, is a more significant winter factor than is win.ter 
cold. Buchanan (9), in. tracing the history of plum improve¬ 
ment, pointed out that most of the improved varieties had 
originated from plums grown in Minnesota and Iowa. If breed¬ 
ing and selection work was conducted with selections from the 
farthest north points of their occurrence the season required 
for maturing should be reduced. 

Primus pumila L. and P. Besseyi Bailey are confined to 
the same ranges as the plums. A specimen of P . Besseyi has 
been obtained from The Pas district of Manitoba. During my 
inquiries or personal experiences I have not found it in the 
wild state in aiy part of Alberta. It has been reported in 
northern Alberta. However, these species are widely cultivated 
and selected varieties and hybrids between it and the plum 
(the sandcherry hybrids) are becoming increasingly popular®

Prunus melanoca rpa (A. Nels) Rydb* is a shrub or a 
small tree that reaches 20 to 30 feet in height and 4 to 5 
inches through the trunk* Like Amela ncb ier it is of wide¬ 
spread occtirrence, being found over practically the same 
range* The fruit is borne in racemes and is usu.ally black, but 
red and yellow fruited forms are present in the collection* 

The cherries are well known for their exceedingly astringent 
taste from which the species possibly derives its name* This 
puckery flavor disappears as the season advances or if the 
fruit is slightly frosted* 

W. J* Roughen of Valley River, Manitoba, found a native 
chokecherry with little, if any astringency* This variety has 
been called n Boughen*s Chokeless Chokecherry”* 

The habit of bearing the fruit in a raceme is variable• 
Frequently the raceme is broken up into a number of small 
racemes which hang in a cluster from the tree* This was very 
marked in the tree from which collection number 2-23-1 was 
gathered* 

Under cultivation, it tends to sucker, but this is not 
any more marked than with the Manitoba plum. Grafting or 
budding on P* maackii or P* grayana overcomes this disadvantage. 

Prunus pennsylvanica L. is a small tree which grows 
15 feet tall in Alberta, with a maximum trunk diameter of 3 to 
5 inches* It is most common in the parkland area, is very 
seldom found in the prairie, hut ex tends north to the limits 

Corymbs 

of timber* The fruit is borne on short racemes and blooms 
after the choke cherry* The cherry is dark red, thin skinned, 
and varies in acidity and size . Most of the trees do not set 
fruit well. Yeager and Berrigon (84) of South Dakota stated

that selected strains are heavy bearers© 

In discussing the improvement of the pincherry Chip- 
man (12) made the following statement: 

“in response to my request in the August isstie for the 
largest pincherries, I received quite a number of packages 
from Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. The largest one 
calipered an even one-half inch, the largest pincherry I ever 
saw, and came from 27 miles north of Brandon# The next largest 
was between the Lakes in Manitoba and calipered seven-sixteen¬ 
ths of an inch in diameter. Three others were notable for their 
extremely dark red flesh* All five of these had very firm 
flesh and retained their firmness for a considerable time* 

The very largest one was marked by an extremely small pit and 
all five were exceptionally mild and in flavor* 

,f I am of the opinion that we have been missing a bet in 
not improving the pincherry by selective breeding to develop 
large firm hardy cherries for jelly, jam, canning, pies and 
dessert. We have improved our wi3,d plum and our wild sand- 
cherry to a truly amazing degree by the simple method of grow¬ 
ing more seedlings, picking out the best and growing more 
seedlings, I am sure we can do likewise with pincherries * u 
Vitis .- 

The wild river-bank grape, V* vulpina L., is found in 
southern Manitoba. It is a vigorous vine when cultivated, 
does well wherever transplanted on the prairies, but needs 
careful protection* Mahonia aquifolium Nutt, the Oregon 
grape, is found in the southwestern corner of Alberta* Its main 
value is for ornamental plantings, hut the fruit, which is a 
small blueberry, is edible and good for wine*

Shepherdia.- 

GT"'the two forms, S« canadensis (L) Nutt, and S. 
ar gen tea Nutt, the fruit of the latter is the most widely- 
used, either wild or cultivated* 

S. canadensis is found in the deciduous and conifer¬ 
ous forest areas* It fonns a part of the lower shrub layer* 

The fruit varies in flavor but is usually insipid* That of 
the plants found growing in the sphagnum swamps is tart and 
is frequently used in the preparation of a relish* These 
latter plants tend to dwarfness in habit* 

S* argentea , the Buffaloberry or Bullberry, is a 
dioecious shrub with silvery grey foliage* It grows about 
10 feet tall. The branches are thorny making the fruit, 
which is bom on female plants, hard to gather* The fruit is 
small-seeded, is borne on large clusters, and varies from 
golden yellow to deep red when ripe* It is found most abund¬ 
antly in the prairie community and occasionally penetrates into 
the parkland* This shrub is possibly the hardiest and most 
drought resistant of our wild fruits* It is one of the first 
to bloom* The fru.it is ripe in July* When dried the fruit 
resembles currants in appearance and flavor* 

The collection has two groups of particular Interest, 
although the plants have not yet reached maturity* On© from 
North Battle ford has exceptionally large fruits, the other 
from Salomandick of Vegrevil3-e is the result of several years 
of selection* 

Vacciniaceae 

The cranberry, blueberry, and huckleberry are included 
in the family Vacciniaceae * There are four species of cran¬ 


berry on the prairies. Three of these, Oxycoccus macrocarpus

(Ait) Pers., 0, miorocarpua Furez, and 0« palustrls Pers 
grow on the sphagnum muskegs common throughout the northern 
parts of the prairie provinces. 0. macrocarpus is the species 
offered for sale on the markets and cultivated in the east. 

It has the larger, sounder berries, borne on bigger plants; it 
is hard to distinguish between 0, macrocarpus and 0. microcarpus . 
The berr5.es of 0. microcar pus and 0. pa Ins tr is are soft; and would 
not lend themselves to packing. No attempt has been made at 
cultivation in the northern districts and the wild product is 
seldom seen on the market. 

The fourth species, Vitis-Idaea punctata Moench, the 
mountain cranberry, has entered into commercial horticulture• 

In the fall of the year it finds a ready market and is gathered 
in large quantities in the northern districts• The plants form 
the ground cover,under open spruce and pine foldest as well as 
in the open moss covered glades« The foliage is evergreen and 
the berries remain edible throughout the winter and into the 
following spring. If carefully moved they have been found to 
thrive under cultivation on the Edmonton soils. 

The blueberr5.es and huckleberries ape widely represented 
in the northern districts of the praii?ie provinces and the 
foothilD.s of the rookies. The species vary in height from 2 
inches to 1§ feet. Where the people have made a habit of 
picking them for sale they frequently burn the large natural 
patches, but they are not cultivated commercially. The fruit 
is common on the markets in the fall and that of the huckleberry 
demands a premium. These fruits are possibly the most widely

commercialized type of wild fruit and as the natural sands dis¬ 
appear some attempt will be made to improve and cultivate them. 
If young plants are moved from the wild,early in the growing 
season, they will grow and fruit on the black soils. 

Sambucus•- 

The native elderberry is the least recognized of all 
the shrubs. Forestry men report it as occurring in a wide 
range through the forest reserves. The specimens in the col¬ 
lection were gathered at Obed at an elevation of 3,560 feet 
on timber slashing# The parent specimen was hardy and had 
reached a height of 10 to 12 feet, where the moose had not 
browsed it down (as they often do with this and Sorbus) . The 
berries found were a reddish purple in color and were borne in 
large clusters. The foliage is not finely cut® 

Viburnum«- 

-V. trll obum , the Pembina Berry or High-bush cranberry, 
is much more freq\iently eaten than V# e rad latum , the Sqimsh 
Berry. The latter occurs more commonly throughout the woods 
and river bottoms, but is not a heavy bearer and does not re¬ 
spond to cultivation. Three to four feet is the maximum height 
attained and there is only one single upright shoot in the 
majority of cases. 

The Pembina Berry is a shrub, 12 to 15 feet tall. Under 
cultivation, it will grow in direct sun or shade, thriving 
under both but in the wild it is found in shady moist places in 
lake and river valleys. There is wide variation in the shape 
and size of the fruit and of the clusters# It is one of the 
last fruiting shrubs to bloom, hence it is seldom damaged by 
late spring frosts and bears crops consistently# The fruit is

is ready for use as soon as it starts to color, when its 
pectin content is the highest. However, the clusters hang on 
the tree all winter and the fruit is fit for use at any time • 

The one objection to this fruit is the peculiar odor during 
cooking® This, however, is not usually carried over in the 
preserved form* 

Lonicera villosa or Xylosteon villosa are the edible 
honeysuckles of northern Manitoba, This handsome ornamental 
shrub grows to about 5 feet in height® The fruit is oval, 
bluish black in color and pleasantly edible« 

W. R, Leslie, in a weekly news letter late in 1935, 
Experimental Farm Morden Manitoba, commented on Lonicera vil ¬ 
losa as follows: 

’‘Local experience is that this northern Manitoba 
honeysuckle is more pleasing as desert and as a canned fruit than 
the Asiatic species known as the Edible Honeysuckle* Should 
the native not thrive here on its own roots, the Chinese proto¬ 
types may furnish satisfactory rootstock for it* The Sweet- 
berry Honeysuckle is usually not over 2 or 3 feet high, with 
branches and buds pointing upwards, and branchiate and leaves 
densely covered with fine hairs® The b&rk is yellowish brown 
and flaky. The edible fruit is blue, suggesting a gooseberry 
in shape, and although a large specimen may be nearly a half 
inch in length, many of the berries will be l/4 to l/3 inch 
long® Flavour resembles a moderately tart blueberry*"

Summary. 

An effort has been made to collect the various 
wild fruits on the prairie provinces and describe certain 
of their characteristics» The field explored has re¬ 
ceived little attention in the past in systematic fruit 
breeding projects* 

During the year and a half since the work was 
started the collection has reached appreciable proport¬ 
ions. Its value should increase with time for future 
classification, breeding, and genetic studies. At the 
present time, certain of the collections seem to be par¬ 
ticularly useful. Among these should be noted; (a) the 
plants of' Corylus americanum from Griffin and Skinner, 
and the seedlings of 0 a cornnta from the seed collection 
made by Chipman of the Country Guide; (b) in Amelanchier , 
the budded stock from Wilson, which came originally from 
Lake Saskatoon, the seedlints from Skinner, and the 
plants in the collection 1-10-1 to 1-10-6 from Griffin; 

(c) the gooseberry specimen from Watson; (d) the currant 
cuttings from Coutts, which are from exceptionally vigorous, 
drought resistant plants with high quality fruit ranging 
in color from yellow to purple; (e) the raspberry from 
Port Simpson; (f) in Primus , the collections 3-1-1 to 
3-1-5 were propagated from remarkably large trees; (g) 
the specimens in Shepherdia which have been mentioned and 


refer to 20-1-1 to 20-1-6, and 20-7-1-1 to 20-7-1-10

Some Idea of the distribution has been obtained and 
presented, and a further realization of the wide adaptability 
in the native genera has been made clear. Whether the inter¬ 
mediate and exceptional types are due to environment, natural 
hybridization, selection within the species, or mutation is a 
matter of conjecture. That they occur is a significant feature* 
With reasonable skill, the fruits can be cultivated, and with 
the exception of the vaoclneaceae , have responded vigorously 
to the treatment given them* 

If the native fruits contribute nothing but hardiness, 
a conservative assumption, this one good point is of great 
value* The value of hardiness to horticulture in the prairie 
provinces and its possibilities in organized breeding projects 
have been realized, in the apple* The Siberian crab ( Malus 
baccata) has contributed only the one valuable character of 
hardiness, but this has become associated with larger size of 
fruit, higher quality, and a number of other characters. It 
does not seem too much to assume that results comparable to 
those in the apple can be accomplished with the wild fruits of 
the prairie provinces*

SEED GERMINATION. 

Introduction. 


A recent publication (72) from the Department of 
Horticulture, University of Alberta^ with the present writer 
as a junior author, discusses the propagation of trees and 
shrubs from seed and was prepared in the course of this in¬ 
vestigation# That publication may be referred to for certain 
details on the subject which it seems unnecessary to review 
here. 

Due to the ease of securing the material and the 
lower transportation charges, a large number of the collect¬ 
ions, as mentioned previously, were comprised of seeds# 

Many of the collections were small and necessitated careful 
handling to obtain good germination# 

Little information was available on germination of 
many of the species collected when the study was begun# 

With the preliminary methods used, seed of some of the col¬

Literature Review 

Crocker (12) maintained that dormancy in seeds is 
associated with factors such as follows: (a) inhibition due 
to one or more of the processes which accompany germination, 
such as growth of the embryo or physical character of the seed 
coat; (b) seed coat failing to enter into both primary and 
secondary dormancy; (c) after-ripening processes which involve 
growth of a rudimentary embryo, fundamental chemical changes 
in a mature embryo, or chemical changes in the seed coat; 

(d) a relationship between embryo, dormancy, and seed coat# 
Eckerson (30) examined Crata egus seed each week dur¬ 
ing after-ripening at 5°c * She noted the following: (a) 
higher water-holding capacity and increase in acidity at an 
early stage; (b) increase in catalase and peroxidase activity; 
(c) replacement by sugar of the food stored as fat and oils, 
toward the end of the after-ripening period# 

Sherman (71) corroborated the work of Eckerson in 
relation to catalase activity, as did Davis (21) with Comus 
florida and Sambucus canade nsis # 

Pack (59) in experiments on after-ripening of 
Juniper seed found that the phosphatides increased, whereas 
the lipoids decreased. There was also an increase in acids 
and sugars• 

Flemion (31) found the same l^ees bion in S # auouparia 


as did Eckerson (30) in Gratae gns» and also that emu Is in

and amylase remained unchanged® Both the seed coat and the 
dormancy of the emhryo were inhibiting factors in S« aucu - 
paria . 

Crocker and Barton (17), Davis and Rose (24), Flemion 
and Giersback (31, 32), and Crocker (17), found that in most 
seeds in Rosaceae the germination is retarded by the seed coat 
and by doimancy of the embryo® These inhibiting factors can 
be overcome in Prunus and Malacese , Sorbus (31), Tilia. (4), 
Cotoneaster (38) , Pinus (5) , and Be tula (81), by after-ripening 
at temperatures slightly above the freezing point* 

Crocker (16) pointed out that stratification refers 
to the old, method of placing seeds and sand in successive 
layers and exposing them to cold or freezing conditions * 

The present method is to place the seeds in a suitable medium 
and hold them at a certain definite temperature* He further 
stated that the function of the medium is to give an optimum 
of moisture and air to the seeds while being held at the des¬ 
ired temperature* Sand, peat, or soil fulfill the requirements 
if they are free from injurious substances* In general, 
peat is best, as it holds a large percentage of water and still 
supplies good aeration® 

Crocker (15) stated that all work, up to that time, 
established that rosaceous seeds did not require freezing to 
complete the dormancy period. Freezing will not bring about 
after-ripening. 

Davis (23) found that oxygen was necessary for the 
after-ripening of Ambrosia seeds.

Flemion (33) wag able to obtain seedlings of peach* 
apple and hawthorn by removing the embryos and placing them 
under germinating conditions without after-ripening* These 
seedlings made very little growth for several months then they 
began to grow normally. 

Deliber (26) found that ethylene chlorhydrin and 
thiourea hastened germination of Norway maple* black oak* and 
red oak seed* Flemion (31) was unable to get any beneficial 
effect from these chemicals or many others in attempts to 
hasten the germination of Sorb us auouparia seed* She noted 
that seeds of Sorbus have a stronger dormancy than the seeds 
used by Deuber* 

Crocker (14) described a secondary dormancy in seeds. 
Seeds that had been partially or completely after-ripened,* if 
exposed to a high temperature* reverted back to their original 
doi*nant condition and required a second period of low temper¬ 
ature treatment* 

Crocker and Barton (17) found that Amelanchier 
canadensis germinated best after four months after-ripening at 
1°C* and £°C* After four months the seed started to germinate 
at the low temperature. 

Giershack and Crocker (39), in experiments with 'wild 
plum seed ( Prunus americana )* obtained better germination with 
a shorter period of after-ripening (less than four months)* 
when the seed was stored at room temperature before stratific¬

Davis (20) found that seed of Viburnum america num 
has two distinct developmental stages* The first is the 
growth of a rudimentary embryo which takes place at tem¬ 
peratures above 68° F® in about 60 days* The second is an 
elongation of the radical which requires about 60 days at 
40°to 50° P* After this, normal growth takes place in a 
greenhovise temperature of about 68° p # 

Davis (20), in work with Sambucus , explained the 
results of previous workers by showing that freshly harvested 
elderberry seed contains viable and dormant embryos® The 
former germinated, readily, whereas the latter required 100 
days at a temperature between 32°F. and 41°F., and then 
alternating temperatures, before germination took place. 

Materials and Methods in Germination of Seed® 

Work of 1934.- 

A"s“”'the collections were received, or made, in 1934, 
the seed was washed from the pulp by soaking in water. It 
was then dried, placed in paper envelopes, and stored dry, 
at room temperature, until December 12. The seed was then 
sown in flats containing soil* Each flat was divided into 
sections to avoid the possibility of mixtures occurring be¬ 
tween the collections® After sowing, the flats were well 
watered and taken to a root cellar where they remained for 
a period of 120 days® The temperature of the root cellar 
ranged between 1°G. and 4j-°0 ® On April 11, the flats of

of all collections were removed to the greenhouse and watched 
for germination* The dates of germination were recorded and 
a note made as to whether it was poor, fair, or good* 

All of the material received the same treatment, 
with four notable exceptions: (a) in collections of Cor ylus 
a part was stratified in sand for the same period and under 
the same conditions as for the main portion of the collection 
and a second part (100 nuts) was sown in a flat and exposed 
to greenhouse conditions; (b) the collections of Sambuous 
were divided evenly into two groups* One was treated, the same 
as the 100 nuts of Cory lus, the other was sown and placed in 
a root cellar; (c) each of the Oxycoccus and Vitis-Idaea groups 
were divided* One half was sown immediately on sphagnum, moss 
in aquarium chambers which were kept moist with snow or rain 
water* The balance of the seed, from these two groups, was 
sown in flats* The soil was from the same type as that on 
which the mother plants of Vltia-Tdaea were found growing* 

The flats were placed in the root cellar where they remained, 
until April 11; (d) the collections of Viburmim were sown the 
same as the remainder of the collection* However, instead of 
being placed in the root cellar they were exposed to a tem¬ 
perature above 68 °f. for two months * On February 18 they 
were removed to the root cellar for a further two months period 
at the low temperatures. The flats were removed with the bal¬ 
ance of the material on April 11* 

The flats of seed from these four special cases were 
treated the same as the remainder of the collections from the 
time they were removed to the greenhouse* The nuts of Corylus

that had been stratified in sand were sown in flats and placed 
in the greenhouse* 

As the seedlings became large enough, they were potted 
into thumb pots and gradually hardened off. Some of the seed¬ 
lings were shifted later to 2-J- inch pots. The material that 
was not shifted was planted outdoors. The Oxycoccns and Vitis- 
Tdaea seedlings were very small. Instead of potting them, they 
were pricked out into flats of soil, and grown under shade dur¬ 
ing summer* The soil was similar to that in which they germin¬ 
ated* 

Work of 1935 •- 

~ " The results obtained with the 1934 collections of 

Amelanchler and _P* renn s y 1 van le a were not satisfactory* In the 
hope of learning more in respect to their gerimatior, it was 
decided to test them farther during the winter of 1935-36* 

Seeds of honice ra oae rule a we re tested at the same time as 
Amelanchler and Prunus because this species had not been in¬ 
cluded in the work of the previous year* 

Care was taken to see that the seed was fully mature 
when gathered* The pulp was removed by washing and. care taken 
not to soak the seed longer than necessary* The Amelanchler 
seed was stratisfied on August 17* Sufficient for checks was 
stored dry* The seed of b* oae rule s- received the same treatment 
as that of Amelanchler * The seed of P» pennsylvanioa was 
divided into four groups* These were treated on August T3, 
as follows; (a) the first group was after-ripened in the 
regrigerator, (b) the second group was after-ripened in the 
root cellar, (c) the third group was stored dry until November

14, at which time it was stratified and after-ripened in the 
refrigerator, (d) the last group was kept dry as checks. 

The seeds were placed between layers of cheese cloth, 
in granulated peat, in petri dishes, all previously autoclaved 
for six hours. The peat tested pH 5.5, hence was slightly 
acid in reaction. The peat and seeds were examined periodi¬ 
cally for mold and moisture content. Mold that did appear 
was washed out carefully before returning the material to the 
refrigerator. 

The refrigerator was electrically cooled and regulated 
to the desired temperature of 1*J°C. to 3°C. The temperature in 
the root cellar varied from 2°G . to 4°C. but was constant at 
3 i°G* during the greater part of the time. 

At intervals of one month, the desired number of seeds, 
of each group, were removed from stratification. These were 
planted in flats, exposed to greenhouse conditions, and the 
germination recorded,. 

Preliminary Results * 

In 1934, a wide variation in seed germination 
resulted (Table IV and V), due, possibly, to the varying 
treatment of the seed before it was received. It should be 
noted that fair to good success was obtained with all seeds 
except those of Amelanohier , Prunus jpe nn sjl vanica and 
Viburnum » The first two mentioned were those tried again dur¬ 
ing the winter 1935-36. The seeds of Prunus me Iona car pa 


had started to germinate when removed from stratification

Pont* months (ISO days) of after-ripening gave satis¬ 
factory germination in all the cases treated similarly* The 
four special cases gave the following results: (a) in Corylus 
12 seedlings were obtained from the 100 nuts in the greenhouse* 
The balance of the nuts gave fair germination after 120 days of 
after-ripening* (b) in the two groups of elderberry seed, 
results similar to those of Gorybus were obtained* Each group 
of seed germinated but that group after-ripened for the four- 
month period gave much higher percentage of seedlings, (c) the 
seeds in the family Vaccineaoeae which were sown on sphagnum, 
did not germinate* Those sown in soil and after-ripened gave 
good hut slow germination* The seedlings did not grow quickly, 
having reached the two-leaf stage at the time of pricking out, 
and the four-leaf stage by the end of the growing season and 
were too small to handle* (d) the results with Viburnum sp* 
were not as high as expected. Only two seed samples gave any 
germination. (Collections 4-10-1 to 4-15-1, received from 
Chipman of the Country Guide, were the result of a contest 
held for the best seed clusters of V* triXobum. gathered in 
the prairie provinces.) 

Resuits in Amelanchier, Prunus and Lonicera * 

The results of germination tests conducted during 
the period 1935-36 are summarized in Table 6* 

With A* aLnlfolia. seed, no germination occurred in 
either check or treated groups until after the sixth month* 

When the seed was examined at the end of the seventh month it 
had germinated* Germination had taken place in refrigeration 
at a tempera fare between l|° and 3° C. at some time during 
the seventh month* The root tips had just emerged a short 
distance at the time of discovery.

The germination tests on Prunus pennsylvanicn 
have not been completed. The results to date are interest¬ 
ing in that not one of the four groups showed any germination 
up to the end of the fifth month. Furthermore, the checks, 
and the two groups stratified immediately on being picked, 
have not germinated to date. It is noteworthy that the group 
stored dry until November 14, and then stratified and after- 
ripened in the refrigerator, started to germinate after the 
sixth month. The percentage germination increased after the 
seventh month, and, at present, has reached 32 percent after 
the eighth month of after-ripening. The kernels and embryos 
to all appearances are still in good condition in all the re¬ 
maining groups. The seed in the check group, yet in a dry 
state, has not shrunken visibly® 

Lonioera coerules, gave 74 percent germination after 
the third month of after-ripening and a slightly higher per¬ 
centage after the next three months* The seed did not ger¬ 
minate at low temperatures, nor did the continued treatment 
lower its viability.

«LVl/rB A11 con i: rime- a 





(74 


Crocker and Barton (17) working with seed of 

Amelanchier canadensi s (L) Media found that it germinated 

of 

after three or four months/ after-ripening at temperatures 
of 1° C. and 5° C. Then the seed started to germinate at 
the lower temperature. In the present work. A, aIn1folia 
was found to require a much longer period of after-ripening 
at l|r 0 to 3° C., (200 days) which emphasizes the fact that 
requirements vary with individual species. The checks, which 
were not after-ripened, did not germinate. Furthermore, the 
tests have indicated that care must he taken to watch and 
remove the seed as soon as germination starts under the low 
temperatures. The results offer a possible explanation of 
the difficulty encountered by nurserymen in obtaining a 
-stand from seed sown in the fall as soon as ripe, whereby 
It is allowed to germinate whenever it is ready to do so. 

The ground usually freezes soon after fall planting with a 
resultant lowering of the temperature below which the seed 
is best held, consequently the after-ripening process stops. 
Between break up in the spring and the coming of warm days 
there is not/sufficient period of time with temperatures 
between 0° C. and 5°C. to complete the after-ripening 
process. The result is that the seed lies in the ground for 
another season and completes the process only when the soil 
temperatures become suitable. This would possibly occur 
the following spring. If the conditions are not suitable 
for growth after germination the seedlings will perish. 

An initial dry storage period, before stratification, 
hastens the gemination of P<, pennsylvanioa . In this species

germination started after 3 months of stratification with 
seed that had been stored dry and has increased each month, 
reaching 12 percent after the end of the fifth month, A 
longer period of dry storage might further shorten the after¬ 
ripening period, G-iersback and Crocker (39) , found that the 
seed of Primus americana stored dry for a period before strat¬ 
ifying at 5°C• improved in its ability to germinate over 
that of seed stratified as soon as harvested* 

Varying percentages of seed of Corylus cormvba 
germinate when freshly harvested and after a period of after¬ 
ripening, This bears out the belief that the embryos of 
Corylus enter dormancy at different times or have rest periods 
that are easily broken* 

Primus Beeseyi and P* grayana give high germination 
with a 90 day period of after-ripening. After this period 
they will germinate at a temperature very little above freez¬ 
ing, P, melanocarpa gives successful germination after a 
120 day period of stratification at temperatures between 1° 
and 8° G. A shorter or longer period is better if the seed 
is carefully watched and removed when germination starts* 

The seeds of Ribes and Rubus germinate successfully 
after 120 days after-ripening. Both required, however, long 
periods under greenhouse conditions. With Ribes , it would 
possibly be a better policy to expose the seed to after¬ 
ripening until it started to germinate, at which time it 
could be planted*

A percentage of Sambu cus seed will germinate as 
soon as gathered. If an early start is reqviired, sowing of 
the seed at this time might be an advantage but a higher per¬ 
centage germination is obtained if the seed is after- 
ripened. 

Shepherdia, Vaccinirm , and Vit I s gave good germin¬ 
ation after the ISO days stratification in the root cellar. 
Germination in Viburnum seed was not sat is fact or?/ except with 
the two collections mentioned in the results. The collections 
from Chipman were possibly gathered while the fruit was 
slightly imma ture• The y we re ne ve r c omple tely drie d out, 
being sown as soon as they were removed from the pulp. Col¬ 
lection 5-7-1, was gathered when fully mature but remained 
In the pulp until shortly before so?/ing. This may be the 
explanation for the results obtained.

Summary 


1. The optimum period for after-ripening has been determined 
for certain species, and the requirements for fair to 
good germination have been noted for otherso 

2 • A high percentage of germination results when seeds of 
wild fruits are subjected to temperatures of 1° to 5° C. 

3. When the period for after-ripening has been completed, 
seed of Amelanchier alnifolia and Primus pennsy lvanica 
will germinate at the low temperature of 1-J- 0 c. If not 
removed from the stratification median soon after germin¬ 
ation the seedlings will perish. 

4. Dry storage, at room temperature, shortens the period re¬ 
quired for after-ripening of Pru nus pennsylvanica a 

5. Germination in Lonicera , after reaching its high point, 
remains consistently high when the seed is held for an 
extended period at the after-ripening temperature. 

6. Seedlings of Oxycoccus microcappus , 0* macroc a rms , 

0. palustris , and Vitis-Idaea punctata can be germinated 
and grown for a year at least in soil, which is contrary 
to a widely held belief. 

7. Seed of Vibnrmvn tr 1 lob*vn and V iburnum eradiaturn should 
not be allowed to dry during the period between washing 
from the pulp and stratification, 

8. Oorylus and Sambnous have irregular dormancy periods.

PART III 


CYTOLOGICAL STUDIES IN THE WILD FRUITS 


Introduct Ion 


A knowledge of chromosome numbers of the native 
fruit species in the prairie provinces would aid greatly 
in breeding projects which'aim to incorporate valuable 
characters of these species. With this in mind, and with 
the hope of clarifying the classification, this work was 
undertaken* Chromosome numbers have been determined in six 
species native to the Wes#-* proarie prov\Dces. 

Literature Review 

The haploid chromosome number in Corylus americana 
and C* cornuta has been given by Wetzel (79) and Jaretzky 
(43) as 11* later work by Woodworth (82) showed that n= 14 
in C a cornuta Marsh and C * americana Walt* and that this 
number was constant for all the species in Betulaceae* This 
is interesting because of the close relationship to the 
highly polyploid species of Betula * He reported that in 
C* americana , at metaphase, there were three large clumps 
each composed of two gemini* Oytomyxis was frequent with 
migration of the chromosomes across the plasma bridge* The 
heterotypic divisions in Q.cornuta Marsh were irregular and

showed lagging chromosomes. Various counts from 8 to 14 
were explained by fusion of the chromosomes or their loss 
during cytomyctic migration. There was a noticeable dif¬ 
ference in the size of pollen, 5 percent of which was defect¬ 
ive • 

Meurman (55) found the somatic chromosome number 
to be 16 in twenty-two species of Ribes and their hybrids. 

The spec5.es investigated included R, aureurn Pursh, R , a merl- 
canum Mill,, R, la oust re (Pers,) Poir, and R, rnbrurn A, Grey, 
and R, oxycanthoides L, 

Xchijima (42) discussed the cytology and genetics 
of Fra gar la and included some of our native species. He 
found the chromosome numbers to be as follows: F« americ ana 
n = 28; F, virgin iana n s 28, He also reported F® ohi Teens is n 
« 28, This species is not indigenous her© but is related to, 
or is a form of, the native F, g lane a . 

East (29) stated that the haploid chromosome number 
of the F» yeses, type species is 7, that of F, elatior , 21, 
and that of F» ohiloensis and cultivated varieties, 28, He 
found that it was eas5.er to cross species with different 
chrome some numbers when the female parent had the lower 
number, except between F, elatior and F, chi 1 Persia types, 

Longley (48) re rented that the dioecious Rubus 
* 

chamaemoras is hexaplbld with 28 haploid chromosomes, He 
believed dioecism to be associated with polyploidy,

group# R# strigosus has a haploid chromosome number of 7# 

This count was determined from wild material and is the basic 
number for the genus« 

Amelanchier is not discussed cytologically in the 
literature# Weigand (80) found wide natural hybridization 
in the genus in the state of New York# A high percentage of 
the material examined represented hybrids of six well-defined 
species# Under natural conditions the species varied little 
but on land that had been ,r cut over M or disturbed, the hybrids 
were in the majority and in a state of flux# Rehder (63) 
described Amelosorbns , which is a natural hybrid of Amelanchie r 
and Sorbus # This provides an example of inter-generic hybrid¬ 
ization# Michurin (56) claimed hybrids of Sorbus and Mespilus # 
Langley (47) reported Crataepus rotundlfolla (Ehrh) 
Borckh as one of the few tetraploid species in the genus 
having 32 gametic chromosomes# 

Kobel (44) reported on various species of Prunus 
and gave the follov^Ing haploid chromosome numbers : P# seroti ha 
Agardh n ~ 16; P# pumila n s 8 ; and P# nigra Ait# n = 8# 

Dorsey (27) reported P. pennsylvanioa and. P» ameri - 
cana as having n ~ 10 a He showed that the majority of the 
plums with which he worked were self-sterile# His work in¬ 
cluded P# Besseyi , P* american.a , and P# salj.cira # 

Becker (5), in work preliminary to hybridization, 
found that Pi pennsy 1 vanica had n =8 and P# virginiana had 
n s 16# P# virginiana proved to be self-fertile, setting 
0*267 fruits per raceme when selfed. and 3.230 - 0.470 fruits 
when open-pollinated. Thus, fertility ’was reduced when the 
flowers were selfed# P, penns y Ivan lea yielded 1.3 percent

Okabe (58) reported that Prunus g ray ana and P. pa flu a 
both had n = 16 and that of P_. tomentosa had n = 8* 

Darrow (18) stated that P. tomentosa could be crossed 
to give fertile hybrids between it and triloba , P. Besseyi , 
and the horticultural varieties Montmorency, Napoleon, and 
Zumbra cherries• 

Angelo and Becker (2) reported n = 38 in the Beta

Vitis vulpina . 

No work has been done on Shepherdia , but Sobolervska 
working in the family Sleagnaceae, found n = 6 for E. angusti -

Materials and Methods* 

The root-tip material was obtained from plants 
included in the collection referred to in Part I. It was 
gathered during the summer of 1935 from potted plants which 
had gained sufficient vigor of growth* Collections from 
which root-tip material was gathered are marked with an 
asterisk in Table III* 

The root-tips were gathered between 10 A. M. and 
midday and fixed in Karpechenko*s solution* A modification 
of the methods of Navashin and of the University of California 
was used* The modification consisted of substitution of N- 
Butyi alcohol for ethyl alcohol during the final stages of 
dehydration* N-Butyl alcohol proved to be superior* The 
material was imbedded in paraffin* 

Imbedded material was section 8u to lOu thick and 
stained with Haidenhain*s Iron-haematoxylin* The sections 
were studied with a 90 IT* A* 1*25 Zeiss apochromatic 
objective and numbers 6X, 1QX* 15X and 20X compensating 
oculars , The drawings were made with the aid of a camera 
lucida using the above mentioned objective and a number 
15X compensating ocular* The microscope was raised 6 inches 
above the table level for all drawings* For photographs the 
original drawings were enlarged to twice their size and these 
enlargements reduced one-half on the negative from which the 
prints were made* This procedure modified outline irregular¬

Chromosome counts in A rne Ian chier were not the same. 
In an attempt to find some explanation of the variation in 
number, fruiting-wood was gathered in February. This was 
placed in water in the laboratory and sprayed twice daily. 
Smear mounts were made every two days after the flowe^ buds 
had started to grow, using the usual ace to-carmine solution. 
When the buds were thought to have advanced sufficiently they 
were fixed and imbedded as described previously. Before cut¬ 
ting, it was found advantageous to soak the imbedded flower- 
bud-material in water at room temperature for several days. 
This procedure tended to soften the tissues. The flower-bud 
material was sectioned at 15u and stained as described for the 
root sections. 

Chromosome Numbers. 

In this study the somatic chromosome number has 
been determined in the following genera and species t Ribes 
ame ricanum Mill: Rubus pube sce ns Raf. ; Arne le nch ie-pj?.p. ; 

Pru.nns pennsy 1 v anic a; P. melanocarpa : and Shepherdi.a argentea . 
It is hoped that the information will be of value in future 
breeding work*

Amelanchier species *- 

"fhe specimens given particular study were from col¬ 
lections 1-20-5, 1-20-7 and 1-10-2. In all cases the cyto¬ 
plasm was very dense, and for microscopic examination in¬ 
tense light was required* The somatic chromosome numbers 
for these plants were 26, 33 and 64 respectively* The 
count of the last collection is an estimated number* The 
figures in material 1-10-5 were the only ones with any 
morphological distinction, one pair of chromosomes having 
satellites. 

All the plants mentioned had been gathered as A. 
alnifolia * Plants 1-20-5 and 1-20-7 came from the same 
location and had been growing under similar wild conditions. 
Specimen 1-10-2 was outstanding, having been selected by 
Mr*A. Griffin and cultivated for a number of years at 
Brooks, Alberta. This latter plant has large deep purple 
fruits, borne on uprigjit racemes* The fruit ripens about 
two weeks before that of other Arnelanchier collections* 

The plants have not attained sufficient size to be compared 
under cultivation* Flower buds have not been produced 
hence pol3.en-mother-cell material was not obtained from 
these plants* 

Root-tip material from other collections was 
studied, notably that of the white saskatoon. It was felt 
that there was not sxifficient material to make any state¬ 
ment as to the number of chromosomes*

number. One chromosome was peculiar in that it was long 
and frequently folded back on itself. This made it diffi¬ 
cult to decide whether there were one or two chromosomes. 

Individual plants of these two species, when culti¬ 
vated, seldom set fruit. In order to determine their 
fertility, racemes of both on several trees were enclosed 
in transparent envelopes similar to those used for cereal 
crossing. The branches were shaken every day until such 
time as the flowers wilted. Only one fruit set, and that 
on Prunus me lanocarpa . This one fruit did not reach maturity 
but withered and died while still on the tree.

Summary 


In the seven species studied, the somatic chromo¬ 
some numbers were found to be as follows: 


Ribes americanum Mill. 

_ 

16 

Rubus pubescens Raf. 

- 

16 

Amelanchier species. 


26 


- 

33 


- 

64 aporox 

Prunus pennsy1vanica L. 

- 

16 

Primus melanocarpa (A. 



NeIs) Rydb. 

- 

32 

Shepherdia argentea Nutt 

- 

26 


Evidence indicated that Primus penrsylvanica and 
Primus melanocarpa materials studied are either self- 
sterile or nearly so. 

An explanation of the results with Amelanchier 
may be that the five species mentioned in the literature 
have a wider range of distribution than previously realized 
and that natural hybridization has taken place.

GENERAL SUMMARY. 


Each of the three parts of this study has been 
summarized at the end of its respective section* Certain 
features which appear to be outstanding are mentioned 
here* For every problem that has been investigated many 
related ones have been suggested which impresses the writer 
with a realization of the opportunities for research in 
this field* 

i 

The study has shown that wild fru.its with desir¬ 
able characteristics are available in the prairie provinces* 
The collections made during the progress of the problem 
represent outstanding plants* Use of the selections in 
hybridization work should mark a forward step in hardy 
fruit development® 

Propagation of these native fruits from seed has 
been shown to be practical* This is a prime fundamental 
in a fruit improvement project® 

Chromosome numbers for certain species have been 
determined® An unexpected problem has arisen in Amelanchier * 
It seems possible that the five wild species represented 
have a wider range of distribution than previously realized 
and that natural hybridization has taken place®
