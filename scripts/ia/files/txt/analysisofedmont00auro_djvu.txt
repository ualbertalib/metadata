SYNOPSIS 


Though many standardized mathematics tests are available for 
use in the classroom, few are keyed to the newer conceptions of 
mathematics. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate an 
achievement test in mathematics purporting to measure comprehension 
of fundamental relationships in mathematics at the Grade IX level. 
Three hundred Grade IX pupils were administered the two forms of 
the test and an analysis made of the results. 

The test was first analyzed to determine the degree to which 
it met the criteria of reliability and validity required of a 
standardized test. Two measures of reliability were found by the 
methods of parallel forms and rational equivalence, while three 
measures of validity were determined by correlating the test scores 
against external criteria by the product-moment technique. The same 
technique was used to determine the reliability of each subtest and 
the intercorrelations of the four subtests. An item analysis of the 
test was also made using the Davis Item Analysis Chart, and finally 
the forms were studied for comparability. 

Though reliability and validity measures were lowered by the 
restricted sample used in this study, the test appeared, sufficiently 
reliable and valid for use in classroom guidance in mathematics. 

The need for revision and for rearrangement of the order of the items 
in the test were strongly indicated by item analysis. Form B of the 
test seemed a less valid instrument for measuring achievement in 


mathematics than Form A,

CHAPTER I 

AIT APPROACH TO THE TESTING OP MATHEMATICS 

HISTORICAL BACKGRCTOD 

Not until the eighteenth century did arithmetic appear as a 
subject on the crarriculun of American schools. Conceived as an 
essential tool in business, the utilitarian aspects of arithmetic 
were stressed by teachers until 1800. With the publication in 1821 
of Colburn*s 9 First Lessons 9 , ^the purpose of instruction in arithmetic 
changed. Reflecting the doctrine of mental faculties prevalent in the 
philosophy of the era, mathematics, through the inductive approach, 
became a recognized means of disciplining and developing the mind. 
Colburn and those who followed him in the nineteenth century made 
little change in the content of arithmetic; their chief contributions 
were in the field of instructional procedures. 

By the beginning of the twentieth century educators turned from 
considerations of method to discussions of content of arithmetic 
courses in terms of purpose to be achieved. In 193^» the Ninth 
Yearbook of the National Council of the Teachers of Mathematics stated, 
51 Broadly considered, the aims of most teachers of mathematics may be 
summarized under three main headings: utilitarian, disciplinarian and 
cultural. Functional mathematics affords (us) an ideal medium through 
which these aims may be realised. 15 The Yearbook emphasized that 
w the recognition, interpretation and utilization of relationships are 
the heart and soul of functional thinking.

Clarification of the objectives of instruction in mathematics 
has been accompanied by a parallel movement in the direction of 
consideration of the degree to which these goals have been achieved. 

The written examination did not become an established practice in the 
United States until after 1850. The refinement of instruments and 
techniques of evaluation had its beginnings in the work of Horace 
Mann. The development of these instruments was given impetus by the 
scientific work in measurement of Wundt, Be Moivre, Bessel, Quetelet, 
Darwin, Galton and Pearson. In 1908 Stone published the first standardized 
achievement test? it was a test of achievement in elementary arithmetic. 

MEASUBIIMiET 

The most common function of achievement tests is the appraising 
of learning in a single subject area. An achievement test is standardized 
when, M the test procedure and content have been so fixed that subjects 
at different places and times may be compared.The tests usually have 
norms which permit the interpretation of results. 

Standardised tests are of three types, survey, prognostic and 
diagnostic. The survey and prognostic tests are both general tests whose 
purpose is to determine all-over competency in mathematics. While both 
stress the test score as a measure of present achievement, the prognostic 
test has the additional function of predicting future success. The 
diagnostic test, unlike the other measures, is designed to identify 
particular strengths and weaknesses of the individual child, and, within 
reasonable limits, to reveal the underlying causes, diagnostic tests 
focus on the process by which the subject responds, rather than the 
product. 15 ^ Since the tests emphasise M intra~individual comparison w

"rather than comparison with others",^ they are rarely standardized. 


mmmssEs nr ted testing program 

Testing programs today have become a routine part of most 
educational systems. Yet the measuring instruments have tended to 
evaluate mechanical proficiency in subject matter through more or less 
stereotyped answers to factual items, rather than measurement of under¬ 
standing of concepts, techniques and principles through thoughtful 
answers to functional questions. Crohb&ck feels that few standardised 
tests have employed tests of ability to apply principles, to reason, or 
to interpret materials. He cites the work of the Progressive Educational 
Association in the fields of science and social studies as examples of 
this type of testing.*^ Reiterating Gronback, and many others in the field, 
Monroe feels? 

The greatest need in the achievement-testing field is for the 
development of types of test exercises more consonant with evolving 
educational objectives. The statistical techniques for determining 
validity and reliability, for item analysis, and for expressing scores 
in meaningful ways have outrun the quality of the tests. The construction 
of items, which measure and encourage socially valid, highly functional, 
generalised and permanent learning and which stimulate achievement to 
capacity, is greatly needed in every field of achievement. To build such 
items requires rare insight into the meanings of education and the function 
of each subject area in modified human behaviour in desirable directions. 
When such tests are available teachers and students alike will work 
toward clarified goals with greater efficiency.

CHAPTER II 

THE PROBLEM 

CONTENT OF CURRENT ACHIEVEMENT TESTS IN MATHEMATICS 
Current achievement tests measure mathematical proficiency In 
the area of general mathematics or in the specific fields of 
arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry or calculus. Achievement 
on these tests is usually expressed In the form of a total score, or 
a total score together with a group of subtest scores for each area 
tested. Examples may he cited? the Foust-Schorling Test of Functional 
Thinking in Mathematics gives a single test score of achievement in 
functional thinking; the Cooperative Mathematics Tests for Grades 7, 8 and 
9 yield separate scores for the following areas; Part I, Skills; 

Part II, Pacts, Terms and Concepts; Part III, Application; Part IV, 
Appreciation; the Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Skills has three 
subscores; Part I, “Vocabulary and Functional Knowledge; Part II, Funda¬ 
mental Operations, Section A; Whole numbers and Fractions, Section B; 
Percentage, Decimals and Denominate numbers; Part III, Problems, 

CRITICISM OF CTJRREHT TESTS in MATHEMATICS 
In recent years, the content of current achievement tests has been 
severely criticized. The inherent weakness in their content is indicated 
by the reviews in the Third Mental Measurements Yearbook, edited by 
Euros, Some of the criticisms of experts in this field may show the 
present trend of opinion concerning tests of mathematical knowledge. 

15 The test is strong in measurement of skills and processes but weak in 
measurement of concepts, functional thinking and generalizations.

w ...the items are of a very routine variety. n With increasing 
diversity of first year mathematics courses, the primary objective 
of this test becomes increasingly futile* Whether mathematical 
achievement is adequately measured in terms of recognition and one-step 
computation is also open to debate*® H w This judgment may, however, 
reflect the reviewer^ belief that evaluation in arithmetic has for too 
long been narrowly conceived and that any competent attempt to broaden 
the base of evaluation is welcome* w ^ Perhaps a comment by Brueckner 
epitomizes what is generally felt to be the problem. 

Although elaborate statistical devices were employed in the 
preparation of the test, that alone does not guarantee usefulness. 

That depends upon the way in which the tests fit the demands of 
arithmetic in the present day schools. What is basic in the 
teaching of arithmetic in the schools, today, therefore, should be 
measured in such a way that teachers can make a direct application 
of test findings to their teaching* 13 

It is evident that few tests fulfill the objectives of mathematics. 
There is a great need for better instruments for testing mathematical 
achievement.

The Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics, constructed by 
the writer while teaching on the Edmonton Separate School Staff, was 
planned with the aim of avoiding some of the faults of existing tests. 
By choice of area and type of item it was hoped to avoid the evaluation 
of learned processes of textbook mathematics and to reduce the emphasis 
on manipulation and the mechanical aspects of the subject. The test is 
at the Grade IX level and has two forms. Each form has four component 
scores. Computation, Denominate Dumber, Algebra and Geometry.

THE PROBLEM 

Many claims may Be made for a test of achievement, But these 
claims must Be suBstantiated through statistical analysis. The 
objective of this study is to ascertain the degree to which Porms A 
and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics for Grade IX 
meet the technical criteria of good tests. This will Be done By: 

a. determining the reliability of the test, 

B. determining the validity of the test, 

c. making an item-analysis of the test, 

d. determining the reliability of each subtest, 

e. determining the intercorrelations of the subtests, 

f. comparing the forms of the test for equivalence.

CHAPTER III 

THE EDM0ET01T TEST OP EQUIVALENCE IE MATHEMATICS 

Since the major objective of this study is an analysis of the 
Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics, a detailed description 
of the test is provided In this chapter. The Edmonton Test of 
Equivalence is a test of seventy Items designed for the Grade IX 
level of achievement in mathematics. It has two forms, each having 
thirty-five multiple-choice items comprising Part I of the test and 
thirty-five completion type items comprising Part II of the test. 

Parts I and II have time limits of twenty and twenty-five minutes 
respectively* Copies of Forms A and B are found in Appendix A. 

As the Grade IX mathematics course is divided into three 
sections, arithmetic, algebra and geometry, items were devised in each 
of the three areas. The items could not be distributed evenly as the 
arithmetic is the culmination of eight years of work in that field, 
while the algebra is a first-year course and the geometry very 
elementary in content. Following the emphasis of the Grade IX test, 
the arithmetic items were subdivided into two separate scores, 
computation and denominate number. While items cannot be isolated as 
belonging purely In any one of these fields, they were classified as 
being predominantly in the field of computation, denominate number, 
algebra or geometry. The distribution of the items in the four areas 
is shown in Table I and the classification of the seventy items is 
indicated by Table II. Since the items in the alternate forms were 
designed to parallel each other in content as much as possible, Forms 
A and B have the same distribution and classification of items.

a serious problem, for Part I had two subtest scores and Part II 
had four subscores. Consequently, each of these sets of subtest 
items had to be arranged according to its own continuum of difficulty® 

As an achievement test in mathematics, the purpose of the 
Edmonton Test of Equivalence was to measure knowledge of the flexibility 
of mathematical relationships. It was hoped that the test would be 
consistent with the objectives of the mathematics course and so in 
content fulfill an essential requirement of a good test.

CHAPTER IV 

TEE PLAIT OP APPRAISAL OP THE TEST 
The test was administered in June 1952 to the entire population 
of Grade IX students of the Edmonton Separate Schools* A copy of 
the two forms of the test and the Directions Por Administration are 
found in Appendix A* Both forms of the test were administered to the 
pupils on the same day* In an attempt to minimize practice effect, 
the pupils were arbitrarily divided into two groups* Group I was 
given Porrn A in the morning and Perm B in the afternoon, while 
Group II was administered B in the morning and A in the afternoon* 

To insure uniformity in scoring, all tests were checked, scored and 
recorded by a group of students under the supervision of the writer. 

The results obtained provided the data for the analysis of the test* 

RELIABILITY AID VALIDITY 

Every worthwhile standardized test must possess reliability and 
validity. The extent to which repeated measurements give consistent 
results for an individual is termed a measure of the reliability of 
the test. To avoid testing computational skill, the Test of Equivalence 
had to be administered as a speed test* The various procedures for 
estimating reliability are inappropriate for such tests since the amount 
accomplished within the time limit is the measure of achievement. Two 
independently timed estimates of the score that could be obtained within 
the limited period of time are necessary. Single administrations could 
give two such estimates by means of a technique such as the split-half but 
these measures are not strictly applicable to timed tests, therefore.

11 


reliability estimates of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence must be 
based on the repeated administration of each form or the administration 
of equivalent forms. ^ Garrett, however, suggests that a simple 
approximation of the formula of rational equivalence could be used to 
give a quick estimate of reliability of tests. This measure, Garrett 
states, always underestimates reliability as compared with the split- 
half technique and the Spearman-Brown formula, but it provides a 
minimum estimate of reliability.^5 

The degree to which it is known that a test measures what it is 
designed to measure is an index of the validity of the test. ^ 

Empirical validation necessitates comparing test results with a criterion 
known to measure some characteristic closely related to the content of 
the test. Finding satisfactory criterion measures is a great obstacle 
to accurate evaluation of the validity of tests.37 Test constructors 
have had to be satisfied with criteria *each of which has some degree 
of adequacy less than complete, and some degree of practicality* K ^° 

In achievement test construction, the criteria usually used for valida¬ 
tion purposes are school ratings or gradings in the subject area of 
the test. Working with a group of 300 students would require that a 
number of teachers make the necessary gradings. These measures in 
themselves are inaccurate but in this case the added problem of 
variation of gradings among teachers would also be present. To avoid 
these difficulties, it was felt that standard gradings from the 
Department of Education would give much more satisfactory results for 
testing the validity of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence.

ITEM ANALYSIS 

The care with which the items of a test have "been chosen 
increases the validity of the instrument. Two statistical aspects 
of item analysis are the difficulty level and the discriminating 
power of the items. Expressed as a percentage, the proportion of the 
group solving an item correctly gives a measure of item difficulty. 

The percentage order of difficulty can he scaled in terms of standard 

deviation, if the assumption of normal distribution of the trait is 
19 

made. Davis, using the percentage of success of the highest and 

lowest 27 $ of the sample, corrected for chance, has devised an 

Item Analysis Chart for determining the difficulty indices of items .^ 

The power of an item to discriminate high-scoring individuals is 
termed the discrimination index of the item. This power of discrimination 
may he in terms of total score or for ease of computation against 
dichotomized groups. 

The item analysis of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence was done 
hy the Davis Technique. 


SUBTEST SCOEES 

A test made up of a series of suhtests gives rise to the 

question of the possible diagnostic value of these suhscores. 

Intercorrelation of suhtests may indicate that they possess a common 

element or that they have little in common and measure different 
21 

abilities. To yield a meaningful total score the suhtests usually 
have a great deal in common hut this common factor interferes with 
diagnostic value. In addition to what the suhtests measure.

the consistency with which they measure this quality must also he 
determined. The reliability of the total score does not in itself 
establish the reliability of the subtests. The subtests must be 
correlated, usually through equivalent forms, to establish 
independent reliability* 

By the product-moment method the reliability of each of thfe. subtests 
of the alternate forms was found. The intercorrelations of the four 
subtests of each form were also determined by the same technique. 

STATISTICAL FEOCEDOEES 

In the analysis of the 300 scores, the plan of procedure outlined 
below was followed. 

1* The reliability of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence was 
computed by two procedures? 

a. the product-moment coefficient of correlation between 
Eorms A and B, 

b. the Eroelich approximation of the Ku&er-Bichardson 
formula for the method of rational equivalence. 

2. The validity of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence was determined 
in terms of three criteria? 

a. Department of Education marks in Grade IX mathematics, 

b. Department of Education marks in the Grade IX General 
Test, 

c. Department of Education total score on the Grade IX 


final examinations in all subjects,

3. An item analysis of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence was made 
hy the Davis technique. 

On the "basis of the percentage of success (corrected for 
chance) of the highest and lowest 27 $ of the ^00 test scores for each 
form, the discrimination and difficulty indices were determined for 
each item. 

4. An analysis of the subtests of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence 
was made. 

a. The reliability of each subtest was determined, by 
correlating Form A and Form B subtest scores by the product-moment 
method. 

b. To measure the degree of uniqueness of each scale the 
intercorrelations of the subtests were found by the product-moment 
coefficient of correlation. 

5. The practice effect of takisig the alternate form of the Edmonton 
Test of Equivalence was measured bys 

a. testing the reliability of the differences between the 
means and between the standard deviations of Groups I and II to determine

CHAPTER V 

THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OP TEE EDMONTON TEST OP EQUIVALENCE 

RELIABILITY 

The reliability of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics 
was determined, by two of the accepted measures of reliability. By means 
of the product-moment coefficient of correlation, Porm A and Porm B were 
correlated. As a second estimate of reliability the Proelich adaptation 
of the Richardso n-Xuder formula of rational equivalence was applied. 

The distributions of the corresponding test scores for the 300 
students on Porms A and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence are shown 
in Table III.

Figure I in Appendix 3 is the scattergram of the distributionsof 
the scores for Forms A and B. The computation of the product-moment 
coefficient of correlation gave a result of r z 0.84. Since the 
distributionsof scores on the two forms as shown in Table III indicate 
that Form B has a bimodal distribution, interpretation of the result of 
correlation from the product-moment formula must be cautiously done. 
Correlations based on alternate forms necessitate the pairing of scores 
on the two forms, and bimodality of one of the forms suggests a lack of 
association between the pairs which might result in lowering the 
coefficient of correlation. 

Since the study is restricted in its use of reliability techniques 
by the element of speed necessary in the administration of the tests, 
Froelich*s adaptation of the Bichardson-Kuder formula for measuring 
reliability by the method of rational equivalence, was used to give an 
estimate of the degree of reliability of each test. The formula devised 
by Froelich is: 


**11 


n - M(n-M) 
^ (n-1) 


( 22 ) 


where 

r^ j ~ reliability of the whole test; 
n r number of items in the test; 
(kj » S.D. of the test scores; 

M s the mean of the test scores.

The formula yielded a reliability coefficient of r z 0.86 for 
Form A and r Z 0.87 for Form B. 

Comparing the results of the two independent measures of 
reliability, it was noted that Eroelich®s formula gave a higher degree 
of correlation than did the product-moment method. Garrett states that 
the two measures n are not strictly comparable for determining the 
reliability of test scores*/ The method of rational equivalence provides 
'an estimate of the internal consistency of the tests rather than an 
estimate of the dependability of test scores.It would thus appear 
that the Edmonton Test of Equivalence has a higher degree of internal 
consistency than of total score reliability. 

VJLIDITT 

The administration of final examinations to Grade IX students by 
the Department of Education provided convenient data for determining 
measures of validity of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics. 
Perhaps more has been done in the way of testing validity than is 
warranted, but lack of data is usually such a drawback to statistical 
research that it was felt that full use should be made of the data 
which was at hand. The criteria used were three scores obtained from 
the Department of Education Examinations Branch; marks on the Grade IX 
mathematics final; marks on the Grade IX General Test; and total seore 
on the Grade IX finals. The criteria, in addition to availability, have 
the further advantage of being carefully controlled gradings achieved 
under the close supervision of the Department of Education. The 
unreliability of teachers® gradings was the very cause of the growth 


9 ) 


■■ ::

of the measurement movement, and by avoiding such gradings as criteria 
in this study, there should he more assurance of validity of results. 
The three criteria were chosen in the interest of teachers who would 
wish to know if the tests measure achievement in mathematics, whether 
under-achievement in mathematics can he assumed hy comparison of I.Q*s 
with mathematics marks and whether mathematics marks give an indication 
of success in the Grade IX school year. 

Table I in Appendix C shows the corresponding scores for each of 
the two forms of the test along with the scores for each of the three 
criterion measures for the 300 Grade IX students. The results of the 
computation of the product-moment coefficients of correlation are shown 
in Table IV.

The results of Table IV would indicate that the test is not 
highly valid as an instrument for measuring achievement in Grade IX 
mathematics, and still less valid in measuring achievement In the 
Grade IX departmental examinations. The low coefficient of correla¬ 
tion between the General Test (Henmon-lTelson Intelligence Test, Level 7-9» 
Form C) and the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics would 
indicate that this measure of mathematical equivalence and measures of 
intelligence do not have too great a relationship. Yet interpretation 
of results is subject to precaution, for Cronback states, H In 
interpreting any correlation coefficient, the range of the group studied 
must be considered. The correlation is smaller in a selected group than 
in a group containing a wider range of ability.* 2 ^ It must b© noted 
that this study used a sample restricted in grade level to Grade IX 
students and those being drawn only from the Edmonton Separate School 
system.

CHAPTER VI 

ITEM ANALYSIS OF THE EDMONTON TEST OF EQUIVALENCE IN MATHEMATICS 

In recent years many tec3miqn.es of item analysis have “been 
devised* Of these perliaps the most satisfactory is the one advanced 
by Davis wliich will he used in this study. The practical advantage 
of using item analysis has been widely recognized as a means of 
determining the difficulty level and the discriminating power of 
items. Designed for maximum convenience in test construction, the 
Davis chart yields both a difficulty index and a discrimination index 
at the same reading. 

The difficulty index, which is tiie bottom value in each cell 
in the chart, provides a numerical Indication of the difficulty level 
of each individual item relative to other items administered to the 
same sample of testees. The discrimination index, which is the top 
value in each cell in tlie chart, provides a numerical indication of 
the amount of discriminating ability of each individual item with 
respect to a designated criterion variable, often the total score on 
the test in which the item is included 9 25 

THE DAVIS DIFFICULTY AND DISCRIMINATION INDICES 
n The difficulty of an item may be defined as the proportion of 
a certain sample of testees that marks the item correctly, or It may 
be defined as the proportion of a certain sample of testees that 
actually knows the answer to an item. lUi ° Sine© a certain proportion 
of the testees may mark the correct answer by chance, a correction 
may be employed. Though some feel that such devices over-correct 
for chance, Davis feels that such correction should be made. The 
formula Davis suggests be used is* 






:) ' >■■ 












- 22 - 


•R ¥ 

p * R ~ ir=nr 

IT - HR 


(27) 


where: 


R " the number of testees that answer the item correctly, 

¥ “ the number of testees that answer the item incorrectly, 

K s the number of choices in the item, 

ST z the number of testees in the sample, 

HR = the number of testees in the sample that do not reach 

the item in the time limit• 


To calculate the difficulty of an item on a test from the responses 
of the entire sample involves extremely laborious computation. Kelly 
has shown that the difficulty level of items, based only on responses 
of the top and bottom 2?^ of the sample, reduces clerical labor almost 
by half without impairing results* Davis bases his estimate of the 
difficulty of an item on these extreme groups by averaging the percentages 
of success of these two groups, transforming this proportion of success 
into standard deviation units, multiplying each standard score by a 
constant so chosen as to mahe the largest 49 » and as a final step, adding 
50 to each score. This results in difficulty indices in the Davis Item 
Analysis Chart ranging from 1 to 99 only. 

The discrimination index of items is also based on the difficulty 
of the items for the highest and lowest 27 $ of the sample. flanagan 
prepared tables of correlation coefficients corresponding to the possible 
percentages of success in the upper and lower groups. These correlation 
coefficients are estimates of the product-moment correlation between 
item success and test score. The fact that the unit on the scale does

not have the same significance as one goes from small to large 
values, has been overcome by Davis by converting Flanagan®s correlation 
values into Fisher®s s- values and multiplying "by a constant such that 
the index "becomes 100 when 99$ of one group succeeds with the item and 
only 1$ of the other group succeeds,, 

THE COMPTJTATIOHAJ. JSOCHDORE 

After the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics had "been 
administered, the test papers were marked and the papers for each 
form arranged in order of rank with respect to total score. The 
highest and the lowest 27 $ of the papers (81 papers in each extreme 
group) for each form, were removed and tabulation made of the choice 
of answer to each item. The number leaving the item unanswered and 
those who failed to reach the item were also marked. The results of 
these tabulations are shown in Tables V, VI, VII, and VIII®

Prom the data of Tables V, VI, VII and VIII, the proportions of 
success in the highest and lowest 27$ of the sample were computed by 
means of the formulas: 


P “ 






inhere: 

Ug =the number of testees in the 
highest 27$, 

% -the number of testees in the 
highest 27$ that answer the 
item correctly, 

Wg s:the number of testees in the 
highest 27/1 that answer the 
item incorrectly, 

Mjp the number of testees in the 
highest 27/? that do not 
reach the item in the time 
limit, 

K -the number of choices in 
the item. 





( 28 ) 


L 

H 

% 


K 


r the number of testees in the 
lowest 27$» 

= the number of testees in the 
lowest 27$ that answer the item 
correctly, 

e the number of testees in the 
lowest 27$ that answer the item in- 
correctly, 

= the number of testees in the 
lowest 27$ that do not reach 
the item in the time limit, 

~ the number of choices in the 
item. 


discrimination and difficulty indices were read simultaneously by 


entering the percentages of success in the Item Analysis Chart. In many 
instances, as shown in Tables IX and X, where the two proportions used 


to enter the chart were different, there was no straightforward way of 


using the Item Analysis Chart. Davis has overcome this limitation by 
devising a table which provides corrected percentages for entering the 
chart when the percentages of success in the lowest 27$ of the sample is 
0 or negative.^ If the percentage of success in the highest 27$ is 
above 99$* "the percent used to enter the chart must first be altered by 
use of the table provided by Davis. 










29 - 


Tables IX and X provide a summary of difficulty and discrimination ; 
indices for all items of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics* 
as determined "by the Davis technique .

Since a misprint occurred in the typing of item thirty-four of Part II, 
Porm A, this item lias "been omitted in both forms. 

11TTERPRSTATIOH OP IT M MU LYSIS DATA 

Davis states that items with discrimination indices above 20 will 
ordinarily be found to have sufficient discriminating power for use in 
most achievement tests.31 Since it is generally accepted that an item 
should fail a minimum of 15 $ and a maximum of 85$ of the sample, the 
difficulty index of items as shown in Tables IX and X should fall 
between 28 and 72. 

Tables IX and X would indicate that six items of Porm A and 
fourteen items of Porm B have indices of discrimination lower than 20. 
These items lack sufficient discriminating power to be included in a 
test of achievement. However, four of the items of Porm A and two of 
Porm B have indices of 19 and so might be acceptable items. Two of the 
items of Porm B, numbers one and thirty of Part II, have absolutely no 
power of discriminating high and low-scoring students. 

Tables IX and X also show that the difficulty indices of six 
Porm A items and seven Porm B items fall below 28, three of these being 
above 25 in Porm A and one in Porm B. Pour items of Porm A and two of 
Porm B, have indices greater than ?2. Since easy items may be included 
as lead-on questions they can be used to advantage on the tests. 
However, the placement of these items must be at the beginning of 
Part I or Part II of either form. One item, number seven of Part I, 
^orm A does not satisfy this condition. It should be item three of 


Part I, Porm A*

The item-analysis of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence has revealed 
one very serious defect of the test. While the greater part of the items 
fall within the required range of difficulty, the items are not placed 
in increasing order of difficulty in Forms A or B. That it is essential 
to rearrange the items of the tests is strongly indicated by item 
analysis results. 

THE EFFECT OF THE SPEED ELMIBT 01T THE ITEM AIIALYSIS DATA 
In administering a speed test such as the Edmonton Test of 
Equivalence in Mathematics, there will necessarily he a group of 
students who, for lack of time, did not reach the items near the end of 
the test. Davis makes the assumption that these individuals, if granted 
additional time in which to finish, would have distributed their 
answers as did the individuals who did answer the items in the time 
limit. Davis feels this to be a practical assumption even though he 
feels that empirical validity checks would not bear out this conclusion. 
As a result of this assumption, he uses as the numerator for determining 
difficulty of an item; 

3T - BR 

(32) 

where; 

H “ the number of testees in the sample, 

HR Z the number of testees in the sample that do not reach 
the item in the time limit. 

If the test is speeded, succeeding items toward the end will have 
been read by a steadily decreasing number of subjects, resulting in the 
number of testees used to compute the proportion required to enter the

item analysis chart becoming steadily smaller. As a result, the 
reliability of the item analysis data for succeeding items decreases, 
sometimes to the point where the data are no longer worth computing. 
Davis feels that the progressive reduction in the number of cases on 
which the proportion required to enter the item analysis is calculated 
will not seriously bias the difficulty and discrimination indices if 
correction for chance formulas are used. 

There is, however, a factor that does operate especially 
to bias discrimination indices computed for items which a la,rge 
proportion of the high-scoring and low-scoring groups have not reached 
in the time limit. It is the usual tendency of some testees in the 
low-scoring group to rush through the test, marking almost at random 
in an effort to try every item within the time limit. Members of the 
high-scoring group ordinarily do this to a far smaller extent, so the 
items near the end of a highly speeded test tend to have spuriously 
high discrimination indices.... ........33 

As the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in Mathematics was not a 
highly speeded test, perhaps the results of the item analysis were 
not seriously affected. However, the correction for chance was 
used. It should be noted, that some of the low-scoring group computed 
each item and so did not complete the test. The formula for correction 
for chance, excluding this group, assumes that they would have performed 
as the higher group did. The items toward the end of the test 
therefore have spuriously low discrimination indices even when obtained 
by the correction for chance which Davis advocates.

CHAPTER VII 

TEE SUBTESTS OP THE EDMONTON TEST OE EQUIVALENCE IN MATHEMATICS 

As was previously stated in Chapter IV, reliability measures 
for the total score of a test do not insure the reliability of the 
subtests. Each subtest is a test in itself and must demonstrate 
adequate reliability. By means of the product-moment coefficient 
of correlation, Eorms A and B of the Computation, Denominate Humber, 
Algebra and Geometry subtests were correlated. The data used to 
construct the seattergrams of the paired scores on the four subtests 
for Forms A and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence is found in 
Table 2 of Appendix C. Table XI shows the results of the calculations 
of the product-moment coefficients of correlation.

While none of the scales indicates a high degree of reliability,

and the Denominate Number the least reliable. Since few diagnostic

the interpretation of these reliability measures is made difficult. 

The data of Table XII taken from Cronback provides a means of comparing 
results of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence subtest reliabilities with those of 
the Wechsler-Bellevue Adult Intelligence subtests.

The reliability of a subtest, however, indicates only that the 
test is consistent. T© use subtests for diagnostic purposes, each 
subtest must possess some degree of uniqueness. To ascertain the 
relationship between the four subtests of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence 
in Mathematics, the scores of the four subtests were intercorrelated by 
the product-moment coefficient of correlation. The data for constructing 
the scattergrams of the paired scores on the ibrms for each subtest is 
found in Table 2 of Appendix C. Table XIII shows the intercorrelations 
between the subtests for Norms A and B«

The results would indicate highest correlation between the 
computation subtest and the algebra and geometry scales. The cor¬ 
relations between the geometry scales and both the denominate number 
and algebra scales are also fairly high. It would seem, then, that 
there is fairly high correlation between the geometry scale and all 
three of the other subtests. The lowest correlations are those of the 
denominate number scale with the computation and algebra subtests. 

While the reliabilities of the subtests would not indicate that 
they can be used to make predictions about individual students, they 
would appear to be reliable enough to use in evaluation and diagnosis 
of class performance. Since the intercorrelations of the subtests 
would also suggest that each scale, though testing some overlapping 
abilities, is contributing something new to the total score, the 
subtests should be useful to teachers In devising group remedial

work. The moderate intercorrelations of the subtests might also 
suggest that total scores might not he too meaningful. The 
reliability measures for Forms A and B might substantiate this 
claim, for internal consistency results were 0.86 and 0.87 
respectively, while the total score reliability dropped to 0.84.

CHAPTER VIII 

THE PRACTICE EFFECT OF TAKING THE ALTERNATE FORM OF THE EDMONTON 
TEST OF EQUIVALENCE IN MATHEMATICS 

MEASURING PRACTICE EFFECT 

In administering the Edmonton Test of Equivalence to the students 
of the Edmonton Separate Schools, the total population of 300 Grade IX 
pupils was divided “by classrooms into two groups. Group I, composed of 
149 pupils, was given Form A in the morning and Form B in the afternoon, 
while the 151 pupils of Group II were given Form B in the morning and 
Form A in the afternoon. 

Group I achieved a mean score of 34.20 on Form A and 36.55 on 
Form B. The mean difference of 2.35 was highly significant and could 
indicate that the mean of Form B was raised through practice effect or 
that Form B was an easier test than Form A. The mean for Group II on 
Form B was 27.40 and on Form A 31*35* Here, too, the mean difference 
of 3*95 was highly significant, the difference again “being due either 
to practice effect or to the fact that Form A was an easier test than 
Form B» Since Doth groups scored significant mean gains on the second 
form of the test taken, it may he concluded that practice effect resulted 
in the gains of 2.35 and 3*95» and since the samples are roughly even may 
give an average practice effect of 3 * 15 * 

THE GROUPING OF THE SAMPLE TO STUDY PRACTICE EFFECT 

The purpose of dividing the Grade IX population into two groups had 
been to equalize practice effect on both forms so that results of reliability, 
validity and item analysis techniques would be comparable for both forms of 
the test. However, on examination of the Wo groups certain comparisons

The results of Table XIV would clearly indicate that though the 
two groups have the same average intelligence. Group I has greater 
variability of intelligence and at the same time is a better group 
of mathematics students than Group II. 

In order to check whether this biased division of the groups would 
seriously contaminate results to a point which would render them invalid, 
Groups I and II were matched by pairing students according to their 
score on the Grade IX mathematics final. Pairing was done by allowing 
as great a difference as five points between the two scores. The groups 
were necessarily decreased in number, each of the new groups consisting 
of 120 students. The data of Table XV would indicate that the two were 
adequately matched in terms of mathematical ability.

CHAPTER IX 

THE COMPARABILITY OP THE POEMS 

Educators have stressed the need for comparable forms of tests 
as a means of measuring the effect of teaching. Rather than repeat 
the same test, it is desirable to use equivalent forms of the same 
test in order to rule out the effect of memory. Equivalent forms 
are also used to confirm or correct test scores which might possibly 
be inaccurate owing to emotional disturbance of the pupil or other 
unfavorable conditions.3^ 

Two or more forms of an educational test are considered to be 
equal or equated when practically identical scores on each are made 
by the same individuals or by individuals of the same ability. This 
means that the forms of the test must be made up of test items which 
parallel one another closely in difficulty.35 

In devising the Edmonton Test of Equivalence, the procedure used 
to achieve equivalence of forms was the construction of parallel items. 
The items in the two forms were designed to parallel each other as 
much as possible as to content and difficulty. 15 An exact equivalence 
of difficulty is not demanded of each pair of items, as a slight 
difference in difficulty for the two items of one pair may be 
compensated by an opposite and equivalent difference in difficulty 
for items of another pair. 9 36 

In comparing Forms A and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence 
in Mathematics, the following procedure was adopted. 

1. The differences between the means and standard deviations 
of the distributions of the forms were tested for significance.

2. Comparisons of the item difficulty and discriminating 
power of the items of the two forms were ma.de. 

3. The bimodality of Form B was studied. 

COMPARISONS OF THE MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS 
A common method of describing distributions uses the mean 
and standard deviation as the measures of comparison. The mean is 
the arithmetic average obtained by adding all scores and dividing 
"by the number of scores. The standard deviation is a measure of 
the spread of scores.The distributions of scores on Forms A and 
B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence are shown in Table III of 
Chapter V. The mean and standard deviation for Form A were 32*78 
and 10.75 and for Form B 31*95 and 10*95* The calculations of the 
reliability of the differences between the correlated means and 
standard deviations are shown in Table XVII.

practice effect had been equalized by alternating the form which 
the group took first, the difference in mean score was probably due 
to some factor in the tests themselves. Form A is probably an easier 
test than Form B. The results of Table XIX, however, do not indicate 
that there is reason for believing a real difference in variability 
of test scores exists between the two forms. 

COMPARISON OF THE ITEMS OF THE TWO FORMS 
To achieve close equality of item difficulty in the alternate 
forms of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence, the procedure followed 
was the preparation of parallel items. From Tables IX and X in 
Chapter VI, it is obvious that very few of the items are of parallel 
difficulty. However, when the items are arranged in increasing order 
of difficulty as shown in Table XVIII for both forms, the items are 
much more comparable.

The last six items of Form B would seem to "be much more difficult 
than the paired items in Form A, while the first item in Form B 
is much simpler than the item in Form A. These items might result 
in makiag Form B a harder test than Form A* 

From Tables IX and X in Chapter VI, it is also evident that 
if, as stated in Chapter VI, discrimination indices of 20 are 
desirable for items of achievement tests. Form A has six items 
whose indices fall below 20, their indices being 19, 19, 19, 19, 17 
and 12, while Form B has fourteen items whose indices fall below 20, 
their indices being 19, 19, 17, 16 , 16 , 15, 14, 14, 14, 12, 11, 8, 

0, and 0. The items of Form B would seem to be less valid than 
those of Form A and as a result less reliable. The validity 
coefficients of Table IV in Chapter V would bear out this finding 
concerning validity of Form B. The results of Chapter VI would not, 
on the other hand confirm that Form B is less reliable than Form A. 
That the two forms are not too highly consistent is substantiated 
by the product-moment coefficient of correlation found to be 0.84. 
However, the method of rational equivalence would indicate that Form B 
is more reliable than Form A. It must be stressed, of course, that 
the bimodal distribution of scores for Form B makes correlation 
results dubious. 

While the items of Form B seem to be more difficult than those 
of Form A, neither form has a normal distribution of difficulty 
of items* The chi-square test of TableXIX indicates that the

distributions of item difficulty axe significantly different 


from what would he a normal distribution of difficulty in items 


of a test in which items fail at most 85 $ of the sample and at 
least 15 $.

In 'both Forms A and B it would appear that the tests have too many 
hard items and an insufficient number of easy items* Testing the 
distribution of Form A for skewness, by use of the formula: 

%■ - p 50 

2 

(38) 

(a measure of skewness in terms of percentiles) 
a result of 1.03 was obtained. This indicates that the distribution 
was positively skewed but when tested for significance, the standard 
error of the measure of skewness was 0.81 which yielded a critical 
ratio of 1.27 which is not highly significant. The lack of a 
sufficient number of easy items in Form A has not, therefore, 
resulted in extreme grouping of scores at one end of the scale. 

To discuss skewness of the distribution of Form B scores would be 
to conceal the bimodality of the results. 

THE BIMOEALITY OF IDEM B 

The rarity in nature of the occurrence of bimodal distributions 
might well give rise to speculation concerning the cause of the 
bimodality of Form B scores. Since bimodality was not evident in 
Form A, defective items in Form B could cause deviation from normalcy. 
From the discussion of item analysis in Chapter VI, it is evident that 
Form B has more items that do not discriminate high and low-scoring

students than has Form A. This might tend to he a contributing 
factor to the biraodality of Form B. 

The dividing of the Grade IX students into Groups I and II, 
where Group I had greater variability of intelligence and was a 
better group of mathematics students than Group II might si so 
have caused the bimodality, Walker states that artificial bimodality 
can be achieved by such grouping.^ However, when the two groups were 
matched for mathematical ability the same bimodality occurred 
suggesting that the grouping in itself was not the cause of the 
bimodality of scores on Form B. 

The deviation from normalcy of the Form B results could also 
have been the result of failure on the part of some teachers to comply 
with the Directions For Administration which were issued with the 
test. Only by re-administration could this be checked. 

In achievement tests, a serious cause of variation of test results 
may be attributed to the standards of instruction which exist in the 
schools. If a portion of the students had been very well trained 
while another portion were poorly trained, both forms of the test 
should have been equally affected, except as variation in items existed. 
Since the lack of equivalence is evident in the items of the two forms, 
bimodality of scores might have occurred if a group of the students 
had been thoroughly taught the relationships involved in certain 
items of Form B, while other groups had not.

n A statistical study can only describe what is; it cannot 
determine what ought to he except in so far as it may throw light 
upon the probable concomitants and consequences of certain situations* 
This is particularly true in this problem of bimodality of scores. 
Only if extreme care were taken to control the variable factors 
could the cause of the bimodality of Form B be determined. 





CHAPTER X 


CONCLUSIONS 

1. The reliability of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence in 
Mathematics as determined by the product-moment coefficient of 
correlation between Forms A and B of the test for 300 Grade IX 
students of the Edmonton Separate Schools was 0.84* The method 
of rational equivalence yielded a correlation of 0.86 for Form A 
and 0*8? for Form B. Since correlations higher than 0.90 are 
usually demanded cf tests to be used for individual diagnosis, the 
tests are not sufficiently reliable for this purpose. However, 
tests analyzed from data obtained from a restricted, preselected 
group, as in this study, tend to have lower coefficients of 
reliability than if administered to a wider range of students. More 
conclusive measures of reliability would have been obtained if the 
tests had been administered to Grades ¥11 to IX or IX to XI. The 
Edmonton Test then would have proven to be sufficiently reliable for 
individual prediction. 

2. Three validity coefficients were obtained for each of the forms 
of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence. 

a. Validity coefficients of 0.?? and 0.76 were obtained by 
correlating the scores of 3^0 Grade IX students on Form A and Form B 
of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence and the Departmental Grade IX 
mathematics final. While an r of less than 0.80 is generally 
considered low, validity coefficients of tests rarely rise above

- 52 - 


0.70, though this gives far from perfect predictive accuracy. 

Since the restricted range of the group has also tended to lower 
the validity coefficients, the Edmonton Test of Equivalence would 
seem to he sufficiently valid to he used to measure achievement in 
Grade IX mathematics. 

h. Porms A and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence 
correlated 0.73 and 0.67 with total score on the Grade IX finals. 

The validity of Form B is considerably lower than that of Porm A. 

Although, coefficients of 0.70 give far from perfect predictive 
efficiency, in view of the restricted sample used to obtain these 
coefficients, Porm A might he useful as an aid In measuring 
achievement in Grade IX finals. The validity of Porm B might he 
improved by revising items which fail to discriminate high and low-scoring 
students. 

c. Against the criterion of the Grade IX Genera,! Test, 

Porms A and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence yielded validity 
coefficients of 0,60 and 0.53* These coefficients would indicate 
that mathematical ability is positively but not highly related to 
intelligence In selected and homogeneous groups. Though the restricted 
range lowered the correlation measures, the results would indicate 
that 1.0. 5 s could not be used to measure achievement in Gra.de IX 
mathematics. Under or over-achievement in mathematics could not be 
assumed in relation to intelligence scores. Again it is to be noted 
that the validity of Porm B is much lower than that of Porm A. This 
would verify previous findings which indicated the need to revise Porm B.

3* The reliability of the subtests of the Edmonton Test of 
Equivalence secured by correlating JOO Grade IX scores on Forms A 
and B were: Computation, 0.71; Denominate Humber, 0.64; Algebra, 0.82; 
and G-eometry, 0.77* Since moderately low intercorrelations were also 
found be Ween the subtests of both forms, the scales would be sufficiently 
reliable and valid for the purpose of classroom guidance in mathematics. 

4. Forms A and B of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence have 
too many very difficult items and an insufficient number of easy 
items. On Form A, items 7» 17, 30, 32, 33 and 35 of Part II are too 
difficult, while on Form B, items 17, 24 and 33 of Part I and 7, 30 , 

32 and 35 of Part II were too difficult. 

5. The following items have low "discriminating power 

as shown by the Davis technique; Form A; Part I, 9; Part II, 5, 31, 

32 , 33 and 35; Form B; Part I, 1, 2, 10, 17, 19, 33, 3^5 Part II, 1, 

3 , B, 26 , 30 , 31 and 33 . 

6 . To maintain parallel-item construction in Forms A and B, 
item 10 of Part I and items 7, 3^, 31, 32, 33 and 35 should be 
eliminated from both forms, for they are defective items in both tests. 

All other items failing to meet the requirements of difficulty and 
(or) discrimination need to be revised to make them parallel to the 
corresponding item in the alternate forEi* 


c 






*•) 









- 5 * - 


7. The items of the Edmonton Test of Equivalence were 

not arranged in increasing order of difficulty. To maintain the 
parallelism of the two forms, the order of the items of the two 
forms would "be: Part I, 1, 2, 7 , 5 , 8 , 11, 3, 9, 4, 19, 14, 17, 

( 10 ), 16 , 34 , 13 , 6 , 28 , 23 , 20 , 15, 22 , 31, 12 , 25 , 35 , 18 , 2 ?, 30 , 

21, 32, 26, 24, 33 and 2°; Fart II, 1, 8 , 2, 5 , 3 , 4, 12, 6 , 13, 11, 

18 , 21 , 24, 22 , 9, (31), 10 , 16 , 19, 25 , 26 , 28 , 14, 20 , 27 , 29 , 23 , 

15, (35), (7), 17. ( 30 ), ( 32 ) and (33). 

8 . The results of the analysis of the Edmonton Test of 
Equivalence in Mathematics would clearly indicate that the strength 
of a test depends on its items, for “both reliability and validity 
are affected if the items are not first refined by item analysis, 

9. The practice effect of taking the second form of the 
Edmonton Test of Equivalence is a gain in total score of 3*3-5 
scale units, 

10, Item analysis can detect defective items by establishing 
di scriminating power and difficulty level of items, however, such 
procedures need not necessarily identify items faulty in mathematical 
content. Since the writer devised the Edmonton Test of Equivalence, 
no analysis of the mathematical content of the test has been made in 
this study. It would be advisable to have such an analysis carried out 
before the test were revised.

Directions - Part I 

Each of the questions in this section consists of 4 items placed 
in a row. One item in each row is NO T equivalent to the other three 
in the row. 

Below is an example already answered correctly. Notice how the 
question is answered.

The item which is NOT equivalent to the other three is 9 4* 5 
so 9 -f 5 is circled, ancT"9 4-5 is part B, so an X has been put in the 
B answer space. This is the way you are to answer the questions.

In taking this test, answer the questions in the order in which 
they are given. Do not linger too long over difficult questions. It 
should not be necessary to work out every item of each question to 
find the part which is not the same as the other three. Do as little
