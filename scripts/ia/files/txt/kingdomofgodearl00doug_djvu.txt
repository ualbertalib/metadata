The kingship of Christ has always been connected with the idea of 
the Kingdom of Cod. To his early followers he was known as Lord and 
Master. Jesus declared to his followers that the Kingdom of Cod had 
come, and he intimated that it was a. spiritual kingdom u not of this 
world. 11 The preaching of the Apostles was that the Kingdom of Cod had 
come in the person of Jesus Christ. 

A belief in the early termination of history was also prevelent in 
the early Church* With the passing of the years it was evident that 
the Time had not yet come when the Kingdom of Cod would supplant the 
kingdoms of the earth. There has been a great deal of discussion 

amongst scholars as to whether Jesus thought of the kingdom as present 

| 

or future. Many have agreed that Jesus thoughtonf the Kingdom in both 

senses. 

With this background in mind the present study of the early 
Christian thought concerning the kingdom has been made. The early church was 
in closer contact with the Apostolic teaching than the church of a later 
age, and it is not inconceivable that the early Christian thought concerning

the Kingdom of God might reveal further truths on this subject which was 
the central theme of the teachings of Jesus. 

Modern theology has developed from the thought and teachings of the 
primitive Church. The creeds that we have inherited from the early Church 
were developed in the midst of controversy, and represent the formulation 
of faith. The one idea that formed the basis of early Christian thought was 
that of the Kingdom of God and the Kingship of Christ. 

The present study surveys the thought of the Church from the time of 
the Apostles to the age of Augustine. In discussing the various concepts of 
the Kingdom held by these early theologians it has been necessary to consider 
their doctrines of God and their doctrines of Christ. While these doctrines 
are not considered in detail they are discussed in relationship to the idea 

of the Kingdom., It is not the purpose of this thesis to come to any conclusion 

' . > 

regarding the Kingdom of God but merely to consider the early thought on this 
topic. The thesis could well be subtitled The Growth of the Idea of the Kingdom , 
for that is what it is. 

I wish to acknowledge the valuable assistance of Prof. D.J.G.Slson in 
the preparation of this thesis. It is realized that the treatment of early 
Christian thought is far from complete, but it does represent a beginning in 
a relatively inexhaustable topic.

THE KINGDOM OP GOD AND THE SADLY CHURCH 


PART 1 


THE IDEA OS THE KINGDOM AS 


POUND IN THE SCRIPTURES OS THE CHURCH 






1 


CHAPTER I 

THE OLD TESTAMENT IDEA OF THE KINGDOM 

When the Most High gave heritages to the nations 
When he made divisions among mankind, 

He assigned the realms of the nations 
To the various deities; 

Jacob was the allotment for him to hold. 

The Lord alone was their leader. 

Song of Moses 
Deut. 32:8,9,12. 

John the Baptist proclaimed that the Kingdom of God was at 
hand.l Jesus also declared the nearness of the Kingdom of God.2 
Certainly the idea of the Kingdom of God was already familiar at the 
time of Christ; and it was this idea that became central, in the 
thought of the early Christian church. The “good news’ 1 of the 
Gospel is nothing more or less than the announcement of the Kingdom 
of God.3 Faith in the existence of this Kingdom has existed down 
through the ages to the present day, and will continue for generations 
to come until the end of Time proclaims the eternal nature of this 
realm. Men and women have died firm in the conviction that even 
death would not remove their citizenship from this invisible empire, 
but would merely transfer their abode to another domain in the Kingdom, 
The idea of the Kingdom of God finds its origin in the belief in 
a divine kingship.^ In the creation stories no limit is set to the 
absolute power of God.5 God is the creator of the universe. As the 
creator of the universe he has complete power over his creation. 
Neibuhr speaks of the power of God as being both in man and against

man in judgment and mercy.-*- This is the divine kingship as seen "by 
the prophets of the Old Testament. Yahweh was king of Israel,^ 

Ee is also king of all the earth.3 He sat in judgment over Israel 
and over the nations of the earth as their ruler. His was complete 
power and dominion, for he was their creator. Ulrich Simon speaks 
of the power of God in his absolute condemnation of the world in the 
flood story in Genesis ,/ 1 The kingship of God is demonstrated 
throughout the whole of the Old Testament through his judgments upon 
the people. Lamentations echoes the proclaimed judgments of God that 
have taken place in the words M How doeth the city sit solitary, that 
was full of people,.... ,5 5 Niebuhr speaks of the God who is "both 
powerful and good by reason of being the source of all power 15 .6 In 
having absolute goodness combined with absolute poifer you obtain a 
picture of a merciful judge who rules over all, and calls for 
repentence on the part of rebellious subjects rather than destruction. 
Here is the Kingdom of God in reality, as seen by the prophets of old 
and emphasized by the mission of Christ. 

If men will not serve the divine purposes willingly they are 
made to serve them unwillingly.? Here we see the universal dominion 
of God embracing all objects; persons and events, all the doings of 
individuals and nations, and all history. On this ba,sis the higher 
moral and spiritual kingdom is built up.^ This is the point at which 

5, the sovereignty of God is vindicated 35 , as Neibuhr puts it.9 God is 
king, and all history is his.

To man alone "belongs the possibility of entering into personal 

relations with his maker. It was man. that was created a living soul* 

Yet man turned away from God, and rejected him as king; he chose 

evil instead of good. 

so they forsook the God who made them, 

And scoffed at the Rock of their salvation;^ 

An earthly kingdom of God on this basis was not possible of 

realization, for it was against the nature of God. The land had to 

be cleansed of guilt and the people made holy if they were to belong 

to God. n Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy. 

The narrative of the creation is succeeded by that of the fall. 
Here we see a world in revolt against God. This wa,s the attempt of man 
to claim for himself the glory and honor which properly belongs to God 
alone.3 Barth describes the rebellion of man as an attempt on the 
human level to become alight unto himself. ”And so the light has become 
in us darkness, and the wrath of God is inevitable.”^ Man 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 s capacity 
for truth, beauty and goodness is thus seriously impaired, and God’s 
image in man is defaced. Calvin speaks of this rebellion of man as 
caused by pride.5 Mao. sought ”to break and transcend the. limits which 
God had set for him.”6 Protestant theology maintains that man’s 
essential nature had been destroyed by the fall*? Toynbee regards

”It is not difficult to infer in that way Adam provoked the wrath of God. 
Augustine indeed, is not far from the mark when he says, (in Psalxix.,) 
that pride was the beginning of all evil, because had not man’s ambition 
carried him higher than he was permitted, he might have continued in 

his first estate.”

the fall of man as symbolizing the acceptance of a challenge to 
abandon an achieved integration” and to venture upon a fresh 
differentiation out of which a fresh integration may - or may not - 
arise.”! Christian thought regards the fall of man as a step 
downward from original perfection. Man has become a sinner, for he 
has rebelled against Cod and marred the original image. Therefore 
if G-od is to have a moral kingdom in the world, it must be a kingdom 
brought in through grace. F 0 r this reason God revealed himself as a 
living personal God, working freely in history. Despite human 
opposition G- 0 d is going to bring his purposes to pass. A new man is 
going to be brought forth out of the old that is once again in the 
ima,ge and likeness of G-od. This is the development of the kingdom of 
G-od, and throughout the history of the Old Testament you see the 
development of the kingdom and the purposes of G-od. 

Israel was to be the people of G-od, and G- 0 d was to be their 
King. ^ They were to be an example to the nations and a light unto 
the gentiles. They were called of G-od to a divine destiny, but they 
failed to respond. However, G-od was King - of Israel, and of the 
whole world - and his purpose was not going to be thwarted, or come to 
nought. 

A new element is introduced regarding the Kingdom of G-od in 
the nature of the king. The fundamental outlines of the new form 
are laid down in the promises to David. (11 Sam 7 ) in whose house 
the kingdom is established.? Here we find that the ruler is to be

one who would be the instrument and visible representative of the 
great and invisible King. He would rule the kingdom according to 
the laws of God. This ideal was never realized, for all men were 
too deeply involved in the sin of Adam, that is the rebellion against 
God, and pride in themselves. The failure of the visible theocracy » 
only made the light of prophecy burn brighter in the hope of a 
future day and a greater personage*! 

The la.st stage in the development of the idea of the Kingdom of 
God in the Old Testament was the prophetic. Here we find the full 
consciousness that Yahweh is the God of the whole earth, and his 
purpose involves the Gentiles as we11 as the Jews. Israel is the 
servant of G 0 d. They are to become a light to the Gentiles, and a 
blessing to the whole of mankind. 2 God*s Kingdom would not perish, 
but would be from everlasting to everlasting. The theocracy \'/ould 
be restored on a grander and more spiritual basis accompanied with 
the proclamation to the nations of the rule of the living God, and 
the pouring out of the spirit on all flesh.3 

Along with the prophetic idea of the Kingdom of God you also 
find a development of the conception of the '’servant of Yahweh 11 
which arises on the basis of the calling of Israel, narrows itself 
to the spiritual portion of the people, and culminates in the great 
picture of the Suffering Servant in Isaiah. (53 2 IL3~53s 12) which the 
Christian church has traditionally associated with her Messiah. 

There are other interpretations of the Suffering Servant passa-ges, 

1. Isa 7:l4-l6; 9:7 

2. Amos 4:13; 5 tS. Micah 4:1-3. Isa 42:5-9; 6083.

but many scholars maintain that the final reference is to an 
individual personage.^ In the Old Testament we find that the 
emphasis laid on the kingdom of God is on a national basis rather 
than an individual basis. The nation was the church of God. 

The Day of Yahweh inaugurates the new conditions of life which 
are included in the idea of the Kingdom of G 0 d, The phrase "kingdom 
of God" does not actually occur as such in the Old Testament as 
Wheeler Robinson points out,2 However, there are many references 
to the rule and kingship of God as has already been inducted. Wheeler 
Robinson feels that the idea of the Kingdom of God, in the Old 
Testament as in the New, is properly eschatalogical.3 The conception 
of the Messiah did not always appear in the Old Testament thought 
concerning the Kingdom of God, and as Wheeler Robinson points out, 
is not essential to the Old Testament idea of the Kingdom.^ 

The prophets foresaw the coming of a day of judgment. With 
the inauguration of the Kingdom of Yahweh the nations of the earth 
were to be judged by their Ruler, and they were to be converted to 
the worship of Yahweh. The salvation of the Lord shall reach to 
the ends of the earth.5 Justice and righteousness shall be purged 
of its unworthy members. The remnant of Israel are to be exalted 
to greatness; and justice and righteousness shall be found in their

2. Robinson,W. Religions Ideas of the Old Testament P.193 

3. Ibid , p.194. "In one respect, however, the New Testament idea of 

the Kingdom of God strikingly differs from that of the Old Testament, 
which is its foundation. According to the general outlook of the 
New Testament, this consummation of life on earth is itself the 
prelude to life within a wider ’heavenly 1 2 3 4 horizon, made credible by 
the doctrines of resurrection and immortality. But the new order 
of life contemplated in the Old Testament is to be. realised wholly 
;on the earth and in the immediate future. It is itself the final 
stage, and there is no sense of contrast with some heavenly life which 
will follow it."

midst. "At its lowest level this conviction may he no more than 
a narrow and intolerant patriotism; at its highest it is the 
condition of all progress in morality and religion,Tims shall 
the earth he filled with the knowledge of Yahweh. 

The great prophets of Israel shared with their predecessors 
and with their contemporaries the belief that Yahweh would interfer 
to put an end to the existing order. To some extent their ideas 
were apocalyptic, for they looked forward to a new world built on 
the ruins of the old. However there was a great difference between 
the escbatalogical ideas held by the nopulace as a whole and the ideas 
held by the prophets. The popular eschatology was political and 
national, while the prophetic was primarily ethical and religious,2 
The people generally held the idea that the Day of Yahweh would come 
when Israel was overwhelmed and oppressed by her enemies. Then Yahweh 
would appear in all his splendour and majesty to destroy the old 
universe of men and create a, new one in which Israel and Yahweh should 
have pre-eminence.3 The prophets regarded the Day of Yahweh as a day 
of judgment for Israel. When Yahweh came it would not be to avenge 
his people on their foes, but to vindicate his own moral character. 

After the exile anew emphasis became central in Jewish thought, 
and never left it. They now had an enlarged sense of the scale of 
things in space and time, and this gave rise to much eschatological 
and apocalytic thought.^ In addition to the belief that in the Day 
of Yahweh God would intervene in favor of the chosen people, and would

overthrow the enemies of Israel, and .the faith in a Messianic King 
belonging to the house of David, Jewish eschatological thought felt 
that there was to be an ingathering of the scattered members of the 
race to their own land, and the conversion of the gentiles,-*- We 
see this thought echoed in the Books of Daniel (Maccabean period) 
and the Book of Enoch, Here we see definite shape and direction 
given to the Kingdom of God granted by the Ancient of Days, Hope 
was the keynote of life, ’’When hope is in the heart it is as 
prophetic as the son of a young stream on the mountains. It is set 
for far destinies,Their vision was set on the eternal Kingdom 
of God that could not be destroyed, but was from everlasting to 
everlasting, upheld by the Almighty God who was their rock and their 
fortress.

CHAPTE! II 

The Teaching of Jesus on the Kingdom 

"The sap does not flox* until the spring, and 

the grapes grow not purple "before their season. 

Heither does a man see until he "be ready." 

O.W*S. McCall 

The Hand of God p.152. 

The Kingdom of God was the central theme in the proclamation 

of Jesus and the framework of all his teaching. A great deal depends 

on the meaning of the phrase in the thought of Jesus, W. R. Mathews 

is of the oioinion that misunderstanding of the term has "been caused 

by two mistaken interpretations; first the opinion that the Kingdom 

is identical with the church and secondly the opinion held by others 

that the Kingdom is the equivalent to the establishment of a sec\ilar 

society based on Christian principles, 1 He indicates that the gospels 

lend no support to the idea, that the Kingdom of G-od means the 

progressive realization of "social justice inspired by religious 

idealism". It is clean in the thought of Jesus that the Kingdom of 

Cod is to be brought in by a gracious act of G-od himself, 

Jesus announced "repent ye; for the Kingdom of Heaven is at 

hand,The Kingdom that Jesus announced was ethical in its demands,3 

and was connected with himself. It is a kingdom of faith ruled 

through the spirit of man rather than any set legal code. The will 

of G-od was going to be done because man so desired to act. It is 

clear that the kingdom and rule that Jesus announced was not of the 

nature of the kingdoms of the world. 

The Kindgom belongs to Christ. He is its king, and at the end

of time the punishment of the wicked is in his hand.l Christ seems 
to regard his rule as "being in the near future, instead of being 
during his earthly ministry.^ Some of those that were then alive 
would see the kingdom of Christ come in; and so they did. The 
crucifixion of Christ became his coronation, for men now recognized 
him as the King Triumphant. Kiabuhr contends that the meaning of 
both life and history is disclosed in Christ and his cross,3 the 
arrival of the Kingdom of God which is everlasting and for all 
time. The Kingdom of God may then be^said to have existed on earth 
in his person from the first moment of his manifestation. It is 
through Christ that the kingdom is constituted.^ - 

A great deal of emphasis'has been laid on the apocalyptic and 
eschatalogical nature of the kingdom of God, with the result of 
almost complete neglect of its present existence. If Jesus was fully 
conscious of himself as the Son of God, and the founder of this 
kingdom from the first, then in his view this kingdom could not have 
been-only a, future hope, but a present reality. The Kingdom is both 
a present reality and a future glorified form in eternity.5 o?he 
kingdom had come in the person of Jesus. Christ,^ With the disciples 
gathered around him it was evident that the Kingdom of God h$s begun 
on earth. 

The kingdom has its beginning with the introduction of a new 
principle of a divine rule into the hearts of men through the ^ord*.? 
The kingdom of God is spiritual, and to qualify for citizenship you

have to be born again of the spirit.-*- It is therefore essentially 
inward, and is vital and invisible. ^ The kingdom works through, men, 
and has therefore an impact on the secular kingdoms in its midst. It 
is a principle working from within outward for the renewal and 
transformation of every department of our earthly existence. G. B. 
Caird writes that w it is as though in the person of Jesus Christ a 
health giving serum had been injected into the ailipg body of 
humanity, and ever since has been spreadii^its effect from cell to 
cell."3 

Jesus put it this way? H The Kingdom of heaven is like unto 
leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, until 
the whole was leavened.The kingdom that Jesus saw was therefore 
one having to do with the inward condition of man rather than the 
nationalistic particularism of the traditional Jewish conception of 
the Kingdom of God. The kingdom is not completely come until every 
thing in human life is brought into complete harmony with the will 
of God.5 

Dr. lliebuhr rightly declares that Jesus in his interpretation 
of the kingdom completely rejects Jewish legalism. ,f No law can do 
justice to the complexities of motive which express themselves 
in the labyrinthine depths of man’s interior life .’® 0 In Jesus 
teaching of the kingdom the law becomes a products of the spiritual 
relationship between God and the individual. The will of God 
applies to all nations and not merely to’ the Jewish nationality.

It is a law of the heart and not of the le.tter, Thus Jesus, in 
rejecting Jewish legalism also rejected Jewish nationalism in his 
conception of the kingdom. "The story of the Good Samaritan 
obviously implies the rejection of nationalistic Messianism"! and 
a national kingdom for the rule of God, 

Alan Richardson points out that Christ knew that with Himself 
the kingdom of God had come, and he goes on to indicate that Jesus 
through his preaching and his miracles proclaimed that the time was 

fulfilled; the Kingdom of God expected by the prophets of old had 

2 u 

come.^ 

When Jesus rides into Jerusalem on an ass, he is deliberately 
fulfilling the prophesy of Zechariah ix.9; he is ’the King 
meek and lowly’, not a proud conquering war-lord who has come 
to seize a kingdom with a sword; and thus Jesus gives a 
brilliantly enacted representation of what kind of a. Messiah 
he tho\ight himself to be. He comes to Jerusalem as a King, 
claiming his o\m\ but he is come to claim his kingdom from 
the throne of b, cross. When he curses a fig-tree. .he does 
so symbolically as God’s Messiah pronouncing judgment upon a 
faithless Israel,....When he cleanses the temple and drives 
out the money changers, he fulfills the prophesy of Malachi 

iii. 1-^*3

These references can be multiplied many times, but 'they serve 
to prove that Jesus was convinced that the kingdom had come in his 
person, and that he was the King spoken of in the past and looked 
for in the future* These references can be multiplied many times, 
but they serve to prove that Jesus^ convinced that the kingdom had 
come in his person, and that he was the King spoken of in the past and 
looked for in the future.^ 

Jesus also thought of the Kingdom as a sphere of privilege and 
blessing into which the disciple is admitted. Here it is that man

receives the forgiveness of his' sins and attains the satisfaction 
of his spiritual wants.1 He is filled with righteousness and inherits 
eternal life.^ E. F. Scott writes that "those who inherit the kingdom 
v/ill he set free from sorrow, disease and oppression, and from all 
that now weighs on life a,nd confines it."3 Those who seek the will 
of God are alive already with the life of the Kingdom. It is in this 
respect that the meaning of life transcends history, and yet is 
fulfilled within the historical process,^ 

The conditions of entrance into the Kingdom of God are those 
of repentance and fait^5 By faith Jesus did not mean the acceptance 
of any dogma, f, The life of faith is not the acceptance of doctrine any 
more than the life of the natural man is the acceptance of mathematical 
equations, or the life of the artist is the acceptance of aesthetic 
canons."^ Archbishop Temple writes of true faith as being personal 
fellowship with the living God. This is the faith of which Christ 
spoke, and one of the conditions of entrance into the Kingdom, Karl 
Barth declares that the gospel requires faith. Only for those who 
believe is it'the power of God unto salvation,? C. H, Dodd speaks of 
this faith that is a requ isite for the Kingdom as something that is 
the opposite of any assertion of the human personality, to 1 stand 
still and see the salvation of God, f 2 Faith is trust in God and his 
purposes outside the will of man. 

The other condition that Christ spoke of as being necessary for 
entrance into the Kingdom was that of Hepentence. Niebuhr speaks of

repentence as an expression of freedom and faith, differing from 
remorse which is the “expression of freedom without faith. Christ 
made it quite clear that there was no pla.ce in His Kingdom for self- 
righteous men and women, “For I say unto you, that except your 
righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and 
pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, 

As an illustration there is the story he told of the Publican and the 
Pharisee,? Niebuhr declares that the final exercise of human freedom 
in the human spirit is the recognition of the false use of that 
freedom in action*^ Man 1ms to recognize the fact that he has not 
lived as he ought, but has gone against the will of God, and therefore 
fallen short of the glory of God. By repentence Jesus meant not only 
the remorse felt for past actions, but a change of life, “Sin no 
more“5 is the command of repentence. Barth rightly declares that 
repentence means “being open to the strangeness of resurrection and 
to the free and boundless initiative of faith,“6 Repentence for 
Christ involves a readiness to surrender individual freedom of movement 
to the free movement of G-od* to surrender oneself to the freedom of 
the Spirit of God; leap over the enclosing fence erected by sin to 
the wide expanse of the green pastures that lie beyond. In addition 
to the declaration that the Kingdom of God had come, Jesus also spoke 
of the Kingdom of God that was to come at the end of time. This is 
the escdatalogical element.

Prophetic and. apocalyptic hopes anticipated an end which 
would both disclose and establish the sovereignty of God; 
which would both reveal the meaning of life and fulfill 
it. In Jesus 1 2 3 4 5 own reinterpretation, these two facts of 
history’s culmination a,re, at least partially, separated. 

The indication of this separation is given in the double 
affirmation that on the one hand the ’’Kingdom of G-od” has 
come” and on the other that ’’the Kingdom of God will come”. 

On the one hand history is still waiting for its culmination 
in the second coming of the triumphant Messiah,......The full 

implication of the double idea that ’’the Kingdom of G-od has 
come”, and that it is ’’coming” is that history is in the 
interim.. 1 

C, H* Dodd in an article on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ 
writes that ’’the various predictions of what is to come to pass after 
the death of Jesus are among the most difficult parts of the gospel. 

He points out that the language and imagery employed are those taken 
from the traditional eschatology of Judaism, Certainly it is 
difficult to determine exactly what Christ said on the subject, and 
to determine just what he did mean. While Jesus declared the 
Kingdom of G-od already inaugurated on earth, he also spoke of its 
consummation in another world,3 

The early church interpreted him to mean that the end of time 
was very near, even within their lifetime. Again 0 , H, Dodd suggests 
that Christ did not expect that history would come to an end shortly 
in view of his ethical teachings which implied that human life would 
go on, much as before,^ However, Christ did preach a future judgment. 
He spoke of the close of the age being at the harvest, when the weeds 
are gathered up and burned, 5 Then again he sp eaks of the day when the 
Son of Man will take his seat on the throne and judge the twelve tribes

He also spoke of a fixture reward for those that were the saints 
of God. Those who treat the sick, and have compassion on the poor 

p 

will receive their reward in Heaven. c Similarly with the parable 
of the talents, we find a, suggestion that reward and punishment xtfill 
"be made in Heaven, at a time when history has ended, and all things 
spoken of have come to pass.3 Assximing that the Little Apocalypse 
in Mark is authentic it appears that a day of Judgment is visualized 
as coming in the near future accompanied hy visible signs.^ This 
mislead the early church into believing that the end was near with 
the Jewish war, etc. Even if the 'Little Apocalypse* is not 
authentic it must have had some basis for incorporation in the G-ospel 
as a saying of Jesus, and therefore cannot be contrar;/ to his general 
teachings on the subject. 

In Jesus' teachings on the last things we see a distinct 
difference from the Greek theory of history that left it without 
meaning. The purposes of God had come to pass. The Kingdom of God 
had come with judgment upon mankind. The end of the age is in sight 
with the justice of God about to be vindicated, Jesus taught a new 
covenant which was to be written on the heart in the spirit of love. 
"To accept the new Covenant is to enter into the Kingdom of God and 
to pay for it, as for a pearl of great price, with all that one has: 
one's life."5 Those who belonged to God would receive their own on 
the Day of the Lord, This is the day of resurrection, and the

culmination of history. 1 

Jesus does not suggest that the preaching of the gospel will 
banish evil from the world or that social ethics will bring in the 
Kingdom of God in its fullness. "The poor ye will always have with 
you"he tells his disciples. He sees the growth of evil in the 
world as well as the growth of good. Thus he predicts the false 
Christs, the wars, and the persecutions of the righteous that are 
going to come.3 

The Kingdom of Cod that is ushered in with the end of the age 
will be preceded by a period of great tribulation* There will be 
wars and rumours of wars, with nation rising against nation, and 
famines and earthquakes. This was to be only the beginning of the 
tribulation,^ 

But immediately after the misery of these days, the sun will 
be darkened, and the moon will not shed its light, and the 
stars will fall from the sky, and the forces of the sky will 
shake. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the 
sky, and all the nations of the earth will lament when they 
see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, in all 
his power and splendor. And he will send out his angels 
with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his chosen 
people from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the 
other.......But about that day or hour no one knows, not 

even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father*5 

Dr. Wiebuhr is undoubtedly correct when he represents history 

after Christ as an interim between the disclosure of its true 

meaning and the fulfillment of that meaning.^ The idea of the 

Kingdom of God as "having come", and the idea of the Kingdom of 

G-od as "coining" presents one of the familiar paradoxes of Christianity,

and has given rise to several interpretations amongst which are 
those of ’’realized eschatology”^- and ’’apocalyptic future revelation”. 
Truth is represented in both interpretations, but the one needs the 
other for the complete truth. Dodd points out that we are confronted 
with two strains in the teachings of Jesus, the one appearing to 
contemplate the almost indefinite continuance of human life under 
historical conditions, while the other appears to contemplate the 
speedy end to these conditions.2 Both are deeply embedded in the 
early traditions, and "Both have to be considered in relation to each 
other. Violence is done to the early documents when one or the other 
is eliminated. 

C. H. Dodd is perhaps to be questioned on his theory of realized 
eschatology according to which the coming of Christ effectively 
fulfills the Messianic prophesies, and his own person in the 
resurrection completes his own words on the coming in of the Kingdom 
with glory. Dr. lH©ouhr is right when he declares that ”the strain 
of thought embodied in the Hew Testament hope of a ’second coming’ is 
indispensable for the Christian interpretation of history, and for a 
true understanding of Hew Testament thought,” 3 The idea of history 
a.s an ’’interim” between the first and second comings of Christ has a 
meaning which illumes the whole of human life. Truth has been 
revealed, and the ultimate nature of the created man has been revealed. 
It only remains for man to see, and then to walk the path so shown. 

Jesus gave the impression that the time of his second coming 
was not far off. The nearness of the end of time was emphasized.

This thought was carried over into the teachings of St. Paul and the 
early church. It is due to the ’’illusion of thought which deals with 
the problem of the relation of time and eternity.”! Time is only 
relative. In the sense of the Greek word ’chronos* it is here 
only for a fleeting moment. Compared to eternity the chronos doesn’t 
exist, for it becomes nothing, and is less than the grain of dust 
compared to the whole of the earth’s surface. Still it makes up 
the whole. C. S. Lewis in one of his books writes of the entrance 


to Heaven, that was so large from below yet which viewed from above 
was very small. The Visitor is referring to the bus by which he 
arrived. 

'Where would ye have had her go?’ 

’Why where we all came from by that bus. The big gulf, 
beyond the edge of the cliff. Over there. You can’t 
see it from here, but you must know the place I mean.* 

My Teacher gave a curious smile. ’Look,’ he said, and 
with the word he went down on his hands and knees. I did 
the same....and presently saw that he had plucked a blade 
of grass. Using its thin edge as a pointer, he made me 
see, after I had looked very closely, a crack in the soil 
so small that I could not have identified it without this 
aid. 

’I cannot be certain', he said, 'that this is the crack ye 
came up through, But through a, crack no bigger than that 
ye certainly came. 1 2 

5 But-but,’ I gasped with a feeling of bewilderment not 
unlike terror. 'I saw an infinite abyss. And cliffs 
towering up and up. And then this country was on top of 
the cliffs,, 

’All Hell is smaller than one pebble of your earthly world; 
but is smaller than one atom of this world, the real world.,., 1 
’It seems big enough when you’re in it, Sir. *2 

This is time compared with eternity. In time you are overawed by its 

vastness; out of time it loses its meaning. This has to be kept in 

mind when the fulfillment of G-od’s purpose in time is considered, and

when the words of Christ concerning the End are studied, 

John Marsh speaks of the two terms that are used to denote 

•time 1 2 in the New Testament, They are 'chronos' and 'kairos'. 1 

Chronological succession of time is denoted hy 'chronos'. The 

•time’ of Jesus is ’kairos', and so is a time of opportunity. This 

conception of time is of promise and fulfillment. Marsh pats it 

this way: H The ’chronos 1 , the duration, of the ’kairos’, is not 

yet run out. In this statement we see how chronos and kairos are 

related.’’^ There will he a period when the time \*ill he no longer, 

and history will he closed. The finite will disappear in the eternal. 

The Kingdom of God, in the words of Christ, is come, Believe, 

and on entering into the Kingdom you receive the Holy Spirit which is 

one with the Son and the Father, The world is coming to the end of 

its period. The time of salvation has come and now is. On the Day 

of Judgment which is the Lord’s it will he too late. The Day of 

Judgment, for Christ, viewed from the vision of the eternal, is near 

at hand. Every moment of time makes for the fulfillment of life. 

Take heed, for the day is coming when time as such shall he no more, 

TIME REAL AND IMAGINARY an allegory 

On the wide level of a mountain's head, 

(I knew not where, hut ’twas some faery place) 

Their pinions, ostrich-like, for sails outspread, 

Two lovely children run an endless race, 

A sister and a brotherJ 
This far outstript the other; 

Yet ever runs she with reverted face, 

And looks and listens for the hoy behind; 

For he, alasJ is blind] 

O'er rough and smooth with even step he passed, 

And knows not whether he he first or last,

CHAPTER III 


THE THOUGHT OP THE APOSTLES ON THE KINODOM OF GOD 

Come Thou long-expected Jesus, 

Born to set Thy people free; 

Prom our fears and sin release us, 

Let us find our rest in Thee. 

Charles Wesley, 

The early church was built on the expectation of the early 

coming of the Kingdom of God in glory. The communism of the church 

in Jerusalem was based on the idea that the Kingdom would come with 

final power at any time. They were certain tha,t the new age of the 

Messiah had begun. Alan Richardson suggests that it was just at 

this point where the early Church encountered a serious difficulty*^ 

Through the prophets and Jewish eschatology they had come to believe 

that when the Lord visited his people, and ushered in the New Age it 

would be accompanied with great signs; by events of earth-shaking 

and worid-changing magnitude. 

Yet the Messiah had come, his Kingdom had drawn nigh, his 
signshad been given, but the world was outwardly much the 
same as it was in the day when Jesus came into Galilee 
preaching. Caesar still sat on the imperial throne; 

Pilate remained procurator in Judea; Herod Antipas, ’that 
fox’, still was tetrarch of Galilee.2 

The great crisis had passed, and yet there was scarcely a 
ripple on the surface of the great stream of history in 
the Graeco-Roman worid.3 

In the light of the sayings of Jesus concerning the Kingdom^ it was 
natural that the Christians of the first generation or two should 
expect the early return of the Lord to complete the consummation of 
the Kingdom. The time to them was short, and the earliest disciples 
fashioned their community life on that basis. It has been suggested

that the distress in later years of the Jerusalem church^- was the 
result of their unfortunate experiment in communal living^ on their 
capital which they thought a safe plan because of the short interim 
period before the Lord’s return. 

The Gospel histories of Christ were not written for some years 
because the early Christians didn’t see any need in writing such a 
history when there would be no posterity to read it. Pail discourages 
marriage on the basis of the early coming of the Kingdom where lusts 
of the flesh would be unknown,3 For Paul, the appointed time has 
grown very short. The end of the age was to happen in his life-time, 
or at the latest during that of the next generation.^ Those who had 
already died in the faith would be brought back on the Day of the 
Lord. Those that were alive at the present time would have no 
advantage over those that had fallen asleep. On that day 11 those of 
us still living will be caught up with them on clouds into the air to 
meet the Lord,”5 

As time went by, the understanding of the situation by the 
Christians developed. The end was not yet. The Gospel was first to 
be preached to all nations. ^ jhe p- ew Order and the old world order 
must exist together in the world for a time. The Kingdom of God was 
to exist for a time in the midst of the empire of the Caesars. C, H. 
Dodd notes that Paul in his earliest letters was greatly concerned 
and occupied with the expectation of an early second coming of the Lord 7

However, 1 Corinthians is the latent of his letters in which that 

expectation is acute, and although this expectation continues to he 

central in his thought other ideas are achieving equal importance. 

The world is an empire whose capital city is heaven, whose 
emperor is Christ, But Christ has not yet subdued the 
world to his law, educated it in his ways, united it in 
loyalty to himself. To accomplish these ends he has set 
throughout his empire colonies with the full rights and 
privileges of the Kingdom of Heaven and with his own 
/ authority and power at their disposal.^- 

Paul writes that "our citizenship is in Heaven," (Dr, Moffatt 

translates "We are a colony of Heaven,")^ This idea becomes dominant 

in'the thought of Paul, The community of faith is developed living 

according to the standard of Jesus Christ in the sure and certain 

hope of the resurrection which is to coined 

The Christian leaders of the early church began to see the 

Gospel of Christ in a different light. They saw the Spirit of God 

reaching down end touching the soul of man. They saw the Kingdom of 

God in a new light. It had indeed already come. Christ was their 

King, With Christ they were set free from all bondage to sin, and 

the limitations of the ma.terial world.^ They were the ecclesia of 

God. They didn’t give up their belief in the Day of the Lord when 

history would come to an end as a film strip unravelled to the last 

picture. Hor did they discard the conviction in the last judgment 

of God, but they saw Christ' in man, and they saw a mission that had 

yet to be accomplished in history before the purposes of God were

work. Man, who through his nature was still inclined to rehell 
against God was, through the grace of God given the chance to 
repent and express an honest desire for the Higher Way. His 
citizenship papers in the Kingdom of Heaven were ready. All that 
was needed was the final signature of an honest soul who had 
complete faith in the purposes of God, and trust in his goodness. 

With the realization of the mission of the church, they 
realized that they had a responsibility as servants of God. This 
involved a system of ethical living that was far above tha,t of 
their pagan neighbours. Belonging to God they could no longer live 
lives that were dominated by self, but they had to live for one 
another and the world. The brotherhood of man, and the fellowship 
of the community became important. Theirs was a missionary 
responsibility to bring Christ to the world as they knew him. By 
this means the Kingdom of God was to grow on earth and the reign 
of Christ was to be inaugurated. This is the emphasis of Paul and 
the other Christian writers of the Hew Testament, for this purpose 
the Gospels were written that the truth might be known, and that 
men might see the Way they were to go. When this was accomplished, 
then the Kingdom would come in with full power and glory and the i 
chronos would be completed. The time was still short, but the immediacy 
of the end was hot as near as was first thought. Ho man knew the 
hour or the day, and it was necessary for all to be ready for the 
final consummation; but it was also necessary for them to live as 
citizens of the Kingdom* 

The Christ whom God had chosen, and who suffered and was exalted 
to heaven is going to come shortly to complete the final judgment and 
reign in glory. MacKinnon suggests that this wa,s an emphasis of Christ

that was carried on in the tradition of the early church and 
emphasized by Paul and the apostles,-*- This spirit of expectancy 
is reflected in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians, first 
Peter, and to a certain extent in the Book of Revelation as well 
as in the early chapters of the Book of Acts.^ later there appeared 
a tendency to spiritualize the spectacular second coming, especially 
in the G-ospel according to St, John, 

History for Paul came to mean but one thing, the story of 
redemption. Dr, Morgan declares that Paul’s scheme of history is 
built on the apocalyptic idea of the two ages, one demon-ridden and 
’’under the bondage of mortality,” and the other ’’the coming age of 
righteousness, immortality and glory.”3 Dr, Dodd interprets Paul in 
the light of his belief in realized eschatology, and certainly Paul 
later came to place Ms emphasis on the Hew Israel which grows by 
incorporation into "the Body of Christ, 11 ^ The purpose of G-od 
advances not through the choice of an individual nation, but through 
the .inclusion of all humanity.5 The emphasis is on redemption, and 
it is this view that dominates Paul’s eschatology, “To be in Christ, 
and to be fit to participate in the new order which is impending - 
this is the supreme concern of the believer. 

It is not the purpose here to discuss the theology of Paul, 
but it is impossible to discuss Paul’s concept of the Kingdom without 
touching on some of the basic concepts in his theology, as well as

that of the theology of the other apostles. For Paul, man’s relation 
to the Kingdom became connected with the ideas of redemption, 
justification and reconciliation or atonement. For Paul, through 
the death end resurrection of Jesus the people of God had emerged 
out of bondage to sin into ’’the liberty of the glory of the children 
of God.Man before God is guilty of sin, but God who is judge 
’’justified the ungodly”,^ God gives his kingdom to undeserving men, 
in the here and now. However, men are justified only when they 
respond by fa,ith to the divine offer. "For it is by his mercy tha„t 
you have been saved through faith. "3 By reason of sin man is at 
emnity with God. In order to come into the Kingdom it is necessary 
that this emnity be removed, "God was in Christ reconciling the 
world to himself.”^ 

Troeltsch contends that earl;/- Christianity was primarily a 

religious movement and not a social phenomenon.5 It was concerned 

- 

with the salvation of the soul and the realization of a Kingdom 
which was not of this world. Certainly in the Few Testament writers 
the Kingdom is essentially spiritual, whether it be spoken of as the 
Kingdom that has already come or the Kingdom that is to come. This 
was the meaning of Jesus when he declared that the"Kingdom of God is 
within you*”6 The present age was going to be supplanted by a new 
spiritual order,7 The early apostles did not set out to reform the 
social system in the world. Their aim was to save the soul from the

consequences of sin.l 

Neither were the leaders of the early church concerned solely 
with the eschatological aspects of the Kingdom. They also had a 
message that had a direct hearing on everyday life. "Jesus was 
engaged in actively founding the Kingdom of G-od in the present, and 
applying the principles which should govern the conduct of its 
members."2 Pail, in founding his gentile churches was concerned with 
an institution which was the Body of Christ, and ought to he governed 
by rules of conduct in accordance with the principles of Christ. 

Their relationships with the world are not ignored, for the rule of 
Christ is already taking effect in the hearts of men. This is the 
Kingdom of G-od in the present, and as time went on and it became 
apparent that the second coming of Christ was not in the immediate 
future more emphasis was given to this aspect of the Kingdom in the 
teachings -of the church. The expectation of the speedy coming of 
Christ was not to degenerate into idleness. The:/ are obligated to 
work that they might not be a. burden to the brethern, and that they 
might make a worthwhile contribution to society,.'' 

In the second letter to the Thessalonians, assuming it to be 
Paul's, we see that the immediate hope of the return of Christ has 
given place to a return in an indefinite future. In the first 
letter Paul expects to be alive to experience the second coming ,^ 1 2 3 4 5 
whereas in the second it is the belief in the immediate comi ng that 
he discourages,5 In Homans it is suggested that the secon d coming

will be delayed until the heathen have come in, and the ultimate 
conversion of Israel which follows on the conversion of the Gentiles. 
The Kingdom of God is still the central point of the teaching of the 
early church, but it is in the sense of the Kingdom that was ushered 
in with the advent of Christ, rather than the Kingdom that is to be 
consummated at the second coming, no one but God knowing the time of 
the latter. 

The writer of the letter to the Hebrews conceives of Christ in 

terms of sacrificial language, and this becomes his concept of the 

Kingdom of God, Christ replaced the intercession of the old animal 

sacrifices by his intercession in Heaven. 

The medium of man’s salvation has been transferred from 
earth to heaven, where Jesus continues to exercise his 
saving priestly ministry. He thus brings to fruition 
the new, inward, spiritual covenant - ’the law written 
in the mind and heart,’ of which Jeremiah speaks, and 
which was to supercede the old defective legal covenant, 

The Gospel has become the final and absolute religion. This is the 

Kingdom of God, and the priesthood of Christ which is after the order 

of Melchizedek. This for the writer of the Hebrews is the Divine 

order of salvation, and the Kingdom of God. 

James, in his letter stresses largely the ethical teachings 

of Jesus, mentioning the Second Coming only in the last chapter. 3 

He represents the tendency to find the gospel in the Sermon on the 

Mount, This is the message of truth that has brought forth a ne\f 

creation.^" MacKinnon speaks of the Christology of James as being

of the primitive type which recognized Jesus as Messiah and exalted 
Lord. This H is the revaluation of Judaism in the terms and thoughts 
of Jesus. 11 1 Faith was necessary for salvation, hut needed to manifest 
itself in the actions of daily life. 

In Second fhessalonians we find a reference made to the Anti- 
Christ, which at that time is not identified with the Homan emperor. 
John,the writer of the hook of Revelation,discovered this same anti- 
Christ on the imperial throne in the person of Domitian, The purpose 
of the writer of the hook of Revelation was to show that the time is 
at last at hand. H His thesis is that Cod will speedily intervene, 
through Christ, to end the present order of things and inaugurate a 
new one, fJ “ He has a very high conception of the exalted Christ, and 
equates him with the apocalyptic son of Man*3 He is the supreme 
authority in the Church, and ruler over the kingdoms of the earth. 

He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.^ Here the redemptive 
work of Christ is enlarged on only in the eschatological sense. Christ 
is the Lamh who has redeemed mankind through his sufferings on the 
cross. The church for the writer of the Apocalypse has become a 
world wide community or kingdom. M He has made us a kingdom of priests 
for his G-od and Father. M 5 » Our text then means that Christ has made 

us a kingdom, each member of which is a priest unto G-od. 8,0 This is 
the universal spiritual priesthood of the followers of Jesus. John has 
a belief in the binding of Satan, and a first resurrection and judgment 
of all the Christians. These are to reign with Christ a thousand .years

released and there is final warfare between Satan at the head of 
the nations of the earth, and the Saints of God. Finally there is 
the resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment by God himself. 

With this last judgment there is also the destruction of death, and 
the appearance of a new heaven and earth. 

With the writing of the gospel of John we find that there is no 
longer an emphasis on the traditional eschatology. The ethical and 
spiritual aspect of the mission of Christ and the Kingdom are stressed. 
The essence of God is love, and this is the fundamental element in the 
Christian faith. The mission of Christ finds its place in the love of 
God. God has brought light into the world in the person of Jesus Christ. 
Here is the King and the Saviour, The writer is concerned with the 
preparation of mankind for the rule of God which is a spiritual rule, 
Toynbee writes of the one faculty that man possesses in common with 
God which makes^ it possible for God’s itfill to be done on earth as 
well as in Heaven, This faculty is love. n Thi.s stone which both Zeno 
and Gautama have so obstinately rejected is become the head of the 
corner of the temple of the Hew Testament, 18 ^ As far as the Kingdom 
of God enters into the time dimension at all, it isnot as a dream of 
the future only, but as a spiritual reality interpenetrating the 
present. The early Church went through a transition period where they 
saw the Kingdom of God as in the future only; a stone hewn from a 
mountain without hands, which'smote the image of a sinful world on 
its feet of iron and clay breaking thenu in pieces,3 to a vision of 
the Kingdom of God as it now exists through Ghrist in his rule in the 
lives of men together with the'vision of hope in the victory that was 
to come.

SECTION II 


THE THOUGHT OF THE PRIMITIVE CHURCH 


ON THE KINGDOM OF GOD 



- 32 . 


CHAPTER IV 

THE TWO WAYS 

"Choose ye this day whom ye will serve*" Josh. 24s 15 

In the conception of time of the primitive Christian church 
Dr. Cullmann describes the difference between the Jewish and Christian 
ideas by pointing out that in the Jewish conception the mid-point or 
change comes at the parousia whereas in the Christian valuation of time 
the mid-point comes in the interim period between creation and the 
parousia. Christ represents the mid-point in Christian thought, marking 
the ushering in of the New Age, which is not ushered in in Jewish thought 
until the Day of Yahweh*^ As a result Christian thought developed along 
different lines as soon as they freed themselves from the Jewish apocalyptic 
ideas that represented the Kingdom as coming in witjfc glory at the time 
of the Messiah* Christian thought was concerned with living as though they 
were already in the Kingdom of God, and in order that they might be ready 
for the expected second coming of Christ. The Jewish Christians were 
concerned with the rules of living according to Christ, and in this 
connection we have an early set of rules of conduct making the Christiana 
practical moral obligations more definite. This tract comes down to us 
as The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles or the Doctrina, which depicts the 
"Way of Life", and the "Way of Death". Goodspeed writes of the Doctrina as 
a set of rules similar to the Ten- Commandments and as an attempt to 

"foist the essence of the old legalism upon the new religion, reducing 

2 

its living faith to the keeping of a set of rules."

The Doctrina only comes down to us in Latin versions* Dr* Goodspeed 
declares that it was the Greek original of the Doctrina that was worked into 
the Greek Barnabas and the Apostolic Church Ordinances about A.D. 300 
and several ether early Christian writings and decrees* Both the Doctrina 
(written about the year 100 A.D.) \ and the Didache (written about 150 A.D.)^ 
were attributed to the teachings of the Apostles, and became the earliest church 
manuals* 

The Poctrina is a small work of less than a thousand words, but had 
a wide influence in the aarly church, and was wrought into various books 
of rules of Christian conduct* The original tract in a Latin version only 
came to light in 1899* This work together with the Didache was with its 
legalism in contrast to the teachings of St. Paul on the freedom of the 
Christian from law. The Pauline emphasis on faith and the inner spiritual 
life is entirely wanting. Goodspeed points out that the Doctrina and 
Didatehe are closer to James and Proverbs than to any other ancient writings*^ 

These works are concerned with the facts of every day living in the 
Christian community, and establish rules of behaviour. The Didache also 
includes rules for the conduct of the Lord’s Supper and Baptism, the 
treatment of visiting apostles, and other practical matters of the church 
life* ^ It is evident from the context of these works that the emphasis 
had shifted from the immediate expectation of the return of Christ to an 
expectation after certain events had taken place.

"You do not know the hour when our Lord is coming"^ they were 
told. However, they had to be prepared. They must not let their lamps 
of faith and works go out. There will be "false prophets and the corrupters 
will be multiplied". There will be hate in the world, and persecution® 
Many will fall away from the faith and be deceived. The world will be 
delivered into the hands of a "World-deceiver who will appear as a son 
of God," 1 2 3 * 5 6 

After the appearance of this false Christ then the signs of 
the truth will appear, the opening of the Heavens, the sound of the 
trumpet and the resurrection of the dead. At the resurrection only 
those who have their citizenship in the Kingdom will rise*^ The Lord will 
come with all his saints. "Then the world will seethe Lord coming on the 
clouds of the sky,"^ 

Persecution was on the horizon for the Christian Church. The 
end must have appeared to be near to many of them. The spiritual life 
assumed new importance. Relationships were to be on the highest level 
in accordance with the teachings of Christ. Fasting was to be observed 
twice weekly, and the Lord’s prayer repeated thrice daily.^ The signs 
of the end were at hand. The church lived in expectation.

The Books begin with the statement that "there are two ways, one of 
life and the other of death♦ With the way of life are connected all the 
virtuous ways of living; the love of God and the love of fellow man* With 
the way of death is connected all sin; murders, robberies, adultery and all 
that is evil«^ The way of life is the way of the Kingdom of God and 
eternity 9 The way of death leads to eternal death of the soul as well 
as of the body* With the Way of Life you find the connecting link 
that leads to the eternal Kingdom that is the end of all things. This 
is "the teaching of the Lord to the Heathen by the Twelve Apostles*

CHAPTER V 

THE LETTER OF BARNABAS 


These are three rules of the Lord: 
the hope of life is the beginning and 
end of our faith; uprightness is the 
beginning and end of judgment; love of 
joy and gladness is the proof of acts 
of uprightness* 

Barnabas ch 1:6 


The view Christians were to take of the Jewish scriptures was a 

serious problem in the early church for almost a cdntury and a half* 

The Letter to the Romans and the Gospel of MaHhew dealt with this problem, 

and saw in the Old Testament foreknowledge of the Gospel and Christ* 

The writer of Barnabas deals with this same problem, and allegorizes the 

Old Testament in the tradition of the Alexandrian school* 

The appearance of Barnabas immediately following the Revelation and 
followed by Hermas in the oldest complete Greek manuscript of the 
New Testament shows the regard in which it was held in Christian 
Egypt in the middle of the fourth century* Clement of Alexandria 
toward the end of the second century accepted-it : as scripture* 1 

Certainly this letter which scholars suggest was written in the year 130 A*D. 

has not had a small influence in theGhristian world, and was long held 

in high regard* ^ 

Christ existed in his belief before the creation of the world as 
the Son of God, and participated in the creation*^ The Cross 1 and the 
resurrection are the central themes in his theology and faith, as they 
were for Paul, Origen, and succeeding church leaders* The Old Testament

is for the writer of this letter simply a witness to Christ* Unfortunately 

he carries this doctrine to extremes and interprets everything in the Hebrew 

scriptures as being of Christ*"* - Cullmann points out that Barnabas was 

correct in interpreting the Old Testament as canon for the Christian 

community,but wrong in reading into the Old Testament the entire history 

of the incarnate Christ rather than a revelation of redemptive history 

that moves towards Christ as its goal* 

In the last analysis a Docetic attitude is present in the epistle 
of Barnabas. For the "new” content of the New Testament there is 
here no longer any room, since everything is already present in 
the riddle book of the Old Testament* 3 

Barnabas felt that the time was near when the consignation of the Kingdom 

would take place. It is possible that persecution was then underway, 

and the writer felt that these must be the times of tribulation that 

the Apostles spoke of in their writings* ’’The days are evil, and the 

Worker himself is in power*This is presumably the Anti-Christ to 

which other Christian apocalyptic writers had referred. Therefore, 

because the time was so near the writer felt that the Christians ought 

to take special heed and seek out the Lord’s ordinances. Here Barnabas 

introduces the law of Christ, ’’which is free from the yoke of necessity”*^ 

The Doctrina is quoted in chapters seventeen to nineteen as a way of 

Ghristian life* In writing cf the two ways of life he speaks of one as 

coming from God and the other as from Satan who is the ’’ruler of the present 

time of iniquity.”^ Again there is the attitude that we are living in 

the last days, therefore take heed for the Time of the Lord may come at 

any moment*

Barnabas rejects the primitive Christian concept of the past process 
from creation to Christ as a redemptive process* Cullmann states that 
in the early church the Creation story handed down in the book of Genesis 
continues to hold its place as a revelation of God, only it was interpreted 
from the central point of history whicfc was Christ."*" In Second 
Corinthians (3:14) Paul declares that the minds of the Jews are dulled 
when they read the Covenant agreement, 15 for only through union with 
Christ is it removed”. Barnabas interprets the Old Testament as only giving 
a veiled presentation of the events of the life of Christ itself. With 
this view the Old Testament as redemptive history is completely abandoned. 

God made it plain beforetime that we might recognize the events 
when they came to pass and that the Christian might not go astray* 2 
The prophecy of old was in order that we might understand the process of 
history, and that the Christian might not go astray after the “Evil One”, 
and therefore be lost to salvation. ”We must therefore examine closely 
the things of the present,and seek out the things that can save us*. fM 
Then follows further ethical instructions. Salavation through faith as 
emphasized in Paul is missing in the letter of Barnabas. It is necessary 
to do good, feeding the hungry and clothing the naked that in the time 
of tribulation God would hear the cry for help and say "Here I am.”^ - 

The present reign of Christ is described by the primitive church in 

the terns of his sitting at the right hand of God*^ The Kingdom of the 

present is made up of those who have set their hope on the cross and been 

baptised.^* Whoever goes into the waters of baptism goes there full of 

"sins and pollution", and comes out with the hope of Jesus, and in believing 

in Jesus he will have eternal life. Here Christ rules as lord,and this is 
his kingdom.

With Christ is the resurrection hope. Here is the assurance of 
eternal life, the suffering of the innocent for the guilty and that 
"he might fill out the total of the sins of those who had driven his 
prophets to death." 

He, in order to bring death to naught, and show the resurrection 
from the dead,because he had to be revealed in flesh, endured it 

so as to fulfill the promises made to the forefathers....... 

and to show while still on earth that he himself when he has 
effected the resurrection will be judge.^- 

One of the purposes of the resurrection is that the justice of God might be 

fulfilled. Those who live by the ordinances of God will be glorified 

in the Kingdom of G 0 d, and the ones that choose to do evil will perish*^ 

At the judgement which is to takeplace when the "Evil One"is destroyed 

Christ will act as Judge.3 The world will be judged impartially, and each 

will receive according to what he has done. Therefore we cannot fall 

asleep and neglect our conduct, or we will be thrust out of the Kingdom 

of God«A Therefore they are warned that it might not be found true of 

the Christians that many were called and few chosen. The Christians are 

warned to keep the Day of Judgement in mind that they might not go astray 

from the Way of Life. 

They are warned that they must suffer to belong to the Kingdom. It 
is described as wool set in the midst of thorns, "for whoever wishes to 
carry away the wool must suffer much, because the thorn is terrible, and he 
can only get possession of it through pain."^ He concludes by saying 
that Christ also stated that whoever wanted to get into his Kingdom must 
go through affliction and suffering. This seems to echo the thought 
that the Christian must be willing to bear his cross as did Christ. This 
warning seems to suggest the note of persecution, with the subsequent 
suffering of the Christians.

Lastly the writer of Barnabas faces the question of the time when all 

these things should be. He suggests that the end of time will come in six 

thousand years. One day is as a thousand years in the sight of the Lord c 

The world is still in the process of creation, but at the end of six days 

(six thousand years) the purposes of God will be complete 

"And he rested the seventh day" means this: When his Son comes and 
destroys the lawless one, and judges the ungodly and changes the 
sun and moon and stars, then he will rest on the seventh day, 2T 

This is the completion of the Time, and the consumation of the Kingdom 

and Creation©

CHAPTER VI 

CLEMENT OF ROME 

Ye foolish onesl compare yourselves 
to a tree; take a vine. First it sheds 
its leaves, then a shoot appears, then a 
leaf, then a flower, and afterwards a 
sour grape, then a ripe grape. You see 
that in a short time the fruit of the 
tree comes to maturity* 

1 Clement 23:4 

The letter of Clement to the Corinthians is one of the earliest Christian 
documents that has come down to us outside of the New Testament. Scholars 
have dated it at 95 A.D. The author is not named, but from ancient times the 
letter has been ascribed to Clement who was bishop of Rome from A.D. 

SB to 97, and E.J. Goodspeed states that "no serious objection to this 
authorship can be raised", which is an unusual statement concerning 
early literature as far as scholars are concerned*^ The so-called Second 

o 

Letter of Clement is also of Roman origin, but was written about 150 A.D* , 

and is considered of doubtful authorship by Eusebius in his Church History * 

Modern scholars agree that this second letter was not written by Clement, 

and it has been suggested that it was a sermon by a later bishop of Rome 

and sent to Corinth where it was acknowledged by Dionysius in a letter 

preserved in Eusebius 1 Church History In both these letters the early 

coming of Christ to reign on earth is emphasized* 

The writer of First Clement was convinced of the power and might of 

God. Clement was a supporter of the Old Testament doctrine of history that 

placed God in complete charge of the universe. The stars, the sun and the 

moon persue their fixed courses under the hand of God* By the will of God 

the earth becomes fruitful, and produces food for man and beast* Everything 
is ordered in peace and harmony by God* ^

When God divided the nations he fixed their boundaries according to his 
plan* He chose Israel as a special people, and it was his purpose that 
the Holy One should come out of Israel. ^ He also formed man in his own 

o 

image and likeness. Therefore, those that belong to God through the 

redeeming act of Christ are to serve him with their whole being.^ God 

is emphasized as Lord, Father, and Creator of the universe, and has a 

chief place in his thought. God has control. 

The salavation of mankind is through Jesus Christ. He is the one 

that was foretold by the prophets of old, and has given a full revelation 

of God. He is the reflection of the majesty of the Lord, being his Son.^ 

Clement knows nothing of the Fourth Gospel or the Logos conception of 

Christ. Neither does he assign to Christ a place beside God in the 

creation of the world. His creed is the early declaration of Jesus as 

Lord.'* Jesus the Christ was sent from God, and the Apostles from Christ* 

£ 

Their coming was through the will of God. 

Clement of Rome echoes a great many Pauline concepts amongst which 
are salvation by faith,^ union with Christ in the sense of being "in Christ",® 

o 10 

the doctrine of election, * * * 7 and the emphasis on love as being a chief virtue. 
His Christianity is Christ centred, the Old Testament has great value for 
him from the viewpoint of Christ as the centre of history. A great deal 
of the letter to the Corinthians contains numerous quotations from the 
Hebrew scriptures. Here is the kingdom of God in the present, and the 
rule of Christ. Christ is the suffering servant who came to bear the sins 
of the wicked that they might attain to salvation. Humbleness is one of 
the great characteristics of this King, and ought to be imitated by his 
subjects*^ Christ came for the salvation of men through the mercy and

goodness of God. Here is pictured a God of love and mercy, who is full of 
compassion. 

Clement echoes the Pauline conception of election, and to a certain 
extent foreshadows the thought of Augustine in that there are a certain 
number chosen beforehand for salvation.^ The doctrine of election is not 
clearly stated in this letter, but is very clearly suggested. Salvation is 
still through Christ, and there is no idea of making up any number of fallen 
angels, or the idea that those elected by God will automatically be saved. 

There is always the danger that some of them might be eventually lost through 

2 

carelessness so that the number will be lacking. 

Those who have been made perfect by love live in the kingdom of God® 

In carrying out the commandments of God in love our sins are forgiven through 
love. The individual has received the marks of his new citizenship through 
love. God is thereby active in him, and at the last day u they will be made 
manifest at the visitation of the Kingdom of Christ.... This blessing has come 

to those who have been chosen by God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” k 

There is to be a resurrection of the dead at the last day. Clement 

seems to have believed in a literal bodily resurrection. God through Christ and 

nature is continually proving that there is a resurrection, of which Jesus Christ 
was the fruit when he was raised from the dead,5 Day and night, the planting 
of the seed and the harvest, spring time after the winter; these are resurrections 
that are daily taking place. Therefore surely God will bring about the 
resurrection "of those who have served kim with holiness in the assurance of 
a good faithlj ^ This is the promise of God, and with this hope the souls of 
the Christians are bound to him "that is faithful in his promises and upright 
in his judgements"• Clement does not speak of a universal resurrection, but 
only the resurrection of those that belong to God. Eternal death is the 
punishment of those who do not serve God,

God is the judge of the earth, and his judgement is righteous judgement* 

Christians are compared with good and bad workmen who are paid according to 

their work 0 Therefore Christians are urged not to be careless, but to be 

obedient to his will that they may receive the good things "that God has 

provided for those that wait for him."^- Those that forget God will be 

destroyed and there will be none to save them, but for those that perform 

acts that are in harmony with his will, and follow the way of truth there is the re* 

ward of all the gifts promised by God. Their iniquities are forgiven and their 

sins are covered up, to them belongs life in immortality, splendor in 

uprightness, truth with boldness, faith with confidence, and self control with 

sanctification.^ For those who hardtn their hears against God there is the 

condemnation of eternal death* "They went down alive into Hades and death 

will shepherd them."^ Clement is convinced that the day of judgement is near, 

and the unknown writer of Second Clement tells his brethem that the day of 

judgaent is near, and is coming like a burning oven*'* 

Clement is writing to the Corinthians concerning a dispute between the 

ruling elders wherein some who are reputable men, who have "blamelessly served 

the flock of Christ", have been unjustly removed from their positions* In so 

writing Clement gives evidence of a growing belief in the church as a divine 

institution with an ordered ministry. He does ridt wite of the church as the 

body of Christ although he was undoubtedly familiar with the phrase and in 

agreement with it. He rather suggests a belief in the church as a body of 

the elect that God has chosen for salvation, and with the duty of preachihg 

the gospel and the message of salvation throughout the earth. It is the vanguard 

of the Kingdom of God on earth.^ The writer of the so-called Second Letter of 

Clement has a more definite idea of the church as a part of the Divine Kingdom.

The church for him was a spiritual institution created before the sun and 
moon* No one would find salvation who was not a part of the "church of 
life"\ which was the body ofChrist* The visible church on earth is a copy 
of the true spiritual church, and therefore anyone who has marred the copy will 

p 

not share in the original. The true believer in faith therefore is a member 

of the true church of Christ which is spiritual. The call is given for 

repentence that men might find salvation. 

Both writers emphasize the nearness of the end, and warn that it 

might even come sooner than we expect for no one but God knows the hour of our 

3 

visitation* Clement writes of the coming day as the harvest which follows so 
closely upon the planting in the spring. The shortness of the season is 
emphasized, and he warns that soon and suddenly shall the will of God be 
accomplished. The writer of Second Clement tells his readers that "our 
stay in the material world is short, but the promise of Christ is great 

4 

and wonderful; it is rest in the Kingdom that is coming and eternal life." 

They are exhorted to wait hour by hour in love and uprightness for the 
Kingdom of God since they do not know the day or hour when the Lord will 
appear. ^ The end is near and the period is one of expectation. Time is 
measured not in years but in days and hours. It is a period of watching and 
waiting in preparation for the Day of the Lord.

CHAPTER VII 

THE GREAT WHITE TOWER 

And when the shepherd saw that the tower 
was beautifully built, he was very glad, 
for the tower was so built that when I saw 
it I coveted its building, for it was built 
as though it was made of one stone without 
a single joint in it<> 

The Shepherd of Mermas 
Parable 9 verse 7® 

Hermas was a Christian prophet of the First Century* Goodspeed 
states that he was either a slave or a freedman in Rome,^ and that he was 
acquainted with the Apocalypse of John which was written at that time, 
although it had very little influence on his own writing. The so called 
Letter to the Hebrews with its stern doctrine of no forgiveness for apostacy 
which Hermas understood to mean no forgiveness for sin after baptism stirred 
him to write his Shepherd of Hermas . Hermas maintains that a Christian may fall 
into sin once after baptism and be forgiven once, but only once. His message 
is cast chiefly in the form of interviews with the angel of repenbence. 

(The Shepherd). 2 * 4 The date of the writing of this work is placed between the 
years of 95 A.D. to 99 A.D.^* and foreshadows the later concept of the church as 

the only ark of salvation together with its sacrannart With this work of Hermas 

4 

the church rounded out its literary contribution to first-century Christianity* 
MacKinnon writes that the prophetic element runs throughout the whole 
book, which indeed it does. It is not the usual type of Apocalyptic literature, 
either Hebrew or Christian. The author does not attempt to hide his identity.

and the visions are fully explained. He is able to add commandments and visions 
of his own to those of the Old Testament, and parables in addition to those 
of Christ. The book reflects a concern for the Kingdom of God which is in 
the shape of the church, and her final completion at the last day. Then, 
when the building is completed we find the last chance of the individual for 
salvation is gone. 

His conception of the church reflects the expanding Christianity of 

the later part of the first century. It is widespread with many members, 

and is not altogether without influence. It begins to assume the place of 

a divine institution. As in the Second Letter of Clement, Hemas represents 

the church as existing before creation. He writes of the church as "an 

elderly woman". She was created first of all, and because of her was the world 

formed®^ The Church is represented as a great white tower being built by 

the holy angels of God to whom God committed his whole creation. It is 

sustained by the power of God, and is built on the rock which is Christ. 

The Church is supported by faith, self-control, sincerity, knowledge, 

2 

innocence, reverence and love* 

The Shepherd of Mermas envisages a coming persecution which will 

be the beginning of the end. The great persecution is represented in the 

3 

vision as a great beast. Faith in God who is the only one that will be 
able to save them is necessary® The beast is represented as having four 
colours in its head, black which is the world in which he lives, fiery blood 
which symbolizes the destruction of the world in fire and in bloody gold 
which represented those who have fled from the world, and white whic|i is the 
age to come for the chosen few of God*^ This is his doctrine of history. 

The church is in the building throughout; the building will be completed at 

the beginning of the age to come and after the persecutions and destruction 

of the world. _ _ __

Hennas reflects an asceticism that became prevalent in the church in 

the third and fourth centuries♦ The world is regarded as evil, and therefore 

to be destroyed,, Only the chosen ones of God are going to survive to the end 

and live in the Age which is to come. Salvation is only through Christ and 

is found only in theChurch. Baptism is necessary for salvation. 

Hear, then, why the trower is build on waters: it is because your 
life has been saved and will be saved by water. But the tower 
was founded by the command of the Almighty and glorious name, 
and it is sustained by the invisible power of the Master.^ 

The forgiveness of sins is operative in baptism, but this is conditional 

on faith and repentence of past sins.^ Baptism is for Hermas the seal of 

the Kingdom of God. Even the saints of the past had to pass through the 

water before they could enter the Kingdom. This they do after the saints 

have preached to them in Hades. 

They had to come up through the water to be made alive, for they 
could not enter the Kingdom of God in any other way than by laying 
aside the deadness of their former life. So even those who had 
fallen asleep received the seal of the Son of God, and entered 
the Kingdom of God. .....Before the man bears the name of the Son 
of God, he is dead, but when he receives the seal, he lays aside his 
deadness and receives life. So the water is the seal*3 

The book deals largely with repentence and its necessity for salvation. 

He deals with the many sins of the human race, some more serious than others; 

but all have hope of repentence with the exception of the apostates and 

blasphemers of the Lord.^ The Church is compared to a great tree that covers 

the face of the earth, and has taken the Gospel to the ends of the earth. Those 

who have transgressed are left under the authority of the angel Michael in 

the hope that they will repent and enter into the Kingdom, to come under the 

authority of Christ and go into the tower whicji is the Church of salvation^

In the Tower which represents the church the "apostles and bishops and 
teachers and deacons who have lived in the holiness of God" represent the 
most beautiful and perfect fitting stones. They represent the unity and 
peace of the church. Others who have suffered for the name of the Lord go 
into the building and add to its perfection* Those that have lived in the 
uprightness of the Lord and fulfilled his commands go into the building 
without any alterations. The stones that were rejected and thrown a short way 
from the tower represented those who had sinned but will be of use if they 
repent. However, if the building is completed before they have repented then 
they will no longer have an opportunity but be outcasts. Others were broken 
and completely rejected because they were completely wicked. Various other 
stones represent men who have heard the Word but not obeyed and were therefore 
rejected from the building*^" This parable represents the teaching and faith 
of Hermas concerning the Church. His visions and parables are but an 
elaboration of this theme. 

The time for Hermas is also near when the work of God will be completed. 
The building is nearly finished and men are therefore called upon to repent 
while there is yet time. Connected with his doctrine of the Church and salvation 
he elaborates on the rules of Christian living and sets down some twelve 
commandments. The Church is for him a moral and spiritual institution. He 
touches on its worship and organization only in its function as a society of 
the elect. The moral life which is the products of a sincere faith is the 
important thing for Hermas.

The church has no real root in the evil world. The Christian is a 
sojourner in a strange land, and the end is not far off when he will be 
received into the Kingdom if he is worthy. "For those who have doubted because 
of what they have done there is still repentence, but they must repent 
quickly, so that their home may be in the tower."^ The tower is nearly 
finished, therefore it is urgent that men act now if they wish to escape 
destruction.2 " Reform therefore while the tower is still in the building."^ 

The Church is the Kingdom of God, but it exists for the morrow when the 
building will be completed according to the purposes of God. The Christian 
lives by faith in the hope of that Day when the stones are fitted together and 
the promises of God are fulfilled.

CHAPTER VIII 


THE KINGDOM BY MARTYRDOM 

Since, therefore, affairs come to an 
end, two things lie before us, life and 
death, and each is going to go to his 
own place. One is of God and the other 
of the world. 

Ignatius 

Letters to the Magnesians ch. 5:1* 

Ignatius, bishop of Antioch, was a contemporary of Polycarp of 

Smyrna and Onesimus of Ephesus. Early in the second century he was 

condemned to death and taken to Rome to be thrown to the lions in the 

Colosseum. He was welcomed by groups from the churches on his way, and 

the churches that were near the route he was travelling sent delegations 

to greet him and encourage him. To all these churches he later wrote letters 

of acknowledgment, urging them to combat the Docetic heresy then spreading 

through Asia, and also urging them to stand by their bishops,^ Eusebius 

says that he suffered martyrdom in the Colosseum in A.D. 107-108, but modern 

2 

learning inclines to about A.D. 110-117» 

Ignatius gives the impression in his letters of the church as an 

instrument that is to be used to bring the message of the Gospel to the world. 

He has a high concept of the church, and its order in the threefold ministry 

of bishops, elders, and deacons together with the great value of the sacraments, 

3 

especially the eucharist. He speaks of the bread as "the medicine of immortality' 1 2 3 
and "the antidote against death". However, the church for Ignatius is not the 
Kingdom of God, but a means by which men may enter into that Kingdom which is 
not of this world.

The other worldliness of the Kingdom for Ignatius is underlined in 
his eagerness for martyrdom that he might enter into the glories of the Lord* 

In his letter to the Romans he asks them not to exert influence to obtain his 
release* “For the beginning has been well arranged, if only I can find favor to 
obtain my inheritance unhindered*“^ He is firm in his faith that through his 
death he will meet God*^ He feels that through his death he is going to 

come to life which is eternal 0 He asks to be remembered in their prayers 

3 

that he might reach the presence of God* This is the Kingdom of God for 
him* 

His emphasis throughout the letters is on the reality of the death 
and resurrection of Christ* 

Who was descended from David, who was the son of Mary, who was 

truly born, whoboth ate, and drank, was truly persecuted under 
Pontius Pilate, was truly crucified and died, in the sight of 
those in heaven and on earth and under the earth; who was truly 
raised from the dead, when his Father raised him and his Father 
in like manner will raise us also who believe in him* ^ 

It is through this living Christ that salvation is achieved* He died that 

men might escape death* 

Ignatius felt that they were living in the lafet times. With this 

conviction he issues a call for renewed devotion and humility to God* “Let 

us feel shame, let us fear the patience of God, that it may not result in

With the end of the age in sight, and the conviction that absolute 
truth is in Christ, Ignatius anticipates his martyrdom as a release from 
the evil world into the Kingdom of God which is beyond and not of this world. 
Here was faith and piety; trust and obedience. If Christ died upon a cross 
it was not for his followers to hope to escape, but to follow in his steps 
that they too might enter into the Kingdom,

CHAPTER DC 

POLYCARP TO PAPIAS 

For eighty-six years I have been 
his slave, and he has done me no 
wrong; how can I blaspheme my king 
who has saved me? 

The Martyrdom of Polycarp ch* 9:3 

The letter of Polycarp to the Philippians is an early sequel to the 
letters of Ignatius* Polycarp sent them the letter of Ignatius together 
with a covering letter of instruction and exhortation. He does not stress 
the threefold ministry as Ignatius has done. When he wrote his letter 
he had no knowledge of the fate of Ignatius, and asks the Philippians 
if they have any news of him,^ On the 22nd of February A.D. 156 Polycarp 
the renowned bishop of Smyrna suffered martyrdom. So great was the sorrow 
and dismay occasioned by the startling event that the church at Smyrna 
recorded it in detail in a letter and sent it to the church at Philomelium, 

2 ' f. 

It was then circulated among the churches of the East, 

The Apology of Quadratus was written to the Emperor Hadrian in A.D, 
125 and presented to him when he visited Athens in defence of the Christians* 
The work itself has been lost, but some quotations from it are preserved by 
Eusebius in his Church History »^About the year 140 A.D. Papius who Eusebius 
tells us was bishop of Hierapolis, wrote down a great deal that he heard 
about the teachings of the apostles from people who had known them. This 
book which he called The Interpretations of the Sayings of the Lord has been 
lost with the exception of some extracts in Irenaeus and Eusibius,^

These works reflect the spirit of the early Christian church in the 

face of persecution and the antagonism of the heathen world* They also 

reflect the faith of the early church that still was in close contact with 

the Apostolic tradition and the life of Christ himself. Their creed is 

the "Kyrios Christos", Christ rules as Lord.’*' 

For these writers the present rule of Christ is the manifestation 

of the Kingdom of God in the present. Our faith is in Christ whom God 

raised from the dead. Everything in heaven and earth is subject unto the 
2 

risen Lord. Power over all things is ascribed to God 0 Even the martyrdoms 

3 

that have taken place are by his will. It is only through Christ that we 

4 

are able to enter into the Kingdom of God, which is essentially a heavenly 

kingdom.'* In a fragment of Papias preserved by Andreas of Caesarea we 

find the belief that God gave the rule of the earth to the care of angels, 

who were order to rule well. However, God is still the ruler of the earth. 

Anastasius of Sinai records that Papias viewed the references to paradise 

spiritually, and applied them to the church of Christ which he therefore 

6 

must have also thought of as spiritual* 

These writers were firm in the faith of the bodily resurrection of 

Christ. Polycarp declares that those who say there is neither a resurrection 

7 

nor a judgment are the first-born of Satan. In many instances together 
with the reference to Christ there is the description "who was raised from 
the dead." There is also a strong faith in immortality and the resurrection 

of the body at the end of the age. Polycarp is spoken of as having "won the 

9 

wreath of immortality" through his martyrdom. The prayer is that they 
might be gathered up by Christ into his Kingdom.

There is also a belief in a Day of Judgment, Polycarp writes of 
Christ as the one who is to come to judge the living and the dead,"*" He 
also writes that the Christian must be careful of his behaviour, and not harsh 
or unfair in his judgments "for we must all stand at the judgment seat of 
Christ, and each give an account of himself,"^ In his martyrdom Polycarp is 
quoted as saying that he is threatened with the fire that burns only for an hour but 
his enemies do not know about the "fire of the coming judgment and everlasting 
punishment, which is reserved for the wickedChrist was going to come 
and judge at the last Day, and it was therefore necessary not only to do good, 
but to forgive if we ourselves desire forgiveness, 

There is little in these writings of the early expectation of the 
Kingdom, although from what we know of the church of this period it is likely 
that they too had this belief, Philip of Side in his Church History of about 
430 Ap« declares that Papias and Irenaeus are wrong in their ideas about the 
millenium. What those ideas were we do not know but it is likely that they 

expected an early end to the age in common with the Christiah thought of the 
4 

period. 

The emphasis of this period was on the steadfastness in faith to Jesus 

Christ the Lord who was truly raised from the dead, and is to come to judge the 

living and the dead. To suffer on behalf of Christ was regarded with favor, for 

the Lord had promised that such should be with him in his Kingdom, Theirs was a 

vision of a heavenly Kingdom beyond this realm where the Saints of God would go 

to dwell with their Lord and Master in glory and honor® 

We bid you farewell, brethem, as you live by the teaching of Jesus 

Christ in the gospel 5 with him be glory to our God and Father and the 

Holy Spirit for the salvation of his chosen saints just as the blessed 
Polycarp suffered martyrdom. May we too be found in his footsteps in 
the Kingdom of Jesus Christ,,,*the Lord Jesus Christ gather me d.so with 
his chosen into his heavenly kingdoml To him be glory with the Father 
_ and Holy Spirit forever and ever. Amen, 5 ____

CHAPTER X 

JUSTIN MARTYR 

If we looked for a human 
kingdom we should deny Christ 
that we might not be slain* 

First Apology of Justin Martyr* 
ch. 11 

Justin Martyr was a native of Flavia Neapolis in Palestine. 

He was not a Jew, but travelled into the Greek world to complete his 
education. A.D. 150 found him in Rome where he wrote the only books of 
his that have survived; the Apology and Dialogue . He suffered martyrdom in 
Rome about A.D. 165.^ Eusebius mentions some eight works of Justin, and 
his contemporary Irenaeus mentions his work Against Marcion . The Apology 
is addressed to the emperor Antoninus and asks him to examine the charges 
against the Christians and see if they are justified. Goodspeed states that 

. /"v 

what is know as the Second Apology is probably a second edition of the First 

Apology, and was written a few years later. Justin was a writer of great 

fame and influence in the Christian world of the time. 

Justin is concerned with refuting the Gnostic heresies, and one of 

his works is directed against Marcion* The reality of Christ is emphasized 

together with his suffering and death upon the cross and the resurrection* 

Christ was not a phantom, nor was his death only imaginary. He was the Son 

of God from the beginning, and Lord of all. Justin names Christ Lord of the 
2 

Powers. Christians were atheists with regard to the heathen gods, but they 
worshipped the one true God. The appeal to the emperor is for justice through 
reason, which is a divine gift.

Christ is the judge. The wicked will be punished for their sins 

with everlasting punishment*"^ It is impossible to escape the eye of God* 

Every man goes to everlasting punishment or salvation according to the value 
2 

of his actions. The Christians shall be known by their works, and if they 

are hypocrites it will be known to God, and they will be condemned to everlasting 

punishment of fire* The human race has the power of avoiding evil and choosing 

good by the free choice of the will. Therefore mti is responsible for his own action 

and if he chooses the evil then he deserves the punishment that is given to him 

3 

by God* Man was created that through the free use of his will he might choose 
the good, and not the evil* Justin Martyr is not a determinist. Man is not 
governed by fate. The choice and responsibility are his own* 

A great deal of the Apology is concerned with the proof that Christ 
was fore-told in prophecy* He quotes from many passages in the Old Testament 
to show that the manner of Christ ! s birth, and the place were foretold together 
with his resurrection and exaltatioh*^ fulfilled prophecy* The 

desolation of Judea which was also spoken of had come to pass. This seems 
to give conclusive proof to Justin of the validity of the claims made for 
Christ. The argument from prophecy is not to be ignored. God is in 
control of history, and has ordered that his purposes should be accomplished* 

Justin was concerned with the objection raised by the heathen to 
the Christian faith that Christ was only born some 150 years ago under 
Cyrenius, and therefore it is impossible that the claims made for him should 
be true* In answer to this Justin declares that Christ was in the world 
at the beginning of time as the first bom of God. Christ is the Word, 

"of whom every race of men were partakers*"

and those who lived reasonably are Christians, even though they 
have been thought atheists; as, among the Greeks, Socrates and 
Heraclitus, and men like them; and among the barbarians, Abraham 

and Ananias, .. and many others whose actions and names we 

decline to recount, because it would be tedious. So that even 
they who lived before Christ, and lived without reason, were 
wicked and hostile to Christ, and slew those who lived reasonably. 

Thus every man either achieves salvation and reward, or eternal punishment. 

None are without excuse, as Paul writes in Romans. 

n In the beginning he made the Amman race with the power of thought and 
of choosing the truth and doing right, so that all men are without excuse 
before God„”^ 

Justin was a believer in the resurrection of the body. He states 
that the Christians expect to receive tgainst their own bodies, even though 
they have been buried in the earth, ”for with God nothing is impossible”.^ 
It is no more of a miracle with God that a man should be produced from a 
seed, than that the resurrection of the body should take place. There is 
no need to fear men, for they can do nothing to the Christian who is in 

’ f'Wy«v; l - tv ‘ T- ypv • ■ 

the hands of God. There is more need to fear Him who after death is able 

to cast both soul and body into hell* ^ 

The consummation is to be delayed until the number of those 

”foreknown by him as good and virtuous is complete.”^ For this reason 

they hold and teach their faith even though death is decreed against those 

that confess and teach Christ. The heathen only harm themselves in 

persecuting the Christians because this hatred without repentance brings 

6 

eternal punishment by fire.

The Kingdom of God is a heavenly kingdom* It is because they 
are members of a heavenly kingdom that the Christians do not fear death* 
They are delivered from punishment and spend a blessed existence with God* 
The Christians do not look for an earthly kingdom, but give their obedience 
to their earthly rulers, while belonging to the Kingdom of God which is 
spiritual*^ 

Justin gives a picture of the world as controlled by God, who 

gave his revelation to prophets who were more ancient than the Greek 

writers, and which prophecies have since been fulfilled as history 

testifies* The purposes of God are coming to completion* A call is 

issued for men and women to enter into the heavenly realm and testify 

to God through their lives. Rule yourselves through reason, be instructed 

2 

by the Divine Word and acquaint yourselves with the King Immortal*

CHAPTER XI 

ON IRENAEUS 

And to as many as continue in their love towards 
God, dees He grant communion with Him* 

Irenaeus Against Heresies ch. 27 

It is not intended that this should be a complete survey of the 
theology of Irenaeus but it is impossible to leave a discussion of the 
thought of the early church concerning the Kingdom of God without 
touching on the opinions of Irenaeus, one of the noted Christian 
leaders of the early church. Irenaeus is further remarkable in that 
he binds together the Eastern and Western Christianity of his day. 

He was born in Asia Minor, and spent his youth in Smyrna where he heard 
the great Polycarp speak. His middle and later life was spent at Lyons 
in Gaul where he succeedslPothinus as bishop, and carried on an active 
mission among the Gauls. Goodspeed describes him as one of the leading 
Christian writers of his day* Irenaeus in his writings appealed to a 
Christian scripture, not only the Old Testament and the four gospels, 
but the book of Acts , and the letters of Paul. It was in the time of 
Irenaeus that Christians began to call these books scripture His great 
work Against Heresies was written about 185 A.D. It is the only work of 
Irenaeus 1 that has remained to us in a fairly complete form, his other 
works being lost.

God was the creator of the world through the Word. He was not 
assisted in this work by any of the powers of heaven or earth, neither 
angels nor other powers inferior to himself* God created all things in 
harmony with one another. Every creature was given its own nature. The 
Word of God is all powerful, and it was this Word that called all things 
into being. "He spake and they were rnade. 1 2 3 ’^ 

Irenaeus declares that man has received the knowledge of good and 
evil. Obedience to God is life, and disobedience is evil and therefore 
results in death. God gave to man such mental powers as to enable him 
to know both the good of obedience and the evil of disobedience. ^ 

Irenaeus states that to dives t oneself of this twofold perception of 

p 

knowledge removes the character of a human being. God created 

man in his own image, but before man tfould achieve the perfection of 

the image of God it was necessary that he be made man first* 

How, the^ shall he be a God, who has not as yet been made a man? 

Or how can he be perfect who was but lately created? How, again, 
can he be immortal, who in his mortal nature did not obey his 
maker? For it must be that, at the outset, you should hold 

the rank of a man, and then afterwards partake of the glory of God. 
For you do not make God, but God you. If, then, you are God*s 
workmanship, await the hand pf your Maker which creates everything 
in due time.3 

The mortal part of man has to be subdued by the immortal part, and then 
finally man will be perfect and in the image and likeness of God. 

Salvation is the ultimate deification of man, through Christ*s conquest 
of human mortality®^" 

Adam is a prototype of man. The idea of a mystical identity between 
Adam and all men is found in this treatise. Adam sinned against God by 
his disobedience. In sinning the likeness of God in man was destroyed, 
but not the image. In the beginning God permitted man to be swallowed

up by the “author of transgression", but he also in his mercy arranged 

and prepared a plan of salvation "which was accomplished by the Word" 0 

Man passed through all things, "acquiring the knowledge of moral discipline" 

and attaining to salvation and the resurrection from the dead. Having 

achieved this end he lives in the glory of God and with gratitude to 

the God of his salvationDeath is the result of sin. After Adam 

sinned he died. God set a limit to the state of death by interposing 

death and thus causing sin to cease. "Man, ceasing at length to live 

2 

by sin, and by dying to it, might begin to live to God." Irenaeus 
points out that Adam's sin follows almost upon his creation. He was 
sinful in his first significant action and his sinfulness came to light 
in that action.-^ Niebuhr declares that this is the symbol for the 
whole of humna history. Man rebelled against God almost from the 
beginning, and found his reward in death. Life and redemption was to 
be achieved only through Christ. 

Irenaeus also uses the argument of prophecy which has also been 
referred to in connection with Justin Martyr and developed in the 
chapters on Origen. As the predictions of the past have already been 
fulfilled in part, then in due time they will be fulfilled completely. 

The Roman empire is going to fall, and become a desolation followed by 
the end of the world. Christ is the stone which is cut without hands 
who will destroy the temporal kingdoms and introduce an eternal one. 

The Irtiord of God doesn't fail for it is truth revealed of old and proven 
throughout the ages.^ 

Christ is the judge. It is he who will separate the tares and the 
wheat.^ Christ is the one that decides at the last day who will be taken

and who will be left* Those who are disbelievers in him will be 
condemned* Those that continue in their love towards God are granted 
communion with him. Communion with God is life and light. Those that 
are separated from God due to their own choice find only death and darkness* 
Punishment falls on them because they are without good. M Now good things 
are eternal and without end with God, and therefore the loss of these is 
also eternal and never-ending.”"^ Those that believe in the Son are 
united to the Father through faith, and those that believe not are condemned 
already. 

As some people unil© themselves to God through faith, and others 

separate themselves from God so the Word of God in the person of Christ 

prepares a fit habitation for both. Those on the right hand are called 

into the Kingdom of Heaven, and those on the left are sent into eternal 
2 

fire. The end is preceded by an Antichrist who shall have power over the 

world for a time. This concept is taken from the Apocalypse of John who 

is quoted by Irenaeus in this connection. 

Irenaeus is of the opinion that as the world was six days in the 

making, and each day is equal to a thousand years then so will the world 

be given over to apostacy for six thousand years. The world will then 

3 

come to an end and the purposes of God will have been completed."' During 
this time man is being moulded after the likeness and image of God, and 
the wheat is gathered into the barns while the tares are burned. ”And 
for this 'cause tribulation is necessary for those who are saved. 

There is a resurrection of the body for those who are saved in Christ. 
As Christ waited three days for his resurrection so also ou&ht the 
Christian to have patience and wait for the hand of God to effect his 
resurrection.5 The saints of God will receive their rewards in their

resurrected bodies as God promised before time to Abraham and those descendants 

of his through faith*^ The rewards are to take place in the time of the Kingdom 

"which is the seventh day" and is therefore holy* 

In the Kingdom the saints will be supplied by God, and they will eat 

at his table in newness of life* "They will have of the dew of heaven and 

the fatness of the earth; nations and kings shall be subject unto them for 

the earth is theirs*"^ There shall be joy at the resurrection of the just* 

The whole creation shall enjoy a vast increase* This resurrection of the 

just is the first resurrection* The resurrection of the righteous ta.kes 

place after the coming of the Antichrist*^ The righteous shall be strong 

in the Lord and they shall know God* 

Irenaeus also sees a general resurrection of the dead when judgment 

shall take place. Then he sees the coming of the New Jerusalem* There is no 

mention in his treatise of 4 final battle that takes place with the loosing of 

Satan* He writes of the new Heaven and the new Earth as coming with the 

renewing of the condition of man in an incorruptible state. These things shall 

ever continue without end. The reward of the righteous is according to their 

fruits. Those that produce the most, that is a hundred-fold shall be taken 

up into heaven, those that produce sixty-fold will dwell in paradise, and 

those that only produce thirty-fold will inhabit the city of God on earth* 

L 

These are the many mansions of which Christ spoke* 

This is the consummation of all things in the thought of Irenaeus* 

The time will be accomplished at the end of six thousand years, and there will 
be a resurrection of the just who will prosper on the earth which will produce 
as it never has before. At a certain time there will be a general resurrection 
and a final judgment, when the eternal city descends on the earth and men are 
given their due reward* By this means is man brought to perfection through the 

Word which is Jesus Christ, and passe&eyond the angels into the image and likenes 
of God* The world and creation is :omplete. The work of God is accomplishec

ON ORIGEN 
M IHTRODUC TIOH . 

Origen was the most distinguished and influential of all the 
theologians of the ancient church, with the possible exception of 
Augustine. It is assumed that the place of his birth was Alexandria. 
He was born of Christian parents in the year 185 A.D.. His father 
Leonides gave him an excellent education. In addition to a thorough 
education in Greek learning he was also trained in the scriptures. 

In the catechetical school at Alexandria he listened to the lectures 
of Clement and Pantaenus. Alexandria had been since the days of the 
Ptolemies, a centre for the interchange of ideas between the East and 
West; and, a„s it had furnished Judaism with an Hellenic philosophy, 
so it also brought about the alliance of Christianity with Greek 
philosophy. 

In the year 202 a persecution broke out in which the father of 
Origen became a martyr, and the family lost their livelihood. Origen 
was supported for a time by lady of rank, but began about the same 
time to learn his living by teaching. The next year he was placed 
at the head of the catechetical school. He refused rent mer at ion for 
the position, but sold the books that he possessed, many of them 
manuscripts that he had copied, on the condition of receiving from 
the purchaser four obels (3#) a day. 

His fame and influence grew. Pagans thronged to him as xvell as 
Christians. Meanwhile the literary activity of Origen was increasing.

He commenced his great work on the textual criticism of the Bible, 
and published his commentaries on the Old Testament. In this manner 
he labored in Alexandria for twenty-eight years. He also travelled 
a great deal, and while in Palestine was received with favor by the 
bishops of Jerusalem and Caesaria where he gave public lectures in 
the churches. 

In Alexandria this custom had been given up, and Bishop Demetrius 
took occasion to express his disapproval and recall Origen to Alexandria. 
On his way to G-reece Origen was ordained a presbyter by his friends 
the bishops in Palestine. Demetrius called a synod in which it was 
resolved to banish Origen from Alexandria, A second synod determined 
that Origen should be deprived of his standing as a presbyter. His 
condemnation was not recognised by the churches in Palestine, Arabia, 
Phoenicia, and Achaia. Origen settled in Caesaria where he shortly 
had a flourishing school that rivalled the one in Alexandria. The 
instruction which he imparted in all branches of knowledge was famous 
over all the Bast. 

In the year 2^0 the Decian persecution broke out and Origen was 
arrested and imprisoned. He survived these troubles and lived a few 
years longer with his friends, and died at Tyre in 2^4 A.D.. He was 
the father of the church’s science, and the founder of a theology 
that was brought up to perfection in the fourth and fifth centuries, 
and still retained the stamp of his genius when it disowned him in 
the sixth century. He lived at a time when the Christian communities 
enjoyed almost uninterrupted peace and held an acknowledged position

any other man to win the Old World to Christianity. His was an influence 
that has lasted through the centuries.

UNLIMITED POWER. 

0 God the rock of ages 
Who evermore hast been.... 

E.H, Bickersteh 1825-1906 

God moves in a mysterious way, 

His wonders to perform| 

W, Cowper from Olney Hymns 1731-1200. 

For Origen the Kingdom of God had its beginning before the conception of 
1 

time. Christ was in the beginning v/ith God as the logos. Origen asserted 
that it was to Christ as the Logos that God gave the command ” let there be light” 
and ”Let there be a firmament”, and.gave the injunctions with regard to those 
other creative acts which were performed* It was the Logos that carried out the 
creative acts of God, ” In the beginning was the Logos, and the logos was with 

p 

God and the Logos was God” 

The earth was without form and it was shaped. There was darkness and light 

came into being. There was empty space and it was filled. And the Almighty 

looked and he was well pleased with the work of his hands, for it was good 

and his words had called it into being. His hands were manifest in the Logos. 

Now if God gave the command, and the creatures were formed, who 
according to the spirit of prophecy, could he be that was able to carry 
out such commands of the Father, save him who, so to speak, is the 
living Logos and the Truth? 3 

Now, although it is the Logos who is described as carrying out the actual 
act of creation, still it is God who is the creator of all things. The World 

4 

is a creation of God, ”For if it perish, it will perish as being a work of God”

Know that the Lord, is God alone. 

He can create and he destroy. 

Milton 1608-1674 

Moreover, God made all things for the, sake of nan.- 1 ' 

For since the world was created in conformity with the will 
of providence, and God presided over the universe of things, 
it was necessary that the elements of the human race should 
at the commencement of its existence be placed under some 
protection of the higher powers,, so that there might be 
formed from the beginning a union of the divine nature with 
that of men.^ 

Origen points out that it was not without the help of God that men 
sought for themselves the means of protection against the wild beasts,3 
Thus all things were created for rational beings, and among 
rational beings you discover reason, f, the common possession of men, 
and of divine and heavenly beings, and perhaps of the supreme God 
himself, on account of which man is said to be created in the image 
of God, for the image of the supreme God is his reason 11 ^ Thus you 
find in Origen that creation was for a distinct purpose. The world 
was created for man who was in the image of God and thus endowed with 
reason, God is not for inordinate desires, or of error and disorder, 
but God is good, and his nature is just and upright. Moreover, 
because of the power and wisdom of God he is able to create an 
eternal soul, which he did in man.5 God is able to do anything. All 
is within his power, for ‘‘in our judgment God can do everything which 
it is possible for 'him to do without ceasing to be God, and good and wise."^

6 . Ibid Bk.V Ch.24. And that he is able to provide an eternal life for 
the soul we acknowledge; and that he possesses not only the ‘power 1 but 
the 'will 1 ...Let it not be declared, contrary to reason, that it is the 
will of God to declare that the grain of wheat is not immortal, but the 
stalk which springs from it, while the body which is sown in corruption 

is not, but that which is raised by him in incorruption.while in our 

judgment also God cannot do anything which is contrary to reason, or 
contrary to himself.

G-od. does not contradict himself and go contrary to his own nature, 1 

Moreover, the world was created in time for H it is our belief 

that this world was created and took its beginning at a certain time, 

and in conformity to the cycle of time decreed to all things, is to be 

destroyed on account of its corruption, 1,2 It would appear from this 

statement alone that Origen holds a very deterministic view of the 

world and creation, but such is not altogether the case, Free will, 

which is discussed in a further chapter, is emphasized in the theology 

of Origen, Origen raises the question a,s to what G-od was doing before 

the world was created, if it was created in time. His answer is that 

this world is not the first work of G-od for other worlds existed before 

this one came into existence, and it follows that there will be other 

worlds after this one comes to an end,3 

He further believes that Christ existed in the previous worlds, 

but suffered only in this one.^ There will be other ages to follow 

which will perhaps be the restitution of all things, when the whole 

universe vail come to a perfect termination. One thing is certain, 

it is a view of history that is not cyclic but advances to a definite 

end and a victorious conclusion. The end of history is not a decline, 

or a position that leaves it no further advanced than it was at the 

beginning, but a, completion of the creative purpose of G-od, 

Origen is not bound by idle speculation as to the worlds or 

ages which are to follow for he writes: 

There is no doubt however, that something more illustrious 
and excellent than this present world is pointed out by the

Saviour, at which He incites and encourages "believers to aim. 

But whether the world to which He desires to allude "be far 
separated and divided from this, either "by nature or 
situation or glory; or whether it be superior in glory and 
quality, but confined within the limits of this world (which 
seems to me more probable), is nevertheless uncertain, and 
in my opinion an unsuitable subject for human thought.! 

It is clear from the context of Origen*swork that his definition of 

1 world 1 was elastic, including the possibility of all that is 

contained in the universe and suggesting other areas in the same 

world in the then Unknown that existed beyond the oceans, or perhaps 

other planets visible in this -universe, etc..2 

One thing is however, certain. God is all powerful with control 

of the past as well as the present. His hand is ever there. 

The seasons come and go, the wheeling years roll into 
centuries, the centuries into ages, and every generation 
stands afresh before the Hand to ask the meaning of this 
Power that holds, upholds, and never speaks, and never 
loosens hold, enclosing all.3 

God is the one who is the ultimate cause, the Absolute Existence and 
Spiritual Being who stands over against all conditioned existences.^ 
God a,s the absolute cause, with self consciousness and will, is set 
forth as more living and more personal by Origen than by the gnostics5 
and the neo-Platonists. The great distinctive chanacteristic of God 
is His creative activity. God is absolute goodness and supreme will. 
Being supreme, God does only what He wills to do, and therefore does 
not act contrary to Himself in subordination to any other power.6 

Karl Barth somewhat echoes Origen on the power of God when he 
says that the acknowledgment of God as creator also involves 
acknowledgment of the relationship between God and the world, in

which God has absolute primacy.3- Heaven and earth are not themselves 
God, Therefore they have a beginning in time and in space. He agrees 
fully with Origen when he speaks of creation by the Word, which is 
indeed the eternal Son, the Logos, although Origen would not say as 
Barth has done, that it is God himself. Therefore because God is 
the creator of the world it stands under His sovereignty. He has 
free lordship in the world that he created,2 accompanies and 

rules the world in whole and in part, according to his divine will 
and pleasure, without even partly abolishing the freedom of the 
human will. 

Almighty sovereign, Ruler of Thy own creation, Thou God of 
all, behold Thy world and see, and there in the midst is a 
corruption, and yet all is not lost. Thy will is to be done and 
the evil shall become good for light is replacing the darkness, and 
Thy hand is repairing the damage wrought by a will that is not Thine 
own.

PURPOSET’UL CONTROL 


His purposes will ripen fast, 

Unfolding every hour; 

The hud may have a hitter taste, 

Hut sweet will he the flower. 

Blind unbelief is sure to err, 

And scan his work in vain; 

Cod is his own interpreter, 

And he will make it plain. 

W. Cowper Olney Hymns 

Light Shining out of Darkness. 

A. 0. Wood writes that apart from Christianity it is difficult 
to discover any meaning in history, for it was Christianity that first 
gave men a sense of unity and purpose in the order of the world .^ 
History for Origen is the development and revelation of God. This 
idea was opposed to the current Greek thought of history as a cyclic 
affair, described by Plat©2 a s a continuous series of deluges which 
destroy civilisations which are then built up again to great heights 
when one again a deluge descends upon them and they begin over again. 
Origen spoke with contempt of the foolish position of those who 
believed that other worlds similar to our own will come into 
existence3 in which the whole cycle of history is again enacted. He 
criticizes it on the basis that if the cyclic theory be true then free 
will is annihilated,^ 

for the same events must perpetually occur in the past, 
present, and future according to the appointed cycles, it 
is clear that of necessity, Socrates will always be a 
philosopher, and be condemned for introducing strange gods 
and for corrupting the youth. And Anytils and Melitus must 
always be his accusers, and the council of the Areopagus 
must ever condemn him to death by hemlock.5

History is directed "by God t If he made the world for a purpose 
then he has control in order that his purpose might he carried out. 

He writes, “Indeed I have shown in the preceding pages that all things 
were created for man, and every rational being and that it was chiefly 
for the sake of the rational creature that the creation took place. 1 2 3 4 '! 
Then he follows up this statement by saying that God will never 
abandon the universe, for he has made arrangements to purify it and 
bring it back to the whole.2 This world as God’s world must be 
complete and perfect in all things. Thus if the world is to be 
brought back to a state of perfection from the corruption that has 
made it imperfect then it is clear that God must have a control of 
world history in order that corrective punishment be inflicted; and 
that he might have power to speak and direct, first through his 
servants the prophets, and finally through his Son Jesus Christ who 
was a culminating point in the history of the return of the world to 
God and the salvation of mankind that was created with reason and free 
will and was like unto the being of God himself.3 

God does not need to continually emend his work*^ G-od, having 
created the world perfect, is concerned with his creation, and in the 
welfare of rational man who was given the power to choose his own way. 
“It is not as a man who has imperfectly designed some piece of 
workmanship that God ailministers correction to the world, in 
purifying it by a flood or a conflagration, but in order to prevent 
the tide of evil rising to a greater height.“5 God only allown evil

to go so far before he intervenes in order to see that his final 
purpose is accomplished. Origen was certain that nothing could 
interfere with the ultimate plan of God for the world TAhich was to 
culminate in the coming of the City of our God and the Heavenly 

J erusalem.3- 

Nothing has been neglected by God, or will be neglected by 
God; for he does at each particular juncture what it 
becomes Him to do in a perverted and changed world. And as 
a husbandman performs different acts of husbandry upon the 
soil and its productions, according to the varying seasons 
of the year, so God administers entire ages of time, as if 
they were so to speak, so many individual years, performing 
during each one of them what is requisite with a reasonable 
regard to the care of the world; and this, as it is truly 
understood by God alone so also is it accomplished by him,^ 

This statement of Origen 1 2 3 4 5 6 scompletely sums up his position as to 

the relationship between God and history, "The earth is the Lord’s 

and the fulness thereof; the world and they that dwell therein. ,f 3 

"Let them know that God nileth to the ends of the earth.If God 

thus rules, there is purpose in his rule, and the world will not come 

to nought, 

God rules the world in accordance with his nature. He does not 

do things that are contrary to good,5 This he emphasizes in speaking 

to the people who say "All things are possible to God." 

God cannot do things that are disgraceful nor does He wish 
to do things that are contrary to His nature; nor if you 
desired anything evil would God accomplish it, Nor God 
does not rule the world in order to satisfy inordinate 
desires, or to allow disorder and confusion, but to govern 
a nature that is upright and just,6

Thus there is one God who created and arranged all things.! He 
was the G-od of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and the patriarchs, Moses 
and the Prophets, He sent Jesus Christ first to call Israel to himself, 
and then to offer salvation to the G-entiles after the unfaithfulness 
of the people of Israel.2 The Jews were chosen to bring light to the 
world, but they themselves went into darkness and rejected Jesus the 
Lord.3 

G-od fought for the Jex^ish nation as long as it obeyed His will. 

He has also miraculously preserved the Christian church in the fac& 
of all persecution. If the Homans were persuaded to adopt the principles 
of the Christians the Lord would fight for them as he fought for the 
Christians of old, and the Jews before them, Origen believed that 
they would be guarded by a divine power to the extent that war would 
not come against them, because ’'G-od would fight for them."4 

It is the purpose of G-od that men are to be selected for 
salvation. Jesus came to "rescue us from the evil \tforld" 5 For the 
law has gone forth to settle among all the nations of the earth, and 
the Lord \<rill judge in the midst of the heathen* & They are to become 
the children of peace and to receive a law from Him, a Superintendent 
and Teacher who regulates the whole world by his Teaching.? G-od is 
Lord over the whole earth which he will save for his purpose from the 
evil that corrupts it. "The King will not be left in solitude and 
desertion, neither will the affairs of the x^orld fall into the hands

of the most wild and impious barbarians,When they yield 
obedience to the Word of God, which Origen is confident they will 
do, they will become obedient to the law; and the religion of 
Christ will alone prevail indeed it will one day triumph, as its 
principles take possession of the minds of men more and more every 
day. * 2 3 


0 God, I saw Thee push back the black bolts back today and 
set a jar the ga,tes of Dawn, and the Spirit of Morning 
coming through at once was everyi^here. The golden torrent 
of her hair she shook wide and free and lightly tiptoed 
up the sky, while all her trailing skirts spread glory; 
she blew a whisper through the woodland and it broke in 
song; she glanced along the streams and they mirrored 
Heaven; she ran across the lav/ns, through gardens enamel 
petalled and aroma drunk. They stood unutterably rich and 
still, as if their soul had come. Glorious God, I saw Thy 
morning, and it seemed like resurrection to a life once 
dead in trespasses and sins,3

CHAPTEH XIV 

FORETOLD FULFILLMENT 

All earthly delights are sweeter in 
expectation than in enjoyment: hut all 
spiritual pleasures more in fruition 
than in expectation. Felham. 

God, having in his hand the destiny of the world, and having 
complete knowledge of all things, announced through His People that 
One was to come who would he the King of all, and He would rule a 
kingdom that was i\ r ithout end. "He shall bring forth judgment unto 
truth;"He shall he a light unto the Gentiles and salvation to 
the ends of the earth."2 

The prophets beforehand foretold of Him3 t saying that princes 
should not cease from Judah until He should come for whom the 
Kingdom had been reserved. Moreover, Jesus Christ came announced 
beforehand, not by one prophet but by raany.^ it was not by chance 
that the prophets foretold so man?/ details of the life of Christ.5 
The Jewish prophets predicted the birthplace of Him who was to be 
"the ruler of those who had lived righteous lives, and who are 
c?31ed the heritage of God."6 They declared that "Emmanuel should 
be conceived by a virgin; and that such signs and wonders should 
be performed by Hinrwho was the subject of prophesy. "7 The prophets 
also foretold of his suffering and death, and his resurrection. 

They thought their announcements being worthy of being committed to 
writing that future generations might recognize the signs and know

that they spoke the truth.1 Origen emphasizes the fact that it was 
not by chance that the Jewish nation had so many prophets at 
different ages that foretold and made known events which were of 
"far greater importance in themselves" than any other events of his 
own nation or any other.2 

One of the main arguments of Origen for the truth of 
Christianity is on the prophetic word that was fulfilled, and it 
has greater emphasis in that these prophesies were not of one age 
but of many generations. The argument from history is always a 
very strong and convincing one. 

Barth agrees with Origen when he writes: "The faithfulness 
of God is established when we meet the Christ in Jesus."3 Christ 
is the fulfillment of the Law and the prophets. To Origen it was 
quite clear that you had prophecy on the one hand and fulfillment 
on the other. Alan Richardson echoes Origen when he says that the 
witness of the Old Testament to Christ is hardly less clear than 
the witness of the ITew,^ The Old Testament is revelation because 
it bears witness to Christ. This was the sole value of the Old 
Testament to the early church, and certainly it was the emphasis 
that Origen made. It was rich in Hypes* of Christ. It laid down 
God’s plan in the world, and so bore witness to Him who is Lord. 
Luther followed in that strain, for the books of the Old Testament 
that were of value in his opinion were those that bore witness to 
Christ.

Origen saw, as did the early church, how the deepest insights 
of the prophets had been fulfilled in Jesus Christ. It was in the 
Church's Lord that the long prophetic history of the people of Cod 
had been fulfilled." They were liberated from a bondage more terrible 
than Egypt's by the mighty deliverance He had wrought; "1 the Messiah 
had lead his flock into the promised land of the Kingdom and reign of 
God which the prophets had foretold; the New Covenant in the blood 
of Jesus was the fulfillment both of the Old Covenant of Moses and of 
Jeremiah'sprophecy of its renewal. The NewTemple not made with hands 
had been built. The New Law had been given and was now lived by 
faith. The light had lightened the Gentiles. 1 2 3 Every significant 
insight of the Hebrew scriptures had been fulfilled in Christ and 
the Church. The argument from prophecy has lost none of its apologetic 
power. Truth will stand and in the end win, Origen had built his 
argument on a sound basis. 

In addition to speaking through the prophets and revealing 
his plan to mankind Origen was positive that God also had revealed 
his plan to Christ, the Logos, in the beginning. Christ had 
foreknowledge of events.3 Modern theology tends to say that Christ 
only recognized the plan for his life in the prophets as he read 
them. Origen would say that Christ had knowledge of his destiny 
before the prophets. Both could be correct. On the subject of 
foreknowledge Origen is careful to point out that foreknowledge does 
not mean that because an event is foreknown it "will infallibly happen"

and it is impossible that it can he otherwise.3- Foreknowledge for 
Origen is knowing ahead of time what will occur if a certain course 
of action is followed. Origen uses for his example the matter of 
human intercourse as being necessary for the begetting of children. 
You foreknow what will likely occur from the action. Similarly, one 
is more likely to recover from an illness if a physician is caZled 
in than if the disease is allowed to run its o\m course. This is 
the nature of foreknowledge .2 

In connection with the power of foreknowing it is interesting 
to note that Origen did not regard it as a proof of divinity, for he 
says that we ought to take note "that the power of foreknowing the 
future is by no means a proof of divinity; for in its self it is a 
thing indifferent, and is found occuring ajnong both good and bad. w 
He uses for an example the physicians and pilots, who through their 
experiences Can foretell the course a disease is going to take, or 
the weather. Certainly it is not to be regarded in itself as a proof 
of divinity.3 The important item is that a man be purely wise and 
exceedingly pure. 

Men who are still in a state of wickedness, however great 
their progress in knowledge are far removed from that 
society (the Kingdom of God). It is then, those alone who 
are truly wise and sincerely religious who are nearer God ! s 
society; such persons as were our prophets.^ 

Christ had foreknowledge of the course of his life, “for He 

foreknew and foretold all that happened to him. M 5 Further, while

Jerusalem was still standing and the worship was being carried on 
in the Temple Christ foretold the coming seige and destruction of 
Jerusalem, and the persecution of all who were Christian. History- 
proved his foreknowledge to he correct.! 

Origen is well aware of an almost universal trait in human 
nature whereby they desire that men should speak well of them rather 
than evil. An individual would much sooner have a story told about 
him that is to his credit than one that is to his discredit. Using 
this fact, Origen then points out that if the disciples had devised 
the fiction of Christ’s foreknowledge they would not have included His 
sayings concerning their unfaithfulness on the night of his betrayal, 
especially of Peter's denying Him thrice.2' Therefore in Cod's plan 
for the destiny of the world and His rule Christ knew beforehand the 
plan that He should take, and being the Divine Logos, the Son of G-od, 
and fully endued with the Divine nature He would ndt act otherwi se. 
’’Behold my servant, whom I uphold, mine elect in whom my soul 
delightethi I have put my spirit upon him. ,f 3 

Many questions are raised with the Doctrine of the foreknowledge 
of Christ, and these Origen tries to meet as well as he can in a 
logical manner. The great question that the Pagan critics raised was 
that if Christ knew he was to die on a cross, why should he still 
continue on the load to Calvary. This objection Origen meets by a 
careful discussion of the meaning of the cross, and the necessity of

death in order to conquer death,1 Origen further states that 

if Jesus foreknew events as a God, then it was impossible 
for his foreknowledge to prove untrue; These things 
concerning Christ came to pass not only as being possible, 
but by the fact of their prediction are shorn to be true, 

"The truth regarding future events is judged of by result s,"2 

Thus in Christ's foreknowledge, and the truth of his predictions 

you see the hand of God in history; you become aware that creation is 

still in the process of being carried on, for the Kingdom of God is 

on the making, now is and will be. Thus it is that we see here 

"A power from an unknown God, 

A Promethean conqueror, came; 

Like a triumphal path he trod 
the thorns of death and shame."3

CHAPTER XV 

THE LOST BIRTHRIGHT 

Such place Eternal Justice had prepared 
For those rebellious; here their prison orgained 
In utter darkness, and their portion set, 

As far removed from G-od and light of Heaven 
As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole* 

J. Milton 

Bk.l Paradise Lost line JO 

The Jews were the chosen people of Cod* Their*s was a covenant 
relationship with Kim. He was their King and they were his people. 

They were to obey His laws and commandments; and the Lord their G-od 
would preserve them from all evil, and guard them from their enemies. 
However, the agreement was not kept. They worshipped other gods. 
Righteousness and truth were not theirs, and they were continually 
punished. Their sin was continual rebellion against God. However, 
the Eternal had mercy upon them, and he sent to them the prophets as 
his servants to announce to them the ways of the Lord, and to issue a 
call for repentence. The call went unheeded. The servants of the 
Lord suffered for their loyalty to their master. They were the 
servants that the Lord sent to his vineyard that the labourers beat 
and sent away empty.1 Then He sent his only Son, his heir and Him 
they slew. And what should the Lord do to the unfaithful workmen of 
the vineyard? 

Josephus in the eighteenth book of the Antiquities of the Jews 
suggests that the destruction of Jerusalem and the subsequent 
sufferings of the Jews were a result of their treatment of James the 
Just, who was a brother of Jesus called The Christ.2 Origen suggests

that it was actually because of the treatment accorded Christ by 

the Jews.l Further he points out that the whole Jewish nation was 

overthrown within one generation after the crucifixion of Christ. 

Never had the Jewish nation been expelled for so long a period from 

their temple worship at Jerusalem. 2 "The Jews have suffered on His 

account now for a lengthened time calamities of great severity."3 

The Jews brought upon themselves the Divine wrath. The city 

where Jesus suffered perished, the Jewish nation was overthrown, and 

the invitation to happiness that Cod offered them passed to others. 

To the gentiles came the doctrine of a pure and holy worship and the 

New Covenant written on the heart.^ Butterfield writes "Judgment 

comes upon orders and systems, and what is judged, of course, is not 

the individual, but the system as a whole,"5 Origen feels that the 

Jewish nation was judged as a whole for its great national sin of the 

rejection of salvation and the New Covenant.6 

Judgment in history falls heaviest on those who come to 
think themselves Cods, who fly in the face of providence 
and history, who put their trust in manmade systems and 
worship the work of their own hands, and who say that the 
strength of their own right arm gave them the victory.? 

This statement of Butterfield*s is but an echo of Origen*s 

suggestion that nothing belonging to human nature is permanent, and 

therefore those things that are of the human element must gradually

be corrupted and changed.^ As long as the Jews lived as a chosen 
nation, apart from the rest of the world, they enjoyed the protection 
of the Divine power. When it became necessary for them, $s a nation 
wholly given to sin, to be brought back by their sufferings to God, 
they were abandoned by Him, sometimes for a short period and sometimes 
for a longer period, ’’until in the time of the Romans having committed 
the greatest of sins in putting Jesus to death, they were completely 
deserted,"2 They trusted in their own power and systems. They chose 
their own ways and not Gods, and He spewed them out of his mouth. 

Their birthright was taken from them and given to another. They knew 
that the most high God ruled in the Kingdom of men,3 yet they heeded 
Him not knowing all this they humbled not their hearts, but lifted up 
themselves against the Lord of Heaven, and the God in whose hand their 
breath is have they not glorified. Therefore their heritage was taken 
from them, and another took their place. Through the sin of the Jews 
did salvation come to the Gentiles. Jesus foreknew that he would be 
rejected by his own people as was written of Him ”He is despised and 
rejected of men; a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and we 
hid as it were our faces from Him; he was despised and we esteemed 
him not. H Origen was certain that the Jews were punished even in 
their present life for their rejection of the Messiah, and he was 
positive that it was as written in II Samuel, 'A people whom I did not

know became subject to me: n l The transgression of the people was 
used for the calling in of the Kingdom of God,^ 

n And these things were foretold by the prophets, who said that 
on account of the transgressions of the Hebrew nation, God would make 
choice, not of a nation, but of individuals chosen from all lands. n 3 
Peoples and nations who were completely alien to the Hebrew God would 
be called in to share in the Kingdom of the Messiah, and become 
inheritors of the promises. This thought impressed Origen, and it can 
be traced throughout the. whole of his writings. There is a profound 
gratitude to God that they who were not of the chosen nation should be 
called to become heirs of His promises. Moreover, this was known 
beforetime and it could be said that it was through the transgress! ons 
of the Jews that the Christian religion went to the Gentiles with its 
saving message. It is here that Origen comes very close to 
predestination, but it is his belief in complete free will that keeps 

I.4: 

him from coming all the way end making the statement that it was 
decided aforetime that the Gentiles should be brought to salvation 
through the transgressions of the Jews, 

The soul has a natural love for its creator,4 Because of its 
affection towards Him the soul also receives Him who presented these 
truths to all nations “through the disciples whom he appointed, and 
whom He sent forth, furnished with Divine power and authority to 
proclaim the doctrine regarding God and his kingdom, fl 5 The Kingdom of 
God was the burden of the proclamation of Christ and the framework of 
all his teaching.^ This was the message to the world.

CHAPTER XVI 

THE CELESTIAL CITY 
ON THE TERRE ST IAL PLAIN 


A fairer Paradise is founded now 
For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou, 

A Saviour, art come down to reinstall; 

Where they shall dwell secure. 

J. Milton 

Paradise Regained Bk.4. 

G-od had given the world a saviour in his Son Jesus Christ. 

Origen felt that the church was a, society that was apart from the 

world. Here was the kingdom of which Christ spoke. He was their 

King, and their Saviour. When they stood firm in periods of 

persecution they were only obeying their Lord and their King. Christ 

was the head, and the church was the body. 

We say that the Holy Scriptures declare the body of Christ, 
animated by the Son of God, to be the whole Church of God, 
and the members of this body considered as a whole to 
consist of those who a.re believers; since, as a soul 
vivifies and moves the body, which of itself has not the 
natural power of motion like a living being, so the Word, 
arousing and moving the whole body, the Church to 
befitting action, awakens moreover, each individual member 
belonging to the church, so that they do nothing apart from 
the word.l 

For Origen, the church is where Christ is. Brunner agrees with 
Origen when he speaks of the church as the "Community of Faith," and 
writes "The ultimate end, that is, the Kingdom of G-od, begins in 
this community, in the church.** 1 2 Truly, the church can only be 
understood in the light of the end. The Kingdom is coming, and those 
that are in the church a.s believers are already established in that

Kingdom* The church is called of God into being. The soul of 

Christ moves the church, and the Word of G-od is active in the church. 

This is the beginning of the Kingdom of God. 

Since Christ is the Head of the Church, so that Christ and the 

church form one bodyl, his spirit is throughout the church, and every 

member of the Church has Christ in Him. The church is formed by man’s 

believing response to the call of G-od. There G-od’s hand ha,s seized 

the individual and he has come into communion with G-od. Through faith 

the individual is united with God and his fellow man. God has not 

deserted his people, but has become one with them. 

”To the Christian Jesus Christ is an all sufficient Lord, who 

Himself instructs them, in order that, when fully instructed he may 

form them into a Kingdom worthy of God and present them to God the 

Father. 11 ^ Moreover they are called upon to separate themselves from 

those %*ho are not members of the n commonwealth of God.” This they do 

that they may live as citizens of Heaven.3 

coming to the living God, and to the City of God, the 
heavenly Jerusalem, and to an intunerable company of 
angels, to the general assembly and church of the first¬ 
born, which are written in Heaven, 

Thus in living as citizens of Heaven they are also members of the 

Church on earth. Origen does not seem to separate the Kingdom of 

Heaven from the Kingdom of God. While on earth, and as believing 

Christians, they are members of the Heavenly Kingdom. The church is 

the beginning of the eternal order. Here it is that they serve their 

one Lord and Master.

The church is a state within a state, and in a case of 
conflict between the laws of the two states, the laws of The 
Kingdom of Heaven have priority over the laws of the land. The 
church is indeed the society of the elect on this earth. 

The church of G-od desires to please God in all things.^* 

Even in their ecclesiastical government the church is more orderly 
than that of the state. To support his point Origen cites the 
conduct of the governments of various cities, including such as 
Athens, Corinth Alexandria, etc. The city governments are often 
disorderly whereas the government of the church is marked by order, 
for they are a Heavenly society. 

Thus in his day Origen was able to point to the rulers of the 
church and use them as an example of a superior type of official 
compared to the average ruler of the state. And he felt that they 
ought so to be, for they were indeed rulers in the Church of God, 
and "are worthy to rule in the City of G-od".2 

The church is the dwelling place of G-od, and is his temple. 

He speaks of the temple composed of the "living and precious stones," 
which is to take the place of any earthly temple.3 Here you see a 
picture of the church of faith which is the dwelling place of the 
most high God, a living temple composed of believers. This is the 
Kingdom of G-od, and a place wherein G-od delighteth to dwell. The 
believers are living stones, and a holy priesthood, offering up

Spiritual sacrifices. The Kingdom is established in righteousness, 

Here in the Kingdom, the church, the individual and the community 
are so related that they cannot be separated from one another. The 
church for Origen is the Divinely created order of community; a 
community of the redeemed, directed to the Kingdom of God that is 
celestial and everlasting. Here the Christian is a member of the 
body of Christ. This is also the viewpoint held by Brunner. 2 although 
Brunner would carry this conception of the church a little farther 
than perhaps Origen is willing to do. For Origen, the church is a 
society united in fellowship through a common belief in Christ, and 
his Saving grace. Theirs was a practical community, operated by men 
who were expecting the end of the age to come shortly; they were a 
Heavenly society on the terrestial plain. You were in the church as a 
believer, and not as a matter of convenience. However, Origen was 
aware that the church on earth was not perfect, being composed of 
human beings who were creatures of sin, and he looked forward to the 
day of the coming of the end of time, and the spiritual church in 
Heaven composed of saints and martyrs, and angels,3 

Individuals have free will. This freedom of the will is used 
to decide whether or not they will heed the call of G-od. Origen 
believed in foreknowledge, but he was very careful to explain the 
complete freedom of the will in all things, Augustine, on the other 
hand, who also believed in foreknowledge developed his doctrine of 
the will to the extent that it meant predestination, for Origen 
people have the choice of listening to the Word of G-od, or rejecting

it, God only desires that we should understand and consider his 
pre-eminence,1 In coming to know God, then we will have that 
blessedness that comes from knowledge of Him, 2 This is brought to 
pass through Christ and his indwelling word, which we are free to 
accept or reject, 

Origen was anxious to make it quite clear that individuals 

do not enter the church against their will, God speaks to them, and 

it is only when they respond with faith that they enter in. 

That invisible and rational nature changes in mind and 
purpose because it is endowed with freedom of the will, 
and is found in this account sometimes to be engaged in 
the practise of good, and sometimes in that of the 
opposite,3 

But whether any of these orders who act under the 
government of the devil, and obey his wicked commands, 
will in a future world be converted to righteousness 
because of their possessing the faculty of freedom of 
will, or whether persistent wickedness may be changed 
by the power of habit into nature..,remains to be seen, 1 ^ 

Prom the context of both the above statement, freedom of the will 

is emphasised, and it is intimated that if the right choice of the 

will is not made in this world for the Kingdom of God, it may be 

made through the exercise of the free will in future worlds, Origen 

suggests that all eventually will be saved, for through punishment 

and perversity they will be brought to see the truth and to the right 

choice. Moreover, through the coming of Christ and the doctrines of 

Christianity He improves, not those who are unwilling but those who 

have chosen the better life, and that which is pleading to God,5

God has implanted the love of truth within the human soul.^- 

Therefore man desires and longs to know the truth. When we see 

the truth, through this quality that is implanted within our souls, 

we should desire it, and in desiring it we'will' it. 

Now we have received this desire from God, not in order 
that it should never he gratified or he capable of 
gratification; otherwise the love of truth would appear 
to have been planted by God into our minds to no purpose, 
if it never i^ere to have an opportunity of satisfaction,^ 

However, he goes on to say that all revelation must be gradual, and 

must be willingly received. Hence, even the future life is one of 

progress through experience, through the free exercise of the will. 

For Origen, the church on the earth which was the beginning of the 

Kingdom of God was not by my means perfect, but was marked by the 

free choice of its members for greater Knowledge of God, which they 

had through the revelation of Jesus Christ, It was a community 

composed of sinners, seeking salvation and a better life, "The truth 

shall make you free". The church is not based on the fact of creation, 

but of redemption. As faith itself is not perfection, bat is only 

the certainty of the coming perfection, so also, as Brunner puts it, 

"does the Church transcend itself and reaches out towards that which 

is beyond itself,"3

CHAPTER XVII 


PROM GENERATION TO GENERATION 

Thy Kingdom is an everlasting Kingdom 
and Thy Dominion endureth throughout all 
generations. 

Ps 145:13 

There is a suggestion in Origen that the Kingdom of God 
actually began before the advent of Christ. However, in discussing 
this aspect of the Kingdom for Origen it has to be noted that the 
Kingdom in full realization, that is, a Kingdom for both Jew and 
Gentile united in the fellowship of the knowledge and love of God, 
began with Christ himself. In Christ all the hopes and ideals of 
the past met and blended.1 

The Kingdom of God was foreshadowed in the Jewish state. There 

Yahweh was King over his people. H Both Judea and Jerusalem were the 

shadow and figure of that pure land, goodly and large, in the pure 

region of Heaven, in which is the heavenly Jerusalem. Jewish 

state, when it existed, was a symbol of the City of God.3 The Jews, 

despite the fact that they were a people that rejected God had 

nevertheless a representation of the Kingdom of God in their being 

or existence. Origen points out at length that their manner of living 

was different from that of all the nations around them, because of 

their peculiar relation to God. 

now we have in the preceding pages already spoken in part of

among mortals, everything that was not of advantage to 
the human race was withheld from them, and only those 
things which are useful bestowed. And for this reason 
they had neither gymnastic contests,....nor women who 
sold their beauty to any one who wished to have sexual 

intercourse with them without offence.And how great 

an. advantage they enjoyed in being instructed almost from 

their birth,.And I consider that it was in a manner 

worthy of their name as the ‘portion of God' that they 
despised all kinds of divina.tion.1 

They only came to know the future throxigh those that had received 

the spirit of the supreme God.2 These men foretold the coming of the 

fuller Kingdom of God. Moreover, the Kingdom was not to be visualised 

as being an earthly kingdom, but a kingdom of the heart.3 “Ye are come 

unto Mount Zion and the city of the living God; the Heavenly Jerusalem, 

and to an inumerable company of angels.Origen in speaking to the 

pagans about the world which they regarded only “as a stage for human 

actors, with or without superhuman backers“5 reveals it to them in 

the Christian setting of history which regards it as “a field for the 

progressive realization of the Kingdom of God."6 

The Jews at first regarded the Kingdom of God as their own 

earthly realm, the land of Canaan that the lord their God gave to them 

for an inheritance. With the prophets you obtain further revelations 

of the Kingdom of God. Deutero Isaiah viewed the Kingdom of God 

almost as an 

Achaemenian Empire in which his saviour hero Cyrus has 
taken Jerusalem instead of Susan as his capital and the 
Jews instead of the Persians as his ruling race because

Yahweh has revealed to him that it is He and not 
Ahuramazda who has enabled Cyrus to conquer the World 

The Kingdom of &od was hut an earthly paradise, a new garden 

of Eden. Men and women were going to he ruled by the law of God in 

their hearts (Jeremiah) hut it was essentially an earthly kingdom. 

Origen maintains that the prophets were speaking of the heavenly 

Kingdom, hut were misinterpreted by the Jewish people themselves. 

He goes on to indicate, to his satisfaction, from their prophecies 

that they could not have been referring to the land of Judah, for it, 

too, was included in the cursing of the earth because of Adam’s sin 

of rebellion against G-od. 2 

God has perpetually show, himself to the Jewish nation, and in 

so doing has given witness to Jesus Christ. Origen then suggests that 

as Christ was with God in the beginning so He too has perpetually 

shovn himself to men, first through their prophecies and then to his 

disciples.3 In one sense Christ continually reveals himself to his 

followers. In writing against Celsus, and in answer to the question 

“Where now is he that we may see Him and believe Him,” Origen writes; 

we answer; Where is He now who spoke in the prophecies, 
and v/ho wrought miracles, that we may see and believe that 
He is part of God? Are you to be allowed to meet the 
objection, that God does not perpetually show himself to 
the Hebrew nation, while we are not to be permitted the 
same defence with regard to Jesus, who has both once 
risen Himself, and led his disciples to believe in His 
resurrection, and so thoroughly pursuaded them of its 
truth that they show to all men by their sufferings how 
they are able to laugh at all the troubles of life, 
beholding the life eternal and. the resurrection clearly 
demonstrated to them both in Word and deed.** 

It is clear by this that by continual revelation Origen does not

mean that Christ demonstrates his existence to men by showing himself 

to them in the material form, or even by speaking to them. His 

continual revelation is in the form of being ’in* his followers. 

How, if any one were to soy that, through those who are 
partakers of the •Word 1 2 of God, or of His ‘Wisdom*, or 
His 'Truth 1 ', or His 'Life', the Word and Wisdom itself 
appeared to be contained in a place, we should have to 
say to him in .answer, that there is no doubt that Christ, 
in respect to being the 'Word' or 'Wisdom', or all other 
things, was in P?uL, and that he therefore said, 'Do you 
seek aproof of Christ speaking in me?' (11 Cor,13:3) 

Seeing, then. He was in Paul, who will doubt that He was 
in a similar manner in Peter and John, and in each one of 
the saints; and not only in those who are upon the earth, 
but in those also who are in Heaven?^ 

This is the proof of the existence of Christ, and together with the 

evidence of the work of God in creation through the Logos, which was 

the Son, and through the prophetic Word, Christ has revealed himself 

from generation to generation. The Creation of the world, and the 

Divine Word in the prophets, culminated and achieved fulfillment in 

the advent of Christ Himself on earth. Here is the Kingdom that has 

been building throughout all generations. This is the upholding power 

of God; and His Kingdom is indeed from everlasting to everlasting, 

and his dominion from generation to generation*^

CHAPTER ay 111 

THE TWELVE GATES 


How, just as the gates were opened to 
let in the men, I looked in after them, 
and behold, the city shone like the sun. 

John Bunyan Pilgrim 1 2 s Progress 
Chapt. on "The Celestial City." 

Origen was not a determinist in the full sense of the word. 

Mankind was not already condemned to either salvation or eternal 

punishment. Heaven was not just one phase in the future, but several. 

He writes that there are likely numerous ages in the future as there 

were in the past ,3- Moreover, the religious experience that leads an 

individual to salvation is not defined as having to be one particular 

type of experience. The Kingdom of God is broad in its scope, having 

not one, but twelve gates into the Celestial City. 

If one wished to obtain means for a profounder contemplation 
of the entrance of the souls into divine things.....let him 
peruse, at the end of Ezekial's prophecies, the visions 
beheld by the prophet in which gates of different kinds are 
enumerated, which obscurely refer to the different modes in 
which divine souls enter into a better world; and let him 
peruse also, from the Apocalypse of John, what is related 
of the City of God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and of its 
foundations and gates.2 

Origen would indeed say that Plato, one of the most enlightened 
men of his day, found one of the gates into the City of God. The 
heavenly realm, and the Kingdom of God is composed of believers. To 
believe is an individual matter of the will. It is not a corporate 
affair, nor is salvation for any nation or group. God made a choice.

not of a nation but of individuals chosen from all lands.1 The 

peoples of the world were to be made accpainted with the divine 

teaching, and to them was to be given the Kingdom of God.2 The j ews 

originally had been chosen as a nation with God a,s their King. They 

had rejected him, and in their rejection God turned, not to another 

nation, but to the individual people of the world. The Kingdom of 

God was taken from the one and given to the other.3 

To find entrance into the City you only had to be willing to 

receive the Gospel of Christ. This Word is the key that unlocks the 

way. In discussing this matter Origen writes; 

And therefore there was no need that there should anywhere 
exist many bodies, and many spirits like Jesus, in order 
that the whole world of men might be enlightened by the 
Word of God. For the one Word was enough, having arisen 
as the ’Sun of righteousness*, to send forth from Judea 
His coming rays into the soul of all who were willing to 
receive Him* 4 

Christ brought into light the whole of the Jewish scriptures, and 
revealed to mankind the mysteries of the Kingdom of God. This was 
proclaimed to all nations and all men that they might make the choice 
by the exercise of their own free wills and enter into the Kingdom of 
God. 5 


Here we find that Origen defines the Church of God to be the 
body of Christ, and the Kingdom of God on earth which is composed of 
believers. Being believers these individuals are activated by the 
spirit of Christ, and hence they will not act in a manner that is 
contrary to the given Word. "They do nothing apart from the Word."6

Again we find that the emphasis is laid on the individual. It is 
he, and not the group asawhole that is activated by the Word of 
God. The Word of God is not contradictory and therefore these 
individuals do not act against one another hut act in unity a,s the 
body of Christ. 

There are twelve gates into the city of God, but there is only 

one road, and that road is faith. All human things are dependent upon 

faith, therefore in order to be a citizen of the Kingdom, the 

individual must have faith in God.l Thus Christ only appears and 

speaks to those who are able to hear and see This is possible only 

through the power of faith.^ 

For the Divine voice is of such a nature as to be heard 

only by those whom the speaker wishes to hear.He 

that has the finer ear hears the voice of God, while he 
who has the ears of his soul deadened does not perceive 
that it is God who speaks.3 

Only the man with faith is able to hear the voice of God, 

The Christian submits to God in all that he does. Submitting 
to God as his King the Christian is in ttirn protected by God. u The 
Christian will suffer nothing for 'the angel of the Lord will encamp 
about them that fear Him, and will deliver them. 1 Demons and evil 
angels can do no harm to those who have chosen God, for He will 
protect them ftow' all. Their efforts will come to nought against 
God and His people ,5 

The Kingdom is for all men. It is to be a universal Kingdom, 
and none are denied admission that desire it. Celsus, in speaking

against the Christians charged that they were such an exclusive 

group that "if all men wanted to become Christians they would not 

allow it."l Origen then writes that the Christians are eager that 

all come into the Kingdom. This is witnessed to by the activity 

of the Christians among their pagan brethern. The Christians invite 

all men to be healed, and "exhort those who are sinners to come to 

the consideration of the doctrines which teach men not to sin "2 that 

they may have the blessedness that comes from God. The Christians 

desire that all men accept their doctrines which will lead to live 

better lives. The wicked, sinners, the criminal, all these are 

invited to come to Christ and be healed.3 Their is no limitation 

whatsoever on those that are invited to come into the Kingdom of God, 

accepting Him as their King and Lord. 

All men, therefore, laboring and being heavy laden because 
of the nature of sin, are invited to the rest spoken of in 
the word of God, for God sent His word, and healed them, 
and delivered them from their destructions.^ - 

Hot only the worst sinners are invited to repent and change their 

ways, but also those who are respectable citizens of the world, and 

are not leading very wicked lives. They, too, are invited to come 

in that they might have a better life *5 

Jesus endured all things on behalf of sinners that He might 

free them from sin and convert them to righteousness. 6 q. 0 ^ loves 

all things. The earth is full of the mercy of the Lord.7 God is 

anxious that all the world be saved, and not only those who are

believers, but all men. 

For He himself is said to be the Saviour of all men, 
especially of them that believe; and His Christ to be 
the 'propitiation for our sins and not for ours only, 
but also for the sins of the whole world,1 

Christ is declared to have come for the sake of sinners in all parts 

of the world, ’:.hat they might forsake their sins and entrust themselves 

to God, Itv&s inconceivable to Origen that anyone should be left 

outside of the Kingdom of God, If they didn't make a decision for 

God in this life they had the opportunity to do so in the life to come. 

Punishment was not for damnation, but for redemption,2 Jt was impossible 

for anyone to withstand the love of God which is all powerful. 

C, Rust speaks of the power of love in the Church and 

Kingdom, It is redemption by the love of God in Christ out of this 

present world in the Kingdom of God, This love is the divine life of 

the church, and is all inclusive. This community is composed of an 

elect people, called by God in love through Christ Jesus. Origen 

interpreted this love to be universal for all mankind. Man was to 

enter into that new relationship with God, that was intended for him 

from the beginning. Here was man, created a little lower than the 

angels, brought into union with God through Christ, 

Behold, here is the City of God with tx^elve gates, for each 

one enters in his own way, through his own gate. Yet there is only 

one road, and that is the road of faith that leads to belief in Jesus 

Christ and his Gospel, and this is the faith that leads man to live 

that better life that is in conformity with the will of God. Behold 

the city, gleaming in the distance with its twelve gates, and see

CHAPTER XIX 


PARADISE OP PEACE 

0 human spirit I spur thee to the goal 
Where virtue fixes universal peace, 

And 'midst the ehb and flow of human things, 

Show somewhat stable, somewhat certain still, 

A lighthouse o' er the wild of dreary waves. 

Shelly - Qpeen Mab Sect. VIII 1. 
line 54. 

Those who have found Jesus Christ to be real, and have a deep 
faith in him find that although they are in the world they actually 
have their citizenship in Heaven. They find that Christ is an all 
sufficient Lord and Master, and through him they are instructed in 
their knowledge of God and things heavenly that they might assume 
their citizenship in the Heavenly Kingdom*^ Through Christ were they 
made worthy of citizenship, and through Christ they obtained their 
qualifications for membership in the Celestial Kingdom. 

However, citizenship does not absolve them from their duties 
in the earthly states. Earth is a testing ground of character and 
qualification. If they are able to live a Christian life on this 
earth and do the small tasks well, then are they worthy to be given 
greater responsibility in the Heavenly realm.2 Thus they are 
promoted to a divine and heavenly city, where, having been faithful 
in small.things they are now initiated into those things that are great.3 

Having citizenship in Heaven, the laws of the new'Kingdom are 
above those of the kingdoms of this earth* Thus, although they are to 
obey the laws of the land, if ever there should occur a situation 
where the law of the land requires them to act contrary to the will

of G-od, the will of God is to be obeyed. In standing by God they 

will find that G-od ivill stand by them. 

Those things that are invisible are those things that are 

perfect and enduring. Origen maintained that in the realm above 

were the genuine values of life. The things in this earth were but 

imperfect imitations of those above. 

The writings of Moses and the prophets - the most ancient 
of all books - teach us that all things here on earth which 
are in common use among men, have other things corresponding 
to them in name which are alone real. Thus* for instance, 
there is the true light, and another heaven beyond the 
firmament, and a sun of righteousness other than the sun we 
see. In a word, to distinguish those things from the objects 
of sense, which have no true reality, they say of G-od that 
•His works are truth 1 2 3 ; thus making a. distinction between 
the works of God and the works of God’s hands, which latter 
are of an inferior sort.l 

Thus the work in this life is but preparation for that above. Through 
Christ men are continually growing in the knowledge of G-od. The 
saints of God will eat of the bread of life and nourish the soul with 
the food of truth and wisdom.2 They will enlighten the mind and drink 
of the cup of Divine wisdom. 

3y this food of wisdom, the understanding, being nourished to 
an entire and perfect condition like that in which man was 
made at the beginning is restored to the image and likeness 
of God; so that although an individual may depart from this 
life less perfectly instructed, but who has done works that 
are approved of, he will be capable of receiving instruction 
in that Jerusalem, the city of the saints. He will he 
, educated and moulded, and made a living stone, a stone elect 
and previous, because he has undergone with firmness and 
constancy the struggles of life and the trials of piety; and 
will there come to a truer and clearer knowledge of that which 
has already heen predicted, that ’man shall not live by bread 
along, but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God.3

For Origen, being a citizen of the Heavenly Kingdom not only involved 
growth in knowledge on this plain, but growth in the Heavenly city 
above. Death does not remove the believer from one realm to the other, 
but merely makes possible a fuller fellowship in the New Jerusalem. 

Some advance further in the knowledge of (rod than others, and as their 
knowledge increases so too do they receive higher instruction until 
the day comes when they are perfect in every work, even as Christ 
Himself was perfect. 

For Origen there is more than one Heaven. He condemns those 
who maintain there are seven heavens, or any definite number at all 
for the reason that this is knowledge that is at present withheld from 
men. However, he suggests that the prophets and gjostles did teach the 
existence of several heavens of spheres. In this realm of thought he 
is in agreement with Plato, and comments that it is ouite likely that 
Plato had some truths in mind when he propounded such a theory. He 
also adds that "on this subject Philo has composed a treatise which 
deserves the thoughtful and intelligent investigation of all lovers 
of the truth." 

In his work De Principiis he is even more definite on this 
subject. He states that on earth we see many things which we do not 
understand. We see the great diversities between living things, the 
differences in men, and we fail to know the reason why. In 
speculating on the subject he thinks that it may be that when death 
takes place we will be informed on these subjects, and comprehend 
with full understanding those things that we understood not in the 
earthly realm.1 He writes; 

I think therefore, that all the saints who depart from tins 

life will remain in some place situated on this earth, which 

Holy Scripture calls Paradise, as in some place of instruction, and,

so to speak, class-room or school of souls, in which 
they are to he instructed regarding all the things which 
they had seen on earth, and are to receive also some 
instruction respecting things that are to follow in the 
future, as even when in this life they had obtained in 
some degree indications of future events, although 1 through 
a glass darkly', all of which are revealed m ' ^ ” and 



distinctly to the saints in the proper time 


Some who are "pure in heart," and "holy in mind" will make more rapid 
progress and reach the kingdom of Heaven. Origen feels that the many 
mansi ons of which Christ spoke are hut the spheres of the Creeks and 
the heavens of the Hew Testament. One will pass through these in 
gradations, as a living soul clothed with a spiritual body, and not 
in the circumscribed body which man occupies on earth.2 jt is clear 
that Origen thought of an ascension through the air to some other 
planet. However, he was limited by the scientific knowledge of the 
world and the universe of that age. It is a matter of conjecture 
whether he would have so described it had he known more about the 
universe and the structure of the earth. Then again it is also clear 
that the theory behind his thought is still conceivable in the 
modern world, and has indeed been expressed by certain groups, 
particularly the Theosophists with regard to future life on other 
realms. 

He further writes: 

When the saints shall have reached the celestial abodes, 
they will clearly see the nature of the stars one by one, 
and will understand whether they a,re endued with life, or 
their condition, whatever it is. And they will comprehend 
also the other reasons for the works of Cod, which He 
himself will reveal to them.3 

This could well be the view of any modern theologian. We know more

about the universe, t>fe nature of the planets, and the stars than 
was conceivable in the time of Origen, but with increased knowledge 
has also come an increased recognition of the many things that we do 
not know. One of the privileges of membership in the Kingdom of 
Heaven with the growth in wisdom and understanding is increased 
knowledge of the creation of God, Origen's view of the matter can be 
better summed up by a quotation from the concluding section of Book 
Two of De Principiis . 

For as in this life our bodies grow physically to what they 
are, through a sufficiency of food in early life supplying 
the means of increase, but after the due height has been 
attained we use food no longer to grow, but to live, and to 
be preserved in life by it; so a,lso I think that the mind, 
when it has attained perfection, eats and avails itself of 
appropriate food in such a degree, that nothing ought to be 
deficient or superfluous. And in all these things this food 
is to be understood as the contemplation and understanding 
of God, which is as a measure suitable and appropriate to 
this nature, which was ma,de and created; and this measure it 
is proper should be observed by everyone of those who are 
beginning to see God, i.e., to understand Him through purity 
of heart,i 

Christ is King of this Kingdom. It was not to be a kingdom after 
the sense of Kingdoms of this world, but after the manner in which God 
would create a kingdom, where men would be subject to laws that were 
God's. Therefore Christ spoke the truth when he said that his kingdom 
was not of this world. It was a kingdom that was in this world, but 
not of this world.2 When God spoke concerning Christ it was only those 
that had already entered into the spiritual kingdom that heard the 
words. When Christ appeared on earth after his crucifixion it was 
only to those that were either in the Kingdom already, or at the gate 
and waiting entrance, having that understanding which is of the soul.3

God. through Christ is the supreme ruler in this Kingdom which 
is man's for the asking. 

But we desire not only to understand the nature of the Divine 
Kingdom of which we are continually speaking and writing, 
but also ourselves to be of those who are under the rule of 
God alone, so that the Kingdom of God may be ours.l 

You caa only serve one master, and you can only be in the Kingdom of 

God if he alone is that master. Here you have a picture of a kingdom 

that is both present now and in the future. The citizens of that 

kingdom have eternal life, and the kingdom, which is spiritual, is 

not disturbed by the physical death of its citizens, for the soul 

lives on under the rule of the Eternal. 

Elesh and blood does not inherit the Kingdom of God. neither 

does corruption inherit incorruption.2 it is the soul which is 

eternal that is clothed with a body suitable to its new abode. Here 

is the eternal nature of the Kingdom, Toynbee writes that this world 

must pass away in order to give place to an Other Worid.3 That being 

the case then it follows that the Kingdom of God lies in the Other 

World. This is "the Kingdom of God that is not in Time at all, but 

is in a different spiritual dimension, 11 and which, just by "The 

difference of dimension, is able to penetrate our mundane life and to 

transfigure it."^ This is the thought of Origen concerning the 

Kingdom of God, and is the eternal nature of the Hew Jerusalem, Man 

who is in time, by virtue of his faith in Christ and his knowledge of 

God through Christ, entered into the Kingdom of God which is without 

Time, and thereby transcends the limitations of this world. This is. 

the nature of eternal life with God.

CHAPTER XX 


THE REFINER 1 2 3 S FIRE? 

And., behold the Day came. The raging torrent of 
justice swept down from the heights, and a world 
was destroyed. 

The sun shone, and the water subsided. Out of 
death came life. Formed from the old was the new. 

This is the Day which the Lord hath made. Rejoice 
and be glad in it. 

D.A. Greenough. 

They behold, beyond that.twilight realm, as in a 
glass, 

The future. 

Shelly - Prometheus Unbound. 

Divine Judgment was a reality in the thought of Origen, God is the 
judge of all human thought and action, and as a judge he passes 
sentence.^ This is a prerogative of God as sovereign ruler of the 
universe. It was God who judged Israel and punished her,^ God has 
been both judge and king from the beginning; he becomes king and 
judge at every crisis in history; he will become King and Judge at 
the great crisis which marks the end of history.3 

It is not always possible for man to comprehend the judgments 
of God. We do not always see things the same way that God does. In 
the book of Job we find that Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar completely 
misunderstood the sufferings of Job and interpreted them as Divine 
condemnation, whereas they were in reality evidence of another type 
of judgment. God had judged Job to be righteous, and steadfast in 
loyalty 7 to him. God was proved right in his judgment. Men had failed

to comprehend. Origen states that the judgments of God are st) great 
that a soul which is still clothed with a moral "body cannot comprehend 
them.l 

Origen felt that God Himself was not responsible for the evil 

calamities that befell men, even although these calamities wCre a 

judgment upon the ways of mankind. He was convinced that these 

calamities were caused by evil angels that were permitted to bring 

calamities upon men in judgment. 2 These angels of wickedness were 

certain beings who fell away from G-od at the beginning, and sunk to 

such a depth of unworthiness and wickedness as to be completely 

unworthy of redemption.3 These evil and depraved beings continue in a 

state of enmity and opposition to those tha.t are receiving the 

redemptive training of G-od. This is the reason why the whole of 

mortal life is full of struggles and trials. 

which are caused by the opposition and emnity of those 
who fell from a better condition without at all looking 
back, and who are called the devil and his angels, and 
the other orders of evil which the apostle classed among 
the opposing powers.^ 

Despite the evil nature into which man has fallen God will never 
abandon the world, even though it should become more wicked owing to 
the continued sinning of man. God has made arrangements to purify the 
world, and after a time to bring it back to himself.5 Origen was an 
optimist. He felt that the condition of the world was not hopeless 
because it was, after all, God’s world. He then goes on to point out

that God i3 not angry with "apes or flies", butvtdi human beings who 
have transgressed what he terms "the laws of nature" or God's laws. 
Because of this God has already sent judgments and chastisements upon 
the earth, and threatened them through the words of the prophets*^* 

More than a3 1 this he sent Jesus Christ that they might he converted 
to the Ways of God. You feel that at this point Origen almost uses 
the word reconverted. He further convinced that those who neglected 
this call would deserve the punishments which God. would inflict on 
them "for the good of the whole." This punishment is for correction, 

I 

in order that the whole world will once again belong to God in that 
every creature willown him Lord and King, and be subject unto the will 
of God in si 1 love. Man is not deserted by God. Here is an echo .of 
the love of God tha,t is portrayed in Ho sea. 

God is a consuming fire. Wicked works are destroyed, for God 
enters into a man's life as a "refiner's fire to refine the rational 
nature"^ it i s God who will cleanse away the evils from the soul of 
man, and thus leave it pure as He intended it should be. The fire 
from God is a purifying fire, brought upon the world, and also on 
each one that needs "chastisement by fire and healing at the same 
time. "3 It burns but does not consume, Origen describes men's 
thoughts as having in them qualities that he compares to 'hay, wood, 
and stubble' which need to be burned and consumed by this purifying 
fire from God,^ God is the benefactor of those that stand in need 
of discipline by fire. It is interesting to note tha,t this consuming 
fire is not for the destruction of men, but for their purification

Origen did not believe in the fire as being of a material nature. 
He writes: 

We find in the prophet Isaiah, that the fire with which each 
one is punished is described as his own; for he says, 'Walk 
in the light of your own fire, and in the flame which ye 
have kindled.' (Is%L:ll) By these words it seems to be 
indicated that every sinner kindles for himself the flame 
of his own fire, and is not plunged into some fire which 
has been already kindled by another, or was in existence 
before himself. Of this fire the fuel and food are our ' 

sins which are called by the Apostle Paul wood, and hay and 
stubble. And I think that, as abundance of food, and 
provisions of a contrary kind and amount, breed fevers in 

the body.so when the soul has gathered together, a 

multitude of evil works and an abundance of sins against 
itself, at a suitable time all that assembly of evil "boils 
up to punishment, and is set on fire to chastisements;,.. 

....then is the conscience itself harassed, and, pierced by 
its own goads, becomes an accuser and witness against itself.1 

The action of God in this punishment is to make the memory vivid that 

men will remember "the foul, shameful and unholy deeds" that they have 

done. This is the consuming fire that is brought on by sin. 

■ ■ 

There is a further type of punishment in the opinion of Origen. 

He thought of perfection as being complete harmony. G-od created the 
world in harmony, Man through his own sin has disrupted that harmony. 
This disruption also brings on its own punishment. Re compares it to a 
body that is. being disjointed with ' ' suffering, so with the 

soul that has fallen into disunion and beyond the order and harmony 
in which it was created by God.2 The soul has to bear the chastisement 
and torture of its own dissension, and feel the punishments of its own 
disordered condition. After the soul has been tested and cleansed by 
fire the soul will be restored into its former firm position of unity 
and harmony.3 Again he compares this cleansing fire of God* to the

physicians knife that is sometimes required, because of the nature 

of the disease, to remove the infected parts by amputation. In the 

thought of Origen God is the physician of our souls.1 

.how much more is it to be understood that God our 

Physician, desiring to remove the defects of our souls, 
which they had contracted from their different sins and 
crimes should employ penal measures of this sort, and 
should apply even, in addition, the punishment of fire to 
those who have lost their soundness of mind 

The fury of God*s vengeance is profitable for the purgation of souls. 

This punishment is applied with the object of healing. You axe 

sanctified in a burning fire. This fire of redemption is experienced 

by all xvithout except ion. 3 It is not the eternal man who judges the 

finite man, but the eternal and holy God who judges raan,^ In the 

judgment of God we find mercy as well as justice. Modern theology 

would tend to emphasize the judgment as being from Christ rather than 

God, whereas Origen tended more to the Old Testament idea of judgment 

by God, and Christ was the redeemer, and the standard of judgment. 

This is not to say that Origen divorced Christ from all ideas of the 

last judgment, hut the emphasis is la,id on Christ as mediator,3 rather 

than judge. 

This purification is in order that man may be worthy of dwelling 
in the Kingdom of God that is to be in the new world. Those that a,re 
still in opposition to God will undergo further sufferings,6 p e felt 
that continued wickedness in man is in danger of changing from a habit

to nature, and will require severer punishments from Grod in order 

that redempt ion might he effected.^- 

Origen was convinced in the ultimate salvation of the majority 

of men, if not of all men. His idea was quite the opposite to that 

of Augustine’s doctrine of election, Free will plays an important 

role throughout in the thought of Origen, and is carried on even in 

the future worlds. All beings are arranged according to a regular 

plan, and we have a conception of man working his way up the ladder 

to that final state of perfection and revelation, 

,.,..some of them in the first, others in the second, some 
in the last times, after having undergone heavier and severer 
punishments, endured for a lengthened period, and for many 
ages, so to speak:, improved by this stern method of training, 
and restored at first by the instruction of the angels, and 
subsequently by powers of &, higher grade, and thus advancing 
through each stage to a better condition, reach even to that 
which is invisible and eternal, having travelled through by 
a kind of training'; every single office of the heavenly powers. 
From which, I think this will .appear to follow as an inference, 
that every rational nature may, in passing from one order to 
another, go through each to all, and advance from all to each, 
while made the subject of varying degrees of proficiency and 
failure according to its own actions and endeavors, put forth 
in the enjoyment of its power of freedom of will.^ 

However, although he appears to maintain the belief in ultimate 

salvation for all, there ane a few suggestions in his writings that 

there may be some who have been afflicted with an ’’incurable malady 

of sin”. The punishments threatened against the ungodly will come 

upon them after they have refused all remedies and have become so 

afflicted with sin that they are uncureble, having become hardened 

in their sins,3 You gain the impression from his writings however, 

that although he admits there may be some who are incapable of 

redemption, it is very unlikely. His belief in the ultimate

rederaption of mankind is governed by hisbelief in the rational 
nature of man* Having reason, and seeing the results of rebellion 
and rejection of the ways of God and of God himself, they can 
hardly help but ultimately choose the good. Niehuhr is likely correct 
in his judgment of the Alexandrian theologians, in that they f, never 
heartily accepted St. Paul’s doctrine of justification by faith”. 

It is interesting to note that Origeh does not emphasize the 
apocalyptic. The Kingdom of God is now, and anyone who wishes to 
enter into the heavenly realm may do so. There is no emphasis on a 
final judgment day when mankind is placed on judgment before God, 

God is always passing judgment, and corrective punishment. Ultimately 
the present world is to be destroyed because of its wickedness,^ but 
that is not in the nature of a'final judgment on man, 

Man is the cause of his own downfall, ”The lapse by which an 
individual falls away from his position is characterized by a great 

/V •' 

diversit y, ”3 One man will fall with greater ease than another into 
a lower condition* In this we see, according to Origen, the just 
judgment of God on men according to the extent of their deflection 
from Him, At the end, the righteous are rewarded according to their 
righteousness and loyalty to God, some being ’’given the rank of 
thrones”, ’’others dominion” according to their merit. This is 
conferred by a just and Divine Providence ’’according to their merits 
and to the progress they had made in the participation and imitation 
of God. ^ This takes place after the end. The Divine judgment at the 
End takes the form of greater and lesser reward rather than the form

of "the righteous wrath of God," 

Thus the righteous shall he rewarded and the wicked shall he 
punished. This is also the substance of a statement that Origen makes 
in reply to Celsus who maintained that the Christians taught that the 
righteous would he rewarded and the wicked suffer eternal punishment. 
Origen does not repeat the "eternal" aspect of the punishment, in view 
of his conception of the meaning of Divine punishment.^ This is quite 
different from Augustine’s conception of eternal damnation, which 
doctrine was also emphasized hy the Calvinists. 

The object of those who are Christians is to reform the race, 
"either hy threats of punishments which we are persuaded are necessary 
for the whole world" or hy promises made to those who live righteous 
lives. The object of this reformation is to prepare the world for the 
final end of things, and the ultimate termination of the world in the 
Kingdom of God.^ Certainly there is to he an end to the present world, 
and after the end a just judgment of all things.3 After the End a new 
order of things is going to come into being.4 In discussing the end 
of the age Origen brings to the notice of the reader one of the 
paradoxes that are typical of Christianity. He speaks of a perishable 
earth that is immortal, and that is capable of dying but does not 
actually die.3 That is, out of the end of the age will come a new 
earth and a new heaven that is a product of the present age and is a 
culminating point in the creative activity of God. 

The end for Origen is the completion and perfection of the

creation of God. The end of the world will take place when everyone 

will he subjected to punishment for his sins. God alone knows this 

time, and he will bestow on each one what he deserves.1 Again, at 

the end of the world he feels that God will call all men to the end 

for which he created them, that they might have perfect communion with 

the Eternal, and be one in him.2 

’For all things must be put under Him. 1 (l Cor 15;25) What 
then is this ’putting under* by which all things must be 
made subject to Christ? I am of the opinion that it is this 
very subjection by which we also wish to be subject to Him, 
by which the Apostles also were subjects, and all the saints 
who have been followers of Christ. For the name ’subjection’, 
by which we are subject to Christ, indicates that the 
salvation'that proceeds from Him belongs to His subjects.3 

This is the end when all will be subjects of Christ, and death the 

last enemy will be conquered. 

There is a new heaven and a new earth. This is not, in Origen’s 
view, a change in material substance, but a "change of quality and 
a transformation of appearance."4 fhis is a renewal of heaven and 
earth in which God is ever "all in all H 5 As to the details of the 
new heaven and the new earth, Origen states that they are known to 
God alone. Man is made spiritual, and is one with God in spirit, 
for God is completely in him. As, at the end, God is in all things 
then nothing that is wicked "must be supposed to attain to that end"^. 
Death, nor evil will not exist, for God is all; there will be no lack 
of spiritual food, or knowledge, for God shall be suffi dent for all 
needs.7 This is the real Kingdom of God in the fullness of its glory, 
transcending time and space, and without limitation. Christ is the

CHAPTER XXI 

THE LIVING- SOUL 


We are laid asleep in "body, and 
■become a living soul. 

Tintern Abbey-Wordsworth. 

Many Christians of the period of Origen believed that in the 

final Lay of the Lord men would be reunited with their bodies; The 

dead in Christ would rise. This constituted one of the great 

difficulties of the time, and many Christians were bothered by it, 

not to mention the scorn with which it was mentioned by the heathen. 

Origen, like Clement found a solution of his doubts in the teachings 

of the Apostle Paul. The resurrection body will be a spiritual body-*-. 

It was quite clear to Origen that there would be a body for the spirit. 

Our bodies arise spiritual bodies having cast off corruption and laid 

aside mortal!ty. Thus the body is changed from a condition of 

indignity to one of glory. Our earthly body is planted as a seed into 

the ground, and from that seed do we receive our new bodies.^ 

G-od, then, gives to each thing its own body as He pleases: 
as in the case of plants that are sown, so also in the ca,se 
of those beings who are, as it were, sown in dying, and 
who in due time receive, out of what has been sown, the 
body assigned by G-od to each one according to his deserts. 

And we may hear, moreover, the scripture teaching us at 
great length the difference between that which is sown and 
that which is raised from it.3 

Origen considers that there is some truth in the assertion of 
G-reek philosophers concerning the immortality of the soul. The soul 
is the creation of God, and therefore is not destructible.^ The soul

is spiritual, ‘belonging to those things that are invisible yet 
everlasting. The Alexandrian Fathers felt that man would be 
clothed with a body suitable for the realm in which he would dwell. 

In the purer ethereal regions of heaven the soul will be clothed 
with a spiritual body to fit into the new nature of things. When 
the earthy realm is destroyed these changes will take place.1 

When Origen writes of the resurrection body being a spiritual 
body he does not mean to sever all connections with the earthly body. 

He has some difficulty with this interpretation of the resurrection of 
the flesh, stating that it is the same body, only a change has taken 
place. He appears to hold to the conviction that the change in the 
state of the body is fromsthe corruptible form of flesh to the 
inCorruption form of spirit. It is the same bod2/' transformed from an 
inferior into a better condition.2 

The spiritual body is, of such a nature that it is to be inhabited 
only by perfect and holy souls.3 The spiritual body excells in 
splendor that which is of this earth. If the ma.terial things of the 
earth are in great beauty, how much more will there be a beauty and 
§.ory in the invisible heavenly state, Origen had complete faith in 
God, and he felt that God would provide far beyond any visions that 
we might have.^ 

These things will take place only when the last enemy death is 
conquered. For Origen, the destruction of the last enemy*death* is 
not so much the idea of death perishing, and death itself disappearing, 
but of its ceasing to be an enemy,5 Through death comes life, and

therefore death will actually cease to he such in the full sense 
of the world, Origen speaks of the "mind and hostile will 11 of death 
which are to be destroyed. It is difficult here to grasp his meaning, 
but it may be that he is thinking of the hostile will of men that has 
made death an enemy of God and righteousness. Hostility to God 
ultimately brings about absolute death, if carried on to the logical 
conclusion, 

Origen appears to ha.ve the conception of the immediate life of 
the soul after death, but the resurrection of the body that is to 
clothe the soul in the heavenly realm only takes place at the end of 
time with the consummation of all things.

CKAFTEJ. XXII 

THE REALM OE WILLING OBEDIENCE 


We receive But what we give, 

And in our life alone does nature live. 

Samel Coleridge 

from Dejection: An Ode. 

The most important accomplishment of the coming of the Kingdom 
is the redemption of man from evil. Origen feels, contrary to the 
opinions held by Augustine, and later Calvin, that man. is Basically 
good. He has fallen from the high estate into which he was created 
by the misuse of his own free will. However, being created a rational 
creature by God as well as having a free will he will ultimately see 
the truth of righteousness, and through Christ the true way of life. 
Thus "even in this life" it will be possible for them to be delivered 
from"the bondage of evil",-*- Origen went so far in this doctrine of 
the redemption of all mankind from evil by the coming of the Kingdom 
that even Satan is allowed the hope of future grace through the medium 

'V 

of Christ and the Kingdom.2 

Christ came in order that he might save maakind. Such was the 
decree of God, In Jesus was the union of the Divine with human nature. 
Seeing the revelation thus in Christ it is possible that the human, 
by communion with God might rise to be divine and therefore enter 
into the life which Jesus taught.3 This redemption is to cleanse men 
from the guilt and-power of sin, and thus to free men from servitude 
to the evil forces of the world that alienate him from God. Thus the 
redeemed come into the Kingdom, and are priests unto God, and this 
takes place even on earth. The experience of redemption which 
Christians now receive is for Origen a foretaste of the full redemption

whose scope will embrace all history and nature. Shill redemption 

has already entered into the world, but awaits its final consummation. 

The Kingdom of God is an eternal kingdom. The kingdoms of this world 

are material, and are based upon wealth and power that is acquired 

from wealth. They are here today, and tomorrow they will have passed 

away, covered with the sands accumulated by time. The Kingdom of 

Heaven is invisible, and its power is based upon truth, it is of the 

perfection of God, and does not pass away.1 In the kingdom above are 

to be seen the perfect works of God, of which works on earth are only 

imperfect immitations , 2 In that City and that Kingdom there is the true 

glory that comes only from God, which is not as the glory of this world. 

This is the land of milk and honey that God promised first to the 

Jews and then to the Gentiles.3 Origen argues that it is a mistaken 

impression to think of the land of Judea as the promised land, for the 

land of Judea was included in the curse of God. 

But he does not see that Hoses, who is much older than 
Greek literature, introduces God as promising to those 
who lived according to His law the holy land, which is 
1 a good land and a large, a land flowing with milk and 
honey ; * 1 which promise is not to be understood to refer, 
as some suppose, to that land which we call Judea; for 
it, however good it may be, still forms part of the earth 
which was originally cursed for the transgression of Adam. 

The promised land for the righteous, referred to in scripture, is 

11 the pure land in the pure heaven. H 5 

In the City of God we find that Christ is the everlasting light. 

This is the light that shineth in darkness. Here is the "Sun of

Righteousness" that takes the place of the earthly sun.-*- He shall 
give wisdom to those that are without, and shall instruct the ignorant. 
This Light is the brilliance of the Heavenly kingdom and the supplier 
of all our wants. For Origen we find the Kingdom centred in the 
person of Christ. 

In the Sternal City God will he known to all. Origen maintains 
that one of the greatest evils isthe ignorance of God, and the ignorance 
of how God is to he served and worshipped, 2 i n the Kingdom men will 
he wholly given to pleasing God in thought, word, and deed.3 Origen 
also felt that the present evils of the world were the result of 
rehellion against God on the pant of men who had. been given the gift of 
free will. Therefore, in the Kingdom of God evil would he kept out by 
the obedience of man to God in every respect. To 'will 1 to serve God 
was of prime importance to this greatest of the Alexandrian theologians. 

God's laws are of the greatest importance. Origen saw in the 
Jewish sta,te a resemblance of the City of God, because it was a state 
that was to be governed by Divine laws.^ Moreover, the laws of God 
were to have precedence over all others laws. When the law of God 
commands us to act opposite to the written law man's reason will tell 
him to cast aside the written law and to give themselves up to the 
legislator God, and to choose a life agreeable to his word. "5 Origen 
states that the one who transgresses the Divine law dishonors God by 
his very transgression, and "he who treads under foot the Word trea-ds 
under foot the Son of God ."6 Therefore it is also clear that to honor

God it is necessary for the individual to keep the Divine law* "The 
worshipper of God is he whose life is regulated "by the principles 
and precepts of the Divine Word."! 

Origen expresses the sentiment of Jeremiah when he pictures a 
new type of worship in the Kingdom of God, In the society of his day 
the pagan religions still were an important element with their 
sacrifices and ritual. When he restates the vision of Jeremiah of 
the true worship of the heart he would he certain to find a response 
among his pagan readers. Origen speaks of the "spirit of every good 
man as an altar from which arises an incense which is tnily and 
spiritually sweet smelling, namely the prayers ascending from a pure 

conscience."2 

The Christian who has citizenship in the Kingdom does not merely 
observe one day a week as the Lord’s, but to the perfect Christian who 
through his thoughts, words and deeds is serving the Lord, "all his 
days are the Lord’s, and he is always keeping the Lord’s Day. The 
Christian is continually preparing himself for the true life, which 
is to be lived continually in the presence of God."3 In passing over 
the things of the worldly life in thought, word, and deed he is 
hastening towards the City of God.^ In the city of God is to be found 
a continual Pentecost, for man becomes filled with the spirit of the 
Lord. In the Kingdom of God man will find peace and nurity, as well 
as strength for he will continually be filled with the Holy Ghost, 
which is the glory of God, 

Origen spoke of the Kingdom of Heaven as a purely spiritual realm.

The saints will ea.t indeed, "but it will "be the bread of 
life, which may nourish the soul with the food of truth 
and wisdom, and enlighten the mind, and cause it to drink from 

the cup of divine wisdom..By this food of wisdom, the 

understanding, "being nourished to an entire and perfect 
condition like that in which man was made at the beginning, 
is restored to the likeness and image of God.l 

Even the very good in the Kingdom of God which is in Heaven is 

spiritual. Man is made wise, and his worship is that which comes from 

the soul; he is made a living sacrifice. A man may depart from this 

earth without having the complete knowledge of the waysof the Lord, but 

if he faithful to Christ he “will be capable of receiving instruction 

in that Jerusalem, the city of the saints. 1 ^ He will be made a living 

stone, and will come to w a truer and clearer knowledge M that man shall 

not live by bread alone, but through the living word of God. This is 

the food of the soul with which the citizens of the Kingdom are fed. 

..•..•when our eye beholds the products of an artist’s labor, 
the mind, immediately on perceiving anything of unusual 
artistic excellence, burns to know of what nature it is, or 
how it was formed, or to what purposes it was fashioned; so, 
in a much greater degree, and in one that is beyond all 
compariso n, does the mind burn with an inexpressible desire to 
know the reason of those things which we see done by God. 

This desire, this longing, we believe to be unquestionably 
implanted within us by God; and as the eye naturally seeks 
the light and vision, and our body naturally desires food 
and drink, so our mind is possessed with a becoming and 
natural desire to become acquainted vi th the truth of God 
and the causes of things.3 

To those that possess in this life an outline of the truth and knowledge 
will be added the beauty of a perfect image in the future.^ 

Origen believed in the rapture of mankind, but he didn’t define 
it as being of the flesh in this life, but a special transportation of 
the souls of the saints after they have received true knowledge of the

things that are, and the things th c at are to he. In the final analysis 
Origen always came to the position regarding the future life that it 
was G-od alone who knew, and that it wasn't meant for mankind to have 
this full knowledge until the consummation of time or until he -passed 
from this earth to the realm "beyond. Of one thing only was he certain, 
and that was of the spiritual nature of the Heavenly kingdom, and 
therefore of its excellence far "beyond anything that we know on this 
earth. G-od is all powerful, and all knowing , and having those 
things we are not in a position to doubt or question his purposes 
concerning us. 

The Kingdom of God is in two realms, here on earth and in heaven 
"beyond. 1 Citizenship is open to anyone at any stage in this life or 
the next, for the purpose of God involves the salvation of man from 
the sorry sta.te into which he fell through abuse of his freedom of 
will. In the Kingdom of God there is to "be complete voluntary subjection 
to the Lord of life. Some with greater gifts are to be rulers and 
instructors; governors over the provinces and cities. Others are to 
be pupils learning of the ways of God, and obtaining increased knowledge 
of him. 

This is the Kingdom that transcends all kingdoms; the empire 
that is everlasting with wealth beyond measure and far surpassing that 
of gold or jewels. Here is the crystal City of purity reaching the 
highest of the Heavens, and at the same time the lowest of the earths. 
Throughout the whole city in all its realms is the mighty omnipotent 
presence of him who is all Glory, and the One that is the everlasting 
Light. Throughout the whole are the millions of souls clothed in new 
raiment ascending to the Throne of the Lamb and the perfection which 
is oneness with God.

This is the Kingdom of God as seen by Origen, with its roots in the 
past, present and future; alpha, and omega, world without end. 

Origen may "be criticized for the extent to which he combined 
Platonism and Christianity. He thus interpreted the fall of men as a 
pre-existent defection from God, thereby destroying the Biblical concept 
of the image of God in man. Dr. Cullmann suggests that Origen under the 
Greek influence practiced violent reductions and reinterpretations of 
the Hew Testament message as did Clement.^ Certainly, the extreme 
allegorical method of exegesis as practiced in the Alexandrian school 
added nothing to Christianity. In rejecting the primitive Christian 
escatological expectation we find Origen reinterpreting the distinction 
between the present and future age with the “Greek metaphysical 
distinction between this world and the timeless Beyond.’’^ Origen 
can also be taken to task for the extent to which he carries the free 
will of man* Augustine found fault with Origen’s reinterpretation of 
the Pall of man which eliminated the doctrine of Original Sin as taught 
by Paul, and suggested by the Old Testament itself. It is necessary to 
consider the times in which Origen lived when considering his theological 
thought, and to remember that the Greek philosophies were as influential 
in his day as science is in ours. Both have to be considered, and both 
have a distinct contribution to make to Christian thought. Indeed, 
there is a grea,t deal of sound theology in the writings of Origen that 
have survived to our times because they embrace enduring truths. His 
works are not out of date, even in this age of modern science, and can 
still be studied with a great deal of profit by the church of today. 

His was a deep insight into the revelations of.God that cannot be 
ignored, and is the reason for his wide influence in the Christian 
thought of all ages.

ON AUGUSTINS AMD THE CITY OS GOD 


Augustine ( 354 -H 30 A.D.) was one of the four great fathers of 
the Latin church. His fa.ther Patricius was a burgess of Tagaste and 
still a pagan at the time of his son*s birth. His mother Monica was 
a devout and pious Christian, who eventually succeeded in converting 
both her husband and her son. Augustine studied in his native town 
and afterwards at Madaura and Carthage, especially devoting himself 
to the Latin poets. His knowledge of Greek was much more limited, and 
doubt has been expressed as to whether he was able to use the script¬ 
ures in their original tongues. Manichaeism exerted an influence 
on him, and he was a follower of this group for some years. He went 
to Milan after a year in Rome and there he came in contact with Ambrose. 
He continued to hear Ambrose preach, and gradually the gospel of divine 
truth and grace was received into his heart. 

ir, 

We are told that the converson of Augustine took place in the 
late summer of 3^6 A.D.. He received baptism the following Easter. 

In 38S A.D. he returned to Tagaste with his son who died shortly 
afterwards. He entered into the work of the church being ordained 
a presbyter of Hippo, of which city he was soon made the bishop. 

His life was one of perpetual strife, the first half in strife against 
himself, the later part against various heresies that arose in the 
church. It was in this period that we find him doing most of his 
writing. His two best known works are his Confessions and the City 
of God . As a preacher Augustine was of great importance. We still 
possess some four hundred sermons which can be ascribed to him with

certainty. Augustine died during the siege of Hippo hy the Vandels 
in the year 430 A.D. at the age of seventy-five. 

The City of Cod is a doctrine of history that has been endors e d 
by both Portestant and Catholic writers. It deals with the world 
situation after the fall of Home in 4l0 A.D., and presents a case 
for Christianity, together with a hope for the future. It describes 
the city that is eternal compared with the earthly realms that pass 
away.

CHAPTER XXIII 


THE CREATOR GOD 

God said- "Let there "be light]" 

Grim darkness felt his might, 

And fled away; 

_ / 

from The Press by Ebenezer Elliott. 

God was the creator of the universe. This is fundamental to 

the Christian faith and the Christian doctrine of history. Augustine 

1 

states that "God made the world which had a beginning". The world 

and the time had one beginning, and the one did not anticipate the 
2 

other. To God belongs the world for he made it. God created all, 
visible and intelligible beings in the world : a nd aiSongsi 'them is man. 

3 

It was God that produced the human race from one man Adam . Accord¬ 
ing to Augustine from the very beginning God foresaw the two cities 
that were going to develop. The foundation of these two cities was 
laid in the first man. "All this was ordered in the secret but just 

4 

judgments of God." The first man was created good by God, for God 
can create nothing that is evil. These statements and thought of 
Augustine are in agreement with the teachings of Christ and the 
Apostles, as well as those of the Alexandrian school. They saw the 
wonder of the world, and its perfection. They saw its order and 
beauty. They felt its might and power. They knew that man was not 
responsible for creation, for not only was it beyond his power but

it was also ‘beyond his understanding. The world was God*s, made 
and ordered by him. It was not formed by supernatural beings, or 
spirits but by God himself who is perfect. The culmination of creation 
was the formation of man. 


Man was created in the image and likeness of God. H The nature 

1 

of the human soul was created in the image of God' 1 2 3 4 5 6 . The soul is 

not material, but is spiritual. 11 The soul is neither earth, nor 

water, nor air, nor fire, of which four bodies we see this world is 

conroosed. And if the soul is not a body, how should God its creator 
2 

be a body ? 11 Augustine was sufficiently influenced by neo-Platonism 
to define the image of God in what seems at first glance to be terms 
of pure rationalism. He declares that it was not in the body but in 

3 

the mind that man was created in the image of God . Niebuhr declares 

that Augustine meant more than the capacity for reasoning when he ref- 

4 

erred to the human mind . Re points out that nous for Plotinus rep¬ 
resents the capacity for self-knowledge and introspection. This is 

5 

the knowledge to which Augustine refers in speaking of mind , It is 

not only rational thinking in connection with the material world, but 

it also involves the search of one ! s own soul. Niebuhr further points 

out that it was in the mystery of self-consciousness that Augustine 

6 

sought God . Man*s powerspoint to God, but he cannot comprehend him.

Human life points "beyond itself. This is the-yearning of the soul 
for God; the outreach of the human to the divine. The image of God 
in man stirs him to seek out God himself within his being. Karl 
Barth, who maintains that revelation from God to man has no other 
contact with man except those which itself creates, is in disagreement 
on this point with the thought of Augustine, who recognized the 
Divine in man that reached out to God. 

God having created the world is in complete control of history. 

With the fall of man the image but not the likeness is destroyed. 

The purpose of history is to restore perfection to the creation of 

the Almighty God. Even the heathen kingdoms and empires fall within 

this plan. The Homan Empire, was only enabled to endure as long as 

it did through the providence of God. The Kingdom of the Jews was 

founded by God and '’preserved by him as long as they remained in the 
1 

true religion." Augustine asserts that every occurrence that takes 

place in history bears witness to the activity of God. Earthly 

kingdoms ase given by God to both the good and the bad. "He does 

this according to the order of things and times which are hidden from 

2 

us, but thoroughly known to himself." The problem that arises here 
was anticipated by Augustine, when he wrote that "the earthly king¬ 
doms are given by him to both the good and the bad, lest his worship¬ 
pers, still under the conduct of a, weak mind, should covet these gifts 

3 

from him a,s some great things."

Augustine is critical of the cyclic theory of history as held 

by the Creeks. In this respect he uses some of the same arguments 

that we found Origen employing in his work Against Celsus .. There 

is neither any purpose or deisgn in such a plan, and it can offer 

1 

no hope for the human race . For the Christian, history is from 
beginning to end. 

In Christ we see the climax of history as designed by Cod, 

Without altering boundaries of the earthly kingdoms Christ has man¬ 
aged to create his kingdom in the hearts of men and women. Here is 
the King of the City of Cod, coming to rule his own, A divine nation 

is being made from the peoples of the world, and transcends all earthly 

2 * 

boundaries , he throne of Cod is for ever and ever. This kingdom 

is the tine Israel into which people are called not by the flesh, 

but through faith. This Heavenly kingdom is the fulfillment of the 
3 

promises of Cod , 

The Kingdom of Cod was preserved from generation to generation 
by the orderly process of birth. Cochrane states that in this con¬ 
text each individual has his own times and spaces, and the notion of 

' 4 

a man out of his age H is therefore an abstraction . M Man has a nature 
and a destiny. If there were neither nature nor purpose to man the 
coming of Christ would be in vain, and tend towards the ridiculous. 
Augustine discovered the clue to human history in the impulse of human

beings, to attain to happiness. This happiness is found, in harmony. 

The peace of body and soul is the well ordered and harmonious 
life and health of the living crep.ture. Peace between man and 
God is the well-ordered obedience of faith to eternal law. 

Peace between man and man is well ordered concord ....The 
peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harm¬ 
onious enjoyment of God, and of one another in God, The peace 
of all things is the tranquility of order. 1 

Christ introduces a new unity into human history. It is a unity 
of nature, all men being created in the image of God, and predes¬ 
tined to fulfill the divine will, Cochrane writes that "unity 

rests on the assumption that there is one world, one nature, and 

2 

one destiny for mankind." For Augustine the new principle of 
unity and division finds expression in the two societies or cities, 
the one human and the other divine. The one is the city of Christ; 
the other belongs to the devil. These two docieties include the 
whole of the human race as well as the good and evil angels of the 
other realms. The life of these two societies continues from the 
beginning. They ane intermingled throughout history, to be sep¬ 
arated only d the last day. This igtthe power of God. 

The two societies were seen Ty God from the beginning, and 
the foundation of the Celestial City was laid in the beginning 
with time. God has knowledge of the future. It is impossible 
to have a doctrine of history in which God is the controlling 
power unless it is agreed that in order to be in control of 
history God must have knowledge of history. This knowledge of

events includes the' future as well as the past. 

To confess that God exists, and at the same time to deny that 
he has any foreknowledge of future things is a, most manifest 
folly....If all future things have been foreknown they will 
happen in the order in which they are foreknown, 1 

With the foreknowled of G-od Augustine encounters the same dif¬ 

ficulty as does Crigen with the question of free will. August¬ 
ine qualifies his statement of the foreknowledge of G-od with the 
statement that "it does not follow that though there is for G-od 
a certain order of all causes , there must be nothing depending 

on the free exercise of our own wills, for our wills themselves 

2 

are included in that order of causes which is certain to God," 
Human wills are the causes of human actions. God knows the causes 
of all things, and he therefore knows the will of man and how it 
is going to act. This dees not altogether eliminate the problem, 
and Augustine himself tries to further qualify the argument, God 
made all things, including the will but God does not make anything 

3 

evil, therefore the wicked will was net sent from him . However, 
God knows the net ure of the wicked will as well as of the good * 
will, and knowing all causes he knows the results. 


God is not only the creator of the world with control of 
history and foreknowledge of events, he a,lso upholds the universe 
with his providence. God has not left the kingdoms of men out- 

4 

side of the lav/s of his providence. It is God that appoints the

rulers of the earth and. maintains the empires of men . All 

things are thus regulated “by the providence of God. All creation 

needs God in order to continue in existence. The powers of heaven 

2 

and earth, and the holy angels fulfill the providence of God . 

The doctrine of the absolute power of God is cardinal with Augustine, 
and all other Christian doctrine is regulated by this absolute 
power. This might surpasses even the love of God. It is an Old 
Testament rather than the Hew Testament concept of God that is 
emphasized. Ignatius, Polycarp, Irenaeus and Origen all are 
convinced of the power of God, but this power is tempered with 
the love of God.

CHAPTER XXIV 


THE PRESERVATION OP LIFE 


The waters overflow, and a smooth spot 
Of gls.ssy quiet mid those "battling tides 
Is left, the "boat paused shuddering. - 
Shall it sink 

Down the abyss? Shall the reverting stress 
Of that resistless gulf embosom it? 

from Alastor by Shelly. 

The will of man is ruled by necessity to a certain degree. 

Death of the body comes whether we will it or not. These events 

are not controlled by the will of man. However, Augustine points 

out that whether we live rightly or wickedly is not controlled by 

necessity, for "if we will, it is; if we will not, it is not, - 

1 .1 

for we should not will if we were unwilling. When we suffer un¬ 
willingly by the will of another* f, even in that case will retains 
its essential validity." Man, having will under his own control, 
is therefore responsible for his willing. If he wills evil, then 
it is a defect of the will, and the plight of man results from 
this defect. 

If both are tempted equally and one yields and consents to 
the temptation while the other remains unmoved by it, what 
other account can we give of the matter than this, that the 
one is willing, the other unwilling to fall away from 
chastity? 2 

The evil will is deficient from that which is supreme. It is def¬ 
icient because it chooses a lesser good and deprives itself of 

3 

the greater good. In so doing it is evil and gives rise to sin .

Man therefore suffers justly for his defection from God. 

Man has separated himself from God, and it is only through 

the grace and mercy of God that man ha.s survived, and has the 

hope of attaining to reunion with the Eternal. The patience of 

God still invites the wicked to repentence, and the scourge of 

God educates the good to -patience. "And so too does the mercy 

of God embrace the good that it may cherish them, as the severity 

1 

of God arrests the wicked to punish them . God has shad mercy on 
man and extended to him his grace that he might be rescued from 
the evils into which he has sunk. 


The grace of God was demonstrated in Jesus Christ. The Son 

of God assumed the flesh of humanity that mankind might be given 
2 

the hope of his love . Through Christ man is able to approach 
God, who by his very nature was far from man. Divine mercy med¬ 
iated through Christ destroys and breaks down the wa.ll created 
by sin that separates man and God. The soul is turned from self- 
love to obedience. Man by his own will performs works that are 
worthy of eternal life, but it is necessary, in the Augustinian 
conception, that the will of man should be prepared by the grace 

* 3 

of God . By this mercy and through this grace is man brought into 
the Kingdom of God. 

It is also the grace of God that rescues man from the depths 
to which he has sunk.

For as by the sin of one man we ha.ve fallen into a misery 
so deplorable, so by the righteousness of one Man, who also 
is God, shall we come to a blessedness inconceivably exalted 


He abiding unchangeable, took upon Him our nature, that there 
by he might take us to Himself; and, holding fast His own 
divinity, He became partaker of our infirmity, that we, 
being changed into some better thing, might, by participat¬ 
ing in His righteousness and immortality, lose our own prop¬ 
erties of sin and mortality, and preserve whatever good 
quality He had implanted in our nature, perfected now by 
sharing in the goodness of His nature. 1 


Through Christ is man raised up that he might partake of the 
divine nature and become perfect. The love of God is operative 
in his grace, overcoming the evil with good and creating a new 
man. Human nature is not able to do this itself, but only God 
is able to do it, Man does good, not by his own nature but 
through the grace of God. 


Man can only be restored to his original condition by his 

Creator. God in his foreknowledge had anticipated the fall, 

and arranged the order of events that his will and purpose should 

not come to nought. The human race has- been condemned through 

the sin of Adam. There is no escape from this condemnation save 

2 

"through the grace of the Savior Christ, our Lord and God," 

The sa,craments are "the vessels of mercy" for Augustine. 

Those that have xoartaken of these sacraments, even though death 
should immediately be their lot are "translated from the power 

3 

of darkness to the kingdom of Christ." The love of God conquers

all, and is given only through the Mediator between God and man. 

Salvation is achieved only through Christ, who teas both man 

and God. Augustine declares that two conditions had to be met 

by this mediator between’man and God, "that he become mortal, 

1 

and that he does not continue mortal." 


The multitude of the blessed are blessed only by their 
participation in the one God; of which participation the 
evil angels being deprived, they are wretched, and inter¬ 
pose to hinder rather than to help to this blessedness, 
and by their very number prevent us from reaching that one 
beatific good, to obtain which we need not man, but one 
Mediator, the uncreated Word of God, by whom all things 
were made, and in partaking of whom we are blessed, I 
do not say that He is Mediator because He is the Word, 
for as the Word He is supremely blessed and supremely 
immortal, and far from miserable mortals; but He is med¬ 
iator an He is man, for by his humanity He shows us that, 
in order to obtain that blessed and beatific good, we 
need not seek other mediators....but that blessed and 
beatific God....has afforded us ready access to the 
participation of His divinity, 2 


To attain to the supreme good (complete harmony with God which 
is salvation), man needs the mediation that"is furnished by 
Christ alone. Man himself is impure and therefore mortal, and 
with these attributes he is unable to have communion with God 
who is "immortal purity’ 1 2 3 . The Mediator Christ is needed to re¬ 
move this dificulty. Only he who remained heavenly while on 

3 

earth is able to reunite man to God,

Salvation is through Christ by faith. Augustine placed a 

great deal of importance on this Pauline doctrine. "It was by 

faith and godliness of life that purification was attainable, 

1 

even by the saints of old”. The faith that enables man to attain 
to salvation is the same faith that Abraham exhibited when he 
offered his only son Isaac as a sacrifice to Cod, 


But as Abraham put out his hand to grasp the knife to 
slay his son, the angel of the Lord called to him from 
the heavens, "Abraham, Abraham]" 

"Here I am," he replied. 

"Do not lay hands on the boy," he said, "do nothing of 

the sort to him; for I know now that you revere Cod, in 

that you have not withheld your son„from me." Cen. 22:10-12. 2 


This faith is acceptable before Cod as a sacrifice in itself. 

By this faith is man raised to the highest heavens and the King¬ 
dom of Cod, 

Death is the punishment of sin. This doctrine is held in 
common by all the theologians of the early church, Paul, Clem¬ 
ent, Heriricns, Origen and Augustine, as well as numerous others, 
Augustine now declares that by the grace of Cod the mnishment 

3 

of sin is turned to the service of righteousness. / "For then it 

was proclaimed to man, ’If thou sinnest thou shalt die; 1 now it 

is said to the martyr, ’Die that thou sin not.’,.,.By the very 

mercy of Cod, even the very punishment of wickedness has become 

4 

the armour of virtue.” Cod through his grace has made death

the instrument of life. Salvation for Augustine is not merely 

the true knowledge of God through Christ as it was for Origen, 

Ignatius, and Justin Martyr, but it is salvation from eternal 

1 

punishment to life with God . True knowledge of God is a result 
of salvation, but it is not to be equated with salvation. Sal¬ 
vation for Augustine carried man into the realm of eternity and 
beyond history. It saves man from the condemnation of God. For 
Augustine man was justified by his faith whereas for many of the 
early church Fathers men were saved through repentance (Herman, 
Ignatius, etc.). 

On the matter of salvation Augustine finds an echo in the 
statement by the late Archbishop Temple that the true aim of 
the soul is to glorify God, and in pursuing that aim it will 
attain unto salvation unawares. "Salvation is the state of him 
who has ceased to be interested whether he is saved or not, pro¬ 
vided that what takes the place of that supreme self-interest is 

2 

not a lower form of self-interest but the glory of God." Thus 
Augustine writes of salvation as the final happiness of man. 

"We do not see our good, but live by faith." The Christian is 
saved in hope of what he does not see. Therefore "we do not 
possess a present (salvation), but look for a future salvation." 
This salvation as it is in the world to come is the final hap- 

3 

piness of the Christian.

CHAPTER XXV 


THE CONDEMNATION ON THE NIGHT 

And their condemnation is this:- that they 
chose darkness rather than light. 

D.A.Greenough 

Sin, for Augustine, is the factor that keeps men out of 
the Kingdom of God. It is onlj' when this element is removed 
through the grace of God in Jesus Christ that man is able to 
enter into the Celestial city. Augustine declares without res¬ 
ervation that de c ath is the punishment of sin. If man had dis¬ 
charged his obligation of obedience to God n an angelic immortal¬ 
ity and a blessed eternity” might have ensued without the inter- 
1 

vention of death. Death for Augustine is not merely the death 

of the body but the death of the soul. (, The human soul also 

has a death of its own. The death of the soul takes place when 

God forsakes it, as the death of the body when the soul forsakes 
2 

it. ,f The death of both occurs when the soul forsaken by God, 
itself forsakes the body. 

Original sin was pride. This same pride is the prime sin 
of mankind wherein he places himself in the place of God. The 
evil act is preceded by an evil will, and the origin of the evil 
will is pride. ”And what is pride but the craving for undue ex¬ 
altation, when the soul abandons Him to whom it ought to cleave

for its end, and becomes a kind of end to itself." Pride de¬ 
bases the heart and humility exalts the soul. Humility is rec¬ 
ommended for those who would be citizens of the Kingdom of God. 
This marks the difference between the two cities, of which Aug¬ 
ustine writes. "The one is guided and fashioned by love of self, 

2 

the other by love of God." 

Man was created with a good will by God. The first evil 
will which preceded all manVs evil acts was a falling away from 
the works of God. The resulting acts were evil because they did 

3 

not have God for an end, but rather the will itself. This bad 
will is opposed to nature, and, as Augustine puts it, it created 
its own nature out of nothing. Man * s nature as God created him 
was good, but in that he fell away from God he created his own 
evil nature. The will can only be restored to good by Him who 
first gave it. This salvation is through Christ. The kingdom 
of God is composed in part of these individuals whose wills have 
been restored to good through the gra.ce of God in Jesus Christ. 
Individual pride has no place in the city of God, but rather is 
the spirit of its inhabitants. 


Man then lived.with God for his rule in a. paradise at once 
physical and spiritual. Por neither was it a paradise only 
physica.1 for the advantage of the body, and not also spirit¬ 
ual for the advantage of the mind;,...but after that proud

and envious angel, preferring to rule with a kind of 
pomp of empire rather than to be another's subject, fell 
from the spiritual Paradise, and essayed to insinuate his 
persuasive guile into the mind of man, whose unfallen cond¬ 
ition provoked him to envy now that himself was fallen.... 
(Adam) was not deceived as the woman was deceived, but he 
was deceived as to the judgment which would be passed on 
his apology. 1. 


Therefore man was not altogether guiltless, but shared in the 
rebellion against God, and lost his citizenship in the Kingdom 
of God, together with the privileges that went with membership 
in the heavenly society. 

Augu tine speaks of two deaths in connection with the sin 
of man. His thought goes beyond the literalistic interpretation 
of the story in Genesis that speaks only of the death of the body. 
This total death comes to all who are left outside the gates of 
the eternal city of God, and are denied admittance. 


For, as the whole earth consists of many lands, and the 
Church universal of many churches, so death universal con¬ 
sists of two, one of the body and another of the soul. 

So that the first death is a death of the whole man, 
since the soul without G-od and without the body suffers 
punishment for a time; but the second is when the soul, 
without God but with the body, suffers punishment ever¬ 
lasting. 2 


This disobedience of man to the will of God includes for its 
punishment not only the death of the body, but the second death 
which is the everlasting death of soul. This is the reward of 
those who are in the realm of darkness and outside of the King¬ 
dom of Light and Life,

The earthly Jerusalem profaned the covenant of God, and had 
no regard for the sanctuary of the Most High. Therefore they 
were thrown down to "be destroyed and their, days were shortened. 

In the midst of the earthly Jerusalem there were some "who were 
children of the free woman, holding that kingdom in temporary 

stewardship, hut holding the kingdom of the heavenly Jerusalem 

1 

in true faith and hoping in the true Christ." Those that rejected 
God were afflicted with the punishment of adversity, hut those 
that remained faithful to God achieved the blessedness of the 
Kingdom. 

There is to he a last judgement in which all men are to rec¬ 
eive- that which is due them. Christ is the judge on behalf of 
G-od. Augustine is careful to point out that judgment does not 
just take place at the last day, for God is always judging, and 
has done so since the beginning of history when Adam was condemned. 
God judges the individual, and voluntary acts of men, and they "are 
punished by God for their sins often visibly, always secretly/, 

either in this life or after death, although no man acts rightly 

2 

except with the assistance of divine aid." However there is to 
be a Last Judgment when "Christ shall come from heaven to Judge 
the qnck and the dead." 

Bor that day isproperly called the day of judgment, be¬ 
cause in it there shall be no room left for the ignorant 
questioning why this wicked person is happy and that 
righteous man unhappy. In that day true and full hap-

piness shall be the lot of none but the good, while des¬ 
erved and supreme misery shall be the portion of the 
wicked, and of them only. 1 

Every work of man will he called into judgment, whether it 

be good or bad. G-od sees things that we ordinarily do not see, 

and his judgment is therefore more just than that of 

most men. In the last judgment this power is committed to Christ 

■who is the Son. Those that believe in Christ do not come into 

the judgment. Augustine speaksof the judgment in this sense as 

judgment used for condemnation. The wicked are condemned in the 

judgment and are separated from those made righteous through the 
2 

grace of G-od. 

All men were dead- in their sins, whether original or vol¬ 
untary, "and for all the dead there"died the one only person 
who lived, that is, had no sin whatever. 11 Christ died for all 

-M 

that man might be justified, and believing in him attain to the 

first resurrection, which now is. Only those who are eternally 

3 

blessed take pant in the first resurrection. All men have a 
part in.the second resurrection, both the good and the wicked. 
"The one is the resurrection of mercy, the other of judgment. M 
Only those who hear the voice of the Son of G-od attain to the 
first resurrection and enter into the Kingdom of God. This first 
resurrection is the renewed contact of man with G-od, and is the 
experience of being born again.

Only a small number are chosen for salvation by God. In 
the theology of Augustine only enough men were going to attain 

1 

to salvation to make up the number of the fallen angels in heaven . 
This is the number of the predestined saints. These citizens 

2 

are gathered by the grace of God out of the multitude of sinners . 
n The Lord knows- those who are his. These whom he foreknew he also 
predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. None of them 

3 

can perish". Augustine felt that those who were not predestined 
to eternal life in the Celestial City would receive their reward 
in this life for thier good acts. They have been given terrestial 
glories through the righteous judgments of God. 


Elias was to come before the Last Judgment in order that 
the Jews might be converted to Christ. "He will give a,spirit¬ 
ual explanation of the Law which the Jews at present understand 
4 

carnally." With the Last Judgment'the, good will be separated 

5 

from the bad . The Church sha,ll be purged by the last Judgment 

"as a threshing floor by a, winnowing wind, and those of her mem- 

6 ff 

bers that need it cleansed by fire. 

7 

The wicked will be cast into a. furna.ee of fire . Eternal 
punishment is the reward of their wickedness. Augustine justifies

eternal punishment in declaring that at the beginning man had 

complete enjoyment of God, and "the more enjoyment man found in 

1 

God the greater was his wickedness in abandoning him." The 

accused will not be spared because of the prayers of the Saints. 

They are unworthy of the compassion of the Church. Neither will 

immoral persons achieve the Eternal City, nor those who have 

passed over to false beliefs. The sacraments are of no value to 

them, but only serve for greater condemnation because they are 

2 

then partaking of them unworthily. 

The reward of the Saints of God is not to be found in mat¬ 
erial possession, or earthly kingdoms. They have true happiness 
as their reward. They are protected by the "sun of righteousness", 

3 

and dwell in the glory of God . They are blessed by their part¬ 
icipation in the one God who rules over all the earth . They be¬ 
long to the City of God which is founded on love and makes all 

5 

covet its citizenship . Their souls are not affected by death 

which dismisses them from their bodies, "because their flesh rests 

6 

in hope." They wait in hope for the resurrected body "which will 
be better in the resurrected stale than it is now." The bodies 
of the saints will be spiritual because they will be filled with 
the glory of God. They shall enjoy the gifts of nature, "gifts 
not only good but eternal, not.only of the spirit healed now by

2 

the Saints of G-od belongs the happiness of eternal peace. Thev 

3 

shall also reign with Christ on earth, for the millenium before 
the judgment. This reward is already theirs. The first resur¬ 
rection and the greater part of the rewards of the "lect were theirs 
in the present. It was not a vain hope for a future day. It was 
given to them in the Now. The resurrection of the body, and the 
final glory awaited the End of history. 

. W:e find that Augustine speaks of two resur¬ 
rections. These have already been referred to in part. Faith in 
the resurrection calls into being the city of G-od which sojourns on 
the earth. 


Man the son of resurrection lives in hope! he lives in hope as 
long as the City of G-od which is begotten by faith in the res¬ 
urrection sojourns in this World, By faith in the death and 
resurrection of Christ is begotten in this world the City of 
G-od, that is to say, that man who has hoped to call on the 
name of the Lord. 3 


The Kingdom of G-od is not only the kingdom of Life, but also the 
kingdom of hope. Augustine declares that the translation of Enoch 
prefigured the deferred dedication of man. The resurrection hope 
is in Christ who was raised from the deal 11 and who was himself 

4 

also translated. 11 There remains the dedication of the whole 
house of which Christ is the cornerstone, that is, the kingdom of 
G-od which is sojourning on this earth will at the last day be car¬ 
ried up into the realm of heaven.

There are two resurrections, the first being of the soul and 
the second being of the body. The resurrection of the soul is only 
for those elected by God for eternal salvation. The resurrection of 
the body is of all mankind and is for the purpose of the final jud¬ 
gment by Christ. 11 The one is the resurrection of mercy, the other 
1 

of judgment. H This last resurrection is a retributive judgment. 

Concerning the resurrection of the body, Augustine writes: 

There is to be a bodily resurrection, but we are unable 
perfectly to comprehend the manner in which it shall take place. 2 

The re is, however, to be a bodily resurrection, and the resurrected 


body is capable of ascending into heavenly places . The image of 
God, which is the form of the new man, refers to the inner man and not 
the outer form, Augustine assumes a somewhat materialistic attitude 
towards the resurrected body when he goes on to describe its state of 

4 

perfection H in which all bodily blemishes shall be removed. u This 

- 5 


new body is clothed in incorruption and immortality. The saints of 
G-od, clothed in the spiritual resurrected body will be fellow cit¬ 
izens v/ith the angels in the heavenly abode. They will attain to the 


highest honors in that they will see God. 

God will be so known by us, and shall be so much before 
us, that we shall see him by the spirit in ourselves, 
in one another, in Himself, in the new heavens and the 
new earth, in every created thing which shall then exist. 
...we shall in the future world see the material forms of 
the new heavens s„nd the new earth in such a way that we 
shall "siost distincly recognize God everywhere present

They shall behold God ruling all things. Here is the Lord God, 
ruling in his city, surrounded by the inhabitants who are ruled' 
by love, and who worship him in faith. This is the City of God, 
the New Jerusalem, made glorious by the saints and angels of God, 
and in the center is the light and life of all, Jesus Christ.

CHAPTER XXVI 

THE TWO CITIES 


Accordingly, two cites have been formed by two 
loves: the earthly by the love of self, even to 
the contempt of God; the heavenly by the love of 
God, even to the contempt of self. 

Augustine De Civ. Dei Bk XIV ch. 28 

Christ is Lord and King of the heavenly city, as well as the 

great High Priest. "Christ took the beginning of his reigning from 

the river where John baptized", for he began to be acknowledged as 

Lord from this time on by his disciples. This for Augustine is the 

inauguration of the reign of Christ.^ It is only through this King 

that man can attain to true knowledge of God.^ Christ is the Priest- 

King, and through him the sacrifices of the redeemed city reach God. 

Since therefore, true sacrifices are works of mercy to ourselves 
or others, done with a reference to God, and since works of 
mercy have no other object than the relief of distress or the 
conferring of happiness.... it follows that the whole redeemed 
city, that is to say the congregation or community of the 
saints is offered to God as our sacrifice through the great 
High Priest who offered himself to God in his passion for ns» J 

The city of God was established under Christ her King, and sojourned 

in the world in hope of the great day when she will ascend to her place 

in the heavens, and the citizens of the earth will be united with the 

citizens of heaven in the City of God. 

Augustine speaks of the Divine City as a Pilgrim City while 


on earth. "The city of God sojourns as a stranger in the midst of 

the ungoSly."^ In this temporal life on earth the citizens of the 

Holy City receive the discipline of God where they are schooled for 

life eternal _

Nor will they lament their experience of it, for the good 
things of earth they use as pilgrims who are not detained 
by them* 

Augustine uses the story of Noah and the ark to synbolize the Ohurch 
and Christ* The ark represents the city of God, sojourning in the 
world, saving from destruction as many as were predestined to heed 
the warnings of the prophets and to accept the salvation of Christ* 

The earthly city is not everlasting, but is doomed to destruction* 
It has its good in this world only , and is continually divided by wars 
and divisions. It is inflated with pride and might well be termed 
Vanity Fair* It desires only the goods of this world which are given 
by God, but it neglects the better things of the heavenly city* The 
deluge is the history of the two cities: the one survives and the other 
is destoyed. 1 2 * 4 * 6 

The Jewish kingdom was a shadow of the kingdom that was to come* 
This was also the opinion of Origen* However, Augustine carries the 
discussion a little farther, for he describes the division of Israel into 
two realms corresponding to the two cities; the spiritual Israel and the 
carnal Israel*^ He describes the growth of the city of God in the Jewish 
kingdom. At one stage it was bound by the law, but with the advent of 
Christ it was freed from those fetters and found its citizens among the 
nations of the world*^ 

The heavenly city, while it sojourns on earth, calls citizens out 
of all nations, and gathers together a society of pilgrims of all 
languages* The heavenly city therefore, while in its state of 
pilgrimage avails itself of the peace of the earth, and makes 
this earthly peace bear upon the peace of heaven; for this algne 
can be called and esteemed the peace of reasonable creatures*

The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoy¬ 
ment of God, and of one another in God* 

The two cities are entangled together in this world and will be 
intermingled until the last judgment effects their separation* 2 This is 
God| final judgment by Jesus Christ. In this judgement the city shall 
take on that new glory that comes from God, when nothing old shall 
remain and all things shall be made new* There will be no death in 
the Eternal City, but the earthly city shall be no more for it shall hafre 
sunk into oblivion under eternal death, and into destruction by hell fire* 

The eternal city will be made the repose of light but the earthly city 
will be complete darkness for it shall be no more*

CHAPTER XXVII 

THE ETERNAL CITY AND TIME 

As there was a beginning so shall there be an end. 

The City of God is eternal. There none are born; for none die. 

Only in the City of God will one find true happines.. All the vices and 
corruption that are found in the cities of this world are missing in the 
City of God, for only righteousness can dwell thereIn the heavenly 
city they need none of the charms of this world. Therefore those citizens 
of heaven that are at present abiding in the earthly realm despise all 
earthly good thingsThe worship of the saints is a just and holy 

sacrifice to God, for their sacrifice is found in deeds of mercy and 

3 

love, which is acceptable to God. 

In the Holy City all are sons of God rather than of men. This 
divine sonship is evident in their lives, for they live to God and not 
to selfish ends.^ Augustine declares that Abraham was promised seed as 
numerous as the stars of heaven rather than the dust of the earth to 
signify the City of God, and the spiritual quality of the children of 
Abraham rather than carnal. In the new heaven and the new earth 
Augustine comments that it is significant that the sea is not mentioned 
in the new creation, for this indicates that all the turmoil and restlessness 
of human life will be missing in the new world.

Life in the City of God will be a perpetual sabbath in that every 

day will be given to the praise and glory of God. Life will be genuinely 

free, because it is set free from the slavery of sin. There is no sin in 

the City of God in the concept of Augustine, The will of man will no 

longer seek after evil but good only. It is impossible for God to sin 

due to his nature, and the partaker of God receives this inability from 

God.^" “Knowledge shall be perfected when we shall be perfectly at rest, 

and shall perfectly know that he is God.” 

The City of God is identified with the church of God in the theology 

of Augustine. Paradise is the church, and the church is the bride of Christ. 

Thus Paradise is the Church, as it is called in the Canticles; 
the four rivers of Paradise are the four gospels; the fruit trees 

the saints, and the fruit their works; the tree of life is the holy 

of holies, Christ; the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, 
the will f s free choice. For if man despise the will of God, he can 
only destroy himself; and so he learns the difference between 
consecrating himself to the common good and revelling in his own. 

The Church is the spiritual temple of God, and its glory far surpasses 

that of any earthly temple.^ Christ is the rock on which the church is 

built. However, the church on the earth has grown indiscriminately and the 

wicked are included with the elect. At the day of judgment the church will 

be cleansed, and she will be perfect as the City of God.^ Therefore, 

Augustine declares that the Church is an example of God bearing with 

the wicked. The endless glory of God is to be found in the Church which is 

the New Jerusalem.^ 

The Church, the kingdom over which Christ reigns, is his holy 
bride, his body of which he is the head. In its pilgrimage on earth the 
church is growing in the knowledge of God, bringing men to a unity of 
faith and knowledge in the Son of God. The Church developes to perfection 
through the grace of God and in the fulness of Christ. In this state of 
perfection it is the Kingdom of God come with glory, the kingdom of the ( 


presdnt as well as of the future where Christ reigns as King.^

At the end of time the church is going to be purified, and the saints 
of God are going to receive their reward* The wicked will be everlastingly 
punished and the Kingdom will have to come in with full power and glory. 

Creation will be perfect, and the image of God will be found in man in 
its completeness. 

The question of time is then raised. "When will all these things 
be?" is the question that is on the lips of the members of the church. Augustine 

answers these questions in part. He points out as did the early church 

fathers that there was an indefinite period of time before the creation of 

the earth. However, the world and time had one beginning. The one did not 

anticipate the other,' 1 2 3 4 ' In this setting it was not difficult for him to 
point out the literal shortness of the time fo the world.^ 

The Time of the Kingdom of God is also approaching when it will 
atte-in full glory. When David succeeded to the kingdom of the Jews "it was a staii 


ing point and beginning of the advanced youth of God*s people". The reign 

of Christ for the thousand years began with his advent on earth. Augustine 

declares that when the church calls him Lord, as did the early apostles, 

surely Christ is reigning. "The Church could not now be called his kingdom 

or the kingdom of heaven unless his saints were even now reigning with him."^ 

We must understand in one sense the kingdom of heaven in which 
exist together both he who breaks what he teaches and he who does 
it, the one being least, the other great, and in another sense the 
kingdom of heaven into which only he who does what he teaches ^ 
shall enter. Consequently, whereJboth classes exist, it is the 
Church as it now is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the 
Church as it is destined to be..... Accordingly, even now his saints 
reign with him. 4

The first resurrection has already taken place and there is War¬ 
fare with the enemy. This is the kingdom militant, which is car¬ 
rying on the warfare against the kingdom of the world. It is going 
to he victorious and usher in the period of peace, "The Church 
then, begins its reign with Christ now in the living and the dead." 

Christ died that he might he Lord both of the living arid the dead, 

1 

and this has now come to pass . Therefore blessed and holy is he 

that has part in the first resurrection. 

Now he who experiences it not only revives from the death 
of sin, hut continues in this renewed life. In these the 
second death has no power, 2 

Some of the saints did not live until the thousand years were com¬ 
pleted, hut they have not suffered the first death which is fatal 
and is of the soul. 


At the end of this period of the thousand years the devil 
shall he loosed for a short period of three and a half years. 
After this shall come the final judgment... Now things are in this 
order. 

And at or in connection with that judgment the following 
events shall come to pass, a.s we have learned: Elias the 
Tishhite shall come; the Jews shall believe; Antichrist 
sha.ll persecute; Christ shall judge; and the dead shall 
rise; the good and the wicked shall be separated; the 
world shall be burned and renewed. All these things 
shall come to pa,ss; but how, or in what order, human 
understanding cannot perfectly teach us, but only the 
experience of the events themselves. My opinion, how¬ 
ever, is they will happen in the order in which I. have 
given them 3*

This is Augustine*s concept of the Kingdom of God and time. The 
reign, "beginning at his baptism in the river Jordan; is in effect. 
The time of peace is upon the world; the release of the devil and 
the Antichrist is not far off; and after these events the final 
resurrection will take place together with the final judgment that 
marks the final victory and growth of the Kingdom of God. The 
first resurrection has already taken place. This is £he City of 
God that is about to complete its period of pilgrimage on earth. 

The number of the Sleet therefore cannot be very far off from 
completion. Behold the grace and glory of God to whom be all honor 
and power, and in whose hand is the final decision, and who alone 
knows the hour and the day.

CHAPTER XXVIII 

summary 

It is to "be observed that there were several concepts of the 

Kingdom of God that were held in the early Church. They were one in their 
thought of God as the creator of the universe, either through direct action 
on his part or through the Word which was identified with Jesus Christ. 

The earlier Fathers of the Church knew nothing of the Logos conception, 
and were interested primarily in asserting the Lordship of Christ and the 
absolute power of God. The later Fathers, especially Irenaeus and Origen, 
were concerned with the relationship between God and Christ ifho they 
believed was present with Cod in the beginning. 

God was also in control of history. Everything that occurred was 

under his watchful eye. He made and unmade nations, upheld empires. 

and called new civilizations into being. History was directed towards a 

purpose that was to find its culmination in the Kingdom of God. God was 

the potter, and man was merely the clay. Kings were not to boast of 

their power, for they were merely instruments in the hand of God, 

Shall an ax boast over the men that hews with it, 

Or a saw lord itself over the men that plies with it? 1 

The day was coming when their domains would pass away as darkness 

fades with the coming of light, and God would be supreme in the hearts 

and lives of men. They were merely serving the purpose of God in history. 


1. Isa. 10:i5 




-167- 


In currents of life, in tempests of motion, 

In fervour of act, in the fire, in the storm, 

Hither and thither, 

Over and under 
Vend I and wander: 

Sirth and the grave 
Limitless ocean, 

Where the restless wave 
Undulates ever, 

Under and over 
Their seething strife 
Heaving and weaving 
The changes of life. 

At' the whirring loom of Time unawed 
I work the living mantle of God. 1. 

Man, rather than working the mantle himself,is instead worked into the 

pattern of the garment. 

The Church Fathers were without exception agreed on the divinity 
of Christ. Some of their writings were directed against those who asserted 
that Christ was merely a phantom, or at the most a. man in every sense 
as human as they were. Tha Apologists were especially emphatic in 
combatting this heresy to state the divinity of Christ. If Christ was 
going to be King, then he also had to be divine. It was a divine Kingdom 
and demanded a ruler who was also divine. To deny the divinity of Christ 
was also to deny the resurrection. Christ was King. This was their 
universal creed of faith. He was King in the present as well as in the 
future. Origen and Justin Martyr speak of Christ as being King from the 
beginning of time. Augustine speaks of the commencement of his reign 
at the time of his baptism by John. The Christian is defined as one who 
acknowledges Christ as King, This was the creed that was to lead to the 
charge of Treason that was laid against the Christians , and was to provide 


an excuse for state persecution.

The early Church was also to "be found dm agreement on the statement 
that the Kingdom of God had already come. This was the gospel that they 
proclaimed, Chirist was King, and the Church was his visible kingdom 
on earth. Polycarp declared that the Christian owed allegiance to God 
rather than to men. Ignatius looked to Christ as his Lord and Master. 

Irenaeus spoke of the rule of Christ in the lives of his followers. Origen 
called on the Christians to separate themselves from those who were not 
members of the commonwealth of God that they might live as citizens of 
heaven. Augustine spoke of the City of God that was sojourning on the earth. 
There is no doubt that can be placed on their faith on this issue. The 
Kingdom of God existed in the present. 

A certain amount of disagreement is to be found in their ideas on 
the Kingdom of God which was to come, both as to the time of its coming 
and to those who were to form its citizens. The writers of the first 
century spoke as though they expected the immediate coming of the Kingdom 
in full power and glory. The later Fathers (Irenaeus, Origen, Augustine) 
laid greater emphasis on the Millenium. Hennas spoke of the Kingdom, 
which he identified with the church as did Augustine, as almost here. 

The building was nearly completed. Irenaeus writes of the six thousand 
years that are to pass from the time of creation to the Last Day, Augustine 
speaks of the thousand year reign of Christ which is now in effect. They 
are agreed on the fact that the Kingdom is going to come in with power 
and glory on a certain day which time God alone knows with certainty. 

Judgment was to come on the world at the last day. Their opinions 
differed as to the nature of this judgment. Augustine and Hennas thought 
of it as retributive judgment. On that day the wicked would be condemned 
and eternally punished. Origen thought of the judgment as being for corrective 
purposes, and as a time in which all would be suitably rewarded for their 
works. The wicked would be punished with the idea of a repentance and 


reformation that would lead to ultimate salvation,

Both Origen and Augustine believed that man had originally rebelled 
against God and therefore fallen from the original perfection of his 
creation. However, Augustine dates the fall of man from one act of 
disobediance, the historic fall of Adam who was the father of the human 
race, while Origen goes back to a pre-historic fall of each individual 
soul, making every individual responsible for the abuse of the freedom 
of will which r od had given man. Augustine proceeds, to a special election 
of a people of God from the condemned masses on the basis of the grace and 
mercy of God. Their number is limited to that of the fallen angels of God. 
Augustine ends with the contrast of an eternal heaven for the elect and 
an eternal hell for the wicked. Origen leads all men by a. slow process 
of correction under the influence of a redeeming mercy until the la.st 
enemy death itself is destroyed and man is restored to his original 
state of perfection. Augustine confines the Kingdom of God to the narrow 
limits of the Jewish state and the visible-Catholie Church. Origen extended 

the Kingdom of God ultimately to include all men. 

' 

The Kingdom of God contains absolute happiness for her inhabitants. 
Augustine and Origen both speak of the knowledge of God which will belong to 
all who are citizens in that realm. It is a kingdom of light rather than 
darkness. In the Kingdom men are obedient to the will of God because that 
is their nature. They do good and no longer seek after evil. In the 
fulness of perfection they have become God-like. It is the Kingdom of 
God and not the Kingdom of men. It is created by God and not made by man. 

These early writers were not bothered with the theory of realized 
eschatology as opposed to a futuristic conception of the kingdom. They 
thought of the kingdom as the rule of God through Christ. Therefore in

one sense the kingdom had already arrived. In another sense the kingdom 
is still to he established in full power. In that sense the kingdom will 
not come until the return of Christ in the Last Lay. 

They were anxious that God should rule in the lives of men and women. 
This was the emphasis and aim of their preaching. If God ruled in individual 
lives in the present life it was certain that they would belong to the 
kingdom that was to come. They were to live that their citizenship in 
Kingdom of Ood might be known through their works. Love and not hnte was 
to be the dominant note. They were to serve God rather than self, and o ey 
their Lord rather than men. They were to seek God in newness of life. God 
was a spirit, and it was necessary that they too become spiritual that they 
might belong to the kingdom. Belonging to God, theirs was the sure and 
certa-in hope of the resurrection which was to come: the resurrection of 
the body as well as of the soul. 

How glory and thanksgiving be unto that great God who 
waits not until Ee be perfectly seen and spoken of ere 
He begins to bless.

APPENDIX 


THE SERMON OP PAUL AT ATHENS 


It is not to be thought that Paul dismissed the idea of the 
coming of the Kingdom of God with judgment at a time appointed by- 
God. This note was never absent from his message. While his letters 
are largely concerned with special situations in the churches that he 
had founded it is not to be thought that the ethical teaching' takes 
precedence over his proclamation of the Kingdom of God or the coming 
day of judgment. 

So if we are God‘s children we ought not to imagine 
that the divine nature is like gold or silver or 
stone, wrought by human art or thought. While God 
overlooked those times of ignorance, he now calls 
upon all men everywhere to repent, since he has fixed 
a day on which he will justly judge the world through 
a man whom he has appointed, and whom he has guaranteed 
to all men by raising him from the dead. 

Acts 17:29-31.
