AN INVESTIGATION OF THE CHEMICAL 


AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ASH 
OF REPRESENTATIVE ALBERTA COALS 


CHAPTER I.- OUTLINE OF COAL TESTING 

Hist orical 

The history of man’s first use of coal is lost in the 
mists of prehistoric time, but we know that at an early date 
its wonderful properties were discovered and put to use. It 
has been said that modern civilization began with the inven^ 
tion of the steam engine. At least it is an admitted fact 
that this great agency, which man put to so many uses, created 
a great demand for coal, and gave at the same time a means of 
supplying that demand; for by its use alone was the raising 
of coal and water from a depth made possible. Following its 
development, the production of coal became a great industry, 
coal itself a most important article of international trade, 
and those countries which had large reserves of this commodity 
automatically took a leading place in the economic and industrial 
world. 

As time went on, the buyers of coal learned by experience 
that there was a great difference in coal from different places, 
and in recent years methods of testing coal have been developed

so that the intelligent buyer may obtain a good idea of what 
he is getting. Here in Alberta to-day we have great stores 
of coal of different kinds, and it is essential, if we are to 
realize the prestige and benefits that they can confer on us, 
that we thoroughly test our coals and establish their good 
properties. 

The Scope Of This Thesis 

As a part of this plan, the work described below is an 
application to representative Alberta coals of one of the more 
recently developed of these tests, viz., THE DETERMINATION OF 
THE SOFTENING TEIiPERATUIS OF COAL ASH. An endeavor is made to 
establish a relation between the theoretical results obtained 
in the laboratorj^ and the formation of clinker when the coals 
are burned in practice. A discussion of the general problem 
of clinker formation is included, and also of the improvement 
in the clinker trouble likely to be effected by washing the 
coal. The chemical analyses of typical samples of ash are 
given. 

Earlier tests fall under three main headingsJ- Ultimate 
Analysis, Heating Value, and Proximate Analysis. 

The Ultimate Analysis 


This was an outgrowth of the development of modern chemistry.

and consisted in resolving the combustible portion of the coal 
into its elements, consisting mainly of carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, with smaller amounts of sulfur and nitrogen. This test 
is not much used by present day purchasers. 

The Estimation Of The Heating Value 

This very important test determines the heating value of 
the coal in terras of B.t.u.’s, which are defined as the amount 
of heat required to raise one pound of v/ater through one degree 
Fahrenheit. Roughly speaking, this test is carried on by igniting 
a small amount of coal in an atmosphere of oxygen, and measuring 
the amount of heat given off. The figure for Alberta coals 
varies over wide limits from 7»000 to 14,000 B.t.u.’’s per pound 
on the basis of the coal as received. The general rule can be 
stated! that, of coals which can be obtained at the same price 
per ton, one should purchase that which has the greatest heating 
value =•» or, in other words, the higher B.t.u.’s. 

The Proximate Analysis 

This test is applied to all coalsj and in it the coal is 
divided into four arbitrarily defined parts, on a percentage 
basis, known respectively as;“ 

(a) The Moisture Content, or water present in the 

coal, obtained by drying the coal for 1 hour at 105®C. 

(b) The Ash Content,or matter left after combustion

of the coal; 

(c) The Volatile Matter, obtained by heating the 

coal at about 950®C. for 7 minutes, with a provision 
for preliminary heating of high moisture coals; the 
loss in weight, less the moisture, being termed the 
volatile matter;. 

(d) The Fixed Carbon, being the difference between 

the sum of the other three and 100.

In the process of combustion, all but the ash pass off 
as gases, but the ash has to be disposed of mechanically; s© 
that, generally speaking, it was considered wise, given a 
choice of coals at the same price per heat unit (such as, 

30 cents per 1,000,000 B.t.u.®s) to choose the one with the 
least ash content. 

The latter choice is, however, modified by the fact that 
in the furnace the ash sometimes melts and forms a hard, solid 
mass, termed clinker. The tendency to do this bears no relation 
to the amount of ash in the coal (See Figure 30? is an 
inherent property of the individual coal, and related mostly

to its chemical composition, but also dependent on other 
factors» 

These other factors, as listed by Mr. E. B. Ricketts, 
chairman of the Sub-committee on Fusibility of Coal Ash 
Co-ordination of the American Society for Testing Materials, 
are;- 

(1) The caking qualities; 

(2) The manner in which the ash-forming material exists 

in the coal; 

(3) The manner in which it conglomerates; 

(4) The temperature of the fuel bed; 

(5) The time it is subject to this temperature; 

(6) The size of the particles; 

(7) The association of the particles. 

This report was presented to the Society at their annual 
meeting in 19 23> and shows that the problem has a great vBri€?ty 
of factors, calling for much investigs.tion and research.

CHAPTER II.- CLINKER AND ITS OCCURRENCE 

Int roduct ion 

A broad division can be made between two main types of 
clinker: first, the large, porous masses known as "soft clinker”? 
which give little trouble; and, second, the hard, solid mass 
fomed by ash which has been heated till almost liquid and cools 
to a compact glassy mass which adheres to grates and cuts off 
the draft or causes trouble v;ith the refractories. The effect 
of this clinker differs with the methods of stoking, and these 
will be considered separately. 

Hand -Fired Furnaces 

In a furnace of this type, the clinker is allowed t© 
gradually accumulate on the grate till the depth of the refuse 
interferes with the draft. Owing to the grates being covered 
with clinker, unfused ash is unable to fall through, and the 
major portion of the ash has to be raked out by hand, involving 
a large amount of labor for the fireman, VJhil© this operation 
is being carried out, the doers of the furnace are open, and 
the cooling due to this, results in a drop in steam pressure, 
the loss in the average efficiency from this cause being as 
high as 5 to 10^. Cases are on record where coals giving bad 
clinker trouble have had to be cleaned every other hour.

PLATE I.- HARD Ai^D SOFT CLINKER FORllATIONS 







- 7 - 

With coking coals it is hard for the fireman to distinguish 
between coke and clinker, with the result that an amount of 
the former is raked out with the clinker and is lost as fuel. 

On refiring there is also a loss of fuel, due to fines falling 
through the grate, and in some cases low volatile coal will 
not pick up quickly after the cleaning. Despite these disad¬ 
vantages, however, this type of firing is practically a neces¬ 
sity with coking coals, which must be sliced at intervals to 
break up the coke. Lignite coals, on the other hand, do not 
coke, and therefore do not need to be sliced. The practice, 
indeed, results in heavy clinker formation. This is due in 
part to the facts that;- 

Mixing the ash particles tends to lower the fusion point; 

The fused ash, already in ideal proportions, is brought into 
the hottest part of the fire, where it readily liquefies and 
absorbs unfused ash; 

Its place on the grate is taken by other clinker, so that 
there is a layer on the grates and more in the fuel bed| 

A system of shaking grates reduces the trouble by causing 
the finer ash to fall through, so lessening the ash above the 
grates; but this will not work economically where there is much 
fine coal being fired. Spraying water or steam on the grates, 
or keeping water in the ash pit tends to lessen the amount of 
clinker, owing to the cooling effect on the grates and also in 
part to the fact that the water gas produced is burned in the

combustion chamber above the coal, the reaction that forms the 
gas absorbing heat from the coals; both of v;hich factors tend 
to lov/er the temperature of the fuel bed. 

An analysis of the figures in Bulletin 27 of the Mines 
Branch, Ottawa, quoted above, bears out the statements v/ith 
regard to loss of combustible matter and to the proportion 
of the ash above the grates when using a hand»fired furnace 
under different conditions. 

Overhead Stokers 

The above remarks apply alec to those types which have 
stationary grates and which require the removal of the ash 
by hand. 

Chain Grate Stokers 

In this form of stoker the clinker is, theoretically, 
carried over the end of the grate and dumped with the con-* 
tinuous revolution of the grate, thus doing away with the 
operation of cleaning the fire that is essential to hand“fired 
furnaces. In both types, however, the clinker sometimes sticks 
to the refractories; and in the chain grate stoker this is 
a serious matter, for the mass attached to the side wall 
bunches the coal in the middle of the grate, where it becomes 
so thick that it is not all burned and a portion is carried

over into the dump. In addition, on that part of the grate 
behind the clinker, the coal having been swept off, the air 
rushes through, and cools the tubes, causing a drop in steam 
pressure. The masses attached to the wall are often so securely 
set that they have to be knocked off with a hammer, and they 
often drag a portion of a brick out with them. This action 
on the refractories is probably the most serious of the effects 
of clinker formation, and often necessitates the rebuilding 
of a furnace wall in the course of a few years. 

Methods of lessening this trouble with the refractories 
include:- 

1. The thickening of the fuel bed at the side of the grate. 

This method is in use with considerable success at the University 
of Alberta Power Plant. 

2. The building of a false wall of either hollow tile ©r brick 
along the edge of the chain grate. The wall is kept cool by 

a circulation of air, which, however, may cool the furnace if 
too much is allowed to flov/ into the combustion chamber, or, 
if allowed to pass out, occasions a distinct loss of heat. 

3. Another method is to run a water tube along the wall, 
just along the side of the grate, but such a tube is liable 
to suffer from excessive seal© trouble. 

All of these methods are based on the theory of cooling 
the wall, and so preventing it from softening sufficiently for 
the clinker to stick to it.

4. An entirely different method of handling the trouble is 
based on the fact that the edges of the brick soften first; and 
it endeavors to solve the problem by using large bricks, three 
feet or more in length, thus lessening the liability of union 
between clinker and soft brick. Much the es.me effect can be 
achieved by lining the furnace with a layer of cement, but this 
is soon scaled off by removal of adhering clinker so that the 
bricks are exposed after a comparatively short time. 

Underfeed Stokers 

In the Jones type the chief difficulty with clinker is 
the cutting off of the draft by the liquid clinker flowing 
into the orifices. Moving grates are not used. Other under* 
feed types, such as the Taylor, have some difficulty with 
clinker adhering to the side walls as well. 

Powdered Coal 

This method of burning coal has recently been developed 
to a large extent. The coal is powdered and blown into the 
fire box by an air stream. This condition of fine division 
and intimate mixing is an ideal one for a low fusion temperature 
when there is an excess of the more readily fusible materisJ, 
as is likely to be the case with low ash coals , but not in coals 
carrying a high content of siliceous material. (See below,

particularly Cadomin ash, under "Constitution of the Ash.”) 

As might be expected from this type of coal, considerable diffi¬ 
culty has been encountered. In some cases a solid mass of 
clinker formed on the tubes, cutting down the transference of 
heat; and also at first much trouble was caused by the clinker 
forming on the bottom of the fire box in a solid mass that 
could not be removed. This difficulty has been overcome to a 
large extent by the introduction of the so-called v/ater screen, 
which is really a series of water tubes occupying the space 
normally occupied by the grate. They are in connection with 
the boiler, and serve to cool the falling ash so that it is 
no longer liquid when it reaches the bottom. (See SavagesH.D.; 
Engineering Journal of Canada, June, I 923 O 

General G 0 nsiderati 0 ns 

Clinker trouble is aggravated as a general rule by running 
at high ratings or under any other circumstances which tend to 
raise the temperature of the fuel bed. 

With good draft control most of the ash is normally cooled 
before it becomes liquid and can choke up the grates. If, 
however, anything interferes with this condition, such as too 
thick a fuel bed, leaky walls, or poor draft in the flue, the 
ash may not be cooled sufficiently to prevent the formation of 
much hard clinker on the grates; and as this clinker cuts the 
draft in its turn, the effect is an accumulative one.

Bone, in "Coal and Its Scientific Uses", page 47, says: 
"It is commonly agreed that salty coals produce a far more 
rapid corrosion of the refractory oven walls than those that 
are comparatively free from salty constituents." This effect 
is much the same in the combustion chamber. Such salty con¬ 
stituents may come from the coal, or from a water it is washed 
with, or from the water sprayed on it before feeding, this 
being a common practice to keep slack coal together till it 
is ignited. The effect of these salty coals increases with 
the amount of moisture present, which in some way aids in the 
transference of alkaline elements to the refractories, where 
they form a glaze which is brittle and easily broken by the 
wear of the clinker, the v;all being thus gradually eaten av;ay. 

The use of slack coal as a rule results in the formation 
of more clinker than lump coal from the same mine. Primarily, 
this is due to the fact that slack generally has a higher ash 
content, but other factors also enter in. When slack is used, 
the same rate of firing results in a thinner and hotter fire, 
and the higher temperature will result in more clinker. The 
slack packs closer together, also, and if fed too thickly will 
choke the draft to some extent, and may prevent a measure of 
the cooling action referred to above. Sinatt tested the sof¬ 
tening tenperature of the ash from different commercial grades 
of the same coal, and found that, the finer the coal, the lower 
the softening temperature, was the rule, ^^e gives figures

shov/ing the softening temperatures of lump coal, slack coal, 
and slurry from the same mine^ and in the three cases quoted 
there was a decrease, in the order given, of the softening 
temperature. He mentions that the slack and slurry were v/ashed, 
but does not discuss the bearing of this on the softening 
temperature, and it will be shown below that this is sometimes 
quite significant. When the softening temperature of the ash 
is lower in the fine coal, it will be due, most likely, to the 
better mixing of the ash constituents if there is an excess of 
low fusing components. (See above, "Powdered Coal”, and below, 
"Constitution of the Ash”^ Sinatt; Coll.Guard., Jul.' 23 ,p-21.) 

There would appear to be a widespread opinion among fire™ 
men that the use of damp or wet coal increases the tendency to 
clinker. This has not been verified, and if wet coal has this 
effect, no satisfactory explanation has been found. Attention 
might be drawn, in this connection, to the action of the water 
sprayed on the grs-tes, as mentioned above, by which the tendency 
to clinker is lessened; and to the part played by the moisture 
content with salty coals, mentioned above. This would suggest 
the use of steam for dampening the coal. There is also the 
possibility that the moisture in the coal causes it to break 
up more rapidly , exposing fresh surfaces to combustion very 
quickly, and setting the volatile matter free sooner than it 
is given up by dry coal. These factors would increase the 
ten^erature of the fire, and so the amount of clinker.

These are some of the msmifestations of the clinker problem 
which have caused much investigation and experimentation, 
leading finally to the Standard Method for the determination of 
the softening, tenpero-ture of coal ash. An historical outline 
of the more important of these researches is given immediately 
below.

CHAPTER III.- THE DETERMINATION OF THE 
SOFTENING TEMPERATURE OF COAL ASH. 

Hietorical 

In 1895 and 1897 Prost tested a number of Belgian coals, 
placiTig a few grams in a porcelain crucible, and heating the 
ash to different temperatures estimated by means of gold and 
platinum alloys. He obtained different temperatures with 
different gases, and v/as not successful in relating the softening 
temperature to the chemical composition of the ash. 

In 1902 Chatelier introduced the Seger cone comparison 
method for estimation of the fusing point of coal ash. He made 
his cones with an oi^ganic binder, and took as the softening 
point the temperature when they had become half their initial 
height. 

In 1904 Cobb used small pyramids, and a pyrometer for 
measuring the temperature. He called attention to the fact 
that a regular rate of heating was essential to check results. 

In 1910 Bailey and Calkins, and also Hitchcock, after 
estimating the softening temperature of two coals, fired them 
in a hand fired Dutch oven. They found a general agreement 
between softening temperature and clinkering properties. Bailey 
concludes that "the main factor in the formation of clinker is 
the difference between the fusing temperature of the ash and 
the temperature to which it is subjected. Any factor such as

excess air, rate of combustion, s.nd thickness of fuel bed, 
which will affect the tenperature, may cause a corresponding 
change in the amount and nature of the clinker from a given 
coal.” 

In 1910 Stansfield, v/orking on Canadian coals, used 
cylinders of ash; but he could not see them at high temperatures, 
and so adopted the method of heating separate cylinders of the 
same ash to different temperatures as determined with a Morse 
optical pyrometer. He found it difficult to see much connection 
between his results and the data taken on clinker formation 
at boiler trials on the same coals. 

In 1910 Marks, using a cone method, mixed various foreign 

substances with the same ash. He found that aluminium oxide 
softening 

raised the/temperature of the ash; while other substances, 
including CaO, Fe 203 , Fe, FeS 2 , CaS 2 , CaS 04 , distOTBiEadmtto 
lowered the softening temperature. Of these latter, iron sulphide 
had the most effect. 

In 1913 Constam, working with 200 different European coals, 
measured the temperature of initial deformation of the cone, 
and the temperature of fluid point, with an optical pyrometer. 

He concluded thatJ- 

The proportion of ash does not influence the softening 
temperature unless slate or pyrite are present. 

The softening temperature is characteristic of the seam. 

The softening ten?)erature ranges from II 50 to 1700®C.

In 1914 L. S. Marks called attention to differences of 
as much as 390 ® obtained for the same ash in different laboratories, 
He himself obtained more than 250 ® difference on the same sample 
in two different types of furnace. He finally adopted a method 
of mounting cones in a horizontal position, heating them at the 
rate of 2 ® a minute, measuring the temperature with a thermo¬ 
couple, and maintaining an oxidizing atmosphere. Comparing his 
results v/ith actual clinker formation, he concludes that a 
general relation v;as shown between the two, but not definite 
enough to be reliable. 

In 1914 Hubbley brought out a fusiometer which recorded 
the shrinking of a cone, showing its relative viscosity and final 
collapse jOn a scale. The method was fairly successful, but 
depended more or less on its particular set-up, and could not 
necessarily be duplicated in other laboratories. 

In 1915 Palmenberg mounted cones in the middle of a muffle 
of a meker furnace, and took as the softening temperature the 
time at which the cone had bent till it touched the base. 

In 1915 Ricketts mounted the cones horizontally in a 
fired 

hessian crucible in a gas/melting furnace, ^e observed the cones 

/\ 

by means of a quartz tube through the side of the furnace and 
the crucible. The teir?)erature of fusion was taken when the cone 
reached a 45 ® position. This method gave uniformly good results. 

Cameron of Saskatoon did some work on Alberta coals, but 
his results are not available.

Development Of The Standard Method 

Because of the importance of the clinkering problem, as 
pictured above, and because different workers got such widely 
differing results when testing the same coal in an endeavor 
to determine its clinkering tendency, the Bureau of Mines, 
Washington, was induced to study the question and to try to 
develop a method for testing coal that would give check results 
and thst would give a comparative measure of the softening 
teii5)8rature of the particular ash being tested* The work was 
carried out at the Pittsburg Station of the Bureau of Mines, 
under the direction of Mr* Fieldnar, Some of the experiments 
are reported in the Journal of Industrial & Engineering Chemistry 
for 1915, PP« 399 =*474, and another description of the work is 
given in Bulletin No. 129 of the Bureau of Mines, Washington* 

They conducted a number of experiments with a variety of 
furnaces, including;* 

1. Platinum wire resistance furnace, with atmosphere of air; 

2. Meker muffle furnace, with atmosphere of air and combustion 

gases 

3. Muffle No.2, with atmosphere of air and combustion gases; 

4. Molybdenum wire resistance furnace, atmosphere H2 or H2 & H2O 

5. Granular carbon resistance furnace, atmosphere CO; 

6. Northrup graphite resistance furnace, atmosphere CO. 

They found that they could get the best checks in an 

atmosphere of air or in a strongly reducing atmosphere, as in

the carbon resistance furnaces, but that the results were uni¬ 
formly higher than in the moderately reducing atmospheres of 
the muffle types. Results varied between the types by a large 
amount, being roughly from 130 to 325®C, This was traced to 
the iron content of the ash, and it was found that the lowest 
results were obtained in the furnaces where the iron was reduced 
to the ferrous state, while in the other furnaces,where the iron 
was reduced to the metallic state or left in the ferric condition, 
results were uniformly higher. The method of preparation of the 
ash, the shape, size, and inclination of the cones, the rate of 
heating, and the effect of different reducing atmospheres, such 
as mixfcui'^s o f CO and CO 2 , and of H 2 and water vapor, were all 
studied. 

From these experiments and others that showed that the 
iron in clinkers was principally in the ferrous state, together 
with the knowledge that the greater portion of the fuel bed was 
subject to a reducing atmosphere, they concluded that such a 
reducing atmosphere was essential to secure results comparable 
with actual furnace conditions . It was found that the desired 
degree of reduction was obtained with from 30/® to 70 ^ of re- 
ducing gases present, and that this ratio was produced by an 
atmosphere of combustion gases such as were found in a muffle 
furnace. Other conclusions were: that the cones should be 
mounted vertically, and should not be slender, as they would 

then have a tendency to premature bending because they were 
weak structui*ally; and that they should be of a size that would

fuse to a ball rather than bend over; and that a variation between 
5 and 10® per minute in the rate of heating made no appreciable 
difference in the softening temperature. (Bulletin 129, U.S. 

Bureau of Mines, Washington.) 

The Standard Method A. S.T. M. D-22«23* 

These results were embodied in a tentative method that was 
later adopted as standard by the American Society for Testing 
Materials in 1923 • This is briefly as follows:- 

The sample of powdered coal is ignited in fireclay dishes in 
an electric muffle furnace till completely oxidized. The temperature 
is kept at about 800 to 850®C. to prevent premature fusion. The ash 
is then ground in a silica mortar till it passes a 200-mesh sieve, 
and is then ignited in a current of oxygen for two hours to insure 
complete and uniform oxidation. The ash, of which about 10 grams is 
required, is moistened with 10^ dextrin solution, and molded into 
cones formed as three-sided pyramids, 3/4-ins. high, and l/4-in. 
along the sides at the base. This is done by pressing the plastic 
ash into a brass mold of the dimensions given. The cones are then 
mounted on an alundum or other refractory base, and heated to dull 
red heat for a half-hour to remove all carbonaceous material. 

The base and cones are then placed in a specially fitted 
no.3 Melter’s furnace. (See Fig. I. and Plate I., page 23*) 

The fittings consist of two nested crucibles: C, the inner one, 













- 22 


and B, the outer, which acts as a muffle. The lai^er one has 
two holes; one, E, for observation; and the otheri in the same 
plane and at right angles to it, for a pyrometer tube and a 
blowing tube, F. The holes in the crucible are matched by similar 
holes in the wall of the furnace, E and I. This type of furnace 
is fitted with three tangential burners, which heat the crucible 
very uniformly, and at high heats the cones, D, mounted on the 
base, H, cannot be seen. They are brought into view by a 
momentary blast through the tube F, connected with the air 
supply. A reducing atmosphere is maintained by burning an excess 
of gas over air, so that a flame at least six inches high is 
obtained above the furnace. The rate of heating above 800®C. 
is between 5 and 10®C. per minute. The cones are viewed by 
means of a silica observation tube cemented into the furnace 
wall and fitted with a thin glass cover. The temperature is 
measured by a thermocouple or optical pyrometer. Readings are 
made every other minute, and the points noted:- 

1. \^ere there is the first perceptible bending of the cone. 
This is called the "temperature of initial deformation.” 

2. Where the cone has fused down to a spherical ball, or 
where it has bent to touch the base. This is called the 
"softening temperature.” 

3. Where the cone has become fluid and spread out on the base. 
This is called the "fluid temperature." 

The range of temperature between the first and second points is

knovm as the "softening interval", and that between the second 
and third points is called the "fluid interval." The intervals 
are important as a measure of the comparative viscosity of the 
melting cone. 

Comments On The Standard Method 

One or two slight variations in the procedure were intro 
duced. In the initial heating, silica dishes were substituted 
for fireclay, since these frequently broke, and the sample had 
to be discarded ov/ing to the introduction of foreign matter. 

The silica dishes had a very much longer life. Moreover, when 
a particle came off the silica dish, it was generally in the 
form of a flake and easily detected, or if so small as to be 
missed it was an addition to the constituent already present in 
the greatest proportion and so caused the least possible per® 
centage error. In both kinds of dish there was a deposit of 
ferruginous material, but in the silica dishes this appeared 
to be smaller although they were in use longer. 

Ignition for two hours in oxygen did not seem to be suf*” 
ficient time, judging by the mottled color effects that were 
produced. To prolong the time or to use less ash in a dish meant 
the use of more oxygen, but the same result \ms achieved by 
giving the ash a long preheating in the muffle before the oxygen 
was turned on. 

Silica and Impervalite porcelain tubes were used for the 













- 25 “ 

air blast, the foraer having a much longer life than the porce¬ 
lain, though this was not long in either case* '^'he silica was 
difficult to pierce* The method finally used was to grind more 
than half-way through the tube with the edge of an emery wheel, 
and finish with the edge of a new triangular file. The impervalite 
tubes were readily prepared with a file. The life of both tubes 
was prolonged by putting around them a band of fireclay or alundum 
cement at the place where they were exposed to the direct flame. 

This served to keep them from bending at the high temperatures* 
Bending caused a displacement of the air blast, and, when pronounced, 
the tube sometimes fused with the Isrge inside crucible. Subsequent 
cooling, or jarring of the crucible in opening it after a run, 
would often break the tube. 

It was found very beneficial to cover the top of the inner 
crucible with pure granular alundum* This neither fused nor 
caked at the temperatures reached, and neither the tubes nor 
the cone bases stuck to this inner cover, which formed the floor 
of the muffle. Bone ash and pure calcium oxide were tried, but 
neither were successful at the high temperatures. 

It was also found essential to use some means of absorbing 
the vibration set up by the fan and motor, or else it shook the 
furnace* This was accomplished by the introduction of a piece 
of heavy hose in the air line. Previously the vibration had had 
the effect of tipping over unsteady cones, and of breaking the 
blowing tube. 

Another precaution necessary was to obtain an air-tight

seal around the cover glass. Two methods were tried; asbestos 
packing, followed by a clamp and cement; or straight cement 
holding the brass sleeve to the silica tube. The latter was 
simpler, and seemed to give just as satisfactory results. 

Accuracy Of The Method 

The figure reported is in every case the mean of at least 
two runs in the furnace, and from three to five cones were 
used for each sample. Check readings on the point of initial 
deformation and on the fluid temperature were sometimes hard 
to get, because the first readings were lowered by warping of 
the cone, or by deformation due to structural defects, or 
warping following a strong blast from the air tube. The same 
readings might be raised by cones shrinking in on themselves 
without bending at all. In this case the point where the 
shrinking was first definitely noticed was taken as the point 
of initial deformation. 

In the case of the fluid temperature, cones would sometimes 
go out of signt, but an examination of the plate after the 
furnace had cooled would reveal that they had been barely liquid. 
Since two kinds of cones were mounted at once to save time, this 
check was only available on the highest melting cones unless 
both varieties were fluid at the same temperature. When the 
difference was very great, one set of residues was often volati¬ 


lized

In the case of softening temperatures, exact checks were 
often obtained, and the range rarely exceeded 10°C.. It is 
probable that the limit of error on this reading was not more 
than 10®C.. The A.S*T.M. specifications allow a tolerance of 
30® for the same operator, and the results are certainly well 
within this limit. 

The runs were all conducted with the same relative excess 
of gas over air to produce the necessary reducing atmosphere; 
and the same kind of gas, Viking natural gas, was used for 
every determination. 

In all the tests the same optical pyrometer was used. It 
was of the Leeds & Northrup type, the measurement depending 
on the matching of the color of a loop of wire, heated to in** 
candescence by a measured current, with the color of the body 
whose ten^jerature was to be measured. The instrument has a 
range of 500®C. on its scale, but this is extended by the use 
of a color filter which absorbs some of the rays, giving lower 
readiiigs, and so enabling higher temperatures to be estimated. 
In use, the lower range runs from 800®C. to 1350®^., and the 
higher range from 1250®C. to 1700®C, In practice, the change 
was always made at 1300®C.. In this particular instrument there 
was a lag of about 25® between the ranges. It was checked by 
estimating the fusing temperature of pure strips of copper and 
nickel wire. The copper melts at 1083®C. , and the average 
reading was 1085®C. The nickel melts at 1452®C., and the

average readings were about 25° low. Considering the lag above 
mentioned between the two ranges, and the lag on the melting 
point of pure nickle, all temperatures estimated on the high 
range were given a plus correction of 25°• 

This method of testing by means of copper and nickel is 
recommended by the Bureau in Bulletin 129» l>ut no specifications 
as to the method are given. It is justified, because in the 
furnace a reducing atmosphere is maintained, and very little 
oxide of the metal is formed. In these tests pieces of wire 
of about 26 ”gauge were used. 

Readings on the instrument were always taken in the ss^me 
\my, and in all cases only those were accepted which checked 
within 2® on the scale. This corresponds to from 3 to 7°C., 
depending on the temperature. 

Other Recent Methods 

At least two other furnace designs have been described 
since the A.S.T.M. published its tentative standard. 

A micropyrometer furnace was described by Fieldner, Selvig 
and Parker. (J.Ind.& Eng.Chem., June, 1922, p.6950 'Ibis method 
consists of fusing a small amount of ash on a strip of platinum 
which serves as a heating element. The platinum is enclosed 
in a small alundum furnace mounted on the stage of a microscope 
which has an attachment fitted with a tungsten filament. The 
operator watches the progress of fusion of the ash through the

microscope, and the filament is used to estimate the ten^erature 
in the manner of an optical pyrometer, the filament being matched 
with a spot on the platinum strip beside the fusing ash. An oxi¬ 
dizing atmosphere is normally present,, or the gases from a muffle 
furnace can be aspirated through the alundum furnace to get a 
reducing atmosphere similar to that of the standard method. 

Advantages claimed are the ease and quickness of the method, 
and the comfort of the operator. 

Compared to the results obtained with the standard method, 
the micropyrometer furnace gives a v/ide difference in an oxidizing 
atmosphere. With a reducing atmosphere, however, for ash of 
medium fusibility, the results are quite comparable. Ashes of 
low fusibility gave higher results, and those of high fusibility 
gave lower results. No definite conclusions were reached. 

Another type of furnace was described by Mr. Sinatt, of 
the Lancashire & Cheshire Coal Research Board, in a paper delivered 
before the Manchester section of the Society of Chemical Industry 
(abstracted in Colliery Guardian, July, 19 23, p.21.). He uses a 
silica tube as a muffle furnace, and heats the tube by means of 
an oxyhydrogen blowpipe. The ash is pressed into small cylinders, 
and mounted on a strip of platinum foil which is cleaned with 
hydrofluoric acid. The temperature is measured with a thermocouple, 
but no mention is made of any difficulty in seeing the cylinders. 

No provision is made for a reducing atmosphere, which would seem 
to be a grave defect. Fusions of standard cones quoted in the 
paper also gave wide variations from normal. Presumably some

modification could be made to insure a reducing atmosphere 
similar to the one described by Fieldner above, or by a mixture 
of hydrogen and water vapor; but possibly these would cut off 
the view of the cylinder. Advantages are the small amount of 
ash necessary, and the cheapness of the furnace. Ho comparisons 
with the standard American method are given, though one was 
obtained in this work. (See below, "Constitution of the Ash.) 











- 31 - 


CHAPTER IV.- SOURCE OF SAMPLES INVESTIGATED 

The ash of a coal is the matter left after complete ignition^ 
and is to be distinguished from the mineral matter originally 
in the coal, as certain constituents such as chlorides, carbon¬ 
ates, and sulphur, are more or less completely volatilized when 
the coal is burned. The ash comes from three distinct sources, 
which may be divided as follows. 

1. The intrinsic ash, which is formed by the mineral matter 
derived from the original coal-foming plants, together with 
external matter intimately mixed with the deposits during their 
format io n. 

2. The extraneous ash, due to impurities laid down as partings, 
veins, and nodules, either at the time of deposition or by in¬ 
filtration at later dates. These are composed mostly of clay, 
shale, slate, pyrite, or calcite. 

3* The third source of ash is the mechanical mixture of frag¬ 
ments of the roof and floor due to the method of mining. 

Ash from sources 2 and 3 can often be reduced by a process 
of washing, but this has little or no effect on the amount of 
intrinsic ash. Fieldner (Bulletin 129? U.S.Bureau of Mines, 
p.l4.) says: "Such extraneous impurities as sandstone or shale 
tend to raise the softening temperature . Limestone and pyrite 
tend to lower it, although limestone, if added in excess, will 
raise the softening temperature." 

In Alberta, pyrite is only present in small amounts, and

most of the coal beds lie between strata of sandstone or shale, 
so that low-ash coals should presumably have lower softening 
temperatures than those with high ash. Clinker formation, too, 
is apparently due in a large degree to the amount of low-fusing 
constituents that the ash contains. (See "Constitution of Ash", 
below.) For these reasons, therefore, it is considered that 
a sample’ from coal with little ash will give a better indication 
of its potential clinkering properties than a commercial sample 
with a greater amount of extraneous matter included* 

The securing of representative samples, the first part of 
the work, vms undertaken by the Scientific & Industrial Research 
Council of Alberta. Most of them were taken from the larger 
samples sent in by the provincial mine inspectors, who personally 
take the sanroles in the mines. In most cases the remarks 
accompanying these samples point out that they are quite repre¬ 
sentative of the coal as shipped, with the one exception, that 
no matter from the roof or floor is introduced. A few of the 
samples were obtained from the commercial samples supplied to 
the Council at different times, and these are possibly more 
representative, though this is open to question. 

The general plan followed in this investigation was to 
examine at least two samples from each of the more important 
producing areas, and one from the smaller ones, where possible. 
Thirty-three samples in all were taken from the different parts 
of the province. They are divided as follows:-

The map of Alberta coal areas, recently compiled by Dr. 

Allan, shows 36 divisions, while only 20 were sampled. Owing, 
however, to the fact that some areas produce little or nothing, 
the samples taken are quits representative of the province. 

This is brought out by an analysis of the tonnage reports, as 
published by the Mines Branch, Alberta, for 19 22, the latest 
figures available. In that year the areas sampled produced 
100^ of the bituminous coal, 99^ of the sub-bituminous coal, 
and 95^ of the lignite coal mined in the province. There was 
no anthracite being mined during the period when samples were 
being secured. These figures would indicate that the province 
was thoroughly sampled. 

From these samples of coal, the ash was prepared as de¬ 
scribed abovej and since it was thought that l^d^er work might 
be done on the ash, large amounts, from 30 to 50 grams of each 
sampke, were prepared. Samples were taken of 8,11 the coals

CHAPTERV.- INVESTIGATION OF PHYSICAL 
PROPERTIES OF ASH SAMPLES 

Bone, in his book , "Coal And Its Scientific Uses”, says; 
"Variations may occur both in amount and character of the ash 
content along a particular seam. Such differences are usually 
gradual as long as they relate to the same horizon of the seam, 
but they may be abrupt in a vertical direction, especially when 
successive layers shov/ marked differences in texture." 

From this we may conclude that the physical properties, 
including the softening temperature of the ash, of sanples 
from the same area would be very similar if the samples represent 
the same seam, providing the distance between the points on the 
seam is not too great, and that each sample represents the whole 
seam. 

The results of the investigations into the physical properties 
of the ash samples, together with the conclusions drawn from them, 
have been divided for convenience into three groups, as follows,*- 

1. Conclusions depending on the COLOR of th© ash; 

2. Conclusions depending on the SOFTENING TEfvIPERATURE of th© ash 

3* Conclusions depending on the CONSTITUTION of the ash* 

These will now be considered in the order given. 

Conclusions Depending On Color 


The similarity in properties forecasted above was first 







- 38 - 


brought out in a distinctive manner by the color assumed by 
the ash, following its ignition in oxygen. The colors ranged 
through deep chocolate, buff-red, tan, yellow, cream, and grey. 

In the areas from which duplicate samples were taken, the 
colors compared favorably, on the whole, as shown in Table II. 

TABLE II.- DIFFERENCES IN COLOR OF ASH SAMPLES 
FROM THE SAME AREAS 


Penn & Twin City, similar; Cardiff, distinctly different® 

Galt & Coalhurst, similar. 

Alix & Ardley, similar. 

Carbon & Three Hills, similar; Rumsey, distinctly different. 
Mercoal & Foothills, similar; Sterling, distinctly different. 
Greenhill & Hillcrest, similar. 

Luscar & Cadomin, slightly different® 

TITayne & Drumlieller, distinctly different® 

Dobell & To field, distinctly different. 

Spicer & D inant , distinctly different. 

In only the last two cases is there a distinct difference in 
color recorded between samples that are from the same seam, while 
in most cases where the color is the same, the identity of the 
seam is fairly well established. 

In the two cases just mentioned, the Tofield and Camrose 
areas, the samples show in each case a difference in color, though 
the mines are on the same seam. The ash content is approximately 
the same, and they are quite close geographically. There is no 
known fault between the mines in either case, but both coal beds

lie close to the surface. In the Tofield area the cover is only 
15 feet, and at Camrose, 30 feet. It is possible that this strata 
has allov/ed a seepage of vrater into a portion of the coal seam, 
which might change the color of the ash, or that at some time 
part of this cover was eroded away, and the coal exposed to the 
v/eather or to iron-bearing waters. A suggestion of this latter 
idea is conveyed in the remarks of the sampling inspector, who 
notes in one case that in some parts of the mine the slips are 
colored yellow. This would appear to be worthy of further investi¬ 
gation, for it might be possible to use the color scheme for 
identifying seams. 

The color of an ash is due, presumably, to its various con¬ 
stituents, of which the amount and kind are functions of the 
locality. A reddish color is given by the iron present, and a 
lighter color by the other ingredients, and it mi^t be thought 
that since iron plays so important a part in the fusing of ash 
that the higher the color, the lower the softening temperature, 
would be the rule. This is true in general; but there are so 
miany exceptions that color cannot be relied on as an index of 
the softening ten^erature. -^he only statewient that can be made 
is that no red-colored ash was found that had a fusing tempera¬ 
ture above 1250®G., nor any light colored one which fused below 
11C0®C. 

The color could be used to detect the substitution of 
certain kinds of coal for others, in some cases. A list could

probably be drawn up, including most of the lignites and Saunders 
coal,which could not be substituted for other coals, including 
most of the bituminous and and sub-bituminous. The color test 
could easily be made, follov/ing the usual ash determination of 
the coal, and would be simpler than running a determination of 
the heating value, thou^ not so conclusive. In cases where 
samples were fraudulently dried before analysing, the color might 
be the more reliable test. 

In general, hi^ ash coals have a light colored ash, while 
coals with low ash contents give colored samples; so that it is 
possible that the intrinsic ash from all coals or from any one 
kind of coal would be the same in color, this color being most 
likely of a pink or reddish shade. Some work was done along 
this line in order to establish the uniformity of color, if it 
existed, and to see if intrinsic ash from different sources had 
the same softening temperature, but it was not completed in time 
for inclusion in this report. 

Conclusions Depending On The Softening Temperature 

In this connection, two tables are given, showing the results 
of the determinations of the softening temperature of the ash 
samples. Table III. gives the results in ®F., and Table IV. 
gives the same results in °C.. From this latter table a graph 
has been prepared (Figure 3) iii which the temperature of initial 
deformation, the softening temperature, and the fluid temperature

of the ash samples have been plotted against their softening 
temperatures. These points have been joined, so that the line 
represents the total range of temperature between the point of 
initial deformation and the fluid temperature. The length of 
the line below or above the oblique softening temperature line 
represents the softening and flowing intervals, respectively. 

The intervals, for convenience of comparison, have been plotted 
with respect to a horizontal zero line, and against their softening 
temperature at the bottom of the figure. 

Another curve is appended, Figure 4, which shows the relation 
between the softening temperature of the ash of a coal and the 
amount of ash and the heating value of the same coal (Table V.). 
From this curve it will be noted that there is a general tendency 
for the softening temperature to rise v/ith the amount of ash in 
the coal, but the ratio is not uniform. Attention is drawn to 
the fact that the coal samples with the lowest ash do not have 
the 'lowest softening tempers-ture, nor do the coal samples with 
the highest ash have the highest temperature. There is even less 
relation between the softening temperature and the heating value, 
for though there is a small rise with the heating value, the 
sample with the highest value does not have the ash v/ith the 
highest softening temperature, nor does the coal v/ith the lov/est 
heating value have the s.sh with the lowest softening temperature. 
The softening temperatures of the ash from these tv/o are, in fact, 
close together, and the one with the highest heating value has a

lower softening temperature than the one with the lowest heating 
value. From this evidence it can he stated that neither the ash 
content nor the heating value of the coal can be taken as an 
index of the softening temperature. 

An inspection of Figure 3» in which the bituminous coals 
are plotted with dotted lines, shows that they have on the 
average a higher softening tenperature than the lignites or 
sub-bituminous coals. Y/ith one exception (Canmoro, 1170®C.) 
they are all above 1300®G. 

The lignites range from 1035^0. to 1355®C., and the 
sub-bituminous from 1120®G. to 1280®C. 

An analysis of the results shown in Table III. indicates, 
as v;ould be expected, that, where two samples of coal were taken 
from one area, there is little variation between their softening 
tenperatures. The range in typical cases is 25 to 60®C. Even 
allowing a maximum error of ;^10®C.> this only becomes 45® to 80®

In the case of the lignite coals the percentage variation 
obtained above compares favorably with the variation secured 
in determining the proximate analysis and the heating value of 
different coals from the same field, so that it might be justi¬ 
fiable to take the mean of those at hand as typical of the area 
till more data is secured. 

The range of the softening temperatures in the bituminous 
and sub-bituminous areas is very great, but here the mountain¬ 
building forces have acted on the coal beds and caused different 
effects in places that are quite close together. This may account 
for the wide variation in the softening temperatures, or it may 
be due to the fact that the samples are from different seams. 

This is thought to be the case as far as the samples from the 
Coalspur area are concerned. Luscar and ^adomin mines, however, 
are but a few miles apart, and may be on the same seam, support 
being given to this theory by the fact that they have approximately 
the same ash content. The wide variation in the softening 
temperatures of their ash, on the other hand, suggests that they 
are on different seams, and this is supported by the next point 
discussed below. 

Another point of interest is that the flowing interval would 
also appear to be t 3 rpical of the seam. (See Table VII., next page.) 
Dinant and Spicer, with a difference of interval of 70®C.,are 
the only exceptions to the rule among those that are known to be 
from the same seam, and these, it will be remembered, were also

In connection with the sample from Cardiff, attention is drawn 
to the fact that it has a different color from the typical Edmon¬ 
ton samples, that there is a difference in the softening tempera¬ 
ture of 130®G., or 117®, and that there is a difference in the 
flowing interval. All three facts point to the conclusion that 
Cardiff coal is not from the same seam that is being mined in 
Edmonton. There are also slight differences in the proximate • 
analyses of the Cardiff and Edmonton coals. If further work 
confirms this indication, it would be a basis for suggesting 
tho.t the Edmonton area be divided accordingly. 

Another interesting point is that the seam mined at Pembina 
and Big Valley are both at the top of the same formation 
(Edmonton), and lie in the strata just below the Paskapoo series.

In connection with the sample from Cardiff, attention is drawn 
to the fact that it has a different color from the typical Edmon¬ 
ton samples, that there is a difference in the softening tempera¬ 
ture of 130®G., or 117», and that there is a difference in the

Cardiff coal is not from the same seam that is being mined in 
Edmonton. There are also slight differences in the proximate • 
analyses of the Cardiff and Edmonton coals. If further work 
confirms this indication, it would be a basis for suggesting 
tho.t the Edmonton area be divided accordingly. 

Another interesting point is that the seam mined at Pembina 
and Big Valley are both at the top of the same formation 
(Edmonton), and lie in the strata just below the Paskapoo series. 























- 50 - 


From this it was concluded that they were in all probability 
the same seam. Confirmation is lent to this view by the fact 
that the softening te35)eratures are only 50®C. apart, which is 
less than 4^ variation; and that the flowing intervals are 20° 
and 25®C., respectively; both of which are indications of the 
same seam. 

These results may be a series of happy chances, but the 
apparent relation between color, softenirg temperature, Eind 
flowing interval of ash samples from the same seam is considered 
to be worthy of future study. If a relation could be established, 
it would be of great aid to the geologist in correlating seams 
and strata in Alberta. Some of the above information was, in 
fact, considered as collateral evidence by Dr« Allan in drawing 
up his recently issued map of Alberta coal areas. 

CQnclusions Based On Constitution 

Observation of a number of isolated facts suggests that 
the manner in which the ash“>forming matter occurred might be of 
considerable importance. These included Rickett^s second point 
in his report to the A.S.T.M., viz., the manner in which the 
ash“formir^ material exists in the coal; Sinatt's statement thdt 
the residue from ignited ankerites does not melt below 1425°G.; 
the fact that some bituminous coals, when ignited in small 
lumps, appeared to fom several species of ash; the fact that 
similar species could be detected in examining the powdered 







- 51 - 


ash from bituminous coals under the microscope; and, in both 
cases, the presence of dark-colored mtter that retained this 
color after prolonged heating in oxygen was noticed especially. 

All these things pointed to the existence in the ash of 
distinct constituents, and it was decided to ignite the coal 
in small pieces without powdering, and to try and separate the 
components mechanically, if possible. 

The first work was done with pieces of about l/8»in. in 
size, and, later, with l/4-in. pieces. The method adopted was 
to sift these free of dust and fines, and to heat them at a low 
ten^erature till oxidized, and later to heat them to about 
800®C., as in the normal method of preparing ash. The pieces 
were heated on silica dishes, and as far as possible no piece of 
coal was allov/ed to touch any other piece. The dish was put 
in a cold furnace, and the slow heating prevented the formation 
of coke. On removal of the dishes from the furnace, several 
distinct varieties of ash were apparent, based on the colors 
?;hich they displayed; and these could be separated by careful 
picking. In no case could a complete separation be obtained, . 
for the particles were in all cases very fragile, and often 
two or three species would appear in a single lump. The pieces 
of ash had as a rule the size and shape of the lump of coal 
that had been ignited, and thou^ some were quite hard, others 
fell to pieces on being touched. 

The purest pieces of each general species were collected 
and examined, physically and chemically. Coal containing these

was divided into four portions by heavy solutions in an attempt 
to isolate the source of the species; and where enough was ob¬ 
tained, the softening temperature was determined. 

Four general species of ash constituents were recognized:- 
Group A - pure white, grey, or, occasionally, hard and pink in color 
Group B - brown, or earthy in color; 

Group C - red in color (the shade of dried blood); 

Group D - light red, pink, or salmon shade in color. 

The results of the different tests are presented in tabular form 
in Tables VIII. and IX. The ash is first divided into species 
and sub-species on the basi^ of its color and state. The relative 
amounts of each species from coal with different gravities is 
indicated, and it is to be noted that it was the coal that was 
separated by the heavy solutions. The separation of all the 
mineral matter with hi^ gravity into that part of the coal with 
a gravity over 1.55 is not complete, because sinall pieces some¬ 
times occur which are formed of a large amount of coal with a 
little extraneous matter attached. Such a piece acts with a 
gravity in between the two, and in this way small amounts of 
mineral matter appear in the ash from coal showing gravities much 
less than the extraneous matter itself. This separation can not 
be made complete without very fine division of the coal, but then 
the heavy solution does not easily wet the particles, and the 
method will not work satisfactorily for this reason. 

The chemical examination tabulated was purely qualitative.

and was carried out in order to identify the sources of the 
mineral matter v/hose presence was indicated by the separations 
made with the heavy solutions. It was generally satisfactory, 
but failed to distinguish between shale and sandstone. 

The amounts <S ash available were in some cases very small, 
and usually were contaminated with other constituents, so that 
the fusion tests are not by any means complete; but enough was 
done to give a general idea of the softening temperatures of 
the different species. 

Pieces of extraneous matter were picked out of Sterling 
ash by hand, but could not be identified by any physical 
property, though differences became apparent at once, following 
ignition. 

A study of the charts indicates the presence of low-fusible 
compounds in the ash from bituminous coals, one class having 
a softening temperature of 1405®C. , and another, 1140®C., while 
the majority of the ash is infusible at 1500®C. It is submitted 
that the low-fusing constituents are those which form a certain 
amount of clinker in the burning of coals with an infusible ash. 
It does not follow that these compounds will melt at the tempera¬ 
tures given, for the action of the other elements may lower 
their softening temperature to some extent, but the figure given 
will likely be the maximum temperature required to soften these 
particular constituents . It is interesting to note in this 

f 

connection that the figure, 1405®C., given above, applies to 







- 56 - 


ankerite, for whose softening temperature Sinatt gives 1425°C. 

If further investigation does not disprove this theory, 
it follows that the amount of clinker formed will depend to a 
large extent on the amount of constituents present that have 
a low softening temperature, since they are not intimately, 
mixed in furnace practice with the high-fusing components . 

V/here this does occur, as in the burning of powdered coal, 
the use of an infusible ash as determined by the standard 
method, should give practically no trouble at all. 

There is also here an explanation of the fact that coal 
can be washed without materially affecting the softening tempera¬ 
ture of its ash, for it is possible that the right proportion 
of shale, ankerite, pyrite, etc., might be removed, so that the 
ash that is left would have a softening temperature that was 
the same as, above, or below that of the original ash. (See 
Chapter VII., "Effect of Washing Coal on the Softening Temperature 
of Its Ash.") 

Titanium is found only in the extraneous ash from shale, 
and bone, and we should therefore expect it to be high in ash 
with a high proportion of these substances. It is, in fact, 
hi^ in high ash bituminous coals, showing that a large pro¬ 
portion of their ash comes from these sources. 

It is apparent, too, that calcium, iron, magnesium, and 
probably silica, are present in the ash as free oxides, and the 
behavior of these when being heated may be different from the

same oxides in combination as salts. It is pointed out that the 
iron in the ankerites has a distinctly different color from that 
in intrinsic ash, and this explains the presence of large amounts 
of iron in the bituminous coal ash, v/hich are generally of a 
grey color, #iile low ash coals with less iron are hi^ly colored. 
This is the reason that color does not indicate the softening 
temperature in any reliable way, and presumably the small, 
dark-colored grains recogiized under the glass in the bituminous 
coals are particles of brovm ankerite residue.

CHAPTER VI.- RELATION BETWEEN RESULTS 
OBTAINED IN THE LABORATORY AND 
CLINKER FORMATION IN PRACTICE 

Relation Of Softening Temperatures 
To Clinker Formation 

Sinatt, v/orking in England, determined the softening 
temperature of the ash from different horizons in the same 
seam, and found in some cases wide differences in the softening 
temperature. This is in line v/ith the quotation from Bone given 
at the head of the previous chapter. In one particular case 
quoted, the variation was from 1195 to 1440®C.. The high 
figures generally applied to horizons with a high ash content, 
and there is therefore the suggestion that these portions 
carried a considerable amount of siliceous matter. In other 
seams, however, the horizons showed a difference of only 35 
or 40®C.. 

The same worker separated some bituminous coal into its 
four ingredients, as defined by Dr. Stopes, and determined the 
softening temperature of the ash from these, finding again a 
wide variation, usually from 200 to 250®C.. In each case the 
fusain was the lowest, and the durain the highest. 

These results were all obtained with the furnace described 
above, and the comments made in that connection apply to these 
results. 

Besides the variations in the horizons of a coal seam and 
in the different portions'of the coal itself, there are the 





- 61 


the pieces of extraneous ash-forming matter;, though it should 
be noted that the larger of these portions of shale, bone, etc. , 
pass through the fire as inert matter, and remain for the most 
part unfused. 

It follows from these considerations that the softening 
temperature, as determined by the furnace, is only truly repre¬ 
sentative of low ash coals where the ash content is finely 
divided and more or less uniformly distributed through the coal 
mass, this being the condition most nearly approximating the 
standard method, where the whole of the ash is finely powdered 
and intimately mixed before fusion. This procedure favors the 
constituents present in the greatest proportion, whether they 
are high or low fusing in their nature; so that, v;ith coals con¬ 
taining a high proportion of refractory matter in the ash, the 
results shown will have to be modified. This is common among 
the bituminous coals of this province, which have a high ash 
containing a high percentage of siliceous matter; and the 
method does in fact fall down with these; for, though they appear 
infusible by the standard method, they do form a small amount 
of clinker, both hard and soft. This is explained by the fusion 
of low-softening bodies, the presence of which is demonstrated 
above by Sinatt's work, and again above under 

the heading ’’Constitution of the Ash.” Though the method does 
not give an exact interpretation of this class of coals, it is 
satisfactory as indicating that they will give little or no 


trouble with clinker.

It follows, therefore, that the percentage of ash does not 
greatly enter into the interpretation of the results obtained by 
the standard method in some cases; for, since the low ash coals 
are most accurately represented by the method, it is reasonable 
to suppose that almost the v/hole of the ash would soften at 
the indicated temperature, ^ile in hi^ ash coals, since the 
ash-forming matter is not well mixed, some of the higher fusing 
portions will not be likely to soften at the temperature 5.ndi- 
cated. The mass effect of a large amount of ash, in the heat 
that it absorbs, will lower the temperature also, with the 
consequent formation of less clinker* It would seem, therefore, 
that the amount of clinker formed by low and high ash coals 
with the same softening temperature and softening interval will 
differ only if the high ash coal is formed of constituents 
with a fairly constant softening temperature^ but that if the 
high ash coal is a mixture of high and low fusing constituents, 
which will usually be the case, the amount of clinker formed by 
the two coals vdll not differ greatly. 

The intervals are important in interpreting the results 
obtained by the standard method, as well as the softening 
temperature; for they are an indication of the relative vis¬ 
cosity of the clinker formed. Obviously the ash which flows 
the least, even if soft, will not form such troublesome clinker 
as the one which is more fluid, which will flow around the in¬ 
fusible portion and either dissolve it or engulf it bodily, to 






- 63 - 


form large, hard clinkers. In two coals, therefore, which 
have little or no variation in their softening temperature, 
the one which has the longest flooring interval will give the 
least trouble. 

Reference has been made at various stages to the tempera¬ 
ture of the fuel bed, since this is obviously an important factor 
in the formation of clinker, and this will now be considered. 

Relation Of Calorific Intensity To Clinker Formation 

In the preceding portions of this paper it has been assumed 
that there is a relation between the heat developed in the fuel 
bed and the amount of clinker formed. This was based on the 
observation that at higher ratings, when the temperature of 
the fuel bed was higher, there was more clinker from the same 
coal, and on the fact that of two coals,which seemed super¬ 
ficially to be very much alike, the one ?;ith the greatest heating 
value generally forriied the most clinker. Closer study of this 
phase of the question has upheld this theory. (See Bailey, E.G.: 
Power; above, Chapter II., "Historical”; and Ricketts’ report 
to the A.S.T.M., noted above in Chapter I..) 

As a result of these considerations it was decided to try 
to obtain as far as possible the V8.1ue of the calorific intensity 
of the coals sarr 5 )led. In this way a comparison could be made 
between the temperature required to soften the ash, as represented 
by the softening temperature, and the maximum heat to which it 
would be subjected, as represented by the calorific intensity. 






- 64 


The calculation of the calorific intensity is based on the 
ultimate analysis, and only a limited number of these were 
available, but as many as possible were estimated. Each calcu¬ 
lation referred to a particular coal, but the one whose analysis 
most nearly represented the average of its field was selected 
as the basis for the calculation. The average analyses were 
based on the results obtained in the analytical laboratory of 
the Scientific and Industrial Research Council of Alberta. The 
ultimate analyses used were taken from Bulletin 25 of the Depart¬ 
ment of Mines, Ottawa, and the Third Annual Report of the Alberta 
Research Council. 

The calorific intensity of nineteen coals were calculated. 

The method, as applied to a particular coal, consisted in esti¬ 
mating the composition of the flue gases that would be formed 
by burning a coal whose composition was determined by its ulti¬ 
mate analysis; and,by means of the known specific heat of the gases 
formed, the amount of heat required to raise a gram molecule of 
the theoretical flue gas to different temperatures was obtained. 

The heating value of the coal in gross calories was corrected for 
the amount of water vapor formed and condensed in the bomb deter¬ 
mination, and for the amount of hygroscopic water which must be 
vaporized in a furnace, giving a value for the total heat avail¬ 
able to raise the temperature of the combustion gases, in net 
calories. 

To obtain the heat available per gram molecule of flue 
gas, the net calorific value was divided by the number of gram

molecules of flue gas formed. Comparison of this value with the 
values showing the amount of heat required to raise a gram molecule 
of the flue gas to different temperatures gave the maximum tempera¬ 
ture attainable for that particular coal* 

since the coal is never burned in practice with the theoretical 
amount of air, the calculation was carried out on the supposition 
that excess air would most nearly represent the actual con¬ 
ditions. 

The amount of oxygen in the coal affects the amount of oxygen 
required from the air, and so the total volume of the flue gases 
for the excess of nitrogen and oxygen is equal to 6.5 times the 
volume of the oxygen required from the air. For this reason, 
the calculated temperature will be in error by an amount depending 
principally on the eri'or in the determination of the oxygen. 

The percentage of oxygen given by the ultimate analysis may be 
in error by the sum of the errors of the determination of the other 
elements in the coal, since it is obtained by difference, and the 
error may amount to 5/^ of "the value so found. 

In the tables given in this connection, the heating value is 
reported in the usual way; viz., B.t.u’s (calories per gram, 
multiplied by 1.8). 

An example of the method of calculation,as applied to Penn 


coal, is given below.

Notes On The Method 

1. Correction For Oxygen.* In the determination of the 
calorific value of the coal there is a loss of volume due to the 
union of oxygen with the hydrogen in the coal to form water. This 
takes place at const8.nt volume, so that the energy gained, repre¬ 
sented by RT , expressed in calories, is 1.95 X(273 **“ 20) = 580 
calories per molecule of oxygen, or per 2 molecules of hydrogen. 
For the coals under consideration, this represents 4.2 to 6.0 
calories per gram, and a uniform correction of 5 calories has 
been made. 

2. Correction For Condensed Water Vapor.- In the deter¬ 
mination of the calorific value, the v/ater vapor formed is con- 
dcnsedp giving up its heat of vaporization. At 20®C. this 
equals 585 calories per gram of water formed. This amount is 
obtained from the net hydrogen in the coal, each gram of which 
forms 9 grams of water. In the example above:- 




















67 a - 


1 gram of coal contains 0.034 gms. H 2 , forming O.306 gme. water. 
Total heat liberated on condensation = 0.306X585 ® I 80 calories. 
This correction varies from I 70 calories in the high-moisture 
coals (305 B.t.u.), to 225 calories (405 B.t.u.) in the bituminous 
coals. 

3. Increase In Heat Content Of Gases.- The values for the 


increase in heat content are obtained from the following data:-

(2) Goodenough, 5.A., & Felbeck, G.T.; An investigation of the

Since Cp “ ^ > the quantity of heat to raise the gas through a 
given range of temperature, can be obtained by integrating the 
above formulae; o.g., for O 2 (2), Q = 6 . 93 (T 2 -Ti) + 0.13 X 10 *^(T 25 **T 23 ). 
Substituting in this formula the limits for T^ = 20®C. (the normal 
ten^erature of the air), and for T 2 the values 1200®C., 1400®C., 
and 1600®C., etc., the quantity of heat required to raise one

The values given by both (1) and (2) are the ssjne within 
the limits of experimental error. Goodenough*s formulae are 
slightly lower, and have been used in these calculations. 

4. Correction For Water Content.- The v/ater content of the 
coal is vaporized in the furnace, and this requires 5^5 calories 
per gram (20®C.) which can not be used to raise the temperature 
of the flue gases. In the determination of the heating value 
this takes place, but the vapor is condensed, giving its heat 

up again. 

This correction, applied to commercial coals is:- 
Percentage of v/ater X 10.56 = B.t.u. per pound. (Latent heat 
of vaporization of uncondensed steam at 62°F. = 1056.7 B.t.u., 
according to Marks & Davis.) 

5. Sources of Error Not Corrected For.- The volume of 
gas produced by burning the sulphur in the coal is neglected, 
and also the amount of oxygen necessarj’' to combine v,dth it. 

The heat given out by the oxidation of the sulphur and nitrogen 
to acids is corrected for in the determination of the heating 
value. The volume of sulphur in Alberta coals is in every case 

quite small — generally about 0.3^* 

The compos it ionof the air is taken as 20^ Oxygen and 80J!^ 
Nitrogen, which is not the exact case, but both have the same

specific heat. 

The amount of water vapor present in the air is not esti¬ 
mated. 

In pmctice there is always an amount of carbon monoxide 
formed, varying v;ith the air supply. This tends to lower the 
amount of oxygen required^ and lower the amount of heat available, 
owing to incomplete combustion. This was not considered in the 
calculation. 

The amount of heat lost through radiation by the furnace 
walls^by fusion of ash, and the amount necessary to heat the 
ash up to the temperature reached were all neglected. These 
will vary with the temperature and the ash content of the coal. 

There is probably also some dissociation of the gases at 
the temperatures reached, which may alter the amount of heat 
available. 

It rarely happens in actual practice that the excess of 
air is maintained at 50 ^ on the average, so that for all these 
reasons the maximum temperature will never be approached in 
furnaces as operated. The value obtained is for an ideal furnace, 
to which commercial ones only approximate. Actual measurements 
of a brisk fire of Penn slack gave a value of 1300®C. (optical 
pyrometer), compared to the value of 1530'’C. obtained by calcu¬ 
lation. 

It is thought that the figures obtained for the calorific 
intensity give values which are quite comparable, since they apply

to an ideal furnace under identical conditions, and that they 
can be used for the purpose of comparing the coals. 

Estimation Of The Calorific Intensity 
Where No Ultimate Analysis Was Available 

A relation was sought betv/een the calorific intensity so 
calculated, and either the proximate analysis or the heating 
value or a combination of the two for the coals considered, in 
order to get a comparative figure for the coals, the ultimate 
analyses of which were not available. 

After many comparisons it was found that the ratio between 
the calculated intensity sjid the net B.t.u. as received made the 
nearest approach to a constant. On plotting these values (see 
Figure 5*) and drawing a theoretical curve, it was found that 
none of the nineteen varied by more than This variation is 

considered to be due to experimental error, sjid compares favor¬ 
ably with the percentage error in the calculation of the calorific 
intensity, and the allowable error in the estimation of the 
softening temperature (a tolerance of 30®C. for the same operator), 
so that the use of the curve to obtain values for the calorific 
intensity of other coals seems justifiable. 

To use it, the net calories must first be determined, and 
where no ultimate analysis was available, the net hydrogen content 
of the coal was taken from the analysis of a similar coal in the 
same area, to determine the correction for condensed moisture 
in the bomb. The correction for hygroscopic water vras calculated

from the foraula given above. 

The v;ater content of the coal was plotted against the total 
correction in the B.t.u. (See Figure 6.) , and a theoretical 
curve drawn, and it v/as found that a fairly close relation 
existed between the two. This can be stated as follows:- 


Moisture, jo Correction in B.t.u. value, as received 

Above 12.390 + 8 X percentage of moisture 

Below 12.. 390 + 12.5 X percentage of moisture 


A table was prepared (Table X-a) showing the actual correction 
based on the net hydrogen in the coal and the water content, and 
the correction calculated by the formulae above, together v;ith the 
difference in the two values. It is thought that these differences 
are small enough to warrant its use for est imating the net calorific 
value of a coal of which no ultimate analysis is available. 

From the net calorific value, the calorific intensity can be 
estimated by the use of the curve in Figure 5* This v/as done, 
and a table was prepared (Table XI.) showing the estimated 
calorific intensity of all the coals from which ash samples had 
been taken. By the use of these curves the calorific intensity 
developed by a coal under the conditions outlined above can be 
estimated from its heating value and moisture content.

The Clinkering Index 

From the figures obtained as described above, those repre¬ 
senting the softening temperature of the cosd ash were sub¬ 
tracted, giving the difference in degrees Centigrade, and it is 
suggested that these be used as an index of the clinkering 
tendency of the coals. It is probable that the figure so obtained 
should be modified to some extent by the amount of ash in the 
coal, for there will be a distinct loss of heat due to the 
temperature at which the ash is removed from the fuel bed, and 
also a slight loss of heat due to fusion, if any has taken place. 
The relation does not depend on the amount of the ash directly, 

□s pointed out above, unless it has little or no low melting 
constituents. When this is the case, it is likely that with a 
small index and a large amount of ash, little or no clinker will 
form. 

A table has been prepared, showing the clinkering index of 
the sanples, together with the typical ash associated with them, 
but information is not at present available as to the low melting 
constituents of the ash. The flowing interval is also indicated 
in Table XII. 

The order of the same samples, when listed ivith regard 
to the softening temperature of their ash is also indicated, 
and it will be seen that, for the most part, they are not 
notably displaced. This method of estimation offers a solution 
for the problem of why the amount of clinker formed is not

always in accord with the softenirg temperature. E.G .Bailey, 
quoted above, mentions this trouble, and so does Ricketts in 
his report to the meeting of the A.S.T.M. in 1923* (See Proceedings 
of the A.S.T.M. for that year.) 

It should be noted that the clinkering index, as well as the 
values for softening temperature, would indicate that no clinkering 
would take place v/ith a number of the high ash bituminous coals, 
whereas in each case a certain amount of clinker is formed. An 
explanation of this discrepancy, based on the fact that different 
portions of a particular ash fuse at different temperatures, 
was outlined above under "Constitution of the Ash." 

Observations From Boiler Trials 

To obtain first hand information of the clinker trouble 
given by all the representative Alberta coals in actual practice 
would be an almost impossible task. To obtain comparative 
results, the coals should be burned in the type of furnace most 
suited to their particular qualitiesj the best type for the 
high volatile coals of the prairies is not the best for the 
bituminous coals of the mountains; and so to test them all, a 
series of different installations would be necessary. 

The amount of ash in siny one kind of coal varies from 
time to time, and a series of runs would h-n^e to be made to 
get average results;for the amount of ash will in certain cases 
influence the amount of clinker to a different degree, depending 




- 75 - 


on the uniformity of the constituents. 

The degree to which the fire is forced will be an important 
factor, owing to the higher temperature produced at higher 
ratings, so that it is difficult to make comparisons from this 
point of view. 

The heat ing value of the coals as mined at present is 
slightly above the values recorded in Bulletin 25> published 
in 1918. The difference may be due to methods of mining, 
sampling, or calorimetry, or to an increase in the heating 
value of the coal. If this last is true, the difference is 
probably greater v/hen applied to results obtained some 10 or 
more years ago. The general average of other characteristics 
may have changed too, and the clinker formation given by a 
coal some time ago will not therefore necessarily be duplicated 
by present day sampl es from the same mine. 

Boiler trials have been run on different occasions, and 
under different circumstances, by different authorities; and 
though it is realized that they are not strictly comparative 
for the reasons given above, they have been assembled in one 
list for convenience. The observers are given in every case, 
and, generally, comparisons should be limited to the coals 
quoted by any one authority. In the case of coals used in boiler 
trials in the power plant of the University of Alberta and at 
other institutions in this city, and credited variously to 
R.T.H. , McM, A.G.S., and *A.G.S., the estimation of the degree 
of clinker is comparative, and though most of these trials were

conducted in furnaces designed especially for lignite coals, 
some of the bituminous and sub-bituminous trials were made on 
a marine type, so that these, together, make the nearest approach 
BO far obtained to a comparative measure of the clinkering 
tendency of a series of Alberta coals. The results to v/hich 
these remarks apply have been starred (*) in the list below, 

Table XIII. 

\Vith regard to one of these results (Sterling, A.G.S.) in 
which practically no clinker was formed, it may be stated that 
the softening temperature of the ash from this sample of coal 
vja.s determined, and was more than 100®C. above the average 
sample, so that the index for this trial was actually less than 
zero. 

Comparison of Table XII., showing the clinkering index of 
the various samples, with the comments on clinker for*mation in 
practice in Table XIII. shows that the general tendency is very 
well indicated. In general it may be said that coals with an 
index below 3OO will give little trouble from clinker, but that 
low ash coals with an index above 3OO will form clinker, giving 
more or less trouble; and that in comparing coals with approxi¬ 
mately the same index and amount of ash, the one with the 
shortest flowing interval will form the most clinker.

CHAPTER VII.- EFFECT OF WASHING A COAL 

ON THE SOFTENING TEMPERATURE OF ITS ASH 

Dr. J. B. Porter, in "An Investigation of the Coals of 
Canada, Vol.I. deals very thoroughly v.'ith the subject of 
washing coals, and draws attention to the fact that as the 
better seams of an area are v;orked out, and as the consumers 
become more discriminating in their choice of fuel, coal washing 
is generally resorted to. ^^e even says, cn page 193 » speaking 
of the introduction of coal washirg plants: "The change v/ill 
probably first be made in the coke-producirg districts of the 
west." 

He lists as advantages to be gained by v/ashing:- 

(1) Improvement of the heating value; 

(2) Saving of transportation and labor costs in handling 

inert mattery 

(3) Improvement of the quality of the coke; 

(4) Removal of pyrite lessens the tendency to clinker; 

(5) Lowering of the sulfur and phosphorus content of the coke. 
This is a most important matter if the coke is to be used for 
the production of iron and steel. In which these elements must 
be reduced to the last trace . This is becoming more and more 
significant as the quality of the iron ore mined becomes poorer. 

Figures obtained in the analysis of coal ash have been used 
to estimate the amount of sulphur and phosphorus in the coke from 
different bituminous coals, but this method takes no account of 









- 80 - 


the amount of organically combined sulphur which is lost in 
preparing the ash, but is not lost during the coking.

The limits given in each case are taken from Illingworth, 
"The Analysis of Coal & Its Byproducts,” and they show that to 
produce first quality coke most of our bituminous coals will have 
to be washed. These figures , as suggested above, represent a 
minimum of phosphorus and sulphur, and it is likely that more 
of these elements are left in the coke, as it is made, than is 
given from these figures derived from the coal ash. 

Coal washing on a large saale is not practicable, but a 
sample of Greenhill coal was washed by Mr. Cameron with the 
washing apparatus available in the Mining Department. Two other 
samples available were tested by means of heavy solutions having 
a gravity of 1.55. This is recommended by Porter as givir^g a 
good indication of the probable success and limits of actual

The last two examples are distinct samples, and not v/ashed. 

The flowing interval shows little difference in any case. These 
erratic results have been found by other investigators. 

In a report on the Trent Process for the removal of mineral 
matter from coal (Bureau of liines , Report of Investigation, 

Serial No. 2263), the following changes resulted from the 
reduction of ash content.

It will be noted that the softening temperature was raised, 
lowered, and unaltered, in different cases. 


Stans field, workirjg at McGill seiferal years ago, fused the 
ash of several coals before and after v/ashing. (investigation of 
the Coals of Canada, Vol. 2.) His results are not comparable 
with those given above, since a different type of furnace was 
used, and different methods of fusion measurement. He concluded 
that washed coal gave an ash less fusible than the ash from the 
same coal when unwashed. I have endeavored to interpret his 
results on a comparative basis.

These results are more or less fragmentary, but suggest that 
no definite conclusion can be drawn with regard to the effect that 
washing a coal will have on the fusibility of its ash. These 
practical results are in accord with the statement in Bulletin 129 > 
page 14, which is apparently based on theoretical grounds alone. 

It says, "Washing may either increase or decrease the ash fusi¬ 
bility, depending on the fusibility of the intrinsic ash and the 
nature of extraneous impurities." 

It should be noted that neither washing with v/ater nor sepa¬ 
ration by means of the Trent Process works as well on iron pyrite 
85 on other minerals, owing to the differential wetting of the 
mineral, and the presence of scaly particles. Results, therefore, 
obtained on pyritic coal will not be strictly comparable with 
those from pyrite-free coal. 

The relative amounts of the different constituents of the 
extraneous ash, their different susceptibility to washing or 
separation, and their difference in softening temperatures are 
all factors that enter into the effect that washing will have on 




















84 


a coal, so that no definite statement can be made. It may be 
said, in general, however, that where the mineral matter is 
principally of a clay shale or slate, a reduction might be 
expected; but if the mineral matter is formed of ankerite or 
pyrite, the washed coal will have an ash with an increased 
softening temperature; and when all are present in quantity, 
no prediction can be made.

CHAPTER VIII.- RELATIOM BETWEEN CHEMICAL 


COMPOSITION AND 

SOFTENING 

TEMPERATURE 

Nature Of 

Fusion Of 

Ash 


It is evident that coal ash, being a mixture of various 
constituents, will not have a definite melting point which is 
the criterion of a pure substance. The presence of each element 
will affect the others, so that the resulting softening is an 
accumulative effect, due to the number of different elements 
present, their relative amounts, and, in some cases, such as 
iron, their state of oxidation. In other cases, such as sulphur, 
(which may be present as organic matter, as sulphates, or as 
sulphides) the state of combination may make a difference in the 
effect on the softening temperature. It has already been suggested 
that some oxides occur free, and others in combination with 
silica, etc., so that this too may affect the influence of these 
elements, increasing the effect of some portions above other 
portions of the same element, or, possibly, in the case of free 
oxides, removing them from the reaction altogether. 

In general, when two oxides are fused together, the melting 
point of the mixture is lower than that of either oxide separately, 
and there is a certain mixture of the two that gives the lowest 
possible melting point. These are known as the eutectic mix¬ 
ture and eutectic temperature. Given such a mixture, the 
addition of more of either substance raises the fusing temperature 






- 86 - 


so that the addition of an oxide to another oxide may first 
lower the fusing temperature; and, later, if the amount added 
is increased, may raise the temperature. As examples of the 
lov/ering of fusing temperatures, Washburn, "Principles of 
Physical Chemistry", gives the following:- 

CaO, fusing at 2570®C,, and Si02) at 1625> form an eutectic which 

melts at 1436®C. 

CaO, fusing at 2570®C., and AI 2 O 3 at 2050®C., form an eutectic 

melting at 1400®C. 

The addition of a third oxide causes a further lowering, as in 
the lime-silica^alumina system an eutectic melting at 1265 ®C. is 
formed. Addition of a fourth and a fifth component, if in small 
amounts, causes still further lowering. In ordinary samples of 
coal ash there are some ten or eleven different elements, so that 
the involved nature of the fusion reactions is at once apparent. 
The effects produced by one oxide on the other is in proportion 
to its molecular concentration, so that any attempt to solve the 
fusion temperature by means of the analysis of the ash should 
presumably start from that point. 

Certain of the constituents are present in small amounts. 
These are, as a general rule, phosphorus, sulphur, manganese, 
magnesium, titanium, and the alkalis; while the bulk of the ash 
is made up of the oxides of silica, alumina, calcium, and iron. 
These latter usually amount to 75^ of the weight of the ash.

In connection with the occurrence of phosphorus in Alberta, 
Dr, Allan draws attention (4th Annual Report on the Mineral 
Resources of Alberta, 1922, p.65) to the fact that there are 
phosphate-bearing rocks in the series just under the Kootenay 
in which* the bitumizious coals are found. A small vein has 
been located near Banff, and in the Canmore coal sample from 
near Banff, too, there is an unusually high phosphorus content. 
If there is any connection between these facts, it would indi-

Relation Between Chemical Analysis 
And Softening Temperature 

From the work which was discussed above under "Constitution 
of the Ash," it would be expected that silica and alumina would 
act as refractory components, and that calcium, iron, and mag¬ 
nesium would tend to lower the softening teniperature, particularly 
if the iron were present in the ferrous state, which is normal 
for ankerite residues. The presence of alkali will also lower 
the softening temperature, but as a rule neither sodium nor 
potassium is present in any large amount. 

Examination of Tables XIX. and XX. shows that these elements 

as a general rule had the effect that would be expected, but that 

the influence of one is often masked by the influence of the 

others, so that there is no regular relation between the softening 

temperature and the percentage composition of any one oxide. The 

table, however, shows that there is generally, among the samples 

with high softening teriiperatures, a larger proportion of silica, 

alumina, and titanium, while in those that soften at the lower 

temperatures there is an increase in the amount of calcium, 

magnesium, iron, sulphur, and the alkalis. 

out 

These relations are brought/more clearly in Table XXI., 
where the samples are arranged in order of increasing softening 
temperature. In the columns for each oxide the numbers show 
the order of increasing percentage of that oxide. Thus, under 
silica, sample no.l has the second lowest silica content, and 





- 91 - 


sample no. 5 the lowest. The lack of order in these figures, due 
to the various influences stated above, show what a difficult 
problem it is to find a relation between the chemical analysis and 
the softening temperature. 

Various workers have at different times attempted to derive 
formulae that would show the relation between the chemical 
analyses and the softening temperatures. As a rule these work 
successfully with some, but not with others. Examples are;- 

(1) Bischoff*s formulae for a fire clay,- 

Oxygen in Alumina . Oxygen in Silica 
Oxygen in Fluxes Oxygen in Alumina 

gives a quotient which rises with increasing softening temperature, 

and which is stated by Frost to apply to coal ash. If the 

quotient is above 3 j will not soften below 1500 ®C.; while 

if the quotient falls to 1, the ash will be fusible, and melt 

below 1300°C. 

( 2 ) Dr. J. T. Dunnin (J. Soc. Ghem. Ind., Vol. 37 > P *150 lists 
the results of the chemical analysis and the softening temperatures 
of samples of ash that he had prepared. He suggests, as a guide, 
that where the ratio,- 

Molecular proportions of A l umina to 1,000 molecules Silica 
Molecular proportions of Other Bases to 1,000 molecules Silica 

exceeds 1.75, there will be little trouble from clinkering. 

From the relations brought out in the work done in this 
investigation, it is suggested that the ratio,- 

SUm of molecular p roportions of SiQ2> AI2O3 and Ti02 _ 

Sum of molecular proportions of CaO, MgO, Alkalis & SO^ 











92 


gives a quotient whihh is above 10 for infusible ash samples, 
and it is therefore an indication of probable clinkerirg 
tendencies. 

It is to be noted that this formula is formed on a purely 
empirical basis, there being both bases and acid radicals in 
numerator and denominator. Further analyses might cause a 
change in this formula, for it is dravm from the apparent 
relation between chemical composition and softening tempera¬ 
ture which is shown by the thirteen samples analyzed. Table 
XXII. gives the results of the application of these formulae 
to the samples analyzed.

It will be noted that neither of the three ratios 
gives a quotient which varies directly with the softenirg tempera¬ 
ture. This is due, presumably, in part at least, to the effect 
of oxidation and combination as outlined above. 

The claims made for Bischoff’s formulae are not upheld 
for ash samples nos. 6, 7 » and 3, none of which show a quotient 

above 3 i and soften below 1500°C.; while throe of the samples 
softening below 1300®C.havea quotient above 1. 

Dr. Dunn's formula shows no exceptions. The samples 
with a quotient above 1.75 are all infusible at 1500®C., and 
give no trouble with clinkers. 

The formula suggested by this work gives a quotient 
above 10 for an infusible ash, and is probably no better than 
the one suggested by Dr. Dunn. 

Eurgwin, H.K., jr., (J.Ind. & Chem.Eng., Vol.6,(1914), 
p. 694 .) concludes that where Fe 203 is less than 10^, the fusing 
temperature is not below 1399°^* (All the samples in Table XIX. 
are contrary to this statement); where the Fe 203 in ash is more 
than 20fc, the temperature is never above 1399®C. (In Table XIX. 
none of the coals have this amount of iron.); that where 5 and 
Fe 203 in coal is below 3^> the fusing temperature is above 1399®C. 
(Most of the samples are contrary to this also; e.g., no.32 con¬ 
tains Fe 203 , 7.6^e, and S, 2.4^, in approximately 5/^ ash coal, so 
that the content of Fe 203 and S is about 0.5^ in the coal, and the 
aah softens at 1085°C.); that where S and Fe20^ is above 3^ in

the coal the ash will fuse below 1399°C. (None of the samples 
in Table XIX. fall in this class.). It is to be noted that the 
figure 1399 ®C. might not be duplicated in the standard method of 
determining the softening temperature, but the exceptions noted 
above could hardly be accounted for on this basis. 

In considering the relation between chemical composition 
and softening temperature it is interest ing to note that only one 
of the samples has an excess of acidic equivalents, and this one, 
no. 13» softens at 1280®C. , almost half way between the lowest 
and highest softening temperatures obtained in this series of 
tests . 

Relation Between Chemical Analysis & Intervals 

Reference to the flowing intervals , as shown in Figure 
No.3, reveals that they vary without any apparent reg-alarity. The 
softenii'g intervals, on the other hand, shown in the same figure, 
are fairly consistent: the average being about $0 to 60°C. for 
all ash samples having a softening temperature below 1165®C.. 

For those above this temperature, beginniiig with 1170®C., the 
softening interval is much longer, being about 150®C. for 
those wiiose softening terrperatures lie between 11?0® and 1270®C.; 
and for those whose softening temperatures are above 1270°C., the 
average is about 200°C.. Notable exceptions to the groups are 
the sub-bituminous coals from the Coalspur area, viz., Mercoal 
and Foothills, the latter of which, on analysis, reveals a 






- 95 « 


large amount of calcium in its composition, so that this element 
may play an important part in the viscosity of the clinker. It 
apparently causes a more fluid clinker, while iron oxide, 
alumina, and silica are highly viscous, as shown by the small 
amount of bending in the highly siliceous ash of the bituminous 
coals, and the viscosity of the ankerite residues ("Constitution 
of the Ash") . 

seme Recent Opinions On The Relation Of 
Chemical Analysis To Softening Temperature 

Mr. Sinatt ( in his report of the Lancashire & Cheshire 
Coal Research Association, 1920) concludes "that chemical 
analysis is of little value as a criterion of the melting 
point of ash," Dr. R. Lessing, in commenting on this, said; 
"There is no question that Richter’s Law, according to which 
fluxes act on clays and other refractory materials in molecular 
ratio, still holds good, and that melting points can be calcu- 
lated from the analytical results, provided the analysis is 
complete in all its details, including the state of oxidation 
and the manner of combination of the various constituents." 

Mr, Sinatt, in his reply, pointed out that such knowledge was 
at present impossible to obtain completely, o\7ing to the hetero¬ 
geneous nature of coal ash. 

Bone, in his monograph, "Coal and Its Scientific Uses," 
( 1919)1 says that the relation of fusibility of the ash of a 
coal to its chemical composition is a very importeint, though 







- 96 - 


somewhat complex question, concerning which the present state 
of our knowledge is not sufficiently definite to v/arrant the 
laying down of any precise rules. 

Dr. Dunn (I 9 18),whose work is quoted above, concluded 
that althou^ at present no law can be formulated, the melting 
point as a rule rises as the relative molecular proportions of 
basic oxides to silica diminishes. (Bone, pg.41.) 

At the commencement of this investigation it was hoped to 
find out rather more about the relation between the softening 
temperature and the chemical composition than can be reported. 

The writer, however, hopes that the analyses of these samples 
of ash,whose softening temperatures lias also been determined, 
will prove of use in some future investigation. 

Effect Of The Addition Of Foreign Matter 
On The Softening Temperature Of The Ash 

It had been intended to do some work with the low-fusing 
coals, in order to determine whether the addition of some common 
substances, such as sand, limestone, or clay, would alter the 
softenirg tenperature sufficiently to be worth practising on 
a commercial scale. 

Lack of time prevented this being done, but from the results 

of the work under "Constitution of Ash" it can be said that the 
or clay 

addition of fine sand/to samples already high in silica and 
alumina should raise the softening temperature of the ash as 







determined in the standard method. It is very doubtful, 
however,'if it would alter the amount of clinker formed to any 
appreciable extent. In the hi^ ash bituminous coals studied 
it was shown that the standard method indicated that the ash was 
infusible at 1550°C., and yet a certain amount of clinker formed, 
v/hich was presumably from the low-fusing compounds present. It 
seems probable, therefore, that the addition of sand or clay, 
which would behave very mu di like the extraneous ash in the 
samples referred to above, would not materially affect the 
simount of clinker formed. 

The addition of limestone, on the other hand, -iihich would 
form on ignition free calcium oxide, would tend to lov/er the 
softening temperature, since most samples of ash have an excess 
of silica over other oxides; and it would therefore act as a flux 
and lower the softening temperature until the amount added 
became so much that the total amount of lime was greater than 
the equivalent amount of silica, when further additions would 
tend to raise the softening teirperature again, since the 
lowering effects of the other oxides would be diluted, and this 
action would depend directly on the amount of calcium already 
in the coal. The effect of these additions becomes directly 
linked up with the chemical analysis of the ash, and unless 
this is known, the effect of adding foreign material can not 
be intelligently studied. 

L. S. Marks did some work along this line in 1910, but 





- 98 - 


his investigations were made before the standard method v;as 
evolved, and his results are therefore not strictly comparative 
with those obtained in the present investigation. He did not 
define the softening temperature, and so the degree of modi¬ 
fication in it is not definite. He worked on a non-ctinkering 
coal from West Virginia, whose ash had a softening temperature 
of 1400®C. He used cones in estimating the softening tempera¬ 
ture, which he measured with a thermo-couple. His results are 
tabulated below.

No report is made of the effect of adding silica, nor is the 
chemical analysis of the sanplo given, but from the fact that it 
was a non-clinkering variety, it presumably had a high silica 

i 


content, 






















- 99 


These results are quite in line with v;hat v;ould be expected 

from the theoretical considerations given above, and suggest 

that some further work might give the proportion of lime to be 

added to raise the softening temperature; or, in general, the 
a 

amount of/foreign substance that would have to be added to raise 
the softening temperature sufficiently to prevent the fusion of 
much of the ash. It seems highly desirable that this work should 
be done on sanples which have been analyzed chemically. 

■'JiTiether this would work in practice or not is a matter that 
could only be determined by actual work under furnace conditions, 
but the amount of matter to be added could be determined to some 
extent by the use of cones of the original ash, and of others 
to which different proportions of foreign matter hs.d been added.

S UMMARY 

1. Thirteen samples of ash have been analysed, and their 
softening temperatures determined. 

2. The softening temperatures of twenty other ash sanples 
have been determined, the complete series of samples representing 
all the typical Alberta coals. 

3* A method has been suggested for taking into account the 
heat of the furnace in determining the tendency to clinker. 

4. A method has been suggested for estimatiiTg the net calories 
of a coal without the use of its ultimate analysis. 

5* The general results obtained by the A.S.T.M. standard 
method for determining the softening temperature of coal ash have j 
been compared with clinker formation in practice. Explanations 
have been offered for cases where the standard method fails to 
indicate clearly the tendency to clinker. 

6. *^he relationship of the constitution of the ash to the 

I 

softening temperature has been discussed, and the different com- j 

ponents of two ash samples tabulated. 

7. The effect on the softenipg temperature of reducing the 

ash of a coal by washing, heavy solution separation, or oil separation 
has been shown to vary with the sample, and the reason for this is 
pointed out. 

8. The chemical analyses of ash samples have been compared 
with their softening temperatures, but no definite relation has 
been secured.
