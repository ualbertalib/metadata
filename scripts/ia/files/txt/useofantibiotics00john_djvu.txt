ABSTRACT 


Three experiments, designed to study the effect of 
the addition of antibiotics to rations of breeders, chicks 
and broilers, were conducted. 

The study with breeding hens indicated that the 
addition of penicillin to three breeding rations which varied 
in protein and energy content, had no effect on the productive 
and reproductive performance of birds fed the rations. The 
riboflavin content of the livers of the treated birds was 
not affected. 

Three trials were conducted on the use of antibiotics 
in chick rations. The addition of antibiotics resulted in a 
variable response which appeared to be related to the ration 
fed and the type of chicks employed. The addition of 
vitamin B]j?, penicillin or aureomycin to chick rations did 
not affect the storage of riboflavin in the liver of the chick. 

A series of three trials was conducted to study the 
effect of the addition of penicillin to broiler rations, 
which varied in energy and protein content. The results 
obtained indicated that the addition of penicillin to a low 
energy type broiler ration or a corn-soybean oil meal ration 
caused an increase in the rate of growth of chicks. No growth 
response to penicillin supplementation was noted when a high 
energy; high energy, low protein; low energy, low protein or 
a corn-soybean oil meal, low protein diet was employed.

INTRODUCTION 


Poultry producers have known for many years that 
protein concentrates of animal origin contained something 
which was lacking in protein concentrates of plant origin. 
Producers have preferred to feed some animal protein 
supplement in their rations because, in most cases, the 
birds grew faster and made more efficient gains. 

As a result of wartime conditions, however, 
animal protein concentrates were in short supply and the 
amount available was not adequate to meet the needs of all 
the producers. This lack of concentrates of animal origin 
had the effect of stimulating the use of plant proteins in 
poultry rations. 

It soon became apparent that there was present in 
animal protein concentrates a factor(s) which was essential 
for maximum growth and which was lacking in concentrates of 
plant origin. The factor was commonly called the Animal 
Protein Factor* 1 . Eventually in I9I+8 the factor was 
isolated in pure form and called vitamin Bi2* 

Following the isolation of vitamin B32, it was 
found that a number of organisms isolated from soil produced 
this vitamin when grown in pure culture. Similarly organisms 
T/hich are used in the production of antibiotics such as 
aureomycin, streptomycin and penicillin were shown to be 





2 


producers of the factor in question* As a result vitamin B ]_2 
supplements (by-products from aureomycin, streptomycin and 
other fermentation processes) began to appear on the market, 
and were sold as Animal Protein Factor Supplements (APF 
Supplements). 

It soon became apparent that certain of the APF 
Supplements contained a growth factor(s) other than vitamin 
b 12 * trials it was noted that, on certain rations, 

the addition of an APF Supplement resulted in a marked 
increase in growth rate of chicks while no growth response 
was obtained from the addition of crystalline vitamin Bi 2 * 

It was later shown that the factor(s) responsible for the 
increased growth rate was an antibiotic* 

In view of the possible economic importance of the 
above observations, trials were initiated at the University 
of Alberta in I95O to study certain aspects of the us© of 
antibiotics in poultry rations. 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Following the isolation of vitamin Bj2 by Rickes 
and coworkers (19i|.8) reports appeared in the literature 
suggesting that the growth promoting activity of certain 
"Animal Protein Factor Supplements" could not be explained 
on the basis of the vitamin B12 content of such supplements.

Stokstad et al . (I9I4.9) reported that the Animal Protein 
Factor was multiple in nature and presented results which 
indicated that a fermentation product, obtained from the 
culture of Streptomyces aureofaciens promoted better chick 
growth then that obtained from pure vitamin In studies 

with pigs Cunha et al . (I9I+9) noted that an "Animal Protein 
Factor Supplement" resulted in a twenty-six percent increase 
in the rate of gain of pigs while the addition of a vitamin 
B12 concentrate had no apparent effect* 

It was soon established that the increased rate 
of growth was caused by the presence of aureomycin in the 
APF Supplement. The concept that an antibiotic could 
stimulate the growth rate of chicks was not entirely new, 
for Moore et al . ( 19 M>) showed that feeding streptomycin to 
chicks on a purified diet resulted in an increased rate of 
growth. Stokstad and Jukes (I95O) showed that the addition 
of crystalline aureomycin enhanced the growth of chicks on 
diets adequate in vitamin B12 to almost the same extent as 
concentrated cultures of Streptomyces aureofaciens . A 
response in growth rate was also obtained from the addition 
of streptomycin to the basal diets. The effectiveness of 
aureomycin and streptomycin as growth promoting substances 
was confirmed by Groschke and Evans (I95O). 

Subsequently it was shown that in addition to 
aureomycin and streptomycin, penicillin and terramycin were 







j /■ V '

( < 





effective in stimulating the growth rate in turkeys; McGinnis 
Stern, Wilcox and Carver (I95I). Penicillin was found to he 
the most effective of the antibiotics tested* 

In trials conducted at the University of Alberta 
to be reported herein, only penicillin and aureomycin were 
used* It would therefore seem advisable to deal with each 
in turn. 

Penicillin 

A number of investigators have found that the 
addition of penicillin to rations stimulates the growth of 
chicks and turkey poults* McGinnis et al * ( 1951 ) reported 
that the addition of penicillin to a turkey starter was 
effective in increasing the rate of growth of poults* When 
compared to aureomycin, streptomycin and terramycin, 
penicillin appeared to be the most effective antibiotic. 
Combinations of other antibiotics with penicillin were no 
more effective than penicillin alone. The response to 
antibiotics was greater on the basal diet which contained 
ten percent fishmeal than on the basal diet in which soybean 
oil meal was used as the only protein supplement. Penicillin 
was found to be effective when added to the basal diet at a 
level of 5 milligrams per kilogram of ration. Patrick (I95I) 
studied the effect of penicillin supplementation on turkey 
poults fed a corn-soybean oil meal ration adequately 
supplemented with vitamin Bx2» Penicillin was added to the 






basal ration at levels of 22, Ijli-, and 88 milligrams per 
kilogram of ration. The greatest response was obtained 
on the higher level (88 milligrams per kilogram) whereas 
the least response was obtained on the basal ration 
supplemented with 1*4 milligrams of penicillin per kilogram 
of ration. The response as a result of the addition of 
penicillin, however, was irregular and could not be 
attributed to the amount of the antibiotic consumed. 
Somewhat similar results were reported by Davis and Briggs 
(1951). These workers obtained an increased rate of 
growth of chicks when a corn-soybean oil meal ration 
adequate in vitamin Bqp was supplemented with either 
penicillin, aureomycin, terramycin or streptomycin. The 
results indicated that a level of 25 milligrams of 
penicillin per kilogram of ration appeared to be as 
effective as did a level of 50 milligrams. The degree 
of response, however was irregular and stimulation of 
growth did not occur in all cases. When stimulation did 
occur, equal effects were obtained by the addition of 
either penicillin, bacitracin, aureomycin, or terramycin. 
Streptomycin, however, did not appear to be as active as 
the others. The results of feed efficiency data indicated 
that the addition of each antibiotic resulted in improved 
feed utilization. 



6 


Branion and Hill (1951) studied the effect of the 
addition of penicillin at a level of 25 milligrams per 
kilogram of ration to two basal rations, one containing 
animal protein and the other a soybean oil meal - cereal 
grain diet. The addition of penicillin resulted in improved 
growth of turkey poults, when added to either of the above 
rations. The addition of penicillin to the ration containing 
animal protein did not improve feed efficiency, but an 
improvement was evident when penicillin was added to the 
plant protein ration* 

Although most of the reports which have appeared 
in the literature have dealt with the effect of the addition 
of penicillin to chick or poult rations, a few studies have 
been conducted on the effect of the addition of penicillin 
to broiler, laying and breeding rations. Reynolds, Runnels 
and Waller (1951) £&d a practical type mash containing five 
percent fishmeal, two and one-half percent dried whey and 
no vitamin B ^2 supplement to broilers grown in batteries. 

The mash was supplemented with penicillin at levels of 2.2, 
and milligrams per kilogram of ration respectively. A 
level of 2.2 milligrams of penicillin per kilogram of ration 
appeared to be near the optimum level for maximum growth 
response. In a further experiment Runnels, Reynolds and 
Waller (I 95 I) obtained data on the influence of various 






7 


levels of penicillin and streptomycin on the rate of growth 
and feed efficiency in broiler diets* A complete practical 
type mash containing five percent meat scraps but no APP 
Supplement was fed as the basal diet. Penicillin or 
streptomycin were added to the basal ration at varying levels. 
Analysis of the results showed that 2.2 milligrams of 
penicillin per kilogram of ration produced the greatest gains 
and most efficient feed utilization. 

In experiments with laying hens, Halick and Couch 
(I95I) studied the effect of additions of aureomycin, 
penicillin and streptomycin to a purified diet deficient 
in vitamin B12. It was observed that the addition of either 
penicillin or aureomycin appeared to stimulate the hatchability 
of eggs in the early part of the trial. In a later report 
Elam, Gee and Couch (1951) noted that the addition of 
penicillin resulted in an increase in hatchability of eggs 
from hens fed a vitamin B12 deficient diet. It was also 
observed that production rate was improved when penicillin 
was added to the diet of pullets injected with vitamin Bi2* 

Aureomycin 

Aureomycin has been shown to be effective in 
stimulating the rate of growth of chicks and turkey poults. 

The initial studies, which led to the establishment of the 
effectiveness of aureomycin, in this regard were conducted

using a vitamin B 12 fermentation product (APP Supplement) 
which also contained aureomycin. Stokstad et al . ( 19 ^ 9 ) 
reported that such a product contained an unidentified 
growth factor(s) since the growth response was greater than 
that produced by vitamin B^> alone* Similar results were 
reported by Singsen and Matterson ( 19 ^ 4 - 9 ^ i n studies with 
chicks, and by Cunha et al * (I9I1.9) studies with pigs. 

In a further report Stokstad and Jukes (I95O) showed that 
the unidentified chick growth factor(s) present in the 
APP Supplement was probably aureomycin since the addition 
of pure aureomycin to a vitamin Bx2 adequate diet stimulated 
the rate of growth of chicks to the same extent as the APP 
Supplement* Chemical fractionation of the APP Supplement 
showed some similarity between the distribution of aureomycin 
and the unidentified growth factor. 

The effectiveness of aureomycin in stimulating 
rate of growth of chicks was confirmed by G-roschke and 
Evans ( 195 °)• Aureomycin was added to the basal diet at 
a level of 100 milligrams per kilogram of diet and the APP 
Supplement (Lederle) was used at a level of one percent of 
the diet. 

The results of a number of studies on the use of 
pure aureomycin soon appeared and further confirmed the 
effectiveness of the antibiotic in stimulating growth of 
chicks and poults. Whitehill, Oleson and Hutchings (I95O) 





9 - 


reported that aureomycin at a level of 25 milligrams per 
kilogram of ration was as effective as a whole Streptomyces 
aureofaciens mash in increasing rate of growth of chicks. 

The growth promoting effect was not limited to vitamin B\z 
deficient chicks or to chicks fed a corn-soybean oil meal 
diet since chicks obtained from a commercial hatchery and 
fed several diets responded to the addition of aureomycin. 

McGinnis et al . (I95I) reported that a level of 
25 milligrams of aureomycin per kilogram of ration 
stimulated the growth of poults from vitamin B]_£ deficient 
breeders when fed either a corn-soybean oil meal diet or a 
corn-fi slime al diet. Branion and Hill (I95I) found the 
same level (25 milligrams per kilogram of ration) was 
effective in promoting the growth of turkey poults from 
breeders fed a diet adequate in vitamin 

A number of studies have been conducted using an 
APP Supplement (Lederle) which contained aureomycin. Reed 
and Couch (I95O) found that the addition of an APP Supplement 
(Lederle) at levels of O.25, O.5O and 1 percent of the diet 
resulted in a decided increase in the weight of chicks with 
each level fed. Biely et al . (I95I) reported that the 
addition of an APP Supplement (Lederle) at levels of O.J 
and 0.5 percent to either an all vegetable ration or to a 
ration containing fishmeal resulted in a marked increase 
in the rate of growth of chicks as compared to chicks fed

an APF Supplement containing only vitamin (Merck APF-3). 

Similar evidence of a growth promoting effect has been 
reported by Johnson (1950)5 Peterson et al . (I95O); Couch and 
German (I95O); and McGinnis et al . (I95O). 

While most of the reports in the literature indicate 
that aureomycin or APP Supplements containing aureomycin 
result in an improved rate of growth there are some indications 
that a growth response is not always obtained* Sherwood and 
Couch (I95O) found that when a corn-soybean oil meal basal 
diet was supplemented with 1 percent of an APP Supplement 
(LederleJ the growth rate obtained was only comparable to 
that obtained when the basal diet was supplemented with lj. 
percent fish solubles. Scott and Glista (I95O) obtained 
excellent growth of chicks when fed a corn-soybean oil meal 
ration fortified with the known vitamins including crystalline 
vitamin B^* The addition of aureomycin at a level of 3O 
milligrams per kilogram of ration did not improve its ability 
to promote chick growth. A slight response in growth rate 
was obtained during the first few weeks with ad libitum 
feeding but none was obtained when the feed intake was 
equated. Patrick (1951) reported that feeding of antibiotics 
can result in growth stimulation; however the degree of 
stimulation cannot be accurately predicted. Similar results 
were reported by Davis and Briggs ( 1951 ). These workers

obtained growth stimulation in most cases, but not in all, 
when a practical corn-soybean oil meal ration was supplemented 
with aureomycin at levels of 10 and 25 milligrams per kilogram 
of ration. No better results were obtained by adding 
aureomycin plus another antibiotic over that obtained with 
aureomycin alone. 

Little information is available in the literature 
to indicate the effect on the growth rate of broilers of 
feeding aureomycin or APF Supplements containing aureomycin. 
Berg et al ., however, (I95O) noted that the addition of an 
APF Supplement (Lederle) to a high energy ration resulted 
in a significant increase in rate of growth of fryers. The 
APF Supplement was added to the ration at a level of O.25 
percent. 

A few studies have been conducted on the effect of 
aureomycin supplementation on egg production and hatchability. 
Reid et al . (I95I) noted that the egg production of Single 
Comb White Leghorn hens was increased when either an APF 
Supplement (Lederle) containing aureomycin (1 percent of 
the ration) or crystalline aureomycin (66 milligrams per 
kilogram of ration) was added to a corn-soybean oil meal 
ration. On the other hand. Carver et al . (I95I) reported 
that the addition of aureomycin (10 milligrams per kilogram 
of ration) resulted in no improvement in rate of egg 
production. 







' .. r , - i xi< 






12 


In studies with breeding birds Carlson et al . (I95I) 
noted no improvement in hatchability of turkey eggs from 
breeders fed a ration supplemented with crystalline aureomycin 
Peterson et al . (1952) reported that the feeding of pure 
streptomycin or aureomycin did not improve hatchability when 
fed to Single Comb White Leghorn hens receiving a sub- 
optimal level of vitamin B]_2« 

Mode of Action of Antibiotics 

Several theories have been advanced as possible 
explanations of the mechanism by which antibiotics produce 
their growth promoting effects* It has been widely assumed, 
primarily as a result of failure to obtain a growth response 
from the injection of antibiotics (Groschke and Evans, I95O; 
McGinnis et al * 19 ^ 0 ; Whitehi 11 et al . 1950 )> that the 
growth response obtained from the ingestion of antibiotics 
was a result of the action of the antibiotic upon the 
intestinal microflora* Groschke (19505 stated that ,f It is 
believed that antibiotics stimulate growth indirectly by 
changing the intestinal microflora from “undesirable” to 
“desirable” types and that unknown factors synthesized by 
the desirable types are responsible for the growth effect”. 
McGinnis ( 195 °) suggested three possible methods by which 
antibiotics may exert their influences: ”(a) stimulation 
of intestinal synthesis of vitamins by bacteria, (b) 
reduction in total numbers of bacteria in the tract with a

lowering of competition between microorganisms and host 
animal for nutrients and (c) the inhibition of harmful 
bacteria which may be mildly pathogenic or toxin producing. 
The work of Groschke and Evans (I95O) supports the first 
proposal, since the addition of known vitamins at a high 
level to the diet reduced the response to antibiotics. 
Further support for the theory that antibiotics affect 
vitamin synthesis was presented by Biely and March (I95I), 
who found that the addition of aureomycin to rations 
containing sub-optimal amounts of riboflavin, niacin or 
folic acid resulted in growth comparable to that obtained 
when optimum levels of the vitamins were used. McGinnis 
(I95O) reported data which supports the theory that 
antibiotics inhibit harmful bacteria. They found that 
the addition of either penicillin or terramycin completely 
prevented the growth of Clostridium (probably welchii ) in 
the intestinal tract of turkeys. 

Branion and Hill (1951) presented evidence that 
the mode of action of antibiotics is more complex than the 
theories, mentioned above, would indicate. In experiments 
conducted with turkey poults fed a corn-soybean oil meal 
ration, the addition of Chloromycetin failed to initiate 
a growth response or improve feed efficiency. According 
to these workers there are at least three possible 
explanations why Chloromycetin failed to influence growth 








111 -. 

or feed efficiency: n (l) some antibiotics have no effect on 
intestinal flora, (2) some antibiotics are too general in 
their action destroying all microorganisms both beneficial 
and harmful, or (3) the action of antibiotics is more 
specific than has been thought. w An explanation of this 
kind is necessary if the theory that antibiotics bring 
about the beneficial response by some effect upon the 
intestinal microflora is to be accepted. 

While a number of possible ways by which antibiotics 
exert their growth promoting effect have been advanced, the 
actual mode of action of the antibiotics in growing rations 


is not clear

experiments AT THE UNIVERSITY OP ALBERTA 

Experiments were designed to study: 

I. The use of an antibiotic (penicillin) in 
breeding rations. 

II. The use of antibiotics in chick rations. 

III. The use of antibiotics in broiler rations. 

I. The Use of an Antibiotic (penicillin) in Breeding Rations. 

Status of the Problem 

A limited number of studies have been published on 
the use of penicillin in laying and breeding rations. 

Results of these trials have indicated that the addition of 
penicillin to certain types of rations may stimulate both 
production and hatchability (see "Review of Literature"). 
However the reports have provided no information on the 
effect of the addition of penicillin to breeding rations 
of the type commonly used in Alberta* nor on rations 
containing adequate levels of vitamin Bi2* Further* there 
was no indication of what the effect might be on a ration 
in which the energy or protein content was varied. 

Consequently a trial was initiated to study the effect of 
the addition of penicillin to diets adequate in vitamin B^2 
but varying in protein and energy content.

Experimental 

Single Comb White Leghorn pullets were used in the 
present study. For five weeks preceding the start of the 
experiment the birds were fed a practical all-mash ration. 

At the end of the pre-experimental period one hundred and 
ninety-eight pullets were selected, weighed individually 
and divided into six comparable lots of thirty-three pullets 
each. The birds were placed in floor pens with straw litter. 
The litter was changed every two weeks. The birds were 
handled and weighed every twenty-eight days. Feed and water 
were supplied ad libitum . The experiment was terminated at 
the end of three hundred and thirty-six days. 

At the end of the experiment two hens were killed 
from each group and the livers were removed for riboflavin 
assay. The livers were prepared for assay in the same 
manner as reported by Clandinin ( 19 ^ 6 ). The microbiological 
assay method was the same as that used by Clandinin (I9I4.9) 
but adapted for riboflavin assay. The test organism used 
was Lactobacillus casei . 

Records were kept throughout the experimental 
period on mortality, production, feed consumption, body 
weight, fertility and hatchability. Rate of production 
was calculated on both a hen-day basis and on a hen-housed 
basis.

The rations fed the experimental lots are shown in 
Table 1 . Ration 1 represents a type of breeding ration 
commonly used in Alberta. Ration 3 was similar to ration 1 
except that the level of protein was reduced to thirteen 
percent. Ration 5 was modified by increasing the level 
oats, barley, bran and shorts and decreasing the level of 
wheat and corn to give a low energy type ration. Rations 2 , 
I4. and 6 are the same as rations 1 , 3 an & 5 respectively 
except that an APP Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing 
penicillin was added to each in place of the APP Supplement 
(Merck APF-3) containing no penicillin. 

Results and Discussion 

The effect of penicillin supplementation on 
percentage mortality, rate of production, feed efficiency 
and average weight is presented in Table 2 . 

It is evident from the results that the use of 
penicillin had.no effect on percent mortality, rate of 
production, feed efficiency or average body weight of the 
different lots. These results are not in agreement with 
those reported by Elam et al . (1951). However, the 
experimental conditions differed widely in that the above 
workers added a higher level of penicillin (thirty-three 
milligrams per kilogram) to the diet, and in addition 
sub-optimal levels of vitamin were fed.

Under the conditions of the experiment, no effect on 
percent mortality, rate of production, feed efficiency or 
average body weight was obtained as a result of variations 
in protein and energy levels of the ration« 

The results presented in Table J, show the effect of 
additions of penicillin to the ration on apparent fertility 
and hatchability. No differences in apparent fertility or 
hatchability were noted as a result of supplementing the 
diet with penicillin or varying the protein or energy level 
of the ration. The results differ from those of Halick et al« 
(195-^ and Elam, Gee and Couch ( 1951 ) who reported a 
stimulation in hatchability as a result of penicillin

hatchability was high in all the experimental lots as compared 
to a low level of hatchability reported by the above workers.

On the basis of the results obtained it would 
appear that the addition of a low level of penicillin to 
rations adequate in vitamin B 12 and other vitamins did not 
result in an improved level of egg production, feed 
efficiency, fertility or hatchability. 

The results of the riboflavin assays (Table 3 ) 
indicate that the various treatments had no effect on 
riboflavin storage. The riboflavin content of the livers 
compare very favorably with those reported by Stamburg 
et al . (I 9 I 4 . 7 ) for Single Comb White Leghorn hens fed an 


all madi diet.

II. The Use of Antibiotics in Chick Rations 


Status of the Problem 

The growth promoting effect usually obtained from 
the inclusion of antibiotics in chick rations has been 
indicated in the "Review of Literature". Their use in 
growing rations has been regarded by many as one of the 
major advances in poultry feeding. In the past few years, 
antibiotics were available both in the pure form and as 
APP Supplements containing antibiotic activity. It 
therefore seemed advisable to study the effect of additions 
of these supplements to chick starting rations. 

Trial 1 


Object 

To study the relative efficacy of two APP 
Supplements, one of which contained penicillin (Merck APP-8) 
and the other aureomycin (Lederle APP- 5 )• 


Experimental 

Six hundred and forty day-old Single Comb White 
Leghorn chicks were divided into sixteen lots of forty 
chicks each. The chicks were raised in electrically heated 
batteries with raised screen floors. Peed and water were 
supplied ad libitum . The experiments were terminated at 
twenty-eight days at which time the birds were weighed 
individually.

The basal rations used in the trial are shown in 
Table 1 |.. The two basal rations differed in the source of 
protein and in the level of vitamin B12. Basal 1 was a 
corn-soybean oil meal type of diet deficient in vitamin B12, 
whereas Basal 2 contained five percent of fishmeal which

supplied sufficient vitamin B]_2 for good growth and which 
might be expected to give a greater growth response from 
antibiotic supplementation since McGinnis et al . (1951) 
have reported that a greater growth response of ooults to 
antibiotic supplementation was obtained when fish meal was 
included in the diet. 

Results and Discussion 

The APF Supplement used, level of supplementation, 
percentage mortality and average weights of the lots are 
shown in Table 5. 

In the lots fed Basal 1 (Lots 1 - 8 ) the addition 
of an APF Supplement containing penicillin (Lots Ij., 6 and 8) 
resulted in an increase in growth rate as compared to the 
basal ration supplemented with vitamin B12 alone (Lot 2 }. 

The optimum level of supplementation appeared to be one 
pound of Supplement (Merck APF-8) per ton of ration 
(equivalent to two grams of penicillin per ton of ration). 

The addition of an APF Supplement containing 
aureomycin gave similar results (Lots 3* 5 and 1 ) * The 
optimum level in this case appeared to be five pounds of 
APF Supplement (Lederle APF-5) per ton of ration (equivalent 
to eight to nine grams of aureomycin per ton). 

In the lots fed Basal 2 (Lots , however, 

the addition of the APF Supplement containing penicillin 
(Lots 12 , llj. and l6) or the addition of a vitamin B12 
Supplement containing aureomycin (Lots 11 , 13 and 15) did

A growth response was obtained when either an 
APP Supplement (Merck APF- 8 ) containing penicillin or an 
APP Supplement (Lederle APF- 5 ) containing aureomycin was 
added to the corn-soybean oil meal ration (Basal 1). 
However, no response was obtained from the addition of the 
APP Supplements to Basal 2 which contained five percent of 
fishmeal. The failure to obtain a growth response when 
fishmeal was present in the diet does not agree with the 
results reported by McGinnis et al « (I 95 I) who noted that 
the inclusion of fishmeal in the diet increased the 
growth response to antibiotic supplementation. 

Summary 

(1) The addition of APP Supplements containing 
either penicillin or aureomycin to a corn- 
soybean oil meal diet adequate in vitamin 
B ]_2 resulted in an increased rate of growth 
of chicks• 

(2) The most effective levels of supplementation were 
found to be one pound of an APP Supplement (Merck 
APF- 8 ) containing penicillin or five pounds per t< 
of an APP Supplement (Lederle APF- 5 ) containing 
aureomycin per ton of ration. Thus the effective 
rates of supplementation were two grams of

penicillin or nine grams of aureomycin per ton 
of ration. 

( 3 ) The addition of either aureomycin or penicillin 
to a basal diet containing five percent fishmeal 
was not effective in increasing the rate of 
growth of chicks under the conditions of the 
experiment• 








28. 


Trial 2 


Object 

The previous trial had indicated that a greater 
response to antibiotic supplementation was obtained on a 
corn-soybean oil meal diet. It therefore seemed possible 
that the response might be related to the vitamin B]_2 
content of the ration and the carry-over of vitamin B ]_2 
in the chick. Consequently a study was initiated, using 
both vitamin B 12 - deficient chicks and normal chicks to 
determine the effect of additions of an APP Supplement, 
penicillin and aureomycin alone, and in combination, to a 
corn-soybean oil meal ration. 

Experimental 

Two sources of day-old Single Comb White Leghorn 
chicks were used in this study. The vitamin B^-deficient 
chicks were progeny of hens fed a corn-soybean oil meal 
ration which has been shown to produce chicks of low vitamin 
B^2 reserves (Clandinin and Robblee 195^* unpublished). The 
normal chicks were progeny of hens fed a ration containing 
adequate amounts of vitamin . Only a limited number of 
deficient chicks were available and as a consequence four 
series were necessary to complete the trial. Each group 
consisted of fifteen chicks. In the case of the normal chicks 
duplicate lots of twenty-four chicks were used in each group.

The experimental procedure followed was the same 
as that employed in Trial 1* The basal ration fed had the 
following composition: ground corn, I4.O.5, wheat bran 10, 
wheat middlings 10, dehydrated alfalfa meal 5, soybean oil 
meal 30, limestone grit 2, bonemeal 1*5, iodized salt .5, 
fish oil (2l4.OOA-l4.OOD) .5, manganese sulfate .025 gm., 
thiamine 0.3, riboflavin 0.6, niacin 5.0, calcium 
pantothenate 2.0, pyridoxine hydrochloride O.I4, choline 
chloride 5O, para-aminobenzoic acid 10, biotin 0.02, folic 
acid O.O5, menadione O.O5, alpha-tocopherol 0.3 milligrams. 

Results and Discussion 

The treatments used and the average weight at 
twenty-eight days of age of both the deficient and normal 
chicks are presented in Table 6. 

In the four series conducted using vitamin B12- 
deficient chicks it is evident that the addition of an APP 
Supplement containing vitamin B]j? to the basal ration 
(G-roups 2 and 6) resulted in a marked increase in growth 
rate as compared to the groups receiving the basal ration 
(Groups 1 and 5). The magnitude of the response was 
similar to that reported by other workers (Rubin and Bird 
I9I4-6 and Robblee et al » I9I4.8). 

The addition of penicillin resulted in a 
stimulation in growth rate in Group 3, Series 1, but not

in the corresponding group in Series 2 . The response, 
however, was much less than that obtained from the addition 
of an APF Supplement containing vitamin B12• The addition 
of both the APP Supplement and penicillin (Group Ij.) resulted 
in no appreciable increase in rate of growth as compared to 
the addition of the APP Supplement alone.

Additions to the basal ration were made at the following 
levels: Merck APF-5, 1 lb.; Procaine Penicillin G, 2 gm.; 
and Aureomycin HCL, 10 gm. per ton of ration.

The addition of aureomycin resulted in an increase 
in rate of growth (Group 7) as compared to the unsupplemented 
group (Group 5)* The response was considerably greater in 
Series 3 than in Series I4.. A combination of APF Supplement 
and aureomycin also appeared to result in an increase in rate 
of growth although the response varied considerably between 
Series 3 an ^ Series I4.. The overall results with the deficient 
chicks appear to be in agreement with those of Patrick (I95I) 
and Davis and Briggs (I95I) who reported that the degree of 
response to antibiotic supplements was irregular and did not 
occur in all cases. 

In Series 5, in which normal chicks were used, 
the addition of the APF Supplement, penicillin, aureomycin 
or a combination of penicillin or aureomycin and the APF 
Supplement resulted in no appreciable increase in the rate 
of growth of the chicks. 

Summary 

( 1 ) Using chicks which were the progeny of hens fed a 
vitamin Bi2“deficient diet, the addition of 
penicillin or aureomycin alone or in combination 
with an APF Supplement resulted in an Irregular 
response in rate of growth. 

( 2 ) Using normal chicks, the addition of either 
penicillin or aureomycin alone or In combination 
with an APF Supplement resulted in no improvement 
in rate of growth of the treated groups.

Trial 3 


Object 

To determine the effect of additions to a ration of 
vitamin B12, penicillin, aureomycin and combinations of 
either penicillin or aureomycin and vitamin B ]_2 on the 
subsequent liver storage of riboflavin in vitamin B12- 
deficient and normal chicks. 

Experimental 

The chicks used in this study were comparable to 
those used in Trial 2 . Ninety-six vitamin B^-def icient 
chicks were divided into six groups of sixteen chicks each 
and two hundred and forty normal chicks were divided into 
six groups of forty chicks each. The experimental procedure 
followed was the same as that used in Trial 2 . 

The basal ration used had the following composition: 
ground yellow corn 39• 5 * wheat bran 10 , wheat shorts 10 , 
dehydrated alfalfa meal 5, soybean oil meal JO , ground 
limestone 2 , bonemeal 1.5, iodized salt 0.5, fish oil ( 2 I+ 00 A 
Ij. 00 D) 0.5, insoluble grit 1 , manganese sulfate 0 .25 gm., 
riboflavin 0.11 mg. The ration was calculated to contain 
two hundred and ninety micrograms of riboflavin per hundred 
grams of ration which is slightly sub-optimal for maximum 
growth.

The liver samples for riboflavin assay were obtained 
by taking five chicks from each group at one, fourteen and 
twenty-eight days of age. The chicks were killed and the 
livers were removed for riboflavin determinations. The 
livers were prepared for assay in the same manner as reported 
by Clandinin (I9I4.6). 

The microbiological assay method employed was the 
same as that used by Clandinin (I9I4-9) but adapted for 
riboflavin assay. The test organism used was Lactobacillus 
casei . 

Results and Discussion 

The riboflavin content of the livers of the chicks 
at one, fourteen and twenty-eight days of age is presented 
in Table 7 * The results indicate that the addition of the 
APF Supplement (Merck APF-3), penicillin, aureomycin, or 
combinations of either penicillin, or aureomycin and APF 
Supplement to the basal ration had no effect on the riboflavin 
content of the livers of the chicks. The livers of normal 
chicks contained a higher level of riboflavin initially 
than did the vitamin B^-deficient chicks but the difference 
was not apparent at twenty-eight days of age. 

The riboflavin content of livers of the normal 
day-old chicks was lower than the levels reported for 
day-old chicks by Clandinin (I9I1-6), who found that the

Prom the results of the study it would appear that 
additions of an APP Supplement, aureomycin or penicillin or 
combinations of the APP Supplement and aureomycin or penicillin 
had no effect on subsequent liver storage of riboflavin of 
chicks under the conditions of the experiment. 

Summary 

(l) The addition of an APP Supplement (Merck APP-3) 
penicillin, aureomycin or combinations of either 
penicillin or aureomycin and the APP Supplement 
to the basal ration did not result in an increased 
storage of riboflavin in the livers of either 
vitamin B12-deficient or normal chicks.

III. The Use of Antibiotics in Broiler Rations 

Status of the Problem 

In practical poultry feeding the producer is 
interested in the effect of the feed on the performance of 
the birds to the time they are marketed. The use of 
antibiotics in broiler rations has been reported to 
increase the rate of growth and feed efficiency of broilers 
to market age. However, the majority of the studies have 
made use of a corn-soybean oil meal type of ration. No 
information has appeared on the effect of energy level of 
the ration or level of protein in the ration on subsequent 
performance of growing birds fed antibiotics. It was 
therefore deemed advisable to set up trials to study the 
effect of antibiotics in broiler rations. 

Trial 1 


Object 

To study the effect of the addition of an APP 
Supplement containing penicillin on the rate of growth of 
broilers fed rations which varied in protein and energy 
content. 

Experimental 

Six hundred day-old Single Comb White Leghorn chicks 
were divided into six comparable lots of one hundred chicks 
each and fed the experimental rations shown in Table 8.

Lot 1 was fed a high energy type ration whereas Lot 3 received 
a high energy, low protein ration. The ration fed Lot 5 was 
modified to a low energy type ration by adding oats and barley, 
bran and shorts and decreasing the level of wheat and corn in 
the diet. The rations fed to Lots 2 , lj. and 6 were the same 
as those fed to Lots 1 , 5 and 5 respectively except that an 
APF Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing penicillin was added 
in place of the APF Supplement (Merck APF-3) without 
antibiotic. The chicks were brooded in radiant heated floor 
pens using straw as litter. Feed and water were supplied 
ad libitum . The birds were weighed at the termination of 
the thirteen-week experimental period. 

Results and Discussion 

The average weight of the different Lots at thirteen 
weeks of age is shown in Table 9 « In the lots fed the high 
energy ration, the addition of an APF Supplement (Merck APF-8) 
containing antibiotic (Lot 2 ) did not result in any increase 
in growth rate over that obtained with the APF Supplement 
(Merck APF-3) alone (Lot 1 ). The addition of an APF 
Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing penicillin did not result 
in a growth response when added to the high energy, low protein 
ration (Lot i^.). 

In the lots fed the low energy ration the addition 
of an APF Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing penicillin (Lot 6) 
resulted in a slight increase in growth rate over that 
obtained with the APF Supplement (Merck APF-3) alone (Lot 5). 





39 


The low energy type of ration itself (Lot 5) did not appear 
to support quite as high a level of growth as did either the 
high energy (Lot 1 ) or the high energy, low protein (Lot 3) 
types of rations. 

The birds were graded for fat finish at the 
termination of the experiment. No differences were noted 
in the grades of any of the lots as a result of ration 
treatment.

Prom the results of the study it would appear that 
the addition of an APP Supplement containing penicillin to 
either a high energy, or a low energy, low protein ration 
did not result in any increase in growth rate over that 
obtained with a vitamin Bq 2 Supplement alone. A slight 
response, however, was obtained when the vitamin B12

Supplement containing penicillin was added to a low energy 
type of ration. 

Summary 

(1) The addition of an APP Supplement containing 

penicillin did not stimulate the growth rate of 
chicks fed either a high energy or a high energy, 
low protein ration. 

( 2 ) A growth response was obtained when an APP 

Supplement containing penicillin was added to a 
low energy type ration. 

A low energy type ration did not support as high 
a level of growth as did either a high energy or 
high energy, low protein ration.

Trial 2 


Object 

To further extend the studies on the use of 
antibiotics in broiler rations. 

Experimental 

Day-old Single Comb White Leghorn chicks were used 
in this study. Four hundred and forty-eight chicks were 
divided into eight comparable groups of fifty-six chicks each. 
The chicks were raised in electrically heated batteries to 
five weeks of age and then were transferred to growing 
batteries and continued to thirteen weeks of age at which 
time the birds were marketed. 

The rations used are shown in Table 10 . Ration 7* 
a high energy type of diet, was similar to Ration 1 in the 
previous trial. Ration 9 > also a high energy ration, differed 
in that meat meal was the only protein supplement used. This 
change was made since it was known that meat meal is a less 
satisfactory supplement for chicks than the combination of 
protein used in Ration 7 and it was considered that such a 
modification might allow a greater response to antibiotic 
supplementation. Ration 11 was modified by reducing the 
protein level of the ration. Ration 13 contained the same 
level of meat meal as Ration 9 but the energy value was 
lowered by including a higher level of fibrous feeds.

Premix I contains 1 gram of riboflavin, 5 of calcium 

pantothenate and 5 grams of niacin in 10 pounds of shorts. 






















Rations 8, 10 , 12 and ll|. were the same as rations 7, 9, 11 
and 13 respectively except that 1 pound of an APF Supplement 
(Merck APF-8) containing penicillin per ton of ration was 
used in place of an APP Supplement (Merck APF-3). 

Results and Discussion 

The results obtained are shown in Table 11. The 
addition of the APP Supplement to the high energy ration 
with a mixed protein supplement (Ration 8) appeared to result 
in a slight increase in the rate of growth although no 
response was obtained in the previous trial. No response to

antibiotic supplementation was obtained on the high energy 
ration containing meat meal (Ration 10 ) or on the high energy 
low protein ration (Ration 12 ). 

When the level of energy in the diet was reduced 
(Ration 13) the addition of the APP Supplement containing 
penicillin resulted in an increase in average weight at 
market age (Ration 1I4.) . This agrees with the results obtained 
in the previous trial. 

Summary 

( 1 ) The addition of an APP Supplement containing 
penicillin was not effective in increasing the 
rate of growth of broilers on a high energy 
diet in which meat meal was used as a protein 
supplement or a similar diet of lower protein 
content. 

( 2 ) The addition of the APP Supplement containing 
penicillin to a low energy basal diet resulted 
in a response in growth rate.

Trial 3 


Object 

To obtain further information on the effect of 
additions to broiler rations of APF Supplements containing 
vitamin (Merck APF-3) or vitamin B ^2 and penicillin 

(Merck APF- 8 ) on the growth rate of broilers. 

Experimental 

Seven hundred and ninety-two day-old Single Comb 
White Leghorn chicks were divided into eighteen comparable 
lots of forty-four chicks each. The experimental procedure 
followed was the same as that employed in the previous trial 

The compositions of the basal rations used in the 
study are shown in Table 12 . Ration 15, a high energy type 
of diet, was the same as Ration 7 in the previous trial. 
Ration 18 was also a high energy ration but the protein 
content was lowered by decreasing the level of protein 
supplements (herring meal, meat meal and soybean oil meal) 
and increasing the level of wheat. Ration 21 was a low 
energy type of ration, similar to Ration 5 used in Trial 1 . 
Ration 2 l± was a low energy, low protein ration. 

Since the previous trials had shown a variable 
response to antibiotic supplementation it was considered 
possible that a response might be obtained if the birds 
were fed a corn-soybean oil meal ration similar to that

used by many American investigators. Consequently a ration 
of this type (Ration 27) was used. Ration 3O was also a 
corn-soybean oil meal diet but the protein content was lowered 
by removing a portion of the soybean oil meal and replacing 
it with a comparable amount of corn. 

The effect of supplementing the above rations with 
an APF Supplement (Merck APF-3) or an APP Supplement 
(Merck APF-8) containing penicillin was studied. 

Results and Discussion 

The additions to the basal rations, and the average 
weights of the birds at thirteen weeks of age are shown in 
Table 13. Prom the results presented it is apparent that 
the addition of either vitamin B 12 (Merck APF-3) or an APF 
Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing penicillin did not 
result in any appreciable increase in growth rate when added 
to a high energy; high energy, low protein; low energy, low 
protein or a corn-soybean oil meal, low protein basal ration. 
Although the addition of vitamin B12 (Merck APF-3) to a low 
energy basal ration did not stimulate any growth response 
(Lot 22), the addition of a vitamin B 12 Supplement (Merck 
APF-8) containing penicillin resulted in an increase in 
growth rate (Lot 23) when added to the same ration. This 
agrees with the results of Trials 1 and 2.

A significant increase in rate of growth was noted 
when an APF Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing penicillin 
was added to the corn-soybean oil meal basal ration (Lot 29). 

No response was obtained, however, when the ration was 
supplemented with vitamin B-^ (Merck APF-3) alone. 

Summary 

( 1 ) An increase in rate of growth of broilers was 
obtained when an APF Supplement (Merck APF-8) 
containing penicillin was added to either a 
corn-soybean oil meal or a low energy basal 
ration. 

( 2 ) No response to either vitamin B^2 (Merck APF-3) 
or vitamin B^2 (Merck APF-8) with antibiotic was 
obtained when these supplements were added to a 
high energy; high energy, low protein; low energy, 
low protein or a corn-soybean oil meal, low 
protein type of ration.

General Summary 

Three experiments, designed to study the effect 
of additions of antibiotic to rations of breeding birds, 
chicks and broilers, were conducted. The results of these 
experiments are summarized below: 

I. The Use of Antibiotic (penicillin) in Breeding- 
Rations . 

This study describes the effect of the addition 
of an APP Supplement containing penicillin on the performance 
of Single Comb White Leghorn hens fed rations which varied 
in protein or energy level. 

The results obtained indicated that the addition 
of penicillin to the diet of breeding hens had no effect 
on percent mortality, egg production, feed efficiency or 
average body weight of the birds. The apparent fertility 
and hatchability of eggs produced was not affected by the 
treatment. The riboflavin content of the livers of the 
treated birds was the same as that of the controls. 

II. The Use of Antibiotics in Chick Rations. 

Three trials were conducted to study the effect 

of additions of antibiotics to chick rations. In the first 
trial the relative efficacy of two APP Supplements, one of 
which contained penicillin and the other aureomycin was 
studied. It was found that the addition of APP Supplements

containing either penicillin or aureomycin resulted in an 
increase in the rate of growth of chicks fed a corn-soybean 
oil meal diet, but resulted in no increase when added to a 
diet containing five percent of fish meal. The most 
effective level of supplementation appeared to be one pound 
of an APF Supplement (Merck APF-8) containing penicillin or 
five pounds of an APP Supplement (Lederle APF-5) containing 
aureomycin per ton of ration. Thus the effective rates of 
supplementation were two grams of penicillin or nine grams 
of aureomycin per ton of ration. 

In the second trial, the relative effectiveness 
of addition of pure penicillin and aureomycin to a chick 
ration was studied. It was observed that the addition of 
either penicillin or aureomycin to a corn-soybean oil meal 
diet resulted in an irregular growth response when fed to 
vitamin B]_2-deficient chicks, and no improvement in growth 
rate when fed to normal chicks. 

The third trial was conducted to study the effect 
of additions to the ration of vitamin Bx2* penicillin, 
aureomycin or combinations of either penicillin or aureomycin 
and vitamin B^2 on the subsequent liver storage of riboflavin 
in vitamin B]_2-deficient and normal chicks. The various 
treatments did not affect riboflavin storage in the livers 


of the chicks

Ill* The Use of Antibiotics in Broiler Rations 

Three trials were conducted to study the 
effect of additions of an APP Supplement containing 
penicillin on the performance of broiler fed rations 
which varied in energy and protein levels. 

The results of Trial 1, indicated that the 
addition of penicillin did not stimulate the growth rate 
of broilers fed either a high energy, or a high energy, 
low protein diet* A growth response was obtained when 
penicillin was added to a low energy type ration. 

In the second trial similar results were noted. 
The addition of penicillin to the ration was effective 
in stimulating the growth rate of broilers on a low 
energy diet. No effect was obtained on the high energy 
or high energy, low protein diets. 

In the third trial the results obtained were 
in general agreement with those of the previous studies. 
An increase in rate of growth of broilers was obtained 
when penicillin was added to either a low energy basal 
ration or a corn-soybean oil meal basal ration. No 
response was obtained when penicillin was added to a 
high energy; high energy, low protein or a corn-soybean 
oil meal, low protein basal ration.
