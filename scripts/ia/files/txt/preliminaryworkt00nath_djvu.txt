PART I 


THE PRELIMINARY WORK TO THE POSSIBLE SYNTHESIS 
OP AN ISOMER OF IODOGORGOIC ACID. 


INTRODUCTION . 


Ever since the synthesis in the laboratory 
of thyroxine by Harington and Barger, research workers 

I 

have been impelled to find simpler compounds, possess¬ 
ing the same physiological activity. The structure of 
the compound, suggested by the above two authors, and 
one which satisfies all the chemical behaviour, 
attributed to the compound, is 



-ch 2 -ch(nh 2 ) -COOH. 


This is named systematically (3 - C 3,5-diiodo-4~(3’,5',- 
diiodo-4-hydroxy phenoxy)J phenyl- C>{ -amino propionic 
acid. 

Experimentally, it is known that two of the 
iodine atoms may be quantitatively removed from the 
molecule by means of hydriodic acid, whereas the other 
two are quite firmly bound. These are termed respective¬ 
ly, outer and inner iodines. Thus, the iodine atoms in 
the ortho position to the hydroxyl group, are outer

iodines, and may be introduced into the molecule 
directly by means of a simple iodination, and just as 
readily removed from the molecule through the agency 
of reduction. From an electronic standpoint, these 
iodines may be represented thus: 


11 


C : 


The two electrons are hence more closely 
attached to the carbon atom. 

On the other hand, the other two iodines 
belov/ the oxygen bridge, can only be introduced into 
the molecule indirectly and not after the linkage of 
the two phenyl groups and the oxygen has been established 
Thus, in the actual synthesis, they must be 
present in the benzene nucleus before coupling takes 
place: 




m 2 + HI 


Also, these two inner iodines cannot again be 


removed by ordinary means from the thyroxine molecule 




















-3- 


Representing this state of affairs roughly from an 
electronic standpoint, we have iodines of the type 
indicated: 



Here, the electrons are more closely attached 
to the iodine atom, and hence the iodine is stable 
towards reducing agents. 

This method of representing a valence bond by 
a pair of shared electrons, indicated by two dots, 
thus s , is the convention adopted by Lewis, and is to 
be preferred to that of Stieglitz\ according to which 
the carbon atoms of the benzene ring have alternating 
positive and negative charges, thus: 

-+■ * + 



-CH 2 -CH(RH 2 )C00H. 



The above structure indicates that two of the 
Iodines are positively charged, and two negatively 
charged* But care must be exercised in this terminology.

for we are not dealing here with absolute ionic 

charges, but only relative polarity. 

It is then believed that because of this 

peculiar combination of differently-acting iodines 

that thyroxine may possess its physiological behaviour. 

The ether linkage, though of interest because it is 

the only example of a diphenyl ether Isolated from 

biological material, is of secondary importance in 

determining the characteristic thyroxine action. In 

2 

this connection, Harington has found that thyronine, 
which is thyroxine, entirely devoid of iodine, but 
still retaining the diphenyl oxide structure, possesses 
none of the physiological activity of thyroxine. 


If then a compound is prepared possessing the 


two different types of iodine, and having the general 
configuration of thyroxine, this compound may exhibit 
thyroxine-like activity. It should then be highly 
interesting to prepare a comparatively simple compound 
satisfying these conditions. 


The compound iodogorgolc acid;

has two iodine atoms, which are both readily reduci¬ 


ble, and though it is found plentifully in nature. 


and intimately associated with thyroxine in the thyroid 
gland, yet upon isolation, it has little thyroxine¬ 
like activity. 

The isomer of this compound, however, 
2,5-diiodotyrosine 




is seen to possess all the above requirements. Will 
it also b© physiologically active? The object of 
this investigation was then to synthesize the isomer, 
a task which would be by no means simple. 

Before presenting this work, however, it 
was thought that a more detailed account of iodogorgoic 
acid itself might prove instructive• 

A STUDY OF IODOGORGOIC ACID 

It has been noted that the great importance 
physiologically of thyroxine, has led workers in the 
field to attempt to find compounds with similar 
properties, though less complicated in structure.

Ashley and Harington in 1928, reported the preparation 

of a series of peptides containing thyroxine, together 

with esters and other derivatives of thyroxine. A year 

4 5 

later Harington and Randall , and Foster practically 

simultaneously announced the isolation of diiodotyrosine 

6 

from the thyroid gland. Ingvaldsen and Cameron had 
already intimated that such a compound might he present. 
This, of course, added feasibility to the theory of 
Harington and Barger that thyroxine may be derived from 
diiodotyrosine, two molecules of which may undergo the 
oxidative coupling with the loss of the side chain of 
one. The work of such men has then been responsible for 
establishing the possible significance of this amino 
acid. Its discovery and isolation affords a classical 
illustration of the methods of biochemistry. 

Iodine had been known to be a constituent of 
certain marine organisms, but its importance in physiolo¬ 
gy has been appreciated only since the winter of 1895-6, 

when the reports of tv/o fundamental observations were 

7 

published. Baumann discovered iodine in the thyroid 

8 

gland of animals, and Drechsel " isolated a new iodine- 
containing amino acid from the horny skeleton of the 
coral Gorgonia Cavolinii. This substance, iodogorgoic

acid, as we know it, has the structure 



Drechsel carried out his investigation at the 
Marine Zoological Station in Naples during the autumn 
of 1894. He hydrolyzed the axial skeleton with hydro* 
chloric acid, and upon further heating obtained a 
copious evolution of iodine. He found that iodine was 
present in organic combination and could be precipita¬ 
ted by silver nitrate and decomposed by hot nitric acid. 
This was the first organic iodine compound to be 

isolated from animal protein. 

9 

Hundeshagen had done considerable analyses 
on several species of sponges and observed iodine 
contents up to 10 per cent. He had been unable to 
isolate the pure crystalline material, but had obtained 
a positive Millon Test and hence concluded that the 
substance was an iodotyrosine. 

In 1905, Henze^° took up the investigation. 

The protein of Gorgonia Cavolinii was proved definitely 
to be a protein by the isolation of the amino acids,

tyrosine, lysine, and arginine. He showed that it 
was not a butyric acid derivative as Drechsel had 
thought. It gave a xanthoproteic test, indicating 
an aromatic structure. The nitrogen content was found 
to be 3.78 per cent (calculated 6.11 per cent), the 
iodine was 57.3 per cent (calculated 55.46). It did 
not give Milion 1 s Test, but he made the shrewd 
observation that ortho-substituted tyrosine derivatives 
give a negative test. 

In 1905, Wheeler and Jamieson^ synthesized 
3,5-dliodotyrosine from 1-tyrosine and concluded that 
their product was identical with that studied by 
Drechsel and Henze. It was found that the 1-variety 
corresponded with the properties of the natural product. 
It is interesting to note here the analogy with 
thyroxine. 

12 

Oswald in 1909 demonstrated that the iodine 
of iodogorgoic acid is removed by enzymatic digestion 
and thus resembles the iodine of the globulin of the 
thyroid gland. He further demonstrated that the effect 
of the enzyme was to replace the iodine atoms by 
hydroxyl groups.

iodogorgoic acid from the common sponge• Sugimoto 
prepared It from the American Gorgonian coral, 

Plexaura flexuosa* 

This amino acid is widely distributed in 

marine organisms. The investigations of Hundeshagen, 

15 »* 16 

Mendel, Cook , and Morner are evidence of this* 

But the fact that it exists also In the mammalian 
thyroid glands requires that one attach more importance 
to it than has formerly been the case. It has little 
of the physiological activity of thyroxine, but then 
the two have small similarity in their chemical 
structures. One of the isomers of iodogorgoic acid, 
2,5-diiodotyrosine, will however possess a structure 
more electronically akin to that of thyroxine. Should 
it be synthesized, it would be interesting to study 
its physiological behaviour.

OUTLINE AND DISCUSSION OF THE INVESTIGATION 

The m-iodonitrobenzene used as the starting 

material, was prepared from m-nitroaniline according 

17 

to the method of Baeyer . Technical m-nitroaniline 
was converted according to the ordinary diazotization 
procedure into the diazonium salt. This was treated 
with potassium iodide, then with sodium bisulfite to 
remove iodine. It was finally mad© alkaline and steam 
distilled. The following reactions took places 



NaNOg ♦ HC1 HNOg * Nad 



On cooling the steam distillate, the crude 
nitro compound solidified. This was reduced directly 
with a solution of stannous chloride, hydrochloric acid.

and ethyl alcohol, the alcohol being used as a solvent. 

The m-iodonitrobenzene was added in small portions to 

the stannous chloride solution, care being exercised 

o 

to keep the temperature below 35 . 

The resultant reduction yielded m-iodoaniline, 
which was then obtained from the double tin salt after 
treatment with alkali and steam distillation.

■ 

The m-iodoaniline could be purified by a 
vacuum distillation, but for synthetic work this was 
found to be unnecessary. 

The next stage in the synthesis, viz., going 
from the amine to the phenol, had formerly caused the 
greatest difficulty. The amine was diazotized, using 










-12- 


excess hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite solution. 

The clear diazotized solution was then treated in the 

18 

cold with a slight excess of hydrofluoboric acid , 

prepared from boric acid and 52 per cent hydrofluoric 

acid. This excellent method for obtaining a solid 

diazonium salt, which was quite stable if well washed, 

19 

is given by the German workers Balz and Schiemann 

it 20 

and Wilke Dorfurt and Balz . The following reactions 
took place: 



The m-iodophenyldiazonium borofluoride was filtered 
off, washed with small portions of ice water, methyl 
alcohol, and ether, and allowed to dry overnight in a 
good current of air. 

The borofluoride was next treated with glacial 
acetic acid or a good grade of acetic anhydride, the

excess acetic acid removed by vacuum distillation, and 

the residue poured into water. The residue was then 

treated with sodium carbonate, and hydrolyzed to the 

corresponding phenol through the agency of sodium 

hydroxide. The method used was essentially that given

It was now necessary to introduce an aldehyde 

group. The Reimer-Tiemami reaction was utilized, accord- 

22 

ing to the method employed by Hodgson and Jenkinson . 

The phenol was refluxed for several hours, with calcium 
oxide, sodium carbonate, and chloroform, care being 
exercised to keep the temperature below 70° in order to 
minimize tar formation. The mechanism for the reaction 


is

Two isomeric aldehydes were obtained by this 


procedure. The isomer indicated in the above equation, 
2-iodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde was separated from 4-iodo- 
2 -hydroxybenzaldehyde by steam distillation, after 
removal of the chloroform and acidification with hydro¬ 
chloric acid. The ortho compound, 4-iodo-2-hydroxy¬ 
benz aldehyde was obtained in the distillate and was 
soluble in organic solvents. This is due to the chelate 
structure, which it possesses: 



The oxygen acts as the donor atom, donating 


two electrons to the hydrogen. The hydrogen is hence 
once co-ordinate co-valent. It is also connected in 
the phenolic form to an oxygen by a normal co-valent 
bond, and is consequently bivalent. The compound is 
non-associated and is accordingly soluble in non-associ¬ 
ate d liquids such as organic solvents. 




















-15- 


The para compound remained behind in the 


distilling flask due to its association. It therefore 
readily dissolved in water and could he crystallized 
from water, for the latter is an associated solvent. 



HO 



The above structure, then, represents the 

trimer corresponding to the association of three 

molecules of 2-iodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. 

The synthesis next consisted in coupling with 

hippuric acid by the procedure known as the Erlenmeyer 

Junior reaction. For the subsequent reactions the 

23 

procedure of Harington and Barger was followed. The 
para aldehyde was heated on a water bath with freshly 
fused sodium acetate, hippuric acid, and acetic 
anhydride. The coupling took place In the following 
manner;

Under the influence of the sodium acetate, 
the tendency is for the hydrogen on the nitrogen to 
migrate to the carboxyl group* Such a mechanism for 
the reaction seems reasonable. 

There was then formed:

The T carbon links itself with the carbon 
of the carboxylic group by the elimination of a mole¬

This formed the characteristically yellow 
azlactone, yellow due to the chromophoric group exhibi¬ 
ted by the nitrogen, and the carbon double bond.

The yellow azlactone was then converted into

an ethyl ester by the reaction with 95 per cent

reaction, the oxygen ring was broken and the compound 
-benzoylamino-2-iodo-4-hydroxycinnamic acid ethyl

By hydrolysis with very dilute alkali, this compound 
could he partially hydrolyzed, the ethyl group being 
more amenable to the hydrolysis than the benzoyl group.

The final two stages in the synthesis of the 
isomer of iodogorgoic acid from 2-iodo-4-hydroxy- 
benzaldehyde, have as yet not been gone through. Work 
is still being done in this connection, and it is hoped 
that within a short time the synthesis may b© success¬ 
fully effected. For the better continuity of the 
discussion, however, a short account of these procedures 
will be given. 

Harington and Barger, in their synthesis of 
thyroxine, had to contend with the lability of the 
iodine atoms. This caused considerable anxiety during 
these last two stages especially, for it was feared the

reduction of the compound would also eliminate the 
iodine. The problem was however solved by the use of 
hydriodic acid and red phosphorus. The yields were low 
because a simultaneous reduction and hydrolysis took 

24 

place. By the improvement of Harington and McCartney , 
viz., using acetic anhydride as a solvent, the reaction 
was made to progress more smoothly and very gratifying 
results obtained. The course of the reaction is:

The above authors next iodinated the free 
amino acid with concentrated ammonium hydroxide and 
iodine dissolved in potassium iodide. In our work, it 
is highly probable that only one iodine can be introduced 
in the ortho position to the phenolic group due to steric

hindrance :

We intend to follow this method. 

Through a synthesis using the ortho aldehyde 
obtained from the Reimer-Tiemann reaction, it was hoped 
to obtain a second isomer of the iodogorgoic acid. 
However, the fact that the hydroxyl group is situated 
in the ortho position to the aldehyde, makes it impossi¬ 
ble to obtain an amino acid. Instead there results a 
coumarin after the alkaline hydrolysis. The stages in 
the synthesis were similar to those undergone by the 
para aldehyde. By means of the Erlenmeyer Junior Reac¬ 
tion, the yellow azlactone was obtained.

Two gram molecules (276 g.) of m-nitroaniline 
was dissolved in the minimum amount of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid by heating. The solution was cooled 
to give the hydrochloride, which precipitated out in 
the form of blue crystals. This was diazotized by 
cooling to 5°, and adding 140 g. of sodium nitrite 
dissolved in water. To the cold diazotized solution 
(filtered if necessary) was added a solution of 350 g. 
of KI in water. A tarry liquid separated out. Upon 
treatment with sodium bisulfite to remove iodine, the 
supernatant liquid became clear and could be decanted. 
The dark organic liquid was then made alkaline with con 
centrated sodium hydroxide and steam distilled. The 
yield was 300 g. 

m-Iodoaniline. 

Two hundred and thirty eight grams of the 
m-iodonitrobenzene, as prepared above, was added in 
small portions to a cooled solution consisting of 300 c 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 700 g. of stannous 

















-24- 


chloride dihydrate, and 900 c.c. of 95 per cent ethyl 
alcohol. The mixture was kept well stirred, the 
temperature being below 35° throughout the 'reaction. 

The m-iodonitrobenzene was dissolved in this manner with 
a minimum amount of heating. The solution, which was 
yellow in colour, was then kept at an elevated tempera¬ 
ture for the period of one hour, to insure complete 
reduction. The solution was allowed to stand overnight. 
The white double tin salt separated out. When this did 
not take place, the solution was concentrated by evapora* 
tion of the excess alcohol, whereupon instantaneous 
precipitation took place. The tin salt was then made 
alkaline with concentrated sodium hydroxide, and steam 
distilled. To purify, a vacuum distillation was carried 
out, the amine distilling over as a light yellow liquid. 
It boiled at 139° at 9 mm. The yield was 129 g. 

It was found advantageous to work with no 
more than 250 g. of m-iodonitrobenzene at a time. 

m-Iodophenyldiazonium borofluorlde, 

One hundred and twenty-nine grams of m-iodo- 
aniline was dissolved in a minimum amount of hot con¬ 
centrated hydrochloric acid (about 1.5 litres). The 











-25- 


solution was cooled and the white hydrochloride crystal¬ 
lized out. A diazotization was carried out at 5° by 
the addition of 50 g. of sodium nitrite in aqueous solu¬ 
tion. To the clear, cold diazonium solution, there was 
added a solution of cold hydrofluoboric acid. The 
latter was prepared by adding solid boric acid in small 
portions to 210 g. of 52 per cent hydrofluoric acid 
contained in a paraffined vessel. The container was 
kept cold during the addition. A thick magma of the 
solid diazonium salt separated out. This was filtered 
off immediately and washed with 50 c.c. portions of ice 
water, methyl alcohol, and ether, the precipitate being 
sucked dry after each washing. The washing was essen¬ 
tial for the subsequent stability of the product. The 
white solid melted at 122°-124° (corr.), the melting 
point depending upon the age of the material. The yield 
was 105 g. 

m-Iodophenyl acetate. 

One hundred and five grams of the m-iodophenyl-

the evolution of nitrogen had ceased. The reaction 
mixture was then boiled for about fifteen minutes, 
cooled and concentrated in vacuo to remove excess acetic 
acid. Upon the addition of water, the acetate separa¬

The acetate was hydrolyzed with dilute sodium 
hydroxide. The solution was cooled and extracted with 
ether to remove non-phenolic impurities. The aqueous 
layer was acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, 
cooled, and again extracted with ether. The ether, 
after treatment with potassium bicarbonate, was dis- 
| tilled off, and the resultant dark-coloured phenol 
! solidified. It melted at 40° (corr.). The yield was 
40 g.

temperature being kept below 70°, The mixture was 
frequently shaken. The colour was at first fuehsine- 
red, but finally became orange as the temperature rose. 
The mixture was refluxed on a water bath for several 
hours. The orange-coloured alkaline liquid was allowed 
to cool after the excess chloroform had been distilled 
off with steam. The solution was then acidified with 
i hydrochloric acid and steam passed through until drops 
| of oil no longer came over. The distillate, consisting 
of the 4-iodo-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde and some unchanged 
phenol was extracted with ether, and the ether distilled 
off. The yield was 18 g. of crude aldehyde. 

The residue remaining in the distilling flask 
was filtered off while hot, to remove small amounts of 
tar which had been formed. This was then cooled, 
whereupon the 2-iodo-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, which is 
non-volatile with steam, separated out in light yellow 
needles. More aldehyde was extracted from the tarry 
material by boiling with charcoal and filtering. The 
yield was 8 g.

added, and the mixture heated on a boiling water bath 
for about one hour. The colour of the reaction mixture 
became yellow. Upon grinding the mixture up with water 
in a mortar, a yellow azlactone resulted. 

The azlactone was recrystallized three times 
from glacial acetic acid. It melted at 167° (corr.). 

The yield was 6.5 g. of pure azlactone-acetate.

SUMMARY . 

1. An attempt is being made to synthesize an isomer 
of iodogorgoic acid with the purpose in mind of 
obtaining a somewhat simpler compound possessing 
thyroxine-like activity. 

2. The possibility of a successful synthesis has become 
greater due to the highly efficient method which 
has been used to convert an amine into a phenol by 
means of the solid borofluorodiazonium salt. 

5. Several new compounds have been prepared during the 
successive stages of the synthesis.

PART II 

THE SYNTHESIS OF KETO-ISOMYRISTIC ACID . 
INTRODUCTION . 

The synthesis of higher aliphatic acids and 
their derivatives, of known constitution, is undertaken 
frequently for the purpose of establishing the structure 
of products isolated from natural sources. Since the 
conventional methods of extending carbon chains (involv¬ 
ing the successive additions of increments of one or 

two carbons) are scarcely feasible for lengthening them 

25 

by more than six atoms , it is advantageous to employ 

a procedure in which a long chain may be added in a 

single operation. Two such methods have recently been 

; developed: (a) the interaction of carbethoxy acyl 

chlorides, CO^CgHg-fCHg)n-COCl, with sodium derivatives 

of substituted (3 -ketonic esters, leading to ketonic 

26 

acids of the type, COgCgH^-CCHgJn-CHg-CO-R , a method 

given by Robinson and Robinson; (b) the selective action 

of Grignard reagents upon aldehydic esters, COgCgHg-CCHgJn 

-CHO, to produce hydroxy acids such as COgH-( C^Jn-CHOH- 

26a 

R , this method being according to Noller and Adams . 
i Subsequent reduction of the ketonic or hydroxy acids in

both cases yield the unsubstituted acids. 

27 

Pordyce and Johnson tried to devise a simpler 
method for adding large increments of carbon atoms. The 
fact that ketones can be obtained by the selective 

28 

action of Grignard reagents upon simple acid chlorides , 

suggested the use of the acid chlorides or acid chloride 

esters of dibasic acids to obtain ketonic acids of high 

molecular weight. These authors found that using 

n-hexyl- and n-octylmagnesium bromides with sebacyl 

chloride, gave the desired ketonic acids, viz., 

10-ketopalmitic and 10-ketostearic acids. Although the 

yields in these reactions were low (28 and 12 per cent 

respectively), rather similar to the yields obtained by 
29 

Tomecko and Adams in the synthesis of hydroxystearic 

acids, this is counteracted by the fact that ten carbon 

atoms are added in one operation. If desired, the 

reduction of the ketonic acids by the method of 
30 

Clemmensen could b© carried out. 

The advantages of the method of Pordyce and 
Johnson, using the interaction between Grignard reagents 
and dibasic acyl chlorides to produce the keto acids, 
were obvious. 


It was therefore desired in this work to

carry out the synthesis of XO-ketoisomyristic acid, by 
adding ten carbon atoms to the chain in one operation. 
Incidentally, an opportunity was afforded to acquire 
the technique of handling Grignard reagents in 
synthetic reactions.

QDTLIKE AMD DISCUSSION OF THE INVESTIGATION. 

To prepare the sebacyl chloride necessary for 
the synthesis, the thionyl chloride was first purified 
by refluxing with 1 per cent of aluminium chloride and 
1 per cent of sulfur, and then distilling off the liquid. 
The purified thionyl chloride was added to the sebacic 
acid, and the mixture was warmed and finally heated 
under reflux. The excess thionyl chloride was then 
removed by a vacuum distillation, and the sebacyl 
chloride finally distilled over. The reaction may be 
represented thus: 

HOOC -(CHg) 8 -COOH ♦ Cl -SO -Cl 
-Cl - CO - (CH 2 )q “CO -Cl * S0 2 *■ HgO 

The sebacyl chloride was then converted into 
9-carbethoxynonyl chloride. Absolute alcohol was care¬ 
fully added to the sebacyl chloride, the amount necessary 
for the replacement of one chlorine atom being used. 

This left a free chlorine atom, which could take part 
in the subsequent synthesis: 

Cl-CO - (CHg)g - CO -jc.Ob -ch 2 -ch 3 


C1-C0 -(CHg)g -COOCHg -CH 3 * HC1 










- 36 - 


It is evident why the ester was used instead of the 

monochloride. The free carboxylic group which would 

otherwise take part in the reaction and thus hinder the 

course of the synthesis, is present as an ester, and 

only the one chlorine atom on the other end of the 

carbon chain, is free to act. Using this modification, 

31 

first suggested by Davies and Adams , better yields 
of the fatty acid were assured. 

After the addition of the absolute alcohol, 
the mixture was warmed under reduced pressure and 
allowed to stand in a vacuum dessicator over potassium 
hydroxide to remove the copious fumes of hydrochloric 
acid which came off. 

It was now necessary to prepare the Grignard 
reagent. This was carried out in a special piece of 
apparatus designed for the purpose,consisting of a 
reaction flask, a mercury seal stirrer, a reflux con¬ 
denser, a burette, and an inlet tube for nitrogen gas. 
The requisite amount of magnesium turnings was placed 
in the flask, and covered with anhydrous ether, prepared 
by distilling commercial anhydrous ether from sodium. 

A part of the pure isobutyl bromide was added, together 
with a crystal of iodine to start the reaction. Some 



- 37 - 


heat had to he applied at first. The remainder of the 
alkyl halide in ether solution was added through the 
burette device over a period, of several hours, the 
mixture meanwhile being well stirred, and a constant 
stream of nitrogen passed through. This was necessary 
to prevent hydrolysis of the Grignard reagent. The 

! 

resultant solution was very dark in colour. The follow¬ 
ing reaction took place: 

? ? 

CH 3 - C -CHg - Br ♦ Mg —CH 3 - C -CHg - Mg -Br 

ch 3 ch 3 

The Grignard reagent thus formed, was added 
with stirring to the 9-carbethoxynonoyl chloride dis¬ 
solved in ether. The reaction mixture was allowed to 
stand for twelve hours and finally refluxed. Some iced 
hydrochloric acid was added to neutralize the magnesium 
hydroxide, the upper, fatty acid layer separated, and 
hydrolyzed with alcoholic alkali. Upon careful acidifi¬ 
cation of the alkaline solution, the ketonic acid 
separated out.

EXPERIMENTAL PART » 

Sebacyl Chloride . 

A mixture of 50 g. of sebacic acid and 75 g. 
of purified thionyl chloride was warmed at 50° for 
twelve hours and finally refluxed for one hour. The 
excess thionyl chloride was removed under reduced 
pressure, and the sebacyl chloride distilled off. It 
boiled at 144°, at 4 mm. The yield was 51 g. of pure 
sebacyl chloride. It is advantageous to distill this 
substance rapidly and in quantities not above 50 g. for 
a single operation. 

9-C arb e t hoxynono y1 Chloride. 

To the sebacyl chloride obtained as above, 

9.5 g. of absolute alcohol was added very slowly with 
efficient stirring. The mixture was warmed under 
reduced pressure, and finally allowed to stand in a 
vacuum dessicator over potassium hydroxide. The residu¬ 
al product was sufficiently pure for synthetic work. 

The yield was 48 g. of the ethyl ester. 

Isobutylmagnesium Bromide.

the reaction vessel of the Grignard apparatus. This 
was covered with 50 c.c. of anhydrous ether, added 
through the attached burette. Three c.c. of the pure 
isobutyl bromide together with a crystal of iodine was 
added to start the reaction. Stirring was begun and a 
very low temperature maintained for the first few minutes. 
The reaction was then allowed to proceed of its own 
accord. The rest of the alkyl halide (13 c.c.), dissolved 
in 100 c.c. of anhydrous ether, was added in very small 
portions during the course of the reaction. The 
addition took about one and one half hours. The total 
amount of alkyl halide taking part in the reaction was 
20 g. Stirring was continued for one more hour, during 
which practically all of the magnesium had dissolved, 
and the solution become dark in colour. A stream of 
nitrogen gas passed continuously through the reaction 
chamber during the experiment. 

IQ-Keto-isomyristic Acid. 

The Grignard reagent was placed in another 
vessel, and 25 g, of 9-carbethoxynonoyl chloride dis¬ 
solved in 50 c.c. of anhydrous ether was added drop- 
wise with constant stirring. The reaction mixture was 
allowed to stand for 12 hours. It was then refluxed

gently for on© hour, the product decomposed with 10 c.c. 
of iced concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the upper, 
fatty acid layer separated. This was made alkaline 
with alcoholic potassium hydroxide and refluxed for 
four hours. The ether and alcohol was distilled off, 
and the residue acidified carefully with hydrochloric 
acid. Keto-isomyristic acid precipitated out, contain¬ 
ing a slight amount of sebacic acid as an impurity. 

The fatty acid was brought into solution again 
with aqueous potassium hydroxide and diluted with water. 
The solution was cooled. Soluble impurities were 
removed by an ether extraction. The aqueous layer was 
again carefully acidified with hydrochloric acid. The 
acid which came out was extracted with ether, and the 
ether distilled off. The pure acid resulting from the 
above, melted at 52°-53° (corr.). The yield was 10- 
11 g.

SUMMARY. 

1. By the selective action of a Grignard reagent on 
an acid chloride ester of a dibasic acid, keto- 
isomyristic acid has been prepared.
