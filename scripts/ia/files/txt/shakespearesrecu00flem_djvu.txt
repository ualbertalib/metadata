INTROOTCTIOH 


1. 


Attempts to find Shakespeare’s philosophy in hiw 
works are generally discouraged by the notion that he is 
always dramatic and never expressed himself but always 
the character in hand# However, while recognizing the 
dangers, various scholars and critics have sought to 
piece out some conception of his personality from his 
works. Theories have been constructed on the evidence 
of the sonnets; J#D.Wilson, revolting against the "self- 
fi^isfied pork-butcher" of the Stratford Memorial, has 
tried to give us a "credible" Shakespeare; # and ]?rank 

# The iDasential Shakespeare (Cambridges University Press, 
19371. pp.viii, b . 

Harris in magnificent disregard of scholarly head-shaking 
gives us The Man Shakespeare ^ who is not even credible. 

#CHew York, I909). 

The problem may however be approached from a slightly 
different angle, by the study of the repetition of ideas 
in the plays* We may think of Shakespeare as having had 
no personal convictions upon anything, merely assigning 
to appropriate characters thought and sentiments which 
mean nothing to him personally. However, this conception 
seems absurd and unnecessary. Ideas are live things and 















2 


cannot be handled like so many counters. True 

Shakespeare Is primarily a dramatist, not a philosopher, 

but he could not be the great dramatist he is and hold 

aloof from the intellectual activity of his time. It 

is surely more natural to suppose that a man with an 

intellect keen enough to produce Shakespeare^s plays is 

going to make judgments on what he portrays. He could 

hardly have gone through life without betraying some 

predominant interests and acquiring some convictions. 

Assiiming then that Shakespeare had some permanent ideas 

which he may have embodied in his plays, how are we to 

discover what they were? The danger of taking any one 

speech out of its context or overemphasizing any one 

play, or any group of ideas which it pleases us to think 

may be Shakespeare's, is manifest. Miss Spurgeon bases 

her study of Shakespeare* s Imagery on the assumption 

that the poet unconsciously reveals his 

likes and dislikes, observations and interests, 
associations of thought, attitudes of mind and 
beliefs, in and through the images, the verbal 
pictures he draws to illuminate something quite 
different in the speech and thought of his 
character. # 


# (Cambridge: University Press, 1935) 


Thus she eliminates the subjective element as far as 
possible, by using the number of repetitions of an image 
throughout the plays as a criterion of his interest, and 













3 - 

by taking the plays as a whole, avoids the danger of 
getting a biassed viewpoint from any particular play. 

May we not use a similar method applied to the direct 
statement? Basing our conclusion broadly on the number 
of repetitions of an idea throughout all the plays, we 
may be able to discover what ideas were habitual with 
Shakespeare, part of the furniture of his mind. If we 
fimd him repeating an idea, in play after play in the 
mouths of irdifferent characters, if he shows a marked 
interest in expressing it vividly, if he introduces it 
undrajaatically, we are surely justified in assuming that 
it is one which interested him personally, in other words 
it is his own# It may be an original thought, peculiar 
to himself, or it may be a commonplace of the time which 
he has accepted but in any case it is likely to be his 
personal conviction* The pwrpose of this study is to 
gather all the recurring ideas and cross-references in 
the plays in the hope that they will give a coherent 
system of ideas which we may conclude with some 
probability to have been Shakespeare’s. 

Repeated dramatic idea© ov conceptions have also 
been collected which may yield information on the 
development of motives from earlier plays to their final 
expression in major works, and so reveal something of 
Shakespeare’s creative processes and methods of writing. 







4 


The general method employed has been to collect 
the references in chronological order {unless some 
advantage could be gained by other arreuigement) and to 
evaluate them according to certain principles. iSven 
Shakespeare is not always strictly dramatic* As an 
immature craftsman he is likely to introduce ideas for 
their own sake, regardless of their appropriateness to 
character or situation* Hence, if a speech is undramatic 
it has a higher value for our purpose. Again, he may 
create characters and situations for the sole purpose of 
expressing extraneous or irrelevant ideas. The whole 
play may be built around the expression of a single idea 
which dominates both plot and characters, as is the cease 
T*Ath» * but this is not common in Shakespeare. A 
more skillful way for a dramatist to introduce his own 
opinions or comments on the actions is to put them into 
the mouth of a minor character who is a nonentity or 
exists simply as chorus and commentary* Citizens and 
servants often serve this purpose, or the Sukes in the 
comedies may be pressed into service* Moreover an idea 
which is developed at inordinate length, out of proportion 
to the immediate dramatic necessity is likely to be one 
which interested the author, especially if it is 
expressed in vivid imagery, or consistently in the same 
imagery in various plays regardless of the speaker. Thus

in evaluating the material it is necessary to take into 


consideration the character of the speaker, the situation, 
and also, whether the speaker is a strongly conceived 
personality whose ideas are conditioned hy his character 
or a comparative nonentity who may easily he made the 
mouthpiece of the dramatist without violating dramatic 
fitness. The length and elaboration of the idea in 
proportion to its importance in the drama is a useful 
indication of the extent of the dramatist's interest in tt. 
There are some cautions to be observed. An idea which 
appears frequently may be counterbalanced by an almost 
equal number of recurrences of its opposite. The 
dramatist's attitude toward a character may generally be 
taken to indicate his attitude toward the ideas expressed 
by him: a favored character might be expected to voice 
Shakespeare’s opinions, represent his idea^ while a villain, 
or one treated unsympathetically would carry less 
conviction.* But this is not an infallible test since 
villains may express hypocritically sentiments Shakespeare 
would approve of, and dramatic sympathy does not 
necessarily carry with it endorsement of the ideas of a 
character,though it does lend weight to the probability 
they are the dramatist’s , With these reservations in 
mind viTe may take the consistency of an idea’s recurrence 
as the main test of its importance to Shakespeare.

This methodi it loust he admitted at the outset^ 
is purely experimental, hut, while it can arrive at no 
incontrovertihle certainties, it does establish strong 
prohahility in favor of the repeated ideas being 
Shakespeare’s own* Should the emergent prinoipiles fall 
into a pattern which is a credible system of beliefs, 
the probability will be strengthened to practical 
certainty* 

To make the study complete we should take into 
account the fact that many of the ideas which emerge are 
traditional themes common to all Sliaabethan playwrights 
and poets, and hence cannot be taken to Indicate 
Shakespeare’s individual tastes or beliefs. Consideration 
should also be given to the degree to which ideas are 
original and peculiar to Shakespeare or are accepted 
theories and notions of the time which he has adopted* 
Where a theme is obviously conventional or when an 
opinion is the commonly accepted one of the times, the 
fact will be noted, ]^aturally, for anything like 
complete certainty one ought to check the results of this 
study against similar studies of Johnon, Marlow, and 
others of Shakespeare’s contemporaries, but an awareness 
of all the difficulties involved ought at least to 
provide results not too untrustworthy* An examination 
of the echoes within Shakespeare’s plays should not only 
give us an insight into his creative processes and 




1 






methods of writing, and rereal the philosophy which 
underlies his plays, hut also, since a ina.n*8 ideas 
betray much of his personality, provide a checlc for 
various theories and other methods of probing 
Shakespeare*6 mind.

Shakespeare’s ideas on the family and on the 
state are intim?jtely related since he felt that the 
same principle governs them as controls the universe « 
For the miizahethan the universe itself was a compact 
and stable system of concentric spheres* ”a miracle of 
orucriea naimony”*#

On the same fundamental principle of order, harmony, 

and subordination hinges Shakespeare’s thought concerning 

the family and the state* and less explicitly, the mind* 

The mind is a microcosm* a little kingdom; the family 

is a sort of miniature state with the father at its 

head. These two conceptions, with the political ideas,

relations with those in the state between subject and 
lord; 


Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy 
keeijer, 

Thy head, thy sovereign: • * » » • 

Such duty as the subject owes the prince, 
/^ven such a woman ov/eth to her husband; 

And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, 
sour, 

And not obedient to his honest will, 

What is .she but a foul contending rebel. 

And graceless traitor to her loving lord? 

Added to this reflection is the idea that ill temper 
in a wormn destroys her beauty, and B^ore important, 
that since the husband provides for and protects the 
wife, she is bound to offer love and submission in 
return. Most of the passage is expressed in terms of 
state aiiwar, as if Shakespeare were thinking of the 
similarity between authority in the family and tha.t in 
the state* Portia uses the same comparison of uaarriage 
and the state in giving herself to Bass-anio* Speaking ' 
of herself she sayss 

Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit 
Gommits itself to yours to be directed, 

As from her lord, her governor, her king. 
Myself and what is mine to you and yours 
Is now converted; * .1*2*l6g} 

Here there is none of the exaggeration of farce there 

might have been in the speech of Katharina* In Hen.V .«

of state. There are other indications of the duties 
of wives to obey their husbands in lij., 2.2.147; 

OUx. ,i).2.196; and in Hen.Vlll .. 2.4. llff. and 2.4.132ff. 
The evil of women trying to rule men is remarked on in 
,4.1.36 and iiich»lll ., 1.1#62. and 4WW ., 1. i.94. and 
illustrated in such women as Goneril, 

2. Filial Duty , 

In the matter of filial duty the authority 

of the father is emphasized. Children are expected to 

accept the will of the parent without question.\ Proteus’ 

father in TGV . with his peremptory **What I will I will, 

and there’s an end (1.3*65)’* evokes no indignation and 

in Tg. . fathers are expected to be austere and surly 

(4.2.65 and 4.4.7) The Duke in liHD . who like so many of 

Shakespeare’s dukes, is a convenient mouthpiece for 

important ideas he ¥mnts brought out, says to Hermia; 

To you your father should be as a godj 
One that composed your beauties, yes and one 
To whom you are but as a form in wax 
By him imprinted and within his power 
To leave the figure or disfigure it. (1.1.47; 

Shakespeare seems most concerned v/ith the relationship 
of fathers and daughters, but in Rich.11 , it is empha¬ 
sized that Gaunt expects Bolingbroke to obey as his son 
even though he is a grown man, and in Lear v/e have 
Edmund telling hov/ he reminded Edgar, 
















13 


^ith how manifold and strong a bond 

'^ho child v;aa bound to the father. (2.1.49) 

iv ore often the probl m is the common one of the 
dau.rhter refusing the suitor chosen'by her father • as 
in the aassage cited from lEi) . and in TGV .. RJ . and in 
T .Atii, 1.1. Jsually the case for the father is stated 
very sticngly, but the sympathy goes to the daughter. 

The importancd of the father’s approval of the suitor is 
brought out in |^,,l.i.54ff. and fSjs., 3* 2.125. Offic¬ 
ially in the TS. Baptista does not make the marriage 
bargain till Kate gives her consent, but in practice 
she has no say in the matter. Similarly in hj. Capulet 
ik.y will to her consent is but a part** but when it 
comes to trial, his will is everything. This, however, 
reflects more the common Elisabethen marriage customs 
than Shakespeare’s viev/s. In TS, Bianca is a model of 
the dutiful child as she herself is at pains to point 
out (1.1.71 2.1.7»)» l>tt.t she is less sympathetically 
presented than the bumptious Katherine and what hapaens 
in 1S5. with Bianca is neatly cosmented upon in UMM * , 
2.1.54. where Antonio says to Hero: 

I trust you will be ruled by your father, 
and Beatrice quips: 

.... It is my cousin’s duty to make curtsy 
and say ^Father, as it please you.” But yet 
for all that, cousin, let him be a handsome 
f Ilow, or else make another curtsy and say 
'Father as it please me’. 









14 


tut again in Itb/VAU, the father arranges the marriage 
'md orders his daughter to accept it. Juliet’s elab¬ 
orate repentance of “the sin of disobedient opposition" 
enjoined by Friar J^awrence (4.1.17) is accepted by 
Capulet as the proper govermnent of daughters. Only in 
j^.WW, is the daughter’s side of the question stated at 
length and there Fenton defends Anne Page on the ground 
that her parents are being tyrannical in forcing her 
into a shameful marriage and “the offence is holy that 
she iiath committed” since thereby she avoids the 
“irreligious cursed hours” of a forced mrriage (5*5*250) 
Ihe fact,, that Anne’s parents are at odds, lessens Anne’s 
guilt. Shakesptjare* s solution of the problem of the 
conflict between filial duty and love would seam to be 
that expressed in 0th. and also in Lear . Desdamona 
excuses her conduct thus2 

I do perceive here a divided dutyt 
‘ To you I am bound for life and education; 

My life and education both do learn me 
How to respect you; you are the lord of my 
duty; 

....... but here’s my husband. 

And so much duty as my mother show’d 
To you, preferring you before her father, 
do much I challenge that I may profess 
.jue to the Moor my lord. ( 0th. .1. UI8I) 

Very close to this is Cordelia’s justification of herself 

Good my lord, 

Aou have begot me, bred me, loved mas I 
Return those duties back as are right fit, 














15 


Obey you, love you, and moat honor you, 

. ..Haply wh n I ahall wed 

That lord whose hand must take my plig ht 
shall carry 

Half my love with him,half my care and duty: 
Sure I siiall never marry like my sisters, 

To love my falher all, (iCL., 1.1,97) 

There is great similarity too between a passage in TGV . 
v/here the Ouke tells of hia daughter Sylvia’s disobed¬ 
ience and one in KL, 

neither regarding that she is my child, 

Nor fearing me as if I were her father- 
/Vnd, may I say to thee, this |>ride of hers 
Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her; 

And where i thought the remnant of mine age 
Should have been cherish’d by her child-like 
duty, 

I now am full resolved to take a wife, 

And turn her out to ¥/ho will take her ins 
Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower 
For me and my possessions she esteems not. 

C Td¥, ,l,l.7Qff.) 

One is reminded of Lear* s 

here I give 

Her father’s heart from herl ( hL. j1.1.127) 

I loved her most, and thought to set my rest 
C-n her kind nursery. , 1.1.12^) 

Thy truth then, be thy dower* f KL., 1.1,llQ) 
The same situation between father and son is dramatized 
in ./T. ,4.4. and there is a further reference to the sin 
of filial disobedience in Cm .,2.1.115. Shakespeare’s 
interest in the relationship of children and parents is 
evident from his many dramatic treatments of it, espec¬ 
ially in Xiear and from chance references as similes, as 


Hich. 11 ., ^.4.10., where apricocks are described as 












16 


"unruly children" which "make their sire atoop with 

Jl 

oppression of their prodigal weightThe idea that 

//Compare this with the use of garden imagery applied to 
the state* ^ee p, xtf. 

for the child to rebel against the father is an unnat¬ 
ural sin appears most often in Lear but also in 
liacb *,2*4 *37* Perhaps the clearest indication of 
Shakespeare’s sense of the duty owed by the child to 
the father is his mtmy references to the monfitrous criim 
of filial ingratitude (see chapter 11). When the father 
behaves tyrannically and abuses his authority, sympathy 
may go to the child who rebels, as it does to the rebel 
against a week or tyrannical ruler, or to the offender 
when the law is administered cruelly or is itself corrupt 
(see • But the child is bound to the father by 

natural law and when he lifts his hand against hie father, 
the essential bond of harmony in the family is cracked. 


.B» The State 

i. Order and Unity in the State. 

probably the most consistent and explicit of 
ohakespeare’s ideas %re those on the state. Fundamental 
in the history plays and implicit in all his work, is 
the necessity for stability in government, for order 













li 


In the long speech on the union of York and Lancaster 
Rt t?ie end of Klch. 1JX , (5*23fi%) Lngland is said to 
have been mad and wounded herself throughout the years 
of civil war* Similar in thought is the prayer which 
ends the play: 

Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord, 

That would reduce these bloody days again, 

And make poor England weep in streaias of 
bloodl 

Let them not live to taste this land’s 
increase 

That would with treason wound this fair 
“ land’s peaces 

How civil wounds are stopp’d, peace lives 
again: 

That she may long live here, God say ajnenl 

( 5 . 5 . 35 ) 

KichJI . expresses the same idea in the combat scene 
{ 1*3,125?-‘8} • In KJ. we get the picture of rebels march¬ 
ing upon the bosom of the land; 

Whereon we step after a stranger, march 
Upon her gentle bosom,, and fill up 
Her enemies’ ranks* (5.2i3^) 

This is repeated in Rich*II * 2*3*92 and later in Hi ch>iI « 

it is combined with the former idea of wounding: 

Though rebels wound thee with their horses 
hoofs (3*2*6 ff*) 

An expansion of this appears in lHen*lY* ; 

Ho more shall trenching war channel her fields 
Tor bruise her flowerets ¥^ith the armed hoofs 
Of hostile paces* # (1.1*7) 


# The idea of the state as a mother wounded by civil 
dissension is applied, to France in I .Hen»¥Ii * 3.3*^^. 

















n ^ 


and unity in the state* This principle is behind his 
denunciation of civil war, his belief in a strong 
monarchy and his contempt for the mob* 

The theme of unity in the state begins to 
express itself with the first historic trilogy, the 
three parts of Hen*Vl. * In I Hen*Vl * * ^* 1*72* v/e have 
Henry saying: 

Civil dissension is a viperous worm 
That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth* 

In 3nen,Vl ,4*l*4, comes the first expression of the 

idea that 

iilngland is safe, if true v/ithin itself, 

but here it is qualified by the doubt that an alliance 

with France would make it safer* KJ# onds with the 

bastard Falconbridge*a ringing assertion of the idea; 

This England never did* nor never shall 
^Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror 
But when it first did help to wound Itself.... 

.ITaught shall iiiake us rue 

If jingland to itself do rest but true* 

( 5 . 2 . 112 ) 

The same thought is negatively expressed in Rich. , 4 1 .. 
ngland is frequently personified'(as in Rich*II .^*46. 
3 » 3 * 97 )> often as a mother ( Hen.VX .^* 3*44. KJ*.5*2. 157 - 9 * 
RichXI .,1*3» 3Q6)* Civil war wounds her* In KJ. the 
rebels are compared to Uero, 

ripping up the womb 
Of your dear mother England « * • • • 

( 5 . 22 . 157 - 9 ) 


















19 


The evils attendant upon civil v/ar are kept 
constantly before us. In 3Hen.VI . the scene in which 
a father kills his son, and a son his father (2.5*}, is 
obviously engineered to bring out the unnatural acts 
occasioned by civil war. The women in Hich.II]^ have 
experiencedthe terrors of the Wars of the Roses, and 
Queen Elizabeth perceiving Richard’s designs on the 
throne cries, ^Welcome, destruction, blood, and 
massacre (2.4.50),” and the wise and long suffering 
juchess of York laments the return of civil commotion. 

I Hen.IV^ civil war is referred to as 

The intestine shock and furious close 
Of civil butchery. (1.1.10) 


Carlisle, in a long pr ssage in Rich.II. f oretells the 

evils to follow upon the rebellion of Bolingbrokes 

4 nd if you crown him, let me prophesy. 

The blood of :3nglish shall manure the ground 
And future ages groan for this foul act; 

Peace shall go sleep -with Turks and infidels, 
And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars 
Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound; 
disorder, horror, fear and imtiny 
Shall here inhabit, and this land be called 
The field of Golgotha a,nd dead men’s skulls. 

Oi if you raise this house against this house 
It will the Woefullest division prove 
That ever fell upon this cursed earth. 

Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so, 

Lest child, child’s children, cry against 
you *woet ( 4 , 1.136 ff.) 

A similar prophesy of dire effects from civil war 

appears much later in Antony’s vow of revenge for the

death of Caesar (^. 3.1.262). 

Equally insistent is Shakespeare* s v/liolesale 
condeirination of treason and traitors. Traitors alv/ays 
join with witches and the powers of hell ( IH 0 n,VlH 
2,2. 17 - 9 )* Treason against the king is a sin against 
God ( Rich,XlM l«2,:i8, I Hen,X¥« »l,^,l62ff,) and in 
Hen,V„ 2,2, where the treason of Cambridge, Scroop, and 
Grey is discovered, it is represented as the most hein¬ 
ous of crimes, in Macb, the sergeant says of a traitor 
that he is 


Worthy to be a rebel, for to that 
The multiplying villainies of nature 
1)0 swarm upon him, (1,2,10) 

Consistent also is the recurrence of the 

theme that he who seizes a kingdom by force can keep 

it only by bloodshed and crime. Throughout Rich,111 , 

runs the idea timt he is 

One raised in blood, and one in blood 
established, 

One that made means to come by what he hath. 
And slaughtered those that were the means 
to help himi (5*3.248-5^1 

In KJ, Pandulph elaboratess 

A sceptre snatched with an unruly hand 
Must be as boisterously maintained as gained; 
And he that stands upon a slippery place 
Tv/lakes nice of no vile hold to stay him up 

( 3 . 4 , 135 ) 


For he tliat steeps his safety in true blood 
Shall find but bloody safety and untrue, 

(3.4.147) 


end adds? 











21 . 

King Jolin himself realizes the seme thing (iCJ.4.2,103-5} . 
That this was Shakespeare’s own conviction is ma,de more 
likely by the fact that in Macb. we have a dramatization 
of this idea. Moreover, the reign of the regicide 
Hen.IV . is a series of rebellions and insurrections. 

There could be no lasting order under a usurper. 

The question remains, when, if ever, was 
rebellion justifiable? Obviously in a play like ^ 

Hen.VI . sympathy must go at times to the Yorkists, and 
in the rebels have a strong show of right on their 
Rich.II . is typical of the sort of problem play 
that Shakespeare’s political philosophy engendered. 

It is a mine of ideas about the state in which all sides 
of the question are expressed by one or other of the 
contending parties. The problem is similar to that in 
Hen.VI . and Marlowe’s Edward 11 .. a weak king, none of 
whose faults are minimized, opposed by a strong rebel 
to whom much sympathy is given, but in the end sympathy 
swings once more to the King.^ Considering Rich.II as a 

# In Marlowe’s Edward II . the king is treated unfavorably 
as a weak and perverted character, but in he^ or 

rather the crown as the ©acred symbol of majesty, regains 
our sympathy. #e havd in this play the vacillating 
character of Kent corresponding to York in Hich.ll . 

single play, one might say that Bolingbroke’© rebellion 






















22 


is treated favorably, but Shakespeare apparently Joad 

Hen*IV . series in mind when he changed the age of 

Hotspur in sich.Il * to coincide with that of Prince 

Kal, and there are other anticipations of the continuation. 

If we take the group of plays as a whole, we have to 

consi<^er as evidence of Siiakespeare’s convictions the 

trouble which dogs the usurping Bolingbroke and culminates 

in the tragic straggle in Hen♦ VI, (plays, however, whih 

had already "been written•) 

The excuses given by the rebels for their 

cause are nearly always the same# In Kich.III .#^♦2^4ff# 

Richmond tells his troops they are justified in fighting 

to put down a tyrant# The lords in KJ* regret the 

necessity of revolt. 

But such is the infection of the time 
That, for the health and physic of our right. 

We cannot deal but with the very hand 
, Of stem injustice and confused wrong# 

( 5 * 2 # 20 -. 3 ) 

Again in 2Hen.IV .,4#1#67 and 4#2#33» excuse is the 
same, that the wrongs of the time outweigh the evils of 
rebellion# The rebels are forced to rebellion to 
establish true peace. In this play occurs the strange 
scene in which }?rince Joiin of Lancaster breaks faith 
with the rebels on the ground that no faith need be held 
to traitors# John is never sympathetically portrayed. 














23 


but he is on the side to which sympathy goes anri nn 
condemnation of his act is expressed by the king or 
Hal, But perhaps it would be going too far to cite 
this as an indication of Shakespeare's attitude to 
traitors since it may be merely a dramatic fault due 
to the immaturity of the dramatist♦ 

of Konarchy , 


The crux of the matter seems to be 

Shakespeare's idea of monarchy# In the histories there 

are many expressions of the divine right theory# The 

sacredness of the king as the Lord's annointed appears 

in Hich,III ,,4,4#l^Q, 5#3#124j in EichiXli ,2#1#98, 

2 * 3 * 98 ; IHen#IY ##4»3*40 and gL#f3*7*5S* An extension 

of the principle is the idea ttot the subject must not 

Judge the actions of the king# . 

What earthly name to interrogatories 
Can task the free breath of a sacred king 

And shall the figure of God's majestyi 
His captain, steward, deputy elect, 

Anointed, crowned, many years, 

Be judged by subject and inferior breath, 

And he himself not present? 

( .Hich#II, ,4#X,l2^) 

The king is God's agent; hence to lift a hand against 
him is sacrilege* This is brought out by old Gaunt in 


Rich*II#i 


God's is the quarrel, for God's substitute

lo not the king's name twenty thousand 

names? ( Rich,II . 3.2.85) 

13ut considering the speakers tuese statements are 

chiefly dramatic and in each case they prove empty 

boasts. Breaking allegiance to the king is a serious 

breach of honor, as is brought out by the perplexity 

of old York in Rich.II . In 2.1.i63ff. he goes into a 

long exasperated account of the multiplying wrongs 

which have brought him to criticise his sovereign, 

concluding. 

And prick my tender patience to those 
thoughts 

Which honor and allegiance cannot think. 

( Rich.II . 2*1.20-8-9) 

He repeats the idea in 2.2.112. which is similar to 
Macbeth's assertion in 1.7.13 that he is bound in 
honor not to murder Duncan since the latter is his 
king. 

Does the foregoing, however, establish 
Shakespeare on the side of the divine right of kings? 
It is to be noted that these passages usually occur 
in the mouth either of the king himself or of one of 
his ardent supporters to whose advantage it is to 
express them, or of one who like York, wavers between 
his beliefs and his sense of right. On the other hand 
there is no reason why they may not have been Shake¬ 
speare* s own bdliefs, with certain reservations which 







1 











26 


will become evident as we look at th^ oth'^r ideas he 

expresses about kingship. 

Shakespeare seems to have been aware of the 

fact that in spite of the divinity that doth hedge a 

king, the latter was after all but a man, with human 

limitations* Goaded by his son’s banishment, Gaunt, 

when he is told by the young Richard II that he lias 

many years to live, bursts outj 

But not a minute, king, that thou censt give 
Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrov/, 
And pluck nights from me, but not lend a 
morrowj 

Thou canst help time to furrow me with age. 

But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage; 

Thy word is current with him for my death. 

But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breadth. 

i aieh.ll . 1.3.2226) 

Bven Richard, daszled as he is by the sacred splendor 
of kingship, realises finally that he is subject to the 
same needs as the rest of liumanity { Eich.IXt « 3*2*175). 
The idea is repeated in Hen.V* . 4.1*104 and £0., 1*2.97* 
The inability of kings to command health and repose is 
commented on with a slightly conventional ring in 
Hen.Y^ 4.1.268, but there is nothing conventional in 
Lear’s agonised 

They flattered me like a dog; . , they toMme 
I was everything; His a lie, bm not

T’hey do abuse the king that flatter him, 

For flattery is the bellows blows up sin • .• 
hereas reproof, obedient and in order 

Fits kings, as they are men, for they may 
err. ( 1 . 2 * 39 ) 

and there is an echo of Lear’s "when the thunder would 
not peace at my bidding (4*6*104)”, in the Temp .* 

What cares these roarers for the name of 
king? ( 1 * 1 * 18 ) 

The king was a man, but he must measure up 
to his position* The chief requisite of kingship in 
Shakespeare’s mind was "authority*’, the ability to 
command and control men* As early as I Hen*yi * 1 . 1 , 9 * 
the dead Henry V is coiMiended? 

Virtue he had, deserving to command* 

The theme is followed in part II where we have York’s 
aspiring 

Let them obey that know not how to rule* 

( 5 . 1 , 6 ) 


and his remark to Henry, 

Ho, thou art not king; 

Hot fit to govern and rule multitudes 
Which dare not, no, nor oanst not rule 
a traitor. ( 5 . 1 . 93 .J 

He adds that Henry is more fit to be a palmer but 
should give place to York "whom heaven created for thy 
ruler". In part III Clifford takes up the strain* If 
Henry had ruled with as strong a hand as his father and 
grandfather, York would not have been able to threaten 















28* 


him* Tht. Bast''..rd in ui^es John: 

Let not the world see fear and sad distrust 
Govern the motion of a kingly eye • • • • 
••••*♦* so shall inferior eyes 
Grow great by your example* (5*1*47) 

Finally in Rich*II , 3*3*200 Richard himself confesses j 

They well deserve to have 
That know the strongest and surest v/ay to get. 

that is, in the contest between a weak king and a strong 

rebel, the latter must win because he possesses the 

qualities of authority and leadership th£it monarchy 

demands. The inevitable disorder that follows when the 

king is but a child is commented on twice, in IHea.YX * 

4 . 1,192 and Rich.IIX * 2*3*11* 

The importance of the king in the state is 

emphasized in KJ* * 4.3*142 in a speech on the dead 

Arthur, most unfittingly placed in the mouth of John’s 

most ardent supporter, Paloonbridgej 

Row easy dost thou take all England upS 
From forth this morsel of dead royalty. 

The life, the right, and ti\ith of all this 
realm 

Is fled to heaven; and l^ngiand now is left 
To tug and scamble (etc). . . * . 

A corollary to this is the idea given to Rosencrantz 

that the king is bound more than a private individual 

to protect himself, because the welfare of the comrrion^ 

wealth is J)ound up in his; 

The single and peculiar life is bound 
«ith all the strength and armor of the mind

i^.osencrantz is probably flattering the king, but the 
length of the passage suggests it was an opinion 
Shakespeare wanted to develop beyond the strict necess¬ 
ities of the drama. The idea that the strong hand of 
the king is essential to keep the various factions and 
forces of disorder in check is behind IIJ♦ , ^. 7*25 and 
negatively in 1 1 Hen. IV . 4.5*13^

So also in Hich.IIX .. 2.2.127 where the ungovei’ned state 
is compared to a riderless horse. 

The importance of order and unity in the 
state is implicit in the imagery applied to it* 
Shakespeare’s favoi*ite image with regard to the state 
is that of the garden in which the weeds must be uprooted

s Jolxn Dover Wilson puts it in the 
lilssential Shahespeaire ; 

Social stability in the form of a hicsrarchy 
of rank or degree, crowned by the monarchy, was... 
the condition of Slizabethan political thought. 

In this system the monarch was all imijortant and 
the body politic hung suspended as it were from 
the trone as the universe itself hung from the 
floor of heaven. iSverything depended upon the 
person of the king* # 


# Op* cit. , p«92 

Herein lies the explanation of the problem in dch.XI . 
The king is unworthy to rule, he lacks the qualities 
of monarchy, but he is divinely appointed, the hordes 
anointed. In order to restore authority, Bolingbroke 
must assume control, but in doing so he commits a sin 
and brings God’s vengeance upon himself and his 
descendants. Hichard, as Wilson points out, becomes 
in the end "the sacrificial victim". # 

# Ibid. , p.93* 

There can be strength in the state only when you have 
a divine right monarch who is also capable of wielding 
authority, i.e. when you have a Tudor monarchy.

the poet in JG» ( t The citizen scenes 

Hich, ill* reveal the aaiae qualities of stupidity 
and fickleness. Bagot, in iUch.lI, remarks tiiat the 
love of the commons ’’lies in their purses ( 2 . 2 . 129 - 30 )" 
The theiiie continues in the Hen.1V> plays where the 
emphasis is still on the wavering, fickle nature of the 
commons, ( IHen.iy, , ^.1,7^, Zmn^lV. . i. 3 . 89 ). The des¬ 
cription of the crowd in SHen.IV, , Ind,l 8 s 

The blunt monster with uncounted heads, 

The still discordant wavering multitude..... 

is important since it is the only passage on the mob 

phich is a direct undraaiatic utterance of the poet 

himself and cannot be attributed to the aristocratic 

prejudices of the speaker of a role. The most vivid 

expression of the idea of change in the mob is that in 

AC. ; 

This common body 

Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream. 

Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide 
To rot itself with motion. (1.4.43) 

There is a further disparaging reference in 

the same play to the shallow judgment of 

the slippery people 

.Vhose love is never link’d to the deserver 
Till his desert is past. ( AC. .1.2.192,j 

which is similar to Hamlet’s comment on the mistaken 

sympathy of the mob for an offender being punished. 



















(Ham, ,4.3*4-) • In th e MV , ,2,9,26ff, the superficial n 

judgment of the diultitude which judges only by outward 
show is commented on,^ In ly;, there are two passages 


# The speaker is Arragon whose own judgment is not sound, 
but he is right here in rejecting the gold casket. 
Moreover, in condemning the "fool multitude" for choosing 
by outward show, he is touching on an idea common in 
Shakespeare, that outward appearance is deceptive. It 
is on this ground that Bassanio chooses the right casket 

(mv;,,3.2,73)* 


in which the superstition of the mob is oontempbbusly 
referred to (3*^*^53 4.2,143), 

Shakespeare’s disgust at the physical repulsiveness 
of the Elizabethan mob has been often remarked on. Miss 
Spurgeon uses his descriptions of the crowd in Cori ,, 
3 , 3,120 and 3 , 1*66 and in £G,,l,2,243»5l, as proof of 
Shakespeare’s sensitiveness to bad smells,^ Anyone who, 

^ Op , cit »t p 

as she convincingly shows, was as sensitive as Shakespeare 
on this point could scarcely have failed to have been 
revolted by the Elizabethan crowd. In A£,,5*2,209 
Cleopatra expresses her contempt for 

mechanic slaves, 

#/ith greasy aprons, rules and hammers,,,,, 

..in their thick brdaths 

Bank of gross diet, shall we be enclouded, 

And forced to drink their vapor,,,,,,.

the foul breath and greasy caps of the multitude^ are 
all in the mouths of Homan patricians* Tet the idea 
does not seem to derive from Plutarch so th^t it is only 
a conjecture whether Shakespeare meant it as typical of 
them only* 

CorioIeuQus* scorn of the mob is made one of the 
important factors in ttet play* and there are a large 
number of passages in which the Tsrious chairaoteristies

Corioianua* own intolerance, hia inability to unbend to 
the crowd, ia rejjarded aa a flaw in his character, taut 
the fact that he is wrong does not necessarily make 
them right• They are still wavering, fickle, easily 
led by the tribunes, still unfit to have power in their 
own hands. The important point in Gorioianus, which 
is repeated many times, is th‘:*t if you give power to 
the mob you foster rebellion and disorder. This is the 
point of the long and sententious fable of the belly 
and the members in l.l,101ff. In Gorioianus 

says: 


In soothing them {the commons) we nourish 
♦gainst our senate 

The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sediticn, 

\fhich ¥je ourselves have jjlough’d for, sow’d 
and scattered, 

By mingling them with us, the honored member; 
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that 
aich they have given to beggars. 


and repeats later: 

You grave but reckless senators, have you thus 
Given Hydra here to choose an officer. 

That with his peremptory ^shall’, being but 
The horn and noise of the monster, wants nfet 
spirit 

To say he* 11 turn your current in a ditch, 

And make your channel his?...,,.,,,,

Insult without reason; where gentry, title,

Cannot conclude, but by the yea and no 
Ot general ignorance,-it must omit 
Heal neceBsities, and give way the while 
To unstable slightness: (3.1.i41ff,) 

Here, as with kingship, the problem is the evil of 

placing power in the hands of a person oi* class unfit 

to riAle, and the dividing of authority in the state. 


Sanctit:/ of 


Almost as important as order in Shakespeare’s 
state is the sanctity of the law* As early ao the 
find the duke declaring to the unfortunate 

,4 eg eon: 

I am not partial to infringe our laws 

{ 1 . 1 * 4 ) 

and later; 


were it not against our laws 
li^hich princes, would they, may not disannul 
soul should sue as advocate for thee* 

(1,1.141) 

Theseus in the Md* , (I.I.II 7 ) and Duke Frederick in 
4Yj^. ( 1 , 3 , 88 ) are of the same opinion. In HJ , the 
prince does so far let mercy interfere as to commute 
Homeo’s sentence from death to banishment but realizes 
he lias been too lenient in allowing the quarrels of 













38 


IiLontagues and Capulets to go unpunished: 

And I for winking at your discords too 
Have lost a brace of kinsmen; all are 
punished. (5»3»294) 

Hen.V ♦ we have the soene in which the chief Justice 

defends himself for having punished Hal. Here the law 

is placed above the king himself (5*2.73ff.). In 

Hen^t 2 . 2.175 Henry refers the stern punishment of the 

traitors to the necessity of upholding the country’s 

laws and not to personal revenge on his part. Julius 

Caesar refuses the plea of Cimber for his banished 

brother on the ground that he cannot 

turn pre-ordinance and first decree 
Into the law of children. ( JG. « 3*^*3S) 

where the plot turns upon the question of 

mercy against Justice, we have a fuller development of 

the problem. In 3*3*26 Antonio says 

The Duke cannot deny the course of law; 

For the commodity that strangers have 
With us in Venice, if it be .denied. 

Will much impeach the justice of his state. 

Bassanio pleads that the law be set aside but Portia 

demurs s 

It must not be; there is no power in Venice 
Can alter a decree established: 

♦Twill be recorded as a precedent, 

And many an error by the same excuse 
Will rush into the state; it cannot be, 

(2.i,2l8ff.) 

and the point of law is upheld in the denouement.

m. , where the plot again turns on this point of oi«roy 
VS. justice, contains a very similar discussion. The 
necessary impartiality of authority is remarked on in 
1.2.129ff* and 2.2.80ff. One of the main points of the 
play is that the leniency of the Duke in setting aside 
the law has led to grave abuses (1.3*i9*3^)* deputy 

Angelo says 8 

We must not make a scarecrow of the law. 

Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, 

And let it keep one shape, till custom make it 
Their perch and not their terror. (2.1.Iff) 

There is a strong similarity in the two scenes in MV« 

and where Portia and Isabella plead for mercy against 

justice. For instance, Portia’s argument that mercy is 

an attribute especially becoming to greatnesss 

*Tis mightiest in the mightiests it becomes 
The throned monarch better than his crown| 

His sceptre shows the force of temporal pow© , 
The attribute to awe and majesty, 

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; 
Bit mercy is above this sceptred sway; 

It is enthroned in the hearts of kings. 

(4.1.188) 

is echoed by Isabellas 

No ceremony that to great ones longs 

Not the king’s crown nor the deputed sword. 

The marshal’s truncheon nor the judge’s robes 
Become them with one half so good a grace 
As mercy does... (2.2.59) 

In the list of ’king-becoming graces’ in Macb. . 4.3.9lff. 

one is mercy, ’’No word like ’pardon’ for kings’ mouths 

so meet** says the old Duchess of York in Rich.lL . 5.3,118. 















40 


Brutus, in JC« voices the idea somewhat differently! 

The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins 
Remorse from power* {2*1*18) ' 

Portia continues her argument with an 

appeal to mercy as the specifically Christian virtue* 

It is an attribute to God himself; 

And earthly power does then show likest God’s 
//hen mercy seasons justice *••••••*•• 

**•*•*In the course of justice, none of us 
Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy; 
And that same prayer doth teach us all to 
render 

The deeds of mercy*••••*.{4.1*195ff) 

Again the echo-in MM* : 

Why all the souls that were, were forfeit 
once; 

And He that might the vantage best have took 
Found out the remedy# How would you be. 

If He, which is the top of judgment, should 
Judge you as you are? -0 think on that; 

And mercy then will breathe within your lips, 
Like man new made**#*# {2#2*73f^*) 

Shakespeare was evidently attracted by the dramatic 

effect of such an appeal and also by the idea of a 

character like Shylock who having refused to grant mercy, 

is brought to the point of having to beg for it and be 

refused, for he repeats it in Hen.V^ , 2*1.40ff. in the 

scene with the traitors. ^ 

But all these pleas for mercy against the 

rigorous application of the law do not necessarily 

cancel Shakespeare’s attitude to the sanctity of law* 

In MV* Portia pleads not to the Duke, but to Shylock 









41 


personally, to show mercy, and she herself upholds 

the latter of the law* * presents a more difficult 

question, for, though Angelo counters all Isabella*s 

arguments, yet Claudio in the end is imrdoned, but only 

on the revelation that the agent of justice is more 

corrupt than he, an important point as we shall see# 

Besides, the appeals to mercy are offset by such 

passages as RJ* * 1*202; 

Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. 

and Rich.II. . 5 . 3 . 83 s 

If you pardon, whosoever pray, 

More sins for this forgiveness prosper may***. 

and in MM* itself the same idea is upheld by jSsoalus 

{ 2 . 1 * 306 ) and Angelo (2*2.100)# The senator in T.Ath* . 

3*5*3* says; 

nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy. 

.Act 3 scene 5 of T.Ath* was apparently deliberately 

contrived largely to air these ideas on mercy and 

justice, for in it Alcibiades pleads to the senate for 

mercy, urging, as did Portia and Isabella, that 

Pity is the virtue of the law 

And none but tyrants use it cruelly (3*>8.# 

yet here too the law is upheld* Alcibiades* point had 

been used by Isabellas 

It is excellent 

To have a giant’s strength, but it is 
tyrannous 

To use it like a giantl (MM., 2.2*107) 
















42. 


Too much leniency is bad, but so is the abuse of 
power in cruelty. 

One must conclude then that Shakespeare 
was concerned about the problem of law and justice 
and probably regarded mercy as a desirable attribute 
of power, but at the same time felt that the law must 

be sacred or authority and order would be destroyed 

# 

and corruption become inevitable. 

# It is noteworthy that the only person in Shakespeare 
who speaks disrespectfully of the law is the all- 
licensed Falstaff and that is strictly in character. 
IHen.lV. . 1.2*68. 

Throwing light on the problem in BM. there 
is a group of references to the corruption of 
authority. The first indication of the theme comes 
in the MV, where Aragon, who is characterized, it is 
true, as rather sententious and proud of his intellect, 
having already made his decision on the caskets, 
launches into a long tirade complaining that office 
is not the reward of merit and that if it were, many 
now in authority would lose their places, - which 
reminds us of Hamlet’s ”the insolence of office” and 
»the scorns that patient merit of the xinworthy takes”. 
Compare Sonnet 66 

Tir’d with all eheae, for restful death I cry 
AS to behold deseit a beggar born,.,..

idea that justice is the slave of gold, first in Eatm. ; 

By the corrupted currents of this world 
Offence*s gilded hand may shove by justice, 
And oft *ti8 seen the wicked prize itself

Then in Lear’s ravings:

appear! 

obes and furr’d gowns hide all. plate 
sin with gold, 

And the strong lance of justice hurtless 
breaks. 

Arm it in rags,” a pigmy’s straw'doe® 
pierce it. (KL. . 4 . 6 . 166 ) 

The furr’d gown appears again in IM .: 

’Twas never merry world since, of two 
usuries, the merriest was put down, and 
the worser allow’d by order of law and furr’d 
gown to keep him warm, and furr’d with fox 
and lamb-skins, too^to signify, that craft, 
being richer than innocency, stands for the 
facing. (3.2.6ff.) 

This passage also anticipates Lean ’’The usurer hangs 

the cozener (4.6.167 .).” # 


# Lawyers’ f^eea v/ere paid in gowns, hence the furred 
gown is a symbol of the corruption of the law* 














44 , 

Isabella too comments on the fact that what is a mere 

peccadillo in the great is a crime in the less , 

2,2.126). The idea that gold will buy out the law 

recurs in ^.,4.4,831 and Cym ,, 2, 3«71» 

Isabella tells Angelo to look in his own heart 

for the sins of her brother; if he finds them there 

he cannot condemn ,2.2.134ff♦)« This idea, that 

authority to be effective must itself be blameless, 

reappears in im,,2*l#85 3*2*266ff, and 4.2,79^'f* sind 

even occurs in the mouth of Angelo (2»2*176)* In 

the same passage where we have the condemnation of 

corrupt Justice in IHu*, hear lashes outs 

Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody handI 
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine 
own back; 

Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind 
For which thou whipst her* The usurer 
ha,ngs the cosener# (KL*,4t6* 

That is, Justice, the lew, for Siiakespeare is sacred 

and, if there is to be any order in the state it must 

be upheld inviolable,but when the state itself becomes 

corrupt there can no longer be any Justice, for the 

law cannot condemn the offender if its own hands are . 

not clean* The position here is similar to that in 

the family when the father uses his authority 

tyrannically* Syuipathy goes to the offender when the 

lav/ is administered cruelly or partially. It is to 

be noted that it is chiefly in the early plays that 













45 . 

we find reference to the sanctity of law and in the 
later plays to its corruption. This awareness of 
corruption in authority is a part of that general 
deepening sense of the evil in the world the causes 
of which we shall discuss later. 

and Domestic Discord 
and 

Disturbance in ITatu^re 

Any disturbance in the state is invariably 
acoofftpanied in Diiakespeare by a disturbance in nature. 

In the early history plays comets appear ** imp or ting

or the **heaven itself doth frown upon the land

taken to bode the breaking of the peace between 
England and France (1.1.89}. The awe and l^sy 
conjecture aroused in the people by the appearance of 
such comets, meteors, or other portents ©sems to have 
made a great impression on Shakespeare. It comes into 
mere passing references in IKen»XV »» 3»2»42 and SI*.3.2.93

openl^^ bars of the storm music which reaches its 
climax in Lear and echoes through the later plays. 

A more usual sort of disturbance for the period of 
the history plays occurs in 2Hen.IV ..4.4.121 where the 
prodigies are ^unfathered heirs and loathly births of 
nature*', confusion of the seasons, floods etc. similar 
to the troubles resulting from the discord in tne lairy 
kingdom and in the domestic life of fitania and Oberon 
in 2.1.81. 

The storm, the tempest dropping fire, the slave 
with flaming hand, the lions, ghastly women, men all on 
lire etc. that so frighten Oasca^; and Calpurnia’s 
dreams and omens, in are all derived from Plutarch.# 

# Shakespeare*s Plutarch , ed. C.F.T.Brooke (London, 

Oxford University press, 1909), vol.I,p.95-6. 

In the other Roman plays there are fewer actual prodigies, 
but the idea of portents accompanying great events im 
used figuratively in AC., (3*^3»i53) stnd there is an echo 
cf ^ in the same play in the detail of lions in the 
streets (5»1*14). Caesar comments on the death of 
/Antony that. 

The breaicing of so great a thing should make 
A greater crack. (AC ..^.1.14) 

This feeling that the fall of a great man should of

neceasity be accompanied by a great event in nature, 
an eclipse of earthquake, had appeared in Oth >.^.2 .mq 
and in Calpurnia's assertion that: 

When beggars die, there are no comets seen, 

The heavens themselves blaze forth the death 
of princes JC.,2.2.30) 

In Ham , the appearance of the ghost is taken bo 
bode ’’some strange eruption in the state (1.1.69)jl 
The murder of Duncan in Macb. is followed by abnormal¬ 
ities in natures 

Lamentings heard in the ^iri strange screams 
of death 

And prophesying with accents terrible 

Of dire combustion and confused events 

Hew hatch’d to the woeful time. The obscure 
bird 

Clamor’d the livelong night etc. (2*3»6lff.) 
The earth shakes as with fever and next day the sun is 
dark, apparently because of an eclipse, and unnatural 
happenings like the killing of a falcon by an owl and 
the horses eating each other, still further add to the 
sense of upheaval in nature accompanying the breaking 
of order in the state. 

The view that such portents have meaning does not, 
however, go unquestioned by the realists. Pandulph in 
KJ . tells with some contempt how the coimnon people will 
interpret every meteor, every stormy day as a sign of 
the fall of John (3.4.153). In IHen.XV .. 


when Grlendower boasts that comets appeared at his birth 













^ 9 . 

and the earth shook, Hotspur replies disdainfully that 
it would have done so had the oat kittened and offers a 
natural explanation of the earthquake (3*l«25ff*}* In 
JC* Casca maintains that 


vVhen these prodigies 
Do so conjointly meet, let no men say 
•These are their reasonB, they are natural, 

For I believe that they are portentous things 
Unto the climate that they point upon. 

(1.3.27ff.) 

but Cicero is more sceptical and thinks they may be 

misinterpreted. Yet Cassius agrees with Casca and no 

one actually denies the point. The scene here is 

recalled by Horatio in Ham .. (1.1.113ff.) who adds that 

similar portents in Denmark presage similar civil 

discord. Finally to weigh against the sceptics we have 

old Lafeu in 2 . 3 . 1.8 

They say miracles are past 5 and we have our 
philosophical persons, to make modem and 
familiar, things supernatural and causeless. 
Hence is it that we make trifles of terrors 
ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge 
when we should submit ourselves to an unknown 
fear. 

The balance of evidence is strongly on the side of belief. 
But the important point is not whether these opinions 
are dramatic or whether Shakespeare actually believed 
in portents, but that he uses them dramatically always 
in connection with discord in the state and that he 
conceives of civil disorder in terms of disturbance in 


nature 

















50 


In the connection ia extended to domestic 
discord as well as political* It will be recalled that 
as early as OS.,2.1*15# the rdlation of husband and 
wife was compared to order in nature. In Lear Gloucester 
connects the recent portents with unnatural domestic 
quarrels; 

These late eclipses in the sun and moon 
portend no good to us* Though the wisdom 
of nature can reason it thus and thus, yet 
nature finds itself scourged by the sequent 
effects; love cools, friendship falls off, 
brothers divide; in cities, mutinies; in 
countries, discord; in palaces treason; and 
the band cracked •twixt son and father.«•• 

( 1 * 2 . 112 ) 

and though this is ridiculed by Edmund it is with regard 
to the influence of the planets on the individual human 
will rather than in regard to the state* He also repeats 
the idea (155^*^**)^ insincerely it is true, but the events 
of the play bear out Gloucester’s predictions* 

Throughout the play the discord in domestic affairs 
and in the state is imaginatively linked with the stora. 
In Cori * also, the reversal of family relations when 
Volumnia kneels to her son draws comparison with the 
tfemi^tthat so often in Shakespeare symbolizes upsetting 
of the social or political orders 

What’s this? 

Your knees to mel to your corrected son! 

Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach 
Fillip the stars, then let the mutinous winds 
Strike the proud cedars ’gainst the fiery sun, 
Murd’ring impossibility, to make 
hat cannot be, slight work. ( Cori *. 5*3*56) 









51 . 

vhether there was a particular storm, as seems 
likely, that haunted Shakespeare’s memory or whether 
the details so similar in his descriptions are parts 
of an imaginative whole brought together in the terrible 
symbolism of Lear and echoed like reverberated thunder 
in later plays, one cannot be certain, but the connection 
between these various storm descriptions is too striking 
to be accidental. To note a small point, the ’hurricane’ 
mentioned by Lear (3.2.2) had appeared in TC..5«2.l68> 
Lightning is usually described as sulphurous and swift 
and strikes oaks; 

Merciful Heaven 

Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous 
bolt 

Splitt’st the unwedgeabl© and gnarled oak 

Than the soft myrtle. ( MM. ^2»2. 

I have seen tempests when the scolding winds 

Have rived the knotty oaks. (£C.,1.3.5.) 

You sulphurous and tbought*executing fires 

Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts. 

Jove’s lightnings, the precursors 

0’ the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary 

And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and 
cracks 

Of sulphurous roaring etc...( Temp. .1.2.201) 
Other examples occur in the Temp .»^»1»44 and in Cori« . 
5*3*151. Jompare also TG. »1»3.49* Wind and sea are at 
war, the sea threatening to drown the earth and the 
wind to blow it into the sea, or raise the sea to 
meet the skies* As early as T.And* .3*1*221 we have 
















52 . 


the comparison of the disturbed sea to madness 
(cf. Lear )and the winds stirring the sea to threaten 
the skies but these details are not yet related to 
the idea of discord in the state. The same images 
recur in Ham .,4.1.7*l JG. .1>5-8.; 0th ..2.1#1^17; 

KL. .4.4.2 and in the passages already cited from 
2Hen.IV. .1.1.15^ and cerl. .5.^.56. We find them 
again in the unforgettable picture of the old white- 
haired king who, 

Contending with the fretful elements, 

Bids the wind blo’w the earth into the sera. 
Or swell the curled waters ’bove the main. 
That things might change or cease* 

(KL..^#l#4ff.} 

and in 3»7*59 sea is thought of as rising tc© 
quench the stars, a conception which is echoed in 
the Temp. .l.2#.3ff# where the sea puts out the fires 
of the stom. The mingling of sea and sky is vividly 
described in WT» .3»3#84ff, One of the most striking 
and at the same time most compressed expressions of 
the strife of sea and sky is Prosperous 

♦twixt the green sea and the 
azured vault 

Set roaring war. { Temp» .5#1*42) 

Although it does not appear in Lear , nor is it 
exactly part of the storm imagery we have been 
discussing, it Is convenient here to compare the 
references to an earthquake. The note in the 
Variorum edition of RJ. suggests that in the nurse’s

reminiscences we may have recollection of an actual 

earthquake which occurred in 1580, However this may 

he, in XHen^IV. ,3,1,31, Hotspur, gives the accepted 

explanation of an earthquake as a distemperature of 

nDther earth in these terms* 

Diseased nature often times breaks forth 
In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth 
Is with a kind of colic pinch’d and vex’d 
within her womb which, for enlargement 
striving, 

Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down 
Steeples and moss-grown towers# 

In Macb# this becomes ’’the earth was fsvrous and did 

shake (2#3*66)**. This line is echoed almost identically 

in Cori. ,1.4»6 q. The detail of the steeples and towers 

toppling down recurs in Macb# .4»l»50*^6o. in a passage 

when Macbeth speaks wildly to the witches* 

I conjure you, by that which you profess, 
Howe’er you come to know it, answer mes 
Though you untie the winds and let them fight 
Against the churches; though the yesty waves 
Confound and swallow navigation up; 

Though bladed corn be lodged aiid trees blown 
down I # 


# The lodging of summer’s com had appeared before in 
passing references* (Rich# !!#.3»3*l62; 2Hen#YI# .I#2.r76). 
as a result of especiaiSy bad ?/eather or figuratively, 
of sighs and tears compared to wind and rain* 


Though castles topple on their wardens’ heads, 
Though palaces and pyramids do slope 
Their heads to their foundations, though the 
treasure 

Of nature’s germens tumble all together,

Macbeth would dare even such profound upheaval in

nature to know whether his ambition is to be granted. 

The lines about untying the winds to fight against the 
churches are reminiscent of Lear commanding the winds 
to blow up the seas, •♦till you have drench’d our 
steeples, drown’d the cocks", and this is significant 
when we note that a few lines further in Lear we Have* 

And thou, all-»shaking thunder 
Smite flat the thick rotundity o’ the worldi 
Crack nature’s moulds, all germens spill at 
once. 

That make ingrateful manl (KL,,3*2,6-9) 
There is only one other reference in Shakespeare besides 
this, and that quoted from Macb, > to nature’s germens^ 
and that occurs in reference to discord between father 
and son in the WT > where Perdita says she knew her 
dignity would last only until the secret were known, 
and Florizel repliess 

It cannot fail but by 
The violation of my faith, and then 
Let nature crush the sides ©* the earth 

together 

And mar the seeds withinl {4.4,490) 

The late plays often echo in a comparatively trivial 
situation such as this some important idea of the great 
tragedies, but it grates a little to compare the love 
of Florizel and Perdita to the drama in Lear and Macb , 
There had been a hint of this conception of the 
final dissolution of all things, expressed in imagery 
of the sea drowning the earth in 2Hen.IV ,,3*1*45«

All that remains of the former pictures is the central 
idea and the towers and temples which are associated with 
the dissolution. This detail of the towers may be 
suggested by Elizabethan poems on Time, The motif of 
time which wears all to naught is a conventional 
Elizabethan one in conjunction with which such pictures 
frequently appear, and when Shakespeare thinks of the 
end of time he associates it with towers and temples 
crumbling and toppling in the general chaos, 

'#hat is important, however, is that all these 
details, storm, earthquake etc,, are part of a general

Helatlon of the Ideas on the State 
and J*ami ly 
to 

Ulysses * Speech on * Degree ^ 

The two conceptions which have been building up 
in this chapter; that of a state ordered, unified, its 
various elements, potentially discordant, held in 
harmonious accord, one belo?/ the other, by the strong 
controlling hand of authority, its laws sacred and 
impartial; and the conception of the family ruled by 
the father, its members in submission to him by a 
natural bond of duty and love;- are, as we have seen, 
interrelated and bound up in a half mystic way withthe 
order in nature. It is easy to see the reason for this 
connection. J,Dover Wilson*s description of the 
Slizabethan universe could be a description of

Shakespeare's states

It only held together by keeping balance, 
harmony and an ordered hierarchy of degrees, 
corresponding with the angelic ranks about 
the Deity or the galaxy of nobles at an 
earthly court, # 


# Op. cit., p.l6. 


Wilson remarks also in the same context that the fear 
of the return of chaos haunted men's minds, so that it 
is not surprising that the idea of disorder in the state 
should be associated in Shakespeare's mind with the 
unhinging of the universe and reversion to chaos. 

Is it possible to draw all these apparently related 

ideas and their associated imagery into a coherent whole 

which we may call a philosophy? The answer is simply 

that Shakespeare himself has done just that in the 

famous speech of Ulysses on 'degree*; 

The specialty of rule hath been neglecteds 
When the general is not like the hive, 

To whom the foragers shall all repair, 
rfhat honey is expected? Degree being vizarded , 
The unworthieSt shows as fairly in the mask. 
The heavens themselves, the planets, and 
this centre, 

Observe degree, priority, and place, 

Insisture, course, proportion, season, form, 
Office, and custom, in all line of orders 
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol 
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered 
Amidst the other; whose med'cinable eye 
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil, 

And posts, like the commandment of a king, 

Sans check, to good and bads but when the 
planets, 

In evil mixture, to disorder wander,

itself, all symlDolized and comprehended in the storm. 

The parallels in the description of the storm have been 

discussed, but they are only part of the general 

relationship. Lear resigns his authority in the state 

into unworthy hands, dividing the control between his 

two daughters, yet seeks to retain the show of royalty. 

Thus, in the initial situation, we have the failure of 

authority, ”the specialty of ru.le", on which all order 

and degree depends. At the same time, and involved in 

Lear*s resignation of authority, comes his unnatural 

act toward his daughter Cordelia* ^‘The king falls 
‘the 

from^bias of nature, there’s father against child 
tKL» ,1.2.119)” and Cordelia, in defying her father also 
sins against the law of domestic order. Thus the two 
themes of civil and domestic discord run parallel 
throughout the play. The results of this initial 
action are precisely those given in Ulysses* speech 
as the consequences of the overturning of ♦degree’. 

The ’prerogative of age’ is thrust aside, the child 
lifts its hand against the father* Hot only is this 
true in the case of Goneril and Hegajni but in the sub¬ 
plot, "Brothers divide", and i^dmund, while making it 
appear that Bdgar is the unnatural son, himself plots 
to get control of his father’s land. The theme of 
fathers and children being reinforced by the sub-plot, 
makes it stand out more strongly as the main theme.

but we never lose sight of what is happening in the 
state. Albany and Cornwall, Coneril and Regan are soon 
seen to be poor yoke-mates, and as early as 2.1. discord 
between the dukes is hinted at. There is general 
confusion in the absence of a central power. 

Shakesoeare confines the dramatic action chiefly to the 
domestic issue, but in Lear’s mad ravings, the picture 
of universal moral depravity and unbridled sensualltyi 
the tirade on corrupt ,1ustice, expressed as it is by a 
mind disordered and unstrung is significantly like the 
conception of Ulysses of the state without degree. 

Hardin Craig has a note on this passage (4*6.l6l-»171) 
as follows: 

Into these ravings should be read the 
conception of a state resting upon 
authority solely, and this state fallen 
into ruin because the holders of this 
divinely constituted authority are 
themselves corrupt. # 

# Hardin Craig, p.886. 


Lear’s terrible vision of the unbridled forces of 

nature drowning the world and destroying even ’nature’s 

germens’ and Albginy’s words: 

If that the heavens do not their visible 
spirits 

Send quickly down to tame these vile offences, 
It will come, 

Humanity jsaust perforce prey on itself, 

Like monsters of the deep, (KL ..4.2.46ff.)

of such a world, again as Ulysses had described it 


62 


KL. is not the only play which contains parallels 
to Ulysses* speech. The storm, the failure of order, 
and the self-annihilation of humanity had appeared in 
the lines quoted from 2Hen,IV, ,1»1,15^, There is the 
passage already cited from Hen»V , where it is forecast 
that Henry will remove ”the mujszle of restraint** from 
"curb’d license** and the country will revert to a 
wilderness peopled by wolves • Perhaps it 

would not be stretching the point too far to say that 
the corruption of justice and the preoccupation with 
sexual license in is part of the expression of this 
idea of the corruption of the state without a central 
authority^ In 1#3*29 the Duke explains that the laws 


# 0,J,Campbell, Comical Satire and Shakespeare’s

says Mli,, ?/hich was ‘‘probably written shortly after 
Troilus and Cressida, displays Vienna in a condition 
of political and moral disintegration! because the 
Duke has weakly refused to perform his essential duty 
to enforce the laws of his state#** p, 196 * 


have been allowed to fall into disregard; 

And liberty plucks justice by the nosej 
The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart 
Goes all decorum. 

The curse of Timon upon Athens seems also to be related 
to Ulysses’ speech. Here the order is reversed* The 
effects of the failure of ’degree’ are placed first and 
the curse is summed up in the last three lines; 




















63 . 


0 thou wall, 

That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the 
earth, 

And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn 
incontinent, 

Obedience fail in children ! Slaves and fcDols, 
pluck the grave and wrinkied senate from the 
bench, 

And minister in their steads! To general 
filths 

Convert, o’the instant, green virginity...*.* 

.Bound servants, steal! 
Large handed robbers your grave masters are, 

And pill by law..... 

....Son of siJi^teen, 

Pluck the lined crutch from the old limping 
sire. 

With it beat out his brains! Piety and fear, 
Religion to the gods, peace, justice, trutl^ 
Domestic awe, ***•••.*•..*.• 

Degrees , observances, customs , and laws . 
Decline to your confounding contraries, 

And let confusion live, ( T.4th ,,4.1.1.) 


Again in Timon , in reference to gold we find, 

0 thou touch of hearts! 

Think, thy slave man rebelsj and by thy virtue 
Set them into confounding odds, that beasts 
May have the world in empire.,,. (4,3«39^*)

2, Animal Imagery, 

It is a tempting conjecture whether the final 

stage of disorder when 

appetite, an universal Wolf, 

So doubly seconded with will and power, 

Must make perforce an universal prey, 

And last eat up himself* 

is related to the passages in Lear and Timon and also 
in Kam, and 0th , where man is compared to the animals.

beast appears first in Antony’s exclamation 

0 JudgmentI thou art fled to brutish beasts 
4nd men have lost their reason, (JC,,3*2,109*10) 

though the idea is touched on in MAAH *,5,1,208, It 

occurs again in Ham, 

. ...Judgment 

'Vithout the which we are pictures, or mere 
beasts, 

Lear on seeing the mad and naked Edgar cries^ 

**unaccomodated man is no more but such a poor, bare 

forkt animal as thou art ( KL, , 3*^«12)**, Lear’s 

Allow not nature more than nature needs 
Man’s life’s as cheap bb beasts .,» ( KL, ^ 2,4,269) 

is an echo of Ham * 

What is a man 

If the chief good and market of his time 
Be but to sleep and feed? a beasts no more, 

(^.3.33.) 

and in 


0 Godl a beast, that wants discourse of 
reason 

Would have mourn’d longer( Ham* >1,2,15Q) 

we have a further comparison of man and the beasts. 

In 0th , there are several OGsnparisons to apes, goats 

and monkeys (1,3,318, 3*3*^03, 4,1,274, 3,3,180), - 

and in Timon, there is the scathing comments 

The strain of man’s bred out into baboon 
and monkey, ( 1 , 1 , 251 ) 

All this would be very inconclusive were it not that 
we know from many references ( AYLX ,, 3 , 2 , 187 , TI,,4,2,55ff, 
Ham ,,5,l*^24ff,, AC,,2,7*5Q) that Shakespeare had long 















65 


been interested in the doctrine of Pythagoras on the 
transmit!: rat ion of souls. As early as the occurs 

this passage; 

0 be thou damn’d, inexecrable dogl 
And for thy life let justice be accused 
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith 
To hold opinion with Pythagoras, 

That souls of animals infuse themselves 
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit 
aovern’d a wolf, who, hang’d for human 
slaughter, 

Sven fi'om the fallows did his fell soul fleet, 
And, whilst thou lays’t in thy unhallowed dam, 
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires 
Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous* # 

(4^*128) 


# The comparison of Shylock to a wolf was doubtless 
suggested by the name of a certain Dr* Lopez whose recent 
execution for an alleged attempt to poison the queen had 
raised strong anii-Semitic feeling and may have had 
something to dp with the occasion of this play* 

See Hardin Craig, p*292. 


By a somewhat different track A*C*3radley connectts 
this interest in Pythagoras, and particularly the quoted 
passage with the anitiml imagery in KL* and T*Ath ** and 
sees in both plays"the idea that this bestial degradation 
will end in a furious struggle of all with all, in which 
the race will perish*" Regarding Lear , he remarks 
"those incessant references to ^olf and tiger made us 
see humanity ’reeling back into the beast’ and ravening 
against itself". He gives examples of the use of aniurnl 
comparisons in Lear * 

As we read, the souls of all the beasts in 
turn seem to us to have entered the bodies of 
these mortals; horrible in their venom.

Then he quotes the passage from Lear on humanity preying 
on itself, and compares it in a footnote with the speech 
of Ulysses. # 


# Shakespearean Tragedy (London, 193^) p.246-270). 


Bradley’s speculation strongly reinforces not only the 
probability that these constant comparisons of men to 
the beasts, are related to the idea of an ultimate 
reign of appetite and bestiality which will destroy 
itself but also the theory that in Lear especially we 
have brought together into a tremendous imaginative 
whole, this vision of a world unstrung. #

3. HeXation of Shakespeare*s political 1 hilosophy 

'his'"' t Imes' " "". 

Kuch has been sritten about the mood of gloom 
and disillusionment in the tragedies and later plays 
of Shakespeare. Certainly more attention is given 
in direct statement to the general corruption of the 
world in these plays than previously* The first 
strong expressions of the sense of something rotten 
in society begin with AYLI♦' which dates from l 598 «' 6 o$’# 


# The remarks of Pistol and falstaff in such passages 
a-s IHen. IV * >2*4,14 2Hen.IV ,, 1.2,191 and Hen,V .>2,3,^^ 

ma.y be discounted as drasiatic. 


Others had expressed dissatisfaction with the ills of 
life, but there is no consistent recurrence of the idea 
of general corruption until Jaques in AJLl , who wants 
to 

Cleanse the foul body of the infected 
world., ( 2 , 7 . 60 ) 

The sense of prevailing rottenness is far stronger in 
Ham# ,# The world is compared to 


# Miss Spurgeon points out the sickness images, and 
the feeling of horror, disgust and even helplessness, 
which are strong in Ham, and not before e'^*:cept in AtLi, , 
She calls it a ^general sense of inward and unseen 
corruption 0|j, ait,, p, 133 * 


an unweeded garden. 

That grows to seed; things rank and gross in 
nature

some personal disillusionment or by the disappointment

cynical bitterness and grim realism which 
delights in a certain violence and even 
distortion of speech, and figure, and 
sometimes of incident*

led him to ponder much on a certain range of 
thought - the arjiazing contradictions in man, 
the strange and often horrible transmutations 
of physical matter, the meaning and nature 
of death, and what possibly may constitute 
the chief value in lifei while, going along 
with these reflections, there is ample 
evidence of a shocked, disillusioned and 
suffering spirit, taking refuge in mocks and 
jeers and bitterness*

liias Spurgeon talks of the ’raajesty and squalor* of 
IM « whereas Chambers refuses to see the ’squalor* and 
points to the *mej,esty*, araplifying hia idea that it 
is a play of idealized forgiveness, in order to refute 
the charge of disillusioniuent. But granted that there 
is at least a deepening awareness of evil in the plays 
around the turn of the century, need we assume that 
Sliakespeare is writing himself out of ari unhappy love 
affair or a political fiasco? Were Bonne and Webster, 
Marston, Hall, and Johson all suffering from the same 
soul-shattering experience? It is natural that 
Shakespeare’s maturity should bring with it a more 
sombre note but there is another possible explanation, 
one which accounts for the other dramatists and authors 
of the time and also placates the sceptics who maintain 
that Shakespeare was merely giving the public what it 
wanted* 

ihe concept of the state had, from the time of 
Gorboduc and the first chronicle plays, been fundamental 
in Elizabethan drama* Under Elizabeth England had been 
the state Shakespeare pictures* The long civil wars 
were over, and, for the time at least, the strong Tudor 
monarchy had enforced law and order and held taut the 
string of degree, keeping firiaily in hand the various 

forces of nobles, mob and rising commercial interests.

CHAPTER II 

SHAKESPEARE'S MORAL SYSTEM 
A* Permanent Ideas . 

Taming from Shakespeare's views on institutions 

like family and state, to his ideas on moral problems, 

we find the fundamental principles much the same* He 

believes as firmly in order in the kingdom of man's 

mind as in the state* Indded, he conceil&es of the mind 

as a little kingdom* Mental conflict is thought of in 

terms of civil wan 

Hay in the body of this fleshly land 

This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath 

Hostility and civil tumult reigns 

Between my conscience and my cousin's death, 

(KJi,4*2,255) 

Brutus, describing the nightmare of indecision, sayst 

The Genius and the mortal instruments 
Are then in council; and the state of man, 

Like to a little kingdom, suffers then 
The nature of an insurrection. 

(JO..2.1,66) 

Ulysses uses the same metaphor with regard to Achilles, 

( TC* , 2*3*184 ). and there is a passing reference to the 

# 

idea of man as a microcosm in KL, ,3*1*10* (For other

resemblances of Shakespeare’s thinking on mind and state 
see 6hapter jiL, Just as Shakespeare believes in a 

strong controlling force in the state, so one of the 
great principles we may safely attribute to him with 
regard to morals, is that of moderation and self-control, 

Self - Control , 

Excess of all kind brings satietys

They are as sick that surfeit with too much 
as they that starve with nothing* It is no 
mean happiness to be settled in the mean; 
superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but 
competency lives longer, (MV*,1,2,?,)

These many references to the idea of surfeit not 
only show, as Kiss Spurgeon concludes, that Shakespeare 
regarded sickness^frequently due to excess, hut are

usually linked to the idea of lack of control either in 

# 

the individual or, as often happens, in the state*

Friar Laurence in H,J * warns the lovers of the dangers 
of too violent passloni 

the sweetest honey 

Is loathsome in his own deliciousness. 

And in the taste confounds the appetite: 
Therefore love moderately; long love doth so; 
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow* 

( 2 * 5 * 11 ) 

Written about the same time# Rich*II »* has a very 
similar passage in the mouth of Gaunt, where similes are 
piled up to illustrate the thought that violence hums 
itself out, one of which is that of choking from too 
eager feeding ( Rich*II »*2,1*371» Just as Friar Laurence 
remarks: 

These violent delights have violent ends 
And in their triumph die,,,*(RJ*,2,5.9^10) 

so Gaunt insists: 

Violent fires soon hum out themselves, 

( Rich.II ..2.1.^7)

We may then suppose that Shakespeare would agree with 
the Duke of Norfolk in Hen♦V1II >,1«1«124: 

Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance 
only 

/rfhich your disease requires, 

Shakespeare's belief in the golden mean of conduct 
is Illustrated by his attituda . toward asceticism which 
he consistently condemns as unnatural^ in the words of 
Berowne in LLL, ,4,3«215> of Theseus, (MHD, ,l,l,63ff,J of 
Titania 3.1.202) and Of Borneo in RJ,,2,2,7. In 

AYLI ,, Celia talks of *»a nun of winter' s sisterhood" 
and "the ice of chastity" (3,4,l6) and Hosalind tells 
of a lover whom madness drove to seek the monastic life 
{3*2.438)• The thought, familiar in the first seventeen 
sonnets, that chastity is a waste of beauty, appears 
also in TN.,1.5.257* as it had in MND ,,1,1.85*6, and 
RJ,,l,l,221ff♦ There is doubtless some serious backing 
to the Falstaffian reasoning of Parolles on virginity 
in AW., 1.1,136. The only exception to this general 
condemnation of austerity occurs in M,, 1.4.34,, where 
Lucio the sensualist calls Isabella a "thing enskyed 
and sainted" because she is to be a nun, but in the end 
she gives up her saintly retirement and marries the Duke 
without much compunction either on her own part or, we 
may imagine, on Shakespeare's. 

Extremes of passion are usually condemned in 
Shakespeare. ?riar Laurence rebukes Romeo for his

(IHenjjIV., 3*1.18o)'I In MW* Ford’s violent extremes of 

Jealousy and penitence are censured by Page: 

Be not as extreme in submission

A man that fortune’s buffets and rewards

Violent grief or joy is liable to surfeit (TOT,,

to excess. As Lady Capulet says to Juliets 

some grief shows much of love? 

But much of grief shows still some want of 
wit. 3#5»73) 

Lady Capulet, it is true, is a cold woman, her own grief 
is highly artificial, but her opinion is echoed in other 
plays (KJ.,5*7.110, Rich.II .. I.3.280, 292-3, 3.2.I78,

SCOTS to be always a little too self-conscious about his

It is possible ^Shakespeare means us to see that he is 
putting on a demonstration of Stoiois®! probably to 
impress Cassius who, throughout this incident (4*3*144ff) 
is presented as the weaker, less OTOtionally stable 
character* the fact tJmt Cassius, who ha© less cause

here and shows the contrast of the two men. But,

means unfeeling: acceptance of the death of his wife and 
child in Mach,, and taking into considdration the fact 
that nothing is said in ^^lut^rch of how Brutus received 
I'ortia’s death,^ it seems likely that the dramatist 


# See Shakespeare* s i lutarch , vol, I,p.l91* 


admires this manly restraint though he may be hinting a 
fault in Brutus* self-conscious demonstration of it, 
Claudius* admonition to Hamlet that 

to persever 

In obstinate condolement is a course 
Of impious stubbornness; *tis unmanly 
grief, etc. ( Ifeim. ,1,2,92) 

is really dramatic, that is, it is to Claudius* 

advantage to say this, but there is less dramatic 

necessity in the Player King*s statement that, 

The violence of either grief or joy 
Their own enactions with themselves destroy! 
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament 
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident, 

(Ss*» 3.2.206) 

The Duke in Qth . offers Brabantio the conventional 
advice against indulging a **bootle3s grief** (1.3.208), 

at- pr-^l'Q^dinq So 

The idea that bearing griefs lightly^ gives them less ^ 

power to hurt, which had appeared in Eioh.XI ..1#3.292-^ 

turns up again in AC.,4.14.135# In the WT•, Camillo 

rebukes Leontes: 

Your sorrow was too sore laid on,

Did ever so long live; no sorrow 

But killed itself much sooner. ( W . .5.3.49)

The thought here is simllpr to the Player King’s,-that 
the very violence of ficrief wears itself out. 

The idea that excess of grief my kill is coupled 
with the recommendations of moderation in Rioh.Xl .. 
2.2.3 and MAA.K ., g. 1.1 > Compare with these passages the 
thought that "care’s an enemy to life" and 

and the oppositeg that "a light heart 
lives long" (LLL., 5»2*l8| 2Hen^il? ». 5# and WT. .4.3* 

134 )• The people in Shakespeare who die of grief are 
few# Gloucester in Lea.r dies of mingled extremes of 
Joy and grief^ Iras and MnolmrlBaB in die of grief, 
and Helena in AWW # is reported to have done so# There 
are songs like Besdemona’s Willow Song and "Ctoe Away 
Death" and references to a miden dying of grief for an 
unhappy love affair (I^.,5.2.16-18, Tg.,2.4,110ff.) 
but this is a conventional theme of love poetry# Old 
Lftfeu in AWW ## seems to sum up Shakespeare’s attitude 
when he sayss 

Moderate lamentation is the right of the 
dead§ excessive grief the enemy of the 
living* (1#1#65) 

Hot only does grief eventually wear itself out 
but "great griefs .## medioln® the less { Cym ..4.2.243)’’y 
a thought which we find also in HJ.,l*2*46ff* and 
KX» *, 3 • 8 # 

Shakespeare seems to have been interested very 
early in the question which the I3uchess of York asks in 
















HieiuIII,, ; 


82 . 


iVhy should calamity be full of words? 

(4.4.126) 


liizabeth replies* 


though what they do impart 
Help not at all yet they do ease the heart,# 

: 130-1) 


# Compare with this Hamletdissipation of emotion in 
words, the tendency to ’^unpacit (hia) heart with words”, 

3Hen,VI , Richard had said that ”to weep is to make 
less the depth of grief (2,1,85)”, but he himself cannot 
”unload (his) heart’s great burthen” by speech or tears 
(2.1,79ff,) and in Rich,III , the same character says. 

None can help our harms by wailing them, 

(2,2.103) 

Earlier tiian this Shakespeare had made old Aegeon 
express reluctance to speak of his ”griefs unspaedcable 
(CE*,l*3i,32)”, but he does so speak and at some length. 
By the time of RJ, it seems likely that elaborate 
theatrical rant like that of the women in ^ich*IXI , had 
come to connote insincerity to Shakespeare, It was not 
insincere in Kioh.lII , since the women form a stylized 
chorus of grief in the Senecan manner# fhey are not 
treated as individuals in the expression of their grief. 
But Shakespeare does not repeat the experiment. In RJ , 
the exaggerated grief of the nurse and the Capulets for 
Juliet (4.5*) is on a level in style with the Pyramus

and Thlsbe episode in . . The stark eimolicity of 

Romeo’s ”Is it even so? (5*1*24)” replaces elaborate 

rhetoric for the most part after this time. The ranting 

lamentations of Constance in ly; belong to the old style, 

and, since there seems to be some doubt as to the exact 

date of the play, may hare been written before HJ. 

The maturer Shakespeare seems to feel that as 

"’silence is the perfectest herald of joy (MA^, ,2,1,317)**, 

so it is the surest sign of sincere grief. This is 

apparent in Hich,II, ,l,3#253i 4,1,295, 2Hen,IY. ,2,4,41Q> 

5,2,22, In HAch,II ,,1,4,11, Aumerle counterfeits true 

grief by pretending to be too oppressed by sorrow to 

speak, Othello’s joy at recovering Desdemona is too 

great for words to conveys 

I cannot speak enough of this contenti 
It stops me here; it is too much of joys 

( Oth. .2.1.198-9) 

Guiderius in Cym , stops his brother’s lament with ""do 
not play in wench-like words with that which is so 
serious (4,2,229)**• 

Yet, 

Sorrow concealed, like to an oven stopt, 

Doth bum the heart to cinders where it is, 

(ItAnd.,2.4.36) 

When Macduff receives the news of the murder of his 

wife and child in silence, Malcolm criesi 

Ne’er pull your hat upon your bro^r^; 
Give sorrow words; the ecrief that does not 
speak 

Whispers the o’er fraught heart and bids it 
break. (Macb, ,4 .3,2q8)

is an important point in Lear and is pointed up in 
1 . 1 , 61 - 4 ., 79‘-8o, 155-6, 186-7, 227-240. Kent also

Sympathy and Suffering 


85 


Shakespeare seems fond of scenes where attempts 
to comfort prove ineffectual, e*g. 2Hen»Vl ,,2,4>26ff, 
and Tj^4nd.,3*l* In §£• Friar Lawrence’s efforts to 
cheer Romeo end only in Romeo’s contemptuous ”hang up 
philosophy (3*3*i“70), and all Gaunt’s endeavors to 
make his son see the bright side regarding his 
banishment are vain ( Rloh»II »«1»3«26Qff♦)» In two 
other passages in Richtll * comfort is brushed asidei 
2 . 2 * 67 ••S and 3 . 2 . 207 * philosophy can avail nothing 
against real grief* Shakespeare in seems to have 

been struck by the proverbial idea that even a 
philosopher cannot endure toothache patiently, for he 
refers to it in 5*10 35 sind when Benedict says he has the 
toothache and Bon Pedro and others suggest remedies, he 
replies! 

Well, every one can master a grief but he 
that has it* ( 3 * 2 * 29 ) 

In the scene where Antonio seeks to comfort Leonato 
( MAAH *t5*l*)« the latter refuses his attempts to ’’patch 
grief v/ith proverbs (5 *I*i7)”» to charm ache with air and 
agony with words (5.1.26)"• Another of these sententious 
comforters "full of wise saws” is the Duke in 0th* * but 
his attempt to console Brabantio meets with no response: 

These sentences, to sugar or to gall, 

Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:

But words are words; I never yet did hear 

That the br«4ieed heart we a pieroed throu^^h 
the ear. ( 0th .>1.3*2l6) 

Sympathy proves vain also in TC.4.4.1ff. and Temp .. 

2.1,1-10, 106, As Pondarus had said (TvQ,, 4.4.19) 

friendship can avail nothing to ease «rief. 

The point of such scenes as that between Romeo 

and the friar, Intonio and Leonato, or Brahantio and 

the Duice is usually that sympathy must he Ineffectual 

if the comforter himself has not suffered, 36 Adriana 

tells Luciana in ^.,2.1,32-7, Homeo echoes it in RJ .. 

2,2.1 and 3*3*64 and Constance re**echoes it in ICJ ., 

3.4.104. Leonato in EAAJ' ^, has a long speech in this 

point: 

Hor let no comforter delight mine ear 
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine} 
Bring me a father, that so loved his child, 
Whose joy of her is overwhelm*d like mine. 

And bid him speak of patience.«•«•« 

ITo, no; *tis all men’s office to speak 
patience 

To those that wring under the load of sorrow, 
But no man’s virtue, nor sufficiency, 

To be 30 moral when he shall endure 
The like himself. ( MAAl ..5.1.6ff} 

This speech is a very long discussion of the problem, 

much longer than the situation and the importance of 

Leonato in the play, would warrant, a fact which indicates 

Shakespeare’s interest in the idea. In AYil* . Sylvius 

tells phebe she would pity him if she had ever been in 

love ( 3 * 5 * 28 ). 

There are four very similar passages in which this 
thought is vividly presented with regard to the loss of 




















87 


children. In the tirst i .vo, . iHen,V I,, ^nd 

T^fend .»1«1,107 the parent expressea the Idea that, if 
the murdererB of hie children had children of their oto, 
they would he more merciful. In when iardolph seeks 
to pacify Constances 

You hold too heinous a respect of grief. 

(S2*t3*^*90) 

'Jve have the brief but moving rdpiy: 

He talks to me that never had a son. 

and in Macb . SJacduff answers Malcoln!s consolations 
merely with. 

He has no children {ggob*,4.3.216) 

^idently Shakespeare thought the effectiveness of that 

n7<i<l£ ir 

reply;^ worth rex;eating. 

KL . is full of the sense that only by suffering 
can we attain to true sympathys 


Lear: 


Take physic, pomp a 

Expose thyself to feel wiiat vivetohes feel 
That thou myst shake the supearflux to them, 
And show the heavens more just. 

{££..,3.4.33) 


Oloucesteri

That slaves your ordinance, that will not see

sympathy, also distinguishes the strong from the weak,

misfortune, symbolized by exposure to the elements, 
brings self-knowledge appears in AYLI ».2.1.6 and is 
dramatically implicit in 'KL. 

3. Interrelation of Mind and Body . 

With regard to physical and mental suffering 

Shakespeare is keenly aware of the close relationship 

of mind and body. The idea that "the spiritual depends 

# 

upon the physical state" " lies behind Hen. V*8 speech

before Harfleur ( Hen^V • The influence of 

mind over body is brought out by Henry in the next act; 

^hen the mind is quickened, out of doubt, 

The organs, though defunct and dead before. 
Break up their drowsy grave and newly move, 
ith oasted slough and fresh legerity^ 

(Hen^,4.1.20} 

The idea is more often associated with suffering, 

2 dgar in wonders whether Gloucester*s desire to die 
may not kill him: 

ind yet I know not how conceit may rob 
The treasury of life, when life itself 
Yields to the theft* ( KX, ,4*6*4^) 

with which passage compare AYLI ,,2»6*8, where Orlando 

tells Adam his ^conceit is nearer death than (his) 

powers. 3ee also WJ.. ,4,4,5S3* power of imagination 

increases with bodily weakness# The ghost tells Hamlet 

Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works 

(3#4#114) 

KL# is full of the interaction of bodily and 
mental suffering. Leai* says mental suffering makes him 
imperiTjpus to the storm; 

^ii'hen the mind’s free 

The body’s delicate; the tempest in my mind 
Doth from my senses take all feeling else 
Save what beats there. (ICL#t3>4.11) 

Then a few lines later he expresses the converse idea; 

This tempest will not give me leave to ponder 
On things would hurt me more ( EX. # 3♦4#24) 

He realizes early^^l’fect of bodily suffering on the 


mind; 











92 


Infirmity doth still neglect all office 
i?;hereto our health is hound, we are not 
ourselves 

JS/hen nature, being oppress’d, commands the 
iuxnd 

To suffer with the body. (|a.,2.4.l07) 

So Lear excuses Cornwall and Regan’s rudeness and so 

Agrippa exolains Coriolanus’ coolness to the envoy 

sent him from Rome ( Cori ..$.1.glff). The dulling effect 

of sleep suid eating on the mind is noted in AC*^2.1.26), 

So closely are bcxjr and mind interrelated that it 

is believed the condition of the mind affects the 

outward appearance. In friends who are much togetir; 

Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love, 

There must be needs a like proportion 
Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit. 

(1V*»3.3.X1) 

This idea, that the mind should conform to outward 
appearance, that the evil mind will have an ugly 
outside and that ugliness is an indication of an evil 

soul, is of platonic origin and is found in many. 

C-a. .s 5yV/a^')k T^.. 

Elizabethan particularly the sonneteers. ^ Both 

Y 

Richard of Gloucester ( 3Hen.VI ..5*6.78) and Aahon the 
Modt ( T.And ..3»1*204)make their outward repulsiveness 
the scapegoat for the deformity of their minds. The 
converse idea, that inner virtue can impart beauty to 
outward appearance^is seen in 0th. . Unlike Aaron’s, 
Othello’s blackness carries with it no blackness of

behind the statements that murderers should look grim

negation of the Platonic doctrine, the realization that 
outward appearance is deceptive, that ^ 

There* a no art 

To find the mind*s construction in the faca 

(^ob,* 1,4,11^ 

Often coupled with this thought is the idea that beauty 

ought to be an indication of virtue, and the sense of 

the pity of it, that a beautiful exterior may be the 

covering for fljulness and sin. 

The imagery in which the notion is clothed is 

often the same* There are three repetitions of the 

Virgilian image *latet gmguis in herba (Selogues,III>93)* 

as the snake, rolled in the flowering 
bank, 

With shining checker*d slough, doth sting a 
child, 

That for the beauty thinks it excellent#

In addition to these closely imitated passages, 
there are a great number of other expressions of the 
idea of the deceptiveness of appearance* They occur in 
C^,3.2«12, and Iiic£eoL93. 1074, Hich,XII . is full of 
them, as one would expect from the dissimulating 
character of the heros(2*2*27, 3»i^7> 3*5*^9») there 
is the long and rather artificial passage in where 

Juliet contrasts the beauty of Borneo with his murderous

re-emphasized in the scroll found in the right casket 

(1.132). The apparent impurity of the beautiful Hero 

gives occasion for an outburst from Claudio; 

0, what authority and show of truth 
Can cunning sin cover itself withalS 

(MM®.,4,1.36) 

He continues in the same strain in 4.1*101ff. Hote 

also MAAN .12.1.127. Without any particular reason 

either in the content or in the character of the speaker, 

Shakespeare gives this thought to Viola in TO. when she 

says to the sea captain who has just rescued her, and 

whom she could have no reason to distrust: 

And though that nature in a beauteous wall 
Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee 
I will believe thou hasia mind 
With this thy fair and outward character. 

(1.2.48) 

Also in TH. we have the incident of Antonio^s thinking 
he has been betrayed by the handsome youth, Sebastian, 
which does little but complicate the plot and give 
occasion for the expression of some of Shakespeare’s 
favorite ideas (see pp»/o/^//z). 

Antonio comments: 

In nature there’s no blemish but the mind; 

Hone can be called deformed but the unkind. 

Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil 1 

Are empty trunks o’erflourished by the devil. 

(T1*i3*4..40-3) 

In T£. an irrelevant incident where Hector kills a 
soldier^ftimptuous armor alia»ws Shakespeare to introduce f 
the thought yet again (5*8.1-2). Besides the passages

already cited from Ham , the theme appears twice in 

and There are further examples from 

m.,2.4.12, 5-l*52, 5.1.257. Both Othello and ’honest 

lago* justify the observation that "there’s no art to 

find the mind’s construction in the face." 1b,rq boasts 

of his ability to conceal his true natur#» under a 

deceptive exterior (1.1,6I), and Othello harps on the 

painful contrast of Desdemona’s beauty and the foulness 

of her supposed sin (4.1.188-210). The theme is present 

in the ravings of Lear: 

Thou perjured and thou simular man of virtue 
That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake, 
That under covert and convenient seeming 
Hast practised on man’s life. (KL.t 3.2,53) 

and later in 4,6,120ff, Albany touches on the thought 

when he is disillusioned about Goneril r4,2.62-<»6 and 

5.3»85)* have already cited the most iu^ortant 

example from Macb , but there are others in 1,7*82, 

1,5*64., 3.2,34, Malcolm gives the thought a slight 

twist in 4,3,23: 

Though all things fouj. would wear the brows 
of grace, 

Yet grace must still look so. 

The thought is glanced at in AC, .2,6.102, occurs once 
in T.Ath. ,1,1,161 and five times in Gym, , 3.2,19.1 3*4-. 56,

It Is true there are instances of the opposite point 

of view, that the fane is indioative of the character* 

Talhot in lHen»VI *,2>3*73 thinks that one who mistakes 
his bodily strength may also mistake his mind* Usually 
the statement is proved wrong by the events of the 

drama* Hastings in Kioh»IXX « thinks he oan tell 

Richard's mind by his face but he finds to his cost he

much as this thought is reiterated more often than any 


other one idea in Shakespeare one must attribute his 
interest to something more personal than its usefulness 
as a poetic convention. The insistence upon it, and 
the consistency of the terms in which it is expressed 
strongly suggest personal feeling behind it. 

The related idea that a murderer or villain does 
not always look ^grirn’ Xsat more often may <hide it in 
smiles and affability*, appears in Hich,III ,,^, 2 , 182 , 

TjrAnd#,,3*^• 1*^1> 4’,1,5’0, Hamlet, upon the 
ghost’s revelations feels he should record the bitter 
realization that 

One may smile, and smile, and be a villain# 

( Ham, .l,5#lQ8) 

Donalbain in Macb , puts it succinctlyi 

There’s daggers in men’s smiles* (2*3,145) 

See also 2Hen#IV ,, Ind* 9*11 and gL,, 2,2,78.

rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a 
poor house; so does your pearl in your foul 
oyster, ( AYLI ,,5,4.62) 

says Touchstone echoing his remark in 3*3*29. idea had 

previously been given to Celia ( AYLI ..1,2,40), More 

serious in import is Hamlet’s warning to Ophelia; 

if you be honest and fail*, your honesty 
should admit no discourse to your beauty,,, 
for the power of beauty will sooner transform 
honesty from what it is to a bawd than the 
force of honesty can translate beauty into 
his likeness, 

Isabella in |m, being both fair and good draws from the 

Jiluke the reflection that 

The goodness that is cheap in beauty makes 
beauty brief in goodness. ( 3 , 1 , 183 ) 

The supposedly cynical Enobarbus in Ac, holds that 

There is ne’er a true woman has a true face- 

(2.6.104) 

and the disillusioned Posthumus in Cym» says 

Let there be no honor 
Where there is beauty. (2,4,108) 

The thought that disillusionment is one trusted 

c^3t3 doubt on all is a common one throughout the plays 

and is often coupled with the idea of deceptive 

appearance. It occurs in lHen,VI, ,1.2,l5Q» T,And ,, 

2 , 3,182 and is developed more fully in the traitor 

scene in Hen,V. ,2,2,127ff♦ which is apparently contrived 

to express a number of Shakespeare’s favored themes, 


mercy and justice, ingratitude, deceptive appearance 
























101 


of virtue etc. In TH. the theme ia brought into the 
episode of Antonio and Sebastian as a Qorollary to the 
idea that beauty may conceal evil(TN., 

5*or Hamlet the Queen*a incest is 

Such an act 

That blurs the grace and blush of modesty, 
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose 
i?rom the fair forehead of an innocent love 
And sets a blister there, ( Ham# . 

Troilus feels he had better think the woman who is 

false to him is not Cress id x-ather than let her sin 

Square the general sex by Cressid*s rule. 

15 . 2 . 126 ) 

The thought is behind the remark given to the gentleman 

(who is not characterized) that Cordelia 

redeems nature from the general 
©urse 

Which twain (i.e.Goneril and Began) have 

brought her to. 

(KI.,.4.6.209) 

In Cym . Posthumus, supposing Imogen false thinks all 

women are (2.5*and Imogen concludes the same of 

men, linking the reflection with the deceptive appearance 

theme (3*4*56)# The last direct statement of the 

thought occurs in WT».2.1.133. 

AS the sin of one taints all, so the noblest 

character, even virtue itself, is not safe from slander, 

Whose whisper o*er the worldfe diameter 
As level as the cannon to his blank 
Transports his poisoned shot. ( Ham ..4»l#40) 

This thought is particularly prominent in Ham ., for we 

















get it again, first from Laertes: 


102 


Virtue itself ’scapes not calumnious strokes 


and then from Hamlet: 

Be thou chaste as ice etc....thou 

Shalt not escape calumny. {3«1»140) 

In the Luke echoes: 

No might nor greatness In mortality 
Can censure ’scape; hack-^wounding calumny 
The whitest virtue strikes. What king so 
strong 

Can tie the gall up in the slanderous 
tongue? (3.2.200) 

Other instarices of this thought may be found in Cym . in 
3*^*35t an^ song 4.2.272; and in TO. .2.1.73« 

2.3*85»6, With the last compere Rich.IX ..1.1.171* 


Heputation and Honor . 

The importance of reputation or good name is the 
theme of a long poetic speech from Mowbray in Rich.II. . 
1.1.166. 


My dear, dear lord. 

The purest treasure mortal times afford 
Is spotless reputation: that away. 

Men are but gilded loam, or painted clay, 
A jewel in a tien times barr’d-*up chest 
Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast. 

Mine honor is my life, both grow in one; 
Take honor from me, and my life is done. 

This anticipates Cassio in Cth.s 

Reputation, reputation, reputation! 0, I 
have lost my reputationi I have lost the 
immortal part of myself, and what remains 
is bestial. ( 0th. .2.^.262.) 











































103 


lago also eclioes the sentiment: 

n 

Good name ih man and woman, dear my lord. 
Is the immediate Jewel of their souls, 

(5.3.156) 


The fact that this is insincere in lago (see 2,3,267) 
does not necessarily prevent the ilea from being 
Shakespeare’s, in fact strengthens the probability, 

ho nor - or rejjuta t ion - as *’mine

Shakespeare’s thought on honor is hard to determin 
Many characters express the idea that honor should be 
dearer than life: 3Hen,VI ,»1,1,246, ^.,1*2*96, TC,, 
5.3.27. Both Hal and Hotspur illustrate the soldier’s 
thirst for honor, “seeking the bubble, reputation, even 
in the cannon’s mouth**: see ( Xian,I¥ , ,2^4,22), Hen. I?, . 
1,3,201, 3,2,106-.7* 4-,l,10| Hen,IT .. 4,3*22, HeiuY’s , 
speech before Agincourt where he presents the notion 
that the lesser power shows the greater daring and 
reaps more honor^is anticipated by Hotspur ( IHen^IS, , 
4,1,75). Hamlet contrast^himself with Fortinbra® and 
remarks s 


Rightly to be great 

Is,.. 

• .greatly to find quarrel in a straw 
When honor’s at the stake* ( Ham* ,4,4,53) 

but it is in Hamlet tiiat Shakespeare is interest^^not 

Fortinbras, Another seeker after honor is Bertram in 

AWW . ,2,1,30, There are as many advocates of lionest 

realism; the greatest among them is Falstaff who, 























104 


as a professional soldier has no Illusions about 
’gaining honor*, hat holds that ’discretion is the 
better part of valor*, and honor but a word ( IHen,IV^. 
5*1.127ff., 5.4.122). For the same point of 

view from another character see lHen,Vl ,,4,3»l6, Hen,V. ^ 
3,2,10ff., Cym »,3*3*49, in TO*,2,2,1 Hector and Troilus 
have a discussion, the point of which is that the 
reasonable man is a coward in the eyes of honor. What 
Shakespeare’s opinion was it is dangerous to conjectu^^e* 
Henry V, is his ideal king and Hotspur is a hero for 
whom Shakespeare had a good deal of symx^athy, but it is 
as unlikely that Shakespeare shared their exalted 
craving for honor as that he concurred seriously in 
Falstaff’s topsy-turvy morality* 

5* kei^cy and Gentleness * 

We have already seen something of Sliakespeare’s 
attitude to mercy in Chapter I where we discussed 
Portia’s and Isabella’s eloquent appeals for mercy 
against strict justice* Mercy is regarded as a sign of 
nobility in T*And *,1,1*119 and the same is implied in 
the action of the play* In Rich*III , Anne and Clarence 
both make appeals to pity^ comparing those who lack 
pity to the beasts5 l,2*71t 1*4*266, but since each is 
pleading for mercy, these probably should be discarded 
as dramatic. Richard himself repudiates pity, 4,2,66.

Orlando in \YLI . appeals to the ’aacred pity’ of the 
duke, 2.7.116, Aopeals to the heavens for pity such as 
we find in T.And ..3*1.206, 4^1.123* and ai.* 3*5.198 
suggest that it is a sacred thing. There are of course 
a number of appeals to revenge, chiefly dramatic, Isit 
in AYM. Oliver, tolling of Orlando’s i*escuiiig him frcaa 
the lioness, talks of 

kindness, nobler than revenge, 

(4.3.129) 

and Prospero^ when he has his enemies in his power 
decides that 

the rarer action is 

In virtue than in vengeance, ( femp .♦5.1.27) 

The gentleness of Shakespeare is traditional. It 

shows in his valua^tion of kind words; see If ., 1.2.94 

and Hen.VIII ..3.2.152. The value of gentleness 1@ 

applied even to state affairs in Hen.V. .3.6.19*20. As 

the duke In AYLI . saysj 

your gentleness shall force 
More than your force move us to gentleness. 

( 2 . 7 * 102 ) 

So too the second senator to Alcibiades in T.Ath» .5.4.44t 

v'hat thou wilt 

Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile 
Than he%^ to it with tdiy sword. 

This gentleness and magnanimity is brought out fcn 

such passages as tiiat in the inouction to the TS. where 

the lord, planning the practical joke on Sly says; 



















io6. 

This do, find ^ kindly , gentle sirs: 

It v/ill he pastime passing excellent. 

If it be husbanded with modesty* 

"ItF., lnd*l*65) 

and later he hopes his presence will prevent any frcaa 
pushing their mocker^^ too far. In MWW * Mrs. Pord ends 
all recriminations and proposes an entertainment to which 
even Falstaff is Invited. Hamlet checks any disposition 
on the part of the players to mock polonius ( 2 . 2 . 571 *) • 
The sai/ie magnanimity is revealed in his tolerance of 
amateur acbing (LU..,2.500, Igg.,5.1.82ff., AC.,2.5.8). 

6, Endursmce and Loyalty . 

Perhaps even more than mercy and gentleness, 
Shakespeare seems to have admired the philosophical 
acceptance of misfortune. We get it in Bromio in C£., 
4*4.22, and in Costard^s malapropisms in , X. 1.305. 
Costard’s ’sour cup of prosperity’ anticipates IHen.YI ., 
3.1.24; 

Let me embrace thee, sour adversity; 

For wise men say it is the wisest course. 

Bolingbroke, in Rich.II ..1.3.145# seems to be another to 

embrace misfortune cheerfully, but in the ensuing scene 

it is Gaunt who advocates resignations 

There is no virtue like necessity. 

( Rich.II ..1.3.277.) 

So in 2Hen.iy ..1.2.271 Falstaff thinks 

A good wit will make use of anything? I will 
turn diseases to commodity.

evidently maoli in ohakespeare’s mind around tiie time of 

AYLI ♦ and later. Old A dam in that play is the first of 

a series of characters, who exemplify this (Quality and 

are all treated with great sympathy by the dramatist, 

Orlando says of Adam.* 

0 good old mi^n, how well in thee appears 
The constant service of the antique v/orld 
Vhen service weat for duty, not for aoad, 

(AZui*,2.3,b^6.) 

Compare Adam’s declaration of faithful service to' death 

in the same scene. Typical of lago’s perverted moral 

system is his contempt for the 

duteous and hnee**crooklng icnava, 

That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, 
Wears out his time. 

For naught but provender.( Oth „I.1.45) 

Snobarbus wavers between loyalty and cynicism: 

The loyalty well held to fools does make 
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure 
To follov/ with sllegiance a fallen lord 
Does conquer him that did his ms ter conquer 
And earn a place in the story^ 

(^.»ia3.42) 

and surely Shakespeare’s attitude is apparent in 
ii]nobar1:Hi3’ end* Flavius is the type of faithful 
servant and his loyalty almost redeems mankind in the 
eyes of Timon (4.3.494). In peri *, in iialicanus, as the 
epilogue {i.e*Oower) tells us, 

you will descry 

A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty.

7* J*lattery and Intiratitude * 

Squai to or exceeding his admiration of such 

loyalty is Shakespeare’s ixatred of selfish and feigned 

love and of ingratitude* We have noted already Orlando’s 

reference to the present times when 

None will sweat hut for promotion, 

( AyLI* * 2 *^* 60 ) 

and Jaques in the same play compares the herd of deer to 

the con5)lacent rich sweeping unheeding past the ’poor 

and broken bankrupt* (2#1*54) from whose friendship they 

stand to gain nothing more* In Brutus inveighs 

against false friends who fail in the trial (4*2*23)* 

Hamlet is bitter on this subject and says to Horatioj 

do not think I flatter: 

For what advancement may I hope from thee 
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits, 

To food and clothe thee? Why should the poor 
be flattered? 

and again: 

The great man doTO^ you mrk his favorite flies 
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies. 

(3*2.214) 

Hamlet also, like Bratus, adds that friends fail one in 

time of trouble { 3 . 2 * 217 )# In 5*1*87 there is an 

anticipation of a passage in T »A>th* where 

Lord such-a-one praised my lord such-a-one’s 
horse whhn he meant to beg it.*.** 
(Ham.,5.1*87) 













110 


Compare TtA-th, , 1«2.217 and 2*1*5# The thought recurs 
in TC» ,this time from Achilles: 

»Tis certain, greatness, once fain out with 
fortune, 

Kust fall out with men too: what the declined 
is 

He shall as soon read in the eyes of others 
feel in his own; for men, like butter-flies, 

Show not their mealy wings but to the summer**. 

( 3 . 3 . 75 ) 

The fool’s Jingles in Lear are full of this theme, 
(2,4,66ff, 73*4-, T,Ath . it becomes an 

obsession. It is given to the poet in 1,1,55^’f‘f 
appears in Apemantus’ grace, (1,2,63)^ is given to 
Apemantus again (1*2,136^ to Flavius (2,2,174^ to flaminius 
(3.1.53# suid to the first stranger, (3.2.7(5, to the second 
lord {3*6,30), to Tlmon (3*6,98ff«), and to Flavius again 
(4,3,468^ Timon, the idealist, alone voices the idea 
that friends should come to one^s aid in trouble (1,2,90) 
and he is laughed at by all. (see 2.1,5*). Antony, 
at his fall, finds the tiuth about the selfish love of 
flattering followers: 

the hearts 

That spaniell’d me at heels, to whom I gave 

Their wishes, do discandy, and melt their 
sweets 

On blossoming Caesar, ( AC, ,4,12,20) 
and Cleopatra also discovers **how pomp is followed” 
when she is betrayed by her servant S^Xeoui^ (5.2,l50 ff,). 
Finally Buokin^^m, in Hen»VIIX , echoes the thought 
once more 2,1,126, 











Ill 


In Tlmo n and Lear particularly* the thought of 
self-seeking love is bound up with hatred of ingratitude* 
The earliest condemnation of ingratitude appears in T*And * 
1*1.447 "but has nothing in common in imagery or feeling 
with the la^.ur passages, in 2Hen *IV**4*5.65ff♦ the king 
launches into a long tirade on filial ingratitudei 

see, sons, what things you arei 
For this the foolish over-careful fathers 
Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their 
brains with care***** 

\^e bring it (honey) to the hive, and, like 
the bees, 

Are murdered for our pains* This bitter taste 
Yield his engrossments to the ending father. 

This is the first strong statement of the theme* The 

king here is very ready to Jump to conclusions about 

Hal’s intentions and one suspects the incident is 

engineered as much to give ocoasion for the expression 

of this idea as to show Hal’s regeneration* In the 

following play, Hen»V ** Hal himself is given a chance 

to rebuke ingratitude in his turn (2*2*94)* The 

passage is expanded and almost seems an unwanted 

interruption just as the expedition is about to leave 

for France. This is the only place where traitors are 

reproached with ingratitude# and there would have been 

other ways of showing Hal’s fijmmess in dealing with 

rebellion* The ingratitude theme, though not strong 

in AYLI ♦ is introduced in ”Blow. Blow Thou Winter Wind**' 

A few years later in Tg* Viola is made to sayi 













112 


I liate lncrs.titude wore in a man 

Than lying, vainness, habhling, dnAnkenness, 

Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption 
Inhabits our frail blood* (3«^*388) 

This occurs in the scene where Antonio mistakes her for 

Sebastian, an episode which as we have seen allows 

Shakespeare to introduce a number of ideas which 

interested him* Hote also TO* *3»4*402 and 5*i*So* ^t 

is Brutus* **ingratitude, more strong than traitor’s 

arms (3,2,189)" that kills Caesar* The ingratitude 

theme becomes most insistent in KL, i 

Ingratitude, thou Kiarble«*hearted fiend. 

More hideous when thou show’st thee in a child 
Than the sea^monster, {1.4,281) 

How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is 
To have a thankless child, {1,4,310) 

Monster ingratitudel (lt5*42) 

she hath tied 

Sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, 
here, (2*4,136) 

Filial ingratitudel 

Is it not as if this mouth should tear this 
hand 

For lifting food to’t? (3«4»14) 

Ingratitude seems to have been associated with the idea 

of monstrosity in Shgikespeare’s mind for we find in T*Ath , 

0, see the monstrousness of nan 
i^hen he looks out in an ingrateful shapet 

( 3 * 2 . 78 ) 

He’s flung in rage from this ingrateful seat 
Of monstrous friends. (4,2,45) 

I am rapt, ana cannot count 
The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude 
With any size of words, (5«i*67)

In Cori. also "ingratitude is monstrous" 2.3.9ff. and 
in time is 

a great-sized monster of ingratitude. 

; 2 . 3 . 14 . 7 ) 

The theme of ingratitude is as strong in Timon as in 

Lear . In addition to the passages cited it appears aloo 

in 3.4.26, in Timon’s grace r3.6t73),in the ingratitude 

of the senate for Alcihiades (3*5.9^ff^,and in Timon’s 

curses in 4.3« which hear considerable resemblance to 

passages in Lear . Timon, addressing nature, cries, 

iinsear thy fertile and conceptions womb. 

Let it no more bring out ingrateful man.... 
Dry up thy marrows, wines and plough-tom 

leas I 

Whereof ingrateful man, with liquorish 

draughts 

And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind. 
That from it all consideration slips. 

(4.3.186) 

Compare KL. 

Crack nature’s moulds, all germens spill 

at once 

That make ingrateful man. 

( 3 . 2 * 8 ) 

Timon wishes the earth may teem with tigers, wolves, 
dragons, and monsters because of ingratitude (4.3*188), 


8. Good and Evil Relative. 


One can never hope to find in Shakespeare any 
settled moral code, or to enlist him on any side in a 
moral issue. He is consistently moral but not a moralist

in the sense that he regards virtue and vice as 
absolute queintities. As Miss Spurgeon puts it: 

He is ever conscious of the strange mixture 
of both good and evil in our life and being, 
of the necessity for the presence of both to 
make up the fabric as we know it. # 


# 0£. Pit .. p. 6u. 


There is a scene in AW . 4.3« where two lords enter 
apparently only to comment on the course of the action, 
neither is characterized to any extent, so that their 
remarks may be safely taken to represent Shakespeare*s 
own comment on the play. After some discussion the first 
lord remarks; 

The web of our life is of a mingled yam, 
good and ill together, our virtues would be 
proud, if our faults whipt them not: and our 
crimes would despair, if they were not 
cherisht by our virtues. (4.3*83-4) 

So Friar Laurence in gj. who is in some respects a sort of 

choms to the play, had said: 

Two such opposed kings encamp them still 
In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will 

(R£.,2.3.27-30) 

Good and evil are not absolute. ]3vil may result in good 

and good may, by abuse, become evil. 

For naught so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some special good doth give, 
nor aught so good but strain’d from that fair 

use 

Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse; 
Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied, 

And vice sometimes by action dignified.

Evil use may be made of good qualities; 

^here an unclean mind carries virtuous 
qualities, there commendations go with 
pity, • they are virtues and traitors 
too. 

When virtues are misapplied; 

When these so noble benefits shall prove 
Not well disposed, the mind growing once 
corrupt, 

They turn to vicious forms, ten times more 
ugly 

Than ever they were fair#( Hen,VIXI ,«1«2«11^) 
Orlando’s virtues are **sanctified and holy traitors’* 
to him (AYLI.,2.3.13). Similar in idea is Gloucester’s 
obeervation that 

Our means secure us, and our mere defects 
Prove our commodities, ( KXt .4.1.22) 

(Good in one may encourage evil in another ( Temp «»lf2.93ff) 

Vice’’sometimes by action dignified "appears in KJ# .1.1.261 

and in BM . 

What sin you do to save a brother’s life 
Nature dispenses with the deed so far 
That it becomes a virtue.(3*1 •IB^-)

Too much good may turn to evil, as Bolingbroke observes 
to York; 

Thy overflow of good converts to bad.

virtue or vice becomes so only in its effect on others: 

Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,.... 
Things growing to themselves are growth’s 
abuse* (VA.,63-6) 

The wise Ulysses, whose function is often to voice the 

dramatist’s views^reads from a book; 

That man, how dearly ever parted, 

How much in having, or without or in. 

Cannot make boast to have that which he hath, 
Hor feels not what he owes but by reflection; 
As when his virtues shining upon others 
Heat them, and they retort that heat again 
To the first giver. {!£•»3*3.96) 

and comments; 

ho man is the lord of anything- 
Though in and of him there is much consisting- 
Till he communicate his parts^ to others; 

Hor doth he of himself know them for aught 
Till he behold them formed in thfe applause 
Where they’re extended; (3.3.115') 

The Duke in expresses it thus; 

Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, 

Hot light them for themselves; for if our 
virtues 

Did not go forth of us, ’twere all alike 
As if we had them not******, 
nature never lends 

The smallest scruple of her excellence 
But like a thrifty goddess, she detemines 
Herself the glory of a creditor

There are other ideas on morals which recur only 
once or twice or which are commonplaces* These deserve

mention but are too infrequent or too generally accepted 


to fl:ive us anything conolusiye as to Shakespeare^s 
personal opinions. 

In IHen.VI ..5.2.18 and 2Hen.VI ..4.1.129 fear is 

said to be base, unworthy of true nobility and in TC. 

we have the idea that it distorts (3«2*70) but there is 

little in direct statement to lend support to Miss 

Spurgeon’s conclusion that to Shakespeare fs?er is the 

# 

worst evil. 


# 0p. cit ..p.l54. 

There are a number of passages which indicate that 
caution or circumspection is better than false security 
(TG.,2.2.14, 3.2.74, Sim.,1.3.43, and Mac^ ..3.5.32). 
However the passage in Maob . is generally taken to be 
the work of Middleton, and the idea is contradicted in 

m.,1.4.77, 

The thought that conscience makes a man a coward, 
propounded by the murderer in Hich.Ill ..1.4.117 and 
again by Richard in 5 * 3 . ^79 reappears in Ham , i 

Thus conscience does make cowards of us all:# 

(3.1.83) 


# The references in Rich.Ill , make it clear that the 
word ♦conscience’ i s to be iaken in its obvious meaning 
in Ham , in spite of various attempts to attach a special 
interpretation to it.

The wickednees of flattery ie implicit in 
Shakespeare's denunciations of selfish feigned love* 
Flattery of kings is condemned in Hen*V .,4*1*267* 
KL.,4*6*9bff* 

They do abuse the king that flatter him; 

For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;*** 
Whereas reproof, obedient, and in order. 

Fits kings, as they are men, for thev mav 
err* ( piSJ^i *«i* ^ * 39) 

is the opinion of Helicanus in Peri* and the condem¬ 
nation of flattery in general is repeated in 4.3*45* 


That hope is a flatterer appears in Hich*II **2*2*7Qff♦ 
and Temp * * 3*2*7-8* 
a 

The uncertainty of the favor of the great is noted 
Hich*III * * 3*4*98* Those who depend on the favor of the

Belarius tells his experiences to hia foster sons, 
Guiderius perfunctorily exclaims ^uncertain favor” 
{3*3«64)*1 Wolsey too finds the wxetchedness of those 
”that hang on prince's favors {Hen*TXXI*,3*2*367)

Shakespeare*

The evil that men do lives after them.

close to the passage in JC» ; 

Men’s evil mfuinora live in brass; their'

The same thought is implied in IHen,IV # # *7»4#99, 

Ambition is the soldier’s virtue,( 0th»t 3*3*149 
and AC*, 3*1*223). Yet Hotspur is condemned for ’^ill-

two college friends find it merely a shadowy dream; 

Rosencrantz: I hold ambition of so airy and 

light a quality

a kingdom was too small a bound for Hotspur^s spirit and

Hosencrantz replies^ »*your ambition makes it onei »tis

interest in the problem of ambition is attested by his 
making Macbeth’s ’vaulting ambition the basis of that 
play# The famous ajdvise of Wolsey to **fling away 
ambition { Hen*VXII *»3»2»441^” was probably not written 
by Shakespeare though it may have been suggestoby him#

purpose was much in Shakespeare’s mind when he wrote Ham , 
seems likely since it is brought to the attention of the 
audience in two passages. The Player King saysi 

Purpose is but the slp.ve to memory^ 

Of violent birth, but poor validity: 

(Ham.,3.2.198ff.) 

and Claudius observes: 

that we would do 

We should do when we would; for this ’would’ 

changes 

And hath abatements and delays as many 

As there are tongues, are hands, are 

accidents. 

And then this * should’ is like a spendthrift 

sigh, 

That hurts by easing, ( Hejm* ,4,7*115) 

Only once elsewhere does the thought appear and that is 
in Macb * *4.1,144, Hamlet and Macbeth also share the 
thought that complete revenge requires damnation of the 
victim: Ham ,, 3*1*74* Macb »,4,^,214, Claudius will not 
be damned if he is killed while praying. This belief is 
behind the fact that murderers give their victims a 
chance to pray. Compare 0 th ,,5,2.25ff,, 

As an example of how an idea may be emphasized 
in one play and echoed faintly in another of appooximate 
date there are four passages in from various 
speakers to the effect that praise should come preferably 
from one’s enemies, for: 

The worthiness of praise distains his worth, 

If that the praised himself brings forth 

the praise, 

But what the repining enemy commends

Compare also TC ,t^*3*l6y, The 

steward in AWW , (for no particular dramatic reason) 

voices the same thought; 

For then we wound our modesty, and make 
foul the clearness of our deservings when 
of ourselves we publish them, (1,3*5) 

So too and Mfl. both contain the thought that men 

seek only novelty: TC* ,3^3MM*.3*2,243* 

The glib justification of perjury, thati 

It is great sin to swear unto a sini 
But greater sin to keep a sinful oath, 

( 2Hen,irx ,. 5* 1,182^3) 

reappears in 3Hen.VI ,,5*1*89*91 and in a long, only 
half-serious speech from Berowne in Xl^L *,4,3*286-362, 
which is rather a tour de force of wit than a serious 
justification of himself and his companions for breaking 
their oath, pandulph in g£* has a very similar bit of 
sophistry ( 3 ,l, 26 o) which is in keeping with his 
character* There is a final repetition of the idea in 
AWW *.4,2,27-9* This sort of thing is a handy excuse to 
extricate oneself from any unwelcome commitments and 
seems to be dramatic only. 

That pleasure is always in the seeking rather than 
in the having is a commonplace almost proverbial and 
finds frequent expressions MAM,,4,1,219, M¥*,2,6,8*19, 
TC ,tl*2,311* MM,,3*1*22, AC * *1*4,4Q and ,Coj?d« ,4,1,15*

Proverbial Ideas , 

Besides these leaser I'ecurring ideaa there are a 
few proverbial notions which recur with some regularity 
Shakespeare’s favorite proverb is ’’past care, past cure”, 
which occurs in various forms in IJIL ,, 5*2#29> TOV* e 3*1»242

Fnobarbus echoes, ”That truth should be silent I had

upon the lips of dying men” is behind KJ*.5»4,26ff. and 
is developed poetically at length by Gaunt in his very

CHAPTER III 

INTERHSIATEB IDEAS. 

AS Shakespeare’s thought on various topics begins 
to take shape, certain groups or patterns of ideas are 
seen to he associated with surprising consistency, often 
so much so that it becomes impossible to discuss one 
without reference to the other. The most clear cut 
example of these interrelated groups appears in the 
ideas on sleep, music, and madness. Related to music 
and madness is melancholy, which is also associated 
with the ideas on world-weariness and suicide. Finally 
there is a less well-defined group which includes 
pastoralism, the notion that nature is kinder than man, 
and the ingratitude theme, naturally not all the ideas 
on sleep, for example, are related to all those on 
music, but the association between the ideas in any one 
group is so strong as to make it convenient to discuss 
them together, 

A. Sleep , Music , and Madness , 

1, Sleep . 

Sleep is a common theme of Elizabethan poetry. 
Indeed apostrophes to sleep go back to Petrarch, and in

England, at least as far as Chaucer. In The Book of 

the Duchess Chaucer has a passage on sleep in which he 

promises liorpheus a feather bed ' 

Of down of pure doves white.... 

And many a pi}.owe, and every her 
Of cloth of Reynes, to slope softe;... 

.. and al hys halles 

I wol do peynte with pure gold etc. 

0£. oit.,p.3i8, l.250ff.. 

Sydney’s famous sonnet is typical of these addresses to 
sleep. He calls it ”the certain knot of peace.... the 
halm of woe . The poor man’s wealth , the prisoner’s 
release, etc.” and promises gifts*”smooth pillows, 
sweetest hed, a chamber deaf to noise and blind to light, 
a rosy garland and a weary head**. Many were the 
comparisons drawn in Elizabethan lyric between the 
carefree laborer’s sound and healthy sleep and the 
wakeful cares of greatness. The theme of ’’Art thou poor 
but hast thou golden slumbers” is treated many times in 

Shakespeare, usually in conjunction with another 

, ^ 

familiar strain, the cares of monarchy. The sound sleep 


# **Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown” is a stock 
Elizabethan theme and Shakespeare is as fond of it as 
any of his contemporaries. It is reiterated time and 
again in the history playss 2Hen.VI.,4.9.102, ^Hen.VI .. 

2.2.49, 2.5.Iff.#,3.1.62; Rich.IIl, 1.4.78 . 3*7.223i

4.^.161? Hen.Y ..4.1.250ff.f. Hen.VlII ..2.3.19. 3*2.382. 

The passages marked with an asterisk combine the cares of

X27. 

kingship with the theme of sleep. T^e cares that attend 
greatness are contrasted with the content of the humble 
in Gym.,1.6.6-9. 


of the happy laborer is touched on in ;^Hen.VI . .2.5.49.5^. 
where the unfortunate king contrasts his lot with tha,t of 
the shepherd. Both themes are present in 2Hen.IU . but 
here sleep receives more emphasis.^ Hen.IV . has a long 
apostrophe to sleep: 


0 sleep, 0 gentle sleep, 

Nature*s soft nurse, how have I frighted thee, 
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down 
And steep my senses in forgetfulness? 

Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs 

Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee 

And hush’d with bussing night-flies to thy 

slimber. 

Than in the perfum’d chambers of the great. 
Under the canopies of costly state, 

And lull’d with sound of sweetest melody. 

(3.1.5) 

Hal echoes the idea when he sees his sleeping father 
( 2Hen*IV. .4.5.26). and as king in Hen.? ., adds another 
long variation on the theme (4.1.283)# More compressed, 
but vivid, is Belarius in Gym .i 

weariness 

Gan snore upon the flint, when resty sloth 
Finds the down pillow hard. (3.6.33) 

Here the idea of the cares of greatness gives place to 

’sloth’ but the fundamental thought is the same. Another 

striking expression of the idea occurs in MM . i 

As fast lockt up in sleep as guiltless labor 
When it lies starkly in a traveller’s bones 

(4.2.66) 















128. 

Sleep is thought of in Siiakespeare as heavy or 
leaden: IHen.IV ..3>1>217« 2Hen.IV ..3>l>7t Rich.III .. 
5*3«105f JC.,2.1.230, Cj2a»»2.2.31, Temp ..2.1.194. 
Brutus in JC., 4.3*267f seeing the boy Lucius asleep 
says, 

0 murderous slumber, 

Layst thou thy leaden mace upon my boy, 
That plays thee music? 

and in Macb . Banquo says; 

A heavy summons lies like lead upon me 
And yet I would not sleep. # (2.1.5) 


# This conception is not original with Shakespeare. 
Kittredge finds parallels for it in Spenser’s Faerie 
Queene . 1.4.44 and in f letcher* a Kni ^ ^ht of the Burning 
Pestle .3.1. !£•> ed» Kittredge, p.l77 


Another persistent association is the natural one 
of sleep and deaths MB. ,4.1.84, 2Hen.XV. .4.5»6l. Hen.V .. 
3.6.126, AYLI ..4.3.117-9. Cym ..2.2.31. 4.2.356, OT., 
5.3.18, Temp ..2.1.216. 260ff.,282, 4.I.I57. The 
association is strong in Maob s (2.2.53f 2.3.8I, 3.2.21,)^ 
sleep is ’death’s counterfeit* and Duncan, "after life’s 
fitful fever ...sleeps well.” In Hamlet’s soliloguy 
"To be or not to be" the comparison is extended: 

To die, ^ to sleep 5 - 

To sleepl perchance to dream: ay, there’s 

the rubj 

For in that sleep of death what dreams may 

come.«.♦. 

Must give us pause...* ( Ham* .3.1*65) 

Far less obvious is the connection in Shakespeare’s mind 

























, 129 . 

between drunken sleep and death. The lord in T^. coining 

upon the drunken Sly outside the tavern exci-aims: 

Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine - 
image] Ind.l. 35) 

in MM. Barnardine is said to apprehend of death 

No more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep. 

(MM..4.2.143) 

Then we have Lady Macbeth sayings 

when in swinish sleep 
Their drenched natures lie as in a death. 

1.7.67) 

It is a commonplace that sorrow, an unquiet mind, 

mental conflict, or a guilty conscience robs one of 

sleep, and nmny characters in Shakespeare suffer in this 

way: vide Rich. III . .1.4.76. 4.1.82ffi, 4.2.74, MNL .. 

3.2.84, RJ.,2.3.35, Rich. II. . 1.3.228. |Stt2.1.4,& , 

231ff. Hamlet expresses the dondition effectively: 

In my heart there was a kind of fighting 
That would not let me sleep. (g4M. ,5*2.4) 

Yet sleep is thought of as a comforter to sorrow in 

MNP ..3.2.43? and in the Temp . Sebastian sums the 

position up when he says: 

It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth 
It is a comforter. ( Temp ..2.1.19?) 

Perhaps the reason is only the growth of Shakespeare^s 

powers of expression, but in the tragedies the more or 

less conventional things like Bolingbroke*s ccmiplaints 

of inability to sleep are superceded by more vivid 

expressions of the terror of sleeplessness and the

longing for sleep. The fact that Othello’s peace of 
mind is forever shatteired by the doubt that lago has 
insinuated into his mind, is expressed by the latter in 
terms of sleeplessness} 


jffot poppy nor mandragora 
Kor all the drowsy syrups of the world, 

Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sle^p 
Which thou owedst yesterdcay. ( Qth. .3#3* 33 qT 

Sleep is an important motif in Maob # ine weird sisters 

introduce iti into their incantations in the haunting 

picture of the sailor denied sleeps 

Sleep shall neither night nor day 
Hang upon his penthouse lid; 

He shall live a man forbid: 

Weary se’n^ights nine times nine 
Shall he dwindle, speak and pine: etc, 

(1.2,19) 

This becomes a sort of symbol of the sleeplessness of 

Macbeth, In this play also we get Macbeth’s agonteid 

outburst in which all the conventional ideas we have 

been meeting about sleep are brought together and 

transfigured with dramatic life: 

Methought I heard a voice cry ’sleep no morel 
Macbeth does murder sleep,’ the innocent 

sleep. 

Sleep that knits up th^e rave 11’d sleeve of 

Care , 

The death of each day’s Iji^e , sore labor’s 

Balm of hurt minds , great nature’s secmd 

course. 

Chief nourisher in life’s feast, (2,2.35) 

# 


# The interest in sleep-walking in Macb. is evidenced in 

























131 * 

only one other place, in the Te^., 2 . 1 . 213 , and then 
only faintly. 

Lady Macbeth attributes Macbeth^s derangement to 
lack of sleep: 

You lack the season of all natures, sleep 

( Maob ..3.4.141) 

From the earliest plays Shakespeare was aware of the 

relation of sleep and madness, that sleep was the 

"balm of hurt minds*'. One of the causes of Antiphodus* 

madness, pointed out by the abbess in Gg. is that 

Adriana’s nagging troubled his rest. Kent in Lear 

realizes that sleep in Gloucester's farmhouse might 

have restored Lear’s mind^ and the fihal cure actualLy 

is affected by sleep: 

Our foster**nurse of nature is repose. 

The which he lacks: that to provoke in him. 
Are many simples operative, whose power 
Will close the eye of anguish.(Kh..4.4.12ff.) 

The other cure for madness is music. Before going any 

farther with the idea on sleep or madness, it would be 

well to look at some of those on music. 

2. Music . 

Shakespeare's sensitiveness to imsic, his 
tendency to compare unpleasant or evil things to 
discordant sound eind the relation of music to family 
and state have already been discussed. {Chapter 1.)* 
There are many indications of sensitiveness to false

metaphor for the failure of his revenge (Sth*,5*2«115). 

Richard II* while listening to music exclaimss 

Ha, Hal keep times how sour sweet music is

So is it in the music of men^s lives*

Richard’s rejection of the music in an unquiet mood 

(5*5t6i) is parallelled by Katherine in Hen*VIII ** 

4*2.94 where, in a sudden change of mood, she says the 

music she had desired is ♦’harsh and heavy^* to her*

The oweut ao nd of lovers♦ voices at ni^;ht is compared 


to soft music in M.,2.2.166. In MAAIi . the stillness 
of the evening is "as hushed on xmrpose to grace harmony 
(2,3.40)" and in TH. Viola tells Olivia if she were the 
duke and so scorned, she would huild a willov/ cabin at 
the gate^write "loyal cantons of contemned love" and 
"sing them loud even in the dead of night (1*5*290)"* 

This association of music and night does not seem to 
have been a conventional idea and probably is a personal 
taste of the poet^s* 

Music is traditionally associated with love? in 
Shakespeare it is the "food of love"* In Armado 

asks Moth to sing for "my spirit grov^rs heavy in love 
(1.2.117)" and in 3.1.Iff. he repeatsi "Warble, child* 
make passionate my sense 0’ hearing." hove is said to 
be 

rs sweet and musical 

As bright Apollo*s lute,,stnmg with his hair; 

And when Love i^peaks the voice of all the gods 

Make heaven drowsy with the hamony* 

(LLL*.4,3*341) 

The note is struck in the opening lines of TH* 1 

If music be the food of lovef play on etc. 

(jg., 1.1.1.) 

In Act 2 the IXike calls for the melancholy song which 
he says had previously relieved his passion more than 
gay ones, and Viola says* 

It ^ares a very echo to the seat 

Where love is throned. (JH. ,2.4.1-2)

Cleopatra echoes the Buke’s desire for melancholy music 
to suit her mood 

GiTe me some music; music, moody food 
Of us that trade in love. (AO. .2.5.1">2) 

Music is associated with melancholy as it is with 

love. Jaques speaks of ‘’the musician’s (melancholy) 

which is fantastical (ATM. ,4.1.11-12) . Jaques is told 

that hearing a song will make him melancholy (2.5,11) 

and he replies: 

I can suck melancholy out of a song as a 
, weasel sucks eggs, 

Jessica in MV, says: 

I am never merry when I hear sweet music, 

( 5 . 1 .^ 9 ) 

The notion that the melancholy produced hy music is 
pleasing appears in Sonnet 8 and in IgC.,4,1,10. On 
the oth^r hand the power of musdc to dispel melancholy 
appears in the song in HentVIXX ,,3,1,12 and in IHen.IV >, 
3*3*14. 

The traditional notion of the music of the spheres 

is not stressed in Shakespeare more than in most poets 

of the time. It is referred to in aV1>X »,2.7«5* MV., 

5.1.60, TH.,3.1.121, AG*,5*2.84, Tamn «$*l«2a9« hut only 

in OT. does it receive much elahorations 

There*s not the smallest orb which thou 

heholds*t

Still quiring to the young-eyed oheruhins; 
Such harmony is in immortal souls;

In many of the plays Shakespeare uses the device 

of having music from an invisiole source. The musicians, 

unless they were needed on stage, played in a gallery 

above, which might easily he closed off from the 

audience. Hhether the idea of spirit music or music 

produced hy magic appealed to Shakespeare, of whether 

the dramatic possibilities and effects to be achieved 

from this arrangement made him use it so often, is 

difficult to say. It is always used in connection with 

magic of some kind as in ffiD,, 4#1.84ff ♦ Glendower, in 

IHen.IV. «summons musicians from the air (3.1.226). One 

of the witches in Maob « 4*l*129-»30 ©ayst 

1*11 charm the air to give a sound, 

While you perform your antic round. 

The ingenious instrument of Belarius in Cym . in another 

variation of this device* In Peri *,^.l»223t the prince, 

having recovered his daughter, hears music in the air 

which the others do not hear and which he takes to be 

# 

the music of the spheres* Upon hearing the imisic. 


# In the absence of directions one must suppose the 
music is actually played from the gallery since it would 
be confusing to the audience to have none* 

Pericles falls asleep and has a vision similar to that 
of Posthumus in Cym » where there is also music as back¬ 
ground to a dream. Slightly different is the spirit

masic from un lor the staji^e in Kuch is made 

of the device of raiisic from invisible sources in the 

Temp ,. Usually Ariel, supposed to be invisible, sings 

and plays (1,2.375, 2.1.185, 2.1.300, 3.2,134.) casting 

various spells on the shipvrreoked men. In 3*2.144 

Caliban attempts to explain the phenomenon: 

The isle is full of noises, 

Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight 
and hurt not. 

Sometimes a thousand twangling Instruments 
Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes 
voices 

That, if I then had ?/ak;ed after long sleep, 
Will make me sleep again, and then, in 
dreaming. 

The clouds methought would open and show 
riches 

Ready to drop upon me, that, when I waked, 

I cried to dream again* 

Here we have invisible music, sleep, and the dream 
combined. 

The ability to sing and play an instrument was 

in Shakespeare’s day almost as essential a social 

f 

accomplishment as dancing is today. Appreciation of

music seems to have counted for much with Shakespeare. 

We find his opinion of the non-musical man expressed 
with some poetic exaggerdion in MY. in the famous 
passage, which, by the v/ay, has no dramatic Validity 
except to set the atmosphere of the seene and which is 



















137 * 

unarttnuitic in thnt ..orenzo, the speaker, nab jua^ atolen 

Jessica from her father; 

The man that hath no music in himself 
Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils; 
The motions of his spirit are dull as night. 
And his affections dark as Srebusi 
Let no such man bo trusted* (5.1.83} 

Shylock in the same play, certainly lias no music in 

his soul, sperks of the squeaking of the wry-necked 

fife (2.4.29-30) and the bag^plpe singing the nose 

(4.1.49)”. When Caesar expresses his distrust of 

Cassius as a dangerous malcontent (1*2,204-10) the fact 

that ’*he hears no music” is a detail of the portrait 

not derived from Plutarch. There are only two other 

# Shakespeare* s Plutarch. vol.,I,p,95* 

people in Shakespeare who express active dislike of 
music, and these are Benedick and Hotspur, both of whom 
profess to prefer the howling of a deg* With the former 
dislike of music may be part of a pose of rough 
unsentimental bluntness. Moreover it is not too clear 
in the passage ( kAAH .*2.3»6Qff») whether it is music in 
general Benedick grumbles at or the singing of Balthasar 
who himself disparages it. Previously in enumerating 
the qualities he would demand in a woman before he could 
love her, he says she would have to be "an excellent 
musician ( MAAB #*3*3>35)"# Besides Benedick is disgusted

v/itli Claudio for being in love and music is on., of the 
things he ascociatas, along v/ith effeminacy and affected 
mc'innerB, with the d6'>.lor:3.blo cJianRe in Clniidio. Hence 
his irritation has other causes than distaste for music 
as such, and does not necessarily indicate an unmusical 
nature. In Hotspur we have the some blunt soldier type. 
He too is not entirely insensitive to music for he 
approves of the spirit music summoned by CJlendower 
( IHen.IV. .3»1.23?)» Besides he is probably teasing 
Lady Percy a little here. Bit even if Hotspur were 
unmusical Lorenzo’s generalization would still hold^ for 
he is at the time engaged in a conspiracy against the 
state (as was Cassius), and hence is **fit for treasons”* 
Jaques in AYLX .» not it is true a conspirator, is 
(compact of jars*, bookish, a thinkerg and discontented 
cynic, and it is not surprising to find that he is not 
musical (2.5*11, 2.7.5)♦ olora in 0th . tells the 

musicians to stop playing because 

To hear music the general does not greatly 
, care {0th.,3.1.17) 

but this may refer only to the particular occasion, 

especially as the clown says the musicians play badly. 

Othello commends Besdemona for her skill in music 

(4*1.199) hence could not be insensitive to it. 

It would be going too far to say that Siiakespeare 

habitually connects inability to appreciate music with

Yillains and malcontents* There Is no rule in the 
matter. lago, for example, sings (0th. , 2 . 3,71) , but this 
type of song need not imply love of music. Autolycus 
is musical but he, like Falstaff, is not so much a 
villain as a privileged rogue. Thus, while he does not 
insist on the point, and while in many of his portraits 
of villains no mention of music is made, he does seem 
to associate lack of musical appreciation with people 
like Shylock, Cassius and Jaques, one of whom is a 
villain, one a conspirator and one a melancholiac. 

Shakespeare is fond of passages on the power 
of music over human action and over animals, lavinia 
In T.And .is said to have been able to sing so sweetly 
her ravisher had he heard, would have dropped his knife 
and fallen asleep (2.4.48). Besdemona is 

an admirable musician; 0, she will sing the 

savageness out of a bearI ( Qth ..4.1.199) 

There is a reference to the power of music in MV.. 
4.1.49-50 and in MAAH ..2.^.6l. In p|.,4.1.16 the duke 
comments on the power of music for good and evil. Most 
often the idea is related to Orpheus, as in the song 
Orpheus with his lute in Hen.VIII . in the passage 
cited from T.And .. in TGV.,3.2.78, and in MV.s 

therefore the poet 

Bid feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, 
and floods; 

Since naught so stockish, hard and full of 
rage.

the passage in IHen,IV ,,3>1>213: 


141 


She hids you on the wanton rushes lay you 

down 

And rest your gentle head upon her lap 
And she will sing the song that pleaseth you 
And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep, 
Charming your hlood with pleasing heaviness^ 

In £C.,4.3. Brutus has Lucius play, remarks, "This is a 

sleepy tune”, and Lucius falls asleep. Here the zmisic 

is partly used to set the atmosphere for the ensuing 

ghost scene. Nearly all scenes of sleep in Shakespeare 

have music. In Cym . Posthumus sleeps and ’solemn* music 

is played during the representation of his dream (5.4.29) 

In the Temp . Ariel plays ’solemn music’ to induce sleep 

in the King of Naples and his company (2.1.181). In 

the beautiful speech of Caliban beginning •The isle is 

full of noises’ we haves 

Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments 
Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes vd ices 
That, if I then had waked after long Bleep, 
Will make me sleep again. (3*^#1^6) 

Hen.vill . the music at least would seem to be 

Shakespeare’s for it fits in with his usage in other 

plays. Not only does the song bring in the favorite 

allusion to Orpheus but it has these linest 

In sweet music is such art. 

Killing care and grief of heart 

Fall asleep , or hearing, die (3.1.12) 

and in 4.2.80 Katherine hears music and then sleeps. In 

the scene in KL.,(4.7*) where lear is in a bed asleep 

music is played and made louder to waken him. A scene 















142, 

which bears many resemblances, scarcely accidental, to 

this scene in Lear , is the Induction to TS, where poor 

Sly is awaicehed out of a drunken sleep to the strains 

of soft music and persuaded he has been mad. It is 

pretended that Hermione in W. is brought back to life 

by music (5.3»9S)# an<l in Peri «,3*2,88 Thaisa is awakened 

from a swoon to the accompaniment of music. 

The healing power of music and also that of sleep 

is referred to in 2Hen,IV ,a4,l,lff, where the sick king 

asks for music as he is about to sleep, Bardin Craig 

has a note on this passage to the effect that •*the 

medical practice of the time attributed healing power 

to music”, Most often in Shakespeare the medicinal power 

of music has to do with mental sickness. In Peri * it is 

proposed that Marina cure Pericles of his grief-induced 

stupor by singing (5*1*45)> hut the cure is effected by 

other means, MusiCf like sleep, is ,one of the cures 

for madness, Richard II says music has "holp madmen to 

their wits ( Rich,II * *5*$*6l)**and in the tmm * * solemn 

music’ is used to restore the entranced King of Haples 

and his friends to their sensesi 

A solemn air, the best comforter 
To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains, 

Bow useless* boil’d within thy stoill* 

( 5 . 1 . 58 ) 

Music is used along with sleep to restore Lear and the 
supposedly mad Sly, 













143 * 

Madness, to Shakespeare is compared to discord 
in music in both Ham. and Lear , which are the most 
important of his treatments of madness. Claudius asks 
Rosenorantz and Guildenstem if they have found out from 
Hamlet 


Why he puts on this confusion, 
Grating so harshly all his days of quiet 
i/itli turbulent and dangerous lunacy. 




and Ophelia laments; 


Now I see that noble and most sovereign 

reason, 

Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune yid 

harsh . (3,1,156) 


Hamlet, defending his reason says; 

My pulse as yours, doth temperately keep time 
And makes as healthful music; it is not 

madness 

That I have uttered (3.4.140) 

Kent in gL. speaks of the king^ s lucid intervals as 

”his better tune (4.3.41)**, and Cordelia exclaims; 

Th* untuned and jarring senses, 0, wind up 
Of this child-changed father. # 


# It is important to see the relation here between 
Shakespeare's conception of the mind and that of the 
state. We have seen his comparison of the mind to a 
kingdom, and of mental disorder to civil war (Chapter 
Ilf we find him thinking of madness, i.e. 

chaos in the mental kingdom, in terms of discord in 
music, as he had thought of civil strife before. More- 
over, the sea and Wind and storm imagery comes up again 
in connection with madness. Hamlet is said to be? **mad 
as the sea and wind, when both contend^ Which is the 
mightier (4.1.7)**# Lear is "mad as the vext sea (4,4.2)** 
and refers to the tempest in his mind (3.4.12). As 
early as T.And . (3.1*223) the madness of the sea is 
















144 * 

associated with the winds raising the ocean "threat 
the welkin with his hig-swoln face" and drowning the 
earth* 


3 . Madness * 

Madness seems to hare fascinated Shakespeare# He 
has many treatments of it# He uses it for comedy, 
usually of mistaken identity, as in TH# # 

Counterfeit madness is referred to in TH.,4.2.123 and 
presented dramatically in such characters as j^mlet and 
3dgar. Shakespeare seems to he more interested in 
madness resulting from mental or emotional strain than 
in congenital insanity, though he portrays both* The 
acuteness of his understanding of the rarious degrees 
of madness is illustrated in the powerful scene in I^ar 
where he brings together the’natural,* the counterfeit 
madmn, and the old mad king* 

The popular treatment of madmen, that of binding 
them and confining them in a dark room, seems to hsxe 
made a deep impression on Shakespeare* Antipholus in 
CS. is so treated (5«1#245), Homed in gj* says he is 

Hot mad, but bound more than a madman is; 

Shut up in prison, kept without my food, 

Whipt and tormented, (1,2*55) 

The confining and binding of madmen is referred to 
also in MOT *. 4,2*114 and Ham* *4*1,17 and 4,3*2* In 
AYLI * Rosalind says that a lover being essentially mad 















145, 

deserves this treatment as much as a madman (3•2*420), 
which may or may not mean thf-t neither deserves it* 

If Siiakespeare had seriously regarded the treatment of 
madmen as cruel, it is unlikely he would use it as 
matter for Jeht in the punishment of Malvolio in TH * 

Nor was he disinclined to make comedy of the attempt 
of some to convince another he is mad in * the 
Induction to TS»* and 

Shakespeare’s descriptions of the development of 

madness are similar* fhe abbess in OB * attributes 

Antipholus supposed madness to the exasperation of 

Adriana’s nagging,loss of sleep, unquiet meals which 

produced bodily illness, a fever and finally melancholy 

Sweet recreation barred, what doth ensue 
But moody and dull melancholy. 

Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, 

And at her heels a huge infectious troop 
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life? 

In food, in sport and life^preserving rest * 

To be disturb’d would mad or man or beast. 

(C3.,5.l,68ff) 

Polonius explains Hamlet’s disorder in a similar 
passages 

(Hamlet) Fell into a sadness, then into 

a fast. 

Thence to a watch , thence into a weakness. 
Thence to a XlgE^ness, and********* 

Into the madness wherein now he raves 

( I|am* *2*2,147) 

Note that in both cases lack of sleep is an ixi^ortant 
factor in causing madness* Bodily weakness also precedes 
madness. The relation of melancholy to madness is 












146 


brought out also in the Ind. to the TS« 

Seeing so much sadness iiath congeal’d your 

blood, 

And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy # 

Therefore ihey tEought it gooE you hear a 

play, 

And frame your mind to mirth and merriment, 

Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens 

life. (TS.Ind*2.2,) 

Compare Hamlet whose melancholy is temporarily displaced 
by the arrival of the players. 

Madness and melancholy are both productive of 
strong imagination, sometimes of hallucination* The 
idea that the weakness of the body leaves the mind an 
easy prey to fantasies appears in ty*and the 
ghost in Hamlet says that ’conceit in weakest bodies 
strongest ®,'orks ( Ham *3»4*114) That great imagination 
is ’proper to madmen’ appears in 2Hen,IY *#X*_l»31* 

Recall the f^ous comparison in MMI) *,^*l*4ff* of the 
lunatic, the lover and the poet who are ’'of invagination 
all compact’# la the madman this takes the form of 
’heeing more devils than vast hell can hold”, femlet 
wonders whether the ghost may not be an hallucination 
produced by the devil ’’out of my weakness and my 
melancholy ( Ham* «2#2#631) ” and when Hamlet sees the 
ghost in his mother’s room the queen thinks he is mads 

This bodiless creation ecstasy 

Is very cunning in. 

One form this ’bodiless creation’ might take which seems 
to have caught Shakespeare’s imagination, is that of a

tries to restrain Hamlet from following the ghosts 

What if it tempt you toward the flood, my 

lord, 

Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff 
That beetles o’er his base into the sea, 

And there assume some horrible fom. 

And draw you into madness? Think of it 
The very place puts toys of desperation, 
ithout more motive, into every brain 
That looks so many fathoms to the sea 
And hears it roar beneath# ( Ham #,l#4#69ff)

Gloucester he has been led to the cliff at Dover by a

# There is an effect of particularity about this cliff

This and the power with which the dizzying effect of 
looking over a cliff into the sea it e^ressed and the 
feeling in Hamlet and Lear that looking down will draw 
one irresistibly over the edge, all this suggests 
actual experience# It is an attractive conjecture that 
Shakespeare may have been one of those people who when

Madnesa not only sharpens the imagination; it 

often gives an insight into truth denied the same mind: 

madmen have such seething brains* 

Such shaping fantasies* that apprehend 
Mora than cool reason ever comprehends* 

(l@rD*,$*l*4ff) 

polonius is struck by the •method* in Hamlet’s madness: 

How pregnant sometimes his replies aret A 
happiness that often madness hits on* which 
reason and sanity could not so prosperously 
be delivered of* ( Ham* *2*2*212) 

The same is remarked on in Ophelia (4*5*174* I 78 ). The 

notion finds repetition in g|*,5*l*6l* Edgar in KI« * 

recognizing the greatness of the ruined intellect 

behind Lear*s ravings, cries* 

0 matter and impertinency mix^d 
Reason in madnessl (gL,* 4 * 6 * 178 ) 

This idea allows Hamlet to conceal his acute comments 

under the cloak of madness and also allov/s Shakespeare 

in the ravings of Lear to introduce ideas which have 

actually no relation to the immediate situation but whidh 

give the effect of a great mind disordered,and which are 

fundamental in his own thought (see Chapter 1 )* 

The relation of madness and the fixed idea 


appears in Ham *: 

This something-settled matter in his heart* 
Whereon his brains still beating puts him

verbal similarities which suggest that Shakespeare 
recal ed the earlier scone v/hen writing Lear * (vide 
Chapter VIII. d. Zii). 

Groat grief is one of t.he chief causes of 

madness: see T*Ana *»3,2,24, 79? 4*1,18-21; Eich»II, « 

3*3,184; Ham * ,4,^';76; KL*, 3*4,170ff * Madness, on the 

other hand, is regarded o.s a release from ^rief, 

Constance wishes she were mad, 

For then * tie like I should forget myself; 

0, if I could, what grief should I forgets- 
Preach some philosophy to make me mad,,*, 

(S3;*>3.4.49) 

Gloucester, in Lear * feels the same things 

The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense, 
That I stemd up, and have ingenious feeling 
Of my huge sorrows* Bettei' I were distract: 
So should my thoughts be severed frcwa my 

griefs, 

And woes by wrong imaginations lose 
The knov-yledge of taemselves, 

(a.,4.6.286) 

We have seen that Shakespeare uses sleexj and music 
dramatically as cures of madness. The Abbess in Cl,* 
5,l,102ff,, claims to be able to cure Antipholus by 
♦wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers^ In 
when Cordelia asks, ♦*what can man’s wisdom In the 
restoring his bereaved sense? (4,4,8)” the doctor 
answers that certain medicinal herbs and chiefly sleep 
may cure him. But in Maob * we have a repetition of 
Cordelia’s question ^^hen l^cbeth, hearing that Lady 
Macbeth is «troubled v/ith thick-coming fancies, That

terrors of sleoplessness) criesj 

oure her of thatj 

Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased;

And with,soma sweet oblivious antidote 

Cleanse the stuft bosom of that i)erilouB 

stuff 

Which weighs upon the heart? 
and this time he is met with a negative answer,•• The 
patient must minister to himself* It would be interest¬ 
ing to know whether Shakespeare actually believed it was 
possible to cure madness by sleep, whether the exigencies 
of plot made him accept the convention, or whether this 
last passage represents his final opinion, changed since 
he wrote Lear * There is not, however, sufficient 
evidence to be conclusive* 

Melajicho ly , world - Wf^ariness * 

Suicide * 

Shakespeare* s treatments of melancholy, and ?/orld 
v/eariness, the longing for death and the problem of 
suicide,thoughiess consistent ana clear cut as a group 
than the ideas we have been dealing with, have definite 
relations to each other and show more development* 

These themes appear of course, in earlier plays, bat not 
with such graat insistence until about the time of the 












153 


middle comedies when Shakespeare’s interest in them 
seems to deepen. 

1. Melancholy . 

Some of the ideas on melancholy have been 
mentioned in connection with music and madness (pp. 

There was a fashionable cult of melancholy in Elizabethan 
times. People affected it for various reasons, love, or 
a pose of intellectualism, or for no reason at all. It 
was commonly affected by travellers. Lovers were 
conventionally melancholy (vide Gliapter If, p . Armacbo, 
fashionable in all things, is “besieged with sable- 
color’ d melancholy, ( LLL .. 1.1.230)% Young gentlemen in 
France “would be sad as night Only for wantonness ( KJ. . 
4.1.13)“. Falstaff ridicules this pose ( IHen.IV. .1.2.83) 
and so does the clown in AWf .. 3»2.3ff* Shake^eare 
smiles at it in his portraits of Olivia and the Luke in 
TN». In Rich.II . there is an evident interest in 
causeless melancholy* The queen ponders on her 
unreasonable sadness (2.2,30ff), and Richard’s enjoyment 
of self-indulged melancholy shows a deepening understand¬ 
ing of the psrychology of the mood. About the same time 
Shakespeare had written a passage in KJ. where John 
contrasts the melancholy and the merry types 

Or if that surly spirit, melancholy, 

Had baked thy blood, and made it heavy thick, 

Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,

li(.alcing that idiot laughter, keep men’s eyes, 
And stain their cheeks to idle merriment,- 
A passion hateful to my purpose (i.e.murder) 

(3.3.42ff.) 

The melancholy type is evidently regarded as more apt 

to deeds like murder. In this connection it should be 

noted that Don John in MAAH , is of a melancholy 

disposition (l,3.11ff.» 2,1,5) so is Cassius 

(JD,,l,2,193ff). The MV, is shot through with the theme 

of melancholy and its cause. One of Portia’s suitors 

is a melancholiac, who ’doth nothing but frown (1,2*50)” 

Antonio is another of these victims of causeless 

melancholy. He cannot explain its 

In sooth, I know not why I am so sads 
It wearies mej you say it wearies you? 

But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, 
What stuff ’tis made of, whereof it is born, 

I am to learn$ 

And such a want-wit sadness makes of me. 

That I have much ado to know myself, 

{g£*,1*1.1,ff) 

So Hamlet is unable to explain the paralyzing melancholy 

which grips him and Posthumus in Cym * is sad ’’oft-times 

not knowing why (1,6,61)”, Various explanations are 

offered by Antonio’s friendsj he is worried over his 

ships, he is in love, finally they conclude he is sad 

because he is not merry: 

nature hath framed strange fellows in her 

times 

Some that will evermore peep through their 

eyes 

And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper, 

And others of such vinegar aspect 
That they’ll not show their teeth in way 

of smile, 








155 . 

Though Nestor swear the Jest be laughable. 

(OT.,1.1.50) 

Salarilp here evidently regards melancholy as a ’humor*. 
Gratiano asks 

fJhy should a man, whose blood is warm within, 
Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? 

Sleep when he wakes and creep into a Jaundice 
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio, 
There are a sort of men whose visages 
Do cream and mantle like a standing pool, 

And do a wilful stillness entertain 
With purpose to be dress’d in an opinion 
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit*•••. 

I do know of these 
That therefore only are reputed wise* 

Antony’s melancholy may be intended as a premonition 
of disaster, but it is not carried through consistently 
in his dealings with Shylock and it has bery little 
influence on the action. This long discussion of the 
nature and causes of melancholy is not very dramatic 
and seems out of proportion to the importance of the 
theme of melancholy in the dramas Shakespeare is 
observing the type, seeking an explanation but as yet 
not going very deep psychologically* He seems to have 
been interested in the contrast between this type and 
the constitutionally merry man, like the one described 
by Gratiano in W* or like Gratiano himself who is 
contrasted with Antonio (1.1.79)* As early as 01 . 
there is a hint of such a contrast in the two Antipholi, 
one of whom is a **merry man (Cl.,other 
melancholy (Cl., 1*2*20) but not maoh is jsade of it there 









156 . 

Both Beatrice and Benedick are of the merry type ( MAAN ,. 

2.1.343, 2.1.355t 3«2.9i* The merry man, Mercutio, 

Gratiano. Berowne, Benedicjc, is always a great talker 

«bom to speak all mirth and no matter ( MAAN . t2.1.34»3)”» 

In AYLI . the interest in melancholy continues in the 

portrait of Jaaues. There is a discussion of melancholy 

between Jaaues and Rosalind in which Jaques comes off 

second best. Rosalindas comment on the two humors, the 

merry and the sad, is sharp i 

These that are in extremity of either are 
abominable fellows and betray themselves to 
every modern censure worse than drunkards. 

( AYLI .. 4.1.5-7) 

Olivia in TO. suggests that ’*sad and merry madness imay) 

equal be (3*^*14')”# Jaques dilates on the various types 

of melancholy, the scholar*s, the lover^s, the lady’s, 

etc., but maintains that his is individual, compounded 

of his own materials, especially his travels, but 

Rosalind ridicules him. His melancholy is still something 

of a pose. All this coming before Shakespeare’s 

portrayal of melancholy as a disease of the mind in 

Hamlet, shows how an idea which interests him is 

reiterated and developed long before he is ready to use 

it as the mainstay of a serious study. G.B.Harrison 

says of Shakespeare’s interest in melancholys 

Whether in the plays of his middle period he 
is expressing his own melancholy or simply 
holding the mirror up to his own times is 
for individual critics to decide; but he

certainly kept pace with the prevailing 
mood. In 1594- he reacted lightly; when 
he came to write As you Like It melancholy 
was still a Joke, but the lau^ter was 
uneasy; two years later when he wrote 

Hamlet it was a reality... 

Hamlet in his solemn black is the fullest 
embodiment of the melancholic humor in all 
Elizabethan literature, and the picture is 
painted with such close attention to detail 
that it gives the impression that Shakespeare 
had made a text book study of the disease.

jjieIancholike Humors (London, the Scholartis press, 

1929 ) p. 73 . w. 


2. ^orld Weariness and Desire for Death . 

Ham , is the play most strongly associated with 
world-weariness and longing for death. It is coi^mionly 
said that Elizabethan literature is full of vigor and 
the joy of life and yet it is curious how few expressions 
there are of such a mood in Shakespeare, There is a 
little of the sense of the shortness of life ( iHen.IV .. 
5 . 2 , 82 , AYM., 3 . 2 , 137 ) and of the oarpe diem mood, 
especially in the songs like »It was a lover and his 
lass* and *0 mistress mine*, and in one passage in TH.. 
(2.4,39^^*) where we get the conventional comparison of 
beauty to roses# Shakespeare is more aware of the 
sadness implied in the carpe diem mood, and less of its 
joyousness such as you find in Herrick and the Cavaliers. 
Most often Shakespeare*s characters dwell on the burden

of life: 


Life is as tedious as a twice-told ta 
Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man, 

4nd bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet 

world's taste. 

That it yields naught but shame and 

bitterness. (Ig,, 3,4.lo8) 

This undramatic speech which squares with nothing else 
in the character of Louis in foreshadows Macbeth's 
'Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow'. We get life¬ 
weariness in Romeo (^#,5*^*62, 5*3*3.11-2)^ in Gaunt, 
( Rich.II ..2.1.137) in Portia (Ig.,1.2.1.)^ and in the 
melancholy Antonio (MV.,4.1.114ff, 263ff}, in Orlando 
( AYLl ..l.2.2Q0ff). Cassius {£C,,4.3.95) and Timon 
( 4 . 3 . 377 ), Coriolanus { Cori ..4»5»100) and Imogen 
(Cym.,3*6,1). In most of these oases there is a 
dramatic reason for the mood. In Portia it is probably 
due to boredom. It is associated with the melancholy 
disposition of Antonio and appears more strongly in the 
melancholy Hamlet. 

How weary, state, flat and unprofitable, 

Seem to me all the uses of this worldj 

(Ham.. 1 . 2 . 133 ) 

This goodly frame, the earth, seems to me a 
sterile promontory, etc. ( Ham* *2.2.310) 

The most oomi^lete expression of frustration and futility 

is Macbeth'ss 

Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. 

Creeps in this petty pace from day to day 
To the last syllable of recorded time, 

And all our yesterdays hare lighted fools

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief 

candlet 

Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player. 

That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, 
And then is heard no more. It is a tale 
Told by an idfot, full of sound and fury, 
Signifying nothing. ( Maob ..5.5*19) 

It is not necessary to assume, however, that because 

Shakespeare, in line with the current fashion, portrays 

melancholy characters like Antonio, J'aques and Hamlet 

who naturally display this mood, or because he puts a 

supreme expression of it in the mouth of the 

# 

d.Uiillusioned regicide Macbeth that it indicates 

# See R.W.Chambers, Qp . oit .tP>26Q*>X 
A.C.Bradley, Op .cit..p.3$9 

personal feeling. His interest in melancholy may be 
purely dramatic. If personal it is no stronger than that 
of his contemporaries* 

Death is often courted in Shakespeare as a release 

from the ills of life. In the history plays various 

characters desire deathi IHen»VI ».2»5«28. 2Hen.¥I ..2.4.89 

•^Ken.Vl ..2.^.19. M.,3.4.25, 2,1.164, Hioh.lI ..2.1.l5l 

the reflection that anyone who weighs the ills of life 

would be content to die appears first in 2Hen«IV * * ^.1»45ff 

unless we consider the apothecary scene in R£. (which 

is hardly essential to the plot) where Romeo saysj 

Are xnou so Dare and full of wretchedness 
'nd fearst to die? (EJ.,5.1.68)

So far there is nothing which might not be dramatic 
nor is there any thinK essentially undramatio in Hamlet’s 
famous Boliloauy ’To be or not to be* * Hamlet is a 
philosopher and it is natural enough that he should be 
pondering general truths^ However he need not discuss 
this particular subject in these particular terms* IK . 
fact it is unlikely that he would contemplate suicide 
at this point when he is engaged in planning the play 
for the evening, and iias something exciting and probably 
illuminating to look forward to. The long list of evils: 

The whips and scorns of time, 

The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s 

contumely, 

The pangs of disprized lovd, the law’s delay, 
The insolence of office and the spurns 
That patient merit of the unworthy takes, 

(Ham**^*l*7Qff) 

after all bears little relation to Hamlet’s own^problems 

but does strongly resemble Sonnet 66 t 

Tired with all these, for restful death I 

cry: 

As to behold desert a beggar boiti, 

And needy nothing trimm’d in jollity, 

, And purest faith unJmppily forsworn. 

And gilded honor shamefully misplaced. 

And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted, 

And right perfection wrongfully disgrac’d 
And strength by limping sway disabled, 

And art made tongue-tied by authority, 

And folly-doctor-like-controlling skill, 

And simple truth miscall’d simplicity 
And captive good attending captain ill* 

One might of course argue that the sonnets are not 

expressive of personal feeling but there is more

Shakespeare. There is at least no dramatic reason for 
the expression or ir in a sonnet. 

The old Duke in seeking to reconcile Claudius 

to death expatiates on the vanity of life (MM#* ^.1.^)* 
but this is dramatic and is balanced by Claudius’ 
ddscription of the horrors of the after-life, not, it 
is significant, by an assertion of the sweetness of 
life itself. 

The question of why men should fear death begins 

to be prominent in jrc. i 

Cowards die many times before their death. 

The valiant never taste of death but once. 

Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,

shorter life, the fewer years of fearing death (JC., 
3.1.99), This may be an attempt to give a flavor of 
Roman philosoph;/ to the play, however the thought is 
reproduced without this purpose, in^.; 

Isabella - The sense of death la most in apprehension; 

■Duke - That lifd is better life, past fearing death 
Than that which lives tio fear* 

On the other hand we have al:jO two passages in which 
fear of the unknown, the "dread of something after 
death . The undiscovered country from whose bourne no 
traveller returns” is weighed against the ills of life. 
The first is Hamlet»s soliloquy (|to.,3*1*55)i other 
^.,3.1.116 : 


Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; 

To lie in cold obstruction and to rot; 

This sensible warm motion to become 
A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit 
To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside 
In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice; 

To be imprison’d in the viewless winds, 

And blown with restless violence round about 
The pendent world; or to be worse than worst 
Of those that lawless and incertain thoughts 
Imagine howling; tis too horrible! 

The weariest and most loathed worldly life 
That age, ache, penury, and imprisonment 
Can lay on nature, is a paradise 
To what we fear of death. 

Compare with this the ghost’s description of the after 
life in Ham ., 1*5*13^*^** which however refers to 
purgatory^ 3 :nd ^g.

3* Suicide * 

Likewise beginning in JC. is a discussion of 
discussion of suicide which seems to grow out of 


Shakespeare’s interest in melancholy and the world- 

weariness mood* Cassius boasts that he can deliver 

himself from bondage by suicide (1*3*96)* When he 

questions Brutus on the subject the Matter replies: 

I do find it cowardly and vile, 

Fur fear of what might fall, so to prevent 
The time of life: arming myself with patience 
To stay the providence of some higher powers 
That govern us below* (£C*,5*1*104) 

In Plutarch Brutus then admits this was his former 

opinion but he has now changed his mind and, if the 

battle goes wrong^^he will *rid (him) of this miserable 

# 

worldl” In Shakespeare he is more vague and the idea of 


Shakespeare’s Plutarch, vol. I, p#106* 


unwillingness to be led in triumph as the alternative to 

U IrcJl !s 

suicide is added to Plutarch, possibly suggested by AO . 

Later Brutus says; 

Our enemies have beat us to the pit 
It is more worthy to leap in ourselves 
Than tarry till they push us* {5*5*23) 

In the other Roman play, AC* Cleopatra echoes this; 

then is it a sin 

To rush into the secret house of death 
Bre death dare come to us? (AG,*4»15*8 q) 

Both she and Anthony prefer suicide to the dishonor of 

being led in triumph (4.14*72, 4*15*22, 5*2.208)

Cleopatra regards suicide as noble and specifically 
Roman: 


and then, what’s brave, what’s noble, 
Lets do it in the high Homan fashion. 

And make death proud to take us. 

(^.,4.15.86) 

The idea that the hero by committing suicide has not 

been defeated but has overcome himself appears in both 

JC.,5.5»56 and AC.,4.15.14, 55* The suicide scene, 

where the slave is requested to hold the sword while 

his master runs on it, is very similar in both plays 

(JC.,5«3* and 4.14* See also JC.. 5* ?*?1) 4 

Shakespeare evidently associated this attitude to 

suicide with the Roman plays* Horatio, intending to 

fdllow Hamlet in death, says: 

I am more an antique Homan than a Lane. 

( Ham. . 5*2. ^52) 

and Macbeth asks: 

Why should I play the Roman fool, and die 
On mine own sword? ( Macb ..5»2.1*2) 

The problem of suicide continues prominently in 

Ham * Hamlet, deterred only by the religious ban, 

wishes: 

That the Everlasting had not fix’d 
His canon ’gainst self-slaughter! 

(Ham*.1.2.Ill) 

A feeling which Imogen echoes, 

’gainst self-slaughter 
There is a prohibition so divine 







16? 


That cravens my weak hand. ( Cym. .3*4.77) 
Weariness of the ills of life pusteaone toward suicide, 
but religious reasons, and the fear of the unknown - 
* in that sleep of death, what dreams may come’ -» deter 
one* Roderigo in 0th * believes that to live in torment 
is folly, and suicide justified, but lago is contemptuous 
of such weakness ( Qth *,1*3* ^09)♦ The discussion is 
renewal' in Lear in the sub plot, without much relation 
to the main dramatic issues. Gloucester, unable to 
endure his griefs longer without quarrelling with the 
gods, decides to commit suicide (^*5*3^) there 
follow sdgar*3 arguments against it and Gloucester’s own 
thoughts on the subject. In 4*5*61 he exclaimsj 

Is wretchedness deprived that benefit 

To end itself by death? ’Twas yet some 
comfort 

v^hen misery could beguile the tyrant’s 

rage, 

And frustrate his proud will*.**. 

(which is like Cassius’ idea of delivering himself from 
tyranny by suicide)* 

Inl *75 Gloucester is resolved tos 

bear 

Affliction till it do cry out itself 

’Enough, enoughl and die. 

This resolve is repeated in 4.6*221 and the same idea of 
bearing life’s afflictions with patience is behind 
Edgar* s: 

Men must endure 

Their going hence, even as their coming hither 









166 

Ripeness is all, (5*2#9) 

Maobeth too resolves to fight the course rather than 
die on his own sword, (Mach.,5*7•1*2) 

All this is very inconclusive, but it is likely 
that the glorification of suicide in and the idea 
that suicide is the only honorable course for the 
vanquished is due to the Roman back^ground of JC, and 
£5,rather than to Shakespeare*s connection, Boderigo^s 
attitude is dramatic since he is characterized as weak. 
The hesitation in Ham ,, and the discussion in Lear 
taken in conjunction with the reiterated theme of world 
weariness probably represent the outcome of the mood 
which produced **Tired with all these for restful death 
I cry (Sonnet 66)**, But there are too many conflicting 
opinions expressed for one to be able to say with any 
certainty whether Shakespeare regarded suicide as 
weakness or not* 

3* Pastoralism , Hature and Mankind , Misfortune etc . 

The third group of interrelated ideas has its 
starting point in AYLI * and links with it KL., T,Ath , 
and Gym , In these plays particularly pastoralism or 
the deeper idea that nature is kinder than men is 
associated with the themes of ingratitude, the flattery 
of courts, and the idea that misfortune brings self

0 this life 

Is nobler than attending for a check 
Richer than doing nothing for a bribe. 

Prouder the.n rustling in unpaid-for silk, 

Such gain the cap of him that makes ’em fine. 
Yet keeps his book uncrost: no life to ours. 

When the boys protest, he answers: 

Bid you but know the city’s usuries. 

And felt them knowingly: the art O’the court 
As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb 
Is certain falling, or so slippery that 
The fear’s as bad as falling* ( Gym* * ^*^*21ff) 

Conventional pastoralism in the sense of the 

j idealization of country life is not strong in Shakespeare|^ 

j It develops into the opposition of man’s unkindness, 

I 

flattery, ingratitude, envy, to the figor of the elements 
which is preferable: 

Are not these woods 

More free from peril than the envious court? 
Here feel we "^t the penalty of Adam, 

The seasons’ difference, as the icy fang 
And churlish chiding of the winter’s wind. 

Which when it bites and blows up<»i my body. 

Even till I shrink with cold, I smile, and say 
This is no flattery * these are counsellors 
That feelingly persuade me what I^ am. 

*" * 2 * X») 

Under the Greenwood Tree repeats the idea and it is even 
stronger in 

Blow, blow, thou winter wind 
Thou art not so unkind 
AS man’s ingratitude * 

Thy tooth is not so keen 
Because thou art not seen 

Although thy breath be lude* ( AYLX **2*7*174) 
The echo comes in KL: 





















1 . 69 . 

I tax not you, you elements, with unkindnesa, 

I nerer gave you kingdom, called you children, 

,3.2.17) 


and 


rather I abjure all roofs and choose 
To wage against the enmity 6* the air; 

To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,- 
Necessity's sharp pinch (KL.,2.4,211) 

Again in T,Ath ,; 

Timon will to the woods; where he shall find 
The unkindest beast more kinder than msucikind, 

( T,Ath ,4,1.35) 

The ingratitudr theme is most insistent in Lear 
(see Chap.TL, p, iil^X it comes into ”Blow 

Blow thou inter Wind** along with the other ideas 
although it has no relation to the main themes of the 
play. The Buke^s realisation in AYLJ,. that misfortune, 
symbolized by exposure to the elemental brings self 
knowledge (2.1*10) is dramatically, presented in Lear’s 
regeneration during the storm and in Timon . There are 
many parallels between AYLI. and KL*# besides those 


# e.g, 
AYLI,, 


AYLI ..2.68. KL*»^*6.43: AYLI ..2.1.12. SL,,3,2.70: 

I73756ff., Kii.,2.4.66ff,77F4., 79* 


noted above. 

Though all the ideas in this group are not present 
in all the related plays, the association is strong 
enough that the introduction of one tends to call the 
others to mind. These apparently related plays, AYLI .. 
KL.t and T.Ath . also contain the strongest and most 




















170 


frequent recurrences of an idea which seems to he 
associated in Shakespeare’s mind with the other ideas 
in the group, that is, th^ wisdom of fools* Though there 
is no logical connection between this thought and the 
others in the group, it always appears in conjunction 
with them* 

Shakespeare’a early clowns are sometimes dull, 
and sometimes witty in the punning sense, but Touchstone 
is the first of his wise fools. It is only with the 
middle comedies that we begin to find expressions of 
the idea that wisdom may be found in the mouth of the 
fool, that the fool, like the madman, may know more 
than the sane and wise* In XtLL * there is the reflection 
that a wise man turned fool is worse than a bom fool, 
for he uses his wit to confirm him in folly ( 5 *^* 69 ff). 
The first indications of Shakespeare’s feeling that the 
fools may be worth more than the wise appears in IIAAH .> 
where Dogberry and his companions uncover Don John’s 
plot; 

f/hat your wisdoms could not discover. 

These shallow fools have brought to light 

{5*1*244) 

Here the fools for the first time are integrated in the 
plot and play an important part in the denouement* The 
theme becomes strong in AYU, and is exemplified in 


Touchstone 







If 


171 


The more pity that fools may hot speak wisely 
what wise men do foolishly.•••.Since the 
little wit that fools have was silenced, the 
little foolery that wise men have makes a 
great show. ( AYLl ..1.2.92) 

for always the dulness of the fool is the 
whetstone of the wits. (1.2.58) 

Jaques is much taken with Touchstone and resolves to 

adopt his motley: 

My lungs begin to crow like chanticleer, 

That fools should be so deep comtemplative. 

0 noble fooll 

A v/orthy foolt Motley’s the only wear. 

and in his brain, 

Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit 
After a voyage, he hath strange places 

cramm* d 

With observation, the which he vents 
In mangled forms* G that I were a fooll 
I am ambitious for a motley coat. 

(2.7.30) 

The wise man’s folly is anatomised 
Even by the squandering glances of the fool.,* 
.give me leave 

To speak my mind, and I will through and 

through 

Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,

{ 2 . 7 * 55 «) 

(see also AYhI.,3*3*32) The Duke has an admirable comment 
on Touchstone’s part in the drama and on others of 
Shakespeare’s fools. 

He uses his folly like a stalking horse and 
under the presentation of that he shoots his 
wit. (5.4.111) 

The clown in TH. is no fool either: 

Those wits that think they have thee (wit), 
do very ©ft prove fools; and I that am sure

I lack thee, may pass for a wise ma,n: for 
what says quinapulus? 'Better a witty fool 
than a foolish witl* (33i* t 3^) - 

(Compare TN,,1,5«62) Viola comments on the clowns 

This fellow is wise enough to play the fool; 
And to do that well craves a kind of wits 
He must observe their mood on whom he jests, 
The quality of persons, and the time*...*** 

.•*«.****this is a practice 

AS full of labor as the wise man's arts 
For folly that he wisely shows is fit; 

But wise men, folly^fall'n, quite taint their 

wit, (3.1.67) 

In Lear Ghis-kespeare brings this conception of the fool 
to its highest point* The fool here is not a mere 
professional jester dressing an observant and critical 
mind in a motley coat, yet not a fool in the sense of 
being deficient. Kent underlines the point; 

This l8 not altogether fool, my lord* 

(KI.., 1,4.165) 


and the fool retorts; 

Mo, faith, Inrds and great men will not let 
me; if I had a monopoly out, they would have 
part on'ti and ladies too, They will not 
let me have all the fool to myself; they'll 
be snkt chTng * (1*4.166) 

The Fool himself is anxious to point the seriousness of 

his jingles; 

If I speak like myself in this, let him be 
whipped that first finds it so. 

(1.4.178) 

Having found the strongest presentations of this theme 
in AYLI » and Lear it is not surprising to find an echo 
of it in T.Ath.;

Servant- Thou art not altogether a fool. 

^?ool . - Hor thou altogether a wise mans as muon 

foolery as I have, so much wit thou lack’at. 

( T.Ath ..2.2.117) 

This is another instance of the way in which AY1>I ., 

Lear , and Timon are bound together by the association 
of this pcroun of ideas which are so related that one 
inevitably brings the others with it, 

J’ools were allowed much libei*ty in their jibes* 
Jaques in taking motley would demand all the liberties 
of his calling; 

I must have liberty 

Withal, as large a charter as the wind 
To blow on whom I oleAsei for so fools have, 

{ Am ,, 2,7,47) 

and none con protest, for if they do, they show themselves 
vulnerable to his attack, Olivia reiterates the notion 
that 

There is no slander in an allowed fool, 
thougii he do nothing but x’all, 

(2a*ii*5«ioi) 

Lear’s Fool is frequently threatened with whipping and 
incurs Goneril’s wrath for his freedom, 

Shakespeare’s earlier clowns aisd fools are chiefly 
punsters whose humor consists in word play, or dunces 
like Costard, Launce, Dogberry etc. Later we can detect 
evidences of impatience wi th this punning and mistaken 
use of words which had been the mainstay of many comic 
scenes, Lorenzo in W.’suffering from the vice of

Eejiilst is both amused and impatient with the grave

Mow absolute the knave isI we must speak by

( Ham .. 5>* 1.148) 

Shakespeare does not drop the quibbling fool entirely 
but he does, in Touchstone, Feste and the Fool in Lear 
go far beyond this early conception to develop the fool 
as a witty and penetrating commentator on the action of 
the play. We know from Ham . 3.2.42 that he disliked the 
liberties taken by fools with their lines and he may, 
in writing a definite part for the fool be trying to 
eliminate this difficulty and at the same time use the 
fool who v/as an established convention, in a more telling 
way, as an integral part of his drama.

Shakespeare’s ideas on music and sleep are 
consistent throu^ihout the plays and do not show much 
sign of change or development. They are expressed less 
conventionally and introduced more drnma.tically as the 
plays progress hut they remain substantially the same, 

The most constant association is that between music and 
sleep. His treatment of madness seems to follow the 
conventional Elizabethen ideas biit his interest deepens 
as does his power to portray various degrees of madness. 
The interest in melancholy and meditation on death and 
suicide seems to be in line with the prevailing mood of 
the times, a manifestation of that general depression 
which overtook the late Elizabethan age. The reason for 
the association in the third group is less obvious and 
seems to have been individual with Shakespeare. It 
begins about the same time as the deeper interest in 
melancholy but differs from the other groups in being 
found mainly in four plays. The fact that the connection 
betv^een the ideas in the group is net a logical one 
suggests that it is the result of some personal experience 
which involved those ideas.

JHAPTER IV. 

LOVE AHO FRIENDSHIP 

Sinoe the riTal claims of love and friendship 
constitute an important theme in Renaissance literature, 
and since Shakespeare has at least two plays, TGV .. 
and MV. in which this theme hulks large, as well as 
others where it is introduced in minor incidents, it 
is natural and convenient to discuss his treatment of 
love and friendship together. Moreover the ideas of 
these two relationships have this in oommon, that they 
are to a very large extent colored by conventional 
Elizabethan thought. 

A# Love* 

The typical lover of the sonnets, 

(X/ 

Sighing like ;vfurnace, with a woeful ballad 
Made to his mistress eyebrow.•.•••• • 

( AVLI ..2.7.147) 

is often met with particularly in the earlier plays. 

In TGV. we have Speed’s enumeration of the marks of a 
lover; 

first, you have learned.....to wreathe your 
arms, like a malcontent; to relish a love 
song, like a robin-redbreast; to walk alone, 











177 


like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, 
like a schoolboy that had lost his ABC; to 
weep, like a young wench that had buried her 
grandam; to fast, like one that takes diet; 
to watch, like one that fears robbing; to 
apeak puling like a beggar at Hallowmas. 

( 2 . 1 .l 9 ff) 

Moth in LLL . gives an amusing description of the lover^s 
singing ( 3 .1.10). Romeo is the conventional lover, 
sighing alone in the early morning, shunning his friends 
melancholy.- 

RomeoI humoral madmanl passionl loverI 
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh; 

Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied; 

Cry but •»Ay meI* pronounee but ’love’ and 
’dove’ (HJ*» 2 . 1 . 7 ) 

Rosalind gives her version of the marks of a lover; 

A lean cheek.*.#a blue eye and sunken..., 
an unquestionable spirit,.....a beard 
neglected,.....then your hose should be 
ungartered, your bonnet unbanded, your 
sleeve unbutton’d, your shoe untied, and 
everything about you demonstrating a 
careless desolation; ( AYLI ..3.2.392) 

Sylvius also knows what it means to be in loves 

It is to be all made of sighs and tears,., 

..all made of faith and service, 

...........all made of fantasy. 

All adoration, duty and observance, etc. 

( Aia.I ..5.2.Q) 


Sighs, tears and groans consume the Duke in TH.(1.5.2741 

He himself remarks on the moodiness of lovers; 

For such as I am all true lovers are, 

Unstaid and skittish in all motion else. 

Save in the constant image of the creature 
That is beloved. £H.,2,4.17) 

and the clown commends him to the (taelancholy god’s

protection (2.4,75)• The conventional lover is not, 

however, confined to the romantic comedies. Into 

Ophelia’s chamber burst Hamlet,- 

with his doublet all unbraced; 

No hat upon his head; his Btockir^p foul’d. 
Ungarter’d and down-gyved to his ancle; 

Pale as his shirt; his loiees imocking each 
other; ( Ham* «2.1.78) 

This, like Rosalind’s portrait, is a description of a 
lover who has really gone beyond the lute and sonnet 
stage and shows signs of love madness* 

The lover’s melancholy was a recognized disease,# 

#Harrison, . Basay on Bligabethan Melancholy .** p* 

6 lff. 

n 

‘ **As melancholy as a lover’s lute** ( Hen.IV *. 1*2*84) seems 
to have been proverbial. The lovers in LLL .. Valentine 
in TGV .fand Romeo all betray symptoms of love melancholy. 
Only the advanced stage of the disease apparently 
produced personal neglect, for in MAAH . Don Pedro and 
his friends decide Benedick is in love because he has 
shaved his beard and “brushes his hat o’mornings (3*2,12)’ 
but the greatest note of it is his melancholy (3*2*53)• 
All Benedick’s Jesting is *^crept into a lute-string, and 
now governed by stops ( MAAB *. 3.2.61.). ** Orlando is 
regarded as representative of this type of melancholy 
and contrasted with the melsincholy Jaques, who indulges 
a brand of his own* Melancholy is closely related to

madness^ and love melancholy might develop into madness. 

There is a constant association of love and madness,- 

see LLL .,4.3>6. and MND .t 

iiovers ama madmen have such seething Wains, 
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend 
l/*ore than cool reason ever comprehends# 

( 5 . 1 . 14 ) 

Romeo is referred to as a madman (2.1.6),. and he himself 

says he is not mad, hut, being in love, tormented more 

than a madman is (RJ.,1.2.55). Rosalind in AYI4 # saysi 

Love is merely a madness, and I tell you, 
deserves as well a dark house and a whip as 
madmen do; and the reason why they are not 
so punished and cured is, tha.t the lunacy is 
so ordinary that the whippers are in love 
too. (3.2.420) 

See also AYLI .,4#X#2l8. That the **mad humor of love** 

might be goaded into »*a living humor of madness” is 

ilrou^ 2 ;ht out in ATLI # # 3*2.438# and Hamlet»s symptoms of 

madness are confidently attributed by polonius to lovei 

This is the very ecstasy of love. 

Whose violent property fordoes itself 

And leads the will to desperate undertakings 

As often as any passion under heaven 

That does afflict our natures# ( Ham ##2.1.102# 

The correct lover added to his melancholy and 

disordered state a propensity to overflow in sonnets 

and other verses# The rhyming of lovers is often 

ridiculed. In X»LL . the three lovers immediately turn out 

poems on their respective ladies, eind Armado exclaimss 

Assist me some extemporal god of rime, for 
I am sure I shall turn sonnet. ( LLL ##1.2.192)

l3o* 

Berowne’s passion teaches him "to rime, and to be 

mallicholy (4,3«13)”* Romeo’s rhymes are scoffed at 

(RJ.,2.1.9ff) and Orlando’s also (^YLI., 3 . 2 . 92 ). In 

AYLI .> 3 > 3«19 we hear that "lovers are given to poetry"* 

On the other hand there is distrust of the 

eloquent lover in TGV «,1.2.29*32, 2.2*17« Many lovers, 

like Benedick ( mAAH ., 5.2*3Qff.) disclaim the ability to 

rhyme and "woo in festival terms", petruchio in TS . 

is a blunt, unceremonious wooer whose manner of wooing» 

as well as the name of his lady, is the same as Henry V’e 

As bluff King Henry puts it, 

These fellows of infinite tongue, that can 
rhyme themselves into ladies’ favors, they 
do always reason themselves out again. 

( HentY. .^.2.l64) 

Hamlet is "ill at these numbers (Ham*,2*2.120)"• Yet 
it would be straining a point to say this is Shakespeare’s 
View, since Henry V. and Benedick at least are^ the bluff, 
unsentimental type likely to express such an opinion, 
and moreover we find Falstaff, a most insincere lover, 
sayings 

I cannot cog, I cannot prate*.*•..and say thou 
art this and that, like a many of these lisping 
hawthorn-Uida, that come like women in men’s 
apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury in 
simple-time. ( ¥#W .« 3 . 3 * 76 ) 

Still we have seen that silence or few words is to 

Shakespeare a sign of sincerity (vide Chapter 2). 

There is much railing at the folly of lovers in

tells how love draws one on to ridiculous actions 

(2,4*30^^)» Touchstone saysj 

We that are true lovers run into strange 
capers; but as all is mortal in nature, so 
is all nature in love mortal in folly, 

( AyXl .,2,4,^4) 

(Compare , 3,2,115) * Love itself Is folly. So thinks 

Mercutio (§£.,2.4,95ff), and the Duke in |g|, thinks love 

a passion beneath his dignity: 

Believe not that the dribbling dart of love 
Gan pierce a complete bosom, (MM,,1,3,2) 

Troilus in TC, says: 

To be wise and love 

Exceeds man’s might; that dwells with gods 
above (3,2,163) 

The idea that ’’reason and love keep little company 
together nowadays ( MKD ,, 3,1,146) ** finds an echo in MAAIT . 
2.3,170, MWW,,2,1,4. and in Cm.,4.2.22, Arviragus 
holds that ”Love*s reason’s without reason", , . 

Hal ( Hen.T ,.5,2,158) and Rosalind ( AYLI ,,4,1,94) 
are sceptical about people dying for love and lago is 
contemptuous of such weakness (0th,, 1,3*33-6), but there 
are numerous references to maidens who-die of secret 
love (L|X.,5.2,l6-8, TM,,2.4.110, 2.5.lO?)' besides the 
songs like the Willow Song and "Come Away Death", so 
that we cannot place Shakespeare on the side either of 
the romantics or the realists.

The qualities of love which seem to have impressed 

Shakespeare most are its shortnessi its waywardness and 

its infiniteness. Love in tlNX) . is said to bes 

moment any as a sound 
Swift as a shadow, short as any dream; 

Brief as the lightning in the collied nifeht, 
That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and 
earth, 

And ere a man hath power to say ’Behold’, 

The jaws of darkness do devour it up, 

So quick bright things come to confusion, 

(l.l,143ff) 


So the love of Romeo and Juliet is 

Too like the lightning which doth cease to be 
Bre one can say it lightens. (lU. ,2,l,l6o-2) 

The fleeting and changeable quality of love appears also 

in TOV,, 1,3*84-, where it is compared to an April day. 

love is full of unbefitting strains. 

All wanton as a child, skipping and vain, 
Form’d by the eye and therefore, like the eye. 
Full of straying shapes, of habits, and of 
forms, 

Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll 
To every object in his glance. 

Compare with this passage 5*1.7*17). 

Love is compared to a wayward child in TGV .,1*2.57. 

3,1,124, and in TB*, the Buke sayas 

so full of shapes is fancy 
That it alone is high fantastical, 

(Tg.,1,1,14) 

References to the infiniteness of love have been 
noted by Miss Spurgeon in VA, 389> ^*#2.2,133, AYLl ,, 
4,1,2, and Tg,,1,1*11, 2,4,102, Hear to this thought 
is the idea of the poverty of a love that can be

reckoned; 

They are but beggars that can count their 

worth 

But my true love is grown to such excess 
I cannot up sum of half my wealth, 

(M-»2.5.32ff) 

I were but little happy if I could say 
how much. ( MAAH .. 2.1. U8) 

There’s beggary in the love that can be 
reckoned. (^. ,1.1.15) 

Uote also Bam.,2•2.12. 

Miss Spurgeon also gathers instances of the idea 
that love is bitter sweet: Son.llS, LOG. 867 , BJ..1.11.9^^ 
AYLI ..4.3^02. TCm 2.2.142, ^.*1.3.354-. Love 
triumphing over time is the theme of Sonnets I08 and II6 
and also according to Miss Spurgeon, of T£. S’alse love 
is compared to playing false on an instrument, fGV .. 
4.2.56, AYLI ..4.3»67> These are stock ideas of love 
poetry. # 

# For further discussion of these ideas see Spurgeon, 

0£.j4it.,p.l47-l53* 

The power of love to transform "things base and 
vile" to "form and dignity (Mgg.,I.I.232)" appears also 
in the sonnets (see especially Son.114), and is 
illustrated dramatically in the love scene between 
Titanic and Bottom* The transforming power of love, 
translated into Falstaffian terms, recurs in MWW.,5*5*4.

The love of the mlndu idea that; 

Love looks not with the eyes, hut with the 
mind 

And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind. 

1 . 1 . 2 -^ 4 ) 

is illustrated as late as 0 th . where Lesdemona '^saw 

Othello's visage in his mind { 1 . 3 . 253 )*’. 

The distinction Shakespeare makes in VA. that, 

Love surfeits not, lust like a glutton dies. 

(IA*»^03) 

remains constant. (See Luc .7Q3> 0th »*2.1.235t 

Cym .. 1.6,43*) * Lust, in MW., 5*5*10Iff., is compared to 

a fire. Claudius in Ham , knows satiety: 

There lives within the very flame of love 
A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it. 

( Ham ..4.7.115) 

This is similar to the thought in lago's remark: 

When the blood is made dull with the act of 
sport, there should be» again to inflame it 
and give satiety a fresh appetite# loveliness 
in favor, sympathy in years# manners and 
beauties. (0th..2.1.230) 

True love meets with many hindrances. 

The course of true love never did run smooth 
5 *or either it was different in blood 
0 crossl too high to be enthralled to lowl etc. 

(MITB.. 

There is much in Shakespeare^ as there is bound to be in 
romantic comedy, on difference of rank coming between 
lovers, as for example in TGV .♦3.2.157 and M/W ..3.2.75 • 

In ra. much is made of the difference of rank between 
Olivia and Malvolio (2.5.156). Laertes and Polonius 





warn Ophelia that Hamlet is "a prince out of (her) star 
(H^. ,!• 3.4-. ,2.2.141) ” and therefore cannot narry her > 
bu^ desires her as a pxaything. This is not quite the 
same problem as in tue other plays, but it is the 
difference of rank which causes the complication. 
Difference of rank comes most seriously between lovers 
in the case of Bertram and Helena in AM . and Helena 
like Polonius expresses the difficulty in terms of stars: 

*Twere all one 

That I should love a bright particular star 
And think to wed it, he is so far above me. 

(AW.,1,1. 97 ) 

But the king discouhts the importance of birth ( A’^W. . 
2.3*125)• In Gym . Cloten points out to Imogen that she 
cannot wed as she pleases: just as Hamiet^s love can go 
only so far as his position permits, so she is 

curb’d from that enlargement by 
The consequence o’the crown; and must not foil 
The precious note of it with a base slave. 

(CBI..2.3.124) 

The belief that love might be induced by witchcraft 
spells, potions etc* comes up frequently in Shakespeare, 
usually as an accusation by an irate father. Sgeon in 
MD . charges that Lysander ’♦hath bewitch’d the bosom of 
(his) child ( MHD ..1.1.27)”* Falstaff says that Hal has 
given him potions to make him love him ( IHen.IV ..2.2.l6l) 
and Mrs* Q^uickly thinks Falstaff has used charms to win 
the two wives in «2.2.108. The idea appears also 

in TO.,3*1*723 and 5.1*79. Brabantio in 0th . makes a

makes the same accusation (Peri.,2.5,49), but little is 

made of it here. See also ^*,4.1230, 47 and V/X>»4«4.433« 

Shakespeare has much to say especially in the 

earlier plays about the fickleness of men, and particularly 

of youths. In G3#,5*l*52 the Abbess glances at the 

proneness, of young men to “give their eyes the liberty 

of gazing”. Rosalind in AXlI • gives as a lively 

description of a ”moonish youth changeable*shallow 

..♦.inconstant ( AXX.1 . ♦ 3»2.43) ” and in 3*5^72ff* says 

she, as a youth, is false. Phe- l^uka in - XTl . .x s k t Q4-4o

and Lucius in Cypi t echoes: 

briefly die their joys 
That place them in the truth of girls and 

boys ( Cym ,«5«^.10^) 

In the earlier plays especially there is much exclaiming 
on the inconstancy of men. This is natural in TGV . 
where Proteus* ficicleness gives rise to remarks like, 

It is the lesser blot... 

Women to change their shapes than men their 
minds. {5.4.107) 

0 heaven, were man 

But constant, he were perfectl that one 
error 

Fills him with faults; makes him run 

through all the sins: 
Inconstancy falls off ere it begins. 

(5.4.U0) 

Puck, in MB . is of the same opinion? 

Then fate o’er^rules, that, one man holding 
troth, 

A million fail, confounding oath an oath. 

( 3 * 2 . 92 } 

In the thought is echoed by the Friar (who is given 
many of Shakespeare’s comments)*' 

Women may fail, when there’s no strength in men, 
(2.3.80) and the nurse breaks out, 

There’s no trust, 

No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured. 

All x'orsworn, all naught, all dissemblers. 

(3.2.85-87) 

There is no dramatic purpose behind introducing the 

(> 

fickleness of men as the theme of the song Sipli No 

More Ladies sung by Balthasar in KAAN . *2.3. 6 

There may be dramatic irony in the idea of “deceivers**

since Pedro and the rest are deceiving Benedick hut 
the theme of the falseness of men in their dealings 
with women has no relation either to the immediate 
situation or to anything in the play. Falstaff talks 
of the '‘villainous inconstancy of man’s disposition 
ft':wv/ .,4.5»112)**. Viola and the Duke in TO* have much to 
say on the comparative strength of affection in men and 
womens 

i)uke- Let still the woman take 

An elder than herself| so wears she to him. 

So sways she level in her husband’s hearts 
For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, 

Cur fancies are more giddy and unfirm, 

More longing, wavering, sooner lost and woxj 
Than women’s are# (2S« #2.4.30) 

The i)uke later asserts that no woman is capable of the 

strength of men’s affections, which is a contradiction 

of the foregoing and may be explained only by supposing 

that the Duke, a typical lover, is inconsistent, or 

that one of the ideas is undramatic, given to the Duke 

because Shakespeare wanted to introduce it,-* if this is 

so, it is most likely the former since it is less in 

character for a lover such as the Duke. The idea^is, ^ 

however, a commonplace of Renaissance love literature^ 

Viola,too,is strongly insistent on the fickleness of 

men: 

We men may say more, swear more: but indeed 
Cur shows are more than will; for still we 
prove 

Much in our vows, but little in our love.

Imogen is convinced of the deceitfulneas of men’s vows, 
but in this case her disillusionment is dramatic ( Cvm .^ 

3.4.56) 

The frailty of women is of less frequent 
recurrence in the earlier plays, but appears more often 
in later ones. There is a reflection against ‘♦inconstant 
womanicind” in ^.,4.2.14 but it is insincere on the part 
of the speaker. In AYLI « Rosalind says boys and women 
are capriciouss 

mo oniah*.*.effeminate^ changeable, longing 
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, 
shallow, inconstant, full of fears, full 
of smiles, for every passion something and 
for no passion truly anything.....(3*2.430) 

and warns Orlando of her contrary moods (4.1.150,162), 

But in all this there is no serious condemnation of 

women as frail. Viola is more serious in taxing the 

frailty of her sex in trusting false men (2*2.30). 

Isabella makes the same observation on the weakness of 

women "credulous to false prints (MM..2,4.130)Ho 

persistent railing against women appears until Hamlet’s 

"yrailty thy name is woman ( Ham .. 1.2.46) 1", and Ham .. 

3,2*163. This is, of course the dramatic expression 

of Hamlet’s disgust at his mother’s sin, and tells us 

nothing about Shakespeare’s opinions. In AC. the clown 

puts the number of good women at five out of ten 

(5,2.75) which is a higher percentage than the one in

is called ”a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave (l*3*6 l)”« 

In we find Troilus doubtim;:

To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;

( 3 . 2 - 165 ) 

ir Compare Ham ,,4^7#115 

The idea is introduced here very largely for the effect 
of dramatic irony, s^ince Crassida proves false* Octavius 
does not think much of the constancy of womens 

women are not 

In their best fortunes strong; but want will

The na’er touched vestal* (AG*»3»12,29} 

Gym * contains many x’eferences to the falsity of womankind, 
chiefly from Posthumus in whose case they o^e purely 
dramatics Cyra *,2,4.110,, 2.5,lff* The idea is given 
also to the king when he finds out the extent of the 
queen^s wickedness (5.5.'^7) to the cynic lachimo 
( 1 , 4 . 136 ), In the case of the jealous Leontes in IJ, 
we may also put the reference to women ( 1 , 2 . 130 ) down 
to dramatic reasons* Thus most of the passages 
condemning v/omen for inconstancy are dramatic* Mareover, 
since the theme of the ^constancy of women and their 
being governed by the changing moon, is a conaaonplace 
in literature its recurrence is less likely to indicate

any special bias on Shakespeare’s part than his emphasis

Tui'ning now to the ideas on friendship we find 
that, as in the case of grief and loTe, all elaborate 
ostentation and eloquence denotes insincerity;

(Compare X-eri », l#4#y$.)

every newcomer is never deep* Oassiua in ££* defends 
the sincerity of his friendship for Brutus by asserting 
he is not used to

The thought is part of Polonius’ advice to Laertesj

Kore important la the relation of friendship with 
love. The exaltation of the claims of friendship oTer 
love was a common Renaissance theme derived from classical 
literature. Its popularity in Elizabethan drama, 
especially in the *90»s is shown in Mr. L.J.Mills’ book. 
One Soul in Bodies Twain . # One of Shakespeare’s 

# Indiana, 1937* 

earliest comedies, TOY ., is a play on the friendship vs. 

love theme which is intelligible only in the light of 

Elizabethan ideas. Proteus sins in setting love above 

friendship and betraying Valentine for Sylvia. Valentine 

incredible generosity in offering to give up Sylvia to 

Proteus is merely the triumph of idealized friendship 

over love, and the Elizabethan audience would regard it 

as all quite right end proper# is also a play of 

friendship. Eassanio puts Antonio above his own life, 

his wife and the worlds 

Antonio, I am married to a wife 

Which is as dear to me as life itselfi 

But life itself, my wife, and all the world, 

Are not with me esteemed above thy lifei 
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all 
Here to this devil, to deliver you. 

(MV»f^*l*282ff) 

and Gratiano echoes the sentiment (4.1*290). For other 
indications of the strength of the friendship between 
Antonio and Bassanio see W*,2.8.50, 3»2«294. Portia

in her willingness to help Bassanio perform his 

obligations to his friend and in forgiving Bassanio for 
putting friendship above his wife’s request and giving 
away her ring, admits that friendship is a more exalted 
sentiment than love* 

Friendship and love have been weighed, arid 
friendship has received preference; only by 
such a choice could love become perfect - 
a fact recognized by Portia as well as by 
Bassanio* #

He offers to be Sebastian’s sezrvant and follows him at 
the risk of his life* 

I do adore thee so 

That danger shall seem sport, and I will go, 

(TH..2.1.48) 

I could not stay behind you; my desire 

More sharp than filed steel, did spur me 
forth. (TN*,3*3*4) 

Antonio gives Sebastian his purse, tries to rescue him, 
is himself arrested, and then is only sorry that he 
cannot aid his friend. All this is in the convention 
of exalted friendship. 

What is the relation between these passages in 
the plays and the story the commentators find in the 
sonnets, of the friendship of Shakespeare and a noble 
youth, of his betrayal by the youth and the dark lady 
whom he loves, and his placing friendship above love 
and forgiving the friend? Is Shakespeare writing this 
story into characters like Proteus and Sebastian? Is 
his emphasis on the fickleness of youths, his insistence 
on) the deceptiveness of beauty bound up with this 
personal experience? Possibly, but these ideas occur 
in conjunction with many other dramatic situations as 
well, which are not necessarily personal* Without gcing 
into the question of whether the sonnets are 
autobiographical, it is safe to say that the friendship 
theme is not abnormally strong in Shakespeare* It was 
a stock formula with many variations* The idea of the

friend wooing for another and falling in love with the 
lady himself, the lover giving up his lady to his friend 
and Shakespeare's other treatments were all common 
modifications of this familiar theme. The fact that 
Shakespeare uses this commonplace formula in both sonnets 
and drama would seem to indicate tliat he was interested 
in it rather as a literary device than as a vehicle for 
the expression of personal experience. It is unlikely 
on the face of it, that so conventional a play as TGV, 
for example with its stock situations and stock 
characters, contains personal revelation* Shakespeare's 
audience had been familiar since the earliest times of 
Elizabethan drama with plays like Edwards' Damon and 
Pythias which exalted friendship above love in most 
idealistic terms, and the friendship theme, treated in 
a manner very similar to the incident implied in the 
sonnets appears in jSuphues , I think we may safely say 
that with very few exceptions the ideas Shakespeare 
expresses on both love and friendship are the 
conventional Elizabethan notions expressed in the 
conventional forms.

CHAPTER V 


UNRELATED IDEAS 

There remain a number of Ideas^ some of them 
beliefs of the time which naturally recur but which 
reveal little about Shakespeare except that he shared 
the average Elizabethan notions; some of them more 
individual opinions which, like those on war, do not 
give us anything conclusive, and some which do not fall 
naturally into the.divisions already dealt with. Among 
them are his ideas on nature, the universe, superstitions, | 
time, death, war, contemporary manners and women, and his J 
attitude to wealth and gold. 


Nature and the Universe . 


Siiakespeare was obviously a lover of natures 

Hature-the life of the English country-side, 
the weather and its changes, the seasons, 
the sky, sunrise and dawn, the clouds, rain 
and wind, sunshine and shadow; the garden 
«*•.*.•••.the sea dnd ships, the river...... 

animals, sport and games.....these are the 

things which chiefly occupy him and remain 
in his mind. # 


# Spurgeon. 0p, cit .«p.44. 


But he is not given to making philosophical generalizations

about nature! he enjoye It and takes it for granted* In 

80 far as he does reflect on nature* he regards her as 

the universal mother* producing both good and evil* but 

all things for some uses 

The earth that's nature*s mother is her tomb; 
«/hat is her burying ground that is her womb* 

And from her womb children of divers kinda 
te auoking on her natural bosom find* 

Many for many virtues excellent. 

Hone but for some and yet all different*••• 

For naught so vile that on the earth doth live 
But to the earth some epeoial good doth give* 
Bor aught so good* but strained form that fair 

use 

Revolts from true birth* stumbling on abuse* 

The idea that nature is bounteous* but demands usury* is 
behind the first groups of sonnets (see sonnet 4*3*J and 
reappears in MB-*:

Herself the glory of a creditor

Of all aspects of nature, the early dawn and 

sunrise seem to have affected Shakespeare most deeply* 

It is indeed clear that the spectacle of the 
rising sun seems ever peculiarly to inspire 
and delight Shakespeare. He connects it 
with youth and vigor, with strength, splendor, 
good cheer and renewal of life. # 


# Ibid ., p.63. 


Here are only a few of the descriptions of dawn in 
Shakespeares IHen.VI ..2.2.1-2. -^len.VI ..2.1.21. 2. 5 .Iff., 
MAAH .. 5 * 3 * 27 . gam*,1*1*66. The savage’s worship of the 
sun supplies a number of images and comparisons usually 
in connection with the lover’s worship of his mistress, 
as in this speech from Berownet 

who sees the heavenly Rosaline 
That, like a rude and savage man of Inde, 

At the first opening of the gorgeous east 
Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind 
Kisses the base ground with obedient breast. 

(LLB.,4.3.22) 

There is another reference in LLL ..5*2.202. and the idea, 
though not applied to a mistress, had appeared in Son*. 
7*1-^* Benvolio in E£. talks of the **worshipt sun 
( 1 . 1 * 125 )” • '3?he thought is not confined to the sonnets 

and early plays but reappears as late as AWW*,l*3«205-8: 

Thus, Indian-like, 

Religious in mine error, I adore 

The sun, that looks upon his worshipper. 

But knows of him no more* 

and in Gym *.3>3.1ff. Belarius and his foster sons worship 













199 

the sun. Shalcespeare here may be attempting to give a 


touch of realism to the setting in Ancient Britain, since 
the Britons were sun worshippers. 

There are a number of indications of Shakespeare’s 
love of hounds, especially of the baying of hounds and 
winding of horns for the hunt. See T.And .2.2.especially 
11.20ff. and 2.3.l6ff. In this last reference in T.And . 
the noise of the hounds and horns is regarded as music 
and produces sleep (see chapter in)* Theseus is an 
enthusiastic hunter to whom the baying of his hounds is 
music: 


l^ly love shall hear the music of my hounds.. 

We will.,....up to the mountain’s top 
And mark the musical confusion 
Of hounds and echo in conjunction., 

(MD..4.1.110) 

Hyppolita describes the hounds of Sparta: 

never did I hear 

Such gallant chiding; for, besides the groves. 
The skies, the mountains, every region near 
Seem’d all one mtual cry: I never heard 
So musical a discord, such sweet thunder. 

^ (4.1.118) 

and Theseus replies with a sportsman’s enthusiastic 

account of the virtues of his own dogs. The lord in TS, 

Ind ..I.l6 charges his seivants to care for his hounds 

and betrays himself a true lover of the sport. Indeed 

since the average Elizabethan gentleman would be as keen 

about his hounds as the modern about his car or his golf 

there is nothing unusual about Shakespeare’s interest

except the association of hounds with mu&ici^ If 
Shakespeare regarded the hunt as cruel the evidence is 
rather in imagery than in direct statement. The princess 
in LLL » t4.1.24ff. pities the deer she is about to kill 
but Nathaniel calls the hunt "Very reverend sport, truly, 
and done in the testimony of a good conscience (4.2.1)"* 
Jaques condemns the hunt strongly: 

swearing that we (the Duke^s companions) 
Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what’s Y/orse, 

To frii^ht the animals and to kill them up 
In their assign’d and native dwelling-place. 

( AYL1 >.2.1.6q) 

But though many of Jaques’ remarks express ideas that 
seem to be Shakespeare’s, it would be difficult to assume 
on the basis of this one passage that Shakespeare thought 
the hunt cruel. 

Nature, as we have seen in Chapter I, is 
imaginatively associated with much tlmt is of the highest 
importance in Shakespeare’s thought, but his ideas about 
nature herself are not startling or original. He accepts 
the ordinary beliefs of his time. Similarly he takes 
the Ptolemaic system for granted and uses the cosmos as 
he does nature, abundantly for illustration and imagery. 
He betrays none of that uncertainty which made Donne, 
his only slightly younger contemporary^feel that "the 
sun (was) lost and the earth, and no man’s wit (could) 
well direct him where to look for it", #

Donne* s Poetical Worka , ed, Grierson (Oxford: Clarendon) 
i-resa, 191^ *’The First Anniversary”, 1,207« 

Shakespeare accepts the average Slizahethan*s 
belief in the influence of the stars and planets on human 
action, that is to say, the majority of his characters do. 
It would be futile to attempt to collect all the referem^s 
explicit and implicit to this belief. It was and is part 
of everyday speech. I note a few more striking exacplesj

The idea that the heavens are interested in and take 
part in human actions is also an accepted commonplaces

Hamlet, especially toward the end of the play ( Ham. .

(4,3*3^) and Octavius in AC.,(3«684). The sceptics who 
assert the freedom of the human will are fewer, Cassius 
affirms that: 

Men at some time are masters of their fates, 

The fault, dear BrutuS| is not in our stars, 

But in ourselves, that we are underlings, 

(££.,1,2,119) 

hut Brutus and Caesar are fatalists (2,2,26, 4,3*218), 
lago and Edmund hoth scorn the idea of the stars 
influencing human ctoracter ( 0th ,,1,3*322, KL#.1,2,128) 
and Helena believes **the fated sky gives us free scope 
(l,l*2l8ff,) ", We cannot even conjecture what Shakespeare 
himself may have thought. 

Similarly nothing can he learned of what Shakespeare 
thought regarding the future life. His characters either 
accept orthodox doctrines or, like Hamlet, are merely 
uncertain. Even a number of repetitions of an accepted 
belief would scarcely establish it as his. For instance 
the idea that the soul hovered in the air after death is 
found fairly often chiefly in the earlier history plays 

Hioh.II ..l.^.iq4. 5.5.112, Hen.Y. . 
4.4,15), tut it would be difficult to maintain that 
Shakespeare himself must therefore have believed it. 

B, Superstition , 

Ho attempt will be made here to discuss with any 
completeness Shakespeare’s treatment of superstition.

witchcraft etc*, but a study of the recurring passages 
yields some interesting evidence. 

Night, for instance, is associated with screech- 
owls, ravens, sometimes wolves, and ghosts breaking open 
their graves: 

Deep night•••*••• 

The time of night when Troy was set on firej 
The time when screech-owls cry, and ban-dogs 

howl, 

And spirits walk, and ghosts break up their 

graves,- 

( gHen,VI ..1.4.l6) 

The melancholy of night, graves and foul, contagious 

air are associated in 2Hen. VI. .4,1*3. In MNP . Puck 

warns of the coming dawn 

At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here 

and there, 

Troop hcaae to churchyards; damned spirits all, 
That in crossways and floods have burial, 
Already tn their wormy beds are gone; 

Por fear lest day should look their shames 

upon, 

They wilfully themselves exile from light 
And must for aye consort with biack-brow*d 

night. (3.2.381) 

In the final scene Puck enters to introduce the fairy 
song and dance and set the atmosphere of night and magic 1 

Now the hungry lion roars. 

And the wolf behowls the moon.... 

Now the wasted brands do glow, 

Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud, 

Puts the wretch that lies in woe. 

In remembrance of a shroud. 

Now it is the time of night 
That the graves all gaping wide, 

Everyone lets forth his sprite. 

In the church-way paths to glide: (5.1.378) 

The night-wandering habits of spirits receive brief 













204. 

mention in RJ*,4.3«434. In MAAH . in the song sung to 
the goddess of night we have a reference to wolves and 
to graves yawting and yielding their dead 
The dark night is thought to sort well with spirits and 
witchery in If//W ., 5*2♦ 13> In Hamlet we have a reference 
to the superstition mentioned by Puck, that at cockcroiy, 

The extravagant and erring spirit hies 

To his confine. ( Ham. . 1.1.15fQ) 

and Hamlet, after the play scene, working himself up 
into a mood of desperation, sayss 

*Tis now the very witching time of night, 

V/hen churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes 

out 

Contagion to this world, ( Ham. .^.2,406) 

There are further references to spirits walking in 
Macb ..2.3>B4. Temp ..5.2.48. and Hen.VIII ..5>1*13. The 
notion we have met before that night air is contagious 
is found also in ^.,2.1.263-5* Owls and 

ravens are associated with night as birds of ill omenj 
3Hen.VI . .5*^*44. T»Ahd ..2.3»78. #»1.3• 26. licacb. .2.23^4 

The sinister significance of gathering poisonous herbs 
at midnight appears in Ham., 3♦2.268. and Macb.,4.1,25. 

There are some repetitions in the ghost scenes. 

It was an accepted belief that the lights bum blue on 
the approach of the gliosts { Hi ch.»11 .. 5.3 > l8o) and in 
JC . just as the ghost of Caesar appears, Brutus remarks, 
**How ill this taper burns”. Both Brutus and Hamlet ask 
whether the apparition is a devil or good spirit;

JC.,4,3«279» Ham.,1.4.40, and in 2.2.628^ Hamlet is 
still in doubt as to whether the spirit he has seen is 
the Devil. 

Conjuring up a spirit was both a common superstition 

and effective stage business. In 2Hen.VI. .1.4.25 a 

spirit is actually conjured and prophesies, we have 

reference to the practice in Hen.V. .5*2.315 and HJ.. 

2.1.6. Apparently only a scholar could properly address 

a spirit. Benedict in 14AAIT . says of Beatrice: 

I would to God some scholar would conjure 
her. (2.1,264) 

In Ham . Horatio being the scholari first addresses the 
ghost: 

Thou art a scholar; speak to it Horatio. 

(1.1.42) 

Brutus and Hamlet are both studious men, and they address 

the ghosts and are answered, whereas Macbeth addresses 

Banquets spirit which says nothing to him. 

The notion that the fairies went tbrought a house 
le 

or castle beissing it Shakespeare used twice in MHD» . 
5.1.398 and Mv/t ..5*?.48. The fairies* hatred of sluttfry 
appears in each case. 

The popular idea that witches had beards is used 
comically i n MW «.4.2.2 q 6 and seriously in Macb .. 1. 3.4H. 

There is white magic as well as black, and it is 
this ths.t Rosalind’s uncle ( ATLI ,.5«3,2.65 )» Glendower, 
and Prospero deal in. 











206 


The ideas here are illustrative rather of 
Shakespeare* s use of the beliefs of the ordinary man 
of his day than of personal predilections or peculiar 
knowledge* 


C. Time and Death* 


Time is a favorite Shakespearean theme*.**. 
The consciousness of death characterizes the 
middle ages, the sense of time is the 
dominating note of the Renaissance*# 


# G.Rylands, Shakespeare the Poet", 4 Companion to 
Shakespeare Studies * p.lOj* *** 


Shakespeare thinks of time as a despoiler, especially 
of youth ( Son .15* 19# 60, 63, 64, 6^, liuc .* 427, LLL ^. 
1*1*4, TC*,3^2,191, 3*3.148ff., 4.4*42,). On the other 
hand time is often regarded as a benefactor bringing 
error to light and revealing the true worth of things 
(1*10,941, SGV.,3.1.243, 3Hen.YI ,.3.3.77. Rioh.III ..3.7.167. 
AYll ..4.1.203. 2a»»2:.2.41, 5.1.116, EL., 1.1.283, WT., 

4.Prol.2,^. Siiakespeare’s most individual and constant 
idea about time is that it "travels in divers paces with 
divers persons ( AYLI ..3*2.36)"* This reflection which 
Rosalind develops so wittily was not original with her* 

It had occurred in Luo *990*2, l575t VA*?3»842, Son *19* 

123, jgD.,3*2*200, Hichai., 



























207. 

1.3.213, 1.3.261, 5 . 5 . 57 , MAA]!f ..2.1.36l. HAH.V .. 4 Prol,20 

AYLl ..2.3.842 and was to be echoed in AWW . .5.3.40. TO,, 

4.2.11, 4.4.42, 0th.,2.3.333, 3.4.174. 

We hate discussed previously the passages dealing 

with the longing for death and with the question of 

suicide (Chapter SI). Aside from these, ShaJ^espeare’s 

ideas on death yield little evidence of originality. 

In M*, and other early plays we have xjassages with a 

conventional charnel house flavor (KJa,l,4,2^ff, RJ., 

while in Ham* the brooding on death and decay 

has deepened in thought and becomes less conventional 

in expression. The idea that death is an antic, a 

frightening bogey, appears in IHen,VI **4*7*18* IHen,IV. ^ 

1*1*66 and Macb **2*2*53* The most common thought on 

death is that it is a levelers 

Sven so must I run on, and even so stop. 

What surety of the world, what hope, what stgry, 
When this was now a king, and now is clay, 

( KJ.,5*7.67) 

The same reflection may be found in JG*,3*1*148 and is 

given its finest expression in Hamlet’s musing over the 

skulls in the churchyard (Ham*,5*l*S3f^‘). 

To what base uses we may return, HoratioJ 
Why may not imagination trace the noble 
dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping 
a Imng-hole. 

(Ham.,5*l*223) 

This almost metaphysical brooding on the horrible aspects 
of death is chai^acteristic of Hamlet and had appeared

208 


These feflections on death and time are all 
familiar Renaissance themes* More may he conjectured 
of Shaiceax^eare^ s personal view of death anytime from 
studying his haagery* 

D. War 

Shakespeare’s attitude toward war in general is 
less easily determined than his attitude toward civil 

war* Miss Spur.^^ ,n finds tha,t he consistently thinks of 
war in terms of harsh and discordant sound, a sign of 
intense dislike* # Direct statements do not yield a 

^ ci t * t p» y6 * 

very clear indication of his viewpoint* There are of 

course the conventional and obvious contrasts of peace 

and war, alv/ays favorable to peace# Peace is represented 

as a sleeping infant or a jjale-faced maid, war as rude 

and boisterous, frightening her ( Rich*XI **1*3#132# 

3*3*97» SHen#!? **4#l*41ff*)» Most references to war, 

whether they are embodied in the noise imagery noted by 

Miss Spurgeon or not, are unfavorables 

0 war, thou son of hell 
^"hom angry heavens do make their minister# 

( 2Hen#YI #*5#2*33) 

This churlish knot of all^abhorred war* 

( XHen*iy *#^.l*l6) 

Contumelious, beastly, mad-brained war*

209. 

There is> however, a commendation of King Philip’s war 
on England as **just and charitable” in 2.1.35 and 
Othello talks of the "pride pomp and circumstance of 
glorious vrar ( 0th .. 3.3.354-) ” . V/e find no consistent 
recurrence of condemnation sufficient to establish any 
strong convictions of Shaukespeare’s part. There are 
references to the sorrows arising from war, ftnf example, 
in KJ..2.1.302 and more particularly in Hen.V .. and a 
description of the horrible aspects of it in T.Ath .. 
4.3*107. In Een.V . alone is there much direct discussion 
on the pros and cons of war. Here we have Henry, the 
model king, warning his councillors not to advocate a war 
without just causes 

Therefore take heed how you impawn our person. 
How you awake our sleeping sword of wars 
We charge you, in the name of God, take heed; 

For never two such kingdoms did contend 
Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless 

drops 

Are every one a woe, a sore complaint 
’Gainst him whose wrongs give edge unto the 

swords 

That make such Y/aste in brief mortality. 

(1.2.21 ff.) 

On the other tend, it is perfectly clear that Henry’s 
claim to the French throne is mere sophistry- This idea 
of the moral responsibility of those v/ho provoke war 
occurs again in Hen.V . in 1.2.28lff, 2.4.i.02ff., 3.3.10ff. 
but it is bandied back and forth between the French and 
English as a threat without any strong sense of conviction#

which Henry threatens the citizens of Harfleur (3*3*10) 
shows Shakespeare’s awareness of its brutality though 
not necessarily personal experience of it hut in all 
these threats there is a recognition of guilt involved 
in war, an an attempt to fix the blame upon the opponent 
In 4«l,140if, anil argument takes place, not too 
dramatically, between the disguised King Hal and the 
soldier Williojns in which Williams puts forth this 
argument that the king should make sure his cause is Just 
because he is ruiiponsible for the liveB lost and the 
damning of the souls of those who die in their sins. 

Hal refutes this on the ground tliat the king has power 
over the subject’s allegiance, not over his soul. If a 
man dies in battle, it Is God’s vengeance for his sins. 
This idea does not occur outside Hen«V > t and it is not 
possible to tell whex^e Shakespeare’s sympathy lay in the 
matter# However, all that can be affirmed with any 
conviction from this discussion in Hen#V . is that 
Shakespeare at the time was probably interested in the 
question of the guilt involved in provoking war and hence 
uses the argument frequently, but at the same time the 
play itself is through^ut a glorification of war. Still 
the question remains whether this is due to the dramatist 
conviction or to popular taste# It is possible 
Shakespeare is sufficiently in tune with popular 
patriotism to glorify Henry V’s conquests with sincerity,

but to do BO ijivolves glorifying war, and he sometimes 

betrays himself* For example in Hen*Y * *2,4* 57 he is 

describing Sdward III, standing on a hill watching his 

son, the Black Prince in battle: 

rfi^hiles that his mountain sire, on mountain 

standing, 

Up in the air, crown’d with the golden sun. 

Saw his heroical sec4 and smil’d to see him, 
kangle the work of nature and deface 
The patterns that by Goci and by French fathers 
Had twenty years been made* 

He is glorifying the soldier’s prowess but the terms in 
which he does so betray his own feelings* Ho one could 
show himself as tho^xoughiy aware, as Shakespeare does 
of the fiimsiness of Henry* s excuse for an inrasion of 
France^ of the cruelty of war, and of the sort of riff¬ 
raff who made up a large part of the army, and still 
believe sincerely that war was splendid and noble. 

Some further light is thrown on the problem by the 
repetition in Rich*lII **4»4»529 and iiich.II **2»l*170ff* 
of the idea that, while civil war is always to be 
abhorred, foreign war is justified and even desirable, 
but it should be noted that the speaker in each case is 
one to whom such an idea is dramatically suitable and 

*. <S 42- O' 

hence,^need not be Shakespeare’s, Related to it is the 

idea expressed by John in KJ»»4*2«iy3s 

0 let me have no subjects enemies, 

V/hen adverse foreigners affright my towns 
i/ith dreadful pomp of stout invasion.

Solidarity in the otpte wag an advantage in war; civil 
dissension a v/eakness easily taken advantage of by the 
enemy, Whether or not Shakespeare ooncurred with York 
and Richard III on foreign war, the fact remains that 
it is difficult to find any pronounced tendency to preach 
against war. ;^uite a lot is made in TC.,2.2., and 4.1. 
of the trivial causes over which wars are gought. The 
petty causes of war had been noted before in Ham ..4.4.47. 
but here Hamlet, meeting Fortinbras* forces turns this 
argument against himself, chiding his lack of the thirst 
for honor which impels them. In the Ham , scene, however, 
occurs an idea which Shakespeare was to repeat later, 
that peace corruptss 

This is the imposthume of much wealth and 

peace, 

That inward breaks, and shows no cause 

without 

Why the man dies* ( Ham ..4.4.27.) 

The servants in Cori . develop it at some lengths 
Second serving man s 

This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, 
increase tailors, and breed ballad makers. 
First serving man s 

Let me have war, say I, it exceeds peace as 
far as day does night} it*s sprightly, waking, 
audible, and full of meat. Peace is a very 
apoplexy, lethargy} mull’d, deaf, sleepy, 
insensible, a getter of more bastard children 
than war’s a destroyer of men...... 

(4.5.2l6ff.)

"be thoa o of th e authc r. Again in CjQS.»3»^*21, Imogen, 

from whom one would least expect it, saysj 

Plenty and peace breed cowards; hardness 

ever 

Of hardness is mother. 

As early as IHen.IV. ,4.2.31ff. the ragged regiment 
recruited by Falstaff, old soldiers, discarded serving 
men, younger sons, and all the scum of society, are 
referred to as "the cankers of a calm world and a long 
peace". The observation that the wars caught up auch 
types and were welcomed by them occurs in KJ. .2.1.70: 
IHeiuIV.,5.1*815 2Hen.IV ..1.2.44- and 2Hen.IV ..4.I.^2. 
and we have it dramatized in Hen.V » in Pistol, Hym, 
and the boy.. # In the face of these varying ideas on 


# We have many references also to the presence of 
unfledged lads in the army» This was evidently a common 
practice and is referred to frequently either as a sign 
of the eagerness of all parts of the nation to part¬ 
icipate as in |g[.,2.1.72, ISLtjJt.Prol.22 and Rich. 11 ... 
3.2.113. Similarly the presence of women who have 
exchanged their household duties for warlike employment 
is used as an indication of eagerness: KJ..5.2.l6off; 
Rich.II. .3.2.118; JC.,2.1.120; In Macbeth the presence 

of boys and women is. an indication of the weakness of 
Macbeth’s cause ( Maob ..4.3.1B7 and 5.2.10). Another 
sign of patriotic fervor is the selling of land to go 
to the wars. Many, as Ghatillon says in KJ.,2.1,73 come 
with their manors on their backs to seek fortune. The 
idea is repeated in Hen.Y ..2.Prol.5» and in Hen.VIII .. 
1.1.83. 


war, which, while they do not actually conflict, do not 
place Shakespeare definitely on either side, it is only 
possible to conclude that he probably hated war, and was 

























214. 

fully aware of its evils, but it would be difficult 
indeed to prove that he was so far beyond hie 
contemporaries as to preach pacifism.. 

Ef Contemporary Manners and v.omen . 

Shakespeare is not much given to topical allusion 

nor to direct social criticism, he left that field to 

Jonson and others, but there a few repeated criticisms 

which may indicate his own opinions* 

Slxtravaganoe and ostentation in dress was a 

favorite topic of Elizabethan satirists and moralists, 

euid as a common subject of conversation naturally 

appears often in Shakespeare* 

An Englishman's dress....was a byword in 
the rest of Europe, and the medley of taste 
and cut, borrowed from various countries, 
which he bore upon his person was proverbial.# 


# ShaKespeare*s England (Oxford:Clarendon Press, 1916), 
vol.ll., p.103. 

It does not necessarily indicate therefore any unusual 
tastes on Shakespeare* s x>art when we find him joining in 
the jibes at the Englishman's aping of foreign manners 
and dress. In Rich.II . there is a reference to the 
English adopting Balian fashions. The habit of 
travellers of adopting the fashions of various countries 
or of two countries at once is laughed at in MAAN .. 3«2.30ff.

and in 1^. Portia ridicules her JSnglish suitor on this 
ground: 


I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his 
round hose in Prance, his bonnet in Germany, 
and his behaviour everywhere. 

(KV.,1.2.80) 

One of the marks of the traveller is to "wear strange 
suits (A]nU.,4.1.35)" and in Hen.VIII ..1.3.1-l‘? the 
importation of manners and styles from Prance is 
condemned* 

The new styles in fencing are glanced at in RJ., 

2.3,19 and in MWW.,2.1.229, 2.2.24. and the courtly 

forms of quarreling are taken off in RJ,,3.1.l6ff. and 

AY3^I .>5.4.56«*109. There is some criticism of the common 

vices of gentlemen, swearing, gambling etc, in LLL .. 

1.2,45, IHen.IV, .3.2.15 and WT.,5*2.l62. Touchstone, 

to prove he has been a courtier, says; 

I have trod a measure; I have flattered a 
lady; I have been politic with my friend, 
smooth with mine enemy; I have undone three 
tailors; I have had four quarrels, and like 
to have fought one. ( AYLI ..5.4.45) 


More prominent in Shakespeare than criticism of 
flress and fashions is a general dislike of affected 
speech and exaggerated compliment. He ridicules it in 
the character of Armado in LLL .. and Berowne says of 
Boyet: 

This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease. 

And utters it again when God doth please,.,. 

A* can carve too, and lisp: why this is he 










2 l6 


That kist his hand away in courtesy; 

This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice, 
That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice 
In honorable terms. ( LLL ..5*2.316) 

The Bastard 5*alconbridge intends to pick up the art of 

obsequious compliment as a means of rising, but he is 

contemptuous of it (KJ.,1.1.207)• Meroutio scoffs at 

the affected speech of "such antic,lisping, affected 

fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents (HJ..2.^.29)”. 

IHen.IV . we have Hotspur’s scornful description of a 
fop who talks ”with many holiday and lady terms, like a 
waiting gentlewoman (l*3«33^i'») ”• Beatrice tells 
Benedicks 

Manhood is melted into curtsies, valor into 
compliment, and men are only turned into 
tongue, and trim-ones too. 

( MAAS ..4.1.325) 

To Jaques "that they call compliment is like the 

encounter of two dog apes { ATi»I ..2.5*26)". Olivia joins 

in the condemnation of hollow and exaggerated courtesy 

(.TN.. 3•1.109) • and Malvolio is ridiculed for his ability 

to "con state (i.e. the speech of polite society) 

without book and utter it by great swartha ( 2 . 3 * 159 )"» 

Hamlet parodies the affected sj^eech of Osric 

5.2.8lff.) and his obsequious manners. He is one who has 

only got the tune of the time, and outward 
habit of encounter; a kind of yesty collection, 
which carries them through and through the 
most fann’d and winnowed opinions; and do but 
blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out. 

(5.2.198)

217. 

Hamlet in his condemnation of the falseness and 

artificiality of women links affected speech with 

powdering the face etc.; 

You lispi you nickname God’s creatures 

(Ham.,3.1.151) 

Lisping was one of the affectations of the travellers 

(AYLI ..4.1.35) and mannerism which Shakespeare seems to 

have found particularly objectionahle. Chaucer also has 

a dig at the affectation in his portrait of the Prere 

in the Canterbury Tales ; 

Somewhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse, 

To make his Snglissh sweete upon his tonge;# 

(264) 


# ^.,p.22, 1.264. 


It may be noted that mny of these affected fops are 

given to too ready smiling; Boyet, Malvolio, Osric and 

the fop described by Hotspur. 

Passing on to Shakespeare’s opinions about women 

(ie. aside from reflections on the frailty of the sex, 

which have been dealt with in Chapter IV.), we find that 

c one 0 rned 

he is most consistently with their voices. 

The venom c3.amors of a jealous woman 
Poisons more deadly than a mad-dog’s tooth. 

(cj.,5.1.69) 

To be slow in words is a woman’s only virtue. 

(TGV..3a.341) 

The talkativeness of women is commented on in Rich.II .. 
1.1.48, IHen.IV .. 1.3.237, 3.1.160. Rosalind is witty

on the proverbial volubility of womankind ( AYLI ,> 
3.2.663, 4.1,174). There are indications that both the 
wives in 0th . are given to curtain lectures (2.1.105, 
3.3.22ff,) 

Shakespeare is insistent on the beauty of a quiet 
voice in a woman* Juliet*s is apparently low (RJ.. 
2,2.159) • Slender says Anne Page ** speaks sma}.! like a 
wojnan ( MWW .. 1,1.49)” . *3mall* evidently meant high and 
piping as compared to the ddeper tones of a man’s voice, 
and low means quiet, hence either term is opposed to 
loud or rough. The Duke commend^ Viola whose voice is 
apparently high, Imt not louds 

Thy small pipe 

Is as the maiden*s organ, shrill and sound, 

And all is semblative a woman*s part, 

(ra.,1.4.32) 

The idea is expressed by lago ( 0th .,2,1,150) and comes 
into where Lear thinks he hears the dead Cordelia 
speak,- 

j What is’t thou say*st? Her voice was ever 

soft, 

Gentle and low, an excellent thing in woman, 

(a.,5*3*272) 

All this gives added meaning to Coriolanus* greeting 
his wife as 

My gracious silence. ( Gori .,2.1.193) 
Cleopatra is the only one who thinks that a low voice is 
a defect and she is referring to Octavia 

who, she would like to think, lacks the charm necessary

to hold Antony, laoreover she probably realizes she 

herself is talkative, even shrill, and knows Antony is 

not likely to be long attracted to a quiet woman. Hence 

the passage is strictly dramatic.

true miden blushes readily; RJ.,2,4.71, MAAH . .4.1.3*?. 

4.1.161, ».,1.4.16, ^.,3«2.30, 109, 0th,,1.3.94. A 

modest maid was also supposed to be coy,- 

Since maids, in modesty, say ’no’ to that 
Which they would have the profferer construe 
as ’aye’: (TGV.,1.2,55ff) 

See also TGV ., 3.1.94 and Riohll ., 3.7.51. But Shakespeare, 
having portrayed Juliet, Desdemona, and Miranda could 
scarcely have admired coy women. 

Except for the preference for soft voices, which 
in itself is not strikingly^ individual since to ’speak 
small’ like a woman was usually accounted a feminine 
grace in Elizabethan times, these remarks about women are 
very general and commonplace, 1^0st of the judgments on 
women are directly related to the experience of the 
speaker and do not reappear consistently as these do. 


Attitude to Wealth

jM 






F. Attitude to Wealth 


220 « 

The idea that material wealth corrupts morals is 
a common one. Misers are condemned In ^uj|* ,B55-6l, 
and Romeo in the apothecary scene calls the gold he gives 
the wretched man ”worse poison to men’s souls'* than that 
he buys is to their bodies (RJ., J.l.Bo) , and there is a 
reference in the saiae play to "saint-seducing gold (RJ.. 
1.1,220)". The remark of Romeo in ^,1, has no particular 
bearing either on Romeo’s character nor the general point 
of the scene which indeed seems largely extraneous. The 
corrupting influence of gold- is noted in 2Hen.IV ..4.5.66, 
72* Brutus in £C. calls it "trash" (4.2.25-6), 7^)* As 
Hardin Oraig points out in a note on the passage, this 
attitude was a trait of Stoic philosophy. But there is 
no strong reiteration of the theme outside of T.Ath . 
where it is insisted upon. Flavius comments on his 
master’s falli 

Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt. 

Since riches point to misery and contempt. 

( T.Ath ..4.2.3) 

and Timon when he finds gold says: 

Thus much of this will make black white; 

foul, fair; 

Wrong, right; base noble etc.,.., 

( T.Ath ..4.^.28ff.) 

and later in the same scene reiterates the thought 
(4.3.290, 383), The point of his giving gold to 
Alcibiades and the two whores is that he hopes to hasten 
the moral ruin of Athens, The idea appears twice in Cvm ..

Cloten (2 .3»7i) rellects that gold corrupts and 
Arviragus saysj 

All gold and silver rather turn to dirt! 

As »ti3 no better reckon’d but of those 

Who worship dirty gods, ( Gym ..^.6.^4) 

This view may or may not have been personal with 
Shakespeare. It is contradicted in a sense by lago’s 
'*Put money in my purse (0th.,I.3.339 )lago’s 
cynical philosophy is of a piece with his character. 

At any rate the idea that gold is a source of evil is 
sufficiently commonplace that many more references would 
be necessary to establish a.ny unusual repudiation of 
material wealth on Shakespeare’s part. 

Shakespeare’s ideas on nature, on superstition, 
fate» time, death and his criticism of fashion would seem 
to be notions he shared with the rest of his contempor¬ 
aries. His attitude to war is probably that of his time 
with reservations. That is, he is sufficiently 
influenced by the wave of patriotism that reached its 
peak about the time of the defeat of the Armada to write 
things like Gaunt’s speech in Rich.II . or that of the 
Bastard at the end of and he takes war for granted 
as one of life’s phenomena, but at the same time he has 
the sensitive man’s disgust at the cruelty and brutality 
of war, and the shrewd observer’s penetrating insight 
into the sophistry and cant behind the exalted speeches

of its heroes. The dislike of affected manners and 
speech and hlo preference for quiet women reveal more 
of his personal tastes. His condemnation of gold is 
not sufficiently strong to indicate his own views, but 
he certainly does not satirize greed as consistently as, 
for example, Jo .naon, and does not seem to be much 
concerned with the economic problems engendered by the 
rising oomiiiercial and industrial'classes. On the whole 
the evidence would seem to place Shakespeare as a man 
of his time, not going beyond it in philosophical or 
social notions.

CHAPTiSR VI 

SHAKESPSARS AND THIS THEATRE 

Shakespeare’s literary criticism is to be found 
rather in his parodies of various styles than in 
discussion in the text. Similarly he gives very little 
direct indication of his own critical ideas about dramat 
but something can be learnt of his attitude to the 
theatre and his ideas about acting. 

He is conscious of the limitations of the 
Elizabethan theatre. In the rustic’s play in MNP ..^.1. 
the crude attempts of Bottom and his friends to get 
realism by presenting everything rather than leave 

anything to the imagination of the audience are held up 

' ? ■ 

for our laughter. Shakespeare relies on the imagination 
of his audience to supply the deficiencies of stage¬ 
craft. He was probably as impatient as Jonson with the 

necessity to present history 

with three rusty swords, 

And help of some few foot-and-half-foot words, 

or with the "creaking throne" com ing down "the boys to 

please" and the "roll’d bullet heard, to say it thundems"

\nd time that is so briefly spent 
With your free fancies quaintly eche: 

(Peri.,3.Prol.) 

Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre... 

.....The unboivi event 

I do commend to your content: 

Only I carried winged time 
Past on the lame feet of my rime; 

V/hich never could I so convey 
Unless your thoughts went on my v/ay. 

(Peri.,4, Prol.) 

Thus time we waste, and long leagues make 
short; 

Sail seas in cockles, have, and wish but 
for’t; 

Making-to take your imagination- 

From bourn to bourn, region to region... 

Like motes and shadows see them (the actors) 
move a while; 

Your ears unto your eyes 1*11 reconcile. 

(Peri.,4.4.Iff.) 

In your supposing once more put your sight 
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark: 

' Where what is done in action-more, if might- 

Shall be discover*d$... 

(Peri*,5* Prol.) 

Imagination mst supply the defects of acting also 

The best in this kind are but shadows; and 
the worst are no worse, if imagination mend 
them. .(I0P.*5>1,213) 


Shakespeare i^fond of the comparison of actors to 

shadows. We have met it already in Peri .,4.4.21-2. 

Compare with this. 

If we shadows have offendfed 
Think but this and all is mended 
That you have but slumbered here 
While these visions did appear.

iilfe'3 but a walking shadow, a poor player, 

(Macib.,5.5.24) 

these our actors, 

As I foretold you, were all spirita and 
Are melted into air, ( Temp ,,4,1,148) 

There are many sidelights on actors in the plays 
the unperfect actor "who with his fear is put beside his 
part (Sonnet 2^,2)” or the dull one who f^^gets his 
( Cori ,i5>3>4Q), the ”without-book prologue faintly spoke 
after the prompter (gJ#, 1.4,4,)« or the prologue by the 
fellow who "does not stand upon points ( Mill) , , 5,1,117) " 
and the audience, gaping and pointing (XJ,,2,1,37^). 
or still looking after the star perfonner, paying no 
attention to the unfortunate actor who enters next 
( Rioh..II, .5.2.2^), 

Shakespeare is always magnanimous toward amateurs 

Sport best pleases that doth least know how, 

(ILL.,^,2,^00) 

For never anything can be amiss, 

When simpleness and duty tender it,,,. 

The kinder w© to give them thanks for nothing. 
Our sport shall be to take wiiat they mistake: 
And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect 
Takes it in might, not merit. 

,5.i.82ff) 

So Cleopatra says: 

And where good will is showed, though*t come 
too short. 

The actor may plead pardon. (AC. ,2,5*8,) 

This thought is always associated with acting. 

Less tolerance is shovm toward over-acting.

ThiJ3 whole passage is extra-dramatic, and though not out 

of character for Hamlet, is too long in proportion to it 

importance in the drama. It is Shakespeare the producer 

and director voicing his own tastes. In TC. there is a 

description of a 

Strutting player, whose conceit 
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich 
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound 
’Twixt his stretched footings..... 

(TG.,1.3.153) 

”Such to-he-^pitied-and o’erwrested seeming (TG. .1.3.157) 

Shakespeare holds in contempt. 

I find no repetitions elsewhere, however, of 

Hamlet’s oonteBipt for the groundlings, ‘’capable of 

nothing hut inexplicable dumb-shows and noise ( Ham. . 

3.2.13)** unless the admonitions of Gower in peri , to the 

audience to ”Be quiet then, as men should be ( Peri .. 

2.Proli 5)** reference to their behaviour. We 

have seen (Chapter'nj,p. / 74 ) that Shakespeare’s 

development of the part of the foolj follows naturally 

from the condemnation expressed by Hamlets 

And let those that play your clovms speak no 
more than is set down for them; for there be 
of them that will themselves laugh, to set 
on some quantity of barren spectators to 
laugh too; though in the meantime, some 
necessary question of the play be then to be 
considered: that’s villainous, and shows a 
most spiteful ambition in the fool that uses 
it. ( Ham .,3.2.42) 

Since he must have fools Shakespeare writes a definite

part for them and integrates them with the rest of the 

drainr', 

^'layers to Shakespeare are the "abstract and brief 

chronicles of the time (Ham, ,2,2,$48)", and he is a 

staunch upholder of the dignity of their profession. In 

the induction to TS, the players are welcomed warmly. 

The lord gives insti’uctiona that they be well lodged. 

He recalls the last time he saw them and asks for a 

performance. They are, of course treated as social 

inferiors, and taken to the Inittery, but special emphasis 

is placed on their welcome: 

Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery 
And give them friendly welcome everyone; 

Let , them want nothing that ray house afforda 

(TS,,Xnd,,1.102) 

The similarity is striking between this scene and that 

where Hamlet welcomes the players to Elsinore. Hamlet 

is, if anything, more effusive than the lord, like him 

welcomes them individually, recalls the last time he saw 

them and he too asks for a performance to fit in with a 

preconceived plan of his own. The scenes are similar 

even in slight details. For example, the lord fears the 

players will mock Slys 

But I am doubtful of you^ mode sties 
Lest, over-eyeing of his odd behaviour 
For yet his honor never heard a play- 
You break into some merry passion 
And so offend him; (^. Ind , >1.94) 

and Hamlet, sending the players after Polonius, cautions 

them;

Look you mock him not 


230. 

(Ham.,2.2.571) 


Since Hamlet has himself just been mocking him, the 
apparent inconsistency may be due to a recollection of 
the previous scene, but it may be explained as Hamlet's 
apology for hiB own mockery or as a warning to the players 
not to follow his example since they have not his position 
to excuse license, or it may be an incitement to mockery. 


The passage in Ham , is oven more insistent than T3. on 
the welcome to be given the players: 

Ham.-Good my lord, will you see the players veil 

bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; 
for they are the absti'act and brief chronicles 
of the time: after your death you were better 
have a bad epitaph tiian their ill report while 
you live. 

rai.-l»y lofd, I will use them according to their 
desert. 

Ham. -God's bodykins, man, much better.Use 
them after your own honor and dignity; the 
less they deserve, the more merit is in your 
bounty. ( Ham »2.2.5^5t‘f) 

The emphasis on this point is such thfit we may imagine 

Shakespearej who had gone on tour himself and knew how 

travelling players might be used at the castles of the 

great, putting in a good word for the dignity of his 

profession. 

ohsikespeare keeps the smell of grease paint for 
the most part out of his plays. Lxcept for the famous 
passage in Ham» . about the **aery of children(2.2.352-79)”, 
there is little theatrical gossip or discussion of 
purely theatrical matters. He is concerned with larger 
issues. He does show us in Hen.Y. and ?eri » his sense 


of the limitations of the medium he works in. He betrays

hio preference for restraint and realism in acting and 
his tolerance of amateurs. He has a strong sense of the 
importance of acting as a profession and of the theatre, 
Shakespeare never seems to distinguish in his own mind 
the siiadowy world of the theatre and the real world 
which after all is only a dream and ends in nothing. 

We have seen him comparing actors to shadows, and the 
play to a dream. How closely hound up were his ideas on 
life and on the theatre is illustrated by a passage in 
T emp .; 

Our i^evele now are ended. These our actors 
I foretold you, v/ere all spirits and 
Are melted into air, into thiii airt 
And, like the baseless fabric of this vision. 
The cloud-capped tov/ers, the g,or^':ou8 palaces 
The solemn temples, the great globe itself, 
Yea all which it inherit, shall dissolve 
And, like this insubstajitial pageant faded. 
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff 
AS dreams are made on, and our little life 
Is rounded with sleep, ( Temp ,,4,1,148) 

The ’great globe* is the theatre but it is also the 

world, and one is as unreal smd impermnent as the other 

The coraparison of the world to a stage comes constantly 

and naturally to his mind (See Chapter• At the 

time of writing ..\YLX , the new a lobe Theatre was about to 

be opened. Its motto was Totus mundus agit histrionem t 

•All the world plays the actor*, and the speech in 

AYLI ,,2,7,139, ” All the world*s a stage etc," was 


probably intended to remind the audience of this fact 














232. 

Indeed it ie likely that Shakespeare had suggested the 
motto and even the name of the theatre, since the idea 
was an old one with him. The reference in Ham , to the 
children who carry it away "Hercules and. his load too 
(2.2.378)" is thought to allude to the si^^ of the Globe 
which represented Hercules holding up the world. The 
theatre is in a sense Shakespeare’s world. It is a 
world of imagination, pf shadows, but it is a reflection 
of the great outside world, it holds the mirror up to 
nature, and for that matter, ’all the world’s a stage*, 
life is a shadow, a poor player, and insubstantial as a 
theatrical presentation, will^dissolve away.

CHAPTJSR VII 

SOME HABITUAL LITERARY CONCEPTS 

This chapter will not attempt to examine all the 
literary echoes in Shalce speare. Many of these, 
particularly in the early plays, belong to the stock in 
trade of all Elizabethan poets and sonneteers. Some 
of these common similes and conceits have been listed 
in the appendix. There are hov/ever certain poetic ideas 
which recur with unusual persistence or which are 
particularly striking or original, and it is these which 
we shall trace as they appear and reappear through out 
the plays. 

We have just seen that Shakespeare thinks of life 
in terms of the stage so that it is not surprising to 
find that one of his favorite coiiiparisons is that of 
the world to the stages 

All the world’s a stage, 
And all the men and women merely players. 

(AYLI.,2.7.139) 

By no means new in AYLI .. this thought had appeared as 
early as Sonnet. 15> Rich.Il ..3*2.l64, 2Hen.IV .»1«1.155> 


Closer to the passage in AYLl . is MV.,1.1.77s 













234 . 

I hold the world but as thw world, Gratiano; 

A stage where every man must play a part, 

And mine a sad one. 

Lear talks of ”this great stage of fools (4.6.l87)»*, and 
there are two references in Macb ..one in 2.4.5 and the 
other Macbeth* s 

Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player 
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage 
And then is heard no more: (5*5•24) 

There is one last example in WT.,5*1»58 besides the 

rather veiled reference cited from Temp ..4.1.148. 

The famous speech of Macbeth from which we have 
not quoted, represents the culmination of several of 
Shakespeare’s favorite figures of speech. Life had beoi 
compared in iQT. , 3 . 4.108 to a ’twice told tale vexing the 
dull ear of a drowsy man*. Here it is "a tale told by 
and idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing 
( Macb #.5»5*26)**♦ The *®out, out, brief candle” of this 

speech has a long history. Life is often thought of as 
a candle, lamp or torch and old age and death as the 
guttering of the candle or going out of the light. 

This simile comes in without any special vividness in 
3Hen.VI ..2.6.1. IHen.y.. 2.5.8. 122. There 

is a conceited expression of the idea in Hich#II ..1.3.221. 
It reappears briefly in 2Hen.IV ..1.2.175# in AY/W ..1.2.58 
and Peri.,I Prol.l5. But it reaches a higher levels 
becomes more vital, in things like Othello* s "Put out the 














235 . 

light, and then put out the light (0 th ,,$,2,7)”» and 
Antony* s 

Since the torch is out 

Lie down and stray no farther: (AC,.4«14,46) 
Which Cleopatra echoes in 4,15.85: 

Our lamp is spent, its outI 
and in KL..4.5.40: 

My snuff and loathed part of nature should 
Bum itself out. 

Another favorite idea which reaches its culmination 
point in Mach ., is that of the murderer washing his hands. 
The commonplace idea of the murderer* s hands being stained 
with blood appears frequently, eg. KJ..3.1.240ff,. 
Rich.II ..2,l,l82ff,, £G.,3.1.105, SL,,3.2.52, Cym,. 

5.5.^ s-nd more strikingly where Macbeth feels his secret 
murders sticking on his hands ( Macb. .5.2,17). The vanity 
of trying to wash the blood of murder from one*s hands 
had appeared many times before Macb .. In Rich,III , the 
second murderer says: 

How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands 
Of this most grievous guilty murder done. 

(1.4,279) 

See also Rich,III ..4,1.68. IHen.IV ..^.2,136. Gym..5.5.48, 

Bolingbroke in Bioh.II , has the same thought (3.1.?.» 

5.6.50•) Claudius in Ham , asks: 

What if this cursed hand 
Were thicker than itself with brother’s blood. 
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens 
To wash it white as snow? (3.3.4-3)

236. 

So too Lady Macbeth is confident that **a little water 
clears us of this deed (Maxb. ,2.2.67) **, "but as Claudio 
finds he cannot absolye himself so easily, so Macbeth 
when he asks: 

Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this 

blood 

Clean from my hands? 
answers himself: 

no, this my hand will rather 
The multitudinous seas incarnadine. 

Making the green one red. (Ma^,2.2*6o) # 


# The story of Pilate vainly washing his hands doubtless 
suggested these metaphors, and appears also in Rich.II, , 
4.1.239ff. but in connection with the deposition oi^ a 
king: 

Not all the water in the rough rude sea 
Can wash the balm off from an anointed king. 

Nor can it cleanse Hero in MAAIT . from the stain of 
calumny (4.1.141). See also T.And .,4.2.102.4.7*111.. 
and AC..2.7.105. 


The conception of the murderer wading in blood is 

another obvious image which Shakespeare transfigures. 

Being o’er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep. 
And kill me too.# (MNL. . 3.2.48) 


# The other references to ’wading in blood’ support 
Coleridgete* suggestion that the reading here should be 
•knee deep*, which might easily be corrupted to ’the’ 
deep. 


But I am in 

So far in blood, that sin will pluck on sin: 
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye. 

( Rich.III ..4.2.64) 

I am in blood 

Stept in so far, that, should I wade no more. 
Returning were as tedious as go o’er. 

( Maob..3 .4.1^6) 































237. 

To Shakespeare there seems to have been an effect 
of horror about the striking of a bell at midnight. 
According to King John the proper atmosphere for places 
of murder would be when 

the midnight bell 

Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth 
Sound one into the drowsy ear of night; 

)KJ*t3.3.4-2) 

(cf. MKD .. 5.1.370 /'The iron tongue of midnight hath 
tolled twelve). In Qth . an alarm is rung during the 
fracas at night, and Othello insists it be silenced lest 
it frighten the islanders ( 2 . 3 * 175 ). The bell rung on 
the discovery of the murder of Duncan is called a 
“hideous trumpet (Macb., 2 . 3 . 86 )” and in Ham , the ghost 
appears “ the bell then beating one (1.1.39)**. # 

# Son.7X. and 2Hen.iy ..1.1.102. 

There are a group of passages related to the sea. 

Hioh.III . Clarence, describing his dream to the prison 

warden, tells of the jewels on the ocean beds 

Some lay in dead men^s skulls, and, in those 
holes 

V/here eyes did once inhabit there were crept, 
AS *twere in scoa^ of eyes, reflective gems. 
Which woo’d the slimy bottom of the deep. 

And mock’d the dead bones that lay scatter’d 
by. ( 1 . 4 . 29 ) 

It is impossible to say why this picture of jewels in 
skulls at the bottom of the ocean should liave haunted 
Shakespeare’s mind. That it did so, is evident from 











r- V. 

’-4 '

fragmentary reminiscences throughout the plays: 

And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep 

( 3 . 1 . 161 ) 

And make her chronicle as rich with praise 
AS is the ooze and bottom of the sea 
With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries. 

( Hen.V. . 1 . 2 . 16 ^) 

In Peri . Tliaisa is thrown into the sea in a chest 
containing jewels. It is a long cry in poetic develop¬ 
ment from Clarence’s dream to the Temp .. but the 
essential idea had been present all along in Shakespeare 
and when he writes: 

Full fadom five my father lies; 

Of his bones are coral made; 

Those are pearls that were his eyes; 

( Temo l.1.2.396) 

The whole image has suffered ”a sea-change into something 
rich and strange”. 

The other sea pictures Shakespeare repeats are 
from the point of view of a shore-gazer. The ship-boys 

climbing the masts suggested to him the insecurity of 

?■ 

those who live on the favor of the great, 

like a drunken sailor on a mast. 
Ready at every nod, to tumble down 
Into the fatal bowels of the earth. 

( Rich.III ..3.4.100) 

2Heh.IV. . 3 . 1.18 the same image is reiterated in 
connection with the cares of kingship and the sound sleep 
of the humble, this time v/ith no explicit .mention of 
dJTunkenness; 











239 


Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast 

Seal up the shy-boy* s eyes, and rock his brains 

In cradle of the rude imperious surge 

And in the visitation of the winds 

Who take the ruffian billows by the top. 

The ship-boys climbing in the rigging are seen again in 

HeiuV.,3 Prol. 

Shakespeare is fond of describing an argosy 
embarJting: 2.1.125, M2**l*l*8* In Hen.V . the 

description of the departure of the ^Inglish fleet is 
given from the point of viaiv if the watcher on the shore. 
Compere with these TC., 1.1.107* 

The white cliffs of England suggest to Sha.kespeare 
the conceit that the shore is pale-faced (KL. ,2.1.23). 
which in Hen.V , is stretched to the thought that the 
shores of England and France are pale with envy of each 
other (5*^*378)* England is often compared to a foJ'trass 
with the sea as moat or walls 

that England, hedged in with the main 
That water-walled bulwark, still secure 
And confident from foreign ourposes, 

(^.,2.1.26) 

This fortress isiilt by nature for herself 
Against infection and the hand of war; 

This precious stone set in the silver sea, 

Which serves it in the office of a wall. 

Or as a mo^t defensive to a house, 

Avgainst the envy of less Appier lands; 

> ’ ( Rich.II ..2.1.4'^) 


In Austria talks of 

that whiteffaced shore 
'^vhoae foot spurns back the ocean’s roaring 
tides, 

And coops from other lands her islanders,- 

(KJ*»2.1.23)

Hichall , we have: 

England, bound in with the triumpiiant sea, 

Whose rocky shore beats back the envious

the island appears in KJ.,5.2. 34-5 and IHen.IV ..^.1.44. 

A.3 late as Cym . we get a return to this imagery in the 
queen’s speech;

There are a surprising number of repetitions of the

fire ( 4 . 5 . 58 )". Compare Ham ..1.3.50" the primrose path 
of dalliance" and Falstaff’s reference to Randolph’s 
nose as "an everlasting bonfire-light ( IHen.IY ..3.2.47)". 
The passage in Macb. . seems to be a combination of all 
the previous expressions of the idea. 

Miss Spurgeon has collected the many illustrations 
of the idea that guilt is a heavy load, and that one’s 
sins "sit heavy on (the) soul ( Rich.III ..5.3.152)".

To emphasize deep passion, horror or affliction 
Shakespeare often refers to the last judgment. A

or the final doom is called upon to send all things, as

{ Rich*III **l*2*4) 

Rich*II has the picture of God “mustering in his

These two passages anticipate Lear’s terrible curse 
upon Goneril: 

Dry up in her the orgaiis of increase;

Most curses call down plagues and pestilence stored up 

in heaven ready to fall upon the victims. 

If heaven have any grievous plague in store 
Sxceeding those that I can wish upon thee, 

0 , let them keep it till thy sins be ripe. 

And then hurl down their indignation. 

( Rich.III ..1.^.2l8ff) 

All the stored vengeance of heaven fall 

On her ingrateful topi.... 

..Infect, her beauty 

You fen^aucked fogs , drawn by the powerful 

sun 

To fall and blast her pride. 

(S;.,2.4.l64ff.) 

Shakespeare, as an Englishman, has naturally many 
references to the fact that the south is always cloudy 
or rainy, the source of fogs and contagious air: 

2Henj;VI., 3 . 2 , 384 , RJ.,1.4. 103 , AY'LI ..3.5.^0. Corl .. 

Gym., 4 . 2 . 349 . Constant mention of fogs and 
diseases resulting from damp gives a particularly 
English flavor to his curses. Plagues and infections 
are thought of as hanging in the air, especially in 
fogs and mists, ready to infect the recipient of the 
curse: 


Blasts and fogs upon thee. 

(^ 4 ., 1.4.321) 


Now all the plagues that in the pendulous 
air 

Hang fated o*er men^s faults light on thy 
daughters.

plagues s

245 


The rotten diseases of the south ete*.*..** 

~TtcT7^1.20) 

In their curses at least Shakespeare's Greeks and Romans 

are English, People are cursed with plagues and diseases 

in T,Ath ,,1,1»249> 4*1,21, and ,2,5*6l, Coriolanus 

curses the retreating Romans: 

All the contagions of the south light on you, 
*••••••••••••••.Boils and plagues 

Pliister you all o'er. (Cori., 1.4.30) 

Volumnia* says: 

the hoarded plagues e* the gods 
Requite your love. ( Cori ..4.2.11) 

In Cym . Cloten exclaims: 

The south fog rot him. 

(Cori.,2.3.135) 

Caliban's curses echo the same phrasing: 

As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed 
With raven's feather from unwholesome fen 
Drop on you bothl A south v/est blow on ye 
And blister you all o'er. 

( Temp ..1.2.321) 

All the infections that the sun sucks up 
From bogs^ fens, flats, on Prosper fall 
and make him 

By inch-meal a disease. ( Temp ..2.2.Iff) 

This style of cursing is not confined to anyone type of 
character nor to any particular situation. 


The contrary idea implying blessing in the pwrging of 
the air of pestilence is seen in TR.,1.1.20 and WT., 
5-1.168 “ ~ 


As has been said this chapter does not pretend to 





















246 . 

be a complete treatment of literary echoes in Shakespeare. 
It does however indicate some of the similes and 
comparisons which constantly recur to Shakespeare*s 
mind, which he sought to express over and over again, 
usually gaining in vividness and dramatic pov/er. The 
development of his images and literary conceptions seems 
to be, as Mr. Ryland'^s says^a progress from conceit to 
metaphor. # The change is hearly always in the direction 

# Rylands, OB. cit ^ p.lOl. 

of greater compression and suggestiveness, from things 
likes 

Here burns my candle out; aye, here it dies. 

( ^en.VI ..2.6.1.) 

to the dramatic vitality of Othello’s ‘’Put out the 
light, and then put out the light (0th.,5*2.7 )**f or 
Macbeth’s “Out, out, brief candle (5*5*23)”, or from 
the description in Clarence’s dream to the suggestive 
brevity of "those are pearls that ?/ere his eyes.

CHAI TER VIII 
DRA.MATIC IDBA3, 

In dealing with repeated dramatic ideas in 
Shakespeare I shall confine the discussion to closely 
similar scenes and situations. Repeated traits or 
types of character, or recurring situations, unless 
accompanied by verbal echoes or very striking repetitions 
will not concern this discussion. What we are seeking 
are those dramatic concepts which were of permanent 
interest to Shakespeare and which he develops and 
cultivates. He often expresses an idea directly before 
using it dramatically. Some situations which had 
particular appeal he repeats, sometimes developing, 
sometimes dondensing. The repetition of a dramatic idea 
may be due, and often is, to similarity of theme, - many 
of the stock devices and situations of romantic comedy 
of necessity turn up again and again, the history plays 
echo each other, and there is a community of ideas in 
the Roman plays. Some anticipations allow us to trace 
the development of a character, or particular scene^ or 
often of an entire play in Shakespeare* s mind, and reveal

him recalling and working in details and suggestions 
from works written sometimes many years earlier* Where 
verbal echoes strengthen a probable connection between 
tv70 plays or a group of plays, or where they occur in 
conj^unction with a dramatic relationship, they have been 
noted* Other verbal repetitions may be found in the 
appendix* 

A,* Recurring Scenes » 

The idea that ”the nature of bad news infects the 
teller (^C*, 1*2*99)illustrates admirably the recurrence 
of a dramatic conception for it becomes a stock device 
with Shakespeare. Messengers in Shakespeare are nearly 
always blamed for the nature of the tale they bring, 
sometimes even before they tell it, or when they bring 
good news* In 2Hen*VI *, 3*2*;^9 Henry rates Suffolk for 
bringing the news of Gloucester's death, and in ^Hen.VI .. 
4 *1*86 the messenger aska pardon before daring to unfold 
his story* So does Balthasar when he brings the news of 
Juliet’s death to Romeo (HJ*,5*1*22)• In Rich*IIX * * 
4*4*500ff. messengers enter in rapid succession each 
adding another blow to Richard’s cause* Finally an 
unfortunate appears and ims hardly time to begin his 
report before Richard turns on him: 

Out on you, owlsI nothing but songs of death? 

( He striketh him) 

Take that until thou bring me better news. 

(R ich*II !*.4*4.t?QQ)

When the jueaaen^er finally gets in a \iJord and Richard 

firivis it is favorable» he pardons liim* Salisbury in 

KJ3.1.36-*42 and the gardener in Kich,ll ,. ^,1,7^-lQl 

are bl^^ed for the nature of their tidings and there is 

a hint of this theme in Rioh»Il «^2»2,76» The messenger 

afraid to tell bad jnev/s may indicate it by his anxious 

looks, or by shaking his head: ' ^Hen,VI > .2.1«4^, KJ, , 

3,1.21-6, P.lch.II ..^.2.1<j2ff.. In the scene in 2Hen.l¥ . 

where l^orton brings the news of Percy’s death to his 

father Northumberland, the messenger problem is disnussed. 

Northumberland begins; 

Yea, this man’s brcnv, like to a title-leaf, 
Foretells the nature of a tragic volume; 

(1.1,60-1) 

and goes on to elaborate poetically in 11.68-81, Surely 

no one v/ould be likely, having guessed, as Northumberland 

has, that his son is dead* to launch immediately into a 

poetic reflection about Priam etc... He v/ould demand 

confirmation of his fears, and details; but ShaJcespeare 

wants to emphasize a point he is interested in and is 

too immature a dramatist here to do it dramatically, as 

he was to do later in AC. for example. Still assuming 

the worst and without receiving definite details, 

Northumberland goes on; 

He that but fears the thing he would not know 
Hath by instinct knowledge from other’s eyes 
That what he fear’d is chanced. (l.l.Sjff) 



















250. 

Yet he, like Constsince and Cleopatra, begs to be told 

he is wrong in his surmise. Then he continuesi 

Thou shakest thy head and holds’t it fear 

or sin 

To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so; 

The tongue offends not that reports his death 
And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, 

Hot he which says the dead is not alive. 

Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news 
Hath but a losing office, and his tongue 
Sounds ever after as a sullen bell. 

Remember’d tolling a departing friend. 

(1.1.95) 

Ross in Macb . excuses himself: 

Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, 
*^'hich shall possess them with the heaviest 

sound 

That ever yet they heard.(4.3.201) 

There is a typical messenger scene in the last act of 
Macb * where the great regicide, cornered and at bay, for 
the moment loses his control and snarls at the messenger 
who tells of seeing Bimam wood moving, calls him ”liar 
and slave** but does not strike him {5.5.30ff)# Closer 
to the scene in Rich.XII . is the passage a little, earlier 
where Macbeth drives out a servant with curses for 
showing fear (5.3.11^'f•) . All these previous scenes are 
sujmned up and incorporated in the messenger scene in 
AG,.,2.5.23ff.. Cleopatra does not let the messenger 
speak two vfords before jumping to the conclusion he 
brings bad nev/s,* ’’Antonius dead'* (cf. Rich.III. ,4.4.509). 
Then she says if he will tell good tidings, she will 
give him gold. Then we have the idea that people say

the dead are well, which appears also in the correspond¬ 
ing scene in ^.,5.1.17^^^. Cleopatra then notices his 
expression probably indicating fear* She takes it for 
a token of bad news* 

But there’s no goodness in thy face# if 

Ant ony 

Be free and healthful,-so tart a favor 
To trumpet auc|i good tidingsl If not well. 

Thou shouldst come like a Pury crown’d with 

snakes. 

Not like a formal man* (2*5.37) 

Vi/hen the unfortunate messenger does get out the news 

that Antony has married Octavia, she turns on him: 

Cleo » The most infectious pestilence upon thee I 

( StrilaeB him down ) 

Mess * Good madam, patience* 

Gleo * What say you? Hence, horrible villain’* 

or ’ll spurn thine eyes 
Like balls before me; I’ll unhair thy head: 

( she hales him up and down ) 
Thou siialt be whipp’d with wire, and stew’d 

in brine, 

Smarting in lingering pickle* 

Mess * Gracious madam, 

I that do bring the news made not the match* 

Cleo * Say ’tis not so, a province I will give thee,*** 

(Compare this with Constance who urges Salisbury to say 

his news is not true, ^*, 3.1.4-*ff) * finally Cleopatra 

draws a knife and the messenger runs away* tut he is 

induced to return: 

Gleo* Come hither, sir* 

Though it be honest, it is never good 
To bring bad news: give to a gracious message 
An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell 
Themselves when they be felt***.* 

Mess* Should I lie, madam? 

Gleo* 0, I would thou didst, 

So half my Egypt were submerged and made

The notion that bringer of bad tidings will be hated is 

echoed in Gym ,,^,^,27 and WT. ,3»2.144, and the idea that 

the teller’s face discloses the nature of the message in 

^.,3.4,12 and Hen.VIII ..'?.l.l6^. 


Messenger scenes are frequent in the tragedies and 
histories* Shakespeare gets the effect of rapid movement 
of events by having messengers come in one after another. 
In connection with messenger scenes there is another 
detail used twice* The sender in his haste forgets to 
tell the messenger his errand ( Rich,III ,,4,4,443* JG* , 
2,4*1-13)* The messenger who leaves the battle uncertain 
of the issue also appears twice ( IHen*IV » *l*l*^9"*6o and 
Macb*.l,2.1ff,), 


There are a number of scenes where "subtle masters,, 
♦**Btir up their servants to an act of rage And after 
seem to chide ’em (£C*|2,1*17?)"• There is a hint of this 
in Rich.III ,*1,4,261: 

he ths't set you oh 

To do this deed will hate you for the deed, 
and again in Rich.III ,*3,5*52, The situation is 
dramatized in the relations of Hubert and John. John 
comments: 


It is the eurse of kings to be attended 
By slaves that taste their humors for a 
warrant 

To break within the bloody house of life;

4nd on the winking of authority, 

To understand a law; to know the meaning 
Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frown 
More upon humor than advised respect. 

(y[.,4.2.208) 

JSxton in Rich.II . is one such, who interprets the king’s 

remark and glance (5»4.1ff) as ’warrant* to murder ' 

Richard and he is repudiated ( Rich.II .. 5«6. ^0«42) . 

According to Hardin Craig, 

There is no mention of Henry’s repudiation 
of Sxton in any of the Chronicles . Daniel, 
Civil Wars . lll,79f ^ vague parallel. 

H. Craig, p.5^7 ri* 

Shakespeare evidently either adds this on his own, or 
expends a suggestion because the situation appea Is to 
him. In a similar incident is arrested in its 
development because the servant tells his master his 
intention before acting, and the latter is bound in 
honor to prevent him, at the same time admitting that he 
would have profited by the deed. {2.7.42ff). See also 
CYm «,5*l»5 for a slight parallel. 

Shakespeare has three repetitions of the situation 
in which a character blames others for not stopping him 
from committing a crime or an injury. Edward IV. in 
Rich.III ..2.1.106 has a long ranting speech on this, 
occasioned by the introduction of Derby to ask pardon 
for a servant, an irrelevant incident obviously used to 
lead up to Edward’s rhetoric. King John blames ^be^^^

254 . 

Hadst thou hut shook thy head, or made a 
pause, 

When I spake darkly what I purposed 

Or turn’d an eye of douht.»..( KJ. .4.2.2^!) 

A similar situation in Rich.II . wrings from Gaunt, who 
has been leaning over backwards to be impartial, the 
exclamation: 

Alas, I looked when some of you should say, 

I was too strict to make mine own away; 

But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue 

Against my will to do myself this wrong. 

( Rich.II ..!.^.24^) 

The si@ne in which the wife, troubled by her 
husband’s perturbation, questions him on the cause is 
also treated three times by Shakespeare* The first 
example in 2Hen.YI. .1.2.Iff. between the Duke and Duchess 
of Gloucester is only a weak anticipation of the lively 
scene in IHen.IV.»2 .3* between Hotspur and Lady Percy. 

The famous scene between Brutus and Portia in JO., 1.1.233ff‘ 
owes much to this earlier scene. 

The scene wherein Galpurnia urges her fears, dreams, 
and superstitions against Caesar’s decision to go to the 
senate is paralleled in a scene between Andromache and 
Hector in TG. .5* 

In ^.,3.1*327 Blanch who is otherwise quite 
colorless, is given a little aria when she finds herseff 
tom between her newly-wedded husband and her relatives, 
when the pati?hed-up peace is about to be broken. 

Which is the side that I must go withal? 

I am with both; each army hath a hand; 

And in their rage I having hold of both

They whirl asunder and dismember me. 

Husband I cannot pray that thou mayst lose; 

Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose... 

Whoever wins on that side shall I lose; 

Assured loss before the match be played. 

The speech is rhetorically balanced and formal and nothing 
results dramatically: she merely subsides and goes with 
Louis. Octavia in is caught in a similar dilemma: 

A more unhappy lady, 

If this division chance, ne’er stood between. 

Praying for both parts: 

The good gods will mock me presently. 

When I shall pray, "0, bless my lord and 

husband.” 

Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud, 

"0, bless my brother I” Husband win, win 

brother, 

Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway 

’Twixt these extremes at all. (AC..^.4.12) 

The passa4;;3s are sufficiently alike to suggest that 
Shakespeare recalled the earlier one in writing AC., but 
the style is more mature and natural, and here, action 
develops out of the situation, Octavia has some 
character and influence on the plot. The passage is not 
just an isolated outburst. 

Shakespeare has three treatments of a situation 
first appearing in TGV.,3.1.137 where the Duke insists on 
seeing a letter and, when he finally gets it, breaks the 
seal and reads, this followed by violent denunciation 
of its owner. The letter motif and mention of the seal 
appears also in TGV . .1.3.4-5. ♦ In Rlch.II .. 5.2.$6ff. 
Aumerle is betrayed by the seal of the paper which 
reveals his villainy Old York, seeing it, demands to

see the writing. An outburst of denunciation follows 
as in TGV* • Much later in ,1,2.28 3dxnund engineers 
a similar situation in which Gloucester sees him wl th a 
letter imoorting Edgar’s supposed guilt, Gloucester 
breaks out "0 villain, villainl” as in the above 
instances. 

Characters in the early plays are fond of kneeling 
to beg a boon and refusing to get up until it is granted. 
In spite of the slight flavor of absurdity Shakespeare 
repeats this in Cg.,5.1,114 and Rich,III ,.2.1,95> In 
Rich.II ,,5,3* he has first Aumerle, then York and then 
the Duchess of York enter, kneel and refuse to rise until 
pardon is granted. Here the absurdity is too strong to 
carry a serious treatment. Although the three suppliants 
are in deadly earnest, Bolingbroke throughout is faintly 
amused and a little embarrassed. When the duchess demands 
entrance he remarkst 

Our scene is altered from a serious thing. 

And now oh. nged to "The Beggar and the King". 

All he gets a chance to say for many lines is "Good aunt, 

stand up", until they finally break off pleading long 

enough for him to grant full pardon to Aumerle, Here X 

think we may see Shakespeare using a stylized, 

conventional formula, a stock device, but not without 

seeing the humorous side of it. 

Banishment scenes in Shakespeare tend to follow a 










257. 

given formula. The exile nearly always has a long lament 
in which he i refers actual death to the living death of 
banishment: see TGV ..3tl.l7Qff.. Kich.III ..1.^. 169 . 

The scene where Romeo receives the news of his banishment 
is tyi:)ical. 


Ha, banishmentI be merciful, say ”death"; 

For exile hath more terror in his look, 

Ik^uch more tJrian death. . 

There is no world without Verone walls, 

But purgatory, torture, hell itself. 
Hence-banished is banisht from the world, 

And world’s exile is death.... 

Thou outt’st my head off with a golden axe 
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me... 

heaven is here 
Where Juliet lives....... 

And say’st thou yet that exile is not death? 
Hadst thou no poison mix’ d, no sharp-grained 

knife, 

No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean 
But ’banished’ to kill me? 

C Friar, the damned use th^t word in hell; 
Howlings attend it;.... 

To mangle me with that v/ord ’banished’. 

(HJ*»3.3.12ff.) 


Compare with 11.17if and earlier passage in 2Hen.VI. . 

3.2.359s 

’Tie not the land I oare^for, wert thou thence; 
A wilderness is populous enough, 

So Suffolk had thy heavenly company: 

For where thou art, there is the world itself. 
With every several pleasoure in the world. 

And where thou art not, desolation. 

Rich.II Mowbray makes an elaborate poetic speech 

comparing banishment to "speechless death", adding to the 

usual idea, the thought that without the use of his 

native language he is tongue-tied. The basic thought 

that leaving all that is familiar and dear is going

from day to night, or lilce the soul out of the body, is 

similar to Romeo*s. There are however repetitions of 

I opposite idea, that 

All places that the eye of heaven visits 
Are to a wise man ports end happy havens, 

I ( Rlch.II .,1,^,275) 

j See Rich,II, ,1.^.145. »3*^»139» WT. , 4 . 4 . 4 . 53 , The 

j increase of travel and transportation facilities 

j doubtless made banishment less of a calamity and the old 

j 

idea *out of my country and myself I go* was naturally 

superceded by the feeling that all places were much the 

same or had compensations, in Rich^ll , we have the 

first example of a new attitude to banisiiment; 

Think not the king did banish thee 

But thou the king ( Rich,II. ,1,^.279) 

How go we in content 

To liberty and not to banishment. 

I banish you;,... 

.Bespising 

Por you, the city, thus I turn my back; 

There is a world elsewhere. 

( Gori ..3.3.121) 

Hote also the verbal similarity in the form of banish-^ 
ment in AYL.l ..l»1.44ff. and 

Shakespeare*3 various treatments of scenes in 
which a oliaracter tries vainly to bring philosophical 
comfort to a grief stricken friend have been noted in 
connection with his ideas on grief (Chapter II}. 

























259 


There is very little community of idea in the 

murder scenes in Shakespeare. Ifurder is followed by 

immediate repentance in 2HeruVI^,3.2.3«4, Hioh.III .> 

1.4.271, 4.3.Iff. find Paoh.II ..5>5.1l5.. The idea of 

murdering while the victim sleeps seems especially to 

have interested Shakespeare, particularly in relation 

to kings. Richard II. when he wants to tell sad stories 

of the death of kings, how some have been deposed, some 

slain in war etc.r touches on this theme,"some sleeping 

killed'*, and the idea is most often found associated 

with kings. The JDuke of Gloucester in Hen.VI . is 

murdered while he sleeps (3«i*263, 3.2.I97) Murdering 

while the victim sleeps is evidently regarded as 

especially cowardly even by professional murders ( Rich. 

III.. 1.4.10IffHernia scornfully accuses Demetrius 

of having basely killed the sleeping Lysander ( MHD. . 

3.2.69ff.). Hyra ms^kes a dark threats 

Men may sleep, and they may have their 
throats about them at that time; and some 
say knives have e^es. ( Hen.V . .2.1.23) 

The former king in Ham .has been murdered sleeping in 

his orchard ( Ham .»L#5.59) * In Macb . there is far more 

emphasis on the fact that Duncan is killed while asleep 

(1.7.61, 2.2.13, 2.3*32.) • "after life’s fitful 

fever he sleeps well*’, while Macbeth in killing him has 

"murdered sleep**. The play is full of the symbolism of 

sleep and the relation of sleep and death (see Chapter 























I 

) 









< H 







26o. 

m, p./^o). The Temp , too shows the connection between 
murder and sleep. Antonio and Sebastian discuss killing 
the King of Naples while he sleeps ( Temp ..2.1.204), and 
Caliban suggests murdering Prospero during his afterdinner 
sleep (3*2.94-). 

In l£AAN ., Benedick says to Claudio, 

j You break as braggarts do their blades, 

I which, God be thanked, hurt not. 

(KA^.,5.1.189) 

This practice of boasters to hack their swords or wound 

themselves to siiaulate a fight iB used more than once in 

Shakespeare* In MV.,5*1*177 Bassanio thinks he had 

better cut off his hand and swear he lost Portia’s ring 

in a fight, Palstaff hacks his sword and persuades his 

comrades to ”tickle (their) noses with spear»grass to 

make them bleed, and then to beslubber (their) garments 

with it and swear it Y/as the blood of true men ( IHen.IV .. 

2,4.l82ff, 334ff)’’, Parolles considers similar measures 

to extricate himself from his promise to recover his 

drum (ATO.,4.1.40). More serious use is made of this 

I idea in Igi* in a passage which nevertheless looks back 

to Palstaff, where Sdmund wounds himself to give a touch 

of realism to his theatricals: 

Some Blood drawn on me would beget opinion 
Of my more fierce endeavor; I have seen 

drunJsards 

1)0 more than this in sport, (2.1,35) 











261 


In Richtll when the queen retires to overhear what 

the gardeners will say^ she remarks: 

They’ll talk of state; for every one doth so 
Against a change. ( Rich.II ..1.4.27*8) 

Shakespeare capitalized on the tendency of the average 

man to discuss state matters in a number of scenes which 

besides showing the ordinary man’s attitude to the events 

which affect the great ones of the realm also comment on 

the drama and introduce plot lines. This gardener scene 

^ good example. A typical citizen scene 

is that in Hi oh.III . 2.3., The same play has a short 

scene in which the scrivener comments on the doings of 

F.fchard’II and Buckingham (3*6*)* We have an admirable 
description of the citizens discussing political events 
in KJ*,4.2.185«In Shakespeare’s treatment of bastards 
there are some dramatic echoes. The bastard Falconbridge 
is a preliminary sketch of some features of the later 
portrait of Sdmund. He carries off his illegitimacy 
with the same nonchalant impudence, though without ,the 
I bitterness of Bdmund. 

I Something about, a little from the right, 

In at the window or else o’er the hatch; 

Who does not stir by day must walk by night 
And hsve is have however men do catch; 

Hear or far off, well won is still well shot; 
And I am I, howe’er I was begot. 

1.170) 

wherefore should I 

Stand in the plague of custom, and permit 















262 


The curiosity of nations to deprive me, 

For that I am some twelve oT fourteen months 
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore 

base? 1.2.2.) 

Each claims he Is as well formed as the legitimate son 

(KL .tl.l.79> 13B and KL., 1.2*7) . Each feels that more 

"composition and fierce quality" went into his engendering 

than in the creation of *a whole tribe of fops" (KJ.. 

1*1.236 and ^.11.2.11)» Both are determined, since 

society brands them with baseness, to f4nd for themselves 

by all means in their power (KJ.,1.1.206 and KL*.1.2.21, 

1.2*195). Compare also these passages: 

Some faults do bear their privilege on earth... 
With all my heart I thank thee for my father: 
Who lives and dares but say, thou didst not 

well 

When I was got, 1*11 send his soul to hell. 

‘(^.,1.1.274-85) 

I cannot wish the fault undone. 

The issue of it being so proper* 

(^.,1*1,17-8) 

The Bastard, however, is an amiable character* We find 
the anticipation of Edmund’s villainy in the treatment 
of the illegitimate Don John in MAAII . .4-.1.19Q. 5*i*257* 


B* Parallels due to similarity of Theme 


The history plays have many scenes, situations, and 
dramatic ideas in common, some of them stock devices of 
the chronicle^play, some of them due to the nature of 
the material handled. For instance councils of war. 










263. 

messenger scenes, addresses to the army etc, are bound 
to appear again and again. Many of the repetitions in 
the histories are merely recapitulations of what has 
gone before or forecasts, usually in the form of 
prophecies, of the course of the next play in the series. 
There are souie verbal echoes in the histories but no 
more tiaan between other plays. 

The bond which unites the Roman plays grows chiefly 
out of the community of ideas regarding suicide which 
Shakespeare associates with Homan philosophy. 

Besides the Roman and the history plays there are 
a number of plays like C£, and and T§, and MAAK ,. 

where a common source and similarity of theme account for 
numerous parallels. These plays often echo each other 
in trivial details or verbal parallels, which show 
Shakespeare recalling an earlier treatment of the same 
theme or which may derive from the common source. 

The romantic comedies are full of repetitions of 
conventional themes such as the girl disguised as a page, 
the lady and her maid discussing the lady’s suitors, 
lovers quarreling over the respective merits of their 
mistresses, etc,, Shakespeare constantly rings the 
changes on these stock devises but since they were 
shared by every Blizabethan dramatist we pass over them 
without going into detail*

C* Ideas Foreahadowinp; Later plays , 

We come now to anticipations some of which may be 
attributed to proximity of date, some like those in 
Rich,III and Macb, to the similarity of the fundamental 
idea in the drama, and some of which are merely 
fortuitous. 

There is no reason for a connection between MV. 

High.Ill . but the murderer's diatribe on conscience 
in Rich.III .,1.4,124-1^7 orobably was a prelude to 
Launcelot Grobbo's speech on conscience (MV. .2.2.Iff.). 

There are a number of parallels between Rich.Ill 

and JC.« Richard says to the citizens when they importune 

him to take the crown, 

If not to answer, you might haply think 
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded 
To bear the golden yoke of soveidgnty 
^/hich fondly you would here impose on me. 

( Rich.III ..1.7.147) 

Caesar, trying like Richard to make it appear the crown is 
forced on him by the people, when offered the crown does 
not answer, and Brutus and others put his hesitation 
down to «tongue-ti0d ambition". Richard and Antony are 
both masters of the arts of fooling the crowd, suid 
Richard's speech to the citizens on the death of 
Hastings {3.5.24) resembles somewhat Antony's on Caesar. 
Cassius in JG. (4.3.10) repeats the histrionics of 
Richard before Anne ( Rich.Ill 1.2.175) offering his

is 

There also a resemblance in the idea of Bemesis turning 
Men's swords against themselves in Rich>III > > 5.1.20-4 and 
JC.t5*3*94-. 

I Plays written within a year or so of each 

[other may expect to betray similarities. This is 
the case with AtfW ,, Iklg. and Heun . all written between 
16 o 1-4, Polonius advice to Laertes ( Ham ,,l,3.58ff) 
finds weaker echo in the Countess* advice to Bertram 
( AW .. 1,1,71). Shakespeare evidently had the 
observations in these passages in his mind but puts the 
best expression of them into the great play. In neither 
case is the passage especially necessary to the drama. 

In gj. and Ham, we have parallels arising out of the 
villain* s finding himself unable to pray. Claudius 
would pray but his guilt and inability to repent prevent 
him: 

My words fly up, my thoughts remain below; 
Words without thoughts never to heaven go, 

( Ham, ,3.3.97) 

So Angelo in MM.; 

When I would pray and think, I think and pray 
To general subjects. Heaven hath my empty 

words, 

Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue, 
Anchors on Isabella: Heaven in my mouth,,,. 

And in my heart the strong and swelling evil 
Of my conception, (MM,.2,4,Iff,) 

mfm"" . ... . . . . .. .... 

Somewhat later Macbeth after the murder of Duncan finds 












he cannot pray; 


I could not Bay ’Amen* 
1ihen they did say God hleeB us 

(Mach.,2. 1 . 29 ) 


There may be an anticipation of the character of 
Coriolanus in the Duke’s description of himself in M.\ 

I love the people 

But do not like to stage me to their eyes; 

Though it do well, I do not relish well 
Their loud applause and aves vehement; 

Nor do I think the man of sage discretion 
That does affect it. (1.1. 67 ) 

A number of plays seem to foreshadow 0th .. This 
play bears some relation to Rich.Ill , in the charactertof 
Richard and lago (compare Rich.III ..I. 2 . 169 .1.^.47ff. 
with 0th., 3 . 3 .375)♦ There is a parallel between 
Rich.III. . 2 . 1.83 and Oth ».5.1»104 where the real villain 
tries to fix guilt on another by callihg attention to 
the other’s paleness. The contrast of the innocent young 
girl and the coarse serving woman, in the scene between 

Desdemona and Emilia ( Qth . .4.3.11ff.) had been itried 

_P 

before in MAAH .. 3>4.245 and vaguely anticipated in the 
relations of the nurse and Juliet in HJ. • In both MAAN . 
and 0 th . an innocent girl is accused of inchas^tity and 
there is similarity of idea but no verbal echo between 
the accusation of Claudio ( MAAK ..4.1.6 q) and that of 
Othello ( 0th ..4.2.47ff)• Both are most shocked by the 
contrast of the beauty of the woman and the foulness of 
her sin. There is possibly a connection to be establi^ed 
between MAAN *. 3«2.21. 5*1«3^ 0 th . .3*3*414. The 














267 


basic ideas of Othello seem to have begun working in 

Shakespeare's mind about the time of TO* The Duke, 

thinking he has been cheated of Olivia, exclaims: 

Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, 
Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, 
Kill what I love?-a savage jealousy 
That sometimes savors nobly, (TN,,5»1»120) 

The idea of killing what one loves, and the thought that 

there is nobility in jealousy, strongly suggest 0 th ,: 

I kissed thee ere I killed thee,,,. 

Nought I did in hate but all in honor, 

(OTH.,5.2.358) 

TC « has more anticipations of 0 th ,: 

No man alive can love in such a sort 

The thing he means to kill more excellently,, 

(TO,,4.1^23) 

Troilus speaks of 

a kind of godly jealousy- 
Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin, 

(TO*,4.4.30) 

And Ulysses describes Troilus in terms reminiscent of 
0 th , ; 

Hot soon provoked, nor being provoked soon 

calm'd,,,,, 

but he in the heat of action. 

Is more vindicative than jealous love, 

(TC., 4 . 5 . 99 ) 

Compare 0 th , t 

Not easily jealous, but being wrought 
Perplex'd in the extreme. (0th,,5*2,345) 

Willow Song and the passage preceding it about 

the maid called Barbara, Shakespeare seems to have had 

in mind the fate of Ophelia: 












m'

and he she loved proved mad 
And did forsake her; she had a song of ’willow’; 
An old thing ’twas, hut it express’d her fortuie. 
And she died singing it s 

Compare Ham ,,4,7 •16?» 

We have seen the hasio ideas in 1^. developing as 

early as AYLI , and some before that. When Shakespeare was 

writing the play he went hack further still. When Lear 

addresses the heavens, 

I do not hid the thunder-hearer shoot 
Uor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove 

(2.4.228-9) 

Shakespeare recalled another grief-crazed father, Titus 
Andronicus, who solicits heaven for vengeance hy shooting 

i 

arrows ”Ad Jovem, Ad Apollinem etc. (T.And ..4.,^.49)% Lear’s ’ 

questioning of his identity (1.#.245) hears verbal 

relationship to Cg,,3*2.72.# The scene in TQV . where the 

# Other instances of doubting one’s own identity occur in 
M*,1,1.203 and TU.,5*1*233 hut the resemblance to Lear 
is not close* 

Duke casts off his daughter Sylvia (3*l*70ff,) seems to 
have furnished verbal suggestions for Lear*s repudiation 
of Cordelia (l,l*110ff•)* is linked with RJ, hy two 
passages, HJ,,1,3,4 (of* |aj.,4,1.27) and RJ,.^.1.119 
(cf.KL* ,4.6*194). The scene in which the mad Lear is 
restored to sanity harks hack to the Induction to TS , 
where the lord and searvants put on an act to convince 
Sly he has been mad and is now restored. The same 
fundamental ideas that sleep will cure madness and 
that music has a soothing

age, is anticipated in T3.,2.1.393 wJiere Gremio says

In addition to the ideas in common between the two 
plays there are dramatic and literary echoes of AYLI « in 
hstar' m Oliver defames Orlando by attributing to him his 
own intended vices and crimes ( ayLI «, 1,1,158ff ) , This is 
a preliminary sketch of Edmund's treatment of Edgar in 
igi.p but there Edmund is given more motivation and his 
working out of the plot is more subtle, V/e have seen 
the idea of the wisdom of fools, strong in AYLI , being 
used to great dramatic affect in KL« Shakespeare even 
takes over a little detail from AYLI,, the attachment 
of the court fool for the princess. Celia says of 
Touchstones 

He'll go along o'er the wide world with me, 

and a knight says of the fool in Lear s 

Since my young lady's going into Erance 

The fool hath much pined away. 

(eL-»l*4..79) 

In TH* in a conqparatively trivial context we have 
the idea behind the fool's conduct in Lear when the clown 
says nonchalantly, as he is sent after the drunken Sir 
Tobys 

The fool shall look to the madman.

When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel

The great number of anticipations of lOi. may be taken to 
indicate that Shakespeare had the play in his mind, 
shaping and pondering it, long before he set it down, 
and also that when he wrote it his mind went back over 
almost all that he had written in search of suggestions 
and material that had proved effective before. 

Macb. is a play based on the same fundamental 
principle as Rich.Ill , and betrays most affinity with 
that play* Both illustrate..i the observation that; 

There is no sure foundation set on blood 

Ho certain life achieved by other's death. 

{M-»^*2.104) 

Hich.III and in Maob * Shakespeare is drawing a 
regicide, motivated by ambition and pushed from murder 
to murder to secure his throne and then experiencing 
profound disillusionment when he finds all has been to 
no purpose* Richard is a much cruder portrait but 
Macbeth echoes him in many particulars* 

I am in 

So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin 

( Rich,III ,.4.2.64) 

I am in blood 

Stepp’d in so far that, should I wade no more. 

Returning were as tedious as go o'er. 

( Maob .. 3.4-.136)

Maob . draws also on RJ., In Meroutio's speech on 
queen Mab we get a picture of the soldier, disturbed in 


his sleep: 


at which he starts and wakes, 

And being thus frightened, swears a prayer 

or two 

And sleeps again. (RJ..1.4.86) 

In Maob. this becomes: 

There’s one did laugh in’s sleep, and one 
cried ’murderl’ 

Tliat they did wake each other. X stood 
and heard them: 

But they did say their prayers, and 
address’d them 

Again to sleep. 

One cried ’God glass us’ and ’Amen’ the other.

In JC . Brutus describes the state of indecision and 
mental conflict:

276 


According to one interpretation, we might say that in 

Ham « Shakespeare is depicting this ’hideous dreaiti* of 

indecision# Certainly he is doing so in the first two 

acts of Mach # One passage is almost echo of the 

above: speaking of the suggested murder of Duncan Idacbeth 

describes it hs a deed 

Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair 
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs. 
Against the use of nature. Present fears 
Are loss then horrible imaginingsi 
My thought, whose muraer yet is but 
fantastical 

Shakes so my single state of man that function 
Is smother’d in surmise, and nothing is 
But what is not# ( Macb ##1#^.1^^) 

The affinity of Macb # with Rich#III is one of idea# This 

parallel with £C# is an example of how an idea works in 

Shakespeare’s mind long before he finally presents it 

dramatically. In the discussion on suicide, we noted 

Macbeth’s references to suicide as ’playing the Roman 

fool’• There is a second link between Macb # and the 

Roman plays# The soothsayer tells Antony: 

Thy demon, the.t’s thy spirit which keeps thee, 
is 

Noble, courageous, high, unmatchable, 

Where Caesar’s is notf but, near him, thy 
angel 

Becomes a fear, as l^ing o’er power’d: 
therefore 

Make space enough between you# ##(AC.a2#3» 
Macbeth referring to Banquo says: 

under him 

My Genius is rebukedf as, it is said, 

Mark Antony’s was by Caesar# 










277. 

Note also the parallel between Maob *.2,3.96 and AC,«4«15. 
66, Maob , was written in l605» in l6c5-6, eo that 
Shakespeare while writing Macb , already had A£# in mind* 
Some of the later plays echo the great tragedies* 
The first part of WT. being an Elizabethan Jealousy play, 
naturally bears resemblances to 0th* Antigonus echoes 
Emilia*3 indignation at the husband’s being deceived by 
some villain (vni*>2,1.141) although in this case there is 
no fundation for the suspicion* In the same situation 
in Gym , Pisanio also echoes Emilia ( Gym ,,3.2*3. 3.4,122), 
Gym . ha.s another echo of the thought behind 0th , where 
Postbxumis saysj 

You married ones* 

If each of you should take this course, 

how many 

Bust murder wives much better than themselves 

For wrying but a little* 

There is possibly an influence from Hamlet in the 
melancholy that overtakes Bamilius because of his mother*! 
dishonor (WT.> 2,3,13 ), We have noted before many 
parallels of idea between and CYm , and a weak echo 
in WT* 4,4*487 of an idea appearing at white heat in 
KL * and Macb, (see Cha-pter 

Relationships between certain plays seem to be 
indicated by verbal repetitions where there is no 
dramatic relationship. For example there is no obeious 
relation between the Hen,IV , plays and Kam,, yet compare

Harry vaulting into the saddle (iHen• IV,, 4.1.110) and

in each case brings the parallel closer. Then Lady Percy 
describes Hotspur: 


he was indeed the glass 

Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves;. 
He was the mark and glass, copy and book, 

That fashi.icned others. (2 Hen.lV ..2.2.l8«»32 ) 

Ophelia applies the come terras to Hamlets 

The glass of fashion and the mould of form,

All things that we ordained festival. 

Turn from their office to black funeral;,... 
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,

(AG.,4.14,2ff.) 


Many more apparently random parallels could be 
cited but the foregoing is sufficient to illustrate the 
way in which plays which have no olivious dramatic 
relation between them may echo each other. 

There are a few other verbal echoes which prove of 
interest. One would expect to find in BJ, sonnet conceits 
such asi 

These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows 
Being black, put us in mind they hide the fair. 

(RJ.,1.1.235) 

but we do not connect the mood of style of with the 
early plays and sonnets. Yet there is a direct echo of 
this conceit in Mr\£.s 



























28o 


as these black masks 

Irocleim an enshield beauty ten times louder 

Than beauty could, displayed, (iflil. ,2.4.8o) 

Similarly the early > liiya are full of the idea of sealing 
the bond of love v/ith a kiss ( TGV . .2.2.7* 

T^.,3»2.126, Rich.II ..1*74-^1 . and again we have the 
same lan^-uage turning up in the song "Take, 0 take those 
lips away** in Of course it may be argued that the 

song v/ae written earlier, oi* that the sonnet conceits 
would be used in songs longer than in dramatic verse. 

But such examples illustrate the danger of using these 
reminiscences as evidence of date since an examination 
shows that they are about evenly divided between echoes 
in plays of close proximity in date and plays written 
many years apart. Where you have already established a 
relationship, they strengthen the probability that 
Shakespeare had an early play in mind; that is all. 

Naturally, however, plays written close together 
in time are likelyHo echo each other. We have the 
shepherd blowing his nails in LLL ..5#2.921 and in 
jySenjVI.,2.^.3. and 2Hen.VX ..3*1»71 is echoed in ggD., 
2.2.84. The idea of calling a person approaching an 
angal with a possible i)un on the meaning of ♦angel’ as 
a coin, had been used in KJ#,5.2.64 and Shakespeare 
recalls it in T^.,4.2.61. There are two close verbal 
echoes between the two Mon. IV . plays. Compare IHen.IV ..

Repetition of Characters . 


Shakespeare often gives us a little character 

sketch and then follows it in a later play with a 

dramatic portrait. In RJ. Mercutio describes 

one of those fellows that when he enters 
the confines of a tavern claps me his sword 
upon the table and says »God send me no need 
of theeP and by the operation of the second 
cup draws it on the drawer, when indeed there 
is no need. (RJ..3.1.^) 

^Hen.IV ».1.2.4 Pistol enters Mrs. quickly’s tavern 

and after some quarreling^5ays; 

Pistol.-Give me some sakk; and, sweetheart, lie 

thou there. 

( Laying down his sword ) 

Come we to full points here; and are 
etceteras nothing?

and a brawl ensues

Then we hare Portia's desoription of her suitors 

Ay, that's a oolt indeed^ for he doth 
nothing but talk of his horse; and he makes 
it a great appropriation to his own good 
parts, that he can shoe him himself* I am 
muoh afeard my lady his mother played false 
with a smith* (MV**1*2,43*) 

A few years later in Hen*V * Shakespeare gives us such 

a fellow in the Dauphin who even writes sonnets to his 

horse as to a mistress (3«7)* 

As early as LIiL* we have an anticipation of 

d 

Autolycus in the pedler who "retails his wares At wakes 
and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs ( LLL * * 5*2* 317)"* 
The talker who 

Hath a mint of phrases in his brain; 

One whom the music of his own vain tongue 
Doth ravish like enchanting harmony..** 

(LLL*,1.1*161) 

is a favorite among Shakespeare’s characters* He 

portrays him in Axmado, in Berowne and in Mercutio, 

& gentleman*..that loves to hear himself talk, 
and will speak more in a minute than he will 
stand to in a month* (HJ«f2.4*155*7) 

Then we have Gratianio who "speaks an infinite deal of 

nothing" and whose "reasons are as two grains of wheat 

hid in two bushels of chaff; you shall seek all day ere 

you find them (MV* , 1.1*114-8)" * Palstaff is another 

such. 


There are two very similar pictures of the justice 


In Hen*V **l. 2*202 we have 










283 


sad-eyed Justice , with his surly hum, 
Delivering o*er to executors pale 
The lazy yawning drones. 


and In AYLI.; 


the Justice 

With eyes severe and beard of formal cut, 
Full or wise saws and modem instances* 

The chief justice in 2Hen*IV * betrays a suggestion of 

this portrait (see 2Hen,IV **l,2110^ff, 173), but It is 

more evident in the Duke in 0th *(1,^*199ff*)* 

The soldier. 


Full of strange oaths and bearded like the 
pard, 

Jealous in honor, audden and quick in quarrel 

Seeking the bubble reputation 

Sven in the oannon^s mouth* ( ATLI * ,2*7*149) 

is dramatized for us in Hotspur and to some extent in 


Hen*V * . 

Tailors were proberbially starved and spiritless, 
**A tailor made thee” was a common expression of contempt 
for an effeminate character* In Shakespeare we have 
Starveling the tailor in MHD * and the poor emaciated 
tailor in TS* (4*2*107)* Shakespeare doubtless was 
thinking of MHD * when depicting “courageous Feeble” the 
tailor among Falstaff’s recruits^when he has Falstaff 
says 

Thou wilt be as valiant as the wrathful dove 
or most magnanimous mouse* 

( 2Hen,IV *,3*2*161)

is an idiot** seems to have been a forerunner of Osrio in 
Ham , who is a fool but "spacious In dirt (5.2.89)“* 

Ifiost old men in Shakespeare are fond of recalling 
the vigor of their youth. Gaunt does it in Hioh.lx ,, 
2.3»99# so does Capulet in RJ . i 

I have seen the 

That I have worn a visor and could tell 
A whispering tale in a fair lady* s ear, 

Such as would pleases ’tis gone, ’tis gone, 

»tis gone. (RJ.,1.5.23) 

Leonato in MAAH . assures Claudio: 

I speak not like a dotard or a fool. 

As under privilege of age, to brag 

V/hat I have done being young, or what would do. 

Were I not old. ( MAAH *.^.1.^9) 

In the portrait of Shallow in 2Hen.IV . Shakespeare makes 

excellent comic use of the old man’s fondness for 

recalling what a gay dog he had been in his youth and 

magnifying the extent of his crop of wild oats. 

Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I have spent I 

( 2Hen.IV ..3.2.365) 

is the constant refrain of his reminiscences ( 2Hen.IV .. 
3.2.15fi** et passim). This characteristic of Sliallow 
continues in MW.,1.1.40, 270 and 2.3.46. Shallow’s 
remark to Paget 

I have seen the time, with my long sword I 
would have made you four tall fellows skip 
like rats. (MWW..2.1.234) 

is echoed in : 

I have seen the day, with my good biting 
falchion 

I would have made them skip. (KL..5»3.276)

old Nestor in TO. shares this characteristic of old 
men (TC.,4.5*204) and so does Polonius ( Ham »»2,2«1Q^). 

There are two types of t^e blunt man in Shakespeare, 
the truly blunt and those who affedt bluntness to cover 
craft* Of the latter type Richard III and Antony in 
JC* are conspicuous examples. Richard protests that he 
is ”too childish-foolish for this world**. He cannot 
flatter^ he is a plain man ( Rich.III. .1.2.169. 1.3.47ff 
142). Yet Richard is one of Shakespeare’s greatest 
showmen, an orator capable of handling the citizens 
as besides himself only Antony can. Antony too insists 
he is a "plain blunt man (JC.,3*2*221)". Bluntness to 
Shakespeare was ordinarily a sign of sincerity but 
these two use it as a pledge of tiuth to cover insincerity. 
So does Falstaff ( MWW ..3.3.76) and lago also. Cornwall 
thinks Kent is of this types 

This is some fellow 

Who, having been praised for bluntness,doth 
affect • 

^ A saucy rougtoess, and constrains the garb 

quite from his natures he cannot flatter, he... 
These kidd of knaves I know, which in 
plainness 

Harbor more craft and more corrupter ends 
Than twenty silly ducking observants 
That stretch their duties nicely. 

(igj.,2.2.101) 

Katherine thinks Petruchio is one who affects bluntness, 

Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behaviour; 

(ts,,3.2.13) 

but Tranio insists he is naturally blunt:

Though he be blunt, I know him passing wisei 
Though he be merry, yet withal he’s honest. 

(3.2.24) 

His rudeness is largely pose, but it is affected from 
humor not malice. So CJasoa in JC. assumes a blunt 
manner not so much to hide craft as for a "sauce to his 
good wit, which gives men stomach to digest his words 
with better appetite (JC«,1.2.300)". 

Then there are others who like Hotspur say sincerely 
tnat they have not well the gift of tongue ( IHen.IV .. 
4,1,6)", but whose vigorous speeches belie them. See also 
IHen.IV ..5.2.78. 92. Othello says he is a soldier, rude 
in speech, not blessed with the soft phrase of peace 
( 0th ..1.3*81) but he is far from at a loss for graphic 
words. Similarly Henry V in wooing Kate apologizes for 
his directness on the,ground that he is a soldier ( Hen.V .. 
5.2,159) yet he is a fine orator. More distinct as 
types of the truly blunt are Kent in Cordelia who 

"cannot heave her heart into her mouth (KL..1.1.93)". 
and Paulina in .. Coriolanus too is of the type who 
cannot flatter and speak fair, cannot stoop to use 
Richard’s and Antony’s means to handle the mob. 

From this study of Shakespeare repetition of 
dramatic ideas or conceptions we can conjecture something 
of his methods of work. We see him handling and 
rehandling certain favorite themes or situations until 












287. 

he finally achieves a dramatic triumph, like, for example, 
the messenger scene in As any dramatist would do he 

j uses over and over again the conventional themes and 
I formulas that all his fellow dramatists used hut tends to 
"break away from these to some extent, though he never 
abandoxsB them. What is more interesting is to see how 
an idea, €in observation about human nature, or a 
significant piece of behaviour may be struck off in 
passing in a play and then a few years later receive a 
fuller treatment. Sometimes the theme of a play may 
recall to mind one he has written previously and he may 
echo his former treatment, sometimes even to unconscious 
repetition of minor details. An excellent example of 
this sort of relationship between plays, which shows 
Shakespeare as a mature dramatist drawing suggestions 
and inspiration from a much earlier and ci^uder work, is 
the case of Eloh.III . and Macb . * Sometimes he seeias 
to have one play in mind while he writes another, when 
there is no apparent reason for the connection. In other 
cases relationship is due to proximity of date. King 
Lear seems to have drawn on plajrs of all periods of his 
development. While it would be dangerous to venture a 
rule in the matter the general impression a study of 
dramatic parallels gives is that Shakespeare let his ideas 
mature gradually in his miiid, and often made many

CONCLUfSION 


This study of recurring: ideas in Shakespeare’s 
plays was undertaken with two ends in yiew; to see what 
indications they would yield of his habitual ideas and 
beliefs, in other words, his philosophy, and what they 
would reveal of his creative processes and his develop¬ 
ment as a dramratist. 

To consider Shakespeare the artist first, the 
examination of his literary echoes was confined largely 
to those images and metaphors which were strikingly 
individual or which he showed particular interest in 
expressing, excluding conventional conceits and similes 
which were common coin. We found that he develops in 
vividness, and intensity, turning elaborate and 
intricate conceit into compressed and striking metaphor 
and gaining in dramatic proptiety and power* When we 

f 

come to his dramatic repetitions, the evidence seems to 
support the conjecture that Shakespeare wrote quickly, 
sometimes carelessly, but only after a play had long 
been shaping itself in his mind* His interest in a 
character or situation may be seen developing through 
various plays, from a passing reference or a brief sketch 
to a full length portrait or an entire scene. Some of 
his great scenes are anticipated by a number of

preliminary sketches. Most often an idea for a scene or 
character catches his interest a play or two before he 
achieves his final presentation of it. Then when 
actually writing the play his mind often goes back to 
previous works for suggestions and details. Often he 
draws on an earlier play of similar theme as Macb . draws 
Rich.III .. but he may recall an ola play for no 
obvious reason. Pla^^^^n date tend to echo each other, 
but not more so than others. Some repeat details from 
plays written many years before, some have echoes from 
the whole range of his works. This is especially true 
of which seems to represent the culmination of scenes, 
situations and dramatic concepts which had been in his 
mind from the earliest beginnings. KJi. also illustrates 
well the way in which Shakespeare betrays his gradually 
maturing conception of a play in those which immediately 
precede it. ^ 

Shakespeare’s works are singularly free from 
theatrical allusions and gossip. While he has a high 
opinion of the drama and the dignity of his profession 
we cannot say that the theatre was more important to 
him than the actual world, for he never really disting¬ 
uishes one from the other, both are shadowy, unreal, 
evanescent. He is not primarily a man of the theatre 
absorbed only in his art. He participated eagerly in 






291 

the intellectual activity of his age. Not an advanced 


scholar like Donne, he shows no sign of having been 
caught in the conflict of religion and science which 
reduced the latter to disillusioned scepticism. His 
beliefs about nature and the universe are those of every 
Slissabetlian layman. Next to nothing can be learned of 
his religious viev/s but there is no hint of questioning 
accepted beliefs. Shakespeare was probably not greatly 
concerned about the after life, content to leave it an 
♦undiscovered country* while he directs his interest 
toward human institutions, the state, and men and women. 
Whatever may have been his personal attitude toward war, 
and there is evidence tliat he was repelled by its 
brutality, he is too much a man of his time, or too mudi 
bounded by the prejudices of his audience to condemn it 
openly. For the most part he ignores the economic and 
social problems arising out of the growth of the new 
commercial classes, and related religious movements, 
which form the background of much of the satire of Jonson 
and others. 

Many of the ideas we find repeated in Shakespeare 
are simply beliefs of his times, superstitions, the 
influence of the stars, etc*. Many, like those on time, 
death, some on sleep, and the cares of greatness, are 
traditional themes upon which all the other poets and 
























'rCfiVc 





292. 

dramatists were improvising variations. His treatment of 
love and friendship, exalting the Platonic ideas of 
friendship over love, is also in the conventional 
Slizabeth8,n manner. 

Other ideas, while not his own in the sense of 
being strictly oxiginai, reveal more of his individual 
turn of mind. Wusic interests him from the earliest 
plays to the end of his career, and his ideas about it 
are remarkably consistent. He associates it constantly 
with sleep. Both music and sleep can sooth mental 
suffering and have curative powers over madness. Madness 
is associated with both sleep and music in other ways: 
lack of sleep is a cause of madness, and the disordered 
mind is compared to discordant music. Shakespeare*s 
notions about the causes, progress, and manifestations 
of madness seem to follow the medical and psychological 
knowledge of the time. It is in the subtlety and 
penetration of his^dramatic treatments of it that he goes 
beyond his contemporaries. About the time of the middle 
comedies Shakespeare, in line with a general tendency of 
the age, begins to betray an interest in melancholy which 
deepens as he approaches Ham. . Going along with this 
concern with melancholy we find expressions of a mood of 
world-?/eariness and longing for death as a release from 
the burden of life, and a discussion of the ethics of 
suicide. This mood arises partly out of the portrayal of

melancholy types, l3ut one may conclude from its 
repetition in the sonnets, and from Shakespeare’s 
evident interest in melancholy, that it was prohahly 
also a personal feeling. It is not however an indication 
of an unusually melancholy temperament for he shares the 
mood with the majority of his contemporaries. Then 
appearing chiefly in AYLI .,KL.. T.Ath ,. and Cym. . is a 
group of ideas whose association seems more definitely 
peculiar to Shakespeare; the pastoral theme, the idea 
that nature is kinder than mankind, the discipline of 
suffering, ingratitude, and the wisdom of fools. The 
relation between them is not a logical one, and seems to 
be the result of personal experience. It is , iso strong 
that the natural introduction of one idea tends to bring 
one or more of the others with it. 

Also interrelated on a larger scale, are 
Shakespeare’s moral, political and social beliefs. All 
are based on the fundamental principle of authority. In 
morals Shakespeare is a humanist, concerned chiefly with 
human character in action, rather than with absolute 
virtues and vices. He has no rigid system of moral 
values. Actions are good or evil in their effect on 
others. Hence his favorite virtues are sympathy, 
endurance, gentleness, loyalty; the greatest crimes, 
ingratitude and flattering love. He is chary of extreme^ 
both of austerity and of passion and emotion; and against

all over-emotional demonstration. Moderation and 
self-control are consistently praised and advocated. 
Shakespeare thinks of man* s mind as a state and believes 
him capable of ruling it with authority. 

Authority is the basic principle on which depend 
Shakespeare’s ideas on domestic life and on the state. 

In the family the wife must be subordinate to the 
husband, the child to the father. In the state order 
and unity are the sourcds of strength. Civil war is the 
greatest evil. The mob must be firmly controlled and 
not allowed any power. The laws must be inviolable and 
administered impartially* Everything depends on the 
ruler’s ability to wield authority and keep all forces 
in the kingdom in their proper subordination. Abuse of 
authority is as bad as the lack of it. Sympathy always 
goes to the child when the father is unreasonable or 
cruel, as it does to the rebel against a tyrant, or the 
offender when the law is corrupt. Mercy is desirable, 
but the failure of authority means the end of all order 
domestic or civil. This philosophy is summed up in 
Ulysses’ speech in TC. . Just as in the universe the 
planets are ranged in proper order round the sun, so all 
elements in the state are dependent on and held in their 
proper places by the monarch. If he is strong and 
possesses the gift of ’authority’, the power to control, 
the state is strong, but if he is waak, unfitted for-his

task, the state-planets wander from their proper spheres, 
and confusion reigns. Take the central authority away, 
and the state dissolves in anarchy. Justice becomes 
corrupt, and right and wrong no longer exist. The 
domestic order also is overturned, political anarchy 
produces corresponding moral anarchy, and the appetites 
of men, no longer held in check, will run riot till men 
destroy themselves. This dissolution of order in the 
state is associated with, or conceived in terms of, 
chaos and upheaval in nature, a tempest in which 

the bounded waters 

Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores 

And make a sop of all this solid globe. 

(^., 1 . 3 . 111 ) 

We suggested that this vision of anarchy in domestic 
life, in the state and in nature, is Shakespeare’s 
interpretation of his own times in the light of what 
was after all not an original conception with him but 
a widely held political theory of Tudor times. He is an 
orthodox islizabethan in his political and ethical thinking 
In fact, it is rather in dramatic genius than in 
originality of ideas that he stands above his contemp¬ 
oraries* 

In Chapter I it was pointed out that KL . 
sums up Siiakespeare’s philosophy of family and state, 
domestic relations. Justice and morals, symbolized 
by upheaval in nature and disorder in the mind of 
man. It becomes increasingly clear as

we summarize Shakesueare*s ideas, that this play is the 

key work in Shakespeare, a sort of summation or epitome 

of the high points of his philosophy. It has as major 

themes besides the ideas about state and domestic life, 

his hatred of *iiionstrous» ingratitude and, associated 

with this, the ideas that nature is kinder than mankind, 

that suffering brings regeneration, true sympathy and 

self-knowledge, and thst the fool may have wisdom denied 

to the wise man. Lear, driven out by the ingratitude of 

his daughters, finds the elements less cruel than they, 

comes to know himself in the storm and attaina to 

sympathy with ’houseless poverty* through his own 

suffering. The Fool is Shakespeare’s supreme expression 

of the idea that , 

The wise man’s folly is anatomized 

Sven by the squandering glances of the fool. 

(ASiI.,2.7.55) 

We have Shakespeare’s interest in madness reaching its 
peak in his portrayal of the mental collapse of Lear, 
the conventional and feigned madness of Poor Tom and the 
eccentricity of the Fool. As we have seen (Chapter III 
almost all the important ideas on madness are 
present in Lear, particularly the notion that sleep and 
music can cure it and that the madman may utter great 
truths in his ravings. There is less in this play about 
melancholy but we have the discussion of suicide in the 




297 


subplot. The main ideas on morals also are strong in 
Lear , The relation of mental and physical suffering is 
brought out by Lear in the.storm, Goneril, Regan and 
jSdmund all illustrate the favorite thought that ’there’s 
no art to find the mind’s construction in the face’, 

Lear illustrates the evil of lack of self-control and 
moderation, flying into uncontrolled and disproportioned 
rages over trivial matters, and learns temperance only 
after the ordeal in the storm, Kent too by his fit of 
rage at Oswald, precipitates the quarrel in 2,4, 

Cordelia is commended for her command,-"She was a queen 
o’er her passion (KL* ,4,3,14), The beauty of loyalty 
is illustrated in Kent, as is also the cheerful 
acceptance of misfortune* Almost all the ideas we can 
attribute to Shakespeare appear somewhere in Lear , but 
we have pointed out sufficient to show that all the main 
lines of his thought converge in this play. Add to this 
the fact that there are more dramatic parallels with 
Lear than with any other single play, evidence which 
suggests that the conception of the play developed 
gradually in his mind, and that when writing it he either 
utilized effective ideas that had long lain in an actual 
or mental notebook, or let his mind go back over all his 
previous works gathering suggestions. Thus KL, is a 
double summation of Shakespeare’s dramatic activity and 
of his philosophy,-the play into which he put most of

Having established with at least strong probability 
that the foregoing are Shakespeare’s permanent ideas, we 
may consider what sort of man he was who held them and 
how they affect the various theories about Shakespeare’s 
personality. Most interpretations of his personality 
centre in attempts to explain the supposed gloom and 
bitterness of the tragic period and the realistic comedies 
either as the result of the fall of Essex or of the sordid 
love affair with the ’dark lady’ of the sonnets. J.D. 
Wilson presents an attractive case for the idea that 
Shakespeare, through his connection with Southampton, 
was intensely interest in the career of Essex and 
portrays him in Ham .. Obviously Shakespeare could not 
hold the views he does and have been sympathetic to 
Essex’ rebellion. Wilson admits as much. #, and thinks 

^ > P • ^^2. 

Shakespeare would advocate that Essex should make terms 
with the queen and achieve a peaceful settlement of the 
crown after her death. But there is another difficulty. 

If Essex is Hamlet, he is definitely not the man 
Shakespeare would want to see on the throne. We have 
seen that everything depended in Shakespeare’s political 
philosophy not so much on the lege-l and peaceful 
transmission of the crown, as on the fitness of the ruler

to fill his position, and Hamlet lacks all the qualities 
Shakespeare’s ideal monarch recuired, kiss ^instanley 
who thinks Hamlet is drawn from both Essex and James I, 
leaves us in an even greater quandry since Shakespeare 
could hardly have favored both. 

\s lor the tneory of personal disillusionment 
involving the sonnet fctiory and the dark lady, in the 
first place it is doubtful whether the sonnets are 
autobiographical^ since the incident treated therein 
is a common Elizabethan variant of the friendship theme; 
and if they are» it is difficult to connect the sonnets 
with a disillusiozuiient which does not begin to show 
itself until l6oo. There is certainly little corrobor¬ 
ation of the theory in any of the ideas we have attributed 
to Shakespeare# We” have seen that the main spring of 
Shakespeare’s thinking on moral questions is moderation, 
self-control. He admires the man who is not ’passion’s 
slave’• He approves of restraint in the expression of 
emotion and admires the cheerful acceptance of misfortune. 
Suffering produces deeper and wider sympathy, a turning 
away from self-absorption, a redeeming self-knowlege. 

It seems unlikely that a man of so much breadth and 
balance holding these views^ believing that the will 
should govern the mind, would be so embittered by such 
an experience, or if he were, would parade it Byronesque 
fashion in his plays and poems. On the other hand we 








300. 

may admire qualities and princip).e8 we do not possess 
simply because we do not possess them, and we may 
sincerely believe in principles which we have not the 
strength to apply. Shakespeare may be admiring in others 
what he knew to be lacking lin himself. But at least if 
his ideas on morals do not count heavily against the 
sonnet theory they do not support it. 

There is not much evidence in Shakespeare’s moral 
thought of this supposed disillusionment. It is true 
we find much reiteration of the idea that beauty of face 
is a snare and a’ delusion and may hide the foulest of 
sins, but this thought is present from the earliest plajis 
with no startling Increase in frequency in the so-called 
bitter period.. So is the idea of the fickleness of 
youths, which might tie in with the sonnet story. Bor 
does this reflection of the deceptiveness of appearance 
seem to be associated with his bitter hatred of 
ingratitude except in two passages,^neither concerned 
with sexual passion. In TH., in the scene where Antonio 
denounces Viola, or as he thinks, Sebastian, accusing 
her of ingratitude and railing about the falsity of 
outward appearance, we have the friendship of the older 
man for the younger, and his supposed betrayal by the 
youth, but nothing about a dark lady. The same conjunction 
of ingratitude and deceptive-appearance occurs in Hen.V. 
2.2. with tegard to the traitors. The ingratitude theme

is much giore strongly bound up, though inexplicably, 
with ideas about the discipline of suffering and the 

wisdom of fools. We have a stronger suggestion of a 
background of personal experience in the association of 
this group of ideas, especially since it begins to 
become prominent in AYLI . which is the first play to 
betray signs of a more sombre mood. Ingratitude however 
is strong in only two plays, ]gi.and T»Ath . and does not 
appear at all in TG., AWW .. or Ham .. on which the 

the disillusionment theory very largely restsj nor does 
the ingratitude thex« either in Timon or in Lear seem to 
be connected with sexual passion. True, the railing of 
Lear and Timon contain many references to sexual 
immorality, but this is a natural sign of mental collapse 
in Lear and of something close to it in Timon. The 
ingratitude of Lear’s inhuman daughters and Timon’s 
sycophantic friends bears no relation to the dark lady 
or the friend of the sonnets* It seems difficult to 
connect whatever personal experience there may or may 
not have been behind Shakespeare’s hatred of ingratitude 
with the sonnet theories and the supposed sex-nauaea of 
the tragic period. 

An attempt wan made in Chapter I to present an 
alternative view of the ideas and mood of the later 
Shakespeare. We atwributed the deeper awareness of the 
evil and sordid side of life partly to the natural

development of maturity and very largely to the general 
temper of the age and the effect upon any farseeing man 
holding Shakespeare’s political and social views of the 
events of the time, We saw in the ravings of Lear and 
Timon and the moral and judicial corruption in Jgjl, for 
instance, expressions of Shakespeare’s vision of a state 
without an effective central authority, where moral 
anarchy follows upon political anarchy, and we tried to 
show that to a great extent he was painting his own times 
The man Shakespeare who emerges from a study of 
his repetition of ideas is for the most part an 
orthodox SUzahethan, a man of breadth, sanity, and 
tolerance# He is not, like Marlowe, a naturalist 
glorying in freedom and rebellion; nor like Jonson, a 
reactionary, repudiating his own age and without any 
positive values to set over against the evils he 
satirizes; nor like Webster, believing in nothing and 
reduced to please by mere sensationalism, Shakespeare 
has a positive philosophy. Vihere others are lost in 
pessimism^obsessed with the sense of death and decay, 
Shakespeare sums up his age and realizes its direction. 

He does not flinch from the implications of his 
interpretation, his picture is not less pessimistic than 
the others, but he does see a meaning in his times and 
he does keep his sense of tfalues and his balanced 
viewpoint.

APPENDIX IV 

Disputed Plays , 

Some of the disputed plays contain repetitioiE of 
the ideas in plays definitely Shakespaare's', a fact 
which would indicate that they were written by 
Shakespeare, or*that he had at least a hand in them, 

T*And ; the ideas on music are the same as those 
in the other plays* The connection of music and sleep 
and the power of music over human action, with a 
reference to Orpheus, appears in 2*4*48* Music and 
sleep are associated in 2*3«26* The idea that the 
baying of hounds is lousic and produces sleep, which 
appears also in MNP , occurs in 2,2*20, 2*3«l6, 

The Hen,VI * playB contain the same basic ideas on 
state which we find in the other plays, 

T,Ath , contains strong assertions of many of 
Shakespeare’s most individual ideas. Note the passage 
in 4,1.1 compared with the speech of Ulysses* on 
degree. The ingratitude theme is strong in Timon ;' 

3.2.78, 4.2.45, 5.1.67, 3.4^.26, 3.6.73. 3.5.94,

the wisdom of fools occurs in 2•2,117* 1^6 curses of 

Timon and Apemantus are in the same terms of fogs and 
diseases of the rainy south as the other curses in 
Shakespeare: 1,1,249, 4,1.21, The idea that gold is 
corrupting is strong in Timon (4,2,31, 4,3,28, 290,383) 
as nowhhre else in Shakespeare, a fact which might suggest 
collaboration, but not necessarily^for the idea does 
appear elsewhere in Shakespeare though not so strongly 
as in Timon . 

Hen.VIII , also echoes ideas definitely Shakespearian. 
The song “Orpheus with his lute {3*1*12)** contains the 
reference to Orpheus the power of music, the association 
with sleep, and the idea that music soothes sorrow, 
Moreover, since the song is dramatically integrated in 
the scene, it is not likely to have been written 
separately. ^The idea that a man*s evil deeds live after 
him, which was introduced in JC. is found twice in 

Hen.VlII .;^1.2,8l. 4.2.45* The notion of the uncertainty

of the favor of the great (3,2.441), the condemnation 
of ambition (3,2,441) and the thought that extremity 
is the trier of spirits (3*2*378, 4.2.65) are all ideas 
which may be found elsewhere in Shakespeare, thoig h none

of them is of persistent recurrence* As all these 
passages in HjBM*VII 1 * which express them are generally 
thought to be Fletcher’s, the evidence would seem to 
suggest that Fletcher was influenced. Probably 
Shakespeare sketched the drama and gave Fletcher certain 
scenes to write. Shakespeare’s hatred of false friends 
is present also in Hen.VIII ..2.1.126. 

With regard to all these disputed plays, the 
evidence seems to indicate that Shakespeare had a hand 
in all of them. His ideas are most clearly seen in T.Ath .
