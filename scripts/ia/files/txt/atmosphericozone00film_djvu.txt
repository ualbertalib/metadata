Introduction 


Before 1920 only chemical means had been used to determine the 
amount of ozone in the atmosphere and this only in the lower 
layers. Fabry and Buis son (l) were the first to examine the 
ultra-violet end of the solar spectrum and from their measurements 


determine the amount of ozone in the atmosphere. The method of 
determination depended on the strong absorption band of ozone which 
extends from about 3300 A to 2000 A. This band is responsible for 
the ultra-violet limit of solar and stellar spectra. 

One of the methods of calculation gives rise to the formula (2,3)

where x = amount of ozone in cm.

z = zenith distance of the sun at the place of observation 
*5 = zenith distance of the sun at the place where the sun®s 
rays which reach the observer cut the ozone layer* 

This formula assumed, that the rati© of the intensities of two 
wavelengths emitted by the sun is a known constant (2,4,5,)• The 
values used were those given by Stair (6). It also assumes that the 
ozone is in a layer* This is a fair approximation (?)* 

The amount of ozone is given in cm* as is the custom* It means 
the thickness of the layer the ozone would occupy if it were at 
N. T* P. 

The effect of scattering by small particles is allowed for by the 
coefficient ^ • These were calculated from Lord Rayleigh*s formula 
(8) for different wavelengths and different pressures on the 
assumption that the air was at 0°0. The effect of scattering by 
large particles is independent of wavelength (2) and cancels out 
in this method* 

Ozone absorption coefficients were originally obtained by Fabry 
and Ruisson and are listed by Dobson (2)* More recently Hy and 
Choong (29) have published more accurate values, which are generally 
used, and have been adopted for the calculations in this thesis* 

The zenith distance z was computed from the time of observation 
by means of tables* The zenith distance ^ was computed from z 
by the formula (7) _ sin z 

ln 5 ~ . h 


where h is the height of ozone layer which was taken as 25 to. (9)

and R is the radius of the earth. 

Following the work of Fabry and Buisson, Dobson (2) devised a 
spectrograph by means of which suitable photographic plates could 
be taken for the measurement of ozone in the atmosphere. (This 
instrument was modified and used in this work). Dobson followed 
up his preliminary measurements by setting up a network of stations 
for ozone measurements. 

This network yielded a number of interesting results (4,5,10,11,12). 
It was found that there was an increase in the amount of ozone with 
an increase of latitude and in addition, a seasonal variation, 
taking the form of a maximum in spring and a minimum in autumn. 

This seasonal variation is more marked the greater the distance 
from the equator, where the seasonal variation is not appreciable. 
Changes in ozone amount were also found to be associated with 
weather changes; high values being associated with polar air, and 
low values with tropical air* This is especially interesting as the 
ozone is mainly in the stratosphere at about 25 km. (7,9). 

The work, however, was hindered by the fact that measurements 
could not be taken if the sun was covered by any clouds other than 
Cirrus or Cirro-stratus. Dobson (3) devised another instrument 
which largely overcame this defect. This instrument is a good one 
but costs approximately Despite the price, about 1G have 

been constructed. Most of them were used in England during the war, 
awaiting their intended distribution. 

Aside from Dobson and his collaborators there have been others

(13*14,15,16) measuring the amount and vertical distribution of 
ozone, hut these observations tend to be of a sporadic nature. 

The only network which has been set up to study the horizontal 
distribution has been the European one of Dobson. Since other 
parts of the world are subject to different weather conditions, it 
is desirable to set up other networks. Unfortunately, this has been 
prevented by the cost of the necessary instruments. 

In view of these circumstances Dr. B. H. Gowan suggested that an 
attempt be made to produce a cheaper instrument. Since one of the 
first type of Dobson®s instruments was available, it was thought 
that the attempt should take the fora of a modification of the 
instrument. This instrument would contain approximately one half 
of the quartz optical parts of the second Dobson instrument. It 
would, therefore, be a cheaper instrument, ©nd eight of them are 
now available for re-building. 

In making any modification of Dobson®s first instrument the 
disadvantages of the instrument need to be considered. One of 
these was the amount of work involved in obtaining results. The 
computation, was a heavy burden. Several thousand plates were 
handled by Dobson. Also the sensitivity was too low, and measurements 
could not be made except with a clear sky or very thin clouds such 
as Cirro-stratus. 

For these reasons it was desirable to avoid the use of photo¬ 
graphic plates. This suggests the use of a photomultiplier tube which

can provide high sensitivity over a small spectral range near 
3000 Angstrom units* The RCA 1P28 photomultiplier tube satisfies 
these conditions* 

In order to evaluate the amount of ozone it is necessary to 
measure the intensity at two wavelengths* The output of the 
photomultiplier tube will give a measure of the intensity. It is 
necessary, in addition, to select a narrow hand of wavelengths. 

To achieve this a slit was placed in the focal plane of the 
spectroscope, at right angles to the dispersion* The photo¬ 
multiplier was mounted in a position to receive the radiation 
which may pass through the slit* The slit and phototube (rigidly 
fixed together) could he moved hack and forth hy means of a screw. 
This made possible the selection of part of the spectrum and 
caused that part to fall on the same area of the phototube* 

By this means the corrected output of the phototube gave a 
measurement of the intensity of the sun’s spectrum for wavelengths 
which depended on the position of the slit* 

Apparatus 

The spectrograph devised hy Dobson an* 3 - "used by us is represented 
by Fig. 1* The plate holder and wedge which were part of the 
original instrument were discarded and are not shown in the figure. 
The wavelengths allowed to fall on the plate were between 3350 and 
2900A. The bromine and chlorine filter was included to minimize 
fogging of the plates hy scattered light of the longer ultraviolet 


and the visible wavelengths

Figure 1 


The path of the light in the instrument is indicated by means 
of two rays. The parallel rays from the sun are focused on the 
slit by the quartz lens. From there they go to the quartz Fery (l?) 
prism and are reflected at the hack surface. The light rays then 
travel hack along the instrument as shown and come to a focus in the 
plane formerly occupied by the photographic plate. It was necessary 
to place the movable slit in this plane. 

In order to achieve this a brass plate was cut as shown in 
fig. 2. The square hole was to allow the light passage to the slit. 
The two brass strips were used in order that the slit would b© in 
the proper plane. The felt was to prevent light leaking into the 
apparatus. The two coaxial connections fora part of the electrical

circuit. The cavity shown in the brass strip is merely to provide 
room for a nut on one of the holts which hold a second plate. The 
assembled parts shown in Fig. 2 were bolted on to the spectroscope 
by means of the five bolts. 

To the first plate was bolted a second plate as shown in Fig. 3* 
Sweated onto the second plate were two brass bars. They form the 
tracks for the sliding plate (part 4 of Fig. 4). The felt glued to 
the plate holding the tracks was to prevent light leaking between 
this plate and the sliding plate. The bolts at the lower end have 
been left off in order not to obscure the diagram. 

The parts of the moving section are shown in Fig. 4. These 
parts are shown assembled together with the parts of Fig. 3 in 
Fig. 5. 

The slit blades (part l) were bolted to the brass plate (part 2). 
This in turn was bolted to the sliding plate (part 4). The bracket 
for mounting the photocell (part 5) was also bolted to the sliding 
plate. 

The mount for the resistors (part 6) was made of l/8 inch 
bakelite. The large hole gave space for the tube socket. The two 
small holes adjoining were for the bolts which fasten this mount and 
the tube socket to the right hand side of part 5 * The other holes 
were threaded and the resistors bolted onto the mount. 

The bracket (part 3) was bolted onto the sliding plate. This 
was for the purpose of attaching the screw which drives the moving 


section back and forth#

The spring (part 7) was “bolted to the left hand side of part 5» 
Its purpose was to hold the moving section firmly against the right 
hand track, This ensured parallel motion. 

This assembly (Fig, 5) together with the photomultiplier tube, 
resistors, etc, are shown in Plate 1, The felt strips appearing 
in this photograph served as light traps. 

This section of the apparatus was enclosed “by a light tight “box 
made from galvanized iron. This is shown in place in Plate 2, In 
order to attach the driving screw it was necessary to have ready 
access to the interior. This is achieved “by means of a removable 
cover which is shown in place in Plate 2 and removed in Plate 
Through this “box passes the “brass screw which drives the

moving section. This screw has 32 threads to the inch. An aluminum 
disk 4.5 inches in diameter is mounted on the end of the screw 
together with a crank. The circumference of the aluminum disk was 
divided into 100 parts. A strip of aluminum sheet placed parallel 
to the screw, close to the edge of the disk, served as a zero 
indicator. By this device the position of the slit was determined. 

The electrical circuit involved is shorn in Big. 6. This shows 
the power supply on the left. From here a shielded cable leads to 
the section containing the photomultiplier tube and a potential 
divider. From this a shielded cable goes to the micro-ammeter. 

The power supply consists of a half-wave rectifier, a filter 
and a voltage regulator section. The voltage regulator is of the 
degenerative type. T6 follow through the action of this section 
consider that for some reason there was an increase in voltage across 
the output terminals. This would result in the following sequences 
the grid connected to R^ would become more negative, the plate 
current would be reduced, the grid connected to R^ would become 
more positive, the current through RgQ increase, the grid of 

would become more negative, the current through R-q, 
would decrease. Thus the output voltage would be decreased. In 
this fashion the ripple is reduced, and variation in line voltage 
is prevented from changing the output voltage. The output voltage 
may be altered from 800 to 1200 volts by varying %2*( §ee ?)• 

The effect on the output voltage caused by changing the input 
voltage was determined for various settings of R^g. The results

are shown in Fig, 7. The $ ripple was determined, by applying the 
output voltage to the vertical plates of a calibrated cathode ray 
oscilloscope. The ripple of the regulated voltage was found to 
he less than 0.01 percent. 

The output of the power supply is connected across a number of 
equal resistances in series. These resistances serve as a potential 
divider which supplies the voltage to the dynodes of the 1P28 
tube. The resistance was made about l/2 the size of the others 
since all that was required here was enough voltage to collect 
the electron©. This enabled the voltage to be increased over the 
other stages where amplification took place. 

The current from the anode of the photomultiplier tube was fed 
to the R,G.4. Ultra-sensitive micro-ammeter. Inthis instrument 
the current passed through a resistance which biases the grid of a 
vacuum tube. The resulting plate current passes through a moving 
coil meter with a range of 1 milliampere. Through this same meter 
the plate current of another tube of fixed bias passes in the 
opposite direction. The meter is provided with a zero adjustment 
and a range switch. 

The apparatus so far described is shown ready for use in 
Plate 4; the spectroscope in the rear, the power supply on the 
right and the micro-amraeter on the left. 

For convenience in operation at all times of the year, and to 
prevent condensation of the bromine-chlorine filter gas during the 
winter it was necessary to keep the instrument indoors. Thus

it was necessary to use a heliostat and a fixed mirror. These are 
shown in position on the shelf outside the laboratory window in 
Plate 5* The lower mirror is moved by the attached clock. The 
light reflected from this mirror forms a beam parallel to the 
earth's axis. The upper fixed mirror intercepts the beam and directs 
it into the instrument. Both mirrors were front surfaced with 
evaporated aluminum and this fact had to be taken into account in 
the calculations. 

Adjustment 

The position of slit was adjusted first. In this adjustment 
one blade of the slit was removed. A strip of photographic film 
was taped across the opening. The light from a sunlamp was directed 
into the instrument for one minute. Then the light from a carbon 
arc was directed into the instrument for 4 minutes. The carbon are 
provided a continuous background of ultra-violet which revealed 
the position of the slit blade. The mercury lines provided by the 
sunlamp gave the position taken up by the spectral lines. 

Examination of the developed film by travelling microscope showed 
that the spectral line and the slit blade were not parallel. The 
slit mount was moved accordingly and the process repeated until 
the spectral line and slit blade were accurately parallel. The 
other blade of the slit was then bolted on so that its edge was 
parallel to the first and at a distamce of 0*20 mm. This was done 
with the aid of a travelling microscope. This arrangement allowed 
light to reach the photocell which varied in wavelength by about

5*5 Angstrom units. 

In the adjustment of the photomultiplier position the holts 
holding the mount to the sliding plate were loosened. The light 
from the sunlamp was directed into the instrument. The photomultiplier 
was then moved until the photocurrent was at a maximum, Thus the 
maximum light was being intercepted by the cathode end was falling on 
the most sensitive area,. The bolts were then tightened. 

Calibration 

Before the plate holder had. been removed from the instrument 
but after the wedge had been removed, plates were taken of the solar 
spectrum with the iron arc on each side for comparison. One of these 
had suitable exposure and was examined with the microphotometer* 

By this means profiles of the sun*s spectrum and the iron spectrum 
were obtained. These are shown in figure 8, The wavelengths were 
then identified (l). The profile of the solar spectrum as given by 
the plate was quite similar to that obtained by the final instrument. 
The latter profile is shown in figure 9- Thus a calibration of th® 
driving screw was made in t erms of wavelength over the range useful 
for ozone measurements. 

It was necessary to obtain factors which would convert the current 
readings into light intensities. This was done experimentally, Th© 
features which made this necessary were the absorption by the filter, 
the reflection by the aluminum surfaces, and the variation in sensitiv¬ 
ity of the photocell with wavelength. It is the chlorine in the

filter which absorbs in the pertinent region* The amount of 
chlorine in the filter is not known. For the type of photocell 
used the average spectral characteristics are known, but it is also 
known that there are variations from tube to tube* 

To perform the calibration use was made of a standard source of 
ultra violet light (18). (The calibration of this lamp is given in 
the appendix). The relative intensities of the various wavelengths 
are known for this lamp* The light from this lamp was directed into 
the instrument. Measurements were made of the photocurrent for 
different screw settings. Since the screw was calibrated in terms of 
wavelength the response caused by the lamp was found for the differ¬ 
ent wavelengths. The incident relative intensities was then divided 
by the resulting current. This gave a correction factor to be 
applied to all readings taken at that wavelength. The reflectivity 
of aluminum was obtained from a paper by Matthew, Luckiesh aid Taylor 
(19)* The values for the necessary wavelengths were squared and 
divided into the factors obtained above. The resulting correction 
factors were used in all subsequent ealciilations. 

The micro-amine ter was used on only one range. This range was 
calibrated with the aid of a potentiometer and standard resistance. 

The resulting curve was accurately straight. Since only relative 
intensities were required it was not necessary to alter the conversion 
factors.

Observations and. Results 

In the taking of observations the slit was moved from the long 
to the shorter wavelengths by means of the screw. As there were 
some signs of wear it was not thought advisable to trust the 
calibration of the screw. The screw reading was used to find the 
wavelength wanted. Then the Fraunhofer transmission spaces were 
accurately located by noting when the photocurrent reached a maximum. 
This maximum current was used in the calcinations for the wavelength 
concerned. To ensure that the correct peaks were being taken, 
partial profiles of the solar spectrum were taken whenever doubt 
arose. 

Wavelengths 3264 and 3232 Angstroms were used as the ones 
which are only slightly absorbed by ozone. Wavelengths 3095* 

3086, 3062, 3052 were used as the ones which are greatly absorbed by 
ozone. One of the first two, and any one of the last four can be 
used to calculate an ozone value. 

The time was noted at the beginning aid at the end of each 
run, in order that the value of sec z might be computed. It 
was found that, with practise the time required for a run could 
be reduced to two minutes.

Discussion 

As is evident from Table 1, it was not possible to take 
observations at any desired time. There were two causes for this. 

The first is the nature and sensitivity of the instrument. Observations 
could not be taken when the sun was obscured by clouds. With clouds 
other than cirrus the intensity was reduced below workable values. 

With thin cirrus cloud the reflection and scattering of light during 
the motion of the cloud structure past the sun causes fluctuations 
of intensity. (On the other hand if a thin cirrostratus layer is 
sufficiently uniform, observations are possible. See the values in 
Table I for March 5)» The second cause of missing observations was 
the location of the instrument, ^he shadow of the Arts building 
prevented the taking of observations before local noon, firing 
the winter, the South Laboratory shadow prevented the taking of 
readings after about 3 o*clock With a west or northwest wind, 
smoke and steam from the power house prevented the taking of read- 
ings on what were, otherwise, clear days. 

Some of the figures in Table 1 are marked by an asterisk. These 
figures are those which were computed from data which contained at 
least one wavelength whose intensity might be questioned. This 
resulted from a lack of resolution. By this is meant that a maximum 
current was not obtained for the Fraunhofer transmission space but 
rather a levelling off, giving a point of inflection of zero slope. 

In Table 2, two mean values have been computed for each day. One 

was obtained using all values and the other by omitting values 
computed from data of poor resolution. This results in the omission

of mean values for December where the poor resoltion resulted 
from low intensities. 

In Table 1 a peculiar feature is the apparent association of 
low ozone values with high values of sec. z. The values placed 
in the brackets for March 20 and 23 and for Nov. 28 show the occur¬ 
ence of this feature. Also, the values of ozone for the days of 
December and January 2 are lower than any yet reported. These 
values are, therefore, suspect. If the values placed in brackets 
in Table 1 were omitted from the computation of column 2, Table 2, 
the values for Nov. 28, March 20 and March 23 would be changed to 
1.3^, 2.22 and 2.27 mm. respectively. An explanation of this 
effect has not appeared up to the present. Observations during 
both morning and afternoon of many more clear days will be required 
to decide whether this effect is real. If the effect is judged 
not real, then these observations should help in identifying the 
instrumental error which is causing the trouble. 

There are several possible sources of error. One of these is 
due to the necessity to work quickly during a run in order to 
avoid appreciable changes in the value of sec, z. Thus the 
occasional value in Table 1 may be incorrect due to an error in 
reading of the meter. 

There is also the possibility that the assumed values of the 
incident intensity may be in error. This might well be of a 
temporary nature and due to solar flares. These flares may exceed 
one hundredth of the sun’s disc and they usually last an hour or

less but may last for more than 5 hours (25). They give bursts of 
ultra-violet radiation (26). A study of a long series of measurements 
taken at frequent intervals might well show this connection and the 
size of error resulting therefrom. 

There is some doubt as to the accuracy of the conversion 
factors obtained by use of the standard lamp. This arises from the 
apparent discrepancy in the values of the spectral emissivity of 
tungsten as given by various workers (20, 27, 28). This may quite 
possibly make necessary some change in the values of ozone given. 

An error in the assumed value of I_/i■ affects the ozone value 

0 o 

by an additive term A (log I 0 /l^ 

FTT^T) s@c# 

The effect of this term may be quite appreciable. On the basis 
of considering the sun as a black body at 6000°K with a possible change 
in temperatures of , Dobson (2) calculated a change of ozone of 

0.1 mm for see s ~ 2. Using Hulbert®s data as given by Stair (13) for 
wavelength of 3264 and 3°95 Angstroms, the amount of ozone would be 
increased by 0.49 mm. for sec. z - 2, These wavelengths were chosen 
as they looked as though they would give the greatest change. 

^rrors in the conversion factors used in obtaining I and I® 
affect the ozone value in the same way. 

Aside from instrumental or systematic errors the error in ozone 


values was estimated as not exceeding 3 sent

The expected change in ozone values with season was observed. 

The highest values occurred in March, the time of year that the 
maximum values are obtained in the northern hemisphere. The lowest 
reliable values occured in November, conforming to the usual 
minimum in the autumn. 

^he expected changes in ozone values with changes in weather 
were apparent in the March observations; low ozone values on Mar. 4 
and 5 being associated with mean temperatures of 35*7°^ and 27.3°^ 
respectively; the high values of March 9 and 10 being associated with 
polar air (temperatures -4.3 and 4.4°!’); the warm air returning 
about March 19 with a drop in ozone values. The low value of March 18 
seems out of place but then the weather for the period has not been 
studied in detail.

Appendix 

Calibration of Standard Lamp (18) 

The lamp is shown in Plate 6 together with its controls and 
protective cover. This lamp arrived in Dec, 1949 but without its 
essential calibration. 

It was, therefore, necessary to determine the temperature of the 
filament when carrying a given current. The originators of the 
lamp did this by obtaining color temperatures, but no equipment is 
available here for taking such measurements. An optical pyrometer 
of the disappearing filament type was used instead, and readings 
were taken by 15 different observers. This type of pyrometer requires 
an object whose image in the observing telescope is larger-than 
the pyrometer filament. These conditions were not fulfilled by the 
filament of the standard lamp. Thus a large personal error occurred 
and the method was abandoned. 

It was then decided to attack the problem with an infrared 
spectrometer. The spectral distribution of the energy of the lamp 
was found for currents of 4.00, 4.25, 4.50, 5*00, 5«50 and 6.00 amps. 
The wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity was noted in 
each case and could be determined within 0.025 micro ns * 

For comparison the positions of the peaks corresponding to 
several temperatures were calculated. The spectral distribution of 
the energy from a black body was calculated from Planck* s formula.

Values were computed for the range 0.9 - 1*9 microns for temperatures 
of 2300, 2400 and 2500°K. The resulting values were multiplied hy 
the appropriate emissivity of Tungsten (20). From the resulting 
curves the wavelength corresponding to the maximum intensity was 
noted for the various temperatures and plotted against the temperature 
as an auxiliary working curve. 

From this curve the temperature of the filament corresponding 
to a current of 6.0 amp# was found to be 2400°K. The error in 
temperature was estimated to be 50°K. This results in an error of 
69 $ in the absolute value of intensity at 3050 A but only in an 
error of 2.5$ in the relative values for wavelengths of 3250 and 
3050 A. 

On the basis of this filament temperature, values were computed 
for the intensities emitted by the lamp for the wavelengths required 
for use# (See pages 24 and 28). This was done as above by computing 
the black body curve and multiplying by the appropriate emissivity (18).
