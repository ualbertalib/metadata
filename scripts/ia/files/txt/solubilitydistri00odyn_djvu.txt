SOLUBILITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF PHOSPHORUS 


IN ALBERTA SOILS 


W. Qdynski 


INTRODUCTION 


This investigation was undertaken to obtain 
information regarding the nature and vertical distribu¬ 
tion of the phosphorus compounds in certain typical 
Alberta soils by studying their solubility in acid solutions 
of varying concentrations® 

Phosphorus occurs in soils in easily soluble and 
difficultly soluble forms, which are not due to the exis¬ 
tence of two distinct compounds but of a large number of 
compounds of varying solubility® The estimation of the 
amounts of easily soluble and difficultly soluble forms of 
phosphorus has resulted in the adoption of many chemical 
methods depending on the use of different solvents approx¬ 
imating theoretically the concentration of the solvents 
found in close proximity to the plant roots® It is due to 
this consideration of the ease with which the phosphorus 
compounds of the soil may enter into solution that they have 
been divided into easily and difficultly soluble groups*

There is considerable difference of opinion as 
to what phosphorus compounds belong to these groups# It 
is generally conceded, however, that the easily soluble 
group is composed of calcium phosphate chiefly, while the 
difficultly solub]e group contains mainly Iron phosphate, 
and in some cases organic phosphate* Considering the solu¬ 
bility of these compounds, it seems possible that by proper 
control of acidity a separation can be made of the easily 
and difficultly soluble forms on the basis of calcium and 
iron solubility# The forms in which these compounds are 
found may vary in different soils, and have a different 
solubility* Hence a determination of the rate of solubility 
seems of as great importance as the determination of ease of 
solubility* 

In consideration of the problem outlined above, 
an attempt was made to determine the relative amounts and 
rate of solubility of the easily soluble and difficultly 
soluble phosphates occurring in Alberta soils* This was don© 
by repeatedly extracting samples of all horizons at controlled 
pH values® An attempt was also made to determine the amount 
of phosphorus existing in organic combination in these soils* 
This investigation was conducted in the hope that the re¬ 
sults of such attempts might add to our knowledge of the 
nature and distribution of the phosphorus compounds in soils*

LITERATURE REVIEW 


Forms of Phosphorus Occurring In Soils # Phosphorus 
occurs in the liquid and solid phases of all soils. A very 
small amount is found in the liquid phase as compared to the 
much larger proportion existing in the solid phase* Both 
organic and inorganic forms of phosphorus are known to he 
present * 

In his comprehensive review of the literature 
Hibbard (16) points out that mineral phosphate possibly occurs 
in the soil as apatite, Gag(PO^JgCaFgl chlorapatite, OagfPG^Jg 
CaClgl hydroxyapatite, (Ca 3 (P0 4 ) g ) 3 Ca(OH ) g ; wagnerlte 9 
Mg 3 (P0 4 ) 2 ^gF 2 1 magnesium phosphate; wavellite, 4AlPQ4*2Al(.0H)g 
*9H g 0 and aluminum phosphate* According to Bassett (5) 
hydroxyapatite is probably the chief source of soil phosphate® 

Leahey (19) more recently found no evidence of 
the existence of crystalline iron phosphates in the soil and 
concluded that crystalline phosphates are not formed under 
normal soil conditions* Certain calcium phosphates may per*- 
sist in a soil to a considerable extent under leaching 
conditions® The iron phosphates are very basic and complex 
in nature, being more basic than any phosphorus minerals so 
far reported* He further states that apatite inclusions are 
so rare in some soils that they need not b© taken Into

consideration as a factor in studying the insoluble 
phosphates in such soils. 

Certain organic compounds containing phosphorus 
have been isolated from the soil# Page (24) and Teakle (35) 
mention the studies of some European workers who have des¬ 
cribed the isolation of nuclein and lecithin in small amounts, 
and others who have claimed the separation of organic forms 
of phosphorus from the ammonia extract of soils. Although 
the inaccuracies of the methods of separation are apparent, 
it cannot be overlooked that a large proportion of the 
phosphorus in the surface horizons is held in organic com¬ 
bination* 


Solubility of Soil Phosphorus . Numerous procedures 
have been developed for the estimation of easily soluble 
phosphorus in the soil. Hibbard (16) points out that prob¬ 
ably the most popular method is the weak acid extraction, 
with the sulfuric acid method of Truog (37) finding preference 
by many workers on this continent, whereas citric acid has 
found favor abroad. Any laboratory method that might be 
proposed for this purpose is more or less arbitrary, and 
considerable discussion has arisen as to what constitutes 
the easily soluble phosphorus* The problem is further com¬ 
plicated by the fact that these easily soluble and difficultly 
soluble phosphorus compounds are not sharply distinct* Hall

and Plymen (14) and Hall and Amos (13) long ago showed this 
to be true and brought forth the belief that there exist a 
large number of compounds of different degrees of solubility* 
When soils were repeatedly extracted with citric acid the 
solubility curves could not be fitted by any of the ordinary 
equations* In fact it can be taken as established that the 
reaction of acids on soils is not of the simple type pre¬ 
sented by the familiar mono, di, or tri molecular reactions* 

The investigations of von Wrangell and his co¬ 
workers, as reviewed by Hibbard (16) and Lohse and Ruhnke (21), 
show that the soil phosphates must be largely of a very 
complex nature and their solubility is far less than that of 
the synthetic tertiary calcium and magnesium phosphates and 
the synthetic phosphates of aluminum and iron* They point 
out that the laws of diffusion do not govern the dissolution 
rate of these phosphates, but that the dissolution rate is 
governed by the rate of decomposition of the surface of the 
particles which contain the phosphate. 

In the extraction of the easily soluble phosphorus 
of soils it would appear desirable to use a solvent which 
is approximately the same strength as the one operating In 
plant feeding* The evidence as pointed out by Truog (57) 
Indicates that the solvent operating at the points of contact 
between root hairs and soil particles is a saturated solution 
of carbonic acid* This solution has a pH of about 5*7 and 
in an attempt to approximate this solvent Truog uses a

0.002N sulfuric acid solution buffered with ammonium sulfate 
to a pH 3® 


The acidity of the solvent usually decreases some¬ 
what during the extraction process as it comes in contact 
with the soil, due to the solution of bases, while in th© 
case of plant feeding the solvent is continually being re* 
charged by the excretion of additional carbonic acid by the 
roots. Bearing this in mind it seems quite important that, 
to get a proper conception as to th© amount of phosphorus 
soluble at any pH, one must; as has recently been emphasized 
by Hibbard (16) and Lohse and Ruhnke (21) take great car© to 
have the pH of the extract so adjusted that it will be th© 
same for all soils® Lohse and Ruhnke (21) have recently 
suggested the use of KHSO4 as solvent, claiming that by s© 
doing, pH could be controlled much easier® . 

'The solubility of the phosphates commonly existing 
in soils is to a large extent dependent on the acidity of 
the extracting solution (3,4,7,15,35)® 

Lohse and Ruhnke (21) give the following summary 
of Gaarder’s investigations on the behavior of some of the 
most important phosphates found in soils:

In these pH ranges the phosphates are practically completely 
precipitated. However, since the ratios of each base to 
others and to phosphorus is different in different soils, 
each soil will act differently towards phosphorus solubility, 
even at the same pH value (30)* 

The behavior of phosphorus in soils is seen to be 
dependent to a large extent on the inherent differences of 
soils. In many cases complete solubility of soil phosphorus 
cannot be brought about by acid extractions* This insolu« 
bility of phosphorus in soils, Austin (4) points out, cannot 
be due solely to the soil reaction or the content of iron 
or aluminum, but must be due, at least in part, to yet 
unknown factors® 

The studies on the precipitation of phosphate® 
tend to show that reprecipitation of dissolved phosphate may 
take place during extraction of phosphate from soils if the 
soil remains in contact with the extract for a long time, 
and the pH of the solvent is above about a pH of 3# Such 
reprecipitation has been shown to take place by Russell and 
Prescott (28) in their studies on the action of dilute acids 
on phosphorus compounds in soils® Reprecipitation was most 
marked for dilute HHO3, less for HC1 and least for HgSC^* 

This variation as to the amount brought in by these various 
acids was attributed to be due to a physical adsorption^ 
However, Comber (6) disagrees with these workers and

attributes such reprecipitation as being of a strictly 
chemical nature, and that physical adsorption plays no part 
in the reaction# 

Vertical Dist r ibution of S o il Phosphorus * Pew in¬ 
vestigations reported in literature deal with the vertical 
distribution of soluble phosphorus. A largo number deal 
with the distribution of the total amount of phosphorus in 
different horizons of soils (2,18,26,41)® However, the total 
analysis gives very little information concerning the nature 
and movement of the soil phosphates in the horizons® 

In studying some of the loess soils of Nebraska, 
Alway and Isham (1) showed that the amount of soil phosphates 
dissolved in 1 per cent citric acid extracts in the humid 
zone increased markedly from the first to the sixth foot, 
whereas in the arid portion a marked decrease from the sur¬ 
face downward was found® However, it is important to note 
that the presence of carbonates in the subsoils of the arid 
area tended to reduce the effect of the acid, for where these 
were destroyed before extraction the sixth foot horizon con¬ 
tained as much soluble phosphate as did the first foot 
horizon® 

Dunnewald (9) using 0®Q0XN HgSO^ studied the dis¬ 
tribution of available phosphorus in Wyoming soils and 
concluded that available phosphorus decreases in the lower

soil zones of all the profiles studied, as compared with 
the surface zones having organic matter accumulation* H© 
further adds that the amount of lime increases in the lower 
zones to such an extent that the action of the acid is 
neutralized, with the result that very little phosphorus is 
brought into solution* In a more recent paper ( 10 ) h© 
concludes that available phosphorus is more rapidly lost 
from the surface from grass soils than from podsolized timber 
soils * 

Recent work by Stephenson and Chapman (55) and 
by Thor (56) shows that readily soluble phosphate added to 
the soil, can penetrate appreciably below the surface foot 
in light to medium textured soils, while little or no pen©** 
tration seems to take place in very heavy soils* The readily 
soluble phosphate of manure seems to move more readily through 
soil* 

Lohse and Ruhnke (22) in a very recent investiga¬ 
tion using KHSO 4 at pH 2 conclude that surface sampling 
alone is inadequate and point out the extreme desirability 
of controlling and adjusting pH so that extracts from all 
horizons are of the same pH* They shov/ that sandy podsols 
seem to be very low in readily soluble phosphate in all hor~ 
izons, that clayey podsols and brown forest soils contained 
large amounts of readily soluble phosphate in the B horizon.

of the brown forest group contained, in all cases, consider** 
able amounts of easily soluble phosphate in the lower horizons® 

Effects of Ignition on Solubility of Phosphorus ® 

As pointed out by Stewart (34) it has long been known that 
simple ignition increased the solubility of phosphorus in 
cold hydrochloric acid® The increased solubility was for a 
long time believed to be due to the destruction of the 
organic phosphorus compounds* Furthermore, the amount of 
organic phosphorus as determined by ignition differed consid¬ 
erably from the amount found by ammonia extraction or by- 
calculation from other analyses* Due to such differences 
he believed that ignition might have rendered some of the 
organic phosphorus insoluble in cold HG1 at any strength# 

Shortly after, Fraps (12) in investigating th© 
effects of simple ignition on various phosphate rocks con¬ 
cluded? 

(1) That ignition greatly increased the solubility 
of these rocks, such increases varying with the type of 
rock® 

(2) That Ignition of a soil would probably render 
inorganic phosphates soluble in acid, and was therefore not 
a method for estimating organic phosphorus.

(3) That evidence indicated that ignition of a 
soil rendered considerable quantities of iron and aluminum 
oxides soluble in acid* 

A little later Lipman ( 20 ) in investigating the 
effect of heating soils at a low red heat for twenty minutes 
and then digesting with HNO 5 , found that ignition of soil 
appeared to decrease appreciably and definitely the solubil¬ 
ity of its PO^ whether it be organic or inorganic* He 
believed this to be due to the fact that soil is a complex 
mass and that its particles would be protected from heat so 
long as water of hydration and organic matter still remained 
in soil, hence no additional surface was exposed* Such 
dehydration of organic matter as well as of inorganic phos¬ 
phates would seem to make them less soluble* 

Recently Marais (23) has put forth the belief that 
in igniting the minerals, dehydration of the bases and 
destruction of crystalline structure tends to render the 
PO^ more soluble or available to p3„ants* However, it is 
pointed out that this belief alone cannot explain the peculiar 
and varied behavior of some mineral phosphates in giving up 
their PO 4 after heating* The work of Quartaroli is cited 
in attempting to explain this behavior on the basis of an 
existence of isomeric structures for mineral phosphates# 
Ignition may or may not alter the existence of the various 
isomers and so exert its effect on the solubility of th©

various phosphates * 

Ford^s study (11) showed that ignition of soils 
destroyed their fixing power to varying degrees with the 
accompanying liberation of phosphorus* Such variations as 
might exist in this respect he attributed to the presence 
of the various different behaving minerals* On ignition the 
dehydration of Goethite (FegOg.IigO) produced hematite (F©2°3) 
and thereby destroyed its fixing power* Partial dehydration 
of bauxite (Alr>0 3 *XHg0) increased its fixing power and, 
further dehydration did not entirely destroy it* 

In recent investigations Doughty (8) found that 
the increase in soluble phosphorus was to a large extent 
dependent on the temperature at which the soils were ignited* 
Heating also tended to increase the pH value of the soils 
in all cases* 

EXPERIMENTAL 


The following experiments were designed to obtain 
evidence on the solubility of soil phosphorus throughout 
the different horizons of typical Alberta soils* The soil 
samples were repeatedly extracted with strong and weak 
acids until only traces of phosphorus were dissolved* On

the basis of the amounts of phosphorus thus extracted an 
attempt was made to determine the relative proportions of 
calcium, iron and organic phosphorus in these soils* 

Description of Soils 


The soils used in this Investigation are typical 
of the more mature soils of the gray wooded, the black and 
the brown soil belts of Alberta 0 These soils have been 
described in considerable detail (17,18,40,41) and only 
brief mention need be given of them here* 

In the south of the province are the brown soils 
occurring in an area of low precipitation and high evapora** 
tion, and as a result characterized by relatively thin A 
and B horizons with the lime accumulation zone close to the 
surface* The A^ and the B]_ horizons ar© not always easily 
distinguished from each other, and are often referred to as 
the horizon* The B«> or lime horizon often occurs at less 

than a foot from the surface* The horizons are neutral to 
slightly alkaline in reaction* Occurring as they do in 
regions of low precipitation and high evaporation, there is 
not an excessive growth and accumulation of organic matter# 
Such salts that may accumulate do so near the surface, for 
percolation is quite shallow#

In the moister regions of part of central Alberta 
are produced the black soils, characterized by a deep very 
dark colored surface layer» This layer, the A^, has an 
average depth of about 10 inches* The A 2 and horizons 
are generally well developed and easily distinguished, and 
the Bg horizon usually occurs at about three to four feet 
from the surface# The horizons exhibit a nearly neutral 
reaction# Due to a lower evaporation and a slightly greater 
downward movement of water, together with the active grass 
growth that is usually the main covering, there is a greater 
movement of the more soluble constituents, as is shown by 
the considerably lower carbonate horizon# 

The wooded soil belt lying to the west and north 
of the main black soil belt, is fairly heavily wooded for 
the most part# Hie soils of this belt compose about two~ 
thirds of the area of the province# They are the least fer¬ 
tile of the groups and are produced under more humid conditions 
than the other two® Characteristic of this group of soils 
Is their apparently badly leached zone near the surface# 

The upper Inch or two of these soils consists of leaf mould ~ 
the A 0 horizon# Immediately below this one finds a drab 
colored layer one or two inches thick - the A-^ horizon# The 
Ar> horizon is a light gray structureless soil having a 
characteristic ashy appearance, and shows signs of bad leaching*

This layer varies In thickness from 8 to 12 inches* The 
Bq horizon below this is very heavy in texture and in some 
cases constitutes a hardpan* It is often several feet 
thick* The horizon of lime accumulation is seldom 
found less than about four feet from the surface* The soils 
of this group, bush covered as they generally are, are main¬ 
tained in a humid condition, thus providing water for 
leaching purposes* The carbon dioxide produced from decay¬ 
ing organic matter renders this water slightly acidic, 
thereby increasing its leaching power and facilitating the 
downward movement of bases* There is a horizon in the upper 
part of the soil profile where a removal of bases and col¬ 
loids has occurred with subsequent precipitation farther 
down « 

For the present investigation two profiles were 
taken from the wooded area, two from the black and one from 
the brown* Those from the wooded area were taken at Breton 
and at Fallis, those from the black soil area were taken at 
Stony Plain and at Beaumont, and the brown profile was ob¬ 
tained at Provost. 

Methods of Analysis 


Samplings The samples were obtained from natural 


horizons wherever possible* Where this was found difficult.

the samples were taken at arbitrary depths corresponding 
to the changes in color and texture* They were air dried 
on arrival at the laboratory and when air dried, were ground 
to pass a 20-mesh sieve* 

React ion * The pH values of the soil samples were 
determined in Is4 extracts. The quinhydron© electrode was 
used in all cases. 

Total Phosphorus * The total phosphorus was deter¬ 
mined colorimetrically by first fusing the sample with 
sodium carbonate and then extracting with water according 
to the method developed by Truog and Rothermel^• 

Extraction # One gram samples were shaken on© 
hour with 200 cc. solvent and filtered through a Buchner 
funnel. Phosphorus-free filter paper was used. The soil 
was repeatedly extracted till only traces of phosphorus were 
dissolved. After each filtration the filter paper and soil 
were returned to the shaker bottle and fresh solvent added* 

Easily Soluble Phosphorus * The easily soluble 
phosphorus was extracted by the use of 0*002N HgSO^ buffered 
with (NH^gSO^. to pH 3 (37). The pH determinations in all 
extracts were made by means of the quinhydrone electrode 
and the phosphorus dissolved was determined by th© Deniges

method as modified by Truog and Meyer (38)* 

It is a matter of considerable controversy as to 
what may be termed easily soluble phosphorus* For the 
purposes of this investigation. It seemed most logical to 
separate the easily soluble from the difficultly soluble 
groups on the basis of iron solubility, since most investi¬ 
gators consider that iron phosphate is difficultly soluble 
(4,7,9,15,16,21,35,37)* In most soils the easily soluble 
phosphorus exists largely as calcium phosphate, while the 
difficultly soluble exists largely as basic ferric phosphate 
(37). With this in mind samples of limonite were treated 
with H 2 SO 4 solutions of different acidity to determine at 
what pH the iron was dissolved* The samples were shaken 
with extracting solution for one hour and then the solubil-* 
ity of th 6 iron was determined by testing the filtrate on a 
spot plate with KCNS*

The results of Table 1 show no Iron dissolved at 
pH 2.8 and pH 2.7, doubtful traces at pH 2.6 and pH 2.5 
and increasingly positive traces at the lower pH values* 

A similar study was made of a soil sample which 
had previously shown indications of high iron content* 

The sample selected was the Breton upper One gram sam¬ 

ples were extracted by solutions of different pH and the 
amounts of iron and phosphorus in the extracts were deter¬ 
mined# Repeated extractions were made in an attempt to 
determine at what rate the iron and phosphorus were being 
dissolved* The results, given in Table 2, show a much 
smaller amount of phosphorus and Iron soluble at pH 2 #9 than 
at pH 2# With increased acidity there is a distinct increase 
in their solubility* The amount of phosphorus dissolved at 
pH 2.9 is only 17 p.p.m* in the first extract with no decrease 
in the two subsequent extracts* The amount increases with 
increased acidity till at pH 2, 67 p.p.m* are found In the 
first extract and a more rapid decrease in the subsequent 
extracts. Thus the amount soluble and rate of solubility 
are definitely dependent on the acidity of the solvent* 

The amount of iron in solution in the first extract (Table 2) 
increases from a trace at pH 2.9 to 160 p*p.m# at pH 2* 

This amount decreases In the second and third extracts 9 
although the decrease is much slower than in the case of 
phosphorus #

Although HgSO^ at pH 2 dissolves the phosphorus 
more rapidly than do the less concentrated solutions it seems 
unsatisfactory for separating the easily soluble from the 
difficultly soluble soil phosphorus, since at this pH con^ 
siderable amounts of iron are dissolved* Furthermore, the 
preliminary work as shorn in Table 2 indicates definitely 
that regardless of what strength solvent is used, the first 
extraction alone is not sufficient to remove all of the 
easily soluble phosphorus, and the relative solubility or 
the phosphorus supplying power of a soil cannot be determine 
ed except by repeated extractions of the sample*

Other preliminary experiments on the Stony Plain, 
Provost and Breton profiles showed that pH 2 solvents removed 
the phosphorus in four extracts and the pH 3 in six extracts 
(on the average)# Although the total phosphorus removed in 
the Stony Plain and Provost horizons was practically the 
same for pH 2 as for pH 3 extraction, yet definite amounts 
of iron were found to he soluble at pH 2 in all horizons and 
notably in the subsurface ones# However, in the Breton pro¬ 
file there was a definite increase in the total phosphorus 
extracted at pH 2 as compared to that extracted at pH 3# 

This increase was accompanied by a pronounced increase in 
total iron dissolved. This profile was further investigated 
and extraction made of all horizons at pH 2.8# The total 
phosphorus extracted at pH 2.8 was virtually the same as at 
pH 3, yet at pH 2.8 definite traces of iron were dissolved 
in horizons below the A^ horizon® 

The length of time that the sample is shaken seems 
to have a considerable influence on the amount of phosphorus 
dissolved. Table 3 shows, in one case in particular, 
(Beaumont B-j_) that one hour shaking was more effective than 
half hour shaking as.recommended by Truog (37). Though 
minor differences occurred in the amount of phosphorus ex¬ 
tracted in the other samples, the data (Table 3) indicate 
that the number of extractions might be reduced by shaking 
for the longer period®

Care was taken, in controlling the acidity, to have 
the pH of all extracts virtually the same, that is pH 3 with¬ 
in limits of 0,2, To achieve this, it was necessary to 
determine, by preliminary trials, the additional amount of 
acid required to neutralize the excess bases or lime present 
in samples of certain horizons® The acid used for this pur¬ 
pose was IN HgSO^a Such additions of acid were required in 
only the first extracts of these samples® 

The extract from the surface horizons was slightly 
colored due to organic matter coming into solution® This

coloring was somewhat objectionable, in some cases, in the 
colorimetric determination of phosphorus* In attempting to 
overcome this objection, the samples were filtered through 
a layer of carbon black* 

The carbon black was previously purified by digest¬ 
ing with 2N HC1 on a steam bath overnight* It was then 
filtered by suction till free of chlorides, thereby getting 
rid of most of the inorganic phosphorus that might have been 
present* The mass was then washed several times with a 
normal solution of NH^OH to get rid of any adsorbed phosphorus 
that might be present, and to neutralize any remaining acid* 
When filtration had been completed the mass was transferred 
and dried at 100°C* for about two hours, and then heated in 
the muffle at 50Q°Go for five minutes to activate the carbon* 
This prepared carbon black was free of phosphorus and did 
not affect the pH of the extract* 

A study was made to determine the amount of organic 
phosphorus dissolved at pH 5* Aliquots of the extracts were 
treated with 1 cc* of 10 per cent evaporated and 

the organic matter destroyed by ignition (25)* 

The data in Table 4 show that very small to 
negligible amounts of phosphorus in organic combination are 
soluble at pH 3* Carbon black, in decolorizing the solutions, 
shows negligible adsorption of the phosphate ion under the 
conditions of this experiment* The carbon black may have a

The results of Table 4 further show that the removal of

great to interfere with the determination* 

Difficultly Soluble Phosphorus « The difficultly 
soluble phosphorus was extracted with 2N HgSO^* A suitable 
aliquot was taken, neutralized with 1-1 ammonium hydroxide, 
made slightly acid and then analyzed by the modified method 
of Truog and Meyer (38)* The increase in the total amount 
extracted by this solvent over that extracted at pH 3 
represented the amount of difficultly soluble phosphorus* 

Preliminary investigations showed that the solu- 
bility of the phosphorus compounds increased with increased 
strengths of acid* This increase was accompanied by a 
pronounced increase in the solubility of organic matter* 
Evidently the solvent for the difficultly soluble phosphorus 
should be of such concentration that a large amount of inor¬ 
ganic phosphorus and a small amount of organic phosphorus 
would be dissolved* Several concentrations of acid were 
tried and the amounts of organic and inorganic phosphorus 
dissolved were determined* The results of subsequent 
determinations are reported in Table 5* 

The data of Table 5 show that the 5 per cent HgSO^ 
dissolved much more of the inorganic phosphorus than did the 


1 per cent HgS0 4 


Increased concentrations of acid resulted in

smaller increases of soluble phosphorus in the surface horizons * 
The lime horizon, however, showed no increase in phosphorus 
dissolved by the more concentrated solvents# The amount of 
organic phosphorus dissolved, however, increased considerably# 
The increases in organic phosphorus dissolved in the Stony 
Plain profile seemed so much greater than the increases in 
inorganic phosphorus, dissolved that the use of a solvent of 
greater concentration than 5 per cent HgS0 4 was unwarranted* 
Further study, using .4N KMn0 4 to determine the amount of 
organic matter in solution, showed a narrower P:0*M. ratio 
in the 5 per cent extracts than in the others#

In view of these considerations a 2N solution of 
h 2 S0 4 (approximately 5 per cent) was used for the extraction 
of difficultly soluble phosphorus« 

The extracts obtained by using 2N H 2 SO 4 were too 
acid for a direct colorimetric determination of phosphorus 
(38). They were neutralized with X ~1 NH 4 OH using broxne 
phenol blue, since this indicator shows color change in the 
range of pH 3 to pH 3.9. Preliminary experiments showed 
that neutralized samples taken from the same extract gave 
quite variable phosphorus readings. The variations seemed 
most pronounced when more of the extract, and hence more 
NH^OH, was used* This variability on the part of neutralized 
samples was investigated by determining the effect of differ- 
ent amounts of NH 4 OH on prepared standards of known phosphorus 
content. 

pour different concentrations of HgSG^ were used. 

The samples for study were prepared by taking 10 cc. portions 
of acid, and adding 5 cc. of a standard phosphate solution 
to each. The mixture was neutralized by a predetermined 
amount of NH 4 OH, made slightly acid, and then diluted t® 

100 cc. Phosphorus determinations were made in the ordinary 
way (38) and also by comparison with standards that had been 
prepared in the same manner as the samples. 

The data of Table 6 show a decided variation in 


readings and a pronounced increase in such cases where more

NH 4 OH was used (first column)« The KH 4 OH was found to be free 
of phosphorus and it may be that the ammonia salts formed in 
the neutralizing process have some distinct effect on the 
blue color developed* The intensity of the blue color may be 
increased, or more probably the greenish tints developed due 
to these ammonia salts may serve to intensify the blue color* 
Such intensification became more pronounced with an increase 
in the amount of NH 4 OH used* Furthermore, the blue color in 
the neutralized samples showed a decided tendency to fade* 

In the method as developed by Truog there is very little 
fading of color in the first 10 minutes, whereas after treat** 
ment with NH 4 OH the samples faded rapidly after 5 minutes, 
especially where larger amounts of NH 4 GH were used* 

When the standards were treated in the same way as 
the samples much better agreement of results was obtained

(column 2, Table 5)« Thus by comparing only a few samples 
at a time with a standard containing about the same pro¬ 
portion of ammonia salts, it was possible to get much more 
consistent results* This method, of comparing with propor¬ 
tionally treated standards, was used to determine the 
phosphorus dissolved by 2 N H 2 SO 4 * 

Soluble Iron , The soluble iron was determined in 
50 cc. portions of the extracts by adding 5 cc« of 2 per cent 
KCNS and then comparing the color produced with prepared 
color standards (31)* 

Organic Phosphorus » The samples were ignited in 
an electric muffle furnace at 60Q°G*, for one hour, t© 
destroy the organic matter* After cooling, uhey were re~ 
peatedly extracted in the same manner and with the same 
solvents as the unignited samples* The average increase in 
the amount of phosphorus dissolved after ignition, indicated 
the relative amount of organic phosphorus* 


EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


The reported results are the average of several 
duplicate readings. Where such results have been expressed 
as percentages, they have been calculated to the nearest 


whole number

Easily Soluble Phosphoi^us 


One extraction alone was not sufficient to remove all 
of the easily soluble phosphorus of a soil nor did it give 
complete information as to the rate of solubility of that phos¬ 
phorus. The data of Table 7 show appreciable amounts of phos¬ 
phorus dissolved after the first extraction* In the A Q , &£* 
lower Bi and Bg of most profiles, over 50 per cent of the total 
extracted phosphorus was obtained in the first extraction, while 
in the upper B^ horizons of the Fallis and Breton profiles the 
amount dissolved remained fairly constant for the first two and. 
three extracts respectively* 

The data for some horizons of the Breton profile are 
presented in Pig* 1 as being fairly typical of the different 
rates of solubility shown in Table 7* The graphical represent¬ 
ation (Pig* 1) may perhaps serve better to show the variation 
in the amounts of phosphorus extracted from different horizons 
at different stages of the extraction* In all cases appreciable 
amounts were dissolved in the third and in sane cases even in 
the fifth extraction* A decided potential source of the easily 
soluble phosphorus is present over and above that found in the 
first extraction* Furthermore, investigat ions conducted to 
show amounts of easily soluble phosphorus in soils should never 
be confined to the surface horizons alone because, as seen from 
Table 7, the subsurface horizons often contain considerable 
amounts of easily soluble phosphorus which may be utilized by 
deep rooted plants (59).

Thus a high proportion of the total phosphorus 
in the lime horizons occurs as easily soluble phosphorus 
with the most alkaline horizons showing the greatest amounts. 
In the brown profile the amount of easily soluble phosphorus 
was quite large in all the horizons due possibly to the 
presence of considerable free lime* Lohse and Ruhnke ( 22 ) 
find a similar distribution in various Ontario soils* 

Dunnewald (9), working with Wyoming soils concluded 
"that the amount of available phosphorus decreases in the 
lower soil zones of all profiles as compared with th© surface 
zones having organic matter accumulation*” The results as 
shown in Table 7 are not in keeping with this statement, for 
when sufficient additional acid was used to neutralize th© 
CaCOg in the lime horizons the amount of easily soluble 
phosphorus was found to increase in these lower soil zones. 

Although the present paper is not primarily con* 
cerned with availability, it seems quite possible that the 
phosphorus found in these layers of OaOO^ accumulation is at 
least potentially available* The solvent about the plant 
roots, though it at first may be used up in neutralizing the 
carbonate, is continually being recharged by the excretion 
of additional carbonic acid by the root hairs (37), and will 
in time be able to dissolve this phosphorus quite readily* 

The Ag and upper horizons of the Breton and 
Fallis profiles have a very low and slowly soluble amount of 
phosphorus extracted (Table 7). The Ag horizon has been

severely leached, whereas the upper horizon has an accura^ 
ulat ion of aluminum and iron brought down in the course of 
leaching (18)* The greater part of the phosphorus present 
in these slightly acid horizons may be combined with aluminum 
and iron in difficultly soluble forms® 

These Ag and upper horizons of the Breton and 
Fallis profiles have likewise a low total phosphorus content® 
This low total may be due to an upward transference of phos* 
phorus by the plants, or to a downward movement due to 
leachingo If the phosphorus had been leached to the lower 
horizons these should have a much higher total phosphorus 
content than the parent material horizons® Such was not the 
case, for the fairly constant total in the parent material 
layers was not appreciably lower than the total phosphorus 
content of the horizons immediately above® Similarly in th© 
other profiles studied, except the Beaumont, there are no 
indications of any appreciable downward movement of native 
phosphorus, Leahey (18) also found very little evidence to 
indicate such downward movement® 

Tests for iron were made on the extracts of all 
horizons® The tests showed no traces of iron in solution

Effect of Ignition on the Amount of Phosphoru s 
and Iron Dissolved at pH 5 4 In an endeavor to determine 
how much of the soil phosphorus occurred in organic com-* 
bination, the samples were ignited and then repeatedly ex^ 
tracted at pH 3« The data In Table 8 show; 

(1) In the upper, organic matter, horizons a pro¬ 
nounced increase in easily soluble phosphorus is found 
after igniting the samples** The total easily soluble phos¬ 
phorus extracted after ignition is found to be at least 
twice as great as the total extracted from the unignited 
sample s . 

(2) In the Intermediate horizons there Is a small 
difference between the total extracted after ignition and 
the total extracted before ignition* 

(3) In the lime horizons, ignition often causes a 
slight decrease In the amount of easily soluble phosphorus 
extracted* 

In all cases (see Table 8) the differences in 
amount of easily soluble phosphorus are most pronounced In 
the first extracts. Further extractions show a marked 
decrease in the rate of solubility# More extractions ar© 
needed to reach the end point of phosphorus solubility after 
ignition than before, as shown by comparing the data of 
Tables 7 and 8*

increased amount of easily soluble phosphorus after ignition 
in the first extraction® The subsequent extracts show a 
rapid decrease in the amount extracted, but such amounts are 
in all cases higher than in the unignited sample» The curve 
shows a more uniform decrease in the amounts of easily 
soluble phosphorus in the different extracts, and an approx-* 
imate end point is reached after seven extractions whereas 
only six extractions were needed for the unignited sample# 

The upper horizon (as plotted by the green lines) 
shows an appreciable increase in the amount of easily soluble 
phosphorus in the first extract after ignition* The amount 
in the second extract is very much smaller and only slightly 
larger than the amount in the unignited sample at this stage# 
The decrease in the amount of phosphorus dissolved in the 
repeated extracts is much more gradual in the ignited sample 
and again the end point of phosphorus solubility is not 
reached as quickly as in the unignited sample* 

The lower Eg horizon (as indicated by the blue 
lines) shows a very marked decrease in the amount of easily 
soluble phosphorus in the first extract after ignition# In 
the subsequent extracts the amounts of phosphorus dissolved 
from the ignited samples are higher, but about parallel to 
the amounts dissolved from the unignited sample# Ignition 
also affects the rate of solubility for greater amounts of 
phosphorus are found in the seventh extract, than in the 
sixth of the unignited sample«

In the Provost B 2 and C, the Stony Plain lower 
and the Breton lower B^ (Table 8) the total amount of 
phosphorus extracted at pH 3 was lower after ignition than 
before (Table 7). The soil particles appeared more granular 
after ignition and it was believed that such granulation of 
the fine particles might account for the decrease In the 
amount of phosphorus dissolved® 

This effect was investigated by weighing out two 
gram samples of the Provost B 2 » Stony Plain lower and 
Breton lower B]_ and igniting as before. After ignition the 
loww in weight due to ignition was calculated. The sample 
was then ground in an agate mortar and a portion equivalent 
to one gram of unignited soil was weighed out. Repeated 
extractions were made as previously outlined® The results 
given in Table 9 show that granulation has some slight effect 
on the solubility® The extracts showed about the same total 
amounts of easily soluble phosphorus In the pulverized as in 
the unIgnited samples with a slight Increase noted in the 
Provost sample. The wide difference in the Initial extracts 
of this Provost sample, where in the one case the extract 
was at pH 3.6 and in.the other at pH 3.1, may be due to 
iron precipitating out the phosphorus, for even at pH 3*6 
the calcium phosphate should b© quite soluble (3,7,35). 

The low results obtained in the first extract may be due to 
the fact that at pH 3.6, with considerable excess of iron.

pulverizing might have rendered it more easily available to 
combine with the dissolved 1 phosphate and precipitate out aa 
ferric phosphate which was insoluble at pH 3*6® However, at 
pH 3*1 the liberated ferric oxides would not have such a tendency 
to precipitate out as ferric phosphates, due to this higher 
acidity inhibiting such a reaction or rendering some of the 
thus freshly precipitated phosphates soluble* 

Ignition seems also to have increased the alkalinity 
of the soil for twice as much of the IN HgSO^ was needed to 
adjust the pH value of the first extract in all cases® In 
the Brown B 2 a further excess of 0.4 co. over and above this 
amount was required to adjust the pH to 3*

An analysis of the extracts for iron showed dis¬ 
tinct differences in the ignited and unignited samples* The 
data in Table 10 show that whereas very little or no iron 
is found in the pH 3 extracts of unignited samples, yet 
after ignition there is a distinct amount dissolved in all 
cases* The quantities of iron vary considerably, but it is 
significant to note that the largest amounts found are in 
horizons having considerable free lime, as In the brown 
profile* This same relationship holds in the other profiles, 
for after ignition the amount of iron dissolved is greatest 
in the lime horizons* In the upper horizons, and to seme 
extent in the lower, this increase may be due to a liberation 
of iron tied up in the.organic matter* No explanation is 
offered for the great increase in the lime horizons* 

Upon pulverization more iron is dissolved* This 
is especially noticeable in the Brown horizon where at 
pH 3*6 very little iron is found in the first extract, but 
in subsequent extractions, where the pH is back to 3 again, 
greater amounts occurred* At pH 3*1 a very decided and 
significant increase in soluble iron is noted in the first 
extract* This fact may help to account for the peculiar 
difference in the solubility of the phosphorus in these two 
cases as shown in Table 9#

spite of its shortcomings, it is possibly indicative of 
the amount of organic phosphorus present in the various soil 
horizons, notably the surface horizons. With this in mind 
an estimate of the amount of organic phosphorus present may 
be obtained by subtracting the total phosphorus extracted 
after ignition from the total extracted without igniting. 

This has been done in the last column of Table 8* The A 0 
horizon of the Breton wooded soil, composed chiefly of 
vegetable detritus, has approximately 70 per cent of its 
phosphorus in organic form* The horizons of all three 
soils show a variable content of from 40 per cent to 50 
per cent of their phosphorus in organic combination* Below 
this horizon the decrease in organic phosphorus is rapid 
and characteristic of each soil* The brown profile shows 
8 per cent of the total phosphorus as organic in the Bx to 
0 per cent in the and C* The Stony Plain on the other, 
hand shows a more uniform decline of from 23 per cent in 
the Ag # 10 per cent in the upper to 0 per cent in the 
lower two horizons* The Breton profile shows a somewhat 
greater proportion of the total phosphorus tied up with 
organic matter in that 32 per cent of the A« 2 * 22 per cent 
of the upper B^, 0 per cent of the lower Bx and 4 per cent 
to 7 per cent of the Xw er two horizons is organic phosphorus* 
The total phosphorus extracted from the unignited 
samples (Table 7) may be considered fairly representative

of the relative amounts and distribution of calcium phosphate 
in Alberta soils* 

Difficultly Soluble Phosphorus 


The concentrat ion of the solvent used to determine 
the difficultly soluble phosphorus was believed to be great 
enough to neutralize the excess bases or lime present in some 
horizons without appreciably affecting its normality* Hence 
all horizons were repeatedly extracted with 200 ee* of 2N 
H 2 SO 4 and no additional amounts of acid were added* The 
results showing the amount of phosphorus dissolved in these 
repeated extracts are given in Table 11* 

The data of Table 11 show that the phosphorus is 
dissolved more rapidly than in the case of pH 5-extraction 
(Table 7)* However, the phosphorus dissolved in the first 
extraction with 2N H 2 SO 4 is in many eases virtually the 
same as the total extracted at pH 5* This is especially 
notable in the lower B^, the B&, and G horizons* In the 
Ai, A 2 and upper B^ horizons of the wooded soils, however, a 
distinct difference is noted* The total amounts extracted 
with 2N H2SO4 show that the phosphorus is almost all 
extracted only in the B 2 and C horizons, whereas in the 
remaining horizons of the various profiles only 50 per cent 
to 75 per cent of the phosphorus is extracted* Further

investigation revealed that even with strong acids it is 
highly improbable that the total phosphorus can be completely 
extracted, especially in the horizons containing relatively 
little or no free lime* 

The increase in the amount of phosphorus extracted 
by 2N HgSO^ over the amount extracted by H 2 SO 4 at pH 5 (last 
column. Table 11) may be taken as representing the amount of 
difficultly soluble phosphorus here referred to as iron 
phosphate* This increase is fairly constant at about 10 
per cent in all horizons of the brown soil, except the By 
or lime horizon, where only 4 per cent of the total phosphorus 
is iron phosphate* In the Beaumont black soil about 12 per 
cent is iron phosphate in the and C horizons with much 
smaller amounts in the and Bg horizons* The Stony Plain 
profile shows a more constant proportion of about 10 per cent 
with slight increases in the horizon* In the wooded 
profiles, however, where leaching has been more severe, a 
gradual increase in the proportion of iron phosphate occurs 
from the surface horizon to the lower B^* The upper 
horizon seems to have the heaviest concentration of iron 
phosphate, while in the horizons below it, the decrease is 
very rapid reaching almost negligible amounts in the B^ or 
lime horizons* 

The data (Table 11) indicate that where an excess 
of calcium carbonate is present the formation of calcium

Effect of Ignition on the Amount of Phosphorus 
and Iron Dissolved by 2N HpSQ ^. In an attempt to again de¬ 
termine the amount of phosphorus held in organic combination, 
the samples were ignited as before and then extracted, with 
2N HgSO^. The data presented in Table 12 Indicate that a 
very considerable portion of the phosphorus Is held in organic 
combination in the surface horizons with a rapid decrease in 
the subsurface horizons* Several horizons of the Breton pro¬ 
file have been selected for Pig* 5 to typify the effect of 
ignition on the amount of phosphorus dissolved by 2 N H 2 SO 4 . 

The high organic matter horizon (as shown by the red lines) 
shows a very great increase in soluble phosphorus in the first 
extract® The subsequent extracts show a rapid decrease in 
the amount extracted, yet these amounts are all higher than 
in the unignited sample. The upper horizon (as plotted 
by the green lines) shows an appreciable increase In the 
amount of phosphorus dissolved in the first extract. In the 
subsequent extracts the amounts decrease very rapidly but 
remain again higher than the amounts in the same extracts of 
the unignited samples. The lower Bg horizon (as indicated 
by the blue lines) shows a slight increase In soluble phos¬ 
phorus due to ignition In the first extract. In the subsequent

extracts the amounts of phosphorus dissolved are very small 
and no different from the amounts found in the unignited 
samples at these stages* 

In all cases, however, a comparison of Figs. 2 and 
3 shows a distinct difference in the rate at which phosphorus 
is dissolved* It is obvious, from the curves In Fig* 3, that 
the amounts of phosphorus dissolved with 2N H 2 SO 4 were 
greater in the initial extracts and decreased more rapidly 
in the subsequent extracts than the amounts dissolved at pH 3 
as shown by the curves in Fig* 2* Furthermore the first 
extract of the lower Bg sample (blue line) shoves in Fig* 3, 
an increase in the amount of phosphorus dissolved after 
ignition rather than a decrease as seen in Fig® 2* The acid¬ 
ity in the case of the 2 N extraction was great enough to 
prevent the reprecipitation of phosphorus that may have occurred 
in the pH 3 extracts. 

The rather wide differences between the soluble 
phosphorus in ignited and unignited samples of some of the 
other horizons (Table 12), notably the upper of the wooded 
profiles and the Bg of the Faille cannot, considering the 
nitrogen analysis (41) of such typical samples, be accounted 
for by organic matter alone® The work of Marais (23) and 
more recently that of Ford (11) shows that heating in some 
manner affects the solubility of certain mineral phosphates*

Bearing this in mind the solubility of iron was 
investigated in the extracts obtained from ignited and un- 
ignited soils* The data of Table 15 Indicate the possible 
occurrence of many forms of iron, some increasing in solu¬ 
bility and others decreasing in solubility after ignition# 

If the iron phosphate occurs as a monohydrate (11) it seems 
that under the conditions of this experiment it should become 
dehydrated, liberating its phosphorus and gradually becoming 
converted to Hematite (FegO^)* In such a ease the amount of 
phosphorus dissolved would be greater while that of iron 
would he less after igniting, due to this reversion to a less 
soluble form# Such may be the case in Beaumont Bi and Bg, 
the Fallis lower and Bg, and in most of the Breton* 

On the other hand there may be a considerable 
liberation of iron found in organic combination (29) due to 
the destruction of organic matter by Ignition* The signifi¬ 
cant increases found in the Provost A^ and Ag, th© Stony 
Plain A]_ may be due to such causes* In the wooded profiles, 
however, there Is a tendency on podsolization for the Iron 
to be removed from the surface to the subsurface horizons 
(18) where it may occur rather as some hydrated form* 

The observations above are borne out by Marais (25) 
who, in studying the effect of heating various phosphate 
minerals at a dull red heat for five hours, concludes that 
ignition has no effect on the availability of'calcium phosphate

but renders the aluminum and iron phosphates remarkably 
more available* This increased availability of the alum¬ 
inum and iron phosphates, he points out, may be due to two 
causes: 

(1) Dehydration of the mineral and dehydration 
of the aluminum and ferric hydrates associated with the 
phosphate* The dehydrated or partially hydrated oxides re¬ 
sulting, are not as soluble as the fully hydrated ones and 
would therefore exert less influence on the solubility of 
the phosphates, their hydrolysis and final assimilation by 
plants • 

(2) Destruction of the physical structure of min** 
erals may greatly alter their solubility* It is pointed out 
that there are large possibilities for accounting for many 
riddles with regard to phosphates on the basis of crystalline 
structure of the minerals, and in this connection the work 

of Quartaroli showing the possibility of an existence of 
various isomeric forms of calcium, and possibly iron and 
aluminum phosphates, is pointed out as a possible solution 
to some of these riddles* Perhaps the variability of calcium 
phosphates, aluminum phosphates, and iron phosphates is due 
to the varying proportions of the different isomers in the 
several minerals* Ignition may or may not alter the pro** 
portions of the various isomers and so exert its effect on 
the availability of the various phosphates*

Relative Proportions of Easily Soluble, Difficultly 
Soluble and Organic Phosphorus in Alberta Soils 


Considering then some of the wide differences 
obtained due to ignition, as shown in Table 12, it becomes 
quite apparent that such differences, as were found for 
example, in the upper Bx of the wooded soils, could not b© 
due solely to the liberation of phosphorus held in organ!© 
combination but also to some change of the mineral phosphates 
brought about by ignition® 

A determination of the phosphorus held in organic 
combination cannot be made with great accuracy by the 
method of ignition, but it is believed that by averaging 
the resulting increases found in Table 8 and in Table 12 
some indication as to the amount of phosphorus held in ©r« 
ganic combination would be obtained® However, the increase 
of phosphorus due to ignition in the pH 5 extraction (Table 
8 ) may serve as a better indication of the amount of phosphor** 
us held in organic combination, especially in the upper 
horizons, since the increase in iron dissolved was not great 
enough to account for any great increase in phosphorus * 

Before ignition it was found that little or no organic 
matter or iron was dissolved at pH 5 (Tables 4 and 10)# 

The total phosphorus extracted at pH 3 (Table 7) 
seems with more certainty to represent the easily soluble 
phosphorus, the chief form of which is calcium phosphate.

since the amounts of iron and organic matter dissolved were 
negligible• 

The difficultly soluble phosphorus, of which the 
chief form is the iron phosphate, cannot be determined with 
certainty from the data presented. However, it seems that some 
fairly indicative results, as to the amount of phosphorus 
occurring in difficultly soluble form, may be obtained by 
difference between the total of the 2 N H 2 SQ 4 extraction 
(Table 11) and the total of the pH 5 extraction (Table 7) or 
similar differences after the soils had been ignited (Table 12, 
Table 8 ). 

The data in Table 14 showing the results obtained 
by these several methods for the easily soluble and difficult* 
ly soluble phosphorus and for the phosphorus held in organic 
combination reveal a considerable variation in the amounts 
obtained* The results sho?/ing the amount of easily soluble 
phosphorus (chiefly calcium phosphate) may be taken as fairly 
indicative of the amount of phosphorus as such occurring in 
Alberta soils. It will be observed that in all oases (except 
Breton upper ) there is an increase of the easily soluble 
or calcium phosphate from 25 per cent to 40 per cent in 
surface horizons to 75 per cent and 80 per cent in the sub* 
surface horizons. In the case of the Breton upper the very 
low proportion of easily soluble phosphorus may be due 
possibly to one of two factors;

(1) There may be a concentration in this horizon 
of very difficultly soluble phosphates due to an accumula¬ 
tion of iron and aluminum colloids. The possible concentra¬ 
tion of such colloids in the upper horizon of the wooded 
soils has been found by Holowaychuk (17) to be due probably 
to a precipitation of these colloids brought down in the 
course of leaching. 

(2) The phosphate at first dissolvod may have been 
reprecipitated, as an excess of bases, ©specially those of 
iron and aluminum may cause probably considerable precipita¬ 
tion of the phosphate ion even at pH 3 (7,21,30). On the 
other hand it must be borne in mind that iron and aluminum 
do not need to enter into solution in order to precipitate 
phosphate from solution, as colloidal iron and aluminum 
hydroxides readily combine with phosphorus in solution (32)® 

The data representative of the difficultly soluble 
phosphorus vary considerably, the widest difference probably 
occurring in the Provost profile. Despite this, it seems 
significant to note that the amounts of difficultly soluble 
phosphorus as indicated in the unignited column (Table 14) 
seem fairly constant in the Provost and Stony Plain profiles, 
except in the heavy lime (Bg) horizon of the Provost. Con¬ 
sidering the fact that these soils are alkaline throughout 
their profiles it seems possible that where such conditions 
naturally prevail the formation of iron phosphate is inhibited.

Especially does this seem the case where the concentration 
of lime is greatest (Provost Such conditions seem most 

favorable for the formation of calcium or other more easily 
soluble phosphorus# On the other hand where the soils are 
more acidic in nature, as in Breton A]_, A2 and upper 
(Table 7) conditions more favorable towards the formation of 
a high content of iron or difficultly soluble phosphorus 
prevail, as shown by the fact that 24 to 45 per cent of the 
total phosphorus in these horizons is difficultly so3„uble 
(Table 14, column 2)# 

Ignition seems to increase the solubility of the 
difficultly soluble phosphorus, especially in the Provost 
profile, due possibly to a breaking down of some of the very 
resistant parent materials, and such increases, where found, 
may be in part due to these more difficultly soluble forms 
being dissolved# It would seem then that an average, (Table 
14, column 2) of these readings would be more representative 
of the difficultly soluble phosphorus in these soils# 

The relative amounts of organic phosphorus as 
obtained by the two methods vary considerably. Igniting the 
soils introduced in the subsurface horizons, at any rate, 
an appreciable error# Considering the differences obtained 
on extracting at pH 3 (Table 14, column 3) decreases are 
seen in many of the horizons while on extracting at 2H 
appreciable increases are noted in such horizons# The data.

however, seem to agree fairly well for at least the surface 
horizons, and it is felt that the differences obtained in the 
two methods will, when averaged, tend to balance each other 
up to such an extent as to give at least some indication of 
the proportion of phosphorus held in organic combination in 
these soils# It is noteworthy that of the total phosphorus 
found in these soils 42 per cent to 67 per cent exists in 
organic combination in the surface horizon# Prom 50 per cent 
the amount decreases very rapidly to 6 per cent in the G 
horizon of the Provost, and from 42 per cent in the Ax of the 
Stony Plain to about 7 per cent in the horizon* In the 
Breton profile the decrease is very gradual in the first 
four horizons (A 0 , Ax, Ag, upper Bx) - from 67 per cent to 
50 per cent - while below this the amount drops off to an 
almost constant average of 7 per cent for the lower three 
horizons• 

Under the most severe conditions of extraction used 
in this investigation; that is, igniting and then continuous¬ 
ly extracting m^ith 2N H 2 SO 4 , it will be noticed (Table 14, 
column 4) that in many cases all of the phosphorus was not 
extracted* The amount remaining represented from 0 per cent 
to 17 per cent of the total, and it is doubtful if even 
\jnder more drastic treatment will the total be extracted from 


some horizons

Pigs* 4, 5 and 6, based on the average amounts of 
easily soluble, difficultly soluble and organic phosphorus 
in these three soils, will perhaps serve better to show the 
relative proportions of these types of phosphorus compounds 
occurring in Alberta soils» 

The data presented in Pig* 4 show that in the 
surface horizons of the brown soils the phosphorus exists 
chiefly as organic phosphorus with about equal but smaller 
proportions of easily soluble and difficultly soluble« In 
the lower horizons phosphorus occurs chiefly as the easily 
soluble type with only a small percentage of the organic 
and difficultly soluble forms, 

In the black soils (Figo 5) the and Ag horizons 
contain phosphorus chiefly in the organic and easily soluble 
forms with only a very small percentage as difficultly sol*# 
uble* In the horizons below this the organic phosphorus 
decreases while the difficultly soluble remains about the 
same* Both these, however, occur In small amounts as com* 
pared to the easily soluble, which seems to be by far the 
most important form of phosphorus in these horizons* 

Similarly the wooded soils (Fig* 6) have In their 
thin A 0 horizons the largest proportion of the total phosphorus 
in organic combination, a considerable amount as easily soluble 
and only a relatively small amount as difficultly soluble*

In the lower horizons, on the other hand, the proportion of 
phosphorus in organic combination decreases quite rapidly 
and the easily soluble and difficultly soluble forms predom¬ 
inate • The A]_, Ag and upper horizons show the organic, 
easily soluble and difficultly soluble phosphorus to be of 
approximate equal importance, with the amount found as easily 
soluble slightly less than either of the other forms. Below 
the upper horizon the easily soluble form is found to be 
increasingly predominant and the organic and difficultly 
soluble forms represent deoreasingly small to insignificant 
amounts. 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


(1) The various horizons of typical brown, black and 
gray wooded profiles were studied in an effort to 
determine the solubility and distribution of phosphorus 0 

(2) Surface sampling alone is inadequate as a means of 
determining the phosphorus value of a soil* Plant roots 
feed much below this surface horizon, hence the determin¬ 
ation of phosphorus in subsurface horizons seems necessary 
to show the amount and forms of phosphorus present for 
possible utilization as plant food*

One extraction alone, especially in the case of 
weak acid solvents (e.g. .002N H 2 S0 4 ) is insufficient 
to show the solubility of phosphorus in that solvent. 
Repeated extractions are necessary. 

In addition to giving a better representation of 
the soluble phosphorus, repeated extractions tend to 
show the relative solubility or soil supplying power of 
phosphorus in various soils and soil horizons. 

In determining the vertical distribution of easily 
soluble soil phosphorus, extraction at the same pH 
value in the extracts from all horizons is necessary, 
for in the case of calcareous B 2 & nd C horizons, no 
idea as to the amount of easily soluble phosphorus would 
have been obtained If they had not been extracted at the 
same pH value as the A and upper B horizons. 

Easily soluble phosphorus, as determined by re¬ 
peated extractions with .002U H 2 SO 4 buffered to a pH 3, 
is found to be present in much larger quantities in the 
B l* b 2 ar *d c horizons of the brown profile than in the 
Ax horizon. In the black profiles it is present in 
considerable amounts in the surface horizons, then de¬ 
creases in the upper B^ and lower Bx horizons, but 
increases to form a large percentage of the total phos¬ 
phorus in the B 2 or lime horizon. The gray wooded

profiles have a medium amount of easily soluble 
phosphorus in their A 0 and k-± horizon, a very small 
amount in the A<> and upper B^, and then increasingly 
large amounts in the lower upper and lower Bg 

horizons« 

(7) Difficultly soluble phosphorus, as determined by 

average difference between total extracted with 2N 
H^S04 and H^SC^ at pH 3 from both ignited and unignited 
samples, is found to be fairly low in all horizons of 
the brown soil, the parent material included 1 * Only very 
minor differences, as to the amount of this form, 
occur between the different horizons. In the black 
profile, the amount of phosphorus found as difficultly 
soluble is practically the same in all horizons* The 
horizons are very low in this type of phosphorus with 
the Ag and upper B]_ horizons a little lower than the 
rest * 

The gray wooded profiles show a very small amount 
of difficultly soluble phosphorus in the A2 horizon, 
and a much greater amount in the A^, where it occurs 
in about the same proportion as the easily soluble* 

Below the A^ horizon the amount of difficultly soluble 
decreases gradually, being greater than the easily soluble 
in the heavily leached Ag and upper horizons, but

assuming very insignificant proportions below the upper 
horizon* It is noteworthy that the A^, A2 and upper 
B]_ horizons of the wooded soils were the only ones in 
this investigation that showed a slightly greater amount 
of difficultly soluble than of easily soluble phosphorus* 

(8) Organic phosphorus, as determined by difference 
between the total amounts extracted by the different 
solvents from soils before and after ignition, occurs 
in large amounts in the A© and A^ horizons, notably in 
the gray wooded profiles, but below these surface horizons 
the quantities of organic phosphorus rapidly diminish 
approaching Insignificant amounts in the Bg and parent 
material horizons * 

(9) Ignition of soils at 600°G. for one hour renders a 
pronounced difference in the amount of phosphorus dis¬ 
solved by 2N HgS0 4 or HgSQ 4 at pH 3* In the upper or 
organic matter horizons there 13 a large increase due 
to the destruction of the organic Matter* In the lower 
horizons, however, the differences due to ignition are 
much smaller* On extracting at pH 3 decreases are found 
in the B 2 and C horizons of the Provost profile and in 
the lower B^ horizons of the Stony Plain and Breton pro¬ 
files. However, there is a pronounced increase in the 
horizons of all profiles when extracted by 2N Hs30 4 *

These increases seem to be due not only to the des- 
truction of organic matter but also to some change 
in the solubility of mineral phosphates after ignition# 
(10) Neutralization of extracts with 1-1 ammonia has 

an intensifying effect on the blue color produced in 
the test for phosphorus# Since this intensification 
becomes more pronounced with an increase in the amount 
of ammonia used, the effect may be due to interfering 
ammonia salts# 


ACKNOWLEDGMENT 


The writer wishes to express his appreciation 
to Dr# P# A# Wyatt, Head of the Department of Soils, 
under whose direction this investigation has been carried 
out, and to Dr# A# Leahey for their advice, supervision 
and criticism of the manuscript; also to Mr# J# L# 

Doughty and others for their co-operation and helpful 
suggestions#
