A STUDY OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING THE PRODUCTION AND COST 


OF PRODUCTION OF MILK IN THE 

EDMONTON AND CALGARY AREAS 


SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE STUDY 

During the past few years producers and distributors, both in Ed¬ 
monton and Calgary have encountered many problems with respect to the milk 
industry* The producers, especially those shipping milk to the distribut¬ 
ing plants, claim that the existing prices received from their milk are not 
sufficient to cover the costs incurred in producing the milk. The city 
sweet price, i*e. f the price received from that portion of the milk being 
sold as whole milk, may be sufficient to cover costs of production, but a 
large portion of each producer’s total production of milk is sold as surplus 
milk at a much lower price, which brings down the aggregate price received 
from milk to such a low figure that many dairymen claim that the income 
received frcm milk is less than the cost of producing the milk. Some pro¬ 
ducers are of the opinion that the distributors realize too large a profit 
on thi s surplus milk* 

The distributing plants claim they are not receiving excessive profits, 
and they also maintain they are not receiving a steady supply of sufficient¬ 
ly high quality milk i^iich can be used for their city sweet trade. 

A discussion of the whole problem is far beyond the scope of this 
thesis, and in order that some significant facts may be shown, the study

will be limited to "The Factors Influencing the Production and G ost of 
Production of Milk in the Edmonton and Calgary Areas”. 

To find the cost of producing 100 lbs. of milk is not the sole aim of 
this study. The cost in itself is of little value. The purpose is to analyse 
the various factors making up the cost and to show how they effect the pro¬ 
duction and the cost and hence the returns received free? milk. The fame? 
is not interested in the physical output except in the sense that it in¬ 
fluences his income, The problem then is to find the eanbination of factors 
giving the highest production with the greatest net return. To attain this 
end the cost and amounts of the separate factors making up the total cost 
of producing 100 lbs. F.C.M^ have been calculated. 

Since the west has become more densely populated, new land is not as 
plentiful as it formerly was, and the prices of g)od land have increased. 
Consequently the farmer must get larger returns per acre if he wishes to 
receive the same profit as previously. More attention must be given to ef¬ 
ficient methods of production in order that the cost of production may be 
reduced. Probably the first step in lowering the cost is to find out as 
accurately as possible what the various costs are, and then by comparison 
with costs of similar studies, methods may be devised ¥/hereby those costs 
that are too high can be lowered. 

Many of the costs involved in the production of a commodity, especial¬ 
ly in agriculture, are joint costs, and can not be allocated directly to the 
production of one specific commodity. Nevertheless, where the same tech¬ 
nique is used in calculating the various milk production costs between the 
different producers, it is possible to use the figures obtained as a means 
of comparison of the effeeiency of the different dairymen. As John A. Hopkins

and Paul T e gler (46) state: "When figures are constructed with care they 
are usable as indicators of efficiency in particular enterprises as between 
farms, but such use should be limited to groups of farms operating under 
essentially similar conditions and in the same year", and later they go on 
to say that: "One of the least questioned uses of costs per unit of pro¬ 
duce seems to be for the purpose of comparing effeciency in the production 
between different farms"* There seems to be little contention of this point, 
but criticism does arise when an attempt is made to determine what the price 
should be frcm these arbitrary cost of production figures® Therefore, the 
primary purpose of this study will be to show and explain the differences 
in efficiency and costs of production of milk between the different farms 
within the Calgary and Edmonton districts* during a similar period of time* 

DESCRIPTION AND COMPARISON OF THE AREAS STUDIED 

Before entering into a discussion of the main body of the thesis, it 
is necessary to not© sane of the differences that exist between these two- 
areas - Calgary and Edmonton, and point out the influences that the environ¬ 
mental factors present in these areas may have on later discussion* 

The population of the two areas of Calory and Edmonton is similar, 
83,761 and 79,197 (1931 Census) respectively. The total milk consumption is 
around 25,000,000 lbs* a year in both cities, and at the present time both 
produce a substantial surplus, approximately 4($. Baring the past year, 
however, Calgary has had shortages, and there have been periods since the 
War when the Calgary distributors have had to go far afield to secure a suf¬ 
ficient volume of milk to meet the demand* During the past years the pro- 








- 4 - 


duction in Calgary has varied considerably more than in ^dmonton. A drop 
from 449 licensed dairymen in Calgary in 1928 to 395 in 1955 gives son® in¬ 
dication of tiie cyclic nature of the business in that city. In Edmonton 
there has not been the wide fluctuation in the number of licensed dairymen. 

At the present time there is a total of 226 licensed dairymen in Edmonton, 

220 producer shippers and 47 producer distributors. 

Edmonton is in the parkland black soil belt, while Calgary belongs to 
the prairie dark brown soil area. Over a forty-nine year period the average 
rainfall in Edmonton was 17.27 inches, and in Calgary over a fcrty*-eight 
year period the average was 16.60 inches. The seasonal distribution of 
rainfall, however, does vary considerably more than these figures indicate. 
These physical factors contribute to the more sporadic yields in the Calgary 
area, and are the main reasons for the instability of the farming in that 
area as compared to the Edmonton area. Also, Calgary is the centre of 
several speculative industries such as the oil business, tourist trade, and 
t m prairie wheat trade, which contribute to the instability of that district. , 
The average size of farm for the Edmonton producer shipper is 278 
acres, of which 177 acres are in crop land and only 53 acres in pasture. 

For the Calgary producer shipper, the average size of the farm is 571 acres, 
of which 199 acres are in crop land and 141 acres in pasture* 

Farm indebtedness was higher in the Edmonton area than in the Calgary 
area, but at the same time the capitalization and also the net equity were 
higher in the farmer area* (Table 1).

Since there was more certainty and stability in the Edmonton farm¬ 
ing district as compared to the Calgary district, there was a greater tend¬ 
ency to build up the farms more in that area, and also to invest more 
money in machinery and livestock* 

The breeds of dairy cattle and their proportions are similar in both 
areas, approximately 90$ of the farm herds being predominately Holstein and 
10$ Shorthorns, Jerseys, and of mixed breeding. Less than 20$ of the herds 
were partially or completely made up of pure breeds. The average production 
per cow was higher in Edmonton (7895 lbs.) than in Calgary (6559 lbs.). 

The average test was slightly higher in the Calgary district (3 f 65) as 
compared to (5.57) the Edmonton area. 

REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

In this section on the review of literature, only those results 
will be given that pertain to this analysis. In many of the studies reviewed 
it was difficult to ascertain whether any conclusions had been reached. 
However only those results will be given that appear to be quite definitely 
stated. 

1. Production per Cow :- It was quite universally concluded that the dom¬ 
inant factor affecting the total cost of producing milk was the yield per 
cow. This factor was brought out in many of the studies (16), (2), (5), 

(8), (9).

2» Factors Affecting Production per Cow and the Cost :- There was not 
the universal agreement here as in the ease of production per cow* Most 
workers, however, agreed that feed and the inherent capacity of the cows 
were the most important factors affecting the yield per cow and the cost 
of producing milk* 

(a) Feed:- Ezekiel McNall and Morrison (8) concluded that th© nutritive 
ratio and T*D.N. were the two main factors of the feed that influenced the 
yield per cow and the cost of producing milk* Pond and Ezekiel (11) came 
to similar conclusions. Oatherwood (12) pointed out that th© increase in 
production for increase in grain was not in a direct ratio, and that heavier 
feeding may not always be profitable* Most of the investigators (55) (16) 

(26) (45) state that feeding large quantities of concentrates to the cows 
was generally not profitable unless the cows had th© inherent ability to 
utilize the concentrates fed* Hampson (54) points out that the relative 
prices of feed and milk influence the kind of feeds fed* 

(b) Inherent Capacity of th© Cow:- Several of the studies (5), (11), 

(12), (16), (45), list the inherent capacity of the cots to produce milk as 
the dominant factor affecting the milk production and the cost of producing 
milk. Ross, Hall and Rhode (5) state that "If production is increased by 
increasing the potential ability of the herd, the amount of* nutrients con¬ 
sumed per unit of produce decreases at an ever increasing rate". There were, 
however, different viewpoints. Some of the workers accepted the cows as they 
were found on the farm and indicated methods of increasing the yield of 
these cows, while others pointed out methods of increasing the production by 
securing better cows with greater inherent ability* 

(c) Fat Test:- The fat test was considered by some of the investigators (8), 





(11) as having a direct relation to the production of milk and income from 

milk. Pond and Ezekiel (11) found that fat test accounted for 4G.1$ in the 

variation in the yield of milk. Ezekiel, McNall and Morrison (8) attributed 

only 18.6$ of the variation in the yield of milk to differences in the fat 

test. Gaines and Davidson (40) me to the conclusion that the yield of 

milk is inversely proportional to the energy value of the milk solids per 

1 

unit of milk, and they derived the formula F.C.M. equals .4 M §lus 15 F 
to bring all milk to a 4 % fat level. In a later bulletin (39) Gaines 
substantiates the conclusions arrived at in (40). 

(d) Season of Freshening:- After feed, inherent capacity of cows, and fat 
test, the season of freshening appeared to have the neatest affect on the 
yield per cow. In many of the studies (8), (9), (11), (IS), (16), (27), 
the investigators point out the influence of this factor, and the general 
conclusion was that fall freshening gave a larger production than freshening 
at any other season of the year. Selby, Burrier and Brandt (16) concluded 
that "Fall freshening tends to prolong the milking period and increase the 
total production since the cows *§*eshened ? twice during the year, once when 
they calve in the fall and again when pasture comes in the spring". 

5. Labor :- Labor was found to be the largest individual cost item except 
feed, and consequently was concluded to have a significance bearing on the 
cost of producing milk (14), (15), (16), (17), (9), (44). Generally, how¬ 
ever, no mention was mad© of any close relationship between the hours of 
labor used and the yield per cow, although a few (44), (8), state that the 
higher producing cows require less labor per 100 lbs. milk than the lower 
producing cows. Others (14, (15), (17), came to the conclusion that size 
of herd and efficiency of the labor had the greatest affect on the amount 

^F.C.Mo - See Page 12. 





of labor used. Selby, Burrier and B ra ndt (16) go further by stating that 
the efficiency depends upon size of farm, equipment avaiable, and arrange¬ 
ment of fam buildings. Stephens, (17), claimed the optimum size of the herd 
depended upon the size of the farm. 

4» Minor Cost Items :- The remaining cost items such as annual cow cost, 
building charge, bull charge and the innumerable miscellaneous items of 
cost, were treated differently by the different investigators. They were 
generally considered as having only a minor affect upon the total cost of 
producing milk. Adams (4) classified them as indirect charges, while feed 
and labor made up the direct charges. 

5. Management :- Many of the studies (4), (8), (9), (11), pointed out that 
management was an important factor affecting tie economical production of 
milk. However, vary few attempted to classify the farms according to the 
managerial ability of the daiiyman. Pond and Ezekiel (11) classified the 
manager as good, fair, poor and unsatisfactory, and concluded that manage¬ 
ment was the most important factor affecting the production of milk. Under 
management they include all of the previous factors mentioned, and state that 
a good manager was that dairyman who used the combination of factors that 
gave the largest production of milk for the least cost. Ezekiel, Me Nall 
and Morrison (8) state in the following way: "The economical production 
of milk depends upon the proper combinations of all of the elements concerned 
in the dairy enterprise with regard to basic physical relations and existing 
costs and prices". 

The following table was compiled by Selby, Burrier and Brandt (16) 
(Table 61) and represents the result of seventy-three published reports 
throughout the United States on the cost of producing milk.

Methods of Analysis a a Used by Other Investi gators 

Three methods have been used to analyse the dairy farm business 
and determine the cost of producing milk as pointed out by Severence and 

Hare (3). 

1, The Farm Basis :- According to this method eYery expense incurred in 
operating the entire farm business is assumed to be an expense of operating 
the dairy, and all receipts other than milk and its products including 
cpops, etc., are subtracted from the grass cost of operating the farm, and 
what is left is the net cost of producing milk. This method is satisfactory 
where the farms are highly specialized and dairying is the major enterprise. 
It is useful in that it shows the farm as a unit, and does not necessitate 
splitting of the various costs, such as interest, depreciation, etc., but 
it is not practicable for an analysis where individual costs are wanted to 
















if < t 








- 10 - 


show their separate affects on the whole cost of producing milk. Under this 
method non-dairy enterprises, if they prove to be profitable, will decrease 
the cost of producing 100 lbs. of milk, whereas if they prove unprofitable 
they will increase the cost of producing 100 lbs. of milk. 

8. Herd basis :- On this basis the herd is assumed to be the unit, and all 
the expenses contracted in maintaining dairy stock of all ages are treated 
as an expense of the production of milk. AH receipts other than from the 
sale of milk and its products including receipts from the sale of young 
stock, are subtracted from the gross cost of operating the herd to determine 
the net cost of pro dicing milk. Other enterprises such as production of 
crops, etc. are treated as an independent fam business, and all the feed 
fed is charged at its market value. This method is satisfactory where the 
herd is used primarily for the production of milk, but it is obvious that 
analysing expensive purebred herds and the Imer valued grad© herds by this 
method would lead to such a variability that the t m herds would not be on 
a comparable basis, since the sale of the livestock would materially af¬ 
fect the cost of producing the milk. Hence this method of analysis is not 
always satisfactory. 

5. Cow Basis Under this method the dairy herd consisting of all mature 
cows and the herd sire, are considered the unit, and all the costs incurred 
by them are considered as the costs of the production of milk. Every product 
of the farm used by the producing herd is charged to milk production at its 
market value at the farm, regardless of what it may have cost to produce. 

Since the maintainance of the dan and sire is charged to milk production, 
the value of the calves at birth is credited to milk production, but the 
raising of these calves is considered as a separate unit. This method of

analysis of the cost of producing milk was regarded as the most applicable 
for this study. It permits the producer to compare his cost with that o t 
other producers, and thus enables him to lower those costs which are high 
by following methods similar to those used by other producers whose costs 
are lower. 

This method of procedure which is often called the "cost accounting 
method" is important for the following reasons: 

(I) It shows the individual producer whether his dairy is profitable and 
enables him ? by careful analysis^ to detect which operations of the dairy are 
unprofitable or which costs are too high. 

(II) It enables the producer to increase his efficiency by comparison with 
other studies. At the same time the farmer is able to detect where his 
costs are high and can devise means of lowering them. 

(III) The dairy producer nay be getting a fair return from his farm and 
still be losing money from the production of milk. In such cases it would 

be to his advantage to dispose of his dairy herd and develop the more profit¬ 
able enterprises of his farm. The cost accounting method does not show which 
farm enterprise is the most profitable, but it dees show in so far as the 
various costs can be separated, the exact status of the dairy enterprise. 

METHOD Or COLLECTIIIG DATA AND METHOD OF AKALYSIS 
The data was obtained by the survey method, each dairyman being per¬ 
sonally interviewed by the field enumerator. There were sixty-eight records 
taken during the summer of 1934, forty-one in the Edmonton and twenty-seven in 
the Calgary milk sheds. The farms visited were picked at random, although 
an attempt was made to get as representative a sample as possible. The 
information was obtained by personal interviews with the dairymen, and lasted

from one to two hours, during which time the producer gave actual and est¬ 
imated figures to the enumerator of the details of his business* 

The primary purpose of the original survey was to determine the profit¬ 
ableness of dairying and the relation of the factors influencing the selection 
of the farm "setup" on the dairy farms in the immediate vicinity of Edmon¬ 
ton and Calgary. Since the records were not originally made for an analysis 
of the cost of producing milk, seme difficulty was encountered in allocating 
the various costs directly to milk production. In some cases it was neces¬ 
sary to make certain calculations according to the results of other investig¬ 
ators who made surveys of a similar type and in similar areas. 

METHOD OF ANALYSIS 

The method of allocating the cost to the production of milk will be 
discussed under the following headings:- feed, labor, buildings, cow charge 
and miscellaneous charge. 

The total production of milk was corrected to a 4$ basis before it was 
used to calculate the average costs per 100 lbs. F.C.M. for the various items, 
^he milk was brought to a 4$ basis according to the following formula as 
worked out by Gaines and Davidson (40):- F.Ojfl. equals .4 M plus 15 F. # 
where F.C.M. is fat corrected milk and Mis actual yield of milk, and F 
is the actual yield of fat. This formula corrects the milk yield for the 
influence of the fat content and brings it to a physiological equivalent 
of 4$ milk. 

1. Feed 

^he dairymen gave an estimation of the amount and value of the feed 
fed to the dairy herd during the past year (1935-54). %ere the feed was 
home grown it was valued at prevailing market prices.

The T*D*N* (total digestible Nutrients) contained in each feed was 
calculated according to Henry and Morrison Tables (43). ^he T.D.N. consumed 
by the dairy cow while on pasture were calculated according to the results 
of Hodgson, Grunder, Knott and Ellington (41). 'i'hey used the term "cow day” 
and found that on the average a cow consumed 16 lbs. of T.D.N. per day while 
on pasture. In the records the farmer gave an estimation of the months his 
cows were on pasture during the year. 

As a means of comparison with the actual T.D.N. the theoretical T«B*N. 
required by a herd to produce a given amount of milk was also calculated 
according to Henry and Morrison standards (43). They gave tables showing 
the nuctoer of pounds of T.E.N. required fcr maintainance of a one thousand 
pound cow, and the number of pounds of T.D.N. required to produce a pound of 
milk for different butter fat tests. As the weights of the cows were not 
known they were assumed (after examining records of weights of cows of dif¬ 
ferent herds) to be 1250 lbs. for the average Holstein, and 950 lbs. for the 
average Jersey. Practically all the herds encountered could be classified under 
these two average weights. 

Value of Pasture 

In this study the farmer did not give the value per acre of his 
pasture land, but only the value per acre of his total farm including all 
improvements• It was concluded after comparing land values that the value 
per acre of the pasture was approximately one-half of the total land value 
per acre. Five per cent of this was taken as the annual cost per acre per 
cow. This was considered hi^i enough in the localities under study to in¬ 
clude the total pasture expense per cow per acre. Larson and Putney (44) 
worked out the pasture charge in a similar manner. After calculating the 






- 14 - 


pasture charge it was added on to the other feed costs to obtain the total 
feed cost. 

From the calculations on feed the following figures were obtained: 

(a) Cost of Feed per cow 

(b) Cost of Feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

(c) Theoretical T.D.N. required per 100 lbs* F.C.M* 

(d) Actual T.D.N. fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

Labor 

In the records the farmers gave an estimation of the number of hours 
of labor spent in the dairy each day. They also gave the valuation and the 
number of months of hired and family labor used on the farm during the year 
(1933-34) • From this information the number of hours used to produce 100 
lbs. F.C.M. and also the value of labor per hour were calculated. The value 
per hour was based upon the assumption that the farmer worked on an average 
of twelve hours a day, which appeared to be the tendency for the dairymen in 
these two areas. It was also assumed that the coot of labor per hour on the 
whole farm and in the dairy were the same. 

The theoretical amount of labor for 100 lbs. F.C.M. was calculated 

according to the results of Venstrom and Headley (15) who demonstrated that 

for every addition of one cow to the herd, the chore time was reduced by 1.6 

hours per cow per year. They worked out the fbllowing table for the number 

of hours of labor required for the various sized herds: 

10 cows - 148 hours per cow per year

Using this as the theoretical amount of labor retired for the various 


sizes of herds, the theoretical number of hours required to p?oduce 100 lbs

F.G.M. was calculated. Thus for labor, the following results were obtained. 

(a) Cost of labor per cow 

(b) Cost of labor per 100 lbs. F.C.M* 

(c) Theoretical number of hours required to produce 100 lbs. F.C.m. 

(d) Actual number of hours required to produce 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

3* Building Charge 

The building charge includes the interest, depreciation, taxes, insur¬ 
ance, and repairs which were chargeable against the dairy herd. Since feed 
was charged at the market value, storage buildings were not included in the 
cost of milk production. Interest was charged at 5 $ and depreciation at 4$. 
The taxes and insurance costs were obtained by calculating the proportion 
of the total insurance and taxes which were chargeable against the dairy 
herd. Other workers (6), (7), (14) used similar methods for finding the build¬ 
ing charge. 

4. Annual Cow Charge 

The annual cow charge consists of taxes, insurance, interest and dep¬ 
reciation. In this study there were no taxes nor insurance on the cow. 

Hence these two items did not enter into the annual cow charge. Interest 
was computed at 5$ on the estimated value of the cow. Since the records did 
not contain complete information on the depreciation of the herd, it was 
necessary to use an average figure obtained from the results of other in¬ 
vestigators. After reviewing the literature on depreciation (15), (16), 

(44), (1), (3), (4), (6), (7), it appeared that 7|was the average of the 
reports investigated, and was used to calculate the depreciation charge of 
the cows in this study. The interest was added to the depreciation to give 
the total cow charge for the cows in these areas.

5. Miscellaneous Charges 

The miscellaneous cost includes the following items:- breeding fees, 
equipment charge, hauling milk, veterinary fees, feed grinding, milk license, 
gas and oil used for pumping water, and other incidental costs which are 
attributable to the production of milk, Where the producer was also a 
distributor the cost of bottles and caps was added to the miscellaneous 
costs. 

In most of the other studies the bull charge was kept separate, but 
in this study the bull cost was so snail that it was included under miscel¬ 
laneous charge. The cost of feed and labor for the bull was included in the 
total feed and labor costs for the herd. Depreciation on the bull was charged 
at 2$ of his given value. This is in accordance with Selby and Jones (57) 
vrork on the cost of keeping dairy bulls. 

Ten per cent was charged for the depreciation and repairs on all 
equipment and 5$ as interest on that portion of the equipment used by the 
dairy herd. For most of the producer distributors it was impossible to dif¬ 
ferentiate the cost of labor for hauling milk frcm the cost of farm labor, 
and hence it was not included in the labor charge or miscellaneous charge 
of these groups. 

Credits 

The cost figures represent the total costs without any credits be¬ 
ing deducted for calves or manure. The calves at birth were valued very 
low, and often they were given no valuation except in the pare bred herds. 
Also, the value of manure was not ascertained; however many farmers re¬ 
gard the cost of hauling it away equal to the value. Hence these two items

would have little if any effect on the costs of milk production in these two 

areas. 

RELATIONSHIP OF THE PROHJCTION PER COW TO THE COST CF EROEHJCING 

miit 

In this section only the total costs will be considered. The indiv¬ 
idual items will be left for later discussion* The cost of production fig¬ 
ures will first be presented and analysed, showing variability and relation¬ 
ships between different groups. Finally an analysis will be made of the re¬ 
lationship between the total cost and the yield per cow. 

There are two groups, P*S, and P*D, (producer shippers and producer 
distributors) in both the Edmonton and the Calgary areas. -Each of these 
groups are divided into classes according to the average production per cow. 
These classes are arranged in order of increasing production per cow. 

The annual cow costs per cow and par 100 lbs. F.C.M. is given for the sep¬ 
arate items, feed, labor, building charge, cow charge and miscellaneous cost. 
For each group the averages of the various items are given with their per¬ 
centage of the total. 

Tables 3 and 4 give the annual costs per cow with totals, averages 
and percentages for the various items of the P.S. and P.N, groups of the 
Edmonton and Calgary areas respectively. Tables 5 and 6 show the costs 
per 100 lbs. F.C.M. with totals, averages and percentages for the various 
items for all the groups of both areas. Generally,as the production in¬ 
creased in all the groups the annual cost per cow increased btfc the cost 
per 100 lbs. F.C.M. decreased. 

There was a greater variation in production per cow for the Calgary 
area than for the Edmonton area, but the average production was much higher

for both the P.S. and P.D. groups of the Edmonton area. The average valu¬ 
ation per cow was also hi^ier for the P.S. of the Edmonton area as compared 
with the P.S. of the Calgary area, i.e., $49.00 as compared to $39.00. 

The greater stability and suitability of the dairying in the Edmonton area 
as compared with the Calgary area probably indicates the reason there are 
higher producing cows and higher valued cows in the Edmonton district. 

The average annual total cost per cow was $91.83 for the Edmonton P.S* 
group and $76.49 for the Calgary P.S. group. Each of the individual items 
for the cows in the EdPionton area was consistently higher than for the cows 
in the Calgary area. This indicates the dairymen who had a higher production 
and therefore a greater income from milk gave more feed and care to their 
dairy cows than the low producer, and also had more valuable buildings and 
daily cows. The higier average production per cow for Edmonton P.S. as 
compared to the average pro diction for the Calgary P.S. was indirectly the 
main reason why the Edmonton P.S. annual total cow costs were high. In the 
Edmonton P.S. group there was no class below 4000 lbs., while in ti© Calgary 
P.S. there were three producers in this class. This would tend to give 
Calgary P.S. lower average annual total cow costs than for Edmonton P.S. 
However, when the similar classes in the Edmonton and Calgary areas were 
compared, annual cow costs were still higher for the Edmonton P.S. 

Even though the average value of hay in Calgary was $8.64 per ton and 
$6.69 in Edmonton and labor was worth $ *081 per hour in Calgary and $ .0695 
in Edmonton, still the Edmonton P.S. had the higher annual total cow costs 
because their average production was higher, which caused these producers 
to use more feed and labor. 

It has been previously brought to the reader’s attention that the

higher valuation of cows and buildings in the Edmonton area gave a higher 
cow cost and building charge than for the Calgary area* This is clearly 
demonstrated in the tables* The average building cost per cow for the Ed¬ 
monton P.S. was $9*41 as compared to $5.05 for Calgary and the annual cow 
cost was $6.79 and $4.98 respectively* Further and more conclusive p?oof of 
this point is given by comparing the figures for these items for the correspond¬ 
ing classes of the different areas. It can be noted that the costs are con¬ 
sistently higher for the classes in the Edmonton area* For example, in the 
last class of the P.S. of both areas, the building and cov; costs were $11.25 
and $7.86 respectively for Edmonton, and $5.46 and $5.50 for Calgary. 

For the P.D. in Calgary the variation of the annual total costs per 
cow was from $101.61 to $149.70 with the average at $123.49. The one Edmonton 
P.D. had an annual total cost per cow of $104.85. 

The second class of the Calgary P.D. had a much higher cost than either 
of the other classes due primarily to a higher feed cost - $>83.95 as compared 
to $62.89 and $59.88 for the two adjacent classes. This wide difference in 
feed costs will be explained later. 

The average cost per 100 lbs. F.G.M. (Tables 5 and 6) was approximately 
$1.24 for both the Edmonton and Calgary P.S. For the P.D. the average cost 
was much higher, $1.88 for Calgary P.D. and $1.54 for the one Edmonton P.D. 

The reason for the higher production costs of the P.D. will become mere ap¬ 
parent as the analysis proceeds. It may, however, be mentioned that there 
was a tendency for a higher feed, labor and miscellaneous cost fat the P.D. 
greup, which was due indirectly to a relatively higher selling price received 
for the milk sold by this group. 

Graph 1 illustrates the relationship between the cost per 100 lbs. 

F.C.M. of the P.S. and P.D. of both areas. It was expected, since Edmonton 
P.S. had a higher average production, they would have the lower cost per 100

lbs. F.C.M. than for the Calgary P.S. group vhere the production was lower. 
Actually, as shown, the costs per 100 lbs. F.C.M. were the same for both 
areas. The Graph illustrates that the lower feed cost per 100 lbe* F.C.M. 
for the Edmonton P.S. was offset by the hi^aer building and miscellaneous 
cost which accounts for the same average total cost for both areas. The 
question arises whether a hi^ier milk production would be justified if the 
lower feed and labor costs which accrue through higher production are mere 
than offset by the higher cow, building and miscellaneous charges. A higher 
production gives a greater volume of milk to be sold, and hence the total 
net profits received from milk may be greater for those producers with high 
producing cows than for those producers with low producing cows, even though 
the cost of producing 100 lbs. F.C.M. is equal to or slightly less than the 
cost for the lower producers. 

further investigation of these tables, and especially the Edmonton P.S, 
group, demonstrates the inverse relationship of the annual total cow cost to 
the cost per 100 lbs,* F.C.M., and leads to a discussion of the relationship 
of the cost of production of milk to the yield per cow. As production goes 
up there is more feed, labor, and the other items of production involved, 
which gives the cow a higher annual total coot. If these added costs were 
more than the added income due to the greater quantity of milk produced, then 
the producer would suffer a loss from increasing the production of milk, 
but if the added income exceeds the added cost, then the pro dicer benefits 
from the increased production. 

Forcing a cow to produce a greater qmnfcity of milk, by increasing the 
feed allowance does not mean the cost will be less per 100 lbs. of milk pro¬ 
duced. The ’’forcing" involves the law of diminishing returns as found by 
Ezekiel, McNall and Morrison (8). They make the following statement: "There 

were marked diminishing returns, however, for the herds producing more

than 7000 lbs. "• 

It can be noted in Tables 5 and 6 that the cost per 100 lbs. F.O.M. 
continues to decrease as production increases. The decrease is more uniform 
for the Edmonton P.S. than for either of the Calgary groups. As production 
increased over 7000 lbs. there was not sufficient increase in the cost of 
production of 100 lbs. F.C.M. to indicate that diminishing returns had set 
in. Apparently the production could be increased still further without in¬ 
creasing the costs per 100 lbs. F.G.M.; however more data would be neces¬ 
sary to find how high production could be increased in this area to obtain 
the lowest cost per 100 lbs. F.C.M# There is, however, another point of 
view worthy of consideration. The cows in the different classes and within 
each class, differ in their Inherent ability to produce milk. For those 
cows with lew inherent ability, diminishing returns would set in at a lower 
production level than for those cows with a sweater inherent ability to pro¬ 
duce milk. 

According to a study conducted by Craig (45) who analysed these same 
records by a different method, those producers making a profit on their total 
farm industry were predominately P.D. Only one of the eighteen P.S. in 
Calgary realized a profit, while five of the nine P.D. were in the profit 
gyoup. In the Edmonton area only ei^at of the thirty-nine P.S. received 
net returns. The one Edmonton P.D. obtained a large net return. In every 
case those P.S. making a profit had a lower net return than the P.D. who 
were in the profit group. The P.D. had practically no surplus, while the 
P.S. sold from 2C$> to 40fo of their milk at sirplus milk prices. This fact 
apparently gave the P.D. more incentive to increase production than those whose 
net income per 100 lbs. of milk was much lower. Hence the profit group.

as illustrated by the P.D#, attempted to secure and maintain a high production 
by giving more feed and care to their cows, even though this practice in¬ 
creased their annual cow costs and cost per 100 lbs. F.G.M. ^hus, while the 
total costs per 100 lbs. F.C.M. were much higher for P.D. than P.S#, the 
production per cow was not on the average any greater, and it was consider¬ 
ably less than the Edmonton P.S, This indicates that the cows of the P.D. 
did not, as a whole, have the inherent ability to produce milk as cheaply 
as Ihe cows of the P.S, In other words, the P.D. had a tendency to feed more 
grain and hay than their cows could utilize most efficiently. 

Comparing corresponding production classes between the different 
groups, ( Cables 5 and 6) show higher total costs for the P.D. Apparently dim¬ 
inishing returns had set in for these P.D, classes as compared with the P.S. 
classes. The cows of the corresponding classes, however, may not be of sim¬ 
ilar inherent ability. It is impossible, then to compare different groups 
of cows with different inherent ability. The general point of diminishing 
returns m^r be arrived at for any group of cows, but varies for the individ¬ 
uals of that group, and would not necessarily be the same for any two groups. 
As the prediction gpes up the annual cow costs go up, but the cost per 100 
lbs* E.C.M. goes down until the point of diminishing returns is reached. 

This point of diminishing returns varies with the inherent capacity or the 
cows to produce milk. 

It was shown that the yield per cow bad a direct influence on the cost 
of milk production. Selby, currier and Brandt (16) confirm this by stating 
that the yield par cow is the outstanding factor affecting the cost of 
producing milk. Other workers came to the same conclusion (16), (2), (5), 

(8). The production, however, is in turn dependent on and influenced by 
many other factors, such as feed, labor, inherent capacity of cows, season c£ 



* , 










freshening, etc. These factors will be more fully discussed in the following 
sections* 


FACTORS RELATED TO THE YIELD OF MILK 

Of the various factors, feed, labor, season of freshening, value and age 
of cows, that affect the yield of milk per cow, feed is usually regarded 
as having the greatest influence. Hence it will be considered first among 
the above factors that are related to or influence the yield per cow* 

Feed 

There are four nain classes of feed, according to S^lby, Surrier 
and Brandt (16), concentrates, succulents, hay and pasture. These four 
classes of feed will be individually related to production. Finally they 
will all be grouped together as T.D.M. (Total Digestible Hutrients) and the 
actual T.D.N. contained in these feeds, along with the theoretical T.D.N. 
will be related to production. Also some reference will be he de to the 
nutritive ratio of the rations. 

Concentrates 

From the standpoint of quantity and cost, grain was the main 
concentrate fed by the dairymen in the two areas studied - Tables 7 and 8. 
There was, however, a significant amount of protein rich supplements fed 
in the Calgary area and a small quantity in the Edmonton district, making 
up approximately 15$ of the concentrates in the former city and 10$ in 
the latter. The P.S. of Calgary fed only about one-half as much protein 
rich supplements as the P.D. of that area. A snail amount of oil-cake 


was fed in both areas.

Of the total amount of grain fed by the Edmonton P.S., 86$ was 
oats, while in the Calgary area only 59$ of the total ^ain was oats® This 
was due to the fact that large quantities of coarse grain were grown in 
the Edmonton district, while in the Calgary area there were less coarse 
grains grown nearby and also Brewer’s grain was available in large quantities 
in this area® Some dairymen in the Calgary area fed up to 75$ of Brewer’s 
grain in their concentrated mixture® There was little or no difference in 
the quantities of concentrates fed per 100 lbs® F.C.M. between the P.S. 
and P.D® of either area. There was a fairly close relationship between 
concentrates fed and yield per cow. For the Edmonton P.S*,as the production 
increased (Table 7) there were more total concentrates fed per cow* The 
amount fed for 100 lbs. F.C.M. was least for the first class, and much higher 
for the o^ttier two classes, but it will later be shown that this low concen¬ 
trate consumption of the first class was offset by a higher roughage con¬ 
sumption per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

For both the Calgary P.S* and P.D* groups (Table 8), the amount 
of concentrates fed per cow also increased as production increased. There 
appeared, however, to be little if any relation between the yield per cow 
and the number of pounds fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. for these two groups. The 
average amounts of concentrates fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. were between 35 to 
37 lbs. for all four groups. The results of other workers (10), (14), (1), 
found that from 32 to 39 pounds of grain were the average amounts fed per 
100 lbs. of milk produced in the areas studied* The above figures show 
that as the production increased there was a tendency for the dairyman to 
feed concentrates more liberally per cow, although there was little or no 
tendency for the amounts of concentrates fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. to in¬ 
crease as the production increased. Similar results were obtained in the 





- 25 


investigations carried out by Dow (14) and Morrison (9)* 

Hay 

There were several kinds of hay fed in both areas® It will be 
noted in Table 9 that oat sheaves was the most common and comprised 80% of 
the total hay fed by the Edmonton P.S. Tor Calgary P.S., as shown in T a ble 
10, it made up 66% of the total, but for the P.D. of that area, it constit¬ 
uted only about 40% of the total roughage. Prairie hay made up the bulk of 
the remaining roughage, being 53% of the total for the Calgary P.D. "Other 
hay” includes alfalfa, brome, timothy, etc., which constituted only a 
small proportion of the total hay fed. Tor both the P.S. groups there was 
a steady increase in the amount of hay fed as production increased. The 
Edmonton P.S. group had the greater variation, being from 4676 lbs. to 
7386 lbs. per cow, while the Calgary group was only frcm 5300 lbs. to 5730 
lbs. This shows the Edmonton P.S. fed hay more liberally to the higher 
producing cows than to the lower producing cows. The fact that the Calgary 
P.S. did not feed as liberally to their hi^i producing cows accounts for the 
wider variation in the hay consumed per 100 lbs. T.C.M. in this area* 

Tor the Edmonton P.S. group there was sufficient increase in hay consumed 
for the higher producing classes, which resulted in a more uniform hay 
consumption per 100 lbs. T.C.M. 

The P.D. of both areas, as shown in Tables 9 and 10, fed con¬ 
siderably more hay than did either of the P.S. groups. Tor the P.D. of 
Calgary the average was 123 lbs. per 100 lbs. T.C.M. as compared to an aver¬ 
age of 88 lbs. for Calgary P.S. The one Edmonton P.D. fed 196 lbs. per 
100 lbs. T.C.M. as compared to the average of 81 lbs. fed by the P.S. of 
that area. This wide difference for the Edmonton area should not be given 
too much consideration since it was based only on the estimate of one P.D«

Munger, (1) and Nehbhling (10), found 96 and 55 lbs. respectively as the 
average number of pounds of hay fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

The coefficient of correlation was calculated to show the relations 
between grain and hay to milk production. It was found to be *40 and .17 
respectively, which is indicative of a closer relation between ©?ain and 
yield than between hay and yield. These figures show that the dairyman 
tended to feed more grain but similar amounts of hay as the production 
increased. This is in accordance with the feeding standards which state 
that it is necessary to feed a higher proportion of grain to heavier pro¬ 
ducing cows. 

Succulents 

Silage and potatoes made up the bulk of the succulents fed in the 
Edmonton area. The remainder consisted mostly of turnips and other roots. 
Very little was consumed in the Calgary district. Approximately 40 fjo of the 
Edmonton P.S. fed succulents to their herds, while in the Calgary P.S, and 
P.D. groups, there were only about 20$> of the dairymen feeding succulents. 
This is probably due to the fact that Edmonton is a more intensive farming 
area, and more succulents such as potatoes, roots and silage crops are grown 
than in the less diversified Calgary area. 

Tables 11 and 12 show that as the production increased there was 
a steady decrease in the amount of succulents fed per cow per 100 lbs. 

F.C.M. In the literature reviewed, succulent foods were regarded as being 
desirable in a dairy ration, and were generally associated with intensive 
feeding practices, but there was little universal agreement whether any 
relation existed between succulents and yield per cow. In this study, there 
appears to be no reason why the lower producers fed more succulents to their

cows than did the higher producers. White and Johnson (47) came to the 
conclusion that succulents did not increase the yield per cow except where 
the cows were not receiving sufficient water* 

Minerals 

There were very little minerals, except salt, fed in either c£ 
the two areas* In the Edmonton P.S* group approximately 30of the dairymen 
fed a mineral mixture, while in the Calgary P.S. group there were only 20% 
of the dairymen feeding a mineral mixture* 

In Tables 11 and 12 it is shown that as the yield per cow increased 
in the P*S. groups, the amount of mineral mixture fed per cow increased. No 
minerals except salt were fed to the lowest production class of the Ed¬ 
monton P.S. This indicates that the higher producers followed better Ifed- 
ing practices than the lower producers. None of the P.D. of Edmonton at 
Calgary fed any mineral mixture except salt to their cows, which may pro¬ 
bably b© due to the fact that most ©f the P.D. kept their cows only for a 
short period of time, which would lessen their interest in the feeding of 
minerals. 

Common salt was universally fed to the cows of all groups. Both 
of the P.D. groups of Edmonton and CfeLgary fed considerably more salt than 
the P.S. groups. There appears to be no reason for this, as both groups 
were feeding well over the amount prescribed as necessary by Larson and 
Putney (44), which was 30 to 40 lbs. for a thousand pound cow producing 
6000 lbs* of milk an Dually. It is suspected that the dairymen must have 
included salt for other farm animals when giving the amounts consumed by 
the daily cows. The average of 68 lbs. of salt for the Edmonton P.S. gc*oup 
showed little variation. For the Calgary P.S. group the average was only 












- 28 


63 lbs# per cow, but there was a much wider variation, There speared to 
be no relation between the salt consumed and the yield per cow in any of 
the four groups. 

Pasture 

The type and yield of pasture varied greatly between the Edmonton 
and Calgary areas. Due to the climatic and soil conditions, the pasture 
in the Edmonton area was much more succulent and also contained more of the 
cultivated grasses than that of the Calgary area. In the Edmonton area, 
the grass was more luxuriant and less acreage was required to maintain a 
cow than in the Calgaiy area. The pasture around Calgary, due to climatic 
conditions, dries up usually during the latter part of July and August, which 
makes a shorter season in this area than in the Edmonton district. The 
average length of pasture season was 3.5 months for Calgary as compared 
with 4.6 months for Edmonton. This gave a longer dry feeding period for 
the Calgary producers, and consequently a greater feed cost per 100 lbs* 
F.C.M* 

Larson and Putney (44) claim that "Pasture alone, no matter how 
good, does not supply enough nutrients for the high producing cow". They 
maintain a cow producing over 20 lbs. of milk per day should have a grain 
supplement ♦ 

Although no figures can be given, observations indicate that th© 
producers in Edmonton and Calgary did not supplement pasture with grain 
except during the late Summer and Fall months. Generally, however, most of 
the cows did not yield on the average much over 20 lbs, a day. Consequently 
they would not require much grain to supplement their pasture* 

The above discussion merely points out the difference between the

pssture of the two areas, as it was not possible to show a definite re¬ 
lationship between pasture and yield. 

Total Feeds and T.D.N . 

While the individual classes of feed may vary considerably, it 
is logical to assunB that the total quantities of all classes of feed fed 
would have a closer relationship to yield than any one individual feed. 

In Tables 13 and 14 it Is shown that the total feeds fed annually per cow 
for all of the groups increased as the production increased; but the 
amount fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M* decreased as the production increased® l 1 he 
average total feed consumed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. for both of the P.D. groups 
was much higgler per cow and per 100 lbs. F.C.M. than either cf the P.S. 
groups. This indicates more liberal feeding by the P.D., which may be ac¬ 
counted far by the higher income obtained by this group. The second class 
of the P.D. had a much higher feed consumption iper 100 lbs. F.C.M. than 
either of the other classes. Examination of the individual producers of 
this class shows that one of them fed an abnormally large amount of hay, 
'which probably accounts for the higher feed consumption per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 
for th® class. 

fhe #iole discussion of feed, thus far, can be summed up by stat¬ 
ing that within each group the dairyman with higher producing cows fed more 
feed per cow but less per 100 lbs. F.C.M. Also that th®e obtaining the 
larger income fed proportionately more feed per cow and per 100 lbs. F.G.m® 
than did ihose receiving smaller incomes. 

While total feeds fed to the various groups of cows showed a 
relationship to the average yield of the cow, comparison on the T.D.N. 
basis should give more accurate results. There are however, a few limit-

ations to using the T.D.N. as the basis for comparison with the milk yield. 

When the T.D.N. is considered, it does not include the nutritive ratio of 
the feeds nor palatability nor bulkiness of the ration, all of which 
have an important bearing on the suitability of the dairy ration. Despite 
these disadvantages, the actual T.D.N. fed is of practical value to the 
producer when it is compared with the theoretical or required amount of T.D.N., 
indicating to the producer whether mere feed is being fed than is required. 

The theoretical T.D.N. was based on the Morrison feeding stand¬ 
ards (43). The amount of T.D.N. required for maintainance of the cow and 
for the milk produced were added together to give the total T.D.N. reqiired 
by the cow for the year. This T.D.N. required was divided by the number 
of 100 lbs. P.C.M. produced per cow to give the theoretical or required 
amount of T.D.N. which was required by that cow to produce 100 lbs. P.C.M., 
and this can be compared with the T.D.N* actually fed. Consequently if 
the theoretical T.D.N. required for 100 lbs. F.G.M. was lower than the actual 
amount fed it would indicate that the cows did not efficiently utilize the 
extra amount fed for the milk produced. This probably was due' either to 
their inherent inability to utilise all the extra T.D.N. fed, or the ration 
may not have been suitable in kinds of feed or amounts of digestible gp- 
teins. 

It can be noted in Tables 13 and 14 that there was a wide variation 
for all the groups between the actual amounts of T.D.N. fed and the theor¬ 
etical amounts of T.D.N. required for 100 lbs. F.C.M. The tables also show 
that for every increase in production there was a decrease in both the 
actual amounts of T.D.N. fed and the theoretical amounts of T.D.N. reqired 
per 100 lbs. I.C*M. One exception was the second class of the Calgaiy P.D. 









- 31 


which fed core per 100 lbs. F.C.M. than the preceding class. This was due 
to one of the dairymen of this class apparently feeding an abnormally large 
amount of hay to his cows. It is apparent then, that as the quantity of 
milk produced is increased, there is a lesser proportion of the total amount 
of T.D.N. used for maintainance of the cow and a greater proportion used 
for each 100 lbs. F.C.M. produced. Differences in the inherent ability of* 
a cow, however, will also affect the amount of T.D.N. required as the yield 
per cow increases. 

An important consideration to the producer is the difference 
between tbs actual amount of T.D.N. fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M* produced and the 
required amount for that same 100 lbs. F.C.M.» thus indicating whether more 
or less feed is being fed than is required, For the Edmonton P.S. group 
the difference between the actual and theoretical T.D.N. increased from 4 
to 17 lbs. as the production increased. Or as the prediction increased the 
producers had a tendency to feed more and more T.D.N. over and above the 
required amount for that yield of milk* Even though there was a greater 
spread between actual and required amounts of T.D.N. as production increased, 
nevertheless the dairymen with the higher producing cows fed less per 100 
lbs. F.C.M. than the dairymen with the lower producing cows, or in other 
words, the higher producing cows utilized the feed more efficiently than 
did the lower producing cows. 

For the P.D. groups the difference between actual and theoretical 
T.D.N. was much higher than for either of the P.$. groups due to the larger 
income of these P.D. groups. The Calgary P. s . group iiad the least dif¬ 
ference between actual and theoretical T.D.N. per 100 lbs. F.C.M. than 
either of the other groups, probably due to the smaller income per cow of 
this group ae compared to similar classes in the Edmonton P.S. or Calgary P.D. 
groups where larger incomes were being secured per cow from the sale of milk.

It has been shown that the P.D. overfed and consequently had a 
greater difference between actual and theoretical T.D.N. than the P.S. 
groups. It was also pointed out that the higher income of this group was 
the main cause for the more liberal feeding. There is however, another 
contributing factor. The P.D. had to produce a uniform supply of milk 
during the whole year in order to meet their daily demand for milk. This 
would entail more feed during the slack seasons and may cause a "forcing” 
of the cows at certain times of the year in order that the supply be kept 
up to the daily requirements. 

Par the Edmonton P.S. the largest group of the two areas, the 
simple correlation between the yield per cow and the T.D.N. fed per cow 
was .34, which indicates that as production increased there was a tend¬ 
ency to feed the cows more liberally. Ezekiel, McNall and Morrison (8) 
found the correlation between the milk production and T.D.N. fed to be 
.37 for one study and .22 for another. They considered these two figures 
to be significant of a relation between production and T.D.N. This gives 
added proof that there was a fairly close relationship between the T.D.N. 
fed and the yield per cow. 

From ¥/hat has been shown with regard to feed it may be concluded 
that as the production goes up, more T.D.N. was fed par cow but less T.D.N. 
was fed per 100 lbs. F.G.M. produced. As production increased, there was 
a greater spread between actual and theoretical T.D.N. fed per 100 lbs. 

F.C.M. produced and also where incomes were higher, as shown between the 
P.D. and P.S. groups, there was a still greater spread between actual and 
theoretical T.D.N. This spread leads to the conclusion that as product!on

or incomes per cow increased, there would be a greater tendency to augment 
the feed allowance to the cows beyond the point where thy produced the 
milk most efficiently* 

Nutritive R ft tio 

A thorough analysis of the nutritive ratio has not been attempted 
in this study* However* for the Edmonton P.S. group, the nutritive ratio 
was roughly calculated for each class and found to be 1:7*9, 1:7*6, and 
1:7.8 respectively from the lowest class to the highest, with the average 
at 1:7*8. This means for every pound of digestible protein fed, 7.8 pounds 
of carbohydrates and fat were also fed. The uniformity of the nutritive 
ratio for these classes indicates the dairymen with the hi^aer producing 
cows did not feed proportionately more protein in these two areas* Henry 
and Morrison (43) state that a 1200 pound cow producing 30 lbs. of 3*5 
per cent milk a day should receive a ration with a nutritive ratio not less 
than 1:6.1 to 1:7.2. Ezekiel, McNall and Morrison (8) concluded that as 
the nutritive ratio is narrowed down to 1:7, the production increased per 
unit of T.D.N. fed, but beyond that point, further narrowing of the nut- 
ritive ratio of the ration failed to show any response in th© milk pro¬ 
duction. Over one-half of the producers in that area (Wisconsin), how¬ 
ever, had a nutritive ratio over 1:8.5. 

Since the nutritive ratio found in the Edmonton area does not 
differ widely from a nutritive ratio of 1:7, t&ere would probably have 
been very little increase in milk production had the dairymen fed a larger 
proportion of protein.

Labor 

The actual and theoretical amounts of labor were calculated for 
the various production classes. In this study the actual number of hours 
of labor was obtained and from these the number of hours of labor used for 
100 lbs. F.C.M. were calculated - Tables 15 and 16. The theoretical or 
required amount of labor was based on the results of Yenstrom and Headley 
(15) . The method of calculation has already been outlined under "Method of 
Analystd*. Ho study was made of the efficiency of the labor used by the 
dairymen. 

The tables show that as the production of milk increased there 
was generally less actual and required labor per 100 lbs. F.C.M. Larson 
and Putney (44) and Morrison (9) found similar results. The theoretical 
amount of labor did not vary for corresponding classes a unless there was a 
variation in size of the herd, which accounts for the differences among the 
classes of the Calgary P.S. group. 

For the actual amount of labor per 100 lbs. P.C.M., class 2 of the 
Edmonton P.S. and class 2 of the Calgary P.D. are both higher than the follow¬ 
ing class. In both of these cases the size of the herd was smaller than the 
preceding class. These results indicate that size of herd also affects the 
amount of labor used per 100 lbs. F.C.M., less labor being used with the large 
herds than with the smaller herds. This confirms the results of Yenstrom and 
Headley (15), who, as has been previously shown, found that larger herds re¬ 
quired less labor per 100 lbs, F.C.M. than smaller herds. Stephens (17) and 
Pond and Ezekiel (11) both assert that management or efficiency of labor had 
an important influence on the amount of labor used for milk production. There 
appear, then, to be three recognized factors, yield pa? cow, size of herd, 
and efficiency of labor, that influenced the amount of labor retired to

produce 100 lbs* F.C.M. 

The P.D* of Calgary use more labor for 100 lbs. F.C.M., both 
actual and theoretical, than either of the P.S. groups. The smaller size of 
herd and higher income of this group were probably the main contributing factors 
for the higher labor requirement of this group* 

The above discussion shows that as either production, size of 
herd, or efficiency of labor was increased, there was a decrease in the 
number of hours of labor required for 100 lbs. F.C.M. In a later section 
the value of the labor used to produce 100 lbs. F.C.M. will be discussed 
from the standpoint of variability.

There was a marked tendency for the value of the cows to increase 
as the yield per cow increased. Class 3 of the Calgary P.S. including only 
five dairymen was the only exception to the above rule. However, the tables 
show that the dairymen did not increase the value of their cows in the same 
proportion that production increased, but tended to undervalue the higher 
producing cows. This would result in a lower cow charge per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 
for the higher producing cows than for the lower producing cows. Similar 
results were found in other studies (17), (16), (8). 

Season of Freshening and Age of Cow 

There was very little data collected pertaining to the season 
of freshening and age of the cows. In both areas there was a tendency for 
the P.S. to have the cows freshen in the late fall, generally in October. 

There was however, considerable variation among the individual producers, 
few following the practice of having their cows freshen in the spring. 

The P.D. had their cows freshen throughout the year, as they 
had to keep a uniform supply of milk the year round. According to the results 
of other investigators (8), (28), dairymen received more milk from their 
cows by following the practice of fall freshening than from cows that 
freshened at other times of the year. 

The average age of the cows in these two districtSwas between 
six and seven years. According to Go wen (30), (31), the age for maximum pro¬ 
duction of Holsteins and Jerseys was eight years. Since the raising of 
heifers is necessary for herd maintains nee, an average age of six to seven 
years, as found in this study, appears to be close to that found in any 
well-mamged herd.

Summary 

In the foregoing discussion, the various factors influencing 
and relating to the yield of milk per cow have been discussed. It was 
shown that feed exerted the greatest influence on the production of milk 
in this study, and as the yield per cow increased, more feed was fed per 
cow but less per 100 lbs, F,C*M, As the production increased there was a 
tendency to feed proportionately more concentrates than hay per cow, also 
the higher producing cows were fed more minerals per cow than the lower prod¬ 
ucing cows. Those producers with the larger incomes per cov/ tended to feed 
their cows more liberally. These results are similar to those of other in¬ 
vestigators (8), (11), Likewise, there was a tendency for more labor to be 
used as the production increased but less per 100 lbs, E.C,M. Increasing the 
efficiency of the labor or increasing the size of the herd also tended to 
lessen the amount used per 100 lbs, F*C,M, There was a fairly close relation 
between production per cow and value per cow. The other factors, season of 
freshening, age of cows, nutritive ratio, appeared to have little influence 
on production. However, for season of freshening and average age of cows, 
there was not sufficient data available to show any significant results in 
these two areas. 


CAUSES TOR VAKlAIIOLS i: Till YARiuUb GCST I ILLS 
Thus far in the study production has been related to the total 
cost of producing milk, and the factors influencing the yield per cow have 
been studied, based upon group and class averages. This section includes 
a study of the variability and the causes for the differences in the various 
cost items between individual dairymen.

Feed 

It has been shown in the previous sections that feed was the most im¬ 
portant item related to the production of milk and hence to the total cost of 
producing milk. In Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6 it was shown that feed constituted 
over 50$ ct the total cost of milk production. An examination of the cost 
of feed for the individual herds shows there was a wide variation betv;een 
the individual producers. For the Edmonton P.S. the range was from $ .SI 
to $1.30 per 100 lbs. F.C.M. Calgary P.S. present a smaller variation, being 
from $ .48 to |1.08 per 100 lbs. F.C.M. The Calgary p.p. group, however, 
had the widest range of all, $ .40 to $2.00 per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

Tables 18 and 19 were compiled in an attempt to find out the reason for 
these wide variations in the cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M, The records 
were sorted out in order of increasing cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. Other 
cost items relating to the same herds were also tabulated. 

In the previous sections it was also pointed out that as the production 
increased the cost of feed per cow increased, and there was a tendency, al¬ 
though it was not very marked, for the cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. to 
go down as the production increased (Tables 3, 4, 5 and 6). In Tables 13 
and 14 it was shown that as the production increased there was a marked ten¬ 
dency for less T.D.N. to be fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. It appears, then, that 
one of the causes for the variation in the feed cost is the yield per cow. 
However, when the herds were classed according to feed costs per 100 lbs. 
F.C.M. the figures for the Edmonton P.S, show that as the cost of feed per 100 
lbs. F.C.M. increased there was less than 4$ variation of the yield pa? cow 
from the average. Apparently the variation in the cost per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 
was not due to a variation in the yield per cow in this group, for the pro¬ 
ducers tended to vary the amount of feed fed to their cov/s regardless of the

production of the cows. For the Calgary P.S. and P.D. groups it is shown in 
Table 19 that as the cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M* increased for both 
groups, there was a marked tendency for the yield per cow to decrease. The 
dairymen with the higher producing cows apparently fed their cows more effic¬ 
iently ,or their cows utilized the feed more efficiently, than the dairymen 
with the lower producing herds. In all the groups, as the cost of feed per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. increased,the T.D.N. per 100 lbs. F.C.M. also increased, since 
both are based on the amount of feed retired per 100 lbs. I.G.M. 

The above discussion indicates that as the production per cow increased 
the cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. decreased in both Calgary groups, but 
in the Edmonton P.S. group the above relationship did not exist. It ap¬ 
pears that in the Calgary area production could probably be increased still 
further with the lowering of feed costs per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

For the Edmonton P.S. group the variation in feed cost per 100 lbs. 
F.G.M. must be attributed to some other cause than to the yield per cow. 

The tables show that the class with the lowest feed cost in the Edmonton P.S. 
group had a proportionately much lov/er concentrate cost to hay cost per 100 
lbs. F.C.M. than did the class with the highest feed costs. As the feed cost 
increased the amount of concentrates increased proportionately much faster 
than the amcuht of hay for 100 lbs. F.C.M. Ihe same is true, but to a lesser 
extent in the C a lgary P.S. graip. In the Calgary P.D, group the value of 
hay fed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. increased faster than the value of concentrates. 
However, in this group there was a relatively large amount of expensive hay 
fed by the lower producers. 

It appears then, that the tendency to feed a larger proportion of con¬ 
centrates than hay Y» ? as the main cause for the variation in the feed cost per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. for the Edmonton P.S. group, and to a slightly less extent for 



- 40 


the Calgary P#S. group# The tendency to feed both more concentrates and more ex¬ 
pensive hay in the Calgary P.D. group caused an increase in the feed cost per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. in this group# 

Willard (35) concluded that feeding an entirely roughafee ration 
gave lower feed costs per 100 lbs. milk and almost as high yields per cow as 
when grain was fed to supplement the hay. Hampson (34> gave tables of the 
ratio of grain and other feed prices to the selling price of milk, and ex¬ 
plains their use in the feeding of daily cows# It is likely, although 
there are no figures to substantiate the statement, that some variation of 
the feed cost within the differ ait ^oups was due to the dai rymen giving 
different valuations of similar feeds fed. 

The sis,© of the herd showed little or no relation to the cost of 
feed per 100 lbs# F.C.M. For Edmonton P.S. the largest herd had the highest 
feed cost, but, for the Calgary P.3., the larger herds had lower feed costs. 

In both instances, however, the herds averaging twenty-four cows had the high¬ 
est feed cost, and those herds below and above had lower feed costs# For the 
P.D. the smallest herd containing only 11 cots had the lowest feed cost of 
that group# In each group the variation in the size of the herd was quite 
snail, and when- this was considered along with the small number of producers 
in some of the classes, it was impossible to attach any significance to this 
factor as a means of explaining variation in the cost of feed# 

Selby, Birrrier and Brandt (16) found that the feed cost, along 
with the total cost per 100 lbs# milk, decreased as the size of the herd in¬ 
creased# An increase in the size of the herd from under ten to over fifty 
cows reduced the feed cost from $67.00 to §45.00 per cow. They attribute 
the lower costs to an increase in the ability of the producer with the larger 
herds to buy feed in greater quantities than the smaller producers. It is

doubtful if this would have any significance in these two areas, especially 
in E&nonton where most of the feed was home grown. In another study Nee th¬ 
ing (10) found that about twenty cows was the optimum size of herd for a farmer 
with 160 acres. 

It seems from the results of other authorities, that wide dif¬ 
ferences in hero size does have an effect on the feed cost, but the variations 
in the groups under study were too small to show any variation in the cost 
of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

The value per cow in relation to the feed cost Is also shown 
in the tables. It may be assumed that if dairymen regarded their cows as 
being of high value they would have a tendency to feed their cows more 
liberally than dairymen who valued their cows lower. There appears, how¬ 
ever, to be no direct relation between the value per cow and the cost cC 
feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M., although there was quite a close relation be¬ 
tween the value per cow and the yield per cow. Consequently, any relation 
between value per cow and cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M. would be through 
the yield per cow. 

There were not enough pure bred herds in the areas studied 
to show any significant results to feed costs. However a few will be 

pointed out. One pure bred herd found in the Edmonton P.S. group con¬ 
taining 28 pure bred Jerseys and 16 pure bred Holsteins, had an average 
production of only 6563 lbs. F.C.M. and a feed cost of $ .87 per 100 lbs. 
F.C.M.' Another registered herd in the same area had an average annual 
production of 9468 lbs. F.C.M. and a feed cost of $ .76 per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

In the Calgary P.S. group there were two producers with pure bred herds, 
one having an annual production of 5693 lbs. F.C.M. and feed costs of 
$1.02 per 100 lbs. F.C.M. The other had an average production of 5456 lbs.

F.C.M. and a feed cost of $ *54 per 100 lbs* F.C.M. These figures indicate 
that the pure bred herds found in these two areas did not have lower feed 
costs or higher productions than the average grade herds. In fact, the 
figures indicate that the former had higher costs than the average grade 
herds, while their production was not on the average any higher. 

Labor 

In the previous section it was pointed out that as the pro¬ 
duction, size of herd or efficiency of labor increased, less labor was 
required per 100 lbs. F.C.M. Also in -tables 5 and 6 it was shown that 
after feed, labor was the largest individual cost, comprising from 12$ to 
13$ of the total cost of producing 100 lbs. F.C.M. For the one Edmonton 
P.D. however, it was only 6*67$ of the total cost of producing 100 lbs* 
F.C.M. Feed and labor together constitute between 65$ to 70$ of the total 
cost, which corresponds very closely with the results of ether werkers 
(3), (4). The discussion of the variability of labor will be treated 
in a similar manner to the discussion on feed* 

In Tables 20 and 21 the cost of labor per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 
is related to the various other items. It was necessary to make the clas¬ 
ses slightly different in the three groups so the total number of farms 
would be more evenly distributed* While the average coat of labor for 
100 lbs. F.C.M. varied little for the two P.S. groups, the range of $ .06 
to | *54 for the Edmonton P.S. group was greater than the rangs of $ .06 
to $ .33 for the Calgary P.S. group. For the P.D. of Calgary the average 
was much higher - $ .30 for 100 lbs. F.C.M., and the range was from # .05 
to |> .48. There were two main reasons for the higher costs of this P.D. 
group; first, the average size of the herd was much smaller than for the 
P.S. groups, 13 as compared to 19 and 29 respectively for the P.S. ot Ed-

monton and Calgary. Second, the cost of labor per hour vans higher for 
the P.D. than for the P.S. The higher net income of this group probably 
explains the higher variation of labor, and also the tendency to use more 
labor for 100 lbs. F.C.M. That is, since they were realizing a profit, they 
would tend to use more labor as well as more feed for their cows. 

It is obvious that the cost of labor for 100 lbs. F. C .M. 
depends upon both the amount of labor used for 100 lbs. F.C.M. and the 
value of labor per hour. It has already been pointed out that the number 
of hours of labor required for 100 lbs. F.C.M. was dependent upon three 
factors, - the size of the herd, the production, ana the efficiency of the 
labor. Tables 20 and 21 show for the P.S. groups that the number of hours 
of labor for 100 lbs. F.C.M. decreased as the size of the herd increased. 

In the P.D. group the first class had a slightly smaller herd than the 
second class, but at the same time they had a much larger production, which 
probably explains the fewer hours used for 100 lbs. F.C.M. The third class, 
with an average herd of only six cows and a relatively small production, 
used the most labor for 100 lbs. F.C.M. of any class of the three groups. 
From the tables and discussion it appears that the larger herds used less 
labor and that the size of the herd was an important factor causing a var¬ 
iation in the amount of ld>or used for 100 lbs. F.C.M. Stephen’s (17) 
found that herds ranging from twenty-four to twenty-nine cows use less 
labor for 100 lbs. F.O.M. than any other sized herd. But, he adds, the size 
of farm, amount of equipment available and managerial ability of the producer 
have a direct affect on the amount of labor required to produce 100 lbs. of 
milk, Selby, Barrier and Brandt, (16) , gp further than Stephens by stating 
that the layout of buildings and arrangement of equipment within the build¬ 
ings also affects the amount of labor used for 100 lbs. F.C.M.

An analysis of the two Edmonton P.S. with the lowest cost 
compared with the two producers with the highest cost per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 
is 3hown in Table 22.

Fran these figures it appears that labor was more efficient 
where the herd was larger and where the barns and equipment were better. 

This is in agreement with the previously mentioned investigators (17), (16). 
The production, however, was higher in the latter class, although the dif¬ 
ference was not great. Both classes used about one-third of hired labor 
and two-thirds family labor, but the two producers of the latter class 
valued their own labor at a much larger figure than those of the former 
class. 

Referring again to Tables 20 and 21, it is evident that for the 
two P.S. groups the value of labor per hour had a marked tendency to in¬ 
crease as the total labor cost per 100 lbs. F.C.M. increased. However, 
there was only a slight variation in the Galgary P.D. group, with no ten¬ 
dency for the value of labor to increase as the labor cost of 100 lbs. 

F.C.M. increased. 

Selby, Burrier and Brandt, (16), found that the family labor 
was always valued lower than hired labor. This seemed to be the tendency

in these areas, but the main cause was due to the variation of the farmer*s 
estimate of the value of his own and his family*s labor. 

If the dairymen gave a high valuation to their cows it would 
be expected that they would give more care and attention to their cows 
than those dairymen who valued their cows considerably lower. However, the 
value per cow appears to have little if any relationship to the cost of 
labor. In the Calgary P.D. group the value per cow does increase as the 
cost of labor par 100 lbs. F.C.M. increases, but for the P.S. of that area, 
the value per cow was just the reverse, decreasing as the cost increased. 

The relationship of the value per cow to production has been previously 
shown, and it is likely that any relationship of cost of labor to value per 
cow would be through production. 

In summarizing the causes of variation in the cost of labor 
per 100 lbs. F.C.M. it was apparent that value of labor per hour and number 
of hours required for 100 lbs. F.C.M. directly caused most of the variation, 
and these items were in turn affected by various other factors. The number 
of hours required for 100 lbs. F.C.M. was dependent on production per cow, 
size of herd, and efficiency of labor. Value per hour varied with the 
farmer* s estimation of his own and his family’s labor and the cost of hired 
labor. A variation in any of these factors affected the total labor cost 
of 100 lbs. F.C.M. indirectly, by causing a variation in the number of hours 
of labor required for 100 lbs. F.C.M., or in the value per hour, which in 
turn causes a variation in the cost of labor per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

Cost of Buildings 

Building charge was the third largest single item of expense 
in tls cost of milk production. In Tables 5 and 6 it was shown to constitute

from 4.57$ to 9.66$ of the total cost of producing 100 lbs. F.C.M. for the 
Calgary P.D. and the Edmonton P.S. respectively. Somewhat similar results 
were obtained by Munger (1). 

Tables 23 and 24 were compiled to show cause of variation in 
the building costs as found in these two areas. For Edmonton P.S. the var¬ 
iation was from $ .01 to $ .37 per 100 lbs. F.C.M. produced, while it was 
much less for the Calgary P.S. group, being from $ .03 to $ .15. For Calgary 
P.D. it was from $ .05 to $ .22. It is generally admitted that value of 
buildings is the dominant factor causing a variation in the building charge 
for 100 lbs. F.C.M., and it follows, as shown by the tables, that as the 
building cost increased for 100 lbs. F.C.M., the average value of the 
buildings increased and the average value of the buildings per cow also in¬ 
creased. This indicates that the higher building investment and hence higher 
building charge was not offset by the increase of production accruing from 
the better buildings, for the cost of buildings for 100 lbs. P.C.M. in¬ 
creased as the value of the buildings increased. That is, the distribution 
of the high and low cost buildings was equally distributed between the high 
and low producing herds, which is best shown by the P.S. groups. 

For all the groups, neither the valuation per cow nor the pro¬ 
duction per cow showed any marked tendency to increase as the value of the 
buildings or the building cost per 100 lbs. F.G.M. increased, or in other 
words, the producers who valued their cows higher did not provide mere 
valuable buildings than did the producers who valued their cows lower. 

Severence and Johnston (3) found the same result and stated 
that: ”It was very seldom that cows in more expensive buildings produced 
a larger quantity or a better quality of milk in proportion to the extra

The average value of buildings per cow was much greater for the 
Edmonton P.S. than for either of the Calgary groups. This explains the 
higher cost of buildings for 100 lbs. F.C.M. for the Edmonton P.S. as 
compared «ith the Calgary groups. The higher yield per cow of Ediomton p.S. 
was not sufficient to offset the high value of buildings per cow by that 
group. 

The tables show that for Edmonton and Calgary P.S. as the building 
cost increased the size of the herd increased rather than decreased, or in 
other words, the producers with the larger herds provided relatively more 
expensive buildings per cow. For the Calgary P.D. as the building cost in¬ 
creased the size of the herd decreased and the higher building costs per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. of this group were due to the larger investments in build¬ 
ings per cow where the herds were smallest. The reason for the P.S. to 
provide relatively better buildings as the size of the herd increased was 
probably owing to the fact that those producers with the larger sized herds 
intended to remain in the dairy business longer than those producers with 
the smaller sized herds, and therefore would provide buildings of a more 
permanent and expensive nature. Most of the P.D. having the larger herds 
were near the city, owned very little land, and tended to invest smaller 
amounts in buildings than the P.D. with the smaller herds. I'he Calgary 
P.D. had much smeller farms than either of the P.S. groups, which probably 
indicates that they were of a less stabilized nature in their business as 
compared to the P.S. 

There appeared to be no rel at ion between building charge per 100 
lbs. F.C.M. and the cost of labor, for as the value of buildings increased, 
there was no perceptible reduction in the cost of labor per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

From the foregoing discussion it is obvious that the value of buildings

per cow is the main cause of variation in the building charge per 100 lbs. 
F.C.M. The size of the herd appeared to have some si giificance, but 
neither the value per cow nor the production per cow bore any marked relation 
to building charges. There was no tendency, within the various groups, for 
the dairymen on large farms to provide more expensive buildings for their 
cows than the producers on smaller farms. 

Annual Cow Charge 

According to Tables 5 and 6 of the total cost of producing 100 lbs. 
F.C.M. the cow charge varied from 3.19$ to 7.49$ for the Calgary P.D. and 
Edmonton P.S. groups respectively. Munger (1) found it to be 4.8 °h of the 
total cost of producing 100 lbs. of milk. 

The annual cow charge depends upon the value of the cow, the rate of 
depreciation and interest, and the quantity of milk produced. The same rates 
of depreciation and interest were charged wfor all of the herds, 
hence these can be disregarded in the discussion of the factors causing a 
variation in the annual cow charge per 100 lbs. F.C.M.

In Tables 25 and 26 the value per cow and the cow charge per 100 
lbs. F.C.M. are given for all the different production classes of the dif¬ 
ferent groups. There was a very close relationship between value per cow 
and the annual cow cost per cow. The tables show a general trend for the 
annual cow charge per cow to go up as the production increases, but at the 
same time there was a general trend for the cow costs per 100 lbs. F.C # i^ # 
to go down as production increased. The increase in the annual cow charge 
for the more valuable cows was more than offset by the increase in production 
of these cows, which resulted in a lower cow charge per 100 lbs. F.C.M. 

Hence in this study the two main factors influencing the cow charge per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. were the estimated value of the cov/s and their production. 
























- 50 - 


Miscellaneous Cost 

Other items beside ffeed, labor, building and annual cow charge, which 
go to make up the total cost of producing milk are all grouped under Miscel¬ 
laneous Cost, It included such items as bull charge or breeding fees, 
equipment charge, cost of hauling milk, veterinary cost, feed grinding, and 
other incidental expenses. 

The miscellaneous cost was a comparatively large item, making up 
from 15.96$to 22.94$ of the total cost as shown in Tables 5 and 6. The cost 
of hauling milk was the largest single item, being about 75$ of the total 
miscellaneous cost. For the P.D. grratp it was even higher, and explains 
the larger miscellaneous cost of this group. Variations of the hauling 
charge depend primarily on the distance of the farm from the market. There 
was some variation in the equipment charge, but it was too small to be of 
any significance. Bull charge was also comparatively small, and varied with 
the size of the herd. Some dairymen owning small herds, who paid for the 
use of their neighbors’ bulls had a much lower bull charge than dairymen 
with a similar size of herd who owned a herd bull. Other incidental expenses 
such as feed grinding, veterinary fees, milk license, etc., were quite small 
and variations were probably due more to differences in management than any 
other factor. 

The total miscellaneous costs tended to increase per cow as production 
increased, as shown in Tables 5 and 4, and also tended to increase per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. as production increased - Tables 5 and 6. The two producers 
with the highest miscellaneous cost had a comparatively higher hauling charge 
and a lower yield per cow than the producer with the lowest miscellaneous 
cost who had a lower hauling charge and a much higher yield per cow than 
the other two producers. Hence the hauling charge and production per cow 


seemed to be the prominent factors affeetiigthe variations in miscellaneous

cost* 

Summary 

Feed and labor make up from turo-thirds to three-fourths of the total 
cost of producing milk, consequently the producer shoul. gire more consider¬ 
ation to the control and understanding of these tv/o factors than any of 
the others. Any substantial lowering of the total cost will be throu^i 
a reduction of the cost of either or both of these factors, and as was shown 
in the previous section, the amounts of feed and labor used per 100 lbs* 
F*C*M* can be reduced by increasing the yield per cow. Consequently the 
milk production has an affect on the cost of these two items. Building 
and cow cost are relatively snail, and are often regarded as indirect costs 
of production. If a farmer already has his buildings and his cows, these 
charges are existant before he produces the milk, and they are less under 
his direct control than feed or labor. Miscellaneous cost is also uaially 
regarded as an indirect cost, and is made up of innumerable small items which 
by themselves are of little consequence, but in the aggregate amount to a 
noteworthy sum. Perhaps all the costs can be summarized by stating that 
on the more permanently established dairy farms any lowering of the cost of 
milk production will probably come through a reduction in the feed or labor 
cost, but when the producer is able to adjust and change the other factors 
of production, a decrease in the total cost may come from an alteration in 
any of the main items of cost, 

A GENERAL SUMMARY OF THE FACTORS INFLUENCING PRODUCTION AND THE COST OF 

PRODUCING MILK

of the various factors to the production of milk and to the cost of producing

milk* Production was found to have the greatest influence on cost, but it 
in turn depends upon many other factors whose effects on the cost were in¬ 
directly through their effect on the production. Chief of these were feed, 
labor, and the inherent capacity of cows to produce milk. The influence 
of feed was found to depend upon the kind and amount of feed fed. It was 
also shown that less labor was used to produce 100 lbs. F.C.M. as the pro¬ 
duction increased, but there appeared to be other factors such as the size 
of herd and the efficiency of labor, which also influenced the amount of 
labor used. It was indicated that increasing the inherent capacity of the 
cows to produce milk increased the production and lowered the feed costs 
per 100 lbs. F.C.M# 

Later the individual cost items, feed, labor, building, cow, and mis¬ 
cellaneous costs were treated separately in an attempt to determine the 
causes for the variations in the costs of each, and to show their relation 
to the total cost of producing milk. Feed and labor were found to comprise 
approximately three-fourths of the total cost, feed alone being over 50$ 
of the total. Building and cow charge were relatively small and made up 
only approximately 1C$ of the cost. The rest of the costs were included 
under miscellaneous charge. 

phe cost of producing milk was based primarily on the 100 lbs. 
F.C.M. basis. The production of milk per cow, which is the expression of 
their inherent ability to produce milk, had a significant influence on the 
cost per 100 lbs. F.C.M., and was one of the main causes for the variations 
in the feed costs per 100 lbs. F.C.M. However tbs proportion of high-priced 
concentrates fed to the lower-priced roughages also had a direct bearing on 
the cost of feed per 100 lbs. F.C.M# Under labor costs the yield per cow 



- 53 - 


did not cause any apparent variation, although indirectly it affected the 
hours of labor required to produce 100 lbs, F.C.M. Other factors influenc¬ 
ing the labor cost were valuation of labor per hour and size of herd. The 
difference in the investment of buildings caused most of the variability in 
the building charge. Value per oow and production were responsible for the 
difference in the cow charge per 100 lbs. F.C.M. Miscellaneous cost was 
influenced mostly by the hauling charge, which comprised about 75 % of the 
total, and varied mainly with the distance from the farm to the dairy. 

INCOME FROM THE SALE OF MILK 

Before giving the final conclusion, a statement will be made regarding 
the selling price of milk and its relationship to the net income received 
from milk in these two areas during the summer of 1953 to the summer of 
1934. Tables 27 and 28 give the income per cow and income per 100 lbs. 

F.C.M., and also the net income^per cow and per 100 lbs. F.C.M. for the dif¬ 
ferent groups and production classes. 

For all the groups the gross income per cow increased as the pro¬ 
duction increased, i.e., the greater the production, the more milk there was 
to be sold. The largest income per cow was in the highest production clas¬ 
ses of all three groups. For both P.S. groups the last classes were the only 
ones Those incomes were greater than the costs. All of the other classes 
gave a net loss. The P.D., due to the higgler price received from the sale 
of milk, had a greater net incorre than either of the P.S. groups. 

The variation in the amount of surplus milk explains most of the 

^ The net incortB per cow and per 100 lbs. F.C.M. was calculated by subtract¬ 
ing the income per oow and per 100 lbs. F.C.M. from the total annual cost 
per cow and per 100 lbs. F.C.M.

difference in the net selling price between the different production clas¬ 
ses. The selling price increases as production increases for the Edmonton 
P.S. groups. The other groups do not show this feature in quite the re¬ 
gular manner as the Edmonton P.S # group. Nevertheless there is a tendency 
towards it, and in both Calgary and Edmonton P.S. the largest production 
class received more per 100 lbs. F.C.M. than any of the other classes. Two 
causes are suggested for this difference in the selling price; first, the 
better managerial ability of the producers of this class in keeping down 
their total production close to their quota as set by the dairies, and 
second, the price given in the tables is the average yearly price, and it 
is likely that those receiving a higher price produced more milk when prices 
were higher, thus receiving an average higher yearly price. The city sweet 
price of the P.S. was the same for all P.S. at the same time, but the quota 
of their total amount of milk being sold at this price varied considerably. 
The P.D. sold milk directly to the consumer and received the retail price, 
which was substantially higher than the city sweet price. 

Since the net income varies fran a minus to a plus, the larger produc¬ 
ing herds would lose more per cow but less per ICO lbs. F.G.M. than the 
lower producing herd. However, if the income had been positive for all the 
herds, the larger producing herds could have received less net income per 
100 lbs. F.C.M. but more per cow than the lower pioducing herd. 

Those herds with the largest production gave the largest net income. 
This indicates that if the production was still further increased there 
would be a greater net return per 100 lbs. F.C.M. The production could be 
increased either by obtaining better cows with more inherent capacity to 
produce milk or by altering some of the methods of production used with the 
present cows. It is likely the first method would yield a larger return 



- 55 - 


than the second* 

Coming back to the question stated at the beginning of this thesis, 
whether or not the producer had reached the point where it was not profitable 
to increase the production by applying more of the production factors, it 
appears from the above figures that this point has not been reached, and the 
production could be increased further with a greater net income per odw, i.e. r 
assuming present prices remain the same. Also it should be pointed out that 
the above conclusion is in general terms and would vary for the individual 
producers and the individual cows. 

CONCLUSIONS 

This study was made to show the influence of the various factors on 
the production per cow, and the causes for the variations in the cost cf pro¬ 
ducing 100 lbs, IF.G.M. Such a study would also suggest the combination of 
factors that v/ould lead to the greatest net return from the dairy enterprise. 

Analysis of the records show the cost of producing 100 ih s. F.C.M. 
was approximately $1.24 for both the Edmonton and Calgary P.S. groups. For the 
P.D. it was higher, being §1.543 for the one Edmonton P.D. and §1.876 for the 
Calgary P.D. group. The cost of feed varied from § .653 to §1.107, and labor 
| .107 to § .232 between the P.S. and P.D. groups of the two areas, Edmonton 
and Calgary. Since the prices of feed and labor fluctuated considerably between 
different areas and during different years, these figures varied somewhat from 
those of other studies. Nevertheless, from a standpoint of quantity, the re¬ 
sult s-correspond very closely with the results of other investigators. 

It has been also shown there was considerable variation in the 
different cost items within the different groups. These fluctuations can be 
attributed primarily to variations in the following four factors: inherent 
capacity of the cows, feed, labor, and management. From the data it is

evident that those producers having high production costs per 100 lbs. 

F.C.M. either did not feed the proper rations to their cows, use the labor 
efficiently, have cows of proper inherent ability, or manage their herds 
efficiently. Therefore it can be concluded that the cost of production 
in many herds in these twD areas can be decreased by the proper adjustment 
of any of the four factors shown. This may be accomplished by:- 

1. Increasing the inherent capacity of the cows to produce milk. T his 
can be accomplished by obtaining more efficient cows or by using better 
herd bulls and raising better heifers. Either method will result in lower 
costs of milk production. Higher production through the use of more ef¬ 
ficient cows not only gives lower milk production costs, but it also gives 
an increase in the volume of milk for sale. Thus, even though there was no 
reduction in the cost of producing milk, the higher producing cows would 
give larger profits by increasing the quantity of milk that could be sold. 

2. Adjusting the rations of the cows so that the largest amount of milk 
is produced at the lowest cost per 100 lbs. F.C.M. This can be done by 
feeding a larger amount of roughages and the cheaper feeds in proportion to 
the higher-priced concentrates, and also by keeping the amount of T.D.n. 
fed down to the amount required by the cows. According to feeding stand¬ 
ards, higher yields are obtained where the nutritive ratio is low (1:7). 

The analysis however, indicates that in these areas with existing feed 
prices heavy concentrate feeding would net result in a financial saving 

to the producer; since the cost of concentrates are relatively high in 
comparison to other feed costs. 

3* More efficient use of labor. The amount of laboi used per 100 lbs. E.C.M. 
can be reduced by increasing the size of the herd, increasing the production

of milk or increasing the efficiency of the labor. The extent to which 
the herd can be increased said still give lower labor requirements depends 
upon the size of the farm and the equipment available. Production can be 
increased almost indefinitely, resulting in a lowering of the amount of 
labor required. Using better labor and more equipment will increase the 
efficiency of the labor. However, each farm presents a different problem 
in the use of labor, and it is impossible to give recommendations tia t would 
apply to each farm* 

4. More efficient management. Good management includes the proper com¬ 
bination and coordination of all of the factors of milk production. The 
analysis has shown that the dairy business is made up of many complex 
inter-related factors, and the intecsity of association of any one of these 
factors to the cost of producing milk is altered by the influence of other 
factors. Ordinarily, a high yield per cow is associated with a larger 
income per cow than a low yield* This however may not always be true, and 
depends upon the relation of many other factors such as the relation of the 
prices of the production items to the selling price of milk. The producers 
are not interested in the physical output per cow except where it directly 
increases their income. Hence the dairymen receiving the highest inccmes 
are not necessarily those receiving the highest profits per cow. ^'he most 
successful dairymen are those producers who have the managerial ability to 
combine all the factors of production in such a way that they will receive 
the largest net income from their cows.
