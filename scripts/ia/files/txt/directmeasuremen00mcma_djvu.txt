beam testa, assumes that'the maximum adhesive strength 
of concrete on bar® is roughly proportional to the com¬ 
pressive strength of the concrete. This result is more 
relative than absolute since it depends on simplified 
assumptions regarding the distribution of the bond stresses, 
for instance, in pt11-out tests the bond is assumed to 
be uniforiaaly distributed on the bar surface over the 
full length of embedment. Also in both pull-out toots 
and bear tests an arbitrary value of total slip of the 
,out aO 001 inch usually ) is taken to 1 n dicate the 
over-coming of adhesive resistance. Thus allowable bond 
stress values based on the above premise are only roughly 

correct, furthermore it has lately been shorn (see 

. 

History}, that for higher strength concretes ..ond resistance 
does not increase in proportion to concrete strength, so 
tnat a new criterion for bond strength is necessary. 

i a ) Bond design .Practice 

Two types, of bond stress computation are necessary in 
designing for bond* These involve checking 
va) Anchorage bond, and 
(b) Bond due to shearing forces. 

Anchorage bond stress results fro . embedding the bar in 
concrete for some distance beyond a point where the bar 
is needed, so that the bar may maintain a certain stress at 
that point. Assuming a uniformly distributed anchorage bond 
stress, the length of embedment required to develop a

{ a } Purpose . 

As pull-out tests of bars are commonly used in 
checkin the bond strengths developed in reinforced con¬ 
crete, it was decided to a ply the technique of 8K-4 strain 
gage measurement to several pull-out specimens. The 
following objectives were to be investigated; 

(l) The distribution of bond stress along the 
embedded length of tW b; r, 

(2j The effect produced by the kind of concrete 

stress surrounding the bar on the distribution 
of bond stresses, i,e, compression concrete as 
compared to tension concrete, 
loj The effect of varying the i- ratio of the bar 
on the distribution of bond stress. 


(bj AetnocU 

Three pull-out tests using electric strain gages were 
carried out in order to sake a reconnaissance survey of the 
above objectives. All three tests were on a 5/8” 
intermediate grad© ter embedded in a 6 ,f diameter concrete 
cylinder. The design strength of the concrete was 2500 p.s.i. 
throughout. Two of the tests were with the concrete in 
compression while one was with the concrete in tension. The 
details of the three tests may be seen in figure 1, -p CL< 3 e *3.

is required. .«ith gages placed at various points along the 
rod, the total stress at successive sections can.be measured. 
Differences in stresses between any two sections are due to 
the bond developed between those two sections. Then the 
difference in stress divided by the available bond area, 
between the sections gives the average intensity of bond 
stress between the two sections, if plotting a sufficient 
number of these average intensities of bond stresses against 
their locations along the bar, a curve showing the distrib¬ 
ution of bond stress will be obtained. 

It will be noticed that with the gages located along 
the bar as shown in Jfig, 2 . , the bonded area consists of a 
series of short segments separated by short lengths of bar 
over' /hi oh no bond can be developed. An import*nt question 
is whether the bond developed by a series of separated 
segments of h r will be the same as for a continuous embed¬ 
ment of equal length or not; and also, what effect will 
the size of the waterproofing housing have on the distrib¬ 
ution of bond stress, since stress concentrations in the 
concrete are likely. 

brom the result of Tests 2 (a) and 2 (bj it would 
appear that the presence of the gages did not •. aversely 
affect the total adhesive resistance of the concrete, 
in these tests the toted pull at first slip was about 5oOO 
pounds for the bar with gages, and about 4500 pounds for an 
equal continuous length of bar embedded without gages, 
however, in test 2 {a) the presence of gages evidently

produced a concentration of bond stress near the unloaded 
end of the bar at high loads. This was probably due to 
wedging action of the rubber housings. There is also 
some evidence of this at high loads in tests 1 and b. 

(c) Tests 

The tests were carried out after the concrete had 
cured for 28 days under water, except in the case of tests 
2 (a, and 2 (b j where the cylinders were cured for 20 days 
only. Auxiliary strength test cylinders were tested on the 
same d; y. 

..efore the actual test the strain gages "were all 

checkta in the usual manner. Thereafter loads were applied 

- 

to the bars very slowly in about 500 pound inert; <cnts. The 
L a,ges were read immediately aft r each test load, was reached 
this load being held constant during the reading period. 

In tests 1 and 2 an Ames dial at the unloaded end of the 
bar was read to indicate end-slip. 

The original data sheets taken for the three pull-out 
tests may be found in Appendix £ of this report, 

(d) .Results . 

Two types of graph were plotted .from the computed data 
for each of the three tests. The first type for each t est 
shows the variation of unit stx’ese in the bar along the 
embedded length of the b? r f plotted for various applied 
loads. (See graph® that follow). In plotting these graphs 






the portions of the bar covered icy the rubber housing were 
assumed to be of zero length. The se ond type of graph 
shows the distribution of anchorage bond stress along the 
embedded length. Here ag. r in the gage locations were 
considered as points, and the average bond intensity over 
each segment of the bar was plotted as the value at the mid¬ 
point of the segment. 

It may be noted here that the value of the Modulus 

6 

of Elasticity Tor steel m s taken as oG x 10 p.s.i* in 

all computations. An actual test on a 5/S bar using four 

£* 

SK-4 strain gages gave value for E of oO.O x 10 p*s.i„ 


(e) Interprets tion , 

before discussing the results of the pull-out tests 
it must be kept in mind that, with but three tests performed 
one can gain only an indication of what happens inside the 
concrete. 

The various graphs and table I on the pull-out tests 
give some new information on the folio ing features of bonds 

(1} distribution of anchorage bond s tress . 

J'or low loads, where the values obtained are the 
most reliable, the intensity of bond stress is 
very high at the loaded end of the bar, and then 
falls off rapidly to a negligible value at some 
distance from the unloaded end. This holds true 
in general for the concrete in either compression 





or tension 


18 . 


in no case is there a uniform distribution of bond 
stress along the hr, i lino a h in S I. i 
the distribution b; comes nearly uniform at a 
high slippage load. 

(2} Effect of the stres a i n th e concr e te on the 

bond tii Stri cut ion 

Uisregarding Test Mo 2, where the influence of 
the rubber housings is suspected, it may be seen 
thet a much higher intensity of bond is developed 
for : ny given load when the concrete is in tension 
as coEiyared to -hen it is in compression, The 
dis tri bufcion of bond strews does not, however, ‘^even- 
out" nearly as much at high loads with the concrete 
in tension as it does with the concrete in compression. 

The ultimate load on. the bar in Tests 1 and 0, 
with a comparable length of embedment, was nearly the 
same, being about id,000 pounds for the concrete in 
compression, and 12,750 pounds for the concrete 
in tension. At these loads the bar was being 
pulled slowly through the concrete, and the effect 
of the rubber housings would be great. 

I 0 ) Effect of v arying the A? ratio . 

Unfortunately little can be concluded from 
, since Test Mo. 2 is of doubtful 


















19 . 


value* However, one can see that at very low loads 
there is good agreement in the shape of the bond 
distribution cux^ves for each test, as well as 
in the actual values of bond developed* Thus 
for the 1500 pound load, the intensity of bond 
at the loaded end as 100 p.s*i* for Test Bo 1 
and 204 p.s#i* for Test Bo 2* 















(f J discussion 


The development of a higher intensity of bond stress 
vjith the concrete in tension than with the concrete in 
compression is interesting* An explanation possibly lies 
in the lateral deformations of the concrete due to I'oission 4 
effect. vVith the concrete in tension the concrete would 
contract laterally, and thus close" on the steel, whereas 
ith the concrete in compression it would tend to move 
away from the rod. Since the rod itself is in tension in 
both cases, the effect of its lateral contraction would 
be the same throughout* it may be pointed out, however, 
that with the cylinder reinforced with A - bars as in ' 
lest $o. a, the tension stress in the concrete would be 

r 

rather small. 

* 

An article in the February, 1949 Journal of the 
American Concrete institute gives a graph showing the steel 
stress distribution in a concrete pull-out specimen using 
OB-4 gages. The steel stress-distribution cui^ves found in 
Test No 1 as described previously agree very well in general 
shape .vita the curves given in the above article. In this 
case, the curves shown .were for a n plain bat in an 
B" x 16 H cylinder.

as part of this work on the study of bond, a two-span 
continuous reinforced concrete beam wi s designed and tested 

(a; P ur pose 

The objectives to be studied in the beam test were 
as follows} 

(lj To measure the intensity of direct stress in 
both tensile and compressive reinforcement at 
various points along the bs rs. 

\k,} To obtain the bond stresses due to shearing 

forces from the? above stress measurements, and 
to ■ fchl lin Ur theoretical. 

(bj To study the anchorage of reinforcing bars in 
tension and in compression concrete. 

(4) To study the value of hooks in anchoring rein¬ 
forcing bars.

( Id ) jjesia-n erf the beam 

The actual su port conditions of the beam as it was 
to 'be tested were kept in mind in designing the reinforcing. 

The beam was to be made up of two five-foot spans with a 
single concentrated load at the mid-point of each span, 
it would be supported at its ends on hinged supports 
resting on a double I2 n at 40*8 lb. l-heam placed across 
the table of the testing machine. The reaction at its mid¬ 
point would be supplied by a 200,000 lb. capacity proving 
ring. This meant that the beam would be, supported by a 
relatively rigid centre support, and two equally-ainktog 
end-supports, A calculation was made to find out the 
increase in negative moment over the centre support caused 
by this condition. 

The computation, for the effect of the sinking end supports 
was carried, out on the basis''that the proving ring provided 
a completely rigid support, By equating the equations for 
the downward deflection of the concrete beam (with assumed 
reinforcing) and of the double I-beam, the value of the 
unknown end reaction was found. This value turned out 
very close to 7/8 of the end reaction for a non-sinking end 
support,' The diagram on the next page gives the theoretical

The beam was d*. signed according to the C*.; . *,># A* Code 
on xteinforced Concrete, for the chief reason than an idea 
might be gained as to the value of some of the code require¬ 
ments. A brief summary of the design follows; 

The design load f1 P w on the Q n x 15" beam was figured 
on the basis of a maximum shearing stress of 150 p. s.i. in the 
beam 2500 1&. concrete. This load came to 15,000 pounds, and 
gave a maHimum negative moment over the centre support of 17,600 
foot-pounds, and a positive moment of 10,500 foot-pounds at the 
quarter-point. The steel required for this positive moment

required between load points, and were in the form of rectang¬ 
ular closed hoops, A check on the theoretical bond stresses 
gave the following values;

allowable of 208 p,s.i. for 2500 lb. concrete. The length 
of anchorage of bars beyond the section of zero bending .ori¬ 
ent was computed to be as follows, according to the Codes 
A total of 7*5 inches for the top tensile barej 8*7 inches 
fox' the bottom tensile fears, and nil for the compression 
bars over the centre s ipport* As strain gages would use 
up some anchorage area, it was decided to run all fears 10

fifty gages were used in all. As may be seen from 
the drawing, this did not axlow a very close spacing of 
gages- on the bars if the stresses were to be measured 
throughout the beam, it was thought necessary to place 
the gages symmetrical to the centre-line of the beam, so 
that a check on each rccuing could be obtained. in order 
to eliminate unknown bending effects in the bars the gages 
were placed on the side of the bar at mid-height. The strains 
measured would then toe near the aver ge in the bar.

was thus 8‘* x la.8“ x 10• -6”. All, electrical lead-out

After 28 days of curing under moist sand the beam was 
made ready for testing. oix gages had spoiled due to 
moisture leakage into the- gage> leaving 41 out of 50 
available for readings. These gages were connected to the 
8K-4 otrain Indicator via a switch-box, all electrical 
connections feeing soldered,and wrapped with tape. A w dummy? 
gage, for tempera t re change compensation, was attached to 
the beam during the test.

slipped under it. On releasing the jack-pressure it was 
found that the proving ring carried slightly over half the 
dead weight of the beam. 

huring the test the beam was loaded in increments of 
about 2000 lias, applied at the quarter-points i.e. twice 
this load or 4000 lb increments on the testing machine, 
vne cyclic loading was carried out* from 0 to 8000 to 0 
rounds'for 'P H and then the loading w s incre sed contin¬ 
ually until failure. At least 10 minutes were allowed to 
elapse after each loading before readings of steel strain 
were taken. it was noticed bj checking some gages twice 
for a given load that the steel strain increased slightly 
during the 5 to 15 minuter required to read all the gages; 
some of these double readings were recorded but the first 
ones taken were used in the computations• 

in addition to the gages, readings were taken on the 
proving ring, and of the temperature at each load, finally, 
the deflection of the beam at the end supports, and at the 
load points, was measured at each load using a precise tilting 
level reading to a hundredt ■ of an inch. 

During the last day of the test three aaxilliary 
strength test cylinders were broken and an ordinary ,.»uil- 
out 6 -lain 5/8 r bar embedded in a standard 8 x 12 

cylinder was performed.

The original data for the beam test and auxiliary tests 
may be found in Appendix Jb of this report* 

before studying die plot of the result.;, an idea, 
of the value of the gage readings themselves may be gained

After converting strain to stress by multiplying by 
oO x 10 ^P*s.i. 5 the strain gage data was plotted to give 
two types of graph, idee graphs that follow ) 

The first type, the Load-Stress diagram, shows the 
comparison between actual and theoretical steel stresses 
for '..11 loads at any one. section of the. beam. 

The second type, the ^tress-Aistributton diagram, 
shoes the comparison between actual and theoretical steel 
stress over the full length of the bars at any one load* 

The value of the actual bond stress at various points along 
the bar may also be obtained from this type of grap., 

The deflection readings taken were plotted to give 
the usual Load-Aeflection curves for the concrete beam. 

In this case, due to the sinking end-supports, the true 
deflection of the beam at the load point had to be computed 
a u this was done graphically.

{ f) Interpretation 


1* Load-otres s Curves . 

The Load-6 tress curves give the best over-all picture 
of the variation of stress in the bors throughout the test. 

A study of these graphs shows the following features. 

In general, the actual stresses vary in the same manner 
as the theoretical stresses, but usually differ considerably 
in magnitude from them. As a whole the steel stresses 
tended to be somewhat lower than the theoretical, showing 
that the concrete was doing more work than assumed* This 
is especially true at loads up to the design load ta'bout 
16,000 pounds for 1], since little cracking had taken place 
in the concrete up to that time. At high loads, with 
much cracking, the actual steel stresses often exceeded 

.. cm. . .. ei lure IS that different 

bars at one section often showed large differences in stress 
earned. 

t m d©tc ilu of th arioua is aa i folio re; 

Graph Ho 1 shows good agreement between actual and 

theoretical tensile steel stress at the load-point section. 

A logical discrepancy arises as the section changes from the 

uncracked state to state where it is cracked up to near the 

neutral axis* The computed tensile stress in the concrete at 

a load of P *12,000 lbs. where the steel stress first 

begins to rise sharply, came to 540 p,s.i. This value is 

about the maximum tensile stress that the concrete {oQGQ 
lb.) could be expected to take. it may fee noted that

the theoretical st-el stress lines are not straight because 


the proving ring took varying fractions of the total load. 
Also, for the graph shown those values of stress mi: s- 
ured beyond 40,000 p.s.i. are in doubt as the yield point 
of the steel was at this value* 

Graphs 2 : nd o show the tensile steel stresses meas- 
ured in the top bars directly above the proving ring and 
at about 8" to the side of the <£. respectively. An 
import-’fit feature, of Graph Ho 2 is that v.uth a Load of P 
above three of trie top bars begin to lose stress very 

rapidly. In graph G, the actual stresses at about 6” 
to right and left of agree fairly closely with, the 
theoretical. 

Graphs 4 and 5 show the variation of stress in the 
compression steel at sections directly over the proving 
ring, and at 7** to each side of ^ respectively* the 
agreement with the theoretical stress is good at the latter 
sections, out there is a large difference at the 4L section. 
Graph 4 shows that the compressive steel over the support 
eventually carried tensile stresses, the change-over occurred 
at a load of P equal to about 28^, or 1.75 times the design 
load, and the tensile stresses eventually reached some

for the anchorage of the top bare in a region of com¬ 
pression concrete. The anchored portions were in compress¬ 
ion u, to a load of about 20 kips, after which the stress 
changed to tension. This would indicate that they began 
to fulfil their urpose as anchorage at that time. The ten¬ 
sile stress increased to a maximum at a load of about 28 kips, 
after which it fell somewhat. A check on the anchorage 
bond stress along the a. 1:1. bar showed maximum values of 
570 and 400 p*a.1. at the 28 and oQ kip loads respectively. 
This is likely the limit of the adhesive resistance of tir. 
bond on the bar, being of the order of the 540 p.s.i, found 
in Pull-Out Test Bo. 1, 

Graph 7 is for anchorage of two bottom compressive 
'bars in a region of tension concrete. The two gages show 
low tensile stresses u to a load of about 28 kips, after 
which the stress increased rapidly. This again would indic¬ 
ate the anchorage becoming effective, and is at about the 
load mere these bars showed large tension stresses over 
the proving ring* The maximum anchorage bond stress occurr¬ 
ing at the ends of the two bars when P equalled 54 kips was 
computed bo be 550 p.s.i, on one bur, and >.4G p*s.i. on the 
other. These figures are of doubtful value .as they depend 
entirely on one gage ra-.ding*

err eked condition of the concrete more nearly approximated 
the theoretical assumxjt ions at that time. 

Graphs 8 and 9 are for the bottom bars at loads of 
2T eq.tr 1 to 48 and 68 kips respectively. The latter load 
is in the order of the failure load# The curves show a 
general agreement as to type of scress, and at some sections 
there is good agreement as to values of intensity of stress. 
Graph 9 gives some values of the actual bond stresses due 
to shearing forces in the beam. The highest value is about 
o45 p.s.i, for the B-8 bar# There was no failure of bond 
under this stress but this was probably due to the anchorage 
of the hook on the bar. in general, the existing bond 
stresses due to shearing forces were lower th; n the theoretical 
as may be seen from the slopes of the stress curves. 

Graphs 10 a»d 11 are the stress Distribution graphs for 
the bars that were bent up, as well as for the other top bars. 
The tensile stresses across the top tend to fee loner than the 
theoretical at the point of maximum moment, and higher as 
the distance from the t increases. Bond stresses due 
to shearing forces are.much lower than the theoretical.

indicate that the ends of the hoo s were not called upon for 
anchorage until very high stresses existed in the t rs. 
one cannot obtain reliable figures on the value of hooks 
from the scant readings taken* However, the indication 
is that the hooks prevented failure in bond of the bottom 
reinforcing bars. The result was that these bars carried 
stresses right up to the yield point.

(g) discussion 


Taken as a whole, the beam test had certain weaknesses, 
as well as considerable value. 

The number of strain gages used was barely sufficient 
to give a good indication of bond stresses throughout 
the beam. The acta 1 effective number of gage locations 

0 wit ecausc of their symmetrical placing, 

: <3 to : - boat 18 by the spoiling ox 
gages* of these a few could probably have bee, ..ore 
strategically placed. Tor instance,- the value of hooks 
could nave been more accurately determined by placing a 
gage on the bur just before the hook itself. Also, it is 
regretted that not enough gages were available to allow 
placing some on the stirrups. 

A more complete picture of the behaviour of the 
stresses was gained using the method described than was 
possible using other methods. Several events in the 
history of the load test which would otherwise be in 
doubt could be interpreted with the aid of the strain 
gage readings. Thus hair-cracks, although not visible, 
must have developed under the load-point when the. total 
load was about 24 kips. At the design load of o2 kips the 
steel stresses were lower than the theoretical, and by 
a considerable amount at certain points. Anchorage of the 
top reinforcing bars first came inLo effect at a total 
load, of 44 kips, furthermore, this anchorage, by a straight

embedded length f 10 inches of ter in compression 
concrete, was insufficient to develop more than a 
maximum tensile stress of 24,000 p.s*i # in the barSf 
far below their capacity* if these bars had been hooked 
the capacity of the beam would undoubtedly have been 
increased. After the slippage of the toxj bars occurred, 
more moment m s transferred to the quarter-points* 
the' bottom bars, being anchored by hooks, were able to 
carry this load until their yield point was reached. 

The beam ay be considered to have failed at this point, 
the load-being about 68 . The beam began to deflect 
rapidly at the load point and the tension crack which 
existed there increased in width. The fact that ore 
load was taken (up to ?!r ') was due to the greatly increased 
rate of loading necessary towards the end of the test. 

The slip of the top bars also allowed a rapid 
widening of the tension crack which existed in the top 
concrete almost directIp above the proving ring. This 
crack travelled downwards until it nearly traversed the 
beam* This probably explains the setting up of tension 
stresses in the compressive reinforcing over the centre- 
support which began at a total load of 56 kips. in fact, 
it is difficult to conceive any other reason for this, 

(4ince considerable negative mo m ent existed, over the centre 
support right up io the end of the test. 

The correlation of anchorage bond stresses measured 
in the beam with those found in the pull-out tests is 














































' 


























































uncertain . This wa s because too few gauges w , re plac©d 
on the anchored portions of the bars in the beam. The few 
results computed indicate an agreement in the order of 
magnitude of bond stresses developed, but are not suffic¬ 
ient to differentiate the bond stresses due to tension 
and compression concrete. 

The measured bond stresses due to shearing forces 
in the beam are lower than the theoretical as a rule. 

This was especially true of the top bars which maintained 
a rate of c .ange of stress much lower than the theoretical. 
The agreement is better for the bottom tensile bars at 
high loads. 

It is difficult to judge the requirements -■£ the 
J.h.5... . Code regarding bond in the light of the result.: 
of this test. It 'would appeal 9 that the factor of safety 
allowed in anchorage bond is not too high. whether the 
same applies to the bond stresses allowed on hooks 
(125,J of the value for straight embedment} cannot be 
said, as more data is required on the effectiveness of 
hooks* The allowable bond stress due to shearing forces 
would be too felgh for the strength of concrete used, 
if judged by this test* The computed theoretical bond 
stress on the tow bars at the 56 kip load was only 
220 p.e.i, (see graph li) and yet, the bars were rapidly 
losing stress at this time. The allowable stress, 
according to the code, is 240 p.s.i. for 5000 pound con¬ 
crete. A slip of the bars at this stress is surprising. 










































■ 





























rossibly the fact that the to,. .;irs were spaced some¬ 
what t ,ore closely in the poured hear: than the Code allows 
had a detrimental eifect on the development of bond 
strength. 

dome of the above results are in agreement with 
results of simple beam tests carried out by the Bureau 

of Reclamation in Denver, .S.A, They were described 

%■ 

in an article in the dune, 1948 Journal of the 
American Concrete institute. The tests showed the 
measured steel stresses iri simple beams reinforced with 
one bar to be considerably below the theoretical values. 
The maximum bond stress due to shearing forces vv s found 
to be 580 p.s. i. for a §” ^ regular deformed bar.

This study of bond stresses, and the methods 
employed in its execution, though too limited to give 
proven results, has revealed some useful information. 

A summary of the most important ind icati ons follows. 

(a} . ull-Out Tests 

1. in pull-out tests of cylinders, the highest 
intensity of anchorage bond stress is devel¬ 
oped at the loaded end of the bar. . At low 
loads, the bond stress soon decreases, to a 
negligible ; mount at some distance from 

the unloaded end of the bar. At high loads, 
especially after slippage begins, the bond 
stress tends to become more uniform. 

2. Tension concrete in a pull-out test develops 
a higher intensity of anchorage bond stress 
than does compression concrete at the same load 
The total bond developed is about the mme in 
each case,

Hooks were very effective in their function as 










anchorage to permit development of tensile 
stresses in bars. 

Straight embedment of bars in compression 
concrete did not prove effective in devel¬ 
oping tensile stresses in the bars. 

jjond stresses due to shearing forces overcame 
the bond strength along the top bars at a 
very low value of bond stress. Close spacing 
of the top bars is suspected as the fault.

1. it was quite definitely shown that the employed 
method of measuring stresses inside concrete 
is reasonably satisfactory for laboratory 
work* 

B. The method has some possibilities for the 

field testing of reinforced concrete struct¬ 
ures under ide. 1 conditions. 

j. It was shown that a detail d p:ictux v e of the 
steel stress distribution in a reinforced 
concrete structure under a wide range of 
loads can be gained by using the technique 
of electric strain gage measurement.

(a j G eneral .descr iption 

An electric strain gage consists of a small grid of 
very fine wire solidly held toy strong glue between two 
pieces of thin paper. its principle of operation in measuring 
strain depends on the fact that the electrical resistance of 
the grid of wire varies directly as the strain that the grid 
may undergo* if the gage is cemented firmly to a mat■ rial, 
the grid of wires will suffer the same strains as the mat¬ 
erial does; by measuring the resistance changes of the 
grid by a sensitive galvanometer the actual strains in the 
material may toe found. The strains are then converted to 
stresses by multiplying by the Modulus of Elasticity of the 
material. 

The gagas used in this work were SR 4 gages made by 

the Baldwin Southwark Locomotive .orks, Philadelphia, U.S.A* 

The types available in the laboratory were A-l*s and A-o*s, 

with a gauge length of i§ inch, A coi lete description of

the method of applying these gages to steel surfaces is given 
by the makers in their Bulletin Ho. 179* n The SB 4 Bonded 
Resistance Wire Strain Gage‘% and need not be repeated here, 
..hen properly attached, the strain gage grid is rig* 
idly bonded to the steel ior other) surface, and yet is 
electrically insulated from it, it will work well as long 










as it remains completely dry, if, however, the gage becomes 
damp or wet, then, since the paper and glue surrounding the 
grid wires are not moisture resistant, the electrical cir¬ 
cuit through the grid is shorted or shunted through the bar 
or concrete and re: dings of resistance change are not 
reliable. The lower limit of the electrical resist, nee 
against this type of leakage is 50 me.. ohms between grid 
and r Tor absolutely reliable results. Thus gages attached 
to steel b: rs icanerseu in va. ter or wet concrete must be 
almost .rfectly- protected against entrance of moisture 
into hie grid and against electrical leakage out of the 
grid, usually over long periods of time. 

several methods of doing this have been developed 
by others (2, 5, 4jh In a paper to the A*C.i. (2J P two 
investigators of the U.a. bureau of Reclamation, renwer, 
have listed the requirements for an ideal type of 8R 4 
gage protection, and then have given a detailed descrip¬ 
tion of two methods which they have successfully used. 

In order to carry out the bond tests, one of the above 
methods was tried and tested in the laboratory. The account 
which follows describes this method of the application 
and waterproofing of 8B 4 gages on reinforcing ears, and 
its value and 'weaknesses,

.irst of all, excess paper is cut from the gage 
right up to ihe felt protection, and to the glue holding the 
le d out >ires. The surface at the gape location must be 
carefully cleaned and polished as usual, except that the 
are-: cleaned should extend about § inch on all sides of the 
gage itself. This is to insure close bond between the 
steel and waterproofing agent. 

In applying the gages to bars of circular cross- 
section it was found difficult to make the gage conform to 
the curved surface of the hr with, the fingers and at the 
same time keep the gage centre-line truly parallel to the 
direction of stress. To overcome this difficulty the gage was 
given a predetermined curvature and direction by first 
gluing it very lightly in an upside-clown position to a 
piece of bond caper, which/ was then glued solidly into a 
small wo©den.jig having the same curvature as the bar sur¬ 
face. The gage is then cemented to the bar as usual, being 
held in place by lightly clamping the wooden jig to the 
• (see Fig, 6 ) This procedure is especially useful in 
fastening two gages on exactly opposite sides of the bar, 
with both pages to measure strains at the same cross- 
section, and truly in line with the stress. After about 16 
hours of drying, the wooden jig can be pulled off, since 
the very light bond between paper and felt breaks, leaving 
the gage firmly attached to the bar.

aided by heating the gages to about 170 for an hourj, the 
waterproofing process may begin, The following list of 
steps contains the minimum procedure necessary to obtain 
reasonably good results; failure to omit any one of 
them may be sufficient cause to spoil a gage location, 

(1) Test the leakage resistance a n d tr ue r esistance 
of the app lied gage . Use a maximum test voltage 
of 45 volts to measure leakage resistance, and 
a ,/her tstone bridge to measure true resistance, 

A leakage resistance of lees than 50 me g~o teas* 
and a true resistance varying by more than 
l.*0 ohm from the listed resistance indicates 
that the gage is of doubtful usefulness and 
staould be re plac e d.

The insulated lead wires may be either the single 
or multi-str; nd type, preferably the former. rae

(5) Apply first, coat of Adhesive, lifting the 
vires clear of the felt* this, eaat is ix ...;ort- 
ant and should thoroughly cover the whole gage 
and about inch of the surrounding bar. The 
coat should be t flowed to dry thoroughly (takes 
about 1Z hours / 1 before proceeding. 

( 6 ) Apply a piece of electricians rubber tape about 
0 / 8 ,{ square to- the bar at the back end of the gr ge 

(opposite end to lead-outs), leaving up to 1 / 8 ** 
clearance between it and. the felt* 

Then lower the insulated leads to this and paint 

on a second liberal .coat of Adhesive . A thicker 
consistency of adhesive is better. 

(?) If the cover over the bare gage lead-outs and over 
the soldering is thin fmost likely j , cover these 
points with small pieces of electricians rubber tape.

using a small spatula. Thorough drying takes about 
12 hours oyer a radiator. 

illj apply e ^s econd fairly heavy coat of lygonite 

dement smoothing off the finished surface to a 

stream-linec shape . 

If the area of bond destroyed is not serious, then the 
the waterproofed gage may finally be wrapped with electricians 
tape to give further protection against the concrete. Also, 
if much time is available, the gages may be tested by 
immersing in water for 24 hours. 

The above steps are for the water-proofing method 
called the “Tygonite method” by the Bureau of Reclamation 
investigatory* and first described by them. These authors 
performed steps 4, 8, 7, and 8 above before painting on

any adhesive at all, i.e, they performed the electrical 
insulation before waterproofing and not at the s t me time* 

This required more thorough working-in of the adhesive, 
and xr s not successfully used by the author. 

{ d ) .discussion ox Method 

T.e method as described is rather tedious when only 
a few g- .yes are to be applied. About one week should be 
allowed for the application ox the gages, however, it takes 
very little•longer to waterproof twenty gages than it does 
to do one, and the whole process could be speeded up by 
applying heat up to 180for drying out the various coats. 

This method is best suited to laboratory investigations, 
but could be applied to field tests if the concrete place¬ 
ment around the gages were under strict supervision. in 
pouring the test beam, the gages were not "pampered" when 
it came to placing and rodding the concrete. 

One weakness of this method is that the electrical 
leakage resistance breaks down in time, depending on the 
amount of and thoroughness with which the various protect¬ 
ive coatings are.put on. In the laboratory, tests on 
pull-out cylinders completely immersed in water showed 
gages ‘hoiding-outfor one wee A, two weeks, four weeks, 
and then gradually beginning to leak* In the beam test, 
where the beam w.* a kept only damp, better results were 
obtained. This was partially due to an improvement in 







technique, hut also due to less water being available in 
the concrete. it seem© likely that in field, tests, espec¬ 
ially on concrete above ground level, the gages would, read 
accurately up to a period of two month© at least. 

As mentioned before, other etnods of waterproofing 
have been developed. A second method described by the 
Bureau of Acclamation involves vulcanising a neoprene 
rubber housing over the gr.ge to the steel bar. This method 
requires a special mold and furnace, and has apparently 

. • V , • ' 

been used onL on square bars, but it is more rugged, and 
holds promise for field tests according to the Bureau, 

Another method is described in- a paper in the a.K.b.A 

-Proceedings { ). The procedure is somewhat similar to the 

. 

Tygonite method, but ..-otrosene B rf&x is used as the chief 
waterproofing agent. Long-term leakage resistance is 

claimed in a field test. 

The results of all long-term tests are at present some 
what doubtful because of the tendency of the i)uco cement 
holding the gage to the steel to creep. This of course 
causea an extre strain in the gage not undergone by the 
material, causing resistance-change readings to be not 
truly representative of strains in the test material. The 
above mentioned article describes procedures to attempt to 
eliminate such errors.
