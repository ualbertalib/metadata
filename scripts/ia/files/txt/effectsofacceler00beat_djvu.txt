SYIVIOPSIS 


This study was an attempt to discover to what extent Grade X 
students, enrolled in Calgary and Edmonton schools, had been accelerated, 
and to ascertain the effects of acceleration on academic progress and on 
personal and social development. 

A promotion survey was completed by 2618 students. Of this group, 
169 pupils had been accelerated. Questionnaires and the Terman-McNemar 
Test of Mental Ability were administered to 149 accelerated students and 
to a larger preliminary control group. The final group of 119 accelerated 
students were matched with control students according to intelligence and 
as closely as possible, vjlth respect to age. Of the accelerated group, 
the sixty-eight students who had intelligence quotients of 120 or over 
were designated as the superior accelerated. 

Significantly higher marks were made by the superior control group 
as compared to the superior accelerated group, in the Grade IX final 
examinations in Reading and Language. 

The superior accelerated students held fewer official positions, 
were members of a smaller number of athletic teams and participated in 
fewer social activities, A preference for older comipanions was evident 
among the superior accelerated pupils. 

On a scale of personal and social characteristics, the similarities 
in the self-ratings of the two groups were marked. Teachers who scored 
twenty-four accelerated students on the same scale, gave them ratings as 
high as those which they gave to a control group. 

Over half of a.ccelerated students thought that being younger than

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBIEM 

"Acceleration has been the most commonly practised method of 
adjustment for superior children, and in many instances it has proved to 
be satisfactory from the standpoint of the child’s progress and develop*- 
mento’*^ If the lower limit of selection is set at an intelligence 
quotient of 120, approximately 7 per cent of the school population is 
mentally superior. Should this group be accelerated? 

A study of "Promotion Practices and Policies in Alberta Schools," 

2 

reported by Clarke, showed that during the school term 1953“-1954» only 
0o42 per cent of a total of 80,649 students in grades one to eight in 
Alberta schools were accelerated. At the end of the same school 3^ear, 
the percentage of students who were to be failed was 5«4d 

Theoretically, if five per cent of the pupils in each grade are 
mastering school work so slowly as to warrant their repeating the 
gr8,de, at the opposite extreme another five per cent should be 
mastering it so rapidly as to warrant taking two grades in one 
year or three grades in two years 

Should more Alberta students be accelerated? The answer to this 
question depends in part on what has happened to those pupils who have 
been advanced more rapidly than usual. Has acceleration interfered with 
their scholastic achievement? Have they developed in a satisfactory way

socially and personally? 

For the present study, it was necessary to find out how many of the 
Calgai^’- and Edmonton Grade X students had been accelerated. An attempt 
vjas then made to determine the effects of acceleration on the academic 
progress and on the social and personal development of these students# 

4 

Terman and Oden found that accelerated students did better work in 
school than students of equal ability who had progressed at the normal 
rate. How did the marks made by accelerated Calgary and Edmonton students 
on the Grade IX final examinations, compare with the marks made hj non¬ 
accelerated students? Lid accelerated students show any marked deficien¬ 
cies in examination subjects? 

Children who are exceptionally well developed physically,, 
mentally and socially find satisfaction in working with others 
who may be older than they by one or two years| but acceleration 
beyond this point is ordinarily considered inadvisable for most 
children because of the complications of social maladjustment 
that may arise 

Does moderate acceleration tend to retard the social and personal 
development of students? Terman and Oden^ found that accelerated students 
were not appreciably different from others in social adjustment. An 
effort vms made in this study to compare accelerated and non-accelerated 
pupils with respect to social and personal characteristics, ¥ould the

self-ratings of personal and social adjustment by accelerated students be 
similar to those by students who had completed one grade each year? 

Would their teachers rate the accelerated students as hi^ly as others on 
a scale of personal and social traits? Were the accelerated students as 
active socially as others? Did they show a marked preference for older 
companions? Were they chosen as frequently to play on athletic teams? 
Were they leaders as often as were non-accelerated students? 

Were accelerated students in favor of rapid advancement in school? 
In what ways did they consider that it had helped them in their school 
vfork, in their social life, or in their personality developaent? In what 
ways, according to their opinions, ha.d it hindered them? 

The provisions made in our schools for children of above-average 
ability are of tremendous im.portance. The superior students of today are 
the potential leaders of tomorrow. Society cannot afford to let them 
drift through school without a challenge. Enrichment of curricula for 
superior students in special classes or in the regiilar classroom may be 
valuable practices. Not many schools are offeri-ng such enriched programso 
In schools where a differentiated curriculum for superior students is 
possible, acceleration may be needed too. If accelerated students make 
satisfactory’- scholastic progress and if they develop adequately socially 
and personally, it would seem advisable to allow moderate acceleration of 
superior students as one method of meeting their needs®

CHAPTER II 


RELATED LITERATURE 


\Th&t do the experts say about the acceleration of superior 
7 

children? Recently, V/itty, who is an advocate of moderate accelera¬ 
tion, summarized the findings of other researchers of note. The 
following quotations from Witty's article indicate that Trusler, Pressey, 


and Worcester favor a greater use of acceleration for children of above 
average abilityo 

During the past thirty years, acceleration has again and again- 
been proposed as a desirable way of meeting the educational needs 
of the giftedo Once again it is being recommended to various 
degrees,'' 


As early as 1933} Witty and Wilkins summarized, the literati^re 
on acceleration and found that moderate amounts of acceleration 
seemed justifiable for the gifted, J, W* Trusler^ later 
recommended more frequent use of acceleration for pupils of 
I, 


This recommendation seems to be in accord with suggestions 
drawn from genetic studies^^ which show that acceleration in the 
elementary?- school up to two f^ill ^ades is not associated with 
undesirable later adjustment in the gifted. Recently, S. L, Pressey

studied some relationships of acceleration to success in college 
and concluded 'The evidence was practically unaniirious that 
younger entrants were more likely to graduate, had the best 
academic records, won the most honors and presented the lowest 
disciplinary difficulties.’ 

12 

Still more recently. Dean Worcester has recommended a greater 
use of acceleration in the education of children of above average 
ability. Despite such recommendations, skepticism is shown by 
many administrators, supervisors and teachers concerning the 
desirability of this practice—particularljr at the high school 
level. However, acceleration appears to be gaining somewhat in 
acceptability as one way to care for the gifted* 

14 

Terman and Oden recommend that nearly all children of 135 I. Q. 
or higher should be accelerated by one or two years, Hildreth,Baker^^ 
and others prefer special classes and enrichaient of the curriculum for 
the students of superior mental ability. If no such provisions are made, 

however, "acceleration takes place as a natural phenomenon," comments 

IT 18 

Baker, Of the gifted children who attend special classes, Hildreth 

says, "These children at the end of the elementary school are, on the 

average, a grade or more ahead of typical Tmpils in school achievement, 

the three R's and content studies,"

Another writer, Meister, favors enriched-acceleration hut he sees 
a need for more research. 

We need more facts and more studies in the area of both raw and 
enriched acceleration. We will know when to take calculated risks in 
the education of children when we know more about the nature of in¬ 
tellectual and social growth in individuals of different ability 
levels.... 

In order to determine educators’ opinions about acceleration of 
20 

gifted students, Wilson included a question regarding acceleration in 
a questionnaire which he sent to 1054 school administrators and to presi¬ 
dents and heads of departments of teacher-training colleges. Wilson re¬ 
ceived a total of 749 replies to the questions 

Do you agree with the following suggestion of Professor Terman; 
’children of 155 I.Q. or higher should be promoted sufficiently to 
permit college entrance by the age of 17 at latest and a majority in 
this group would be better off to enter at 16'. 

The responses indicated that 50 per cent of the educators agreed 
with Terman and that 50 per cent of the school administrators and 20 per 
cent of the college professors disagreed with him. Many of those who 
replied expressed concern about the social and personal development of 
gifted children. Wilson felt that, since 50 per cent of the educational 
leaders of the United States favored acceleration for gifted children, 
there would be noticeable soon a trend toward the more general use of

rapid advancement of superior students* 

Several studies, similar in nature to the present study, have been 
21 

made. In 1930, Engle made a survey of the senior high school students in 
Michigan City who had had one, two or three double promotions. The twenty- 
nine pupils who had had one double promotion were found to have a grade- 
point average of 1*9 as compared to that of 1*8 for the 110 senior stu¬ 
dents. Forty-six students who were selected at random from the senior 
class had a grade-point average of 1,5. The sixteen students who had had 
two double promotions had a grade-point average of 2,2 and the one student 
who had had three double promotions had a grade-point average of 2.8. The 
accelerated students made a better average than other students. 

The two weaknesses of this study seem to have been (l) the small 
number of cases available and ( 2 ) the failure to consider differences in 
mental ability. A selection of forty-six pupils having mental ability com¬ 
parable to that of the accelerated group would have been a better control 

than the random choice of forty-six pupils from the senior class, 

22 

Bight years later, T, L, Engle investigated the ’‘Effects of School 
Acceleration Upon the Personality and Social Adjustments of High School and 
University Students”. Since Engle considered that general intelligence and.

school marks probably influenced personality and social adjustments, he 
matched the accelerated and non-accelerated groups on four bases: (l) sex 
( 2 ) grade location ( 3 ) intelligence rating within five points as measured 
by standardized intelligence tests ( 4 ) scholastic standing. 

The mean intelligence quotient for 136 accelerated high school 
students was 117.1 and for 136 non-accelerated high school students, 115. 
The mean centile score on the A.C.E. Psychological Examination for 64 
accelerated Indiana University students was 72.3 and for 64 non-accelerated 
University students, 72.7. Pinal marks for the year were used to determine 
scholastic standing. The values assigned to each grading for high school 
students were as follows: H-4, A-3j B~2, C-1, D-0. For university gradings 
the following schedule was used: A-3, B-2, 0-1, B-0, B-0. In all cases, 
pairs were matched within five-tenths of a point average. 

The Cowan Adolescent Personality Schedule was administered. Bound 
with it, there was a questionnaire iiicluding such questions as ^’Did you 
skip one or more grades in elementary school? If so, which one or ones? 

23 

If so, do you think it has been a handicap to you in a social way?”" 

The following quotation is included because of the inclusion of some 

of the items in the student questionnaire of the present study. 

Subjects V7ere asked to indicate the number of social activities in 
which they had engaged during the past two weeks, classifying their 
answers under the headings: 

A. Parties without dancing 

B. Dances or parties with dancing 

C. Theatre or movies

E* All other activities, if any24 

Those students who felt that they had been handicapped by being 

accelerated were interviewed at a later date by Mr, Engle, and asked to 

write down their reasons for their opinions. 

The results obtained in the study shoi^ed that "the mean personality 

schedule score for all accelerated high school subjects was 39*8 and for 

non-accelerated high school subjects it was 40,4« Corresponding figures 

25 

for university students were 43a6 and 41»0"« 

Engle concluded that 

"In general, it may be said that there is no apparent relationship 
between personality schedule scores of those entering high school or 
university younger than the usual age and those entering at the usual 
ageo 

Although the data was not statistically reliable, on the whole there 
is a suggestion that accelerated students are not quite so active 
socially as their non-accelerated classma.tese, When compared with 
students of their own chronological age, they are found to be just as 
active socially. Even those who believed they were handicapped were 
as active socially as those who said they were not* For students be¬ 
lieving themselves to be socially handicapped, the difficulty seems to 
result from a feeling of being different from their fellows” 

The present study attempted to measure social and personal develop¬ 
ment of accelerated students in a variety of ways rather than by the use of 
a personality inventory as did Engle* The accelerated students were given 
an opportxmity to state their opinions of the effects of acceleration, as 
they were in Engle's study* No personal interviews were held however*

Terman and others found that acceleration was favored by some 

authorities because it increased the child's motivation, prevented dawdling 

and allowed earlier graduation from college* They found that certain 

educators deprecated acceleration because it was thought that grade skij?- 

ping made social adjustment difficult, that it promoted bookishness, that 

it was dangerous to physical and mental health and that it left gaps in 

the child's academic knowledge and skills* Terman tried to test the truth 

of these statements in his extensive work with gifted children* 

28 

In Terman*s study of the problem of acceleration, the age of high 
school graduation was used as the index of the degree of acceleration* 

Group I included those students who graduated before the age of fifteen 
and one-half years. Group II consisted of st^idents who graduated between 
the ages of fifteen and one-half years and sixteen and one-half years* 

Group III or the non-accelerated students graduated at the age of sixteen 
and one-half years or above that age* The mean age for each of the three 
groups was indicated* 

Accelerated students made higher scores on the childhood Binet testo 
The mean I,Qi, for 157 accelerated boys was 156*1 whereas the mean I,Q,» for 
565.non-accelerated boys was 149®?* This difference was statistically sig¬ 
nificant since the critical ratio was 5*6* The corresponding results for 
the girls were as follows: the mean I,CI, for 145 accelerated girls was

153*1 for 300 non-rccelerated girls, 149*2• The critical ratio in 

00 

this case was 3^.5 vrhich indicates that the difference vjas significant0“^ 

The accelerated children made better marks in 1922 in the elementary 
grades on a three-hour battery of objective tests. The difference was sig¬ 
nificant as the critical ratio for boys was 4.9 and for girls, the critical 

30 

ratio was 5.90 

In referring to this study, Terman and Oden have summarized the 
results as follows: 

( 

The accelerated students did better in high school, more of them 
graduated from college, more graduated with honors, and more of those 
graduating continued for graduate work. It is especially significant 
that at the average age of 30 years, the accelerated students were more 
often in the group for occupational success than were the non¬ 
accelerated students,^^ 

Several measures of social adjustment were used. Parents and 
teachers rated the students in 1922 and again in 1928» No significant dif¬ 
ferences in social adjustment were found between the advanced group and 
the control group. Trained field workers rated the accelerated students 
in 1928 slightly lower in this regard than the control group but the dif¬ 
ference was not statistically significant. Accelerated students were 
found to have a marked preference for older companions, Terman considered 
this preference a favorable sign* High school boys who had been accelera¬ 
ted did not have such mature extra-curricular interests as did those who 
had progressed at a norm.al rate. In college, this difference seemed to 
disappear* There seemed to be no relationship between extra-curricular

interests and acceleration in the case of high school girls,"" 

Terman and Oden have made the following comments with regard to 
this study: 

In social adjustment, there was no appreciable difference between 
the two groups in childhood or in adult life* Extra-curricular acti¬ 
vities in college vrere orily a trifle less common among the accelerated 
*.,. .Even if vre make some allovrance for the probability that good 
social adjustment was sometimes a prerequisite for extra promotion, 
there is reason to believe that the influence of school acceleration 
is causing social maladjustment has been greatly exaggerated* There 
is no doubt that maladjustment does result in individual cases, but 
our data indicate that in a majority of subjects it involves chiefly 
a temporary feeling of inferiority vrhich is later overcome* 

Jo Justman ‘ studied the academic progress of intellectually gifted 
accelerated students and non-accelerated students in senior high school. 

He concluded that the progress of the accelerated students was as satis¬ 
factory as that of- the non-aecelerated students 9 

^Jhen both final marks and scores on the Regents* examinations were 
used as criteria of academic achievement in high school, only minor 
differences were found betvreen groups of accelerants and non- 
accelerants* Evident 13 % intellect^lall 3 ^ gifted_ pupils who have been 
accelerated by one year through attendance in a special-progress class 
on the junior-high level can, and do, maintain themselves in academic 
achievement in senior high school* The same degree of mastery in the 
academic areas to which attention was directed is shorn by accelerants 
despite the fact that they are a year ^foimger, on the average, than 

equally gifted non-accelerants,55 

Several experiments have shOT-m that accelerated students are success¬ 
ful in college, . Terman*s follow-up of accelerated students, twenty-five 
3 ^ears later has already?- been mentioned* 

At the Universiti^ of Illinois, under a selective acceleration pro¬ 
gram, a student could be admitted one or more semesters before graduation

•from high school. The student must be recommended by his high school 
faculty, he must have completed a certain number of ^onits and he must 
demonstrate intellectual ability, social maturity, and emotional stability* 

Irwin Berg and Robert Larsen^^ compared the marks made by accelerated 
students at the end of the freshman year with the marks made by all fresh-» 
men at the university over a three-year period and also with the marks made 
by 340 College of Agriculture freshmen. The accelerated students earned 
grades averaging slightly more than one standard deviation above the average 
of all University freshmen and above the average of the College of Agri¬ 
culture freshmen. ”It is believed that the performance of this group of 

37 

accelerated students demonstrates a high level of scholastic achievement”. 

•20 

Recently, Plesher and Pressey^ made a follow-up study of 104 
accelerated university women who had completed a four-year undergraduate 
program in three years from 1941 through 1945» Previous studies of this 
group of accelerated undergraduates had shovjn the following results; 

The average academic record of these 104 accelerates was foimd to 
be better than the records of 104 other women graduating in the same 
period who entered at the same age, made approximately the same scores 
on the test of general ability given at entrance, and took the same 
type of program, but who spent the usual four years in obtaining an 
undergraduate degree. The accelerates also participated reasonably in 
extra-curricular activities. And a follow-up a couple of years after 
graduation showed them beginning their careers in as promising fashion 
as the paired ‘regular* cases.

The latest follow-up study of these accelerated university students 
indicated the same trend. 

The accelerates in important respects actually did better than the 
controls: in academic record, number obtaining advanced training and 
number continuing a career. Previous research of the writers, and the 
findings of Terman regarding his gifted group, indicate that accele¬ 
rates are more likely to be successful and even distinguished in their 
careers. 

In most studies above referred to, accelerates were equated with 
controls in initial ability, but not in ambition and energy. The 
person with more drive may more often accelerate and work harder in 
school and job. Certain other studies liave been broad enough or so 
planned that they somewhat allow for these factors, and still the 
accelerates did better. Might acceleration in itself have beneficial 

effects?55 

The studies cited in this chapter seemed to show that accelerated 
students made just as satisfactory^ academic progress as students of com¬ 
parable mental ability who had progressed at the ncrffl8.1 rate. Accelerated 
students who made significantly higher scores than the non-accelerated 
students in standardized intelligence tests, made higher marks in school 
than the control students, as one would expect. In general, the studies 
indicated that accelerated students were found to be as well-developed 
socially and personally as were the non-accelerated students. 

In the present study, an attempt will be made to compare the 
scholastic progress of accelerated and non-accelerated Grade X students® 
The two groups will be equated as closely as possible with respect to 
mental ability. The social and personal development of accelerated and 
non-accelerated students vrill be studied with particular emphasis on such 
qualities as leadership and sociability.

SD1#IARY OF RESPONSES 

Every high school in Edmonton and in Calgary participated in the 
sui*vey. The total number of promotion questionnaires which were completed 
and returned was 2618, Table I shows the distribution of the responses 
according to school. 

SELECTION OF THE PRBLIMINMY ACCEI^IRATSL GROUP 

The first high school surveyed was Western Canada High School in 
Calgary. Every student in this school who indicated in his answers to the 
promotion questionnaire that he had progressed in school at a rate faster 
than normal was included in the first estimate of accelerated students. 

In all other schools, students who were definitely over-age because of 
failure before acceleration or because of late school entrance, were auto¬ 
matically eliminated and were not included in the preliminary accelerated 
group. The older accelerated students from Western Canada High School and

a few from other schools who were later found to be in this category, had 
to be excluded but in some cases their corresponding control students were 
made the control students for other pupils* The choice of two preliminary 
control students for every accelerated student would have been a superior 
systemo 

The preliminary accelerated group was composed of ninety-eight 
Calgary students and ninety-two Edmonton students» Since not all Grade X 
students could be given the Terman-Md^^emar Test of Mental Ability, which 
was to be the final basis of e<Mparison according to intelligence quo¬ 
tients, a choice of preliminary control students had to be made* The 
general plan was to equate the accelerated and preliminary control students 
according to 

(a) school attended in the current year 

(b) type of scholastic program 

(c) sex 

(d) intelligence quotient 

(e) age* 

In every case matching according to school attended and sex was 
achieved* With four exceijtions, the preliminary control students were 
taking the same scholastic course as their corresponding accelerated 
students* The matching processes according to intelligence quotient and 
age were much more difficult. 

For the Calgary group, birthdates and intelligence quotients were 
sectored from the cumulative records filed in each school* Intelligence

quotients as measured by the Laycock Test of Mental Ability were recorded 
for seventy accelerated students. These students were matched with pre- 
liminai^'- control students according to Laycock intelligence quotients 
within nine points. In eight cases the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability 
Test (Gamma) was used for comparison. The differences between the Otis 
intelligence quotients of these accelerated students and their preliminary 
control students were no greater than three pointso No record of intelli¬ 
gence quotients was available for twenty accelerated students. Preliminary 
control students were chosen for these without considering intelligence 
quotients. 

Birth-dates were not recorded for six Calgary students. The age of 
each preliminary control student chosen for ninety-one of the accelerated 
students was within eighteen months of the age of the corresponding accelera¬ 
ted student. One control student was twenty months older than the 
accelerated student® 

Ninety-two Edmonton students were included in the first estimate 
of accelerated students. Prom the promotion survey returns^ an alphabeti¬ 
cal class list was prepared for each class in each Edmonton high school® 

The birthdate of each student was recorded. Age^ sex^ and school attended 
were the deciding factors in the preparation of a list of 359 students^ 
from which the preliminary control students were to be chosen® 

Matching of accelerated students and preliminary control students 
according to intelligence quotient was achieved in the following manners

basis of comparison. The General Test raw scores for eighty-four 

accelerated students and for 359 other students mentioned above, were 

listed from the Examinations Branch records. By the method described 

in the Guide to the Interpretation of the Grade IX General Test 

40 

Administered June 1955 , intelligence quotients were computed for the 
accelerated students and for 241 additional students. Prom the latter 
group, preliminary control students were selected# 

The intelligence quotients of eighty-tliree accelerated students were 
matched within eight points of the intelligence quotients of the respective 
preliminary control students. For one student whose intelligence quotient 
was 152, the best available choice was a preliminarjr control student whose 
intelligence quotient was 132, For eight students for whom there was no 
record of a General Test score, the control students were chosen without 
regard to intelligence. Later, all accelerated students for whom no Grade 
IX records were available were eliminated from the study. 

The age of seventy-eight of the preliminary control students was 
within eighteen months of the age of the corresponding accelerated stu¬ 
dents, The difference in age between six of the accelerated students and 
their respective control students ranged from nineteen months to twenty- 
four months. The eight students for whom no records were available were 
discarded, as explained above.

THE ADMINISTRATION OP THE TERMAN-McNEMAR 
TEST AND THE STUDENT QUESTIONNAIRES 


21 


The second phase of the study consisted in the administration 

of the Terman-McNemar Test of Mental Ability - Form C to the preliminary 

accelerated group and to the preliminary control group in each high 

school in Calgary and in Edmonton<, Immediately following the completion 

of the test, the students were given a questionnaire to answer. During 

the preparation of the questionnaire, the information forms used by Terman 
41 

were studied. Cumulative record cards and student information blanks 
used in the Guidance Departments of the Calgary high schools were also 
consulted, A copy of the questionnaire follows, 

QUESTIONNAIRE FOR GRADE X STUDENTS 

Considerable thought is being given today to the provisions being 
made for students in our schools. Some people argue that students should 
finish school more quickly. Others think that the curriculum is now so 
crowded that students in Grades I to IX need more time to complete their 
work satisfactorily. This survey, which is a private research study, is 
being sent to selected Grade X students in an attempt to discover how age 
is related to achievement in school and to personal and social adjustment. 
Please be as frank and truthful as possible so that the information 
you provide will be of value to future students.

Several changes were made in the form of the student question¬ 
naires for Edmonton students. Item six was omitted. The date, signature 
and home address were deleted from the final page because such informa¬ 
tion as was needed was available on the front page of the Terman-McKemar 
Test, These changes made it possible tp limit the questioimaire to three 
pages instead of four® 

SWIARY OF RESPONSES

TEACHERS* ESTIMTES OF STUDENT ADJUSTMENT 

For the Western students in the Calgary group, teachers’ 
estimates of personal and social adjustment were obtained* A rating 
scale similar to the one included in the Questionnaire for Grade X 
Students was completed by one or two teachers for each student* A 
copy of the Questionnaire for Teachers follows# 

QITBSTIOMAIRE FOR TEACHERS 

Considerable thought is being given today to the provisions being 
made for students in our schools* Some people contend that superior 
students should finish school more quickly* Others think that the 
curriculum is now so crowded that all students need more time to complete 
their work satisfactorily* This survey is being sent to teachers of 
selected Grade X students in an attempt to discover how acceleration is 
related to achievement in school and to personal and social adjustments 
Marks on the Grade IX examinations will be used as the criteria of 
success in school work* 

Please rate ____many of the 

follovring items as possible by placing a check mark immediately below the 
phrase which best describes him (or her)» 

(l) Is he (or she) quiet or talkative? 

Talks very Rather A rather good A good Talks too 

little quiet conversationalist conversationalist much

CHAFPER IV 


THE COMPOSITION OP THE ACCELERATED 
AND CONTROL GROUPS 

A student was included in the final accelerated group if he had 
entered Grade I before the age of five and one-half years, or if he had 
entered Grade I before the age of six years and six months and later had 
skipped a grade or if he had entered Grade I before the age of six years 
and six months and later had completed two grades in one year, A student 
from any of the three above categories who failed later, was also included. 
Any pupil who failed and who was accelerated later was omitted. New 
Canadians who completed several grades in one year while learning the 
English language were excluded. Students who had entered Grade I after 
the age of six years and one-half and who later had skipped grades or had 
completed two grades in one year were also excluded. 

Twenty-six students were eliminated from the final accelerated 
group because they were overage. 

Each student in the final accelerated group of 119 pupils, was 
matched with a final control student with respect to the following 
criteria: 

(a) school attended in the current year, 

(b) type of present scholastic program being taken, ^fith thirteen 
exceptions, 

(c) sex.

(d) Terman-McNemar intelligence ciuotient, 

(e) chronological age. 

The matching of the two groups according to intelligence q_uotient 
and age will he dealt with at some length. Suitable controls could not 
he found for twenty-three accelerated students. 

The distribution of Terman-Mclemar intelligence quotients for the 
entire accelerated group is given in Table The mean intelligence 

quotient for the group was 122.1 with a standard deviation of 11.1. The 
mean intelligence quotient was 124.0 for boys and 120,7 for girls, with 
standard deviations of 9*4 for boys and 11*8 for girls* 

Table V indicates that the mean intelligence quotient for the 
control boys was 125.9, for the control girls, 119*5, and for the entire 
control group 122.1, The standard deviations were 7*8 for the boys, 

9*3 for the girls and 9.6 for the whole gToup, 

Probably the students liaving intelligence quotients below 120 
should not have been accelerated. Consequently, a division was made 
between accelerated students having an intelligence quotient of 120 or 
above, which were designated as Group I (a), and those having an intelli¬ 
gence quotient below 120, which were designated as Group II (a). This 
separation made possible a fairer comparison of the superior accelerated 
students with the superior control students who were called Group I (c). 
Group II (c) included the control students corresponding to the accelera¬ 
ted students having intelligence quotients below 120, Group II (a). In

every case, the accelerated students were grouped accurately according to 
their intelligence quotients Each control student was included in the 
control group corresponding to the group in which the matching accelera^- 
ted student belonged. In two instances, the intelligence quotients of 
the control students were slightly above 120, but they were included in 
Group II (c) because their matching accelerated students were in Group 
II (a). Similarly, in five instances, the intelligence quotients for the 
control students were slightly below 120 but they were placed in Group I 
(c) because the corresponding accelerated students were in Group I (a). 

Tables VI to IX show the distribution of intelligence quotients for 
the two groups of control students, and the mean intelligence quotients 
and standard deviations for the two control groups and the two accelera¬ 
ted groupso 

Tables VII and IX indicate that the accelerated and control groups 
were matched fairly well v/ith respect to Terman-McNemar intelligence 
quotients. The mean intelligence quotient for Group I (a) was 129o8

with a standard deviation of 7.3* The mean intelligence quotient for the 
control Group I (c) was 129o8 with a standard deviation of 6.8. The mean 
intelligence quotient for the accelerated Group II (a) was 111,8 with a 
standard deviation of 5.4 whereas the mean intelligence quotient for the 
corresponding control Group II (c) was 111,9 with a standard deviation of 
5.8. 

How- closely matched were the pairs of accelerated and control 
students T,d.th respect to intelligence quotients? Table X shows the 
differences in the Terman-McNemar intelligence quotients for each pair. 

If the intelligence quotient of the accelerated student were greater than 
that of the control student the difference was given as a positive 
quantity. For ninety-eight pairs, the difference was five points or less* 
For eleven pairs, the difference was six points. There were ten deviating 
pairs in which the differences ranged from eight points to eleven. 

Tables XI and XII show the differences in intelligence quotients 
for the pairs of superior accelerated and non-accelerated students and 
for the pairs of normal accelerated and non-accelerated students. 

The matching of students according to chronological age presented 
some difficulties. The mean age for the total group of accelerated 
students was fourteen years and nine months. The mean age for the com¬ 
plete control group wras fifteen years and five months. The distributions 
according to age are given for the four groups in Tables XIII and XIV. 

The greatest difference in age was found between Group I (a), the

'^he preceding data with respect to the chronological ages of the 
accelerated and non-accelerated students have compared the various groups* 
V/hat was the difference in chronological age for each of the selected 
pairs of students? Table XV shows these differences expressed in months« 
For two of the 119 pairs, the difference in age between the accelerated 
student and the non-accelerated student was twenty-one months* In all 
other cases, the difference in age between the accelerated student and 
the control student was eighteen months or less* For ninety-nine plains, 
the difference was no greater than one year* 

Table XVI shows the differences in chronological age for the 
superior accelerated and non-accelerated students* Table Till deals with 
age differences for normal accelerated and control students, 

SliMARY OF RESULTS 

lo The eq.uating of the environment for the accelerated students and con¬ 
trol students was achieved to a certain extent by requiring that each 
control student be chosen from the same school. In all except thirteen 
cases, the accelerated student was tohing the same course in Grade X 
as the corresponding control student* 

2a The accelerated students were divided into two groups, one comprised 
of students having an intelligence quotient of 120 or over and the 
other comprised of students ha'^^'ing an intelligence quotient under 120* 
3» The mean intelligence quotient of the superior accelerated students 
was 129«8 id.th a standard deviation of 7*3 while the mean intelligence

quotient for the superior control students was 129.8 with a standard 
deviation of 6«8. For the inferior groups, the mean intelligence 
quotient of accelerated students was 111.8 with a standard deviation 
of 5.4 and of the control students, 111.9 with a standard deviation of 

5.8. 

4. The difference in Terman-Mchemar intelligence quotients for each 
accelerated student and the corresponding control student was recorded 
and tabulated. For 109 pairs, the difference was six points or less. 
For ten pairs, the differences ranged from eight points to eleven. 

5. The mean age for the superior accelerated students vjas fourteen years 
and eight months whereas the mean age for the superior control students 
was fifteen years and five months. The mean ages for the inferior 
students were as follows: accelerated students, fourteen years and 
eleven months and control students, fifteen years and five months. 

6. The difference in chronological age for each selected pair of students 
was considered. In two cases, the difference in age between the acce- 
derated student and the control student was twenty-one months. For 
all other pairs, the difference was eighteen months or less. For 
ninety-nine pairs, the difference was no greater than one year.

CHAPTER V 


THE HETHCDS OP ACCELERATION 

The promotion survey of Grade X students in Calgar^T- and Edmonton 
showed that students had been accelerated in most cases in one of three 
ways, namely, hy the completion of two grades in one year, by skipping 
a grade, or hy entering school before the age of five and one half years. 

In addition, a few students had had double promotions. The methods of 
acceleration are summarized in Table XVIII, which gives the number and 
percentage for each category. Group I (a) is used to designate the acce¬ 
lerated students whose intelligence quotients were 120 or over and Group 
II (a) is used to designate the accelerated students whose intelligence 
quotients were below 120. See Table XVIII, page 49* 

OP mmims 

1. Approximately 48 per cent of the accelerated group had completed 
two glides in one year. Two of these students or 3 pet* cent failed 
in a later grade, 

2. Twenty-two per cent of the accelerated students had skipped a grade 
and of this group, about 3 cent failed in a subsequent grade. 

In both of the above types of acceleration, the nmber of failures 
was small but all of them were students whose intelligence quotients 
were above 120, 

3. Of the four students who had had two double promotions, two failed 
in a later grade, although both failures had intelligence quotients 


above 120.

CHAPTER VI 


THE ACADEMIC PROGRESS OP ACCELERATED STUDENTS 

Academic progress was determined by the results of the Grade IX 
final departmental examinationso The marks obtained by the accelerated 
students and the control students in Reading, Literature, Language, 

Social Studies, Mathematics, and Science were recorded from the files of 
the Calgary high schools and from the Examina.tions Branch, Letter grad¬ 
ings were given the following valuess H-5, A-4j 0-2, D-l, The 

method of comparison was similar to that employed by C, Safran in a "Study 

42 

of the Value of Kindergarten Training in the Calgary School System", 

For each of the six subjects, two tables were constn]i.ctedo The 
first table given for each subject, indicates the marks made by Group I 
(a), the superior accelerated students having intelligence quotients of 
120 or over, and the marks made by Group I (c), the corresponding control 
students. The second table for each subject shows the marks made by 
Group II (a), the normal accelerated group having intelligence quotients 
below 120, and the marks made by Group II (c), the corresponding control 
students. Tables XIX to XXX inclusive give a detailed comparison of the 
marks obtained by the four groupso 

Included in this chapter is a study of the marks obtained in the 
Grade IX final examinations by students who had been accelerated in three 
different ways, namely, by early school entrance, by skipping a grade, and

Normal accelerated students obtained the same mean grading, (3«43), 
in the Literature test as that obtained by the normal control students. 


The standard deviations were 0.72 and 0.67 respectively<> 

In the Language test, a mean grading of 4«09 with a standard devia¬ 
tion of 0.74 was obtained by the superior accelerated students as compared 
\-7ith a mean grading of 4.4 and a standard deviation of 0.69 for the control 
group. The results of the Language test showed the greatest discrepancy 
between the achievement of the accelerated students and the control students®

The normal accelerated students obtained a mean score in Science of 
3.14 with a standard deviation of 0.65; whereas the normal control students 
received a mean score of 3•35 with a standard deviation of 0.88. 

The significance of the differences between the mean scores obtained 
by accelerated students and control students in both the superior and nor¬ 
mal divisions was computed in terms of critical ratios. Table XXXI sum¬ 
marizes the data already given and includes the critical ratios for the 
differences. 

The superior control group obtained a higher average mark in all 
of the six subjects than did the superior accelerated group. The differ¬ 
ence in average marks was least significant in mathematics. The differ¬ 
ences in Literature, Social Studies, and Science were not statistically 
significant. In Reading, the difference was significant at the 5 per cent 
level. The superior control students were significantly better than the 
superior accelerated students in Language. The difference was significant 
at the 1,24 per cent level. 

None of the differences found between the mean gradings obtained by 
accelerated students whose intelligence quotients were less than 120, and 
those obtained by the corresponding control students, were statistically 
significant. In Language, the accelerated students had a slightly higher 
mean mark than did the control students. The means for marks obtained in 
Literature by the two groups were equal. The difference in Mathematics 
was very small. The greatest difference was found in Social Studies but 
this was not significant. Although in foiir subjects the control students

made better marks on the average than did accelerated students, the 
differences were not significant* 

The premise that only students who have intelligence quotients 
above 120 should be accelerated is generally accepted by educators® Con¬ 
sequently, in the consideration of the relative effects of the three 
methods of acceleration on the results obtained in the Grade IX examina¬ 
tions, only the superior groups were compared® None of the failures in 
any of the three groups was included® Those who had had double promotions 
were also excluded® 

In Table XXXII the mean age and the mean intelligence quotient 
(Terman-McNemar) is given for each group, classified according to the 
method of acceleration. The mean age of the students.who had completed 
two grades in one year was fourteen years and eight months® The mean age 
of those who had skipped a grade was fourteen years and nine months® 

Those who had entered school early were slightly younger, having a mean 
age at the time of the study of fourteen years and seven months. For 
the three groups, the mean intelligence quotients were 150®5, 130®9 and 
127,4, respectively. 

The mean grading obtained in every examination subject by the three 
groups is given in Table XXXII, The number of students in each group is 
given in parentheses under each mean. In two instances, the mark for one 
individual was missing® 

Although the students who entered school at an early age made a 
higher mean mark in Literature than those who skipped a grade, their mean

mark in .this subject was lower than that made by those who completed two 
grades in one year. In all other subjects, the mean marks of the early 
entrants were lower than those of either the students who skipped a grade 
or those who completed two grades in one year, 

SUMIARY OF RESULTS 

1. The differences in academic progress between the superior accelerated 
group and the superior control group were greater than the differences 
between the normal accelerated group an.d the normal control group# 

2, The difference in marks obtained in Reading by the superior accelera¬ 
ted group and the superior control group was significant at the 5 per 
cent level. The non-accelerated students m.ade higher marks in Reading 
than did the accelerated students# 

3# The difference in m.arks obtained in Langu.age by the superior 

accelerated group and the superior control group was significant at 
the lo24 per cent level# The difference in Language marks was in 
favor of the non-accelerated students, 

4* Students who entered school at an earlier age than that of five and 
one-half years made lower marks, in general, than either those who 
skipped a grade or those who completed two grades in one 3^ear, 

# The most significant finding seems to be that generally the differences 
in academic achievement were not statistically significant.

CHAPTER VII 


THE SOCIAL AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT 
OF ACCELERATED STUDET'ITS 

The social and personal development of pupils was studied in 
several ways* The accelerated and control students were asked, by 
questionnaire, to state the number of official positions which they had 
held during the preceding fouir years, to list the athletic teams for 
which they had played during the same period of time, to enumerate the 
social activities in which they had participated during the previous month 
and to give the ages of their four best friends* This chapter contains a 
consideration of the students’ answers to these questions* 

NUIffiER OF OFFICIAL POSITIONS HELD 

The accelerated students in the superior group, having intelligence 
quotients above 120, held fewer official positions than did the corres¬ 
ponding control students* One accelerated student did not complete the 
questionnaire* The total number of superior accelerated pupils was, there¬ 
fore, sixty-seven instead of sixty-eight* Table XXXIII shows the frequency 
distribution of official positions held by superior accelerated and control 
students* Medians as well as means were given in order to eliminate any 
distortion by a few atypical cases* The mean number of official positions 
held by superior accelerated students was 1*6 as compared vrith 2*5, the

mean number held by superior control students. The median scores for 
superior accelerated and control students were 1,4 and 2,5, respectively^ 
If the number of official positions held can be considered as a measure of 
leadership ability, the data indicate that, in this characteristic, the 
control students surpassed the accelerated students. 

The number of official positions held by normal accelerated 
students was almost as great as the number held by normal control students® 
The means for the two groups were, as shown in Table XXIV, 2,2 and 2,1 
while the medians were 2.2 and 2,3, respectively. The normal accelerated 
boys exceeded the normal control boys in the number of official positions 
held® 


MSMBERSHIP IN ATHLETIC TEAMS 

The number of athletic teams on which the accelerated girls played 
was smaller than was the number on which the control girls played, regard.^ 
less of the group, whether superior or normal® The number of athletic 
teams to which the accelerated boj'-s belonged was not appreciably smaller 
than the number to which the control boys belonged. Tables X}[XV and 
XXXVI summarize the findings regarding athletic team memberships of 
accelerated and control students, A certain degree of social maturity 
was thought necessarj^ for membership in an athletic team. Accelerated 
girls had a lower rating in this respect than did the control girls but 
accelerated boys showed no deficiency®

PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL ACTIVITIES 

Compared with the control students, the accelerated students were 
less active socially* Several students, two of whom were accelerated 
pupils and one of whom was a control pupil, stated that they had engaged 
in more than thirty social activities in the previous month* One boy gave 
his total number of social events as seventy* Because of the great weight 
of these imusual cases, the means do not give as true a picture of the 
total groups as do the medians. Table XXXVII shows that the median score 
for superior accelerated boys was 7«B whereas the median score for 
superior control boys was llo8» Superior accelerated girls were almost 
as active socially as the control girls* The medians for superior 
accelerated girls and for superior control girls were 11*3 and lla9j 
respectively* 

VJhen normal accelerated students were compared with normal control 
students, the accelerated students were once again found to have taken 
part in fewer social events* However, the discrepancy was more marked for 
girls than for boys, among students having intelligence quotients below 
120* The data indicate that, in general, the accelerated students 
participated in fewer social events* 

AGE OF FRIENDS 

In the student questionnaire, each subject was requested to indi» 
cate in years and months the age of his four best friends and to state 
whether each of these was a girl or a boy* Friends who vrere listed as

being the same age as the subject were omitted completely. In some cases, 
the answers indicated doubt regarding the exact age of friends. These 
were also disregarded. Table XXXIX summarizes the data regarding age of 
friends. 

More accelerated girls in the superior group reported that among 
their four best friends there were girls older than themselves, Similar- 
ily, accelerated boys in the superior group had more older boy friends 
than did the corresponding control boys. The same trend towards the 
choice of older companions was noticeable among the normal accelerated 
girls and boys. 


SUI#IARY OP PmiNGS 

1. Fewer official positions were held by accelerated students. 

2. Accelerated boys belonged to almost as many athletic teams as the 
control boys did. Accelerated girls did not play on as many athletic 
teams as the control girls did. 

3. Compared with the control students, accelerated students were less 
active socially. 

4. A trend towards the choice of older companions was noticeable among 
accelerated students as compared with the control students.

CHAPTER VIII 


STUDENTS* SELP-RATING OP SOCIAL AND PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT 

A rating scale of personal and social characteristics was included 
in the student questionnaire as another measure of adjustmento For each 
of the eight items in the scale, a chart shows the total number of res¬ 
ponses, and the number and percentage of responses given under each 
category* A few students did not answer all of the questions. 

Table XL shows that accelerated students rated themselves regarding 
talkativeness in much the same way as did control students although a few 
more control students classified themselves as *too talkative** 

According to Table XLI, a few more superior accelerated girls con¬ 
sidered themselves *very sensitive** In general, the self-ratings of 
accelerated students with respect to sensitivity seemed to follow the 
same trends as the self-ratings of the control students* 

In the study of flexibility, (see Table XLLi), two items may have 
been ambiguous. The heading * always ready to experiment*, preceded 
*moderately adaptable** Forty-eight per cent of the superior accelerated 
students rated themselves as *always ready to experiment’; whereas only 
28,1 per cent of the superior control students gave themselves this desig¬ 
nation* Among the normal groups, only 15 per cent of the accelerated 
students stated that they were ’always rea,dy to experiment*, as compared 
with 26 per cent of the control students* Perhaps the data indicate that 
superior accelerated students rate themselves higher in adaptability than

do the control students» The trend seems to he reversed in the case of 
the students having intelligence q.uotients under 120. 

The data in Table XLIII, which gives the self-ratings of per¬ 
sistence by accelerated and non-accelerated students, seem to suggest 
that normal accelerated students feel that they give up too easily. 
Accelerated students whose intelligence quotients were less than 120, 
rated themselves much lower in persistence than did the corresponding 
control students. A few more superior accelerated students rated them¬ 
selves as 'extremely persistent*. 

Accelerated students seem to be more self-confident than the con¬ 
trol students. Fewer accelerated students rated themselves as 'painfully 
self-conscious*, or 'timid, often embarrassed*. 

Provided that the students understood that the heading 'neutral*, 
was supposed to indicate the mid-point on the scale of emotionality, the 
data in Table XLV would indicate that fewer accelerated students (34o9 per 
cent) rated themselves as 'calm and objective', than did control students 
(41*3 per cent). 

The self-ratings of anxiety as shown in Table XLVI showed similar 
trends for accelerated and control students. 

More accelerated students than control students rated themselves 
under the heading 'enjoy being with people*. A few superior accelerated 
students indicated that they 'avoided meeting people*. More control stu¬ 
dents classified themselves in the top category as *a very good mixer*.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. In general, the responses of accelerated and control students to 
the self-rating scale showed the same trends. 

2. Accelerated students rated themselves with regard to talkativeness 
in much the same way as did the control students. 

3o Superior accelerated students tended to rate themselves slightly 
higher in adaptability, 

4, A greater degree of self-confidence was reported by accelerated 
students. 

5, Accelerated students considered themselves slightly more emotional 
than did control students. 

6o Approximately the same trends were noted in the ratings on anxiety 
for accelerated and control students, 

7, About the same degree of sensitivity was reported by accelerated and 
control students. 

8, Accelerated students rated themselves as high in friendliness as did 
the control students. 

9, Acceleration of students having intelligence quotients below 120 
seemed to result in a feeling of being easily discouraged. The data 
seemed to indicate that this was the most note-worthy trend in the 
results of the self-luting scale.

CHAPTFJR IX 


TEACHERS* ESTIMATES OF THE SOCIAL AND 
PERSONAL DEVELOP^NT OF ACCELERATED PUPILS 

Staff members at Western Canada High School in Calgary were asked 

to complete the Teachers* Questionnaire which was given in full in Chapter 
43 

III, for all accelerated and control students enrolled in their classes. 
No indication as to whether each student had been accelerated was given to 
the teachers. Although eighty-six questionnaires were filled out, a few 
of these had to be discarded because of the lack of corresponding controls. 
Of the twenty-four students rated, fifteen were rated by two teachers and 
nine were rated by one teacher. The total number of ratings considered 
was thirty-nine. 

Table XLVIII summarizes the teachers* estimates of the talkativeness 
of the students. The superior accelerated students appeared slightly more 
talkative than the superior control students. 

A-ccelerated students seem to be able to accept more criticism than 
do the control students. See Table XLIX. 

Although superior accelerated students were given ratings which 
followed the same trends as those given to superior control students in 
adaptability, the normal accelerated students were rated a little higher in 
adaptability than the normal control students. 

Teachers* ratings of the persistence of accelerated students were 
as high as their ratings of control students. 


43 Cf, ante, pp. 27-28, 





88 

A few more superior accelerated students were rated as self- 
confident when compared with superior control students as shown in 
Table LII* 

Excitability was noticed by teachers in several more instances in 
superior accelerated students than in superior control studentSo 

The number of students rated as easy-going or extremely carefree 
was slightly greater for the superior accelerated students than for the 
superior control students* There were, however, fewer normal accelera¬ 
ted students than normal control students rated in this manner* 

Accelerated students were rated by the teachers as being just as 
friendly as the control students* That no superior accelerated students 
were.rated under the heading "Avoids meeting people", is, perhaps, 
noteworthy* 

The number of teachers’ estimates of the social and personal 
development of accelerated students was too small to be statistically 
significant* The data suggested that accelerated students were probably 
as highly rated as other students in personal ^d social characteristics*

CHAPTER X 


STUDENTS’ OPINIONS OP THE EFFECTS OF 
ACCELERATION 

The opinion of students regarding the effects of acceleration were 

44 

requested at the end of the student questionnaire. The answers given by 
only the students whose intelligence quotients were above 120, were con¬ 
sidered, The distribution of these superior accelerated pupils according 
to school attended in Gr8.de X is given in Table LVI, 

Unfortunately, the questionnaire was worded in such a way that 
students who had entered school at an early age were uncertain as to 
whether their opinions were required. Those who had skipped a grade or 
who had completed two grades in one year were mentioned specifically but 
the early entrants were not. Pertinent comments were no doubt lost by 
this omission. 

Each accelerated student was asked in what ways being younger than 
his fellows had helped him in his school work. Fifteen students replied 
that beirig young-er had not helped. Twenty students made no comment. 
Thirty-three pupils thought that acceleration had helped. 

Many of the favorable comments regarding the effect of accelera¬ 
tion on school work were definitive. Five agreed with the girl who stated, 
”I will be finished school‘sooner and can get started in training for my 
profession sooner”. That being younger was helpful, "because it doesn’t 

44 The latter part of the student questionnaire was adapted from a 
questionnaire used in Crescent Heights High School in Calgary.

other comments were, "The other students look up to you if you get high 
marks", and, "They rate you high and smart". "If you are younger than 
your other school mates," said one student, "I think it gives you confi¬

ahead of his colleagues because of their lower ability". Two students

activities because of being 3 ^ounger, assumed the attitude that this 
allowed for ’’more time for studj’-,” and was, therefore, advantageous, 

■ Older students in one’s class could "help explain things to me," 
said one student, a statement which V7as corroborated bv three others. 
Several students who classified acceleration as beneficial gave no 
reasons for their answers. The comment made by nine persons in a variety 
of ways was made by one girl as follows, "You have to stud^T- harder to 
keep up with the class." 

In answer to the question, "In what ways has being younger than 
j'-our fellows hindered you in ^'■our school vrork?" twenty-one replied in the 
negative. Twenty-three students did not answer. Being younger had been 
a disadvantage, according tc the statements made by twenty-four others. 
The reason given by three students was, in the words of one of them, 

"I have to work harder for the m.arks I do get." The opposite reason, 

"I did not work as hard," mentioned by a student, was similar tc that 
given by two others. 

"It has made me discouraged at times," said a boy who skipped 
Grade and who later had honor standing in the Grade IX examinations. 
Another felt discouraged vfhen he was behind in his work. One student 
said, "The older students get impatient with me for not being able to 
keep up with them (this happened during the first and second' years after 
I took tv;o grades in one ^T-ear)," While one person who had an intelli¬ 
gence quotient of 128 and -'whose Grade IX marks in Social Studies and

Mathematics were ’’D” and ”C", respectively, had the impression that 
"More is expected of me because of the fact T skipped," another student 
thouf^ht, "They don't expect you to be so smart." The statement made by 
one student, "Marks are not, as high as they might be if T V 7 as older," 
was echoed by two others. "T cannot reason as well as more mature 
students," reported one boy whose intelligence quotient v/as 136. Six 
students inferred that valuable school work had been missed because of 
acceleration. Such remarks as the following illustrate thus viewpoint: 
"It put me behind in my math.," or "nut the same background as other 
pupiIs." 

However, a greater number of favorable comments than adverse 
criticisms were made by the students regarding the effects of accelera¬ 
tion on school work. 

That acceleration is helpful in the development of one's persona¬ 
lity was the conclusion reached by thirty-four students. Eight thought 
that there was a definite advantage in being with older students. "It 

enabled me to mix with people of a.variety of ages," was one 

comment. "T like older kids better than younger," said another. Tvrenty- 
two gave the judgment that acceleration had helped to develop a more 
mature personality. "I was forced to grow up faster," vras a typical 
response. 

Thirty stij.dents reported that being younger had been a hindrance 
in their personal development. The tendency towards growing up quickly,

mentioned above as beneficial, appeared to three students as harmful. 

’’You miso some of your childhood," commented one of these. "A per^^on’s 
personality has to grow to suit his grades in school, not his age, and 
it has to develop too fast and sometimes over their emotions," explained 
another. Self-consciousness was in the opinion of nine individuals, the 
result of acceleration. "In mixed gatherings with older students," 
stated one student, "I am sometimes rather self-conscious." Mahing 
friends seemed to be more difficult for eight students because they i-rere 
j'-ounger than their school mates. Said one 'boy, "You are younger than 
the rest and do not mix well with them." "Not enough friends or 
activities," was another Complaint, 

Although twenty-seven students made no comiLent regarding the wa;rs 
in which acceleration had helped in their social life and ti-^elve more 
gave negative responses, there were twenty-nine who replied favorably. 

"I have met many people older than myself I would not othervuse have 
known," remarked one girl, "and have many more friends, as I do not 
enjoy being with kids the same age as I am, an^'how," Nine others were 
unanimous in their agreement that being with older students was profitable 
socially. More simdlarity was found in the responses regarding the 
effects of acceleration bn one's social life than in the replies to other 
questions. Thirteen mentioned the greater number of social,events in 
which they could or did participate, because of tneir grade status. 

"You go to parties through friends," "I am able to join some clubs due to

increase in social opportunitieso 

The question, "In what ways has being ^^ounger than your fellows 
hindered you in your social life,” brought thirty-eight varied criticisms 
of acceleration. 'Two felt that the disadvantages were temporal:}^’. ’"‘Hien 
I started G-rade X,” T-rrote one boy, ”T found that I was excluded from a 
lot of social events due to my age. How, however, I am beginning to be

shared by five others. One of them* reports, "You are not invited to as 
many parties beca'’ase 3^cu are younger, ” Some clubs exclude the younger 
applicants, according to four responses. "Some difficulty in groups or 
organizations with specified age groups,” was the answer of one girl who 
had participated in tvrenty-two social activities in the previous month. 
"Most of the boys are old enough to drive cars and have more fun and meet 
more people,” said a fourteen-year old boy. One who found it hard to mahe 
friends explained,"Don’t seem to mix with others,” "Older students don’t 
seem as interested in younger students,” remarked a lad whose three 
friends were older than himself. The difference in age was resporisible, 
according to eight replies, for interfering with social success, h few

comments which expressed this feeling v:erc: "They consider yon too 
3 ^oung to go out," und "Others haven't accepted me as easily as if I v^ere 
older." "Tt has stopped me from making too much social contact with 
older people," said a boy who had been to- only one social gathering, 
apart from movies, during the previous month. Being younger was a 
source of embarrassment to a few. As one of these concluded, "Tt set 
me apart." Almost 60 per cent of the accelerated students felt that 
younger students were at a disadvantage socially. 


SUT-flARY OF FINDINGS 


1. Half of the sixty-eight superior accelerated students reported 
that being younger had helped in their school work. Only twenty- 
four said that acceleration had hindered their education, 

2. Thirty-four students stated that being with older pupils had 
helped to develop their personalities. 

3. Nhile twenty-nine persons commended acceleration as helpful in 
one's social life, a large group of thirty-eight students felt 
that a difference in age was a hindrance.

GETTER A L ST WARY OF PP-TTIRGS 

Of the 2618 stuclents who completed the survey, 111 had heen 
accelerated. The final accelerated group n-umhered 119, 

The superior accelerated group included the sixty-eight accelerated 
students who had Eerman-McEeraar intelligence quotients of 120 or over. 
The mean intelligence quotient for the superior accelerated group was 
129*8. The corresponding control group had the same mean intelligence 
quotient of 129*8, The mean intelligence score for the remaining 
fifty-one accelerated students^ designated as the normal accelerated 
studentSj vras 111.8 but the mean intelligence score for the 
corresponding control group was 114,2, 

The difference in intelligence quotient between the accelerated 
student was six points or less for sixty-two of the sixty-eight pairs 
of superior students, For six pairs, the differences in intelligence 
quotients ranged from seven points to eleven points. For forty-seven 
of the fifty-one pairs of normal pupils, the difference in intelligence 
quotient between the accelerated pupil and non-accederated pupil was 
six points or less. In four instances, the differences were eight or 
ten points. 

There was, of necessity, a difference in age between the accelerated 
students and the control students. The mean ages in years and months

were as follows: superior accelerated group, fourteen years and eight 
months; superior control group, fifteen years and five months; the 
normal accelerated group, fourteen years and eleven months; the 
normal control group, fifteen years and five months. For sixty-six 
of the sixty-eight pairs of superior students, the age difference 
between the accelerated student and the control student was eighteen 
months or less. In two instances, the difference was twenty-one 
months. For fifty of the fifty-one pairs of normal students, the age 
difference was eighteen months or less. In one case, the difference 
was twent 3 ^-one months. 

4. Significantly lower marks were made by the superior accelerated 
students, as compared with the superior control students, in the Grade 
IX final examinations in Reading and Language. The critical ratios of 
the differences were 1.96 for Reading and 2.56 for Language, General¬ 
ly, hovrever, the differences in academic achievement were not statis¬ 
tically significant. 

5. Forty-eight per cent of the final accelerated group had completed two 
grades in one year. Twenty-two per cent liad skipped a grade. Pour 
per cent had had two double promotions. Twenty-six per cent had 
entered school before the age of five and one-half years. Higher 
marks in the Grade IX final examinations were made by the superior 
students who completed two grades in one year than by those who 
entered school early,

7. On a scale of personal and social traits, the self-ratings of 
accelerated students showed, in general, the same trends as the self- 
ratings of control students® However, accelerated students rated 
themselves slightly higher than the control students did in emotiona¬ 
lity, adaptability, and self-confidence® The data also suggested that 
normal accelerated students feel that they give up too easily. 

8. Nine teachers who rated twenty-four accelerated students on a scale of

personal and social traits gave them as favorable ratings as those 
which they gave to the corresponding control students®

of forty-eight per cent of the superior accelerated students® That 
being younger was a hindrance, academically, was stated by thirty-

In the development of one’s personality, acceleration was considered 
by fifty per cent as helpful and by forty-four per cent as harmful® 
Forty-three per cent of the accelerated students thought that being 
with older students had helped them socially, but sixty per cent

their social life* 


CONCLUSIONS 

lo The self-ratings on a ^pale of personal and social traits by 
accelerated students showed the same trends as the ratings of 
control students® Therefore, accelerated students considered 
themselves reasonably well-adjusted* To teachers, accelerated 
students appeared to be just as well-developed as non-accelerated 
students both socially and personally* The preference of 
accelerated students for older companions seemed to indicate harmony 
with their classmates* 

However, accelerated students were not as active socially as 
others* They were not chosen as often to play on athletic teams or 
to be leaders* 

Many of the Grade X accelerated students were at a disadvantage 
as athletes and as leaders because of their size. Furthermore, the 
difference in age between the accelerated and non-accelerated students 
might account for the social differences* 

Probably accelerated students were just as well-developed socially 
and personally as other students of the same age* 

2* That acceleration is an advantage in one*s school work and in one’s 
personality, but a hindrance in one's social life seemed to be the

evidence in the data of the study to corroborate these statements« 

3. Generally, the differences in academic achievement betv/een accelera¬ 
ted and non-accelerated students were not statistically sigfnifleant. 

In the Grade IX Reading- Test, the difference in the marks obtained, by 
the superior accelerated students and by the superior control students 
was significant at the 5 per cent level. In the Grade IX Lan^age 
Test, the difference in the marks obtained by the superior accelerated 
students and by the superior control students was significant at the 
1,24 per cent level. It must be remembered tha.t the accelerated 
students were younger than the control students,

1. A study of the effects of acceleration on the academic progress and 
on the personal and social development of Grade XII students could 
be made. The results of the Grade XII final examinations would be a 
fairly accurate measure of scholastic achievement. The use of 
percentile ranJeings would be preferable to letter gradings, 

2, In order to allow the age factor to remain constant, a group of 
accelerated Grade XI students could be compared with non-accelerated 
Grade X students. Standardized achievement tests could be used to 
measure academic progress. Although the school environment for the 
two groups V70uld be different, such a study could indicate to a degree 
how accelerated students compare socially and personally with non- 





109 


accelerated students of the same age® 

3«> The number of accelerated students who withdraw from high school 
before graduation could be investigated, 

4* Accelerated students could be studied at the university level* 

5. Academic progress could be determined by a comparison of the marks 
obtained at the end of the freshman year by accelerated and non¬ 
accelerated students* A follow-up study could be made at the end 
of the year of graduation. The social and personal development of 
accelerated students could be compared with that of non-accelerated 
students. A scale of personal and social traits which is more 
accurate than the one used in the present study would be advisable, 

6, Parents of accelerated students could be asked for their opinions 
regarding the advantages and disadvantages of rapid promotion in 
school. This could be done at the hi^ school level and again at 
the university level*
