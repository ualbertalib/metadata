Abstract 


This thesis is an analysis of the liquified petroleum gas 
industry in Alberta, with particular emphasis placed on marketing 
considerations. An outline of existing sources and uses indicates 
that the production surplus which exists at the present time will 
continue in the future. Statistical evidence has been obtained from 
government agencies, major oil companies, and independent distributors. 
The forecasts made were tabulated from data obtained from the major 
oil companies and are believed to be the most accurate obtainable. 

The supply surplus will result in price instability for the 
product unless markets can be expanded. This is difficult because the 
structure of the industry is such that L.P.G. is considered a relatively 
unimportant by-product. This paper discusses the potential markets and 
suggests methods by which they can be exploited.

CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

The recent discoveries of oil and gas in Western Canada have 
undoubtedly resulted in an increased rate of economic development within 
the region. Although a long run market is assured, the petroleum 
industry is experiencing difficulty in selling its products because the 
cost of transportation to the more concentrated areas of the continent 
is in many cases prohibitive. The resulting surpluses have caused 
fluctuations in the rate of expansion of the industry over the short run. 
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the nature of these surpluses 
with reference to a particular group of products called liquified petroleum 
gases, and to suggest methods which may possibly result in stabilization 
of prices and efficient expansion of a consuming market. 

THE PETROLEUM RESERVOIR 

The petroleum reservoir is a space where petroleum has accumulated 
together with barriers which prevent its escape. The fluid is found in 
the pores of particular types of rock, surrounded by an impermeable cap 
which prevents upward or lateral dissipation. A reservoir is commercially 
significant when the value of the product which can be recovered exceeds 
the cost of getting it. 

Petroleum is a tronendously complex substance. Basically a mixture 
of hydrocarbons, it frequently contains carbon dioxide, nitrogen and 
hydrogen sulfide ia significant proportions. The hydrocarbons can vary 
from the very light gases to the very heavy liquids as shown in Table I. 

The products about which we are concerned are propane and butane 
and are normally produced in association with methane and ethane in a

Natural gas has no consistent composition. If it contains 
significant amounts of vaporized liquid components (propane, butane or 
pentanes) it is termed *’wet gas”, and if it contains large amounts of sulphur 
compounds it is termed ”sour gas”. The composition of gas from typical 
wells in the major fields in Alberta is shown in Table II.

The volatile materials dissolved in oil are kept in solution 
by the pressure and temperature prevailing in the reservoir* If the 
amount of gas exceeds that which can be held in solution by the tempera¬ 
ture and pressure, the excess exists as a free gas usually occupying 
the dome of the reservoir* A typical reservoir with a high gas-oil ratio 
is illustrated in Figure I* 



FIG* I. A TYPICAL RESERVOIR 

At discovery, petroleum reservoirs are under pressure, so to 
maintain production the pressure in the well must be kept lower than 
that in the reservoir so that the water or expanding gas can drive the 
liquid to the surface. As pressure is reduced, there is a tendency for 
dissolved gas to become free and it occupies the pores vacated by the oil 
and is usually swept up with the flow of oil to the surface. In reservoirs 
which are predominantly occupied by gas, recovery is usually by simple 
expansion when pressure is released. If the gas is wet, expansion may 
result in the liquification of the condensate (heavier hydrocarbons 
including propane and butane) within the formation. To recover these

heavier ends a cycling operation is often inaugurated in which the wet 
gas is extracted, distilled to remove the heavier ends, and the dry gas 
is pumped back into the formation. Thus, gas can be produced from three 
sources: gas reservoirs, gas in association with oil, or from free gas 
in oil reservoirs. 

When a field is discovered, tests are run to determine the 
composition of the petroleum in the reservoir. If gas will be the primary 
product the well is usually capped because in Alberta existing supply is in 
excess of demand. However, a gas field will be developed if particular 
circumstances warrant it: where heavy ends exist in sufficient quantity 
to make separation feasible; the quantity of recoverable gas is great 
enough; or location is particularly advantageous. At the present time a 
well will not usually be profitable if gas is the sole source of income. 
Every operator hopes that his discovery will have a large proportion of 
oil, for that is the product which is easiest to sell. 

In any event, if some product exists in sufficient quantity to be 
commercially significant, the operator petitions the Oil and Gas 
Conservation Board to go into production. Permission is normally granted 
on the proviso that the operator follows the recommendations of the Board 
regarding (1) methods of withdrawal and (2) disposal of by-products. If 
the petroleum in the reservoir is heterogeneous and the cost of separating 
the by-products is not in excess of their value, the Board usually suggests 
that separation facilities be constructed. If the cost is too high, the 
by-products are flared. The supply of LPG is therefore determined by its 
existence in coomercially significant quantities in producing oil and gas 
fields and by the rate at which these fields are developed.

The demand for gasoline and natural gas are the primary deter¬ 
minants of the rate at which development will be undertaken. Gas, being 
light and volatile, moves freely within a reservoir so that the migratory 
characteristics are particularly pronounced. In addition it cannot be 
stored economically above ground, so that production in the absence of a 
ready market can cause the loss of great amounts of a very valuable sub¬ 
stance. Nevertheless, supply is constantly increasing because most gas 
wells are discovered by people looking for oil and the production of 
casinghead gas is an inevitable incidental to oil production. Thus the 
supply of natural gas from oil fields is determined primarily by the 
demand for oil. 

A continuous, long term growth of consumption of petroleum 
products is predicted by most experts. The Royal Comnission on Canada's 
Economic Prospects, 1957, estimates that by 1980, Canadian petroleum 
production will be 8.5 times that of 1955, while natural gas production 
will increase 16 times in the same period. ^ ^ New markets will develop 
as population and mechanization increase, pipeline facilities are 
expanded, and the U.S.A. is forced to import more crude as her own 
fields become depleted. Thus, the demand for Western Canadian crude 
may be subject to short run fluctuations but a long run market is 
assured. We may conclude that the supply of LPG will increase and 
continue to be adequate, if not excessive, to meet normal demand. 
Statistical verification of this conclusion may be found in Chapter III. 

As long as petroleum production is aimed at satisfying a demand 
for which there is little competition (motor gasoline), the invasion of 

John Davis, Canadian Energy Prospects, a report preparatory 
to the Royal Commission on Canada's Economic Prospects, 1957, 7.

competitive markets by by-products and co-products has to be accepted as 
an inevitable corollary, for it fortifies the position of the primary 
product. We must therefore determine what markets our particular by¬ 
product - LPG - can obtain and maintain against competitiot\. This is 
discussed in Chapter IV.

CHAPTER II 


THE EFFECT OF CONSERVATION POLICY 

The petroleum industry in Western Canada is comprised of many 

types of firms varying from large integrated companies to small Independents 

concerned with a single operation. In addition, some firms have holdings 

in many fields whereas others have their holdings confined in a small 

area. The resulting variations in capital invested and the richness of 

reserves held cause a great difference with respect to desired policies 

regarding rate of extraction. Generally speaking, the smaller firms 

lack financial reserves and desire rapid extraction, whereas larger 

firms will limit production if future prices are expected to be advantageous. 

Without some regulatory mechanism, these differences in policy could have 

many unstabilizing effects including (1) market gluts if the representa- 
2 

tive firm did not have a sound long term financial position, (2) unnecess- 
arily high prices if an oligopoly situation developed or (3) wasteful 
withdrawal from the reservoir. Society has decided that it cannot afford 
to rely exclusively on the free play of market forces for optimum develop¬ 
ment of the industry. The result has been the establishment of government 
agencies to control all aspects of production. In Alberta, this agency 
is called the Oil and Gas Conservation Board. 

^In ’’Unstable Conditions of Competition and Monopoly in Exhaustible 
Resource Industries", Journal of Political Economy . Vol. 50, 1942 
pp. 739, sea .. W.J. Pabst analysed the American Anthracite coal 
industry and concluded that changes in expectations as to future prices 
have profound effect on the structure (degree of monopoly) of a 
resource industry. When expectations become pessimistic, the value 
of unexploited reserves falls accordingly. However, this drop in 
value does not affect the independent as much because he is not afraid 
of spoiling the market by expanding operations. As a result, when 
available supply exceeds effective demand the independent gains a 
larger percentage share of the market.

Three of the major purposes of the Conservation Board are: 

(1) prevention of sub-surface wastes, (2) protection of property rights, 
and (3) adjusting supply to effective demand to minimize above ground 
wastes. 

Unrestricted production causes premature dissipation of the 
expulsive forces within a reservoir with the result that too much oil 
which cannot be recovered is left behind. If gas in association supplies 
the drive then pressure usually gives out early in the life of the well, 
and there is scope for secondary recovery methods, whereas if gas caps 
supply the pressure, it is easier to maintain. There are several indices 
of efficiency including (1) rate of drop in pressure, (2) excess of 
gas-oil ratio in excess of the amount of gas in association, (3) if water 
production is abnormally high it indicates irregular advance on the 

o 

interface*^ so that pockets of oil are formed which are difficult to 

recover. 

Because pools are owned by many producers, regulation is necessary 
to protect each against practices of neighbors which cause sub-surface 
drainage to adjacent wells. To counteract migration, operators may be 
inclined to drill offset wells too close to proven wells. As this may 
decrease pressure and thus affect ultimate recovery, restriction is 
necessary. 

Price stability is essential to the industry for it permits long 

term planning and minimizes risks. The assurance of a long term market 

results in the orderly expansion of communities located in producing areas.

Because of the scarcity of volume markets for crude oil, the Board attempts 
to restrict supply to the demand existing at a price which is expected 
to yield normal profits. 

Adherence to the "rule of capture" usually results in alternate 

periods of overproduction and low prices. These fluctuations would be 

4 

harmful to the welfare of the region and the industry , In an effort 
to be equitable to all producers, yet still provide incentive for further 
exploration and drilling even though present demand may not seem to 
warrant it, the Board has developed a system of "Prorationing". At 
discovery each well is assigned a maximum permissible rate (MPR) based 
on engineering estimates of the most efficient rates of production for 
the reservoir in question. The Board then estimates purchasers' require¬ 
ments and if it is found that the expected demand Is less than the 
aggregate MPR of all wells in the province, the output is rationed on a 
two-part system. Each producing well is assigned an "economic allowable" 
which is based primarily on the depth of the well and which is designed 
to insure that each well will be able to sell enough oil to recover the 
costs of drilling, maintenance, etc. If the total economic allowables 
for all wells is not enough to satisfy the existing demand, the balance 
is assigned on the basis of reserves. This, of course, allows the 
owners of richer wells to sell more than the well owners possessing 
smaller reserves. This policy Is accompanied by restrictions concerning

well spacing so that producers are prohibited from sinking additional 
wells simply to Increase their allowables. 

A custom which is common In the United States and subject to 
Increasing Interest and Investigation In Canada Is the practice of 
unitization, or co-operative exploration and development of pools under 
cotnnon management. It Is applicable In two situations: 

1. To facilitate recovery procedures designed to 
Increase the ultimate recovery, which procedures 
either could not be carried out individually 
because of the cost involved, or if carried out 
individually would disturb the ownership rights of 
the common pool. Included in these procedures are 
secondary recovery and artificial maintenance. 

2. If demand falls short of available supply, a unitized 

field can shut in marginal wells and by concentrating 

production, duplication will be minimized so that the 

total costs are reduced but the total marketable out- 
6 

put is maintained. 

Although unitization is the theoretical answer to many of the 
industry's problems, it is hard to put into practice because of the 
difficulty of obtaining the approval of all operators. 

There is conflict among theorists as to whether conservation 
results in a higher or lower long term price for the product. However, 
it is generally agreed that it is in the best interests of society that

prices be not unduly depressed by overproduction to the point where it 
no longer pays to make the fullest use of efficient methods compatible 
with the current state of the arts and of scientific knowledge. 

Conservation as practiced by the Board is primarily concerned 
with the equating of supply and effective demand for the major products - 
oil and natural gas. However, it does not follow that by-products, 
such as LPG, will benefit from this stabilization. Because the composition 
varies greatly from field to field, it would be impossible to regulate 
the output of all products. LPG is therefore considered as a residue, 
and left to fend for itself under conditions of unrestricted competition. 

Price Determination 

A high recovery of petroleum resources is imperative because 

the cost of exploration and development constitute the bulk of total 

\ 

costs of crude oil and its by-products. There remains the problem of 
determining how these direct development costs are apportioned to the 
various products in fixing relative wellhead prices. 

The supply of crude oil is determined by the demand for the 
primary product - gasoline. Its demand is,in turn, derived from the 
demand for the services which it provides. These services are constantly 
increasing as population rises and our society becomes more mechanized. 
Within normal limits the market demand for gasoline is inelastic for 
the following reasons; (1) there is little scope for substitution 
(2) consumption cannot be postponed (3) the market is composed of a large 
number of small volume users so that fuel costs are relatively insigni¬ 
ficant. Where substitution is possible it is usually limited to products

from the same Industry and even then the specialized high priced durable 
equipment makes it difficult. The result is that the expected well 
head price of crude Is high enough to absorb all the normal costs of 
exploration and development. 

The supply of natural gas varies with the demand for oil. In 
Alberta, local demand (primarily for space heating) Is inadequate to 
absorb potential output, and transmission to distant markets Is pro¬ 
hibited by high pipeline costs. The result of this excess supply is 
that prices are very low and are not a true reflection of its calorific 
value in relation to other fuels even though higher market prices would 
seem possible because of its convenience. Supply is not usually aggravated 
by the discovery of a gas field for the new wells may be capped. However, 
when gas is found in association with oil it must be produced as a by¬ 
product and as such takes on typically unorthodox market characteristics. 

The' temptation to sell gas at low prices is fostered by conservation 
rules which dictate that gas which is produced must be marketed if 
it can be done without loss. If an operator must gather the gas or 
shut-in the well,he is likely to accept a very low price for gas. 

What effect does the price of crude oil and natural gas have 
on the well head price of LPG? As crude prices normally absorb the cost 
of exploration and development, the operator will be willing to sell 
LPG at any price which is in excess of the cost of separating and processing. 
It is prevented frcxn rising above this minimum by two factors: (1) an 
almost perfectly elastic supply and (2) whereas many of the heavier products 
have a compl^sentary relationship with the major product^ LPG is competitive, 
not only with other petroleum products, but with almost all fuels.

CHAPTER III 

EXISTING SOURCES AND USES OF L.P.G. IN WESTERN CANADA 

Liquified petroleum gas is a hydrocarbon gas which can be 
easily liquified at normal temperatures by moderate pressure. Consequently, 
it can be stored or transported as a liquid and used when needed as a gas. 

It consists of propane or butane or mixtures of the two. The products 
can be obtained naturally from petroleum reservoirs or as a by-product 
from refineries.

LPG is extracted from natural gas in absorption plants. These consist 
of two towers, in the first of which the heavier components including 
propane and butane are absorbed by a lean oil and the dry gas goes off. 
In the second tower, the LPG is separated from the oil by fractional 
distillation. When produced at refineries it is the result of the 
distillation of crude oil.

Table W (see Appendix A), gives the estimated production 
and sales of propane in 1957. Alberta produces 77% of the Western 
Canadian output. The figures only show the output of gas plants as 
the product produced by Alberta's refineries is not marketed, but is 
used in the refineries. In the other three provinces the refineries 
supply the market as the natural gas fields are not sufficiently 
developed to warrant gas absorption plants. The output of 1,442,000 
barrels was not up to original expectations. Technical difficulties at 
Taylor Flats, B.C., and Stettler, and reduction of crude allowables 
during October, November and December resulted in this shortage. 

Total sales of domestic production were 1,050,000 barrels with 
imports from the U.S.A. amounting to 211,000 barrels. These imports 
were made necessary by the combination of two factors: ( 1 ) lack of 
storage facilities, and (2) the highly seasonal demand. As production 
is relatively constant all year round, there was deficiency in the 
winter months. As construction of additional storage space is being 
planned, it is felt that imports will not be necessary in the future. 

It will be noted from Column 3, that Alberta supplies considerable 
quantities of propane for Saskatchewan and British Columbia. 

Table V (Appendix A) gives 1957 butane production. All the 
butane produced was refined in Alberta by Gas Conservation Plants except 
14,000 barrels made available by Co-op. Refineries in Saskatoon and 
112,000 barrels by Imperial Oil Limited, Calgary. The product which was 
not sold was used as boiler fuel. 

The value of the total Western Canada output in 1957 was in 
excess of $4,000,000. This represents considerable progress for an

industry which started only 10 years ago. Figure II shows Alberta's 
output for the period 1948 - 1957, and it can be observed that the 
industry has developed at a relatively steady rate. Thus 1957 can be 
considered a representative year. Table VI (Appendix A) shows the 
disposition of the output. About 80% of total output of propane is 
made available to the market, with the balance being lost, flared or 
used by the producing company. Because of an inadequate market in 
1957, 10% of the total output was stored underground. The propane sales 
figure of 789,000 barrels is considerably below the figure of 933,000 
barrels estimated by the Conservation Board, The discrepancy is 
accounted for by the fact that the Board includes inter-departmental 
transfers within the same company as "sales", whereas these figures do not. 

In the case of butane, 77% of the total output was made avail¬ 
able with 19% of the total being stored. 

Table VII (Appendix A) gives a breakdown of the end use of 
the production of Alberta in 1957. Figures for the other provinces are 
not included but it is felt that Alberta's figures are representative 
as this province is by far fhe major producer. 

With these production and sales figures as a basis, we proceed to 
a discussion of the industry as it exists at the present time. 

The original decision to construct a gas absorption plant is 
made by the Conservation Board. When a field is developed, tests are 
run to determine the quantity of gas available, as well as an analysis 
of the components. If the gas is wet enough and if the gas aibwables 
are expected to be sufficient to make a gas absorption plant economically 





17 


feasible, the fact is suggested to the owning company. In making their 
decision the Board considers the market in relation to the existing 
supply, but their primary concern is to prevent the product from being 
wasted. 

Once the plant is constructed and output commences, the next 
problem is to get the product to the market. There are three possible 
methods: pipeline, tank car, or tank truck. In Alberta, the only LPG 
pipeline is from Devon to Edmonton. The rest of the product is delivered 
by rail or truck. Because of the shortage of railway tank cars, and 
because of the high initial cost Involved in providing railroad 
facilities for oil fields, many of which are in rural areas, most of 
the product is moved by tank truck. If the product is sold to large 
users it is delivered at a stipulated price according to long term 
contracts. Thus the producer has a reasonably accurate estimate of what 
demand will be. However, when the purchasers are the smaller distributors 
who sell to the rural market for domestic consumption, they buy the 
product as they need it and daily demand is difficult to estimate. Also, 
output cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy, as it depends on 
gas allowables and they are subject to change. Thus it can be seen that 
storage facilities are needed at the gas plants. 

In October, 1956, the Conservation Board suggested to the LPG 
Association that additional storage facilities should be constructed to 
ensure adequate supplies of propane to Alberta consumers in the winter 
months. This has not been followed up and storage facilities are still 
unsatisfactory. Because of the highly seasonal demand, more storage 
facilities are essential for satisfactory development.of the industry as

insufficient storage invariably leads to wasteful flaring in off-peak 
periods. Experienced producers suggest a minimum storage of seven times 
daily capacity at the producer level, and two weeks peak winter demand 
at the distributor level. Table VIII (Appendix A) gives the storage 
capacity in Western Canada and Goliad is the only major producer in 
Alberta which has more than adequate storage facilities. This is probably 
a result of the Interest shown in using LPG for miscible flood operations 
in the Pembina field. A plan for using natural underground reservoirs 
in the Hardisty district is also under consideration. 

The largest propane producer in Western Canada is Imperial Oil 
Limited, which is responsible for 33% of the total sales. The next 
largest are Texaco (20%), B.A, (12%), and Royalite (10%). There are 
seven producing canpanies, but because of location factors, and high 
costs of transportation, the competition is not severe except^ the 
Edmonton area. 

Imperial On Limited is the largest producer of butane and their 
market position is further enhanced by their contracts with Canadian 
Chemical Limited, which is the largest consumer. As a result, they control 

64% of the market. 

The largest user of propane is the rural domestic market. The 
farms use propane for spot heating, refrigerators, tractors, space heating 
and a variety of other uses. This market is serviced by a variety of 
distributors of which Canadian Propane Limited is by far the largest. 

These distributors have a field staff which sells the specialized equip¬ 
ment necessary and a delivery system which supplies the farms regularly. 

The product is delivered in a liquified form in pressurized tanks. Canadian

Propane Limited and its associated company, Sturdie Propane Limited, 
distributed approximately 707* of the propane marketed in Alberta and 
B.C. In 1957, C.P.L. sold over 12,000,000 gallons through its 20 
branches. The largest of the other distributors are Mutual Propane 
(Edmonton), Rockages (B.C. interior), and Propane Engineering (Calgary). 
These distributors compete with each other in the more concentrated areas, 
but most of the smaller towns only lave one supplier. Competition does 
not seem to take the form of price competition, but is restricted to sales 
and servicing programs. 

Canadian Chemical Limited uses considerable quantities of butane 
and propane and purchases it as a mixture as well as in the purified form. 
In this market, price competition determines the supplier, and I.O.L. has 
up until now controlled this area because their refinery has the largest 
capacity and thus has had a production cost advantage over other suppliers. 
As C.C.L. will accept mixtures, propane and butane from field plants must 
compete with refinery gases. Of the total market 65% is supplied by field 
plants and 35% by refinery gases. This is a good outlet for seasonal 
surpluses. In 1957, I.O.L. sold 1.5 million gallons of propane and 2.5 
million gallons of butane at reduced prices during the summer months. 

The LPG surpluses of the Pembina field have found use as a 
miscible flood gas. However, this use is restricted to fields which 
are experiencing difficulty in obtaining satisfactory pressure, and this 
is a rather uncommon occurrence. 

Butane is also used at the Calgary refinery and’’reformed" to 
obtain the isobutane required in the alkylation process. It is also 
shipped by tank car from Calgary to the Pacific Coast for use as a peak

shaving gas in natural gas distribution systems. Tables IX, X and XI 
(Appendix A) are forecasts of production and markets for Western Canada 
for the period 1958 - 1961. The production figures are an estimate of 
what would be available under normal conditions, if a market existed. 

Table IX (Appendix A) shows that the amount available greatly exceeds 
demand, so that actual output will be far short of potential. 

Conservatively it is estimated that Western Canada will produce 
65 million gallons of propane in 1958. As the dcmiestic market demand 
has a ratio of 2.1 for winter and summer, the output of 65 million will 
mean that supply and demand will be equal in the winter months (33 million 
gallons) and there will be a 15 milion gallon surplus in the summer months. 

Actual production of butane will approximate 40 million gallons 
which should be adequate to cover the estimated demand of 31 million 
gallons. Butane demand is less seasonal than propane because of the 
relatively steady demand of Canadian Chemical. 

Demand figures are based on a conservative 10% increase per 
year. This figure may be arbitrary but it is expected to be reasonably 
realistic. In actual fact it is not too important because even at a 
20% yearly increase there would be a considerable surplus of supply. 

Thus the state of the industry may be summarized as follows; 

Output is controlled by the major oil companies. The quantity 
of output is dependent on the demand for oil and natural gas. There 
is an area of conflict between the companies and the government. The 
companies do not wish to invest in the extracting and distribution 
facilities unless it returns a normal profit, and if LPG output increases 
at its anticipated rate, supply will exceed demand to such an extent that

prices will be depressed to the point where this profit is unattainable. 

On the other hand, the Conservation Board does not want the product 
wasted and so demands that output facilities be expanded in spite of 
the fact that storage is feasibh only for short periods. 

The major buyers of propane are the distributors for rural 
consumption. There is one firm, Canadian Propane Limited, which dominates 
the industry, but the group as a whole is not progressive. They let the 
oil companies bear the risk and buy the product as they require it, thus 
minimizing their own costs. Their efforts are restricted to routine 
selling and distribution, and little technical or market research is 
undertaken. Probably the ease of entry acts as a deterrent to existing 
companies to effect im provement. Other purchasers of propane, and all 
butane buyers, obtain the product directly from the producing conpanies 
for their own particular needs. Each contract is negotiated separately 
and there does not appear to be any conflict between distributors and 
direct purchasers. 

The most immediate problem confronting the industry is to bridge 
the gap between demand and available supply. New or expanded uses must 
be discovered - the alternative is waste. Were it not for this uncontrollable 
production surplus, the industry could be described as a normal, young 
industry experiencing the usual transitional difficulties » in this 
particular case the most important of these shortcomings are (1) lack of 
storage facilities, (2) fear of financing research, and (3) absence of 
industry wide coordination. 

It can therefore be concluded that supply will not be the limiting 
factor in the expansion of the industry. The areas which will require the 
most attention are distribution and marketing.

CHAPTER IV 
POTENTIAL MARKETS 

A. PETRO-CHEMICALS 

Petroleum and natural gas have been available in quantity In 
North America for a century, but they did not become sources of 
chemicals until recently. The delay was due to the absence of demand 
for chemical products and lack of the engineering knowledge required to 
build the facilities which could separate individual hydrocarbons as 
pure compounds from complex mixtures. 

The desire to make better motor gasoline resulted in the realiza- 
tion of the possibilities of using petroleum products as raw materials 
for a chemical industry. The petroleum industry developed the methods 
of analysis, the techniques of separating individual hydrocarbons on 
a large scale, and many of the chemical processes on which the petrochemical 
industry now depends. 

The following is an outline of the sources and methods of producing 
the basic hydrocarbon raw material for the petrochemical industry. 

A. Olefins: The important olefins are ethylene, propylene, butylenes, 
butadiene, isoprene and acetylene. These products do not exist in either 
petroleum or natural gas so must be manufactured. 

1. Ethylene is one of the major building blocks of the petro¬ 
chemical industry and is the basis of many products including 
synthetic fabrics and antifreeze. Natural gas is the best raw 
material (cracking ethane and propane) providing the price is 
reasonable. However, as the geographic relationship of 
source to the market has such a large bearing on the price.

other raw material may be more economical. Table XII 
shows the feed stock in the U.S. and Canada. 

In 1955, the U.S.A. consumed 3 billion lbs. of 
ethylene, while the Canadian production was 3/4 million 
lbs. A steam cracker which will go into production this 
year (owned by I.O.L. at Sarnla)wlll double Canada's 
ethylene production using naptha and gas oil as a feed 
stock.

2. Propylene and Butylene are produced in normal refinery 
cracking operations. Propylene is an important raw material 
for polymer gasoline, acetomand detergents. Isobutylene 

is an important constituent of synthetic rubber, whereas 
n-butylene is an important source of butadiene and components 
for high octane gasoline. 

3. Butadiene is required in great quantities for the manufacture 
of. nylon, resins and synthetic rubber. The most widely used 
source is the conversion of normal butylene. Where butylene

is in short supply, butane may be converted. 

Butadiene is made in Canada from Butylene in Sarnia 
by the Polymer Corporation, and will be made from naptha 
at I.O.L.*s new Sarnia refinery. All the butylene is 
obtained from I.O.L. Sarnia. 

4. Acetylene is also a versatile "building block" and is 
used for plastics, synthetic rubber and solvents. Its 
most common source is coal and limestone. A process has 
recently been developed by which ethane and propane can 
be,converted. It is not as yet developed sufficiently to 
determine its commercial significance. 

B. Parttifins : 

Any one of the paraffin series can be converted directly to 
petrochemicals. Propane and butane can be partially oxidized to form 
mixtures of aliphatic chemicals (alcohols, acids, ketones, etc.) and this 
is done at Canadian Chemicals Limited, Edmonton, The feed stock is 
obtained from natural gas and refinery LPG gases. The following products 
are obtained; formaldehyde, acetaldhyde, acetone, methyl alcohol and 
acetic acid. Acetic acid is of primary importance in the manufacture of 
cellulose acetate, and rayon-type fibres, 

C. Polyethylene 

Polyethylene is produced by C.I.L., Edmonton. The feed stock is 
ethane obtained from I.O.L.'s Leduc gas conservation plant. 

Thus it can be seen that propane and butane have great theoretical 
possibilities as a feed stock for the petrochemical industry. However,

such a variety of methods have been developed that a producing plant has 
the choice of a number of raw materials to produce the same end product. 

As fixed costs are comparable regardless of the method used, the choice 
is usually made on a basis of the raw material costs rather than the 
simplest chemistry. Naturally, raw material costs depend on the location 
of the industry. 

To be more specific, the degree to which the propane and butane 
reserves of Western Canada will be used for petrochemicals, will depend 
on the location of that industry. The major factor in determining 
location is the relative cost of transportation of raw materials and 
finished goods. If the amount of raw material necessary to produce a 
unit amount of finished goods is large, the industry will tend to locate 
near the source of supply. This will also be the case when the product 
has a high unit value so that transportation costs form a small percentage 
of the total selling costs. Unfortunately, neither of these factors are 
generdly true in the petrochemical industry, except in limited instances 
(i.e. polyethylene). Thus it can be concluded that the industry will 
locate close to the market, so that no matter how much LPG is available 
in Alberta, it is not likely to be processed for petrochemicals at points 
far distant from use. This can be verified by reference to Tables XIII, 

XIV and XV. LPG cannot be shipped to Eastern Canada and compete price- 
wise with refinery off gases. Also, in most cases it is too costly to 
ship the finished goods to the more concentrated markets. 

Another important factor determining location is the high fixed 
cost which is usually necessary. Consequently, a petrochemical

plant is not normally feasible unless a large market for the output is 
assured. These markets do not exist in Western Canada because of the 
small population. As a result, an industry will be situated in densely 
populated areas. The desire to seek proximity to related chemical 
industries (to take advantage of external economies) leads to a further 
centralization. 

There are other factors which deter expansion of the industry 
in Alberta: (1) shortage of trained technicians, (2) relatively high 
construction costs, (3) high freight rates, (4) small population, for 
both consumption and labor market, (5) U.S. protective tariffs which 
are as high as 407c on chemicals. 

Thus we must conclude that the Canadian petrochemical industry 
will center in the East. Western LPG must therefore compete with refin¬ 
ery gases, something it cannot do. Freight rates subsidization is out 
of the question as the oil industry generally is considered the least 
needy, or most healthy, segment of the Western Canadian industrial 
econony. Thus, most petrochemical ventures in Alberta will involve a 
’’net freight penalty.” 

There are several conditions which could make the picture 
more attractive from an Alberta standpoint: 

1. A general growth in Western Canadian markets or export 
markets which could be reached through Western Canadian 
ports. 

2. Development of products which require a higher quantity 
of hydrocarbons per pound of finished goods.

3. Special situationswhere raw material is avail¬ 
able at minimum cost as a by-product of existing 
operations. 

4. The availability of American markets by tariff 
reduction. 

5. Shortages developing in Eastern Canadian markets. 

This is the reason why Polymer considered construc¬ 
tion of a butadiene plant in Red Deer. Butylene 
became scarce in the East, so the company investi¬ 
gated the possibilities of processing Alberta butane. 

The plan was shelved when it was discovered that, to be 
comparable cost-wise with the eastern product they 
would have had to obtain butane at IC per wellhead 
price. The oil companies could not produce butane 

for this amount. However, there are possibilities that 
are similar, so more attractive situations may occur 
in the future. 

A brief look at the American situation may give some idea of 
what could occur. The industry is much further developed because the 
oil resources were discovered earlier and because of the presence of 
a much larger market. As a result, Canada is 10 years behind the 
U.S. in per capita consumption of petrochemicals. Also the American 
industry is much more efficient because of the resultant economies 
to scale. The ratio of investment to value of output is 1:1 in the

U.S. whereas it is approximately 2:1 in Canada. 

The more concentrated market makes the situation for LPG 
much more attractive in the U.S. The demand for natural gas exceeds 
the supply so that it is relatively expensive. On the Gulf Coast, 
where the petrochemical industry is centered, natural gas prices 
rose from 5C per M.C.F. to 13c per M.C.F. in 1957. Consequently, 
many chemical producers are switching to LPG as a raw material. The 
consulting firm of “Greene and Widgery'* predicts that by 1960 some 56% 
of the ethylene manufactured on the Gulf Coast will be based on a 
pyrolysis of propane and butane. This will require a supply of 50,000 
barrels a day of propane and butane. However, this situation is not 
likely to occur in Alberta as natural gas prices are not expected to 
increase too much for some years to come. 

In conclusion, Alberta offers an impressive abundance of raw 
materials and lower power rates. Ontario and Quebec claim proximity 
to markets, less rigorous climate and available refinery off-gases, and 
these advantages outweigh those of Alberta. Thus the rapid expansion 
of the petrochemical industry in Alberta cannot be foreseen.

B. GASOLINE BLENDING 

Gasoline blending is simple but determination of how much 
of each component to include in the blend is far from simple. 

Selection of the components and decisions as to their proportions 
in a blend are the most complex, continuing problems in a refinery. 

For many years butane and isobutane were used in considerable quantity. 
However, of late they have been replaced by other components, (mostly 
light naptha) which are the natural by-products of refining and have 
higher octane ratings. The continual increase in the octane number 
of motor gasolines has been the chief reason for changing composition. 
Thus butanes have become victims of the "octane race" and are no 
longer desirable as they have a low octane number, relative to other 
additives. Their use has been restricted to improving vapor pressures 
of gasoline, particularly in cold climates. 

In addition, improved technology has resulted in the increasing 
ability of most refineries to produce large amounts of light ends. 

This is verified by the fact that refinery LPG production increased 
19% from 1955 to 1956 to 52 million barrels, while crude production 
increased only 6.4%. Thus refineries in the U.S. have become self- 
sufficient in normal butane. In 1956, refineries produced 14.6 million 
barrels, while the total used for blending was only 17 million barrels. 

Thus, as the low grade gasoline market has fallen, the market 
for light ends for use in blending has fallen. There are, however, some

possibilities which could result in the increased demand for LPG 
for this market, 

1. If the trend to smaller cars continues, there will 
be an increased market for low octane, high volatile 
fuels. 

2. Improved engine design with more extensive use of 
fuel injection rather than carburetion, 

3. Possibility of a tight crude supply by 1970. 

Thus, it is expected that over the short run, butanes used for motor 
gasoline will be restricted to specialized fuels. Iso-butane is an 
important constituent of aviation fuel. Even in these limited markets^ 
butanes extracted from natural gas will have to compete with refinery 
off-gases.

C. PEAK SHAVING IN NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS 

"Peak Shaving" is a term used to describe the methods used 
by natural gas distribution systems to supply the market when demand 
is at its highest. As the basic considerations are cost and efficiency 
the fundamental idea is to minimize the size of the gas generating 
facilities and still be able to supply any possible demands on the 
system. Generally the public utility companies have three alternatives 
(1) gas storage facilities, (2) propane-air sendout plants, or 
(3) oil reforming units. 

The economics of peak shaving depend on the rate system and 
the load curve of the system. Most distributors use a two-part rate 
system, with a demand charge and a commodity charge. When a customer 
even momentarily demands a specific quantity of gas he is asking that 
a portion of the transmission system be reserved for his use. It is 
logical that he should payfor this privilege, regardless of how much 
total gas he uses. Thus the two-part rate is an attempt to separate 
the fixed costs of transmission from the operating costs of supplying 
the gas. Peak shaving methods depend on these rates, for it would 
be of no value for a strict commodity rate basis of billing. 

Output policy also depends on the load curve, as a system with 
a 100% load factor gains nothing from peak shaving, whereas a system 
which has a stable demand except for a few days with very high

demand can spend substantial amounts to reduce this peak demand rather 
than build the whole system to supply the capacity needed for only 
a few days. Space heating is the principal contributor to a fluctuating 
load^and variable weather conditions are the controlling cause. 

From the weather pattern, a load variation curve can be plotted:

The area under the load duration curves represents the total amount 
demanded. 

The problem is to find the method of supplying the peak gas 
at the lowest possible cost. The alternatives are (1) to obtain a 
manufactured gas which is cheaper than the cost of expanding the 
system to meet peakrequirements, or (2) to build storage facilities 
for natural gas to use in peak periods. If (1) is found to be 
the cheaper, the additional problem of determining the most economical 
base load capacity must also be solved. This is an "alternative 
choice" problem which can be solved on a straight costing basis 
considering such factors as; capacity of existing equipment, capital 
costs of expansion, depreciation and maintenance expense, etc. There 
are two possible sources of peak shaving fuel: ( 1 ) reforming oil 
or (2) propane. In reforming, the liquid fuel is cracked thermally 
or catalytically into hydrocarbons of lower molecular weight. The 
investment cost for such a plant is always higher than the costs 
of a propane air plant. Thus propane is the best fuel, other than 
natural gas, for peak shaving. We now turn to a discussion of the 
possibilities and limitations of a propane-air plant. 

In a natural gas system, propane has one disadvantage » 
non-interchangeability. To burn propane successfully on a natural 

gas range, it must be mixed with air. Even then it behaves differently 
from methane, and thus cannot be substituted 100%^due to the range 
of appliance adjustments. The degree of substitution depends on the

B.T.U. content of the propane air mixture and ;Ls shown in Figure VI, 

FIGURE VI, 



The cost of propane-air plants may be divided into two parts - 
the storage facilities and the compressor and mixing plant. Storage 
costs range from 60d to 90d per gallon of capacity, if tanks are 
used. On the basis of equivalent 1000 B.T.U. gas, this means a cost 
of $6,50 to $9.50 per M.C.F. Storage in manually excavated caves 
has been studied and indications are that it would be economical 
for anything over 250,000 gallon capacity, and costs range from 
20d to 60d per gallon of propane stored. In some areas, salt caverns 
are available and costs could be as low as 4.5d per gallon of capacity

if in excess of 2,000,000 gallons. Another possibility is the use 
of depleted gas reservoirs, where costs range from 15d to 25d per 
M.C.F. capacity. The cost of compressors and mixing plants can be 
reduced to a unit cost per brake horsepower when air must be 
compressed. This figure ranges from $300 to $600. The cost of 
L.N.G. is less than propane, but the storage costs are about twice 
as high. 

Figure VII shows the results of research conducted by the 
Stone and Webster Engineering Corporation to determine the relative 
costs of peak shaving gas in several representative American markets. 
The figure of 11.7d per gallon cost of propane is realistic for the 
markets considered. From this it can be seen that Tacoma cannot 
use propane for peak shaving, whereas it is a possibility in Boston 
or San Francisco. The curve labeled “natural formationV is the cost 
of storing natural gas in a depleted reservoir. It is quite evident, 
that such a formation, if it can be found, provides the most 
economical storage. 

The general conclusion is that propane or liquified natural 
gas is economical only when relatively small amounts are required for 
peak shaving, with underground storage of natural gas indicated for 
the large operation. The choice between liquified natural gas and 
propane, depends to a considerable extenttpon the price of propane. 

In the overall picture there are several other points worthy 
of consideration in determining the choice of methods. Firstly, the

rate of load growth is important. If the load is growing rapidly, 
there is more use for peak fuel because the peaks become greater 
each year. Also,estimates of future fuel costs and reserves and 
availability of storage reservoirs must be considered. An attempt 
to apply this theory to the Western Canadian situation follows. 

Recently, Canadian Western Natural Gas Co., of Calgary, 
investigated the possibility of using propane for peak shaving. 

At present the company’s major source of natural gas is the Jumping 
Pound field owned mainly by Shell Oil. As this is a sour gas, the 
company had to guarantee a 70% load factor to induce Shell to 
construct the relatively expensive scrubbing equipment necessary. 

The other sources are Turner Valley and Bow Island, with the latter 
also being used for storage during slack seasons. In a recent 
survey of future requirements it became apparent that additional 
quantities of fuel for peak periods would be required. The company 
investigated three possibilities: 

(1) Draw from Alberta Gas Trunkline 

(2) Draw from the Carbon field, north of Calgary 

(3) Use of L.P.G. 

Because of the highly seasonal demand^ caused by temperature 
extremes, the quantities of fuel needed for peak shaving are relatively 
large. Thus the actual cost of the fuel becomes the most important 
consideration rather than the amount of capital necessary to provide

facilities. Figure VIII shows that the price of propane greatly 
exceeds that of natural gas when the two are compared on a B.T.U. 
basis. Even if it is realized that in the future, the price of 
LPG in comparison to gas is liable to swing in the favour of the 
former, the discrepancy is too great to make propane competitive. 

This, coupled with the fact that the capital investment required to 
bring the product to market is less for gas than it is for propane, 
is sufficient reason for not giving any more than passing attention 
to the possibilities for using LPG. As the size of the market 
grows, even though the relative amounts necessary for peaking remain 
constant, the actual quantities increase so that the peak shaving 
operation is going to require even a greater volume of fuel than at 
present. Thus the long term picture also seems to exclude the 
possibilities of using LPG. 

Consequently the company decided to use natural gas for peak 
loads, with the Carbon field as the source. The Trunk Line possibil¬ 
ity was ruled out because the price would be too high as (1) suppliers 
would be required to build large stand-by storage facilities and 
(2) the capacity of the Bow Island pipeline would have to be 
increased. It would be even more difficult for propane to enter 
the picture in Edmonton. The Viking-Kinsella field, long the base 
load field, is now insufficient to supply the growing demand and 
will be replaced by Pembina. However, Viking-Kinsella has ideal 
storage facilities so will become the source of peaking gas.

Propane is also choked out of the smaller municipalities, 
in which it should be theoretically adaptable, by the simple fact 
that the availability of propane can only be accompanied by the 
co-existence of a large supply of natural gas, which is always much 
cheaper. 

An analysis of the Edmonton market was made to determine 
whether there was any possibility of using LPG on a continuous 
basis, i.e. inject a fixed quantity of propane-air mix into the system 
all year round. In Edmonton, the retail price of gas varies from 
34<? per M.C.F. for domestic consumption to 13$ per M.C.F. for large 
industrial users (such as the Imperial Oil Refinery). The company 
anticipates a 457o rate increase in 1959, with 68% of this increase being 
attributable to increases in the cost of natural gas. The coiipany 
pays anyx^here from 2$ per M.C.F. in Viking to 13$ in newly negotiated 
contracts for Pembina gas. 

An estimate of future costs of gas was made, using the 
proposed contract between Northwestern Utilities and Alberta Southern 
as a basis. Alberta Southern is seeking an export permit, which, if 
granted, will result in their purchasing the transmission line from 
Pembina to Edmonton from Northwestern Utilities and supplying Edmonton*s 
requirements free of transportation costs and exporting the surplus. 

On the basis of the proposed contract between the companies, the 
following is an estimate of future gas prices. In the opinion of the 
officials of the company, this represents a conservative picture of 
future costs of natural gas:

A reliable oil company executive estimates that the minimum price at 
which propane could be sold without sustaining a considerable loss is 
2^-3<: per gallon. Thus, the cost of production of propane is too high 
for a gas utility company to »i economically. 

If, however, the problem is approached from the standpoint 
of conservation of our resources, rather than trying to obtain the 
cheapest source of fuel, quite different conclusions can be drawn. 
Grant, for the moment, that the following assumptions are realistic 
in the long run: (1) natural gas has a value (say 12c per M.C.F.) on 
the market, and any quantity can be absorbed by export and (2) the 
supply of LPG will exceed the market as the geographic market is 
restricted by prohibitive transportation costs. Under these circum- 
stances the problem resolves itself into a choice between using 
natural gas at 12C per million BTU and flaring LPG or exporting the 
natural gas and using the higher cost fuel. Thus, as long as the 
price of LPG is less than twice the cost of natural gas it is more 
economical from a provincial conservation viewpoint to use the more 
expensive fuel and sell the natural gas to export markets. The 
validity of this statement is contingent on (1) the validity of the 
original assumptions, and (2) realization of the feet that the ratio 
of 2:1 will have to be reduced by an amount corresponding to any 
additional investment necessary to adapt the system to the use of LPG. 
An example may help in understanding this situation. 

Suppose that the propane resources of the Pembina field were 
fed into the Northwestern Utilities system for Edmonton in 1960, and 



- 53 


suppose that the following estimates are within a range of realism: 

1, Propane output - Pembina field - 32,000,000 gallons. 

Q 

2. Edmonton's annual requirement of gas - 40 x 10 cu. ft. 

Thus, on a BTU comparison, the propane resources amount to 

S.75% of the total demand. Now assume a wellhead price of propane 
in Pembina of 2^<? per gallon, so that if all the propane was sold 
to Northwestern Utilities the total cost to the distributor would be 
$800,000 (.025 X 32,000,000). The use of this gas results in an 
additional income from exporting gas of $420,000 (3,500,000 MCF x 12$) 
or a net cost of $380,000 and a saving of $40,000 (420,000 - 380,000). 

If Figure VIII can be considered as realistic, this use of pro¬ 
pane would absorb about 1/3 of the estimated surplus in 1960, and 
would have a stabilizing effect on the industry. This type of policy 
xjould undoubtedly encounter objection from the consumer unless the 
proceeds of the exported gas were applied against the cost of servicing 
the Edmonton market. In spite of the administrative difficulties, it 
would certainly assist the long run development of the whole petroleum 
industry as any policy which restricts waste is beneficial. 

At the present time, this suggestion cannot be expected to gain 
too much favor. However, once export markets for gas become plentiful, 
it may become a worthwhile method of helping to balance temporary 
surpluses of LPG against deficiencies of natural gas.

D. FARM AND RURAL U£E 

as 

Historically the largest market for LPG has been^'a fuel 
on farms and in rural conmunities. In the U.S.A. in 1957, farm 
customers accounted for 44% of the gallonage, 47% of the equipment 
purchases, 45% of the dollar sales and 42% of the number of customers 
of the LPG industry. The farmer has a variety of possibilities in 
determining his fuel requirements. Coal, wood, natural gas, stove 
oil, electricity and LPG compete for space and spot heating while 
for combustion engines and equipment he may use diesel fuel, gasoline 
or LPG. His choice will be a result of considering such factors as 
relative cost, efficiency, and convenience. As costs vary greatly 
between regions, no generalizations can be made, so each area must 
be considered separately. 

There is an unlimited variety of possible uses for LPG on 
the farm, the most common of which are central heating, stoves, 
refrigerators, air conditioners, trucks, tractors, combines, irriga¬ 
tion pumps, grain dryers, insect or weed killers. However, these 
areas cannot be exploited unless the price is competitive with other 
fuels. The following table gives the wholesale price per 1,000,000 
B.T.U. of the various fuels in Edmonton. Edmonton was chosen because 
it is centred in the source area of most of the products and trans¬ 
portation costs would have a minimal effect.

For space and spot heating, gas or electric equipment is much 
more convenient, and in spite of their higher cost will always be 
preferred over coal or wood. Coal and wood are the most popular fuel 
in poorer areas. In addition, as the immediate costs necessary to 
install more modern equipment are quite high, coal burning equipment 
is retained in some wealthy communities. However, there is no questioning 
the fact that propane equipment is much cleaner and requires much less 
effort. Natural gas pipelines are normally uneconomical for sparsely 
populated areas so propane, transported in cylinders, is the most 
economical gaseous fuel and is an ideal source of concentrated heat to 
which the accurate control of gaseous fuels can be applied. In spite 
of being more expensive than competing heating fuels, propane would 
capture more of the rural market if the industry were more aggresive. 

The most apparent method is to service farms completely, rather than try 
to sell to more farms who burn propane for only a few uses. By 
concentrating the market in this mannerj distribution and storage costs

would be lessened and this saving could be passed on to make the 
fuel more competitive. Probably, the more important selling point 
is that any additional costs incurred by switching from cheaper heating 
fuel would be balanced by decreased fuel costs for tractors and other 
equipment. The only people trying to effect this change are the salesmen 
of the individual distributing firms. An increased degree of industry 
wide co-operation would certainly make sales programs more effective. 

The truth of this fact is born out by a study made by Imperial Oil Ltd., 
in 1955, to determine the relationship between the actual and the potential 
rural market. They approached the problem from three aspects: 

1. Determining the rural per capital consumption of propane 
and projecting it on to an estimate of population increase. 

2. Determining the consumption per rural household and 
estimating the increase in households together with fore- 

’ casting increases in volume used per household because of 
increased use as a heating fuel. 

3. Projection of anticipated sales. 

The average of these estimates revealed the following estimate 
of the market for propane for rural consumption in thousands of gallons:

costs. Nevertheless, it can be considered sufficiently realistic for 
our purpose. Several conclusions can be drawn: (1) There is considerable 
opportunity for propane distributors in Manitoba and Saskatchewan when 
pipeline facilities warrant development of local gas fields. When this 
happens, propane can be obtained locally rather than being imported 
from Alberta so that costs will be competitive with other fuels. 

(2) The largest potential market is for space heating where the cost 
of propane is least competitive . As mentioned previously, this market 
can best be secured by a "complete servicing program" which in turn 
requires industry wide co-ordination to be effective. (3) There is 
considerable scope for expansion. 

On the other hand, there are several limiting factors to the 
increasing use of LPG for farm consumption. Because of the geographic 
limitations where LPG is competitive price-wise with other fuels, the 
market is restricted. Hence there is a reluctance on the part of 
manufacturers of appliances to develop and promote equipment using LPG. 
Without large output, unit costs are high and often restrictive. In 
addition, seasonal demand makes large scale transportation and distribution 
investment un economical. It is difficult to balance the effects of 
seasonality with other users, as it is unlikely that they would locate 
in predominantly rural areas. 

We can therefore conclude that the rural domestic market offers 
considerable scope for absorbing some of the expected surplus for 
propane in Western Canada. There are many problems to overcome, but 
with proper organization and aggressive merchandising the market can be 


secured.

E. INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES 

Considerable research has been carried out in an effort to 
develop automotive engines which use propane as a fuel. The result 
has been the designing of equipment which can be technically and 
theoretically more efficient than gasoline or diesel. In engines 
specifically designed for the higher compression ratios particularly 
suited for butane (8 to 1) and propane (12 to 1), the gases provide 
a means of raising thermal efficiency (i.e. a greater return of use¬ 
ful energy for the same amount of fuel). LPG has better anti-detonat- 
ing properties, which tend to give smooth, powerful and efficient 
operation without the ill effects on the engine consequent on the use 
of lower octane fuels. In addition, additives (tetraethyl, lead, etc.) 
are not required to combat detonation so that the life of rings and 
valves is not adversely affected. Since the engine is supplied with a 
mixture of dry gas and air, the fuel burns completely and cleanly with¬ 
out carbon residue. Maintenance costs are further reduced by the fact 
that the fuel enters the carburetor in a dry vapor state so that the 
oil remains cleaner and does not have to be changed as often. Also, 
there are several minor advantages of LPG engines which make them 
attractive: no exhaust odors, good fuel economy for part loads and 
absence of a fuel pump. 

The engines themselves are more complicated and several modi¬ 
fications are required to convert standard gasoline engines to LPG use. 
Compression ratios should be increased, and a larger intake manifold, 
pressurized fuel tanks, pressure regulator, and filter must be

added. However, these additional fixed costs can be more than balanced 
by savings in fuel and maintenance costs under favorable conditions. 

It is not, however, a one-way street, as LPG engines have 
some inherent disadvantages. They offer less work output (horsepower 
/hour) per gallon than gasoline or diesel equipment. Because of the 
bulky, pressurized tanks, storage and re-fuelling is cumbersome. 

Also the high vapor pressure increases the possiblity of leakage 
and consequent explosion, so they must be handled carefully. LPG 
equipment is hard to start in cold weather, because vapor pressure 
is difficult to build up. Consequently, the engine’s electrical 
system must be kept in good condition. 

A factor which will have a profound effect on the future of 
LPG engines is the policy adopted by equipment manufacturers. They 
are faced with the choice of making engines versatile so they can take 
advantage of regional differences in fuel costs and changes in prices 
over time, yet making the machine specialized enough to permit technical 
advantages for a particular fuel. Because propane is not competitive 
in the larger consuming eastern industrial areas the tendency has been 
to seek competitive advantage by specializing for gasoline or diesel. 
Whether or not pressure to change this policy by western users would 
have any effect is open to question. However, if this were accompanied 
by assurances by eastern refineries that they would produce more LPG 
at a reasonable price, the manufacturers would probably be willing to 
produce more versatile equipment. The problem resolves itself to this:

is it more advantageous from a Western Canadian point of view for 
eastern refineries to restrict or promote LPG production? If they 
restrict^there is a possibility that the Western Canadian product could 
be shipped to eastern markets. If they expand production, they increase 
the entire market and propane equipment would be more available. The 
latter would seem to afford the best possibility for expansion of the 
industry in Western Canada. Nevertheless, the LPG industry finds 
that the price of its product is set at the discretion of major national 
oil companies, who in turn must consider the whole picture - Western 
production, eastern refining, and foreign holding, etc,, before committing 
themselves in any particular segment. This will be discussed under 
separate heading.

THE BASIC_PRINCIPLES OF L.P.G. CARBURETION 

There are two types of carburetion systems - liquid with¬ 
drawal, and vapor withdrawal - neither of which requires a fuel pump 
as the vapor pressure insures flow.

LIQUID WITHDRAWAL

The former can use either propane or butane; the latter is 
unsuitable for engines in cold weather because LPG has too high a 
boiling point and loses too much heat from evaporation so requires a 
substantial amount of heat around the tank. Fuel consumption varies 
inversely with the vapor temperature. Thus it is generally necessary 
to start and warm up the engine on vapor withdrawal from the supply tank

until engine temperature is sufficiently high to offset the refrigerat¬ 
ing effect of the fuel vaporization. This represents an inconvenience 
for the operator as he must start on vapor by opening the vapor with¬ 
drawal valve and then change over to the liquid withdrawal valve when 
the engine temperature is high enough. This problem becomes more 
acute in the cold winters experienced in this region. 

We now turn to a discussion of the possibilities of propane 
and butane in the various types and uses of internal combustion engines. 

POSSIBILITY FOR DIESEL ENGINES 

Propane, as it enters the engine, is a clean uniform vapor 
with an octane rating which is in the category of the finest aviation 
fuel. When utilized in an engine of sufficient strength and rigidity 
to accommodate compression ratios commensurate with this octane value, 
its fuel efficiency factors are among the highest know. Gasoline 
engines will run on propane, but only after considerable conversion 
costs because the ordinary gasoline engine is not built to withstand 
the high pressures resulting from high compression ratios. A diesel, 
however, is an ideal basic engine for conversion. The compression ratio 
for propane is 1/3 less than that for which the average diesel is built, 
so that long engine life is assured. Thus, because of the stronger 
original engine, wear is reduced by as much as 25%, maintenance costs 
by 20%, and according to figures released by the Cyclo-dyne Corporation 
in the United States, power can be increased as much as 50%, depending on

the design of the original engines. Thus, there is a favourable 

it 

fuel cost per mile ratio for propane. The conclusion is that it is 
cheaper to convert a diesel engine to propane than it is to construct 
a propane engine. The conversion costs are no more than a major 
overhaul. The limiting factor in Western Canada is the supply of 
diesel engines with sufficient wear to warrant additional investment. 

Another possibility is to inject a propane-air mix, instead 
of straight air, into a standard diesel engine. This type of thinking 
is still in the experimental stage, but indications are that power 
output is increased without increasing fuel costs. 

POSSIBILITIES AS _ TRACTOR F UEL 

This is a market which LPG should be able to capture if 
the only considerations were of a technical and theoretical nature. 

The Kansas State College has undertaken an extensive research program 
to determine the advantages and disadvantages of the various fuels- 
propane, diesel and gasoline - which can be used for tractors. From 
a cost and an efficiency standpoint they reached the following con¬ 
clusions: (1) Propane is superior to diesel if used less than 1500 

hours per year, and diesel and propane are the same price and (2) 
propane is superior to gasoline if used more than 500 hours per year 
and gasoline prices are 150% of propane prices. As the wholesale prices 
of the various fuels in Edmonton are*,propane - 6c per gallon, diesel - 
16c per gallon and gasoline - 22c per gallon, propane should be the 
major fuel for this market. 

In actual fact, of the 500,000 farm tractors which are in 
operation in Western Canada less than % of 17o use propane. There

are several reasons for this phenomenon, probably the most im¬ 
portant of which is the attitude of the major oil companies toward 
L.P.G. generally. The whole oil industry is controlled by a small 
number of very large integrated companies who produce, refine and 
distribute their products nationally. Consequently, any efforts 
to promote the use of propane would, if successful, result in the 
decreased use of their other products. In effect, a company would 
be competing with itself, so that L.P.G, is the forgotten product. 

If we could visualize the industry as having each firm concerned 
with one product only - diesel, gasoline or propane - one cannot 
help but feel that propane would have more uses than it does at 
present. In short, no large, financially secure company is very 
concerned about increasing the market for L.P.G. in areas where it 
competes with gasoline or diesel. Farm tractors fall into this 
category. 

There are other more specific reasons why propane is not 
used more extensively for tractor fuel in Western Canada. Because 
L.P.G. is a relatively young and undeveloped industry there has been 
considerable uncertainty regarding uniform prices and a lack of 
assurance about a continuing supply. In addition, there is a short¬ 
age of both experiences service personnel and distribution facilities 
The average farmer, being of a conservative nature, would rather use 
a product of which he is sure than use a newer fuel, of which he has 
imperfect knowledge, even if the former is more expensive. Thus 
farmers have continued to use tractors burning purple gasoline rather

than invest in propane-driven engines. The first step necessary 
to counteract this tendency is research to eliminate the oper¬ 
ational deficiencies of the propane engine. The Research Council 
of Alberta is at the present time attempting to develop an engine 
with a simplified carburetion design which still maintains the pressure 
regulation and control mechanism so necessary for efficient operation 
of the engine. Preliminary work has resulted in the following con¬ 
clusions; 

1. Methods should be devised for prevention of 
hazards due to leakage from high pressure lines. 

2. New techniques for vaporization of fuel are 
required. Present methods vary too much with 
the temperature and demands of the engine and 
with outside air temperature. 

”It is suggested that research be carried out on a pressure 
heat exchanger. If under a pressure higher than that supplied by 
the L.P.G. tank, a certain quantity of heat can be added by a liquid 
to liquid heat exchanger, and this quantity is sufficient under nor¬ 
mal circumstances to volatalize the fuel when it is released to 
atmosphere pressure, then such a system need have only a short 
connection touthe main tank, of a type not likely to cause leaks 
and its low pressure side could supply gas to a conventional L.P.G. 
carburetor by means of a simple hose system under low pressure".^

If further research of this nature proves satisfactory, the 
probable result would be an increase in the types of engines using 
L.P.G. There is a potential market for stationery engines, industrial 
and road equipment, and bus or truck fleets with fixed points of origin 
and destination. This market is of particular importance because it 
would reduce the seasonal variations of demand. The Fuel Oil 
Transaction Act makes propane less attractive to prospective Alberta 
consumers. Under this act, there is a lOd gallon tax on propane when 
used as a motor fuel on Alberta highways, with the exception of units 
employed solely for the movement of L.P.G. 

POiSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSIT BUSES 

The use of propane engines for urban transit buses has not 
found wide acceptance. Nevertheless when they have been used, results 
have been promising. A paper written by the Technical Information of 
the Federal Government suggested that for bus operation, based on a 
cost of $250 to $300 per vehicle for conversion, and $12,000 for 
installation of storage facilities, the operator must be able to buy 
propane for 3/4 the price of gasoline to break even. In spite of this, 
Edmonton is the only Canadian city which uses propane buses. 

The EvT.S. uses electric, diesel, gasjline and propane buses. 
Because of the deep river valley, propane is excluded from trans¬ 
river routes because it cannot supply the high power necessary for 
steep grades. However, it has been used with great success on level 
routes. Edmonton's propane bus engines are as clean and wear free 
after 150,000 miles as the normal gasoline engines are at 50,000 miles.

Records have shown that by operating a controlled fleet of these 
buses the down time is very low and availability approaches 95?o. 
However, close control of the carburetion and ignition systems 
is essential so that trained mechanics must be retained. 

It is not technical efficiencies which limit the use of 
propane buses in Edmonton, but shortage of standard en^«r\€S c or 
equipment which can be converted to L.P.G, use. Thus we run into 
the ever present problem of reluctance on the part of equipment 
manufacturers to produce propane burning engines. The obvious 
solution is to persuade other cities to demand this type of pro¬ 
duction. Failure to do so can be attributed to three factors: 

(1) lack of coordination of propane distributors in various areas, 

(2) the prevelance of civil administrations which control both 
transit and electrical systems, and (3) the fact that once a 
particular fuel is chosen the high initial cost of equipment make 
it uneconomical to change before present equipment is worn out.

F. MISCIBLE FLOOD 

Conventional methods of producing crude oil generally 
leave In the depleted reservoir one to three barrels of oil for 
every barrel brought to the surface. As long as operators have to 
leave pools which still contain oil, efforts will be continued to 
Increase recoverability. The unrecoverable oil In petroleum reser¬ 
voirs Is largely trapped by capillarity. Since flushing with a sol¬ 
vent Is exceedingly effective In combatting this type of loss much 
effort In this direction has been made In recent years. L.P.G. has 
been suggested as a relatively Inexpensive, abundant and easily re¬ 
coverable solvent for crude oil. Unlike water, L.P.G. can simply 
dissolve the oil out of the reservoir rock, yet it still has the 
desirable liquid characteristic. In other words, with water flooding, 
water comes along and pushes the oil out of the way In a plstonllke 
manner. - Isolated pockets of oil are left behind the front as capill¬ 
ary forces cause retention of the oil in the pores of the rock. With 
solvent extraction, the displacement proceeds as in the case of a 
water flood except that there is no sharp discontinuity between the 
two fluids. There is no interface similar to that found in unmiscible 
fluid displacement. Instead, there is a transition zone, or a region 
where the solvent and the oil mix. The flow rate must be slow enough 

to allow the solvent to mix with the oil yet fast enough so that the 
front will not spread out too far by diffusion. 

Probably the biggest drawback to L.P.G. flooding, and no 
doubt a strong reason for its slow adoption by the industry is the high

cost. In general it is uneconomical to inject a volume of L.P.G. 
into the reservoir to remove a like volume of oil. 

It is possible to remove part of this economic disadvantage 
by recovering most of the solvent and using it again. However, gener¬ 
ally speaking, this involves an abnormally large supply of L.P.G., 
ties it up for a long time in the reservoir, and requires large expen¬ 
ditures for processing equipment. Probably a more economical method 
is to use a minimum amount of L.P.G. and two modifications of solvent 
flushing have been developed with this in mind: (1) a gas driven 
solvent bank, and (2) enriched gas injection. 

In the first method a small bank of L.P.G. at the input 
wells in driven by gas through the reservoir to the producing wells. 
Initially, gas is injected into the reservoir in sufficient quantity 
to keep the propane (or butane) in a liquid state. The quantity 
necessary is determined by depth, (temperatures increase l^F, for each 
70 feet down) the existing pressure, the porosity of the rock and the 
size and nature of the reservoir. Then the bank of L.P.G. is injected 
and flows out in all directions from the input well, building up an 
oil bank ahead of it. When all the propane is in the reservoir, gas 
is injected to move the propane and the oil to the producing wells. 

The L.P.G. will be moved through the reservoir both as a liquid and 
as a vapor where it mixes with the chasing gas. 

In enriched gas injection, substantial quantities of L.P.G. 
are added directly to the gas stream and the wet gas is injected as a 
driving fluid. The L.P.G. in the gas stream condenses and dissolves 
in the gas stream. This reduces the viscosity and swells the oil in

the region. Thus, an oil bank rich in L.P.G, is built up ahead 
of the gas front very similar to the solvent bank in the other 
system. 

Both these methods have resulted in increased oil recovery, 

A decision to use either one of them in a particular situation must 
be based on local conditions, so it is difficult ,to make any general 
statement regarding their economic significance. In the U.S, the oil 
industry is drilling more and deeper wells and making fewer big dis¬ 
coveries, Nevertheless, the demand for oil increases each year. It 
is natural that oil companies, faced with this situation, concentrate 
on recovering more of the oil existing in known crude reservoirs. 
Consequently, there is considerable scope for miscible flood operations. 

Secondary recovery is a theoretical possibility for any pool 
but it has definite practical limitations. From a technical viewpoint 
Canada has profited by American experience in establishing more effi¬ 
cient primary recovery techniques. As a result, the only fields which 
are liable to have inefficient ultimate recovery are those which have 
a dissolved gas drive, and excess production causes too great a loss 
of pressure. In this case secondary recovery methods are effective 
for maintaining pressure, if there is continuity in structure between 
injection and producing wells. In Alberta these conditions (dissolved 
gas drive and continuity of structure) exist in only a limited number 
of pools, ie: Pembina, Golden Spike. 

Where they do exist and there is scope for secondary recovery, 
the operator has a choice between a gas injection and water injection 
and this is in turn, dependent on market considerations.

Water injection is cheaper, but less efficient than gas or 
L.P.G. injection. Thus to warrant the choice of some type of gas 
drive, there must be ample demand to absorb the increased production 
and this is hardly the case in Alberta. At the present time, most 
wells are not permitted to produce much in excess of their economic- 
allowable so there is little incentive to try to increase output 
capacity. This situation is liable to continue until markets for our 
crude oil are expanded either to Montreal or to the U.S, When, and 
if this occurs the use of L.P.G. for miscible flood operation will be 
expanded but it is doubtful if it will be used in sufficient quantities 
to counteract the surpluses which are forecasted. 

At the present time, miscible flood operations in Alberta are 
on a "pilot plant" basis with most interest being shown in the Pembina 
field. There, pressure dropped as extraction continued and because 
there were many marginal wells, portions of the field were unitized so 
that some wells were converted to injection, and their allowables trans¬ 
ferred to the production well. In 1957, Canadian Bishop and McColl 
Frontenac jointly used 73,000 barrels of L.P.G. and Mobiloil used 7,500 
barrels for secondary crude recovery. Preliminary tests indicate that 
the best mix is 507® propane and 50% butane followed by natural gas. 

The maximimi propane to butane ratio is 3:1. Mobiloil originally 
planned to expand their operation to 1.5 million barrels of L.P.G. in 
1958, purchasing the gas at low summer prices and renting storage from 
Goliad. The depressed state of the industry curtailed this program. 

In a special case, Texaco successfully petitioned the 
Conservation Board to allow the L.P.G. volume injected to be added to 
the maximum permissable rate for determining allowables. If this is a

precedent, it will supply an incentive for other companies to do 
the same when maximum permissable rates become significant. 

In conclusion, it is felt that miscible flood will only 
be a significant user of L.P.G. in the Pembina field and even there 
it cannot compete favorably with water flooding until the demand for 


crude oil increases to a considerable extent.

CHAPTER V 

TRANSPORTATION AND POSSIBILITY OF EXPORT 

In the U.S. the supply-demand equilibrium is improving 
because of the increasing number of pipelines and the use of under¬ 
ground storage to counteract the sharp seasonal differences. The 
bulk of L.P.G. pipeline distribution is through products pipelines 
built or converted to handle products with the specific gravity of 
L.P.G. There are four methods of L.P.G. pipeline transportation: 

(1) Batching L.P.G. through products pipelines, (2) lines handling 
L.P.G. mixed with natural gas liquids (3) pipelines handling propane - 
ethane mixtures, and (4) batching L.P.G. through crude oil pipelines. 

The largest L.P.G. pipelines in the U.S. are from the 
interior of Texas to the gulf coast. There are three with a total 
capacity of 100,000 bbls. a day built to supply the huge refining and 
petrochemical industries in the Houston area. In addition there are 
lines to Denver, St. Louis and Chicago, and the Atlantic Seaboard. 

An indication of the effect this has is the fact that U.S. eastern 
markets pay about 13 - 13%^ per gallon for L.P.G., of which 7.5^ is 
transportation costs. 

Pipelines require large scale storage facilities because the 
relatively constant flow does not usually correspond with demand. 
Underground storage is far cheaper than above-ground tanks for the 
large quantities involved. Several types-salt caverns, mines, cavities, 
or depleted oil reservoirs have been used with varying success. The 
total facilities amounted to 33.3 million barrels capacity at the end

In January 1958, there were 21,880 L.P.G. tank cars and 
12,200 which were capable of being converted to L.P.G. In addition 
3,327 truck transports with a total capacity of 10,147,000 gallons 
were in service. 

Tankers suitable for ocean transport, are used to a limited 
extent. The construction costs approximate $500 - $600 per ton of 
L.P.G. capacity. 

Thus it can be seen that pipeline transportation is a 
relatively new, though much publicized method, and the more conven¬ 
tional carriers are still the largest movers. In fairness, it should 
be noted that this table makes no mention to total distances carried.

the U.S. is readily available in most of the trade publications. A 
full examination is unwarranted in this paper because the Western 
Canadian market situation is so different from the American picture. 

In 1956, Canadian Hydrocarbons took out a permit to build 
on an 800 mile line from Alberta to Fort William. Total cost in¬ 
cluding feeder lines approximated $60 million. Their idea was to 
market the propane in Manitoba, and ship from the Lakeheads to the 
Eastern market. They originally considered the possibility because 
the rail cost of L.P.G. from Alberta to Lake Superior was 10c per 
gallon, whereas the cost of pipelining under optimum conditions was 
2c per gallon. To make the plan feasible, there had to be a defici¬ 
ency in Eastern supply. The plan was shelved because this shortage 
did not materialize, and is not likely to develop over the short run. 

The position of Eastern refineries is strengthened by the growth in 
crude and natural gas pipelines from Western to Eastern Canada. As 
long as they get adequate supplies of crude, it will be cheaper for 
Eastern users to get propane from refineries than to ship it in 
directly. The following graph indicates the rate of growth of crude and 
natural gas pipelines in Canada:

Thus, a greater effort in promoting the sale of crude and 
natural gas from Western Canada effects the possibilities of L.P.G. 
adversely in two ways. It increases the supply of L.P.G. and at the 
same time makes markets more competitive. 

It is doubtful if any L.P.G. pipeline will be built eastward 
from Alberta in the foreseeable future. Besides the marketing diffic¬ 
ulties, (there is no assurance that eastern refineries will not drop 
prices), there are technical problems which exist for L.P.G. but not 
for crude oil or natural gas. The major difficulty is with temperature 
extremes which make pressure variance a necessity if the product is to 
be kept in the desired state - either liquid or vapor. The high con¬ 
struction costs make an L.P.G. pipeline over the Rockies to the Pacific 
unfeasible. Any pipeline constructed will be to transport the product 
from the field to large volume consumers in Western Canada as is pres¬ 
ently being used from the Devon gas plant to Canadian Chemicals Limited 
in Edmonton. Tank cars and tank trucks will continue to be the major 
carriers as they are versatile and can adapt to shifts in demand loc¬ 
ation without any significant expense. In addition, seasonal demand 
can be satisfied with a minimum of storage at the point of use. In short, 
they are more applicable to our situation which has a large number of 
relatively small volvime consumers. 

The most obvious export market available is the U.S. Pacific 
Northwest, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and W/oming have an 
annual market potential of about 75 million gallons. The refineries in 
the area (Shell at Anacortes, General Petroleum at Ferndale, and Texaco

at Seattle) produce about 35 million gallons per year, with the balance 
supplied by California and Group III producers.^ The completion of a 
Richfield refinery at Washington in 1959 may result in available supply 
being in excess of demand in the seacoast states. This will probably 
exclude the California supply, and result in a competition for the 
L.P.G. market of the interior States (Idaho and Montana) between 
Group III, the Washington refineries, and Alberta. Even if we are 
optimistic, and assume that this market can be served most economically 
from Alberta, and that there are no government restrictions, it is 
doubtful if any large scale investment would be undertaken to capture 
this market because of the uncertainty of maintaining it. Probably 
the seaboard refineries would expand output (by purchasing more Can¬ 
adian crude so that once again we are competing with ourselves) in an 
effort to counteract our entrance. Without large scale investment, 
(i.e. pipelines) unit transportation costs are high so that even though 
we obtain a market it will never be a big one. The possible saviour 
is the new Pincher Creek plant close to the American border which will 
have a minimum of transportation costs. 

Japan could conceivably become a market since various 

'I 

Japanese industries are constantly seeking abundant and more econom¬ 
ical sources of energy. A refrigeration vessel is now being con¬ 
structed in Japan for the purpose of carrying L.P.G. from Vancouver 
to Japan. However, even if this market develops, its demands are not

and Oklahoma.

CHAPTER VI 
CONCLUSIONS 

The market situation for propane and butane Is peculiar 
because the supply Is not primarily determined by effective demand 
as Is normally the case. Instead^the supply of L.P.G. Is determined 
by the demand for the major petroleum products - natural gas and 
crude oil. L.P.G. will have difficulty in attaining major product 
status because its boiling point occurs within the normal range of 
temperatures and consequently is difficult to handle. Because of 
the expected increase in Western Canadian petroleum production, the 
supply of L.P.G. is not expected to be the limiting factor. The major 
problem for optimum development of the industry is to find markets 
and develop distribution systems and methods which will serve these 
markets efficiently. 

The markets which seem to afford the best possibilities for 
expanded use over the short run are combustion engines, rural use and 
natural gas distribution systems. Over the long run, L.P.G. will 
undoubtedly be used to an increasing extent as a raw material for the 
petrochemical industry, and for miscible flood operations. 

From a technical viewpoint, propane has advantages over 
other fuels in combustion engines, providing the equipment is adapted 
to its use. Consequently the problem is not one of theoretical effic¬ 
iency, but one of making the engines simple so that equipment costs 
are not prohibitive. It will be difficult to encourage large manufact- 
uerers to expand the output of engines specifically designed for L.P.G. 
because of the limited market in which the fuel has an absolute cost

advantage over other fuels. Consequently, the best method will be to 
find inexpensive methods of converting existing equipment to L.P.G. 
use. This can be done most easily at the provincial rather than the 
national level. The work currently being done by the Research Council 
of Alberta in this area may result in a local private industry which 
can produce and market these conversion mechanisms. 

In rural areas, propane can compete cost-wise with oil, 
natural gas, and electricity. In addition, it is much more convenient 
than either coal or wood. Nevertheless, the market has not been 
developed to anything near potential. This fact is directly attribut¬ 
able to the inadequacies of the merchandising and distribution methods 
of the industry. Farmers do not realize that advantages of using 
propane so more dynamic selling methods are necessary. By persuading 
farmers to use propane for a greater variety of equipment and assuring 
continuity of supply at stable prices, distribution costs per gallon 
could be decreased thus providing a larger market and greater profits 
for distributors. The increased distribution efficiency resulting 
from more intensive use on the part of the farmer will inevitably make 
extensive market growth easier. 

Using propane for peak shaving operations in natural gas 
distribution systems does not seem to be applicable to the Alberta 
situation. However, if other markets cannot be exploited even at 
minimum prices, propane could be used as a continuous fuel in these 
systems. The increased cost would be balanced by the revenue obtained 
from the export of natural gas which would otherwise have been used 
locally. As long as natural gas is exported on a quota basis this

policy would involve adminstrative difficulties but would be prefer¬ 
able to waste. 

As the population of Western Canada increases there will 
be increase scope for a petrochemical industry in Alberta. New 
techniques and products will undoubtedly be developed for which 
Alberta possesses a definite location advantage. However, the growth 
of the industry is expected to be gradual and only in the long run 
can it be relied upon as an outlet for surplus production of L.P.G. 

If current forecasts of future rates of extraction of 
Alberta’s oil resources can be considered as realistic, the use of 
L.P.G. for miscible flood operations is not expected to be extensive. 

In certain reservoir formations it is a definite possibility but these 
formations are scarce. Until demand is such that it is expected to 
absorb the output which would be forthcoming using the most efficient 
normal withdrawal methods, secondary recovery operations are unprac¬ 
tical as a general policy. At present, rates of extraction in Alberta, 
the additional oil output resulting from miscible flood operations 
cannot be sold for many years, and the costs normally exceed the dis¬ 
counted future revenues. As a consequence, the use of L.P.G. for 
miscible flood will be restricted to fields with peculiar reservoir 
formations. 

The Pacific Northwest region of the United States appears 
to be a possible economic market for Alberta's surplus L.P.G. Efforts 
to reduce political barriers to this market are necessary, and would 
be most influencial if co-ordinated with demands from the Canadian oil

industry as a whole. 

The L.P.G. industry is not the type which can grow by normal 
expansion into new geographic areas, because the size of market where 
there is an absolute cost advantage as a fuel is limited by transport¬ 
ation costs. This restricted market discouragesjto a degree, any large 
research program which might improve the competitive position of the 
product. In addition, the firms in a position to finance this research 
do not have too much incentive as the result may be a decreased demand 
for some of the other fuels which they produce. Thus as mass product¬ 
ion of equipment which can use L.P.G. is unwarranted, unit costs will 
be high. Generally speaking, the market would be made up of a rel¬ 
atively large number of small volume consumers. Thus, any producer or 
retailer who expects to expand cannot do it on a gradual basis because 
(1) the original operating equipment is expensive and have to be 
purchased immediately^ (2) to be economical, storage facilities have 
to be built with large capactitieSj (3) trained technicians have to be 
hiredj(4) the stock of equipment has to be carried by the retailer 
rather than the manufacturer^ (5) distribution facilities are expensive 
as the market is likely to be widely dispersed, (6) there is con¬ 
siderable risk involved because the fuel itself is relatively unproven. 
These factors have probably led to the relatively slow advance of the 
product into fields now served by gasoline or diesel oil. In other 
words, to assume the inevitable confidence, or even existence, of 
consumers involves a risk which that average firm is not prepared to 
take. The desire to establish a larger market is further restricted

by the fact that once a market is obtained it is very easy for new 
firms to enter the industry and capture customers which the more 
progressive firms established. 

Because of the research facilities available for their 
study, competing fuels have become increasingly efficient as have the 
engines designed for their use. L.P.G, is thus competing with well- 
merchandised, nationally advertised product!. 

The most immediate need is a more co-ordinated organization 
of firms in the industry. Theoretically, it is the type of situation 
which is suited to a monopoly type of organization. Assuming a supply 
surplus the product could be marketed more efficiently if each prod¬ 
ucer has his own territory (avoid duplication), and the access to 
centralized research, storage and purchasing facilities. The 
reluctance of oil companies to finance research may suggest the est¬ 
ablishment of a government agency financed by either general oil 
revenue or interested parties, to undertake research and administer 
the marketing of the product. However, if the producing and distrib¬ 
uting firms could co-ordinate within the framework of the industry a 
more effective program could be planned. At the present time an 
association exists but it is ineffective as it has no financial resour¬ 
ces or adminstrative power. By expanding this organization, the whole 
industry would benefit. The association itself could be responsible 
for such things as advertising, research, storage and co-ordination of 
policy. 

Increased expenditures on advertising are warranted. To be

most effective it should be informative and designed to increase the 
market as a whole rather than continue the competitive policies which 
are at present being employed by individual firms in an attempt to 
capture a larger portion of the existing market from competitors. 
Suggested media might include farm and trade publications. 

To finance and administer research facilities would prob¬ 
ably involve a greater cost than the Alberta industry is prepared to 
pay. However, existing consultant firms, both economic and technical^ 
could be retained to advantage. In addition, governmental departments 
could be persuaded to expand their facilities for studies of the use 
of L.P.G. In the long run, the industry might develop to a size which 
will make the establishment of their ovm research program feasible. 

Common storage facilities could be constructed and more 
efficient carrier systems used. These and other policies could be 
handled most effectively by a centralized controlling body. In add¬ 
ition it could operate as a pressure group to force suppliers of 
equipment to expand the production of L.P.G. engines. It is hoped 
that the more progressive firms in the industry will attempt to 
establish and maintain such an organization.
