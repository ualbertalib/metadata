PREFACE 


Of all the Provinces, Alberta has moved the fastest 
and has gone the farthest in the matter of re-organizing 
its system of rural school administration. To-day, there 
are in operation in Alberta fifty large administrative 
units, or school divisions, as they are commonly known. 

At the present time there are fewer than 100 rural school 
districts operating under local boards of trustees. 

Over 8C$ of the above divisions have been functioning 
for three years or longer. It should be possible now to 
discern and describe the more obvious characteristics of the 
divisional system of school administration, and to make a 
beginning, at least, at evaluating the contributions of this 
system to the improvement of educational facilities in the 
rural areas of the Province. In this report an attempt is 
made to accomplish this two-fold end. 

Part I of this report deals with the general legisla¬ 
tive framework within which Alberta school divisions operate. 
Part II, which is a description of these large administrative 
units in action, is based on the records of their achieve¬ 
ments from 1937, the year in which the first divisions were 
organized, until the end of 1941. 

The data from which Part II was prepared were secured 
by means of an extensive questionnaire which was sent to the 
superintendents of the 48 divisions operating in 1941. Com¬ 
pleted questionnaires were received back from 41 divisions. 
Part II of this report is based, therefore, on a very com-

plete sampling of conditions as found in the divisions oper¬ 
ating in Alberta at the present time. 

No attempt has been made in this report to give a detail¬ 
ed comparison between school operating costs under the divi¬ 
sional system as against those obtaining under the former 
system of local board control. However, the writer of this 

i 

report did attempt such a comparison in 1939, and filed a 
report ^ on same with the Faculty of Education, University 
of Alberta.

PART I 


SALIENT FEATURES OF 

THE ALBERTA SYSTEM OF ENLARGED UNITS OF 

SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION 










CHAPTER I 


METHOD OF ESTABLISHING DIVISIONS 

The procedure followed in setting up enlarged units 
of school administration in Alberta is outlined succinctly 
in Section 231 Cl) of THE SCHOOL ACT, 1931s- 

“Where the conditions prevailing are such that it 
appears advisable in the interests of education so 
to do, or if it is so requested by the boards of 
trustees of the majority of school districts in a 
proposed division, the Minister may by order consti¬ 
tute a school division consisting of any number of 
rural public school districts not being districts 
wholly or partially included in a consolidated 
district." 

Fifty divisions have been established in Alberta. 

In accordance with the above section of the Act, these 
have been set up by ministerial order, at the discretion 
of the Minister of Education, and without a vote of the 
electors concerned. There does not seem to be a case on 
record where the ministerial order constituting a division 
was issued upon the request of the boards of the majority 
of school districts in the proposed division. No town, 
village, consolidated, or separate school districts were 
included in the divisions as originally constituted. Sub¬ 
sequently, however, a number of such districts have been 
taken into divisions under terms of special agreements to 
be described below. 

In the months immediately preceding the establish¬ 
ment of any school division, the inspector of schools of 
the area, generally with the aid of other officials of the 
Department of Education, held meetings throughout the

proposed division. At these meetings the officials outlin¬ 
ed the proposals with regard to setting up the division in 
question, dealt with the advantages of the scheme, and 
attempted to answer questions. In this way the electors 
were given an opportunity of securing definite information 
in regard to the manner in which the new system would affect 
them and their districts. 

It was not found possible to permit local districts to 
choose the divisions in which they were to be included, 
since a certain uniformity of size had to be maintained. 

The number of classrooms that one superintendent could be 
expected to supervise with a reasonable degree of efficiency 
served as the determining factor governing the size of most 
divisions. In fixing the boundaries of the various divi¬ 
sions, care was taken to include in each division schools 
which were geographically related to one another. Natural 
boundaries were taken into consideration as well as the 
positions of main highways and roads, and railway lines.

CHAPTER II 


THE ORGANIZATION UF A SCHOOL DIVISION 

The setting up of a division does not imply necessar¬ 
ily any physical consolidation of school plants. It does 
imply, however, financial consolidation and a rather high 
degree of administrative centralization. A school division 
is essentially an aggregation of rural public school dis¬ 
tricts which, on the date that the division was constituted, 
had their assets and liabilities consolidated and vested in 
a new corporate body, the divisional board, and which, from 
that date on, ceased to function as separate financial units. 
The schools and other educational services provided within 
the divisional area are administered from a central office 
by the divisional board acting through its chief executive 
officers, the superintendent and the secretary-treasurer. 

Local districts continue to exist under the divisional 
set-up, and minister to certain administrative ends. 

Locally elected three-member boards continue to function in 
these districts, although with restricted powers. In par¬ 
ticular, local boards have been relieved of all responsibil¬ 
ity with respect to the financing of their schools and the 
engagement or dismissal of their teachers. In general, 
these boards act as official links between their districts 
and the divisional board, and see to it that the education¬ 
al interests and needs of their districts receive due con¬ 
sideration. In particular, local boards may by resolution 


- 3 - 
























































' 

. .. 0 




- 4 - 


nominate persons for employment by the divisional board as 
teachers in their schools; they exercise a very consider¬ 
able influence in matters pertaining to the provision of 
religious instruction in the schools in their districts; 
and they attend to the care and maintenance of school 
property to whatever degree responsibility in this matter 
is delegated to them by the divisional board. 

The local districts comprising a division are grouped 
into three or five ,f subdivisions”, depending on the size of 
the division. These subdivisions are in effect divisional 
electoral districts. Each elects one trustee to the divi¬ 
sional board. 

The School Act calls for an annual meeting of the 
electors of each subdivision. This meeting is held between 
October 31st and December 15th. It is at these meetings 
that nominations for the office of divisional trustee are 
made. Nominations must be made in writing, must be signed 
by a certain number of electors from the subdivision, and 
must be accompanied by the written acceptance of the person 
nominated. Elections, when required, are held during the 
second week in January. A poll is established in each 
district of the subdivision where an election is being held. 
Electors must vote at the poll in the district in which 
they reside. 

Divisional trustees hold office for two years. Their 
terms of office are staggered so that about half expire 
each year.

The School Act provides for the payment of the following 
allowances to divisional trustees: 

1. The sum of not more than five dollars per day for each 
day spent in attendance at a divisional board meeting togeth¬ 
er with an allowance of not more than eight cents per mile 
for every mile necessarily travelled in coming to and return¬ 
ing from meetings of the board; 

2. Reasonable allowances for travelling expenses and sub¬ 
sistence when engaged away from home on business of the bo and 
authorized by resolution of the board. 

A divisional board is required to meet at least six 
times a year at intervals of not less than one month or more 
than two months. With the divisional board rests the full 
responsibility for providing, administering, and financing 
the educational services of the division. The divisional 
board appoints teachers, assigns them to their schools, pays 
their salaries and terminates their engagement when this 
step becomes necessary. It is responsible for the erection 
and maintenance of buildings, and the supply of furniture 
and equipment as needed. It is further the responsibility 
of the board to draw up an annual budget showing the amounts 
of money it proposes to use for ea.ch class of expenditure 
and to requisition the collecting authorities for the amounts 
required. 

The Board is also given certain powers that it may exer¬ 
cise at its discretion. These include the hiring of physi¬ 
cians, dentists, and nurses, the employment of teachers of 
special subjects, the furnishing of free text-books and 




- ■

r " o■ . ; ‘to 




























- 6 - 


school supplies, and the establishment of dormitories. 

A divisional board may from time to time with the con¬ 
sent of the Minister borrow such sums as it requires to meet 
current operation expenditures, provided that such borrow¬ 
ings do not exceed the aggregate amount payable or to become 
payable to the board by virtue of requisitions it has made. 

A board may also borrow upon the security of the division by 
the issue of debentures. Debenture issues of $20,000,00 or 
less per year may be made by the board without referring 
same to a vote of the electors. 

The chief executive officers of the divisional board 
are the secretary-treasurer and the superintendent. The for¬ 
mer is employed and paid by the divisional board. However, 
his appointment is subject to the approval of the Minister, 
a condition which gives a competent official a certain secur¬ 
ity of tenure. The secret ary-treasurer is, in effect, the 
business manager of the division; he attends to the routine 
business of the division and gives practical effect to the 
policies of the board. 

Unlike the divisional secretary-treasurer, the superin¬ 
tendent is not an employee of the divisional board. He holds 
his appointment from the Department of Education and is pri¬ 
marily an Inspector of Schools, in this capacity he exer¬ 
cises a certain jurisdiction over all of the schools in his 
inspectorate irrespective of whether they are in a school 
division or not. At the present time, all inspectorates are 
more or less coterminus with one, or in a few cases, two 
established divisions. With respect to the division or 




. . • *i■ o .. 








. 
































-7- 


divisions operating within the limits of his inspectorate, 
the inspector assumes the additional role of superintendent. 
Section 267 of THE SCHOOL ACT, which deals with the appoint¬ 
ment and duties of the superintendent, reads as follows: 

,r (l) Upon the constitution of a division, the Minister 
shall appoint a Superintendent for the division. 

(2) It shall be the duty of every such superintendent 
to confer with the Board of the division as to the 
educational requirements of the division and to 
advise the Board thereon; to attend all meetings 
of the Board, and subject to the direction of the 
Board, to exercise general supervision over all the 
schools, and teachers under the jurisdiction of the 
Board; and to assist the Board in the discharge 
of its duties." 

The superintendent draws no salary from the division 
and only in exceptional cases charges his travelling expenses 
to the division. Both his salary and expenses are borne by 
the Department of Education. This system of divisional 
superintendents is working out exceptionally well.

another class known as special grants. These are payable 
only by Order in Council. Insofar as divisions are concern¬ 
ed, payment of such grants is made only to those divisions 
which in the opinion of the Department would otherwise be 
unable to provide essential services without the imposition 
of tax rates beyond the ability of the ratepayers to pay 
taxes. 

The other principal source of a division's revenue is 
taxes. Divisional boards do not levy and collect taxes. 

Instead, they make requisitions on all of the municipal 
organizations in which are located in whole or in part any 
of the school districts incorporated in the division. The 
municipal organizations ordinarily affected are the rural 
municipal districts, and the local improvement districts, 
which latter are administered by the Department of Municipal 
Affairs. Town and village municipalities are not affected 
unless the corresponding town and village school districts 
have been included in the division. 

The divisional board after having decided how much of 
its total revenue for a given year must be raised by requi¬ 
sition, allocates this amount among the various municipal 
units in proportion to their respective assessed valuations 
for school taxation purposes. 

Previous to the advent of divisions, rural municipalities 
levied and collected the - taxes for most of the rural school 
districts established within their boundaries. However, each 
district's requisition was treated as a separate entity, and 
was met by a tax levy on that district adequate for the purpose. 






























' 















































- 10 - 


Under this system, school tax rates varied considerably from 
district to district within the same municipality. Under the 
divisional set-up, school taxes are levied at the same rate 
over the entire municipal area. 

Since a division's requisitions on its various collect¬ 
ing authorities are made at the same rate, the result is that 
final tax rates struck vary from one another only by the 
differences in margin allowed by the authorities for collec¬ 
tion. However, while tax rates within a given division vary 
but little, they can, and do, vary considerably from division 
to division.

CHAPTER IV 


INCLUSION OF TOWN, VILLAGE, CONSOLIDATED, AND 
SEPARATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN A DIVISION 

Once a division has been organized, its board may 
negotiate with the boards of the above types of districts 
with respect to their inclusion in the division. Such 
districts, if they enter a division at all, do so on the 
basis of special agreements, the chief features of which 
are the following: 

1. Since the cost of providing educational services in 
these districts is usually higher than that prevailing in 
the division, these districts are usually required to agree 
to the imposition on them of a certain additional requisi¬ 
tion in excess of that which would be levied on them from 
year to year in the ordinary manner. In other words, these 
districts pay extra for the extra services they enjoy or 
require. 

2. Agreements of inclusion are subject to the approval of 
the Minister. A vote on the matter must be taken if or 
more of the electors of the district whose inclusion in a 
division is proposed demand in writing that a vote be held. 

3. Once a town, village, consolidated, or separate school 
district has been formally included in a division, its in¬ 
clusion is as permanent as that of any other district already 
in the division. That is, it can be excluded only by special 
ministerial order. However, the terms of the agreement may 
be altered at intervals of three years.

CHAPTER V 


PROTECTION OF THE RIGHTS OF RELIGICUS MINORITIES 

If the board of a Protestant or Roman Catholic district 
included in a division feels that the divisional board is 
not making adequate provision for the religious instruction 
of the children of that district, it may petition the 
Minister for the exclusion of that district from the division. 
If after complying with certain statutory conditions, the 
district suc^eds in having itself taken out of the division, 
it cannot at any future date be included in a division with¬ 
out a favorable vote of the electors first having been ob¬ 
tained.

The organization of school districts into divisions is 
now complete. At the present time there is in the Province 
a total of 97 rural school districts not included in divi¬ 
sions. For the most part, these are relatively isolated 
districts that cannot be successfully administered from any 
of the existing divisional offices. 

Some minor changes in divisional boundaries may be 
expected. One or two of the smaller divisions possibly may 
be absorbed by neighboring divisions, while a similar num¬ 
ber of very large divisions may have to be subdivided. 
D istricts Subsequently Added . 

1. R ural ; Since they were originally organized, divisions 
have absorbed a relatively small number of rural

school districts. In most cases these have been new dis¬ 
tricts, organized after a division was established, and in¬ 
tended to serve what was unorganized territory lying near 
the division at the time of its formation. 

2. Town : Only one division out of 41 reporting on this 

point has absorbed a town school district. 

3. Village : of 41 divisions reporting, 10 have together 

absorbed 13 village school districts, dis¬ 
tributed as follows: 

8 Divisions have absorbed 1 village district each; 

1 Division has absorbed 2 village districts; 

1 Division has absorbed 3 village districts. 

4. Consolidated Districts : Some of these have been taken 

into divisions without being 
formally dissolved as consolidations in which cases they 
entered by specially negotiated agreements. In other cases, 
the consolidations were first dissolved. Then the resulting 
rural school districts units were simply incorporated into a 
division in the same manner as any other rural district would 
be. Of 41 divisions reporting, 6 have absorbed a total of 
17 consolidations, distributed as follows: 

3 Divisions have absorbed 1 consolidation each; 

1 Division has absorbed 3 consolidations; 

1 Division has absorbed 5 consolidations; 

1 Division has absorbed 6 consolidations. 

The total number of consolidations in effect in January, 1937, 
when the first divisions were organized, was 60.

Incidence of Towns and Villages as Educational 

Centres Within Divisional Areas . 

In practically every 
division are found one or more towns or villages where, 
usually, multiple-room schools are in operation. Even 
though these schools are not under the control of the divi¬ 
sion they are likely to be patronized by divisional pupils 
seeking high school instruction. 

1. T owns : Thirty-two out of 41 divisions report the 
presence of towns ranging in number from 1 to 6.

varies from 27 to 119. The median is 72. 


Extent of Divisions : Divisions vary considerably in their 

shapes and areas. If the terms 
“length 11 and “width” are used rather loosely here, it is 
found that the median length of divisions is 65 miles while 
the median width is 45 miles. The median number of town¬ 
ships covered by a division is 45, which represents an area 
of 1620 square miles.

CHAPTER Vll 


DIVISIONAL OFFICIALS 

jn umber of Trustees per Division . Forty-five divisions have 

boards of trustees con¬ 
sisting of five members. Four divisions have three-member 
boards, one division is administered by an official trustee, 
who is also its superintendent. 

Occupation of Trustees . The destinies of the school divi¬ 
sions, like those of the rural 
school districts of which they are composed, are definitely 
in the hands of trustees drawn from the rural population of 
the Province. Reports from 41 divisions show that no less 
than 86% of the divisional trustees are actively engaged in 
farming. Eight per cent are engaged in business. The re¬ 
maining 6% is made up of retired persons and housewives. 
Divisional Board Meetings . According to reports received 

from 39 divisions, the number 
of board meetings held in 1941 varied from 6 to 13 in num¬ 
ber. The median number of meetings was 10. beventy-three 
per cent of these meetings were of one day's duration, 
while 25% of the meetings lasted two days. Meetings last¬ 
ing more than two days constituted only 2% of the total. 

In 1941, divisional trustees devoted from 7 to 24 days 
of their time to attendance at board meetings. The median 
number of days spent at meetings was 12. 

Reports from 39 divisions show that the allowances 
paid to trustees for attendance at meetings are almost

invariably at the maximum rates allowed by the School Act, 
viz., $5.00 per day and per mile travelled to and from 
meetings. 

The cost of holding a board meeting varies consider¬ 
ably from division to division. This is due to wide varia¬ 
tions in the distances the trustees have to travel. In 1941, 
the costs of holding one-day board meetings, as reported by 
37 divisions, each having boards of five trustees, varied 
from $37.00 to $74.00, with the median cost occurring at 
$47.00. 

Rates of Allowances to Trustees for Divisional Work 

Other Than Attendance at Meetings and Conventions . 

Reports from 39 divisions show that trustees invariably 
are paid mileage allowances for any necessary travelling 
they do in attending to divisional business in their sub¬ 
divisions. The rates are almost always 8^ per mile. Of 
the 39 divisions, 16 pay no subsistence allowances to trus¬ 
tees when engaged in such work. Among the other 23 divi¬ 
sions, rates range from "actual expenses" to as high as 
$5.00 per day. For the 19 divisions that reported fixed 
rates, the median rate allowed was $3.00 per day. 

Total Payments to Trustees . Table IV below has been pre¬ 
pared in order that the actual 
implications of the rates quoted thus far may be noted. 

This Table gives some idea of the magnitude of the total 
payments made to divisional trustees in the period from 
January 1st to October 31st, 1941. It is based on data 
supplied by 37 divisions, each having five-member boards.

For a 12-month period, payments for board meetings would 
be roughly 20^ greater. Those for supervision and conven¬ 
tions would not be appreciably greater as no conventions are 
held in the fall, and supervision during these months is not 
extensive. Payments for a 12-month period estimated on the 
basis of the figures given in Table IV would likely be as

D ivisional Secretaries . Of 41 divisions reporting on this 

matter, 34 have full-time secretary- 
treasurers. The annual salaries of these officials range 
from $1,000.00 to $1,600.00, with the median salary being 
$1,275.00. 

In the seven divisions that reported part-time secretary- 
treasurers, the salaries ranged from $450.00 to $840.00. Two 
of these divisions, each paying $840.00 to part-time secreta¬ 
ries, have full-time assistants who receive $600.00 and 
(#) Not the sums of the preceding amounts.

$700.00 respectively, so that total salaries in these divi¬ 
sions are actually $1,440.00 and $1,540.00. Four of the 34 
divisions that reported full-time secretaries, also reported 
full-time assistants, whose salaries ranged from $500.00 to 
$900.00. In these four divisions the total salaries paid to 
the secretaries and their assistants were $2,500.00, $2,200.00, 
$2,040.00 and $1,850.00. 

Variations in the size of divisional office staffs, and 
in the salaries paid to them, reflect variations in the ser¬ 
vices rendered by the central office. There are a few divi¬ 
sions where the secretary seems to be little more than a 
bookkeeper. On the other hand, there are divisions where the 
bookkeeping, while assuming the proportions of a sizable job 
in itself, is still a minor activity of the secret ary-treas¬ 
urer, whose main function is that of general business manager, 
in which capacity he may be largely responsible for the 
efficient management of such ancillary services as vans and 
pupil transportation, dormitories, centralized buying and 
distribution of supplies, etc.

Table V, which follows, was compiled from data supplied 
by 40 divisions. It shows the numbers and types of division¬ 
ally controlled schools operating in 1941, and gives similar 
data for these same areas for the years in which these 40 
divisions were organized. Schools operating in the division¬ 
al areas, but in districts not actually forming part of the 
divisions, are not included.

Two trends are noticeable here: Cl) A reduction in the 
number of one-room schools in operation, and a corresponding 
increase in the number of multiple-room schools; (2) a sharp 
reduction in the number of one-room schools attempting to 
offer high school instruction.

Kevised high school regulations, and not the advent 
of divisions, have tended to practically eliminate the teach¬ 
ing of high school courses in one-room rural schools. How¬ 
ever, the first of the trends noted above has fitted in 
nicely with Departmental policies, and has given them a 
certain amount of practical implementation. 

The reduction in the number of one-room schools in 
operation has been brought about in two ways. First, divi¬ 
sional boards have shut down quite a number of one-room 
schools operating in sparsely settled districts, and have 
provided for the children bf these districts in neighboring 
schools. This type of consolidation was not feasible under 
the small district type of administration for the simple 
reason that the local boards generally could not agree as to 
whose school should be closed. Forty divisions report the 
shutting down of a total of 345 one-room schools. In 166 
cases, pupils have been provided for in other one-room schools. 
In 179 cases, the pupils now find themselves in multiple-room 
schools. A second way in which the number of one-room schools 
has been reduced has been by converting a number of such 
schools into two-room schools. Forty divisions report 63 
cases of this. 

C lassrooms in Operation . The trend away from ungraded towards 

graded classroom conditions that has 
taken place in the 40 divisions already referred to is further 
emphasized in Table VI.

New Construction . The erection of even a one-room school was 

always a momentous undertaking for the 
small school district, and for the most part was possible 
only when the sale of debentures was possible. During the 
decade that preceded 1937, the sale of school district deben¬ 
tures became increasingly difficult with the result that 
school building programmes were sharply curtailed. With the 
advent of divisions in 1937 came a sharp increase in the num¬ 
ber of new schools and classrooms being erected each year. 

The change was made possible, not so much by reason of the 
fact that divisions could sell debentures where local dis¬ 
tricts could not, as that they operated on a much larger 
scale than did the local districts and were thus able to 
“squeeze" out of their annual revenues the thousands of 
dollars required to build a few new schools or classrooms 
each year. Table VII, compiled from the reports of 41 
divisions, shows the number of new schools and classrooms 
erected by these divisions since they were organized.

In addition to the above 322 classrooms erected by the 
divisions, towns and villages within divisional areas have 
provided another 54 classrooms as the direct result of in¬ 
creased enrolments at those points brought about by the 
divisions’ provision of van services, dormitories, etc. 

Capital Expenditure by Divisions . Perhaps the- most remark¬ 
able feature of the divi¬ 
sions’ capital expenditure programmes is the large percent¬ 
age of it that has been financed out of current revenue. 
Thirty-eight divisions, over half of which have been organ¬ 
ized three years or less, report total capital expenditures 
amounting to $798,000.00 of which $603,100.00 or 75.5^ has 
been financed from current revenue. The remaining 24. dfo 
has been financed through the sale of debentures. Several 
reasons might be advanced in explanation and justification 
of this state of affairs. (1) It has been, and still is, 
quite difficult to sell debentures. (2) The annual capital

expenditure of individual divisions has not been very great. 
In very few cases has it exceeded #5,000.00 or #6,000.00 per 
year, it is really no more difficult for a division to 
build one or two classrooms per year on a pay-as-you-go 
basis than to finance 15 or 20 on the instalment plan, 
through the sale of debentures. 13) Many divisional trus¬ 
tees have been trustees of small districts that at one time 
or another sold debentures for the purpose of erecting a 
school, and they still have vivid memories of what their 
schools really cost their districts by the time the last 
coupons were paid.

CHAPTER IX 


TEACHERS 1 SALARIES 

Conditions with respect to the payment and general level 
of teachers' salaries have improved very considerably under 
the system of divisional administration. Divisional teachers 
definitely are getting their salaries and getting them 
promptly. With divisions came salary schedules which at 
least assured teachers that their salaries would no longer 
be determined by the relative wealth or poverty of the par¬ 
ticular districts in which they happened to be teaching. 
Finally, the reduction in the number of administrative 
boards has given teachers a golden opportunity to press for 
better salaries through collective bargaining procedures. 

Tables Showing Upward Salary Trends . The next three tables, 

Tables VIII, IX and X 

have been prepared from data supplied by 32 divisions. Each 
of these divisions reported the lowest, the highest, and the 
average salary being paid to teachers within its area, first 
in the year the division was organized, and second, in 
February of 1942. Since these divisions were not all organ¬ 
ized in the same year, it was considered advisable to group 
them according to the year in which they were organized, and 
to summarize the data for each group separately. In the 
next three Tables the reference to groups is as follows: 

Group A - Divisions organized in 1937 
Group B - Divisions organized in 1938 
Group C - Divisions organized in 1939 
Group D - Divisions organized in 1940 and 1941.

The above Tables show quite definitely that the average 
salaries paid to teachers employed in divisions have in¬ 
creased substantially during the last five years. The ques¬ 
tion now arises: Is this increase in the salaries of rural 
teachers attributable to any extent to the advent of the 
divisional system of administration, or does it simply re¬ 
flect an upward trend in salaries that happened to set in 
just about the time the first divisions were being organized? 
In this connection it is interesting to compare the average 
salaries paid to rural school teachers since 1937 by school 
divisions, and by rural districts not included in divisions. 
This comparison is established in Table XI, which is based 
on information appearing in the annual reports of the 
Department of Education.

This Table shows that the salaries of rural school 
teachers in both non-divisional and divisional schools have 
increased since 1936, but that the increase has been greater 
in divisions. It shows that the average salary of rural 
teachers in non-divisional schools in the school year 1940- 
41 was about 6.above that paid in 1936-37, while the 
average divisional salary paid in 1940-41 was about 11.5 
above that paid in 1936-37. 

It may be argued that the above comparison is not fair 
to the rural districts not included in divisions for the 
reason that they became fewer in number as the organization 
of divisions continued, and represented for the most part 
the more remote and isolated districts where salaries al¬ 
ways are somewhat depressed. The implication in this 
argument is that salaries of rural teachers would have in¬ 
creased during the last five years even if the divisions 
had not been organized, and that the increase might have

been almost as great as that noted in divisions. This argu¬ 
ment, based as it is on "what might have happened", seems to 
be a rather specious one. A more tenable argument would be 
that the organization of divisions has not only brought 
about an improvement in the salaries of divisional teachers 
themselves, but that it has also brought the salaries of 
non-divisional rural teachers to a level that would not have 
been reached if divisions had not been organized. 

The salary curves given in Figure 1, page 30, seem to 
support this view. These curves show the trends of average 
salaries of a number of classes of teachers in Alberta for 
the five-year period 1934-35 to 1939-40. It will be noted 
that the average salaries of town and city, and urban (#) 
teachers have remained quite constant since the year 1936-37. 
On the other hand, the average salaries of teachers working 
in rural areas, whether in villages or rural districts proper, 
show an appreciable upward movement from the year 1936-37, 
the year in which the first divisions were organized. The 
distinctly different behaviour of the curves for these two 
classes of teachers, the town and city, and urban teachers, 
as against the village and rural teachers, suggests strongly 
that some factor favoring improvement of salaries was opera¬ 
ting in the rural areas after the year 1936-37, a factor 
apparently not found in town, city, and urban areas. It is 
suggested here that this factor was the organization of the 
rural districts into divisions, a concomitant of which was 

(#) As used here, "urban" includes all classes of teachers 
except "rural" teachers.

better salaries for rural teachers working in the divisions. 
As the salaries of these teachers rose, so did those of 
other rural teachers working in districts not included in 
divisions. 


A verage Salaries in Divisions 1941-42 : The data given thus 

far in this discus¬ 
sion of teachers' salaries have been presented in such a 
manner as to emphasize salary trends. Before we conclude 
this section, it would be advisable to give a concise state¬ 
ment respecting the present status of teachers' salaries in 
divisions. 

The following tabulation has reference only to teachers 
in one-room rural schools, and is based on reports from 32 
divisions employing a total of 1673 teachers in this type of 
school. 


Lowest salary reported $ 706.00 

Highest salary reported $1080.00 


Median of lowest salaries reported $ 775.00 
Median of highest salaries reported $ 930.00 


Average salary - 1673 teachers 


858.00 


Reports from 29 divisions employing a total of 245 
teachers in graded schools (high school teachers not included) 
show that the average salary being paid to this class of 
teachers is $963.00. 

The average salary of 64 high school teachers employed 
by 26 divisions is $1177.00.

HIGH SCHOOL SERVICES 


E nrolment Trends : The following table is intended to give 

some idea of the distribution of pupils 
in attendance at divisional schools for the years 1938 to 
1941. Since divisions were staggered in their organization, 
the data for successive years are based on steadily increas¬ 
ing numbers.

A study of the enrolment figures submitted shows that 
the total enrolment of pupils in attendance at divisional 
schools varied very little in the years 1938-41. For instance, 
in one group of divisions numbering 20 in all, and having a 
total enrolment of about 32,000 pupils, the variation in 
total enrolment over the three year period from 1939 to 1941 
was less than 400 pupils. 

This being the case, it might reasonably be concluded 
from a study of the percentage distributions shown in 
Table XII that: Cl) the enrolment of pupils in the elementary

grades is holding very steady; (2) there is a falling off 
in the number of pupils in the intermediate grades, the 
percentage here showing a decrease from 24% in 1938 to 
22 .Qjo in 1941; (3) many pupils who formerly were wont to 

mark time in the intermediate grades are now found in high 
school where the percentage of the total enrolled has 
risen from 7.3% to 8.5%. 

Absolute Increase in High School Enrolment . Data on this 

point are not 

readily available. Using the figures in Table XII, we can 
say that 34 divisions, having a total population of about 
53,000 pupils now have about 1.2% more pupils enrolled in 
high school grades than were found in their respective 
areas in 1937. This represents an increase of about 635 
pupils. What of the other 14 divisions that were operating 
in 1941 but for which no data are available? Using the 
enrolment figures for divisions as found in the Annual 
Keport of the Department of Education for 1940, we may 
fairly assume that the minimum number of pupils enrolled 
in the schools of the 48 divisions operating in 1941 was 
about 76,000. On this basis we might assume that in 1941 
there were about 910 more divisional pupils in high school 
than would have been found there in 1937. The true figure 
is likely a little greater than 910, for the Departmental 
figures referred to above do not include divisional pupils 
enrolled in non-divisional schools.

Wh at Divisions are Doing to Extend High bchool Facilities . 

1. P ayment of Grade XII Tuition Fees : Although not 
obliged to do so, divisional boards, without exception, are 
paying part or all of the grade XII tuition fees levied by 
town and village schools on account of divisional pjipils in 
attendance thereat. The vast majority of boards are paying 
up to ^40.00 per year for such pupils, which is the maximum 
fee ordinarily charged. In pre-divisional days, most rural 
school boards declined to pay the fees of their Grade XII 
pupils. The result was that relatively few pupils from 
rural districts took grade XII. 

2. Provision of Van bervlces : As a general rule, divi¬ 
sions have not inaugurated van services solely for the 
specific purpose of conveying high school pupils from rural 
districts to high school centres. However, several divi¬ 
sions have deemed it advisable, and found it feasible, to 
shut down a number of one-room schools in their areas, and 
are transporting all the pupils from these schools to certain 
school centres. The resulting concentration of pupils at 
these points has made possible, of course, the operation of 
multiple-room schools, some of considerable size, invariably 
the arrangement has resulted in an increased number of 
pupils reaching high school. The matter of van services will 
be treated more fully in Chapter XI. 

3. Erection of Dormitories : Most divisions find it 
financially and physically impossible to effect any large- 
scale consolidation of schools. In increasing numbers, the

boards of these divisions are meeting the demand for in¬ 
creased opportunities for high school instruction by erect¬ 
ing dormitories at strategically located points within the 
division. 

Towns and villages, even though not actually included 
in a division, are favored as locations for dormitories 
for the reason that more or less adequate high school 
facilities usually already exist at these points, .aven in 
a village that boasts only a one-room high school there is 
a certain number of high school pupils that can be counted 
on from year to year. The erection of a dormitory at such 
a point immediately brings with it the prospect of a two- 
room high school and of better educational services for 
both village and divisional pupils. 

As indicated, the erection of a dormitory in a town 
or village usually works out to the mutual advantage of 
both parties involved in the arrangement. The town or 
village district derives a considerable revenue from the 
fees paid on account of the divisional pupils, while the 
division in its turn generally has its pupils educated at 
a very moderate per pupil cost. Kven if a town- or village 
finds it necessary to erect an additional room or two to 
accommodate the influx of high school pupils occasioned by 
the erection of a dormitory, it usually considers the 
arrangement satisfactory from its point of view, for it 
thereby comes to enjoy the services of a sizable high school 
at a cost within its means.

This topic of dormitory services is discussed more 
fully in Chapter XII. 

4. Conveyance Allowances : a few divisions have adopted 
the policy of making cash allowances to high school stu¬ 
dents toenable them to provide themselves with some form 
of transportation to and from school. 

5. Hoorn and Board Allowances : A few other divisions nay 
cash allowances to their high school pupils to help them 
defray costs of room and board. Monthly allowances range 
from $2.00 to $6.00, with $5.00 being a common figure. 

The number of pupils being helped in this manner is 
relatively very small. 

6. Provision of Instruction by Correspondence : v/hen all 
other means of getting a pupil into high school fail, divi¬ 
sions are wont to turn to correspondence courses. They 
are also using these to supplement classroom instruction 
in the smaller schools where only partial programmes are 
offered, or where certain subjects desired by pupils in a 
given year are not being taught. 

The total enrolment of high school pupils in corre¬ 
spondence courses in 1941 as reported by 40 divisions was 
as follows: 


Pupils taking their work entirely 
by correspondence 


695 


Pupils supplementing classroom 
instruction by correspondence

-tirely the cost of their pupils' correspondence courses. 
Those divisions that do not pay in full for such courses, 
do pay in most cases up to $30.00 for pupils in Grades X 
and XI, and up to $40.00 for pupils in Grade XII. These 
are the maximum tuition fees usually paid for pupils in 
these grades. Payment of these amounts will in most cases 
cover the entire correspondence fees incurred by a single 
pupil in a year. Practically, therefore, the divisions 
are paying the entire costs of their pupils' correspondence 
courses. 

An indication of the extent to which divisions are 
endeavouring to place high school facilities at the dis¬ 
posal of their pupils is to be found in the fact that 38 
divisions report that in the school year 1941-42 their total 
estimated expenditures for high school services, exclusive 
of van services and services provided in their own schools, 
will amount to $112,825.00. 

Increase in the Number of Schools 

Offering High School Instruction . 

Further evidence of the contribution divisions have 
ma.de towards a more abundant provision of high school facil¬ 
ities is found in the increase that has occurred since 1937 
in the number of schools offering high school instruction. 
Table XIII has been prepared from reports received from 33 
divisions and includes all high schools, both divisional 
and non-divisional, operating within the divisional areas. 

X\ion-divisional schools have been included for the reason 
that they are patronized extensively by divisional pupils. 
Note the increase in the number of schools teaching Grade XH.

CHAPTEK XI 


VAN SERVICES 


Incidence of Van Services . Out of 41 divisions reporting 

on this matter, 21 operate one 
or more vars. Only six of these divisions have pone into 
van services so extensively as to indicate that they are 
following a definite plan of consolidating schools and cen¬ 
tralizing instruction. The other 15 divisions use small 
numbers of vans which apparently have been put into service 
to cope with special local problems or to effect small- 
scale consolidations of school plants. The divisions making 
most extensive use of van services are all found in the 
southern part of the Province where road conditions are 
fairly good the year round. 

Table XV supplies data concerning the van services 
provided by the six divisions making the most extensive 
use of vans.

indicated by its assessment per classroom. Physical condi¬ 
tions and the policy of the board seem to be the determinants 
A study of the grade placement of the pupils carried in 
the vans shows that by far the most of them are pupils in the 
elementary and intermediate grades. In other words, the vans 
do not operate as a sort of deluxe high school service. They 
seem to function in the interests of centralization of in¬ 
struction, which, of course, ministers to improved high 
school facilities and to increased high school enrolments. 

Comparative Tables . The next four Tables have been prepared 

from data supplied by 21 divisions which 
together operate 111 motor vans, 23 horse-drawn vans, and 27 
private cars. These Tables will serve to give some idea of 
the actual conditions under which these vans operate.

Motor vans, because of their greater capacity and conse¬ 
quent ability to travel greater distances seem to provide the 
most economical type of van service. Eorse-drawn vans appear* 
to be the most costly in terms of per-pupil-per-mile costs. 
Where private cars are used, costs are likely to fluctuate a 
great deal, but on the whole, private cars seem to provide 
about as cheap a type of service as horse-drawn vans. They 
have this in their favor that they are more comfortable and 
more expeditious. 

Another conclusion that the above data seem to warrant 
is that large-scale consolidations of school plants can be 
effected economically in only those divisions where road 
conditions and the density of population make the use of

motor vans practicable. 

Generally speaking, divisions do not own their van 
equipment. Exceptions to this rule are the Lethbridge 
Division which owns 15 of the 45 motor vans that it oper¬ 
ates, and the E. I. D. Division which owns 7 horse-drawn 
vans.

CHAPTER XII 


DOKivil TORIES 

The establishment of dormitories at key points v/ithin 
a division is a service very characteristically divisional. 
Unlike van services, the establishment of dormitories has 
been very closely associated with the divisions’ efforts 
to extend high school facilities; and unlike van services, 
dormitories are found scattered all over the Province. 

Of 41 divisions reporting on this matter, 17 provide 
dormitories - 22 dormitories in all. Sixteen of these divi¬ 
sions assume direct responsibility for the support and con¬ 
trol of their dormitories. The seventeenth supplies the 
building, fuel, light and water, but has turned over the 
actual administration and management of the dormitory to a 
committee of ratepayers from the districts adjacent to that 
in which the dormitory is located. 

In a little better than half of the cases, the dormi¬ 
tory buildings are owned by the divisions. Total capacity 
of the 22 dormitories referred to above is 669. Present 
enrolment is 587. The dormitories vary in size from 10-to 
90-pupil capacity. 

All dormitories seem to have certain common adminis¬ 
trative features. Pupils supply their own bedding, and are 
required to help with such tasks as sweeping, dusting, wash¬ 
ing dishes, waiting on table, preparing vegetables for 
cooking, etc. ho credit is allowed on board for these latter 
services, hone of the dormitories provides a complete

laundry service. In a number of cases, the division has 
placed an electric washing machine in the dormitory for the 
use of the pupils. In the other cases, pupils send or take 
their laundry home. 

In 13 of the 17 divisions where dormitories were report¬ 
ed in operation, produce is accepted from pupils in part pay¬ 
ment of room and board. The amount of produce thus accepted 
varies from as low as 2% to as high as 40%. 

The size of the staff employed to operate the dormitor¬ 
ies, and their duties vary considerably. Following are 
brief statements of some typical arrangements: 

A. 33 pupils registered. Married couple hired at $60.00 
per month. These latter do a little work. Dormitory 
is subject to regulations of Divisional Board acting 
on advice of Superintendent, who supervises it 
closely. 

B. 20 pupils registered. Matron hired. Supervises and 
prepares menus, cooks meals, supervises study periods 
two hours per night except week-ends. Exercises 
general supervision over building and pupils. 

G. 25 pupils registered. Matron - cooks, supervises 

girls and has general care of building. Boys 1 Super ¬ 
visor - also attends to repairs and improvements. 

D. 10 pupils registered. Teacher and wife look after 
dormitory. Former supervises play, studies, and 
discipline. Latter cooks, supervises housework and 
the girls - 

E. 24 pupils registered. Full-time cook hired. Female 
and male supervisors for girls and boys. 

Hates being charged at these dormitories vary from $6.00 
to $15.00 per month. In the cases of only 7 of the 22 dormi¬ 
tories are the rates described as adequate to meet costs of 
operation. Two of the rates reported as adequate are $8.00 
and $9.00 per month. All other rates reported as adequate

are #11.50 or higher. The general consensus of opinion 
seems to be that a monthly rate of from #11.50 to #12.00 
should be adequate to meet costs. 

It is a fact, of course, that some, if not all of the 
divisions that are levying inadequate rates are doing so 
quite knowingly and deliberately and are following a 
definite policy of subsidizing their dormitories. 
























































CHAPTER XIII 


PROVISION OF CLASSROOM SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT 

Out of a total of 41 divisions reporting on this matter, 

36 provide supplies such as pencils, rulers, erasers, work books, 
etc. for the use of individual pupils. Seventeen divisions pro¬ 
vide these supplies to their pupils entirely free of charge; 18 
supply them at cost; and one makes a nominal charge. 

In addition to supplies intended for the use of individual 
pupils, such as the items mentioned above, divisions are making 
more or less extensive provision of supplies intended for the 
general use of the pupils attending their schools - supplies 
such as foolscap, art and construction paper, scisoors, paste, 
plasticine, etc. The total number of items of classroom supplies 
provided varies a good deal from division to division. Table XX 
below gives some information on this point, and also shows what 
the divisions report as being the cost per pupil of these sup¬ 
plies for a year. The data supplied by divisions with respect 
to the cost per pupil of supplies do not appear to be very reli¬ 
able. The cost figures given in Table XX should not be taken 
as anything more than a crude approximation to the actual cost.

The best that can be said on the basis of the in¬ 
formation supplied in Table XX is that divisions are pro¬ 
viding from 10 to 80 items of classroom supplies at a cost 
of from $1.00 to $2.00 per pupil. 

Thirty of the 41 divisions purchase their supplies 
entirely or almost entirely by tender; ten buy from 
certain firms with whom they are accustomed to deal; and 
orje buys supplies locally. 

Only three of the 41 divisions report that they supply 
text-books for their pupils. One division rents text-books 
to pupils in Grades I to XII at charges ranging from 75^ 
to $2.00 per set of books per year. Another rents text¬ 
books to pupils in Grades 7 and 8 at $1.00 per set per year. 
The third division provides books free of charge to pupils 
in Grades I to IX. 

Divisions have also been active in improving and adding 
to their classroom equipment. The following purchases have 
been made by 41 divisions since they were organized. (Over 
half of these divisions have been organized for three years 
or less.)

CHAPTER XIV 


LIBRARY SERVICES 

New Bo oks Purchased . Twenty-six divisions report that since 

their organization they have purchased 
a total of 82,250 library and reference books. On this 
basis it is probably safe to say that the total of new books 
purchased by all divisions combined would be in the neighbor¬ 
hood of from 125,000 to 150,000, The total spent by 39 divi¬ 
sions on library books since the time of their organization 
is reported as aggregating $112,200.00. 

Circulation of Books . A form of library service that has 

sprung up under divisional adminis¬ 
tration is that of the circulating school library. Of the 
41 divisions reporting, 35 have established some system 
whereby certain classes of books are circulated through the 
schools. Generally speaking, books are circulated according 
to a schedule determined by the divisional superintendent. 

In most cases, the books are taken from school to school by 
the teachers at little or no cost to the division. 

Two divisions report that they have made arrangements 
with municipal libraries whereby the books in these libraries 
are made available for circulation through the schools. The 
most outstanding example of this type of arrangement is found 
in the case of the Lethbridge Division which has enlisted 
the services of the Lethbridge Public Library. The Division 
pays $10.00 per year per classroom for this service. Boxes 
of books are issued about every two months, and after passing 
successively through two or three schools are returned to 
the library.

CHAPTER XV 


HEALTH SERVICES 

To date, the boards of most divisions have found it 
necessary to confine their efforts mostly to providing or 
improving the basic educational services and facilities of 
their respective areas. Gradually, however, these matters 
are being taken care of, and boards are turning their atten¬ 
tion to the problem of health services. At the present time, 
about half of the divisions are providing more or less ade¬ 
quate health services. 

The divisions enjoying the most comprehensive programmes 
of health services are those eight or ten located in areas 
served by Alberta Health Units. Health units are adminis¬ 
trative units quite distinct from school divisions. Their 
boundaries are not necessarily coterminus with those of 
divisions, but may be so. Health units operate on a budget, 
one half of which is provided by the Department of Health 
and one half by taxation. 

These health units provide a number of services of a 
preventive nature. Of these, the following are of most 
interest to divisional authorities: The regular examination 
of children of pre-school and school age; the vaccination 
and inoculation of these children as required; and the 
preparation of comprehensive health records. 

Divisional boards have been quick to see that the 
health unit constitutes a most satisfactory solution to the 
health services problem. During the past two years, a number 
of divisional boards have actively sponsored movements that

have resulted in the formation of health units with bounda¬ 
ries coterminus with those of their divisions. In these 
cases, the divisions are providing that half of the health 
unit’s budget that ordinarily would be raised by taxation. 

The divisions in their turn, add these amounts to their 
budgets and requisition for them in the usual way. 

It is not unreasonable to suppose that as time goes on, 
and as funds become available, more and more divisions will 
sponsor the formation of health units to serve their 
respective divisional areas. 

At the present time, a number of divisions that do not 
have sufficient funds to sponsor health units, are endeav¬ 
oring to cope with the problem of health services by avail¬ 
ing themselves of the services of local practitioners and 
of Provincial District Health Nurses. Some typical arrange¬ 
ments , made by different divisional boards, are given below: 

Division A : Has a two-year contract with a local 

practitioner who is to examine all children 
once and vaccinate and inoculate those desiring this service. 
Cost - $1,250.00 for the two years. 

Division B : Local practitioners give physical examin¬ 
ation and immunize pupils for $2.50 per 
pupil. 

Division C : Two District Health Nurses visit regularly 
all schools in their respective areas, 
examine the children, vaccinate and inoculate them, and 
prepare good records, which are kept at the divisional office. 
The division simply pays for the nurses' transportation. This 
division has also arranged with local doctors and dentists 
to provide certain types of professional services at nominal 
rates to bona fide pupils on the recommendation of the nurses. 
The pupils visit the doctors' offices on certain specified 
days. 


Division D : Has worked out a schedule with local 
practitioners whereby every school is 
visited once in four years. Children of school age, and

pre-school age, are examined and immunized. The fees agreed 
upon are $60.00 per school, if the school is within 10 miles 
of the doctor's office; otherwise they are $75.00. 

Division E : Local practitioners inoculate and vaccinate 
pupils at a fee of 500 per pupil. Doctor's 
mileage and nurses' fees are extra. 

A small number of divisions have undertaken to supply 
cod liver oil and vitamin capsules to their pupils. One 
division supplies these only during a period of 2 £ months 
during the winter. Other divisions seem to supply these 
during the entire year, or at least as long as their use is 
deemed advisable. The cost of these capsules appears to be 
from 450 to 600 per hundred.

CHAPTER XVI 


LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT LIABILITIES ASSUMED BY DIVISIONS 

A study of Table XXI will afford some idea of the load 
of debts bequeathed to the divisions by the local districts 
and will also show to what extent the divisions have been 
successful in paying off these debts.

above Table was prepared are 20 that have been functioning 
for only three years or less. The record of these divisions 
in reducing their inherited liabilities by about half a 
million dollars whilst at the same time financing their own 
operations is, indeed, quite remarkable. It should be noted, 
however, that most of the arrears of teachers' salaries were 
paid off with the aid of special grants from the Department 
of Education. 

It will be noticed that the item of loans shows relative

ly the smallest reduction. A word of explanation would be 
in order. Most of these loans were made to districts in the 
drought areas of the Province, areas known officially as 
Special Areas. These loans were guaranteed by the Province. 
With the advent of divisions, the practice of making such 
loans was discontinued anci special grants were paid instead. 
It is quite likely that these loans will eventually be 
written off by the Province.

CHAPTER XVII 


THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM 

Thus far we have been attempting to describe the record 
of Alberta school divisions. We have shown how in from three 
to five years they have effected a sizable reduction in the 
heavy burden of debt handed to them ^y the local districts; 
how they have carried forward substantial building programmes; 
how they have improved the financial status of their teachers, 
extended high school facilities through the inauguration of 
van services and the provision of dormitories, improved 
school libraries, and added to the equipment of their schools. 
All this the divisions have done without accumulating a new 
burden of debt. The question now arises: What is the general 
financial situation in the divisions? How is all of this 
affecting the taxpayer? We now turn to a consideration of 
these matters. 

In Table XXII below are assembled certain data pertinent 
to divisional assessments, mill rates and grants. This Table 
is based on information supplied by 38 divisions. The in¬ 
formation has been summarized for divisions grouped according 
to their average assessments per classroom. 

Attention is directed to the fact that there is a spread 
of $100,000.00 in per classroom assessments between the first 
two groups of divisions reported. The unusually high assess¬ 
ment per classroom of the division reported in the first 
group is due to the fact that this division has shut down 
some 30 one-room schools and is using vans and cars to take

The median of all 1941 school mill rates imposed by the 
various collecting authorities of the above 38 divisions was 
12, while the third quartile rate was 14.5. 

It will be noticed that the ratio between the lowest and 
the highest assessments per classroom is approximately i:10. 
However, the ratio between the lowest and the highest mill 
rates in 1941 was only ls4.3* The fact that mill raoes are 
being kept within such relatively narrow limits in spite of

extreme variations in assessments per classroom is due in 
large part to the Province's system of equalization grants 
(See page 8). Further control has been applied to mill 
rates by the payment of special grants to divisions having 
average assessments below $90,000.00 per classroom. Table 
XXII shows very clearly that divisions with average assess¬ 
ments of below $85,000.00 per classroom are receiving much 
greater grant assistance than those with higher assessments. 

The total amount of special grants paid annually by 
the Province to school districts has shown a steady rise 
since 1937, and is accounted for by the fact that divisional 
boards have been able to make the Province realize that 
greater and greater support for education must come from 
sources of revenue lying outside of the divisional taxing 
areas. Herein seems to lie one of the greatest virtues of 
the divisional system of administration. The reduction in 
the number of administrative bodies has enabled those that 
are in power to exert considerably more pressure on the 
educational authorities of the Province in the matter of 
securing more Provincial aid for education than the thou¬ 
sands of small-district boards were ever able to do. While 
Alberta does not have as yet a Province-wide basis for the 
support of education, she undoubtedly took a long step in 
that direction when she committed herself to the larger 
unit of school administration. 

Anyone who is familiar with conditions as they exist 
under the local district system of administration knows of 
the wide fluctuation in mill rates that are wont to occur

from district to district lying in even the same neighbor¬ 
hood. At the present time the variation in mill rates within 
a given division in Alberta is relatively quite small, as 
Table XXIII shows. This Table is based on reports from 34 
divisions. 

Variations up to about 2.5 mills are to be expected, 
and can be accounted for by the variations in the margins 
allowed by the collection authorities for non-collection 
of taxes.

Variations of over 2.5 mills are usually accounted for 
by the fact that when a village is included in a division 
it is required to pay taxes at a higher rate than the 
strictly rural areas of the division. 

Table XXIV below attempts to make a comparison between 
the mill rates levied in 36 divisions in 1941 and those 
levied in the same areas the year immediately preceding that

in which they were organized. Some of the original data 
submitted in connection with mill rates that prevailed in 
the year preceding the organization of the divisions may 
not have been any too accurate. However, it is felt that 
the comparison shown in Table XXIV is a good deal more 
reliable than those often made by certain vocal ratepayers 
who, generalizing from a few specific instances have claimed 
that mill rates have sky-rocketed under the divisional set¬ 
up.

On the other hand, the Table does show that school tax 
mill rates have gone up by as much as 3.5 mills in some divi¬ 
sions over what they were the year before the divisions were 
set up. In terms of the rates originally levied, these

increases are quite appreciable in some instances. 

There seems to be no point in arguing whether larger 
units of* administration can operate schools more cheaply 
than small units. No responsible person is interested in 
seeing how cheaply, in an absolute sense, schools can be 
operated. The objective is to secure the maximum service 
possible in terms of the resources available in the area 
served and the ability of the people to support it. Divi¬ 
sions are spending more money than the local districts, not 
because they are an inefficient type of organization, but 
because they are doing things that local districts could not 
do, or could not bring themselves to do. They have provided 
a decent minimum of educational service in a great many rural- 
districts that could not maintain even such a service, and 
in addition they have brought improved services to many 
rather well-to-do districts whose local boards in the past 
either lacked the vision necessary for progress, or were 
handicapped in their efforts to progress by the inadequacies 
inherent in the small unit type of administration. 

Payment of Requisitions . Inability to collect taxes was the 

chief reason why many local dis¬ 
tricts in the more recently settled portions of the Province 
found it difficult or impossible to operate their schools 
successfully. How have collections been under the divisional 
set-up? This information is not directly available to divi¬ 
sions, since they are spending, not collecting agencies. 

What does concern divisions, however, is how successfully

requisitions are paid. Collecting authorities do not have 
unlimited credit. Their success in paying divisional re¬ 
quisitions may be taken, therefore, as a rough measure of 
their success in collecting school taxes. 

Reports from 40 divisions indicate that on December 
31, 1941, there was a total of $67,890.00 owing to them on 
account of unpaid requisitions. This amount represents 
2.5% of the 1941 requisitions made by these divisions. The 
above arrears of requisitions were owing to actually only 
12 divisions, that is, to about 30% of those reporting. 

These arrears represented 9% of the combined requisitions 
of the 12 divisions for 1941. Table XXV gives some inter¬ 
esting information about these 12 divisions. The last 
column of this Table shows for each division the ratio be¬ 
tween its 1941 grants and the total of its 1941 grants and 
requisitions. Since grants and requisitions make up almost 
the whole of a division’s revenue, the G : G + R ratio 
indicates roughly the proportion of a division’s revenue 
derived from grants. 

These 12 divisions obviously fall into two groups. 

Those in Group 1, five in number, show average classroom 
assessments ranging upwards from $96,000.00. The percent¬ 
ages of unpaid requisitions range from 0.8% to 4.8% in spite 
of the fact that grants here are on quite a moderate scale 
as compared with the grants paid to divisions in group 2. 

The total of unpaid requisitions of divisions in this group 
is only 2.5% of the total 1941 levy.

In group 2 we find 7 divisions. Here the classroom 
assessments range downwards from $60,900.00 (Note the break 
in assessments,between the two groups). Here the percentages 
of unpaid requisitions range from 1.3% to 97.5% of the 1941 
levy. Grants here are quite substantial, ranging from 37.5% 
to 67.5%. In spite of this grant assistance, these divisions 
find it necessary to ask for requisitions of such magnitude 
that their collecting authorities evidently are having diffi¬ 
culty in meeting them. It would appear that the divisions 
in group 2 are definitely weak divisions, and that their 
already substantial assistance in the form of grants should

be further increased. It is interesting to note that the 
only division in this group that has a small total of unpaid 
requisitions, is receiving very much more grant aid than the 
others. 

A further fact to note is that, of the 40 divisions 
reporting, only 15 have assessments per classroom of 
$60,000.00 or less. Of this number, 7 or 45.5% are found 
in group 2 referred to above. On the other hand, there are 
25 divisions reporting that have assessments per classroom 
in excess of $64,000.00. Of these only 5 or 20% report 
uncollected requisitions. 

This all seems to add up to the following conclusions: 

1. By and large over the Province, divisional revenues are 
coming in pretty well. 

2. From 15 to 17 of the divisions, that is from 30% - 35% 
of the total number, are leading rather precarious 
existances as evidenced by the fact that about half of 
their number are not receiving their requisitions 
promptly. All of these divisions have assessments of 
less than $65,000.00 per classroom. 

3. Grants to these divisions, while substantial, are not 
sufficient to offset their low per classroom assess¬ 
ments, and should be further increased.
