A STUDY ON THE STRATIG-RAPHY OF ALBERTA 


INTRODUCTION 

This paper constitutes an atterapt by the writer to 
■collect and study some information on the stratigraphy of 
Alberta, and to present this so as to give a general idea of 
^the sequence and descriptions of the various fomations as they 
exist in different parts of the province. Different ivriters, 
reporting on different areas of the province, have assigned 
ivarious names to formations representing approximately the 
j same duration of deposition, and an attempt vdll be made to 
I correlate these names as far as possible. 

As the area covered in this report is quite large, 
and as formations of the same age differ in character in dif¬ 
ferent parts of the province, it has been thought advisable to 

I 

I follow a more or less definite sequence in the discussion, and 

j 

I divide the orovince up into several areas. The approximate 

i 

I extent of these areas is marked on a key map and may be easily 
jreferred to by the reader. These areas will be discussed in 
jthe folio-wing order: 

Southern Alberta 
Central Alberta 
Northern Alberta 

(a) Athabaska - McMurray 

(b) Peace River 
Foothills Belt 
Rocky Mountains Area

- l/l/hereas the title of this report would indicate a study 

■of all the rocks present in the province, the major part of it 

I 

Ideals with the Mesozoic sediments. With the possible exception 

i 

of the Rocky Mountain area, these sediments constitute by far 
the greater part of the rocks exposed in each area considered. 

The information used has been collected from different 
sources, araong which are the Summary Reports and Memoirs of the 
■ Geological Survey of Canadaj reports of the Scientific and In¬ 
dustrial Research Council of Albertaj Bulletins of the Canadian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy; Transactions of the Royal 
Society of Canada; Bulletins of the American Association of 

Petroleura Geologists, etc. Records of wells drilled for oil and 

I 

!gas in Alberta have been collected from all available sources. 
These have been studied, drrLded into formations in many cases, 
and used as a possible method for the correlation of some 
!formations. 

! 

I General Physiography 

j The greater part of Alberta lies mthin the Great Plains 

1 

jarea of western Canada. In a very general vra.y, the province may 
^be divided into three physiographic sections! the plains area, 
the foothills belt, and the Roclcy Mountains area. 

Roughly, the plains area includes that portion of the 
province from the eastern boundary to the foothills belt on the 
west. In the northern part, north of about the 56th parallel, 
the plains area extends right across the province, as here the 
















•1 





3 


foothills are in British Colimibia. From the 56th parallel south 
to the international boundary, the western extent of the plains 
area would be approxiiuately on a line drawn from about tomship 
81, rajige 13, west of 6th meridian, to about township 1, range 25, 
west of 4th meridian. 

In general this area is gently undulating and rolling, 
with an elevation of about 2500 feet above sea level in the 
southern part, and from about 1500 to 2000 feet above sea level 
in the north. It rises slightly from east to west, reaching about 
3500 or 4000 feet where the foothills start. In a few places 
the plain is broken by fairly high and often flat-topped plateaus, 
such as the Cypress hills in the southeast, the Svran Hills in the 
central part, and the Buffalo Head Hills, Birch mountain and the 
Caribou mountains in the north. 

The Tdiole area is dissected by drainage-courses wiiich 
in the southern half are in an easterly direction, and in the 
northern half in a northeasterly direction. 

* The foothills belt borders the plains area on the west, 

running approximately parallel to the mountains, which is in a 
northwest-southeasterly direction. The area has an average width 
of about 35 miles. It is wider in the north than in the south, 
and crosses into British Columbia somewhere in the vicinity of 
the 56th parallel. 

The area has an elevation of from about 4000 .feet above 
sea level in the east, up to 7000 feet in many places in the west, 
but exhibits the general appearance of being approximately the 






4 


saiae level over its -whole extent. It consists of longitudinal 
parallel ridges with a general nortl wejt-soubheasfc trend. For 
the most part, these ridges are quite well wooded, but large 
open spaces do occur and in many cases these are used for grazing 
or ranging purposes. On the west side of the belt the mountains 
seem to rise quite abruptly and form a fairly sharp line of di¬ 
vision. In some places east of this line and in the foothills, 
outliers of the Rocky mountains do occur. These, such as the Big¬ 
horn and Brazeau ranges, have an equal elevation with the main 
mass of the mountains, but only short lateral extents. 

I The longitudinal ridges are cut almost at right angles 

by the water courses. Most of the rivers break almost directly 
across the foothills, but some, like the Bovj", follow the longi¬ 
tudinal valleys for various distances during their course across 
the foothills. 

The Rocky mountains area borders the foothills belt on 
the ivest, and seems to rise quite abruptly from it. The more or 
less wooded tops of the foothills give -way to bare rock faces and 
the tops show a jagged and serrated ou'bline. This area in Alberta 
is quite narrow, and like the foothills belt, it has its -widest 
part in the north. It is a series of ranges, approximately 
parallel to each other, with many peaks s'banding out many feet 
above the general level. 

I General Stratigraphy 

I Rocks of almost every age from the Precambrian to recent 











5 


are present in Alberto, but the greater part of the provj,nce, with 
the exception of the Rocky mountain belt, is underlain by rocks 
of Cretaceous and Tertiary 8.ge» The general range is shown by 
the following table: 


Recent - - 

Represented chiefly by deposits of boulder clay, sanid 
and graTel. These are for the most part unconsolidated. 

Tertiary - 

Large areas of both southern and central Alberta are 
covered by the Paskapoo formation, which is lower 
Tertiary and probably Eocene in age. In southwestern 
Alberta this is represented by the Yfillow Creek and 
Porcupine Hills beds. Th .0 Paskapoo is also e:TOosed 
in the Swan hills, just south of Lesser Slave Lake. 

Mesozoic ~ 
Cretaceous 

Most of Alberta, Yd.th the exception of the Rocky 
moujitains belt, most of the riorthern part of the pro¬ 
vince, a.nd those areas covered by the Paskapoo, are 
covered with Cretaceous sediments representing both 

Upper and Lower divisions. In the soutiiwestern part 
of tl'ie province the Lower Cretaceous is represented 
by the Kootenay and probably the lov/er part of the 
Blairmore. These have their equivalents in the Mc- 
Murray, Clearmter and Grand Rapids formations of the 
Athabaska area, and the Loon River and Peace River 
formations of the Peace River area. 


The Upper Cretaceous in the south and central part of 
the pro^rince consists of a thick marine shale series, 
the Colorado, followed by an alternation of somevdiat 
thin marine, brackish and fres’mvater beds, the Belly 
River. In the western foothills area, the Belly 

River is represented by an almost continuous fresh¬ 
water deposition giving the Sa^unders formation. 


Triassio and 


Jurassic - 

These rocks are seen only in the Rockyr mountains area 
where the mountain-building movements have thrust tliem 
up over the younger formations. The Fernie shale, -piiich 
is Upper Jurassic, has been penetrated by v/ell borings 
in the southern part of the province. 

Palaeozoic 

Carboniferous and Devonian rocks are exposed in the 
vicinity of Banff and Lake Minnei.’janka. Both Devonian 
and Silurian are present in the most northeasterly 
part of the province, and the Ordovician and Cambrian 
are seen to outcrop in the Rocky mountains. 






















locat/on of areas 


















."I' 






Precambrian - Precambriaii rooks occur around the xvest end of 


Lake Athabaska and north to the northern boundary 
of the province. Small areas also occur in the 
Rocicy mountains. 


SOUTHERN ALBERTA 

j The area (see Plate l) here discussed under southern 

I Alberta, is bounded on the south by the 49th parallel and on the 

I 

I east by the fourth principle meridian. It ex-bends as far north 
^ as the latitude of township 19, and to the Rocky mountains on the 
j west. 


! The area is essentially a plain, sloping gradually to- 

; ward the north from an elevated portion at the 4Sth parallel, to 

I depression which is occupied by the Soubh Sa^ska-bchewan and Oldman 

i 

'rivers, and which is crossed in a southeasterly direction by the 

i 

I Bow river. This depression has an elevation of about 2600 feet. 

I 

jTo the east of this plain rise the Cypress hills, to an elevation 
jof about 4600 feetj to the south, just into Montama, rise the 


j intrusive masses of the Sweetgrass hills; and to the west the 
jfoothills rise in parallel ridges to an elevation of about 5000 

jfeet. The Porcupine hills form a continuous upland area about 

1 

|20 miles wide from about the latitude of toxmship 7, north a 
distance of about 60 miles. The western boundary is formed by a 
longitudinal -^Talley which marks the eastern boundary of the foot¬ 


hills . 

The Bow river enters the area from the north and flovj-s 

in a southeasterly direction until its confluence with the Oldman 

1 

river at a point about the centre of the area. After this it 

















flovTS as the South Saskatche-vvan in a northeasterly direction 
across the remaining part of the area. The Oldmani^ Belly and 
St. Mary rivers enter the area from the southwest, flomng in 
a northeasterly direction to the Sotith Saskatchewan, The 
south-central portion of the area is drained by the Milk 
river. 

In the area iimiiediately north of the Milk river, 
are the Etzikom and Chin coulees. These are thought to ha-ve 
been formed during the period of recession of the glacial ice- 
sheet. They constituted a drainage system not dependent upon 
present topography, and are iiov7 dry. 

Strati g raph y 

The formations exposed in this area are Tertiary and 
Upper Cretaceous in age. The underlying Louver Cretaceous and 
at least part of the Jurassic can be studied from available 
well records. All the formations appear conformable, •'/yhich 
would indicate a continuous period of deposition. 

The exposed formations consist of marine shales and 
brackish and fresiwjater sands •'with marine interfingerings. The 
thick series of marine shales, followed by an alternation of 
braiiish-water, freshwater and marine sediments, would indicate 
fairly deep water conditions follovred by near-shore conditions.

is, hovrever, penetrated by a few well borings (Plate II) out in

conglomerate in tlie Blairmore, while the lower boundary is some¬ 
what hard to define ov/ing to the fact that the Fernie shales 
gradually grade upward into the Kootenay sandstones.

i The lower part of the fortiiation consists of a series of 

! thin-bedded sandstones and shales of dark greenish color, which 
' become quite friable on weathering. A little higher are al- 
' ternating beds of shale and sandstone mth coal beds and carbona- 
ceoLis shales. Then the sandstones become more massive and coarse 
tov/ard the top. A varying number of coal seams ranging from 3 
i feet to 17 feet in thickness occur throiighout the ?diole extent 
of the formation in the Rocky mountains. 

In the foothills the thickness of the Kootenay is from 
600 feet to 700 feet, mth the coal beds in the upper 300 feet. 

It is essentially freshwater in origin, although parts of it have 
been found to contain fossils indicating a brackish water deposit 
Its plant remains place it as Lower Cretaceous in age. 

Blaimore. - The Blairmore formation is exposed only 
in the western part of the area. It was described from the 
Blairmore map-area, in '\"Ai.iGh place it underlies the Crowsnest 
volcanics, but in all other occurrences it lies conformably 
beneath the Colorado shales. 

It 'is composed of greenish-grey and brovm sandstone, 
with bhick-bedded sandy shales. Lenticular beds of conglomerate, 
somewhat irregular and fairly coarse are present. In some places 
near tlie top of the formation appears a typical maroon-red shale. 
For the most part the shale layers are soft, while the sandstone 
beds are quite hard. A thick cherty conglomerate forms the base 
of the formation in the foothills. It varies from G feet to 10 
feet in thickness and reaches 30 feet at times. 











10 


In the Blaimore area, the formation is about 2200 feet 
thick, while out on the plains, the (Dakota) which is considered, 
owing to its stratigraphic position and like lithological olmrac- 
ter, to be its equivalent, is shOYm by well records to be only 
about 440 feet thick. 

The Blairmore is probably Upper Cretaceous in age, and 
its basal conglomerate may form the base of the Upper Cretaceous. 
This is based on the fact that it is the only horizon Ydiere 
there is a marked change in lithology between beds carrying a 
distinct Lower Cretaceous flora belovr, and beds wdth an Upper 
Cretaceous flora above. (Mem, 112, Geol.Surv.Gan.) 

Colorado, •" This foraiation does not outcrop in the 
plains portion of the area, but it can be studied by means of 
Y/ell records. The Benton, Yrhich is its equivalent, is e 2 q)osed 
in the Y/estern part of the foothills at many places from the 
49th parallel to the northern boundary of the area. 

It comprises all the strata between the Dakota group 
beloYY and the Milk River sandstone above, and is separated from 
them on lithological grounds, being a marine shale. 

It is coimposed mainly of dark grey to black clay shales 
Yfith some thin sandy layers. The shales are typically thin 
bedded and fissile. At the top they alternate with thin beds of 
sandstone which gradually become thicker until the shales dis¬ 
appear and we pass into the Belly River sandstones. The formation 
varies in thickness and Y/ell records show it to be about 1776 
feet in Etzikom coulee and about 1000 feet at Medicine Hat. 

(Plate II). It thickens to some extent toward the west of the area. 








It is of marine origin, and its marine faima fixes it 
as Colorado in age and correlates it mth the Colorado shales 
of Montana (Mem. 112,Ceol.Surv.Can.)

Milk River sand stone. - The Milk River formation is 
exposed chiefly on Milk river. It underlies the Pakovdci shales 
quite conformably and rests upon the Colorado shale. The upper 
and lower boundaries are not, in most places, difficult to 
place, due to the difference in lithology, the overlying and 
underlying fomations being essentially dark marine shales, while 
the Mlk River is a freshivater sandstone with the upper part 
possibly brackish water. 

^ It consists of massive, light-grey, porous sandstone 
near the International boundary, and well records some 40 miles 
north show it to be the samej but in the vicinity of Medicine 
Hat the horizon is represented by a thin, bromiish, sandy shale. 

It is essentially fresh--water in origin, although the upper part 
is possibly brackish, being formed during the retreat of the 
sea which wa.s responsible for the marine Pakowici. Some coal 
occurs, chiefly in the upper members of the formation.

Belly River formation. - The Belly River forraation is 
widely distributed over the central and eastern part of the 
j area, and also in the foothills region where it caps many of 
the ridges. In the plains portion of the area, the time repre¬ 
sented by the Belly River forraation was affected by oscillations 
of the shore-line and so the forraation can be divided into several 
divisions differing in origin and lithological character. In 
the foothills the series is essentially freshwater and represents 
; fairly continuous deposition. It consists of light-grey sand¬ 
stones with irregularly bedded shales. There are conglomerates 
at many places between Oldman and Crowsnest rivers, but these are 
small, and in most oases are only a thin sprinkling of small black 
chert pebbles on a sandstone. 

The sandstones are ripple marked and cross-bedded and 
appear quite similar to those of the St. Mary River forraation. 

The shales are incoherent and poorly stratified. 

There are at least two coal-bearing horizons, one some 






































16 


400 feet above the base and the other mthin the upper 100 feet* 

The upper horizon contains the more persistent coal seams, which 

occur at the same horizon as those mined at Lethbridge* 

The formation includes all the strata between the Bearpaw 

above and the Benton shale below, and is quite conformable with 

them. The separation is not difficult, as the formation is 

essentially fresh and brackish water, ’vdiile both the Bearpaw and 

Benton are marine shales. The lower 200 or 300 feet is probably 

brackish water, due to the proximity of the Colorado Sea and it 

contains a brackish water fauna (Sum, Kept., 1914, McLea.rn). 

The Belly River formation occupies the same stratigraphic 

position as the Brazeau sandstone of tlie Bighorn Coal Basin, and 

the Allison fomation in the Blairniore region, and is considered 

to be equivalent to them. The thickness varies from about 2500 

feet (estimated) on Crowsnest river, to 1600 feet on St, Mary 

river near the 49th parallel. 

In the plains portion of the area the Belly River is 

divided into the folloiving: 

Pale Beds (freshwater) 

Foremost (brackish T/'/ater) 

PakoT'gki (marine) 

Milk River sandstone (freshivater; brackish at top) 
Bearpaw. ” The Bearpaw formation is exposed toward the 
western part of the area on most of the rivers between the St. 

Mary and Oldman. It also occurs in the Cypress hills district. 

It lies confomably beti>^en the St. Mary River formation above 
and the Belly River below, and the transitions take place through 





























17 


IcomparatiTrely short vertical distances. It is separated from 
both the underlying and overlying formations on both lithological 
evidence and upon origin^ as it is a marine shale while the 
others are chiefly freshimter sandstones and shales. 

The Bearpaw consists, of dark to black clay shales mth 
namerous calcareous and ironstone conoretions^ many of which 
have fossils as nuclii. Thin, sandy layers are 'also quite common 
throughout the formation. In the vicinity of Pekisko creek, 
the Bearpaw horizon is marked by an alternation of sandstone, 
jthin coal seams and arenaceous shales, which conforms in character 
mth bhe lower part of the St, Mary River and upper part of the 
Belly River fomations* It may be included in either of these, 

I in which C8.se the Bearpaw is absent and the St. Mary River rests 
.directly upon the Belly River formation. 

The Bearpaw is of marine origin. The land tov/ard the 
close of Belly River time had probably become well eroded dovra., 
thus decreasing the rate of supply of sediiaents and producing 
svrarmpy, coal-forming conditions. A further doimwarping may have 
taken iilace, allov/ing the sea to come in, giving us the Bearpaw. 

It is upwards of 700 feet thick and contains a. marine fauna in 
which are the folloYmiig forms;

; Edmonton formation. - The Edmonton formation underlies 

I 

the Yfillow Creek formation, vd-th apparent conformity, and in 
most places a division betYireen the t'm can be only approxiiaately 
made. It rests upon the marine Bearpaw beloTJ'. 

The formation occurs only in the central part of this 
: area, but in the southern part of the area along the eastern 
: edge of the foothills, it is represented by the St. Mary River 
formation. It consists of grey and green sandy clays vvlth beds 
; of hard, greenish-grey sandstone, and as a whole is fairly 
easily eroded. It is chiefly a freshv/ater deposit, Yd.th the 
! lovrer part brackish due to being a phase of the retiring Pierre 
; sea. It has a thickness of about 1300 feet, 

I The St. Mary River formation outcrops on the eastern 

I part of the foothills, forming prominent strike ridges. It 
I occurs at the sarae stratigraphic position as the Edmonton, altliough 
^ it varies in thicloiess, being about 2700 feet on Crowsnest river 
(Memoir 112). It underlies the Willow Creek forraation and rests 

























'f. ’ 















19 

confonnably upon the Bearpaw, the shale of the latter gradually 
passing upir/ard into the sandstone of the former. 

The formation consists of light-grey calcareous sand¬ 
stones, with some sandy shales. Fine cross-bedding and ripple- 
marks are frequent. Coal occurs in its lower part, mth a -varying 
number of seajns of different thicknesses. On the Belly riirer, 
in the southT,TOstern part of the area, is a bed composed almost 
entirely of oyster shells and other molluscs, and varies from 
8 to 2 feet in thickness over short lateral distances. 

The lower 100 feet at least is brackish water in v/hich 
I are found Ostrea glabra , Corb i oula oo oidentali s, Anomia perstrigos a. 
Above this, freslnvater fossils such as Uni os and fresmmter 
Gas trop ods are common. 

The St. Mary River and Edmonton fomations are Upper 
Cretaceous in age and are separated from the Willow Creek, which 
is considered as Tertiary, purely on lithological evidence be¬ 
cause of the typical red color of the latter. 

Willow Greek foriTiation. - The Willow Creek formation 
is found only in the soiithwestern part of the area, and underlies 
the Porcupine Hills formation, which is considered as being the 
eqToivalent of the Paskapoo. It rests quite confoi'rmxbly upon tlie 
Hdm,onton or St. Mary River formation. It is composed of soft 
sandstones, clays and shales, and as a whole presents a rather 
typical reddish color. At the base are unconsolidated clays and 
sands v/ith only an occasional thin, hard band. Higher up is an 
alternation of reddish and bro'^ra arenaceous clays and sandstones. 

















20 


! Near the top the sandstone bands become thicker and finally loss 
I their red color. YiTest of the Porcupine hills the thickness is 
I about 500 feet. 

The formation is Tertiary in age and occupies the 
stratigraphic position of the lo'V'jer 500 feet of the P8.skapoo 
formation^ the dividing line bet-ween them being approximately 
where the Willo'w Creek ceases to present the characteristic 
reddish color. 

PaskapoQ formation.” The Paskapoo formation occurs 
in the western part of the area, ma.inly in the region of the 
Porcupine hills. The Cj^-press hills also show a remnant of the 
old Tertiary level in Alberta, but except in the lovirer parts of 
the general Alberta syncline, the Paskapoo has been completely 
eroded away. The formation consists mainly of delta.ic deposits, 
probably from the many streams to the west. It is chiefly an 
irregular and cross-bedded sandstone, vjith strata of lenticular 
form. It is light-grey to yellowish in color and is interbedded 
mth dark-green to black sandy clays. As a whole, the formation 
presents a light-yellowish appearance. 

The thickness varies, due to its irregularity of de¬ 
position, but a measured section shovrs a thickness of 3000 feet 
(Memoir 116). The age is considered to be Tertiary and probably 
Eocene. It contains a freshwater famia in which are many 
gastropods. 

Structural G eology 

In the area under discussion here, the general structural 
































































j feature is a syncline. This extends from the International 
j Boundary in a northerly direction at least as far as Lesser 
I Slave lake, and probably further; but in the northern part of 
I the province it is not so apparent. 

i 

I The syncline is asymmetrical, the steeper limb bein^ 

i 

on the west side wheire the successively older beds are brought 
I to the surface in the foothills. The eastern limb is not nearly 
' so steep, and between these two and nearer the eastern limb, the 
^ beds are nearly flat lying. The Porcupine hills occupy a position 
I'diich is approximately the centre of this structure, 

' In the southeastern pa.rt of the area, tomrd the Cypress 

hills, there seems to be a low anticline following the eastern 
1 limb of the general syncline. The Sweetgrass hills across the 
49th parallel in Montana, disturb the beds in the south-central 
part of this area and cause higher land here. 

CENTRAL ALBERTA 

' The area here discussed under central Alberta is taken 

I 

I as having its southern boundary about the latitude of toi/mship 19, 

; which lAias taken as the noi-thern edge of the area called Southern 
1 

i Alberta. On the east it is boimded by the fourth principle 
meridian, and it extends as far north as the latitude of townsliip 
; 60, The western boundary is taken approxima.tely parallel to 
I the eastern extent of the foothills belt. It covers eai area 
of roughly 50,000 square miles (Plate l). 






















22 


Physiography 

The area lies wholly mthin the Great Plains physiographic 
I di^’-ision. ^t is comparatively flat, with a low rolling surface 
I for the most part covered with a varying thickness of glacial 

I drift. The highest land is in the southwestern part where the 

! 

I elevation is roughly 3000 feet, and from hers there is a gentle 

I 

i 

slope toiivard the northeast, dowi to an elevation of about 2000 feet, 
A great number of small, irregular lakes, some of which 
1 disappear in dry seasons, are dotted over the whole area. These, 
for the most part, fill depressions in the drift 9.nd are of a 
glacial origin. 

The Red Deer river enters the area at a point aboud mid- 

j 

I voay along the eastern boundary, .and flows s outlie a stY/ard across 

i 

; the area to a point aLiiost on the southern boundary. From here 

! 

j it flows in a direction a few degrees north of east, through 
j the remaining part. 

T?ie North Saskatchemn river crosses the western boundary 
of the area a short distance south of its northern extent, and 
flows northeasterly through the city of Edmonton, a short dis- 
j tance after which it turns and flows a little south of east over 
I the-rest of the area. 

I The east-central half of the area, north of the Red Deer 

I river, is dissected by the Battle and Vermilion rivers, along 
1 

j which most of the rock exposures in the Yfain'wright-Vermilion 
area occur. 






















23 


Stratigi^aphy 

The formations exposed in this area belong to the 
Montana group of the Upper Cretaceous and to the Tertiary. How- 
iever, the Colorado group an.d also the Lower Cretaceous can be 
^ studied from available well records in the Wainwight-'Vemilion 

I 

I 

area. The exposed formations represent marine shales, brackish 

and freshwater shales and sandstones, over which lie varying 

thicknesses of fluviatile and glacial material, 
j 

The tertiary is represented by the Paskapoo fomation, 
which consists of brackish and fresh-water clays and sandstones, 
and the Montana group of the Upper Cretaceous includes the 

! 

jEdmon-bon formation, ivhich is brackish Yfaterj the Bearpaw which is 
Imarinei and the Belly River series which is represented by an 
'alternation of brackish, freshi^ater and marine sediments. Below 

I 

jthis is the true Pierre, represented by the Lea Park formation 
'which is essentially a marine shale. 

The Colorado group of the Upper Cretaceous, and the 
Lower Cretaceous nnderl-ying those which are exposed, are repre- 
isented respectively by a thick series of marine shales and a fairly 
thin deposit of fresh and brackish -^water shales and sandstones. 

All the formations appear conformable, -with the possible 
exception of the Paskapoo-Edmonton contact. It has recently 
been found that a time break of sufficient duration to have eroded 
away some 450 feet of the Edmonton beds, exists before the 
P8.skapoo was laid doyni in Central Alberta.

Benton fomation. 


The Benton fomation is not ex¬ 


posed in the area under discussion, but well records shovj- that it 
cLoes extend under this part of the province (Plate III). It lies 
below the Lea Park fomation, and represents a thick series of 
continuous deposition. 

i It consists of fairly dark grey raarine shales mth nu- 


I 


|ierous ironstone nodules and some thin sandstone beds. Both the 

Renton and the overlying Lea Park are marine shales, lithologically 

1 

and as far as well logs are concerned, no exact line of 

I 

I 

division can be made between them. However, the Lea. Park is 

Montana, in age, carrying a marine Montana fauna which is quite 

{ 

|3.istinctive, while the Benton is Colorado in age. It also has a 

I 

I 

^auna peculiar to itself. The fauna, therefore, constitutes 
jbhe sole method of differentiating between the Benton and Lea 
Park fomations in central Alberta. 

i 

! 

I In southern Alberta the Pakowki formation, which is the 

equivalent of the Lea Park, is separated fi'om the Benton by the 
Milk River sandstone, but this fomation is not apparent in cen¬ 
tral Alberta. The combined thiclaiess of the Pakowki^ and Benton 
is from, 1500 to 1600 feet. 

An examination of well records also reveals the fact 

that below the Benton shale is a sandstone series probably of a 

1 

trackish or freshv^rater origin. It is a series of sandstones inter- 
bedded mth shales and containing some simall coal seams. This 
jj'omation is probably an extention of the Dakota group of southern 
Alberta, and may represent the basal beds of the Upper Cretaceous 
or even the upper part of the Lower Cretaceous.

Lea Park fomation . - The formation gets its name from 
i its type exposure at Lea Park^, Alberta. It is exposed at dif¬ 
ferent points along the North Saskatchewan river from Fort Island 
dom stream over the rest of this area. It is also seen in the 
; northern part of the Waimvright-Yermilion map-area. 


The Lea Park formation underlies the Ribstone Creek 
formation and is separated from it by the fact that it is essent- 
. ially a dark marine shale, •'.^/hile the lo¥/sr beds of the Ribstone 
; Creek are greenish-yellow, brackish water sands. 

It consists of dark shales and sandy strata below, vdth 
nodules and discontinuous layers of ironstone. The upper part, 

; as seen on the North Saskatcheimn, is chiefly brovmish and yellov/- 
I ish shales. A section from fiTOll records at Viking is as follows:

.posures are extremely few and unsatisfactory. Hov/ever, the for- 
imation can be studied from records of wells drilled in the 
Yfainivright-Vermilioii area (Plate III). 

On the North Saskatchemn section the Shandro formation, 
which is the equiTalent of the Grizzly Bear, is exposed along 
:ths water level below the mouth of Y.Tiite Mud creek. 

The fomation lies between the Birch Lake above and 
the Ribstone Creek fomation below. The lor/er contact cannot

Imation grade up into the shale of the Grizzly Bear through a 
zone of 10 or 15 feet wl-iich carries marine fossils as well as many 
selenite crystals and flaices. 

The formation consists essentially of dark grey marine

Birc h Lake formationj^ - The Birch Lake formation is 
exposed in a-typical section, at Birch lake. In the I'lorth Saskat- 
chew8.n section, the formation is represented by the Victoria 
sandstone, viiich outcrops about three miles below Pakan. Here 
it is not over 95 feet thick and forms Victoria rapids. 

The t’^pical Birch Lake formation lies below the Variegated 
jbeds and rests upon the Grizzly Bear marine shales. The Birch 
'Lake - Grizzly Bear contact is not very sharp, but approximately 

i 

■at the base of the formation a bed of oyster shells up to three 

I feet thick occi-irs . This bed has been observed over a l8.rge area 

jin the TJainwright-Vemilion district, and may represent a change 

I 

’from marine conditions of the Grizzly Bear time to the brackish 

I 

!water conditions of Birch Lake time. 

The formation consists for the most part of massive, 

cross-bedded grey and brown, sandstone, ?/ith some softer shales 

■ and sand. Some of the sandstones contain carbonaceous material 

jrepresented by plant fragments. The formation also contains some 

j hard sandstone layers which form most of the outcrops. A section

The formation is considered to be essentially of a 
brackish v/ater origin. It varies in thickness from 60 to 100 
feet. Fossils from some of the hard sandstone beds are: 

Ostrea, sp. 

Yolsella, of. mee ki, (Evans and Shunard) 

Anornia sp. 


In the vicinity of Birch lelce, a marine fauna occurs 

in the hander bands of sandstone and in the ironstone nodules 

associated mth them. It may be that the brackish Birch Lake 

sandstone was deposited alm.ost at sea level, and that an invasion 

of the sea of sufficient magnitude to deposit the harder beds 

containing these fossils, extended over e, considerable area.

also seen near Hawkins, along the Canadian national railmy. 

In the TJainwright-Yerrailion district it has "been found 
almost impossible to make a sharp division between the Pale and 
Variegated beds in the field, although the color differs to some 
extent, the Varie^ted beds being somewhat darker. 

The Pakan formation is essentially a thin-bedded, 
variegated series of arenaceous shales, thin sandy clays, grey

1 In southern Alberta^ Do^irlin^ shows the Belly River series 

to include o.ll ihe strata below the top of the Pale beds and above 
the bottom of the Milk River sandstone. The Milk River sandstone 
is correlated, at least provisionally, mth the Eagle sandstone 
of central Monttma, i/'diicli in part carries a. marine fauna of Lower 
Pierre age. The Lea Park formation of central Alberta is con¬ 
sidered to be LoYfer Pierre in age, and so is taken as the equi¬ 
valent of the Pakowki of southern Alberta. As the Pakowki is 
.included in the Belly River series of Southern Alberta and the 
Lea Park fomation is not included in the Belly River series of 
jCentral Alberta, it would seem, that two interpretations of the 

I 

Belly River series exists in Alberta. 

Bearpa w formation. - The Bearpaw formation underlies 
the ss,.3tern part of this area from its northern to southern 
extent. It is exposed on the Battle river south of Eardisty, and 
also on the Red Deer river betYreen the mouth of Willow and 
Hamalta creeks. The northern extention of the Pierre sea is not 
iknoY/n, but exposures in the Mackenzie valley and in other places 
I in the north show marine beds simdlar in appearance to the Bentai 
i shales, and containing some of the same fossils, but overls.in 

i 

:by beds of Tertiary age» So it is possible that the Pierre sea, 

Iadvancing from the south, did not get over the northern part 

I 

i;of the province, 

i 

j The fomation ta.kes in all the strata between the 

jBelly Ri\-"er formation below and the Edmonton above. Both con- 
jtacts ai‘e quite conformable and the dividing linos r.i*c i ct very 
|difficult to place, OYdiig to lithological differences between

bhe 3earp<aYj- and the ovei-l-in^ underlying forniabions^ the la.tter 
bwo of lA/iiioh are fresh and brackish "iTater sandstones and shales. 


ir/hile the Bearpaw is essentially a dark, inarine shale. 

The fomation consists of a series of dark grey inarine 
clay shales, containing varying quantities of selenite and iron¬ 
stone nodules. It has a sandstone member, kno^m as the Bulirark 
sandstone, which consists of hard massive and bedded bromi sand- 
Istones. The lower part of the formation contains some incoherent 


isandstone strata. In the Battle river area, the BearpaY/ re- 

i 

presents the top of the Montana group, but in other parts of the 
larea under discussion it is overlain by the Edmonton non-marine 
formation.

From the above well sections it is seen that the 


thickness of the Bearpaw varies from 276 feet at Camrose to about 


781 feet at Edmonton, It is essentially marine in origin, and it 
is placed in the Montana group of the Upper Cretaceous* 

EdiriOnton forma tion. - The Edmonton formation has a 
I mde distribution in this area, where it is exposed from the 
I southern to the northern boundary, occupying an approximate 


central position. It lies between the Bearpaw belovj- and the 


Paskapoo formation a-bove. The lo¥/er contact is quite conform¬ 
able and is readily observed o?d.ng to lithological differences. 


, the Bearpaw being a dark marine shale, while the Edmonton coii- 
: sists chiefly of brackish and fresh-water shales, clays and sand¬ 
stones. The contact with the overlying Paskapoo formation has 

been found to be disconformable in this area at least, and it 

I 

i is thought that as much as 450 feet of the Edmonton was planed 
off by erosion before the deposition of the Paskapoo.

j The forriiatlon consists of sediments deposited in both 

Ibrackish and fresh?ra,t 0 r, possibly in shallow freshimter basins, 
and estuaries and deltas. The composition of the beds varies 
■both vertically and laterally. In general, in the central part 
^of this area, the formation consists of sandstones, clay, arena¬ 
ceous and bentonitic shales, ironstone bands, carbonaceous shales 
;and coal seams. Bentonite seems to prevail throughout the whole 
;series and there are some thin beds of pure bentonite. Goal seams 
OCCU 2 * almost throixghout the entire forraation. These vsiry in 
,thickness and nimiber from place to place, and are not all of 
:-workable dimensions. The correlation of these seams is rendered 
very difficult by the fact that the surface of the formation has 
■ undergone varying amounts of erosion in different places, thus

structural Geologiy 


41 


In general the area under discussion is irif3luded within 
the hroad Alberta syncline. In the central part of tlie area and 
tov/ard tlie west, the beds are aLnost flat with a probable slight 
dip to the west. As we go east the beds appear to loose their 
westerly dip, and in a broad sense, the structure resembles a 
jterrace or monocline. 

I In the east-central portion, that is, in the Yiking 

;and Wainwright-Veniiilion districts, some minor structures are 

! 

-apparent upon the major one. These are chiefly small folds, 

i 

[mostly anticlinal in form, and it is associated mth these that 
the gas and oil of the Viking, Wainm’iglit and Ribstone creek 
districts occur. 

Summary 

By the -yjay of a short summary, it can be said that in 
a broad way the formations occuring in southern Alberta extend 
-also into central Alberta, where they retain approximately the 
'same features. 

; There are some changes in the names of the formations, 

but they can be correlated in both areas. It will be noticed 
ifrom the table of formations at the beginning of this chapter 
ithat the Foremost beds of southern A.lb©rta are divided into 
;some smaller divisions as we go north of the Red Deer river. 

I There seems to be two interpretations of the Belly 

jRiver series, one applied to each area. In Central Alberta the 
iLea Park formation has not been included in the Belly River 


















42 


series, while in Southern Alberta the Pakowki, vjhich is considered 
as its equivalent, has been included in the Belly River series. 

It may be that vd.th further and more extensive field vrork, the 
Belly River of southern Alberta mil be restricted to the ^ale 
and Foremost beds, but until more evidence is obtained, these 
'two interpretations are doomed to remain. 

The Milk River sandstone is not recognizable in cen¬ 
tral Alberta at all. 

NORTHERN ALBERTA 

The area here discussed under northern Alberta is taken 
as extending across the province from the fourth principle 
meridian on the east, to the western boundary. Its southern 
extent is about the latitude of tomship 60, while it extends 
as far north as the latitude of township 110 (Plate l). 

I On the south side of Lesser Slave lake, in the south- 

; central part of this area, are the Swan hills. The district 

; about these hills may be considered as forming a sort of 

! 

I stratigraphioal link between centrsM Alberta and the Peace 
: River area, and will be given separate attention, 
i The whole area of northern Alberta is here divided 

I into ti'TO; Ihe McMurray-Athabaska area on the east, and the Peace 
I River area on the mst. The latter area is very large, and as 
I the formations occurring in it have been assigned s'^ 'Vghtly 
I different names in the eastern and Virestern parts, it has been 
i thought Y /-011 to follow the existing divisions called the eastern

and v\restern Peace River areas. 

Physiography 

Taken as a whole, the area here called Northern Alberta 

is in general a gently undulating, wooded plain, mth many 

jshallow lakes and muskegs. Between the Peace and Athabaska 
i 

I rivers this rolling, plain-like country is relieved by a number 
j 

I of high ridges or plateaus, most of ^diich are due to a dif- 

’ ferentia.l erosion of the underlying soft rocks, 

i The higher land is seen in the southwestern part of 

j 

i the area, west of Smoky river where it rises to an elevation of 
i a.bout 4000 feet above sea level. From here the elevation gradual- 
^ly decreases in a northeasterly direction to about 1200 feet in 
I the vicinity of McMurray. 

I South of Lesser Slave lake, the Swan hills rise to 

i 

! about 4000 feet, while the level of the lake is about 2000 feet. 

! In the northern part of the area and tov^/s.rd the west, the Buffalo 
I Head hills attain a height of 2600 feet. These lie betvreen the 
: Peace and Wabiskaw rivers just to the south of Fort Vermilion, 

I West of the Athabaska river and a short distance north of MacKay 
: are the Birch mountains, which rise to an altitude of 2600 feet, 
j and extend for more than ninety miles along the river. They are 
i separated from, the river by a plain, some twenty miles '/.dde, 
pwith an elevation of about 1000 feet above sea level. 

j Many lakes occur scattered over the whole area, fhese 

! 

j 

jrange in size from twelve to fifteen miles in length, to small 
jpools some few feet across. They are usually quite shallow and 











O' 








44 


,very weedy, and many are gradually being filled up Yvdth Sphagnum. 
Lesser Slave lake is the only large lake in the area. It is about 
60 miles long. Most of the lakes are due to nwaerous shallow 
depressions in the boulder clay, -wi-iich covers the area, becoming 
filled i/vith water. 

The Peace river enters the area from the vrest, crossing 
the western boundary at about its middle point. It flows in 
a general easterly direction for about 100 miles to its confluence 
with the Smoky river, and then turns north and flows in that dir¬ 
ection over the rest of the area. This river, with its many 
tributaries, the larger of which are the Smoky and Little Smoky, 
drain the yrestern part of this area. 

The Athabaska river crosses the southern boundary 
of the area approximately at its middle point, and flows in a 
northeasterly direction to about the latitude of to^mship 7E, 

From here it turns and flows approximately south to about the 
■ latitude of township 65, where it makes a. U-turn and again flows 
jnprth. The tom of Athabaska is situated at the apex of this 
I turn. The river continues its northerly course for about 120 
jmiles and then flows northeasterly as far as McM-m*ray, from, where 

;it follows a northerly course over the remainder of the area.

This part of the Uorthern Alberta area is here taken 
I as consisting, in a general wa^s oF the country extending east 
.from the east end of Lesser Slave lake to the fourth principle 

jMeridian. It also includes the full north-south extent of the 

i 

I area.

Physiop;raphy 

The Athabaska river flews northeastward through the 
area. From the town of Athabaska to McMurray, the valley is from 
300 to 500 feet deep and contains a number of rapids. Above 
Mlurray the valley is quite narrow with abrup t slopes^ and in 
nany places is even gorgs-likc. Beloxv McMurray the valley is 
broad and has gentle slopes and a firly loxv gradient. Amy from 
the river valley the land is much higher^ but becomes gradually 
lower as one goes northward. 

Stratig raphy 

As the whole area is covered with a msjitle of boulder 
clay^ varyi'Jig in thickness, practically the only rock outcrops 
or exposures are along the Athedoaska river and its luimerous 
itributaries. 

The rocks exposed are of Cretaceous age, both Upper and 
Lower Cretaceous being present. The Lower Cretaceous rests un- 
confomably upon Devonian limestones, which are seen to outcrop 
between Moberly rapids and McKay, 

The Lower Cretaceous is represented by the MoMurray, 
Clearwater and Grand Rapids formations, i/di.ich consist of sand¬ 
stones, shales and clay of both contiiie>ital and marine origin. 
Some thin coal seams occur in the upper part of the Grand Rapids 
fo mat ion. 

The Upper Cretaceous is represented by the Pelican 
shale, Pelican sandstone and LaBiche formation. These sediments, 
ifdth the exception of the Pelican sandstone, are chiefly dark 

















46 


aiariji'3 shales mth occasional concrGtionary layers. The LaBiche 
forraation is overlain by drift which consists of gravels, sand 
and clay, and is iDrohahly Q.ii&vberjiary in age*

Resources of Albe.rta. and the above m.entioned list can be found 
on page 113 and 114. These fossils were determined by Dr. P. S. 
tferren of the Department of Geology? University of xTlberta, and 
are considered by him to be Upper Devonian in a.ge. 

McMurray formation . - The McMurray fomation? or? 

|3LS it is often called, the McMurray Tar Sands, outcrops in the 
jrorm of intermittent cliffs all the way doxm the Athabaska river 

j 

from Boiler rapids, which are about 25 miles southwest of McMurray 

Rimost to the Firebag river. It also extends along the Clearmter 

i 

iriver to the eastern boundary of the area. 

The contact mth the underlying Devonian limestone 
iseries is one of unconfomity, but it is overlain quite conformably 
jby the Cleaiwjater formation, which is essevntially’’marine, The 
'contact between these two is placed at the base of a bed of green 
jsandstone, iiiimediately above which the marine fauna of the 
blear?irater is found. 

Above, the formation consists of thick-bedded sand¬ 
stones which are often argillaceous. Below, it passes into 
massive, coarse-grained, cross-bedded sandstone. The upper par’b 
is never tliin-bedded, and sometirn.es conglomerate, and rarely 









c 














clay or shale are present at the base. 

The formation carries a small fresh'vvater fauna in its 
upper part, and its thickness is as from 110 feet to 180 

feet. 

The Mc^'^urray formation constitutes the base of the 

Lower Cretaceous in the Athabaska area, and it is correlated Yiith. 
I 

the lower part of the Loon riTer formation of the Peace RiTer 
section. It is also considered to be the equivalent of at least 
part of the Kootenay of the foothills belt, 

Clearr/ater formation . « The Clearmter fomation out- 
I crops along the Athabaska from point LaBiche, some 50 miles 
scrathwest of McMurray, to a short distance below the latter 
place. In the vicinity of McMurrs-y and e.lso for some distance 
north, the formation underlies the plateaus. 

The formation lies between the McMurray Tar Sands be¬ 
low and the Grand Rapids formation above. The lower contact is 
placed at the bottom of a greenish sandstone bed, below i-viiich 
the freshmter fauna of the MoMurray is found. 

It consists of grey and green sandstones and grey, 
black and greenish shales which are quite soft. The shale con- 
I tains some ironstone concretions. At Burnt rapids, the shale 
holds a bed of greenish glauconitic sandstone about 2 feet in 
thickness. This bed is highly fossiliferous. A section of the 
Clearwater shales from the records of a v>r©il drilled at Pelican 
rapids about section 6, tcmship 79, range 17, west of the 4th

The formation is of a marine origin as shoyr.i by its 
narine fauna. It is Lower Cretaceous in age and would appear to 
be equivalent to the upper part of the Loon Liver formation of 
rbhe Peace River section, as the latter occupies the same strati- 
Igraphic position as the ^^cMurray and Clea,rYra.ter formations to¬ 
gether. It is very difficult to correlate the Clearvra/ber for¬ 
mation mth anything in southern Alberta. In the Wainwight 
area, the Lowei* Cretaceous is considered to be continental in 
jorigin, probably on account of its coal seama as seen in some 
jwell records. It may be that the Cleaiwjater marine phase thins 
tout entirely before reaching.the Yfeinwright area, but this is 
;as yet very uncertain. 

I The marine fauna contained by the Clear?>/ater, Loon 

tRiver and Peace River formations is of the Lower Cretaceous groip, 
but it is quite different to any described American fauna, thus 
Irendering a correlation very difficult. To the west of this 
iarea, the Lower Cretaceous sea did not extend as far as the 
ipresent foothills, for there the marine Lower Cretaceous of the 
jAthabaska area is replaced by continental sediments. It may 
jbe that the sea came in from, the northeast. 

I Grand Rapids formation. - The Grand Rapids formation

jms named by McConnslL from typical exposures which occur at 


jGrand Rapids on the Athabaska river. The fomation outcrops just 
iabove the Joli Fou rapid and is exposed intenaittently all the 

i 

|V/ay to Grand rapids. Below here it is exposed as aLunst vertical 

i 

icliffs on each side cf the river for several miles. It is 8.1so 

j 

iseen on the adjacent plateaus from Algar river to below the 


jCascade ra^pids. 

i 

The fomation occupies a position between the Clearwater 
!fomation below and the Pelican shales above, its lower part being 

j 

•marked by the presence of very large, silicious, and often 
;spherical concretions. These are well exposed at the fill in 
Grand rapids* 

The Grand Rapids fonaation differs lithologically in 
its upper and lower parts. As a whole it consists of massive 
land cross-bedded sandstone of a characteristic yellomsh color, 
vd'iich is sometimes whitish. It is fairly coarse-grained and 

! 

hreathers into steep slopes and even cliffs, the faces of which 

j 

iare seen to contain concretionary masses. 


I The lower part of the fomation is characteristically 

I concretionary, the large spherical concretions often attaining 

i 

I a diameter of 8 or 10 feet. At Grand rapids, about 50 feet of 
these lower beds are present, and these are overlain by about 
100 feet of alternating shales and sandstones. Over this lies 
j some 50 feet of greyish and yellomsh sandstone which carries a 
seam of coal 4 to 5 feet thick. Thin seasns of poor lignite are 

ialso seen at several places in these upper beds. The incorporation 





















of these beds into a single fomational unit is based largely on 
their prevailingly arenaceous character. 

, A section of the formation from the log of a rrell 

drilled by the Geological Survey about section 6, toimship 79, 

range 17, west of 4th meridian, is as follows:

Pelic9.n shale . - The Pelican shale outcrops sorae dis~ 
;tance belorf the mouth of Pelican river and is seen for many 
iniles further doT/vn the valley of the Athabaska. It forms a 
'bench or low slope between the Pelican sandstone above and the 
‘Grand Rapids cliff below. 

It overlies the Grand Rapids formation quite conformably, 
but is lithologically different to it, on which evidence the two 
may’- be separated. Also, the Pelican shale is of marine origin, 
while the upper part of the Grand Rapids formation is subaerial 
ivitii thin coal seoms, 

^The Pelican foimation consists essenhially of -i dark

marine shale, somer/hat imrder and darker than the Pierre shales, 
and it weathers to snail flaky particles. Its upper part, through 
I an interbedding of thin sandstone and shale beds, grades upmrds 

I into the Pelicam sandstone. A section of the formation from the

The Pelican, shale is of marine origin and is correlated 
with the St. John formation of the Peace River section. This 
.formation occuxaiefi the same sbrabigraphical position a.nd is of 
a smilar lithological character and origin. The foxniation may 
also be compared mth the Blackstone and Lower Benton formation,s 
of the foothills belt further south. These foimiations vrould 
seem bo be the equivalent of .the Pelican shal.e, although they 
are much thicker in most places. All of these formations co.ntain 
^some species of Inocerauius. 

j The fomation is assigned to the Colorado group of the 

j 

;Upper Cretaceous, in vvhich group it constitutes the lower sedi¬ 
ment in this area. 

Pelica n sand stone. - The Pelican sandstone is exposed 

jin many places along the .A.thab9.ska river from Pelican rapids to 

near point Brule. In most of the oxitcrops it foms low cliffs. 

I It occupies a position between the Pelican shale b0lo\7 and the 

iLaEiche formation above. The contact ’with the Pelicani shale is 

I conformable and quite gradational, the shale passing up into the 

I sandstone through an alternation of thin shale and sandstone 

! 

I beds. It is separated from the LaBiche on lithological grounds.

I the latter being essentially a dark ma.rine shale, while the Pelican 

i 

I fomation is a sandstone. 

: The formation consists of cross-bedded saiidstones, and 

* in x^l'^^ces it is conglomeratic at the top. It is usually of a 
i conspicuously whitish color, but may be tinged, yellomsh or 
^brom vdth iron oxide. The lower beds are soft and often cru-iibly, 
and in places thin-beddedj but to?m-’d the top the grains are 
cemented by iron into a very hard sandstone. 

The Pelican sandstone has a thickness of from 35 to 
j40 feet. It is essentially of a continents.! origin, but the 
!thin bedding at the base and the presence of some poorly pre¬ 
served Inocerrmus a.t the top, would indicate that marine con- 
tditions prevailed at both the beginning and the end of the tiin© 
Irepresented by this formation. 

The fomation is correlated directly T/ith the Dunvogan 
sandstone of the Peace River section, which occupies the same 
stratigraphica.! horizon. It may also be considered as the 

[equivalent of the Gardiimn and Bighorn fomations of the foothills 

i 

belt, ■'A’iiich divide the marine Colorado group into three members, 

: LaBi ohe format ion. - This formation is cut through by 

the Athabaska river from about the ir^outh of Little Slave river 
bo Pelican river. It is exposed mostly at the river bends and 
In scarps made by landslides, and it foms low valley slopes. 

Below the mouth of LaBiche river the foimation is often continuous 
for miles at a stretch. At about 24 miles below the mouth of 
LaBiche river the shales of this fomation have been reddened

I The fomation l.ies between the Pelican sandstone beloY/ 

I and is covered over with varying thiclaiesses of glacial drift, 
i It is separated from the underlying fomation partly on 
lithological groimds, the upper part of the Pelican being a cross- 
ibedded sandstone, while the LaBiche is essentially a dark shale. 

The LaBiche fomation consists chiefly of grey and 
black shales mtli concretionary layers at various horizons. 

'These concretions of ten carry m8.rine fossils. There is varying 
amovints of argillaceous materia.!*. small lenticular beds of lime- 
;stone and occasionally thin beds of greyish and yelloTdsh sand¬ 
stone. Scattered tlmughout the shales are crystals of iron 
!pyrites 5 which are often in spherical, crystalline aggregates.

is correlated mth the Smoky River foimiation of the Peace River 
section, which is lithologically similar and occupies the same 
j stratigraphical horizon. It may also have as its equivalent the 
I YiTapiabi and Upper Benton formations of the foothills. Both thes

Structural Geology 

1 From Athaba,ska La,nding to point Brule the structure 

I shoves a low half fold vath a dip toward the south or southwest. 

I 

A di]p of about 5-|- feet per mile is observed from Grand rapids 
to Pelican rapids, but north of Gramd rapids the dip becomes 
considerably less and the structure flattens out. South of 
Pelican rapids the dip is as high as 10 feet per mile, idiich 
is probably due in part to the southwest course of the river 
I near Athabaska. 

Between point Brule and the exposed section 

is almost o.t right angles to the above mentioned one. It sliows 
a low anticlinal structure vdth the axis near Crooked rapids. 
























O -I 













59 


The dips on each side are very low, probably some 3 or 4 feet 
per mile. 

I As we go north from, McMurray, the valley sides are 

! lowy The bedding of the McMurray form.atlon is not reliable for 

Istrucbural purposes as the dip cannot be accurately determined, 

! 

I but it vrould seem to be a very low angle t o the north or 

i 

j northeast. 

i 

; The limestoiiB series, which underlies the McMurray 

forraatio.n unconformably, has a major structure much the same 

I as that exhibited by the Cretaceous sediments, but in 
j 

addition to this the limestone is folded into low domes of a 
much smaller size. 


EASTEEIT PEACE lilYER IiREA 


The extent of the area here called Eastern Peace River, 


.comprises the full north-south distance of the Northern Alberta 


area. It extends from about the longitude of Vermilion Chutes 


I on the east to about Dunvegan on the west. This tovm is situated 


jon the Peace river about 55 miles southeast of the to-'A'n of 

I 

I 

jPeace River, This also includes the area covered by the Smoky 


driver section. 


I Physiogr a ph y 

The country is £)lateau-like, mth an undulatory suf- 

! 

face, and is generally wooded, although some prairie spots are 
present. The highest land is in the southern part where the 
elevation is about 2500 feet above the sea; and from here it 





















60 


Ibecomes l0‘'Vt3r until it is a little under 1000 feet at Veririilion 

iChutes. In the northwest part of the area, and situated between 

Ithe Peace and Wabiskaw riirers, are the Buffalo Head hills Ydiich 

attain an elevation of about 2400 feet, while in this vicinity 

^the general level of the Peace is about 1000 feet. 

The Peace river enters the area from the west, flovTing 

:ea3t7ra,rd for about 50 miles, where it turns north and continues 

in that general direction for about 135 miles, after which it 

flov/s through the rest of this area in a northeasterly direction. 

In the vicinity of the town of Peace River the valley is about 
i 

1800 feet below the level of the surrounding plateau-like country, 
ibut this decreases nortbwvard until it is quite low when Vermilion 
iChutes are reached. 

The Smoky river crosses the southern boundary of the 
iarea, flowing in a general northeasterly direction until its 
confluence with the Peace just above the town of Peace River, 
phe tributaries of these two rivers have lov^, sloping valleys, 
except for a short distance above their mouths where they usually 
have fairly deep, steex^-sided valleys, 

I Stratigraphy 

: The area is covered with a mantle of glacial drift 

■irhich varies in thiclzaess from on© place to another; for this 
peason very few rock outcrops occur except along the water 

courses. The oldest rocks exposed in the area belong to the | 

' ^ 

Palaeozoic and are probably Devonian in age. These consist of 
a series of limestones which are exposed along the Peace river

:from Vermilion Chutes dovmstream for some distance. The greater 
Ipart of the area is underlain by rocks of Cretaceous age, both 
iUpper and Lo'V'rer Cretaceous being represented. 

The LoY/er Cretaceous is represented by the Loon River 
‘and Peac^ River formations, the latter of which consist of eai 

;Upper and a lower sandstone meraber separated by a relatively 

I 

thin shale bed* 

‘ The Upper Cretaceous is represented by the St. John, 

.Bunvegan, Smoky River and Wapiti formations. The first -two of 
ithese, and probably the lower one-third of the Smoky River, are 
!Colorado, w5:iil0 the upper one-third of the Smoky River and the 
h.Yapiti are assigned to the Montana group. 

Taken as a whole, the LoYrer Cretaceous rocks of this 
area contain much more material of marine origin than do those 
'of the areas previously described. The Colorado group of this 

;area is unlike that of areas previously described, in that it 

! 

‘contains much more sandstone and has a greater rjercentage of 

sub-aerial and non-marine sediments.

Loon UiTer 


Loon Fiver formation. - The Loon River formation out¬ 


crops along the banks of the Peace river from a point about 20 
imiles above the mouth of Be/btle river nearly all the yt&.j dovjn 
to Vermilion Chutes, where it is underlain by limestone of 
^Devonian age. The fommtion also occurs on the lower part of 
the Loon and Red rivers, and underlies the plateaus north and 

jeast of the Great Horsehoe bend. 




















































63 


The formation lies at the base of the Lower Cretaceous 

ill this area, and is overlain conformably by the Peace River 

[formation. It consists chiefly of soft and somewhat friable 

;shales, which are dark grey to nearly black in color, and vfhich 

hold some calcareous and ironstone nodules. These are' inter- 

bedded TJith occasional beds of sandstone and impure limestone. 

jroward the south of the area, v/here the shales are penetrated 

by the well borings, they are more arenaceous, especially near 

ithe base of the formation. The well logs show small beds of 

sandstone which are not present in exposures further north. 

In the northern part of the area, at the Great Horse- 

jshoe bend, the thickness of the formation is estimated at from 

300 to 400 feet, -vihile in well logs in the vicinity of the tovm. 

bf Pea.ee River, the thickness is about 1100 feet, 

I In general the formation is of a marine origin and 

I 

bontains such fossils as Desmoceras affine and D esmoceras affine 
yar. glabrum. These fossils, together Tdth the presence of 

fairly thin bedding, would indicate marine conditions in the 

I 

horthern part of the area during Loon River time. In the south, 

I 

the lower, more arenaceous part of the forraatioii, vdiich contains 

i 

ironstone beds, occupies the horizon of the Mclvlurray Tar Sands 
^d may represent a non-marine stage of the es.rly LoY/er Cretaceous. 
Thf3 upper, marine part of the Loon River corresponds to the 
Clearwater formation of the Athabaska section, and may be cor¬ 
related with it. Therefore, the Loon River formation may be said 
1 

to correspond to the McMurray and Clearivater foimiations, the 



















64 


lower, and probably non-raarine i^ortion bein^ equivalent to tiie 
Tar Sands, and the upper, jmrine ^portion as seen in exposures along 
the Peace river further north, being equivalent to the Clearwater 
formation. 

Peace Hiver formation. - The Peace Eiver formation is ex¬ 
posed in Peace river valley along both sides of the river from the 
town of Peace River nearly to Carcajou point, a distance of about 
115 miles. The rocks of this formation, where typically developed, 
form vei’y steep v/alls - the ‘*Ramparts of the Peace^*. The exposures 
are confined to the river valley as their slight southerly dip is 
not sufficient to bring them to the surface of the plateau, and 
as we go further domstream the dip is almost flat. 

The formation occupies a x^osition b8t>?e8:a the Loon River 
formation below and the St. John formation above, and constitutes 
the uppermost sediments of the Lower Cretaceous in this area. It 
is separated from the overlying St. John on lithological grounds, 
the upper part of the Peace River formation being a cross-bedded 
cream-coloured sandstone, while the St. John is a dark, friable shale. 

The Peace River foimiation is divided into three members, 
an uiDper and a lower sandstone separated by a thin shale member. The 
upper sandstone member consists, in its more southerly exposures, of 
massive, white to cream-coloured, cross-bedded sandstone with a 
few thin concretions. In some localities a thin coal seam app)ears 
near the top. The thickness of the member in the south is about 130 
feet, but as we go northward, there is a replacement of the sandstone 
by shale above, so that near the mouth of Gadotte river the thiclmess 
of the member is only about 90 feet. the massive, cross-bedded

sandstone, which is of freshmter origin, is replaced by bedded 
sandstone and shale which carries marine fossils. As we go still 
further north, both the arenaceous contact and the thickness of 
the upper sandstone member continue to decrease until the entire 
member is replaced by a shale. Thus the contact of the Peace River 
formation vath the St. John descends stratigraphically in a north¬ 
ward direction. 

The middle shale member consists of blue to black, 
friable shale. It contains no fossils, but it is considered as 
being marine in origin. It is about 30 feet thick. 

The lov^;er sandstone member is lithologically dissimilar 
to the upper one. At the top it carries large, spherical con¬ 
cretions, and is typically massive and cross-bedded. Descending, 
this passes into bedded sandstone and shale,the siiale carrying 
marine fossils near the base. The top of this member is probably 
sub-aerial in origin, but the lower part is marine. The con¬ 
tact with the Loon River formation is gradational throu^ a zone 
of bedded sandstone and shale, to a shale. 

The thickness in the south, in the vicinity of Peace 
River, is about 160 feet, but this decreases northmrd until 
only about 30 feet remain when Carcajou point is reached. 

The marine fauna includes the following: 

ITucula sp . 

Desmoceras affine {Whiteaves) 

Eoplites mcconnelli (Whiteaves) 

Ho elites canadensis (Whiteaves) 

Tellina dowlingi (McLearn) 

Pinna curvimarginata (McLeam)

Sorae of these forms also occur ir the ClearY/ater for- 


:riation of the Athabaska section. 

j The Petice River fomation is correlated witli the 

I 

p-rand Rapids fomation of the A.th8.baska section. It occupies 
j8- s'jjailar stratigraphic horizon and closely resembles it litho¬ 
logically, Coal seams occur in the upper p8.rt of both fomations 
,and the large concretions of the lower part of the Grand Rapids 
are very similar to those in the upper part of the lovrar sand- 
jdD.ne member of the Peace River formation. 

j The fauna Yrould place the fomation as Lower Cretaceous 


|altiiougii this fauna is quite unlike any described American fauna 
( 

jof this age# 

I St. Jolm fomation. - The St. John fomation is ex¬ 

posed at intervals along the Peace river from the Great Horse- 
! 

shoe band in the norths, to a short distance south of the toYm 
of Peace River. It also underlies the plateaus adjacent to the 
river in this area, but just above Peace River the Bunvegaa 
sandstone appears and underlies the platoans for some distance 
jbo the south. The St. Joim, hovjever, continues to outcrop along 

I 

jbhe river to a. point negir the mouth of Burnt river. It is also 

exposed along the Smoky river from its mouth upstream to about 
! 

Z mi 1 e s froia Rac ing creek. 

The formation occupies a position between the Peace 

River formation below and the Dunvegan sandstone above. Its 

contacts are conformable and the upper part of the fomation 
j 


grades into the Dunvegan sandstone through a zone of tliic-hedded 
iandstone and shale, the sandstone beds becoming thicker until 











67 


ths bas 0 of the Doj^nrogan is reached. The lower contact is not 
difficult to place, as the St, John fonviation is a dark s}?.ale, 
j-vmile the upper part of the Peace Riwer fomatioii is a marine, 

' cross-bedded, creaia-coloured sandstone. 

The St* John, formation consists essentially of dark 
'grey, friable, and often paper-thin carbonaceous shale, which 
■carries some ironstone bands and concretions. In the vicinity 
of Peace River, the thickness is estimated to be from 500 to 
1540 feet, and on Smoky river it is thought to be about 560 feet. 

I 

The lithology and the fact that the bedding, where 

mt shows, is quite thin, would indicate a marine origin. 

The formation is not vein, fossiliferous, but the 

follomng marine forms have beeh found: 

Nucula doY/lingi (Me Learn) 

' Acanthoc oru s cornut^um., ( YAiit.a ave s) 

; Inocer-aiaus, sp. 

: The formation occupies a position at the base of the 

:Colorado group of the Upper Cretaceous in this area. This is 
based upon the fact that it contains, among its very sparse 
fa.iAi'ia, the type of Aimnoni'he and Inoceramu s ?^^hich does not occur 
jin North America earlier than the Colorado* It is correlated 
Idirectly mth the Pelican shale of the Athabaska section, and 
is Torobably the equivalent of the Bla.ckstone and Lo?/er Benton 
fomatioiis of the foothills belt further south.

! Smoky river. 

' The formation lies between the St. John below and the 

Smoky River formation above, the lower contact being gradational 
from sandstone dox-m into the shale of the St, Johji formation. 

Its separation from the overlying Smoky River formation may be 
based upon lithology, as the low&r part of the latter is 
essentially a dark shale, while the upper part of the DiJinvegan 
is an alternation of shale and sandstone. 

The forruation consists of thick zones of concretionary, 
(massive and cx’oss-bedded sandstone, with bads of sub-aerial 
shale, which alternate ?fith thick zones of thin-bedded sand- 
.stone and shale. Some thin coal seams are also present. The 
nipper, thin-bedded'sandstone and shale are probably marine in 
;origin, ^^vhile a large part of the remainder is sub-aerial, as 
shoiAm by the presence of coal seams- The thickness is estimated 
at about 440 feet on the Smoky river. 

The formation contains a small fauna which includes 
marine, brackish and fresh^jater forms, some of wdiich are as

valley sides and the adiacent plateaus along the Smoky river fraa 
Smoky to within 10 miles of the mouth of the Bad Heart river, 
knd. the lower valley sides from Bad Heart river to about one 
mile from Kleskum creek. It also underlies the higher valley 
sides and adjacent plateaus from about 12 miles belovj the mouth 
of Hacing creek to Smolq;". 

i 

The fomation lies between the Dumvegan sandstone be- 
:Low and the Wapiti formation above, and is conformable with them . 
jBoth contacts are somewhat gradational. The upper part of the 
punvegan is an alternation of shale and sandstone beds, v/hile 
nhe lower part of the Smoky River is essentially a dark shale. 

The upper part of the ^noky River is also a dark shale mth 
some sandstone beds, while the base of the Wapiti is a massive 
sandstone of non-marine origin, 

! The Smoky River formation can be divided ,on lithological 

evidence, into three members: an urjper and a lower shale sepa- 
ra;bed by middle sandstone called the Bad Heart sauidstone. 

The lower shale member consists, in its lower part, of 
dark, carbonaceous shales V'jiriich are paper-thin and carry some 
concretions. Above this the shales become friable, and still 
higher are thin-bedded sandstones and shales. The whole of this 
]ower member is of a marine origin. In tlie lower part are found; 










Acanthocar a s of. coloradoensis (Henderson)

; Above these occur the following foms:

The Bad Heart sandstone meraber, above this lower 
I shale, consists of a coarse sandstone which weathers to a red.dish 
’ brorra. colour. This member is only from 10 to 25 feet thick and 
I stands out conspicuously in cliff-form from Puslamskau river 
^ to ¥n.thin a fe'v miles of the Little Smoky. It foms a hori-' 

I zontal band in the steep shale walls. This member is quite 


fossiliferous, containing such foms as: 

Eaculites, cf . anceps (Lamarck) 

Baculifaes cf. asper (Morton) 

Scaphites ventricosus (Meek & Hayden)

This member is also marine, as shown by the above fauna 
The combined thickness of the loY/er shale member and the Bad

These two members are placed in the Colorado group of 


the Upx^er Cretaceous. The base of the lower shale member is

It is notsd that a few foms such as Oxyl^oma n eb ra.soana , 
Ptaria longuifomis and ^ucula of. cancellata^ whioh are very 
closely related to characteristic Montana forais, grade doi/m into 
the Upper Colorado in this area. The later fauna can be com¬ 
pared mth that of the Upper Colorado of the Crowsnest river 
section where Oxytoma nebrascana. has beenfbund. 

The upper shale member of the Smoky River forraation 
consists of a dark^ friable shale containing some thin bands 
of sandstone near the top. There are also come concretionary 
ironstone bands present. Thin bedding and the presence of 
marine fossils, indicate a marine origin for this member. Its 
thickness is about 300 feet on Smoky river. 

About 100 feet above the base is found Daoulites ovatus , 
and at about 250 feet above the base occur Ilucula cf . cancellat a 
and Oxytoma nebrascana. 

This upper member of the Smoky River formation is 
considered as Montana in age, on a basis of Baculites ovatus. 

It may also be the equivalent of the upper LaBiche of the 
Athabaska section, and represent the same tme as the Milk 
River and Pakovdci of southern Alberta, 

Wapiti formation . The Wapiti formation is in¬ 
termittently exposed along the Smoky river from Bezanson, 

•which is just below the mouth of Wapiti river, aLnost to the 
mouth of the Bad Heart river. It is a cliff-marker in many of 





























its exposures* 

The Wapiti overlies the Smolcy River formation^ the 
contacts being quite conformable. It is separated from the 
I Smoky River on lithological groimds^ the lower part of the 
j Wapiti being sandstone of continental origin, while the 
upper Smoky River is essentially a dark shale. The upward ex¬ 
tent of the formation is not knoim, and it is the highest 
■ fomation occurring in this area. 

I It consists essentially of thick, massive and cross- 

bedd.ed sandstone containing some fiat concretions. There is 

1 

I also grey to dark carbonaceous shale shomng vertical rootlets, 

‘ and varying from about 2 feet to over 50 feet in thickness. 

I The sandstone often vz-eathers into partly detached pillar-like 

5 

' forms which are sometimes capped by concretions. Some thin 
coal seams are present,* one having a maximum thickness of about 
! 4 inches occurs about 560 feet above the base, and another, 

^ which is 3 to 4 inches thick, about 180 feet above the base. 

The Yfapiti fomation is continental in origin and the 
coal seams would indicate sub-aerial conditions during at least 
, part of the time represented by the formation. On the Smoky 
^ river, about 900 feet are exposed in one section. 

It is assigned to the Montana group of the Upper 
Cretaceous and occupies the stratigraphic position of the Pale 

! 

and Foremost beds of southern Alberta, with i-diich it is litho¬ 
logically similar. PiOTizsver, as the upward extent of tlie Wapiti 
is not knomi, it'is not possible to say just how far its upper

i Structural Geol og\'' 

A few miles below Dujivegan, the Peace riwer turns 
and flows in a northeasterly direction as far as the tovai of 

' Peace Rirer. The strata here seem to rise down stream, showdng 

a dip of about 40 feet per mile in a south direction. 

A north-south section is exposed as we go north of 

: Peace River, and for the first few miles it shoves a south dip of 

* about 10 feet per mile, but in the vicinity of Tar island the 

structure is almost flat, mth a dip of probably 1 or 2 feet per 

j mile, Tdien Tar island is passed, there is a slight dip of a 
few feet per mile in a north direction to about 10 miles below 

: the mouth of Gadotte river. North of this is a gentle rise, 
followed by a final flattening out of the structure. 

On Smoky river, to the south of Peace River, there 
is a gentle south dip, forming the north side of what is probably 
a large sjincline having its axis some'V'diere south of Bezanson. The 
major striicture does not seem to have any minor ones superimposed 
upon it, although there is some change in the dips and an ill- 
defined terrace may exist a few miles above the mouth of Smoky 
river. 

The above notes would indicate that the southward dip 
in the Smoky river area is a continuation of that noted north of 
the tovjii of Peace River, and as the dip changes to the north

Bull Head Mountain fomation. - This formation i 


soem in. the Peace River canyon about half v.ay betvreen Deep and 
Jolmson creeks, British Colimibia. The longer part of the 
I fomation is well exposed <it the head of the csnyon, on. Bull 

I 

I Head mountain, and on the higlLer hills to the west. It lies 

I between the Triassic shales below and the St, Jolm. fomation 

I 

i above, 


The fomiation consists of two lithological units or 
members. The upper one comprises sandstones, shales and thin 
coal seams, and is Yfell exposed on Jolmson creek. The lower 
pent consists of cross-bedded, massive a.nd coarse-grained sand¬ 
stones. The sandstones which overly the Pseudoiiionotis beds 
a.bout 4 miles above the mouth of Fish creek, may represent the 


base of the fomation. 


i 


It is estima.ted to be at least from 2500 to 3000 feet 


jin thickness in eastern British Columbia, and is almost entirely 

I 

■of a. sub-aerial origin. Ho fossils have been obtained from the 
'lower part, but a few plants come from the upper coal-bearing 
ibeds and these would suggest a correlation wdth the lower Bl^ir- 
laore formation of the Crowsnest area. The Bull Head Mountain 
Isandstone occupies the stratigraphical position of the Loon 
iRiver and Peace River fomations fnrther east, and may be taken 
lad eq\iivalent to them. It is, therefore, Low^-er Cretaceous in 
age. 

It mil be noted that the maximura combined thickness 


pf the Loon River and Peace River formations is about ”1420 










i 









I 

, feetj iThile that of tho equivalent Bull Head Mountain foi-niation 
, is frow 2500 to 3000 feet. Thus we see a fairly rapid thickening 
,, of the fomation westv/ard. The Bull rlea.d Mountain fomatioii is 
^ also almost entirely sub-aerial in origin, while the Loon River 
is, in part at least, marine, and the Peace River contains much 
material of'marine origin. This would suggest that the Bull rle 9 .d 
i Mountain formation may represent a shorew'ard phase of the other 
, two formations. 

StJolin. fomn a tio n. - This formation lies betvfeen 
: the Bull Plead Mountain formation belor^ and the Bunvegan sandstcns 
i above, its contacts an*e quite conformable, and it may be 
separated from the overlying Bunvegan on lithological evidence, 
j the latter being essentially a cross-bedded sandstone, while 
I the upper part of the St. John is a dark shale. This contact 
is somewhat gradational, ■ as we have an alternation of thin-banded 
sandstones and shales upv/ard from the St, Jolin to the Buiivegan, 

! The formation can. be diwided lithologically into three 

members J .a lower and en upper sha.le separated by a middle sand¬ 
stone member which is much thinner than the o'bher two* 

The lower member consists of thi.n-bedded, someYvtiat 
■ arenaceous dark shale, and it outcrops in the Peace River canyon 
betY^jeen Beep and Jolmson creeks, ho fossils have been collected , 
but biie thin bedding and its lithological character would 
suggest 8. marine origin. It is about 800 feet thick. 

Th0 middle mem,ber is a massive, cross-bedded sand- 
' store, containing some vertical rootlets. It forms steep sided 






?8 


; clixfiS’ a-b bha Gate.'s and at Hudson Hope. This member is from 
; 50 to 80 feet thick and would seem to represent sub-aerial, 
delta conditions that v-rere more or less temporary. 

The xipper member is exposed, at the moiith of Deep Creek, 
j From the Gates to Cache creek this member underlies the whole 

valley slope. It also underlies the pla,teau north of the Peace 

i 

: from the foothdlls to the Cache creek esca.rpir.ent, 

I It consists of thin-bedded, dark, friable shale rdth 

I banded ironstone concretions. Soma fossil-bearing dark shales 
I ^dth concretions a,re exposed from a few miles below the mouth of 
I Ca.che creek to mthin 4 miles of Horth Pine river. O^rer these 
I are paper-thin black shales -without fossils, and still hiflier are 
dark, thi'n-bedded, arenaceous shales -^dth large sandstone . 
i lenses. Further doiA.'n stream these banded shales and sandstones 
i grade upward into the Dunvegan. 

The presence of marine fossils and the thin-bedding 
place this member in a m.arine series. In the vicinity of Cache 
creek its thickness is estimated at about loOO feet, 

\ The snail fauna correlates the fonnation as a wrhole 

;mth 'bhe Colorado group of the Upper Cretaceous. It is also 
■ corrolateci with the St, Johi'i of the east Peace Fiver area, and 
: it occupies tlie same stratigraphical horizon. The total t’nick- 
iness i:a this area is about 2180 feet, and in -bhe east Peace River 

iarea, it is only a.bout 560 feet. Therefore v.'e see an eas'bward 

! 

I thinning from the imountavins in British Columbia, The sub-aerial 
sa-folstone of the western formation may have its horizon replaced 
by shale in the east.

Dunve^an fo niiati on.~ The I>anv<3^an sandstone occur in 
the escarpment at Cache creek. It is also exposed on the lii^li 
hills in the north bank of the Peace, a little telo>- the mouth 
of Monta^neuse river 8.nd continues past Dunvegan. 

The fonaation occupies a position betvreeii the St. John 
shale below and the Smoky River fomation above, and it shows 
gradational contacts mth both these* 

It is essentially similar in lithological chs-racter to 
that dasoribed in the eastern Pea.ce River area, but -would seem to 
i have increased in thickness from about 440 feet to ‘aroimd 530 feet. 
Smoky River fomation. - This formation outcrops at 
the top of the cliff on the Peace below the mouth of Moiitagnouss 
I river to the band below Dnnvegan, It also underlies the adjacent 
plateams south of the river at Dunvegan, Only the base is pre~ 

I sent on -the Peace, and that exposed is essentially a dark friable 
shale -^wlth concretions and some marine fossils. 

It is assigned to the Colorado grciip,

s-'JiiL'n.it of the hil-ls is quite flat and attains an elevation of 
frora 4000 to 4320 feet above sea level. This uplo^nd area has 
been very irregularly dissected by nujiierous streams, the valleys 
of son© of which have formed radial spurs, and in some oases 
parts of the plateau have become disconnected, foming separate 
mesa-like areas. The House mountain is an example of this. 

The 3mn hills can be looked upon a,s residua.ls of 
erosion from the plains of pre-glacial times, the level of which 
TTQ.s probably 2000 feet higher than at the present time. They 
may be favourably compared with the Cypress hills of southeastern 
Alberta. 

Stratig raphy^ 

i The stratigraphy in this area v;ould seem to form a 

i 

i 

‘ sort of link bew/Tcen central Alberta, and the Peace River area. 

The formations exposed are Tertiary and Upper Cretaceous in 

j 0-ge, the latter sediments being placed ‘entirely vmthin the Montana 
I 

jgroup. The Tertiary is represented by the Paskapoo formation, 

I-wiiich is essentially similar to that in the Alberta synicline 
i 

I further to the south. The Upper Cretaceous has the Edmonton, 

I 

’ SawTidge o.nd uuper LaBiche f oxmations. The Bearpsaw of central 

I 

Alberta is not observed in this area, but if it is present as far 
north as tliis, it must of necessity be very thin, possibly not 


over 100 feet in thickness.

area except at the mouth of Lesser Slave river, it would seem 
probable that the basin of Lessor Slave lake is foniied in shales 
of this formation, as it follows approximately the trend of the

^ that in the vicinity of Edmonton, where it is t^rpically exposed. 

Its upper limit is taken where two seams of coal, 20 and 21 inches

: summits of the Swan hills and fairly continuous sections are 
. exposed along the Drifbpile river. It also occurs on the west 
slope of Yiiallace mountain and around the summit of House mountain, 

I The fomation is similar in character to that exposed 

i further south and is correlated with it. Two fossiliferous beds 
; of hard calcareous shale are present, each about 18 inches thick. 
These are at the head of the east branch of Bruce river, about 
i600 feet below the summit of Wallace mountain. From these beds 
■ Yiviparus leai (Meek and Iiayden) has been determined, and this 
would indicate Fort Union tiiue for the fomiation.

FOOTHILLS BELT 


The area here discussed as the foothills belt extends 

i from o.bout the latitude of toYmsliii) 60 in the north to the 

I northern boundary of the area here called southern Alberta, 

I (Plate l). It also lies betvT0C3:a the Rocky mountains on the 

i Yj'est and the plains on the east. Therefore it takes in a strip 
i 

I or belt lying approximately parallel to the front ra3ig0s of th#

j Physiography 

j In general the topography of the foothills is inter- 

I 

; mediate betYfesn ths,t of the pla.ins on the east and the rnounbains 

j on the west. The foothills rise more or less gradually from the 

j 

I pla.insj and as one travels T/est he fi'nds himself in the foot- 
i hills^ and therefore at a higher elevation, rdthout noticing any 
j great change. On the western margin of the foothills there is 
I a rather sharp line of division between them and the mountains, 
j This is true over the greater part of tlie distance from the 
: International Boundary to the Athabaska river, but there are 
i places Yj-her© the foothills grade, up'ward into the mountains, 
ithe only noticable difference being the increased amount of 
; bare rock on the mountain after the els'mbion of the timber 
!line has been reached. This-general line of division can easily 
be seen. On looking Y^rest over the area on© sees a quite distinct 

i 

line formed by the uneven and serrated tops of the mountains 
rising quite abruptly above the land to the east. To the east 
















of this line, and outside the general mass of the mountains, are 
a few o\rblying rsuiges. These attain an equal eleYation. Yd.th the 
I general mass'of the mountains further west, but unlike them, 
they extend only short distances laterally. 

; The foothills consist of parallel, longitudinal ridges 

I which have a general noi-thY\rast-southeast trend. These, in 
I general, have quite rounded summits, and while they differ in 
elevation to some extent, they present the general appearance of 
i being at approximately the same level. In general the hills are 
I wooded, but there are many large open spaces, probably suit- 

I 

■ able for grazing purposes. 

The elevation of the foothills varies frora east to 

west, but on the east, where they first become a^Dparent, it is 

; from 3000 to 3500 feet above sea level. On the west, where the 

mountains begin and the slopes of the foothills present more and 

, moi’e bare rook surfaces, the elevation may be as high as 7000 

: feet. The level of the intemediate area rises in elevation in 

! a general vmty from the first to the lant of the two £ibove 

* mentioned figures. 

I 

The general parallel longitudinal ridges Tirhich con- 
; stitute the foothills are dissected almost at right angles by 

■ deep valleys cut by the dreiinage courses. Mosb of the rivers 
break almost directly s.cross, but some, like the Bow,, follow 
longitudinal valleys .for comparatively long distances during 

! their co'orse across the foothills. The stream gradients are 

1 

I steeper tovmrd the west. 


but become quite gentle by the time the 















85 

plains are reached. The valle^rs in the western part are steep¬ 
sided, and often as much as 200 feet belovf the level of the 
surrounding;; country. 

Starting; in the north and going southwesterly over the 
area, the main water courses are as follows^ The Athabaska river 
which flows in a northeasterly direction and vrhich is approximately 
at right angles to the trend of the hills] the McLeod, Pembina, 
Brazeau, North Saskatcheimn, Clearmter, Red Deer, Bow, Sheep 
and Ilighwood rivers. Each of these rivers has many small tri¬ 
butaries, and the whole system drains the area in a general 
northeasterly direction. 

Strat igraphy 

The fomations exposed in this area range from 
Devonian to Tertiary in age, and most of the area is covered 
mth a mantle of glacial drift. There are also varying thick¬ 
nesses of fluviatile deposits present in many places. 

The rocks are all of a sedimentary origin, both marine 
and continental sediments being present. 

Of the Palaeozoics, the Devonian and Carboniferous 
are represented mshnly by shales and li^iestones. These are 
exx^osed in the Bighorn and Brazeau ranges, which are outliers 
of the Rocky mountains. The Devonian comprises the Intermediate 
and Lower Banff limestone, 'v^jhile the Carboniferous has the Lower 
Banff shale, the Upper Banff limestone and the Roclry mountain 
quartzite• 

The whole of the Mesozoic is represented in this area. 
















I The Triassic and Jurassic are represented respectively by the 
!Upper Banff shale and the5 Fernie shale. 

I The boiiTer Cretaceous comprises the Kootenay formation. 

iThis extends over the ■V’diole of the area and varies in thickness 
from about 375 feet in the Moose mountain district to upmrds 
of 6000 feet in the area between the McLeod and Athabaska rivers. 

: This forraation is essentially continental in origin, 
i The Upper Cretaceous has both the Colorado and Montana 

: groups present. The fomer consists of the Blackstonoj Bighorn 
I and Ytoiabi formations. These are essentially marine, and have 
a wide distribution throughout the whole area. Between the Koote 
nay and the Blackstone formations is a group of rocks called 
Dakota, which are probably in part Upper Cretaceous in age, but 

i 

j-which cannot be referred to the Colo rado group. The Montana 
group comprises the Belly River and Edmonton fomations, and the 
■Brazeau and Saunders rdiich are roughly the equivalents of the 
first t?fO. This group is, for the most p8.rt, non-marine in 
origin, mth sub-aerial zones as ma.rked by the presence of coal 
' seaims. 

The Tertia.ry is represented by the Paskapoo forraation 
: vrhich is also continental and would appear to be continuous in 
I deposition yjith those sediments directly under it,

of these fomations occur only in the Bighorn and Brazeau ranges, 
where they cap the peaks in many cases. 

The Intemediate beds are chiefly calcareous shales, 
dolomites and doloinitic limestones. In the lower part of this 
fomation occurs a bamd of yelloT, silicious shale. 

The Lower Banff limestone consists of thick beds of 
blue limestone containing dolomitic and silicious concretions. 

The beds are, as a rule, very coarsely crystalline, and the 
limestone weathers into cliffs vdth very steep and often almost 
vertical faces. 

Fossils are quite plentiful, but in most cases they are 
not well enough preserved to admit of identification, but the 
identified ones place the age of the above fortnation as Devonian. 
The exact thickness is not knovoi, but it is believed to be in 
the neighbourhood of 3250' feet. 

Lower 38.nff shales; Dpper Banff Limestones; and Rocky Mountain 

quartzites. - In this area these formations are grouped 
together, owing to the difficulty experienced in fixing exact 
divid.ing lines between them. 

Most of the Bighorn range consists of these formations 
and thev also occur in the Brazeau range a little further to the 
southeast. 

The Lower Banff shale is essentially a yollovvdsh, 
calcareous and arenaceous shale which has at the base a black 
.figsile quartzite which breaks into cube-like blocks. This band 


is said to afford a good horizon marker in the Rocky mountains 

















90 


The fomation weathers quite easily^ producir^ talus slopes. 

The Upper Banff limestone is v/nitish in colour and 
I has darker shaly bands t>iDU£;hout the fomation. Some lenses 
I of ohorty concretions occur in the Imestones. 

; The Rocky Mountain quartzite is very thin, sho-wing 

; only 74 feet in one measured section. (Mem. 9E) 

I The Lower Banff shale is placed in the Carboniferous 

; on the basis of a poorly preserwod spirifer, but this may b© 

; doubtful, 

? Described fossils place the Upper Banff limestone in 

tlie Carboniferous. 

The Rooky Mountain quartzites have yeilded no good 

I fossils, and their age is detennined solely on their strati- 

: graphical position between the Carboniferous and Triassic. 

i In this area th.e combired thiolmess of the foimiations 

is about 1200 feet. On the Bow river they are believed to be 

I about 3500 feet thick, T.hil© in the mountains, south of the CleeiT- 

water river, they seem to be about 2000 feet thick. Therefore, 

the thiclQiess wrould seem to decrease northward. 

Upper Banff shale, - This formation is seen on the 

I western side of the Bighorn range up which it extends to various 

^heights in different places. The fonaation also caps the range 
! 

! at its north- end,

In the Bij^hom basin the thickness of the fomatioii 

is E93 feet but this is less than that found alonp; the Canadian 

Pacific Eail?ra.y in the mountains* 

Fossils found in tiiis formation place it in the 

Triassic. Somo of these are as follows: 

Monotis circularis. (Gabb) 

Fosidoiio mya sp* un-de^. 

Ferni e shale, - The shales of this fomatioii are 
seen to outcrop on the east side of the Bighorn range in the 
depression betvfeen it and the first longitudinal ridge. It 
is also exposed along the west side of tho Bre.zeau range and 
also at the head of Hordegg river. Further south this fomation 
is also recognized in the Moose mountain district* 

The formation lies between the Upper Banff shales of 
Trie-ssic age bolow^ and the Kootenay of Lower Cretaceous age 
above* The upper contact of the Fernia is difficult to de- 
teniiine, as the formation grades upwa/rd^ the shales becoming 
more arenaceous until they are finally replaced by the Kootenay 
sandstone, 

The Fernie consists of dark grey to nearly blacky 
soft aaslcareous shales* In the Saunders creek area there ane 
some sandstone beds toward the top of the foma/bion^ over wiiich 
is conglomei^ato nixed with very coarse sandstone, which is 
taken as the upper limit of the fom.ation* 

The Fernie formation hns a wery variable thiolaiess.

In ihe Bighorn coal basin it is given as 723.5 feet. In the 
Moose- niomitain districrb it is from 100 to 250 feet, and in the

foniiatioii above. In some cases, as in the area bet-^Taen the McLeod 

821 - 6 . Athabaska rivers an.d in the Saunders creek and Mordeg^; coal 

basins, the formation constitutes all the strata' bet/foon the 

Fernie beloY^" and the Colorado shale above. The whole series is 
i 
i 

; litholoLically similar and no definite horizon of regional 
^ importance can be found to divide it into Kootenay and Saiimore. 

I In the Bighorn coal basin, hovrever, the Kootenay is described 
I as being overlain by the Dakota, wiiich here is some 1800 feet 
: thick. 

j The loYrer extent of the Kootenay is someYmat vague ouid 

! arbitrary. For the most part, the dark shales of the underlying 
I Fernie gradua.lly become more arena-ceous until they are replaced 
j by the sandstone of the lower Kootenay, There YJould thus seem 
I to be a varying zone in wnioh the contact might be placed. In 
' the Canyon creek areo., HLime reports evidences of an erosional 
; uiiconfonnity at the top of the Fsriiio, but it is not Imorm 
: wiiether this is local or whether it has any regional extent, 

: In the Moose mountain district the contact is rep:crt6d as being 
quite conformable, and in the Saunders creek and ITordegg coal 

j 

■ basins the bottom of the Kootenay is placed above a conglomera„te 

: and coarse sandstone zone which is some 25 feet thick and Yfhich 
i 

is included in the Fernie formation. 

The upper contact of the Kootenay mil differ with the 
^ interpretation of the vertical range of the foimiation. In those 
pls-ces whore the formation includes all the stra.ta between the 
, Fernie and Colorado, the upper contact is quite conformable ajid

grades upmird from a grey sandstone into the dark shale of the 
Colorado, here, too, an exact dividing line is very difficult 
to place, as the lower bods of bhe Colorado and the upper psirt 
of the Kootenay are comparatively soft. 

In the Bighorn coal basin rniere the Kootenay is over- 
I lain by the Dakota group, there is reported a fairl.y distinct 
I boundary between them. The lov/or beds of the Dakota are com- 
■ posed of a ■p/hite quartzose sandstone which has a greenish cast, 
j The Kootenay beloYiC Yfeathers to a reddish or bluish-grey colour, 
j and the grains aro more finnly cemented. This division is based 
purely on lithological evidence. In the Moose mountshn and 
j Canyon creek areas the base of the Dakota is placed at the bottaii 
I of a persistent conglojmerate. Above this conglomerate is a bed 
I of almost white sandstone which is from.' 10 to 50 feet thick, 
j This may be the same horizon that is taken as the be^so of t-he 
I Dakota in the Bighorn coal basin, 

I In general the character of the Kootenay fomation 

i is fairly constant over the Yj'hola of this area, but some variations 
^ do occur, such as the positions of the coal seams. The fomation 
I consists of ^sandstones, clay shales, coal seams and conglom.erates. 

! In the lower part the slmles are luore carbonaceous than in the 
,;Ur?per, which, in the northern part of the area, weather to a 
light greenish-grey color. In the district between the McLeod 
I and Atlmbaska id vers there is a conglomerate comjxsed of rounded 
chert pebbles, under one inch in diameter and cemented, by sand 

I 

grains. A.t the north end of Folding mountain the conglomerate is 













95 


about 900 feet above what is called the base of the Kootenay, 
and it occurs as far south as the North Saskatcliewan river, where 

i 

j it still retains its approxmate stratigraphic position. In 

! this part of the ar;5o., the commercial coal seams lie about 700 
j 

; feet above the conglomerate, and in general this marks a lov/er 
' Koote-nay horizon. The beds above this, in the higher part of 
i the Kootenay, are of a greenish-grey color which is somewhat dif- 
I ferent to the darker shales and sandstones and coal seams below. 

j 

In the Moose moimtain area the lithological character 

of the Kootenay is simalEir to that of the lower coal-bearing series 
I 

j further north. Here the Kootenay is overlain by the Dakota or 

i 

I Blaimore, and all the coaH found is below the conglomerate, 

I 

j which is taken as the separation of the tYfO, The beds above, i,e. 

i the(Dakoti) are barren of commercial coal seams. 

I 

The Kootenay is largely of a freshmter origin adth 
I some suba.erial phases, as shown by the presence of numberous 
I coal seams. There is n large vantation in thiclmess over this 
I area, and in general the forrrntioii thickens northw/ard. In the 

j 

i area northwest of Brule lake the Kootenay group is about 6600 

1 

; feet thick. Of this 3600 feet is assigned to the Kootenay 
.coal measures, r/iiilc 3000 feet is given to the S^onset sandstone, 
[which is probably the equivalent of the Dakota and Blairm.ore* 
-Further south in the Bighorn coal basin the formation comprises 
;about 3659 feet of sediments. In the Samiders creek and Nordegg 
;coal basins it is said to have a maxinum possible thickness of 
ilSOO feet, and still further south, in the Moose mountain dis-

The stratigraphic position of the forraation and also 
the plant remains identified from it would place the Kootenay 
: in the LoYfer Cretaceous and would indicate a correlation rdth 


: 


1 about the Barremian of Europe. Most of the lower part of the 
Blainrioro is taken as Aptian and Albian, rmth the urrper 200 
feet as Cenomanian, If the Lower Cretaceous of Alberta is con- 

i 

sidered to be p)r«-Cenomaniori, it would necessitabe splitting 
the Blaimore somowYiere in its upper part to naake a division 
n^etween Upper and Lower Cretaceous. It ms stated, in connection 
mth the discussion of southern Alberta, that the basal conglom¬ 
erate of the Dlairmore in that area could bemused as the base 
’ of the Uijper Cretaceous, but from the above (^iscussion this 
;would seem, to conflict rdth the European divisions. 

; Blaimore a nd (Dakota) Fomatioiis. - The terns 

jBl8.irmore and (Dakota) would appear to have been used as synon^rnjs 
!by various Y/riters, and in this discussion the two fonmtions 
are assumed to be equivalent. In the SmolQ/", Ha,y sjid Berland 
^rivers area, Yfhich forms the northern extent of the area under 


I 





























97 


discussion, the sediments equivalent to the Dakota and Blaimore 

I 

have been called the Sunset sandstones. 

These foms.tions have a fairly mde distribution in 
the area. The S-unsot sandstone is exposed mdely in the northern 
part. In the Bighorn coal basin the Dakota outcrops along the 
'west slope of the first longitudinal ridge extending from the 
I Brazeau to the Bighorn valley. It is also exposed on the v/estem 
slope of the anticlinal ridge which lies south, of the horth Saskat- 
clieimn river and opposite the end of the Bighorn range. Part of 
the Blairmore is exposed on the Kananaskis river, and a section 
also appears on the Elbov/ river mthin the forest reserve. 

The fomation occupies a position between the Kootens.y 
I coal measure below and the Colorado s’nales above. The u^Dper 
i contact is in general gradational. The loYfer contact, while 
I quite conformable, has different markers in different parts of 
the area, and has been previously described in connection with 
the Kootenay formation. 

The( Dalcota) is essentially a series of sandstones and 
shales which differ in color over the area. In the Bighorn 
coal basin the loY/er part is a white san-dstons having a peculiar 
i greenish cast. Above this come shales Ydiich rreather to rsddish 
and yellovrish colors, while still higher are m.ors sandstones 
Ydiioh appear grey on fresh fracture, but rdiich often vreather to 
I a brown color. 

■ In the Moose mountain area the upper part of the Dakota 

I is of light colored snadstone, sliale and clays Ydiich B.re harder 



















There are ?;oTne 


ax'.d finer«^rained than those of the 3ell^' River* 
quite persistent red bands about 2 inches mde near the top of 
the forTmationj and these form a good horizon marker over limited 
areas. Below these upper beds occur darker and harder strata 
i which in turn overly lighter colored and coarser-grained sand- 
I stones. At the bottom of the formation is a sandstone bed which 
i is almost white and from. 10 to 50 feet thick. This rests upon 
I the conglomcra.te forming the base of the fo made ion. In the Brag 
! creek area there are at least two conglomera.tes in the upper 

I 

I part of the Blaimors from about 225 feet to 250 feet from the 
; top. These can be. used as horizon m.arkers over quite liraited 
j areals * 

j The .formation is largely of freshwater origin and 

j varies in thicdoiess over this area* In the Bighorn coal basin 
{ it is about 1800 feet thick; in the Boiw river o-rea it varies 


! from about 1000 feet in the east to about 2000 feet in the west; 


I 

! 

i 


at Moose mountain it com.prises only about 950 feet of sediments; 
wrhile on tlie Elbowr, wo.thin the forest reserve, the Blaimore 
has a total tliideness of approxim.atsly 1700 feet. 

Trie Blairmore contains twfo different floras, an older 


j one in about the lowz-er five-sixths, and a yo^mger one in the 
: L\pper 200 to 400 feet of the f oi*mation. The lov/er one is of 

r 

Loiwer Cretaceous age, wdiile the upper one is Upper Cretaceous. 


From this it iwould appear theda the Blairmore represents a con- 


tinuoi^s sedimentation rcfsrrable to t^Aro ages, between wdiich no 
apparent break or lithological ch8.iige occurs. x\s stated pre- 












viously, if \y3 allow that tlie Lower Crotaceous of Alberta is 
pr 0 ~Cenomani 8 ,n, accoi’din^ to the European section, and that the 
lower fine-sixths of the Blairmore is Albian and Aptian, while 
the upper one-sixth is Cenomanian, then ito would have to break 
I the Blairroore formation to make a division betwreen Upper and 
: Lower Cretaooousa 

Color a do ^roup . - Over the greater pant of the area 
here called the foothills bolt, the Colorado group consists 
I of three members: The Blackstone, Bighorn and Wapiabi. Those 
i naxaes are applied from the Athabaska river in the north to the 

I 

I Bow river in the south* In the Bow river section and south to 

i about the Elbow, these members a.re called the Lower Benton, 

j Ca.riium and ^pper Benton respectively. Still further south, the 

I middle member thins out and disappears, so that the wdiole Colorad. 

I group is called the Benton. Both the upper and the lower mem- 

;bers are dark marine shales, wiiile the middle one is a sandstone, 

I which proDP.bly renresents a shore pimse of the Colorado sea, 

‘In the extreme north of the area, what seems to be the equivalent 

^of the Blacksto:ae5 is called the Borland River shales. The 

I ■ 

;thickn.e5S of this is given as alrn.ost equa,l to the combined thick- 
Iness of the three members in areas further soutli, but whether 
jit represents the whole Colorado is not kn.owii to the waiter, 
lOver this Borland shale are the upper sandstone and sha.les, and 
gust hovr this compares vTith the Colorado group fui-ther south, 
jis also not certain to the wniter, 

j The group as a wdiole has a mde distribution in this

area. It fomc an aliuvost continuous belt alon(^ the vsouthwest 
side of the area botY/een the McLeod and Athabaska rivers,, ex~ 
tending; froii) the Peiabina river almost to the Athabaska. Pui-tljer 
south this belt extends to the NikanasSin range. In the Bighorn 
coal basin the group is also exposed, the Blackstone member along 
Blackstoiie creek; the Bighorn betvfoen the Bighorn and Brazeau 
valley on tlie second longitudinal ridge; and the Y[8.piabi on the 
southerly of tlie two main branches of Wapiabi creek. On the BoYf 
? river the group is exposed at intervals between the raouth of 

I G-rand Valley creek and Sesbe, a fairly good section of the Cainium 

1 

I 

I outcropping at tlic Calgary Power Company’s upper dam. On the 
Elbow river, in the vicinity of Bra.gg creek, the group aga.in 
appears, where it is quite extensively faulted. 

Blaokstone forimtion. ~ This member of the Colorado 
group consists chiefly of black, fissile shale mth very little 

I arenaceous material. A few ironstone nodules and layers, many 

I 

I of which contain fossils, aare present. There are also some 

I lenses of impure limestone, averaging less than on© foot in 

Ithiclmess. These shales are fairly soft, and hence break and 

I 

fold easily, thus rendering complete sections quite infrequent. 

This member is of a marine origin and occupies a 
istratigraphic position between the Blairmore of the Koote:iay 
igroup below, and the Bighorn or Cardiura member above. The 
upper contact is quite easily seen and is in many places quits 
sharp between the dark shales bsloYY and the lighter sandstones

of the area, the presonoe of comparatively thick, massive, fine- 
grained s^mdstones serve to Izaiiib the boundaries of bhe for¬ 
mations. In the B.ra^^ croak divstrict the upper parb couvsists of 
fairly tliin, lii^ht~£,rey sandstor'c, o'vGrlB,iii by dark shales which 
^rade up into sandy shales. This is overlain locally by a bad 
of con^^lcmerate up to 4 feet thick, but often absejit. About 550 
feet below this is a sort of repetition of tho upper zone, but 


here the coni;;;! one rate is practically b.1vtb.js present. It is sharply 
sei)arated. from, the overlying dark shale, and is usually from 2 
to. 4 feet tldck, and does reach 16 feet in. some places. Below 
this conglomerate may be from 40 to 50 feet of light colored, 
silicious sandstone, interbedded -jvith grey sandy shale, grading 


do\m into the lower Benton. A section of the Bighorn, as exposed 

on McLeod river at the mouth of Luscar creek, is as follows;

and in the Brag-;; creek area about 2000 teot is considered to be 
the approxiiTLate thiclraess. 

The Upper Benton is quite fossiliferous, especially

; The fc-mation is largely Colorado in age. The upper- 

i 

most partj T^hich contains Baculites ovat^af?^ would, on the evidence 
of this and otlicr fossils,' appear to be Montana in age. The 
: formation occupies the strutigraphical position of the LaBich© 

i 

forimtion of t}i.e .Athabaska section and the Smoky River formation 

i of the Peace River section. The uxjper shale member of the 

i 

Smolcy River forraation and the ux>pcr part of the LaBiche s'-j.J s are 
also characterized by the ipresence of Bacu lites ovatus,_ and mey 
'be corrslatable mth the upper rjart of the Wapiabi. 

Montana groux). - In this arcp. the Montana group com¬ 
prises the Belly River and Edmonton formations. In the portion 
I betvfeen the McLeod and Athabaska rivers it comprises all the 


















































stiT.ta above tlie marine Colorado, and v.'hiob Ik Upper CretaceoufS 
in a^e. This is called the Saunders fomation. In the Bi^born 
coal basin the y^apiabi is overlain b^' the Brazeau sandstono, 
wiiich. hero is the solo representative of the Montana group. .Its 

j 

j upY^nrcl extent is unloiOYm, ovmig to the upper part having been 
I 

, removed by, erosion. In the Bow river section and furthei’ south 

i 

in the Bragg creek district, the Belly River and Edjr.onton for¬ 
mations are raproserited. 

Sa,unders fomati on. - The bods of this formation have 
a Y;id@ distribution from the ITorth Saskatchevra-n river northy/ard 
i to and including the portion of the area between the McLeod and 
i Athabaska rivers. They overly the marine Colore.do conformably 

I 

and their upper limits cannot b® defined hers. Part of the beds 
may really belong to the Tertiary and correspond to the lower 
part of the Paskapoo formation. 

In general the formation consists of interbedded sand¬ 
stones, sh.alas., oonglonerates and coal sermis. It is in many 
I 

i respects lithologically similar to the Belly River fomatiori 
I although the rocks of the latter are generally harder. The 
upper beds of th© fomation are softer, not so yrall consolidated, 

and often range from a yellomsh to a broymish color, while the 

i 

! basal beds are usually light or greenish-grey in color. Between 
( 

I the McLeod and Atliabaska rivers there appears a conglomerate 
j iies.r the base of the fomation. In section 22, township 27, 
range 23, the thiclness of this is 75 feet. South from the 
McLeod, the congloracrate b 0 com.es more arenaceous o-nd on the 















106 


31ackston<? rivoi’ it is just a pebbly sandstone vrlth pebbles in 
lenses ill a coc'/i'’sc cross-bedded sandstone. ITortb-viest of the 
McLeod there is a series of conglomerates in the basal Saunders 
beds. In these the pebbles are seldom over 2 inches in diameter 
said usually less. It is very difficult to corrsr.cte any one of 
i the S3 conglomerates mth the tlrick one which occurs on the Mc- 
: Leod river. Coal seams occur at several horizons and in general 
I the number and thickness of these increases northimrd. Between 

I 

the IJorth Saskatchev;an and 31a-ckstone rivers only one coal 

horizon wath conmsrcial seams occurs, and this is over 5000 feet 

jfrom the base. In the Saunders creek and Nordegg coal basins 

j the formation ims divided into Upper and Low'-er Saunders , separated 
1 

I by Saun.ders coal series. The upper and lower parts have no coal 
seam. of commercia 1 size. 

Th.e Saunders is continente.l in origin and its thick- 

Sness varies. In the north it is estimated that somewliere about 

1 

13000 feet may belong to this foimiation. In the Bighorn coal 
basin,‘the Brazeau shows about 1680 feet, but the upper part 
has been removed by erosion. In the Saunders creek and ITordegg 
noal basins about 12000 feet occur, but some of the upper part of 
'this may be lonmr Tertiary in a,ge. 

The formation contains some fossil plants, among whicli 

!ara; 

I 

Pinus sp . 

Arun-do gr oenlandica (Heer) 

Platanus sp. 

The fauna is represented by the following:

Belly River foiniation. - In this area the Belly L'iver 
formation occurs in the eastern part of the Bovj- river section, 
in the Moose mountain district, and also on th.e Elbow in the 
vicirdt;;y> of Bragg creek. 

The formation, as discussed here, comprises those 
strata lying between the Colorado shale below and the Ediaonton 
formation above. They are of freshv/atar deposition and cor¬ 
respond to part of the lower Saunders fiirther north. 

The Belly River consists of a thick series of shales 
and sandstones, tho lithological units varying both vertically 
and laterally. The sandstone beds vary in thickness up to 30 
feet, the thicker ones usually carrying lenses of shale. The 
thickest beds of both shale and sandstone seem to occur more 
in the lower part of the formation. The sandstones are light 
and dark-grey in color, while the shales show shades of brovai 
and dark grey. Thin coal seams occur in the formation. Come 
arc at the base, but most of them arc toward tho top. On the 
Elbow some conglomoratcs are present. These are quite lensy 
8.nd wiien traced laterally grade into sajidstones. The pebbles 
va,ry from very small to 1 or 2 inches in. diameter, and arc 
chiefly of black chert and whits quartzita. 

On the Bow river the tliiclaie-ss varies from about 2500 


feet in the east to about 3000 feet further west. On t’ne Elbow

the formation is much faulted so that is is most difficult to 
e s t imat e any t hi cloie s s . 

From its strati{^raphical position and like litliolo^^ical 
charp.cter, the Belly River would seem, to correspond to at least 
XDart of the Saioiders and the Alliso.n formations. These latter 
tvjo are probably more inclusive and probably take in part of 
Yrhat is cadled the Edmonton in this area., 

Edmo nton formation. ~ In central and southern Alberta, 
the Belly River series is ovorladn by the BearpaY/ shale, which 
is in turn overlPvin by a series of fresliY/ater beds called the 
Edmonton fomation. The Edi.Tionton and BearpaYj- are separated 

large 13 ^ on lithological evidence, the Bearpa^r being a dark marine 

i 

shale. In the area under considera.tion here, no Eea^rpow is 
observed and the Edmonton rests directly upon the River. 

Here the Edmonton fomation lies between the Belly River for¬ 
mation below a 3 id is overlain in the BoYf river section bj^ the 
Paskapoo, In other places Ydiere it occurs in this area., it is 
the highest m.cmber exposed. In the Elbow river area it is pro- 
jbable that the Edmonton and Belly River represent a continuous 
sedimentation, and it is vcr\^ difficult to place any exact 
division between them,. Such a division can be made 'vithin this 
area onl^^ where the coal seam, ■'.diich is arbitrarily- placed on 
the top of the Belly Rmer, is exposed. In the Boiv river section 
:io satisfactory division can be made between the Edraonton am.d 
:)V 0 rlying Paskapoo, which is placed, in the Tertiary. For this , 
'eason the beds overlying the Belly River formation are described

as on® fomatioji. 

Tho foi-nation consists of inbarbcdded, 
sandstone and somcvfhst darker shale. sandstones arc '^ins- 

grained and up to 40 feet in thiolcness. They are usually softer 
than thoSvC of the Belly fiver, and rauich less dofomod. The 
lithological units, like those of the Belly River, arc len- 
ticular and vary /'rith short vertical and lateral distances. In 
i general the lower part of the fomation is dominated by arenaceous 
beds, follow'ed by more argillaceous strata, and this in turn is 
overlain by a second series of dominantly arenaceous bods. 

On the Bow river 'blie formation is estimated to have 
a thickness of a.bout 2600 feet, mich is probably a minimum, 
but how much of this belongs to the Paskapoo fomation is not 
apparent. 

The Edmonton is found to contain a frsshv'/ater fauna, 
while the Belly River is characterized by a?uTi.ost an absence of 
I fossil remains. The Edmonton also contains vertebrate remains. 
Fossils from the Edmonton include the follomng forms:

ROCKY MOIMTAITT AREA 

This area (Plate l) borders the footliills bolt on 
the e?st, and extends west to the vrostern bouiida.ry of the 
province. It oxtends south to the 49th parallel, and as it 
trends in a northwest-southeasterly direction, it crosses the 
boundary into British Columbia at about the 54th parallel. 

PhysiO[;raphy 

In a general vny the Alberta Rookies consist of a 
series of appro:--:imately parallel ranges trending iu a norihvrect- 
southeasterly direction. There are also nmicrous peaks rising 
many feet above the general level of the ranges. The mountains 
rise quite abrixptly from the foothills making a more or less 
sharp line of division. In sonio places, however,- the foothills 
seem to grade upward into the mountains, the only distinction 
being the ix.icreased om.ount of ba^re rock surface and the rugged, 
serro/bsd tops. 

The drainage system is for the m.ost part subsequent 
to the general structure. Most of the rivers occupy large 
Yfide valleys between the mounta,in ranges, but tliey occasionally 
cut transversely through the main ranges in seeking an eastern 
outlet. The u-shaped valley of the Bov^ river gives an in¬ 
dication of glaciation. 

Stratigrap hy 

It is not the intention here to give anx’thing like a 
full description of the rocks occurring in this area. Only one 




















Ill 


or tvfo sections in the vicinity of Banff and Lake MiyineTO^nJ.ca 
vdill he tabnlahed • ill order to ^^ive a ver;/ .^^'Peral idea of tlic 
snccoscion as it occurs. 

The area co im’ises roc]cs of all a 2 ;es from Canhri'^n 
to Recent, the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic al’’ having 
i; representatives. Ml tlis rocks ar^ of a sedimontary oriM^'^ 

I the greater part of them, are of marine deposition. Tho Cambrir'n 
; is divided into Lower, Middle a.nd Upper, and each of these con- 

i 

; ta.ins several formations. The Ordovician is represented by the 

j Goods ir and Gi^ptolite formations; the Silurian by the lialysites 

1 

bads; the Devonian by the Intermediate limestone; the Carboniferous 
by the Lower Banff limestone, the Lowor Banff shale, and the 
jUpper Banff limestone and the Rocky Mountain quartzite. The 
I Upper Banff shale is probably Permian. In the Mesozoic, the 
' Triassic is represented by the Spray River formation; the 
jJurassic by the Farnie shale and the Lower Cretaceous■has the 
; Koote.nay formation.
