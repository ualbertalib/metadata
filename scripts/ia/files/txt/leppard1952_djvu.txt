ABSTRACT 


A Dobson double - quarts spectrophotometer has been put in 
operation, and used to measure the total atmospheric ozone 
at Edmonton, Alberta, for the period August 2, 1950, throu¬ 
gh February 29 , 1952 . Observations have been made on the 
spectrum of direct sunlight, on the clear zenith sky, and 
on cloudy zenith. The first two have been compared to test 
whether empirical charts made at Oxford are applicable to 
Edmonton. The usual annual variation was found by constr¬ 
ucting a curve of 10-day averages. Departures from the 
average were correlated with surface Low and High Pressure 
Systems by a new method. The distribution around lows shows 
the importance of the cold front as the boundary of a relative¬ 
ly high ozone region. Investigations of Highs show that the 
polar-continental air mass causes the greatest ozone increases 
in the Edmonton Area.

I. Historical IntroO action: 


Since the early days of spectroscopy it has been known that the 
solar spectrum is cut off rather abruptly near 2900A in the ultra¬ 
violet region. In 18*78 Cornu suggested that this was due to absorpt¬ 
ion in the terrestrial atmosphere. In 1880 Hartley suggested that the 
absorption was due to ozone, and the bands which he discovered lying 
between 2100A and 3200A were named after him. This view was strength¬ 
ened in I89O when the Huggins bands were discovered in the spectrum of 
Sirius, from 3200 - 3600A* In 1917 Howler and Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) 
compared the ultra-violet absorption spectrum of Sirius with that of 
ozone, giving conclusive evidence that the absorption was in the 
terrestrial atmosphere and that ozone was the gas responsible. 

Since 1890 other bands of ozone absorption have been discovered in 
the long wavelength regions* The Chappuis band system extends from 
4500 to 65OOA, but according to Colange (I) the absorption coefficient 
is very small. The band systems in the red and infra-red have been 
studied by Maris (2) and also by Hettner, Pohlmann and Schumacher (3)* 
Three band systems are known with absorption maxima at 4.7yU > 9.6^U 
and 14.1 ^ * Again absorption coefficients are very small compared 
with those of the Hartley bands. 

Natural questions asked by the early workers were: "How much ozone 
is there, and where in the atmosphere is it located ?" Early attempts 
were made to extend the solar spectrum toward the ultra-violet by taking 
spectral photographs on mountain tops. This did not work, and in 1917, 
Strutt (Rayleigh) made the first quantitive estimate of the height of 
the ozone layer from observations on the rising and setting sun. He con¬ 
cluded that it lay between 40 and 60 Km. above sea level.

More recent and improved measurements by Gotz, Meet ham, and Dobson 
located it between 15 and 45 Km., with a maximum, at about 25 Km. This 
was directly confirmed by sounding balloon experiments up to 31 Kin. by 
E, and V. H. Eegener. The attached spectrograph (with an automatic 
recording arrangement) showed that as the balloon rose higher, mere 
and more cf the ozone was left below, and the spectrum gradually 
extended toward the ultra-violet. Similar results have been found, 
on 7-2 rochet flights carrying the same type of recording apparatus. 

Such direct investigations are made only infrequently because of their 
great cost. 

A more successful method was initiated by Dobson, who developed to a 
high degree of precision the technique of determining from the absorption 
spectrum, the total amount of ozone in the air column above the observer. 

He conceived and directed a measuring program (1925 - 1929), which showed 
up the large - scale features of the seasonal and geographical 
distribution of ozone. He also discovered large day - to - day variations 
about the monthly means, ¥rtiich were closely connected with the general 
weather situation at the earth’s surface (4)* 

While Dobson’s measuring program was in progress, Gotz and Dobson were 
attempting to determine the mean height and vertical distribution of the 
ozone. The best results were obtained by the Umkehr method of Gotz which 
is described below in section 3 (c). 

In summary, the ozone in the atmosphere is of the greatest importance 
because: 

(1) Its study provides methods of indirect aerology. 

(2) It is the wave-length range around JOQOA, which is biologically 
important, in the formation of vitamin D, production of erythema, etc.

The intensity of this radiation depends on the ozone content, and so 
the seasonal and geographical distribution of ozone becomes an important 
study. At the same time the amount of ozone is always sufficient to cut 
off almost completely radiations shorter than 2900A, which are potentially 
harmful• 

The short period daily fluctuations are less important biologically, 
but wherever extended series of regular observations have been made, they have 
been found to be closely connected with weather conditions. The most 
important new contributions in this thesis are a new method of correlating 
the ozone content with the synoptic weather map, and applications of this 
method to 19 months observations at Edmonton. These observations have been 
made with a Dobson Double-Q,uaj?tz Spectrophotometer, which was purchased by 
the Meteorological Service, and which was assembled and placed in operation 
by the writer under the supervision of Dr. E. H. G-owan. 

II. Theories of Formation and Destruction of Ozone in the Atmosphere 

An important development after Dobson*s 1930 measurements was the 
attempt to understand the presence of ozone in the earth’s atmosphere in 
terms of photochemical principles. Chapman(5) first discussed the 
photochemistry involved, and showed that the presence of ozone could be 
explained by the action of ultraviolet light of wave-length less than 
2400A on diatomic oxygen, as follows: 

Oi + hi) O + O > 
o ■+ 

where M represents any third body, needed to absorb the extra energy and 
momentum in a three-body collision. 







• t

The collision of an excited oxygen molecule with O 2 can also produce 


ozone: 


Ot 4 - O3 4 Oj 

o 4 O, 0 3 + A? 


In the first reaction an O 2 molecule, which has been excited to a high 
energy level by absorption of ultraviolet light reacts with a normal 
molecule, and one atom is transferred. The free oxygen atom can then combine 
with Oo by a three-body collision process. Kreusler has calculated that 
these reactions start at about 45 Km., where the intensity of solar ultra¬ 
violet is still sufficient to cause them, and where the density is large enough 
that three-body collisions are reasonably frequent. This is higher than the 
ozone maximum at 22-25 Km,, and it is thought that convection currents carry 
the 0^ down to the lower level. 

Ozone is destroyed again by photo-dissociation, and also by collision 
with atomic oxygen. Thus 

Q 3 .f la T? 4 O ° r O3 + O 2- &Z. 

It has been observed in the laboratory that the longest wavelength which can 
dissociate ozone is 11, 800A (6). However, as far as the atmosphere is 
concerned, the spectral region mainly responsible for the destruction of 
ozone is that of the Hartley absorption bands (2100-3200A)* 

On the basis of these two mechanisms, Wulf and Deming (7) calculated an 
equilibrium vertical distribution of ozone, which is in good agreement with 
the observed average distribution. However, they showed that if ozone is 
transported to levels below the normal ozone maximum by convection or 
other means, it may persist in non-equilibrium amounts for several days, 
because the intensity of the radiations which initiate the photochemical 
reactions is small.

Hence the amount of ozone tends to he conserved in a low level air mass 
until lost through chemical decomposition* Above the normal ozone level the 
return to equilibrium is comparatively rapid.

(b) Total Ozone Content : 

The method used by Fabry and Buisson, and further developed by Dobson, 
to determine the total amount of ozone, depends on measurements of the 
intensity of the solar spectrum at wave-lengths for which the absorption 
coefficients of ozone are known, and which are not absorbed by other 
atmospheric gases. This can be done with any form of ultra-violet 
spectrometer^ using either photographic density or photo-electric methods 
to measure the intensity.

To obtain x using an ordinary photoelectric spectrometer, observations

L= Lo - Cd- elO-X^A, -({S-/3’')™' - («1 

A curve of / rs yU- is plotted for the day in question, giving a curve such 
as (Cl) in Figure(2). Then by adding to each ordinate the corresponding 
value of m, a curve (b) is obtained, which represents the 

variation of L Q -( )%jU. with JLL . Extrapolation to /U r o gives the 

value of L , and x can be obtained either from equation (4), or from the 
slope of curve (e), Fig.2.

Extrapolation to obtain L Q 










The greatest disadvantage in carrying out this method with an 
ordinary spectrophotometer is the time required to make a determination, 
during which it must be assumed that the ozone is constant* Scattering 
within the instrument must also be reduced to a minimum, since this can 
be a serious disturbance in a spectral region which is of low light 
intensity. 

Dobson’s double-quartz spectrophotometer is particularly designed to 
avoid these errors* It is described in detail in Section 4* r £he ratio 
L is obtained from this instrument by rapidly comparing the light of two 
wavelengths 2 and by means of a photomultiplier tube* By attenuation 
of 2 'with an optical wedge, the intensities I and I* are made equal. The 
ratio I/I’ is therefore determined from the wedge reading. The new 
instrument is sensitive enough that this ratio can be obtained by observing 
the zenith sky on clear or cloudy days, as well as direct sunlight. Other 
instruments can only be used with direct sunlight. 

(c) Vertical Pistribut1 on : The Umkehr Effect ; 

G-otz* method of determining the vertical distribution involves measuring 
the light scattered from the zenith sky, at wave-lengths 2 and 2' , 
when the sun is near the horizon. In direct sunlight the intensity ratio, 
1/1 ’decreases continuously as the sun’s zenith distance increases, and the 
path length through ozone increases. The corresponding intensity ratio, 
i/i*, in the scattered zenith light behaves in the same way when the sun 
is high. However, the scattering comes from all levels in the atmosphere, 
with a certain small portion from above the ozone layer. When the sun is 
low this latter portion suffers much less relative absorption by the ozone 
than the direct sunlight. At the same time, because the Rayleigh scattering 
is proportional to ' /i ' ^ /j 1 •

For a solar zenith angle of about 85°, the ratio i/i* actually passes 
through a minimum, and increases again when the sun is still lower (the TJmkehr, 
or inversion of the zenithal ozone effect)» The details of the calculations 
need not be given here. It is sufficient to notice that the Umkehr angle 
depends on the proportion of air mass above and below the ozone layer, and 
so gives the mean height of the ozone. Further, the behavior of the ratio 
i/i* around its minimum gives an estimate of the vertical distribution of 
ozone> (°>) ■ 

TV Method of Observation s 

(a) Description of the Instrument : 

The Dobson spectrophotometer used to make observations recorded in this 
thesis contains (i) a double spectrometer for isolating the required 
wavelengths, and (ii) a photo-multiplier tube and A-C amplifier for measuring 
the relative intensities of these wavelengths, 

A rotating shutter allows the two wave-lengths being compared to fall 
alternately on the cathode of the photomultiplier, with a frequency of 
about 20 cycles per second. One of the wave-lengths passes through an 
adjustable optical wedge of tinted gelatin on quartz. The wedge is 
adjusted to make the final intensities equal, so that the output of the 
AC amplifier is zero. The dial reading of the wedge adjustment is then 
a measure of the relative intensity of the wave-lengths to be compared. 

A calibration table is provided with the instrument to convert dial 
reading fi into the quantity N^ 100 (Lq-L) (section 3(a)), which is the 
datum used to calculate the ozone content ( section 5(h)). 

The general appearance of the instrument ready for operation is 
shown in Figure 3. As it is heavy and must be moved about according 
to the position of the sun, it has been mounted on a wheeled stand, 
which carries the power supplies, battery, and accessories on a shelf below.

FIGURE 3 DOBSON DOUBLE - QUARTZ SPECTROPHOTOMETER 






















11 . 


The size of the instrument is approximately 5* x l 1 6” x 1* 2'\ 

The case and many of the parts are made of Hiduminium aluminum alloy. 

Most of the optical parts are necessarily of quartz. Fig. 4 is a plan 
view of the instrument with cover removed, showing their position in 
relation to that of the photomultiplier tube amplifier, grid bias 
battery, etc. 

Figure 5* is a vertical section, and shows the optical system. The 
sun-director, shown in position in Fig, 3 is used only when direct 
sunlight is being observed. It consists of a movable prism and lens, of 
quartz, which concentrates the light on the entrance window F (Fig. 5) in 
the top of the case. Because of the strong intensity of direct sunlight, a 
ground quartz disc is usually placed over the window to diffuse the beam 
from the sun-director. For observations on Zenith-sky, the sun-director 
and the disc are removed. 

From the window F, the light is reflected by a right-angled prism on 

to the slit (G-) of the first spectrometer. This consists of a quartz 

collimator, a 60 ^ prism, and a mirror which reflects the light back 

through the prism and a lens to form a spectrum in the focal plane of 

the instrument. The required wavelengths are isolated by means of slits 

(S 2 ,S^,S/ J< ) in the focal plane. For convenience, the isolating slits are 

in a plane at right angles to the axis of the instrument and the beam 

falling on S is brought into focus in this plane by a special achromatizing 
4 

lens. The light emerging from the set of slits is recombined by the 
second spectrometer and focussed on the slit of the photomultiplier 
housing. The device of the double spectrometer reduces to a minimum the 
amount of scattered light entering the photomultiplier. Even so, diffused 
light inside the case nay, at times, be comparable in intensity with the 

weak ultra-violet lines beijg compared. For this reason the photomultiplier 


housing is made lightproof, and an ultraviolet filter is placed

Thick quartz plates, (H and A, Fig* 5)? are mounted immediately in 
front of the first and last slits (G and B, Fig* 5)» These can be rotated 
about a horizontal axis by pointers and Q 2 ) which move over scales on 
the outside of the instrument* When the quartz plates are inclined to the 
direction of the ray of light, the ray is refracted and displaced upwards 
or downwards. By this means, the wavelengths falling on the photomultiplier 
can be changed, according to the following table, which shows the wave¬ 
lengths which pass slits S 2 , S^, and S 4 , for four settings of the pointers*

The setting (c) is that recommended and used by Dobson, and his 
practice has been followed in the present series of observations. 

Additional information to be used in section V is shown for 
the standard wavelength setting. The values of the ozone absorption 
coefficients,oC, are those of Ny Tse-Ze and Choong Shin Piaw (10)* 

The values of have been calculated by the Rayleigh Scattering 
formula. An additional adjustment of plate H, Fig. 5> can made 
to compensate for changes in the refractive index of the quartz 
prisms, due to temperature changes, and also for expansion and contraction 
of the metal portions of the instrument* A thermometer extends into

the instrument gives the correct setting of at different temperatures. 

Located to the left of the set of slits is the rotating shutter. 
Immediately behind it are two sliding shutters, operated by push rods 
which pass through the base of the instrument. By manipulation of 
these shutters, either and S^, or and can be exposed* 

When the rotating shutter is stationary, any one slit can be selected. 

The optical wedge is mounted in front of slit S^, which is common 
to both the short and long pairs. 

(b) electrical and mechanical -v -3 terns: 

The IP28 photomultiplier tube behind slit is connected to the 
first grid of a 3-stage lew fequency amplifier, which is built inside 
the main instrument housing, as shown in Pig. 3. Only fluctuations in 
current caused by the rotating shutter are amplified. These are 
rectified by a commutator on the shutter shaft into a pulsating uni¬ 
directional current which is read on a heavily damped B-C micro-ammeter. 

If the currents produced by the cell for the two wavelengths are equal, 
th A-G amplifier is net affected and there is no current in the output 
circuit. 

The two power supply units which this instrument requires were 
built by the writer. The high voltage supply provides about 1000 volts, 
well regulated, for the photomultiplier. The low voltage supply provides 
115 volts for the amplifier plate circuits, and has a built-in charging 
circuit for the two-volt storage batter} 7- which heats the amplifier 
filaments. Circuit diagrams of the amplifier and of the power supplies 
are included in the Appendix. 

The motor which drives the shutter shaft operates on the same 110- 
volt A-G, line which the power supplies use. A long extension cord runs 
from the wheeled stand to the nearest power outlet.

The motor just mentioned is nob the original unit which arrived 
with the instrument, but was installed by the writer to replace an 
antiquated spring-driven phonograph motor. 

(c) Operation cf the Instrument : 

Three different methods have been used: 

(i) With direct sunlight: The instrument bas been used both 

outside and indoors. In the latter case the sunlight was reflected 
through an open window to the sun director by a front-aluminized 
mirror. Repeated tests made with and without this mirror indicated 
a negligible effect on the ozone value. 

Two methods of obtaining the dial reading of the optical wedge 
were used. For some of the observations the microarnraeter was 
balanced three times, the wedge dial read visually each time, and 
the average of the three readings taken as the value of R required. 
The limits of error in this method were estimated to be + degree. 
Greater accuracy could be obtained with a smoked disc device, and 
this was used for most of the observations. This unit is shown in 
position in Fig. 3, and its operation is indicated by Fig. 6. A 
disc, which has been heavily coated with carbon by the method 
shown in Fig. 7 , is attached to the wedge dial by the centre 
thumbscrew. When a wedge reading R is desired, the stylus is lowered 
onto the disc, and the time noted. The wedge dial is then adjusted 
manually to keep the output meter balanced. At the same time, the 
pointer is slowly moved toward the outer edge of the smoked disc by 
the clock mechanism. The result is a small curve of dial position 


versus time scratched on the disc

When the output meter has been held steady for some time the stylus 
is raised off the disc. The dial is then set on exact degree marks on 
both sides of the tracing, and the stylus is moved across the disc by 
hand for each degree setting. This gives a series of reference lines on 
the plate, from which the average position of the dial during the obser¬ 
vation is easily found. An observation with the smoked disc lasting JO 
seconds was found to give a satisfactory trace, which could be read with 
an estimated error of X/lO to l/20 degree. 

(ii) With light from the clear zenith sky : The instrument was 
wheeled outside, and the sun director and ground quartz plate were 
removed to allow skylight to enter the window in the top of the case 
directly. One 50-second observation with the smoked disc, using the 
short wavelength pair permitted an ozone determination. 

(iii) With light from the cloudy zenith sky : The instrument is 
used outside as for the clear zenith method, but the long wavelength 
pair is observed as well as the short. When the smoked disc was not 
used, ten readings, 2 short and 2 long, alternately, were taken, and 
the average time was noted. When the disc was used, a 50-second 
observation was taken for the short pair, and a similar one for the long 
pair, and the average time noted, as before. 

VI Method of Calculation : 

(a) Direct Sun Observations : 

Equation (l) applies, and the procedure is as follows: 

(i) Conversion of dial readings to Log I/I 5 : An ideal optical wedge is 
defined (ll) as one in which any dial reading R changes to (R-lOOlog r) for 
an increase to r times as much transmitted light. The actual optical wedges 
supplied in this instrument were calibrated in England. Corrections, n, 
varying with the dial reading, have to be applied to R, 








*

in order to make the readings conform to an ideal wedge. A table of n 
values was supplied with the instrument. These include a constant, 
such that (R-n) approximates very closely to 100 (Lq-L)=N for the 
standard wavelengths of setting ( cl This calibration table was used 
in working out the results of this thesis, because it ensures that all 
spectrophotometers of this type, of which there are several around the 
world, are comparable with one another on the standard wavelengths. 

(ii) Calculation of the Sun 1 s Zenith Distance: In whatever way 

the measurements are made, it is necessary to know the height of the 
sun at the mean time of observation. This was calculated by means of 
the equation: 

Co-c z, - C4S £ cos -f £ Si" 0 

(iii) Path Length or "Air Mass" : For the calculation of the amount 
of ozone, it is necessary to know both the relative path-length of 
sunlight through the whole atmosphere ( the "Air - Mass"**?), and the 
relative path-length, ,through the ozone region. Bemporade has 
calculated the values of vn , as a function of Z, allowing for the 
curvature of the earth and for refraction (12). His values have been 
used in this thesis. 

Since the centre of gravity of the ozone in the atmosphere is 
from 20 to 30 Km. above the earth*s surface (13), the sun*s zenith 
distance (Z*) seen from this height will be appreciably different 
from (Z), the difference being greater when the sun is low. 

For small values of Z,

•i.S 


Z increases the values of JA and m diverge, and 

yiA m < Z 

However, since the ozone layer is thin and has a low mean density, 
refraction effects can be neglected here, and it is sufficient to 

put ur 5 €C ~Zj where ZL f dv — — 

'+ h /R 

(iv) Correction for Scattering: Table 1, which was included in 
section 4, contains the values of the coefficients^ and , used in 
this thesis. 


If Z is not greater that 68 L (14), we car. take m ~ JlA =sec Z in the 
correction terras, and equa,tion (1) simplifies to

where A is a constant for any pair of wavelengths. 

The tabulated values of ^ and ^ were calculated from the Rayleigh 
scattering formula (15), but there is some uncertainty in ? and § , 

Dobson has suggested that the correction A can be estimated from the 
horizontal Msibility of the atmosphere, with some experience, For the 
wavelength pair 3112-3323A, he has given the relation between A and the 
degree of haze which is shown in the first two columns of Table II, For 
the Edmonton observations the official weather observers 1 records of 
horizontal visibility are available. These are given in miles, and are 
based on observations of distant landmarks from the airport control 
tower. They are therefore much more consistent than any estimate of 
"light" or "heavy" haze. The writer has estimated that Dobson*s degrees of 
haze correspond to the visibilities in column. 3 of the table aha has used 
these values in correcting the Edmonton observations.

If Z is greater than 68 ^, and the horizontal visibility indicates the 
day to be clear, x can be determined from equation ( 3 ) with the last 
term on the right neglected, since then £ (Dobson). 

If Z is greater than 68 °, and the visibility is less than 12 miles, 

A can no longer be treated as a constant, and the complete formula (3) 
must be used. The correction then becomes

The values of ( $ - used in this formula were calculated 

from the values A given by Dobson, and are shorn in column 4 of the table. 

On hazy days there still remains and uncertainty of tP.QOtt in the correction, 
and therefore also in the tabulated ozone values. Readings taken under 
such conditions amount only to two fo of the total. 












(b) Clear Zenith Sky Observations : 


It is not practicable to calculate the amount of ozone from 
first principles for observations of the zenith skylight, on 
account of the "TJmkehr” effect (section 3( c ))® However, it is 
found experimentally ( 16 ) that there is a close relation between 
the amount of ozone as determined by a direct sunlight observation, 
for a given value of Z, and the readings obtained in a clear zenith 
sky observation. The accompanying chart (Fig.8) is based on a 
comparison of direct sun and clear zenith observations at Oxford. 

By use of this empirical chart it is possible to find the ozone 
values directly, from the calculated value of , which is 
related to the sun's zenith distance, and the apparent value of N 
at the zenith. 

The Oxford zenith observation chart does not necessarily 
apply to Edmonton. In particular, on account of the difference in 
altitude, there is probably a difference in the relative air masses 
above and below the ozone maximum. Therefore a difference in the 
intensity ratio, i f /i, in the scattered skylight is to be expected. 
For this reason the writer also has compared zenith sky observations 
with direct sun ozone values on a large number cf clear days. It 
was found that a constant correction of *7 to the observed values of 
N made the Edmonton observations consistent with the Oxford chart, 
within a reasonable limit of error. "Zenith clear" ozone values 
listed in the table of section 6 have therefore been obtained by 
applying this correction to N, and using the Oxford chart. It will 
be seen that, with a few exceptions, there is good agreement when 


both direct sun and zenith observations are available

(c) Cloudy Zenith 3Ly Observations : 

When the zenith sky is cloudy the principle of the method is 
the same as for clear zenith but it is necessary to apply a "cloud 
correction" to the observed values of the quantity N, to allow for 
diffusion of the light as it passes through the cloud layer. The 
principle of the cloud correction is as follows: When observing 
the clear zenith the short wavelength pair is used, giving 

R -n ( c N .-(9) 

It is not necessary, but the long wavelength pair could be compared, 

giving R* - = N* ,---(10) 

On a cloudy zenith both short and long pairs are observed, 

R a - n 3 ^N cC % -— -— - (11) 

*Ce -n 4 , - ---< 12 ) 

where subscript 01 indicates cloudy zenith observations. 

Not, workers have found, by taking readings alternately on cloud 
and on clear sky on suitable days, that there is a correlation 
between the effect of cloud on the short wavelength readirgs and 
that on the long wavelength readings. That is, we can write for 
the differences between cloudy and clear observations made within 
a few hours of each other, 

A N = -N, - - “ ~ — (13) 

A N* - N’c* ---(H) 

There is then an empirical relation betweenA N*, A N and jLl , which is 
displayed by Figures 9,10,11, fear different cloud heights at Oxford, 
Fig. 12 shows the empirical Oxford relation between N f , M and x,

for clear zenith, similar to Ffor the short wavelength pair* It was 
not considered necessary to correct Figs. 9 , 10 , 11, for use at Edmonton, 
since we are here dealing with differences, and the corrections ought 
nearly to cancel. 

For the few days on which it was necessary to use the cloudy zenith 
method the procedure was as follows: 

1 . and N f ^ were measured, y^alculated. 

2. A probable ozone value, x, was estimated from a curve of 10 -day 
averages ® 

3 . A probable value of N* for clear zenith was obtained from Fig. 12, 
using the estimated value of x. 

4. A (observed) -N* (estimated). 

5 . Figs. 9, 10, 11 give A//* and so N at the time of observation. 

6 . This value of N (with correction) was used to obtain a better 
estimate of x from Fig. 8 . 

Admittedly the ozone values obtained by this indirect procedure are 
liable to large errors. However, they are better than none at all and 
prevent gaps in the sequence of readings when working out seasonal 
averages. 

VI Observations : 

TABLE III includes all observations taken 
with the Dobson instrument and calculated ozone amounts from the time it 
was placed in operation on Aug.2/50 to the end of Feb./52. All 3 possible 
methods of operation have been used. Date and time are included for all 
observations, from which c«.sZ was obtained and tabulated. The corrected 
wedge dial readings N and N* as required for the different methods are 
also shown. Horizontal visibility or cloud height, obtained from

the weather reports, is included for each Direct Sun and Zenith Cloudy 
method respectively. At the extreme right of the table are the calcul¬ 
ated ozone amounts listed in columns x^> x 9 , x^ depending on which one 
of the three methods of Section 5 was used. It will be noted that most 
of the Zenith Clear observations were made for the purpose of checking 
Fig, 8, hence 2 ozone values (x^ and x^) appear in the table for the 
same time of observation,

VII Yearly Distribution: 


Fig. 13 shows the 10-day means for all the ozone values which were 
obtained from Direct Sun Observations* The curve connecting these values 
for the year 1951 is shown as a solid line* The overlapping portions are 
for August 2 to December 31, 1950 , (dashed curve), and January 1 to Feb. 
29 , 1952 , (dotted curve). 

The shape of the 1951 curve is roughly sinusoidal, with a maximum 
occuring in the months February to July, and a minimum in September to 
December* The portions of the 1950 and 1952 curves shown also seem to 
follow this pattern, A slight maximum was observed in the month of 
December, which Fritz and Stephens also noticed at Washington, but 
were unable to account for ( 17 ). 

Although our curve cannot be called average for Edmonton, without 
several more years of observations, the shape and amplitude are typical 
for this latitude. This is shown by a curve for Oxford, England, 52° N, 
after Dobson, which is reproduced on Fig. 13 , suitably labelled. The 
maximum and minimum values fall in approximately the same months, and 
are of the same order of magnitude. Dobson 1 s curve was obtained from 
observations taken over 4 years, compared to our from 19 months, and 
therefore does not show as great irregularities. Particularly noticeable 
are the high 10-day mean value in March 1951, and the low value near the 
end of December 1951. A look at the weather maps for these two periods 
indicated large scale invasions of polar air over the prairie provinces 
during the March high, and a period in December during which Edmonton 
seemed ”caught” in large low-pressure areas.

VIII Ozone Distribution in the Edmonton Area and the Weather Map * 

(a.) Previous studies of short period fluctuations : 

Since 1925, workers have been aware of large variations in the 
amount of ozone from one day to the next* Sometimes these variations 
are so large that the difference between maximum and minimum values 
in a given month is larger than the difference between the maximum and 
minimum monthly means for the entire year. By comparing his ozone values 
with the surface weather maps Dobson was the first to detect a close 
relationship between the amount of ozone and the pattern of isobars (IS)• 

In his method he first drew isobars to represent a typical cyclone or 
anticyclone. Then for each normal cyclone and anticyclone which occurred, 
the ozone values for each station were entered in their appropriate position 
according to the pressure distribution. Except for slight variations, 
other workers have tended to follow Dobson’s original method. Me©than (19) 
extended Dobson’s work for cyclones, and later Dobson, Brewer and Owilong 
(20), amplified the earlier results by separating lows into ’’young 
depressions” and ”old occluded depressions”. 

Tonsberg and Olsen (21), observing in Tromso, Norway, also related their 
ozone data to surface low pressure systems. Their technique is worth 
mentioning, as it was closely followed in recent work done by Fritz and Stevens 
(22) at Washington. On each day during which one or more ozone observations 
were made, the 1800 GMT surface weather map was examined. If a well- 
developed low centre was present, and if the observing station lay inside 
a cyclonic isobar, it was considered to be under the influence of the 
cyclone. Two intersecting perpendicular lines were drawn on a sheet 
of translucent paper. This paper v/as placed on the weather map

with the intersection over the low centre, and the perpendicular lines 
tangent to the latitude and longitude lines through the low centre. The 
position of the observing station relative to the centre of the low, was 
then marked on the paper, and the departure of the daily average ozone 
value from the annual curve, was noted beside that point. 

(b) Method Used for the Edmonton Observations : 

The method of correlation used in this thesis was developed after two 
attempts by the method just described failed to produce any worthwhile 
results. For every ozone value obtained through the day by the direct-sun 
method, the synoptic weather map for the time nearest to the ozone obser¬ 
vation was examined. For much of the 19 months the ozone observations were 
made every 5 hours through the day, to coincide with the time of observation 
for the synoptic maps. A curved line was drawn on a piece of tracing paper 
to represent the cold front of a typical warm-sector cyclone. Another curved 
line representing approximately the warm front was drawn on the paper, 
mainly to locate the centre of the low pressure system. Then, if Edmonton 
appeared to be influenced by a low pressure system (using the criterion 
of Tonsberg and Olsen), the tracing paper was placed on the weather 
map, with the intersection of the cold and warm fronts over the low 
centre on the map, and the cold front coinciding as nearly as possible 
with the one on the map. The position of Edmonton relative to the frontal 
system was noted, and the departure of that particular ozone value, 

(not the daily average), from the curve of 10-day averages was noted 
beside that point. Isozones, or lines of constant ozone content, could 
then be drawn on top of the frontal pattern for every 0.010 cm. of 
departure from the mean value. The results obtained by this method for 
our 19 month period of operation are shown in Figs. l4 to 22. Only two 
or three months were shown on one diagram to avoid crowding, and so

that any seasonal features would show up. Three hundred and forty- 
three low pressure systems were analysed in this manner. During the 
investigation just outlined* certain features of high pressure systems, 
with respect to the ozone values at Edmonton, were noticed. It was 
possible on three occasions to study the fluctuations of ozone as 
particular high pressure systems passed over Edmonton* These were of 
three common types: a large polar air mass, Fig. 2^, an anticyclone 
that developed over the Pacific Ocean, Fig. 24, and a round flat 
high which could have been formed through separation from either of 
the other two by a low pressure trough. Fig. 25 . They were examined 
with the hope of shedding some light on the possible source of 
the ozone fluctuations in this district. The ozone values at Edmonton 
and the date and time when the observations were made, were plotted 
relative to the position of the system, while Edmonton was under 
its influence. 

IX Discussion of Results : 

The curves for Edmonton shown in Fig. 15 suggest that 
meridional advection of ozone is the largest cause of the annual 
maxima and minima. It is known that ozone increases toward the 
pole, with a possible maximum at a latitude of about 60°N (2^). 

Edmonton, latitude 55°^? is close to this region. It is also toward 
the interior of a large land mass, and to the east of a range of mountains. 
Therefore low pressure weather systems brought in from the Pacific by 
the prevailing air currents are reformed east of the Rockies and frequently 
pass over Edmonton as young vigorous systems with a strong northerly 
circulation of a.ir behind them. Because of Edmonton’s inland location.

the fronts associated with such systems have large temperatures 
gradients, especially those of the polar continental type* Thus the 
spring maximum could result from the strong flows of northern air which 
accompany the well-developed weather systems at this time of year, itfhen 
the Polar front is farthest south. In the fall this front has receded 
well north of Edmonton, and our ozone values appear to be generally 
low. These findings support the views held by other workers. 

The investigation which will be discussed next gives more infor¬ 
mation on the cause of ozone fluctuations, and show that the horizontal 
advection which appears to shape the annual curve can also be one of the 
main causes of the daily fluctuations. 

Pigs, 14 to 22 indicate that the cold front of a low pressure 
system is very nearly the boundary between regions of above-average, 
and below-average ozone departures. This was also observed by Tonsberg 
and Olsen ( 24 ), who had results only for the months of March to May, 

1936 to 1939* The warm front does not seem to have particular 
significance, and the negative departures may extend well ahead of the 
warm front at ground level. The jump to higher ozone values immediate¬ 
ly behind the cold front suggests that the increase of ozone is 
connected with the northerly circulation of air which is present in that 
area. There are, however, several cases of circular isozones, which 
suggest that increases of ozone can occur in an air mass which is not 
connected with a polar source, and that some other process acts with 
the meridional advection to cause the observed distributions. 

A seasonal feature which can be noted on these figures is the 
spotty nature of the distributions during periods of low ozone on the 
annual curve. However, the contrast of ozone values across the cold

front is still quite pronounced. In many cases the change within a 
5 -hour period is as great as the difference between succeeding 10- 
day averages. These rapid fluctuations and their correlations would 
be lost if a daily average and one map per day were compared. 

In the investigation of the three high pressure systems, several 
important features were noticed. The polar air mass (Fig, 25) was very 
strong, and produced the highest ozone values of the season. The value 
seemed to be still increasing at the time of the last observation 
which it was possible to take while Edmonton was under the influence 
of the air mass. For the last observation plotted, the main polar 
air mass was almost past Edmonton, and it was impossible to confirm 
this suspicion. 

The high pressure system which extended in from the Pacific, 

Fig, 24, did not produce as great a contrast across the polar 
maritime front associated with it, but it did show values decreasing 
to the rear, as observed by Dobson and others (25), in a similar 
maritime air mass. 

This effect was also noted in Fig. 25 for the circular high, which 
showed the least ozone increase across the front of the three high systems 
studied. These results suggest that the second cause of increase in 
ozone (besides advection, which seems well established), is the subsidence 
which is known to take place toward the west side of a low pressure centre. 
In this region the tropopause is comparatively low and warm, as in 
far northern latitudes. Meet ham has shown that at Oxford large amounts 
of ozone accompany a lowering of the tropopause and a warming of 
the stratosphere between 12 and 18 Km, (26). At these low, protected 
levels photochemical processes cannot cause the observed increases. 
Therefore, they must result from redistribution of the ozone already

present, through advection and vertical motion, A uniform subsidence 
of the lower stratosphere would carry ozone down from upper levels to 
lower levels where it would persist for some time. In the upper levels, 
photochemical processes could make up the deficiency. The subsidence 
would also produce a convergence effect, which would lead to a net 
increase of ozone in a vertical column. 

This theory was put on a firm basis in 1949 by Reed (27), who showed 
that, of all the cases of large positive ozone changes which he invest¬ 
igated, nearly half could be accounted for by the horizontal convergence 
which goes with vertical motion. The rest he attributed to advection 
and localized subsidence in the tropopause, as suggested earlier. The 
results of this thesis indicate that Reed’s theory is applicable to the 
observed ozone distribution in the Edmonton district. From, the 
correlations made with low pressure, systems, it seems that advection and 
horizontal convergence work together almost equally, except in such 
extreme cases as an intense polar outbreak, or a slow moving high. The 
significance of the cold front with respect to our observed ozone values 


seems to be well established
