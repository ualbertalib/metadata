ABSTRACT 


Nineteen diagnostic species of microfauna constituted the most 
significant foraminifera found in the uppermost Lower Cretaceous strata 
in North Central Alberta. Previous literature carries descriptions of 
four of these Foraminifera? this study deals with fifteen additional 
new forms. Of the nineteen selected forms, fourteen are found in the 
Joli Pou formation, one in the Grand Rapids, and four in the Labiche; 
the fauna of the Pelican sand is considered a sandy facies of the Joli 
Pou fauna. The range and distribution of the described species is 
graphically illustrated. The basal. Labiche formation is correlated 
with a 90 * section 200 to 290 feet below the fish-scale beds in the 
Shaftesbury formation of the Peace River Plains area; the basal Labiche 
formation corresponds to the upper portion of the Buckinghorse formation 
of the Sikanni Chief River area in Northeastern British Columbia; the 
basal Labiche and Joli Pou formation are equivalent to the Lower 
Lloydminster shale of the Vermilion area, Alberta; the basal Labiche 
formation correlates with the lower portion of the Lloydminster shale 
above the Viking sandstone in the Redwater area, Alberta, and the 
Joli Pou shale correlates with the remainder of the Lloydminster shale 
below the Viking sand in this same area; the Pelican sand and the 
Viking sand are the coextensive with es.ch other and homotaxial with 


the Cadotte sandstone

Chapter I 
Introduction 


Introductory Statement 

Recent oil development in Western Canada brings a need for ac¬ 
curate methods of correlating the various formations contemporaneously 
deposited. ‘Various methods and aids are used to make these correlations, 
with paleontology taking a leading role. Considerable data has been 
compiled on macropaleontology in Western Canada, but scarcely any is 
available,as yet, on micropaleontology. The author offers this con¬ 
tribution to the knowledge of the micropaleontology of Western Canada. 

This dissertation includes descriptions and figures of the more 
diagnostic microfossils of the Joli Pou formation and includes cor¬ 
relations of this formation with the formations of the Peace River 
valley, Vermilion and Redwater areas of Alberta and with northeastern 
British Columbia. It also includes brief outlines of the paleo-ecological 
conditions which existed during the deposition of the Joli Pou formation. 

The Joli Pou is a shale series comprised of 110 feet of strata ex¬ 
posed in nearly continous outcrops along a portion of the Athabaska 
River from K.W. i Sec. 19 , T. SO, R. 17 , W. 4 Mer. to S. E. £,Sec. 19, 

T. g 6 , R. 17 , W. 4 Mer. in north central Alberta. Overlying the Joli 
Pou shale section is 4o feet of sand containing minor lenses of shale, 
known as the Pelican formation. The Pelican formation might well be 
considered a sandy phase of the Joli Pou formation as variations in the 
thickness of the Pelican sand are compensated by thickening and thinning 
of the Joli Pou shale. Por this latter reason, faunal studies of the 
Joli Pou include also the studies of the Pelican sand faunas. Pannas 
of the shale lenticles occuring in the uppermost G-rand Rapids formation

are included to permit evaluation of the stratigraphic hiatus involved 
in the Grand Rapids - Joli Fou contact. Shale samples immediately 
above the top of the Pelican sand yielded additional data on the range 
of the Joli Fou fauna. All faunas studied in this report proved to be 
from the Albian Stage (uppermost Lower Cretaceous). 

Material Used and Method of Collecting Samples 

Samples of shale were collected daring the summer of 19^9, along 
every outcrop of Joli Fou shale exposed along the Athabaska, River <*.nd 
shales of the overlying and the underlying strata were also sampled. 
Luring the following winter^ studies of these shale samples were under¬ 
taken by the writer in the micropaleontological laboratories of the 
University of Alberta, Edmonton. 

Sampling was carried out at 5 foot intervals except in the Pelican 
sand where sporadic intercalated shale beds were sampled as they appear¬ 
ed. Sim ilarly the upper portion of the Grand Rapids formation, where 
shales, were sampled down for a thickness of 4 q feet from the top. 

Shales overlying the Pelican sand were sampled also for a thickness of 
4o feet above the contact. 

Each sample was collected in a cloth sample bag on which was writ¬ 
ten its number, elevation and location; this information v/as also re¬ 
corded in field note books. 

Treatment of Sample 

Each individual sample studied was put into a pint sized pre¬ 
servative sealer and soaked in water until the shale broke down. The 
fossils were separated from the disintegrated material by ’•washing” the 
coarse grains and fossil tests out of the clay using a set of sieves 
with 2S, 48, SO, 100 and 1^0 mesh to the inch. The residue in each 
sieve was collected in separate pars and allo\*;ed to dry. This method

of washing was adopted because it provided for a maximum recovery of 
whole fossils since no rough handling of the material was involved. 

The residue containing the fossils was picked under a binocular micro¬ 
scope under magnifications ranging from 10 to 60 power depending on 
the size of grains examined. A pointed, long-haired, wetted, sable- 
hair brush (number 00) was used for picking. The fossils were trans¬ 
ferred to 10 cell oil-field type slides which were treated with gum 
tragacanth. 

Specific Count 

For correlative purposes a specific count of the fauna was maxle 
as the writer endeavoured to establish the relative assemblage of 
species present. All recognizable specific morphological entities 
were recorded, totalled, and their ranges determined. 

Hypotypes representing well-defined specific populations axe 
selected from various suites, described and photographed / and appear 
in chapter three of this paper. All hypotypes are in the micropale- 
ontological collections of the University of Alberta, Mmonton. 
Photographing and Drawing Hypotypes 

Representative specimens from well-defined specific assemblages 
were selected and mounted in special slides having one compartment; 
into each compartment was mounted four identical specimens. The best 
preserved specimen in each slide was then selected for photographing. 

For photographing, a Leitz Wetzlar M4B camera having a mag¬ 
nification of 1.&X was used in conjunction with a Leitz Wetzlar Ho. 
39^712 monocular microscope capable of magnification of 25 X and 50 X 
making a total magnification of 4^X and 95^ possible. 

Each selected specimen was then photographed, developed, and 
finally printed on contact matte paper. Only side views of the

fossils are photographed; end views and apertures are sketches. The 
fossils* pictures are cut out and pasted on a black cardboard back¬ 
ground to make a plate. Retouching of photographs is necessary in 
some cases to bring out important features. The entire plate is re¬ 
photographed. One such plate appears in chapter 3» along with 
descriptions of each fossil. 

Previous Work 

R. T. D. Wickenden (1949) published a paper ’'Some Cretaceous 
Sections along Athabaska, River from the mouth of Calling River to 
below Grand Rapids, Alberta” from a reconnaissance trip into the area; 
but although he treats of the microfauna, no detailed descriptions or 
photographs of fossils he discussed were included. Wickenden had pre¬ 
viously (-1944) reported that a micro-faunal zone was found in the 
Pelican shale, (now known as Joli Pou shale), at depths of 1,310-15 
feet in the Deca No. 1 well and from 1,570-90 feet in the Deca Ho. 2 
well. Wickenden also reported that the same micro-faunal zone appeared 
in the Pelican Kapids well, although still earlier reported (Wickenden, 
1930) as coming from the Clearwater shale, now known to be within the 
Joli Pou shale. P. H. McLearn (1916) wat* v lSr efugh the area while study¬ 
ing the Cretaceous sections from the town of Athabaska to Port McMurray.

Micropaleontology and Correlation 

(Part A) 

Discussion of Hicrofa.una 

Microfossils are scarce in the Grand Rapids formation. Only the 
uppermost 4o feet of the formation have been examined. Several species 
of Haplophragnoides are found but none are of diagnostic significance. 
Twenty-three feet below the top of the formation several species of 

are 

Miliammina became very abundant; among these is the species Miliammina 
QJB-76-23 (figs. 1, 2, 3, plate 1). The presence of these two genera 
suggests a brackish or shallow marine environment for at least the upper 
portion of the Grand Rapids formation. 

The basal 50 feet of the Joli Fou shale immediately overlying the 
Grand Rapids formation has at least 15 different varieties of 
Haplophragmoides ; of these the species Haplophragnoides gigas Cushman 
(fig. lg, pi. 1) has been selected as a zone fossil. This fossil has 
a vertical distribution of 55 feet, extending from the top of the Grand 
Rapids formation up into the Joli Fou shale. In the Haplophragmoides 
gigas zone, Haplophragmoides cf. cushmani (fig. 21, pi. 1 ) Loeblich 
and Tappan occurs quite frequently. Haplophragmoides lihki Hauss (fig. 
25, pi. 1), H. cf. collyra Hauss, (fig. 23, 24, pi. 1) characterize 
the basal 25 feet of the Joli Fou shale. At about the middle of the 
formation the numbers and varieties of Haplophragmoides diminish, 

are. 

0000ming .-abundant again near the top of the formation, the variety 
being less pronounced. Two forms, H. cf. excavata Cushman and Walters, 

distriWv/Pcn 

and Haplophragmoides sp. have a vertical 0:1 tent throughout the whole 
Joli Fou formation; they are also present in the overlying Pelican 


sand

Ammobaculites is f ather limi te d in the Joli Fou shale; 
Ammobaculites KB-72-6 (fig. 27, pi. 1) is found in the basal 50 feet 
of the formation. Ammobaculites fragmentaria Cushman has approximately 
the same vertical distribution, but is rarer. Ammobaculites tvrrelli 
var. At (fig. 6, pi. l) and A. humei Hauss occur in the basal 20 feet 
of the formation. The presence of Ammobaculites OB-72-0 n. sp . (fig. 
12, pi. 1) dominates the central portion of the formation. Except for 
several d g m^feul Ammobaculites GB-72-0 specimens near the top, the 
upper 4o feet of the Joli Fou shale is almost barren of Ammobaculites . 

Ammobaculoides ABZ-1-7 (fig* 20, pi. l) occurs at the base of the 
Joli Fou formation and has a vertical extent of about 10 feet. 

Miliammina first appears in the Joli Fou shale 20 feet above the 
top of the Grand Rapids formation; specimens of this form are never 
very abundant . when present, are usually well developed. The 
specimen Miliammina manitobensis var. C (fig. 15» l6, 17» pi. 1) has 
a vertical range of 90 feet, extending down from the top of the Joli 
Fou shale, to 20 feet above the top of the Grand Rapids formation. 

M. manitobensis var. C has been chosen as a zone fossil. Several 
other unfigured specimens are abundant in this zone. 

Vo.v. 

The presence of Gaudryina canadensis^ Cushman (fig. 4, pi. l) is 
restricted to the basal 25 feet of the Joli Fou shale. In this lower 
portion several other species make their appearance. The central 
portion of the formation shows few Gaudryina . Hear the top several 
badly crushed specimens of new varieties of Gaudryina occur. 

Besides the principal genera discussed above Hyoerammina EB- 
7^-45 (fig. 19, pi. 1) is present in the central portion of the Joli 
Fou section. Two species of Glomospira were recognized 12 feet above 
the base of the formation. A few very coarse grained Proteonina sp.

were found in the basal 20 feet. 

Plant "spores" were among the most common microfossils found in 
the uppermost 15 feet of the Joli Fou shale, but no attempt has been 
made to identify the various forms. 

The microfossils occurring in the overlying Pelican send formation 
consisted for the most part of "spores 11 . Hyperammina FB-7^-^5 » several 
well developed forms of Miliammina , a few Haplophragmoides and G-audryina 
occur, but no forms were found which were peculiar to the Pelican for¬ 
mation. 

The basal 4o feet of the Labiche formation carries Verneuilina 
canadensis Cushman (fig. 10, 11, pi. 1), which has been selected as a 
zone fossil. Verneuilina canadensis var, V5 and Verneuilina sp . are 
also present. The Verneuilina are not very abundant but are well pre¬ 
served. A few tiny forms of G-audryina, appear. Trochammina sp . is rare 
but is useful for correlation. The basal 30 feet of the formation is 
marked by a flood of badly flattened Ammobaculites sp ., and Peophax 
PA3-62-S1 (fig. l4, pi. 1) is quite common and useful for correlative 
purposes. Haplophragmoides , so common below the Pelican, is almost 
entirely absent from the suites of the basal Labiche above the Pelican 
sand, 

(Part B) 

Correlations 

Correlations are subject to two complementary possibilites for 
error. The occurrence of identical fossils in various areas often 
indicated that merely similar conditions prevailed in these localities 
during the deposition of sediments. Local changes of facies on the 
other hand results in dissimilar faunas and a consequent misinterpretation 
of historical facts. Such facies changes have been taken into consider-

ation throughout the investigation of this project. The correlations 
established, in this report are supported by paleontological evidence, 
but in addition stratigraphic position and lithologic character of the 
sediments, are incorporated. The writer has found it possible to 
correlate the Joli Fou formation, the Pelican sandstone and the basal 
portion of the Labiche formation with similar strata occurring through¬ 
out the central and east-central portion of Alberta and northeastern 
British Columbia. 

Correlation with Redwate'r Area, Alberta 

Imperial Eldorena Wo. 1 Well 

Wo evidence was obtained which would warrent correlation of the 
C-rand Rapids formation of the Athabaska River area, with any formation 
found in the Redwater area. The Mannville formation is sometimes 
correlated with the Grand Rapids, but the facies of the Grand Rapids 
is conglomeratic and quite distinct from the facies of the Mannville 
which is known to conclude with residual soils. This would suggest 
that the Grand Rapids represents deposition during the period repre¬ 
sented hy the stratigraphic highness between the Mannville and the 
basal Lloydminster. 

Examination by the writer of microfossils picked from the basal 
Lloydminster by Bullock (1950) from the Imperial Eldorena Wo. 1 well 
reveals a nearly identical suite of fossils to those obtained from 
the Joli Fou formation on the Athabaska River. In the Eldorena area 
a total thickness of 72 feet of basal Lloydminster shale was present, 
and from this shale the following fossils have been identified; two 
lists of fossils are given, one from the Joli Fou shale, and the 
other from the basal Lloydminster:

Conclusions 

The basal Lloydminster shale, Viking sand and the lower portion 


of the Lloydminster shale above the Viking of the Redwater area, 
correlate exactly with corresponding sections of Joli Pou shale, 
Pelican sand and ba.sal Labiche shale respectivel?/ of the Athabaska 
River area. Paleontological evidence is to justify correlation 


of the Joli Pou and basal Lloydminster formations. 


Both the fossils found in the Viking and its stratigraphic position 
between the basal Lloydminster shale and. the remainder of the Lloydminster 
formation indicate that it should correlate with the Pelican. 

Possil evidence allows correlation of the basal 4o feet of the 
Labiche formation and 4o feet of the Lloydminster shade immediately 


ft Fish-scale beds are considered to be the break between the upper and 
lower Cretaceous strata in Alberta (Stelck 1950).

overlying the Viking sand; the presence of fish-scale sands at similar 
distances above both the Viking and Pelican sands indicates complete 
ecmivalence of these two shale sections below the fish-scale beds. 
Correlation with Vermilion *12 Area 

The basal portion of the Lloydminster shale in this area which 
correlates with the Joli Fou, Pelican and basal Labiche consists of a 
series of grey shales with minor sandy lenses, and occupies a position 
from the top of the Mannville formation to the fish-scale beds. 

The Pelican sand, present in the Athabaska River section, is not 
present as such in the Lloydminster area. Instead, it is represented 
by a shaZy facies. The Lloydminster shale section up to the fish-scale 
beds is a continuous shaly series and is not broken into discrete for¬ 
mations or members as is the Athabaska- River section, nevertheless 
identical fossils have been found in these sections to provide correlation.

Conclusions 


- Ik - 


The lower portion of the Shaftesbury has been definitely corre¬ 
lated with the basal Labiche formation. The remainders of both the 
Shaftesbury formation up to the fish-scale beds and the Labiche formation 
up to the fish-scale beds are continuous series of shales without any 
stratigraphic break. On this basis it is reasonable to assume corre¬ 
lation of the remaining portions of these formations up as far as the 
fish-scale beds. 

No direct fossil evidence has been obtained correlating any section 
in the Peace River Plains area with the Pelican sand. However, since 
the Cadotte sandstone underlies the Shaftesbury formation and the Pelican 
sand underlies the Labiche form p tion, it is reasonable to assume at least 
homotaxial correlation of the Pelican sandstone with a portion of the 
Cadotte sandstone on the basis of their stratigraphic positions. 

The Harmon shale underlies the Cadotte sandstone in the Peace River 
area and carries Haplophragmoides gigas Cushman the principal zone fossil 
of the Joli Pou shale. The Harmon shale is equivalent to at least 

part of the Joli Pou shale. 

An additional microfauna occurs at the top of the Joli Pou shale 
which does not occur in the top of the Harmon shale. Another fauna 
occurs in the base of the Shaftesbury formation but does not occur in 
the base of the Labiche. The writer feels that although the Cadotte 
sandstone is homotaxial with the Pelican sandstone the former is probably 
slightly older, at legist in part. 

Correlation with the Buckinghorse Formation of the Sikanni Chief River 

Area, British Columbia 

Several fossils were found in the upper portion of the Buckinghorse 
formation which are identical to species occurring in the basal 4o feet

of the Lahiche formation of the Athahaska River area, From this evidence 
the writer has seen fit to correlate the portions of the formations 
mentioned. The following fossils are identical or reasonably so:

Conclusions 

Prom fossil evidence it is possible to correlate the upper portion 
of the Buckinghorse formation with the basal Labiche shale. No fossils 


were recognized from the Buckinghorse formation which would permit corre¬ 


lation of any portion of that formation with the Joli Pou shale. Since 


the uppermost portion of the Buckinghorse only was examined and several 
fossils were found in the Buckinghorse that also occur in the Pelican 
sand it is reasonable to assume that the uncollected portion of the 


Buckinghorse formation includes equivalents of the Pelican and the Joli 
Pou on the basis of its stratigraphic position.

Chapter III 

Formal Description of Microfauna 
Introductory Statement 

Microfossils in the Cretaceous strata of Western Canada, are 
relatively rare, compared to the great numbers of microfossils found 
in Tertiary deposits of Worth America. 

Comparatively little work has been done on Cretaceous microfauna 
in Western Canada, and only a small amount of literature is available 
on the subject. This chapter deals with the formal description of 
some Cretaceous forms, found in outcrop areas of the Athabaska P-iver. 
Some of the forms described in this report have been previously de¬ 
scribed by various authors, (Cushman 1927 , Wickenden 1932, Wauss 19^7) 
none of the species, however, have been figured from the Cretaceous 
deposits exposed along the Athabaska Elver. The species of foraminifera 
figured and described in this paper represent only a portion of the 
species present in the Joli Fou, Pelican and basal Labiche formations, 
being confined to those species which have the greatest stratigraphic 
significance. All descriptions are in alphabetical sequence for con¬ 
venient reference.

Remarks: This species has extremely coarse angular grains; it is 
distinguished from the holotype of Ammobaculites fragmentaria Cushman 
by the strong tapering test of the latter. The u form - species” 

A. fragmentarius Cushman would undoubtedly cover the hypotype, but the 
author feels that the extension of the species to forms which are not 
tapering but merely have a coarsely arenaceous make-up, supresses the 
diagnostic worth of a great number of distinctive Ammobaculites species 
that have a valuable stratigraphic connotation. Ammobaculites GB-72-0 
is probably the form R, T. D. Uickenden (1949, p. 19 ) designated 
Ammobaculites B .

feet above the top of the Grand Rapids formation. 

Remarks: Ammobaculites KB-72 -6 has greatest width of test 
formed by the planispiral portion; in preservation the test is slightly 
compressed, giving an elliptical shape in cross section; the hypotype 
is something like A. torosus Loeblich and Tappan, but the latter is 
much finer grained and has greater indentation of the sutures; 
Ammobaculites KB-7 2-6 is probably the form Wickenden (1949, p. 19 ) 
designated Ammobaculites C .

above the top of Grand. Rapids formation. 

Remarks: The hypotype species differs from Ammobaculoides 
plumm erae Loeblich in being much more coarsely arenaceour and in being 
much more involute in the coiled portion and having fewer chambers in 
the coiled portion. This is probably the form Wickenden (1949, p. 20)

Remarks: The h^rpotype of G, Canadensis var. A is slightly dis¬ 
torted as are the para/types; G. canadensis var. A differs from 
G, canadensis Cushman; G. canadensis var. A has a relatively longer 
triserial portion; this small species is about the same size as 
G. bearoawensis Wickenden, but has fewer chambers in the triseria.1

Hypo type locality: Athabaska River, Alberta, S.E. JjSec. 27 , 

T. 82, R. 17 , w. 4 Mer., locality B-74-30, near the top of the Joli 
Fou shale, SO 1 above the top of the Grand Rapids formation. 

Remarks: The hypotype of H, cf. excavata is similar to a hypotype 
of 5, excavata figured by Cushman from the Navarro group (pi. 2 , fig. 15 ). 
It differs from the holotype of 5. excavata by having fewer chambers 
and it lacks the grey color. The term E. excavata has been used to 
cover a wide variety of forms that have stout intercameral walls, and 
relatively weak side walls to the chambers. The high content of cement 
in the wall make-up allows of a flexibility in deformation, this results 
in a state of preservation in which the chambers are outlined in limbate 
fashion surrounding a depression that marks the position of the chamber, 
this results in an anomolous "preservation form-species", and it is 
doubtful whether the "species" has any longer diagnostic significance. 

This is probably the form R. T. D. Wickenden (1949, p. 19) designated 
Eaplophragmoides sp. A .

star shaped umbilicus; sutures well defined depressed, slightly thickened, 
sigmoid when specimen is crushed, only slightly sigmoid when uncrushed, 
reflecting a concavity of the wall that is present above the aperture on 
the terminal face; wall finely arenaceous with a great deal of cement; 
aperture peripheral at the base of the apertural face, fairly large, 
well-defined, with a lip well-defined on crushed specimen, but on uncrushed 
specimens the lip seems to represent the inner portion of the concave dep¬

in having occasional slightly larger grains embedded in the cement, 
especially towards the umbilical margin; the specimen from the outcrops 
lacks the yellow colour of the species when found in well samples.

at this locality. 

Remarks: The proloculum is broken off from the hypotype of 
Hyperammina KB-7^-45 , but there is strong suggestion that the initial 
portion of the second chamber is represented by the hypotype. Probably 
the form R. T. D. Wickenden (19^9* P» 19) referred to in his preliminary

Chapter 4 

Statistical Analysis 
Generic and Specific Count 

The generic analysis of the microfauna discussed in this thesis 
reveals in part the paleo-ecological conditions prevailing during the 
deposition of the Grand Rapids, Joli Fou, Pelican and early Lahiche 
formations and shows the relative composition of the various faunas 
discussed. 

A specific count of the fauna reveals close correlation with 
other areas in which similar assemblages prevail. 

Generic and specific analysis graphs are included in this thesis. 
Paleo-Bcology As Determined From Generic Analysis 

Four dominant genera represented are Haplophragmoides , Ammobaculites , 
Gaudryina. and Miliammina . Environmental conditions continued favorable 
to these, with other genera tolerated to a lesser degree. Brackish 
conditions with shallow waters (under 100*) must have existed through¬ 
out the period from Upper Grand Rapids to Lower Labiche time. 

The uppermost nortion of the Grand Rapids formation is dominantly 
sandstone with several thin shaly interbeds. These shaly beds carry a 
scarce micro-fauna of Miliammina , Trochammina , Haplophragmoides , 
Leptodermella and (Collophane spheres). Miliammina is the more abundant, 
both in numbers and variety. Studies of recent faunas reveal that 
Miliammina are bottom living forms thriving best in near-shore, shallow, 
weakly brackish to moderately brackish waters v/hich are well oxygenated. 
The remaining genera present are bottom living, brackish waiter in¬ 
habitants preferring bottom conditions where black muds are deposited 
with abundant carbonized plant remains, causing reducing conditions of

deposition. However, these genera tolerate a wide range of conditions 
and tolerate well-oxygenated clean waters although not optimum to their 
development. These studies indicate that the concluding Grand Rapids 
formation represents the deposites of an advancing sea, shallow tidal 
like flats developing over an area of low relief. 

The change from Grand Rapids time to Joli Fou time "brought in a 
consequent change in fauna both in numbers and in variety. The dominat¬ 
ing fauna of the Grand Rapids period gave way to fauna, more suited to 
the silty greyish-black, shaly environment. Early Joli Fou time herald¬ 
ed the appearance of new fauna including: Proteonina , Ammobaculites , 
Ammobaculoides , Gaudryina , Glomospira and "spores" as well as a marked 
increase in numbers and variety of Haplophragmoides . Most foraminifera 
display a delicate adjustment to a preferred environment and consequently 
any rapid changes unless directly in their favor usually is marked by a 
sharp decrease in numbers. The greyish-black silty shale of the early 
Joli Fou indicated conditions of turbid waters with accompaning decrease 
in light and possibly even a change in salinity, Hilianmina the domi¬ 
nant genus in Grand Rapids time is very scarce in early Joli Fou time. 

Iaplophragmoides appears to dominate the entire Joli Fou formation 
appearing in ''floods" during the early portion of Joli Fou time and 
decreasing in numbers towards the end of Joli Fou time. Anaerobic 
conditions might exist near the bottom during dominance of the 
H.aplophragmoides as the grey-black, silty shale indicates. These silty 
conditions on the other hand were probably the ideal source beds to 
provide Haplophragmoides with the desired sand grains from which their

shore on flooded beaches, bays or inlets. Ammobaculites and G-audryina , 
however, are never too abundant in the Joli Fou. G-audryina appears in 
a small "flood" in early Joli Fou time and Ammobaculites is present in 
a small "flood" during middle Joli Fou time, the variety of these genera 
is limited, even during their maxima around the beginning and the middle 
of this depositional period. The influx of Hype ramming. , Bathysiphon 
and Verneuilina is also a marked feature during the Ammobaculites 
"flood". Bathysiphon is dominantly a bottom living form found in 
shallow marine water, in areas in which mineral and plant components 
suggest low oxygen content; this Bathysiphon influx is from another out¬ 
crop from the faunas mentioned above. The presence of Bathysiphon 
suggests a still shallower marine facies interfingering into the Joli 
Fou during middle Joli Fou time. The Verneuilina end Hyperammina fauna 
live under much the same conditions as Ammobaculites and G-audryina , 
consequently their presence indicates similar ecology. 

The uppermost Joli Fou becomes very sandy and a consequent change 
in the numbers and varieties of fauna is the result. Sandy conditions 
are often the result of land movements, possibly a, minor rejuvenation 
which may in part, be responsible for a decrease in depth of water, a 
cleaning of water and a decrease in salinity, resulting in a change of 
fauna or a reduction of fauna. Haplophragmoides , Verneuilina , Hiliammina , 
G-audryina , Leptodermella , "Collophane spheres" and "spores" are present 
in limited numbers and varieties in the sandy upper portion of the Joli 
Fou. 

The Pelican sandstone marks a complete sandy facies of the Joli Fou 
formation; "spores" and Miliammina are the dominant fossils with 


Ammobaculites and Verneuilina appearing in numbers in the uppermost

Pelican sand; Haplophragmoides is absent in the uppermost Joli Fou, 
Pelican and basal Labiche. The presence of Miliammina , Verneuilina , 

Ammobaculites and "spores" marks another change from brackish to 
moderately brackish conditions; the turbid water of the Joli Fou has 
given way to clean well oxygenated waters of the Pelican sea, undoubtedly 
the indirect result of rejuvenation. 

A close examination of the Miliammina and the "spore" graphs indi¬ 
cates that a "flood" of "spores" is usually followed by a "flood" of 
Miliammina . Many species of foraminifera. live on algae and other 
vegetable matter. Because of the relationship shown by these two graphs 
it is reasonable to assume that, whenever there was a "flood" of "spores" 
there was abundant food upon which Miliammina thrived. The plants sur¬ 
rounding the margins of the ocean are probably responsible for the 
"spores", so a greater concentration of "spores" near shore is expected. 

The change from a sandy facies represented by the basal Labiche 
formation did not have severe reflection on the general abundance of the 
dominating genera; on the contrary, most genera began increasing in 
numbers as well as varieties, except for Haplophragmoides . Sandy lenses 
occur in the lowermost Labiche indicating that complete anaerobic con¬ 
ditions did not exist. The dominant genera found in the Labiche is 
Ammo baculit e s . The tests of these Ammobaculites are peculiar in that 
the individual grains from which the test is composed are exceedingly 
large. The sandy lenses within the basal Labiche provide the proper 
sand texture from which Ammobaculites obtained their sand grains. 
Miliammina the dominant genera, of the Pelican again is well represented 
in the Labiche, Verneuilina , Gaudryina and Trochammina are also well 
represented. The genus Beophax also makes an appearance. The presence 


of Ammobaculites , Verneuilina, Miliammina, Gauflryina and Reophax indicate

that slight to moderate brackish conditions prevailed; although the 
Labiche is dominantly a dark grey to black shale, many sandy lenses 
are present; the overall picture indicates a slow subsidence, ac¬ 
companying the subsidence was a turbid sea; the subsidence is spasmodic 
with short quiescent periods. During the subsidence the sea floor and 
possibly the surrounding land mass began to sink resulting in the shore 
line retreating. Near the shore the water was always shallow and since 
fresh water streams poured in from the surrounding land mass, brackish 
conditions prevailed near shore; during the quiescent periods the 
sandy lenses were deposited in clean brackish waters and it was in these 
waters that the Ammobaculites , Yerneuilina , Hiliammina and Reophax 
fauna lived. Trochammina a versatile fauna tolerated to some extent 
the sandy conditions, but this fauna probably represents the muddy 
phase of this period; it is never too abundant in the basal Labiche. 

Prom the proceeding discussion it can readily be concluded that 
the period from late Grand Rapids time to early Labiche time was an era 
of slow subsidence with shallow inundation by brackish waters. During 
late Grand Rapids time the environment was probably fresh with coal 
seams developing locally. Miliammina is the dominant foraminiferal 
fauna representing weak to brackish interfingering advances of the sea; 
this evidence indicates that Grand Rapids deposits are not entirely 
continental as once thought, but partly brackish. 

The remaining formations namely: Joli Pou, Pelican and basal 
Lahiche indicate varying degrees of brackish environment. The Joli 
Pou shows that moderate anaerobic conditions prevailed in early Joli 
Pou time changing to a slightly more oxygenated environment in middle 
and late Joli Pou time. Haplopragmoides is the dominating genus of 
the Joli Pou period.

Pelican time was an era of extremely well oxygenated conditions in 
which Miliammina and "spores" are the dominating microfossils. 
Ammobaculites becomes very prominent in late Pelican time. 

Basal Labiche time was marked by faint indications of subsidence 
and quiescent periods, in which the waters were turbid and moderately 
clear respectively. The dominant fauna, recorded for this -period indi¬ 
cates that well oxygenated moderately brackish conditions prevailed 
with short periods of anaerobic conditions. Ammobaculites is the 
dominant fauna of this period with Oaudryina and Miliammina fairly 
abundant.

Explanation of the Specific Graphs Following 

A statistical analysis has been made of all species of foraminifera 
found in the samples examined, appearing in the appendix portion of this 
thesis. This specific analysis has been illustrated by means of graphs. 
The vertical axes of these graphs represent the range and distribution 
of the various species. The datum is taken as the top of the Grand 
Rapids formation and is designated as 0*. Strata above this datum line 
include the Joli Fou, Pelican and Labiche formations. Strata below 
this line belongs to the Grand Rapids formation. 

Each species or morphological entity (i.e. unnamed varieties, etc) 
occupies one column, within which, various "line symbols” indicate 
population numbers thus, a broken line indicates a population of from 
0 - 10; a solid line from 11 - 100, a solid and a broken line 101 - 200, 
two solid lines 201 - 300 , a bar 301 - 400, a bar and a solid line 401 - 
500 , a bar and a triangle 501 - 1000.

Explanation of Generic Graphs Following 

The generic graphs which follow have been constructed from a 
statistical analysis of genera found in all samples examined. The 
vertical axes of these graphs represent the range and distribution 
of the various genera; as was the case in the specific graphs, the 
datum is taken as the top of the Grand Rapids formation and is 
designated as 0*. All strata above the datum line includes the Joli 
Fou, Pelican and Labiche formation, all strata below the line belongs 
to the Grand Eapids formation. 

The horizontal axis is self explanitory; the numbers along the 
horizontal axis indicate the total number of specimens of each genus

A detailed, description of all formations encountered has been in¬ 
cluded as a means of explaining why some samples are barren of micro- 
fossils. 

The discussion of the formations,which follows, is arranged in 
descending order from the youngest to the oldest to correspond with 
sections encountered in drilling. 

The basal 60 feet only of the Labiche formation was examined for 
microfossils. This portion of the formation consists of dark grey, 
crumbly to blocky, marine shale with occasional bands of rusty iron¬ 
stone. At the Pelican formation contact, the Labiche shale was des¬ 
cribed from an outcrop in S.E. -^-Sec. 30» T.79* R.17« W. ^ Her. 

No unconformity was found between the Labiche formation and 
underlying Pelican sand. The Pelican formation consists for the most 
part of yellowish to whitish-grey, medium to coarse-grained sand of 
marine origin, with irregular interbeds of grey sandy shale. These

sandy shale "beds were sampled for microfossils. The section described 
occurs at N.W. -q^-Sec. 3 1 * T.79» R.17* W. 4 Her. 

Below the Pelican sand lies the Joli Fou formation, a series of 
dark grey to black marine shales. Near the top, the shale is very sandy 
and silty, and finally gives way to the overlying Pelican sand. Very 
poor recovery of fossils was obtained from this sandy shale portion. 
Lower in the section less sand is encountered, but towards the base, 
minor lenticles of silt appear as breaks in the shale. 

The detailed description of the Joli Fou shale appearing below was 
pieced together from a number of small sections outcroping along the 
Athabaska Biver from S.E. -j^-Sec. l6, T.S1, R.17, W. 4 Mer. to N.W. -q^Sec. 
31, T.S5* R.17» W. 4 Mer. Regional dip of strata along with various 
marker horizons were used to compile this 110 foot composite section of 
Joli Fou shale. 

Underlying the Joli Fou is the Grand Rapids formation. The top 
4o feet of the Grand Rapids formation was described from an outcrop 
appearing in N.E. -q?-3ec. 27 * T.S2, R.17* W. 4 Mer. No unconformity at 
at the top was recognized here. Below Grand Rapids on the Athabaska 
River in S.W. -q-Sec. 34, T.g4, R.17, W. 4 Mer. a 4 foot thick coal bed 
appears at the Joli Fou-Grand Rapids contact and below the coal is a 
2 n to 4” bed of greyish black chert pebble conglomerate, cemented in a 
dark brown to greyish black sandy matrix. 

The described section of the Grand Rapids formation is probably 
of marine or brackish origin, A few marine (brackish) microfossils 
were obtained from the upper 30 feet of the formation. For the most 
part the strata encountered consisted of irregular interbeds of sand, 
silt and shale. Occasional black chert pebbles occur in the sandy beds.
