STUDIES ON THE INHERITANCE OF SMUT REACTION, 
LEMMA COLOR, AWN DEVELOPMENT AND' 
RACHILLA PUBESCENCE IN OATS. 


L.P.V. Johnson. 


INTRODUCTION 


The control of oat smuts is of great economic 
importance because of the wide distribution and destructive¬ 
ness of these diseases* Canadian farmers suffer a yearly- 
loss of nearly seven million dollars from oat smut (14}. 

In Alberta, covered smut, caused by Ustilago levis (K*and S.) 

Magn*, is very common while loose smut caused by Ustilago 
P 

avenae (}^ers*) Jens* is relatively rare (4,5). In 1930, 
covered smut damage in Alberta fields ranged from zero to 
thirty-five per cent; absence of the disease was apparent^ 
ly due to proper seed treatoent (5). In 1931 nearly one- 
half of the fields^were infected by covered smut (4), 

Chemical and other seed treatments are usually 
quite efficient in controlling oat smuts; but, as such 
methods are troublesome and add to the cost of production, 
it would appear that a more desirable means of preventing 
smut infection would be the breeding and use of smut resist¬ 
ant oat varieties* The present investigation is mainly a

study of the reaction to covered smut of progeny of crosses 
between the standard commercial varieties, Victory and 
Banner, and a smut resistant variety of inferior quality, 
Black Mesdag, the object being to obtain constant strains 
possessing the desirable characters of both parents, and 
to record genetic data on the reaction to the disease. 
Genetic data were also compiled on lemma color, awn develop¬ 
ment, and rachilla pubescence for the purpose, in each case, 
of studying the mode of inheritance of the character and of 
testing its relation to smut reaction and to the other 
characters studied.

Victory and Banner differ slightly for the char¬ 
acter of awn development, Banner having a somewhat stronger 
expression; but for the characters of smut reaction, lemma 
color, rachilla pubescence and callus pubescence the two 
varieties are practically identical. Comparing Black Mesdag 
with Victory and Banner shows that in lemma color and smut 
reaction the parents are entirely different, the former is 
black and i m m u ne, the latter are white and susceptible. 

Black Mesdag has a far stronger development of awns, it has 
fairly heavy rachilla pubescence which contrasts the glabrous 
condition of the other parents* All three varieties are 
practically the same with respect to callus pubescence. 

Inoculum and methods of inoculation. 




Only the.covered smut of oats, caused by Ustilago 

levis (K. and S. ) Magn., was in the present test* In 

1950 a composite was made up of smutted panicles collected 

from many different varieties in many parts of the province. 

Inoculum was prepared by grinding the infected panicles of 

this collection. In 1931 several field smut tests were 

carried on which included seme 260 varieties and about 450 

hybrid lines including 165 F lines of the present material. 

o 

Smutted panicles were co3JLeoted from over 200 varieties ^d 
from nearly 300 hybrid lines* The composite^3®^^ from this 
collection served as inoculum for the retesting, in 1932, 
of the F lines of the present study.

Reed (23,25,27) and Reed and Stanton (30) have 
reported evidence indicating the existence of several 
physiologic races of both oat smut^;^4t is believed that 
the inoculiim used in the present investigation includes 
the majority, if not all, of the physiologic forms ofj cover- 
ed smut^ existent in the province. 

As the 1931 smut test of lines, in which hulled 
seeds (hulls not removed from caryopses) were used, resulted 
in only fair smut infection, it was decided to repeat the 
test in 1932 using dehulled seeds (hulls removed from 
caryopses). Fifty seeds, or as many as available up to 
that number, of each F^ plant were dehulled and placed in 
an envelope. The inoculum was prepared by grinding the 
smutted panicles and removing the chaffy material by sift¬ 
ing. A liberal quantity of inoculxm was added to each 
envelope which was then shaken vigorously* The smut infec¬ 
tion in 1932 was very severe* Previous investigators, 
particularly Johnston (17) and Stanton et.al. (32), have 
fo\ind dehulling of the seed to greatly increase smut 
infection. 

General methods of growing and handling 
the material. 


In all, three complete sowings were made from F 

2 

seeds: in 1931 duplicate sowings were made, one being a 
genetic nursery used as a source of material for morphologic¬ 
al studies, the other being a smut test; in 1932 the smut •

test was repeated. In ^11 sowings, plots of both parents 
were grown between every £0 hybrid plots. All plots were 
single rows, ten feet in length, with 50 seeds (or as many 
as available) per row. 

Notes on smut infection were taken in the field 
when plants neared maturity, infection then being complete. 
Counts of total number of plants and of nxmiber of plants 
infected were made in each hybrid and parental row, (Plants 
were spaced approximately two and one~half inches apart to 
facilitate counting,) From data thus collected the per«^ 
centage of smut infection was later calculated for each 
row. 

Field notes were also taken on early growth habit, 
date of heading, date of maturity and on leaf area infected 
with halo blight disease, A study of these data is not 
included in the present paper. 

The plants in the genetic nursery plots were 
harvested by pulling up each plant by the roots, and making 
a sheaf from each line. The data on awn development were 
compiled for each plant prior to threshing. Data on all 
other morphological characters were compiled from threshed 
seed. It should be stated that in threshing the outer 
glumes of many spikelets were not removed. Seeds thus 
protected were utilized to advantage in classifying for 
pubescence, as completely threshed grains often lost many 
hairs in the process.

Environmental considerations 


Bartholomew and Jones (2) found that the tempera¬ 
ture optima for growth, spore germination, and sporidial 
poroduction in Ustilago avenae were 68^, 59°, and 59° F* 
respectively. In soil of 36 percent moisture, 100 percent 
infection was obtained at temperatures between 59° and 73°F. 
Reed and Faris (28) obtained highest infections by U. levis 
at 77° F. with severe infections at 59^ and 68^ F. Johnston 
(17) found soil temperatures of 62° to 66^ F. to be the 
most favorable for infection by a mixture of U. avenae and 
IJ. levis « 

In the spring of 1932 observations were made on 
soil temperatures by means of a thermograph. Seeding was 
done on May 6th when soil temperatures ranged from 52° to 
65° F. with the average at 59° F. Temperatures for the 
three days preceding had been practically the same, and 
there was little change in average soil temperatures up 
to the time of emergence of the seedlings. It is believed 
that the temperature conditions of the present experiment 
were near to optimum for smut infection.

INHERITANCE OF SMUT REACTION, 


Historical review. 


Literature on the inheritance of smut reaction in 
oats is comparatively recent. It dates from 1920 when 
Wakahayashi (34) published data on the behavior of the 
progeny of a cross, Red Rustproof x Black Tartarian, to 
Ustilago levis . Red Rustproof is resistant, Black Tartarian 
susceptible. In the F^, twelve families out of a total of 
107 showed a few smutted plants. He concluded that immun^ 
ity was dominant and perhaps due to three independent 
factors. 

Barney (1) reported on the reaction of the progeny 
of three crosses to U. avenae . One cross, Fulghum x Black 
Mesdag, involved two highly resistant varieties; a second 
cross, Swedish Select x Burt involved a highly susceptible 
and a resistant variety, respectively; a third cross, 

Turkish Rustproof x Gold Rain involved a highly suscept¬ 
ible and a moderately susceptible variety, respectively. 
Barney concluded that in the first cross resistance 
depended upon th3?ee independent factors, in the second 
upon two, and in the third upon one. 

Reed and Stanton (29) published on the reaction 
of selections from a cross, Fulghum x Swedish Select, to 
both U. avenae and U. levis. Fulghum is highly resistant 


to both smuts, while Swedish Select is susceptible to

both smuts. Evidence was presented which indicated that 
resistance to both forms was dependent upon the same genetic 
factors. The reaction of 93 Eg families was studied; 25 
were as resistant as the Fulghum parent, eight were more 
susceptible than the Swedish Select parent, the remaining 
59 showed moderate to high susceptibility. The F^ selec¬ 
tions from susceptible F^ families all showed high suscept¬ 
ibility. With two exceptions, F^ selections from resist¬ 
ant Fg families proved very resistant. No correlation 
between smut reaction and morphological characters was 
observed. They concluded, therefore, that it is possible 
to obtain the desired combination of smut resistance and 
other varietal characters in oats. 

Reed (24) studied the inheritance of loose smut 
reaction in a cross Avena nuda var. inermis (susceptible) 

^ A* var. Black Mesdag (resistant). Results indicat¬ 

ed that resistance to U. avenae is dominant while suscept¬ 
ibility is recessive, and that there is a single factor 
difference between the parents. No correlation between 
smut reaction and morphological characters was observed. 

Gains (10) published data on the reaction of 
oat varieties and hybrids to covered smut. The resistant 
variety, Red Rustproof, was crossed with four susceptible 
varieties. Crosses with Black Tartarian and with Abundance 
indicated that Red Rustproof carries three dominant factors 
for immunity, any one of which prevents infection by 
XT. levis. In crosses with Lar@s Hulless and with Chinese

Hulless, Red Rustproof was again shown to carry three factors 
for resistance, but one of the factors did not possess complete 
dominance in hulless segregates, otherv/ise the prepotency 
of the factors were the same in all four crosses. 

Hayes, Griffee, Stevenson and Lunden (16) studied 
the inheritance of reaction to both smut fungi using as 
cultures 378 selected lines from the cross (White Russian 
X Minota)x Black Mesdag. They concluded that immunity is 
dominant to susceptibility and that there is no correlation 
between glume color, awn development, number of hairs on 
rachilla, rust reaction and smut reaction. They found it 
impossible to state the exact genetic constitution with 
respect to smut reaction, but state that their results could 
be explained by assuming two pairs of genetic factors, II and 
RR, for iimiinity and resistance, respectively, located in 
Black Mesdag. I might be considered to be epistatic to H. 
Several homozygous lines were obtained which were immune to 
smut, resistant to rust, and which possessed white glumes 
and Y^eak awns, 

Reed (E6) studied crosses between varieties sus¬ 
ceptible to both smuts and varieties resistant to both smuts; 
between varieties susceptible to both smuts; between varieties 
resistant to covered smut but susceptible to loose smut and 
varieties susceptible to both smuts; between a variety sus¬ 
ceptible to both smuts and a variety susceptible to covered 
smut but resistant to loose smut. He states that ^^In all the

was dominant and susceptibility recessive, and segregation 

in the F appeared to occur on the basis of a single factor 
2 

difference". In crosses between susceptible varieties, 
the Fg descendants were in every case as susceptible as 
the parent varieties. 

Garber, Giddings and Hoover (12) reported studies 
of the Fg and F4 of a cross, Gopher x Black Mesdag, and the 
reciprocal. Gopher is moderately susceptible, while Black 
Mesdag is immune to both smuts. They concluded that smut 
reaction was controlled by a single main factor and at 
least one supplementary factor, which caused transgressive 
segregation. There was some evidence of correlation 
between the supplementary factor and the factor for black 
lemma color. No correlation existed between smut reaction 
and the characters, leaf width and earliness. 

In a later paper (13) the same authors published 
further studies on transgressive segregation for suscept¬ 
ibility in the same material. Itiey asstime that Black 
Mesdag is homozygous for a dominant factor R which gives 
high resistance, possibly immunity, and that Gopher is 
homozygous for a factor I which is an additional factor for 
resistance but less potent than R. Black Mesdag carries 
the recessive factor for susceptibility i, and Gopher 
the recessive factor for susceptibility r. I may act 
as an inhibitor to r. Thus Black Mesdag may be geno¬ 
typically represented as RRii, and Gopher as rrll. The 
genotypes rrli and rrii segregating from the cross have

potentialities for greater susceptibility than Gopher, 
and their theoretical frequencies correspond to observed 
frequencies of families showing transgressive segregation 
for susceptibility* 

Welsh (35) published results of a study on the 
reaction of Progeny of the cross Victory x (Minota- 
White Russian x Black Mesdag) to both smuts* The former 
is resistant and the latter susceptible to both smuts. The 
same Fg lines were tested with each form of smut separate¬ 
ly. Transgressive segregation occurred* By classing all 
lines not more susceptible than the Victory parent as 
resistant, R, and all other lines as susceptible, S, he 
found that the deviations from the ratio R:S *= 15:1 were, 
for the loose smut test, 3*15 jh 2*83, for the covered 
smut test, 10*81 ^ £*83. He concluded that at least two 
factors govern smut reaction, and that resistance is 
dominant. A correlation coefficient of 0*683 hh 0*021 
was obtained between loose smut and covered smut infection. 
Smut infected plants tended to be more susceptible to 
infection by stem rust than non-smutted plants. 

Cofftian, Stanton, Bayles, Wiebe, Smith and Tapke 
(3) studied the inheritance of resistance to U* levis in 
crosses between the resistant Markton and six suscept¬ 
ible varieties, namely. Early Champion, Ligowa, Scottish 
Chief, Swedish Select, logren and Aurora. In the crosses 
Markton x Early Champion, Markton x Ligowa and Markton x 
Swedish Select, approximately three-fourths of the progeny 
from the F^ were infected and one-fourth were smut free,

indicating a single factor difference for resistance. In 

the crosses Markton x Scottish Chief, logren x Markton 

and Aurora x Markton, almost equal numbers of smut-free 

and of infected progeny lines from the F plants were 

2 

observed. Gradations of infection percentages were so 
complete that genetic classes seemed impracticable. Trans¬ 
gressive segregation for smut infection was observed. 

Little or no correlation was found to exist between smut 
reaction and the following characters: panicle length, 
kernel length, kernel width, presence of awns, prominence 
of nerves in lemmas, and lemma color. 


Experimental results. 


As has already been stated, the F„ was tested 

o 

for reaction to covered smut in both 1931 and 1932. In 
the present analyses only the 1932 test will be considered 
as far greater infections were obtained in that year. The 
correlation coefficient for smut infection in 1931 and 
smut infection in 1932 was +0.823 0.021 in the Black 

Mesdag x Victory cross and +0«601 0.739 in the Black 

Mesdag x Banner cross. 

The necessity for three sowings from Pg seeds 
considerably reduced the number of plants in some Fg 
families in the 1932 smut test. Only families with suf¬ 
ficient population to give a reliable indication of 









15 - 


inherent reaction are included in the following analyses• 

The standard set for the zero-infection class was as follows 
no infection in 1931 (based on 40-50 plants), no infection 
in 1932 row of 20 or more plants. The standard for the 
intermediate infection class was a test of 20 or more 
plants. The minimum standard for inclusion of a family 
in the susceptible class is represented by a family which 
showed a comparatively very high infection in 1931, and 
13 out of 17 plants infected in 1932. In a great majority 
of the cases the population of 1932 Fg families ranged 
from 35 to 50 plants. 

The classification of Fg plants for smut reaction 
on the basis of percentage smut infection of Fg families, 
together with parental reactions, is presented in Table II.

The results of the studies, particularly in the 
case of the Black Mesdag x Yictory cross, could be explained, 
tentatively, by assuming the following factorial interactions: 
Black Mesdag, RRPP 
Banner or Victory, rrpp 

R is a dominant factor for smut resistance which 
in a homozygous condition gives immunity. P is a supplem¬ 
entary factor for resistance which is less potent than R, 
and in a homozygous condition gives only partial resistance. 
The recessive allelomorphs r and p condition smut suscept¬ 
ibility. 

Thus, the factorial interaction, with respect to 
smut reaction, in the present crosses may be represented as 
follows:

Garber et. al,, (12,13) in order to explain trans¬ 
gressive segregation for susceptibility in a Gopher x Black 
Mesdag cross, gave the following genotypes to the parents: 
Black Mesdag, RRii 
Gopher, rrll 

(see historical review) 

Except for a narrower range of infection (0 to 

67*5 percent) their data on smut reaction of families 

3 

agree with the data of the present experiment. Factorial 
analyses of both investigations will agree if the follow¬ 
ing parental genotypes be assumed: 

Black Mesdag, RRPPii 

Victory and Banner, rrppii 
Gopher, rrPPII 

The two-factor ratio assumed in each analysis 

a 

will still hold good. addition of factors PP to the 

genotype of Gopher accounts for the smaller degree of 
infection obtained in the cross involving that variety. 

As dehulled seeds were used in the present investiga¬ 
tion, the fact that Garber et.al. used hulled seed must 
be considered when comparing, directly, the infection ranges 
of the respective cultures. Garber et.al. reported an 
average smut infection of 19.5 percent for the eleven 
Gopher parental plots grown with the Fg families. Under 
the conditions of the present investigation, the average 
infections obtained for four plots of Gopher were,when

hulled seed was used 1#6, and when dehulled seed was used 
23.5 percent. It would appear, therefore, that conditions 
under which G-arher et.al. grew their material were such 
that their infections from hulled seeds are closely compar 
able to infections obtained from dehulled seeds under the 
condition of the present investigation. The direct compari 
son of infection ranges made above is therefore, to a 
considerable extent, justifiable. 

It should also be mentioned that Garber et.al. 
used as inoculum a mixture of the two oat smuts, while in 
the present study only covered smut was used. 

The was not grown, except for the growing 
and testing for smut reaction of certain selections of 
agronomically desirable types from highly resistant or 
immune Fg families. As the object of growing these lines 
was a purely economic one, no genetic analysis has been 
made. It might be stated, however, that all families 
showing immunity to smut in the F^ were also immune in 
the F^, a behavior to be expected on the basis of the 
hypothesis.

INHERITANCE OF LEMMA COLOR 


Historical review 


A study of tile literature dealing with the inherit¬ 
ance of lemma color in oats reveals an apparent difference 
in the genetical constitution of certain black-grained 
varieties (see Appendix). The recent work of Robb (SI) 
brings out this point with particular clearness. 

Reports on the inheritance of lemma color in 
crosses in which Black Mesdag was the black parent do not 
agree as to the number of factors involved. Garber and 
Quisenberry (11) found lemma color to be controlled by 
one factor in a cross between Black Mesdag and Gopher 
(white). Lunden ( 20 ) and Hayes, Griffee and Lunden ( 16 ) 
obtained similar results in crosses between Black Mesdag 
and homozygous strains from Minota x White Russian and 
White Russian x Victory crosses. Robb ( 31 ) observed a 
two-factor interaction, in the cross Breseler»s Prolific 
(white) X Black Mesdag. This difference in results may 
be explained in a number of ways: the white-grained 
parents may have carried, in the cases where only one 
factor was indicated, a factor inhibiting the expression 
of the factor for grey lemma color present in Black 
Mesdag; the parent designated as Black Mesdag may not 
have been the same; the envi3ranmental conditions, under 
which the experiments woro conduc ted- that indicated one

factor for lemma colo:^, may have been such that the factor 
for grey lemma color was not expressed. 


Experimental results. 


The lemma color of the grains of both crosses 
was similar to that of Black Mesdag. In the F segrega*- 
tion occurred in both crosses for black, grey and white 
in approximately the ratio of 12:3:1. The F^ data, to- 
gather with tests of goodness of fit to the 12:3:1 ratio 
are given in Tables III and IV.

The fit of the observed to the calculated data is 
good in the case of Black Mesdag x Victory and excellent in 
the case of Black Mesdag x Banner. It may be concluded 
from the P values obtained that the genetic ratio assumed 
is the correct one. 

The Fg data gives good substantiation of the Fg 
hypothesis. However, since difficulty was encountered in 
distinguishing between white and grey colors, it was 
impossible to classify the different types of segregation 
in many instances. In Tables T and VI certain groupings 
are made in an attempt to overcome this difficulty.

INHERITMCE OF AW DEVELOPrffilT 


Historical review 


The inheritance of awn development has been studi¬ 
ed in a number of investigsitions, mainly in connection with 
interspecific crosses (See Appendix)• The inheritance of 
the weak awn was studied by Love and Fraser (19) in the 
crosses Avena sterilis var. Burt x A* sativa var. Sixty 
Day and Red Texas x Burt. A single factor for awns was 
indicated. Fraser (8) later made a more intensive study 
of the genetics of the weak awn in crosses between Burt 
and Sixty Day. The expression of the weak awn was found 
to be controlled by a single factor. Surface (23), Love 
and Fraser (19), Fedorova (6) and others have found the 
strong awn to be strongly linked with the factor for wild 
type articulation in crosses between A. fatua and A. sativa . 
Segregation for awns occurred in the ratio of 1 sativa 
type : 2 intermediate types ; 1 fatua type. 

The mode of inheritance of the strong awn in 
crosses between varieties of A. sativa has not been establish¬ 
ed. Lunden (20) studied the inheritance of the strong awn 
in crosses between Black Mesdag and three purified hybrid 
lines from crosses between Victory or Minota and White 
Russian. No classification seemed possible because of 
nearly complete gradations between parental extremes.

The data, however, indicated the presence of on® main 
factor for geniculate awns, with other factors probably 
concerned. Quisenberry (22) found, in a cross between A. 
sativa var. Victor (strong-awned) and A. sativa orientalis 
var. Sparrowbill (weak^awned, nearly awnless), that inherit¬ 
ance of awns W8ts controlled by more than one genetic factor. 
Hayes, Oriffee, Stevenson and Lunden (16) state, in regard 
to the inheritance of awns in a cross, (Minota x White 
Russian) x Black Mesdag, that "Without doubt several genetic 
factors are involved"* They also state that awn development 
is probably greatly influenced by environmental conditions. 


Ixperimental results. 


When the study of the inheritance of awn develop¬ 
ment was commenced, it was assumed that the character was 
dependent upon several genetic factors, and that it was 
greatly influenced by environmental conditions; accordingly, 
great care was exercised in classifying and F_ material. 
Every plant in both generations was described, with respect 
to awn development, as follows; 

(a) range of awn development (9 classes were used) 

(b) modal awn class 

(c) percentage of awned spikelets (10 classes 
estimated by inspection). 












27 


Genetic analyses were attempted, first, on the 
basis of the strongest awn expression (i.e*, the upper 
extreme of the range), and second, on the basis of indices 
of number of awns (based on percentage of awned spikelets 
per plant)* The former basis proved to be the most satis¬ 
factory, and it is believed that the data compiled by that 
method justifies the stating of a scheme of inheritance for 
awn development (See Plate II)- 

The Fg data, corrected on the basis of Fg behavior, 
are given in Tables VII and VIII*

In both crosses the fit indicated is excellent. 

The F results may be explained by assuming the

S is a dominant factor for strong, geniculate awns, 
T is a factor for twisted, non-geniculate awns. The double 
recessive will condition a few weak or no awns.

The existence of awnless and nearly awnless hybrids 

indicates the possibility of a third genetic factor which 

operates in the absence of S and T, thus changing the ratio 

from 12:3:1 to 48:12:3:1. Of course, these types may be 

only variations due to the environment* 

The data does not give a conclusive substantiation 
o 

of the Fg hypothesis. It is believed that the influence of 

environmental factors accounts for the lack of close 

correspondence between the two generations. Tables IX and X

expected where external factors exert strong influence on

the environment, would therefore, appear to be segregating.

INHERITANCE OF RACHILLA PUBESCENCE. 
Historical review 


The inheritance of rachilla pubescence has not been 
extensively investigated (See Appendix). In crosses between 
Avena fatua and A. sativa . Surface (33) and Fedorova (6) 
found rachilla pubescence to be linked with the factor for 
fatua type articulation, segregation for pubescence occurring 
in the ratio of 1 sativa type : 2 intermediate types : 1 fatua 
type. Lunden (20) reported that pubescence of the rachilla 
is controlled by a single factor. The F^ generation was 
intermediate. Hayes, ariffee, Stevenson and Lunden (16) 
in a studj?" of the crosses, (White Russian x Victory) x Black 
Mesdag and (v¥hite Russian x Minota)X Black Mesdag, observed 
segregation in the ratio of 3 (few hairs) : 1 (many hairs). 
Odland (21), working f/ith a cross between Early Gothland 
(A. sativa ) and Carton 784 (A. sativa orientalis ), found 
segregation for rachilla pubescence in the ratio of 3 smooth : 
1 hairy. 


Experimental results. 


TWO methods of studying the inheritance of rachilla 
pubescence were used throughout the present investigation: 
first, length of hairs and, second, number of hairs was used 
as the unit of inheritance. A strong, positive correlation 
exists between these two aspects of rachilla pubescence.

(See Table XVI). Both systems of classification were utiliz 
ed in working out an inheritance scheme, though phenotypic 
classes are based, primarily, on length of hairs. 

Originally, the data were classified on the 
basis of presence and absence of hairs. The data fitted the 
ratio 3 pubescent : 1 glabrous very well, \7hen the F^ was 
examined, however, it was found that most of the glabrous 
types produced hairs,indicating the presence of interclasses 
within the original recessive group. The F^ material was 
then re-classified with great care; a magnifying glass was 
used to aid in the detection of the slightest indication of 
pubescence. Classification was based on six classes of 
pubescence as well as the glabrous class. It was found that 
there are, apparently, two phenotypic classes of pubescence, 
long hairs and short hairs; the long hairs were relative:)-y 
abundant while the short hairs occurred in small numbers - 
often the inspection of several grains would disclose only 
a single hair. 

Tables XI and XII summarize the F data as correct 
ed on the basis of F^ behavior.

The Fg results may be explained by postulating the 
following hypothesis: 

Black Mesdag , MTFF. 

Banner or Victory, nnff. 

N is a dominant factor which conditions nuraerous, 
fairly long hairs on the rachilla. F is a supplementary factor, 
hypostatic to N, which gives a few short hairs on the rachilla. 
The double recessive produces a glabrous condition.

The expression of rachllla hairs in the F„ was 

O 

stronger than in the due to environmental influences. It 
was found that the environment affected the length more than 
it did the number of hairs: that is to say, that, while the 
short hair expression of the F might be ”stepped-up” to 
medium length in the .F^, the number of hairs associated v;ith 
short expression remained more or less constant in both 
generations. This fact was utilized in distinguishing F„ 

O 

phenot^Tpes in terms of the Fg expressions. The data thus 
compiled affords an excellent substantiation of the Y hypo- 
thesis.

In the first three cases the heirs were distinctly longer and 
more numerous than in the last three instances, where the 
hairs were very minute. Of the tv/o plants classified as 
glabrous in the Black Mesdag x Banner cross, one bred true 
for hairlessness while the other produced 19 plants showing

STUDIES ON CORRELATED INIIERITANGS. 


Correlations between smut reaction and other characters. 


The detection of linkage relationships between 
disease reaction and morphological characters is of economic 
significance because it gives an indication of the possibilities 
of combining desirable expressions of the latter with disease 
resistance by hybridization. When the mode of inheritance 
of the disease reaction in question is difficult to study by 
direct methods, correlations with characters of known inherit¬ 
ance provide the basis of an indirect method of attacking 
the problem. 

Review of the literature on this topic was given in 
connection with the historical review of studies on the 
inheritance of smut reaction. 

The formulae used in the present correlation studies 
are those given hy Hayes and Garber (15, pp. 43-48).

In the studies of correlation between sraut reaction 
and the various grain characters, the population was 102 for 
the Black Mesdag x Victory cross and 23 for the Black Mesdag 
X Banner cross. It is realized that the latter population 
is too small to give very reliable results; this is especially 
true where the correlation ratio was used. 

A summary of the constants calculated are presented 
in Table XY. 

In the Black Mesdag x Victory cross, significant 
correlations were obtained, by the correlation ratio method, 
between percentage smut infection and the following char¬ 
acters: strength of awns ( 1 ^= +0.222 ^ 0.060), nimber of 
awns = --0.312 ^ 0.060), number of rachilla hairs ~ 

-0.323 _+ 0.060). The signs were determined by inspection 
of the correlation surfaces. 

Though these correlation values are quite sig¬ 
nificant in the light of their respective probable errors, 
they are so small that it is questionable if actual signif¬ 
icant correlation exists between the variables tested. The 
scatter of the data on the correlation surfaces does not 
indicate the existence of correlation; the correlation 
coefficients for the same surfaces indicate that there are 
no significant relationships between the variables in ques¬ 
tion (See Table XY) * In order to explain the situation 
it will be necessary to examine the reliability of the 
correlation ratio as a measure of correlation.

The correlation ratio is based on the assumption 
that if no correlation exists in a given surface, the mean 
of each row (or column) yT will be equal to the mean of the 
entire distribution X. Therefore, yT - X = 0. Completing 
the computation,y£ ^y(yX - X)^J/M = 0. This value is the 
numerator of the fraction which equals Therefore, 0, 

An increase in the association between the variables will 
produce a proportional increase in r^by increasing the 
difference yX - X. It will be seen that if the frequency 
of each row is not large enough to give a reliable row mean 
the resulting value of cannot be reliable. In a great 
many correlation surfaces, regardless of the total popula¬ 
tion of the distributions, the rows passing through the 
outer borders of the scatter have not sufficient numbers 
to give a reliable row mean. In the present stud37-, it was 
found that it was these rows which gave most of the size 
to the summation . ?mile it is recognized 

that the extreme variants at the edge of the scatter have 
great influence on the value of the correlation constant 
computed by other methods, the fact remains that the 
correlation ratio method is not reliable, in miany cases, 
for reasons stated. 

The correlation ratio should be applied to non¬ 
linear distributions in which, irrespective of the total 
population, each row (or column) has a frequency large 
enough to give a reliable mean. The number of rows should 
be few in order that each row may have, if possible, a 


large frequency.

In the Black Mesdag x Banner cross, significant 
correlations were obtained, by the correlation ratio method, 
between percentage smut infection and the following char¬ 
acters: strength of awns ( -.0o455 0,093), number of awns 

(~0<.480 _+ 0.090), length of rachilla hairs (-0.446 0.095), 

niomber of rachilla hairs (-0.783 _+ 0.046), length of callus 
hairs (-0.469 _+ 0.092), number of callus hairs (-0.686 
0.062). 

Owing to the small populations used in these 
computations, it is felt that no definite conclusions 
regarding linkages should be drawn where only the correla¬ 
tion ratio is significant. In the case of two characters, 
the correlation coefficient ?jas also significant, namely, 
number of rachilla hairs (-0.578 0.078) and number of 

callus hairs (-0.347 0.103). In these cases, particularly 

in the foimer, it would seem that a loose association with 
smut might be concluded.

Correlation between various grain characters. 


Studies on the correlation existing between grain 
characters are of economic interest, for they indicate the 
possibilities of combining desirable expressions of the 
characters through hybridization. Such studies also con¬ 
tribute to genetical knowledge by disclosing the presence or 
absence of genetic linkages. 

The formula for the coefficient of contingency used 
in the present study is that given by Hayes and Garber (15, 
pp, 49-50). 

Using the coefficient of contingency method, signif¬ 
icant correlations were obtained between the following char¬ 
acters ;

callus hairs, = +0^499 ^ 0<»117.

There can be no doubt regarding the existence of 
correlation between the expressions of these characters. 
However, the presence of such correlations is not, necessar¬ 
ily definite indication of genetic linkages. It is probable 
that there is segregation for physiological characters in 
the present material, A set of physiological factors which 
promotes strong expression of, say, rachilla hairs, might 
b© expected to produce a like expression of a similar 
character such as callus pubescence, regardless of genetic 
relationships. Environmental factors, such as the soil, 
may vary in such a way as to produce physiological differ¬ 
ences among the plants, which in turn might result in a 
correlation between certain characters in a given plant, 

Y/hen working with closely related characters, 
such as awn development, rachilla pubescence, and callus 
pubescence, in a hybrid population,multiple correlations 
should be calculated before drawing conclusions regarding 
the existence of genetic linkages.

ECONO^lIC SIGEIEICAiTCE. 


The practical objective of the investigation - 
the production of constant hybrid strains possessing the 
desirable agronomic characters of the one parent and the 
smut resistance of the other - has been realized* One 
family from the Black Mesdag x Victory cross was, apparent¬ 
ly, homozygous for white, plump grains, weak awns, strong 
straw, mid-season maturity and smut immunity. Fourty-eight 
F 4 lines from this family were grown and all proved to be 
constant for the characters mentioned. These lines are 
probably equal to Victory in quality and equal to Black

Hesdag in smut resistance* Esch line has been bulked and will 
be increased separately and tested for yield* Several hundred 
plant selections of weak-awned, white-grained segregates were 
made in other smut immune families. As the characters, 
white grain and weak awns, are recessive and the character, 
smut immunity, is homozygous dominant, the selections bred 
true for these characters in the F^. Many promising lines 
have been observed which will be increased for yield tests. 


SUMMARY. 


The Fg and Fg generations from the crosses Black 

Mesdag x Victory and Black Mesdag x Banner were studied for 

smut reaction, lemma color, avm development and rachilla 

pubescence. Black Mesdag has black grains, strong awns, 

pubescent rachillas and is immune ^^^smut infection* Victory 

and Banner have white grains, weak awns, glabrous 

and are susceptible to smut infection* Results of the 

various phases of the investigation are as follows: 

1. Reaction to covered smut was studied in the 

F generations. The lemma and palea were removed from the 
3 

seed prior to inoculation with smut spores. Segregation 
for smut reaction occurred in the ratio, 4 immune : 9 moder¬ 
ately resistant : 3 susceptible* Hybrid susceptibility 
was as high as 95^ and coincided with the susceptibility 
of the non-resistant parent. Immune F^ lines bred true fcr 

immunity in the F^. It is concluded that a two-factor 








48 


difference for smut reaction exists between the parents. 

2 . Segregation in the for lemma color occurred 

in the ratio of 12 black : 2 grey : 1 white. The F data 

3 

gave a close substantiation to this ratio^ 

3o Segregation in the F^ for awn development 

occurred in the ratio of 12 strong , geniculate : 3 twisted, 

non-geniculate : 1 straight, non-twisted. The F data did 

3 

not show a close correspondence to the expected data owing 

to environmental influences. 

4o Segregation in the F for rachilla pubescence 

occurred in the ratio of 12 numerous , long hairs : 3 few, 

short hairs : 1 glabrous. The F data gave a close subs tan- 

3 

tiation to the Fg ratio. Some evidence of an additional 
factor for pubescence was observed. 

5. No significant correlation between smut reaction 
and the various grain characters studied was found in the 
case of the Black Mesdag x Yictory cross. A moderate degree 
of association between smut infection and the glabrous 
condition of the rachilla and of the callus was found in 

the Black Mesdag x Banner cross. 

6 . A moderate degree of association was foujid to 
exist between rachilla pubescence and awn development in 
both crosses. In the Black Mesdag x Banner cross a moderate 
degree of association existed, also, between rachilla 
pubescence and callus pubescence, and between callus pubes¬ 
cence and awn development. As segregation for physiological 
factors might account for these associations, no definite

* The term fatua refers, with respect to awn development, to a condition 
similar to that found in A. fatua . namely, strong geniculate awns on all 
grains of the spihelet. The term sativa refers to a condition of awn 
development similar to that of the variety of A. sativ a used in the ^ 
cross in cLuestion.
