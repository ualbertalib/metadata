INTRODUCTION 

The Problem 

The teaching of Modern Languages should give the 
student a grasp of the language which will he of some 
use to him after he has graduated from the secondary 
school. The Department of Education for the Province 
of Alberta had this objective in mind when in its Hand-* 
bool: it presented as aims for Modern Languages (Drench 
and German) the ability to read and write fluently. 

Very few of the pupils who leave the High School 
after having taken three years of a Modern Language 
possess the competency to make use of it to any con¬ 
siderable extent. Only a small percentage can correctly 
translate a letter into Drench, a smaller percentage is 
able to read the language fluently, and practically none 
can carry on even an elementary conversation. 

One must also take cognisance of the fact that in 
recent years there has been a marked increase in the 
number of pupils showing interest in the Moderns. Ad¬ 
mitting that the work in the grammar and silent reading 
sections has been efficient, it is very probable that 
much more could be accomplished in the field of oral 
expression. 

The purpose of this investigation is to test whether, 
even with the present outlines for the course, marked and

worthy achievement can he made in this neglected phase 
of a Modern language course. Given a proper method and 
a teacher who can lend expert guidance* shouldn’t the 
student in the course of three years not only he able 
to cover the required grammatical content of the course, 
but also he able to read correctly selections and carry 
on with some degree of facility a conversation in the 
foreign language? The author hopes the results of 
this experiment will yield an answer to this question. 

Early in 1935 the Edmonton Separate School Board 
granted the author permission to use two of their 
Grade IX classes with which to carry out the experiment. 
The two Grade IX classes at the St. Joseph’s Boys 1 
High School were secured. 

It was deemed advisable to have some means of 
checking the results of this experiment. For this 
purpose the experimenter was very fortunate in obtaining 
the cooperation oT Miss K. Teskey, French Instructress 
at Victoria High School, Edmonton. Throughout the 
project Miss Teskey gave freely of her time, and her 
long experience, as well as her accurate knowledge of 
the subject, was of immense value.

SUBJECTS USED FOR THE EXPERIMENT A ND T HEIR DIST RIBUTION 

In all, the experimenter Had 74 pupils at His 
disposal. Twenty-nine of these were members of Miss 
Teskey's class at Victoria High. School, The rest were 
registered in French at St. Joseph 1 s High School. They 
were divided into two groups: Grade IXA of 24 pupils 
and Grade IXB of 21 pupils. These two classes con¬ 
sisted solely of boys, whilst Miss Teskey’s was a mixed 
group. 

From now on, throughout this investigation, Grade 
IX& will he known as Group A, Miss Teskey ? s class as 
Group B, and Grade IXB as Group X. 

Groups A and B were taught according to a method 
which it was hoped would enable them to give oral ex¬ 
pression to their grammatical knowledge. Only Groups A 
and B had access to the special devices used in this 
experiment. Group X, on the other hand, was taught in 
the orthodox fashion used generally in the Province 
where the pupil is given only the grammatical principles 
of the course and is given no opportunity to express 
himself orally in the language or to hear it correctly 
spoken. This division v^as adopted because it lent itself 
to a better basis of comparison between the two methods.

All three groups took part in the four major tests 
given during the course of the experiment.

DESCRIPTION OP THE EXPERIMENT 
AND THE SPECIAL DEVICES USED 


As a preliminary to the experiment, an Intelligence 
Test was given to all three groups so as to obtain an 
initial rating of their respective mental abilities. 

Porm A of the Otis Classification Test was administered. 
This test gives the Educational Quotient of a pupil as 
well as the Intelligence Quotient. In his Manual of 
Directions, Arthur S. Otis says that the Educational 
Quotient or E. Q. is a measure of the pupils accelera¬ 
tion or retardation in school achievement. He stages 
that we may call it a measure of educational brightness 
analogous to the I. Q. as a measure of mental brightness. 

The individual scores for each pupil on this test 
may be had by referring to Tables VII, VIII and IX of 
Appendix C. 

Averaging the X.Q. ! s andE.Q. f s for each group, we 
obtain the results shown in Table I.

interesting to note that the pupils of Group X are much 
weaker in 1 . 4 . and E.Q,. than those of the other two groups* 
Group A and Group B on whom the experiment was directed 
are approximately of equal mental rating. 

Throughout the year, reference was often made to 
the pupil’s X.Q. and E.Q. scores by the teacher as a 
guide to the better understanding of the pupil’s achieve¬ 
ment , and it was observed that they gave a very fair 
measure of the pupil’s general ability. 

Late in October an English Grammar Test was given 
to the pupils. The Chalmers Grammar Test was the one 
chosen. This test was comprised mostly of parsing and 
clausal analysis. The purpose in assigning the test was 
to discover the knowledge of English Grammar that the 
pupils possessed. It is evident that to be able to 
understand some of the grammatical principles involved 
in the Brench X course, the student cannot possess too 













- 7 - 


great a mastery of his English grammar. The test las 
deficient to the extent that it contained very little 
testing material on the verb forms and tenses. Few 
pupils are promoted into Grade IX, I believe, with a 
thorough knowledge of the forms and intricacies of the 
English verb, question 29 of the test was left out 
because it was debatable as to what could be the correct 
answer. This left a total of 49 questions. 

The individual scores for each pupil on this test 
may be had by referring to Tables VII, VIII and IX of 
Appendix C. 

Tabulating the scores for the three groups:

These results show that the three groups have 
approximately the same knowledge of the English grammar. 
But the average made by the pupils being below the 
median score of 24.50 for the test, which is a little 
too difficult for Grade IX pupils, nevertheless shows 
that the students are quite weak: in English grammar. 

This weakness was in evidence throughout the year. 















- 8 - 


Groups A and X dad a very poor acquaintance with some 
of the most elementary grammatical facts. Very few of 
the pupils in these two groups recognized that: - 
I write, I am writing, and I do write all belong to the 
present indicative of the verb "to write". As a result 
the pupils always had a tendency to translate these 
forms as: J’ecris, je suis ecrivant, je fais ecrire; 
instead of simply translating them all by the French 
present indicative: J’ecris. Also, only a small number 
in Groups A and X could correctly parse the word "some" 
in the simple sentence: I have some. Most would name 
every other part of speech before they would say it was 
a pronoun. After the grammatical training that the 
students supposedly receive in Grades VII and VIII, it 
is significant that in three months they should forget 
that in this sentence "some" is an indefinite pronoun. 
Many other instances were noticed during the year where 
pupils made elementary mistakes when asked to parse 
simple words or sentences. 

I am convinced that before a student can learn the 
grammatical features of a foreign language, he must know 
at least the elementary rules of his own. This knowledge 
was found to be lacking in Groups A and X. Therefore a 
considerable amount of valuable time had to be spent in 
trying to inculcate these elementary facts once and for 
all into the minds of the pupils.

An epidemic of poliomyelitis in the city and 
surrounding districts forced the closing of the schools 
for the whole of the month of September. This was un¬ 
fortunate because it had been intended to devote a whole 
month to introducing the principles of French pronuncia¬ 
tion to the pupils. This late opening of the schools 
forced the author to change his plans and only a week 
was devoted to the explanation of sounds and phonics. 

The necessity of covering in the shortened school year 
the same departmental requirements for the course was 
responsible for this change in plans. However, through¬ 
out the year, whenever a few minutes could be spared, 
further practice on these sounds and phonics was given 
to the pupils. But when judging the results, allowances 
must be made for the fact that nearly 20 % of the 
available time in which to carry out this investigation 
was lost. 

In her report, Miss Teskey gives an outline of a 
few of the devices she used* 11 1 began by a systematic 
study of the sounds. The pupils were taught combina¬ 
tions of letters resulting in certain sounds. Words 
and phrasings were pronounced for them frequently, and 
they were led to pronounce these phrasings themselves. 
Gradually I taught them most of the phonetic symbols 
used in their grammar - merely for recognition value - 
and before long they had the satisfaction of being able

to pronounce without much assistance most of the easier 
[French words they met. 

In teaching the verbs, the forms were connected 
with nouns and pronouns to form little sentences and 
the pupils were encouraged to build long sentences when¬ 
ever possible. 

Simple questions were frequently put to the elase 
involving simple answers, but there was no effort to have 
pupils memorize fixed answers to questions. The latter 
course, in my opinion, retards the development of the 
power of expression, as it gives the pupil an idea that 
he has greater facility in the language than he actually 
has. This feeling gives a sense of discouragement when 
he discovers that he cannot really say anything that he 
has not memorized. 

When we studied the French portions of the exercises 
in the grammar, I read the sentences to the class, who 
translated them with their books closed. They became 
quite fond of this exercise as their pronunciation became 
more exact, I then gave them oral questions on these 
exercises which they answered orally. 11 

Only a week was devoted completely to introducing 
the elementary principles of French sounds and phonics 
to the pupils. 

The pupils were shown the differences between French 
and English syllabication. They were told that contrary

to the English method, the French always attempted to 
finish their syllables with, a vowel, e.g: am/ ab/ il/ 
it/ y (English); a/ ma/ hi/ 11/ te (French). 

ilext the pupils were told that there is very little 
stress in French and, if any, it falls on the last syllable 
of a two or more syllable word and on the last but one if 
the word ends with a mute s, e H . 

The various French accents: acute (e), as in ete; 
grave ('), as in mere, p&r@; circumflex (*}, as in tete; 

cedilla (g), as in gargon; etc,.. and their uses 

were then discussed with the pupils. 

Explanations on the use of the mute "E tt followed 
and the students were told that it was sounded only on a 
very few occasions; e.g., de, te, se, me, le (all mono- 
syllabic words). 

The meaning of the ^liaison" or linking of a final 
consonant was considered. The pupils were told the 
sound that the various consonants have when they are 
linked to a word beginning with a vowel: s becomes z, 
e.g., ils ont; d and t have the t sound, e.g., dit-on, 
repond-on; and so on for most of the more frequent join¬ 
ings. 

Mimeographed sheets of French phonics and exercises 
on pronunciation were distributed to the pupils. Before 
these were made use of, the pronunciation of the various 
vowel sounds was taught. This was done in the following 


manner: 











- 12 - 


I. The three e’s. 

e - mute, very seldom sounded except in monosyllables 
de, te, etc. 

6 - closed e - similar sounds: er, ai, es, etc., 
e.g., ete, parler, donner, chez, etc. 

e - open e - similar sounds: %, ais, ai, aix, etc., 
e.g. , tete, donnais, aime, paix, etc. 

The lip and moutn position for each of these sounds 

was given and practice on their pronunciation was 

held by combining the vowels with consonants and 

having all the pupils individually or as a group 

recite them, e.g.: 


be. 

ce, 

de, 

fe, 

etc. 

be, 

ce, 

de, 

fe, 

etc. 

be, 

ce, 

d h f 

fb, 

etc. 


II. Two sounds were taught for the letter a. 

High a - such as in part, patte, la, etc. 

Low a - such as in pas, passe, pate, etc. 

The pronunciation of these sounds was shown and they 

were also combined with consonants and practised 

till the students were quite sure of them. 

III. The letter o was also considered as having two sounds 

High o - such as in note, sotte, molle, etc. 

Low o «• such as in sot, gros, trop, etc. 

The pupils received the same practice in these two 

sounds as they had received for the preceding ones. 

IV. The letters i and u were next introduced. They were 
taught together because the sounding of one follows 
directly from the pronunciation of the other. The 




- 13 - 


same procedure as for the above vowels was used. 

V. The two sounds ou and eu, as well as the four 
nasalized sounds an, in, on and un, were inculcated 
in the same manner. 

VI. The only consonant for which the mouth positions 
Y^ere given was the letter R. The pupil was taught 
both the uvular and lingual r and told to use the 
one that he found the easiest to sound. 

VII. The other vowel sounds were only dealt with as they 
occurred in the reading. 

It was only after the student could correctly and 
quite easily pronounce these vowels and vowel sounds 
that he was permitted to use the mimeographed sheets. 

The phonics and pronunciation exercises that these sheets 
contained may be found in Appendix A. The material they 
contained was first of all read by the teacher; the 
pupils then attempted to read them as a group. After 
they had become familiar with the content, individuals 
were required to read a paragraph or more to the class. 
Any mistakes made were corrected by the teacher. The 
students rapidly learnt to recognize sounds and to 
pronounce them quite well. Although this material was 
more or less nonsensical, and although the pupil did 
not know what the sentences meant, it was found to be 
of immense value for practice purposes due to the 
numerous repetitions of both vowel and consonant sounds

that it contained. The pupil bs not allowed to read 
any meaningful material until he had become fairly 
adept at pronouncing the words, phrases, and sentences 
on his mimeographed sheets. 

As the grammatical requirements of the course were 
covered, the pupils were granted every available op¬ 
portunity to speak the language and to hear it spoken. 
Every exercise was read by the pupils when it was taken 
up in class. All the vocabularies were also read by 
the pupils and whenever a difficulty or a mistake in 
pronunciation occurred, the teacher gave the necessary 
assistance to overcome it. Reviews of the vocabularies, 
exercises, and mimeographed sheets were held at every 
available opportunity. It must be admitted that these 
reviews were not as numerous as could have been desired, 
but with the limited time at our disposal this could not 
have been altered. The author hopes, before the end of 
the year - once the departmental requirements of the 
course have been taught - to have more time to devote 
to these reviews. 

At frequent intervals, part of the teaching period 
would be assigned to a conversation between the teacher 
and his pupils. The teacher would ask a question and 
the pupils attempted to answer with a correct French 
sentence. Sometimes the procedure was reversed - 
the teacher would give the answer and the pupil was

expected to produce the question. Often the teacher 
would simply make a statement in French and the pupils 
would translate. The latter method was the easiest for 
the pupils to perform and gave the most satisfactory 
results. On the other hand, worth while interest and 
worthy efforts were put forth by the pupils when the 
other devices were used, so that they were far from being 
without merit. Any device which forces the pupil to 
think aiid speak for himself has its good points. 

When the verb forms were being taught, the pupil 
would be asked to write sentences in French for each 
person of the verb tense. These sentences were required 
to be short and simple, so that they were usually fault¬ 
less and could be grasped by the class as a whole. The 
next day the pupil was asked to read hie sentences out 
to the class and the other students attempted success¬ 
fully to translate them. Besides giving practice in the 
writing and speaking of correct sentences, this device 
taught the pupil the tense form so that he could sub¬ 
sequently use it correctly in a sentence instead of 
only knowing it in a parrot-like fashion. 

Another device was the ^o^e^ations’*. For this the 
class was divided into two even groups. The I.Q,. scores 
on the Otis Test were used as a basis for classifica¬ 
tion. The pupils who had the highest marks on this 
test became the captains of the two teams. The two sides 















■ 












- 16 - 


were then lined up in the classroom. For purposes of 
identification, let us call the ’’camps" A and B. The 
teacher -would ask the Captain of team a to give the 
translation of one of the words from the vocabularies 
or perhaps of one of the persons in a verb tense; e.g., 
"market* 1 or M I wrote". If he gave the correct answer 
it would then be the turn of the Captain of team B, 
and so on to the end of the line. If a pupil failed to 
give the correct answer his opponent was offered the 
opportunity and if he succeeded in answering correctly 
the one who hadn*t was declared "dead" and required to 
take his seat. This continued until all the "soldiers" 
on the one side were "dead" and the other side declared 
the "victors". If neither side managed to win in the 
allotted time, the "battle" was considered a "draw". 

The pupils showed great interest in these contests. 
They responded to the idea in splendid fashion and very 
few of the pupils purposely made a mistake so as to be 
able to take their seats. Besides creating interest, 
this device allowed the pupils to learn their vocabu¬ 
laries and verb forms thoroughly and once more gave 
them an opportunity to speak the language. Any mistakes 
in pronunciation were corrected and the class as a whole 
repeated the proper pronunciation of any difficult word. 
The results obtained were very satisfactory.

It must "be remembered that only Groups A and B 
bad access to these special devices. 

At the end of the experiment all three groups were 
tested with a Comprehension and Oral Reading Test in 
French, 

The Comprehension Test was administered orally. 

The teacher read the selection through slowly four times. 
Each time the questions were also given in French. The 
pupils were allowed to take notes as the material was 
read to them. They then proceeded to answer the questions. 
One mark ?^as allowed for each question, but no points 
were given if only part of the answer was correct. The 
highest possible score on the test was 10. The test was 
administered in thirty minutes.

Oral Reading Test s 

For the Oral Heading Test the pupils were taken 
one "by one into an office and required to read a para¬ 
graph or two in French from their grammar or their 
Reader. They were graded according to a scale as it 
would have been rather difficult to grade them on a 
percentage basis. The scale had the following divisions* 
Very good, Good, Very fair, Fair, Poor. As the students 
were all beginners it was taken for granted that no 
student could read correctly to the extent that he would 
deserve an excellent grading. More precise scoring 
would have resulted if the students could all have read 
the same selection. Unfortunately the test had to be 
administered during the period allotted to French and as 
the pupil had to return to the classroom after the test, 
the news would have soon spread if the same selection 
was repeatedly assigned. The last pupils to appear 
would therefore have had a decided advantage by being 

9 

able to review the allotted selection. As a result, 
every pupil had to read a different paragraph. Per¬ 
mission was granted him to read it over silently once 
and then he read it out loud to the examiner. 

The results for each pupil and the group average 
on these tests are tabulated on the following page,

RESULTS 


(l) A comparison of the scores of each group on the 
final tests of the experiment shows clearly that the 
suggested method has a decided advantage over the tech¬ 
nique currently employed in our Alberta High Schools, 
(a) Comprehension Test: 

Group A: Average 5.54 
Group Bi 6.80 

Group X: " 1.25 

Averaging the mean scores of Groups A and B we 
obtain 6.17 for the combined average of the two groups. 
This is nearly six times greater than the average for 
Group X. To further prove that the results were signi¬ 
ficant, a mathematical check was used. According to 
Garrett 1 s "Statistics in Psychology and Education", 
p. 135, the following formula must hold true if the 
results are to be conclusive:

The results then were 6.46 when comparing Groups A

One of the pupils in Group A was absent for over a 
considerable period on account of sickness; this accounts 
for his low standing in both the Comprehension and Oral 
Reading Tests, Four of the other pupils in this group 
who graded P are students from whom the teacher could 
secure no cooperation whatsoever and their results would 
probably be the same under any method or system, A com¬ 
parison of their achievements in other subjects gave 
ample evidence of this. 

But even when these poor pupils are included, the 
results are very satisfactory and show a marked superior¬ 
ity on the part of the students working under the proposed 
method to read the French language correctly. 

(2) If the progress shown by the above results can 
be made in five months of the first year in High School, 
surely the results would be well worth while if the plan 
were carried out during the three years in which French 
is taught in the secondary schools. If, in five months* 
progress can be made enabling the student to understand 
a short selection that is read to him and to read the

language with fair facility, at the end of three years 
the pupil should, without exaggeration, be able to carry 
on a conversation and to read the language very well 
indeed. 

(3) The pupils who had access to the devices used 

in this investigation showed a greater interest in their 
work and were more willing to respond to the efforts 
of the teacher. The pupils gladly seized every opportu¬ 
nity offered them to speak and read the language. Much 
of the usual drudgery experienced in memorizing verb 
forms and vocabularies disappeared. The pupils felt that 
they were making some progress and had concrete evidence 
of their growing ability to read and understand French. 
The whole experiment was worth the time spent on it 
if only to see the satisfaction written on the pupil’s 
face when he had correctly answered a question in the 
foreign language. 

(4) The only results available to show the compara¬ 
tive abilities in the written work are the marks on the 
Christmas Test for Groups A and X. Group B had no term 
examination. On this test there were four more passes 
in Group A than in Group X. But even conceded that the 
pupils of Groups A and B were weaker now in the written 
work than those of Group X, the author is convinced that 
before the final examination these two groups will be 
equal to if not superior to Group X in this field of the 


work.

VI 

SUGGESTIONS 

(1) At the first opportunity a similar study should 
be carried out for the three years of High School French 
The results gathered from such an investigation would be 
very significant as to what can and vihat cannot be done 
in the teaching of Modern languages in this Province* 

(2) It would be preferable for an experiment of this 
type if the teacher were a bona-fide member of the staff 
He could then be in closer contact with his pupils and 
understand their individual problems better* 

(3) The group as much as possible should have no 
student repeating the course. Each group included in 
this experiment contained a number of repeaters. They 
are useless as subjects for the experiment and are more 
of a nuisance than an advantage. 

(4) Five months was too short a time in which to do 
full justice to the problem. Any further study on the 
topic should have as available time the ten months of 
the school year.
