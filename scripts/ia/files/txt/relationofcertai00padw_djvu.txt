THE RELATION OF CERTAIN WEEDS AND GRASSES TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CEREAL FOOT-ROTTING PATHOGENES IN 

THE SOIL 


G. W. Padwick 


INTRODUCTION 


The relation of higher plants to the development 
of saprophytic soil microorganisms is a subject which has 
received consideration for a number of years. Since a 
large amount of the work has been conducted with a view 
to solving some of the problems of soil fertility, 
emphasis has been laid largely upon the relation of plant 
growth to the numbers of microorganisms, and especially 
to certain groups of bacteria. 

The soil is a substratum of very complex nature. 
It is subject to innumerable combinations of changing 
physical and chemical conditions, and the microbiological 
population of the soil is an expression, quantitatively 
and qualitatively, of these combinations. The total number 
and the kinds of microorganisms are greatly affected by 
many known factors, such as available food supply, soil 
moisture, soil aeration, acidity or alkalinity and

temperature* Every one of these factors is undoubtedly 
affected by the growth of higher plants in the soil, and 
in spite of the accumulation of a great amount of data it 
is still impossible to predict with any very great degree 
of accuracy the microbial condition of a soil, even when it 
is possible to determine accurately the physical and chemical 
conditions. As a result it is realized that a true under¬ 
standing of soil conditions can only be obtained by a study 
of the physical and chemical conditions of the soil 
combined with some sort of measurement of soil micro¬ 
biological activity. Finally, even when we have got thus 
far, we find that those who have studied the problem 
closely are unable to agree upon the best methods of study 
of activity, one school being of the opinion that 
biological activity should be measured by the quantity of 
metabolic products produced in a given time, while the 
other school holds to the older but more specific method 
of dilution plate counts. 

If relation of higher plants to the general 
microbial population of the soil is complex, the reactions 
of certain plant pathogenes to varying conditions in the 
soil are still more involved. It is necessary to know to 
what extent any organism to be studied is able to live as a 
saprophyte in the soil, so that a knowledge of the 
individual reactions of each microorganism studied to the 
major changes in soil conditions is required. The present

study was undertaken primarily with the object of 
ascertaining in what ways the growth of higher plants may 
modify the soil as a substratum for fungi causing foot-rots 
of wheat. 

Three wheat foot-rotting organisms were selected 
for the study, namely Ophiobolus graminis Sacc., 
Helminthosporium sativum P.K.B., and Fusarium gr amine arum 
Schwabe. At the commencement of the investigation it was 
realized that there may be several possible effects of 
the growth of higher plants on such fungi. Of these, the 
following are suggested as having an important influence: 

1. Higher plants may become infected with 
wheat foot-rotting organisms in the soil, thus serving as 
medium well suited for their growth and development to the 
exclusion of saprophytes which normally, by providing 
competition, help to prevent any one form from obtaining 
dominance in the soil. Thus, with the balance upset, the 
cereal crops following susceptible species may be provided 
with an abundant source of inoculum. 

2. Susceptible plants other than cereals may 
be an important means by which foot-rotting organisms may 
persist in the field in the absence of a cereal crop. 

3. The pathogenes may spread through the soil 
more rapidly on or in roots of susceptible plants than in 
bare soil where the spread is checked by other competitive 
microorganisms.

4. The roots of plants may secrete compounds 
capable of stimulating the growth of organisms in the 
soil. The possibility of the occurrence of the reverse 
situation, namely, that some plants may secrete substances 
having an inhibitory effect upon the organisms, must also 
be considered. 

5. Higher plants, either living or dead, may 
be the chief means of overwintering of the pathogenes in 
the soil. 

WEEDS AND GRASSES AS A MEANS OF SURVIVAL AND SOURCE OF 
INOCULUM OF WHEAT FOOT-ROTTING ORGANISMS IN THE SOIL 


Review of Literature 


The relation of plants susceptible to cotton 
root-rot to the control of the disease (which is of 
considerable economic importance in the cotton growing 
districts of the United States) has engaged the attention 
of plant pathologists in recent years. Taubenhaus and 
Killough (32) in 1923 stated their belief that clean 
culture involving destruction of the winter carriers of the 
causal fungus, Phymatotrichum omnivorum , was of value in 
helping to control the cotton root-rot disease, while 
rotations involving only partial freedom from susceptible 
hosts were not effective. Taubenhaus, Dana and Wolff (31)

in 1929 concluded that it was impossible to control the 
disease without destroying susceptible perennial weeds. 
McNamara and Hooton (19) in 1929 found a one-year fallow 
insufficient, a two-year fallow or a one-year fallow in 
combination with a rotation system being necessary for 
control of cotton root-rot. 

Henry (11) compared the amount of foot- and 
root-rot of Marquis wheat grown continuously and in a 
five-year rotation (wheat, pasture, clover, oats, corn) in 
Minnesota. The percent of plants diseased on the continuous 
wheat plots was 58$ as compared with 20$ on the rotation 
plots. Sewell and Melchers (26) were compelled to abandon 
plots in which wheat was grown continuously in an experiment 
in Kansas owing to the severe infection of foot-rot, while 
wheat in the rotation division of the same experiment 
remained free from the disease. Greaney and Bailey (10) in 
1924 found that the first crop of wheat after fallow showed 
considerably less roots infected with root-rot than the 
succeeding crops. Russel (23) suggested a rotation on new 
land of breaking, wheat, oats, wheat, summerfallow for 
controlling take-all in Saskatchewan, and stated that care 
should be taken to avoid the growth of creeping rooted 
grasses and volunteer wheat. Sanford (25), as a result of 
an extended survey in Alberta, found wheat following wheat 
was heavily infected with root-rot. Infection of wheat 
following legumes was more severe than expected, and it was

suggested that this might be due to the presence of grass 
hosts in the legume sod. Russel (24) believed that 
Bromus inermis (brome grass), Agropyron tenerum {western 
rye grass), and A. repens (quack grass) all serve to 
increase the amount of take-all in crops of wheat following 
them in the rotation. 

All three organisms to be studied are able to 
carry on a saprophytic existence in the soil, but the 
extent to which they do so under natural conditions is 
not easily determined. 

Kirby (15) found that soil infested with 
Ophiobolus graminis . when screened and kept indoors for 
eight months, lost its ability to cause take-all of wheat, 
while bits of straw containing perithecia were able to 
cause severe infection when similarly treated. Davis (4) 
and Russel (22), however, have found this fungus to 
persist in bare soil for considerable periods. 

Davies (3) added Helminthosporium sativum and 
Fusarium graminearum in the form of mycelium or spores to 
unsterilized soil in boxes. The boxes were placed in the 
field and subjected to various treatments. H. sativum was 
recovered from bare fallow and after wheat, and F. 
graminearum was recovered from soil kept bare as well as 
from soil which grew wheat or oats. By one isolation 
method the soil yielded H. sativum after every treatment, 
regardless of whether the organism had been added to the 
soil or not at the commencement of the experiment.

Henry (12) found strong inhibition of H. sativum 
brought about by the introduction of small quantities of 
unsterilized black loam soil into pots of sterilized soil 
to which H. sativum inoculum had been added, and suggested 
that under natural conditions saprophytic microorganisms 
probably play a large part in maintaining at a low level 
the abundance of foot-rotting organisms in the soil. The 
same writer (13) found that spores of H. sativum occur 
rarely if ever in field soils, but points out that the 
fungus may be able to survive in the soil in the form of 
mycelium. 

Results of a number of investigations have given 
a fairly extended knowledge of the host range of the 
organisms concerned. Early reports of the occurrence of 
perithecia of 0. graminis on grasses were made by 
Saccardo, according to Kirby (15), in 1875, Waters (34), 
and Brittlebank (1). Kirby (15) in 1921 found A. repens 
commonly affected with take-all in New York state under 
natural conditions; in addition perithecia were formed on 
all six species of Agropyron studied, namely A. caninum , 

A. cristatum , A. intermedium , A. repens , A. Smithii and 
A. tenerum . In a later paper (16) the list of Agropyron 
species was extended to include A. desertorum , A. 
obtusiusculum , A. Richardsonii , A. seabrum and A. spicatum . 
Perithecia were also produced on Hordeum jubatum (wild 
barley). Rosen and Elliot (21) in 1925 found several

grasses attacked by Ophiobolus oarloeti in Arkansas, and 
in one instance found Chaetochloa geniculata (perennial 
foxtail) attacked on land which had never grown wheat. 
Padwick and Henry (20) called attention to the importance 
of ascertaining the relative degree of infection caused by 
foot-rotting organisms in various susceptible grasses in 
order to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of their 
importance in the foot-rot problem of Alberta. Bromus 
inermis, B. clllatus and all the species of Agropyron 
studied were severely damaged by 0. graminis on both 
sterilized and unsterilized soil (Plate I). Infection of 
Agropyron repens with £. graminis was found to be severe 
and general throughout the take-all areas of Alberta and 
was commonly associated with unusually heavy infection of 
wheat with take-all when growing as a weed in the crop 
(Plate II). In addition this weed was commonly infected 
with 0. graminis in summer fallow fields. Agropyron ten ©rum 
(western rye grass) was also severely damaged by 0. 
graminis under natural conditions (Plate III) . 

Dreschler (5) found that H. sativum commonly 
caused a leaf spot disease of A. repens in the mid-western 
United States. Stakman (27) obtained infection of leaves 
of Agropyron Smithii , A. repens and Hordeum Jubaturn with 
H. sativum . Christensen (2) isolated a species of 
Helminthosporium which he believed to be H. sativum from 
above ground parts of Agropyron eaninum , A. desertorum , 

A. repens , A. Smithii and A. tenerum, as well as other

grasses, under natural conditions. Seven species of 
Agropyron all showed infection of leaves to a more or less 
marked degree when inoculated with H. sativum in the green¬ 
house. Little attention was given to the amount of root 
infection. Padwick and Henry (20) found the root systems of 
all the twelve species of Agropyron studied, and also 
Bromus inermls and B. ciliatus to he infected with H. 
sativum (Plate IV). This fungus was also isolated from 
underground parts of Agropyron repens , A. tenerum , A. 
Rlchardsonii , and Bromus inermis growing in the field. 

Studies on the effects of Fusari uni graminearum on 
grasses (20) showed a general tendency for the fungus to 
attack the seeds and destroy them before emergence. Seedlings 
of species of Agropyron which emerged from the soil seemed to 
suffer little damage from the fungus, and the organism was 
rarely reisolated (Plate IV). It was, however, frequently 
yielded by Bromus inermis and B. ciliatus . 

Experimental Methods and Results 


Five species of higher plants of economic 
importance in Alberta were selected in order to determine 
their effect on the survival of £. graminis , H. sativum and 
F. graminearum in the soil and their role in increasing the 
amount of inoculum for infecting wheat. Four of the plants 
studied were graminaceous species, namely Agropyron tenerum

(western rye grass) and A. orIstatum (crested wheat grass), 
which are cultivated as forage crops in western Canada; A. 
repens (quack grass), which is a common weed in central 
Alberta and Bromus inermis (brome grass), which is grown 
considerably for forage purposes. All these grasses are 
perennials. The fifth species was a dicotyledonous plant, 
Neslia paniculata (ball mustard), an annual weed. 

The method adopted was to apply inoculum of the 
various organisms to pots of soil, together with seed of 
the species to be studied, and after a period of growth 
varying from five to eight weeks to seed the pots to wheat, 
which served as an indicator of the survival of the fungus 
in the soil and of its ability to reinfect wheat in planted 
soil as compared with controls in implanted soil. Some 
experiments were run concurrently, using the same controls; 
others were run separately and separate checks had to be 
used. In certain instances, owing to unsuitable temperatures 
obtained in the greenhouse while the experiments were being 
conducted, some series, together with their checks, had to 
be repeated in their entirety. 

The inoculum was prepared by growing the organisms 
on black loam soil in Erlenmeyer flasks, 50 grams per flask, 
to which was added 28 cc. of tap water. The flasks were 
plugged with cotton batting and sterilized in the autoclave 
before adding the fungus. The fungus was allowed to grow in 
the flask for 17 days at room temperature. Six-inch pots

were half filled with black loam sod and half of the pots 
were then sterilized in the autoclave for four hours. Each 
pot then had added to it as inoculum the entire contents 
of an Erlenmeyer flask. Seeds of the plant species to be 
studied were then placed in the pot and covered with soil. 

Ten replicates of each treatment were seeded, so that 
every species under investigation was grown in ten pots 
with each of the three fungi on sterilized soil, and ten 
pots on unsterilized soil. Similar pots were filled and 
had fungi added in a similar manner, but were not seeded, 
and these were used for comparison with the seeded pots. 

All the pots were then placed in the greenhouse, and the 
plants were allowed to grow for five to eight weeks. The 
top growth of the plants was then cut off and each pot was 
seeded with 25 seeds of Marquis wheat, which had previously 
been treated with hot water in order to kill as much as 
possible of any pathogenic fungi which might be present in 
or on the seeds. After three weeks the wheat seedlings were 
harvested and measured (from the base of the subcoronal 
internode to the tip of the longest leaf) and were awarded 
infection ratings which were later averaged for each pot 
and the series of pots and converted into degree of infection 
in percent. The results of these experiments are found in 
Appendix I to V, and are further summarized in Table 1.

Considering the three organisms separately, it is 
seen that in the case of Qphiobolus graminis there was in 
every case a very marked and significant increase in the 
degree of infection of wheat following grasses, on both 
sterilized and unsterilized soil. In fact, in the case of 
unsterilized soil, there was no trace of infection in the 
absence of weeds. It is seen that in most cases there was 
only a slight reduction in height of wheat plants. However, 
had a longer period elapsed before planting the wheat it is 
quite conceivable that differences in infection of wheat 
plants, and consequently in height of plants, would have 
been even greater. It is seen that Neslia paniculate 
effected no significant difference in the infection of 
wheat with take-all. 

With Helminthosporium sativum the most striking 
results were obtained on sterilized soil. After all the 
grasses, with the exception perhaps of Bromus inermis, a 
very marked increase of infection was accompanied by a 
marked decrease in height of the plants. On unsterilized 
soil the grasses effected only a small increase in 
infection, and excepting Bromus inermis , no decrease in 
height of plants. There was no increase in infection with 
Neslia paniculate . 

There was no significant increase of ffusarium 
graminearum foot-rot as a result of the growth of species 
of Agropyron , nor was there any increase caused by growth 
of Neslia paniculata . Wheat after Bromus inermis in

unsterilized soil, however, showed a striking increase of 
Fusarium foot-rot and a marked decrease in height of the 
plants. There was no increase of infection in sterilized 
soil, hut in view of the fact that on bare sterilized soil 
the infection reached 44.9$, a great increase would perhaps 
not be expected. 

The results in general show a close agreement 
with what was to be expected from results of experiments 
previously reported (20). In those experiments it was 
found that all the species of Agropyron studied were 
severely damaged by £. graminis , as also was Bromus inermis . 
The present results show that on bare unsterilized soil 
the organism under the conditions existing seemed to have 
disappeared, while on soil planted to A. tenerum , A, 
cristatum , A. repens and B. inermis considerable infection 
of the wheat occurred. In all cases a marked increase 
occurred in the degree of infection of wheat with £. 
graminis on unsterilized soil after susceptible grasses, 
indicating a tendency of the organism to accumulate in 
soil planted to these grasses. 

In the previous experiment all the four grasses 
studied were found susceptible to H. sativum , and all 
have served in the present experiments to increase the 
amount of inoculum of this organism on sterilized soil. 

The amounts of increase on unsterilized soil were not 
very significant. It was previously found that none of the 
four grasses appeared to be damaged by H. sativum on

unsterilized soil to the same extent as they were by 
graminis , and for this reason it was only to be expected 
that the grasses would play a somewhat smaller role in carry¬ 
ing over the organism and serving as a source of inoculum 
for the succeeding wheat. B. inermis was the only grass 
of the four studied which was infected and damaged by F. 
graminearum on unsterilized soil, and it was the only 
grass which served to increase the amount of inoculum of 
this organism in unsterilized soil. In no instance did 
Neslia paniculate serve to aid in the survival or increase 
of any wheat foot-rotting pathogenes in the soil. 

These results support the view expressed earlier 
in this thesis that the mere fact that a plant is 
susceptible to attack by wheat foot-rotting pathogenes 
under the unusual conditions of experimental inoculation, 
especially on sterilized soil, is not adequate in giving 
an indication of the role which it may play in the foot-rot 
problem of wheat. It is necessary to obtain an indication 
of the relative amount of damage done to these susceptible 
plants, on unsterilized as well as sterilized soil, before 
a reliable estimation of their importance in the problem 
may be made.

THE EFFECT OF GRASSES ON THE HORIZONTAL SPREADING 
OF CEREAL FOOT-ROTTING ORGANISMS 


Review of Literature 


The spread of microorganisms in the soil is a 
subject which for many years has aroused the interest not 
only of workers in the field of microbiology, but also 
those interested in the wider fields of general biology 
and agriculture. The typical "fairy rings” of lawns and 
pastures have aroused curious interest for centuries, but 
it is only comparatively recent knowledge which has shed 
light on the cause and nature of the phenomenon. These 
rings are now known to be due to the growth of fungi of 
the class Basidiomycetes . 

Microorganisms vary greatly in their ability 
to spread from one point to another in the soil. What 
little evidence we have concerning bacteria suggests that 
possibly their rate of spread in the soil is small. 
Frazier and Fred (8) attempted to determine the rate of 
spread of the root nodule-forming bacteria of legumes in 
soil and found that in flat iron boxes in which movement 
of water was reduced to a minimum the organisms spread 
only 0.1 to 0.2 inches a day. Sterilized limed yellow 
sand was used in the boxes. In addition, in a field

experiment in which soy beans were planted three feet apart 
in each direction, alternate plants were inoculated with B. 
radicicola . With one exception, after about three months 
from the date of seeding, the uninoculated plants showed 
no sign of nodules, while inoculated plants were thickly 
studded with nodules. 

More definite demonstrations of ability to 
spread in soil is afforded by fungi. Mention has already 
been made of the fungi causing "fairy rings", which tend 
to increase in diameter as the organisms progress in the 
soil until they have reached many feet in diameter. One 
of the most remarkable fungi reported in this connection 
is the cotton root-rot fungus, Phymatotrichum omnivarum , 
which also attacks alfalfa and many other dicotyledonous 
plants. In fields of alfalfa in Arizona King (14) in 1923 
found this organism spreading rapidly in almost perfect 
circles. In cotton fields the organism spread in all 
directions from single infected plants at the astounding 
rate of 4-§- meters in 50 days. McNamara and Hooton (19) 
in 1929 found that the most active killing of plants 
occurred always on the outer edge of the circle, the 
plants in the ring of the previous year’s growth not being 
killed until late in the season and in some cases remaining 
unharmed when the weather was unfavourable for the growth 
of the fungus. It was suggested that the fungus either used 
up all the available food as it progressed or else left a 
toxin in the soil retarding its growth.

The difficulty of isolating Ophiobolus gramlnis 
from the soil and from infected plants, its weak saprophytic 
growth, and the inconspicuous nature of the symptoms of 
the disease it causes when in the early stage, have made a 
knowledge of the distribution and progress of the organism 
in the soil under field conditions difficult to obtain. 
Russel (25) in 1928 was unable to demonstrate the spread 
of take-all from inoculated seedlings in the center of 
eight-inch crocks to seedlings sown closely around them, 
the neighbouring plants reaching maturity without showing 
symptoms. Fellows (6) has found the organism present to a 
depth of at least ten inches in infested soils in Kansas, 
but it is possible that the organism may have been carried 
to this depth by deep ploughing. It seems to be the 
popular belief that the circular patches of diseased wheat 
plants in fields are the result of the radial growth of the 
organism from a center of infection. Similar circular 
spots in A. repens have been observed (20) to be very 
marked in a field which had remained uncultivated for 
several years and was supporting a thick stand of this 
weed (Plate II, Figure 1). 

Experimental Methods and Results 

Improved technic in isolating Ophiobolus graminis 
from the soil has made possible a study of the conditions 
under which this organism survives and spreads. Extensive

experiments were outlined to determine whether this 
organism, and also Fusarium graminearum , are able to spread 
progressively through unsterilized soil, both when bare and 
when planted to various grasses and to wheat* 

Owing to the extensiveness of the experiment 
and the large amount of isolation work involved, the 
experiments were conducted with the two organisms at 
different times, first with F. graminearum (in the summer 
of 1932) and then with £. graminis (in the winter of 
1932- 1 33). There were, however, no essential differences 
in the methods adopted in each case. On June 28th fifteen 
flat wooden boxes, size 25 x 16 x 3^- inches, were filled 
to a depth of 2§- inches with unsterilized black loam soil, 
obtained from land kept bare for five years. Three boxes 
were seeded with wheat, three with Agropyron tenerum , and 
three with A. repens . About 200 seeds were sown in each 
box. The remaining six boxes were not seeded. All were 
placed in the greenhouse at a soil temperature of about 20°C. 
and kept watered. On July 29th, after the plants had become 
well established, a narrow trench was dug to the full depth 
of the soil, two inches from one end and across the full 
width of each box. In this was placed inoculum of F. 
graminearum , prepared by growing the fungus for 17 days 
in Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 50 grams of moist 
sterilized soil plus 10% of cornmeal. Two flasks were 
used for each box. Three of the unplanted boxes were 
treated in a precisely similar manner, while the remaining

three had placed in the trenches a similar quantity of 
sterilized soil and cornmeal which, however, had no fungus 
growing on it. Thus it was possible to compare the spread 
of the organism in the presence of the two grasses, in the 
presence of wheat, and in unplanted soil. The purpose of 
the uninoculated boxes was to check against the natural 
occurrence of the fungus in the soil, which would at once 
have rendered the results valueless. On September 7th, 
after removing the top growth, Marquis wheat which had 
been treated with hot water to reduce the seed-borne foot- 
rotting fungi to a minimum, was seeded in rows across the 
flat along the original trench, and in rows parallel to it 
and two inches apart. Twelve rows were seeded in all. 
Twenty seeds were placed in each row, a small hole being 
made for each seed with a wooden meat skewer, a new meat 
skewer being used for each row. On September 27th the 
wheat plants from one box under each treatment were dug 
up and measured, the degree of infection of each plant was 
recorded, and underground parts of plants in all rows 
showing any trace of foot-rot were removed. These under¬ 
ground parts were surface sterilized by dipping for 1^- 
minutes in mercuric chloride (1 gm. in a liter) and 
washing in 75% alcohol. The second group of boxes was 

harvested and treated similarly on October 1st, and the 
third replicate on October 6th. The average length and 
the average degree of infection in percent of each row of 
wheat plants, together with the results of the isolations 
are shown in Appendix VII.

A few slight modifications were made for 0. 
graminis . As stated previously, the experiment was conducted 
during the winter, being commenced about November 1st. 
Inoculum of £. graminis (strain 108, obtained from A. repens ) 
was added November 29th. In order to minimize washing of 
inoculum over the soil in the boxes, the boxes were tilted 
slightly, so that if the organism were carried at all by 
the water it would be in the opposite direction to that 
in which the rate of spread was to be determined. Only 
ten rows of wheat were seeded, on January 20th, fifty-two 
days after adding the inoculum to the end of the box. All 
three replicates were harvested on February 14th. In 
sterilizing for re-isolation, silver nitrate was used 
instead of mercuric chloride. Small portions of roots 
were dipped in silver nitrate solution (1 gram in 100 cc. 
of water) for one minute, and the silver nitrate was then 
precipitated with concentrated sodium chloride solution, 
after which they were plated in petri dishes. Results are 
shown in Appendix VI. 

The averages of lengths of plants and degree of 
infection in percent for the three replicates of each 
treatment are further summarized in tables 2 and 3. The 
distances of spread of 0. graminis in each box under the 
various treatments are shown in table 4.

The results with £. graminis are striking and 
significant. Not only are there very great differences 
in the distances the organism spread under different 
treatments, but also there is in most cases quite close 
agreement between the replicates of each series. Appendix 
VI shows that the organism spread in only one of the three 
boxes of unplanted soil, and there it only spread about two 
inches to cause a smell amount of infection of wheat. In 
boxes growing wheat it spread six inches in one box and 
eight inches in the other two; under A. tenerum it spread 
four, twelve and eight inches; and in all boxes of A. repens 
it spread four inches. The organism was in no instance 
isolated from wheat plants from the uninoculated flats.

An interesting point is demonstrated in the degree of 
infection columns of Appendix VI and table 2. It is seen 
that in almost all planted boxes there was less infection 
along the rows where the inoculum was added than there was 
two or four inches away (Plate V) . This may have been due 
to one or all of several causes. The wheat plants may have 
been stimulated by the cornmeal added to the soil with the 
inoculum, and thus have grown so rapidly as to overcome to 
some extent the effects of the organism; the cornmeal may 
have stimulated growth of saprophytic organisms detrimental 
to £. graminis ; cutting out the trench destroyed some of 
the grass and wheat plants originally in the soil, and may 
thus have reduced the amount of preferential medium for 
growth of £. graminis ; or there may have been a tendency, 
as suggested by McNamara and Hooton (19) in Phymatotrichum 
omnivorum , for the greatest damage to be caused in the 
neighbourhood of the most recent advances of the organism. 
The latter possibility is one well worthy of further 
investigation. In any case, it is seen that there is a 
marked tendency for £. graminis to spread in soil planted to 
wheat or susceptible grasses, whereas on unplanted soil 
there appears to be little or no tendency to spread. 

Results with F. graminearum were irregular and 
less conclusive. Unfortunately several important points 
were overlooked in conducting the experiment. While 
considerable care was taken in watering the boxes, they

were not sloped and some washing of soil no doubt occurred. 

The effects of this were accentuated by the fact that the 
inoculum contained spores. That these spores were carried 
for considerable distances is evidenced by the fact that 
single infected plants were found isolated from other 
infected plants, by as much as fourteen inches in one 
instance. The F. graminearum causing this infection 
evidently came from the original inoculum, since in no 
instance was the organism isolated from uninoculated soil. 
Another mistake was that of allowing the wheat plants for 
isolation to grow for so long a period before removing 
them from the soil to isolate F. graminearum . Especially 
in the last two series harvested there was so heavy an 
infection with Helminthosporium sativum (indicated by H 
in the isolation column) occurring naturally in the soil 
that the degrees of infection recorded in the columns of 
Appendix YH are rendered almost meaningless. The only 
value of these columns is in demonstrating the increase in 
damage caused hy H. sativum on naturally infested soil 
following wheat, A. tenerum and A. repens . It should he 
mentioned here that a similar experiment to those described 
above was first conducted with H. sativum added to the soil, 
but the natural occurrence of the organism in the soil 
rendered the results valueless. It can only he said that 
there is no definite evidence that the spread of F. graminearum 
in unsterilized soil is affected by the presence of 
susceptible plants in the soil.

EFFECTS OF GRASSES ON OVERWINTERING OF THE 
FOOT-ROTTING FUNGI 


Review of Literature 


Taubenhaus and Killough (32) pointed out that in 
the case of cotton root-rot in Texas bare fallow would only 
be efficient in controlling the disease provided susceptible 
weeds and plants were kept under control in winter as well 
as summer. It must be remembered, however, that this 
organism is capable of infecting healthy plants during the 
winter weather in Texas, so that overwintering becomes a 
minor part of the problem in that climate, and the problem 
resolves itself into a question of the survival of the 
organism in the soil comparable to the summer survival, 
but somewhat less intensified owing to the reduced rate of 
growth. It is interesting to compare the problem of the 
survival of wheat foot-rotting organisms in the severe 
climate of Alberta with that of Fhymatotrichum omnivorum 
in Texas. 

Davis (4) found Qphiobolus graminis able to 
overwinter at Madison, Wisconsin, in both mycelial and 
ascospore stages, but under much less severe conditions 
than those occurring in Alberta. Foster (7) found that 
mycelia of Helminthosporium sativum and Fusariurn graminearum

survived the severe winter of 1928-29 on barley seeds buried 
in the soil and on wheat stubble, and that spores of H. 
sativum and F. graminearum were viable in the spring after 
overwintering in the open. In the winter of 1931-32, 

Davies (3) isolated Ophiobolus graminis from naturally 
infected stubble in the field at various periods throughout 
the winter. The fungus also survived in mycelial form when 
grown saprophytically in flasks of sterilized soil and then 
placed outside for the entire winter. 

Presumably, owing to the low temperatures 
maintained during the winter in Alberta, all organisms must 
be in a dormant state. Whether susceptible plants are 
present or not there will necessarily be no growth of the 
organisms. Furthermore, susceptible perennial host plants 
cannot be destroyed during the winter. The results of 
Davies and Foster indicate that the organisms may survive 
in the soil without the presence of such infected dead 
material, though it is possible that they may be more 
susceptible to freezing injury in some substrata than in 
others. In spring, resumption of growth would probably be 
more certain if a favourable medium were present. Perennial 
plants would probably be able to get an early start in the 
spring and thus the disease might start at the place where 
it left off in the fall. This seems in the light of present 
knowledge to be a minor problem, and experiments were 
therefore not conducted.

THE EFFECTS OF PLANT MATERIALS ON THE GROWTH OF 
OPHIQBOLUS GRAMINIS 


Review of Literature 


The conditions of the soil for growth of micro¬ 
organisms are constantly undergoing change as a result of 
many factors, one of which is the growth of higher plants. 
That higher plants can and do exercise a marked influence 
on the abundance and type of the soil microflora has been 
amply demonstrated. 

Wilson and Lyon (35) showed that the growth of 
corn and timothy in tubes of sterilized soil, to which were 
added pure cultures of a number of different organisms, 
resulted in a marked increase in the numbers of these 
organisms as compared with unplanted soil. Martin (18) 
showed that a marked specificity was exhibited by alfalfa 
and sweet clover in their effects on the relative numbers 
of different kinds of fungi in the soil. Starkey (28) 
found an increase in numbers of fungi in the neighbourhood 
of plant roots over the numbers one foot distant to vary 
from 6% to 80%. The superficial layers of the roots of 
corn, mangel beet and bean showed very marked increases 
even over the soil in close proximity to the main root (30). 
It seemed to be the quality rather than the quantity of 
root excretions that had the greater effect (29).

Thom and Humfeld (33) grew corn on a number of 


different soils and made dilution plate counts of the 
numbers of bacteria at different distances from the roots 
and on the plant roots themselves. Determination of pH 
showed that the roots themselves always tended to center 
around neutrality, and that as a rule this effect is carried 
to the adjacent soil as well. The writers concluded that 
the increased numbers of organisms about the plant roots 
was due to the formation of this neutral zone, but their 
conclusions do not seem to be fully borne out by the 
figures. The greatest increase of all was found in Carrington 
loam, and yet there the pH of the soil and of the soil 
adjacent to the roots was 7.0, while that of the fibrous 
roots themselves which had seven times as many bacteria as 
the adjacent soil was 7.6. Lyon and Wilson (17) found that 



their growth plants liberate quite large quantities 


of organic matter^ and this, forming available nutrient 
material, seems to be the most satisfactory explanation of 
the increased activities of microorganisms in the neighbour¬ 
hood of plant roots. 


Experimental Methods and Results 


It was considered that it would be of value to 


determine whether the material liberated from plants 
susceptible to foot-rots and those resistant differ in the 
extent to which they influence the growth of foot-rotting

fungi. In order to conduct experiments it was necessary to 
obtain a larger amount of material than could be obtained 
from the sloughed off material of plants grown in flasks. 
Since this sloughed off material consists mainly of plant 
cells, it seemed reasonable to conclude that similar 
material could be obtained by crushing up the entire roots 
of various species of grasses. In addition, it was 
necessary to cut down the work as much as possible by 
using only one organism, namely Ophlobolus graminis . 

In the first experiment attempts were made to 
determine not only if there were any effects on the growth 
of £. graminis by adding extracts of crushed plant roots, 
but also to determine whether such plant roots, after 
decomposition by other organisms, would continue to have 
an influence. 

Pots of sterilized soil were seeded with Agropyron 
repens , A. tenerum , Tritioum vulgare and Phleum pratense , 
These plants were grown for more than three months and 
the roots were then removed, thoroughly washed, and air 
dried. As the amounts of root material of wheat and timothy 
were small, they were supplemented by roots of the same 
plants grown on unsterilized soil. No diseased roots were 
observed in any instance and no rhizomes had formed on plants 
of A. repens . After being thoroughly dried, the roots were 
ground up to a fine powder, weighed out into half-gram lots 
and placed in test tubes. In addition, checks were made up

similarly with filter paper, well ground up, to be used with 
a nutrient solution. To each of these check tubes was added 
5 oc. of Richard Duggar's solution made up as follows: 


KN0 S 

10 gm. 

“Vi 

5 gm. 

MgS0 4 .7H 2 0 

2,5 gm. 

Sucrose 

50 gm. 


Distilled water 1000 cc. 

To the tubes of ground roots just sufficient 
distilled water was added so that the material would soak 
it up and leave no water lying on the surface. The following 


amounts were therefore added: 


Agropyron repens 

5.5 oc. 

A. tenerum 

5.0 c c. 

Triticum vulgare 

3.5 cc. 

Phleum pratense 

3.5 cc. 


All the tubes were then placed in the autoclave 
for one-half hour at 15 pounds pressure. They were then 
inoculated with two saprophytic organisms, namely 
Penicillium oyaneo fulvum and a species of Rhizopus 
obtained from the surface of a wheat kernel. 

After twelve days 15 cc. of distilled water were 
added to each test tube, which was shaken for about one 
minute and then filtered immediately through filter paper. 
The liquids from the test tubes in each replicate were 
bulked, and the 15 different solutions were then sterilized

by means of Berkefeld filters. Into a number of petri dishes 
were poured 5 cc. of each extract, as many replicates being 
made as material would allow, the number varying from as 
low as 2 in the case of A. tenerum with no organism up to 19 
in the case of wheat with P. cyaneo fulvum . In addition 5 cc. 
of sterile water was added to a number of plates as checks. 
Then to each plate was added 15 cc. of sodium nitrate agar 


(34) made up as follows: 

Sodium nitrate (NaNQ^) 2.0 g. 

KH 2 P0 4 1.0 g. 

KOI 0.5 g. 

MgS0 4 .7E 2 0 0.5 g. 

FeS0 4 0.01 g. 

Sucrose 30.0 g. 

Distilled water 1000 cc. 

Agar 20.0 g. 


The dishes were planted with tiny portions of 
Ophiobolus gra minis IV, using as small pieces as could be 
conveniently obtained from the surface of an agar slant 
culture. Young cultures of equal age were used for the 
purpose. 

After 9 days growth at 20°C. measurements were 
taken of the diameter of the colonies. Any plates showing 
extensive contamination were discarded. The type of colony 
showed very little variation except in the case of the water 
check and the Richard Dugger*s solution checks, in which 
cases growth was always much weaker than when root extract

Prom these results the following conclusions may

1. There was in all cases a stimulation in growth 
caused by addition of root extracts as compared with checks 
using sterilized distilled water added directly to the agar 
in the dishes, and also in the instances where Duggar f s 
solution was added to filter paper and treated in a manner

similar to the roots, with the possible exceptions of the 
oases noted below in (4). 

2. On the average, the Duggar’s solution check 
showed growth of double the diameter of growths in water 
checks and the fungus on agar which had root extracts 
added showed 50$ increase over the filter paper Dugger*s 
solution extracts. 

3. The differences between different root 
extracts were on the average no greater than the differences 
between different organisms. 

4. There was less growth with extracts of A. 
tenerum and Phleum pratense with Penicillium than there 
was with Duggar’s solution and Penicillium . 

5. With the exceptions noted above in (4), it 
did not appear that the decomposition products of the roots 
and the staling products of these two fungi themselves had 
any appreciable stimulatory or inhibitory effect on the 
growth of Ophlobolus graminis as compared with extracts 
which had not been decomposed. 

These results suggest that possibly the presence 
of roots in the soil, even roots of plants not susceptible 
to take-all, may stimulate the growth of 0. graminis in the 
soil, and that the decomposition products of these roots 
when decomposed by the two organisms studied, and the staling 
products of these organisms themselves, will not affect 
seriously this stimulation. It must be realized that other 
organisms might give different results.

These results led to a further and more extensive 
study of the stimulatory effects of root extracts on £. 
graminis . The following grasses and cereals were grown in 
sterilized soil for three months: Agropyron repens , A. 
tenerum, Triticum vulgare , Avena fatua, Bromus inermis , 
Phleum pretense and Hordeum jubatum . They were then air- 
dried and ground to powder in a Wylie Mill. To 20 grams 
of root material of each species was added 300 cc. of 
distilled water. The flasks were well shaken and then 
allowed to stand for 18 hours at a temperature of 5°C., which 
was considered too low for any appreciable fermentation to 
take place. The extracts were then sterilized by means of 
Berkefeld filters, and distilled water was sterilized in a 
similar manner for use as checks. By means of sterile 
pipettes 5 cc. of extract, or water in the case of the 
checks, was added to each of a series of petri dishes. Thus 
each petri dish contained the equivalent of the extract from 
one-third gram of plant root material. 

Two types of agar were used in the study, one 
being potato dextrose agar giving a dense growth of 0. 
graminis which should show to a marked degree if any 
inhibitory action were present; the other, soil extract agar, 
a poor medium for the growth of 0^. graminis , and one there¬ 
fore well suited to illustrate a stimulatory effect. Both 
types of agar were made up according to the formula of Fred 
and Waksman ( 9), except that only three quarters of the

normal amount of water was used, thus making due allowance 
for the extract added separately to the dishes. Edmonton 
black loam was used in making the soil extract agar. 

The potato dextrose agar consisted of: 

Agar 30.0 gm. 

Potato 200.0 gm. 

Dextrose 20.0 gm. 

Tap water 750.0 cc. 

The soil extract agar had the following composition: 

Agar 12.5 gm. 

Glucose 1.0 gm. 

Dipotassium phosphate (KgHPO^) 0.5 gm. 

Soil extract (stock) 100.0 cc. 

Tap water 650.0 cc. 

The stock solution of soil extract was prepared 
by heating 1000 grams of Edmonton black loam soil with 1000 
cc. of tap water in the autoclave for thirty minutes. A 
small amount of calcium carbonate was added and the whole 
was filtered through a double paper filter. 

It will be seen that both media contained only 
750 cc. of water instead of 1 liter. As 15 cc. of agar 
were added to each dish containing 5 cc. of root extract, 
the water content of the agar was brought up to normal. 

The colonies were measured after seven days growth, 
and table 6 shows the average diameters of the colonies in 
centimeters in descending order of magnitude.

It was noticed that there was a marked difference 
in the density of mycelium in different series. On soil 
extract agar the growth was much less dense in all cases 
than on potato dextrose agar; this was especially true of the 
water check, which showed so thin a growth that on a basis of 
actual weight of mycelium produced it would certainly be 
below all the others.

Owing to a very considerable increase in growth 
the colonies were again measured three days later, and in 
order to obtain as nearly as possible a true comparison of 
amount of growth, an arbitrary system was adopted in which 
results could be expressed in terms of "growth index" as 
well as directly in order of diameter of the colonies. 

This "growth index" was obtained by placing the colonies 
in five classes according to density of growth. These 
classes were valued at densities of 1 to 5, and the growth 
index of each series is the average growth index of all 
the colonies in the series; each individual index being 
the product of the diameter of the colony multiplied by 
the class value. It is not suggested that such a grading 
will give a true comparison in all cases; certainly it is 
not suitable for comparing amounts of growth on the two 
different types of medium. In other words, this "growth 
index" is merely an arbitrary scheme used in an attempt 
to place on a mathematical and tangible basis results which 
cannot be suitably expressed as a measurement of a single 
variable such as diameter of the colony. As will be seen 
in table 7, the results do not differ greatly from those 
obtained three days previously; where the order has been 
changed the differences are small except in the case of the 
water check on soil extract agar, which on a basis of actual 
weight of mycelium would undoubtedly have shown the least 
growth in both cases.

used in the previous one, but contains much less carbo¬ 
hydrates. Comparing the descending list on soil extract 
agar in this experiment with table 5, column 2, it is 
seen that in both cases extract from Agropyron tenerum 
causes greatest stimulation of growth of Qphiobolus graminis , 
and that from Agropyron repens causes least of the four 
extracts under consideration. Triticum vulgare and Phleum 
pratense extracts have interchanged their position in the 
second experiment, but the difference in the first 
experiment was small and not significant. 

The most striking result was the stimulation of 
growth of 0. graminis by extract of Avena fatua on potato 
dextrose agar. Avena fatua is believed not to be 
susceptible to take-all. The main points brought out by 
the second experiment are: 

1. On potato dextrose agar, which is a good 
nutritive medium and contains ample carbohydrates for growth 
of 0. graminis , the only plant extracts stimulating growth 
are those from wild oats and timothy, both believed to be 
highly resistant to £. graminis , and in no case does there 
appear to be any detrimental effect produced by the extract. 

2. On soil extract agar there is considerable 
stimulation of growth by all extracts as compared with the 
extremely weak growth on the water check, and the amount of 
stimulation does not correspond with the susceptibility of 
the plants to attack by 0,. graminis .

In all the cases studied the addition of extracts 
from plant roots to media on which 0. graminis was growing 
resulted in increased growth of this fungus when the 
nutritional value of the medium was low, and while the 
different plants gave varying degrees of stimulation, this 
could not in any way be correlated with the susceptibility 
of the grass to take-all. This suggests, therefore, that 
accumulation of dead root material even of non-susceptible 
grasses may possibly cause an increased growth of 0. graminis . 

It must, however, be remembered that in the soil a great 
many complicating factors may arise to upset this influence. 

It seems also reasonable to conclude that since 
in no case is any inhibition of growth by non-susoeptible 
species recorded, but rather a stimulation of greater or 
lesser extent; resistance to attack by 0. graminis is not 
due to the production by the higher plant of a chemical substance 
which remains toxic after the death of the tissue. If a 
toxic substance is produced, it evidently loses its toxicity 
very soon after the death of the plant tissue. 

Finally, it might be mentioned that while these 
results are by no means conclusive, it does not on the 
surface appear as if there would be any great likelihood of 
actually causing an inhibition of growth of 0. graminis in 
the soil by growing non-susceptible plants. On the other 
hand, this does not in any way affect the general principle 
shown by other experiments, that in order to keep take-all 
in check, it is necessary to use rotations which at certain

I to the exclusion of saprophytic microorganisms. 


GENERAL DISCUSSION 


A number of grasses of the genus Agropyron are 
distributed over the province of Alberta, some growing as 
native grasses and weeds, and others under cultivation. 
One of the most common of these weeds is A. repens , while 
A. tenerum is cultivated to a considerable extent, and A. 
cristatum is likely to become important as a forage crop, 
especially in the drier parts. Bromus inermis is 
cultivated extensively particularly in central Alberta. 
The use of grasses as forage crops is likely to become 
more widespread as time goes on. At the same time, 
rotations have been urged for many of the problems of the 
farmer, such as the maintenance of the fertility of the 
soil, and the prevention of soil drifting. Another 
plausible argument which has been advanced in favour of 
rotations is that they tend to reduce damage from foot- 
and root-rots. 

Many of the rotations suggested involve the use 
of grasses, such as western rye grass and brome grass. 
Furthermore, grass mixtures often allow the increase of 
weed grasses such as Agropyron repens . If, then, such

grasses serve in any way to increase the quantity of foot- 
rotting organisms in the soil, it is hardly to be expected 
that farming methods involving their use will help in 
solving the foot-rot problem. 

All the evidence is to the effect that susceptible 
species tend to aid £. graminis to survive in the soil, to 
increase the amount of inoculum of this organism for 
succeeding wheat crops, and to aid greatly its spread in 
the soil. In the case of H. sativum the effects are somewhat 
less marked, but there is sufficient evidence to conclude 
that most species of Agropyron as well as Bromus inermis 
increase the amount of inoculum of this organism in the 
soil, and since the fungus seems to be of widespread 
distribution, it seems probable that such grasses will 
play a part in the foot-rotting of wheat by this organism 
also. With regard to F. graminearum , there seems to be a 
fair amount of evidence that Agropyron species do not 
appreciably increase the amount of inoculum or rate of 
spread of this organism. Bromus inermis , on the other hand, 
may be of importance, at least in increasing the amount of 
inoculum. 

Little work has been done with non-susceptible 
species, and it is impossible yet to draw any definite 
conclusions, though there is evidence obtained from extract 
experiments that even such species may serve to stimulate 
growth of 0. graminis . On the other hand, non-pathogenic

fungi would probably be stimulated to an equal or greater 
extent. No evidence has yet indicated that resistant or 
immune species can be expected actually to have a detrimental 
effect on the foot-rotting fungi. 

Survey work conducted in the province has 
indicated that the damage caused by take-all is probably 
greater than that caused by other foot-rotting organisms, 
and for this reason special emphasis should be laid on 
the take-all problem. It is evident from the results that 
in order to control take-all, susceptible species should be 
avoided or used sparingly in rotations. Experimental 
results and field observations show that old stands of 
western rye grass have a marked effect upon the accumulation 
of 0. graminis , and for this reason cultivation of this 
crop should not be encouraged where take-all is a serious 
problem. It has been seen that A. repens occurs often even 
in fallow fields where other weeds have been kept under 
control. Rotations which do not involve eradication of 
this grass, and summerfallow methods which do not destroy 
it, cannot be expected to solve the problem, and may even 
intensify it. From knowledge that has accumulated so far 
it would seem that awnless brome grass may perhaps be a 
lesser offender in this respect than western rye grass, 
but it certainly is not entirely free from blame. There is 
reason to suppose that timothy does not increase foot-rots 


of wheat

The experiments shed light upon the manner in 
which 0. graminis spreads in the soil. This organism 
spreads little, if at all, in bare soil, but in soil 
supporting growth of susceptible grasses it spread to a 
considerable distance. It is true that the greatest 
spread which occurred was only twelve inches in six weeks, 
but when it is considered that during this short period it 
had to establish itself upon healthy young plants in the 
soil and pass from plant to plant by means of a fine net¬ 
work of roots; that no attempt was made to provide ideal 
conditions for the growth of the organism in the soil; that 
previous attempts to demonstrate the spread of the organism 
had resulted in failure; and that in the unplanted soil 
the degree of infection of wheat seedlings grown actually 
in the inoculum only six weeks after it was applied was 
much lighter than that of plants two and four inches 
distant in planted soil, there is abundant evidence that 
susceptible species aid greatly the spread of the organism, 
if, indeed, they are not absolutely essential. 

When we add to all this the fact that a stand 
of western rye grass may itself become so severely attacked 
by 0. graminis as to be largely destroyed and permit the 
entrance of numerous noxious weeds, it is seen that there 
are good reasons to consider seriously the advisability 
of discouraging the use of this crop for forage purposes 
in the foot-rat areas. A further study should undoubtedly

be made of the damage caused to stands of this grass with 
increasing age, as it seems possible that fields left down 
for only two or three years may not be a great menace. 

It is suggested that before any grass be 
recommended for a forage crop in the foot-rot areas it 
should first be thoroughly investigated by some such methods 
as those followed in this investigation to determine its 
capabilities in regard to the survival, accumulation, and 
rate of spread of plant pathogenes. Even some of those 
grasses at present in cultivation should be investigated 
further. Amongst these is brome grass, which should be 
more carefully studied under natural conditions in the 
field. Rotation studies, and the history of infested 
fields, should yield valuable additional information. 

There seems to be little doubt that adoption of 
rotations, including crops not susceptible to attack by 
wheat foot-rotting organisms, and the use of really clean 
summerfallow, will be of great value in reducing the 
foot-rot problem. 


SUMMARY 


1. Higher plants are known to have a marked effect 

on the abundance, activity and type of microorganisms in 


the soil

2. Many species of Agropyron and other grasses are 
known to be susceptible to attack by wheat foot-rotting 
organisms. It was desired to determine whether these 
grasses are of significance in the wheat foot-rot problem 
in Alberta, 

3. Organisms chosen for study were Qphiobolus 
graminis Saoc., Helminthosporium sativum P.K.B., and 
Fusarium graminearum Schwabe. 

4. Agropyron tenerum, A. cristatum , A. repens and 
Bromus inermis aided the survival of (). graminis in 
unsterilized soil, and increased the infection of the 
wheat crop following with this organism on both sterilized 
and unsterilized soil. 

5. All four grasses increased the infection of the 
succeeding wheat with H. sativum to a marked degree on 
sterilized soil, but only slightly on unsterilized soil. 

6. The only grass studied which increased the 
infection of the succeeding wheat with F. graminearum was 
Bromus inermis , which increased infection on unsterilized 
soil. 

7 . Neslia paniculate (ball mustard) apparently had 
no effect on the amount of foot-rot of the wheat following 


it.

8- The amount of damage of grass roots with foot-rot 

when grown under varied experimental conditions appears to 
give some indication of the importance of the grass in the 
foot-rot problem. 

9. 0 m . graminis did not appear to spread in 
unsterilized, bare soil, but spread at varying rates in 
soil planted to wheat, Agropyron tenerum and A. repens . 

10. The role of grasses in the overwintering of 
wheat foot-rotting organisms, although not studied 
experimentally in this investigation, would appear on the 
surface not to be essentially different from that holding 
during the summer. 

11. Extracts of roots of Agropyron repens , A. 
tenerum , Phleum pratense and wheat partially decomposed by 
Penicillium cyaneo fulvum and Rhizopus sp. caused 
stimulation of growth of £. graminis on sodium nitrate agar. 
As a rule, the partial decomposition of the roots by fungi 
tested did not seem to reduce the stimulatory effect. 

12. Unheated root extracts of a number of grasses 
stimulated growth of 0. graminis on potato dextrose agar 
and soil extract agar. There seemed to be no correlation 
between susceptibility of the species and the extent to 
which it stimulated 0. graminis in pure culture.

13. It is possible that even resistant species liberate 
in the soil substances stimulating growth of 0. graminls , 

but probably this effect is masked by other organisms. 

14. No evidence was obtained that resistant plants have an 
inhibitory effect on the oereal foot-rotting fungi in the soil. 

15. Rotations should not be expected to aid in the control 
of foot-rots of wheat if susceptible grasses such as western 
rye grass ( Agropyron tenerum ) are included in the rotation. 

16. Agropyron repens occurs commonly as a weed in 
many parts of Alberta, even in summerfallow fields, and 
without its destruction take-all cannot be controlled. 

17. The summerfallow is valueless in controlling 
foot-rot unless susceptible weeds are destroyed. 

18. It is suggested that newly introduced grasses should 
be thoroughly investigated in relation to the foot-rot 
problem before being recommended as forage crops.
