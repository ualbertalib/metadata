THE USE OE UREA AS A PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT 


FOR RUMINANTS 


D. 0. Hedlin 


INTRODUCTION 


To supply sufficient protein for growing and lactat- 
ing animals has been one of the major problems of the livestock 
producer. With the possible exception of leguminous crops, 
practically all of the common livestock feeds supply insuffi¬ 
cient protein to satisfy the needs for normal growth and high 
milk production. In the pas't, protein supplements have been 
of plant origin such as linseed meal or of animal origin such 
» as tankage. During the war the source and distribution of 
these supplemental feeds have been affected and scientists 
have sought substitutes that could be utilized during periods 
of shortages. 

The demand for explosives during the present war has 
resulted in the building of several plants for the manufacture 
of ammonia. Unless new uses for ammonia can be found these 
plants will have to be discarded after the war. Urea can 
readily be made in these plants and it is already known that 
urea has a place in the manufacture of synthetics and, as will 
be pointed out later, it has a possible use as a feed for 
ruminants.

Urea may be made synthetically from dry carbon 
dioxide (COg) and dry ammonia (NH 3 ) thus: 

C0 2 + NH 3 OO.NH 2 .QH 

+ NH 3 CO.lNE 2 .ONH 4 

- HgO 4 cO:(NH 2 ) 2 

If urea can be utilized by livestock it may prove to 
be an economical source of protein as well as a means of 
assisting in the conversion of wartime factories to peace-time 
needs. 

In the fall of 1943 the Consolidated Mining and 
Smelting Company of Trail, B.C. provided a fund to the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta to assist in a research project in which the 
possible value of urea as a protein supplement for ruminants 
could be investigated. The arrangement was that the Univer¬ 
sity should supply the experimental animals and conduct a 
feeding test for two winters. 

PREVIOUS LITERATURE 


Before going into detail with regard to the feeding 
trials conducted at the University of Alberta, a brief review 
will be given of urea feeding experiments that have been con¬ 
ducted at other institutions.

Feeding Trials 


Hart et al (3) mention in the introduction to some 
of their work that experiments involving the feeding of simple 
nitrogenous substances to ruminants were first carried out in 
Europe during the last war in an attempt to get around the 
shortage of usual sources of protein. They state, however, 
that the European experiments gave negative results, and they 
attributed this to the fact that the tests were only of short 
duration. Feeling that conclusive results could be obtained 
only by the use of long-term feeding experiments, they initi¬ 
ated several tests with this in mind. 

Their first experiment (3) was designed to test the 
effect of feeding different levels of urea and ammonium bicar¬ 
bonate on growth rate and meat quality of calves. 

Six grade Holstein heifers ranging in weight from 
250 lb. to 290 lb. were selected. A low protein basal ration 
(5.38$) was purposely designed as follows: 


Yellow corn. 20.0 

Ground timothy hay.47.5 

Starch . 24.0 

Molasses . 10.0 

Steamed bonemeal .. 2.0 

Salt . 1.0 

Cod liver oil . 0.5 


One calf received the basal ration and acted as the 
check, while another calf had the basal ration supplemented 
with casein as a means of comparing the value of urea and 
ammonium bicarbonate with casein as a source of protein. The

With the exception of No.1 the calves received the 
rations as shown above for a period of 20 weeks. The basal 
ration seems to have been enough for the maintenance of weight 
only. Eor 12 weeks the weight of calf No.l remained stationary, 
the appearance was listless and apathetic, the coat was staring 
and appetite was very poor, the whole day often being required 
for the consumption of the ration. At the end of 12 weeks, 

No.l was switched to the ration being fed to No.2 (1.4$ urea) 
at which time an almost phenomenal improvement took place in 
the calf’s condition. Within two days its appetite had improved, 
a more healthy appearance became apparent, a gain of 11 pounds 
was shown within one week, and gains continued to be excellent 
to the end of the feeding trial. In the final analysis, calves 
No.l, No.2, and No.6 were found to have made the best gains.

did not make such satisfactory* gains. They were subject to 
diuresis and showed some evidence of degeneration of the 
kidneys, indicating that the higher levels of feeding nitro¬ 
genous substances were not satisfactory. 

Later, these animals were slaughtered and analyses 
of the tissues of different cuts were made. These analyses 
showed no significant difference in the composition of the 
tissues from the urea-fed and casein-fed animals. 

This feeding trial shows definitely that calves can 
use the nitrogen of urea and ammonium bicarbonate for purposes 
of growth, While the experiment did not indicate a definite 
toxic level for these nitrogenous compounds, it was shown that, 
if more than 60 fo of the nitrogen of the ration was fed in the 
form of urea or ammonium bicarbonate, lesions would become 
apparent in the kidneys. 

Rupel et al (8) at Wisconsin compared the effect of 
urea and linseed meal on milk production and body weight when 
they were fed to lactating dairy cows during a full lactation 
period. Three lots of 15 cows each were used, three rations 
being fed as follows:

Results of this investigation, indicating the total

The authors state that the difference in milk pro¬ 
duction and gains in body weight were not statistically sig¬ 
nificant between lots receiving urea and linseed meal. The 
lot fed the basal ration was significantly lower than the lots 
fed urea and linseed meal, in both body weight and production 
of fat-corrected milk. 

These authors state that, with the price of corn and 
oats at $30.00 per ton, urea at $70.00, and linseed meal at 
$47.00, they realized a saving of $4.40 per ton of concentrate 
by the use of urea as compared with linseed meal. We may con¬ 
clude from this test that urea was equal to linseed meal in 
the production of milk and the maintenance of body weight and, 
.furthermore, that a substantial financial saving was made by 
its use. * 

Archibald {!), at the Massachusetts State College, 
used the following rations with 24 Holstein cows over a period 
of three years, to compare the value of standard protein sup¬ 
plements and urea as sources of protein for lactating cows. 

The rations are shown in Table II.

It may be noted that cornstarch was used to make up 
the loss in energy caused by omitting the protein concentrates 
included in the regular ration. In the urea ration the urea 
supplied 42$ of the nitrogen of the grain mixture or 25$ of 
the nitrogen of the total ration. 

The results of the experiment indicated that, in 
the production of fat-corrected milk, the length of lactation 
and dry periods, reproduction, and flavor of the milk produced, 
the differences between the groups on the "regular" and "urea" 
were not significant. The "control" ration, however, was found 
to be inadequate to support milk production at a normal level. 

Archibald sums up the results of this work as 
follows: "Results showed that considerable use was made of 

the urea, although it was not quite on a par for maintenance 
and milk production with the standard protein concentrates."

Wise et al (13) conducted a feeding trial in which 
lactating cows were fed a corn silage to which 10 pounds of 
urea per ton had been added during ensiling. Their results 
indicate that the urea-treated silage was not as palatable as 
the untreated. Cows receiving the urea-treated silage con¬ 
sumed 52.5 pounds per day, whereas those receiving the un¬ 
treated consumed 60 pounds per day. They noted that the caro¬ 
tene content of the silage was lowered from 36,58 micrograms 
per gram to 11.50 micrograms per gram by the addition of urea. 
This was reflected in a significantly lower carotene content 
of the milk from the urea-fed cows as compared with the con¬ 
trol group. However, Rupel et al (8) noted that the mixing 
of urea with a concentrate mixture fed to lactating cows did 
not affect the vitamin A content of the milk. Since Wise et 
al fed the same concentrate mixture to the groups receiving 
both urea-treated and untreated silage, there was no way of 
determining whether or not the nitrogen of the urea fed this 
way was utilized or not. Further research on the usefulness 
and palatability of urea-treated silage is indicated. 

Recently there have been some feeding trials carried 
out to test the value of ammoniated sugar beet pulp as a feed 
for ruminants. H. G. Millar (5) of the Quaker Oats Research 
Laboratories describes such an experiment. He prepared an 
ammoniated pulp by adding 15 pounds of ammonia to 300 pounds 
of pulp and revolving the mixture in a closed unit for 30 
minutes. Millar does not state why nitrogen in the form of 
ammonia was used, It is possible that the ammonia formed a

chemical combination with some component of the beet pulp. 

The final product contained 25 to 27$ protein 
(N x 6.25) and this could be mixed with plain pulp to produce 
a mixture of any desired protein content. Millar used calves 
to compare the growth-promoting qualities of a basal ration of 
7$ protein with various rations containing ammoniated beet 
pulp and having protein equivalent ranging from 12 to 17$. He 
found that a ration of 12$ protein was equal to one of 17$ 
with respect to growth, although growth was unsatisfactory 
with the basal ration. A ration in which toasted soybean meal 
was used to bring the protein content of the ration up to 
16.5$ was found to give the best growth. It was concluded 
that the nitrogen of ammoniated beet pulp can be used by 
ruminants for purposes of growth. Millar suggests that the 
soybean meal was superior to the ammoniated beet pulp because 
it contained more of the essential amino acids than did the 
protein synthesized from the ammonia. To correct this, it 
was suggested that a fairly large variety of feeds be used in 
conjunction with the ammoniated pulp to reduce the possibility 
of protein quality*s being a limiting factor. This seems to 
point to the fact that more research is needed with respect 
to the feeding of ammoniated pulp. 

Johnson at al (4) conducted metabolism experiments 
with sixteen growing lambs, to compare the biological utiliza¬ 
tion of the nitrogen from urea, soybean meal, and casein. 

They used a basal ration containing about 6$ protein and made 
up of corn and red top hay. The urea, soybean meal, and casein

were added to the basal to make up rations of different nitro¬ 
gen levels* It was found that the lambs made fairly satisfac¬ 
tory gains on a ration to which urea had been added to bring 
the protein level up to 12$, but that the addition of further 
amounts of urea did not improve the ration* They concluded 
that urea was utilized to a certain extent but that it was not 
converted rapidly enough to protein to meet the requirements 
of growing lambs* In general, the urea protein was as well 
utilized in metabolism as soybean protein, and somewhat better 
than casein protein. 

Harris and Mitchell (2) fed lambs a low protein 
basal ration that by itself could not maintain nitrogen equi¬ 
librium. To this ration they added urea to bring the protein 
content up to 11% (N x 6.25), the urea providing about 50$ of 
the nitrogen. They state that the urea ration was capable of 
promoting normal or nearly normal growth in lambs. 

The experiments reviewed here indicate that urea was 
fairly effectively utilized by ruminants up to a certain level. 
Higher levels did not seem to be so well utilized, possibly 
owing to a limited capacity to convert urea to protein. There 
is some evidence that sheep have a high requirement for sul¬ 
phur-containing amino acids because of their heavy growth of 
wool, and it may not be possible for the micro-organisms of the 
rumen to synthesize sulphur-containing amino acids. In general urea 
appears to be used as a substitute for standard protein supplements,

although it does not appear to he quite on a par with standard 
supplements for purposes of growth and milk production. 

Conversion of Urea 


There has naturally been a good deal of interest in 
the changes undergone by urea during its conversion to protein 
in the rumen. Using a fistulated heifer, Wegner et al (11) found 
that within one hour after the ingestion of a ration contain¬ 
ing urea, the urea had been converted to ammonia. Within four 
to six hours after ingestion the nitrogen of the ration was 
all in the form of protein nitrogen. 

By using the juices squeezed from the rumen contents 
of a cow, these workers were able to make an in vitro study of 
the conversion of urea to protein (10). Some of the urea- 
containing ration was mixed with this liquid, incubated at 
37°G. temperature and a carefully regulated pH, in order to 
simulate as nearly as possible the normal conditions encountered 
in the rumen. These in vitro studies yielded essentially the 
same results as did the in vivo studies with the fistulated 
heifer, in that urea was converted to ammonia nitrogen and this, 
in turn, was converted to protein nitrogen. It appears from 
this that the conversion of simple nitrogenous compounds to 
protein is effected by micro-organisms found in the rumen, and 
that these proteins are built up into the bodies of the micro¬ 
organisms. The bodies of these are then probably broken down

in the abomasum (true stomach) and later absorbed from the 
small intestine of the ruminant. 

Smith and Baker (9) in Scotland have given some 
study to the question of what micro-organisms are concerned 
with the conversion of urea to protein. Juices were taken 
from rumen contents and, by means of centrifuging, it was pos¬ 
sible to separate this juice into fractions one of which con¬ 
tained bacteria and the other protozoa. When feed containing 
urea was added to both fractions it was found that the bac¬ 
teria were able to convert the urea to protein, whereas the 
protozoa were unable to do so. After the bacteria had con¬ 
verted the urea they were precipitated, dried, and analyzed. 
This precipitate was found to be 36.3$ protein, 46.6$ poly¬ 
saccharide, 9.5$ fat, and 6.2$ ash, which corresponds quite 
closely to the analysis of common protein supplements such as 
linseed meal. Research in the quality of protein from such a 
precipitate would provide very valuable information with 
regard to the value and possible limitations of urea as a sub¬ 
stitute for common protein supplements. 

The effect of the level of protein in the ration on 
the conversion of urea to protein has been given some study. 
Wegner et al (12) at ?/isconsin fed rations with various pro¬ 
tein levels to a fistulated heifer. A basal concentrate 
mixture with 12$ protein was used. To this basal concentrate 
mixture various amounts of linseed meal or urea or both were 
added to increase the protein content of the ration as a whole.

When the ration contained 12$ of preformed protein, 
the urea nitrogen was converted to ammonia nitrogen within one 
hour after ingestion, and this in turn was converted to pro¬ 
tein nitrogen within four to six hours. When the protein con¬ 
tent ranged from 12 to 18$, the rate of conversion was lowered, 
although the extent of conversion was not. When protein was 
over 18$, both the rate and extent of conversion were lowered. 
Apparently urea is utilized to the maximum only when the pro¬ 
tein content of the ration is of moderate level. 

An experiment has been conducted by Mills et al (6) 
to ascertain the effect of starch on the conversion of urea. 

A fistulated heifer was given a ration of timothy hay aLone 
with urea added. The conversion of urea could not be demon¬ 
strated in this case and apparently the urea was not utilized. 

The heifer was then given the same ration, to which 
four pounds of starch were added daily. In this case it was 
found that the percentage of protein in the rumen contents was 
increased from 6.8$ to 10.7$, or an increase of 57$. Apparently 
urea can only be utilized at a maximum rate and efficiency in 
the presence of an adequate supply of readily fermentable car¬ 
bohydrate. 

These same workers also tested the effect of supply¬ 
ing carbohydrate in the form of molasses, but found that this 
did not stimulate the conversion of urea. They concluded that 
the molasses, being very soluble, passed out of the rumen 
before the other components of the ration and was therefore 
not available to supply energy to rumen bacteria that convert

urea to protein. In an in vitro experiment with rumen bacteria 
Pearson and Smith (7) found that starch was more effective in 
promoting the conversion of urea than any of glucose, glycerol, 
or lactic acid. This seems to indicate that some factor in 
addition to that postulated by Mills et al (6) may be respon¬ 
sible for the greater effectiveness of starch in promoting the 
conversion of urea. 

A brief review has been given, indicating that it is 
possible, by the symbiotic relationship of rumen bacteria, for 
ruminant animals to utilize urea as a protein supplement and 
satisfy their nutritive requirements to a certain extent. The 
mechanism whereby urea may be converted to protein has been 
given some study but further research is indicated. As has 
been shown, certain factors will influence the rate and extent 
of the conversion of urea to protein, such as the presence of 
starch and the level of protein in the ration. These factors 
need to be considered when rations containing urea are being 
designed. 

Considering that urea can undoubtedly be used to 
advantage in rations for ruminants it was felt that a trial to 
determine the value of urea as a substitute for protein sup¬ 
plements should be carried out under Alberta feeding conditions. 
Two experiments were conducted with lactating cows and two with 
pregnant ewes during the winters of 1945-4 and 1944-5, and are 
herein reported. These experiments were made possible by a 
grant from the Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of 
Canada, Limited.

OUTLINE OF FEEDING TRIAL WITH 
DAIRY COWS FOR 1943-4 


Plan of the Experiment 


Only four pairs of cows suitable for the experiment 
were available. It was possible to match the cows evenly for 
breed, milk flow, and stage of lactation, but it was not pos¬ 
sible to match them evenly for butterfat test. The cows were 
paired as follows:

so that odd-numbered cows were fed urea and even-numbered cows 
fed linseed meal. Two pairs of the cows were fed experimentally 
for 14 consecutive weeks and the other two pairs for 9 and 7 
weeks, respectively. One of each pair was fed the normal 
ration containing a sufficient quantity of the natural protein 
supplements, and the other cow of each pair a ration in which 
all of the linseed meal and a small part of the wheat bran were 
replaced by urea. In the urea ration enough carbonaceous con¬ 
centrates were added to give it practically the same percentage 
of total digestible nutrients as that of the linseed meal 
ration. The substitution of urea for linseed meal was made on 
the basis of nitrogen content.

It may be noted that the total milk production of 
cows fed linseed meal was only 0.80$ more than for the cows on 
the urea ration. The difference is so small that it may be 
considered as of no significance. During the period on trial 
there was a decline of 23.7$ in the total milk production of 
the cows on urea, whereas in the case of the linseed-meal-fed 
group there was a decline of 21.1$. Considering that only four 
pairs of cows were used and that there may have been some dif¬ 
ferences in the natural persistency of milk flow, this small 
difference in milk production or percentage decline cannot be 
attributed to differences in the rations. Apparently the urea 
ration was equal to the linseed meal ration with regard to 
maintaining milk flow. 

Percent Butterfat of the Milk 

Although the difference in total milk produced by the 
two groups of cows was slight, the average butterfat percentage 
of milk from the urea-fed cows was definitely lower than for 
the linseed-meal-fed cows. This may have been due to naturally 
higher testing cows having been allotted to the urea ration. ( 
It may be noted in Table VI that the initial fat percent for 
the cows fed urea was lower than that of the cows fed linseed 
meal. It may be significant that the Records of Performance 
for the previous year indicate that the urea-fed cows normally 
had a lower fat percent than the linseed-meal-fed cows.

It will be noted that there was a tendency for the 
fat percent of the milk from the urea-fed cows to drop more 
markedly than the fat percent of the milk from the linseed- 
meal-fed cows. For the first week the average fat percent of 
milk of the urea-fed cows was 3.4%, while that of the linseed- 
meal-fed cows was 3.8%. At the end of seven weeks the fat 
percent was 3.0% and 3.7%, respectively, indicating that there 
was a marked drop in the fat percent of milk from the urea-fed 
cows. 

The greater drop in percent fat by the urea-fed cows 
was reflected in a slight drop in the production of F.C.M*. for 
the urea-fed group, as shown in Table V. The urea-fed group 


















O' Cl *1 


J'ii -:f.Cr \ 'C . : • ■. 






22 


produced 10029.0 lb. of 4$ F.C.M. during the period of trial, 
whereas the linseed-meal-fed group produced a total of 
11035.7 lb., or 10.0$ more than the urea-fed group. During 
the period of the trial the urea-fed group showed a slightly 
more rapid decline in the production of F.G.M. than did the 
linseed-meal-fed group. In view of the small number of cows 
used, this difference is not considered to be significant. 

Changes in Body Weight 

Both groups of cows made similar gains in body weight 
the urea-fed cows gained a total of 123 lb. and the linseed- 
meal-fed cows gained 117 lb. For the maintenance of body 
weight the two rations appear to have been the same. 

Palatability of the Rations Compared 

There was evidence that the urea ration was not as 
palatable as the linseed meal ration when fed to dairy cows. 

The first two cows started on the urea ration (No.l 
and No.3) ate their ration very slowly as compared with No.2 
and No.4, receiving the linseed meal ration. Even after the 
urea of the grain mixture was reduced from 60 lb. to 49 lb. 
the cows continued to eat it very slowly. 

The fact that the urea grain mixture contained small 
pebbles of urea suggested that possibly the presence of these 
pebbles caused the mixture to be less palatable to the cows. 

The urea was therefore sifted through a fine screen immediately 
prior to its being mixed in the grain. This practice appeared

to improve the palatability of the urea ration to some extent, 
hut it was still not as palatable as the linseed meal ration. 

Cows No.5 and No.6 were put on the feeding trial 
five weeks after the other two pairs of cows were started. 

Cow No.5 received the urea ration and, while she did not eat 
it as readily as she had previously been eating the normal 
herd grain mixture supplied to the non-experimental animals 
in the barn, she always consumed her ration eventually. Cow 
No.6, fed the linseed meal ration, showed a good deal of 
reluctance with regard to eating the grain mixture provided. 
The only explanation of this seems to lie in the statement of 
the stable foreman that this individual animal had always been 
very discriminating with regard to her feed and that even a 
slight change tended to "put her off her feed". 

In the case of cows No.7 and No.8, No.8 was started 
on the urea ration. After five weeks on the urea ration she 
refused the grain mixture almost entirely and began to lose 
weight rapidly. Within five weeks her weight had dropped from 
848 lb. to 780 lb., or a drop of 68 lb. (8$), and her produc¬ 
tion dropped from 35 lb. of 6$ milk per day to 29.7 lb. of 
5.5$ milk. Her condition became what might be termed critical. 
It was found necessary, therefore, to switch cow No.8 to the 
linseed meal ration and put cow No.7 on the urea ration. After 
being switched to the linseed meal ration, cow No.8 showed an 
immediate improvement in general appearance, gained weight 
rapidly, and showed a slight gain in milk and fat production. 
Cow No.7 accepted the urea ration, but not as readily as she

had the linseed meal ration. The data for these two cows 
were considered only from the time when the change in the 
ration was made. It would appear from these experiences that 
urea may be sufficiently distasteful to some cows to lower the 
consumption of grain mixtures containing it below the require¬ 
ment level of the cow. 


Discussion 


The results of this feeding trial indicate that the 
use of urea as a substitute for standard protein supplements 
did not affect the total milk production of lactating dairy 
cows. This confirms experiments at Wisconsin (1) (8). On the 
other hand, the production of fat and fat-corrected milk were 
both markedly lowered. In other words, urea was not as effec¬ 
tive as linseed meal for the maintenance of fat and fat-corrected 
milk. In the results published by other workers no reduction 
in fat or F.O.M. caused by urea feeding was found. When it is 
considered that most of the cows used in this experiment were 
heavy producers and therefore needed to consume fairly large 
quantities of urea, it is possible that the quantities of urea 
in the urea ration were too large to be converted efficiently. 

With regard to the possible conversion of urea to 
protein by these cows, some data may be considered that may 
throw a little light on the question. The cows fed the lin¬ 
seed meal ration consumed 0.53 lb. daily, of which 0.11 lb. 

(Or 20$) was urea nitrogen. Even assuming a 100$ conversion

and assimilation of urea nitrogen, the urea-fed cows consumed 
only 7 % in excess of their requirements of digestible protein. 
These results indicate that some of the urea nitrogen must 
have been utilized since the remaining 0.44 lb. of nitrogen 
would not have been sufficient to meet the minimum requirements 
of the cows. 

It would appear from the results that the lower 
palatability of the urea rations will limit its commercial use 
unless some means of overcoming its unpalatability can be 
devised. It is possible that lower levels of urea in the 
grain mixture than were used in this feeding trial (49 lb. per 
ton) would give better results. 

Conclusions 


1. Urea was found to be utilized by lactating cows as 
a substitute for linseed meal. 

2. Milk production was not affected when urea was sub¬ 
stituted for linseed meal in the ration of lactating cows. 

3. Fat production may have been affected by the feed¬ 
ing of urea, but additional data are needed to verify this. 

4. Considerable evidence was obtained indicating that 
urea as fed in this experiment was unpalatable to some of the 
cows, and resulted in their failure to consume their grain 
allowance readily.

OUTLINE OF FEEDING TRIAL WITH 
DAIRY COWS FOR 1944-5 


The data obtained in the 1943-4 feeding trial were 
considered insufficient to provide conclusive evidence for 
determining the effect of substituting urea for linseed meal 
as a protein supplement for lactating cows. It was therefore 
deemed advisable to conduct a second trial, in an attempt to 
throw more light on the question of palatability of urea- 
containing mixtures and also their possible effect on the 
butterfat percent of lactating cows, as well as securing more 
data on the effect of urea on'milk production. Consequently, 
in the fall of 1944, an experiment was again designed to 
determine the effect of urea as a protein supplement on the 
body weight, milk and fat production of lactating cows. 

Plan of the Experiment 


A total of fourteen cows were used in this feeding 
trial, of which all were Holsteins except numbers 10, 11, and 
12, which were Lerseys. Three rations were fed, differing 
only in the kind of protein supplement used in the grain mix¬ 
ture. These rations will be designated as follows: 

1. Urea ration 

2. Linseed meal and urea ration 

3. Linseed meal ration.

In the urea ration all the linseed meal was replaced 
by urea and carbonaceous grains, while in the urea + linseed 
meal ration half the linseed meal was replaced in this way.

The values of total digestible nutrients (TDN) were 
taken from Morrison’s Feeding Standards and the values for 
N, $ were determined by analysis. In the urea ration and urea 
+ linseed meal ration enough carbonaceous concentrates were 
added to give them practically the same percentage of' T.D.N. 
as the linseed meal ration. The substitution of urea for 
linseed meal was made on the basis of nitrogen content. 

The cows were supplied with as much hay and oat 
silage as they would readily consume. The hay was of medium 
quality and consisted of a mixture of timothy and oat hay, 
and the silage, made of green cut oats, was of excellent 
quality. 

The composition of these roughages is as follows, 
the T.D.N. being based on Morrison’s Feeding Standards:

The protein equivalent was taken as N x 6.25. 

The cows were allotted to the different rations for 
different periods of time as shown in Table VIII. The num¬ 
bers under the rations fed refer to individual cows.

* Refused grain mixture and was removed from the experiment. 

+ Refused the urea mixture and was transferred to the lin¬ 
seed meal + meal mixture. 


It may be noted that five sets each containing 
either 2 or 3 cows were used. When placed on the trial, the 
cows of each set were equal as far as possible with respect 
to breed, stage of lactation, milk flow, and body weight. 

The cows were weighed each week and a continuous 
record was kept of the milk production and fat percent. 

Using these data, cows were fed in accordance with their 
requirements, as stated by Morrison.

Results 


It was assumed in this experiment, as in the pre¬ 
vious experiment, that the comparative values of the different 
protein supplements would be indicated by differences in per¬ 
formance of the three groups in the following respects: 

1. Quantity of milk produced. 

2. Production of fat and fat-corrected milk (F.C.M.). 

3. Changes in body weight. 

4. Palatability of the rations. 

In this experiment it was possible to make compari¬ 
sons of the three rations: 

1. Urea ration vs linseed meal ration. 

2. Urea ration vs linseed meal + urea ration. 

3. Linseed meal + urea ration vs linseed meal 
ration. 

Comparisons for these groups are made in the tables 
IX, X, and XI, indicating production performance.

Quantity of Milk Produced 

Urea ration vs linseed meal ration 

In comparing linseed meal (Group 1) with, urea 
(Group 2) it may be noted that the linseed-meal-fed group 
produced 1.31$ more milk than did the urea-fed group. 

This greater amount of milk was due in part to the fact 
that the cows on the linseed meal ration were producing 
5.77$ more milk than those on the urea ration when the 
experiment started. This initial advantage does not appear 
to have been maintained since the cows on the linseed 
meal ration declined more rapidly in milk flow than did 
the cows on the urea ration. The average percent decline 
per week was 2.84$ for the linseed-meal-fed group and 
1.43$ for the urea-fed group. It would appear, there¬ 
fore, that urea was equal to linseed meal for purposes 
of maintaining the production of milk in lactating cows. 

Urea ration vs linseed meal + urea ration 

A similar comparison may be made between the 
urea ration and the linseed meal + urea ration. In this 
case, the urea-fed group produced 2,83$ more milk than 
did the urea + linseed-meal-fed group. The initial pro¬ 
duction in the case of the urea-fed group was 2.39$ more 
than for the urea + linseed-meal-fed group, and the 
average percent decline per week was 0.86$ for the urea- 
fed group and 1.02$ for the urea + linseed-meal-fed group.

There does not appear to be any difference between the 
urea ration and the linseed meal + urea ration from the 
standpoint of the maintenance of milk production. 

Linseed meal ration vs urea + linseed meal ration 

In this case the cows fed linseed meal produced 
a total of 2.98$ more milk than the cows fed the urea + 
linseed meal ration. Here again the greater amount of 
milk was due in part to the fact that the cows on the 
linseed meal ration were producing 6.1$ more milk than 
the cows on the urea + linseed meal ration when the experi¬ 
ment started. This initial advantage does not appear to 
have been fully maintained during the trial since the 
decline in milk flow was 1.85$ per week for the linseed- 
meal-fed group and 1.09$ per week for the urea + linseed- 
meal-fed group. It would therefore appear that the urea + 
linseed meal ration was fully as effective as the linseed 
meal ration with regard to maintaining the level of milk 
production in lactating cows. 

In general, it appears that the substitution of 
urea for all or part of the linseed meal in the grain 
mixtures fed to lactating cows had no discernible effect 
on the milk production of cows. 

Production of Fat and F.G.M. 

It will be noted in the tables for production per¬ 
formance for the various groups that the differences in the

average fat percent of milk for the different groups were so 
slight that they may be considered as negligible. As a result 
of this similarity in average fat test for the comparable 
groups the F.C.M. comparisons have the same relationship as 
do the comparisons for total milk produced. 

In general, it appears that the substitution of urea 
for all or part of the linseed meal in the grain mixture did 
not affect the fat production or production on the basis of 
F.C.M. 

Changes in Body Weight 

There did not appear to be any significant differ¬ 
ence in average gain or loss in live weight of the cows in the 
different comparable groups, indicating that the rations con¬ 
taining urea were on a par with rations containing linseed 
meal, as far as the maintenance of live weight was concerned. 

Palatability of the Rations 

As was the case in the previous experiment, trouble 
was encountered with palatability of the grain mixtures con¬ 
taining urea. This trouble was encountered in spite of the 
fact that precautions were taken in this experiment that had 
not been taken in the previous experiment. The urea used in 
the second trial differed from that used in the first trial in 
that it was ground up to a very fine powder and treated so 
that no caking or lumping took place. It was possible, there¬ 
fore, to obtain a thorough mixing of the urea in the grain

mixtures. This latter fact was demonstrated when five random 
samples were drawn from a one-ton lot of grain mixture con¬ 
taining 40 lb 0 of urea. Duplicate nitrogen analyses were run 
on these samples. It was found that the percent nitrogen 
varied from 2.81 to 2.84. This indicates that the urea was 
thoroughly and uniformly mixed with the grain. 

The percentage of urea used in the grain mixtures 
was reduced from what had been used the former year. In the 
1943-4 feeding trial levels of urea as high as 3 fo had been 
mixed with the grain. In the 1944-5 trial the urea mixture 
contained 2Ffo urea, whereas the urea + linseed meal mixture 
contained only 1 % urea. 

In spite of these precautions the grain mixtures 
containing urea were always consumed more slowly by the cows 
than were grain mixtures in which the protein supplement was 
all in the form of linseed meal. In two cases cows refused 
urea mixtures entirely and had to be removed from the experi¬ 
ment. Gow No.6, fed the urea + linseed meal mixture, con¬ 
sumed it fairly well for two weeks and then refused it. This 
cow was then fed the linseed meal ration for two days and 
consumed it readily. The urea + linseed meal ration was then 
offered but was refused. Two days later this ration was again 
tried and again refused, at which time the cow was removed 
from the experiment. A similar experience was encountered 
with cow No.12 after the cow had been fed the urea ration for 
one week. This cow was also removed from the experiment. Gow 
No.10 refused the urea ration at the end of one week but, when

transferred to the urea + linseed meal ration, consumed what 
was offered, albeit rather reluctantly* 

The palatability of the mixtures containing urea, 
when fed under conditions of this trial, was found to be a 
serious problem. 

Discussion 


The 1944-5 feeding trial conducted at the University 
of Alberta indicates that, from the standpoint of maintaining 
the production of milk in lactating cows, urea used as a pro¬ 
tein supplement was on a par with linseed meal. These results 
confirm the results of the first trial conducted at the 
University of Alberta. 

Fat percent was not affected by the use of urea as 
a protein supplement. This confirms the results of other 
workers (1) (8). 

Palatability again proved to be a serious problem in 
spite of the fact that the percentage of urea in the grain 
mixtures had been reduced. In the topic, "Previous Literature" 
in this thesis, several tests were referred to in which urea 
mixed with grains was fed to lactating cows and to growing 
calves (1) (3) (8). In no case was any difficulty with pala¬ 
tability recorded. However, in one case (13) in which urea 
was mixed with silage, some difficulty with palatability was 
encountered. The experiment conducted at the University of

Alberta seems to be the only one to date indicating that urea 
included in a grain mixture is unpalatable to lactating cows. 
It is possible that the kinds of grain used in the feeding 
trial at the University of Alberta may have had some influence 
on the palatability. For example, in trials carried out at 
other stations, corn, hominy, molasses, and other feeds not 
common to Alberta were used in the grain mixtures. It is 
possible that the taste of the urea was more effectively 
masked by some of these ingredients, than it was in the grain 
rations used in this trial. 

Further work is needed in order to study ways and 
means of overcoming the lack of palatability of rations con¬ 
taining urea. 


Conclusions 


1. In this second trial urea used as a protein supple¬ 
ment for lactating cows proved to be on a par with linseed meal 
from the standpoint of the production of milk, fat, and F.C.M., 
and for the maintenance of body weight. 

2. Lack of palatability of urea-containing grain mix¬ 
tures still proved to be a serious problem. 

3. Further research to discover ways and means of making 
urea-containing grain mixtures more palatable to cows is indi¬ 


cated

CONCLUSIONS FROM 1943-4-5 FEEDING 
TRIALS FOR COWS 


1. The work at the University of Alberta has shown 
that urea mixed with grains up to the level of 40 lb. per ton 
(2 °/o) and substituted for linseed meal on an equal nitrogen 
basis is as effective as linseed meal for purposes of main¬ 
taining the production of milk, F.C.M., and body weight. 

2. Urea was found to be unpalatable to some cows when 
included in the grain mixture even at levels as low as 1$. 

The question of the palatability of urea rations is a problem 
that merits further study. Only when some solution is found 
to this problem can the commercial use of urea in dairy feeds 
be recommended.

FEEDING OF UREA AS A PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT 
TO PREGNANT EWES, 1943-1944 


It has been shown as a result of feeding trials at 
the University of Alberta (Exp. 147, unpublished) that preg¬ 
nant ewes require a fair proportion of protein in their ration. 
This protein can be satisfactorily supplied either in the form 
of a good legume hay or in the form of a supplement such as 
linseed meal, in cases where only low protein carbonaceous 
hays are available. The addition of one-half pound of grain 
daily to a ration of carbonaceous hay was found helpful, 
although even further improvement was effected if the same 
amount of a concentrate mixture of 2/5 grain and 1/3 linseed 
meal was provided. This last ration gave the best results 
with respect to maintenance of live weight of the ewes, as 
well as birth weight and general vitality of the lambs at the 
time of birth. 

As has already been indicated in the review at the 
beginning of this thesis, sheep are capable of utilizing urea 
nitrogen. For this reason it was felt that an experiment 
should be conducted to ascertain the effectiveness of urea 
when substituted for linseed meal on the basis of nitrogen 
content, and with sufficient carbonaceous grains added to 
replace the T.D.N. of the linseed meal.

Plan of the Experiment 


Three rations were used in this experiment: a basal 
ration of carbonaceous hays and grain; a similar ration except 
that linseed meal was included with the grains; and a ration 
containing urea as a substitute for linseed meal. The follow¬ 
ing proportions of feeds were used in the grain mixtures for 
the various rations:

+ Determined by analysis. 

The nitrogen content of the hays, which were of fair 
quality, was 1,09$ and .75$ for the oat hay and prairie hay 
respectively. 

The three lots were allowed continual access to com¬ 
mon salt containing 0.25$ potassium iodide and 0.025$ cobalt 
chloride. 


Three lots of seventeen ewes, similar with respect 
to breed, age, and weight, were started on the feeding trial 
in November, 1945. The average of weights obtained on three 
consecutive days was taken as the initial weight for each ewe 
and the ewes were weighed individually every two weeks in 
order that their progress could be checked as the experiment 
proceeded. The ewes were bred immediately after being placed 
on the experiment. The final recorded weight of the ewes 
prior to lambing was taken as the pre-lambing weight. The

post-lambing weight was obtained by weighing each ewe within 
eight hours after lambing.

With regard to differences in gains between the 
initial and pre-lambing weights Group 2 on the urea ration 
made an average gain of 42.62 lb., whereas Group 3, fed the 
linseed meal ration, made an average gain of 50.22 lb. As 
the minimum significant difference was 6.80 lb., it may be

45 


seen that the group on the urea ration made significantly 
lower gains than did Group 3. Since the pre-lambing weight 
is not considered to be a good criterion of the welfare of the 
ewe, not very much importance is attached to this latter fact. 
On the basal ration the gain between the initial and pre-lamb¬ 
ing weight averaged 45.94 lb., a figure which did not differ 
significantly from those of either the urea or linseed meal 
rations. 

Regarding differences between initial and post¬ 
lambing weights, Groups 2 and 3 made average gains of 21.26 lb. 
and 20.25 lb., respectively, whereas Group 1 (basal) made an 
average gain of 10.32 lb. The minimum significant difference 
in this case was 7.52 lb. It may be seen, therefore, that 
from the standpoint of producing and maintaining gains’in body 
weight up until immediately after lambing, the urea and the 
linseed meal rations were equal to each other and superior to 
the basal ration. 

It would seem logical to place a greater value on 
the gains made by the ewes between the start of the experiment 
and immediately after lambing, as the weights taken at these 
times represent the weights of "open" ewes, and gains that 
take place indicate gains in body tissues. 

There was very little difference in the number of 
lambs produced by the ewes fed the different rations. Groups 
1, 2, and 3 produced 28, 28, and 31 lambs, respectively. Gon-

sidering that a ewe may produce from one to three lambs at 
birth, these differences in the number of lambs produced by 
the different groups may be neglected. 

In considering the birth weight of the lambs it must 
be borne in mind that single lambs tend to weigh more at 
birth than do individual twin lambs, and that male lambs tend 
to weigh slightly more at birth than do female lambs. The 
average weight of these different classes of lambs is there¬ 
fore given in the following table:

While the number of lambs in the different groups is 
too low to provide representative averages, the tendency 
appeared to be for the ewes in the groups fed the urea and

linseed meal rations to produce heavier lambs. No explanation 
can be given to account for the low average weight (7.92 lb.) 
of the twin female lambs of the ewes fed the linseed meal 
ration. In previous trials at the University of Alberta it 
has been found that the use of linseed meal in the grain 
mixtures fed to pregnant ewes tended to increase the weight of 
the lambs dropped by these ewes, as compared with the weight 
of lambs from ewes fed grain without linseed meal. 

In general, the results of the 1943-4 feeding trial 
with pregnant ewes do not allow for definite conclusions to 
be drawn with regard to the effect of the different rations fed 
to pregnant ewes on the birth weight of their lambs. 

At the time of birth the live lambs were classified 
as weak, fairly strong, and strong, having reference mainly to 
the vitality of the lambs. These results are tabulated by

97$ of their lambs classified as either strong or fairly 
strong, whereas the corresponding figures for the urea and 
basal rations were 89$ and 75$, respectively. There seems to 
be some indication that, from the standpoint of vitality of 
the lambs, linseed meal, when used as a protein supplement for 
pregnant ewes, was superior to urea and that urea in turn was 
superior to a ration which had no protein supplement. 

The lambs produced during this experiment v/ere 
dropped during the latter part of March and the early part of 
April, 1944, The percentage of lambs surviving on June 1st 
was 83 for urea-fed ewes, 75 for linseed-meal-fed ewes, and 
65 for ewes on the basal ration. Considering that the feeding 
of the experimental rations to the ewes was discontinued at 
the time of lambing, it is not possible to attach much impor¬ 
tance to these figures, although they do give a slight indica¬ 
tion that the urea ration may cause ewes to produce more 
vigorous lambs than a low protein basal ration. 

Falatability 

The one-half pound of grain mixture fed daily was 
always consumed readily and no trouble was encountered with 
palatability of any of the rations. 

Conclusions 


In general it may be said that the feeding of urea

as a protein supplement to pregnant ewes proved beneficial in 
maintaining the live weight of the ewes. There appeared to be 
a tendency for the inclusion of urea in a low protein grain 
mixture to increase the birth weight of the lambs and reduce 
mortality slightly. 

This first trial did not provide sufficient data and 
further work is required. 

\ FEEDING UREA AS A BROTEIN SUPPLEMENT 
TO PREGNANT EWES, 1944-5 


It was recommended as a result of the 1943-4 feed¬ 
ing trial that a further test should be conducted to confirm 
and, if possible, add to the information obtained. Consequently 
another feeding trial was initiated at the University of Alberta 
in the fall of 1944. 

Plan of the Experiment 


Four rations were used in this experiment: a basal 
ration of carbonaceous hays and grain; a similar ration except 
that linseed meal was included with the grains; a ration in 
which one-half of the linseed meal was replaced by urea on an 
equal nitrogen basis; and a ration in which all the linseed 
meal was replaced by urea. The following proportions of feeds 
were used in the grain mixtures for the various rations:

The experiment started with four lots of twenty 
ewes, each similar with respect to breed, age, and weight. 
However, in the final analysis only the following numbers of 
ewes were considered: 

Lot 1-14 
" 2-18 
” 3-16 

" 4-16 

This reduction in numbers was due to some ewes fail¬ 
ing to prove in lamb and to some failing to prove in season. 

The initial weight of the ewes was found by averag¬ 
ing the weights of the ewes for three consecutive days. The 
ewes were weighed every two weeks in order that their progress 
could be checked as the experiment proceeded. The ewes were 
bred immediately after being placed on the experiment. The 
weights recorded immediately prior to and within 8 hours after 
lambing were taken as the pre-lambing and post-lambing weights. 

Results 


When the gains in weight for the various groups are 
considered in conjunction with the corresponding minimum sig¬ 
nificant difference, it will be noted in Table XVII that the 
performance of the different groups with regard to gains in 
body weight is the same in all cases.

It appears from the results that the adding of pro¬ 
tein supplements to the grain mixtures fed to pregnant ewes 
did not maintain the ewes in any better condition of flesh 
than did the basal ration of carbonaceous roughage and grain. 
These results contrast with those of the previous experiment 
in which, on the basis of the post-lambing weight, the basal 
ration was found to be inferior to both the urea and the lin¬ 
seed meal rations. This may be due in part to the fact that 
the ewes that went on to the 1944-5 feeding trial were in 
better condition at the start of the trial than were the ewes 
that went on to the 1943-4 feeding trial. It would be expected

that ewes in a high condition of flesh would give a poorer 
indication of the comparative values of low and high protein 
rations than would ewes in poor condition. 

The difference in the number of lambs produced by 
the ewes fed the different rations was not considered to be 
significant. When we consider that each ewe may drop from one 
to three lambs, differences in the average number of lambs 
dropped per ewe, when only about 18 ewes per group are used, 
have to be very marked before they can be considered signifi¬ 
cant. Figures for the average number of lambs per ewe for the 
different groups are given in Table XVII. 

These figures cannot be taken to indicate that any 
one ration is superior to any other ration with regard to the 
number of lambs produced at birth. 

The average birth weight of the lambs was again cal¬ 
culated for twin male, twin female, single male, and single 
female, and these weights for the different classes of lambs 
are given in Table XVIII.

The birth weights of a few of the lambs have been 
omitted in Table XVIII. These lambs had birth weights that 
were so low that it was felt that some factor other than the 
ration fed had influenced the birth weight. 

There was considerable variation in the average lamb 
weights for the various groups. Numbers again were too small 
to establish representative averages. There was a tendency 
for the groups receiving a protein supplement to produce 
heavier lambs, except in the case of the twin lambs dropped 
by the urea-fed ewes as well as the female twin lambs dropped 
by the urea + linseed-meal- and the linseed-meal-fed ewes. 

The inconclusive results obtained in the second 
trial may likewise be due to the more favorable feed conditions 
that prevailed prior to the experiment, which would tend to 
fortify the ewes against any deficiency which may have charac¬ 
terized the basal ration. 

In general, the average birth weight of the lambs in 
the 1944-5 feeding trial does not allow for conclusions to be 
drawn with regard to the effect of the different rations fed 
to pregnant ewes, on the birth weight of the lambs. 

At the time of birth the live lambs v/ere classified 
as weak, fairly strong, and strong, having reference to the 
vitality of the lambs. These results are tabulated by per¬ 
centages in Table XIX.

Here again the differences as shown in this table 
are not very marked, especially when we consider the total 
percentage of lambs classified as fairly strong and strong. 

There does not appear to be anything in these results to 
indicate that the vitality of the lambs was affected by any 
of the protein supplements fed to the ewes. 

Palatability 

The various grain mixtures fed to the ewes were 
always consumed readily and no trouble was encountered from lack of 
palatability. 


Conclusions 


In general it may be said that negative results 
were obtained in the 1944-5 feeding trial with pregnant ewes.

The feeding of protein supplements, whether in the form of 
linseed meal, urea, or both, did not affect the gains in body 
weight of the ewes or the weight or vitality of the lambs 
dropped by the ewes. 

These results may also indicate that there is little 
or no need to add protein supplements to the ration of preg¬ 
nant ewes when ewes commence pregnancy in a well nourished 
and vigorous condition. * 

CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE USE OF UREA AS A 
PROTEIN SUPPLEMENT FOR RUMINANTS 


The foregoing trials indicate that urea may be 
satisfactorily utilized by lactating cows as a protein sup¬ 
plement for the production of milk. 

The problem of the lack of palatability of urea, 
when used in concentrate mixtures for cows, was not solved 
during these trials. Before urea can be recommended as a 
suitable dairy feed, ways and means must be found to overcome 
the lack of palatability. 

Results of the feeding trials with pregnant ewes 
were not conclusive. It was not established that the inclu¬ 
sion of urea in grain mixtures fed to pregnant ewes was of any 
particular value if the ewes enter pregnancy in a thrifty con¬ 
dition of flesh, although some evidence pointed to the fact

that ewes entering pregnancy in an unthrifty condition would 
benefit by the inclusion of urea in their rations. 

It is possible that growing lambs, which have a 
higher protein requirement than pregnant ewes, may give more 
favorable results if subjected to a urea feeding trial.
