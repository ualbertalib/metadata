STUDIES OF PEROSIS IN (GROWING CHICKS 


By James Edwin Price. 


INTRODUCTION 

Perosis, a leg disorder of growing chicks, has recently 
become the cause of a considerable loss to poultry producers. 

The loss appears to be greatest under intensive methods of 
brooding in battery brooders. In experimental work the develop¬ 
ment of this disorder in a severe form interferes with the 
results obtained in feeding tests. As the cause, or causes, 
of this disorder are not definitely established, nor the 
mechanism by which it develops fully understood, this study 
was undertaken to make a contribution to the knowledge on 
this subject. In vie?/ of the varying incidence of perosis 
reported by producers throughout the Province, using standard 
chick rations, it was thought advisable also to test these 
rations as to their suitability for raising chicks under the 
varying conditions encountered. 

SYMPTOMS OF PEROSIS 

Payne (17) is one of the first workers to describe the 
symptoms of a leg disorder in young growing chicks, known at 
that time under the various names, leg-weakness, rickets, 
enlarged hock joint, slipped tendon and malformed leg bones.

According to this worker, in chickens between the ages of 
3 to 6 weeks the hocks become enlarged, due probably to 
oedema and slight hemorrhages in the tissues surrounding 
the joints. The gastrocnemius tendon which extends the 
foot and flexes the leg, occasionally slips from the con¬ 
dyles which hold it in place. This may be responsible 
for the stiffening and malposition of the legs below the 
hock joint, found in advanced cases. Either the femur, 
or the tibia, or both, may become enlarged or develop marked 
curvature. One or both legs may be involved. The legs 
may be bowed in or out, or become deformed into unusual 
shapes. 

Doyle (3) considers n slipped tendon” to be essential¬ 
ly a bending or torsion of the bones which form the hock 
joint, with a consequent displacement of the Achilles tendon. 
He also considers the presence of whitish-grey tumorous 
masses in and along the bones, very frequently in the vis¬ 
ceral organs and sometimes in the skeletal muscles, to be 
characteristic of this disease. 

Hunter and Funk (9), from examination of the legs of 
affected birds, report enlargement of the hocks and a slip¬ 
ping of the gastrocnemius tendon from its normal position 
in the groove back of the leg to a new position at the side 
of the joint. In dissection studies they find that after 
the tendon has slipped it proliferates around the joint and 
strengthens it, but leaves the leg in a permanently deformed 
condition.

Titus (23) sets out very clearly his observations on 
perosis. According to this worker, the first noticeable 
symptom is a tendency for the chicks to rest for long periods 
of time in a squatting position. At this time a slight 
puffiness of the tibio-metatarsal joint may be observed on 
careful examination. In the next few days there is pro¬ 
nounced enlargement and, in some cases, discoloration, due 
to hemorrhages in the underlying tissues. These symptoms 
may occur any time after the third week up to the seventh 
week and may be only temporary, the birds recovering so that 
scarcely any noticeable permanent deformity results. If 
these symptoms do not subside the tibiae and tarso-metatarsi 
exhibit a slight bending which is readily apparent when the 
legs of the chicks are X-rayed. Gross deformity results from 
a continued curving of these bones. Titus refers to this 
stage as "deformed leg bones”. Frequently the articular 
cartilage at the distal end of the tibia slips slightly from 
its normal position and this in turn appears to cause the 
main tendons to slip from their condyles leaving the joint 
permanently disabled. The curvature of the diaphysis of the 
tibia may be so great at the distal end that the tendon 
slips, even though the articular cartilage has not been dis¬ 
placed. Titus refers to this stage as "slipped tendon". 

Milby (14) has presented his observations on the symp¬ 
toms in this disorder affecting the tibio-metarsal (hock) 
joint. In chicks two to ten weeks of age, he states the 
first noticeable symptom is usually a slight puffiness about 



01

it 


Ou

the hock joint. At this time the tibia is usually straight 
but the metatarsus may be slightly bowed. In some cases 
the gastrocnemius tendon slips from the condyles to one 
side or the other. Some chicks recover and in these cases 
the hocks apparently return to normal. In other cases the 
hocks become flattened laterally and the legs are bowed. 
Frequently the chick is no longer able to stand but rests 
on its hocks with the feet extended to the front or side. 
Affected chicks usually act as if standing were painful to 
them. The tibia and metatarsus become bent. The epiphysis 
at the distal end of the tibia is always bent laterally in 
the direction in which the tendon slips, and the extent of 
the bending appears to be roughly proportional to th© severity 
of the deformity. Bending of the distal end of the tibia 
has not been observed in chicks not afflicted with slipped 
tendon and Milby considers it probable that the bending is 
the result and not the cause of the displacement of the 
tendon. 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

Only in recent years has perosis been accepted as a 
distinct disorder. Previously it was confused with rickets 
and grouped along with other leg disorders as "leg weakness". 
The normal ash content of the leg bones of chiGks with perosis, 

S'eve r> <3 L 

as reported by^(6) (8) (14), indicates that at least one of 
the findings in this disorder is not characteristic of rickets 
or osteoporosis. Titus (23) as a result of gross osteological 









- 5 - 

examination concluded that the similarity between perosis 
and rickets was more apparent than real. Milby (14) al¬ 
though agreeing that perosis is a distinct disorder, con¬ 
siders that the bending of the bone^indieates that gross 
bone anatomy has been disturbed in some way and that the 
relationship of slipped tendon to rickets is by no means 
settled. 

Doyle (3) divides n leg weakness” in chicks into three 
groups on the basis of tissues affected: 

(1) Diseases affecting the bones, 

(2) Diseases affecting the nervous system, 

(3) Conditions affecting the muscles and tendons. 

He places slipped tendon in group (1) as being essentially 
a bending or torsion of the leg bones which form the hock 
joint, with a consequent displacement of the Achilles tendon. 

Payne (17), as a result of observations made, considers 
that the trouble is not confined to any group of conditions. 

It may be found in slow and rapid growing chicks, with mash 
or grain and mash rations, on wire or on board runways. The 
author also considers that the disorder will develop in chicks 
on rations having a high or a low mineral level. 

Herner and Robinson (6) describe a condition produced 
in chicks on a ration high in meat scrap and containing 
adequate vitamin D. They record the following symptoms: 
digestive disorders followed by thick hocks, short shanks, 
bow-legs, twisted legs, and slipped tendon, and conclude that 
these conditions are produced by a high level of minerals 
in the ration. Chemical analysis revealed no abnormality in 










- 6 - 

the ash, calcium or phosphorus content of the leg bones of 
affected birds, and the authors conclude the malformation 
is non-rachitic. 

Holmes, Pigott and Moore (8) find no significant 
difference in the mineral content or size of tibia from 
"slipped tendon" and from normal chicks on the same ration, 
comparisons being made at three, six and nine weeks of age. 
They present evidence which indicates that excessive mineral 
feeding is a factor in increasing the percentage of slipped 
tendon. 

Hall and King (4) also find that the deformity in 
"slipped tendon" is not due to abnormal composition or 
structure of the leg bones. Prom a histological and chemical 
examination the bones appear to be normal. By X-ray the 
only abnormal findings are subluxation, bowing and rotation. 

Schaible, Moore and Conolly (19) produced perosis by 
feeding high levels of minerals supplied from bone meal, 
bone ash, Ga^PO^g, MgCOg, or a mixture of CaGOg, NagHPC^ 
and KH2PO4. Additions of 5$ oyster shell or 4$ NagHP04 to 
the basal ration did not produce perosis. Variation in the 
acid-base balance, in the Ga:P ratio, and in the source of 
protein supplement of a high mineral ration, was found to 
influence the incidence of perosis. Soy bean oil meal, com¬ 
prising 10$ of the protein of a high mineral ration, was 
found to have a highly protective effect. No difference in 
susceptibility was found in birds of different sizes. How¬ 
ever, males were found to be more susceptible than females.

Henderson (5) suggests that the malformation in the 
leg bones of chicks raised in battery brooders, which he 
designates as "rickets", and which occurred in the presence 
of adequate vitamin D, is probably due to excess calcium or 
phosphorus, or both, in the ration. He found that when 
calcium and phosphorus each exceeded 1.8 fo of the total ration, 
a high percentage of deformities and retarded growth resulted. 
Egg yolk and chicken fat failed to prevent the development of 
the deformity. 

Payne, Hughes and Leinhardt (18) conclude, as a result 
of histopathological study of the organs and tissues, and a 
chemical analysis of the blood and leg bones, that the condi¬ 
tion known as "slipped tendon" is of an anatomical rather than 
histological nature. Excessive amounts of calcium or phosphorus, 
or both, in the ration are considered important etiological 
factors in the production of slipped tendon. The authors also 
find that a mineral mixture of c.p. CagfPC^)^ an & CaCOg pro¬ 
duce the same deformities as an equivalent amount of steamed 
bone meal. With regard to the actual mechanism by which the 
deformity is produced, the authors are of the opinion that, 
due to the failure of the tendon to keep pace with the increase 
in length of the leg bones, it slips from its normal position 
in the hock joint and pulls the leg around, resulting in a 
deformed condition. 

Heller, Zimmerman and Thompson (7) state that skiagrams 
of bones of chicks with slipped tendon show a faulty bone 
formation which is not cured by vitamin D but is cured by a 
correction of the level of phosphorus in the ration. They

consider attempts to correlate inorganic phosphorus of the 
blood with incidence of slipped tendon to be of little 
value due to the relatively large proportion of serum 
phosphorus in organic combination. 

Wilcke (24) (cited by Milby (14) ) found no significant 
difference in the plasma calcium, inorganic phosphorus, and 
ash determinations made on chicks with slipped tendon and on 
apparently normal chicks from the same pen. With a limited 
number of chicks there was no difference in the incidence 
of slipped tendon as the Ca:P ratio of the ration was varied, 
(1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) providing the level of phosphorus remained 
unchanged (P. z .624$). However, when the level of phosphorus 
was increased to 1.22$ with a Ca:P ratio of 1.18:1 there was 
a marked increase in the percentage of slipped tendon. 

Insko, Sowell and Lyons (11) outline the stages in which 
they consider slipped tendon develops: 

(1) Enlargement of the hock joint and discoloration 
due to hemorrhage in the underlying tissue. 

(2) Curvature of the tarso-metatarsi and tibiae. 

(3) Slipping of the gastrocnemius tendon from the 
articular cartilage. 

They consider the level of phosphorus in the ration to 
be an important precursor of slipped tendon. As the bone meal 
content of the ration was increased, with an accompanying 
increase in phosphorus (Ca:P ratio remaining approximately the 
same) there was a decided increase in the percentage of 
slipped tendon. A widening of the Ca:P ratio from 0.4:1 to 
3:1 by the addition of calcium to the ration did not increase 








( 9 ) 


the percentage of slipped tendon although there was a notice¬ 
able decrease in the average weight of the chicks at ten 
weeks of age* 

Milby (13) reports a statistical study of 65 lots of 
chicks in which slipped tendon occurred. Correlations of 
the percentage of slipped tendon and the percentage of 
protein, ash, calcium and phosphorus of the ration were cal¬ 
culated. The only significant correlation was found to be 
between the level of phosphorus in the ration and the in¬ 
cidence of slipped tendon. However, as the author states, 
these results do not justify the conclusion that phosphorus 
is the chief causative factor of slipped tendon but merely 
indicate that high percentages of slipped tendon are associat¬ 
ed with high phosphorus in the ration. 

Branion (B) presents the results of a three year study 
of the influence of different cereal grains on the quality of 
bone formed in the first twelve weeks of life. Chicks raised 
on otherwise apparently adequate diets, but with corn meal 
as the sole cereal grain, had a high percentage of abnormal 
leg bones, including bending and bowing, as well as slipped 
tendon. This condition had apparently no association with 
the Ca:P ratio, nor with the total mineral content of the 
ration, although the latter, if excessive, apparently aggravat¬ 
ed the condition. The author concludes that corn contains 
a constituent responsible for the production of slipped 
tendon, the activity of which is reduced by the inclusion of 
wheat germ, oat hulls and germ, or of complete oats in the 
ration. In addition, barley was found to produce a porous, 







- 10 - 


spongy bone similar to that produced by corn, but the incidence 
of slipped tendon on the barley ration was very low unless 
the mineral content of the ration was excessive. 

Titus and G-inn (22) replaced 10$ and 20$ of wheat, in 
a ration that produced perosis, with equal amounts of ric© 
bran and report that no perosis developed when the rice 
bran was included. In view of these and additional results 
obtained, the authors consider that perosis may be prevented 
by the addition of 6 to 10$ of rice bran to the ration, pro¬ 
viding the Ca:P ratio is adjusted to the optimum, (2.5:1). 

In view of their findings (1) that the ash content of the 
leg bones is normal, (2) the calcium and inorganic phos¬ 
phorus of the blood serum falls within the normal range, the 
authors consider that perosis is not a truly rachitic condi¬ 
tion. They also consider that in addition to vitamin D 
another accessory food factor or vitamin is necessary for 
the proper development of the leg bones of the chick. 

Titus (23) confirms the preventive action of rice bran 
as reported by (22) and considers this action to be due to 
a substance, vitamin in nature, which promotes normal bone 
development. He made an unsuccessful attempt to extract the 
active factor in rice bran with ether but found that the 
residue from ether-extracted rice bran retained the power to 
prevent perosis* 

Hunter, Knandel and Butcher (10) report a so-called 
preventive factor for slipped tendon. They found that oats 
and oat feed possessed beneficial properties that could not 





tjnc Ci 


« 







- 11 


be accounted for on the basis of fibre content. They also 
found that the abnormality could be produced by additions 
to the basal ration of calcium or phosphorus, or both, and 
could be brought about under a variety of Ca:P ratios, 

Sherwood and Couch (SI) found that a basal ration 
containing corn as the only cereal and having a phosphorus 
level of *51^ produced 10 to 15$ of slipped tendon. When 
1£$ of dried buttermilk in the basal ration was supplemented 
by 15$ of meat scrap, increasing the phosphorus level to 1$, 
the percentage of perosis was increased to 80. Rice bran 
or wheat middlings added to this ration at the expense of 
corn, definitely prevented slipped tendon at phosphorus 
levels up to 1$ of the ration. From their work they conclude 
that there are two or more factors responsible for slipped 
tendon: (1) A lack of mineral balance in the ration 

(Their results indicate that as the phosphorus level 
increases in the ration, the number of cases of slipped tendon 
is increased, and as the calcium level increases the number 
of cases of slipped tendon decreases.) (S) A factor, active 
in preventing slipped tendon, which is present in appreciable 
amounts in rice bran and wheat grey shorts, and possibly 
present in lesser amounts in oat groats and cottonseed meal. 

Bethke and Record (1) conclude that excessive amounts 
of calcium and phosphorus are important factors in the pro¬ 
duction of slipped tendon. They also observe that males are 
apparently more'susceptible than females and that slipped 








'

- 12 - 


tendon is more prevalent in the heavier than in the lighter 
breeds. 

Hunter and Funk (9) found that in chicks raised in 
battery brooders, the addition of bone meal, meat and bon© 
meal, or NaHgPC^to a basal ration increased the incidence of 
perosis from 0 to 80 fo. They conclude that the mineral content 
of the ration is an important etiological factor in the 
production of slipped tendon, and group lack of exercise, 
brooding on wire and crowded conditions as important con¬ 
tributing factors. 

Milby (14) finds that with rations otherwise adequate 
for normal growth, phosphorus appears to be the chief 
causative factor in the production of slipped tendon; 0.9$ 
phosphorus was found to be the lowest level at which slipped 
tendon was produced. As the phosphorus level was increased, 
up to 1.3 dfo, the percentage of slipped tendon was increased 
to 79 fo in males and 76 fo in females. The author also finds 
no significant difference in the ash content of the femurs, 
tibiae and metatarsi of chicks having slipped tendon, and 
that of normal chicks on a control ration at the same age. 

The ash determinations Y/ere made in all cases within a few 
days of the first manifestation of the disorder. The feeding 
of rice bran or wheat middlings v/as also found to be of value 
in preventing slipped tendon, the percentage of slipped tendon 
produced by a ration being determined mainly by the relative 
amounts of phosphorus and of preventive factor present. How¬ 
ever, susceptibility of the chicks and various environmental 









- 13 


factors may modify the results produced by the feeding of 
any ration. By the feeding of 3 fo MgCOg in the control 
ration, the author obtained neither slipped tendon nor 
marked bending of the leg bones. The growth of the chicks 
on this ration, however, was significantly lower than that 
of chicks on the control ration. The ash content of the 
dry fat-free femurs was reduced by the feeding of MgCOg. 

Parkhurst and McMurray (16) have made some general 
observations on perosis. They consider this disorder may 
be associated with poor vigor, either inherited or caused 
by unsatisfactory feeding and management during the early 
stages of the chick’s life. When perosis develops at two 
to four weeks it may improve and never produce a permanent 
deformity. However, in chicks lacking in constitutional 
vigor, the early condition referred to above fails to im¬ 
prove and a permanent deformity may result. The actual 
slipping of the tendon is considered to be due to a more 
rapid growth in the leg bones than in the tissues and ten¬ 
dons of the leg. As a result of e:xperimental work they con¬ 
clude that an excessive amount of meat and bone meal in the 
ration produces a high percentage of perosis which is marked¬ 
ly reduced when the bone meal content of the ration is re¬ 
duced. The feeding of CaCOg did not produce perosis under 
the conditions of their experiment. The protein content of 
the ration and the rate of growth did not materially affect 
the occurrence of perosis. Crowded conditions and lack of 
exercise were not found to be contributing factors of impor¬ 
tance. 








- 14 - 

Serfontein and Payne (20) present results which 
indicate the possible inheritance of the tendency toward 
"crooked legs". They obtained a significant difference 
in the percentage of crooked legs developing in chicks 
from matings of crooked leg parents and those from straight 
leg or normal parents. 

McGowan and Emslie (15) in a paper on "Rickets in 
Chickens," make several comments on perosis. They draw 
attention to the facts (1) perosis is not prevented or 
cured by feeding cod liver oil, (2) there is no histologi¬ 
cal abnormality in the bones examined. The factor most 
commonly associated with the condition is the presence of 
large amounts of GagJPO^Jg, as bone meal, in the ration. 

The authors refer to work done by McGowan in which evidence 
is presented to support the contention that the metabolism 
of calcium and phosphorus is less efficiently carried out 
when these two elements are fed in chemical union with one 
another. It is suggested that in order to prevent perosis, 
calcium be fed as the salt of some other radicle than 
phosphorus, the phosphorus being supplied separately in 
organic combination. In this way the calcium will be, for 
the most part, dissolved out and absorbed before the organic 
(delayed action) phosphorus is in a form to unite with it. 

The authors suggest that the beneficial effect resulting from 
the feeding of rice bran may be due to the rich supply of 
organic phosphorus present in this feed.

EXPERIMENTAL 

Chicks Used 

Day-old White Plymouth Rock chicks were used in the 
first four experiments and Rhode Island Reds in the fifth 
experiment. These heavy breeds were selected in preference 
to Leghorns as the incidence of perosis is generally found 
to be somewhat higher in the heavier than in the lighter 
breeds. 

Brooding 

For the first six weeks of each experiment an electrical 
ly-heated six-deck brooder was used, the heat being discon¬ 
tinued at four weeks. For the next two weeks some of the 
pens were transferred to a separate, unheated brooder. The 
chicks in each experiment were discarded at the end of eight 
weeks. The temperature of the brooder room was kept within 
a range of 70° to 80°F* 

Lighting 

To obtain a feeding day of constant length throughout 
the series, lights were turned on in the brooder room at 
dusk each day and turned off at 9:00 p.m. 

Method of Feeding and Y/atering 

Feed and water were available to the chicks at all times 
in troughs placed just outside the gates of each pen. Access 
to droppings was prevented by keeping the chicks on wire 
floors.

Recording of Results 

All chicks were weighed at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks of 
age. The feed was not removed before weighing. The legs 
and hock joints of the chicks were examined at the time 
of weighing. The average weights recorded in each experi¬ 
ment are based on the total number of individuals surviv¬ 
ing the test. The total number of cases of perosis, includ¬ 
ing flattened hocks, twisted legs, bent legs, and slipped 
tendon, were recorded at the time of each weighing. Only 
those cases in which recovery on any ration was considered 
impossible were reported as "slipped tendon". Cases which 
recovered during the experiment are reported for each two- 
week period. The percentage of slipped tendon was calculated 
on the number of chicks in the pen at two weeks of age. 
Mortalities in the first two weeks were not considered to be 
caused by perosis. The total percent mortality, however, 
was calculated from the number of chicks in the pen at the 
beginning of the experiment. 

In Experiments III, IY and Y, those chicks severely 
affected with slipped tendon were removed, at the time when 
it became evident that recovery was impossible, and their 
weights do not appear in the tables of average weights. 

These chicks are recorded as mortalities although the greater 
number of them were living when removed from the pen.

EXPERIMENT I (Not. 13/34 - Jan. 9/35) 


Objects 

(1) To confirm results obtained by Milby (14). 

(2) To study the various stages in the development of 
slipped tendon. 

(3) To determine the effect on the development of 
slipped tendon of varying the source of inorganic 
phosphorus. 

Four uniform groups, each containing 25 chicks, were 
selected and placed in a small heated brooder for two weeks. 
For the next four weeks these chicks were kept in four 
sections in the main heated brooder* then transferred to an 
unheated brooder when six weeks old. 

Rations 

1. Control - low phosphorus (non-perosis-produeing). 

2. High phosphorus with rice bran as preventive. 

3. High phosphorus, no preventive factor. 

4. Same as 3 but with meat scrap and fish meal used as 
the main sources of protein and as contributing 
sources of phosphorus.

Rations No. 1, 2 and 3 are identical, (as far as can 
be determined), with those used by Milby (14). The meat 
scrap used in No. 4 contained an appreciable amount of bone 
in a coarsely-ground condition. 

The estimated composition of these rations is presented 
in Table 3. The chemical composition of feeds listed in 
Table 1 was used in formulating this table.

The average weight of chicks living to eight weeks is 
lowest in the case of Pen 3. This may be explained by the 
severity of the deformity in the cases which developed, and 
the consequent difficulty in feeding. In some cases death 
resulted from starvation. There was considerable individual 
variation in weight in all pens. These rations all produced 
poor feathering.

Discussion of Results 

No abnormalities of any kind were observed in the legs of 
birds in Pen 1. This is in accord with Milby T s findings (14) 
when he used the same ration in three experiments. The preven- 

r a C wo* teerx 

tive action of rice bran as reported by^(22) (23) (14) is 


























- 21 - 


confirmed by the results in Pen £. However, the results 
are not as definite as obtained by Milby (14) when using 
the same ration, as one case of slipped tendon (4.3$) 
developed in this pen and there were two cases of twisted 
legs. These results may be Explained by the fact that the 
rice bran used by Milby probably differed considerably in 
composition from that of the rice bran used in these 
experiments. 

The results obtained in Pen 3 do not confirm those 
obtained by Milby (14), who reported 76$ of the females and 
79$ of the males afflicted with slipped tendon on this 
ration. However, the extreme severity of the cases that 
did develop is demonstrated by the high mortality in this 
pen after the fourth v/eek. 

The results in Pen 4 indicate that a higher percentage 
of slipped tendon may occur when meat scrap and fish meal 
are used to replace milk and inorganic salts as sources of 
protein and phosphorus in the ration. A possible explanation 
of this is the presence of coarse particles of bone in the 
meat scrap, which could be picked out from the mash by the 
chicks. The phosphorus intake of some of the chicks might 
thus be higher and that of others consequently lower than that 
indicated by the analysis of the ration. However, it is also 
possible that a variation in the source of protein and minerals 
is responsible for the increased incidence of slipped tendon. 

If this is the case, it is in accord with the findings of

Schaible, Moor© and Conolly (19) who report the influence 
of the source of protein, in a high mineral ration, on the 
incidence of perosis. 

The high mortality in this pen occurred in the first 
two weeks and is not significantly associated with the 
development of slipped tendon as in the case of Pen 3. 

EXEBRIMMT II (Nov. £4/34 - Jan. 19/35) 

Object 

To determine and compare the incidence of slipped tendon 
in chicks on two rations, (Ho. 20 and No. 40), both devised 
by the University of Alberta, on which varying degrees of 
incidence of perosis have been reported from various parts 
of the Province, 

No alterations were made in the general procedure as 
outlined previously. Only two pens were used in this experi¬ 
ment. Each pen contained 24 chicks of uniform size.

Discussion of Results 

From Table 9 it will be seen that under the conditions 
of this experiment the incidence of perosis is very low on 
both these rations, only one case of slipped tendon develop¬ 
ing on each, in addition to one case of twisted legs on 
Ration No. BO and two cases on No. 40. This low incidence of 
perosis in chickens making extremely rapid growth is in agree¬ 
ment with the findings of Parkhurst and McMurray (16) who 
reported that the rate of growth had no material effect on the 
occurrence of perosis. Crowded conditions, however, are 
considered by Hunter and Funk (9) to be important contributing 
factors in the development of slipped tendon, and it is pos¬ 
sible that under such condition^ which are quite common on 
many poultry farms, the incidence of slipped tendon on these 
two rations might be considerably higher than reported in this 
study. 

EXPERIMENT III (Dec. 18/34 - Eeb. 13/35) 

Objects 

(1) To confirm results obtained in Experiment I. 

(B) To determine if Marmite, when incorporated in a 
perosis-producing ration, contained a factor active in prevent¬ 
ing slipped tendon. 

(3) To investigate the importance of wire floors in the 
production of slipped tendon. 

The chicks in each pen had access to only one-half of a 
section in the heated brooder during the first four weeks. The 














- £5 


division made in the section interferred in no way with the 
brooding conditions, other than to reduce the space avail¬ 
able to each group. All pens were kept on wire floors with 
the exception of Pen 8. In this pen the wire floor was 
covered with double burlap for the first six weeks. 

Rations 

Pen 5 - Perosis-producing ration (high phosphorus), 
plus Marmite. 

6 - Perosis-producing ration, plus rice bran 

(preventive). 

7 - Same as 5, (high phosphorus), no preventive. 

8 - Same as 7.

Discussion of Results 

A comparison of Pens 5 and 7 indicates an increase in the 
incidence of perosis obtained by the addition of 3.5 fo Marmite 
(in P^n 5) to the original perosis-producing ration fed to Pen 7. 
There is also an increase in the percentage of actual slipped 
tendon, only 7 cases occurring in Pen 7, and 17 in Pen 5. The 
disorder also made its appearance more rapidly in Pen 5, 
where 17 chicks were affected by the fourth weeks, while in 
Pen 7 only 6 chicks were affected up to this time. 

Marmite is a commercial product prepared, under a patented 
process, from yeast by digestion or autolysis. The nitrogen 
present (6#23$) is largely in the form of amino nitrogen, as a 
water solution of Marmite gives no precipitate with Trichloro¬ 
acetic acid. The addition of 3.5^ Marmite, replacing an equal 
amount of yellow corn, raised the protein level of the ration 
slightly but did not vary the level of calcium and phosphorus, 
appreciably. At the present time no satisfactory explanation 
for the action of Marmite in increasing the production of slipped 
tendon can be given. 

The results in Pen 6 confirm the findings obtained in Pen 
2 in the first series of experiments, that, by the addition of 
rice bran to a perosis-producing ration, slipped tendon may be 
almost completely prevented. 

Pen 7 shows an even lower percentage of slipped tendon 
than was produced on a similar ration in Exp. I (Pen 3), and 
a greater variation from the results obtained by Milby (14) 
for White Leghorns on the same ration. These results are not 
in accord with those of Bethke and Record (1) who report the

incidence of perosis to be higher in the heavier than in the 
lighter breeds. Payne et al (18) also report a higher incidence 
of ”hock joint trouble” among Rhode Island Red chicks than 
among White Leghorns. 

The results obtained in Pens 7 and 8, receiving the 
same ration but on different floors indicate that brooding on 

wire floors is not an important contributing factor in the 

# 

production of slipped tendon. Hunter and Funk (9) obtained 
a reduction of 50;o in the occurrence of slipped tendon by 
replacing the wire floor with a solid floor, the latter being 
covered with sand. The results obtained in the present 
experiment would indicate that the beneficial results obtained 
by Hunter and Funk may have been due not to the type of 
floor used but to the ingestion of sand. However, in the 
present experiment the chicks on the burlap floor (Pen 8) 
did have access to their own droppings which would contain 
calcium and phosphorus, and it is possible that these may 
have been ingested in sufficient amounts, to raise the mineral 
level of the diet^-ss^flefently, -fcs nullify the beneficial 
effects of the soft floor. 

The results of this series also confirm those of Park- 
hurst and McMurray (16) that crowded conditions and lack of 
exercise are not contributing factors of any importance in 
the production of perosis.

Objects 

(1) To determine the incidence of perosis in chicks 
on ration No. 40, under more confined conditions of brooding, 
and on various modifications of ration 40, in which feeds 
readily available to the poultry producers in this Province, 
were utilised. 

The space allotted to each pen was, as in Exp. Ill, only 
half a section.

Discussion of Results 

The results obtained in Pen 9 are in agreement with those 
obtained in Pen 40, Exp. II, with respect to the low incidence 
of perosis. Under the more crowded conditions of this experi- 















































- 31 - 


ment, only two cases of perosis developed, and both of 
these had recovered when examined at six weeks of age. 

These results again confirm the results of Parkhurst and 
McMurray (16) on the influence of crowded conditions. 

This low incidence of perosis in Pen 9 makes a comparison 
of the modifications of No. 40 used in Pens 10, 11 and 12 
with the original No. 40, on the basis of incidence of 
perosis, of little value. Ration 12, however, has a slight 
advantage in this respect, as no cases of the deformity were 
observed. However, the growth on this ration was decidedly 
lower than that on the other three, in which there is little 
difference in average weight at six weeks. 

As there was a considerable variation not only in 
size but also in body type of the birds supplied us for this 
experiment, too much significance should not be attached to the 
figures presented in Table 15, reporting average weights. 

BXPSRMENT V (Feb. 19 - April 2/35) 

Objects 

(1) To determine the effect on the incidence of perosis 
of the addition of silica sand and of sodium silicate to a 
perosis-produeing ration. 

(2) To determine the effect of exercise on the incidence 
of perosis, in chicks fed a perosis-produeing ration. 

The preventive action of rice bran on the production of 

4 

perosis has been reported by several workers (22) (23) (14) and 
has been confirmed in Pen 3, Exp. I, and Pen 6, Exp. II. During 
the analysis of rice bran it was noted that silica was an 
important constituent of the ash of rice bran, from a <iuantita-

tive point of view. 

Titus (23) found the "preventive factor" of rice bran 
to be unextractable with ether, but retained in the ether 
extracted residue. 

Hunter and Funk (9) obtained a reduction in the per¬ 
centage of slipped tendon in chicks brooded on a solid floor 
covered with sand. The results obtained in Pen 8, Exp. Ill, 
of this series indicate the relative unimportance of type of 
floors as a contributing factor in the production of slipped 
tendon and the possibility that the beneficial effects obtained 
by these workers may have been due to the ingestion of sand 
picked up from the floor. 

Milby (14) reports good growth and no perosis on a 
ration containing 8 fo dry sandy loam. 

King, Stantial and Dolan (12) have reported the results 
of feeding various levels of particulate and of soluble silica 
to rabbits. They found that although the level of silica in 
the blood remained fairly constant with changes in the silica 
content of the ration, the absorption of particulate and 
soluble silica from the digestive tract, and also the excretion 
of silica in the urine, increased as the level of silica in the 
diet was increased. 

In view of these findings it was considered possible that 
silica might play some part in the prevention of perosis and 
Experiment V was, therefore, designed to examine this possibility 

Hunter and Funk (9) have suggested lack of exercise as an 
important contributing factor in the production of slipped tendon 
A study of the effect of exercise was, therefore, included in 








this experiment, (Pen 16). For the first four weeks the chicks 
in this pen were given the opportunity to scratch four hours a 
day in a litter of shredded wood which covered a burlap mat on 
the floor of the pen. During the exercising period the feed 
troughs were removed and a handful of feed scattered in the 
litter. For the remainder of the day the chicks remained on 
the wire floor. Shredded wood was chosen for litter as being 
a material not likely to be ingested to any extent by the chicks.

As will be seen in Table EO, the average weights in Pen 
15 are lower at two weeks than those of other pens. Since it 
was desired to obtain the same rate of growth in all pens, and 
since no perosis had developed in Pen 15 at this time (See Table 
El), the water glass was reduced to 3.5$. However, due to the 
development of perosis in Pen 15 in the third week, the water 
glass was restored to the original level, at the beginning of 
the fourth week. At this time the level of silica in Pen 14 
was also raised to 5 fo, in an effort to check the development of 
perosis. 

The average weights of all groups at six weeks are very 
low, considering the high protein level of the rations. After

the beginning of the fourth week, with perosis affecting 50 Q /o 
or more in each pen, there was a pronounced tendency for the 
chicks in all groups to remain in a resting position. The 
consequent low intake of feed may account in part for the 
poor growth obtained.

Discussion of Abnormalities 

From Table El it will be seen that the total cases of 
perosis are approximately the same for Pens 13, 14 and 15, and 
slightly greater for Pen 16. No significant difference in the 
percentage of slipped tendon is obtained in Pen 14 by the 
addition of silica, or in Pen 15 by the addition of sodium 


silicate 



































- 36 


These results are in accord with the results of Hunter, 
Knandel and Dutcher (10) who obtained no beneficial results 
by the addition of the ash of oat feed to a perosis-producing 
ration, although 20 fo of oat feed was found to possess the 
power to prevent ”hock disease”. 

The percentage of slipped tendon is reduced by only 6 °/o 
in Pen 16, receiving exercise during the first four weeks. 

This difference is not significant and confirms the results 
of Parkhurst and McMurray (16) who found that lack of exercise 
was not a contributing factor of any importance. 

MECHANISM OF THE DEVELOPMENT OP SLIPPED TENDON 

The symptoms observed during the development of perosis, 

S r & v C ker*& 

as reported by^S) (9) (11) (14) (17) (23) have already been 
reviewed. The observations made during the experiments herein 
reported, however, fail to confirm in some instances, and 
definitely contradict in others, the observations of these 
workers. 

Milby (14) in reporting his own observations states that 
"the first observable symptom is usually a slight puffiness 
about the hock joint.” Payne (17), Hunter and Funk (9), Titus 
(23), Insko et al (11), report a definite enlargement of the 
hock joint with the onset of perosis. Payne (17), Titus (23), 
and Insko et al (11) observed discoloration in some cases of 
enlarged hock joint, due to hemorrhage in the tissues surround¬ 
ing the joint. During this series of experiments, however, no 
cases of enlargement or of discoloration of the hock joint 
were observed at the time of the onset of perosis. The only 

abnormality noted at this time was a decided flattening of the 
hock joint. _

Payne (17) considers that in some cases of "enlarged 
hock” the gastrocnemius tendon may slip from the condyles 
of the tibia resuiting in the development of a permanent 
deformity, Titus (23) considers the slipping of the tendon 
to be due either to a slipping of the articular cartilage 
on the distal end of the tibia, or to a decided bending of 
the diaphysis of the distal end of the tibia. In no case in 
this series of experiments, however, was the bending of the 
tibia ever noted before the slipping of the tendon although 
in some cases a bowing of the metatarsus occurred before or 
v/ithout a slipping of the tendon. Milby (14) considers the 
bending of the tibia to be the result rather than the cause of 
the displacement of the tendon. 

All the larger tendons, leading from the muscles in the 
upper leg to the metatarsus and the foot, pass through a ring 
of cartilage on the posterior surface of the proximal end of 
the metatarsus. This ring is completed by the attachment of 
the lower end of the Achilles tendon to the outer edges of 
the ring of cartilage. By this structural arrangement all 
the tendons passing over the distal end of the tibia are held 
in place. A rotation or t?n.sting of the metatarsus, (with a 
consequent flattening of the hock joint), would therefore tend 
to draw the main tendons out of alignment v/ith the bones. 

In mild cases this twisting of the metatarsus apparently 
ceases, and no permanent deformity results. In cases which 
become progressively worse, however, the metatarsus may 
continue to rotate until the main tendons are pulled over the 
edge of one of the condyles on the distal end of the tibia. 
When this occurs the tendons will, of course, become useless

in flexing and straightening the lower leg and foot, and a 
permanently deformed condition will result. These observa¬ 
tions are in accord with those of Doyle (3) who considers 
this type of "leg weakness” to be essentially a bending or 
torsion of the bones which form the hock joint, with a 
consequent displacement of the Achilles tendon. This improper 
alignment of the two bones and the weight of the bird pressing 
on the deformed limb, probably combine to produce the lateral 
bending of the epiphysis at the distal end of the tibia and 
the bowing of the metatarsus, which were observed in some of 
the advanced cases. 

Dissection studies of permanently deformed legs tend 
to confirm the above theory of the mechanism by which slipped 
tendon is produced. In the specimens examined, the cartilage- 
nous ring was found to be properly formed, and to enclose the 
tendons in their normal position. However, the alignment 
of the tibia and metatarsus was found to be abnormal, the 
metatarsus being rotated so that the ring of cartilage, with 
its enclosed and attached tendons, was shifted to one side 
of the joint. In this position it is obvious the tendons 
could not perform their function adequately, and the leg would 
therefore be rendered useless. Plates illustrating normal and 
deformed leg bones are shown on the opposite page. 

From our observations on the mechanism involved in the 
development of perosis it is concluded that the essential factor 
in the series of events leading to slipped tendon, is the 
rotation of the metatarsus. This in turn causes sufficient 

displacement of the cartilage enclosing the tendons, to pull 
the main tendons from the groove formed by the condyles at

the distal end of the tibia, and results in a disabled and 
permanently deformed condition. 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

(1) In rations otherwise satisfactory for normal 
growth, a high level of phosphorus was found to be associated 
with a high incidence of perosis. 

(2) The source of protein and inorganic phosphorus 
was found to have some influence on the incidence of perosis. 

(3) Rice bran, when comprising 20$ of a high-phosphorus 
ration, was effective in reducing the incidence of perosis. 

(4) Marmite, when added at the rate of 3.5$ to a high- 
phosphorus ration, increased the incidence of perosis and the 
percentage of slipped tendon. No explanation for this action 
of marmite can be given. 

(5) The additional exercise obtained when chicks were 
allowed to scratch in a litter of shredded wood for four 
hours a day during the first four weeks did not result in a 
decrease in the incidence of perosis. 

(6) The incidence of perosis in chicks fed a perosis- 
producing ration, was not reduced by covering the wire floor 
with burlap for the first six weeks. 

(7) The incidence of perosis on two standard chick 
rations tested, was found to be very low. The revisions made 
in one of these (No. 40) did not definitely prevent perosis, 
and in some cases resulted in decreased rate of growth. 








- 40 


(8) The addition of sand (SiOg) or of sodium silicate 
to a perosis-producing ration did not result in a reduction 
in the incidence of perosis. 

(9) As a result of observations and dissection studies, 
perosis is considered to be primarily a disorder of the leg 
bones of the chick. The initial outward symptom, produced by 
a rotation of the metatarsus, is a decided flattening of the 
hock-joint. In the intermediate stages, depending on the extent 
of the twisting of the metatarsus, this bone may become bent 

or bowed. 

In the final stage, referred to as "slipped tendon" and 
produced by the persistent rotation of the metatarsus, the 
tendons are pulled over the edge of the condyles to one side 
of the joint and the leg is carried in an abnormal position. 

In this final stage the epiphysis at the distal end of the 
tibia may, in some cases, be bent laterally in the direction 
in which the tendon slips and the metatarsus may also be bowed.
