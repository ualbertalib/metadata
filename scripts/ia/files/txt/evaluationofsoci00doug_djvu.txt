INTRODUCTION 








INTRODUCTION 


The treatment of this subject consists of four 
general sections. The first presents a brief historical 
account of social achievements from the time of the Hebrew 
Prophets to the emergence of the modern term "Social 
Gospel"o The second section indicates the forces which 
were operative within the Methodist, Presbyterian and 
Congregational Churches of Canada before Union. The third 
part describes the actual social undertakings of the 
United Church of Canada since its consummation in 1925. 

The last section is an attempt to evaluate socialogically 
the achievements of the United Church in the life of the 
nation.

THE MEANING OP THE SOCIAL GOSPEL 





Chapter I 


THE MEANING OF THE SOCIAL GOSPEL 

The "Social Gospel" is not a new religion, but is a 
modern development of Jesus* teaching within the historic 
Church. The Social Gospel is a rediscovery of Jesus* own 
gospel. Many have attempted to trace the Social Gospel 
back to Jesus and his times and even to the 8th century 
B.C. prophets. However, even though every age has felt a 
dissatisfaction with the existing social order and has 
attempted a social regeneration, the term 1 Social Gospel* 
as understood by us today, is of a recent origin. The 
earlier ages, although void of a "Social Gospel", were not 
without their social spirit. 

The great Hebrew prophets of the 8th century B.C. were 
religious reformers demanding social action. They 
preached justice and mercy, goodwill towards one’s 
neighbor and humane treatment of the sick, the poor and the 
helpless. They condemned tyranny and the graft of men in 
power as extremely harmful to the welfare of mankind. They 
looked to a future age when their social and religious 
ideals would be realized. 

"Emancipation from foreign tyranny, peace and order 
throughout the land, just and humane rulers, fertility of

the soil, prosperity for all, a glorious capital city with 
a splendid temnle in it — it was the social utopia of an 
agrarian nation”.(1) Almost every aspect of human life 
was included in their ideals. This social hope, fired with 
a deep spiritual religion, they entrusted to God who was th< 
sole mover of events. -Although they dealt with individuals 
their concern was with their nation. They saw the 
necessity of uniting all their countrymen in a social order 
based on divine right and sanction. 

The E document in the Pentateuch stressed mercy and 
kindness. "If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or ass going 
astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him. Also thou 
shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the heart of a 
stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt".(2 
Amos, compelled by the evils of his time, came forth with 
his message of reform. "Seek good and not evil, that thou 
may live; that this Jehovah, God of hosts, may be with you 
as you have said. Hate evil and love good, and establish 
justice in the gate."(3) Hosea preached love and mercy. 

God was a God of love and personal loyalty to him was the 
essential prerequisite of a perfect social order. "For I

desire mercy, and not sacrifice; and knowledge of God more 
than burnt offerings.”(1) Isaiah desired of his people 
right life and the righting of social wrongs He denounced 
the corrupt rulers of Judah: ”You yourselves have devoured 
the vineyards, the spoils of the needy are in your houses. 
What do you mean by crushing my people and by grinding the 
face of the needy.”(2) He brought scorn upon judicial 
injustice. ”Woe to those who for a bribe vindicate the 
wicked, and strip the innocent man of his innocence.”(3) Rt 
hated land monopoly. ”Woe to those who join house to house, 
who add field to field until there is no space left, and 
you dwell alone in the midst of the land.”(4) He exposed 
the economic evil of intemperance and luxury; ”Woe to thos« 
who rise at dawn to pursu© strong drink, who tarry late in 
the evening until wine inflames them, and lyre and harp and 
timbrel and flute and wine are at their banquets; but they 
regard not the work of Jehovah, and see not what his hands 
have made, therefore my people go into captivity un¬ 
prepared, and their men of wealth are famished, and their 
noisy revellers are parched with thirst.”(5) Micah 
emphasizes justice, mercy, humbleness: ”He hath shewed thee 
Oman, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee

but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly 
with thy God".(l) Jeremiah preached obedience to God and 
righteousness: "Woe to him who buildeth his house by un¬ 
righteousness, and his chambers by injustice; who causeth 
his neighbor to labour without wages, and giveth him not 
his pay; ’But thine eyes and heart are bent only on thy 
dishonest gain, and on the shedding of innocent blood and 
on oppression and violence."(2) The Book of Deuteronomy 
embodies many social principles such as duties of husbands 
to their wives;(3), duty of parents to children,(4); duty o 
children to parents (5); duty of master to slaves (6); 
obligations of rulers (7); duty of judges (8); the owner¬ 
ship of property (9); measures of prevention of poverty(10) 
II Isaiah’s message contained a world view: "This is the 
Lord’s command to us: ’I have set you to be a light for the 
Gentiles, to bring salvation to the end of the earth,"(11). 

"Here then we have a succession or men perhaps 
unique in religious history for their moral heroism 
and spiritual insight. They were the moving spirits 
in the religious progress of their nation; the 
creators, directly or indirectly, of its law, its 
historical and poetical literature, and its piety. 

We have seen that these men were almost indifferent, 
if not contemptuous, about the ceremonial side of

customary religion, but turned with passionate 
enthusiasm to moral righteousness as the true 
domain of religion# 

We have seen that their religious concern was not 
restricted to private religion and morality, but 
dealt preeminently with the social and political 
life of their nation# 

We have seen that their sympathy was wholly and 
passionately with the poor and oppressed. 

We have seen that the religious concern in politics 
ceased only when politics ceased. 

We have seen that the true prophets opposed the 
complacent optimism of the people and of their 
popular spokesmen, and gave warnings of disaster 
as long as it was coming."(1) 


The prophets before the Babylonian exile emphasized 
the significance of national life and expected the new 
order to come as an act of God, which was to grow out of 
their present conditions. x hen came the Exile when the 
nation no longer possessed its independence, its home, its 
neighborhood life and social coherence. The prophets of 
the Exile felt that the new age, with its splendor and glor; 
could come only by miraculous intervention. At the same 
time the oppressor would be punished by God. 


In the post-Exilic period the life of Israel was 

bound up with affairs of foreign powers, and controlled by

them. Their religion and thought became influenced by 
many new streams from without. The prophetic hope devel¬ 
oped into what is called apocalypticism which came to 
dominate the outlook of the early Christians. The history 
of the Jewish nation itself became the working out of the 
implications of its social consciousness. 

The world into which Jesus was ushered has been 
pictured for us in detail by historians and theologians: 
G.H.C. Macgregor and A.C. Purdy, T. R. Glover, S. ^ngus, 

S. J. Case, etc. ^-ngus has shown the effects of the many 
wars upon society fought during the period between the time 
of Alexander the Great and ^ es us. The exhaustion of nat¬ 
ional resources and loss of comforts promoted rebellion and 
revolution. The lands upon which armies fought lay 
exhausted, crops destroyed, thousands of people killed, 
countries plundered. Many had become slaves. Foreign 
capitalists exploited the subdued countries. The Roman 
Empire had become wealthy and luxurious which led to self- 
indulgence and which in turn resulted in deterioration. 

The middle class disappeared, which caused a huge gulf 
between rich and poor. Many flocked to the cities, some 
attracted by their beauty, places of amusement and better 
opportunities of making a fortune. Others left the rural 
areas because of the decline of agriculture. The Greeks

and Romans saw no wrong in slavery. Contributing to the 
dark side of the period was the stage with immoralities, 
the amphitheatre with its shocking gladiatorial shows and 
races, the refusal to give women a prominent place in 
society, little regard for children, especially girls, 
except among the Jews, the practice of abortion, the 
philosophy of eat, drink and be merry, greed and lust of 
some of the rulers, mystery religions, priestly demand of 
ritual and ceremony, ignorance so universal among the masse 
absence of the spirit of brotherhood and love, justice and 
mercy on the part of so many. 


Besides this dark and lurid aspect a better side did 
exist. Slaves were granted justice and consideration as 
brutal masters were in the minority. Many attempts were 
made to restrain the passion for the amphitheatre by 
Augustus, Tiberius, Demonax, Cicero, Seneca and Petronius. 
On the part of ijiany domestic virtue was cherished and 
advocated, virginity held in high esteem, women given bette 
education*: children loved as proved by inscriptions, 
prostitution condemned as being a public menace and a 
danger to married life. Other encouraging aspects of the 
period can be found in the expanding consciousness of man’s 
innate moral sense as a guide to conduct, an earnest 
practical sense, a growing conviction of the oneness of

humanity and the brotherhood of man. "The Cosmopolitan 
spirit gave rise in the Empire to gentler and humaner 
manners. Lecky attributes this chiefly to the humanity of 
the Greeks, who first revealed the beauty of the gentler 
virtues. The breaking down of aristocratic bigotry and 
tyranny. The empire took a terrible vengeance on the 
nobility. The civil wars caused a reversal of fortune, and 
wealth was passing into new quarters where old prejudices 
were of no account. The colonial influence, especially the 
concourse of strangers at Rome, the facilities for travel, 
the blending of populations. Finally, the coming of 
provincial emperors like the Flavians and the Antonines. 

The brotherhood festered by the populous slave world. The 
bigoted pan-Roman policy disappeared; Roman citizenship was 
gradually extended until under Caracalla all the free were 
granted citizenship. The brotherhood of man in a universal 
republic was more actualised then that at any time since. 
Only one bond was lacking — a universal religion."(1) 

Out of such a period emerged Jesus who proclaimed the 
spirit of brotherhood and goodwill among all men. His 
influence has reached with immortal power across the 
centuries.

John Macmurray in his hook "The Clue to History" 
asks the question, ’Was Jesus a social reformer?’ He then 
goes on to show that the question arouses a dualist mode 
of thought for it implies a contrast or conflict between 
a spiritual world and a material world which would mean 
interpreting Jesus as either a social or religious enthus¬ 
iast. But Macmurray says that this distinction did not 
arise in Jewish religions. 


"It is an integral consciousness, for which social 
history is the content of religious experience, and 
social behaviour the criterion of religious reality. 
Jesus, like any of the Hebrew prophets, could not 
make a religious assertion without making a demand 
upon social behaviour. He could not frame a religious 
judgment without judging contemporary social life. 

And to say that Jesus was both concerned about men’s 
spiritual life and about the conditions of their 
material life is to distinguish the two in a way that 
is only possible for a non-religious mind. For the 
religious consciousness a statement about society is 
a religious statement and a statement about God has 
an immediate and direct reference to society. This 
is the clue to any understanding of Jesus. He is not 
a materialist—because the dissatisfaction between 
the ideal and the material does not arise for him,"(l) 


Jesus’ teaching, then, arose in part from a religious 


criticism of his contemporary society. 


While Jesus was still young a courageous but ascetic 
reformer loudly protested against the corruption and 
formalism of his time. From the very outset of his public

ministry Jesus identified himself with this reformer, John 
the Baptist. However, later he disagreed in method or means 
although the ends in view were fundamentally the same, 
namely, the deliverance of the Hebrew nation by the 
reformation of its individual members. For John a new age 
was to be inaugurated which for him was the Kingdom of God 
and which embraced the restoration of the Davidic kingdom, 
the reign of social justice, and the triumph of true 
religion. This he announced would come suddenly at which 
time would arrive the Messiah who would destroy the wicked. 


In contrast to this view, Jesus spoke of the kingdom as 
something reigning within the hearts of people. The King¬ 
dom of God, rather than breaking in suddenly, would come 
slowly be means of a change in heart and attitude. 

"Because Jesus believed in the organic growth of 
the new society, he patiently fostered its growth, 
cell by cell. Every human life brought under 
control of the new spirit which he himself 
embodied and revealed was an advance of the king- 
dome of God. Every time the new thought of the 
Father and of the right life among men gained a 
firmer hold of a human mind and brought it to the 
point of action, it meant progress."(1) 

Jesus worked with individuals and through individuals, but 

his real end was social rather than individualistic. He 

employed strong social forces in his method.

Crisis", The Macmillan Co., New York, 1910, p. 60.

So often Jesus had been regarded as a Social Reformer* 
He was more than that. He was a social revolutionist. 

Such a note characterized his teaen±ngs, yet his method 
was spiritual and not temporal, peaceful and not war-like. 
He revised the conception of wealth. True wealth meant 
character rather than worldly possessions. He reversed the 
conception of greatness—the servant of all is the greatest 
His emphasis seemed to be, for the most part, upon the 
beggar, the outcast, the sinner. He uprooted the sacrifi¬ 
cial system with all fasts and rites. For him religion 
was a thing of the heart, not ritualism. To the unfortunat 
he announced the dawning of a new day. We need not read 
far into the New Testament to discover that Jesus was poor¬ 
conscious as well as sin-conscious. His gospel was one of 
love and brotherhood—giving aid to the poor, healing the 
broken hearted, deliverance to captives, feeding the hungry, 
clothing the naked. For him such a conception was 
distinctly spiritual. Whom did he cite as an example of 
neighborliness and brotherhood? Not the priest, nor the 
Levite, but the Samaritan, a foreigner. The Kingdom of God 
was at hand, and when ushered in there would be no more 
slavery, no huge gulf between rich and poor as wealth would 
be diffused, education obtainable for all, no more wars, 
homes characterized by the atmosphere of love and every

man his brother*s keeper. 

tfe are safe in saying that Jesus* ministry was chara¬ 
cteristically sacrificial rather than ecclesiastical or 
theological* 

"He never propounded a creed, confession of faith 
or body of divinity. He treated men always as 
spiritual beings; and God as the Father of mankind, 
in whose love is the hope of life. But he did not 
argue even these simple theological propositions, 
except when he was confronted by special quest¬ 
ioning. If we read with a fresh and open mind 
his instructions, we shall perhaps be surprised 
to discover how little there is in them about what 
we ordinarily call religion,— church going, Bible 
reading, forms of public worship, doctrine of theo¬ 
logy. "(1) 

In another sense was Jesus a social revolutionist. 

Ihe Jews of his day were great enthusiasts in regard to the 
Messianic age. In men*s minds existed a variety of hopes 
and expectations of the coming age which was to be intro¬ 
duced supernaturally. To him they turned as the one in 
whom their dreams would be realized. According to one 
conception a divinely-appointed head of the people should 
appear some day as a great deliverer who, being a 
descendant of David, should restore the ancient house of 
Judah. Some expected the Messiah to appear first in the 
wilderness and lead his followers into the Holy Land. Othea

attempted to picture the Messiah leading a revolt by means 

of the sword against the oppressors and slaying every one 

of them* This triumphal Kingdom of God was to be for Jews 

only, but Jesus included all people of all nations. So 

many pictured the Kingdom in terms of a despotism. Jesus 

stated that it must be characterized by the democratic 

spirit. The majority of men saw themselves blessed with 

material plenty and comfort in this new age as economic 

wealth was regarded as the end while religion and morality 

were the means. For Jesus, the end was a high ethical and 

religious life. The Jews hoped for an immediate and 

sudden inauguration of the new age. Jesus saw that it must 

come by gradual growth. For them it was a future age, 

while for Jesus the Kingdom of God was both present and 

future as it had begun already. "The Kingdom of God is 

within you".(l) "Those that do the Father’s will shall 

enter the Kingdom." (2) "Those to partake of the Kingdom 

would be the pure in heart, the gentle, the poor in spirit, 

the peacemakers, the persecuted for righteousness’ sake, 

with no racial discrimination.(3) 

"The purpose of all that Jesus said and did and hoped 
to do was always the social redemption of the entire 
life of the human race on earth."(4)

Christianity, inspired by the teachings and influence 
of Jesus, was begun with a great social ideal. Instructed 
by Jesus in a new way of life, upheld by a new faith and 
hope and love, the disciples and followers, among whom were 
Paul, Silas, Timothy and others, went forth to proclaim the 
Kingdom of God upon the earth. But soon this enthusiasm was 
to wane. Those who listened to them and followed them were 
the slaves and the freedmen, the poor and the outcast. 

In opposition to this new reign of justice, liberty 
and peace on earth, stood Homan despotism. The Christians 
could not visualize themselves, so few, as breaking the yoke 
of the vast Roman Empire. The hope of Christ’s return was 
uppermost in the minds of the disciples and fellow 
Christians. With his return the new kingdom would be 
inaugurated. In this kingdom of God lay the hope of social 
perfection when the present world powers would be overthrow! 
They waited and watched for the Messiah to come again in 
great glory and power. But he did not come. Gradually 
early Christians abandoned the hope of a world-wide kingdom 
and drew a distinction between their select group and the 
world. They turned to forms and organizations and put 
their trust in them instead of in the spirit which was the 
case with Jesus. 


Rauschenbusch is of the opinion that the social ideal 




• i .

. 






































-15 


inspired by Jesus entered into a long eclipse. Yet this 

doe’s not mean that the ideal was wholly obscured. He 

suggests several causes for this condition. 

"The long eclipse of the social ideal was due to a 
combination of various causes. The decline of the 
Jewish influence deprived it of the energy which 
centuries of preparation had given it in Judaism. 

Its apocalyptic form made it unreal and unpractical. 
Speculative theology crowded out the social ideas 
by a wholly different and apparently more ’spiritual* 
set of conceptions. The hope of heaven absorbed the 
religious fervor which might have reached out for a 
better life on earth. The organized Church absorbed 
the constructive ability of Christian men, concent¬ 
rated their social interest on the work done through 
the Church, and depreciated the religious value of 
the social order outside of the church. The decline 
of democracy within the church weakened the religious 
force of democratic and social aspirations."(1) 


True enough, early Christianity had its social impact 
upon the known world at that time. Within the Christian 
group the poor and the sick, the widows and orphans, were 
cared for. By the beginning of the third century charitable 
help was administered through the organized church, and by 
the end of that same century charity began to be institut¬ 
ionalized — Christian lodging houses for strangers, homes 
for the aged, sick and poor. The Christian Church was of 
tremendous social value to the lower middle class, the 
working class and the slaves as it gave to them some 
security in the corrupt economic world of that time.

"Harnack makes ’The Gospel of Love and Charity* one of the 
chief chapters in his account of the missionary expansion 
during the first three centuries."(1) 

As the years of the first century passed this new 
religion penetrated wider and wider areas of society. 

Soon Christianity was loosed from the bonds of Jewish 
monopoly and assimilated by its new Graeco-Roman environ¬ 
ment.Shirley Jackson Case paints a much brighter picture of 
early centuries of the Christian era in regard to the social 
achievements.(2) i 2 he new environment insisted upon the 
necessity and dignity of work. Within half a century it 
was to be found in a great variety of occupations and 
professions. The character of one’s service marked by 
fidelity and honesty excelled in importance the choice of 
one’s occupation. At the outset, in the eyes of the Roman 
world, a Christianlacked social prestige. But by the 
second century converts among the higher classes were 
evident. 

The outstanding social triumph of early Christianity 
came in the political sphere. At first Christianity had no

political program except the supernatural establishment of 
the Kingdom of God. The Christians observed the laws of the 
state in so far as the laws did not conflict with their 
religious loyalties. Yet they did not hesitate to inform 
the authorities that they disapproved heart and soul with 
the method of administration of the state. Persecutions 
followed, but the Christians remained true to their 
convictions. Christian apologists such as Origen, Ambrose, 
Clement of Alexandria, ficonius and Augustine, who opposed 
this existing type of administration theory, developed a 
new philosophy of government. They saw the need of 
introducing divine sanctions for administration. They 
insured Due emperors of social security of the empire if 
the Christian religion were accepted and the Christian God 
made the supreme protector of the state. This was granted 
by Constantine in the fourth century. Thus Christianity 
was made sole divine guardian of the welfare of the state. 
At last the acceptance of Christianity was officially 
complete 


According to Case, 


"There is ample evidence that the Christian move¬ 
ment had not lost its soul when it became the 
official religion of the state. As a matter of 
fact, its social vision was broadened and inten¬ 
sified by the new duties it was called upon to 
discharge."(1)

Christianity assumed many responsibilities in the sphere 
of practical social work. Charitable institutions increa¬ 
sed in number and importance. Christianity produced the 
impetus to introduce several social reforms. For example, 
it improved the conditions of and cared for unwanted 
children, demanded better treatment for slaves, abolished 
gladitorial shows and scandalous theatrical performances* 
Christians aided greatly in reforming the administration of 
justice. The Christian Church maintained justice and order 
when imperial rule broke* 

Europe underwent a period of darkness known as the 
Middle Ages (fifth century to fifteenth century) during 
which time the advance of the social teachings were brought 
almost to a stand-still. Rauschenbusch calls this period 
an eclipse. However, dark as it may seem, the Church did 
make some contributions which cannot be left unmentioned* 

The assurance of the security of the Roman Empire by its 
alliance with Christianity laid much responsibility upon the 
Church. But morally the church staggered, although it did 
not fall. 

"We have a right to discount the common view that 
the church was ’paganized* or ’secularized* in 
this period* Compromise was inevitable; but on 
the whole, Christian moral idealism was not 
surrendered. Its potency is cogently illustrated 
by the fact that Ambrose of Milan, who in the 

name of God and the Church commanded the Emperor

Theodosius to penance for an inhuman deed in 390, 
had himself been a pagan sixteen years before* 

The ♦Apostolic Constitutions 1 of about the opening 
of the fifth century commanded bishops to decline 
the gifts of those who oppressed widows and orphans, 
imprisoned the innocent or mistreated their slaves. 
The penitential system laid down heavy penalties for 
an increased variety of offenses, supplementing the 
provisions of secular law. There was in process an 
extensive modification of imperial laws and 
institutions in the direction of humane and Christian 
ideals which, accompanied by the proscription of 
pagan worship^ brought a growing realization of the 
new imperial theocracy, a conception memorably 
expressed by Prudentius a century after Constantine’s 
liberation of the Church”. (1) 


Throughout the Middle Ages the secular empire gradually 
and unconsciously yielded place toaaecclesiastical one. The 
conception of divine authority and appointment of kings 
prevailed. The clergy became moral directors of both ruleri 
and people. This high conception of kingship aided greatly 
in discouraging rebellion but failed to remedy the politics] 
disorders. Even though European society, after the fall 
of Robe in 410, was marked by barbarism the monastic 
communities made their contribution through their educated 
ecclesiastics and quiet protests. They objected to the 
prevailing feudal anarchy and the secularization of the 
Church. 

"As a result, we see a series of vigorous efforts 
in two directions: to bring the warring barons to

peace, and to extricate the church from secular 
domination."(1} 

In the peace movement of the eleventh century clergy, monks 
and common people united to break the dominating power of 
the barons. The dispute remained unsettled throughout the 
Middle Ages. The one great influence upon social thought 
was still that of Augustine who in his "City of God” 
attempted to bring before men’s minds the conception of a 
spiritual City of God which had been rising slowly in the 
past and which was destined to include all the kingdon^of 
the earth. Bishop Otto of Freising, in the twelfth century, 
seriously attempted to create a unrxstian outlook on 
society by going back to Augustine's "City of God". 

Ebuschenbusch in his book "Christianizing the Social 

Order", states that the real social consciousness of 

Christianity began to emerge from its eclipse (if I may use 

this term) with the birth of modern democracy. Beginning 

in the twelfth century there arose several religious 

movements, most of which were socially minded to a great 

extent. Among these movements were the Franciscans, 

Lollards, Woldenses, Taborites and Anabaptists. 

"They heralded the religious awakening of the 
common people and their cry for the reign of 
God on earth."(2)

The Protestant reformation concerned itself more with 
the salvation of the individual and based its theology on 
the doctrinal system of Paul rather than on the teachings 
of ^esus. Nevertheless it contributed greatly to the 
advancement of social Christianity, It was a reform. It 
broke the ecclesiastical powers of the church which so long 
held the people in subjection as it abolished many of the 
sacraments and denied ascetic and superstitious practices. 
The democratic spirit from that time on characterized the 
church. 

"Democratio Christianity inevitably means social 
Christianity. In its final outworkings the 
Reformation changed the Church in the direction 
toward which the democratic movements before the 
Reformation had striven, and in Christianizing 
the Church, it set free the organized conscience of 
Christendom and made modern science, modern 
democracy, and modern social renovation possible".(1) 


The lands in which Protestantism sprang up and 
flourished presented many new social problems. The politici 
and economic life were passing through a transition. The 
old social security appeared to be uprooted by new devel¬ 
opments in trade and industry. Unfavorable conditions of 
the under-privileged increased rapidly due to monopolistic 
prosperity and new developments in agriculture and 
industry. Prices soared. Poverty increased. Regardless 
of the greatness and importance of the early Protestant

reformers, these new social problems were never grasped 
clearly. Such condistions remained the concern of the 
state rather than the churcji. Luther himself placed little 
importance on Society as a whole. He had little desire to 
improve the conditions of the peasants as a group. Calvin 
concerned himself more with particular election and 
particular redemption. 

1‘he beginnings of the modern spirit of the Social 
Gospel are found in the eighteenth century, which 
followed a period of Empiricism, Materialism, Rationalism, 
Deism, and to some extent, Scepticism. Its inspiration 
arose from a number of influences not all of which came 
from within the churches. New discoveries in science 
captured the thinking minds. Men such as Leibnitz and Kant 
saw the possibilities of Jesus* teachings educating all 
mankind through the various agencies of human institutions. 
The influence which the church did exert came from among the 
lower clergy who, with a concern for people, organized 
Sunday Schools, day schools, sick clubs, clothing clubs, 
aim houses for widows and clerical education societies. By 
means of the new historical study of the Bible the teachings 
of Jesus were uncovered rather than dependant upon what 
people said.about him. Such things as the emergence of 
evolutionary thought, the practical influence of foreign

ana home missions, the enthusiasm for democratic principles 
the rapid industrial developments which improved up&n old 
methods of production contributed to the dynamic of the new 
social gospel. 

Chief among the exponents of the new social gospel was 
John Wesley whose Evangelical movements provided the 
inpetus for the improving of conditions of working men and 
women and children in ractories, the equalizing of wealth 
wherever possible, the breaking of the slave trade, the 
teaching of the young, the whole reorganization of the 
industrial system, the care of the aged, the sick ana the 
homeless, the concern for people in distant lands, the 
improvement of prisons, the fight against the liquor 
traffic and gambling and the desire for international peace 
Besides such noteable reformers as Wilberforce, important 
for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire, and 
Lord Shaftsbury, remembered for his reforms in prisons, 
asylums, lodging houses, health, sanitation, recreation, 
education, mines, factories and agriculture, were Maurice,

The need for a more effective impact upon society led 
to a closer cooperation among churches, denominations, 
local communities and nations. The most noteable example 
of this in Canada was the amalgamation of the Methodist, 
Presbyterian and Congregational Churches in 1925 which 
formed the United Church of Canada. To further the social 
influence of Christianity there have arisen such inter¬ 
denominational organizations as the Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., 
and broader and more inclusive still, organizations such 
as the International Missionary Council, International 
Council of Religious Education and International Council of 
Churches* 

Once more the social ideal of Christianity has come to 
the rore which has resulted in what we term now 'The Social 
Gospel * •

THE FIRST TRIBUTARY - THE METHODIST CHURCH 






Chapter II 


THE FIRST TRIBUTARY - THE METHODIST CHURCH 

No one can understand the social achievements of the 
United Church of Canada without an adequate appreciation of 
the labors and accomplishments of the Methodist, Presbyteriai 
and Congregational Churches. Exposed to many hardships and 
discouragements, the early Christian missionaries of these 
denominations laid the foundation of the social work which 
issued from the three churches and later the United Church. 

Methodism in Canada had its genisis in the last half 
of the eighteenth century and the first quarter of the 
nineteenth century as the result of (a) the coming of 
settlers directly from England, (b) the American Revolution 
(1776-1783), (c) the weir between England and France (1793- 
1815), (d) the Irish Rebellion (1798), and (e) the trying 
years (1812-1816) in the United States. On all these 
occasions did new settlers come into Canada. For example, 
an estimated 40,000 loyalists crossed into Canada from the 
United States during the American Revolution. Settlements 
sprang up in the Maritime Provinces, along the St. Lawrence 
River, the Bay of Quinte and in the Niagara Peninsula. 
Governors saw the need of churches to help to lay the 
foundations of the new colonies . Methodist missionaries

aecompanied these emigrants and began to preach and teach 
in the new settlements. The first missionary activity among 
the Indians was begun at this same time when the Mohawics, 
rearing the Americans after the civil war, came north to 
Canada and were granted some 700,000 acres of land along the 
Grand River inwhat was then known as the western part of 
Canada. 


The earliest Methodist enthusiast was Lawrence 
Coughlan, formerly an itinerate preacher in Ireland, who 
landed at Conception Bay, Newfoundland, in 1765 as a 
volunteer worker. 1 he conditions there were bad. The 
Sabbath day meant nothing; the marriage institution was 
regarded lightly, profanity, drinking and gambling existed 
everywhere. In all, morals were low. In addition people 
were poor and had no concern for anyone else but themselves. 
Here he saw a challenge. His work among these people became 
of such importance that in 1767 he was ordained a minister. 
He remained, exposed to much opposition and many hardships 
until 1773, when, due to ill health he returned to -England. 
He left behind him converts who carried on the work until 
far-reaching success. In 1775 John Hopkins, a school 
teacher from -England took up the missionary work where 
Coughlan left off, followed in turn by Rev. John Mc u eary 
in 1885. By 1804 there were in Newfoundland three Methodist

preachers and a membership of five hundred. 

The foundations for Methodism in Nova Scotia were laid 
by the Yorkshire Methodists who arrived between 1772 and 
1775 and settled in the Cumberland area. Politically they 
made a great contribution for they brought with them an 
attachment to British institutions which aided in the 
politics of the new land, .among the new settlers, who 
totalled about 12,000, were families from the north of 
Ireland, England, Germany and Switzerland. By 1783 
Shelbourne became the home of many of the Methodist faith 
from New York. Here such men as Kobert Barry, John and 
James Mann and Charles White made lasting contributions. In 
1785 Freeborn Garrettson and James Oliver Cromwell began 
their work, and in 1792 Stephen Bamford undertook his. By 
the year 1791 Nova Scotia had six preachers. 

The beginning of the work in New Brunswick may be 
traced back to 1783 and 1784 when the Loyalists arrived in 
Canada. With them came Stephen Humbert, a man prominent in 
political affairs, who stressed the importance of the 
Church’s work in the new province. In 1791 the first 
Methodist preacher, John Bishop, reached New Brunswick. 
However, a year prior to this, a layman, John McCall, 
established his headquarters at St. Stephen, and travelled

from settlement to settlement holding religious services 
wherever possible. By 1793 he was recognized as a Methodist 
itinerate, while in 1795 he was ordained into the ministry. 
During his fourty years service in New Brunswick along with 
his fellow preachers, he championed religious liberty. 

In 1767 Prince Edward Island was given by the British 
Government to a number of persons in reward for military and 
other services, ^he first service held on the Island was one 
of thanksgiving, led by Benjamin Chappell, a former 
associate of Wesley 1 s in England, who along with 250 others 
barely escaped death when shipwrecked off the coast. Williar 
Black, superintendent of the Methodist work in the Maritimes 
visited Prince Edward Island, 1783, but found conditions verj 
discouraging. Ignorance, profanity and degrading morals 
existed everywhere. It was not until 1791 that another 
minister visited the Island at which time Rev. William Grand j 
went across from Nova Scotia and stimulated a great 
religious revival. Volunteer workers followed, some of them 
being Joshua Newton from Halifax, x homas Dawson from 
Ireland, Joseph Avard from the Channel Islands. Ihe work 
grew so quickly that an appeal for Methodist ministers was 
sent forth. In response Rev. James Bulpit from Newfoundland 
arrived in 1807.

Mrs. Frederick Stephenson in her book, "One Hundred 

Years of Canadian Methodist Missions (1824-1924)", gives an 

encouraging account of the success of the work by 1855. 

"In 1855 the districts of New Brunswick, Prince 
Edward Island, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland were 
organized into a Weslyan Conference, affiliated 
with the British Conference, under the name, ’The 
Conference of Eastern British ivmerica’. With that 
Conference there were seventy circuits and missions, 

88 ministers; 102 local preachers, 222 chapels, 393 
preaching places, 1,162 day scholars, 91,114 Sunday 
school scholars, 11,136 members, and an estimated 
attendance of 65,690 at public worship."(l) 

In 1884 this conference was merged mtu a more comprehensive 

conference, known as the Methodist Church of Canada. 


It has been suggested that Methodism reached Quebec 
as early as 1759 at which time some lay preachers in General 
Wolfe’s army proclaimed the Gospel. However, this is more 
a probability than an absolute fact. We do know that an 
Irishman and local preacher by the name of Tuffy landed at 
Quebec in 1780 with the 44th regiment and immediately began 
preaching to tee godless soldiers, the neglected and care¬ 
less immigrants. Tuffy returned to Ireland three years 
later and no permanent work established, yet his influence 
proved extremely helpful, especially upon army personnel. 

x he first Methodist preacher in Lower Canada was

Lore nzo Low who arrived in 1799 from New York to carry on 
work along the southern border. In 1802 Joseph Sawyer came 
to Montreal, followed by Samuel Mervin in 1803 and Martin 
Ruter in 1804. In 1806 the Lower Canada District of the 
Methodist Church was formed. With Coate's arrival in Quebec 
in 1807, permanent work was established. The succeeding 
years saw new workers arrive, some being Jacob Heck, Peter 
Langlois, Sergeant Webster, as local preachers as well as 
several Wesleyian ministers. 

The first sign of Methodism in the wilderness of 
Upper Canada appeared in 1778 when Paul and Barbara Heck, wil 
their sons, Mr and Mrs. John Lawrence and David Embury 
settled at Augusta. In the new settlement these people 
assumed the leadership. In 1788 a young school teacher by tl 
name of Lyons established himself in the Bay of Quinte 
settlement. He discovered very distressing conditions — 
much ignorance, low morals, sin prevalent everywhere and no 
public worship. Immediately he set forth the Christian idea! 
in the school room, visited the parents with the hope of 
improving home conditions and began Sunday services. His 
labors proved extremely helpful to the settlers of that 
district, that same year James McCarty arrived in Upper 
Canada. William Losee followed in 1790 and entered the 
ministry the next year, thus being the first ordained ministe

in Upper Canada. In 1792 he built the first church in 
Upper Canada. 

While this work progressed in the Bay of ^uinte 
Settlement, Major George Neal gave of his energy and time in 
the Niagara district. The first ordained minister, Rev. 
Darius Dunham, however, did not come into this particular 
settlement until 1795. In 1799 Nathan Bangs began work in 
the Thames settlement. Wherever Bangs went the ignorance, 
loose morals, lack of appreciation for spiritual things 
caused him great concern. These were the conditions that 
existed not in one settlement but in almost every settlement 
in the new Canada. These were the conditions that challengec 
the pioneering spirit of the early Methodist workers. 

From the time that these earliest Christian enthus¬ 
iasts set foot upon Canadian soil they were faced with the 
task of bringing a new way of life to the Indians who did 
not know the white man’s language, customs nor his God. The 
Indians could neither read nor write; their food and clothing 
were crude; their houses were wigwams; their natures 
vicious at times. The missionaries never once hesitated to 
believe that by the aid of God these natives could be shown 
a more excellent way, helped and rescued from such 
cohditions. When the Indians did become Christians their ol<

way of life did not satisfy them. They wanted real homes, 
schools and churches. 

The work among the Indians was taken up on no small 
scale. The missionaries* field of labors extended from Old 
Canada to the Great Lakes, north around Lake Y/innipeg, across 
the prairies to the foothills of the Hockies, and beyond the 
mountains to the Pacific. 

As was the case among the white settlers, the work was 
begun among the Indians by volunteer workers and itinerate 
preachers. The earliest of such work began amongtt he 
Mohawk tribe along the Grand River, the beginning of the 
nineteenth century. Edmund Stoney, a shoemaker living near 
this tribe, was disturbed greatly by the deplorable state 
of the Indian settlement. As a result he began preaching to 
them and doing personal work among them. The Mohawk chief, 
Davis, opened his home for services. Soon several Indians 
had been converted. 

In 1823 another volunteer worker, Seth Crawford, came 
to Grand River. Here he devoted his life to the Christ¬ 
ianizing of the Indians. He taught their children, raised 
their standards of living, lifted their morals and 
increased their spiritual life. Many Indians, one of which 
was Peter Jones, in turn dedicated their lives to Christian

work, among their own people. The first Indian Methodist 
Church was built by Indian converts in 1824 in a Mohawk 
village on the Grand River Reserve. It was used for a day 
school, Sabbath school and preaching services. 

John Carey, his heart touched by the poverty, ignorance 
and heathen customs among the Mincey Indians, came to their 
settlement in 1824. The next year, Torry, hearing an appeal 
for help from Carey, came to his assistance. A school and 
church were built which meant much in the life of that 
Indian reserve. 

The Mississauga tribe, known for its paganism, beast¬ 
liness, drunkenness and filth, wandering about the shores of 
Lake Ontario, 1823-1824, came into contact with the Gospel 
for the first time at a Mohawk camp meeting. This roaming 
tribe, instructed by Peter Jones, learned how to clear and 
till the land and raise crops for themselves. 

Slowly, but successfully the work progressed. Drunken¬ 
ness, laziness and filth disappeared to a great extent. 
Indians, being influenced by the Gospel became sober, 
industrious and clean. Their lodging places, once dirty, 
dark and overcrowded,wigwams, became comfortable log houses. 
Pagan worship, magic and witchcraft ceased. Church attend¬ 
ance increased; children were sent to school; tribes, once

enemies, became friends. Numerous Indian converts became 
missionaries to their own people, showing and leading them 
into a more Christian way of life. Similar work continued 
among other tribes throughout Upper C a nada. Conferences 
were held, appeals made for more workers and financial aid; 
camp meetings proved successful; Indian work expanded. More 
schools and churches were built; the Bible and hymns were 
translated into the native tongue. 


Grape Island Industrial School in particular is worthy 

of note. Due to the labors of Slder Case, industrial work 

among the Grape Island Indians was undertaken. 

"They must be taught how to live. Mr. Benham, as 
manager and teacher, instructed the Indians and 
helped them in their first attempts at agriculture. 
Miss Barnes, in addition to the ordinary school 
work, taught sewing, knitting, straw-hat making 
and cooking. x he mothers were assisted in their 
home making and housekeeping as they changed from 
life in the wigwam to the possible comforts of 
settled living. They received valuable instruction 
regarding the care of children and the general 
health of the family. Houses with their well- 
kept gardens; comfort and joy in their homes; the 
absence of the Indian’s greatest temptation— 
intoxicating liquors; and the change in the 
general appearance of the people, made Grape 
Island famous. Miss Hubbard carried on the same 
work at Rice Lake as Miss Barnes was engaged in 
at Grape Island."(1) 


The work in Upper Canada expanded, reaching as far as 
Manitobaulin Island, Sault Ste. Marie, Fort William and 
along the south shore of Lake Superior.

The task of civilizing the Indians proved a very 
difficult one as their hunting grounds were transformed into 
farms by white settlers, while cities and towns sprang up. 

To aid in this task more industrial schools were built in 
which Indian boys were taught useful trades and methods, 
housekeeping, knitting, spinning, and a common English 
education for all. 

Throughout the remaining years of the nineteenth 
century the work expanded northward around the Hudson Bay 
and westward to the prairies. Again similar problems were 
faced, similar means of overcoming them attempted and 
similar results achieved. In these areas labored the Mc- 
Dougalls, Rundle, John Ryerson, Henry Steinhauer, Hurlburt, 
Brooking, John McClean. The coming of the North West 
Mounted Police and the Canadian Pacific Railway, the former 
in keeping law and order, the latter in enabling more 
settlers to journey westward, aided greatly the work of the 
missionaries. Wherever possible churches were erected, day 
schools and boarding schools built, hospitals opened and 
farming encouraged. Winnipeg, Brandon, Norway House, 
Edmonton, Lac La Biche, White Fish Lake, Oxford House, 

Nelson House, Rocky Mountain House, Red Deer, Morley were 
among the centres of such activities.

activities in Alberta is Robert Rundle. He labored in 

Alberta for eight years (1840-1848). The fruit of his labors 

may be exemplified in the case of the ramed Cree chief, 

Maskepetoon wno was a crutal warrior when Rundle first met 

him. Influenced by the missionary’s life and teaching, he 

became a peace-loving Indian. After his conversion the 

Blackfeet tribe murdered Maskepetoon’s father and several of 

his friends. While the Cree tribe desired revenge, 

Maskepetoon refused to go to war. Some years later when he 

and his tribe were encamped near what is not Wetaskiwin, a 

group of Blackfeet Indians passing by on their way to Fort 

Edmonton asked for a truce. 

"He called for his best horse to be brought; then 
he summoned the murderer to come before him, and 
as he stood in great fear, Maskepetoon said, ’You 
killed my father. The time was when I would have 
your blood, but that is past, You need not fear. 

You must now ride my horse and wear my clothes. 

You must be a father to met’ Then the Blackfoot 
cried, ’You have killed me my son’,"(l) 


Again a similar tale may be told of the work among the 
British Columbia Indians. The first work was begun in 1859 
by twelve volunteers who went to British Columbia to open 
missions for prospectors, miners, Indians and new settlers. 
The conditions among the Indians were appauling as elsewhere.

"There were those who boasted of having stood 
ankle deep in the blood of their enemies; others 
who had seen almost whole bands either killed or 
taken captive; medicine men who held in terror all 
with whom they came into contact; dog feasts where 
dogs were eaten and where human corpses were devoured, 
slavery and witchcraft with their cruelty and 
torture; helpless old people left to starve and to 
die on lonely islands or in desert camps; wars that 
either killed or made captive all the enemy; 
whiskey drinking by meh, women and children with 
death following every debauch; no privacy of home 
life; women held as chattels to be sold or bartered; 
potlatching and debasing ceremonies; nothing in 
Paul’s description of heathenism was omitted in 
the practice of the Coast Indians."(1) 

Strong appeals were sent out for missionaries to go to the 

western coast and help to improve the standards of living by 

means of the Christian Gospel. A fine response followed. 

Among the missionaries journeying to British Columbia were 

W. H. Price, ^homas Crosby, Charles M. Tate, Rev. A. B. Russ« 

It was not long before others, possessed of the spirit of 

Christ made their northward journey, both in the interior anc 

along the coast. Into those distant and lonely spots they 

carried the Christian teachings, administered medical aid, 

established places of learning and raised the moral 

standards. 


The noteworthy achievements in this province consisted 
of the building of Indian Schools and the medical work. 

At Chilliwack, under the capable direction of Mr. and Mrs.

Tate, the Coqualeetza Institute was opened in 1886. Since 
the year of its opening the Institute was successful in 
winning many prizes at provincial exhibitions. In 1891 the 
Simpson Boys 1 Home was established. Then followed the 
Kitamast Home in 1893. 


Prevalent among the Indians was much uncleanliness, 
epidemics of measles, scarlet fever and influenza. Due to 
the lack of medical aid, sickness, sorrow and death, came to 
the homes of both Indians and missionaries. Doctors were 
needed urgently. 1 he first medical missiorary, Or. Bolton, 
arrived at Port Simpson in 1889. He found it his task to 
visit the fishing villages along the coast and give medical 
aid to as many as possible, regardless of several limitations 
Here are his own words: 

W I have treated over fifty-fpur hundred patients. 

A great deal of suffering has been relieved, and 
perhaps some lives saved; but lack of proper means 
cripples us in the work. So ma ny surgical cases 
need antiseptic operations and dressing, with 
warmth and good air; other cases need care and 
food such as they cannot have in their homes. In 
cases of visiting patients, I have had as many as 
a dozen here at one time, all lodged in tents on 
the beach; or, a little better, roofed in by the 
guest house of the Hudson Bay Company."(1) 

Plans were laid for the building of a hospital which 

reached completion in 1892. The Woman’s Missionary Society 

supplied nurses. Grants were received from the Dominion 

and Provincial Governments. Contributions and gifts came in

from Indians, white patients, friends and even from the 
missionaries themselves. Soon branch hospitals were 
established, one at Essington in 1895, another at Rivers 
Inlet in 1897. That same year ^r. J. A. Jackson went to 
Bella Bella, succeeded by Dr. R. W. Large the following year. 
In 1902 the first hospital at Bella Bella was erected. 

The medical work proceeded not without difficulties. 

Dr. Large found tubercolosis a strong enemy. He overcame 
this to a great extent by means of lecturing, practical 
advice and education. Witchcraft, Indian medicine, witch 
doctors, superstition and fear proved huge stumbling blocks 
to the application of medical science. s the coast area 
opened up more hospitals were built at Rock Bay, Van Anda, 
Alert Bay and Prince Rupert. By 1900 the interior was 
blessed with similar work indebted for its beginning to 
Dr. and Mrs. Wrinch at Kishpiax. The work spread to Hazel- 
ton where a hospital was opened in 1904, and thence to other 
centres. In these areas Indians, trappers, prospectors, 
miners, Hudson Bay employees and travellers all benefited 
greatly from the services which the doctors and nurses by 
means of their hospitals and medical knowledge stood ready 
to offer. 

The progress of the work must be determined not by the

heights which the Indians have attained but by the depths 
from which they have come. The period of adjustment was a 
difficult one for them due to illiteracy, industrial back¬ 
wardness, isolation and limitations of reserve life, power oj 
tribal laws and customs and the harmful influence upon them 
by many of the white people. 


The Church and Government cooperated in the Indian 
work. The Government saw the need of schools and education, 
medical aid and hospitals. Appropriations by the government 
were given, the first in 1870. The following extract from 
the report of the Department of Indian Affairs for the year 
ending 1924 portrays vividly the educational work carried on 
by the Government in cooperation with the Methodist and othei 
denominations: 

"The training of the younger generation of Indians 
continues to be one of the important activities of 
the Department of Indian Affairs. Closer association 
wjth the four churches actively engaged in the work 
has resulted in better and more standardized 
maintenance and instruction for the 13,872 Indian 
children that were enrolled during the year. There 
was a record parliamentary appropriation for -Indian 
education of $1,943,702. 

Larger appropriations have permitted the replacement 
of old equipment and the engagement of better 
qualified teachers. 

During the past fiscal year 5,673 Indian children 
were maintained and educated in the residential 

schools.An awakened interest in education 

on the part of Indian communities has resulted in 
more applications for admission to residential

schools, ... Indian children throughout Canada 

are studying more advanced work than in the past,"(l) 

In order to combat diseases, especially tubercolosis, 
the government aids the church in every possible way by 
providing funds, helping to give the Indians a knowledge of 
disease and suggesting methods of prevention. 

As a result of the successful work that is carried on 

by the Methodist Church among the Indians the time came when 

the government could grant special rights and privileges to 

them which was impossible in previous years. An indication 

of the progressive development among the Indians was the 

granting of the privilege to elect a council on many of the 

reserves instead of following the old practice of hereditary 

chiefs. A good example of this was found on the Six Nations 

Reserve, Brant County, Ontario. Here in 1924 a council was 

elected by ballot, with every male over twenty-one years of 

age eligible to vote. Said Lt. Col. Morgan: 

"This change is the turning point in the history of 
the Iroquois nation; it is the change from paganism 
and lack of progress to Christianity and better 
things among the Six Nations Indians."(2) 

In 1920 the Indians Enfranchisement Act was passed 
which provided:

1. That any Indian may apply for enfranchisement. The 
application will be considered by a committee composed 
of a representative of the band of which the Indian is 
a member, a local Government representative and the 
Minister of Indian Affairs. 

2. That any band may apply for enfranchisement through its 
Elected Council, ■-‘■he whole matter of enfranchisement 
must be put before the band and all eligible to vote 

in electing the Council shall vote by ballot as to 
whether enfranchisement will be applied for."(l) 


By 1924, 1,124 Indians were enfranchised. 

throughout the Dominion the Indians are grouped 
into agencies, with an agent for each, ihe staff 
of an agency usually includes various officers in 
addition to the agent, su^n as the medical officer, 
clerk, farm instructor, field matron, constable, 
stockman, etc*, according to the special requirements 
of the agency in question. At many of the smaller 
agencies in older provinces where the xndians are 
more advanced, the work is comparatively light, 
requiring only the services of an agent. The work 
of the agencies is supervised by the Department 
inspectors, each inspector having charge of a 
certain number of agencies."(2) 


The social work of the Methodist Church in the cities 

has been an important factor in the life of Canada. In the 

cities two distinct types of work developed -- "The 

Institutional Church" and "The Mission". According to 

Edward ludson the former: 

"is an organized body of Christian believers who, 
finding themselves in a hard and uncongenial social 
environment, supplement the ordinary methods of 
the gospel, such as preaching, prayer meetings,

Sunday schools and pastoral visitation, by a system 
of organized kindness, a congeries of institutions, 
which by touching people on physical, social and 
intellectual sides will conciliate them and draw 
them within reach of the gospel."(1) 

Many churches developed institutional features which varied 

from a small club room to a well-organized building. 

The Mission was established in a poor section of a 
city to help the needy. In every city the needs were great. 
For example in Toronto there existed large areas of un¬ 
churched masses, drunkenness and gambling, social vice and 
filth, poverty and huge slum areas where children’s play¬ 
ground was the street. These conditions were prevalent 
among many of the new Canadians. The other side of society 
failed to see the needs. Facilities were needed urgently to 
aid in overcoming these conditions and to counteract the 
influence of the existing evils. Those possessed of a 
vision saw too the needs of caring for and training children 
besides that which they received in their homes. As a resull 
there sprang up the Missions, the institutional churches 
and social settlements. 

Serving such groups of people, Fred Victor Mission 
Society, Toronto, and All People’s Mission, Winnipeg, were 

the most notable, heading rooms, gymnasiums, manual training

and athletic clubs for the boys, kitchen garden, gymnasium, 
cooking school, junior and senior clubs, serving classes, 
elocution and Bible classes for the girls were provided. 

The Fred Victor Mission with its many and varied activities 
for the young included also an inquiry office and employment 
bureau, large and capable staff, mothers 1 meetings with 
their profitable conversation, instructing in sewing, sale 
of clothing and fuel at reasonable prices, visitations, 

Gospel wagon and extensive correspondence. 

With a slight difference in method and people whom it 
served, all People’s Mission, Winnipeg, carried on just as 
effective work. Controlled by the Methodist City Mission 
Board, Winnipeg, its organization consisted of three 
churches, four institutes or neighborhood houses, three 
homes and a large staff including the superintendent, one 
ordained minister, eight deaconesses, three theological 
students, four kindergartens, one director of boys 1 work, twc 
students in training abroad, two young women in training, twc 
caretakers and about one hundred volunteer workers from 
Wesley College, Methodist Churches and the city generally. 

The departments of work included a kindergarten, girls 
social and educational classes and clubs, boys social and 
educational classes and clubs, gymnasium and baths, librarie* 
night schools, concerts and lectures, people’s Sunday

meetings, women’s meetings, men’s associations, relief, 
friendly visiting, immigration chaplancy, religious service 
cooperation with other social agencies, investigation, 
publicity, training workers, assisting other churches and 
an experimental station. 

These are two examples of what the Methodist Church 
undertook in the large centres of the Dominion during the 
years previous to church union. 

Within the Methodist Church Boards and Committees were 
formed and conferences held to deal more effectively with 
social ills, namely the liquor traffic, commercialized 
amusement, venereal diseases, inadequate child care, 
jeuvenile delinquency, feeble-minded, indecent books and 
pictures, political impurity, industrial unrest, broken 
homes, divorce and racial hatred. 

At the General Conference of 1902, in Winnipeg, the 
Department of Temperance, Prohibition and Moral Reform was 
organized. Each annual conference elected a standing 
committee on Temperance and Moral Reform to oversee the 
work within that conference. It was to offer suggestions, 
bring about definite action and report both to the annual 
Conference and General Conference Board. The Temperance 
Committee of each annual Conference nominated for each

district a District Temperance Secretary who would give 
direction, inspiration and assistance in the work of the 
Department throughout the district. The Quarterly Official 
Board on each circuit also appointed a committee on 
Temperance, Prohibition and Moral Reform to have general 
oversight of that work within the bounds of the circuit. 0n< 
and sometimes two or three Field Secretaries were employed 
who were to devote their time to the entire field. They 
were to travel from place to place, give guidance and 
information and strengthen the work of the Department by 
connecting the local work with head office. Besides these, 
specialists in moral and social reform were employed when 
the need arose. At the General Conference of 1915 the Dep¬ 
artment of Temperance, Prohibition and Moral Reform was 
changed to the "Department of Social Service". The work of 
this Department and that of Evangelism were brought together 
to form the Department of Evangelism and Social Service 
which remained until the time of Union. 


These workers carried on with the thought that: 

"All the woes of perdition lurk in the bar room. 
All that conspires against decency of living, 
peace at home, good of country, progress in 
achievement, honor in men, purity in women, and 
hope in humanity has there its haunt. Ruin writes 
its record. Despair and death are the closing 
chapters ... One institution which outrages the 
divine law of love will never obey the policy

regulations of men. Inherently evil, it cannot 
be reformed. It must, therefore, be destroyed. 

Our purpose is its extinction; our battle cry, 
Emancipation’" 

One means of striving towards total abstinence in 
the Dominion was by means of the Pledge—signing 
campaigns which they introduced in churches, Sunday 
schools and young peoples’ organizations, the 
members of which were to pledge themselves to avoid 
such evil conduct as drunkenness, buying or selling 
spiritous liquors, or drinking them. J-he Methodist 
Church sought to banish intoxicating liquors from 
the land, both by discouragement of its use and the 
prohibition of its manufacture, importation and 
sale. They continually emphasized the evils it 
caused. 

Besides all the sad havoc caused by strong drink 
to the individual, in the destruction of physical 
constitution, moral conscience, intellectual 
conceptions and spiritual concern, and to the home 
in the ruin of its love, its comforts and its 
happiness, there are unanswerable reasons from 
science, commerce and industry, as well as the 
community and national effects of the legalized 
liquor traffic, which must compel every intelligent 
person to renounce forever all beverage use of 
intoxicating liquors.”(1) 


it was the desire of the Methodist Church to invest¬ 
igate the existing legislation in every province and conduct 
campaigns for improved legislation to combat the liquor 
traffic. The department gave careful attention to complaint.* 
of violation of the License or Temperance Laws in every 
province, investigating them and, if sufficient evidence was 
gathered which proved that the law had not been adhered to j 

it saw to it that the suspected parties were convicted and

punished. The Church emphasized no less the abolishing of 
the sale of liquor in militia camps. The department exerted 
every bit of influence possible in the Local Option 
campaign within the communities across Canada and urged the 
citizens of every municipality to seek earnestly to bring 
Local Option into effect. 

In commercialized recreation and amusement the Church 
encouraged that which was of good and discouraged that which 
was of evil for both adults and children, as it realized 
that this part of an individual’s life determined to a great 
extent his moral character and social behaviour. Proper 
supervision of playgrounds, public baths and all places of 
amusement was stressed. The theatre, a great influential 
institution upon Canadian life should be clean, uplifting, 
moral and wholesome. In many instances, on investigation, 
this was not found to be the case for vulgarity, filth, 
suggestiveness, immorality, seemed to be the dominant notes. 
Appeals were made to the Moral and Social Reform Council of 
Canada to investigate theatre conditions, and they in turn 
to urge the Federal authorities to impose a censorship upon 
all theatres. 

The Church recognized its duty in defending the 
Sabbath as a day of rest. To this end, the Lord’s Day 
Alliance was meeting with considerable success. The Church

heart ily recommended the Lord*s Day Alliance to its people. 

Gambling was nothing less than a tragedy for by it 

splendid youth all over the land ended in complete ruin. In 

no uncertain terms did the church denounce gambling, 

especially that at the race tracks. Here is the general 

feeling expressed at the annual meeting of the Board of the 

Department of Temperance, Prohibition and Moral Reform, 1912: 

"This Board, realizing the immence importance of 
immediate effort to secure most necessary ammend- 
ments to the criminal code with reference to race 
track gambling, and having sympathetic resolutions 
from all our annual conferences, most strongly 
commends this campaign and directs our officers to 
heartily cooperate in every possible way."(l) 

Canada was one of twenty-one nations to sign an inter¬ 
national treaty to carry on a war against prostitution. 
Therefore, the Methodist Church, in cooperation with other 
organizations and churches, resolved to intensify her war¬ 
fare against the same evil. There was the need for educatior 
along the lines of social purity. The Church urged fathers, 
mothers and teachers to abandon the method of silence in 
regard to sex, but warn and educate children to take a 
healthy and clean attitude rather than for them to learn by 
means of vile ways on the streets. Helpful pamphlets, 
magazines and books were published. The method of preventior 
was recognized as being superior to that of cure. A series

Purity Conventions were held in many centres throughout the 
Dominion* Careful investigation of existing conditions were 
promoted. Interviews were held with the municipal, 
provincial and Federal authorities urging them to amend the 
criminal code wherever it would aid in safeguarding girls 
and women. 

Many encouraging results were obtained by redemptive 
work spomsored by the Church. This was not done so much by 
the erection of large institutions but rather by securing 
furnished redemptive homes in some of the large cities to 
which girls and women in sore need were brought, given 
medical, moral and spiritual help, then placed under the car? 
of Christian women who would be to them as mothers or friend* 
When a time was thought fit these women were allowed to 
start life over again in self-respect and self-support. A 
similar method was employed in dealing with venereal 
diseases. 

The Church, after it investigated the conditions of 
children, especially in the cities, and discovered the 
appalling infant mortality throughout the whole of the 
Dominion, resolved on several occasions to recommend to 
and cooperate with the Federal and Provincial Governments to 
further child welfare, to establish a juvenile court in

eve ry Canadian city, and to build industrial homes for 
delinquent and feeble minded children. For example the 
mortality rate ifi Toronto of infants under one year old for 
1908 was 191.4 and for 1909 was 220 in every 1000 births. 

The enormous death rate in most cities was due to unhealthy 
surroundings such as dirt, squalor and misery in the home of 
the child. The Methodist Church urged its people to take a 
practical interest in these conditions and to remedy them. 
Further, the Board of Moral Reform of the Methodist Church 
cooperated with the Presbyterian Board of Social Service in 
this very work. The building of institutions was advocated 
arid achieved to a great extent. This undertaking included 
such institutions as The Maritime House for girls located at 
Truro, Nova Scotia, The Childrens Home and Day Nursery in 
connection with Earlscourt Church, Toronto, and the Edmonton 
Social Service Home. 


In the realm of politics the Church urged upon its 
members: 

"the duty of opposing electoral corruption in every 
form and of maintaining the following principles: 

1. It is the duty of every citizen thoughtfully and 
seriously to discharge the full responsibility of 
citizenship. 

2. The law of righteousness, which is recognized as 
imperative in the business and spiritual world, 
rules also in the sphere of politics. The assumption 
of a double standard must be repudiated.

3. The interest of the nation is supreme, it should not 
be subordinated to party, sectional or selfish 
considerations. 

4. The ballot is sacred. The franchise is a solemn 
trust, not to be bought and sold, but to be exercised 
as a civic responsibility and as in God's sight. 

We also suggest that all pastors deal with this 
subject in their pulpits at appropriate seasons."(1) 

In seeking a solution for the industrial and economic 
problems such as industrial unrest and unequal distribution 
of wealth, the Church stressed and supported fraternal co¬ 
operation. On the other hand it opposed anything tending 
toward a social collectivism which freed the individual from 
his definite personal responsibility to God on the grounds 
that it was injurious to the moral basis of civil society. 
Self-adjustment, self-inspection, self-control were needed 
as much as actual laws. 

The protection of the home and the solemnization of 
marraige was a significant part of the church*s emphasis. 

To this end it cooperated in full with the government. 

Within the church a Brotherhood movement was formed, 
the meetings of which were social, practical and helpful. 

The speakers and members did not attempt to change the socia 
pattern without the action of the state, thus they found it

necessary to link themselves with national organizations. 

The Brotherhood groups contributed greatly to the working 
force of the Church in both urban and rural areas. 

Nor were the women of the Methodist Church idle. 
Organized as the V/oman’s Missionary Society, they exerted a 
tremendous influence in the applying of remedies for social 
problems and contributed greatly in stimulating interest, 
giving financial aid and actual constructive work. They 
assisted in the financing and operating of French Methodist 
Schools as for example, the Drench Methodist Institute, 
Montreal, and the Protestant Home for French children. The 
Methodist Orphanage, St. Johns, Newfoundland, was in part 
their responsibility. In addition, their energies extended 
to the Chinese Rescue Home for girls at Victoria, British 
Columbia, All People’s Mission, Winnipeg, Galacian Mission 
at Pakan in northern Alberta, the Italian Mission in Toronto. 
Among the women of this vast organization were such names as 
Mrs. James Gooderham, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Strachan, all o: 
whom were devoted members of the Society. They recognized 
its grand possibilities and helped in many ways to give the 
W.M.S. form and life. 

In 1907 the energies of the Social Service Department 
of the Methodist Church were brought into a harmonious union

with similar departments of other denominations in Canada 
to form the Social Service Council of Canada. Thus through 
united efforts the influence of Christianity was brought to 
bear upon every moral issue involving the Canadian citizen*

Chapter III 


THE SECOND TRIBUTARY, - THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 











Chapter III 


THE SECOND TRIBUTARY - THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 

The Presbyterian Church was equally as great as the 
Methodist Church in its social endeavours. It also sought 
to enter every open field of service to the Canadian people* 
The task undertaken by both churches was a common one. The 
achievements of both were more the result of cooperative 
rather than isolated efforts. 

The Presbyterian uhurch of Canada owes its origin to 
several streams, the earliest of which came from Prance 
during the early years of the seventeenth century. The 
French Hugenots who settled in Acadia and later in Quebec 
promoted this stream of influence. From Holland and Germany 
in 1749 came a large number of German-speaking Presbyterians 
who settled in iNl ova Scotia. Following the American Revol¬ 
ution a similar group which belonged to the United Empire 
Loyalists, crossed the border into Canada and made their 
homes primarily in the eastern part of Upper Canada. The 
more dominant elements of Presbyterianism consisted of the 
Scottish and Irish who came both directly to Canada and 
indirectly by way of the United States. Missionary activity 
undertaken by American Presbyterians of Scottish and Irish 
origin were numerous both before and after the Revolution.

In several areas in Canada congregations of American origin 
sprang up and flourished, 

Ey the beginning of the eighteenth century the 
missionary activity expanded. ±he results achieved were 
similar to those of the Methodist Churcn. Little time 
passed before schools were opened in which the children 
learned grammar and the alphabet, and later courses of 
University standard. By 1775 Presbyterianism had been 
established sufficiently that it became nationally organized 
Notable among the missionaries were such men as Dr. 

MacGregor who arrived at Pictou, Nova Scotia, in 1795 and 
Dr. Thomas McCulloch who came to Pictou in 1803. 

The pioneering spirit which captured the hearts of men 
and women caused a great migration westward. The laying of 
the Canadian Pacific Railway aided in this as it opened up 
new agricultural land. Por example, during the first 
fifteen years of our present century 3,000,000 immigrants 
made Canada their home. The Church assisted the new 
Canadians to overcome the social, economic, moral and 
spiritual perils of their new environment. 

In the Maritime provinces the work progressed steadily, 
By 1875 fifty-three missionaries were at work, including 36 
catechists for -English and Gaelic. Eighteen years later

ordained fields numbered 21, student fields 51* The work 
expanded until by 1903 there were 34 ordained fields and 
47 student fields, and in 1924, 46 ordained charges. 

The industrial and railway cities created problems of 
their own. As a partial remedy community houses were est¬ 
ablished by and through which the Church might exert its 
influence. The one in Sydney was a good example. 

At the same time French Evangelization, under a 
separate Board until 1912, constituted part of the mission¬ 
ary enterprise. The French Canadian Society was formed in 
Montreal in 1839 and reported 50 active stations in 1845. 

In 1876 a Mission House was established in Montreal and in 
1877 a French Church was opened. 

In Ontario the work consisted chiefly of lumbermens 
missions. Into the lumber camps went the missionaries as 
did Joseph Gardner and Allan Findlay. Here they found 
Italians, Greeks and Scandinavians with their problems of 
readjustment. 

The new settlers upon the prairies, their constant 
conflict with the Indians and isolation from what was then 
the civilized and eastern part of Canada created an urgent 
need for socially-minded churchmen. In 1851 John Black

re sponded to the call* Upon the prairies he labored for 
thirty years until his death. Many others soon followed 
before the turn of the century, some of whom were James 
Nesbet, John MacKay, George Flett, Hugh McKellar, B. 
Baird, D. G. McQueen, Dr. James Robertson, J. C. Herdman, 

J. H. Cameron, John Herald and Charles McKillop. 

The Rockies proved no barrier for adventurers in 
search of gold, nor were they to hinder the missionary. 

Among the first sent out by the Presbyterian Church was 
John Hall who in 1861 began work in Victoria. Thomas 
Somerville succeeded him in 1865 and he in turn was 
succeeded by Donald Fraser in 1884. The Church responded to 
the call of the Klondike. It sent such men as R. M. Dickey, 
John Pringle and A. S. Grant. The people among whom they 
labored represented many nationalities and creeds. 

In order to grasp a picture of the development of the 
missionary enterprise it might be well to note a few 
figures. In 1875 there were 169 mission fields in the 
western section and 53 in the eastern section. The most 
rapid expansion of the work west of the Great Lakes took 
place during the period in which Dr. Robertson was serving 
in this area, 1881-1902, and the years immediately following 
his death. In 1913, the year in which the Home Mission work

reached its peak, 1,150 fields received aid. Since that 
year a decrease was noticeable due to similar activities by 
other denominations. 

Until 1907 all activities in the realm of Social and 
Moral reform were included amont the duties of the Home 
Mission Board. In that year the Department of Temperance anc 
other Moral and Social Reforms was organized. In 1911, its 
name was changed to read: T, The Board of Social Service and 
Evangelism". In 1915 it amalgamated with the Home Mission 
Board but retained the combined title, "Board of Home 
Missions and Social Service". 

The missionary work among the Indians undertaken by 
the Presbyterian Church was not as extensive as that carried 
on by the Methodist Church. Most notable among the Indian 
missionaries of the Presbyterian Church was James Evans, ^t 
Norway House, Manitoba, he introduced his syllabic alphabet 
which enabled the Indians to read for the first time. Later 
the characters were adjusted to other Indian languages. The 
use of this new alphabet contributed greatly to the 
education of the Indians. 

The chief mission to the natives of Canada consisted 
of Residential and Day Schools which exerted a great civil¬ 
izing influence upon the Indians. The Government assisted

these schools by providing financial aid* in several cases 
buildings were erected by the government. Some of the farms 
in connection with the schools were owned by the government, 
and a rarrn instructor provided where such was necessary. 


Up to 1919 the chief Indian boarding schools consisted 

Df: 

1. Cecelia Jeffrey School with an enrollment of 68. 

Here the Indians showed good progress. 

2. Portage Boarding School which possessed good 
buildings, adequate equipment and a farm and 
garden. 84 pupils were enrolled and satisfactory 
work carried on in all departments. 

3. File Hill. 66 pupils were enrolled and progress good 

4. Crowstand opened in December 1916, with an enrollment 
of 29 pupils. 

5. Round Lake produced an excellent report, a farm 
instructor was obtained from the government, bars 
and liquor stores closed, improvement made on the 
Indian homes and farms and much loyalty shown to 
the Empire. 

6. The Indian work on the west coast consisted of two 
Boarding Schools, Alberni and Ahausaht, and a mission 
with a day school at Ucluelet. In 1918 the school 

at Round Lake was enlarged and improved. By 1920 
Indian work flourished at 20 different centres with 
approximately 600 children enrolled in seven boarding 
schools and five day schools. In addition the 
church ministered in part to 40 reserves with about 
4,500 Indians under its care. 

Responsible to a great extent for these undertakings 
was the Women’s Missionary Society which provided much 
clothing for the Indians, financial aid to the schools and

the securing of volunteer labor. 

The task of caring for the immigrants steadily- 
mounted each year when, for a short interval, the number 
decreased. During the nineteenth century and the first eight 
years of our present century the greater percentage of new 
Canadians settled in the eastern provinces. By 1909 fifty 
per cent of the immigrants were pushing westward. The 
majority of these new Canadians who took up residence in 
industrial cities, mining towns, lumber camps and on farms 
had little or no connection with a Christian organization. 

The Presbyterian Church undertook an active campaign by means 
of which it sought to improve upon the social and religious 
life of the community. By means of immigration chaplains anc 
volunteer workers of the Stranger 1 s Department all newcomers 
who claimed to be Presbyterians and those adhering to no 
religion were met at the time of arrival, interviewed and 
aided in adjusting themselves to their new surroundings. If 
possible they were given an interest in some church organ¬ 
ization. For example, in 1915 Rev. Jno. Chisholiji, in charge 
of a Mission in Montreal, met all boats coming into that 
city and reported 380 names for the year. In 1913, for the 
whole of Canada, 10,897 new citizens were visited by 
representatives of a congregation and welcomed to a church 
home. For 1914 the figures indicate 4,372; for 1915, 226;

for 1916, 339. 

The chief nationalities represented by the immigrants 
were Syrian, Jewish, Polish, Slavic, Hungarian, Ukrainian, 
French, Italian, Norwegian and Swedish. Numerous activities 
were sponsored to better their conditions in the cities such 
as'Mission Houses, Institutes and Settlements which, at the 
outset, were few in number and extremely inadequate. The 
three most important institutions of this nature were locatec 
at Montreal, Toronto, and Winnipeg. According to the Social 
°ervice Report given at the General Assembly in 1917, these 
institutions had achieved encouraging results. Chalmers 
House, Montreal, reported 25 different forms of ministry, 
including clubs for all ages, classes, social and religious 
meetings, 652 on the roll, 320 families touched, 1,250 
individuals touched, an average monthly attendance of 4,300 
and the number of nationalities eight. Of the people served 
eight percent were Hebrews, seven percent Roman Catholic 
and eighty percent Protestants. 

Although the location and facilities of St. Christophe] 
House, Toronto, were inadequate and unfit, its reports 
sounded a note of encouragement. 44 different forms of 
ministry were reported, 660 members, 500 families touched, 
1,800 individuals touched, average monthly attendance of 
5,018 and 14 nationalities represented.

The same year Hobertson Memorial Institute, Winnipeg, 
reported 25 forms of ministry, 641 members, 450 families 
touched, 2,000 individuals touched, average monthly attend¬ 
ance of 5,958 and 15 nationalities represented. Some of the 
notable features of the report are worthy of mentiom: 

1. The growth of the English Mothers’ Club means a 
fuller realization that the institute is for all, 
and not just for ’foreigners*. It means that the 
children of these English mothers are coming to 
our various clubs and classes, and this tends to 
overcome class or national distinctions in the 
district. 

2* There has been a most noticeable improvement in 

the disposition of the boys who have been attending 
the institute. 

3. In the homes of the girls who have attended the 
cooking classes the mothers are taking an increasing 
interest in the work of their daughters and under 
the direction of the girls, following the recipes 

of the wholesome and simple dishes taught in the 
class. 

4. another encouraging feature has been the gaining of 
the confidence of some of the parents who were not 
in sympathy with the work. Neighborhood nights have 
helped in this, also the interest taKen by their 
children in play school, club work, sewing classes, 
etc. (1) 


The Vancouver Community House was established more 
recently and the work carried on in connection with First 
Church. In 1919 it reported 16 kinds of ministry, 124 
families touched, 240 members and 13 nationalities.

Since the migration of East Indians to British 
Columbia and the sufferings undergone by the first mis¬ 
guided immigrants of this class (1903), mission work among 
the East Indians was carried on in Victoria, Vancouver and 
Eraser River Points. In all centres the work met with much 
success. However, by 1925 the mission activities among the 
East Indians had dwindled due to the decline in their 
number to less than 1,000. 

The Stranger’s Department of the Woman’s Missionary 
Society adopted two methods which proved successful — work 
amongst domestics, and hospital visitation. In large centres 
the Women’s Missionary Society, through its various organ¬ 
izations provided special classes for servant girls, and a 
social life under the oversight of interested women. In 
their hospital work the W.M.S. not only visited the women 
when sick, but called upon the patients in their homes later 
and tried to attach them to some church. 

The Presbyterian Church placed a greater emphasis upon 
education. As a result, schools under church supervision 
sprang up in areas inhabited by new Canadians. Schools 
were built for the French Canadians such as the one at Hull, 
Quebec, costing $6,000 and at which 35 children received 
training during 1918. The same year at the Point Aux

Trembles school 24 pupils won scholarships. Examples of 
further educational undertakings are seen in the opening of 
school houses at Sault Ste. Marie, Copper Cliff, Ontario; 
Sifton, Manitoba; Canora, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan; 
Vegreville, Vermilion, Edmonton, alberta for boys and girls 
of foreign nationalities. 

The Italian school, Sault Ste. Marie, organized in 
1914, reported an enrolment of 75 pupils and three organized 
clubs by 1920. At u opper Cliff the yearly program consisted 
of vocational schools, Sunday schools, summer schools, 
gatherings and institute work. By 1918 the school at 
Sifton, under church supervision, still in it3 early stages, 
accommodated 4 boys and 8 girls. The year 1917 marked the 
opening of two new Homes, an entirely new one at Vermilion 
for boys, and the other a new building with increased 
accommodation for girls at Vegreville. The- latter reported 
52 pupils enrolled. Rev. James McIntosh, superintendent of 
the Boys* School Home at Prince Albert reported that the 
boys were taking a foremost place in the various branches of 
study. Many of them made as high as one hundred percent 
in their classes. At Canora the "Waddell" Home for girls 
was characterized by its cosmopolitan nature. Swedish, 
Polish, Norwegians, Canadians and Hungarians attended. Both 
a Boys* Home and a Girls* Horae were opened in Edmonton. The 
latter served chiefly the French girls.

A similar educational program was undertaken in 
connection with the missions and institutes of the larger 
cities. The children of foreign-born parents were urged to 
attend schools or educational groups. In all these homes 
and educational centres the spiritual side too was emphasized 
The Church was extremely grateful to the Women’s Missionary 
Society which assisted by providing funds and workers. 

The condition of girls, especially in the cities, 
disturbed the socially-conscious Presbyterian Church. The 
number of girls giving birth to illegitimate children 
mounted each year. Many girls became social outcasts and 
ended their lives in prostitution. The Church undertook 
redemptive as well as preventative work among girls. The 
first organized work of this sort was begun in 1912. 
Redemptive homes were opened in Sydney, Montreal, Toronto, 
Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver. In addition private homes 
were opened by women because of their interest in the needs 
of such girls. There was another institution, "The 
Maritime Home for Girls" at Truro, an Industrial School and 
Home in one, which unlike the Redemptive Homes obtained 
legal status as a penal institution. Girls who were 
delinquent, neglected and homeless were placed in it by 
magistrates, Juvenile court judges or superintendents of 
dependent and delinquent children. In 1916 twenty-one girls

were cared for in this home, while up to that time thirty- 
in all had entered it. 

The redemptive work progressed steadily. 'The girls 
received common school education, industrial training, house¬ 
hold science, gardening, care of poultry and religious 
instruction. 268 girls during 1915 were cared for in the 
homes besides 114 privately given help and 30 in the 
Maritime Home at Truro. This made a total of 1,132 since the 
work began in 1912. In addition 98 babies or children 
found shelter in the Homes. Of the girls cared for in the 
six homes during three years (1912-15), 87 were Canadians, 
111 other Eritish and 36 other nationalities. 200 were 
Protestants, 25 Homan Catholic and others various. During 
1915 six girls at the Sydney Home became Christians, 7 at 
Montreal, eighty percent at Toronto, 5 girls at Winnipeg, 

40 at Calgary and 14 at the Vancouver Home. 

In 1916 another 210 girls were brought in. That same 
year 129 girls were sent out from the Homes to safe 
positions and to self-supporting and self-respecting lives. 
The Homes at Winnipeg and Montreal were put on an inter¬ 
denominational basis. The Methodist Board of Social 
Service shared on equal terms with the Presbyterian Board 
the expense and control.

The next year, 1917, an additional 121 girls received 
care while 131 went out into self-supporting positions. Of 
those cared for 72 were delinquents under 16 years of age, 

96 maternity cases of which 24 were cases where soldiers wen 
responsible, 28 prostitutes. By nationality 76 were 
Canadian-born, 13 Europeans and 6 Newfoundlanders. 

The number of girls admitted to these Homes in 1918 
totalled 149; in 1919, 214; in 1920, 138 and in 1924, 188 
received care. 

To aid in counteracting the white slave traffic and 
prostitution protection was given to unchaperoned girls 
entering Canadian ports. The Church recognized immoral 
literature, pictures and books, cheap places of amusement anc 
lower grades of theatres to be feeders to this traffic. 

Thus it sought to improve upon them, and where necessary, 
abolish them. In this connection, besides attempting to 
raise the moral standards by teaching and instructing, much 
pressure was brought to bear upon the federal government. 

In 1909 the Assembly urged upon the government, as an 
amendment to the criminal code, two enactments:- to make 
adequate the penalties for securing for immoral purposes; anc 
to make the having in possession of immoral or obscene 
literature, pictures/etc., a crime under heavy penalties. 
The government made this amendment.

Due in part to the influence of the Social Service 
Department of the Presbyterian Church, combined with similar 
departments of other denominations, the government in 1918 
made additional amendments to the criminal code which 
furthered the safety of girls and young women. 

1. Raising the age of consent for girls from fourteen 
to sixteen. 

2. Raising the age in case of sedition from sixteen to 
eighteen. 

3. Giving protection against sedition by employers to al] 
female employees of previous chaste character under 
twenty-one. 

4. Makihg it an offense for a man and woman to register 
falsely as husband and wife in a hotel or lodging 
hou se." 

The problems of ‘-'unday observance, temperance and 
gambling caused the Presbyterian Church as much concern as 
they did other denominations. By means of the Lord's Day 
Alliance, an undenominational organization, all Protestant 
denominations exerted a powerful influence both upon the 
citizens and government. By 1909 the Lord's Day Act was in 
force in every province in Canada, including the Yukon, with 
the exception of British Columbia. However, two years later 
British Columbia concented to its enforcement. With the 
outbreak of World War I there came a slackening in Sunday 
observance. In some areas moving picture shows were opened 

on Sundays. In 1915 there was the attfciapt to introduce

Sunday baseball into Winnipeg, but that v/as dealt with 
successfully with the assurance to the Lord*s Day Alliance 
that such an occurrence would not arise again. In many 
cities the mnaufacturing of war supplies did not cease on 
Sundays, although in some instances by means of combined 
efforts of Protestant Churches sufficient pressure was 
brought to hear upon the government to order the closing of 
factories on the Sabbath, in addition many newspapers were 
forced to cease Sunday publication. 

Fairly steady progress was made in temperance reform. 
The Church recognized the advantages of the Local Option 
method as a means of controlling the liquor traffic in that 
it made necessary almost a constant agigation and discussion 
of the retail sale of intoxicants for beverage purposes. 

The social service board unceasingly induced pastors and 
other leaders in Sunday schools and youhg peoples* societies 
to extend the use of the total abstinance pledge by its 
circulation. Organized campaigns of petitions and inter¬ 
views with members of parliament brough results. During the 
war years Sir Robert Borden was asked to give federal 
prohibition as a war measure'. By 1917 all the provinces 
with the exception of Quebec voted in favor of prohibition. 
Two years later Quebec followed the example of the other 
provinces. In this accomplishment the Protestant churches 
to a great extent were responsible. The Church at no time

re laxed its pressure but on some occasions it became too 
optimistic, for prohibition was not to last. 

Gambling, too, was looked upon as a great social evil. 
After the turn of the century the Board of Moral Reform 
steadily pressed for the enactment by Parliament of an 
amendment to the Criminal Code that would outlaw the business 
of gambling altogether. The government responded to this 
request slowly and only in part. Race track gambling 
especially caused the Qhurch concern. During the Great War 
years gambling was put under the ban. In this the Church 
rejoiced. This, though, was to return after the war. 

The Board of Social Service gave special attention to 
the study of industry in relation to social conditions among 
all classes in life. On several occasions representatives 
from the church addressed the Trades and Labor Congress in 
addition to many other gatherings of labor men. A number 
of questions were considered constantly and remedies sought: 

1. Has the pulpit sought to relate the Gospel message 
to the industrial problems of the day? 

2. In the relationof employer and employee is there 
that mutual regard for one another’s interests that 
the spirit of Christianity requires? 

3. Is wealth being made and used according to Jesus’ 
teaching? 

4. Are labor organizations controlled by Christian 
ideals?

5* Is anything special being done to meet local 
needs? If so, what and'with what results? 

The Board appointed a standing committee on labour, 
housing, health and relief which gave careful study to such 
practical and important questions. 

The Church joined in in the demand for a fair wage 
for employees in industry, reasonable working hours, the 
abolishment of exploitation of the necessities of life and 
suitable working conditions. The church was not lacking in 
courage in keeping this vision before the government and 
employers of industry, difficult as it was. It placed great 
significance upon the government personnel as being good, 
wise, honest and efficient. It urged upon those in authority 
their responsibilities- for the preservation of the rights 
and privileges, the health, safety, comfort and opportunity 
for wholesome living of those engaged in industry, of men, 
women and children. Stress, too, was laid upon wholesome 
recreation for every individual family and community. 

The needs of rural communities were great. To improve 
upon the religious, social and economic life of the rural 
community the church seized upon every opportunity to co¬ 
operate with organizations and groups which labored for the 
same end.

"One of the greatest needs of rural life is the 
spirit of mutual confidence and cooperation which 
alone can make possible cooperative production and 
marketing. The developing of this spirit is the 
work of the Church which can make no larger con¬ 
tribution to the solution of the problems of 
country life."(l) 

Through the faithful work of each local church the spirit of 
cooperation was fostered, rural slums improved upon, pure 
and healthy recreation promoted and advanced education 
encouraged. To this end, for example, the Department of 
Social Service at the General Assembly in 1922, stressed the 
importance of Christian ministers, public school teachers 
and members of public school boards exchanging views 
regarding the best methods of advancing the welfare of the 
community. The Assembly also urged upon the Theological 
Colleges of the Church, the need of giving special consid¬ 
eration to the training of men who would devote their lives 
to the work of the Church in the rural sections of Canada. 
Many organizations such as young people’s groups, Women’s 
Missionary Societies, men’s clubs and recreational groups 
made their contribution to the bettering of the rural 
community life. 

There were few rural districts, especially in western 

Canada, in which the population did not increase. This was

more notable after World War I. The foreign population in 
particular mounted. 

It was the policy of the Presbyterian Church to 
establish church hospitals if possible where need arose. 

This type of program along with its emphasis upon education 
was more extensive than that adopted by the Methodist Church, 
Most notable of these were St. Pauls Hospital, Hearst, 
northern untarion; nosedale War Memorial Hospital, Matheson, 
northern Ontario; Hunter Hospital, Teulon, uaanitoba; 
Ethelbert Hospital, Pine River Unit and oifton Dispensary, 
Anna Turnbull Hospital, Wakow, Saskatchewan; Hugh Waddell 
Memorial Hospital, Canora, Saskatchewan; Medical work at 
Bonnyville and Cold Lake, Alberta; Holland M. Boswell 
Hospital, Vegreville, A.lberta; Francis Lake Hospital, Britisl 
Columbia; Fort Vermilion Hospital Unit, Alberta; St. Andrews 
Hospital, Altin. At these and many others across Canada 
medical aid was administered by nurses and doctors, some 
professionally trained, others volunteer helpers. In this 
great undertaking much credit is due again to the Women*s 
Missionary Society for its assistance in providing workers 
and finances.

Chapter IV 


THE THIRD TRIBUTARY - THE CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH 

. 

The main principle of the Congregational Church made 

the local church supreme in matters of faith and practice. 

In Canada the Congregational Church was essentially a small 
a 

church. Its social undertakings were on a more limited seal* 
than those of the methodi stand Presbyterian Churches. 


The Congregational Church began work in Canada as 
early as 1750 with the establishment of a church in Halifax. 
It wasnot until 1690 that Congregationalism reached Quebec, 
and 1819 that the work flourished in Ontario. 


Actual Social service never functioned as an organized 
department• 

"Our Committee has been annually appointed and a 
chairman selected. The duties of said committee 
have consisted in preparing resolutions on all 
questions of social and moral reform, and in sub¬ 
mitting the same for the approval and confirmation 
of the Union in annual session; to cooperate with 
similar Boards of other denominations in urging 
and securing needed reforms; and to recommend to 
the Union such financial aid as might be within 
our power to grant where assistance has been 
requested."(1) 


Few of the individual churches, if any, had what might 
be called institutional work. The majority of the city

churches were too small to make any ambitious attempts along 
such lines. However, there were churches with socially- 
minded ministers who had social service clubs which provided 
study of social problems such as the effects of motion 
pictures, cheap reading, professional gambling, drinking and 
Sunday sport* 

The Broadview Congregational Church in Toronto had as 
one of its members Mr* C. J. Atkinson, whose work among boys 
carried on at first in the church and later throughout the 
city, really laid the foundation for much of boys’ work in 
the city of Toronto. He first organized a boys’ brigade in 
the Broadview Church. This grew to such an sxtent that it 
purchased some property across the street for a boys’ 
institute. This in turn eventually developed into the 
Broadview Branch of the Y.M.C.A. Desiring to devote all his 
time to work for underprivileged boys, he bought an old 
skating rink and turned it into what was called ’’The Boys’ 
Dominion”, where many boys were helped and set aright. 

The Missionary Society made itself responsible for the 
care of ’’The Evangelical Church of the Deaf” in Toronto. 

Among these unfortunates much appealing work was done. By 
the time of union it possessed a membership of one hundred of 
which there were two distinct groups, deaf mutes, and those

who were deaf, dumb and blind. 

In Montreal regular ministry was carried on amongst 
the colored folk in the "Union Colored Church". 

For the most part such work as was undertaken by the 
Congregational Churches in this field was done through the 
cooperative organizations of the churches, Social Service 
Council of Canada, Dominion Alliance (for temperance and 
prohibition) and the Lord’s Day Alliance. 

The Social Service Council of Canada, organized in 
1907, consisted of a federation of churches and other 
Dominion-wide organizations for the purpose of engaging in 
and bringing about reforms in Canada by means of concentratec 
and cooperative efforts. On this Council were representative 
from the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches 
as well as from other denominations. 

This Council set forth its program as follows: 

"For the application of Christian principles to 

the operations of industrial associations whether 

of labor or of capital. 

For a more equitable distribution of wealth. 

For the abolition of poverty. 

For the protection of childhood. 

For the safeguarding of the physical and moral health 

of women in industrial life.

For the adequate protection of working people in

disputes. 

For proper housing. 

For the adequate care of dependent and defective 
persons. 

For the reclamation of criminals. 

For wholesale recreation. 

For the protection of society against contagious 
diseases. 

For international peace. M (1) 


Through this Council the Congregational Church shared 
in exerting healthy moral ana social influence upon 
Canadian life.

Chapter V 


THE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA 










Chapter V 


THE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA 

The amalgamation of the Presbyterian, Methodist and 
Congregational Churches, 1925, resulted in the organized 
body of "The United Church of Canada." The consummation 
of union did not necessitate the forming of an entirely new 
social program to be undertaken by the United Church, but 
father a continuation and expansion of the policies and 
undertakings formerly set forth by the three separate bodies. 


The vast Dominion of Canada was still a young and 
pioneering country with a promising future in agriculture 
and industry. Her population which was still relatively 
small consisted of many nationalities. From the very out¬ 
set the United ^hurch realized that its task was to bring 
its influence to bear upon the national problems already 
prevalent and those yet to arise, in the words of the late 
Dr. Oliver, 

"The Church’s work is the work of the Master--not 
to be ministered unto but to minister. Service 
instead of selfishness. Purity instead of 
pollution. Friendship instead of feuds. Sympathy 
instead of suspicion. Peace instead of warfare. 

The high instead of the low. Enlightenment in¬ 
stead of ignorance. Health instead of disease. 
Christ instead of chaos."(1) 

In its annual report of 1921 the Board of iiome Missions

Church", The United Church of Canada, 1930, p. 183.

and Social Service of the Presbyterian Church of Canada 

expressed its aim as follows: 

"A genuine desire to protect human life; anxiety to 
care for and provide for the helpless and young; 
a determination to encourage the recognition of the 
spirit of justice among all classes; the need for 
severer punishment for the violation of virtue are 
emphasized in the legislation of last year.” 

The spirit expressed in that earlier report was to continue 

in the United Uhureh. 

The social program of the United Church is indicated 
in this section by reference to its interest in immigration, 
problems of the New Canadians and Indians, city missions, 
Marine Missions, hospitals, school homes, and boarding 
schools, redemptive homes and institutions, moral reform, 
industnaj. conditions, unemployment and relief, rural 
improvements and Christian service in time of war. To 
execute such a program it was necessary for the church to 
study conditions as they existed and thereby inaugurate 
methods of prevention rather than cure wherever possible 
and to have courage to speak and act in the name of 
justice, purity, truth and love. 

The social work promoted by the United Church of 
Canada was to come under the Board of Evangelism and 
Social Service. The Board took over and developed the 
work previously carried on by Boards of the uniting

churches, 

"Great interest attended the confluence of the 
three streams. But the meeting for the first 
time of diverse elements, and the approach to 
problems from widely different traditional view¬ 
points was a means of grace. The principles which 
would guide further policy had to be brought out, 
and the conversations attending this process were 
most illuminating. Supreme stress was laid 
throughout on the spiritual mission of the Church 
as the body of Christ coming to local visibility 
in the congregation."(1) 

The Board in one of its earliest reports to General Council 

defined its field of effort and purpose as follows: 

"Rapidly changing conditions and the trend of modern 
thinking regarding moral and social forces, reveal 
the truth that responsibilities confronting the 
church today bear very little resemblance to the 
same problems as they appeared twenty, or even 
fifteen years ago. J-his fact demands careful 
reflection in determining policies. It is more and 
more apparent that in this wide and varied branch 
of service, the church must give its strength to 
educational efforts rather than attempt to secure 
reforms by direct political action. Facts are 
God^ arguments, ^nce the Board regards its duty 
primarily to be the discovery of facts, the re¬ 
vealing of spiritual values, and the presentation 
of these to the church. By this means, there is 
reasonable hope to believe that an informed public 
opinion and a sustained political conscience may 
be created which will find expression through 
political channels and finally have its convictions, 
when necessary, enacted by lafc*. (2) 


After the Great War immigration to Canada increased 
yearly. In 1926 the newcomers totalled 135,984 while in

1927 the number increased to 158,884* The Church, through 
its immigration chaplains and strangers* secretaries at 
the ports of Halifax, Quebec, Montreal, Vancouver and 
Victoria, met these people and helped them reach their 
destination as easily and quickly as possible. The chap¬ 
lains forwarded to the Home Mission office the names of all 
who would be looking to the United Church to find a church 
home. Of the 166,782 immigrants in 1928, 39,832 were re¬ 
ported through the Home Mission office of the United 
Church. 15,098 were from the British Islea and 24,734 non- 
Anglo-Saxons which represented over twenty different 
nationalities. The names were sent on to the minister of 
the charge to which the new settlers were to go. The 
local minister and members of the congregation contacted 
them personally. J?or example, in Toronto a fully qual¬ 
ified minister worked among the Bulgarians. He held 
services for them in the Church of All Nations and also 
on King Street East. Once a month he met a group in 
Kitchener at which time they held a church service and 
learned the English language. In 1927 over 2,000 Ukrain¬ 
ians who came to Canada made the United Church their home 
church. In 1927 Rev. Dr. Manning organized an Immigration 
Committee of the Church under the Board of Home Missions 
the duties of which consisted in bringing boys and single

men from the British Isles for work on farms. The boys 
were carefully selected in the British Isles and had to 
be under nineteen years of age. When they arrived in 
Canada they were responsible to the Immigration Committee 
until they were nineteen. The first group arrived in the 
spring of 1928. By the end of the same year the Committee 
reported one hundred and ten bank accounts with an average 
of $20.00 each. Many of the boys were able to find work 
for their fathers who in England were unemployed. Several 
ministers organized clubs for the boys and gave them an 
interest in church life. By.the end of July 1928 four 
hundred and seventy had arrived in Canada. Most of them 
settled in Ontario. 

The majority of immigrants consisted of Belgiums, 
Dutch, Finlanders, Germans, Italians, Jews, Jugo-Slavians, 
Hungarians, Poles, Ukrainians, Czecho-Slovakians, Scand¬ 
inavians, Chinese, Japanese, Scotch, Irish and English. 

The Central Europeans settled in all parts of Canada, the 
majority of Orientals along the west coast and the Jews in 
the industrial and business centres. 

Dr. Osterhout, Superintendent of Oriental Work west 
of the Great Lakes, reported in 1928 that the Oriental work 
developed chiefly along educational, religious and medical

lines. However, some Chinese schools were forced to cease 

due to the stiffening of the immigration regulations which 

reduced the number of °hinese immigrants. The medical 

service at Vancouver and Victoria meant a great deal to 

these folk. 3,326 cases received treatment for over 100 

ailments. The type of work carried on has been well 

expressed in the words of one of the coast missionaries: 

"My work embraces the following: medical, to relieve 
suffering and to cure disease; spiritual, to bring 
spiritual comfort to the patients; educational, to 
preach scientific treatment and preventive medicine; 
social, social regeneration, showing better ways 
of life."(1) 

At the outset the work among the Chinese who numbered 
40,000, proved very difficult. Due to the struggle of the 
Chinese for democratic and stable government in the home 
land, the church has taken a secondary place in their lives. 
In addition to this many propagandists succeeded in 
stirring up among the Chinese hatred for Canada, Great 
Britain and Christianity by claiming falsely that such 
groups were guilty of discriminations against the Chinese. 
Under these obstacles the Church realized that Its task 
lay chiefly with the Chinese children w'hose minds must be 
kept free of such antagonism and prejudices. By means of 

medical missions in Vancouver and Victoria the Church did

succeed to some extent to persuade the Chinese that the real 
spirit of Christianity was to heal, uplift and encourage. 

Chinese missions in Western Canada were established in 
Victoria, Nanaimo, Vancouver, New Westminster, Kamloops, 
Calgary, Edmonton, Moose law and Winnipeg. In Victoria 
Mr. Lowe ministered to the Chinese and to those at outside 
points which included Sidney and Duncan. In 1950 he 
attempted to establish a church school in connection with 
the mission for instruction of the Canadian-born Chinese 
but financial assistance was not granted. H 0 wever, Mr. Lui 
Eung Yee instructed the children in reading and writing in 
the mission building, a new building was erected in 1929 
in Vancouver to promote mission work among the Chinese. 

Many young men occupied the dormitory rooms and were 
expected to attend the services of the mission, ihe Sunday 
school under the supervision of Dr. P. Y. Chu increased 
more than one hundred percent in membership and attendance 
in 1930. Dr. Chu carried on his medical practice in the new 
building which offered good office equipment. 

By 1932 twelve Chinese missionaries were actively 
engaged in Western Canada, i'heir work among the young and 
Canadian-born proved the most fruitful. Chinese kinder¬ 
gartens, Sunday schools, boys’ and girls' groups were

promo ted at every centre. 

The centres of Chinese mission work in eastern Canada 
v/ere situated at Montreal, Toronto, London, Ottawa, Halifax, 
Chatham, Cochrane, Brockville and Windsor. In Toronto 
services were conducted at the Chinese Christian Institute. 
Until 1932 no week day schools were undertaken but much 
visiting was done by the minister, Mr. Lun. That same year 
the church membership was thirty-two while the Sunday 
school enrolment totalled 45. In Montreal Rev. K. Y. Tang 
conducted a day school in which he taught the Chinese 
language to the children. On Sundays he preached at the 
Institute and church and taught a Bible class. The child¬ 
ren’s Sunday school had an average attendance of fifty. 

At the Chinese mission in Ottawa a teacher was employed, 
preaching services held and much visiting done. There 
were two Sunday schools and a Chinese men’s club in connec¬ 
tion with the missiont Wesley Church, Hamilton, offered 
its gymnasium facilities to a group of young Chinese men 
and made possible a service each Sunday evening. The girls 
were cared for by a number of Canadian women. I'orty-five 
young people were enrolled in five United Church Sunday 
schools during 1931. Halifax mission reported a class of 
ten Chinese in 1934. The church’s influence upon the 

Chinese can be illustrated by rererence to a Chinese

laundryman in Peterborough, Boge Chew, 

"who goes regularly to Church and tries to keep 
up his financial responsibility. He was asked 
recently to buy a ticket to a church bazaar of 
another denomination and was told that he might 
win a substantial prize. His reply was that since 
he had become a Christian he had given up gambling.*0-) 

By 1936 and 1937 the work among the Chinese in west¬ 
ern Canada still proved discouraging. The conditions in ' 
the Orient continued to influence the Chinese in Canada. 
Their homeland still defended itself against the aggressive 
Japanese. China held a distrust for Britain and even 
Christianity. The United Church in Canada found it 
difficult to influence the doubtful-minded Chinese. The 
children, though, who were Canadian-born and educated, did 
show a willingness to accept Christianity. The United 
Church reported more successful results among the Chinese 
in eastern Canada. The spirit of antagonism was not as 
evident. In 1941 in Toronto three Chinese were baptized 
and received into the Church, the two Sunday school 

departments reported seventy-seven pupils, eight teachers 

♦ 

and officers and an average attendance of fifty. Two 
women’s clubs totalled seventy-seven in membership. Thirty- 
five were enrolled in the Young Women’s Mission Circle, 
eleven in the girls’ club (C.G.I.T.), forty-three in the 
mission band, thirty-five in the young people’s group,

fifty in the children’s group and ten in the boys’ club 
(Trail Rangers), Much of the work was accomplished by 
volunteer helpers. The Chinese population in Toronto for 
1941 numbered 2,559. For the same year the membership in 
Bay Street Church, the only Chinese United Church in 
Toronto, totalled fifty-two, and its Sunday school ninety- 
nine. The three mid-week organizations had a total member¬ 
ship of 70. 

Edmonton’s Chinese population for 19.41 totalled 384. 
The Chinese United Church in the same city had fifteen 
members on the roll, twenty-three in Sunday school, and 
twenty-two in the one mid-week group. 

The 1941 census recorded 7,880 Chinese in the city of 
Vancouver. The one Chinese United Church in that city 
reported seventy church members, ninety children in the 
four mid-week groups. 

Since the outbreak of war with Japan, a closer bond 
has been growing between the Canadian and Chinese people 
because of a better understanding. A Chinese legation has 
been set up in Ottawa. 

n A better understanding of China and her people is 
growing in Canada. At a recent dinner of a 
Business Club, your representative was given a 
good hearing as to Chinese at home and abroad.

outstanding Chinese soloist, and the General¬ 
issimo was toasted* 

A communion service in Ottawa, ten monthly- 
services in Hamilton at Wesley Church, and in 
London at First St. Andrew’s Church were held. 
Calls were made on members of these groups at 
their houses and places of business. Cities in 
which Chinese have community groups have been 
visited as time would permit, from Windsor to 
Niagara Falls, from Fort William to Ottawa, in 
Ontario. 

The young people in large cities live under 
pressure, whether in school or at work. °ome 
feel they are discriminated against, when they 
seek employment. This causes some resentment. 
Some of them do not see why, being more Canadian 
than Chinese, they should hot be on the same 
footing as other Canadian-born citizens. 

A large number of young, who are connected with 
our various churches and missions across the 
Dominion, are in the institutions for higher 
learning. A number of recent graduates are doing 
splendid work. Some have entered, or afre about 
to enter, the armed forces of Canada.

The Japanese population in British Columbia for 1941 
was 22,096. That same year the United Church was resp¬

members totalled 1,096 which represented 1,151 families 
while 5,702 were under pastoral oversight which signifies

approximately one-quarter of the total Japanese population 
for the province. Seven ordained Japanese ministers, one 
student minister and one Canadian missionary who served 
for twenty-three years in Japan gave leadership. 


Mission work among the Japanese was undertaken chiefly 

in Alberta and British Columbia, as most of them settled 

in the two western provinces. The chief hinderance to 

missionary endeavours among the Japanese has been the 

attitude of the Canadian people toward the new-comers. 

"Our boasted British-fair-play spirit is too little 
in evidence. Take a concrete case. The Steveston 
people are fisher folk. They were admitted as 
fishermen, but now after investing their all in 
the fishing industry of the coast, they are informed 
owing to the avowed policy of the government 
resulting from political pressure, that in eight 
years time all licenses issued to Japanese are to 
be cancelled so far as the salmon industry is 
concerned. The ten percent reduction began two 
years ago, with the result that one of our most 
capable and best-loved missionaries has not had 
a single convert since."(l) 

A Japanese exposed to such trying circumstances placed 
little confidence in the Christianity which a Canadian 
tried to teach him. This antagonism for and lack of under¬ 
standing of the Japanese people on the part of the Canad¬ 
ians definitely has hindered the missionary enterprise. 
Missions were established in the Okanagan Valley, New West-

minster, Victoria, Vancouver, Ocean Falls, Steveston in 
British Columbia, and at Raymond in Alberta. 

However, encouraging results were achieved. The 
largest kindergarten in western Canada was found among the 
Japanese two years after union. The attendance continued 
to increase at all the centres. More children were touched 
through the Sunday schools, ^ight schools enabled many 
working Japanese to receive an education. At the first 
communion service held at Pleasant-Fairview area, Vancouver, 
seventy-five Japanese members took part. Rev. K. Shimizu 
supplied that point along with the Powell Street Mission, 

The New Westminster mission, one of the most success¬ 
ful in Canada, in 1932 reported an addition of thirty- 
nine Japanese to its former membership of 138. Similar 
success was realized that same year at other British 
Columbia Missions, notably, Vancouver, Kelowna and Steves¬ 
ton. At all centres the Sunday schools, kindergartens and 
clubs for boys and girls were emphasized in cooperation 
with the Women’s Missionary Society. 

By 1936 further successes were reported. The 
Okanagan Valley Mission which, eight years before, had but 
one member, that year reported one hundred. The Japanese 
congregation at Powell Street, Vancouver, attained self-

support and a junior congregation of the Canadian-born 
was organized. 

Two years later the ‘'omen’s Missionary Society made 
it possible for a group of Japanese Girls in Training to 
meet in the Japanese Hall and carry out candle lighting 
ceremonies and mother and daughter banquets in the isolated 
area of Mission City, British Columbia. Again, in 
Clayburn where there were thirteen Japanese homes little 
groups gathered with their children who were instructed 
in religion and morals and given old copies of "Jewels". 

By the end of 1941 Canada was at war with Japan. 
Innediately the government evacuated the Japanese popul¬ 
ation of British Columbia from the protected area along the 
coast which extends inland for a distance of about one 
hundred miles. This meant a disturbance to the missionary 
enterprise among the Japanese. In the interest of the 
Canadian Japanese the i^oard or Home Missions passed a 
memorandum in 1942 to be presented to federal authorities 
part of which is as follows: 

"The United Church (and the Methodist Church before 
1925) has carried on missionary work among the 
Japanese people in British Columbia since 1892 
and has achieved a gratifying measure of success, 
not only in interesting the Japanese in the 
Christian religion but in building up those 
Christian institutions which are found among our 
Canadian people*

The United Church, with wide contacts in all parts 
of the Dominion, requests that the authorities will 
permit it, through the Women’s Missionary Society, 
to facilitate the placing of young Canadian 
Japanese women in such individual employment as may 
be found outside the protected areas, the Women’s 
Missionary Society assuming any responsibility 
that may be involved.”(1) 

23,000 Japanese were moved, 11,000 of whom were sent 
to seven centres in the interior of British Columbia and 
the remainder placed in the sugar-beet industry in Alberta, 
Manitoba, Ontario, or in lumber camps in Alberta and 
Ontario. Some of the Japanese women were sent east with 
some of the men to do domestic work. There remained still 
the same group of self-supporting Japanese who took up 
residence where they wished. The Japanese ministers and 
workers have been distributed among these people as well 
as possible. 

Characteristic of the work which is promoted among the 
Japanese in their new locations is that in Edmonton, 

Alberta. Although no Japanese minister is located in this 
area, Rev. J. T. Stephens of All People’s Mission holds 
services with them twice a month. In addition, several 
Japanese are regular attenders at the English services. The 
women are encouraged to attend the ladies meetings. Girls

and boys attend the clubs and Sunday school and three 
Japanese boys are leading boys 1 groups at Bissell, a 
Japanese girl playing the organ for the regular Sunday 
evening service and another Japanese girl sings in the 
junior choir. Each Christmas and Easter season a large 
supper is held in Bissell Memorial Church for all the 
Japanese of Edmonton. For this and other personal kind¬ 
nesses they are sincerely grateful. 

One of the present tasks of the United Church is to 
create among the Canadian people the spirit of tolerance 
toward and understanding of the Japanese. Many church 
members resent them moving into their areas and sharing 
in their worship services and other church activities. 
During the past year three Canadian families have left 
Bissell Memorial Church because of the interest shown in 
the Japanese. The Superintendent, regardless of such 
opposition, has continued to serve the Japanese and has 
determined never to exclude them. The church can adopt 
no other attitude if it is to be consistent with the 
teachings of Jesus. 

The work among the East Indians, most of whom lived 
in British Columbia, has not been very extensive. Only 
1,100 resided in Canada during the early years of church 
union, but since then their numbers have been decreasing.

Rev. w . L. Macrea and a native lay worker, Peter Kanshi 
Ram met with bitter opposition caused by a strong prejudice 
against British rule and Christianity. However, this was 
broken down slowly. Missions were established at Victoria 
and Vancouver. Regular classes for the young were organ¬ 
ized, and many young men received educational instruction 
six days a week. 

In 1933 Rev. Osterhaut reported a changed attitude 
to the Christian faith and a growing willingness to give 
religious training to the young among the East Indians. 

Rev. Macrea in the vicinity of Kamloops and Kelowna and 
Dr. Simon Fraser on Vancouver Island met with increased 
friendliness. The East Indians attended regularly the 
church services. The night school, built in Vancouver, 
reported sixteen pupils and eight volunteer but experienced 
teachers. Mr.- Kanshi Ram gave much time to boys’ and 
girls 1 and young men’s clubs. Dr. and Mrs. J. S. McKay, 
experienced missionaries from India, succeeded Rev. Macrae 
in 1935. Since then the work has undergone little change. 

On the whole, the Oriental work has progressed steadily 
with an increase in the number of centres, workers, 
activities and persons served. For example, the Women’s 
Missionary Society in 1927 had eight workers active in 
four centres; 1936 seventeen missionaries in five centres;

has met with a greater response from among the Japanese 
as is evident by the fact that in 1941 one-quarter of the 
Japanese in British Columbia were under pastoral oversight 
while the percentage for the Chinese was much lower. The 
lack of response from the Chinese can be attributed 
chiefly to the hatred they held for the Canadians, Great 
Britain and Christianity. However, this was gradually 
broken down by the work of the missionaries to the Chinese 
in Canada. The same problem faced those who attempted to 
meet the needs of the East Indians, although it, too, was 
overcome gradually. The chief difficulty met with in the 
Japanese work has been the intolerance and lack of under¬ 
standing on the part of the Canadians. This, naturally, 
would create resentment in the hearts of the Japanese. 
Regardless of this the Church has done much for the 
Japanese. 

The work undertaken by the United Church among the 
non-Anglo-Saxons was carried on chiefly by means of the 
Department of the Stranger (which has already been 
mentioned), community missions, medical missions, school 
homes and boarding schools. Much work such as that for 
little children, clubs, kindergartens, mothers * meetings, 
Christmas concerts, social gatherings, daily vacation

Bible schools, fresh air camps, Sunday schools, Sunday 
services, goodwill and the home and hospital visitation is 
common to all departments. 

The community or neighborhood missions have served the 
New Canadians regardless of race, creed and color. As 
early as 1927 the United Church had 34 organized mission 
centres. For example, a few Hungarians in Toronto asked 
one of the missions for assistance to learn the English 
language. This was granted and the group grew. Finally 
they organized themselves into the "Hungarian Society of 
Toronto". Out of this there developed a regular Sunday 
church service. In 1927 there were in All People’s Mission 
in Hamilton people who represented eighteen nationalities. 

First United Church and Turner ‘institute, Vancouver, 
took a leading part in city mission work. In 1928 First 
Church reported fifty-five children as representing twenty- 
one nationalities in the kindergarten, 1,000 families 
touched and an average attendance of 2,022 per month at 
its various activities. 

At All People(s Mission in Edmonton the diverse nature 
of the work was revealed by its mission to the Chinese, 
a school home for French girls and boys and one for 

Ukrainian girls. Rev. W. H. Pike 1 superintendent of the

Mission, reported, work at three centres, 513 children 
enrolled in Sunday school, an average attendance of 500 per 
month at preaching services and 284 families served which 
represented fourteen nationalities. 


Similar activities were reported throughout Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan. All People's Mission, Winnipeg, kept 
expanding its departments which touched over 1,600 people 
each year, the majority of whom were non-Anglo-Saxons. 
Likewise Robertson House and Church with its staff of two 
ordained ministers and ten paid workers, reported 1,322 
members, 550 in Sunday School, 57 clubs and cooperative 
work with the Juvenile Court at Winnipeg. Particular 
reference to Robertson Memorial Church and Institute will 
serve as an illustration of the undertakings of the city 
missions: 

1. Growing confidence in the community regarding the 
whole work. The buildings are used regularly by: 

(a) a Memonite congregation. 

(b) a nationalist Ukrainian club, meeting weekly. 

(c) occasionally by three different Lutheran 
congregations. 

(d) the children of a Lutheran pastor are in Sunday 
school. 

(e) the children of the editor of the "Ukrainian 
Labor News" are in clubs. 

(f) cordial relations with all classes and 
nationalitie s. 

2. (a) Young people's work never so prosperous, 120 girls 

in C.G.I.T. groups, meeting twice a week, one of 
the largest in the city.

(b) Over eighty older boys meeting each Sunday and 
on week nights. As many more coming on week 
nights, but not on Sunday. 

3. Athletic Record: 

(a) Juvenile Sunday School Basketball Trophy. 

(b) Senior Division C, City League Basketball Shield. 

(c) ’Charity* cup. Senion Church League Football. 

During the monththere is an aggregate attend¬ 
ance of 9,912. In the day department during 
the month there are 110 session, in the evening 
department there are 78 sessions during the 
month. In all, 1,229 individuals are in weekly 
attendance. In Sunday school, 550; church 
membership, 234; girls’ clubs, 443; boys’ clubs, 
224. (1) 


In Ontario and Quebec the increase in number of New 
Canadians was more numerous than in any other province. 

The majority settled in and around the industrial centres 
while others went to the lumbering camps and mining towns 
of the northern frontiers. In the cities the institutions 
and missions expanded their activities to meet the needs 
of these people. x he Church of All Nations in Toronto, 
opened in 1928, serves as a good example. At the outset 
services in six languages, conducted on Sundays, increased 
steadily in attendance. It soon came to be regarded by 
many non-Anglo-Saxons as their church home. 1 he church 
remained open every day of the week for girls and boys 
clubs, kindergarten, young people’s groups and women’s 
groups wnich represented many nationalities.

In the Maritime provinces the non-Anglo-Saxons were 
not as numerous. The community houses at Sydney and New 
Aberdeen and the United Mission served a large number of 
urban people which included many New Canadians whose lot 
was poverty and misfortune* 

Another important feature in the program of the city 
missions was the operation of fresh air camps in the 
summer time at near-by resorts for mothers, children, boys 
and girls* To these went the underprivileged of many 
nationalities, denominations and colors. The lake program 
consisted of swimming, hiking, games, hanaicrait, Bible 
study and camp-fires. Substantial meals were provided. 

The first of these camps were conducted by the Missions at 
Sydney, Montreal, Hamilton, Toronto, Sault Ste. Marie, Fort 
William, Winnipeg, Edmonton and Vancouver. Soon United 
Church Missions of other cities did likewise. 

The depression which began about 1930 presented a 
further problem to the missions. 1 hrough it the whole of 
Canada was forced to pass which added the vexatious 
problems of unemployment and relief. x he Church, too, 
suffered severely. The curtailment of Home Mission 
expenditures increased the hardship of the workers and 
restricted the work. * large proportion of the non-Anglo 
Saxons joined the ranks of the unemployed and in turn

flocked to the church institutions in ever-increasing 
numbers. To them they went in dire need for food, clothing 
and in hopes of seeking employment through their employ¬ 
ment bureau. In many cases the institutions became over¬ 
crowded. For example, the Church of #>11 Nations in Montreal 
a comparatively new institution at the beginning of the 
depression, was supposed to have offered adequate 
accommodation for twenty-five years, but it had become 
seriously overcrowded. The social workers and missionaries 
of the urban institutions, with reduced budgets and smaller 
staffs, continued to carry on a full-time program. 

Illustrative of the cosmopolitan nature of the work 
undertaken by the city missions during the years of 
depression is First United °hurch, Vancouver, which is 
situated in the downtown area. In that district lived 
people who represent at least thirty-one nationalities. 
Curing the depression years (1930-1940) the mission 
assisted 95,465 persons, many of whom were single, homeless 
unemployed men who received food, shelter and clothing. 

The Welfare Industry reported 31,051 families which 
received help in the form of clothing, shelter, medicine, 
stoves and heaters, -altogether 216,603 persons received 
aid from this department. Clothing of all kinds was 
passed out to 90,880 men, women and children of all classes

and conditions, ihe clothing consisted of such articles 
as coats, soaks, hoots, hats, trowsers, dressed, ties, 
overcoats, sweaters and underclothing. 

The records indicate that 13,763 needy and urgent calls 
were made during the ten years. It meant "climbing dark 
insecure stairs, groping along evil-smelling corridors 
in cheap rooming houses and often stumbling over trunks 
and broken furniture" and visiting jails and penitentiaries. 

For that same length of time 164,626 letters were 
written, 1,059 funeral services conducted (many of these 
being for unemployed men), 2,077 marraiges many of which 
were on relief and police records, 387 children baptised 
and a communion roll of 518. Six thousand Christmas 
hampers of food were distributed to the poor, The homeless 
and old age pensioners were remembered with food and 
clothing. Every day for a month at a time the unemployed 
stood in line for a meal at First Church. As many as one 
thousand men a day received care of this kind. Rev. 

Andrew Roddan, minister of First United Church, quoted a 
city official as saying: 

"If it had not been for the work of First Church 
there would have been much blood shed in the 
streets of Vancouver."(1) 

Fresh air camps each summer meant much to 5,529 mothers

babies, boys and girls during the ten years. In this 
again all nationalities shared, persons who otherwise 
would not have received holidays. 


Contributions were received by the Church. These in 
turn were passed on to the needy in both money and kind. 

Many of the contributions were sent in as a result of 
radio appeals. car for a missionary was needed; the 
appeal was made; the car was provided, likewise such things 
as a piano, organ, glasses, communion set, wheel chair, 
wooden leg, baby buggy, fuel, food and clothing helped 
enormously to relieve trying conditions. 


First Church has been known, in particular, for its 
International Communion Service at the beginning of each 
year. 

"Taking part in the service we have Chinese and 
Japanese, the East Indians and the native Indians 
of British Columbia, the representative of the 
Negro church, the Scandinavian, Finnish and 
Russian Christian Churches. The minister presides 
assisted by the Superintendent of Home Missions. 

The scripture is read by each minister present in 
his own tongue, a Japanese girl, sometimes a 
Chinese, sings f The Stranger of Galilee 1 ."(1) 

This in itself is an indication of the attempt to create 

the spirit of cooperation and brotherhood among the many 

nationalities within the Nominion.

Similar work was carried on by the United Church of 
Canada in many cities in the dominion* 

Another important aspect of service which the United 
Church rendered to the New Canadians was through its 
hospitals. The hospital work consisted of three types: 
first, hospitals managed and administered by the Home 
Mission Board and aided by the women's Missionary -Society; 
second, hospitals established and controlled entirely by 
the women 1 s Missionary Society; and third, ho spit alt-unit 
work which consisted of a small building or cottage but 
the method of help being home visitation and service to 
the surrounding district. The Home Mission Board undertook 
to maintain three hospitals. One was located at Lamont, 
Alberta, which had accommodation at that time for 70 beds; 
one at Hafford, Saskatchewan, and another at Vita, Manitoba, 
The medical work expanded each year, with the assistance 
of the Women’s Missionary Society. 

The church hospitals served those areas in communities 
where need appeared greatest and where there was no other 
medical service. They were established on the Ofcristian 
ideal of service to the community with an interest in 
everyone as an individual. The church intended these 
hospitals to assist the community spiritually and socially

as well as medically* 

By 1936 the Board of Home Missions maintained seven 
hospitals while the Women 1 s Missionary Society undertook 
the responsibility for eleven. Dr. H. V. Yfaldon, Super¬ 
intendent of the Vita Hospital, Manitoba, reported 511 
patients admitted, 2,183 out-patients, 126 operations, 

22,539 prescriptions, 144 X-rays, 11 deaths. At Hofford 
Hospital, Saskatchewan, Dr. A. 0. Rose, Superintendent, and 
his staff of six nurses cared for 673 in-patients of which 
261 were surgical cases, 3,850 out-patients, ^amont 
Hospital, Alberta, with Dr. A. E. Archer, Superintendent, 
three assistant doctors, one dentist, three graduate nurses 
and thirty nurses in training, possessed 12 private wards, 

36 semi-private, 22 public wards. There were treated 1,705 
in-patients and 2,364 out-patients. Dr. Soy Anderson, 
Superintendent of the George McDougall Hospital, Smoky -oake, 
tALberta, reported 428 in-patients and 1,500 out-patients. 

The Bella Coola Hospital, British Golumbia, was situated 
in an area in which lived chiefly Indians. The Hazelton 
Hospital staff consisted of the Superintendent, Dr. Horace 
2. Wrinch, an assistant, Dr. L. Wrinch, three graduate nurses 
md seven nurses in training. The number of in-patients 
totalled 370 of which 120 were Indians and the remainder

from fifteen different nationalities besides Canadian. The 
Port Simpson Hospital, British Columbia, with Dr. R. Geddes 
Large, superintendent, three registered nurses and four 
nurses in training, admitted 403 patients, of whom 295 were 
Indians, 75 white and 33 orientals. The Bella Bella 
Hospital, British Columbia, with its staff of Rev. George 
E. Darby, superintendent, two doctors, five registered 
nurses and six nurses in training, reported 268 patients 
treated of whom 160 were Indians and 99 patients of whom 
60 were Indians at the summer Hospital at Rivers Inlet. 
1,926 our-patients also received treatment. These British 
Columbia hospitals constituted part of the marine missions 
work along the Pacific Coast in addition to the religious 
and educational work. 

That same year the Women's Missionary Society 
hospitals gave medical aid to 3,900 patients while its two 
hospital units cared for 1,328 patients. The hospitals 
were located at Hearts and Matheson, Ontario; Ethelbert, 
Eriksdale, Pine River, Gypsumville and Teulon, Manitoba; 
Wakaw, Saskatchewan; Bonnyville, Grimshaw and Cold Lake, 
Alberta. In 1933 a hospited at Smeaton, Saskatchewan was 
opened and the following year one at Burns Lake, British 
Columbia.

and two hospital units during 1934 cared for 3,340 in-patient 

and gave treatment to 9,000 out-patients. A number of 

/ 

home calls took the doctors and nurses many miles from 
their headquarters. On several occasions they travelled by 
boat, horseback, team and on foot. In addition to their 
medical duties the nurses often assisted in the church and 
community. They lead Sunday school classes, mission bands, 
C.G.I.T. groups and young people’s groups. Many of these 
groups were promoted on a community basis which created 
among the citizens the Christian spirit of helpfulness and 
cooperation. The nedical missionaries discovered much 
lonliness in the pioneering districts, which caused the 
settlers to become mentally unbalanced. Hospital care, good 
iood and someone to whom to talk helped to overcome such 
nental disorders. 

This aspect of the work also was affected by the 
depression. All hospitals kept reporting an increase in 
the number of patients and found it increasingly difficult 
to balance budgets. Nevertheless, the doors of the 
hospitals remained open. Partly responsible for the 
continuance of the work was the Women’s Missionary Society 
which, besides financing their own centres, aided the Home 
Mission Board to supply funds and charitable goods.

of the Supply Department more evident than in 
medical work, and through all the records we hear 
the 1 thank you’ of nurses and doctors for linen, 
clothing, books, toys, without which they could 
not carry on their splendid service. 

The people of the community are usually warmly 
interested in the hospital. Hospital Guilds, which 
include many people from the towns and districts 
round about are of inestimable value. 

In this spirit of cooperation and helpfulness 
is expressed the gratitude of entire communities 
for the mission hospitals in their midst. 

This, our nurse writes, is a country of contrasts. 
The early settlers have done well during the past 
two years, but off the highway there are many 
poverty-stricken homes; poor land, small log 
shacks, with very few comforts. I had a case in 
one home where there was a large family, only 
one bed and no window-panes, just flour sacks 
nailed over the windows, and the only light a 
small, smoky lantern."(1) 


During 1937 at St. Paul 1 s Hospital, Hearst, Ontario, 
990 patients received treatment of which only one-third 
were Protestants. Those whom it served included lumbermen, 
fire-rangers, men in air service and road gangs. 

This work still continues and each hospital adds to 
its equipment bit by bit. Tor example, Cold Lake Hospital 
purchased a portable X-ray in 1939 and Battle River 
Hospital did likewise in 1941. Many others have secured 
an "iron lung" which is made available to them by Lord 
Nuffield of England.

At the present time Lamont United Church Hospital, 
Lamont, Alberta is one of the most successful of its kind. 
It is situated in the centre of a Ukrainian settlement. 

The policy of the hospital has been always to serve 
those New Canadians medically, spiritually and socially. 

In particular it has enabled them to accept the English 
tradition of health. So well has it fulfilled its purpose 
that it has been the centre of much experimental work. 

This hospital was the first in Canada to train Orientals 
for nursing and has continued this policy throughout the 
war years. This policy has promoted tolerance and 
destroyed much race prejudice. At present its staff 
includes Japanese nurses and interns. 

The schools maintained by the United Church of Canada 
have been of two types: first, the School Homes. These 
make available to the children of the surrounding districts 
a Christian home in which they are well cared for and give 
to them the opportunity to attend educational institutions 
established by the state. Second, the boarding schools 
offer the children their education as well as lodging. 

The Home Mission Board maintained four school homes --at 
Edmonton, Alberta; Yorkton and Prince Albert, Saskatchewan; 
St. John’s Hall, Quebec. The Women’s Missionary Society 
was responsible for schools which included both types.

In these school homes and hoarding schools were 
registered hoys and girls of Syrian, English, French, 
Hungarian, Dutch, Serbian, Russian, Italian, German, 
Scandinavian, Urkainian and Czecho-Slovakian nationalities. 
Many of the children came from crude homes while some were 
in poor health and others orphans. The schools aimed to 
send out students equipped for Christian leadership in the 
church and community. Boys and girls groups were formed. 

Dr. A. J. Hunter, principal of the School Home, Teulon, 
Manitoba, told the story of driving one winters night over 
a frozen lake to a lonely cabin in the woods. A few years 
later two children, a boy and a girl, came from this house 
to Dr. Hunter’s School Home. Both graduated. J-'he boy 
became a teacher in Pine River, Manitoba, while his sister 
continued her studies at the University of Winnipeg. She 
graduated from there and obtained an important position with 
the Child Labor Division of Manitoba. 

A pastor reported that he received into full member¬ 
ship of the church 28 students, of whom several were non- 
Anglo-Saxon, from one of the school homes. He said: 

"It would be difficult to estimate how far- 
reaching an influence these former students are 
now exercising on the educational and religious 
life of our province . Tt (1)

**A college graduate who had lived in one of the 
homes in Quebec wrote: 1 2 Father and mother want 
to send my brother and sister. They so often say 
how thankful they are for your guardianship of 
me during the four years I was with you. They 
are agreed, as I am, myself, that they were the 
most profitable and beneficial years of my life."(l) 

"’I am supposed to be doctor, nurse, priest, 
judge, lawyer, teacher and friend! 1 The home in 
which this missionary exercises all these pre¬ 
rogatives is still called the Syrian Home, 
although when the school opened in September, 
children of fourteen different nations tried to 
speak all at once! But music and patience help, 
and some necessary discipline."(2) 


During the first five years of the thirties this work 
reached its peak after which time it began to recede. The 
number of school homes is now on the decrease as many of 
them have outgrown the need. The areas where they were 
built have become organized, school houses built, in 
which the higher grades are taught. In 1935 the school¬ 
room at the Radway School Home was closed, 1936 the 
Boarding School at Tourville, Quebec, 1937 the Ruthenian 
School Home at Edmonton, 1938 the School Home at Wahstoo, 
Alberta and 1939 the Girls Home at Sifton, Manitoba. By 
1943 the Women*s Missionary Society had in operation ten 
of its original seventeen school homes and boarding schools.

evangel i Stic work the United Church had its Marine Missions 
on both the east and west coasts* A little steamer, 

"The Glad Tidings", built in 1884 carried the missionary 
along the Labrador Coast until 1932 when it was replaced 
by a large boat which was better equipped to bring medical 
aid, spiritual and educational instruction to the fishing 
folk in that area* 

Five boats have carried missionaries who have visited 
constantly little groups and lonely families along the 
6,OOu miles of coast line in British Columbia. Those to 
whom they went included hunters, trappers, miners, loggers, 
lumbemen, fishermen and a few settlers. The wcrk was so 
organized by 1934 that the two boats, "Thomas Crosby" and 
"Sky Pilot" carried the missionaries to approximateUy 
1,000 families plus hundreds of single persons. By means 
of these calls not only were the people kept from loneliness 
but medical aid was administered, services conducted, 

Sabbath schools held, week-day schools operated wherever 
possible, magazines, books, Sunday school papers distrib¬ 
uted, and needy families remembered with clothing, food 
and pictures at Christmas time. 

The Church, by means of its community or neighborhood 
missions which operate a full time program in the cities,

its hospitals and hospital units, school homes and board¬ 
ing schools and marine missions, serves a large percentage 
of the New Canadians. Through these various types of 
service it has enabled thousands of non-ioiglo Saxons to 
adjust themselves to the Canadian ways of health, education, 
moral and spiritual living and social customs and has 
assisted materially those in need. 

At the time of union the United Church assumed the 
responsibility of looking after approximately 16,000 of the 
104,894 Indians in Canada. For this purpose it established 
sixty evangelistic missions between kontreal and the 
Pacific, none of which were served in conjunction with 
missions to the white people. 

The task which faced the church was two-fold: first, 
to bring the Indians into a Christian way of life, and 
second, to make them self-supporting. In this the Church 
received the support of the Dominion Government. 

To meet these tasks the church required a good 
personnel of doctors, nurses and teachers, and a definitely 
outlined program which the Church and government would 
carry out in cooperation. This program would consist of 
evangelism, health and teaching all of which must be of a 
practical nature.

The United Church assumed the responsibility of 
directing forty-five day schools and thirteen residential 
schools with an enrollment of 2,500. 

The residential schools were of two types. The 
smaller consisted of a boarding school located on or near 
a reserve. It was built originally by the churcji and later 
aided financially by the government to the extent of 
$60•00 per pupil per year, it received from the government 
after union a grant of $140 to $170 per pupil, ^ight of 
these residential schools were in operation, ■‘■he second 
type consisted of a large residential school built by the 
government, whose direction and management was handed over 
to various denominations. The grant amounted to $170 per 
pupil per year. The five schools of this type were erected 
at Mount Elgin, Ontario; Portage la Prairie and Brandon, 
Manitoba; Edmonton, Alberta, _.nd Coqualeetza, British 
Columbia, with a total enrollment of 700 immediately after 
union. At all these schools the Indian girls received 
training in home cooking, housekeeping, sewing, gardening, 
reading and writing. The boys received instruction in new 
methods of farming, stock raising, reading and writing. 

All pupils were instructed in morals and religion. 


nospitals which served the Indians were located at 









- 119 “ 


Hazelton, Port Simpson and Bella Bella, British Columbia, 

In addition, hospitals were opened during the fishing season 
at Rivers Inlet and Port Essington, British Columbia, and 
at Norway House, Manitoba, 

The Women’s Missionary Society participated in the 
missionary work among the Indians. The Society cared for 
Indian children in nine institutions which included five 
residential schools, two school homes and one improved day 
school, a short time later two dispensaries were operated 
by means of which the field nurses gave assistance to an 
average of 5,000 Indians a year. 

Some illustrative results are as follows: the 
Indian school near Brandon, Manitoba, in 1933 reported that 
its thirty students secured the required standing with 
only seven supplemental examinations having to be written 
out of three hundred subjects. The technical boys obtained 
an average of from 72 to 75 percent. An Indian girl, 

Annie Lee, remained as a pupil in the Indian Residential 
School, Edmonton, Alberta, until she passed her Grade XII 
examinations. She then trained for a nurse in the Royal 
Alexandra Hospital. After graduating from there she 
turned to private nursing in that city. The children at 
the Round Lake School, Saskatchewan, received training for

and entered the provincial musical festival. They received 
high praise from the adjudicator. At Ahausalt, British 
Columbia, under the leadership of the principal, the boys 
drew the plans for and built a forty-foot launch which was 
to be used for Indian mission work in that area. Each year 
at the Regina Fair the Indian children from the Portage la 
Prairie School carried off prizes. For example, in 1933 
they won forty-one prizes of which eleven were firsts, in 
exhibits of handicraft, sewing, grain and class work. 

Another great contribution to Indian life in northern 
Canada was the publication of a Cree paper entitled 
"Spiritual Light" which was distributed on all the Cree 
missions. In addition much helpful Cree literature was 
prepared and distributed among the Crees by Rev. F. H. 
Stevens and Rev. T. R. Chapin. 

A missionary along the west coast reported that a 

wayward boy came to her and wanted to make a new beginning. 

As a proof of his sincerity he offered his home for a 

church meeting and would let the other village folk know 

about it if the missionary would come whenever possible. 

In cold, stormy weather they would carry on by themselves. 

In the same report she said, 

"Instead of afternoon teas this year, we began 
the year with a series of parties, held them in

the church, and they took the form of a social 
evening to which all were invited. We held 
little impromptu concerts and some of those 
taking part surprised even themselves, had games, 
contests, music, then a prayer-meeting, ending 
always with a lunch. 

The missionary from the Crosby Girls’ Home, on 
the west coast, told us she had visitors from 
Alaska; in the course of the conversation the 
woman told her that her mother had been in the 
Home years before, had come from a heathen village, 
and after leaving the school she married a native 
minister. This woman and her daughter taught 
school for ten years, and now the third, generation 
daughter was ready to enter the mission school."(1) 


The life of a nurse or medical missionary among the 
Indians is a very busy one and a difficult one. x he old 
customs and superstitions cannot be uprooted readily. 
Tubercolosis takes many Indian lives. Poor housing 
conditions promote sickness and disease. Diseased mouth 
and gums, decayed teeth and trachoma, an eye disease, afflict 
many of them. The Rev. D. J. 3. Scoates, who has served 
among the Indians in northern Manitoba during the last 
decade told, in "The Robertson Lectures” of 1945, how 
Indians would come to him to have teeth pulled, broken 
arms set and wounds healed. Although he was not a doctor 
he found it essential to have a practical medical knowledge. 


The chief enterprises of the United Church, then, 
among the Indians have been evangelical, educational,

social and medical by which the Church has helped the 
Indians through their transition period by enabling them to 
adjust themselves to the more settled type of life. The 
government has shared in this project, especially to 
promote education and social readjustment. 

In the field of moral reform the United Church took 
over the following redemptive homes: Bethany House, 
Montreal, four workers; Mountain View Home, Calgary, four 
workers; Vancouver Home for Girls, four workers; Sydney 
Social Service Home, Nova Scotia and the Manitoba Social 
Service Home, Winnipeg. The Maritime Home for Girls, Truro 
Nova Scotia, with fourteen workers and the Interprovincial 
Home for Young Women, Moncton, New Brunswick, with five 
workers, were operated in cooperation with Boards of other 
denominations. In addition to these active in social 
welfare work were Earlscourt Children’s Home, 1 oronto, six 
workers; Farm Centre for Boys, Munro, Ontario, four workers 
and Maclean-Malpas Memorial, Thorold, one worker. 

The redemptive homes admit delinquent girls and young 
women who need gentle, firm guidance and a positive 
Christian influence. The four homes located at Montreal, 
Winnipeg, Calgary and Vancouver, in 1926 admitted 158 girls 
89 babies were born, 16 girls given temporary shelter and

123 discharged. Of the girls brought in, 124 were 
maternity cases, seven prostitution or court cases, 19 
delinquents, 19 diseased and 27 mentally deficient. In 
1927 only 86 were admitted. During these two years 31 
united with the church, ei restored to their parents, 89 
sent to safe positions, 90 children placed in good homes 
nad 16 married in the Homes. Many of the girls after they 
received sufficient training were located in good homes. 
Careful observations and investigations made in these 
Homes has revealed that mental deficiency, lack of home 
training, the motor car, sensational movies, broken 
promises, economic conditions, immodest dress, desire for 
excitement, themodern dance, bad companionship, strong 
drink and narcotic drugs contributed chiefly to female 
delinquency. 

The Church expanded this type of work. The Cedarville 
School for Girls, Georgetown, opened in 1929, cared for 15 
girls in 1930. The industrial depression produced a moral 
breakdown which increased the demands upon redemptive 
agencies. The lack of funds, however, hindered the 
expansion. In 1937, 171 girls were admitted into the seven 
redemptive homes while 154 were already receiving shelter 
at the beginning of the year, which made a total of 325 
girls. That same year 82 joined with the church, 73 were

restored to their parents, 73 sent to safe positions and 
5 children placed in good homes. A further increase of 
demands upon redemptive v/ork was brought on by World War II. 
As for example in 1943 the number of girls admitted totalled 
258, children born, 131, receiving temporary shelter 52, 
while 207 were discharged. 

‘The chief institutional work among boys was found at 
the Farm Centre, Fullerton Township, Ontario, which helped 
between 40 and 50 boys each year, as a result of bad 
companionship, faulty home training, lads drifted into 
anti-social ways, -as they needed a change of environment 
to reestablish their character such boys were sent to this 
school where they received elementary instruction in farm¬ 
ing, were taught good citizenship and were inspired by 
Christian ideals. 

These homes and institutions constitute chiefly the 
the organized redemptive work of the Church among jnvenile 
lelinquents. However, the Church realizes that prevention, 
as a means of overcoming delinquency, is better than cure. 
Constantly it has helped adolescent boys and girls by means 
Df its C.G.I.T. (Canadian Girls in Training) and Tuxis 
groups which are the official ' teen-age clubs of the United 
Church. In these clubs it has taught proper girl and boy

•relations, the dangers of* loose and unclean living and the 
advantages of a pure, wholesome life. .For example, during 
the past two years at All People’s Mission, Edmonton, out 
of 300 Tuxis boys, three-quarters of whom come from the 
rougher areas of the city, only two have passed through the 
Juvenile Court. 


The campaign of the Board of Evangelism and social 

Service against the liquor traffic began by the appointment 

of a staff which promoted temperance and prohibition 

propaganda in the various provincial organizations. The 

Board’s new policy of a four-fold treatment read as follows: 

"Against the incitement of personal desire the 
Board seeks to promote personal discipline and 
abstinence; against the pressure of social 
custom the Board proposes organized example; 
against the perversion arising from ignorance 
of the true nature of alcoholic symptoms and 
experience, the Board proposes adequate and 
reliable education; while against the subtle 
but ever-present influence of highly financed 
campaigns of inducement to drink the Board 
invokes the action of the state. But fundament¬ 
al in this is the recognition that the centre of 
the problem is the depleted personality which 
can be enriched only through the spiritual 
ministry of the Gospel and the better organization 
of social and recreational life."(l) 

This involved the cooperative efforts of the members of the 

Board of Evangelism and Social Service, the Women’s 

Missionary Society, the Board of Religious Education and

Provincial Temperance Organizations to promote total 
abstinence by distribution of effective literature and the 
imparting of scientific information to the students in 
Normal Schools throughout Canada. 

x he Board reported in 1939 the establishment of an 
increasing number of Temperance Posts by the Ontario 
Temperance Federation. The same year a successful temp¬ 
erance convention was held in northern Saskatchewan. The 
Social Service Council and Temperance Alliance of Nova 
Scotia continued in its efforts to promote temperance 
education and to effect a greater measure of control of 
government sale of beverage alcohol. The temperance forces 
of New Brunswick were successful in preventing the estab¬ 
lishment of beverage rooms. 

ihe Church which forsaw the possibility of an increase 
in the sale of liquor with the outbreak of war, 1939, took 
immediate action. In 1940 a delegation which represented 
the larger Protestant Churches (of which one was the United 
Church), the Roman Catholic and the Canadian Temperance 
Feceration interviewed six Dominion Cabinet members. This 
delegation requested of the government: 

1. That all retail sale of liquor in beverage rooms, 
taverns, etc., be stopped and that it be confined 
to government owned and operated liquor stores.

2. That hours of sale in liquor stores be reduced to 
five per week day. 

3. That all liquor advertising in Canada be prohibited 
except on the actual premises on which liquor was 

legally sold. 

4. That, if and when beverage rooms, etc., are closed, 
wet canteens in military camps should be abolished."(1) 

Immediately following the interview several thousand 

Canadian citizens which included United Church members 

signed petitions in which the government was asked to grant 

these requests. fhe government took no immediate action 

except to decide that canteens were not to be opened in camps 

in connection with the compulsory military training. 

About this same time the Canadian Temperance Federation 
promoted a total abstinance campaign for the duration of 
the war and the period of demobalization. Dr. K. Bobson, 
Associate Secretary, Board of Evangelism and Social Service, 
of the United Church for British Columbia and Alberta, by 
means of sermons, addresses, lantern slides and the 
distribution of pamphlets aia mucn to promote the temperance 
sentiment in western Canada. The ministers at the request 
of the Temperance Federation, presented to their local 
congregations the temperance pledge and vow. 

Provincial action proved successful to some extent. 

The legislature of Bova Scotia closed the liquor stores on

Saturdays and reduced the hours of sale on other week days, 
ftew Brunswick ordered the liquor stores closed at six 
o’clock each day. Quebec restricted the sale of liquor. 

The western provinces moved more slowing in introducing 
changes in their liquor legislation. 

In September 1942 a delegation sent from the Tenth 
General Council of the United Church interviewed Prime 
Minister King and requested further Federal restrictive 
measures. Immediate action which included a broadcast 
address by the Prime Minister was promised. In December 
of that year the government reduced the quantity of spirits 
thirty percent, wine twenty percent and beer ten percent 
to be released for consumption for the duration of the war. 
The government increased the tax on alcoholic beverages 
and prohibited liquor advertising in Canada except on 
premises where liquor was legally manufactured and sold. 

In 1943 the consumption of beer, spirits and wine decreased 
and there was less drunkenness 

The temperance campaign of the United Church has been 
a vigorous one. It has extended an influence upon federal 
and provincial governments, helped to create a public 
opinion favorable to restrictive measures, increased the 
effectiveness of temperance education of church members and

increased in number the provincial temperance bodies* 

However, in spite of these achievements there has been an 
increase in the amount of consumption, therefore the 
Church will have to appeal to its own members and educate 
them to total abstinance. 

The United Church opposed gambling on the grounds that 
it was economically, socially and morally unsound. When the 
Dominion Senate in 1932 attempted to legalize sweepstakes 
for hospital support the Board of Evangelism and Social 
Service protested to every member in Parliament and suggested 
to presbyteries, official boards and individuals the need 
of them expressing strong protests against the adoption of 
such a law. The Bill did not go through. Another attempt 
was made to introduce the Bill in 1938 but again the 
widespread protest of the Church was too great. 

After the outbreak of war gambling methods such as 
lotteries, raffles and draws to secure funds for charitable 
and patriotic purposes appealed to many people. The Church 
opposes the use of gambling devices in the local congreg¬ 
ations and it requests its members to discourage such devices 
within the communities. The Church stresses the motive of 
giving to charitable institutions and war service organiz¬ 
ations as an act of Christian service. A lottery or raffle 
appeals to people because of what they might get out of it

rat her than what they can give. Therefore lotteries and 
raffles are contrary to the ^hurch ! s ideal of service. 

The Church adopted a definite attitude toward cheap 
and unclean literature and hooks which were widely in 
circulation. The task to keep such literature off public 
book stalls is impossible, however, as a partial remedy 
for this the Church has undertaken to cultivate a taste for 
good, clean literature in the minds of the young by means 
of Sunday school and church libraries, education in boys 
and girls clubs, young people's groups and service clubs. 

During the war years seven-day-a-week activities have 
been encouraged. In 1939 the .attorney General of Ontario 
gave permission to the government of that province to 
introduce certain commercialized sports on Sunday. Protests 
from the Lord's Day Alliance, Churches, newspapers, country 
councils and many citizens were so strong that such a 
project was abandoned. Several attempts have been made to 
hold concerts and theatrical performances on Sunday to 
raise money for patriotic and benevolent purposes, but 
again the influence of the Church discouraged such 
proposals. Another suggestion was introduced into some 
Canadian cities of which Edmonton was one, to operate free 
picture shows in down-town theatres for members of the

armed forces and their friends. Due to opposition from 
the Church the government took no further action. 


The Church must instruct all the people under its care 

in the proper use of this day as one of rest and worship. 

"The Church has no•right to ask that its citizens 
be compelled to perform any religious duties. 

The state has- done its duty when it secures for its 
citizens such freedom from labour as will enable 
them to use this day for rest and worship, or any 
other legitimate purpose.. It is the church's 
duty to urge upon its people, not only abstinence 
from unnecessary labour, but also to devote the day 
to rest ox uody and mind, and the cultivation of 
the higher things of the spirit."(l) 


Moral Reform is not neglected by the Church. The 
Church has followed two main lines of action. First, to 
protest and request of federal and provincial governments 
that they introduce new legislation which would improve the 
existing moral conditions; second, to instruct its members 
so that they as Christians will maintain social rurity, 
temperance, honesty and integrity. 


During the years 1930-39 unemployment proved itself 
the greatest and most serious of the immediate problems 
confronting the Church. Families lacked a sufficient 
income. Young men and women left home in search of employ¬ 
ment but none was to be found. Thousands turned to freight-

riding and begging. Their future appeared to be nothing 
more than a hopeless confusion, ihese were the people whom 
the Church helped. The service rendered by institutions 
and redemptive agencies has been mentioned already. 

The problem of relief became so serious in the city 
of Vancouver, for example, that the cities appropriation 
for relief work for 1932 was exhausted by the end of Ui ay. 
First United Church, Vancouver, came to the rescue as 
"the voice and pen of Rev. Andrew Rodden aroused the 
conscience and opened the purse strings of the citizens of 
Vancouver". As a result the hungry and homeless received 
partial care and help. 

The dried out areas of southern Saskatchewan and 
Alberta paralleled and contributed to the seriousness of 
the depression period. A -any found themselves destitute and 
others moved northward to pioneering communities where they 
tried to make a new start. Never before did the people of 
Canada experience so much poverty and unemployment. The 
Church took the lead in exhibiting the spirit of personal 
and practical Christian service. The Home Mission Board 
was responsible in part for the organization of the National 
Relief Committee. By means of it in the winter of 1931- 
32; 

"Two hundred tons of second hand clothing in good

condition went from our people to those in need, 
especially in the dried out areas, and no fewer 
than 160 carloads of fruit and vegetables which 
came from as far east as Prince Edward Island 
and as far west as the Okanagan Valley, were sent 
by the framers and fruit growers of our church to 
the parts of the prairies where the need was 
greatest. These gifts were distributed to men, 
women and children of all faiths and all races. 

This bearing of one another’s burdens, this 
sharing of the needs of our less fortunate fellow 
countrymen, not only did a great deal to bring 
East and West together in spirit as they have not 
been joined for years, but thousands who have 
been critical of the Church have come to acknowledge 
that the Christian spirit as expressed through the 
fellowship and service to the Church is a real 
asset in our national life. Just how much joy, 
comfort, strength and helpfulness our missionaries, 
doctors and nurses, deaconesses, teachers, and 
social service workers have brought to these who 
were almost defeated in the struggle, eternity 
alone will tell. But from homes in the slum 
districts of our great cities, from construction 
camps on our far-flung frontiers, from farmers in 
the dried out areas, from homesteaders beginning 
life afresh in the New ^orth of our western 
Provinces, from lonely settlers along our coasts, 
from New C a nadians, strangers in a strange land -- 
have come to the Home Mission Office scores of 
letters telling of gratitude and appreciation of 
services rendered in all kinds of ways by 
representatives of the United Church of Canada.”(1) 


Each year the National Emergency Relief Committee, in 
cooperation with the Women’s Missionary Society, and the 
Y/omen’s Associations appealed for donations of relief 
clothing, bedding and books which in turn were distributed 
to the needy in rural and urban areas. Through the co¬ 
operation of the two Canadian railways, which granted free

transportation for all relief supplies, bales of clothing 
and carloads of fruit and vegetables continued to reach 
the prairie provinces. For example, in 1937 five thousand 
bales of clothing were shipped to the dried out areas in 
Saskatchewan and Alberta. In addition 918 carloads of 
fruit and vegetables were shipped to the same areas. In 
response to a Christmas fund appeal over the C.B.C. in 
December of the same year the Committee was able to bring 
cheer and happiness with hampers of food, clothing, games 
and books to homes which otherwise would have had nothing. 
The following year the National Emergency Relief Committee 
reported the shipment of 4,490 bales of clothing to the 
prairie provinces and 174 bales to northern Ontario, while 
the joint committee of the churches for western relief 
reported 918 carloads of fruit and vegetables which reached 
the dried out areas. 

On several occasions the Board of Evangelism and 
Social Service presented to the Dominion, provincial and 
municipal authorities the urgent conditions of need and 
pointed out to them their inadequacy of response. The 
Board had representation on the Canadian Welfare Council 
to draw up "The Program in Summary", the duty of which was 
to fix residence and responsibility for relief as between 
Dominion, provincial and municipal governments. The

unemployed still were allowed freedom to look for work. 

The whole question of enemployment demanded of the 
Church an intense study of and attempts to improve upon 
the industiral, economic and social conditions within the 
Dominion. A standing commission was appointed by the 
executive of the Board of Evangelism and Social Service 
at its meeting, October 29, 1937, 

"To view the work of Economic and Social 

Research in the light of the social ideals of 

the Christian religion."(1) 

This Commission with Principal Walter T. Brown of Victoria 
College, Chairman, and Rev. I. R. Mutchmor, Secretary, 
chose as its first subject of study Social Security. The 
central group which consisted of eight ministers and 
professors, thirteen laymen, representatives of labor, 
social work, finance, actuarial science, education and 
agriculture, met in Toronto. Consultative groups were 
organized in Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton, Winnipeg, Regina, 
C a lgary and Vancouver. In May of the following year the 
Commission presented its report before the Royal Commission 
on Dominion Provincial Relations. In the report reference 
was made to the increasing industrialization of Canadian 
life. Due to the rapid growth of manufacturing, con¬ 
struction, mining and transportation in Canada, the 

proportion of industrial workers to the total population

showed a marked increase, although agriculture would 
remain for some time to come the basic occupation of 
Canadian people. 

The next topic for research was "Industrial Organ¬ 
ization and Collective Bargaining" which dealt in part¬ 
icular with labor, legislation, the formation of labor 
unions and the relation of organized religion to labor. 
These reports provided helpful material for study groups 
throughout the Church. The Board hoped that such study 
would stimulate interest and arouse action by individuals 
and groups. 

During the war years the Church has expressed its 
appreciation to the government for the action it took in 
limiting the number of working hours to eight, setting a 
minimum wage limit and permitting bargaining and the right 
to organize. The 1941 Board meeting of the Toronto 
Conference Evangelism and Social Service Committee crit¬ 
icized Mr. McLarty, the Minister of Labor, for his failure 
to give leadership in industrial problems. 

The Church’s attitude toward industry is summed up 
best by reference to the action of General Council in 
regard to the United Church Publishing House. 

"The Committee expresses its appreciation of the

efforts made both by the Board of Publications and 
the Toronto Allied Printing Trades Council to 
effedt a collective bargaining agreement, but as no 
mutually satisfactory agreement has been reached, 
the Committee, therefore, while making no pro¬ 
nouncement on the question of the closed shop in 
general, but confining ourselves strictly to our 
own practical concern, recommende: 

That this Council instruct the Board of Publication 
to sign a Collective Bargaining Agreement with 
their employees in the Mechanical Departments of 
the United Church Publishing Eouss as represented 
by the Toronto Typographical Union NO. 91; Toronto 
Mailers* Union No. 5; Toronto Bookbinders and 
Bindery Y/omen’s Union No. 28; Toronto Printing 
Pressmen and Assistants * Union No. 10, and Toronto 
Stereotypers and Electrotypers Union No. 21, such 
agreement to stipulate: 

(a) All employees of the United Church Publishing 
House now members of the above mentioned unions 
shall maintain their membership in good standing 
during the life of this agreement, as a condition 

of employment. 

(b) All new employees shall be members of the 
unions or become members within thirty days of the 
date of entering employment, as a condition of 
employment. 

(c) Present employees under sixty years of age 
or having less than twenty years service, be 
required to join the union within thirty days of 
the date of signing the agreement, as a condition 
of employment. 

(d) In the event of failure to reach agreement 

a Board of Arbitration shall be set up, consisting 
of two representatives from the Toronto Allied 
Printing Trades Council, two from the Eoard of 
Publication and a chairman to be mutually agreed 
upon, and failing such an agreement to be selected 
by the Regional War Relations Board for Ontario. 

The finding of the Board of Arbitration to be final 
and the cost of the Chairman to be borne equally 
by both parties. 

(e) All the above stipulations to be subject to 
National Selective Service Veterans 1 Re-establishment 
and other government regulations."(1)

The most urgent industrial problem with which the 
United Church dealt was that of unemployment. Wages were 
low, jobs scarce and the number of unemployed many. In¬ 
deed the Church seemed helpless to change the existing 
economic conditions. But it did two things; first, the 
immediate pressure was relieved to a great extent by its 
relief work among the poor and unemployed. Second, 
commissions were appointed to study industrial and 
economic problems and to submit to the government suggestion 
for improvement. With the outbreak of war unemployment 
was no longer a problem. 

The Church realized the importance of agriculture and 
saw the need of keeping it in a healthy condition so as 
to maintain or increase the production of food. The rural 
people who constituted a large percentage of the Canadian 
population were the concern of the Church. Subsequently 
the Board of Evangelism and Social Service at its annual 
meeting in 1944 set forth five essential lines of action: 

1. Some sort of parity as to income and living stand¬ 
ards as between farmers and other classes, must be 
brought about. 

2. All people and all classes should cooperate to 
accelerate technological improvements in agriculture, 
so as to cut down the real cost of producing food. 

3. Rural education should be re-examined and re-appraised 
to see whether or not it can be better adapted to 

the needs of country people. We do not suggest that

those who grow up on the farms should be deprived 
of the advantages of a 1 liberal 1 education or 
arbitrarily confined to one occupation. On the 
contrary, we believe that all people should know, 
understand and feel that humanity has taught, felt 
and done, down through the ages, and that no undue 
pressure should be exerted to prevent farm boys 
and girls from entering other occupations. But we 
do believe that the economic disabilities under 
which farmers have labored for so long, together 
with the influence of Tural schools, have driven 
young farm people away from a life work where they 
would be, under other conditions, far more happier 
and more useful. May it not be then that we need 
some different types of rural schools and teachers 
especially trained to serve them. 

4. The place and function of religion in rural areas 
needs also to be re-examined and re-appraised, and 
more consideration given to the rural church .... 

The conception of the rural church as the centre and 
source of inspiration and rural community life may be 
new to many in this generation, but it is worthy of 
careful and sympathetic consideration. 

5. Of no less importance than the school and the church, 
and much more primary in historical evolution, is 
the basic social unit, the family. It is in the 
family that the individual first enters human 
society; it is there where social attitudes are 
first developed. None can over-emphasize the import¬ 
ance of the home in the development of any civil¬ 
ization. 

It surely becomes clear, therefore, that all people 
should be interested in establishing and maintaining 
the home, the school and the church upon the highest 
positive levels, and more especially concerned with 
rural homes, rural schools and rural churches, which 
are of such vital importance not only in the 
production of food but protecting and improving the 
'seed bed* of the whole population. tf (1)

along these lines by means of adult education groups, 
church, home and school cooperation, healthy and clean 
recreation and community mindedness. 

•‘•'he United Church at Sangudo, Alberta, seventy-five 
miles northwest of Edmonton, the past two years has become 
the guiding force of that community. By means of the co¬ 
operation between school, community and church adult 
education classes, boys and girls clubs, young people 1 s 
groups, community recreational activities, plays, concerts, 
the obtaining of guest artists and speakers have been 
made possible. Indicentally, there followed a renewed 
interest in Sunday worship, Sunday school and mid-week 
church activities. 

The Church, by means of its influence upon Federal, 
provincial and municipal governments through local congre¬ 
gations and organizations has promoted in part such a 
program for the rural communities. 

World War II has made further demands of entirely 
different nature upon the church: first, the necessity of 
supplying chaplains to minister to the moral and spiritual 
needs of enlisted men. Second, to provide material aid 
such as books and clothing to enlisted men; and third, to 
work in cooperation with war service activities. To give

leadership in these three fields a War Service Committee 
within the Church was formed immediately following Canada’s 
entry into the war. 


jah. agreement between the Church and the Red Cross 
was reached whereby: 

"1. Every minister and church member was urged to 
support the Red Cross financial drive. 

2. The plan of War Service Units was adopted, so 
that our church groups and organizations might 
remain intact, and thus might respond to the 
maximum extent in the provision of material aid. 

3. The United Church War Service Units agreed to 
undertake knitting and sewing in accordance with 
the requirements as set out by the Red Cross, 
and in line with their instructions. It was 
understood that supplies could be obtained from 
the Red Cross Branches, provided that finished 
articles of equal weight (or yardage) were 
returned.”(1) 


The local churches from coast to coast have responded 
well to these needs and demands. War Service units have 
been organized in the majority of the local congregations. 
Even by the end of 1939 the War Service Units numbered 
928 which included as many as 2,784 church organizations. 
At the end of 1941 60,000 women in 1,018 units produced 
572,363 pairs of socks, 145,600 sweaters, 22,897 wristlets, 
76,392 scarfs, 138,317 pairs of mitts and gloves, 55,416

bandages, 19,326 pneumonia jackets, 43,951 hospital gowns 
and shirts, 63,431 helmets and caps, 21,324 face masks, 
48,967 blankets and quilts, 109,310 handkerchiefs, 352,806

articles, 135,871 Childrens garments, 117,659 refugee 
articles, 69,440 other hospital supplies, 3,324 layettes. 

In addition letters and Christmas parcels were sent to the 
men in the services. Churches welcomed members of the 
forces to the worship services and local groups have 
entertained them. 

On the other hand the Church did not hesitate to 
oppose the government and military authorities when her 
conscience told her to do so. For example, the government 
after it made plans to begin one of the Victory Loan drives 
on Easter Sunday, 1943, with great celebrations, parades 
and dedication services, requested the Church to do its 
part with special prayers, sermons and talks. Immediately 
the Church informed the Goverhment that if such Easter 
Sunday celebrations were held the Church would refuse to 
participate in them and would give no support to the War 
Loan Drive. The government decided upon Monday. 

As yet little can be said of the Church’s success in 
meeting the all-important post-war issues. However, the

Church 1 s general attitude toward post-war years can be 
noted: 

1. The initiative, thrift and inventiveness of the 
system of free enterprise should be maintained. 

2. The values of planning, proven and developed in a 
period of war must be carried into the period of 
peace and reconstruction. 

3. The basic importance of organization, as organization, 
must be regarded as a paramount and significant 
factor. Whether the free enterprise method, or the 
planned economy method or a combination of both 
be adopted, it is clear that more, not less, 
organization will be required tomorrow than today. 

4. The Church should say that the strong must bear the 
burdens of the weak, both within the nation and 
among nations. The Church should point out that 
there are many members, but one body; that there is 

in Christian Doctrine a sound basis for collect¬ 
ivism. It should be asserted that the whole is 
greater than the part. Within this nation the 
Chijrch should urge a larger measure of unity and 
to this end to do its utmost to create a co¬ 
operative spirit and a win lo victory for the 
higher ends of peace. Canadians should be asked 
by the Church to take a sane and constructive 
view of such a momumental work as the Howell 
Sirois Report. 

5. The Church must call for honesty and sacrifice, 
for tolerance and fair play. She must point out 
that goodwill and common sense are proven solvents, 
that love is greater than fear, peace and justice 
higher ends than strife and war. 

6. The Church must set herself strongly against those 
who stir up hatred, who utter the lie of the half 
truth, who use power, whether it be of a strong 

mass organization or of capital resources, for 
selfish ends. 

7. In the accelerated and more extensive organization 

of post-war life the Church must help man to progress

from the right to vote to the right to work 
(maximum employment) and the right to live (social 
security, equality of opportunity, more equitable 
distribution of wealth). Only in this way can 
the Christian principles of service, freedom and 
fellowship be translated into economic realities. 

8. The Church must strive for an economic order in 
which the principle motive of business and industry 
will be that of service for all rather than gain 

or special privileges for a few. 

9. The Church must bring the moral principles of the 
Christian faith to bear on all economic systems, 
judging their weakness and/or strength by eternal 
standards of justice and brotherhood."(1) 


During a period of twenty years (1925-1945) the 
United Church has met problems and remedied conditions which 
have arisen in Canada in times of prosperity, depressions 
and world war. The Church has brought pressure to bear 
upon federal and provincial governments by means of 
resolutions and requests. It has instructed and inspired 
Its members to Christian action and service. Lastly it 
has stood for fcnd taken the lead to right that which was 
wrong regardless of the forces in opposition.

Chapter VI 


THE EVALUATION 









Chapter VI 


THE EVALUATION 

The work for which the Methodist, Presbyterian and 
Congregational churches were responsible has been accom¬ 
plished more effectively by a united body than by each 
acting independently. The importance of the United Church 
in the life of the Canadian people has been great although 
much is left yet to be done. The Church has been in the 
forefront, linked with the forces which have operated for 
the good of the people in almost every relation of life. 

Many immigrants each year have been grateful to the 
Strangers Department of the Church for its aid by means of 
which they have been able to adjust themselves more 
readily to C a nadian customs. At the ports of arrival the 
chaplains met the newcomers and gave to them helpful 
advice. The names were forwarded to workers in local 
congregations whose interest it was to interview personally 
each new Canadian. As a result the United Church became a 
church home for many. However, the spirit of nationalism 
which has been retained and the lack of sufficiently 
interested leaders to minister to particular nationalities 
has caused a large proportion of the non-Anglo Saxons to 
renew the church loyalties which they previously held in 
their home land. For example, a large element of the

Ukrainian population in Edmonton could be retained at All 
People’s Mission if the Mission were able to obtain a 
Christian Ukrainian leader. As a result many have gone back 
to the Greek Orthodox Church or lost church connections 
altogether. They wish to retain their old customs which 
has hindered the process of integration. 

The work among the Chinese has been slow and at times 
discouraging. The reasons for this are chiefly two: first, 
a growing nationalistic feeling, and second, the attitude 
that Great Britain and Canada were guilty of discrimination 
against and neglect of China. Consequently the Chinese 
have looked upon Christianity with suspicion and doubt. 

The percentage of °hinesfe touched by the Church has been 
small. For example in Edmonton, Alberta, 1941, of a 
population of four hundred Chinese, the Chinese church roll 
recorded eight families, fourteen members and twenty-eight 
in Sunday school. The same year in Calgary ninety-four 
Chinese out of a population of 799 were church members. 

The activities sponsored among the young people have proved 
to be the most successful work much of which is promoted by 
All People’s Missions. 

The Church can make a greater impact upon the Chinese 
by breaking down the two barriers just mentioned and by

more concentrated visitation of them in their homes and 
places of business. 

The Japanese have responded in a much more encouraging 
manner. The Japanese Christian Church in Canada has 
insisted on church membership with the result that a strong 
church loyalty has developed. Its membership has stood the 
test of evacuation. Those who were members previous to 
their evacuation from British Columbia have become active 
in the congregation of the community in which they have 
settled. The number of Japanese associated with All 
People’s Mission, Edmonton, has increased from thirty to 
over sixty during the past three years. 

Many United Church members are bitter toward the 
Japanese and wish to refuse them admittance into their 
church activities. This intolerance and lack of under¬ 
standing on the part of the Canadians arises from an 
ignorance of the real meaning of the universality of the 
Christian Gospel. In too many instances ministers and 
laymen have kept silent rather than create a sympathetic 
understanding of the Japanese. In all localities, especiall 
those in which the Japanese are situated, the Church must 
foster racial toleration and must itself take the lead. 


Ihe small number of East Indians in Canada has not

necessitated extensive work among them. They, like the 
Chinese, were prejudiced against British rule and were 
hesitaht to accept Christianity. 1 'he Church did manage 
to create a better understanding among the East Indians 
toward the British rule by means of instruction. Today 
many are Christians. Activities such as kindergartens, 
boys* and girls 1 clubs, Sunday schools and day schools 
achieved the most successful results. The work of the 
United Church among the East Indians will not be enlarged 
due to the slow decrease in their population. 

As a means to destroy race prejudice and promote the 
spirit of cooperation I suggest in particular three lines 
of action: First, in all theological colleges of the 
United Church there should be the study of "International 
Relations" so that all students for the ministry should 
receive a thorough appreciation of the background from 
which other nationalities come. The ministers then would 
be more capable to cope with racial problems within the 
communities. Second, study groups among both the young 
people and adults should adopt as part of their program 
discussions on "International Relations"* Third, culture 
clubs in the local communities should be organized. An 
example of this is to be found in Edmonton where there has

been formed "The Society for the Development of Canadian 
Culture and Unity” which holds its meetings alternately at 
Talmud Torah Hall and Bissell Memorial Church, in these 
groups which have an active membership composed of rep¬ 
resentatives of nearly every nationality within the city 
there is an interchange of cultural possessions such as 
music, art, crafts, religion and education. It is really 
the Christian Gospel in action in the field of international 
relations. 


The city missions have contributed greatly to the 
welfare of the non-Anglo Saxons by means of their varied 
program in which people of different nationalities partici¬ 
pate. But the missions lack a sufficientnnumber of leaders, 
representative of the several nationalities, who could give 
guidance and help to their own people. If such leaders 
could be ontained the spirit of loyalty among the non- 
A.nglo Saxons could be retained more easily. 

™0ur conviction is, however, that unless there is 
a change of attitude on the part of many of our 
ministers and people of the United Churches, The 
United ^hurch of Canada is in danger of becoming 
an Anglo-Saxon sect. There is a basic measure of 
goodwill, but we have detected significant traces 
of smugness, exclusiveness and prejudice in our 
Church towards the non-Anglo Saxons. Here and 
there, perhaps unintentionally and unconsciously, 
a somewhat unfortunate approach has been made to 
our non-Anglo Saxon people. We are persuaded that 
the Church should be jolted out of its complacency

with respect to this matter and we call upon our 
ministers and people to re-examine their own basic 
conceptions of the Church and its function and 
their fundamental attitudes toward people of racial 
and national strains other than their own. 1 

Unless we can successfully fight against hatred, 
prejudice and unfairness in C a nada now, what hope 
is there of founding, after the war, a new world 
in which justice and peace and brotherhood shall 
reign? The United Church must lead the campaign 
against all unfairness, all lack of charity and 
all injustice toward the minority groups in Canada, 

We must welcome fellow-citizens of all nations to 
the fellowship of the United Church. If we do not 
do so we are not worthy of the name of Christians."(1) 


The contribution of the United Church hospitals has 
resulted chiefly from their catholic outlook, itfot only 
have they ministered to the health of people, the majority 
of whom were non-Anglo Saxons, but have deepened the 
spiritual life of its patients, promoted community projects 
advanced moral standards and set the pace in racial 
toleration. Nor have they sacrificed their high standards 
of excellence. Lamont Hospital, the contributions of which 
have already been mentioned, is a good example. 


Many of the schools maintained by the United Church 
have been made unnecessary by their success. The Church 
operated the schools in areas where no other means of 

education was possible. Several of those districts have 
become sufficiently settled and the church has so stimulated

the desire for education that increased facilities offered 
by the government have been necessary. Consequently 
public and high schools were erected. The Department of 
Education also serves many of these areas through its 
Correspondence Branch. 

The church schools, besides furthering education, have 
helped to develop the spirit of racial toleration for they 
have offered to boys and girls of varied nationalities the 
opportunity to live and work together. 

Even though the Marine Mission trips along both 
coasts appeared unproductive at times because of the long 
distances travelled in comparison with the few people 
touched, yet they made their contribution. By no other 
gleans would the people have received medical aid, education, 
religious instruction, and reading material. This in 
itself prevented lonliness among the isolated people * 

In the post-war years the Church ought to remain in 
the field of hospital, educational and marine work because 
of the increase of immigration which is expected. This 
will necessitate new hospitals, schools and mission boats 
to serve frontier areas. 


The Indian mission program of the United Church has

consisted of evangelism, health and education. The 
Indians have responded, although slowly. Witchcraft and 
superstition still exist regardless of the attempt to 
introduce the modern methods of medicine and surgery. The 
Indians have become self-supporting to a great extent due 
to the cooperative efforts of church and government. At 
the day schools and residential schools many Indian boys 
have received instruction in reading, writing, new methods 
of farming and stock raising, while the girls have learned 
to cook, keep house, care for gardens, sew, read and write 

Much of the training offered the Indian children in 
residential schools and homes is impractical. For example 
the girls when taught to cook have access to a gas range 
and modern utensils while the boys learn to farm with the 
best machinery. When they do return to the reserves the 
modern conveniences are not available. Their school 
training then benefits them very little in their home 
environment where the more crude methods are still in 
existence. The policy of the Church should be to reverse 
the big-institution policy. On every Indian reserve the 
Church ought to instigate a community centre. For this 
admitedly difficult work the finest personnel of preachers 
teachers, doctors and nurses should be available and a 
definite cooperative program of a practical nature be

sponsored by church and government* 

In the realm of moral reform the facilities for the cure 
method among delinquent girls has been more extensive than 
that among boys. There exists today a lack of Christian in¬ 
stitutions to which delinquent boys might be sent where they 
would be cared for and instructed sympathetically in good 
citizenship, Christian living and useful hobbies. Here lies 
vast field of work for the United Church. 

More important still new methods of prevention must be 
found. Delinquent parents ought to be instructed in import¬ 
ance of family and home life. In addition a better under¬ 
standing between parents and children should be promoted. 

The Church could sponsor family nights where fathers, mothers 
boys and girls worship and play together and engage in hand¬ 
icrafts and hobbies. The establisment of counselling where 
families could die suss their problems from the standpoint of 
religion, morals and life’s values could make a tremendous 
contribution which no other group could offer. 

A greater emphasis on boys’, girls’ and young people’s 
activities fcrust be stressed. Every Jocal church should 
have its hobby groups which give expression to the creative 
ability. The Church could be the centre of recreation 
for young people of the community. The local church must 
be a community centre as well as a place of worship. 

If young people cannot find recreation in the

Church they will turn elsewhere. Only a limited number of 
churches offer such facilities for youth projects. It 
is hoped that the churches of the future with their places 
of worship, gymnasiums and swimming pools plus good leader 
ship will develop in the young people keener intellects, 
stronger physiques, nobler characters, purer citizenship 
and a determined desire for Christian service. Juvenile 
delinquency, then, would be decreased. 

1‘he Church has taken a strong stand against the 
liquor traffic, gambling, immoral literature and Sunday 
sport. Generali Council has shown clearly by its very 
attitude that there is no place in an ordered society for 
such evils. Constantly the Board of Evangelism and Social 
Service has helped to influence the government to enact 
new legislation which restricted such indulgences. More¬ 
over the Church has appealed to its own membership not 
only to abstain from gambling, Sunday sport, drinking 
intoxicating beverages and reading cheap literature but to 
exert every means of influence possible upon bthers to do 
likewise. In spite of all these efforts there has been 
an increase in the immoral practices. Therefore the 
Church even to a more marked degree must continue its 
two-fold program, first, to instruct individuals, and 
second, influence the government. The Church must not

- 156 - 


depend too much on legislation but rather rely upon the 
efforts of its members whose help is required. The real 
remedy of corruption in public life is the continual 
proclamation of the Christian ideal of life, duty and 
service within the nation. The more that men, women, and 
children can be influenced to real Christian service the 
greater will be moral progress. 

1 'he Church has concerned itself with research on 
industrial problems but actual noticeable achievements are 
few. As a result of the Collective Bargaining Agreement 
between the Board of Publication and the employees in the 
Mechanical Departments of the United Church Publishing 
House urged by the eleventh General Council demonstrated 
the Church’s willingness and ability to meet the needs and 
demands of industry. The Church must carry this influence 
of collective bargaining and unionized shops into the 
whole field of Canadian industry. 

In rural areas the greatest contribution has been 
made by the churches which have become a real part of the 
active life of the community. The contribution of the 
United Church at Sangudo, Alberta, which has already been 
mentioned, signifies the value of a community-minded church 
which promotes cooperation between school, home, community

league and church for the betterment of recreational, social 
moral, educational and religious life. However, many rural 
churches are failing completely as they emphasize only 
a one-sided religious program which so often does not 
touch persons outside the regular church attenders. To 
promote a well-rounded community program in which the 
Church participates for the betterment of all, every 
minister should be trained more adequately in rural sociol¬ 
ogy and religious education. This, then, is the greatest 
contribution which the church can made for the life of 
any community. Much has been achieved but much still 
remains to be done. 

The United Church responded well to the demands of war. 
By means of the chaplaincy service, war service units, 
cooperative work with the Red Cross and hospitality 
provided by congregations and local groups to members of 
the armed forces, the United Church contributed to. the 
immediate needs. Many ministers have written periodically 
to those who have enlisted from their congregations, and 
have given spiritual strength to the remaining family 
members at home. The Church has not sacrificed the 
Christian ideals of love, brotherhood, mercy, truth and 
purity for any narrow patriotism which however has been 

emphasized to a limited degree. On matters of conscience

the Church was not afraid to oppose the government and 
military authorities. The Church has offered moral and 
spiritual guidance to the nation. 

Whatever is achieved in the post-war years to better 
the social, political, industrial, economic and moral 
conditions of the Canadian people, the Church must stress 
upon governments, organizations and individuals the fact 
that such achievements are made possible not by man’s 
strength alone, but by God-given powers. Any civilization 
whose foundations are rooted in God through the teachings 
of Jesus Christ shall endure in the years to come. 


"No organization, religious or secular, has a 
greater duty in Canada in informing and creating 
a sane and forward looking opinion on vital 
religious, moral and social issues than has the 
United Church. This Communion also has a share 
in the same task on the world front. This res¬ 
ponsibility humbles us, compels us to seek God’s 
help and demands that we do our duty with courage 
and vigour, in this difficult field, made harder . 
by war. It is recognized that ours is a wide¬ 
spread country whose population contains people of 
various national origins. It is encouraging to 
note, however, that the United Church has three- 
fourths of a million members, 5,406 ministers, 
and over 7,000 preaching places. The United Church 
is &oing all possible to create public opinion 
in the crowded city areas, on the back concessions 
and on the frontier."(1)
