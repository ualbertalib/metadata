THE NATURE AND CAUSES OF INVIABILITY 


AND DELAYED aERl^'IBTATION IN SEED OATS 


Norman G-able Lewis 


ABSTRACT 


Ttie object of the investigation was the determin¬ 
ation of circumstances under x^hich the phenomenon of de¬ 
layed germination in Avena sativa occurred, and the 
production at will, of material exhibiting the phenomenon. 
The latter was accomplished in the two years, under cir¬ 
cumstances in which oats matured in September and were 
stored at low temperatures during the winter. The dormancy 
is not considered of greater depth than that in comparable 
material harvested earlier in the season, but it is

thought that it is preserved longer by low temperature. The 
dormant seed is fully germinable at a temperature of 15°C. 
but is inhibited in tests at 20^0. Probable causes of this 
inhibition are indicated in the results b^t, examination of 
the physiology of the problem is left for the final paper. 

The effect of frost is not yet ascertained. It is 
shown, however, that seed producing normal seedlings from 
frosted samples behaves similarly in repeated tests to seed 
from non-frosted samples, and that a given sample may thus 
show both frost damage and delayed germination. 

INTRODUCTION 


The seed oat crop produced in 1935 in north central 
Alberta, exhibited a combination of immaturity, frost dam¬ 
age and delayed germination, causing difficulty in the Seed 
Laboratory throughout the winter testing season. With the 
object of producing oats of similar behaviour so that labor¬ 
atory studies of the problem could proceed, this investiga¬ 
tion was commenced in 1936. The report given here is 
preliminary in nature; complete data of the two years work 
not being yet available.

Factors in the Production 
of the crop of 1935 


The crop was harvested in Septemher, its growth 
period having been prolonged by rain and its maturing period 
by low autumn temperatures. Frost, varying in intensity with 
locality, occurred on August 16th when the crop was in the 
late flowering or early milk stage. Frost also occurred on 
September 4th, and a series of heavy frosts toward the latter 
part of September affected the very late grain. Winter temper¬ 
atures commenced with the fall of permanent winter snow on 
October 7th. The following data are descriptive of the crop.

From observations made in that ^^ear, the writer believes the 
data descriptive of the earlier cut cats in each district. 
Weather data show that sunshine hours were low in June and 
July and that temperatures during the maturing period were 
too low for very active vegetative activity or rapid drying 
of grain. Rainfall in the Peace River area established a 
record and the number of days per month on which rain fell 
was unusually high.

History of samples 
received at Laboratory 


Samples were harvested during the low temperatures 
of autumn and stored during the winter at lower temperatures# 
Samples received at the laboratory would be drawn from bins 
at probably sub-zero temperature and would then travel in 
heated mail cars for from one to three days on their journey 
to the laboratory at Calgary. They might be tested immediately 
or filed for some time owing to pressure of work# 

Method of Testing 


The blotter test had been discarded for use in the 
case of immature or frosted seed, in favor of a test in sand 
at 18°C. to 20°C. Cardboard boxes, of sufficient volurae for 
tests of 100 seeds were used, the seed being covered to a 
depth of one-half inch. Duplicate samples of 100 seeds each 
were germinated in a constant temperature room and counted 
at six and twelve day intervals. 

Interpretation of Tests 


Owing to shortage of good seed and to the expectation 
that much seed oT low viability would be used by farmers in

the following spring, it was thought that official tests 
should not over-estimate the viability of samples. For this 
reason, seedlings without roots or shoots, or those showing 
marked abnormality, were counted as inviable. 

Behaviour of Samples in Test 


The germination of samples received early in the 
’ winter was low. This was attributed, at first, wholly to 
frost damage; but as the germination of samples tended to 
rise toward spring, it was seen that delayed germination 
was also a factor. In the tests conducted at 20^0*, delayed 
germination occurred in association with a high proportion 
of "hard” or slowly permeable seeds, and a greater number of 
abnorraal sprouts and decayed seed than might be found in a 
sample which had reached its full germinating capacity. Repeat 
tests did not consistently show an increase of germination 
with time of storage, but many gave erratic results. Germin¬ 
ating in a borrowed refrigerator at lO^C., resulted in satis¬ 
factory tests, but this equipment was inadequate to cope with 
the large number of samples received. Samples sent to the 
Winnipeg laboratory in April showed as much as 65% of delayed 
germination in tests made at 20^C. Samples germinating over 
90% in May had given as low as 18% in early winter tests.

Review of Literature 


In '8 twenty-year study of the longevity of seeds, 
Sifton (13), using oats from eastern Canada and the North-west 
Territories (Alberta), found a progressive increase in germin¬ 
ation until the fifth year. He used alternating temperatures 
of 30^ and 20*^C*, since found too high for northern grown oats. 
He found a difference in the longevity of seed produced in 
different years, and attributed the difference to temperature; 
seed growing in a cool wet year being more resistant to ageing 
than that produced in a warm dry year. He suggested that long 
lived seed in a given sample might produce plants with this 
factor for longevity in their genetic constitution. 

Johnston (6), used University of A.lberta stock of regis 
tered Victory oats in studies of the inheritance of delayed 
germination in reciprocal crosses between Avena sative and 
Avena fatua . In similar crosses it had been shown by Aamodt, 
Manson, and Johnson (1), that segregation occurs for three 
grain types; sativa, intermediate and fatua, in the mono-hybrid 
ratio of 1:2:1. Johnson^s genetieal anal^^-sis of germination 
results obtained from the first three hybrid generations, 
indicated that germinability is inherited on the basis of three 
factors of ma‘ e or less eq^ual potency, one of which is linked 
with the factor for grain type. The mode of inheritance sug¬ 
gested by Johnson presumed the following parental genot37pes: 

Avena sativa (wA){wA) A^ Ag A^ A^ 

Avena fatua (Wa)(¥a)

At the time of testing, embryos having completely 
recessive genotypes were non-germinable, and those with one 
dominant allelomorph were non-germinable. Erabryos with two 
dominant allelomorphs were to a very great extent germinable 
and those with more were germinable, 

Johnson (6), found certain discrepancies in germin¬ 
ation from theoretical ratios to be correlated with time of 
testing* This applied to the non-germinability of embryos 
with one, two, or more dominant allelomorphs. He inferred 
that shortly after harvest only embryos with six dominant 
allelomorphs A^ Ag A3 Ag are germinable. As time 

goes on, embryos with a progressively smaller number of dom¬ 
inant allelomorphs become germinable. The triple recessives 
(A. fatua) ag ag ag ag are the last to germinate. 

Larsen, Harvey and Larsen (8), in Minnesota, studied 
the length of the dormant period of cereals cut in the soft 
dough, hard dough, and ripe stages. Samples were stored at 
O^C*, 7°C., and 14^0., tests being made at E0®C. w-ith counts 
on the third, fifth and seventh day. ?/hen stored at 14*^0., 
late oat varieties cut in either the hard dough or ripe stagey 
showed no period of after-ripening but those cut in the soft 
dough stage req^uired six weeks. The three classes stored at 
0°C*, required from six weeks to more than two months. Late 
oats required a longer period than early oats and varieties 
also differed in length of their rest period. Among the vari¬ 
eties with the longest period was Victory 514. Cutting immature

or storage at low temperatures, increased the length of the 
rest period. 

Delayed germination of cereals has been extensively 
studied in the seed testing stations of Denmark end Sweden. 
Dorph Peterson (12), refers to the failure of seed to germin¬ 
ate well until a certain period after harvest has elapsed, as 
due to the seed not being ”germinating-rlpe”. In Denmark, 
wheat is usually "germinating-ripe” in October and November; 
but after moist cool summers the condition is delayed until 
sowing time or later in the case of barley and oats. Investi¬ 
gations showed that cutting off the distal ends of the seed 
removed the inhibiting cause and gave germination comparable 
with that of the seed when ^^germinating-ripe^\ As the cutting 
of the seed does not touch the embryo, the lack of ^germinating' 
ripeness^^ was not considered due to a latent condition of the 
embryo, but to certain inhibitory effects of the seed coat. 
Samples of wheat, oats and barley harvested at progressive 
stages of maturity and germinated immediately and at monthly 
intervals, i/ere fully ^^germinating-ripe” at the fourth test. 
Stored in the laboratory all samples were about normally dry by 
the second test, and most of them had reached full germinating 
capacity, but the germination speed Ywas still low. In the case 
of the oats, the green ripe (gluraes greenish, milky’’ to tough 
dough) gave, as a rule, the largest germinating capacity and 
those fully ripe the smallest. When seeds ?;ere germinated at

three different temp era tui*es, 18° to 20°C. ; 14° to 16°C.; and 10° 
to 14 C., samples not after-ripened germinated best at the lowest 
temperature, while the ^’germinating-ripe’^ samples germinated almost 
equally at all three temperatures, but most rapidly at the highest. 

Dorph Petersen gives evidence that the germination of seed 
exhibiting long delayed germination is favored in the field in the 
ensuing spring by low temperatures. 

Hyde (5), discusses delayed germination in oats in New 
Zealand and his conclusions are in agreement with those of 
Peterson (12). He states that dormant oats germinate if tb.ey are 
first placed for about six days under moist conditions ht a 
temperature within a few degrees of the freezing point of water. 
Thereafter they will continue to grow at higher temperatures in 
a normal way. Under warm conditions, 20° to 3C°C., oats germinate 
completely only after the lapse of months and, furthermore, after 
a period of several days under these moist conditions, the seed 
loses its capacity to respond to the stimulus of low/ temperatures. 
Fully after-ripened oats, on the other hand, germinate within a 
wide range of temperature, from near freezing point to as high as 
3C°C., the optimum temperature being about 2C°G. Hyde states that 
germination of non-after-ripened oats is of the sarae order in the 
field as in the laboratory at similar temperatures. It is the 
practice in the seed testing station at Palmerston, North., 

New Zealand, to prechill to find actual viability and test at

alternating temperatures from 30° to 20°C., to find the approx¬ 
imate rate of germination to be expected in the field if the 
seed is sown immediately* The time occupied by after-ripening 
varies from season to season* It proceeds slowly after a cool 
rainy summer. Artificial after-ripening may be brought about 
by drying or storage at 30°C. for about four weeks, but 
temperature, not moisture, is the most potent factor. Storage 
at low temperatures prolongs the period required for after¬ 
ripening. Prolonged storage at 3-O^C* adversely affects vitality. 

The effect of frost upon seed oats in the field has 
been studied by Fryer (3) (4). He found that 2° to 3°F. of 
frost did not injure grain at any stage of maturity nor did 
4° to 6°F* of frost (accompanied by heavy dew). Frosts of 

5° to 8°F. occuring on consecutive nights injured oats in the 

early milk to dougb stage but not those in the dough to dry 

mealy stage. Tests were made in November and December after 

frosts occuring in September and early October. In a later 
paper. Fryer (4) shows that while freezing probably does not 
destroy the semi-permeable membrane of oats and wheat, permea¬ 
bility to water is increased in frosted seeds. The less mature 
the wheat at time of exposure to frost the greater was the 
effect of frost on the kernel and the greater was the increase 
in speed of absorption. 

Levitt and Scarth (9( have recently shown that increase 
in permeability of protoplasm is more closely correlated with

frost hardening (and drought resistance) than any other single 
mechanism in the frost hardening of living cells. 

Booth (2) found that controlled temperatures from 31^F. 
to 27°F. for one to three hours had no effect on the germ¬ 

ination of oats. Samples were cut in the field and exposed to 
frost as rapidly as they could be taken to the freezing chamber* 
Lewis and McCalla (10), using a similar method of controlled low 
temperatures with wheat, found .that frost exposure greater than 
4*^^* reduced the percentage germination in direct proportion to 
the severity of the frost. Susceptibility to frost damage de¬ 
creased with maturity and after the grain reached a 58% dry 
matter content, its susceptibili'ty to damage by frost was nil 
or very slight. 

Tedin and Garsner (14) in Sweden, studied naturally 
frosted oats in laboratory and field tests. Normal seedlings 
from frosted samples produced as high a percentage of normal 
plants in the field as did normal seedlings from undamaged samples. 
They concluded that "healthy” seed in a sample heavily damaged 
by frost, was equal to the seed of a completely healthy sample. 
Secondary kernels were found to be less damaged by frost than 
primary kernels and the difference increased with increasing 
severity of frost. Fusarium infection was found to increase 
with frost damage and secondary kernels were less affected by 
Fusarium than primary kernels. Johnson (6), in physiological 
studies of delayed germination in Avena fatua, found that the

secondary kernels exhibited longer dormancy than the primary 
kernels and that dormancy in the seeds increased from top to 
bottom of the nanicle. 

There appears to be no definite evidence available 
relative to the effect of frost upon delayed germination in seed 
oats. The evidence in the literature examined is definite with 
respect to the occurrence of prolonged dormancy in oats following 
rainy cool seasons. It is also definite with respect to the 
greater response of oats during the after-ripening period, to 
a lower temperature than 20^C. 


Material and Methods 


The bulk of the crop of seed oats produced in northern 
Alberta is made up of the varieties Victory and Banner. A 
large proportion of the lots of Victory are traceable to 
University of Alberta elite stocks and, for this reason, Victor 3 ’ 
oats secured from the University was used in this investigation. 

The investigation was divided into ti/o phases, in one of 
which pot grown oats were exposed to frost in a controlled 
temperature chamber, while in the other, oats were grown in 
field plots and were exposed throughout to naturall^^ occurring 
conditions only.

Methods in the Controlled 
Temperature Experiment, 1936 


In order to study the effect of frost upon oats at 
several stages of maturity, twelve hundred eight-inch pots were 
placed in a field cage. Two plants were grown in each pot, the 
main culms only being kept for treatment. Cats in groups of 
forty-five pots were exposed to frost at stages of maturity 
represented by 40^, 50^, and 60^ dry matter content of the 
grain. Frost exposures used were E8^F., S4°F. and EO^F. For 
data on the effect of duration of frost, groups of fifteen pots 
were taken out of the refrigerator at 3, 6, and 9 hour intervals 
during each frost exposure. For studying the pcssibilit 3 ?' of 
recovery from frost damage, each lot of fifteen pots was divided 
into three lots of five for harvest at the following periods 
after treatment, namely; immediately after, seven days after 
and fifteen days after. Pots to be harvested after seven days 
and fifteen days were returned to the field cage where untreated 
controls had been labelled and set aside. When the first freeze 
at 40^ diVy matter was finished, the treatment was repeated, using 
a group of pots which had been separated from the first group on 
account of their slightly later date of heeding out. All 
treatments were so repeated. Plants were not hardened before 
frostJior slowly thawed out after frost. Drj?^ matter determina¬ 
tions were made by individual tests of each of ten representa¬ 
tive panicles. The oats from each panicle were separated from

the leioma and palea, weighed in small cans, then dried at 98^0. 
for one hour. 

At time of harvest heads were loosely enclosed in cotton 
bags and stored in a shed. Oats were treated and harvested in 
August, threshed by hand in September, and forwarded to the Seed 
Laboratory in October, by frei^t. For the study of delayed 
germination, they were germinated in November, January, April 
and May. At the time of arrival at the laboratory, samples 
required for repeated tests were counted out. All samples were 
then stored cut-of-doors. Samples of 50 seeds in duplicate 

were germinated at 18° to S0°C. in sand with counts at seven 
and twelve days. 

Methods in Field Experiment 1936 


Six plots were seeded every ten days from May 15th 
to July 4th, to form a latin square of thirty-six plots. 
Weather data were recorded by means of a hygro-thermograph 
and a soil thermograph housed in the plots. Composite samples 
were^taken every two days from the end of pollination until 
the onset of frosty weather, after which all six plots of each 
seeding were sampled separately. Semples were cut with a 
sickle and stored in a shed. They were threshed with a hand 
thresher and electric fan in September. To show the differ¬ 
ences that might occur between seed stored outside in farmers^ 
bins during the winter, and samples stored in buildings, a

representative group of samples of each seeding were each 
divided into two for storage out-of-doors and in-doors* 
Samples were forwarded to the laboratory at Winnipeg in 
October, where all samples required for repeated tests were 
counted out, the samples then being stored under the required 
conditions* They were germinated in January, February, March 
and July. Samples of 100 seeds in duplicate were germinated 
at 18^ to EO^^C* in sand with counts at seven and twelve days. 


Results of Controlled Temperature 
Experiment 1936 


Oats grown in the pots produced large plants with about 
90 spikelets per panicle. When panicles were stripped of chaff 
for dry matter determinations however, it was found that s high 
proportion of flowers had failed to develop after pollination, 
while a further number produced seed which hardened or dried pre¬ 
maturely. It v/as thought at the time that this was caused by 
the aphid Macrosiphon gramarium , but the condition has since been 
observed in field plots in v/hich this aphid was not present* Some 
plants and some plots are more affected than others* The primary 
kernel is the one usually affected, the secondar:/ seldom showing 
the effect. Occurring in association with a small proportion of 
watery kernels it is somewhat similar to a condition described

in corn by Mangelsdorf (11), but was not further studied in 
this investigation. Tho reduced yield jnede it necessary to 
employ seeds in duplicate in germination tests and led to 
the occurrence of missing numbers in the May results. 

Results of the frost exposures at 28^. are shown 
graphically in Figures 1, 2 and 3. In these graphs the points 
were obtained by addition of the 50 seeds of each laboratory 
replicate. The results are thus shown on the basis of 100 
seeds per test.

The after-ripening period had apparently been passed 
or was just being concluded in November• This is seen more 
clearly in the seven day counts than in the twelve day counts. 
Owing to missing numbers in the May tests tbe graph is only 
indicative of what occurred in that month. The actual results 
are shown in Tables I and II, which include the complete 
figures for the 4° freezes of material at 50% dry matter. 
Results from the freezes at other stages of maturity are 
included in the appendix as they do not differ essentially 
from those for 50% dry matter. Appendices 1, 2, 5, 4. 

Differences in the effect of frost are due to 
irregularities of temperature occurring during certain runs. 
The large volume of radiating material, the small size of 
samples and sampling technique, were unsuited to the physical 
conditions obtaining in the refrigerator. Later work shows 
that 4° of frost, Fahrenheit, is not lethal but a drop to 6^ 
causes serious damage to immature unhardened material. This 
drop occurred during some of the 4^ freezes and led to high 
treatment error. Analysis of variance shows that significant 
results are confined to dates of test only, and that conclu¬ 
sions with respect to the comparative effect of different 
frost treatments, cannot be drawn. 

The important result shown is that both frosted and 
non-frested samples, regardless of stage of maturity, exhibit 
the same sort of inverted curve in the tests made.

The reduced germination in May v;as surprising. Its cause, 
whether residing in technique or in the seed, is not yet 
known. The increase of "browning” infection noted in May 
results, is not necessarily the cause but may be a secondary 
effect. Of interest is the high variation between duplicate 
laboratory tests when the seed is not responding to germin- 
ative conditions at 20'^C. This may be seen by inspection of 
the tables, or from the average figures and their coefficients 
of variation shown at the bottom of Table *i; , The signi¬ 
ficance of differences bet?/een these averages for dates of 
test was computed after subtraction of treatment variance 
from the total variance for each date of test. Owing to 
missing’ numbers in the May tests, the coefficients of varia¬ 
bility for all dates were determined directly by addition of 
the columns under each date. 

The 8° and 12^ frosts v/ere so severe that few samples 
produced any normal seedlings. The percentage of survival was 
so low that it was thought inadvisable to show the results. 

Tedin and Garsner (14) however, concluded that normal seedlings 
produced by heavily frosted seed were equal to the seed of 
unfrozen samples. As the 4^ freezes had shown that seedlings 
from frosted seed behaved in a similar manner to those from 
the non-frosted controls, llie normal seedlings, survivors from 
8^ and 12° frost exposures, were added together to find if they 
also behaved in this manner. The results are shown in Table III. 
Only samples allowing comparison of May results were used in the 


calculations.

The number of seeds used in each test is shown in the 
table and if the groups with a survival of less than 2% are 
ignored, the remaining groups are seen to vary from November 
to May in the same manner as tlB unfrozen controls. 

The figures in Table III show a progressive increase 
of germination until April and if this is not due to error of 
sampling, it might suggest that heavily frosted seed after- 
ripens more slowly than non-frested seed. It is likely that 
this whole experiment can be reviewed by a method of analysis

used by Tedin end Garsner (14) in their studies of oats 
showing various degrees of frost damage, and the effects 
registered by primary and secondary kernels. It seems in¬ 
advisable to discuss the subject of analysis however, until 
certain graphs showing the kind of trends to be expected in 
repeated germination tests have been presented in the next 
section of the paper. 


Results of Field Experiment 1926 


Samples from the field plots were germinated for the 
first time in January. Those from the first four seedings 
had finished after-ripening by this time and all but the most 
immature germinated nearly 100%. As most samples germinated 
fully in seven days during the months of January, February 
and March, they were dropped from the May tests to save work 
in the laboratory. l^Then the May tests of the artificially 
frosted material gave low results, it was decided to retest 
the field samples. This, however, was unavoidably delayed 
until July. The fifth seeding alone of the six (the sixth 
did not pollinate) showed delayed germination as measured by 
increase in percentage germination with time. As its germin¬ 
ation was low in winter tests on account of immaturity or 
frost damage plus dela^^d germination, it was germinated in 
both May and July.

It seems unnecessary to illustrate the difference 
betTween the first four seedings and the fifth by showing 
all the tables. The first and second seeding results are 
fairly topical and are shown in Tables IV and Y, in which 
the two laboratory tests of each determination are given 
to show variation between laboratory replicates in July

Delayed germination in the outside stored seed is 
pronounced, hut because the inside stored seed was germinating 
about its maximum in January, as were samples from earlier 
seedings, the dormancy could not be regarded as of any greater 
degree than that of earlier seedings. It can only be suggested 
that the dormancy was of longer duration in outside stored seed 
because of later production of the seed and preservation of the 
condition by low storage temperatures. This theory will be 
referred to again on P.37. 

The sampling techniq^ue was not sufficiently refined to 
enable comparison of samples with respect to the level of 
germination after frost. The oats were remarkable for having 
withstood, while immature, many hours of hard frosts. From the 
evidence provided by the controlled temperature experiments, one 
might regard the normal seedlings produced in laboratory tests 
of these samples as arising from undamaged seed behaving in a 
normal way. (Tables I, II, III.) These assumptions are tested 
in the experiments of 1937, in which the technique of sampling 
was improved. 

Aberrant May and July tests in the 1936 results may be 
attributed to differences in technique on different dates, to 
changes occurring in the seed from time to time, or to some 
change in environmental conditions acting independently of 
technique. 

In Table YI the difference in July between the germina- 
tion of the five samples stored outside and the five stored

inside, is higlil^' significant, as shown by the analysis of 
variance or by comparison of means of small samples. The average 
of the inside stored is 84.2^ germination and that of the outside 
stored seed is 93.1^. The probability of this difference being 
due to random errors of sampling, by comparison of means of small 
samples, is less than O.OCOl, Analysis of variance ntade upon the 
two treatments moreover, shows a highly significant difference. 

The variance for treatiD.ent over residual, gives an F. value of 
24.6, whereas a value of 9.07 only would be evidence of the 
difference being attributable to random sampling once in one 
hundred times. 

In the results from outside and inside-stored samples of 
the four seedings preceding the fifth, the position is reversed, the 
inside-stored seed being higher in germination in July, than the 
outside-stored seed. See Tables TII, YIII, and IX. In these 
tables, to save space, the seed analysts official figures are 
given instead of the duplicate results. Complete figures are 
given in appendices 7, 8, 9. 


Note: 

Page 33 is omitted as a discussion of the dispersion of 
various groups in Table Y1 was dropped, pending examination of 
the value of a recommended Chi-square test.

In the foregoing tables, the figures cannot be compared 
in a satisfactory way, comparable samples not being germinated on 
the same date, and many results showing slower speed of germin¬ 
ation rather than a reduced total germination. It is clear, 
however, that tests of outside-stored seed not showing delayed 
germination gave, during the winter months, more consistent results 
than did tests in May or July. It is hoped that results from 
1937 experiments will afford a better view^ of this behaviour. 


Production of Oats Showing 
Delayed Germination in 1937. 


Sufficient results are now available to illustrate 
the validity of the theory with respect to the production of 
oats showing delayed germination, developed after exaraination 
of Table 7T. Page 31. 

In 1937, plots were sown every ten days from May 15th 
as in 1936. At heading time of each seeding the uppermost 
leaf blade of plants heading at the same time was clipped with 
scissors, and marked plants only were sampled for both dry 
matter determination and germination tests. Duplicate plots 
were sampled. Samples were taken every three days from the 
end of pollination, dried in a shed and sent to the laboratory 
for germination one week after harvest, three weeks after and 
five weeks after. Later tests are to be made but results at 
hand are those for the first three dates of test. The samples 
were germinated at 18^ to 20^C. in quadruplicate tests of 100

seeds. As a check, 100 seeds in duplicate, were tested by 
germinating at 15^0. for the first six days and at 20*^0. for 
the last six days. In the tests at 20^0. counts throughout 
were made at six and twelve days. In the ’»pre~chill”test a 
final count only was made. 

Figures 6 and 7 show results obtained from the first 
seeding and the fourth seeding. The former matured in rela¬ 
tively warm weather before frost, the latter in the colder 
weather of September ending in frost. Both v;ere allowed to 
stand in the field, the former until thoroughly dry, the latter 
until the occurrence of a frost at lO'^F* occurring seventeen 
days after the oats could have been cut at a 58% dry matter 
content, when all kernels had turned yellow.

The figures shov; that seed from both early and late 
plots, germinates best at the lower temperature, and that 
the earlier harvested seed rapidly reaches a stage at v;hich 
it germinates readily at both temperatures. The germination 
of the late harvested seed is low at 20^C. The figures clearly 
show the reason why seed, harvested at the usual time, gives 
satisfactory results in tests made at 20^0., and why later 
harvested seed gives unsatisfactory results for some time in 
such tests. The former passes its so-called after-ripening 
period before it is sent to the laboratory, the latter does 
not • 

In 1937 all seedings but the first show a fairly 
marked delayed germination in tests at 20^0. for the first 
three dates of test. This requires explanation upon the 
basis of the crop history, which will not be made until 
completion of the 1937 results. It is thought that it does 
not alter the validity of the simple conclusion reached 
with respect to the production of seed showing delayed ger¬ 
mination. The six-day counts in tests of all seedings, 
shovi a progressive decrease from that of the first seeding 
to that of the fourth, in which it will be noted the six-day 
count lies along the zero line in contrast with its rapid 
rise in the first seeding. 

The slow loss of moisture in the fourth seeding 
contrasted with that of the first, may be seen by comparing

the maturing periods of the two seedings and their respective 
rates of loss of moisture. 

With respect to the subject of loss of moisture, weather 
records for 1935, 1936 and 1937 show that September weeks have 
an average temperature between 50^?. and 60°F. In the last half 
of the month the average may fall to as low as 51°F, These 
averages were measured by weighted means of hours between £0^ 
and 30^,- 30^ and 40^, etc. from thermograph records. A lower 
average temperature is only prevented by the flattening of the 
curve of night temperature by dew fall. The grain is bathed in 
dew from 7 P«M. to 10 or 11 A^M. the following morning. A com¬ 
bination of high humidity and low temperature thus confines 
maturing or drying to an hour or so about mid-day. 

When humidity is low, radiation is so high after sun¬ 
down, that frost ensues. In view of the usual retention of 
moisture by damp grain throughout the winter, it seems likely 
that grain harvested in September when tough or damp, retains 
a high proportion of its water content until the onset of higher 
temperatures. The probable differences, therefore, between seed 
represented in figure 5 and that in figure 6, would be, by the 
time of the third test, a higher moisture content in the latter, 
together v/ith less progress toward the shrunken stage and a 
potentially more active respiratory substrate. 

The probable importance of respiration as a cause of 
differences between the two seedings and the two kinds of test, 
is shown in the figures by the sharp drop in germination occur-

ring at about 40% dry matter. This mai-ks a period of rapid 
development with high respiration in the embryo and the begin¬ 
ning of the color change in the seed. 

The rise which follows the drop in germination 
appears from the figures, to be correlated with loss of moisture 
which proceeded mors or less normally in the first seeding and 
which was impeded in the fourth as explained. 

The higher germination preceding the drop appears to be 
associated with weakness shown by the lower "pre-chill^ total 
compared with that of later samples. It is higher perhaps, 
due to the immature stage of the grain and the absence of the 
restrictions placed upon permeation of water by the seed coat 
membranes which cutinize and suberize at a later period of 
development. It is exhibited by normal spindly seedlings. 

The difference between the two tests is mainly attribu¬ 
table to ungerminated seeds. It is not accounted for in 18-day 
counts of the seed germinated at 68°F. A few seedlings are 
abnormal, and a few germinate in eighteen days in the 68° test. 

The remainder are either attacked by fungus or remain impermeable 
and ungerminated* In the ^^pre-chill" test all these classes 
produce almost entirely normal seedlings in the 12-day count. 

Root growth is stimulated and plants emerge vigorously. Complete 
examination of changes in number of abnormal, diseased and 
impermeable seeds with time of storage has not yet been made. 

The drop in germination, recorded by the "pre-chill" 
test after 10° of frost, occurs also in the controlled temperature

germination. More repeated tests in both experiments are re¬ 
quired before its significance will be known. 


Discussion 


The investigation had as its object the production 
of seed exhibiting delayed germination and determination of 
the conditions under which the phenomenon occurred, so that 
material for laboratory studies could be produced at will. 

The work was started under the handicap of an idea 
partly preconceived and partly the result of statements found 

's. 

in literature reviewed, that delayed germination in Avena 
sativa was an unusual phenomenon occurring in certain rainy 
cool seasons* Literature most pertinent to the subject, was 
not available until after commencement of the investigation. 

In the two years work, however, oats showing delayed germina¬ 
tion were produced in plots maturing late and stored outside. 

It was assumed that a temporary failure to respond to germina- 
tive conditions at 20^0. was normal behavior, and that in oats 
matured and stored at low temperatures this characteristic was 
not more pronounced but was preserved longer. The results of 
1937 work now becoming available, show the characteristics of the 
phenomenon even more clearly than do results of 1936. They 
demonstrate that oats of both early and late maturity, germinate 
fully at a lower temperature, regardless of the stage of after-

ripening gauged by their germination at 20^C. 

Stiles (13 A) has shown that such a process, involving 
a changing response to temperature, is the result of the action 
of two forces, one a stimulus, the other an inhibition of 
enzjme activity. In seed, the course of these can probably 
be measured by change in the respiratory coefficient or, if 
anaerobic respiration is involved, the I/U ratio. These, however, 
would register an effect rather than explain the causes as a 
germination test registers an effect without explaining its 
causes. They would, however, provide evidence of an oxygen 
deficiency if that were a cause. 

A studjT- of the causes involves examination of the 
anatomy, ontogeny, and physiology of the oat and a knowledge 
of its behaviour under different circumstances. The complete 
results of 1937 experiments may therefore be prefaced with a 
review of the subject from this standpoint. In the present 
paper, the problem is brought to the point at which the physi¬ 
ology rather than production of delayed germination, becomes 
of importance. The effects produced by frost are not yet con¬ 
clusive and data relative to this and the value of the pre-chill 
test for germination of frosted oats is still to be obtained 
from later figures. The possibility of depression of viability 
in spring or sumiiier months also awaits confirmation from later 
results. 

The figures show trends invalidating the general applica¬ 
tion of analysis of variance the value of which, will be confined 
to comparisons between the same samples on different dates.

between equivelent saiuples of different seedings on equivalent 
dates, and between the two types of test of any sample or its 
equivalent in another seeding. 

If later results do not change conclusions reached with 
regard to the production of oats showing delayed germination, 
it would appear that five graphs representing the five seedings 
sampled in 1937, would give a complete picture of the factors 
involved especially if accompanied by a graph of weather 
observations in the three seasons under examination during the 
course of this investigation.
