A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF FOOD RELATIONS 


OF 


1HEAT STEM SAWFLY ( CEHIUS CINCTUS NORTON) LARVAE 


INTRODUCTION 


Hi© wheat stem sawfly ( Cephns cinctus Norton) is a 
major pest of wheat in Western Canada, In 1895 the first record 
of this species in Canada was made at Indian Head, Saskatchewan, 
by Fletcher (33)* Since that time the area of infestation has 
spread until it now covers the brown and dark brown soil zones of 
Alberta and Saskatchewan, 

A co-operativ© project between the Dominion Experimental 
Station, Swift Current, and the Dominion Entomological Laboratory, 
Lethbridge, was initiated to study sawfly resistance in wheat 
varieties. Kemp (65) found that the solid-stemmed varieties 
were more resistant to cutting than hollow-stemmed ones. A solid- 
stemmed, hard, red spring wheat, Rescue, was developed from a cross 
between two vulgar© varieties, Apex and s-615. Rescue, which 
was grown on a field seal© in 1946, showed a high degree of sawfly 
resistance in Alberta and Saskatchewan. However, at Regina, the 
resistance has not been satisfactory (80).

Platt et al (80) state that "variations in the nutrition 
of the plant, which in turn, might affect the nutrition of the 
insect" alone or in combination with other factors, may account 

for variations in the reaction of Rescue wheat to saxvfly damage. 

h 

Farstad* has noted that sex ratio, fecundity and form, determina¬ 
tion of the adult is influenced by the host plant (31). Because 
the nutrition of the wheat stem sawfly larva plays such an 
important role, Dr. jfarstad believed that a study of this problem 
would provide a source of much valuable information. Therefore, 
at his suggestion, this project was started in the spring of 1947 
with three min objectives:- 

First, to study the tissues of the wheat plant which are 
ingested by the wheat stem sawfly larva, 

Second, to determine the enzymes present in the gut of the 
larva, and 

Third, to make a study of the morphology and histology of 
the organs of the larva which are engaged in the process of 
ingestion, digestion and excretion.

ground for a study of the nutrition of £. cinctus and not a 
complete outline of all the work on insect nutrition. It has 
been arranged under eight headings. The first deals with 
enzymes produced by insects, the following five sections outline 
the nutrients utilized by insects and the final two deal with the 
effect of nutrients on fecundity, sex and form determination. 


HNZXMES 

Enzymes are organic catalysts produced as a result of 
cellular activity, but are independent of the presence of living 
cells in their operations. They show the properties of colloidal 
systems. Hydrolytic enzymes that have been crystallized are 
protein in nature, while oxidizing enzymes are usually made up of 
a protein carrier of high molecular weight joined to a simpler 
group, the prosthetic group i53i • In general the digestive 
enzymes of insects resemble those of other animals (10*7 j • 

Organic nutrients must be directly assimilable by the 
tissues of the insect (glucose or natural amino acids) or they 
must be hydrolyzed to assimilable components by the digestive 
system in order to provide the requirements for energy, growth and 
reproduction ;1G7). The ability to hydrolyze the organic materials 
lies in the enzymes. The enzyme system of an insect is a limiting 
factor to the range of diet upon which it can exist.

Hydrolytic enzymes are produced mainly in the cells or 
the salivary glands, the mid-gut and the various diverticula or 
caeca that are attached to it (107)* Enzymes may also he produced 
by symbiotic organisms that nay be round in the gut or in accessory 
structures (16, 1?, 96, 103 j . 

The salivary glands most commonly produce amylase and 
invertase only, while the mid-gut commonly produces the majority of 
the enzymes required for digestion. u-astric caeca or diverticula 
from the mid-gut increase the secretive area in many insects. 

Changes in the production of enzymes may be evident during the 
development of the insect. Eor example, caterpillars produce a 
wide range of enzymes, while the adults iLepidopteraj may produce 
invertase only ^ 107 ;. 

The cells producing digestive enzymes may act in unison., 
^synchronous#, and a single cell may have a single^fmonophasicy, or 
several^ fpolyphasic^ periods of activity. The production of enzymes 
in carnivorous insects is usually monophasic and synchronous, while 
in herbivorous insects, usually the enzyme production is polyphasic 
and asynchronous ^18). 

Insects as a class possess an extreiaely wide range of 
digestive enzymes, although an individual insect may have a single 
enzyme only ^e.g. adult lepidopteraj. The following is a partial 
list of the hydrolytic enzymes that have oeen reported.

5. LACTASE: has been demonstrated to be present in 
thirteen species of wood-boring beetles (76). 

6. HEMICEILULA5E A: is secreted by twelve species of 
wood-boring beetles (?6j. 

?. HESCtCELLULASE B: is produced in thirteen species of 
wood-boring beetles (76). 

Eraenkei (34) found that eight carbohydilates were 
hydrolysed by the digestive system of adult blowflies, although 
there were only two carbohydrates, sucrose and maltose, found in 
their normal diet. He explained the large number of carbohydrates 
hydrolyzed by the blowfly enzymes in the following manner. All 
disaccharides, trisaceharides, and glycosides are hydrolyzed by 
glycosidases whose action is determined by the identity of the sugar, 
the potential aldehyde carbon atom of which enters the glycoside 
link, and by whether combination occurs through the alpha or beta 
position. This means that five enzymes are capable of hydrolyzing 
all known disaccharides, trisaccharides and more complex glycosides, 
based on glucose, galactose and fructose. They would be alpha 
glucosidase, beta glucosidase, alpha galactosidase, beta galaetosi- 
dase, and beta-h-fructosidase^ This theory of enzyme action was 
first postulated by Weidenhagen (106). 

In termites the cellulase is produced by protozoa living 
in the gut (17). Also, protozoa in the gut of the wood-boring 
roach, Cryptocercus punetniatus , produce cellulase and cellobiase

necessary for the nutrition of the host (96, 111). 

CARBOHYDRATE S 

Insects differ widely in their carbohydrate requirements. 
The diet or some adult insects such as Lepidoptera (66) is 
exclusively carbohydrate, while adult T. eonfusum do not require 
carbohydrates (38). The larvae of the clothes moth, Tineola 
bisselliella , do not require carbohydrates (43)> whereas larvae 
of the moths, Kphestia sericarium , E. elutella , E. cautella , and 
Plodia interpunctella all require carbohydrates in their diet (44)• 
Beetles of the genera Stegobium and Lasioderma require carbohydrates, 
while those of the genus Ptinus do not, and are thus able to infest 
a much wider rang© of food materials such as tobacco, yeast, 
museum specimens, drugs, and wool fabrics (38). 

Carbohydrates are an important factor in the longevity 
of flies ( 103 ), and play a large part in the diet of the larvae of 
the European corn borer, Pyrausta nubilalis (8, 9)* Tenebrio 
molltor larvae do not grow at all on a carbohydrate-free diet (102). 
At least some insects are capable of utilizing carbohydrates to 
synthesize fat, starved larvae of Aedes aegypti form glycogen and 
fat reserves when fed on carbohydrates alone (108). 

Hive-bee larvae can live a relatively long time on a 
pure carbohydrate diet, although carbohydrates alone are not suffi¬ 
cient for growth (53, ?0). The order of efficiency with which

hive-bee larvae could utilize carbohydrates ±s as follows:- sucrose; 
maltose, melizitose, dextrose; trehalose, dextrins; galactose, 
lactose; starch and glycogen (5). 

The southern armywom, Prodenia eridania , when fed on 
young bean leaves utilized 56 per cent of the reducing sugars, 

99 per cent of the sucrose and non© of the starch (21). The 
larva of the mealworm T. molitor , when fed on a bran diet, was able 
to assimilate per cent of the fructose, 67 per cent of the 
glucose, 59 per cent of the starch and 36 per cent of the hemicellu¬ 
lose (28). 

Caterpillars of the species Malacosoma disstria utilized 
starch while Aglais urtieae and Pieria brassicae were unable to do 
so. The caterpillars of all three species utilized a higher pro¬ 
portion of the sucrose in their food than of glucose, and none of 
them utilized cellulose or hemicellulose (26). 

Brown (11) found that the grasshopper, Melanoplus bivittatus 
used monosaccharides completely but polysaccharides passed through 
the gut practically unchanged. He found that this grasshopper was 
unable to utilize starch grains. 

Cleveland demonstrated that termites were capable of 
living longer than eighteen months on a diet of pure cellulose 
(16, 17).

although it is known that insects, like vertebrates, require 
proteins or other nitrogenous foods for growth and reproduction. 

Many adult insects which have adequate reserves can maintain life 
for considerable periods in the absence of nitrogenous foods. 

However the growing stages and some adults without adequate reserves 
require proteins or their equivalent (102, 103), 

Parkin (?6) found that all the fourteen species of 
beetles which he examined from the families Scolytidae , Cerambycidae , 
Lycnidae , Bostrycfaidae and Anobiidae , digested protein, Prom this 
evidence he postulated that the larvae of all wood-boring beetles 
required protein in their diet. 

Proteins as well as carbohydrates are required by the 
adult hive-bee (?0) and by the larvae of Tenebrio (102). Keratin, 
the chief constituent of hair and feathers, forms an important 
part in the diet of the clothes-moth larvae, Dermestid beetles and 
feather lie© (43, 10?, 111). 

Larvae of the blew fly, Oalllphora erythroeephala , show 
a high degree of specificity for the proteins of higher vertebrates 
especially mammals. lichen fed on a diet of proteins from the flesh 
of birds their growth was slow©a down, while a diet of proteins 
from the flesh of amphibia and fish resulted in retarded growth and 
high mortality. Pur© proteins, such as egg albumen, peptones and 
amino acids alone were not sufficient for normal growth (6?). 

Larvae of Lucilia sericata require the addition of 
3 mgms. of cystine per ml. of sterile medium to produce normal

puparia and complete development (71). 

Bernard and Lemonde (4) found that the ten amino acids 
required by mammals could not replace casein in an artificial diet 
suitable for the growth of T. confusum , T. mol it or and ojogocierma 
ornatum . 

The larvae of Drosophila melanogaster grow as well on 
nucleotides as on ribonucleic acid. The growth promoting effect 
comes from the purines and pyrimidines especially in adenine, but 
not from ribonucleic acid as such. Guanine appears to have some 
effect in regulating the growth action of adenine. Desoxyribonu¬ 
cleic acid inhibits the growth and pupation of D. melanogaster (104) 

D. melanogaster larvae require casein hydrolysate or an 
equivalent mixture of amino acids (laevo forms) to support normal 
growth. Ribose nucleic acid is important and can be partially 
replaced by adenylic acid, but not by the purine or pyrimidine 
bases (90). 

Only the simplest amino acids are essential for the 
B. gerroanioa . The nymphs are capable of living for six months on 
a pure carbohydrate diet, but will not grow unless amino acids are 
also provided (103). On the other hand amino acids were found to 
have no effect on the growth of larvae of the mosquito A. aegypti 
(52). 

As termites can live for at least eighteen months on a 
pure cellulose diet, and carry out normal growth and reproduction.

it is believed that atmospheric nitrogen is fixed by the insect (16). 

When starved larvae of A. aegypti were fed on a diet of 
casein, they replenished their reserves of fat, glycogen and 
protein (108). Thus protein may act as a source of material from 
which the insect my synthesize its carbohydrate and fat require¬ 
ments . 

LIPIDS 

Lipids include not only the true fats, but substances 
that are chemically related to fats, or related to them because of 
common solubilities and possible biological relationships, such 
as lecithin and cholesterol (53)• 

Patty substances are used for energy, stored in the fat 
body, and do not take a critical part in tissue building. Pats 
may be synthesized from proteins or from carbohydrates (103). 

Lipase, the enzyme which hydrolyses lipids, is present 
in most carnivorous and necrophorous insects (107). Lipase is 
produced by the olive fruit fly Dacus oleae (103), the cattle grub 
Hypoderma lineatum (94), and many other insects (18). 

The best food medium for P. nubilalis is one which 
contains fat (9), whereas the larvae of T. bisselliella do not 
require fat in their diet 143). Larvae of the beetle JT. molitor 
utilize 83 per cent of the fatty acids present in bran (28) and 

wax moth larvae utilize approximately $0 per cent of the beeswax 
in their diet (10?).

Larvae of the stored product pests E. sericarium , E. elu- 
tella , E. cautella and P. intcrpunctella all require linoleic 
acid in their diets in order to produce normal scales and to ensure 
normal emergence of the adults, Linoleic and linolenic acids 
have an equal effect, whereas oleic acid has no effect (46). 
Cholesterol is essential for all four species (44). 

Arachidonie acid, unlike linoleic acid, has no positive

positive effect on growth. In both respects it resembles the

Cholesterol or another adequate sterol has been demonstrated 
to be essential in the diets of T. confusum (38), Attagenus piceus 
(56), Dermestes vulpinus (35, 50), Silvanus , Stegobium , Lasioderm 
and Ptinus (38). Cholesterol may be replaced in the diet by 
several related sterols. Tribolium , which requires no other fat 
soluble substance than a sterol, can utilize ergosterol equally 
well as cholesterol, but cannot utilize vitamin D (40). L. vul- 
pinus larvae can utilize the animal sterols, cholesterol, 

7 - dehydroeholesterol, cholesteryl acetate, and 7 - dehydro - 
cholesteryl monobenzoate for growth. However they cannot utilize 
plant sterols and are thus limited to foods of animal origin (35)•

fat ingested in the diet (18). The beet webworm, loxostege 
sticticalis , is not capable of synthesizing linoleic acid, but must 
obtain it from the diet (77). 

when starved larvae of the clothes moth are fed a 
carbohydrate or protein diet, their fat reserves are replenished. 

When fed a diet of fat, their fat reserves were replenished but 
the fat was not used to synthesize proteins or carbohydrates (108). 

MINERALS 

It is possible that mineral salts may constitute a limiting 
factor in the growth of insects on some diets (10?). Various salts 
are essential for most insects. 

Calcium is especially striking in its effect except with 
D. melanogaster larvae which appear capable of developing without 
it (102). Calcium has a favourable effect on the survival of the 
mosquito, Anopheles , for the first three days- of its larval life 
(3). Larvae of the mosquito Culiseta incidens require calcium 
for growth and to a lesser extent magnesium sulfate, sodium chlor¬ 
ide, or potassium iodide (49). Larvae of the mosquito, Ashes 
concolor , require calcium for normal development and calcium chloride 
is necessary for the normal growth of A. aegypti (102). 

Sodium is required in the diet for the normal growth of 
the larvae of the mosquito A. concolor but sodium chloride has no 
effect on the growth of A. aegypti larvae. Sodium is not required

by Drosophila larvae for muscular work (102). 

A. aegypti larvae do not require potassium chloride for 
normal growth, whereas Drosophila larvae require potassium in 
their diet for normal development but not for muscular activity 
( 102 ). 

Vegetarian insects have a high potassium concentration 
and carnivorous insects a high sodium concentration in their coelomic 
fluids. The ratio of sodium to potassium is a species character¬ 
istic and is normally governed by mechanisms of mineral regulation 
and not by the diet (?)• 

The rate of development of Lucilia larvae is proportional 
to the percentage of phosphorus in the diet (102). Similarly the 
time of pupation for Tribolium is inversely proportional to the 
amount of phosphorus in the diet. The percentage of phosphorus 
in the pupa of T. confusum is constant despite the percentage of 
phosphorus in the diet (72). Drosophila larvae require phosphoric 
acid for development.(102). 

Baseman (54) reported that the chinch bug, Blissus 
leucopterus , and greenhouse thrips, thrive better on plants which 
are deficient in nitrogen. 

Baiuns (22) found that B. leucopterus laid more eggs ©n 
Atlas sorgo and Finney milo seedlings growing in a nutrient solution 
containing a high percentage of nitrogen. Vi/hen these seedlings

were grown in a solution in which the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio 
was low the average egg deposition was also low, A high nitrogen 
content of spinach is positively correlated with lowered attack 
by thrips, but an increase of calcium in spinach which has a low 
nitrogen content reduces the effect of thrip attack ( 110 ). 

Grain aphids were only capable of surviving for a few 
generations on wheat which was deficient in nitrogen (54). In 
twenty-four hours the termite, Kalotermes flavicolls , is capable 
of synthesizing nitrogen in amounts equal to 65 per cent of its 
own weight ( 101 ). 

•Ih© caterpillars Alabama argillacea require copper and 
zinc in their diet ( 19 )j and the rat flea Noeopsyllus fasciatus 
needs iron for normal growth ( 93 ) • 

ACCESSORY FACTORS 

Unless all the complex organic substances in the body 
are synthesized by the insect from raw materials, these substances 
themselves, or special precursors for them, must be provided in 
the diet, Thee© are called accessory factors (10?). Most 
insects studied so far require only one fat soluble factor which 
is a sterol. However the sterols which are required, cholesterol, 
ergosterol, or related sterols, cannot b© replaced by the sterols 
of the vitamin D group. Many of the water-soluble vitamins are 
required by both insects and vertebrates (102). Vitamins may be 
completely or partially supplied by symbiotic micro-organisms in 
the gut of the insect ( 96 , 102 , 107 ).

Vitamin A may b© required in the nutrition of the 
European corn borer (9) and the cockroach, B. genaanica , can thrive 
on a diet containing vitamin A (10). On the other hand, the 
confused flour beetle can live on a vitamin A-free diet (72). 

Vitamins belonging to the B complex have been demonstrated 
to be important accessory factors in the nutrition of insects. 

The addition of total B complex to white flour in the larval diet 
of the confused flour beetle increases the rate of larval develop¬ 
ment and pupal•weight. When added to the diet of starved adults 

of T. confusum , their length of life was increased (89). Blowfly, 
CattLphoridae , larvae resemble higher animals in their B complex 
requirements. The chief effect of a deficiency of B complex 
from the diet is retarded larval growth. Blowflies are incapable 
of developing aseptically on a sterile diet without vitamins of 
B complex added (60). 

Thiamine chloride is essential in the diet of the confused 
flour beetle (37, 97, 98) and in the diet of the larval stage of 
the mosquito A. aegypti (13). larvae of the beetles Lasioderraa 
eerricorne and stegobium panicsum require thiamine in their diets 
(40). Royal jelly, which is fed to queen bees, exhibits 
vitamin activity equal to approximately 9 micrograms per 
gram of dry matter. Bee bread exhibits activity equal to 
6.4 micrograms per gram dry matter (57)« (One unit of B 1 
potency is exerted by 3 mierograms of crystalline thiamine chloride). 
When larvae of f. confusum are fed a thiamine-deficient diet the

£• cepkalonica , when fed on a diet deficient in thiamine, develop 
degenerative changes in the cells of the fat body, and accumulate 
large amounts ©f pyruvic acid (88) which disappear on the addition 
of thiamine chloride (86, 64). 

Riboflavin is an essential growth factor in the diet of 
T. confusum (2, 83), L. serricerne , S. paniceum , E, sericarium 
(37, 44) and A. aegypti (24). The rate of growth of the rice 
moth larva is proportional to the amount of riboflavin in the 
diet up to 1.2 micrograms per gram of diet (87). 

Niacin is a necessary factor in the diet of the clothes 
moth larva (43) of the stored products pests E* sericarium and 
E. gdutella (44) • When niacin is added to the diet of T. confusum , 
the larval period is shortened by one-third (2), and when added t© 
the diet of A. aegypti growth to the fourth instar is ensured (24). 
Symbionts of the beetles L. serricome and _S. panieeum supply their 
hosts with niacin (39). Sanaa states that apparently niacin is 
not required in the diet of the larval stage of the rice moth (8?) 
although Rubinstein and shekun (85) report that it is necessary. 

Folic acid, another of the B complex vitamins, and 
which is synthesized by micro-organisms in the human gut, is also 
synthesized by intestinal bacteria of the bed-bug, Cimex lectularis , 
(25) and may fee synthesized by bacteria in the gut of T* confusum 
(109). Folic acid is essential to larvae of A. aegypti in order 
to ensure pupation (24) and must be present in the diet not later

than the third instar (52). Two micrograms of folie acid per 
gram of dry weight of diet is required by E. sericarium , and is 
necessary in undetermined amounts in the diets of the beetles 
Tenebrio molitor and T, confusum (45)* The rate of growth is very 
slow if folic acid is absent from the diet of E. sericarium , 
although xanthopterin has the same effect as folic acid if supplied 
in quantities one thousand times greater than those of folic acid 
14$) * 

Pyridoxin© is essential in the diet of T. confusum in 
order to ensure pupation (2, 83), The larvae of the rice moth 
(8?), of E, sericarium and of E. elutella all require pyridoxin© 
(44), The absence of pyridoxin© results in retarded growth of 
the clothes moth (43)* The symbionts of the larva© of the beetles 
L. serricorne and js, paniceum normally supply pyridoxine to their 
hosts (39). 

Pantothenic acid is another of the B complex which is 
required by T. confusum (82), T. bisselliella (43)» E. sericarium 
and E, elutella (44)» in order to ensure growth. Pantothenic acid 
is not required by larva© of the rice moth (8?) but it is necessary 
to ensure growth of A. aegypti to the fourth instar (24). The 
symbionts of the larvae of S. paniceum and L. serricorne normally 
supply pantothenic acid to their hosts (39). 

Biotin has been demonstrated to be an important growth 
factor in the diets of the moths E. sericarium and p. interpunctella

and is less essential to E. elutella (44) • It is of doubtful 
value for larvae of T. bisselliella (43) but may be essential to 
ensure growth to the fourth instar of the mosquito A. aegypti (24). 
The optimum requirement of T. eonfusum larvae for biotin is 
0.05-0.1 micrograms per gram of dry diet (41). Pimelic acid and 
desthiobiotin my replace biotin for T. eonfusum , but are required 
in concentrations twice as great as that required of biotin (81). 

Inositol has some effect in increasing the growth rat© 
of E. sericarlum (44) , but the clothes moth can develop without it 
(43). 

Para-amino benzoic acid is not required by T. eonfusum 
(82)» T. bisselliella (43)» 35. sericarlum and E. elutella (44)• 

Ascorbic acid, vitamin C, has no effect on the larva 
of A. aegypti (24), but has a positive effect on the growth of 
Ephestla species. Ascorbic acid acts as an anti-oxidant on the 
saponifiable fraction of wheat germ oil (46). 

Vitamin D is not required by T. eonfusum (15, 72), nor 
by the larvae of the beetle D. vulpinus (35). 

Vitamin E, alpha tocopherol, added to the diet has no 
effect on the growth of T. eonfusum and P. interpunctella (40, 42). 
Vitamin E acts as an anti-oxidant in stabilizing the linoleic acid, 
in wheat germ oil, which is required by the moths:- 35. eericarium , 
E. elutella , E. eautella and P. interpunctella , in order to ensure 
good emergence and good scales on the wings. Vitamin E also has

a growth effect upon these moths (46). Hill and Burdett (59) 
claimed that vitamin E 'was present in royal jelly which is fed to 
queen bees; but this claim was disproved in later work by Evans 
et al (29). However it has been shown that royal jelly does 

contain a higher percentage of pantothenic acid than the food fed 
to worker larvae (102)• 

The intracellular symbionts or L. serricorne and 
S. panicearn provide their hosts with thiamine chloride,- riboflavin * 
niacin, pyridoxin and pantothenic acid (6;. 

: IHS EFFECT OF NUTRITION ON REPRODUCTION 

In most holometabolous insects all or most of the nutri¬ 
ents required for reproduction are accumulated during larval 
life. These quantitative and/or qualitative differences in larval 
feeding affect both the duration and fecundity of the resultant 
adults. When the reproductive organs of the adult are not fully 
developed on emergence, dolu tne feeding of the adult as well as 
larval nutrition affect its reproductive ability (102). 

The fecundity of females of Ceeidomlid species varies 
inversely with the number of larvae per floret and is also affected 
by the food plant and conditions of moisture under which the plant 
is grown (74)* 

Inclusion of yeast in the diet of Tribolium increases 
the egg production of the females (68). 

The pH of cell sap of eleven varieties of trees had an 


effect on the fecundity of aphids, acidity decreased and alkalinity

increased fecundity (27, 63 ). 

Under late summar conditions of light the rate of 
reproduction of the aphid Brevicoryne brasslcae is positively 
correlated with the protein content of the plant on which it 
feeds (2?)* A single wingless aphid placed on a young bean plant 
with the growing point intact produced 335 offspring, while a 
single wingless aphid on a bean plant with the growing point 
removed produced in the same period 105 offspring (23)* 

Haseman ( 54 ) showed that grain aphids, Maerosiphum 
granarium , produced few offspring where there was a deficiency of 
iron or nitrogen, and produced more offspring where deficiencies 
of sulphur, potassium, magnesium or phosphorus occurred. 

THE EFFECT OF MUNITION ON FUKM UETm/jlNATION 

The quantity and quality of food available during the 
growing stages of an insect may affect the size, sex and various 
other characters such as ©ye colour and wing proportion (102). 

Ho Ida way (62) working with T. confusma larvae advances 
the following alternate theories concerning the effect of nutrition 
on sex. 

(a) A proportion of the population is stable with regard 
to sex, while a proportion is more easily converted to the opposite 
sex. 

(b) Forms of either sex may b© changed to the opposite 
sex, but there are gradations of sexual stability that are upset

only after varying periods of time. 

The effect of nutrition ©n sex determination takes place 
through its action on the biochemical and biophysical state of body 
fluids and also on gem cells. There are at least gradations 
in constitution which show a relation between nutritional status 
dependent on time of starvation and ultimate sex determination. 

Vitamins may play an important part in sex and form 
determination. Quantitative larval feeding of the fly, Lucilia 
aericata , influenced the sex of the adults. The sex ratios when 
fed on different amounts of yeast were as follows:- one gram of 
yeast gave 3*3 males to 6.7 females, while four grams of yeast 
gave 5*5 males to 4*5 females (53). Goetsch (51) showed that 
vitamin *T complex* would induce the formation of soldier castes 
in ants and termites which previously had none, and also induce 
gigantic- or big-headed forms in certain other insects, often with 
an increased need for oxygen and with increased pigmentation. 

Protein in the larval diet may be a factor. The forma¬ 
tion of wingless forms of the aphid Brevieoryne brassicae is 
negatively correlated with the protein content of the plant host 
(27) • Aphids feeding on a young bean plant with the growing 
point intact produced a high proportion of winged individuals, while 
those which fed on a bean plant with the growing point removed 
produced a sms.ll proportion of winged individuals. ( 23 ).

REVIEW OF LITERATURE ON THE MJTRITXOE OF C, CINCTUS 

A general review of the literature on insect nutrition 
indicates that the insects most commonly studied are those which 
feed on non-living materials such as flour and other stored food 
products. Although progress on the nutrition of external plant 
feeders is not great, even less work has been reported concerning 
the relation of nutrients to mining and boring insects. All 
the literature on Cephus deals with the differences between 
varieties of wheat in their influence on £. cinctus as shown by 
Farstad (31) and Farstad and Platt (79, BO). The reason for 
this paucity of literature on insects which confine their feeding 
inside a plant is mainly due to the difficulty of preparing 
artificial media in a form which is acceptable to the insect. 

Farstad (31), Platt and Farstad ( 79 , 80) have shown 
that varieties of wheat influence the size, fecundity, and sex 
ratio of surviving populations. The succulence (moisture content) 
of the host plant influences the length of the larval feeding 
period. The size of the larva is increased with an increase in 
the period of feeding, and the size of the larva is positively 
correlated with fecundity and size of the adult. The number of 
instars is influenced by the host plant. 

The sex ratio of £. cinctus is influenced by the variety 
of the host (31) • In the Nobleford area no males had been found 
for several years although both sexes commonly occur in other 
areas ( 30 ).

ihrstad ( 31 ) found that newly hatched £. cinctus larvae 
will die unless they can start feeding on the succulent tissues 
near the area of active elongation. Larvae from eggs laid near 
the node will survive, while those from eggs laid near the head, 
in the same internode, will die. The female £. cinctus will 
oviposit readily in oats, although this plant shows a lack 

<3 O rnp /£ 

of^nutritional requirements for growth and development of the larva. 
Earstad also reports that the larvae will die when the eggs from 
which they hatch are completely surrounded by pith. It appears 
that the pith itself lacks essential growth factors, and if firm, 
the larva may he forced to expend too much energy in obtaining a 
sufficient supply of nutrients to maintain life. 

LXffE HISTORY 

The life history and habits of the sawfly have been 
outlined by Seamans (91 } 92 j and Griddle (20). Adults emerge 
from early June until mid-July and immediately commence oviposition. 
The eggs are laid in the lumen of wheat stems that are preferably 
in the "boot" stage. The larva, reported by Earstad (31) to have 
five instars in Marquis wheat, feeds on the inside of the stem 
until the plant reaches maturity. It then migrates to the base 
of the culm and girdles it at ground level. The exposed end of 
the stub is plugged with frass and a hibernaculum is produced. 

The mature larva is fully mobile within the stub during hibernation.

During late May and early June it pupates and emerges as an adult. 

The hibernaculum, which has been described as a "silken 
case”, is a transparent light-brown sheath resembling "cellophane” 
in texture and appearance. The use of the word "silken" is 
inappropriate as it implies that the case is composed of fibres, 
while the construction is actually that of a continuous membrane. 
Tests with iodine and sulphuric acid gave negative results which 
indicate the hibernaculum is not composed of cellulose. During 
August 194^, newly cut stubs were examined and found to be without 
hibernacula. A short time later, stubs from the same fiele were 
again examined and hibernacula were found in ail stubs. It is 
quite possible that they may be produced by the labial glands.

of any of the immature stages of £. cinctus . The feeding or 
immature stage of the larva has been selected for study, for upon 
reaching maturity, all feeding ceases, the gut is reduced to a 
thread-like organ, and fat body fills the periviseral sinus. 

ORGANS Cg INGESTION 

The mandibles are strong biting jaws of the ordinary 
phytophagous type possessing well defined incisor and molar 
regions (figs. 8, 9). Each is dieondylic with the outer edge 
of its triangular base strongly articulated at the pleurostomal 
region of the cranium. The musculature of the mandible consists 
of a dorsal abductor inserted on an apodeme attached to the 
outer margin of the mandible, and a dorsal adductor inserted on 
an apodeme attached at the inner angle of the mandible (fig. 9). 

The maxillae are closely associated with the labium 
and hypopharynx to form an under-lip complex.(fig. 10). Each 
maxilla consists of a distinct cardo and stipes, the latter bearing 
on its ventral extremity the lacinia, galea, and palpus (fig. 12). 

The labium is a simple structure consisting of a basal 
postmentum and a distal prementum, both of which are entirely 
membraneous (fig. 11). The prementum bears, on the distal margin, 
the three-segmented palpi and the ligula. The latter is a single

flap bearing the orifice of the labial glands in its ventral 
surface. 

The head capsule is strengthened along its subgenal 
region by a strong pleurostom&l ridge bearing the mandibular 
articulations. Anterior to the mandibles, a pair of epistomal 
bars extend to the anterior tentorial pits. These bars are 
connected between the pits by the epistomal ridge which separates 
the clypeus from the frons (figs. 3> 4)* 

The tentorium consists of a pair of anterior arms which 
unite with the strong tentorial bridge, a broad structure origin¬ 
ating in the post-occipital suture (figs. 5, 6, ?)• 

The labial glands (figs. 2, 24, 25) are a pair of 
elongate tubes which lie free in the body cavity at the sides of 
the alimentary canal. Each tube is U-shaped, the posterior ends 
terminating near the ventricular valve. The anterior part 
encircles the gastric caecum, and is enlarged to form a reservoir. 
Erom the reservoir a duct leads forward to unite with the duct 
from the other reservoir, forming a common tube which has its 
outlet in the ventral surface of the ligula (fig. 25). The 
probable function of these glands is salivary as well as providing 
secretion for production of the hibernaeulum. The labial glands, 
unlike the alimentary canal, are not reduced in the overwintering 
larva. 

THE ALIMENTARY CA1IAL 


The stomod&eum is little more than an inlet from mouth

to stomach (fig. 15). It consists of buccal cavity, pharynx, 
oesophagous, and proventricuius. The proventricuius is 

invaginated into the anterior end of the me senteron to form the 
cardiac or stomodaeal valve. The stomodaeal epithelium is 
thrown into longitudinal folds, and is covered by chitinous 
intima (figs. 16, 17, 18). A sheath of circular muscles, external 
to which are longitudinal fibres, encircles the stomodaeum. 

Dilator muscles originate on the walls and apodemes of the head, 
the central ends inserted in the stomodaeal epithelium. The 
cardiac or stomodaeal valve which,is composed of two cellular 
lamella covered on each side with stomodaeal intima, acts as a 
sphincter, preventing return movement of food. 

The mesenteron, which is the middle section of the 
alimentary canal, functions as a stomach (figs. 2, 19). It consists 
of a large simple tube extending from the base of the outer fold 
of the stomodaeal valve at the termination of the stomodaeal 
intima, to the ventricular valve. Two gastric caeca which arise 
at the anterior end of the mesenteron are simple ovate processes 
connected to the mesenteron in the area surrounding the stomodaeal 
valve (fig. 18), The epithelial cells are columnar in shape 
possessing large nuclei, and a striated border which differentiates 
the central ends. The peritrophie membrane is continuous with the 
epithelium, and is formed from the entire surface of the latter. 
Enclosing the mesenteron is a sheath of circular fibres, external

to which are longitudinal muscles. At the posterior end of the 
mesenteron, the epithelium of the ventriculus projects into the 
lumen of the proctodaeum forming the ventricular valve (fig. 21). 

The proctodaeum is differentiated into anterior intestine 
and rectum (fig. 22). The Malpighian tubules enter the 
proctodaeum immediately posterior to the ventricular valve (fig. 21). 
The walls of the proctodaeum consist of epithelium thrown into 
longitudinal folds covered internally with cuticular intima. In 
the rectum, six papilla-like organs project into the lumen. The 
proctodaeum is encased by a circular sheath of muscles overlaid 
with longitudinal fibres, and in the rectal area, dilator muscles 
originate in the body wall, their central ends entering the 
proctodaeal epithelium (fig. 23 ). 

The larva possesses ten Malpighian tubules which empty 
into the alimentary canal through a central opening in the ventral ' 
surface of the proctodaeum (fig. 21). All the tubules lie free 
in the body cavity; four extend to the anterior end of the 
mesenteron, four caudally to the area of the rectum, and two extend 
in an anterior direction, reverse, and terminate in the caudal 
area (figs. 14, 20). 

FAT BODY 

The fat body in the periviseral sinus is arranged in 
several long strands which extend almost the full length of the

body. These strands enlarge to fill the perivi^ral sinus of 
the mature larva. 

GONADS 

Partially-developed gonads have been observed in the 
dorsal area of the fifth abdominal segment in mature larvae. 

THE FYG-IDIUM 

Although not an organ of ingestion, the pygidium is 
used by the larva in obtaining food. It arises from the tenth 
or pygidial segment of the abdomen (fig. 1) and is a heavily 
sclerotized circular structure bearing teeth on its terminal 
surface (fig. 26). The pygidium acts as a brace to support the 
larva while it rips off tissues of the stem. This function will 
be discussed in a later section.

MORPHOLOGY OF THE fJHEAT STEM 

Since the larva obtains from the wheat stem all 
nutrients required for growth, development and reproduction, a 
knowledge of morphology of the culm is an integral part of 
the nutritional study of £. cinetus . 

Percival (78) describes the anatomy of the wheat stem 
as follows:- 


1. EPIDERMIS: made up of narrow elongated cells with 
short square cells at intervals. 

2. HYPODERM: consists of lignified fibres with 
narrow lumina and strong walls. 

3. ASSIMILATING PARENCHYMA: made up of delicate cells 
in the hypoderm and appear as parallel narrow green strips. 

4. COLOURLESS GROUND PARENCHYMA: extends from the 
hypoderm to the hollow pith cavity. The cells which are thin- 
walled and finely-pitted, become thickened and lignified at the 
lowest internodes. 

5- VASCULAR BUNDLES: are distributed symmetrically 
in the stem; very small ones located in the hypoderm, the large 
bundles in ground parenchyma. The large bundles are of the 
closed collateral type with xylem directed towards the centre 
of the stem, its chief vessels arranged to form a V. The pro- 
toxylem forming the apex of the V consists of one or two annular

or spiral vessels; two pitted vessels of metaxylem with wider 
lumina form the right and left arms of the V, and the space 
between the main vessels is occupied by sms.ll tracheids. The 
phloem made up of aeive-tubes and companion cells, lies between 
the arms of the V, Sheaths of fibrous sterome surround each 
bundle. Generally at the node, all the small bundles in the 
hypoderm come from the leaf sheath immediately above, half the 
large bundles come from the leaf sheath, the other half descend 
through the node from the internod© above. The total number of 
bundles is generally greatest in one of the two upper internodes, 
fevmst in the middle of the stem. 

The bundles of the leaf sheath curve inwards at the node 
and pass through the latter as separated strands that do not 
fuse with each other or with neighbouring bundles from the inter¬ 
ned© above. Around the bundle in its course through the node is 
a sheath of parenchyma containing many chloroplastids. 

The xylem elements are increased within the node, the vessels 
being replaced by many short, pitted, and reticulately thickened 
tracheids of small diameter distributed irregularly with xylem 
parenchyma. In the lower section the xylem elements more or less 
completely encircle the bast, but this arrangement is lost after 
the bundles leave the node, and the collateral form is soon resumed 
i7S). 

The anatomy of the stem of the wheat variety Thatcher 
is very similar to that described by Percival (78), although green

assimilating parenchyma of the hypoderm disappears where it is 
covered by the leaf sheath (figs, 27, 28, 29). The node is 
solidly filled with pith containing green chloroplastids. 

These bodies are also found in the outer parenchyma of the inter- 
nodes and in decreasing numbers in parenchyma cells towards the 
pith cavity. Starch granules were present in parenchyma between 
bundles at the node and part way up the internode (fig. 30 }. 


FEEDING AND DIGESTION 

The adult of £. clnctus emerges sexually mature, with a 
full complement of eggs. Thus the larval stage must obtain all 
nutrients required for growth, development, and reproduction. 
These nutrients are stored in the very large amounts of fat body 
possessed by mature larvae. The adult gut is reduced to a 
thread-like organ, Farstad ( 32 ) reports that adults have been 
observed feeding in flowers and are attracted by sugar solutions. 
However, in laboratory experiments, unfed females lay full 
complements of viable eggs, 

SELECTION OF OPPOSITION SITS 

The female deposits the small erescent-shaped eggs in 
the lumen of the stem. Farstad (32) states that most eggs are 
deposited in the third internode, and females will oviposit more

readily in stems that are actively elongating ( 31 )• 

Brome stems were split into east and west halves. 

Fifty stems were examined; 75 eggs were laid in the west section, 
6? in the east. One hundred stems were split into north and 
south halves; 94 eggs were found in the north, 165 in the south 
half. Greater oviposition in the south half of the stem is 
probably related with sunlight, and perhaps with deposition of 
food materials in the stem. 

FEEDING- METHOD! 

Experiments on artificial feeding of C. cinctus larvae 

were initiated in 1948. Hollow glass tubing with a bore of 

to 

Q=*$ mm. w&ee cut into 3-iach lengths. Sections of wheat stems, 

3 inches long, were placed in the tubes, one half stem in each. 
Larvae were inserted, the ends of the tubes were plugged with 
cotton wool, and the tubes placed in vertical positions. 

Attempts were made to use an agar mediate replace the 
stems, but these were unsuccessful. The best method developed 
was that in which the stem was replaced by fresh material every 
twenty-four hours. By this technique, two larvae were kept 

alive for 22 days, at the end of this period they became mature 
and ceased feeding. 

Although an artificial diet was not developed, it was 
demonstrated that larvae will survive under these conditions.

Larvae my now be observed while feeding, and many questions 
concerning behaviour answered. It is fait that if the stem were 
replaced by some material resembling it in texture and saturated 
with various nutrients, a truly artificial medistamight be developed. 
As expected, the S-shape has a functional purpose in feeding. 

The pygidium is braced against the wall of the stem, an opposing 
thrust is provided by the ventral surface of the abdomen against 
the opposite wall. The anterior part of the body is curved so 
the mandibles may be inserted in the plant. Plant tissues are 
removed in a tearing motion, 'the head is raised slightly, the 
tissues are ingested and the mandibles again plunged into the 
wall. 

Two larvae were placed in one tube, both with their heads 
directed upwards in the stem. The posterior larva, on coming in 
contact with the anterior, proceeded to feed on the caudal end of 
its victim. The anterior larva gave some indications of discomfort 
but made no effort to turn on its attacker. Cannibalism 
undoubtedly provides a supplementary source of food to the larva, 
but is not essential as Earstad ( 32 ) reports that a normal adult 
will develop where only one egg ms laid in a single stem. 

The larva is a voracious feeder for the tubes were often 
completely filled with frass within twenty-four hours, and in 
forty-eight hours little remained of the stem but hypoderm. In 
some tubes even the cotton plugs had been partially ingested and

TISSUES Off THE STSM INGESTED BY THE LARVA 

No attempt has been made to determine the nutrients 
utilized by the larva. As stated in the introduction, one of 
the purposes of this project was to determine the tissues ingested 
by £• ductus larvae. To carry out this aim, examinations were 
made of infested stems, contents of the larval gut, and tissues 
in the frass. 

Cross-sections of the stem reveal that the larva 
removes parenchyma and vascular tissues. Parenchyma cells form 
the largest part of the tissues removed. The larva seldom 
removes the hypoderm, although I&rstad ( 32 ) reports that during 
very dry weather the larva will chew through the hypoderm and 
into the leaf sheath. One stem showing this type of feeding is 
illustrated (fig. 32, A), and the normal type of feeding is shown 
in figures 31? and 32, B. Sterile white heads are produced as a 
result of this abnormal type of excessively deep feeding. On 
passing through the node, larvae tunnel through the bundles at the 
base, and as they ascend they remove only parenchyma (fig. 33)• 

As the larva becomes more mature, it removes parenchyma and 
vascular tissue to such an extent as to render the stem translucent 
The vascular bundles are severed at intervals throughout the 


internode

The gut of the feeding larva is visible through the body 
wall as a large green tube. In the mesenteron, parenchyma and 
vascular tissues are found in fragments as large as 0.6 mm. by 
0.3 mm. (fig. 34 ). Twisted and distorted cells, parts of cell 
walls and masc©rated green tissue constitute most of the contents. 
The hind-gut contains mainly the remnants of cells, mascerated 
tissue, and some green matter, although this occurs in smaller 
quantities than in the mid-gut. The larger fragments apparently 

pass unchanged through the gut. Parenchyma forms the largest 

part of the food in the intestinal tract. 

Tissues in the frass were found to be the same as those 
in the hind-gut being made up of fragments of cells and mascerated 
tissue. 

Prom these examinations it is concluded that the larva 
ingests parenchyma and. vascular tissue. Inrge fragments of 
plant tissue may pass unchanged through the gut. Apparently the 
nutrients are obtained from inclusions of cells ingested, among 
which are green chloroplastids which give the gut its characteristic 
green colour. Some digestion of the cell walls may take place, 
although this is not apparent from microscopic examination.

body removed as well as possible, and the tissue triturated in 
glycerol for proteolytic enzymes, in distilled water for lipeo- 
lytic and carbohydrate enzymes. In all tests, tissue suspensions 
were prepared within two hours after larvae were killed* The 
suspensions were immediately covered with a layer of toluol to 
prevent bacterial decomposition. The extract was divided into 
two parts, one part boiled to serve as a control, the unboiled as 
the test. Substrates were then added, the tubes corked, and 
placed in a.temperature cabinet for incubation. 

For pepsin a few drops of hydrochloric acid and a flake 
of carmine fibrin were added to the suspension. Release of the 
stain on incubation indicates digestion of the fibrin by pepsin. 

To test for trypsin five drops of 0.f> per cent sodium carbonate 
and a flake of congo red fibrin were added to the suspension. 

The action of trypsin is indicated by release of the stain. 

In the test for amylase, a 1 per cent starch solution 
ms added in quantities -equal to the suspension. After incubation, 
it was boiled with Benedict's reagent for reducing sugars, a 
positive test indicating that the starch had been hydrolysed by 
amylase. Benedict*a reagent was also used in testing for the 
action of sucrase and eellulase. The substrate of sucrose was 
made of 10 drops of a 2 per cent solution added tc the tissue 
suspension. For eellulase, quarter-inch squares of filter paper 
were shredded into fine fragments and added to the tissue suspension.

In testing for m&ltase and lactase, Barfoed's reagent for the 
presence of monosaccharides was used after the period of incubation. 
For maltase, a 1 per cent solution of maltose was added in 
quantities equal in volume to the suspension. A 1 per cent 
solution of lactose was added in volume equal to that of the sus¬ 
pension, as the test for lactase. 

To test for lipase, 10 drops of just alkaline milk 
containing phenopthalein was added to the suspension. The action 
of lipase on milk produces fatty acids, the presence of which are 
indicated by a disappearance of the pink colour. 

The enzymes in these experiments have been named according 
to the substrate on which they act, although these enzymes may be 
capable of hydrolysing other substances of related chemical 
structure. All larvae used in these tests were in the feeding 
stage. 

CARBOHYDRATE- ENZYMES 

Table I shows the results obtained when complete larvae 
were used to make up the tissue suspension. Amylase, suerase, 
and eellulase were established to be present in the larva. 

In Table II, results are recorded when complete alimentary 
tracts were used to make the tissue extract. Suerase was 

established to be present in the gut. Amylase was also found; 
although negative results were obtained in two tests, it is felt 
that these results ¥»rere influenced by experimental conditions,

probably time of incubation and temperature. The presence of 
cellulase in the gut was not definitely established as the majority 
of the tests gave negative results. However these results may 
again be produced by unfavourable experimental conditions. As 
three testa gave positive results * the presence of a cellulase in 
the gut is quite probable. The relation between cellulase and 
micro-organisms will be discussed later. 

In Table III, the presence of sucrase in the mesenteron 
wag established. The difficulty encountered in demonstrating the 
presence of amylase was probably a result of insufficient periods 
of incubation. 

Hind-guts were used for experiments reported in Table IV. 
Negative results were obtained for the enzymes tested. 

.Amylase and sucrase were found to be present, cellulase 
absent, in the labial glands (Table V). 

LIPHCIYTIC ENZYMES 

The presence of lipase is not established (Table VI). 

PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES 

As expected, negative results indicated the absence of 
pepsin. Difficulty was experienced in the detection of trypsin 
as the dye was released in both the control and test (Table VII).

CARBOHYDRATE' ENZYMES IN TEL'S JlIEAT SM 

Tests were carried out using sections of Thatcher wheat 
stems ground up in distilled water. Starch and sucrose were used 
as substrates, methods being the same as previously described. 

It was established that both amylase and sucrase were present 
(Table VIII). 

SUMMARY Off DIGESTIVE ENZYMES 

It is established that £. cinctus larvae during the 
feedirsg stage contain substances which are capable of hydrolysing 
starch, sucrose, and cellulose. Amylase and sucrase were found 
in the mid-gut and labial glands, but not in the hind-gut. These 
enzymes are also present in the wheat stem and may be ingested with 
the food. The presence of cellulase is indicated in the gut, but 
has not been definitely established. However, protozoa were 
found in the gut of some of the overwintering larvae. They 
occurred in a frequency which was great enough to indicate their 
presence was not purely adventitious. Some feeding larvae were 
examined, but protozoa were not observed. However, it is quite 
possible that these protozoa, which are highly mobile, may be 
associated with digestion of cellulose. If this is true, then 
these organisms could quite easily escape during dissection, result¬ 
ing in a negative test for the hydrolysis of cellulose. This would 
account for conflicting results obtained in Table II, and uniformly 
positive results in Table I.

SUMMARY AMD COLLUSIONS 

1. The morphology and histology of larval organs 
which carry out ingestion, digestion, and excretion, are described, 

2. A method is described whereby the feeding stages 
of £* cinctus larvae may be observed while feeding, moulting, 
and perhaps producing hibernaeula. 

3. It was determined that larvae of C. cinctus 
secure from parenchyma and vascular tissues of the wheat stem, 
all nutrients required for growth, development, and reproduction, 

4. Substances capable of hydrolysing starch and sucrose 
were established to be present in the mesenteron and labial glands 
of the feeding stage of C. cinctus larvae. Cellulose was found 

to be hydrolysed in the larva, probably in the alimentary canal, 
and the hydrolysis may b© associated with protozoa found in the 


larva.
