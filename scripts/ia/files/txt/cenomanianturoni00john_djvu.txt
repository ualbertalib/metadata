Thesis 


CM OMANI AN -TURONI AN FQRAMINIFERA FROM K ASKAPAU FORMATION , 

PEACE RIVER AREA, WESTERN CANADA 

Preface 

This research project serves to demonstrate the value of 
arenaceous foraminifera for detailed stratigraphic correlation work. 
The thesis has the following immediate objectives in view: «* 

(1) The formal description of all the commonly occurring 
species of foraminifera in the lower part of the Upper Cretaceous 
Kaskapau formation in the Peace River Area of Western Canada. 

(2) The microfaunal zoning of the Kaskapau formation and 
calibration of these zones with pelecypod and ammonite horizons 
recognised by Warren and Stelck, with an effort to make a more 
refined definition of the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary. 

(3) The correlation, wherever possible, of the Kaskapau 
faunas of the Peace River Area with equivalent faunas in other 
regions of North America. 

(4) The compilation of faunal sections at several localities 

/ 

within the Peace River Area, and the correlation of the various units 
in these sections over the report area. 

The area covered in this report (Figure l), located in the 
Peace River country of Western Canada, extends from the hamlet of 
Dunvegan, Alberta, on the Peace River at the eastern end of the area 
(Township 80, Range 4 West of the 6th Meridian) westward for approx- 
imately 80 mil.es to the village of Arras, British Columbia, on the

Kiskatinaw River (Township 78, Range 17 West of the 6th Meridian). 
Sporadic sample coverage exists on roughly a 20-mile north-south 
front between the eastern and western limits of the area. 

Most of the source material for the study was obtained from 
an Imperial Oil Limited core-hole section near the village of 
Spirit River, Alberta. Outcrop sections were sampled by Imperial 
Oil Limited field parties at the localities of Bunvegan, Doe Creek, 
Pouce Coupe River, Henderson Creek, Alberta and Kiskatinaw River, 
British Columbia, with various sampling methods being used at the 
different localities (see Appendix for detailed accounts). 

Some four hundred and twenty-eight (428) core hole and out¬ 
crop samples, from the central and lower parts of the Kaskapau 
formation, were disintegrated and examined for their microfaunal 
content from September 1945 to December 1950, by members of the 
Imperial Oil Limited Subsurface Division laboratory staff at 
Calgary, Alberta, and the author. Several disintegration methods 
were employed to break up the shale samples. Most commonly the 
material is soaked in a beaker of water for a day, the pieces of 
shale are boiled in a beaker and then the macerated sample is de¬ 
canted through a series of screens, ranging from 30 to 200 mesh. 

The writer personally, either extracted the microfossils, or check¬ 
ed the original picking job of the laboratory personnel in two 
hundred and six (206) samples, personally checking at least once 
in every ten feet of the section. The better specimens were chosen 
for holotypes and paratypes for the fifty-five (55) species of

foraminifera herein described, and these specimens were photo¬ 
graphed under different magnifications, ranging from forty (40) 
to ninety-five (95), using a Leitz Wetzlar M4B camera and a 
Leitz Wetzlar petrographic microscope* 

With the conclusion of the preparatory work outlined above, 
the writer began evaluating the individual specimens obtained from 
the samples at the various localities (8550 specimens), making 
around 6560 specific identifications. The microfaunal content 
of each individual sample is listed (see Appendix), along with its 
exact stratigraphic position and lithologic description* Fifty- 
five (55) species are formally described, the stratigraphic range 
and maximum development of each is determined as far as sample cov¬ 
erage permits, and comparisons with other species in the same area 
and outside areas are noted* Microfaunal sections have been drawn 
up for all of the principal localities, which illustrate the division 
of the Kaskapau formation into the various foraminiferal zones and 
the resulting value of these zones in making close correlation within 
the area. Megafaunal and pertinent lithological data are also in¬ 
cluded. Determination of interregional correlation is outlined.

who sampled shale banks; and laboratory assistants who handled the 
samples received at the Imperial Oil laboratory in Calgary between 
the fall of 1945 and the spring of 1949. 

The writer wishes to thank Imperial Oil Limited, who, through 
Dr. Ernest W. Shaw, formerly Divisional Geologist for Western 
Canada, gave permission to use material for academic research, and 
who in January 1950, transferred the writer from Calgary to Edmonton 
to permit university collaboration. 

The co-operation of Mr. Jim Smith, head of the Imperial Oil 
Limited Subsurface Division laboratory in Calgary, and his staff 
was excellent throughout the course of the study. Most of the 
Spirit River core samples were disintegrated by Fenton H. Montgomery 
and picked by Lloyd B. Pearson, of the laboratory staff. Re-examina¬ 
tion of many of the samples picked by Pearson showed the original 
picking job to be almost complete. 

Joseph Gleddie, William L. Clemis, and John Y. Smith, geologists 
with the Imperial Oil Surface Division, assisted the author by search¬ 
ing through old files and field note books, for necessary Information 
relating to the outcrop sections sampled by the field parties under 
their direction. 

Dr. Colin H. Criekmay, Staff Paleontologist, identified the 
macrofossils in the Spirit River sections; John B. Newland, Geologist 
with the Subsurface Division, logged the core from the Spirit River 
Structure Test #JL-337-l; George C. McClintock, along with the writer, 
logged the cores from the Imperial Spirit River #1 Well*

Frederick A. Killer assisted the writer by lending photographic 
developing equipment, and imparting many helpful suggestions concern¬ 
ing photographic procedure. Miss Eunice Shaben of the Imperial Oil 
Geological Department in Edmonton assisted in editing the manuscript 
and enclosed charts. 

Dr. P. S. Warren, Chairman of the Department of Geology, 
University of Alberta, identified the macrofossils collected by 
Imperial Oil surface geologists at the localities other than Spirit 
River. 

To Dr. Charles R. Stelck, Assistant Professor of Geology at 
the University of Alberta, the writer wishes to acknowledge his 
sincere appreciation. Although the project was carried out without 
direct supervision from any member of the faculty, Dr. Stelck acted 
as adviser and devoted much time to discussions involving correlations 
proposed by the writer and the formal descriptions of the foraminiferal 

species. In addition, Dr. Stelck criticized the manuscript and did 

/ 

the retouching on the fossil plates.

ABSTRACT 


Fifty-five species (or varieties) of Foraminifera 
from the Upper Cretaceous Kaskapau formation of the Peace 
River Area of Western Canada are described and figured, 
including fifteen genera (12 arenaceous, 3 calcareous) 
and forty-eight species (44 arenaceous, 4 calcareous). 

The species and varieties described includes 
5 species of Ammobacubites : 2 of Ammomargirmlina : 2 of 
Dorothia : 9 species and 1 variety of Flabellammina : 2 
species of Gaudryina : 1 species of Globigerina : 1 species 
of Gumbelina : 2 species and 1 variety of G umbelitria s 13 

species and 2 varieties of Haplophragmoides : 1 species of 

Proteoni na: 1 species of Spiroplectammina . 2 species of 
Textu l aria : 1 species and 1 variety of Tritaxle s 5 species 
and 1 variety of Trochammina : 1 species and 1 variety of 
Vernenilina . 

Five microfaunal zones are set up for the 18 central” 
and "lower”* parts of the Kaskapau formation, with the guide 
and index Foraminifera of each zone listed at the Alberta 
localities of Spirit River, Dunvegan, Ponce Coupe and the 
British Columbia locality of Kiskatinaw River* The Kaskapau 
is regionally correlated with formations of Colorado age .in 
Western Canada, the Northern Plains and Rocky Mountain 
Regions of the United States, and Texas. The name "Spirit 
River” is introduced for a sandstone bed of slightly young¬ 
er age than the Pbuce Coupe sandstone member at Spirit 
River. A more refined definition of the Cenomanian-Turonian 
boundary is offered, that is at a footage of 23 above the 
"'Spirit River” sand. There is a sharp transition in ecology 
reflected in the change from shallow water faunas of the 
Cenomanian to deeper water and pelagic faunas of the Turonian 
stage.

CEN OMANI AN -TURQNI AN FQRAMINIFERA FROM KASKAPAU FORMATION 
PEACE RIVER AREA, WESTERN CANADA 

Part I - THE KA S KAPAU FORMATION 
Terminology 

The formational name "Smoky River” was first used by 
G. M. Dawson in 1879, for the "upper dark shales” exposed on Smoky 
River. In 1918, F. H. McLearn subdivided this formation into three 
members, namely the "Lower shale”, "Bad Heart Sandstone”, and "Upper 
shale 01 . In 1926, McLearn assigned the name "Kaskapau" to the Lower 
shale member. Gleddie, in 1949, (p. 517) proposed that, where appli¬ 
cable, "the name Smoky River be raised to group rank to include in 
ascending order the Kaskapau, Cardium, and Wapiabi formations". 

The writer uses the additional terms, "lower part 11 and "central 
part” when referring to the two portions of the Kaskapau formation, 
featured in this study, and the term "upper part” for that portion 
not studied. 

The "lower part” includes the section between the top of the 
underlying Dunvegan formation and the base of the Pouce Coupe 
sandstone. 

The "central part" refers to the sediments from the top of the 
Pouce Coupe sandstone to the top of the Lower (Second) White Speckled 
Shale horizon (in the western part of the report area, the latter 
horizon is not known as a field marker). 

The "upper part” includes that portion of the section between

the lower White Speckled Shale horizon and the Bad Heart sandstone 


of the Spirit Eiver and Smoky River Areas, 


The "lower" and "central" parts of the Kaskapau formation may 


be divided into the following microfaunal zones: - 


Cenomanian 

Turonian 


"Central" 

Kaskapau 


Pelagic Microfaunal zone (Lower or Second 
White Speckled Sha3e ) 
Haplophragmoides ST- 664 -A zone (includes 
"white chalcedonic bed") 

Ammobaculites ST-747-A zone (includes 
•"Spirit River" Sand) 


"Lower" 

Kaskapau 


Gaudryina ST-876-A zone (includes Pouce 
Coupe Sand at top and 
Doe Creek Member near base) 
Ammobaculites ST-93Q-A zone 


Distribution, General Lithology, Thickness 

The shales of the Kaskapau formation underlie the entire report 
area and constitute the bedrock throughout most of it. 

Detailed lithologic sections are given in the appendix, but 
in summary, most of the formation consists of medium to dark grey, 
marine shales. The "lower part" of the formation, referred to by 
Gleddie and others as the "basal transitionary zone", including Doe 
Creek and Pouce Coupe sandstone members (Warren and Stelck, 1940) 
consists of brackish to marine shale, silty shale, sandstone, and a 
little ironstone. Considerable ledge-forming ironstone appears in 
the uppermost beds of the formation in the Pouce Coupe, Spirit River, 
and Smoky River Areas, 

Gleddie (1949, p. 521) gives an approximate thickness of 1550 
feet for the formation near Pouce Coupe and 900 feet in the vicinity 
of Spirit River, More recent subsurface work in the latter area

520 to 600 feet. 

Stratigraphic Paleontology of the Lower and 
Central Parts of the K askapau Formatio n 

Previous Tar orV; 

The only previous foraminiferal work in the Kaskapau is that 
of C. R. Stelck (1950), who in an unpublished work, describes forty- 
nine forms from surface sections at Kiskat Maw River, British Columbia 
and at Doe Creek and Dunvegan, Alberta. Some of these forms are rather 
rare and limited in value for correlation work. However, there are 
others, which the writer observed to be very useful stratigraphically, 
and these are Included in this study. 

Since this report deals with foraminifera, the writer does not 
outline the macropaleontological and geological work done on the 
Kaskapau formation. The megafauna has been surveyed by F. H. McLearn, 
P, S. Warren, and C, R. Stelck. The more recent published reports 
dealing with general geology are those of R. L. Rutherford (1930), 
and J. Gleddie (1949). 

Sririt Fryer Area 

The most important section studies is at Spirit River, as the 
entire interval from the Lower (Second) White Speckled Shale to the 
Dunvegan was cored at either the Spirit River Structure Test #A-337-l 
or the Imperial Spirit River #L Well* The writer used the cored 
section for setting up the various microfaunal zones discussed in the 
report. Figure 2 is a summary of the microfaunal, megafaunal, litho¬ 
logical, and electrolog data of the sediments from the lower part of

the Kaskapau at the two above locations, while Figure 3 summarizes 
the same data from the central part of the formation at the Structure 
Test hole. 

Lithology 

Between the depths* of 400 and 740 feet, the section of the 
Kaskapau formation consists of medium to dark grey shale, calcareous 
white speckled to 700 feet, with a few small silt and sand lenses. 
Between the depths of 740 and 1055 feet, the formation consists of 
medium grey, sandy to silty shale with pyrite tracings, along with 
several beds of buff and grey, fine-grained sandstone, glauconitic 
and shaly in part r Sandstone beds occur more commonly in the basal 
135 feet of the formation at this locality. 

The writer introduces the name "Spirit River" sand for the bed 
of buff-grey, fine to medium grained, partly glauconitic, shaly sand¬ 
stone (calcareous in uppermost foot), which occurs between the depths 
of 763 and 777 feet. It has been assumed, erroneously, that this sand 
might be the correlative of the Pouce Coupe member, because it is 
better developed and more striking in appearance, as reflected on 
the electrolog, than the sand equivalent of the Pouce Coupe member. 

The bed between the depths of 842 and 854 > consisting of buff- 
grey, fine-grained, glauconitic, shaly in part, sandstone is now con¬ 
sidered to be the equivalent of the Pouce Coupe sandstone member for 
reasons discussed later. 

* Depths used in manuscript, unless stated otherwise, refer to the 
Structure Test #&-337-l. The actual total depth of this hole was 
970 feet, but in order to be able to speak of one continuous section 
down to the top of the Dunvegan, a projected depth of 1055 was cal¬ 
culated for this marker. Exact correlation with the Imperial Spirit 
River #1 Well was made by the use of electrologs.

Macropaleontology 


Between footages of 5 and 10 above the contact with the under¬ 
lying Bunvegan, Dr, Crickmay and the writer noted the occurrences of 
Brachydontes sp., Corbula sp., and Ostrea sp. Specimens of Corbul a sp 
are numerous over the short interval from 5 to 8 feet, above the 
Dunvegan-Xaskapau contact. Between the extreme basal portion of 
the formation and the beds around the 700 foot level, there appears 
to be little in the wajr of diagnostic megafossils. 

The first indication of Lower Turonian age comes between the 
depths of 700 and 710 feet, where Watinoceras sp. was observed, while 
20 to 40 feet above this horizon, Dr. Crickmay recorded Inoceramus sp. 
Scaphites delicatulus Warren, and Watinoceras cf. reesidei Warren. 
Upwards from this horizon to the top of the Lower White Speckled Shale 
several specimens of Inoceramus sp. and Watinoceras sp. were noted. 

Micropaleontology 

The writer has subdivided the lower and central parts of the 
Kaskapau into five microfaunal zones, which in ascending order are 
Ammobaculites ST*-930-A . Gaudryina ST-876-A . Ammobaculites ST-747-A . 
H aplophragmoides ST-664-A . and the Pelagic Microfaunal Zone 
( Gumbelina . Globigerina ). The boundaries and foraminiferal content 
of each of the above five zones and of the subzones within these are 
listed? - 

THE MM0BACULITES ST-930-A ZONE comprises the basal 135 feet 
of the Kaskapau formation at Spirit River, with the lower 105 feet

sediments, in which Trochammina ST-956-0 is the most commonly occurring 
fossil, with the top of the subzone being placed at the footage above 
the Dunvegan, where the form noticeably weakens. This point is about 
10 feet below the footage where Ammobaculites ST-930-A and Flabellammina

THE HAPLOPHRAGMOIDES ST- 664 -A ZONE occupies a 150 foot section, 
extending from the top of the Ammobaculites ST-747-A zone (740 feet) 
to the base of the Pelagic Microfaunal zone (590 feet). There are 
two subzones, the Trochammina ST-65S-A and the Tritaxia ST-618-A 
included in the central and upper parts of this zone respectively. 

There are only two forms restricted* to this zone: - 

Tritaxia ST-618-A Trochammina ST- 658 -A 

Two other species, which occur commonly and characteristically 
in this zone, but which are not wholly confined to it, are: - 

Haplophragmoides ST- 664 -A Tritaxia ST- 664 -B 

(numerous) 

In addition, both Gumbelitria cretacea and Gumbelitria 
ST-596-A occur rather frequently in this zone, but range both 
above and below it. 

The Tro chammina ST-658-A subzone, occupying a 50 foot inter¬ 
val, from footages of 40 to 90 feet above the base of the greater 
zone, is characterized by the predominance of Trochammina ST-658-& . 
which very noticeably overshadows the combined representation of 
both Gumbelitria cretacea and Haplophragmoides ST-664-A . 

The Tritaxia ST-618-A subzone, occupying a 30 foot interval 
at the extreme top of the greater zone, is so named because 
Tritaxia ST-61S-A has not been recognized outside of these limits. 

* H aplophragmoides G46-1-10-A occurs commonly about 10 feet above 
the base of this .zone, but there also appears to be a few occur¬ 
rences in the underlying Ammobaculites ST-747-A zone.

THE PELAGIC MICROFAUNAL ZONE, so named, because of the 


abundance of the pelagic genera, Gumbelina and G1obiterina . 
occupies a 180 foot interval from the top of the Haolophragmoides 
ST-664-A zone (590 feet) to within 8 feet of the top of the Lower 
(Second) TWhite Speckled Shale horizon (410 feet). 

Globigerina cretacea d’Orbigny and Gumbelina globulosa 
(Ehrenberg) are restricted to this zone and occur abundantly. 

Gumbelitria cretacea Cushman and G umbelitria ST-596-A . the 
former occurring abundantly, are found in this zone but are by no 
means confined to it. 

The zone is strikingly devoid of any arenaceous forms, 
with a total of only eight specimens of H aniophragmoides being 


found over the interval

Dunvegan Area 

Figure 4 gives a summary of the known lithological, mega- 
faunal, and microfaunal information of the Dunvegan Area* It will 
be seen that the sample coverage is unfortunately incomplete. 

Lithology 

A sand bed at this locality, which is being correlated with 
the "Spirit River" member, consists of soft, fine-grained sand, 
intermixed with shale and sandy shale in the lower 4 feet, the 
overall thickness for the bed being 9 feet. 

The only detailed lithological descriptions available here 
are for the samples collected over intervals of 13 and 16 feet 
above and below the top and the base respectively of the "Spirit 
River " equivalent, such samples being reported as grey, silty to 
sandy shale, being especially sandy in the lower part. 

Macropaleontology 

Only two megafossils were identified at this locality, with 
Arctica sp. being identified in the "Spirit River 1 ® equivalent, and 
Dunveganoceras cf. albertense (Warren) being identified by Dri* 

P. S. Warren from a footage of about 155 above the Bunvegan-Kaskapau 
contact. 

Micropale onto1ogy 

The writer was able to recognize elements of three of the 
microfaunal zones established at Spirit River. In ascending order, 
they are the Ammobaculites ST-930-A . Gaudryina ST-876-A . and 
Ammobaculites ST-747-A zones, with the faunal content of each 


following: -

THE AMMOBACULITES ST-930-A ZONE occupies the basal 110 feet 
of the Kaskapau at the Dunvegan locality. Forms not found above it 
include: - 

Ammobaculites ST-9 30-1 Flabellammina SR-1013-A* 

Flabellamraina C47-9-95-A " G45-5-105-B* 

In addition, nearly all of the specimens of Trochammina ST-956-C 
were found below the top of the zone, 

THE GAUDRYINA ST-876-A ZONE is only partially known here. 

The upper limit of this zone is not known because of lack of sample 
coverage, but the following distinctive forms were recorded from the 
samples collected: - 

Gaudryina SR-1018-A Trochammina ST-910-1 

n ST-876-A Verneuilina SR-1009-A 

Haplophragmoides ST-902-A 

The writer includes the Trochammina ST-910-1 subzone here, 
because of the concentration of this form, 125 feet above the base 
of the Kaskapau. 

THE AMMOBACULITES ST-747-A ZONE cannot be outlined as yet 
because of inadequate sample coverage. In two samples, taken at 
footages of 2 and 7 above the top of a sand bed, which is tentative¬ 
ly correlated with the ^Spirit River” sand, the following distinctive 
forms were identified: - 

Ammobaculites ST-747-A Haplophragmoides ST-740-A 

" G45-19-0-A " ST-838-A* 

" G46-1-10-A* 

A only one specimen of each found.

Pouce Coupe River Area 

Doe Creek, Henderson Creek and Pouce Coupe River localities 
are all grouped together for discussion here. The individual 
localities are treated separately in the appendix. Two charts have 
been drafted to summarize the pertinent faunal and lithological data 
for this area (Figures 5 and 6) to cover the lower and central parts 
respectively of the Kaskapau. 

Lithology 

No detailed description is available for the beds from the 
upper part of the Kaskapau formation, but the lower part has been 
logged in detail (see Appendix) 

The Pouce Coupe sandstone member, at its type locality, con¬ 
sists of yellow, massive, fine-grained, clean, sandstone, approximate¬ 
ly 30 feet in thickness. The top of the sand is about 300 feet above 
the base of the Kaskapau. 

The Doe Creek sandstone member, at its type locality, consists 
of yellow, fine-grained sandstone, argillaceous toward the base, 
approximately 6 feet in thickness. The top of the sand is 75 feet 
below the base of the Pouce Coupe and about 225 feet above the base 
of the Kaskapau. 

The sections between the two sand members and between the Doe 
Creek and the Dunvegan, is made up chiefly of silty to sandy shale, 
with occasional bands of silt stone, sandstone, and ironstone. 

Macropaleontology 

Most of the macrofossils were collected in this area by 
J. Gleddie and all were identified by Dr. P. £. Warren.

The first indication of Lower Turonian assemblage occurs at 
a footage of about 25 above the “white chalcedonic bed” or 225 feet 
above the Pouce Coupe sand where the following suite was identified: - 
Pelecypoda 

Oxytoma sp. 

Inoceramus cf. labiatus Schlotheim 

Placenticeras pseudoplacanta Hyatt 
Gastropoda 

Turritella sp. 

Inoceramus labiatus was Identified from an horizon approximate¬ 
ly 100 feet higher than the above suite. 

Finally, Inoceramus sp. and Watinoeeras sp. were picked up 
about 20 feet above the top of the section sampled for microfossil 
work, that is, at an approximate footage of 170 above the “white 
chalcedonic bed” or 370 feet above the Pouce Coupe sandstone. 

Micropaleontology 

Elements of four microfaunal zones, established at Spirit 
River, were recognized in the Pouce Coupe Area. In ascending order,

content of each listed: - 


THE AMMOBACT)LITES ST-930-A ZONE occupies the basal 180 feet of 
the Kaskapau, with the lower 160 feet of it in turn being assigned 
to the Trochammina ST-956-C subzone. The top of the greater zone is 
not too well defined and possibly should be dropped 20 feet to coincide 
with the top of the subzone. The following foraminifera at Doe Creek 
are restricted to this zone: - 

Flabellammina G45-5“105-A Ammomarginulina ST-956-B 

" G45-5-1Q5-B Verneuilina G45-5-110-C

THE GAUDRYINA ST-876-A ZONE occupies a 120 foot interval from 
the top of the Ammobaculites ST-930-A zone to the top of the Pouce 
Coupe sand. Possibly its base should be dropped 20 feet to coincide 
with the top of the Trochammina ST-956-C subzone. A rather weak 
microfauna was recovered from the Gaudryina ST-876-A zone at Doe 
Creek, and it appears that there were a few more forms carried over 
from the underlying Ammobaculites ST-93Q-A zone than at Spirit River. 
One of the most common forms in the Gaudryina ST-876-A zone at Spirit 
River, Trochammina ST-910-A has not been identified in the Pouce 
Coupe Area. 

Haolophragmoides ST-902-A seems to be the only species restrict¬ 
ed to the zone, but it is Important to note that very few of the forms 
occurring either in this zone or in the underlying Ammobaculites 
ST-930-A zone are to be found above the Pouce Coupe sand. Among the 
prominent forms which do not appear above the top of the Gaudryina 
ST-876-A zone are: - 

Ammobaculites ST-930-A Trochammina ST-956-G 

Gaudryina SR-1018-A !S S47-4-1S6-A& 

« ST-876-A Vemeuilina SR-1009-A 

THE AMMOBACULITES ST-747-A ZONE has its base coinciding with 
the top of the Pouce Coupe sand, but the placing of its exact top is 
rather doubtful. The writer is of the opinion that its upward limit 
can probably be placed at a footage of 150 above the top of the Pouce 

& There is one isolated occurrence of this form at, Pouce Coupe River, 
Locality G45-18, 15 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand.

ically. 

It is impossible to give an accurate list of the forms within this 
zone, as a break of 75 feet occurs in the sample coverage over the inter¬ 
val 60 to 135 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand. However, it is known that 
the following three species do not occur above the footage being taken 
as the top of the zone: -

Haplophragmoides G46-1-10-A Flabellammina G45-3-145-A^

THE HAPL0PHRAG10IBI3S ST-664-A ZONE name is arbitrarily used here, 
although Haplophragmoides ST-664-A itself has not been recognized in 
the Henderson Creek section, because, among other evidence, Trochammina 
ST-658-A was found in the uppermost 15 feet of the sampled section.

Kiskatinaw River Area 

The lithological and microfaunal information gathered at the 
Kiskatinaw River locality is given on Figure 7. This section, the 
most westerly one studied, failed to yield many microfossils, and 
thus, it is difficult to correlate the microfauna here with the 
Pouce Coupe suites. 

Lithology 

The so-called "white chalcedonic bed tt , occurring 145 feet 
above the Pouce Coupe sand, consists of tuffaceous sandstone with 
white chalcedonic nodules. 

The 50 feet of section sampled above this marker is made up 
chiefly of grey, silty shale, while the interval between it and 
the Pouce Coupe sand consists also of grey silty shale, but, with 
considerable interbedded sandstone and some ironstone bands. 

The Pouce Coupe member, exposed at water level here is a fine¬ 
grained, clean, ripple-marked, sandstone, 

Macropaleontology 

Watinoceras sp. and Jnoceramns labiatus var. latus Sov/erby, 
Lower Turonian forms were picked up at about the same level as the 
*white chalcedonic bed*. Exact footage8 are not available. 

Micropaleontology 

Ik rather sparse microfauna was recovered here, and it is not 
possible to zone the section microfaunally. However, elements of 
both the Ammobaculites ST“747-A and Haplonhragmoides ST-664-A zones 
at Pouce Goupe are present here, but a dividing line cannot be drawn

Part II- C ORBELATIOF OF THE CEN T RAL AM D 

LOWER PARTS OF THE KASKAPAH FORMATION 


Cenomanian-Turonian Boundary 

Warren and Stelck (1940, p, 144), place the Cenomanian- 
Turonian boundary at, or a few feet above the top of the Pouce 
Coupe sand, which contains the Dunveganbceras (late Cenomanian) 
fauna. The writer found no foraminifera, other than those of the 
pelagic microfaunal zone, which could be identified with forms 
from outside of the area, and thus is dependent upon the occur¬ 
rences of the various dated ammonite and pelecypods for age 
determination of microfaunal units. Accordingly, all of the 
foraminifera restricted to the lower part of the Kaskapau, that 
is, between the Pouce Coupe sand and the Dunvegan formation, are 
by direct calibration, Upper Cenomanian in age. The microfauna 
of the pelagic zone is known to he Lower Turonian in age. 

The author suggests that the more refined boundary between the 
Cenomanian and Turonian should be drawn at the top of the Ammobaculites 
ST-747-A zone, that is, about 100 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand at 
Spirit River and 150 feet above it at Pouce Coupe. Although there is 
a pronounced change in microfaunal content in beds above and below 
the Pouce Coupe sand, that is, at the base of the ’A mmobaculites 
ST-747-A zone, it is not as significant as the break occurring at the 
top of the zone, because at the latter point, environmental changes 
are indicated - - - - 

It would appear that the sediments from the top of the Dunvegan 















- 22 


to the top of the A mmobaculites ST-747 -.A zone, that is, 23 feet 
above the "Spirit River* 1 sand, were deposited in a near-shore 
environment, whereas those of the overlying: Haplophragmoides 
ST-66A-A zone were deposited in deeper water, still relatively 
shallow, and within the neritic zone. The writer does not wish 
to convey the impression that environmental change should in 
itself, have any bearing on the placing of a time boundary, but 
in this case, the first Lower Turonian megafossils ( Inoceramus 
labiatus var. latus fauna) appear 50 feet above this horizon of 
change at Spirit River, about 75 feet above at Pouce Coupe, and 
reflects the completed ecological shift to deeper water. The top 
of the Ammobaculites ST-747-1 zone is the dividing line between 
the shallow water Cenomanian and deep water Turonian stages. 

Local Correlation 

Of the four sections discussed, the two at Spirit River and 
Pouce Coupe are, by far, the most important, since much more data 
is available concerning them. Consequently, the correlation be¬ 
tween these localities is discussed first, after which the sections 
at Bunvegan and Kiskatinaw River are correlated with those at 
Spirit River and Pouce Coupe, respectively. Figure 8 shows the 
correlation across the area. 

Correlation of Pouce Coupe and Spirit River Area Sections 

The contribution made by each microfaunai zone to the general 
correlation is given, followed by a summary of the reasons for the 
correlation of the Pouce Coupe member: -

THE AM MOB ACULITES ST-930-A ZONE has the following forms 
either restricted to it or their acmes within it and not common¬ 
ly found above it: -

Haplophragmoides G45-5-85-A ----- Haplophragmoides G45-5-85-A 
Verneuilina G45-5-110-C " ST-958-A 

It will be seen that 8 of the above 13 species are common to 
bcth areas. In addition, both Ammobaculites G45-5-110-A and Flabell ¬ 
ammina G45-5-115-A . from the Pouce Coupe Area, are probably present 
at Spirit River, but outside of one or two isolated occurrences, they 
cannot be positively identified, Flabellammina G45-5-1Q5-A and 
F, G45-5-I05 -B are not found at Spirit River either in this zone or 
in any overlying zone. Finally, Verneuilina G45-5-110-C and Haplo ¬ 
phragmoides ST-9 58-A occur in both areas in the zone, but with the 
former ranging somewhat higher stratigraphically at Spirit River, 
Conclusion : - On the evidence presented above, the writer 


concludes that the lower 180 feet or possibly the lower 160 feet 
at Pouce Coupe can be correlated with the lower 135 feet of the 
Kaskapau at Spirit River.

THE GAUDRYINA ST-876-A ZONE has the following forms either 
confined to it or their acmes within it and not commonly found 
outside: - 

Po uce Coupe Spirit River 

Haplophragmoides ST-902-A ------ Haplophragmoides ST-902-A 

Trochammina ST-910-A 

In addition, the following group of prominent species, al¬ 
though occurring more or less commonly in the underlying Ammobacu - 
lites ST-930-A zone in both areas, is not found above the top of the 
Gaudryina ST-876-A zone or the Pouce Coupe sand: - 

Ammobaculit.es ST -9 30-A Trochammina ST-956-0 

Gaudryina SR-1018-A Verneuilina SR-1009-A 

" ST-876-A 

Conc lu sion : - From the above, it is concluded that the 90 feet 
of section from the top of the Ammobaculites S T-93Q-A zone to the 
base of the Pouce Coupe sand in the Pouce Coupe Area, correlates 
with the corresponding 66 foot interval at Spirit River and that the 
bed of sand immediately overlying the top of the zone at the latter 
locality, 201 to 213 feet above the base of the Kaskapau (842 - 854 
feet in section), is the correlative of the Pouce Coupe member at its 
type locality. 

THE AMMOBACULITES ST-747-A ZONE has the following forms either 
restricted to it or their acmes within it and not commonly found-

Spiroplectammina ST-8;3-B ------ Spiroplectaimnina ST-838-B 

Dorothia ST-830-A 
11 ST-834-A 

Gumbelitria ST-782-A 
Textularia ST-747-A 
Trochammina ST-812-A 

It will be seen that nearly half of the above species are 
common to both areas, and it is desirous to point out that these 
five forms occur more abundantly than the group not in common. 

In this latter connection, it should be mentioned that Textularia 
ST-747-A is a very small, pyritized, rare form, not found outside 
of Spirit River, and that Gumbelitria ST-782-A , a rather rare form 
also, would probably not be recovered in normal sampling of surface 
outcrops. 

It has been stated previously that the placing of the top 
of this zone is doubtful in the Pouce Coupe Area, because three 
specimens of Ammobaculites ST-747-A were found in a sample, 100 feet 
higher stratigraphically than the horizon, which is presently consid¬ 
ered the top (150 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand), Hov?ever, these 
occurrences are entirely isolated from the main group of specimens, 
with none being found in the Intervening 100 feet. Furthermore, only 
one specimen of Flabellammina G45-3-50-1 was found at Spirit River, 
and this at 10 feet above the top of the Ammobaculites SF-747-A zone 
(see Appendix). At Henderson Creek, this species does not appear to 
occur any lower than 10 feet above the same horizon. Thus, these 
occurrences of Flabellammina G45-3-50-A tend to indicate that the

level taken for the top of the Ammobaculites ST-7A7-A zone at Pouce 
Coupe is equivalent to the one at Spirit River. 

Conclusion ; - From the above evidence, the correlation of the 
150 feet of sediments Immediately above the Pouce Coupe sand in the 
Pouce Coupe Area with the 102 feet of beds above the Pouce Coupe 
equivalent at Spirit River is indicated. The occurrence of identical 
forms in both the Pouce Coupe and Spirit River Areas in beds above 
the Pouce Coupe sand serves to establish correlation of this member. 

THE HAPLOPHRAGMOIDES ST- 664 -A ZONE seems to have its associa¬ 
ted sediments thinning out more rapidly in the direction of Spirit 
River, than do the underlying beds, where they are represented by 
relatively small fractions of their thicknesses in the former area. 
The arguments for this are: - 

(1) In the Pouce Coupe Area, the first specimens of 
Trochammina ST-658-A are not encountered until one moves upward in 
the section for 335 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand, whereas in the 
Spirit River Area, the base of the Trochammina ST-658-A subzone 
occurs at a footage of 138 above the Pouce Coupe equivalent. 

(2) In the Pouce Coupe Area, Haplophragmoides G46-1-10- A 
occurs more or less commonly in the beds from the Pouce Coupe sand 
to the top of the section, whereas at Spirit River, this form does 
not appear at levels higher than about 115 feet above the Pouce 
Coupe equivalent. 

(3) In the Pouce Coupe Area, Plabellammina G45-3-5Q-A occurs

more or less commonly in the beds from 160 feet above the Pouce Coupe 
sand to the top of the section, but at Spirit River, the only specimen 
found was at a footage of about 110 above the Pouce Coupe equivalent* 

(4) In the Pouce Coupe Area, Flabellammina GA5-3-1A5-A is one 
of the most common forms, occurring above the top of the Ammobaculites 
ST-7A7-A zone, but at Spirit River this species is missing completely. 

(5) Haplophragmoides ST-664-A itself has not been recognized in 
the Pouce Coupe Area, although it occurs abundantly at Spirit River. 

If it is to be found in the former area, one would expect it above the 
top of the sampled section. 

THE PELAGIC MIGR0FAUHA1 ZONE has not been observed in the 
Pouce Coupe Area, nor has its accompanying lithologic marker, the 
Lower (Second) White Speckled Shale. The upper central and upper 
parts of the Kaskapau are unfortunately almost entirely concealed 
in the area, and until such time as a core hole is drilled in an 
appropriate location, our knowledge regarding these horizons in 
the western part of the report area is restricted. 

The Pouce Coupe Sand 

The arguments for correlation of the Pouce Coupe member from 
Pouce Coupe to Spirit River are as follows: 

(l) There is a very noticeable difference of microfaunal con¬ 
tent of the beds above and below the sand in both areas, shown in 
discussion of the foraminifera in the principal zones.

(2) The acmes of two foraminiferal species, Soiroolectammina 
ST-S3S-B and Haploohraffmoides ST-902-A occur respectively directly 
above, and about 20 feet below, the Pouce Coupe Sand in both areas. 

(3) The correlation of the other prospective sand in the Spirit 
River Area, that is, the so-called "Spirit River 1 * sand, with the 
Pouce Coupe member at its type locality seems extremely unlikely 
because, (a) there is no break in the microfaunal sequence across 
the former, and (b) one would have to account for a slight thicken¬ 
ing, or at best, no change in thickness of the “lower 1 * part of the 
Kaskapau across the area, although there is a definite trend of thin¬ 
ning from west to east in all of the other lithological units. 

Correlation of Spirit River and Dunvegan Area Sections 

THE AMMOBACUIITES ST-930-A ZONE is not completely known at 
Dunvegan because of inadequate sample coverage. Thus, there is 
little point in listing the forms restricted to this zone at both 
localities, since the greater number found at Spirit River would 
tend to distort the correlation picture. However, the following 
four species, common to both areas, are either restricted to this 
zone or attain their maximum development in it and are rarely found 
above: - 

Ammobaculites ST-930-A Flabellammina C47-9-95-A 

Trochammina ST-956-C * SR-1013-A&

In addition, one or two specimens of Flabellammina G45- 5- 105-B 
were found in the zone at Dunvegan. This form, although not recovered 
at Spirit River, is confined to this zone in the Pouce Coupe Area. 

Conclusion ; - The lower 110 feet of the Kaskapau at Dunvegan 
can probably be correlated with the lower 135 feet at Spirit River. 

THE GAQDRHNA ST-876-A ZONE is only partially known at Dunvegan 

because of lack of sample coverage, but the following characteristic 

forms were recorded at both Dunvegan and Spirit Rivers - 

Gaudryina SR-1018-A Trochammina 3T-910-A 

" ST-876-A Verneuilina SR-1009-A 

Haplophragmoides ST-902-A 

THE MMOBACULITES ST-747-A ZONE is also only partially known at 
Dunvegan. There is a possibility that its base might be taken to 
correspond to the top of the sandstone bed, 189 feet above the base 
of the Kaskapau, but its placement here appears unlikely for a variety 
of reasons, mentioned below. In any case, the following three typical 
species found at Dunvegan are present also at Spirit River and Pouce 
Coupe: - 

Ammobaculites ST-747-A Haplophragmoides ST-740-A 

* G45-19-0-A 

The ^Spirit River 0 * sand at the Dunvegan Locality 
The sandstone bed, 180 to 189 feet above the base of the Kaskapau 
at Dunvegan is correlated with difficulty, because of the gaps in the 
sample coverage curbing the value of the microfaunal evidence.

However, it can be correlated with the ’’Spirit River” sand rather than 
the Pouce Coupe sand at Spirit River because of the following reasons:- 

(1) If the sand were the Pouce Coupe member at Dunvegan, a 
thickness of at least 79 feet would have to be postulated for the 
Gaudryina ST-876-A microfaunal zone, which although not unreasonable, 
appears unlikely because it is only 78 feet thick at Spirit River* 
Regionally, this zone would be expected to thin considerably in a 
north-east direction* 

(2) A concentration of specimens of Haplophragmoides ST-9Q2-A . 

20 feet below the top of the sampled section at Dunvegan, indicates 
that the possible top of the Gaudryina ST-876-A zone and, thus, the 
position of the Pouce Coupe equivalent, might be expected to occur 

at about the top of the sampled section. The possibility exists that 
the Pouce Coupe may have pinched out altogether at Dunvegan* 

(3) The lack of any specimens of Spiroplectammina ST-S38-B 
above the sandstone bed at Dunvegan indicates correlation with the 
”Spirit River® sand, because this form occurs characteristically dir¬ 
ectly above the Pouce Coupe sand at Spirit River and Pouce Coupe* 

(4) The sparse microfauna recovered from the 16 feet sampled 
directly below the sandstone bed, although it does not contain any 
recognizable specimens of Ammobaculites ST-747-A or Ammobaeulites 
G45-19-0-A (species occurring characteristically in the interval 
between the Pouce Coupe and n Spirit River® sands at Spirit River) 
also cannot be used to support a Pouce Coupe member correlation for 
the above sandstone. This microfauna, with Its’undiagnostic

Haplophragmoides and lack of recognizable species of Ammobaculites . does 
not appear unlike the fauna recovered from the beds directly below the 
"Spirit River" sand at Spirit River, which is rather barren, and along 
with similar forms of Haplophragmoides « contains only a very few speci¬ 
mens of A mmobaculites ST-747-A and Ammobaculites GA5-19-Q-A . 

Correlation of Pouce Coupe - Kiskatinaw River Area Sections 

Because of poor microfossil recovery at the Kiskatinaw River 
locality, the writer was unable to establish a definite microfaunal 
zoning, and thus, could not make any detailed correlation across to 

the Pouce Coupe locality. However, the presence of the "white chalce- 

5 

donic bed" and the Pouce Coupe sand at this locality, assure its general 
correlation with the Pouce Coupe section. It appears that the interval 
from the ®white chalcedonic bed" to the Pouce Coupe sand is about 50 
feet thinner here than at Pouce Coupe.

Regional Correlation 


In this report, the writer is primarily concerned with the 
correlation role of the microfaunal suites, but during the following 
discussion, mention is also made of the various megafaunal zones used 
by others in working out the regional correlation. 

With very few exceptions, the foraminifera of the pelagic micro¬ 
faunal zone, are the only forms which can be used in making correlation 
from the Peace River to the southern areas. The Cenomanian foraminifera 
of the lower part of the Kaskapau constitute a definitely localized 
fauna, of practically no value in determining correlation with outside 
areas. 

Central and Southern Alberta Foothills 
The central and lower parts of the Kaskapau formation in the 
Peace River Area appear correlative with most of the Blackstone forma¬ 
tion of the Foothills. No microfaunal work has been done on the Black- 
stone beds, but megafossil evidence outlined by Webb and Hertlein (1934 ) 3 
shows lower Turonian species Inoceramus labiatus Schlotheim and 
Collignoniceras woolgari (Mantell), the former occurring abundantly 
in the central and lower Blackstone beds, while one specimen of the 
late Cenomanian Dunveganoceras albertense (Warren) was found in the 
lower or ’'Barren Zone 11 of the Blackstone. 

Central Alberta Plains (Edmonton Area) 

The Lower Turonian pelagic microfauna exists in both the Edmonton 
and Peace River Areas, having been found in beds from the Second White 
Speckled Shale zone of the Colorado Group in the Anglo-Canadian, Horae,

C. & E. Ttfabamun Lake #1 Well*, (about 45 miles west of Edmonton, 
.Alberta) and the Lower Speckled Shale zone of the Kaskapau in the 
Peace P.iver Area. Most workers had previously equated the lower 
Speckled Shale zone in the northern area with the Second White 
Speckled Shale zone of the southern area, so the presence of an 
identical microfauna merely confirms this hypothesis. 

At Spirit River, the pelagic microfauna is found directly 
at the top of the speckled shale and covers 180 feet of section. 

At the Wabamun Lake well, where the fauna is observed 100 feet 
below the second speckled shale, its exact range is not known 
since no core samples were taken for the first 50 feet of the zone. 
The microfauna, in both areas, consists of the following three 
species: - 

Globigerina cretacea d 1 Orbigny 
Gumbelina globulesa (Ehrenberg) 

Gumbelitria cretacea Cushman 

East Central Alberta Plains (Vermilion Area) 

Nauss (1945, p. 1617) has reported the characteristic occur*” 
rences of Globigerina cretacea and Gumbelina globulesa in the central 
part of the lloydminster shale of the Saskatchewan-Alberta border 
area. This horizon would correspond to the second or lower white 
speckled shale zone of the Colorado and Kaskapau formations of the 
Edmonton and Peace River Areas, respectively. As supporting evidence, 
Nauss (ibid.) reported the presence of Inoceramus labiatus . 112 miles 

A Lsd.5 - Sec.5 - Tp.51 ” Rge.4 - W 5th Meridian.

north-east of Lloydminster, at the south end of Green lake, Saskatch¬ 
ewan, in association with abundant Globigerina * 

Southern Alberta and Southern Saskatchewan 

The pelagic microfauna has not been recorded in any published 
reports from wells in the southern Alberta and Saskatchewan region, 
but its presence may be assumed since the Second White Specks zone 
has been recognized in the Alberta Shale of the general area* Webfo. 
(1934, p. 1410), in a well near Taber, Alberta, observed elements of 
the Inoceramus labiatus zone with I noceramus cf. labiatus and 
Collignoniceras cf. woolgari identified from beds just above the 
top of the Blackleaf Sandy member of the Colorado, which would fall 
within the Second White Speckled Shale 33 ne. 

Southern Manitoba 

From the Favel formation of Manitoba, Wickenden (1945, p® 33) 
reports the occurrence of Gumbelina globulosa . Gumbelitria eretacea . 
and Globigerina cretacea . In addition, Inoceramus labiatus was re¬ 
corded from the Keld or lower member of this formation* The Favel, 

170 feet maximum thickness, is thus considered the correlative of 
the Lower or Second White Speckled Shale horizon of the Kaskapau. 

Wickenden states (ibid), "on the basis of fossils, the Favel 
can be correlated with the Greenhorn limestone and Carlyle shale in 
the United States and part of the Lower Alberta formation in the 
southern Foothills, the Blackstone formation in the northern Foothills 
of Alberta, and the Kaskapau of the northern Alberta Plains®. Undoubt¬ 
edly, when referring to "fossils”, Wickenden had in mind the occurrence

of the widespread index Inoceramus labiatus . and not any microfossils, 
when making the Favel-Blackstone-Kaskapau correlation. The tracing of 
the pelagic microfauna from Manitoba to Peace River shows that 
Wickenden’s interpretation is entirely correct. 

Southern Montana 

Young (1951) has recently reported the occurrence of Globigerina 
cretacea and Gumbelina globulosa from the "Vascoceras beds” of the 
Frontier formation of southern Montana. Is these "Vascoceras beds 1 * are 
described as blue calcareous shale, carrying Inoceramus labiatus . it 
appears that they represent the approximate equivalent of the Second 
or lower White Speckled Shale horizon of the Kaskapau in the Peace 
River Area. 

Rocky Mountain Region of the United States 

The Lower or Second White Speckled Shale zone of the Kaskapau 
seems to occupy a stratigraphic position equivalent to the Greenhorn 
limestone of Nebraska, South Dakota, and northern Colorado, with 
Inoceramus labiatus occurring throughout the region in this horizon. 

In southern Colorado, Wyoming, sold New Mexico, the Inoceramus labiatus 
fauna occurs in the lower part of the Mancos shale, which would indicate 
correlation of that part of the Mancos with the Lower Speckled Shale 
horizon of the Kaskapau. 

Texas 

Nauss (1945, p. 1617) states that the zone of pelagic foramin- 

ifera, characteristic of the central part of the Lloydminster shale of 

the Vermilion Area, "is widespread and can be followed through the Mid- 
Continent region of the United States into Texas, where it is represented

by the Eagle Ford formation”. The occurrence of the pelagic micro¬ 
fauna in the Kaskapau merely serves to extend this correlation into 
the Peace River Area. 

In Volume 1, Part 2 of “The Geology of Texas” (1933, p. 438), 

the following forms were included in a list of the Eagle Ford 

foraminifera prepared by Helen Jeanne Plummer: - 

Globigerina cretacea d ! 0rbigny 
Gumbelina globulosa (Ehrenberg) 

Haplophragmoides aff. calcula Cushman and Waters 
Trochammina diagonis (Carsey) 

Ventilabre11a eggeri Cushman 

Although none of the above five species were considered 
especially characteristic of the Eagle Ford, Globigerina cretacea 
and Gumbelina globulosa occur in the Kaskapau, while Haplophragmoides 
ST-740-A and Trochammina ST-658-A of the late Cenomanian and early 
Turonian of the Kaskapau are closely related to Haplophragmoides 
calcula and Trochammina diagonis . Ventilabrella eggeri . although 
not found in the Kaskapau, has been reported by Wickenden from the 


correlative Favel of Manitoba

Part III - THE FOR A M INIFERAL FATIMAS OF THE 

CENTRAL AND LOWER PARTS OF THE 

KASKAPAU FORMATION 

Nomenclature 

Fifty-five M species* 1 of foraminifera are described in the 
following section, with th e ^ r ranges and comparisons added. Of the 
fifty-five "species 11 , three (the pelagic species) have been described 
in literature, while Stelck (1950) has described thirteen in an 
unpublished work. The remaining thirty-nine forms have not, to the 
writer’s knowledge, been described in any published or unpublished 
works. 

Some of the forms described are probably of no higher standing 
than varietal rank, and it would not be technically correct to speak 
of TB fifty-five species". However, there do not appear to be more than 
seven of these varietal forms, and the remainder of the forms seem en¬ 
titled to specific rank. An attempt was made to speciate the faunas by 
following the forms through the sequence of beds to detect any possible 
evolutionary changes. 

An effort was made to describe all of the commonly occurring 
forms and rarer forms also, if they turned out to be of any value 
stratigraphically. Although many of the same localities were examined 
by both Stelck and the writer, the latter saw little benefit to be 
derived from describing species, other than those that contributed 
directly to correlation within the area or are related to outside 
species. Stelck’s thesis endeavored to establish a complete

microfaunal sequence through the .Albian and Cenomanian beds, dating 
the faunas from their association with ammonite and pelecypod zones 
of known exact geologic age* In the course of Stelck’s research, 
nearly all of the forms recovered in the outcrop samples were des¬ 
cribed, including some very rare forms, in the hop© that if any 
similarities whatever to outside species existed, such similarities 

Jr 

could thus be recognized and evaluated. The writer, on the other 
hand, has been primarily interested in effecting close correlation 
within a relatively small area, and most of the species described 
were chosen because of suitability for this purpose. 

Because of normal delay in publication, each species is desig¬ 
nated by a combination of symbols and numerals, rather than by an 
official zoological name. In nearly every case, the specific desig¬ 
nation is a key to the locality and level of the holotype. For example, 
the holotype of Ammobaculites ST-93Q--A comes from the Spirit Eiver 
Structure Test hole at a depth of 930 feet, while the holotype of 
Verneuilina 045-5-110-0 was chosen from Locality G45~5 at a footage 
of 110 below the base of the Pouce Coupe sand. A final letter is 
always given to the name in case there are, or might be at some later 
date, other holotypes, either for other species of the same genus or 
different genera, picked from the same bed. The descriptions are arr¬ 
anged in alphabetical sequence, with the older species of each genus 
described first. 

The table in pocket illustrates the relative abundance of the 
families, sub-families, and genera, using the Galloway (1933)

classification, in the three broad faunal units, as outlined below. 
The percentage figures on the chart were determined by a complete 
count of individual specimens (6,840) in the Spirit River section 
and reveal in part the ecological groups. 

Ecology 

There appear to be three separate faunas represented in the 
interval from the base of the Kaskapau to the Lower Tftiite Speckled 
Shale horizon at Spirit River, which are: - 

(1) The microfauna of Upper Cenomanian age extending from the 
base of the Kaskapau to the base of the Haplophragmoides ST-66A-A 
zone, that is 23 feet above the "Spirit River" sand. This fauna 
includes all species of the A mmobaculites ST-930-A . Gaudrvina 
ST-S76-JL and Ammobaculites ST"747-A zones. 

(2) The microfauna of Lower Turonian age, found in the Haplo ¬ 
phragmoides ST-66A-A zone. 

(3) The microfauna of Lower Turonian age, contained within the 
Pelagic Microfaunal zone. 

.Upper Cenomanian Microfauna 

Of the three faunas, the Upper Cenomanian one has the largest 
number of genera, but it will be seen that- almost all of the forms 
(94%) are included in two families, the Trochamminidae and Ataxo- 
phragmiidae . with the former in turn comprising a great bulk (85%) 
of the total. The three most commonly occurring genera with percent¬ 
ages of total in parentheses are Haplophragmoides (40%), Trochammina 
(20%), and Ammobaculites (18%).

This fauna is a local or provincial one. Practically none of 
the forms have been recognized from outside areas, with the exception 
of Haplophragmoides ST-740-A . which is similar to Haplophragmoides 
calcula from the Upper Cretaceous of Texas. The dwarfed nature of 
some of the species of this fauna would lead one to believe that it 
is provincial. The following species are definitely tiny forms: - 

Haplophragmoides SR-1018-B Textularia ST-747-1 

" SR-1011-B Trochammina S47-4-1S6-A 

n ST-958-A Verneuilina G45-5-110-C 

In addition, most of the remainder of the species are consider¬ 
ably smaller than the Upper Cretaceous forms of the Gulf Coast region. 
Many of the species described in the following section are rather 
grotesque forms, which resemble nothing in the literature. 

The environment of the above fauna is regarded as being very 
near shore, probably cold brackish water for the following reasons: - 

(1) The abundance of coarsely arenaceous forms, such as Haplo ¬ 
phr agmoides ST-74Q-A , Armnob aculit e s ST -747-A and Ammobaculites 
GA5-19-Q-A , is generally indicative of very shallow water. 

(2) The occurrence of oysters in the accompanying megafauna 
points to a shore line phase. 

(3) The sediments from the top of the Bunvegan to the top of 
the Ammobaculites ST-747-A zone, including the Pouce Coupe and f, Spirit 
P-iver 11 sands, seem to constitute one lithologic unit of shale with 
considerable interbedded sand, which would appear to have been deposit¬ 
ed in shallow water. 

(4) The replacement by iron sulfide (pyritization) of the

original wall material of many specimens in the fauna seems to indicate 
a rather toxic condition, possibly such as one would encounter in a 
brackish water, lagoonal (?) type of environment. 

(5) There are no exclusively deep water forms in the fauna. 

Some of the genera, such as Dorothia . have been reported only from 
shallow water deposits in outside areas, while nearly all of the 
others are definitely associated with a shallow water habitat. 

(6) The almost total absence of any calcareous forms such as one 
would expect to find in a warm water environment, seems to indicate a 
cool or temperate water habitat, not unlike those along our present 
day Atlantic shoreline. 

Lower Turonian Haplophragmoides ST~664 < -A Microfauna 
Only four genera are represented in this Lower Turonian fauna, 
Kaplophragmoides ( 52 %), Trochammina (22$) 9 Gumbelitria (17%). and 
Tritaxia (9%). 

The environment of the fauna appears neritic, but relatively 
shallow and cool, with depth of water probably in the neighborhood 
of 100 to 300 feet, but perhaps as deep as 600 feet, a depth equi- 
valent to the seaward edge of our present day continental shelf. 

The reasons for this interpretation are; - 

(l) The species of Haplophragmoides and. Trochammina . Haplo ¬ 
phragmoides ST-664-A and Trochammina ST-65S-A . characteristic of 
the fauna, are more finely arenaceous than are the species of these 
genera, typical of the fauna of the underlying Arm obaculites ST"747-A 
zone. The preponderance of finely arenaceous forms seems to indicate 
a somewhat deeper water phase than the one inhabited by coarsely

arenaceous forms. 

(2) The temporary disappearance of such normally shallow water 
forms as Ammobaculites . Dorothia . Gaudryina , and others, at the end 
of the Cenomanian (writer’s interpretation), would indicate a deeper 
water depositional environment for the later sediments. 

(3) Tritaxia . a finely arenaceous genus, occurring much more 
commonly in this fauna than elsewhere, has not been reported (Galloway 
1933, p. 218) from Recent oceans in water any shallower than 155 
fathoms• 

(4) The Inocerami of the accompanying megafauna are relatively 
thin-shelled, a feature of deeper water pelecypods. 

(5) The comparative dearth of calcareous forms is indicative of 
a cool water habitat for this fauna also as for the Upper Cenomanian 
fauna. 

Lower Turonian Pelagic Microfauna 

The three genera which comprise, over 99$ of this Pelagic fauna 
are Gumbelitria (44$), Globigerina (32$), and Gumbelina (23$). The 
only other genus found was Haoloohragmoides ■> specimens of #iich con¬ 
stitute less than 1$ of the overall total. 

Environment ; - It is difficult to interpret the environment of 
such a pelagic assemblage of foraminifera. Globigerina occurs abund¬ 
antly in the bathyal zone (600 to 6000 feet) of our Recent oceans, but 
since this genus is pelagic, it would not be unreasonable to expect a 
fair number of specimens in the neritic zone (100 to 600 feet) or 
straddling the neritic and bathyal zones. The presence of this pelagic

microfauna is probably indicative of a deeper part of the neritic 
environment, than is the fauna of the underlying Hap1ophragmoides 
ST-66A-A zone* It would be rather difficult to account for the 
presence of a continental slope or bathyal zone in the Peace River 
Area during Upper Cretaceous time. 

The occurrence of pelagic forms to the exclusion of nearly 
all other groups might be interpreted as an indication of unfavor¬ 
able conditions for benthonic microfaunas within the neritic 


environment

Doe Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 165 below the base of the 
Pouce Coupe sand. 

Paratype (Fig. 3) locality; - same as for holotype, at a depth 
of 937.5 feet. 

Holotype and Paratypes: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range; - This species is restricted to the basal portion of the 
Kaskapau at all localities, rarely occurring above the top of the 
A mmobaculites ST-930-A zone, and unrecorded to date above the top of 
the Gaudryina ST-876-A zone, that is, the top of the Pouce Coupe sand. 
Maximum development occurs in the Spirit River section at a footage 
of 115 above the base of the Kaskapau; at the Dunvegan locality of 
C47-9 at a footage of 95 above the base; at the Doe Creek localities 
of G45-5 and S47-4 at a footage of approximately 155 above the base 
of the Kaskapau. 

Comparison; - This species is similar to Ammobaculites tvrrelli 
Nauss, in having the same type of wall structure, transverse sutures, 
and an apertural accentuation. However, A. tvrrelli is a much more 
robust form than this species, and differs also in having a more 
involute coiled portion. Furthermore, the chamber dimensions in 
the two species are different, with the length and width of the 
chambers in the uniserial portion of A. ST-93Q-A being approximately 
equal, whereas in A tvrrelli . the length is much shorter than the 


width

Ammobaeulites G45-5-110-A 


Plate I, Fig. 4® 

Test roughly square in outline, compressed, consisting only of a 
closely coiled early portion with seven chambers visible in ultimate 
whorl; wall coarsely arenaceous, with sharply angular grains of about 
.04 mm. in maximum diameter, very little cement present giving mosaic 
appearance to the test, and a transparent glaze to the exterior; sut¬ 
ures slightly curved, slightly raised, thickened; aperture simple, 
near the peripheral margin on the ultimate face. 

Maximum diameter of holotype ,42 mm., thickness *15 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 
locality G45-5 in Lsd. 13, Sec. 10, Tp. 81, Rge. 13- W 6th Meridian, 

Doe Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 110 below the base of the Fouce 
Coupe sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Collec¬ 
tion, 

Ranges - Most of the specimens of this rather rare species are 
found at the Doe Creek localities G45-5 and S47-4, where maximum dev¬ 
elopment occurs at a footage of 155 above the base of the Kaskapau, 
with the species rarely being observed above this level. 

Only one positive identification was made in the Spirit River 
Structure Test hole at a footage of 94 above the base of the Kaskapau. 
Excessive pyritization of many lower Kaskapau forms in the Spirit River 
Area renders any further identifications of this species questionable. 

Comparison: - This species is similar to Haplophragmoides rugose 
Cushman and Waters from the Upper Cretaceous Navarro formation of Texas

in having an identical wall structure, that is one composed of neatly- 
fitting angular grains. However, the Canadian species is much ooin- 
pressed, thinner, and is readily distinguished by its broad sutures. 

The position of the aperture retains this species in Ammobaculites , 

Ammobaculites G45-19-0-A

Test fairly robust, umbilicate, consisting of a coiled portion 
only, of five to six chambers, ultimate one roughly pentagonal in 
outline; sutures depressed, usually obscure, but readily visible in 
partially pyritized forms, and in some surface specimens; wall coarse¬ 
ly arenaceous, grains up to ,075 mm., in figured specimens, larger in 
others, held together by a relatively small amount of cementing mater¬

Paratype (Fig, 14) locality: - as above, at a depth of 747.5 feet, 
15.5 feet above the top of the "Spirit River" sand. 

Holotype and Paratypes: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range: - This species was found to occur commonly in the 
Ammobaculites ST-747-A zone at Spirit River, not above it, and only 
rarely below the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent, in the top beds of the 
underlying Gaudrvina ST-876-A zone. At the Dunvegan locality of 
S47-27, the species was found in a sample taken 2 feet above the 
top of the "Spirit River" sand equivalent, while at the Pouce Coupe 
River locality of G45-19, it was not observed any higher stratigraphic- 
ally than the 0 to 5 feet interval above the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Comparison: - This species is the same as Ammobaculites 27-2-B 
of Stelck from the Dunvegan localitj^ of S47-27 at a point 2 feet above 
the "Spirit River" sand equivalent. It is similar to Haolophragmoides 
ST-7A0-A , in having identical wall structure and sutures, but the ter¬ 
minal position of the aperture in Ammobaculites G45-19-Q-A and the 
general appearance of its ultimate chamber, which seems to indicate 
that an uncoiled uniserial portion is about to develop, serve to dis¬ 
tinguish between these two forms. It appears likely that Ammobaculites 
GA5-19-Q-A has descended from Haplophragmoides ST- 7 40-A .

to the zone. At the Dunvegan locality of S47-27, the species occurs 
directly above the "Spirit River” sand equivalent. It is found at 
the Fouce Coupe River localities of G45-6 and G45-19 from the interval, 
0 to 50 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand. At the Henderson Creek 
localities of G45-4 and G45-3, several specimens are found in the 
interval 135 to 150 feet above the projected 'top of the Pouce Coupe 
sand at the former locality, while three isolated occurrences are re¬ 
corded from a bed 100 feet stratigraphically higher at the latter 
locality. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Ammobaculites 28-9-A 
of Stelck from the base of the "Spirit River* 1 sand equivalent, at the 
Dunvegan locality of S47-28. Dr-. Stelck 1 s hypotype is very similar 
to the writer’s paratype. 

Ammobaculites ST-745“A 

Plate II, Fig. 18, 19. , 

Test fairly robust, cylindrical in cross-section, but usually 
found considerably flattened due to distortion in fossilization; 
early portion closely coiled, generally comprising about half of test, 
with four or five chambers visible; later portion, nearly always bent, 
of two approximately equal chambers, rarely two and one-half to three, 
in uniserial arrangement; sutures oblique, depressed, distinct in 
partially pyritized, cylindrical specimens, fainter in flattened, non- 
pyritized forms; wall arenaceous, with quartz grains of about .025 mm., 
amount of cement not great; aperture terminal, central, simple.

River 1 * sand. 

Paratype locality: - as above, same depth. 

Holotype and Paratype: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range: - At Spirit River, this rather frequently occurring species 
is confined to the Ixnrnobaculites ST-747-A zone, and could thus be listed 
as a post-Pouce Coupe guide fossil. It does not occur commonly in other 
areas, but at the Dunvegan locality of S47-27, one questionable form is 
found 2 feet above the l,i Spirit River” sand equivalent, while at the 
Pouce Coupe River locality of G45-6, some specimens are recorded at a 
footage of 40 above the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Comparison: - This species seems to represent a more mature 


development of Ammobaculites G45-19-0-A from the same zone

development occurring at a footage of 45 above the base of the 
Kaskapau. It is uncertain whether or not this species occurs out¬ 
side of the Spirit River Area, but at the Dunvegan locality of 
C47-9, one questionable specimen is found at a footage of 105 above 
the base of the Kaskapau. In addition, one doubtful form was recover¬ 
ed from the Doe Creek locality of G45-5 at a footage of 80 above the

.Ammobaculites? 4-196-C of Stelck from the Deo Creek locality of 
S47-4 at a footage of 196 below the Pouce Coupe sand or 74 above 
the base of the Kaskapau formation. However, Stelck’s species is ' 
smaller in size, more scaphitoid in outline, and has more oblique 
sutures than has the writer’s species.

found in the Spirit River section. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Flabellammina A-97-B 
of Stelck from the Doe Creek locality of S47-4 at a footage of 97 
below the Pouce Coupe sand. 

This form probably stands in varietal or immature relationship 
to Flabellammina G45-5-1I0-B . and differs from Flabellammina 
G45-5-105-A in lacking bilateral symmetry.

chambers obscured, first four small, of approximately equal size, 
last two much larger, and comprising about four-fifths of the size 
of the test; sutures indistinct, obscured by the overlapping mar¬ 
gins of the later chambers, arcuate, extending back to coiled portion; 
wall arenaceous, with quartz grains averaging .04 mm., occasional 
grain up to .1 mm., embedded in a fair amount of cement, but surface 
rather rough and uneven; aperture terminal, slightly produced, poss¬ 
ibly elliptical.

S47-36, specimens were recovered in the interval, beginning 10 or 20 
feet above the Pouce Coupe sand, and extending upwards to the “white 
chalcedonic bed”. This species has not been recognized in the eastern 
part of the report area. 

Comparison: - This form is very similar to Flabellammina 36-11S-B 
of Stelck, from the Kiskatinaw River locality of S47-36 at a footage of 
118 below the l5l white chalcedonic bed 11 . Dr. Stelck’s figured specimen 
shows a more involute coiled portion than does the author’s holotype, 
but beyond this minor detail, the forms appear to be identical.

Bunvegan. Several specimens are found at the Bunvegan locality of 
C47-9 in samples taken at footages of 125 and 135 (top of the 
sampled section) above the base of the Kaskapau. At the Doe Creek 
locality of G45-5, maximum development appears to occur at a foot¬ 
age of 175 above the base of the Kaskapau, with no positive identi¬ 
fications being recorded from higher levels. 

Comparison: - This species is similar to Gaudryina hectori 
Nauss from the Lloydminster shale of eastern Alberta, in that it 
is approximately the same size, has identical sutures, and the 
same general type of wall structure. However, Gaudryina ST-876-A 
has a stouter triserial portion, and does not become biserial until 
rather late in its development, as opposed to the relatively long 
biserial stage in Gaudryina hectori , Gaudryina ST-676-A has less 
cement than G, hectori , thus not appearing so smoothly finished as 


the latter

interval 8 to 188 feet below the top of the Lower Speckled Shale. 


Remarks: - Glohigerina cretacea . a universal Upper Cretaceous 
index fossil, has been reported, along with Gumbelina globulosa and 








- 74 - 


Gumbelitrla cretacea . by Wickenden (1945, p. 33) from the Favel 
formation of Manitoba. Young (1951, p. 65) has recently reported 
this species from the "Vascoceras beds” of the Frontier formation 
of the Colorado group in southern Montana. In the Vermilion area 
of eastern -Alberta, Nauss (1945, p. 1617) has reported the form 
from the Lloydminster shale (Colorado age). The writer has observ¬ 
ed this species in well samples from ithe Second White Speckled Shale 
horizon of the Colorado group in the Edmonton area of central Alberta. 

This pelagic form, seems to have world-wide distribution and the 
name has been used to embrace a ^form species 1 ®. For these reasons, a 
critical synonomy is omitted as it would entail type specimen research 
in foreign museums.

Alberta, at a depth of 562 feet, 160 feet below the top of the Lower 
(Second) White Speckled Shale horizon of the Kaskapau formation. 

Plesiotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Coll¬ 
ection. 

Range: - In the report area, this species has not been found 
outside of the Spirit River section, where it is restricted to the 
interval 8 to 182 feet below the top of the Lower Speckled Shale. 

Remarks: The discussion under Clobigerina cretacea is appli¬ 
cable here also, since the two forms occur in dose association. 

In addition, according to Cushman (1946, p. 106), ’’This species 
in Europe seems to occur mainly in the Sencnlan and Maestrichtian and 
in America apparently ranges downward from horizons as high as the 
Kemp Clay at the top of the Navarro group to horizons as low as at 
least the middle part of the Taylor marl, with rare occurrences below. 
It apparently developed from Gumbelina reussi which occurs in the 
lower part of the section and does not have the earlier chambers so 
globose.” Cushman questioned the identification of Gumbelina globulosa 
from the Niobrara and other chalks of the Kansas-Nebra ska region, and 
thought that possibly such forms might be Identified as G. reussi upon 
examination of the original material. It would therefore follow that 
the Western Canadian forms, identified as G. globulosa from correlative 
formations of Turonian age, might be more correctly included under G. 
reussi . However, the writer'decided to continue to include this form 
under G. globulosa . after comparing it with specimens of the species 
recovered from a sample of the Taylor Marl, taken at a clay pit, two 
miles west of Taylor, Texas.

Genus GUMBELITRIA Cushman, 1933 
Gumbelitria ST-782-A 
Plate II, Fig. 11. 

Test gradually tapering, twisted about one-third of the 
distance from the apertural end, where the chamber arrangement 
changes from three to two to a whorl; chambers, eighteen in tri¬ 
serial portion, three to four in biserial portion, expanding rather 
rapidly, and inflated, with those in biserial portion much larger 
and more inflated than the earlier chambers; sutures distinct, 
depressed; wall calcareous, finely perforate; aperture a large 
semi-circular opening at the inner margin of the ultimate chamber. 

Length of holotype .28 mm.; maximum width .12 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Spirit River 
Structure Test #&-337-l in Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- W 6th 
Meridian, Alberta, at a depth of 782 feet, 60 feet above the top of 
the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type 
Collection. 

Range: - This rather rare form is restricted for the most 
part to the Armnobaculites ST-747-A zone of the central Kaskapau, 
with one isolated occurrence being recorded in the Ajmnobaculites 
ST-930-A zone of the lower Kaskapau. It has not been recognized 
outside of the Spirit River Area. 

Remarks: - Possibly, this species should be referred to the 
genus Neobulimina . but tentatively the writer has decided to

classify it under Gumbelitria , because of its large, semi-circular 
aperture, and again, because biseriality is not developed until a 
very late stage,

with Globigerina cretacea and Gumbelina globulosa . but unlike the 
latter two, which are not found below this point, it ranges down 
into beds of the Ammobaculites ST"747-A zone, and occurs very rare¬ 
ly in the Gaudryina ST-876-A zone, that is below the Pouce Coupe sand 
equivalent* Gumbelitria cretacea has not been found outside of Spirit 
River in the report area* 

Remarks: - Gumbelitria cretacea has a wide distribution in the 
Upper Cretaceous rocks of the western hemisphere. Cushman (1946, 
p. 103) has reported the form from the Upper Cretaceous of Colombia, 
South America, from the Navarro group in the Gulf Coast Region of the 
United States, and from the Upper Cretaceous of New Jersey* Wickenden 
(1945, p« 33) reports the species from the Favel formation of southern 
Manitoba, and the writer has seen the form in well samples from the 
Second Ihite Speckled Shale horizon of the Colorado group in the 
Edmonton area of central Alberta. 

Gumbelitria ST-596-A 
Plate III, Fig. 19. 

Test of medium size, gradually tapering, consisting of eight 
whorls of three chambers each; chambers, rather gradually increas¬ 
ing in size, somewhat inflated, final three the largest and most 
inflated; sutures distinct, depressed; wall calcareous, finely per¬ 
forate, often polished smooth in places and appearing hyaline; aper¬ 
ture a wide semi-elliptical opening at the inner margin of the ultim¬ 


ate chamber

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Lhnited Spirit River 
Structure Test #A-337-l in Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- 
W 6th Meridian, Alberta, at a depth of 596 feet, 194 feet below 
the top of the Lower (Second) Ihite Speckled Shale horizon of 
the Kaskapau formation. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type 
Collection. 

Ranges - In the Spirit River Area, this form occurs in close 
association with Gumbelitria cretacea . but is not nearly as comm¬ 
on as the latter form. It has not been observed above a point in 
the section, about 150 feet below the top of the Lower Speckled 
Shale, but like G. cretacea . it ranges down into the lower Kaska¬ 
pau beds. 

Comparisons - This form seems to be very closely related to 
G. cretacea . and is probably either the microspheric stage of the 
latter species or an elongate variety of it. In many cases, where 
this form is broken, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to 
distinguish it from G. cretacea . Thus, some of the specimens re¬ 
corded under G. cretacea in the microfaunal log may actually belong 


to G. ST-596-A ,

Range: - This species occurs in the lower and lower central 
parts of the Kaskapau, not being found above the Ammobaculites 
ST-747-A zone. At Spirit River, most of the recorded occurrences 
are from levels below the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent, while at the 
Doe Creek localities of G45-5 and S47-4* all of the specimens were 
recovered from beds below the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Comparison: - This species is rather similar to Haplophragmoides 
ST-902-A . and may well be ancestral to it. H. SR-1Q18-B differs 
mainly from H. ST"902-A in being somewhat smaller in size, more umbil- 
icate, and less involute. 

Haplophragmoide s SR-1011-B

ing preceding whorl; chambers, of approximately equal size, seven 
to seven and one-half visible in ultimate whorl, five or six in pen¬ 
ultimate whorl; sutures distinct, flush, slightly curved; wall very 
finely arenaceous, with much cement, giving a smooth external finish; 
aperture semilunar at the base and slightly to one side of the termin¬ 
al face, extending part way to the umbilical region.

Holotype and Paratype: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range: - This species occurs in the lower and lower central 
parts of the Kaskapau, not being found above the Ammobaculites 
S T-747-A zone. At Spirit River, most of the recorded occurrences 
are from beds below the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. A few speci¬ 
mens are found in the pre-Pouce Coupe beds at the Doe Creek local¬ 
ities of G45-5 and 347-4, while one specimen was recovered at a 
footage of 15 above the top of the Pouce Coupe sand at the Pouce 
Coupe River locality of G45-19. A questionable occurrence was re¬ 
corded at the Dunvegan locality of C47-9 from a footage of 95 above 
the base of the Kaskapau. 

Comparison: - This species is very closely related to Hanlo -

Holotype and Paratype: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range: - This species occurs characteristically in the Gaudryina 
ST“876-A zone of the lower Easkapau. At Spirit River it is found 
commonly in the interval 139 to 195 feet above the base of the 
Easkapau, reaching its acme at a footage of 179 above the base, that 
is, 22 feet below the base of Pouce Coupe sand equivalent, and not 
often occurring above this horizon. At the Doe Creek localities of 
G45-5 and S47-4, maximum development occurs at a footage of 250 above 
the base of the Easkapau or 20 feet below the base of the Pouce 
Coupe sand. A concentration of specimens was recovered at the Bunve- 
gan locality of C47-9* from a footage of 115 above the base of the 
Easkapau. 

Comparison: - This species is rather similar to Hanlonhragmoides 
SR-1Q1&-B and may be descended from it. H. ST-902-A differs mainly 
from H. SR~1Q1S“B in being somewhat larger in size, not noticeably 
umbilicate, and more involute. 

Flattened forms of H. ST-902“A bear a resemblance to specimens 
of Hanlophragmoides G45“4“55“A . The latter species is generally 
larger in size, has at least one additional chamber in the ultimate 
whorl, and its sutures are radial, as compared to the curved and sig¬ 
moidal development in those of H. ST-902-A .

ST-930-A and Gaudryina ST-876-A zones. Several specimens are noted 
at Spirit River from the A. SI-930-A zone, but no positive identifi¬ 
cation has been made above it. At the Dunvegan locality of C47-9, 
a couple of specimens are observed in the A. ST-930-A zone, at a 
footage of 95 above the base of the Kaskapau. 

Remarks: - In the Spirit River subsurface section, it is diffi¬ 
cult to distinguish this foim from some compressed, flattened, and 
partially pyritized forms of Haplophragmoides ST-850- A. Compression 
sometimes tends to produce a sigmoidal development of the sutures in 
H. ST-85Q-A. and as the sigmoidal nature of the sutures of H. G45-5-85-A 
is its most striking specific characteristic, confusion may thus arise 
in differentiating between these two forms. However, the grain size 
of H, G45-5-85-A is never greater than •01 mm. 

Haulophr agmoide s ST-850-A

enlarging, somewhat inflated, seven in ultimate whorl, first three 
and last four in groups of approximately equal size; sutures not very 
distinct, slightly depressed, slightly curved; wall arenaceous, grains 
averaging about .03 mm., with the occasional grain up to .05 mm. and 
larger, amount of cement not great; aperture, a triangular opening at

top of the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. 

Paratype (Fig. 25) locality: - as above, at a depth of 75# 
feet, 5 feet above the top of the ^Spirit River” sand. 

Paratype (Fig. 26) locality: - as above, at a depth of 754 
feet, 9 feet above the top of the ”Spirit River” sand. 

Holotype and Paratypes: - University of Alberta Paleontolog¬ 
ical Type Collection. 

Range: - This species occurs commonly in the three lower micro- 
faunal zones of the Kaskapau, being recovered from the Spirit River 
and Dunvegan sections in all three zones, and at Doe Creek from the 
lower two. The preservation varies considerably in this form, making 
it a difficult one to identify, and consequently reducing its value 
in correlation work. 

Comparison: - This species is similar to Hanlophragmoides collvra 
Nauss in having approximately the same number of chambers, nearly 
straight sutures, and the same type of aperture. However, the wall of 
H. ST-850-A is made up of much coarser quartz grains, and its chambers, 
although somewhat inflated, do not have the globular appearance as ex¬ 
hibited by Nauss 1 s holotype.

the Kaskapau and 2 above the top of the "Spirit River” sand equi¬ 
valent, respectively. It has not been observed in the Pouce Coupe 
Area. 

Comparison: - This species is similar to Haplophragmoides linki 
Nauss in being involute, umbilicate, and in having the same type of 
wall structure and radial sutures. However, H. linki has inflated 
globular chambers, and a rounded periphery as opposed to the somewhat 
compressed chambers and the more angular appearance of H. ST-838-A . 
Furthermore, H. linki appears to be considerably thicker than this 
species. 

H. ST-838-A is quite similar to Haplophragmoides glabra 
Cushman and Waters from the Upper Cretaceous Navarro formation of 
Texas. However, the sutures of the latter form are definitely 
curved, as opposed to the almost radial sutures of H. ST-838-A . 

Again, the holotype of H. glabra has one and one-half to two addi¬ 
tional chambers. 

Haplophragmoides ST-740-A 
KLate II, Fig. 15. 

Test somewhat compressed, periphery broadly rounded; plani- 
spiral, not completely involute with portion of penultimate -whorl 
barely visible, slight umbilical development; chambers obscure, 
about six in ultimate whorl; sutures very faint, depressed, 
straight; wall coarsely arenaceous, grains averaging between .04 
and .05 mm., with individual grains projecting from the finer cem¬ 
enting matrix by at least half of their thickness; aperture, a low 
slit at the base of the ultimate chamber, not often visible.

Diameter of holotype .38 mm.; thickness *11 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Spirit River Struc¬ 
ture Test #A-337-l in Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- W 6th Merid¬ 
ian, Alberta, at a depth of 740 feet, 23 feet above the top of the 
n Spirit River” sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Collec¬ 
tion. 

Range: - This species occurs characteristically in the Ammobac - 
u lites ST-747-A zone of the lower central Kaskapau in association 
with A. GA5-19-0-A . At Spirit River, only a few specimens were 
found below the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent, in the top beds of the 
Gaudrvina ST-876-A zone. At the Dunvegan locality of S47-27, several 
specimens were recovered in a sample taken 2 feet above the "Spirit 
River” sand equivalent. 

Comparison: - This species is very similar to Ammobaculites 
G45-19-0-A . the only major difference between the two forms being 
the position of the aperture, which is of course, terminal in 
Ammobaculites . In addition, it is often quite apparent from the 
outline of the last chamber in A. G45-19-0-A . that the form is tend¬ 
ing to develop an uncoiled uniserial portion. It would seem that 
H. ST-740-A is the ancestral form of A. G45-19-0-A . 

H. ST-740-A seems to be rather closely related to H. rugosa 
Cushman and Waters from the Upper Cretaceous Navarro formation of 
Texas. However, H. ST-740-A is a much more compressed form and lacks 
the prominent umbilicus of the Texas species. Furthermore, the quartz

grains in the Canadian form are not so neatly arranged, and there 
is considerably more cementing material holding them together than 
there is in the Texas species, which appears to have very little 
cement. 

Again, H. 5T-7A0-A is quite similar to H. calcula Cushman 
and Waters from the Navarro formation and earlier beds of Texas, 
but the latter form seems to have much more cementing material, and 
it of a finer nature, than does the Alberta species*

Paratype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 
locality G45-3 in Lsd. 12, Sec. 15, Tp. 79, Rge. 13- W 6th Merid¬ 
ian on Henderson Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 65 above the 
“white chalcedonic bed” or about 265 feet above the projected top 
of the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype and Paratype: - University of Alberta Paleontologic¬ 
al Type Collection. 

Range: - This species is a post-Pouce Coupe form with a 
widespread occurrence over the report area. In the Howard Creek 
outcrop section, it occurs mainly in the interval 10 to 25 feet 
above the base of the Haolonhragmoides ST-664-A zone, that is, 
about 30 to 45 feet above the top of the "Spirit River" sand. 

At Spirit River, the form occurs over approximately the same 
interval, but due to poor core recovery, not very many specimens 
were recovered. At the Henderson Creek localities of G45-3 and 
G45-4, the species ranges over an interval from 55 feet below the 
"white chalcedonic bed" to the top of the sampled section, 150 feet 
above this bed, or about 350 feet above the projected top of the 
Pouce Coupe sand. H. G46-1-10-A is present at the Pouce Coupe loc¬ 
alities of G45-6 and G45-19 over an interval 10 to 20 feet above 
the Pouce Coupe sand. In the Xiskatinaw River section, it occurs 
over an interval from 74 feet below the "white chalcedonic bed“ to 
12 feet above it (70 to 157 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand). At 
the Dunvegan locality of S47-27, one specimen was recovered from a 
sample taken 2 feet above the "Spirit River" sand equivalent.

Comparison: - This species is identical to Haplophragmoides 
36-32-A of Stelck, from the Kiskatinaw River locality of S47-36, 
at a footage of 32 below the "white chalcedonic bed". 

H. G46-1-1Q-A is similar to H. ST-66A-A in having about the 
same number of chambers, and in being evolute to about the same 
degree. However, the former species is considerably smaller and 
its sutures are radial and depressed, as opposed to the curved and 
flush sutures of H, ST-664-A . H. G46-1-10-A is also more smoothly 
finished than is H. ST-664-A . and has no quartz grains in its make¬ 
up larger than the cementing material, whereas the latter species 
does have some grains considerably larger than those in the matrix. 

Haplophragmoide s ST-664-4 
Plate II, Fig. 27. 

Plate III, Fig. 7, S, 9. 

Test of fair size, usually found in a flattened state as 
illustrated by paratype (PI. Ill, Fig. 9) periphery rounded; test 
planispiral, partly evolute with umbilicus exposing about six chambers 
of penultimate whorl; chambers, eight and one-half to nine and one- 
half in ultimate whorl, very gradually enlarging in size; sutures 
distinct, except in crushed forms, where their presence is indicated 
by slight ridges, flush to slightly raised, thickened, curved; wall 
finely arenaceous, with an occasional grain of .015 mm. size, consider¬ 
able amount of cement, giving a generally smooth finish to the exterior 
aperture, a low triangular opening at the base of the ultimate chamber, 
slightly to one side of the equatorial region.

Comparison: - This species is similar to Haplophragmoides 
G46-1-10-A in having the same number of chambers, and in being 
evolute to about the same degree. However, this species is 
considerably larger and its sutures are curved and flush, as 
opposed to the radial and depressed sutures of H. GA6-1-1Q-A . 

H. ST -664-A is not as smoothly finished as H. G46-1-10-A . and 
has some quartz grains of considerably larger size than its 
cementing material, whereas the grain size in H. G46-1-1Q-A is 
not distinguishable from the matrix.

chalcedonic bed” or a projected footage of 145 above the top of 
the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type 
Collection. 

Range: - This species occurs in the central portion of the 
Kaskapau formation in the western part of the report area, above 
the Pouce Coupe sand, and above and below the "white chalcedonic 
bed”. At the Henderson Creek localities of G45-4 and G45-3, the 
most specimens were recovered at the base of the sampled section, 
that is, in the Ammobaculite s ST-747-A zone, at a footage of 55 - 
60 below the "white chalcedonic bed 11 , while the highest recorded 
occurrences were at a footage of 80 above this bed, (280 feet above 
the projected top of the Pouce Coupe sand). At the Kiskatinaw 
River locality of S47-36, one specimen was found at a footage of 
46 below the "white chalcedonic bed” or 98 feet above the Rouce 
Coupe sand. 

Comparison: - This species is rather similar to flattened 
forms of Hanlophragmoides ST-902-A . but can be distinguished from 
the latter by its generally larger size, the presence of at least 
one additional chamber in the ultimate whorl, and the radial sutures. 
In addition, H. ST-902- A is often found in a pyritized state, a con¬ 
dition not observed in H. G45-4-55-A .

Comparison: - This species is identical to Hanlophragmoides 
35-6-B of Stelck, from the same locality and footage. In his re¬ 
marks, Stelck (1950, p. 131) commented on the similarity of this 
form to Trochammina . “this species with unequal involution is sugg¬ 
estive of Trochammina but inasmuch as the aperture is on the more 
evolute side it may be left in the genus K anlophragmoide s w . 

Haulophragmoide s G45-3-80-1 
Plate III, Fig. 2. 

Test planispiral, evolute, with umbilicus exposing about 
two and one-half whorls on both sides of test; test compressed, 
periphery rounded; chambers, of approximately equal size, about 
ten and one-half in both ultimate and penultimate whorls; sutures 
distinct, slightly depressed, thickened, strongly arcuate; wall 
finely arenaceous, with much cement giving a smooth external finish; 
aperture, a low slit at the base of the ultimate chamber. 

Diameter of holotype .31 mm.; thickness .08 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 
locality G45-3 in Lsd. 12, Sec. 15, Tp. 79, Kge. 13- W 6th Meridian, 
on Henderson Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 80 above the “white 
chalcedonic bed“ or about 280 feet above the projected top of the 
Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Collec¬ 
tion. 

Range: - This species has not been observed outside of the west¬ 
ern part of the report area, where it occurs in the central portion of

the Kaskapau formation, above the Pouce Coupe sand. At the Kiskat- 
inaw River localities of S47-36 and S47-35, some specimens occur be¬ 
tween the footages of 50 below and 6 above the "white chalcedonic 
bed”. The form ranges at the Henderson Creek localities of G45-4 and 
G45-3 over an interval from 40 feet below the "’white chalcedonic bed" 
to 150 above it (the top of the sampled section). 

Comparison: - This form probably stands in varietal relation¬ 
ship to Haplophragmoides G46-1-10-A . differing from the latter in 
having an additional two chambers, and in being much compressed, 
the compression possibly accounting for its arcuate sutures. 

H. G45-3-80-A is very similar to H. G45-3-90-A and it is 
quite possible that the former form is only a much compressed 
counterpart of the latter. 

Haplophragmoides G45-3-90-A 
Plate III, Fig. 1. 

Test planispiral, completely evolute with umbilicus exposing 
about three and one-half whorls on both sides of test; periphery 
rounded, somewhat indented; chambers, of approximately equal size, 
somewhat inflated, subglobular, nine and one-half in ultimate 
whorl, six and one-half in penultimate whorl; sutures distinct, 
depressed, radial, except for last four in ultimate whorl, which 
are slightly curved; wall finely arenaceous, with much cement giv¬ 
ing a smooth external finish; aperture, a low slit with notch at 
the base of the ultimate chamber. 

Diameter of holotype .31 mm.; thickness .11 mm.

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 
locality G45-3 in Lsd. 12, Sec. 15, Tp. 79, Rge. 13- W 6th Meridian 
on Henderson Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 90 above the w white 
chalcedonic bed” or about 290 feet above the projected top of the 
Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type 
Collection. 

Range: - This form has been recognized only in the western 
part of the report area, where it occurs in the central portion of 
the Kaskapau formation, above the Pouce Coupe sand. At the Hender¬ 
son Creek localities of G45-4 and G45-3, the form ranges over an 

i 

interval from 50 feet below the "white chalcedonic bed** to 95 feet 
above it (150 to 295 feet above the projected top of the Pouce 
Coupe sand). At the Kiskatinaw River locality of S47-36, some speci¬ 
mens occur in the interval 6 to 50 feet below the "“white chalcedonic 
bed" • 

Comparison: - This form probably stands in varietal relation¬ 
ship to Hanlophragmoides G46-1-1Q-A . differing from the latter only 
in being more evolute, in having subglobular chambers, and in appar¬ 
ently having one more whorl of chambers. In cases where there has been 
much compression, or where preservation is poor, these two forms can¬ 
not readily be distinguished. 

H. G45-3-90-A is also very similar to H. G45-3-SQ-A and further 
work on these forms might very well show the latter to be merely a 
much compressed counterpart of the former.

is, in the interval 140 to 150 feet above the "white chalcedonic bed” 
(340 to 350 feet above the projected top of the Pouce Coupe sand). 
However, several specimens were recovered at the Kiskatinaw River 
locality of S47-36 from a footage of 74 below the "white chalcedonic 


bed" (70 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand). 

Comparison: - This species is rather similar to

Test somewhat compressed, generally found ad a pyritized or 
partially pyritized replacement, early portion of six chambers, 
planispiral, comprising one-quarter to one-third of length of test, 
becoming biserial while still spiral; later portion biserial, of

on the east bank of the Pouce Coupe River, Alberta, in a sample 
taken from 0 to 5 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype and Paratype: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range: - At Spirit River, the acme of this species occurs 
at a footage of 4 above the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent, with some 
specimens being recorded in the upper beds of the underlying 
Oaudryina ST-876-A zone of the lower Kaskapau® Maximum develop** 
ment occurs at the Pouce Coupe River locality of G45-19 directly 
above the Pouce Coupe sand, with no specimens being found outside 
of the 15 feet of section above this bed., 

Remarks: - It is with some doubt that this species, with its 
terminal aperture, is referred to the genus S plroplectammina . which 
has its aperture at the base of the last chamber. Possibly, it might 
be more accurately classified under the genus Ammobaculoldes . which 
possesses a terminal aperture, but also has a definite uniserial 
portion, which in turn, is lacking in this species. This form can 
probably be regarded as an intermediate stage between the two genera*

the lower portion. At Spirit River, specimens were recovered 
from two short intervals in the basal part of the Kaskapau, the 
lower of these being between the footages of 59 and 6l above the 
base of the formation, with the upper one between the footage of 
150 and 163 above the base. At the Doe Creek localities of G45-5 
and S47-4* a few specimens were found in the lower 90 feet of the 
Kaskapau. Much higher in the section, at the Kiskatinaw River 
localities of S47-36 and S47-35, one form was recovered from the 
former locality at a footage of 74 below the "white chalcedonic 
bed" (70 feet above the Pouce Coupe sand), while the latter local¬ 
ity yielded a specimen from a footage of 12 above the “chalcedonic 
bed". 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Textularia 36-74-A 
of Stelck from the Kiskatinaw River locality of S47-36. Stelek 
(1950, p. 162) noted a similarity to an outside species, "This 
small Text,ularia is somewhat like Textularia pygmaea Reuss from 
the upper Gault but is more twisted than the latter species 15 .

Genus TRITAXIA Reuss, i860 
Tritaxia ST-664-B 
Plate III, Fig. 12, 13, 14. 

Test subtriangular in cross-section, tapering, compressed; 
test triserial, consisting of five whorls of three chambers each; 
chambers gradually enlarging in size; sutures, usually distinct, 
depressed; wall finely arenaceous with much cement, giving a 
rather glistening surface to many specimens; aperture circular, 
produced at the end of the ultimate chamber. Color usually white, 
occasionally light brown or brownish-white. 

Length of holotype (Fig. 12) .28 mm.; maximum width .12 mm. 

Length of paratype (Fig. 13) .26 mm.; maximum width .13 mm. 

Length of paratype (Fig. 14) *28 mm.; maximum width .17 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Spirit River 
Structure Test #A-337-l in Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- W 6th 
Meridian, Alberta, at a depth of 664 feet, 178 feet above the top 
of the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. 

Paratype (Fig. 13) locality: - as above, same depth. 

Paratype (Fig. 14) locality: - as above, at a depth of 630 
feet, 212 feet above the top of the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. 

Holotype and Paratypes: - University of Alberta Paleontolog¬ 
ical Type Collection. 

Range: - This species seems to range over most of the Kaskapau 
section studied, but it occurs much more commonly in the Haplophrag- 
moides ST-664-A zone of the central Kaskapau than elsewhere. At 
Spirit River, most of the specimens were found in this zone, with

only a relatively few being recovered from beds of the underlying 
microfaunal zones. At the Henderson Creek localities of G45-3 and 
G45-4> it was observed to occur sporadically in beds of the central 
Kaskapau, both above and below the w white chalcedonic bed 11 . At the 
Pouce Coupe River locality of G45-6, some specimens were found at 
a footage of 15 above the Pouce Coupe sand. The only recorded 
occurrence of this species from beds below the Pouce Coupe sand, 
in the western part of the report area, was at the Doe Creek local¬ 
ity of S47-4, with one specimen being recovered from this section. 

Remarks: - The triseriality of this species is generally not 
apparent from an examination of the vast majority of specimens. It 
is usually compressed in such a manner as to disguise both its tri¬ 
angularity and triseriality, since it appears upon preliminary 
examination, as a flattened, biserial form. Distortion in fossil- 
ization in some cases produces rather weird shapes of the test, 
making positive Identification of this species difficult. 

Tritaxia ST-618-A 
Plate III, Fig. 15. 

Test elongate, compressed, triserial, with about seven whorls 
of three chambers apiece; chambers gradually enlarging in size, 
those in last four whorls approximately equal; sutures indistinct, 
depressed; wall finely arenaceous, with grains no larger than .015 
mm., moderate amount of cement; aperture circular, produced, at the 
end of the last chamber; color light brown or brownish-white.

Length of holotype .59 mm .5 maximum width .18 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Spirit River 
Structure Test #1-337-1 in 3Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- W 6 th 
Meridian, Alberta, at a depth of 618 feet, 224 feet above the top 
of the Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Coll¬ 
ection. 

Range: - This form is confined to a 30 foot interval, 143 to 
173 feet above the “Spirit River 11 sand, at the top of the Haplo - 
phra gmoides ST- 66 A-A zone of the central Xaskapau. It has been 
found only at Spirit River. 

Comparison: - Tritaxia ST-618-A is probably an elongate 
variety of T. ST-664-B . Its biserial appearance is thought to 
be due to distortion in fossilization, and the form is considered 
to have been triserial originally.

about six in penultimate whorl; chambers, gradually enlarging, only 
those of the last whorl visible on the ventral side, which is umbili- 
cate; sutures distinct, somewhat thickened, depressed, curved on the

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 
locality S47-4 in Tp. 81, Rge. 13- W 6th Meridian at Doe Creek 
canyon, east of Doe River P.0., British Columbia, from a footage 
of 186 below the base of the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type 
Collection. 

Range: - With one exception, this species is restricted to 
the pre-Pouce Coupe beds of the Kaskapau. At the Doe Creek local¬ 
ities of G45-5 and S47-4> the acme oecurs at a footage of 82 above 
the base of the Kaskapau. The species is not a common one in the 
Spirit River section, where it appears to be confined to the 
Ammobaculites ST-93Q-A zone of the basal Kaskapau. The one exception, 
that is, the occurrence above the Pouce Coupe sand, was noted at the 
Pouce Coupe River locality of G45-6> in a bed 15 to 20 feet above the 
Pouce Coupe sand. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Trochammina 4-172-B 
of Stelck from the same locality, with a distance of only 14 feet be¬ 
tween the elevations at which Stelck 1 s hypotype and the writer*s holo¬ 
type were collected. 

Upon a rough examination, this form appears to be almost the same 
as T. ST-956-C . but the latter form has less chambers in its ultimate 
whorl, and lacks the thickened, curved, dorsal sutures of T.S47-4-186-A *

Furthermore, the chambers in this species are considerably small¬ 
er than the ones in T. ST-956-C . 

Trochammina ST-956-C 
Plate I, Fig# 11, 12# 

Test small, periphery rounded; test trochoid, with a low 
spire, of three whorls with six and one-half chambers in ultimate 
whorl, seven and one-half chambers in penultimate whorl, and about 
five in primary whorl; ventral side of test rather umbilicate; 
sutures distinct, depressed, slightly curved, nearly radial on 
dorsal side, radial on ventral side; wall generally finely arenac¬ 
eous, but with a rare grain as large as .03 mm., considerable amount 
of cement, giving a smooth exterior finish to most specimens, more 
noticeable in outcrop forms; aperture, a low opening at the base 
of the ultimate chamber on the ventral side, lying about midway 
between the periphery and the umbilicus#

Range: - This species is confined to the pre-Pouce Coupe beds 
at all localities. At Spirit River, it occurs commonly over the 
interval, extending from the base of the Kaskapau to a footage of 
105 above it, and less commonly in the overlying beds of the 
Gaudryina ST-876-A zone to a point 170 feet above the Kaskapau base* 
It is present at the Pouce Coupe River locality of G45-18 and at the 
Doe Creek localities of G45-5 and S47-4 over an interval, extending 
from the Dunvegan-Kaskapau contact upwards to within 55 feet of the 
base of the Pouce Coupe sand. At the Bunvegan locality of C47-9, a 
concentration of specimens was recovered in a sample taken at a 
footage of 95 above the base of the Kaskapau. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Trochammina 4-249-A 
of Stelck from the Doe Creek locality of S47-4 at a footage of 249 
below the base of the Pouce Coupe sand. The writer's views are in 
accord with those of Stelck (1950, p. 169), whose opinion is that 
this form is similar to the early stages of T. ST-892-A ( T. 4-134-3 
of Stelck), and is probably ancestral to the latter. In compiling 
the detailed microfaunal log of Spirit River, the writer concedes 
that some of the specimens referred to this species are probably 
young forms of T. ST-892-A . 

This species is superficially similar to T, S47-A-186-A . but 
has fewer and larger chambers than the latter form, and differs from 
it also in having radial or nearly radial dorsal sutures, as opposed 
to the curved ones of T. S47-4-186 -A.

Plate I, Fig. 15, 16. 

\ 

Test of medium size, periphery angular to broadly rounded; 
test trochoid, with an intermediate-size spire, sombrero-shaped 
in periphery view, with first three whorls representing the crown, 
and final whorl the brim; chambers indistinct, usually distorted, 
about six in ultimate whorl, six in penultimate whorl, and six in 
antepenultimate whorl; sutures often indistinct, appearing slight¬ 
ly curved; wall finely arenaceous with much cement giving a smooth 
exterior finish; aperture not positively observed, assumed to be a 
low opening on the ventral side between the periphery and umbilicus. 

Diameter of holotype (Fig. 15) .33 mm.; thickness through 
spire .14 mm. 

Diameter of paratype (Fig. 16) .3 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Spirit River Structure 
Test #A-337-l in Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- W 6th Meridian, 
Alberta, -at a depth of 892 feet, 163 feet above the projected base

Doe Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 50 below the base of the Pouce 
Coupe sand. 

Holotype and Paratype: - University of Alberta Paleontological 
Type Collection. 

Range: - This species occurs in close association with Troch ¬ 
ammina ST-956-C and is found over approximately the same lower

Kaskapau intervals, at the Doe Creek localities of G45-5 and S47-4, 
and at the Pouce Coupe River locality of G45-19. It is present in 
the Spirit River section, but was not recovered at the Dunvegan 
locality of C47-9. T . ST-892-A is not nearly so common a form as 
T, ST-956- C. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Trochammina 4-134-B 
of Stelck from locality S47-4 at a footage of 134 below the base of 
the Touce Coupe sand. T, ST-892-A appears to be descended from 
T. ST-956-C ( T. 4-249-A of Stelck ). 

Trochammina SF-910-A 
Plate II, Fig. 1, 2, 3. 

Test exhibiting considerable variation in size and method of 
preservation, often found as a partial pyrite replacement, but non- 
pyritized, crushed, pentagonal forms also common, periphery lobulate 
test trochoid with a low spire (holotype. Fig. 2 has the highest 
spire in any of the specimens found), of four whorls, with five 
chambers visible in each of the last three whorls; ventral side, 
with a well-developed umbilicus; chambers enlarging gradually, 
globular in outline; sutures distinct in all but badly crushed 
forms, depressed, curved on dorsal side, radial on ventral side; 
wall finely arenaceous for most part, with an occasional grain as 
large as .03 mm., but usually less than half of this size, and with 
a considerable amount of cementing material, giving a smooth overall 
finish; aperture not observed, assumed to be a low opening on the 
ventral side between the periphery and umbilicus, probably extending 
into the latter. Color light brownish-white in non-pyritized forms.

Range: - At Spirit River, this species occurs erratically in a 
subzone, bearing its name, of the Gaudryina ST-876-4 zone of the lower 
Kaskapau, numerous specimens being found at the base of the subzone 
and again, 5 feet from its top. It is not commonly found above the 
Pouce Coupe sand equivalent. A concentration of specimens was recov¬ 
ered at the Dunvegan locality of C47-9 at a footage of 125 above the 
base of the Kaskapau. This species has not been recognized in the 
Pouce Coupe Area. 

Comparison: - This species is very closely related to Trochamm- 
ina ST-812-A . but has one more whorl of chambers than the latter form, 
and generally is somewhat larger in size.

Again, this species is similar to Trochaimnina albertensis 
Wickenden from the Bearpaw shale of Southern Alberta in being approx¬ 
imately the same size, in having the same number of whorls and cham¬ 
bers, and in having identical sutures. However, T. ST-910-A lades 
the relatively high spiral development of T. albertensis . and appears 
to have coarser grains in its wall structure. 

Trochammina ST-812-A 
Plate II, Fig. 6. 

Test usually small, occasionally medium sized, generally 
partially pyritized, periphery lobulate; test trochoid with a 
low spire, of three whorls, five chambers in both ultimate and 
penultimate whorls, three in primary whorl; chambers enlarging 
gradually, globular in outline; ventral side with a well-developed 
umbilicus; sutures distinct, depressed, slightly curved on dorsal 
side, radial on ventral side; wall arenaceous, with quartz grains 
usually no larger than ,025 mm., cemented with a moderate amount of 
finely arenaceous material, giving a rather smooth overall finish 
to exterior; aperture not observed, assumed to be a low opening on 
the ventral side between the periphery and the umbilicus, probably 
extending into the latter. 

Diameter of holotype .24 mm.; thickness .15 mm.

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type 
Collection. 

Range: - At Spirit River, this species is confined to the 
Ammobaculites ST-747-A zone of the lower central Kaskapau, occur¬ 
ring mainly in the interval 215 to 255 feet above the base of the 
Kaskapau. The form occurs very rarely elsewhere, with one speci¬ 
men being found at the Dunvegan locality of C47-9, from a footage 
of 135 above the base of the Kaskapau. At the Doe Creek locality 
of G45-5, one specimen was identified below the Pouce Coupe sand 
at a footage of ISO above the base of the Kaskapau. 

Comparison: - This species is very closely related to 
T. ST-910-A . but has one less whorl of chambers than the latter 
form, and generally is somewhat smaller in size. However, in many 
cases, both of these species are badly compressed and distorted in 
fossilization, mailing it impossible to count the whorls, and thus 
casting much doubt on any specific identifications attempted. 

Trochammina ST-658-A 
Elate III, Fig. 11, 

Test of fair size, compressed, flattened, periphery lobulate; 
test trochoid with a very low spire, of three whorls, six to seven 
chambers in ultimate whorl, same number in penultimate whorl, and 
about five in primary whorl; ventral side often with a ring-like 
ridge surrounding the umbilicus, created by compression of the cham¬ 
bers on fossilization; chambers gradually enlarging in size, sub- 
globular in outline, often scalloped on ventral side; sutures rather

indistinct, oblique, depressed on dorsal side, radial, and with their 
location usually indicated by ridges on the ventral side; wall mostly 
finely arenaceous, but often with flecks of dark mica up to .04 mm. in 
size, scattered over the dorsal side, concentrated for the most part in 
the region of the spire; amount of cement considerable, giving a fair¬ 
ly smooth finish to the exterior; aperture not recognized, assumed to 
be a low opening on the ventral side between the periphery and the 
umbilicus. 

Diameter of holotype .38 mm.; thickness .05 mm. 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Spirit River Structure 
Test #A-337-1 in Lsd. 16, Sec. 24, Tp. 78, Rge. 7- W 6th Meridian, 
Alberta, at a depth of 658 feet, 184 feet above the top of the Pouce 
Coupe sand equivalent. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Collection. 

Range: - This species occurs commonly in the Hanlophragmoides 
ST-664-A zone of the central part of the Kaskapau at Spirit River, over 
a 50 foot interval ( T. ST-658-A subzone), extending from 63 to 113 feet 
above the top-of the “Spirit River” sand. In the western part of the 
report area, at the Henderson Creek locality of G45-3, about ten speci¬ 
mens were found in the uppermost part of the sampled section, that is, 
135 to 150 feet above the “white chalcedonic bed” (approximately 335 to 
350 feet above the projected top of the Pouce Coupe sand). 

Comparison: - This species does not seem to differ a great deal 
from Trochammina diagonis (Carsey) Cushman and Waters, described orig¬ 
inally from the Upper Cretaceous Navarro group of Texas. The Alberta

al end, chambers increasing rather rapidly in size as added, with final 
volution comprising at least one-third of the length of the test; sut¬ 
ures distinct, depressed; wall finely arenaceous with much cement, 
giving a smooth exterior finish; aperture a broadly arched opening at 
the base of the ultimate chamber.

R.ange: - This species is confined to the pre-Pouce Coupe beds at 
all localities. At Spirit River, it occurs fairly commonly over a 150 
foot interval, from 45 to 195 feet above the base of the Kaskapau. At 
the Dunvegan locality of C47-9, a fair number of specimens were recover¬ 
ed over an interval from 115 to 135 feet (top of the sampled section) 
above the base of the Kaskapau, It occurs in the pre-Pouce Coupe micro- 
faunal zones at the Doe Creek localities of G45-5 and S47-4, but is not 
so common here as in the Spirit River Area. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Verneuilina 3-165-A 
of Stelck from the Doe Creek locality of S47-3, 165 feet below the 
Pouce Coupe sand. It is closely related to V. G45-5-11Q-C ( V. 4-134-A 
of Stelck), but is much more robust and has larger chambers than the 
latter form. 

Stelck noted a similarity betv/een this species and the young 
forms of Verneuilina perulexa Loeblich from the Cenomanian of Texas. 
According to Stelck (1950, p. I8l), the only difference between the 
two is the larger size of the Canadian species. 

Verneuilina G45-5-110-G 
Plate II, Fig. 37. 

Test small, slender, tapering, subtriangular in cross-section; 
test triserial, composed of five convolutions of three chambers each; 
maximum width at penultimate convolution; chambers gradually enlarg¬ 
ing in size; sutures distinct, depressed; wall finely arenaceous, 
grains averaging about .015 mm., with much cement giving a smooth finish 
to the exterior; aperture not positively recognized, but believed to be

chamber* 

Length of holotype .29 mm *; maximum width .12 mm* 

Holotype locality: - Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 
locality G45-5 in Lsd. 13, Sec. 10, Tp. 81, Rge. 13- W 6th Merid¬ 
ian, on Doe Creek, Alberta, at a footage of 110 below the base of 
the Pouce Coupe sand. 

Holotype: - University of Alberta Paleontological Type Coll¬ 
ection. 

Range: - This species is restricted to the pre-Pouce Goupe 
beds in both the Spirit River and Doe Creek sections. At the former 
locality, maximum development appears to occur at a footage of 105 
above the base of the Kaskapau, while at the latter locality, it 
seems to be at a footage of 145 above the base. Furthermore, at 
Doe Creek, the form apparently does not occur above the Ammobaculites 
S T-930-4 zone. 

Comparison: - This species is identical to Verneuilina A-13A-A 
of Stelck from the Doe Creek locality of S47-4 at a footage of 134 
below the base of the Pouce Coupe sand. It is closely related to 
V. SR-1009-A ( V. 3-165-A of Stelck), but is much more slender and 
has smaller chambers than the latter form* Quoting from Stelck*s 
remarks, (1950, p. 182) "It is probably a dwarf variety of the latter 
species”.

Limited Surface Di v ision Loca li ty G45-5 , 

on Doe Creek . Alberta . 

Location ; Lsd.13 - Sec.10 - Tp.81 - Rge.13 - 17 6th Meridian. 


Field Party ; Imperial Oil #13, summer of 1945. 

Geologist in Charge : Joseph Gleddie 


Lithologic Description : No detailed description available. 


Megafossil Identification : By Dr. P.S. Warren, Chairman, 

Department of Geology, 
University of Alberta. 


Sampling Method : Continuous trenching over five feet intervals. 


Remarks: This locality is the same geographically as S47-4, but 

as different sampling methods were employed by the two 
parties, both sets of results are given. It would appear 
that use of the continuous trenching method yields a greater 
variety of forms than does the select discontinuous pattern.

Section B: Foraminiferal Identifications in the 
Upper Cenomanian Beds of the 
Imperial Oil Limited Surface Division 

Locality SA7-A . on Doe Creek. Alberta , 


Location : Tp, 81 - Rge.13- W 6th Meridian. 

Doe Creek canyon at the northernmost 
point of the big bend, east of Doe 
River P.O., British Columbia. 

Section itself is in Alberta. 


Field Party : Imperial Oil #16, summer of 1947. 


Geologist in Charge ? Dr. Charles R. Stelck. 


Lithologic Description : by Dr. Charles R. Stelck. 


Sampling Method : Select discontinuous 

( Actual samples are from six inch 
beds spaced at intervals of four 
to ten feet) 


Remarks : This locality is the same geographically as 

045-5, but as different sampling methods were 
employed by the two parties, both sets of 
results are given. It would appear that use 
of the select discontinuous method does not 
produce such a wide variety of forms as does 
the continuous trenching method, although no 
important horizons are missed, and in some 
cases, more individual specimens are recover¬ 
ed by the former method..
