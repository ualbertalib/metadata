CHAPTER 1 


INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT 

Final examinations are designed primarily to find 
the core of knowledge that the students have accumulated, 
not what they have failed to learn. Thus, we should be 
able to point out, they knew so much. It is not enough to 
say they failed because they did not know certain facts. 

In Alberta, the papers of Grade Xll students are given the 
following gradings: "H", "A", M B M , "C 11 , and n D M . The top 
three gradings allow students to enter university. A 
n C #l grading gives a high school credit but does not permit 
matriculation, while a ,, B M grading represents a failure and 
no credit is given for the year’s work. 

If the examination accomplishes its purpose an in¬ 
vestigator should be able to show in a positive way the 
knowledge core of each group. Furthermore, a certain 
quality of thinking should divide the groups. The invest¬ 
igation on the following pages purports to discover some of 
the differences between the students who made under W C M , 
those who made under 11 B”, and those who made over M B”. It 
is my purpose to make a survey of the differences, a survey 
which shall be both quantitative and qualitative. This 
study, then concerns itself with the differences between 
the relative cores of knowledge of each group and the 
quality of thinking responsible for the answers set down. 






- 2 ~ 

The Sampling 

The sampling was designed to select the answer 
papers of three groups of Grade Xll students who wrote 
the Social Studies 111 examination paper in July 1944. 

The sample included 78 answer papers in the upper range 
of the ,! D M category (those who failed to make "C")* The 
second sample had 57 answer papers from the upper range 
of ,, C ,, category (those who failed to make "B"). The third 
sample included 32 answer papers from the lower range of 
the "B” group (those who just made over r, B ,f )* 

A sampling which included an equal number of answer 
papers in each group would have facilitated this study* The 
table, on the following page, shows the mark distribution 
and frequency of marks in each of the three samples: 

The Method 

The means used to test students has always been 
subjected to severe criticism. However, the quarrel has 
never been, should we measure educational achievement, 
but rather how should it be measured? The Department of 
Education has adopted a certain type of examination as 
the best way to measure educational achievement* The most 
straight forward measurement is the quantity of knowledge 
displayed* Such a measurement lends itself readily to 
statistical compilation*

Bat quantitative measurement is not a sufficient 
basis for barring students from University. A certain 
quality of thinking determines the amount and the value of 
the answers given. The question arises: Is the relative 
quality of thinking between groups "D" and”andand 


measureable? 














T ; r

4 


The difficulty of qualitative measurement is well 
known, the difficulty increases because the questions were 
not specifically designed to reveal quality of thinking* 

The need for this type of investigation on the Grade Xll 
examination paper makes it necessary to proceed regardless 
of the difficulties* With these limitations in mind, I 
have attempted to determine the quality of thinking required 

by the questions# In addition also, I have used my analysis 
of the answers to determine the quality of thinking* 

The Quantitative Data 

I have checked each part of every question for the 
number of correct answers, the partially correct answers, 
the errors, and the parts not attempted. As the number of 
papers in each sample differs greatly, frequency of the corr 
ect answers is meaningless. The tables and the graphs in 
this investigation are based on percentage* Bar graphs are 
used to show the relative percentage attainment of each 
group, to show the relative percentage of errors in each 
group and the relative percentage of parts of questions not 
attempted* 

Errors were noted as there was a possibility that 
type of error and extent of error would show differences 
between the group* However, classification of errors proved 
impossible but the investigator was left certain impressions 
regarding the differences* 

We are not only interested in the core of knowledge 
shown by each group but also which question discriminated 
best*

I have found the average per cent discrimination be¬ 
tween groups H D M and M C M and groups "D" and ,, B U 0 Average per 
cent discrimination of each question is compared to the average 
per cent discrimination of the paper. This method divides 
the questions into three groups: 

1. Those which have above average discrimination. 

2. Those which have average discrimination. 

3* Those which have under average discrimination. 

The English Mark 

The English mark which is included in the final 
grading of the Social Studies test is derived solely from 
the essay question. It has been thought best not to con¬ 
sider the English mark with the Social Studies. Thus the 
figures used are on the basis of the Social Studies mark 
alone. 

The English mark will be considered from the follow¬ 
ing viewpoints: 

1. Per cent of students it helped to push over a 
dividing line. 

2. Per cent it helped to keep under a dividing line. 

3® The correlation of English ability and Social 

Studies ability* 

4. Did the English mark discriminate between groups 
M D M and M C M and groups M C U and M B M ?

The Qualitative Data 

I have noted previously the difficulty of qualitative 
measurement. Many of the questions were not designed to 
measure quality of thinking. The quality evident in the 
answers depends upon the type of question asked and the 
quality of thinking which the individual brings to the 
question. The quality of the answer is the result of the 
interplay of these two factors. 

The quality of thinking should improve as we proceed 
from one category to the other. There is no method known 
to investigators ty which the results of any one question 
can give us a complete picture of the quality of thinking* 

Nor is quality of thinking a unit concept but rather made 
up of many factors. L. L. Thurstone in the No* 1 issue 
of the Psychometric Monograph, sets forth the case of six 
measurable primary mental abilities. Again E. B. Lesley, 
in his book, "Teaching the Social Studies"1 sets forth mental 
abilities which should be developed by this subject. From 
the two sources I have compiled a. series of factors which 
indicate a quality of thinking. If the questions on the 
paper really test qualitatively, we should find increasing 
indication of the presence of such factors. These factors are: 

1. Clearness of Concepts* 

2* Straight Memory (a) Factual 

(b) Georgraphical

3 . Interpretation of Question 

4. Judgment and Evaluation 

5. Deduction 

6. Critical Attitude 

Investigators are well aware of the difficulty 
of devising tests which will measure only one factor. 

They are also aware of the impossibility of deducing 
the importance of the different factors from any one 
question. They use questions which primarily test one 
factor. This technique will be used in this investigation. 
Certain questions are designed to test definite facts and 
qualities• 

Each quality set forth will be tested against the 
results of certain questions. The questions on the exam¬ 
ination paper are divided according to the following factors:

Facts Suggested by Methods of Classification. 

(1) Although the group classification is not exactly 
the same ror both comparisons, the questions as 

a whole continue to discriminate the same for 
each comparison. 

(2) Only one question, question 4, moved from above 
average discrimination to lower than average 
discrimination. 

(3) With the exception of question 6, no question 
which achieved more than average discrimination 
elicited an above average response from any group. 

(4) With the exception of question 6 and question 8, 
which had an average response, the questions which 
did discriminate the most elicited a less than av¬ 
erage response. 

(5) The questions which failed to discriminate to any 
extent were mostly those to which the response had 
been above average. 

(6) Questions on the whole maintained their degree of 
difficulty for each group with the following ex¬ 
ceptions : 

(a) Question 5 achieved very little discrimin¬ 
ation. Group n C” averaged more than Group tt B n • 

(b) Question 7 discriminated 1.43 per cent for 
groups "D" and M C", and 11.73 per cent for

in percentage error is less than the difference between the 
percentages not attempted, which would tend to show that 
the M C M group was surer of its knowledge ghd not given to 
guessing as much as the students who constituted the 
M D M group. 

Furthermore, the extent of errors^ of both groups 


1. I have limited the use of this method to the questions 
dealing with geography. If the students were asked, to

as shown by the following examples indicated the super¬ 
iority of the n C M group. 

In item (5) which was the naming of the central 
mountains of Italy, the "D" group named them the Andes 
three times, the Alleghanies twice, the Urals five times, 
while the "C" group called them either the Alps or the 
Pyrenees. 

Item (20), which was the naming of the city of 
Tunis, was named Cairo ten times and Tripoli five times 
by the M D n group, while the n C M group named it Bizerte 
ten times. > 


(Continued from Page 1.6) 

to place the city of Edmonton on a map, and if one placed it 
at Bed 'Deer and another placed it where Calgary should be, I 
have assumed that the first student had superior knowledge 
to the latter, e.g. The students were asked to name the 
central range of mountains in Italy, the Apennines. The 
feet that one student called this range the Alleghanies , 
while another student named it the Pyrenees, would seem 
to indicate the latter student had superior knowledge because 
as measured in miles, his error is less. Although the impend' 
erable of guessing entered the calculations here, the trend, 
as I noted the errors, seemed to indicate that the extent of 
error of the “D” groupXgreater than that

This part of the question was better answered and 
thus less difficult than the others. It should be noted 
that it discriminated belter than the more difficult parts 
of the question. The greater percentage error of the "D” 
group reveals a lack of detailed knowledge of the actual 
location of the fighting. 

The (c) -part of question one asked the students to 
locate three other places prominent in the news.

The tables on the following page show that items 
(a), (b), (k), and (m) discriminated the best. Three of 
these items, (a), (b), and (m), asked the students to 
identify military men of foreign powers. This tended to 
show that the ,, D 11 group's interest was not so broad as 
that of the f, C" group's. Item (k) asked the students to 
identify C. G. D. Roberts, a famous Canadian poet. This 
was an item which was not likely to be taught and we find 
the fc, C fct group superior in the field of general knowledge. 

Items (i) and (j) which asked the students to 
identify J. W. Dafoe and Sir Ernest MacMillan, are 
Canadian topics which were not well known by either group 
Knowledge of Canadian affairs is not a discriminating 
factor. An examination of the errors in identifying 
J 9 Wj> Dafoe showed that both groups named the famous 
Canadian editor as the doctor of the Quintuplets the 
same percentage of times as they identified him correctly 

The profile graph indicated that items either 
poorly answered or relatively well answered showed little 
or no discrimination.

definitions were given, of these, twelve had to be matched 
with the twelve terms listed. The response to this question 
was well above the average of the paper for each group, in

It is noted from the tables that the items with 

the poorest percentage attainment and the greatest per¬ 
centage error, i.e. (5),(7), and (10) are terms which were 
described rather than defined in our text. This would seem 
to indicate a lack of ability to generalize. Both groups 
were deficient in this ability but the "D" group was more 
deficient than the "C" group. The fact, that the answers 
to this question were on the whole better answered than 
the average for the paper, indicates that both groups 
found association of definitions and terms less difficult 
than the recall of specific detail. No doubt the per¬ 
centage attainment was affected by guessing, which this 
type of question tends to encourage. 

An examination of the errors in item (10) showed 
that 50 per cent of the students gave the number eleven as 
the answer. This would indicate that group "D" did not 
know the meaning of the word ,f franchise". This error was 
repeated by group "C" but by about 10 per cent of the students. 
In item (5), which asked for the definition of economic 
nationalism, many of the students chose definition (6). 

Tlsy seemed to feel that the word "economic n in the de¬ 
finition was a clue, which led to their choosing it as a 
definition of economic nationalism. Only one student in 
the groups studied missed the definition of inflation. 
Repetition, in this case, was an important factor in the 
achievement of both groups.

It is noticed that the greatest number in both 
groups chose the topic on Canadian Immigration. It was on 
this theme that each group received its highest mark. This, 
coupled with the fact that immigration is thoroughly- 
covered in high school social studies, would seem to in¬ 
dicate either a lack of ability to assimilate information 
which was not taught, or at least a lack of interest in 
social studies. The indication is that the reading done 
by either group was limited. As I checked the essays, 
two facts became apparent: 

(1) The !, C ,f group has a greater grasp of details. 

(2) These students tend to organize and develop 
their thougnts better. 

Question 9. - This question on fascism in Italy 
proved hard to evaluate because of the allotment of partial 
marks. The "D" group received 336.5 marks out of a possible 
1014 for a percentage attainment of 33.28, and the ,f C tf 
group received 323.5 marks out of a possible 741 for a per¬ 
centage of 45. The question discriminated well with a 
percentage discrimination of 11.72. The following table 
shows my attempt to evaluate the question quantitatively.

Question 11 , - This question was based on Lord 
Halifax’s speech in Toronto. Although a current event 
question, some of the answers demand an interpretation 
on the part of the students. The question differentiated 
between the two groups. Group n D” obtained 515.5 marks 
out of a possible 1404 for a percentage attainment of 
36.68 and the ”0" group obtained 501 marks out of a pos¬ 
sible 1026 for a percentage of 48.83.

The points of difference were: 

(1) Parts (e), (f) and (g), which demanded a know¬ 
ledge and an appreciation of the develop¬ 
ment of Canada, politically and economically, 
were poorly answered. Again, the deficiency of 
the students* knowledge of Canadian history is 
illustrated. 

(2) The (g) part of question eleven demanded a type 
of thinking, that of applying a generalization 
to a specific situation. The response showed 
the rt C” group to he superior to the W D" group. 

(3) Many students were unable to interpret 11(b); 
thus they named three countries of the British 
Commonwealth of Nations instead of United States, 
Russia and China. The "D" group did this ap¬ 
proximately twice as often (based on per cent) 

as did the "C n group, which would seem to indicate 
that in the ability to interpret the question 
the "C" students were superior to the "D** students.

This question achieved less than average response and 
it discriminated well between the two groups. The table on 
the following page shows that items: (a), (b) , (k) and (m) 
discriminated the best. In parts (a), (b) and Cm) the stud¬ 
ents were asked to identify military leaders of foreign powers, 
answers of which were not as likely to be learned in class 
as some of the others. This would tend to show that tr D n 
group *s interest field was not as broad and that n B n group’s 
core of general knowledge was superior. 

Parts (i) .and (j) of the question asked the students 
to identify J. W. Dafoe and Sir Earnest MacMillan who were

outstanding Canadians in the respective fields of journal¬

was poor which would indicate their knowledge of Canadian 
affairs was not a discriminating factor. An examination 











- 36 - 


of the errors in the part asking to identify J. W. Dafoe, 
showed that both groups named the famous Canadian editor 
as the doctor of the quintuplets about the same percentage 
of times as they identified him correctly* This is rather 
a sad commentary on what either these students or the news¬ 
papers of our country felt was important news. 

Question 3*- This question tested the students* 
knowledge of the history and geography of the Far East. 

To facilitate the comparison the results of this question 
are shown in three parts. The allotment of partial marks 
makes it very difficult to compute accurately the percentage 
error, thus, it has not been included in the following 
table. 

'i 

The (a) part of the question, which demanded a 
historical as well as a geographical knowledge of the Jap¬ 
anese Empire, found the ,f B M students definitely superior. 
Furthermore, discrimination was obtained by the extent of 
error, for the ,! B M group was much nearer the correct location 
when in error, than the M D M group was. 

The "B” group did much better than the ,, D n group in 
placing current names which were not likely to be taught. 

This seemed to indicate either a greater interest in current 
events or a realization of the need to know such places. 

Part (c) of the question attained the best dis¬ 
crimination, that of 27.3 per cent. The placing of the loca¬ 
tion of the then current attacks found the ,, B M group very

superior to both f, C tf and "D w while it failed to dif¬ 
ferentiate between the "D" and "C" groups. This indicated 
that the former students followed the events of the war 
much more closely than the latter did. 

Question 4. - This question tested the students 1 
knowledge of the cost of living during World War 1 as 
compared with World War 2. The question, as a whole, dis¬ 
criminated well but part (a) showed an exceptional dis¬ 
crimination of 45.12 per cent. The "D" group was aware of 
the increased cost of living and had a fair idea of the 
date at which the government imposed price ceilings but 
it had little knowledge of the amount of increase, while 
the n B M group were more aware of the percentage increase. 
The percentage discrimination indicated rather forcefully 
a greater awareness of the economic conditions of the 
day on the part of the "B ,f group.

sults indicated the following: 

(a) The application of a general statement to a 
specific situation which was necessary to answer 
the (a) part of the question found the f, B w 
group decidedly superior. 

(b) Neither group understood the basis of fascism 

too well although the "B" group did show superiority.

(c) The "B" group showed marked superiority in

Question 10, - This question tested the students’ 
knowledge of Canadian history. The first part tested 
their knowledge of the constitutional development of 
Canada and the second tested their knowledge of the con¬ 
tributions of important Canadian statesmen.

The following graphs show the group attainment for 
each part of the question. Although the question discrimi¬ 
nated well, the response was well below the average for 
each group on the paper as a whole. It showed the students 
had a poor background in Canadian history. On the whole

This was a current event question based on Lord 
Halifax’s speech in Toronto* The percentage discrimi¬ 
nation was 15.42; thus, the question differentiated well 
between the groups. Although it was based on current 
events some of the answers demanded an ability to inter¬ 
pret on the part of the student.

This question indicated the following: 

(1) Parts (e), (f) and (g) which demanded a know¬ 
ledge and an appreciation of the develop¬ 
ment of Canada politically and economically, 
were answered poorly. Again, the students 1 
deficiency in their knowledge of Canadian 
history was evident. 

(2) The (g) part of the question demanded a type 
of thinking, that of applying a generalization 
to a specific situation. Although both groups 
suffer from lack of this ability, the "B" 
group was definitely superior to the "C M group. 

(3) Question 11(b) demanded the ability to inter¬ 
pret in which the "B" group was superior to the 
"D" group. 

(4) Item (i) which called upon the faculty of judg¬ 
ment, i.e. the relating of two concepts, showed 
the M B" group far superior to the n D M group*

Question 3, - This question demands a knowledge 
of events and the geography of the Far East. For the 
sake of convenience this question is shown in its three 
parts; (a), (b) and (c). 

Because of the allotment of partial marks it is 
comparatively easy to show the relative achievement of 
each group, but very difficult to show accurately the 
percentage error. Thus, I shall show only complete error*

It will be noted that parts (a) and (b) of this 
question differentiated between the groups, while the (c) 
part which was based on the then current war fronts did 
not discriminate between the two groups. 

Part (a) question 3, which demanded historical 
as well as geographical knowledge of the Japanese Empire, 
found the ”C n group definitely superior. The extent of 
error in placing the Netherland East Indies on the map was 
typical of this part of the question. Twenty per cent of 
the M D” group called the Philippines the Netherland East 
Indies, and only four per cent of the ,f C ,? group made the 
same mistake. Two of the tT D" group named Thailand as the 
East Indies. Thus, the extent of error differentiated 
between the two groups. Even when in error the "C” group 
on the whole was much closer to locating the Netherlands 
East Indies correctly. 

It was surprising to note that only sixty-four per 
cent of the M D tf students and seventy-seven per cent of the 
"C ,f students could name Victoria correctly. After twelve 
years of study one would think that students could locate 
the capital of British Columbia. 

The "C" students were outstandingly better than the 
W D H students in locating the then current names of places 
in the news. Whether it is because of greater interest or

because they realize the necessity of such knowledge for 
an examination, the "C" group is far better posted than 
the "D" group. The place names which did not differentiate 
in the (b) part seem to be names most likely crammed for 
the test or those items which were too difficult. The 
following tendencies were noted: 

(1) The "C" students have better ability than the 
"D" group to recognize and locate regions of more general 
application. 

(2) The M C ,f group showed relatively better ability 
than the "D" group in locating the more detailed places of 
current interest. 

(3) Items either very well or poorly answered ac- 

* 

hieved relatively little discrimination between tf C n and 
f, D n groups. 

Question 12. - This question , which was based 
on the three major plans set forth to maintain world 
peace after World War 2, achieved a percentage discrimi¬ 
nation of 7.46. The response to this question was ap¬ 
proximately the same as the average response of each group. 

The graph on the following page indicated: 

(1) That only once did the "C" group fail below a 
pure chance score of 33 per cent. The n D tt group only 
surpassed the chance score in three items.

(2) Items (1), (6), and (8) scored outstanding

differentiation which would indicate that "C tf group was 
definitely superior in its knowledge of Culberston's plan. 

(3) Item (8) indicates that the ,f C" group was 
better grounded in names in the news. 

(4) Plans for world peace means less to the "D" 
students• 

There was evidence of much guessing. Some students 
in the "C M group placed the same name in the ten blanks 
thus assuring themselves of either 3 or 4 marks*

Question 1 achieved average discrimination. The 
"D" group was consistently inferior to the "B" group in 
its core of knowledge. Furthermore, the extent of error 
divides the two groups. The attempts of the n D M group to 
locate cities showed haphazard naming and the n B" group 
had a better idea of the general location of the cities. 

The (b) part of the question,which asked the 
students to show by means of a double line the present 
battle line in Italy, was better answered^and the other 
parts of the question achieved a better percentage dis¬ 
crimination. The differentiation of 20.4 per cent in 
error indicates that the ,f B ,f group; 1 s knowledge of the actual 
fighting front was much superior to the M D W group’s. 

The (c) part of the question achieved little dis¬ 
crimination as it was very difficult for both groups. 

Thus giving further indication of their lack of knowledge 
of the geography of Italy.

on the average than the other questions*indicates that both 
groups found association of definitions and terms less 
difficult than the recall of specific detail. No doubt the 
percentage attainment was affected by guessing which this 
type of questions tend3to encourage. 

Items (5), (7), and (10), economic nationalism, 
imperialism and cartel, which achieved the poorest per¬ 
centage attainment, were terms which were described rather 
than defined in our text. This would seem to indicate a 
lack of ability to generalize. While "B" group is superior 
to "D" group in this ability both were deficient in the 
ability to generalize. An examination of the errors in

choosing a definition for economic nationalism showed 
that many students chose definition (6), Although "B" 
group did not do this as often as the "D" group, they 
seemed to feel that the word "economic" in the definition 
would relate it to economic nationalism. Both groups 
were misled by what they thought was a clue.

The table for question 7 indicates that 

(1) The f, B" group had a greater knowledge of the 
political history of each country. 

(2) The "B" group had a superior knowledge of each 
country’s association with the League of Nations. 

(3) There lack of specific knowledge and a 

loose use of general terms by both groups. 

(4) Both groups had a superior knowledge of which 
party was in the ascendency in United States 
as compared to England. 

(5) Because of the limited space for answers, this 
question tested the ability of the groups to 
state their thoughts concisely. Both groups 
were deficient in this ability.

The essay question gave the students a choice of 
five topics on which to write. Although this question is 
used as the sole basis for the English mark on the paper, 

I have considered only the social studies’ achievement at 
this time. 

It is noted that both groups chose to write on 
’’Canadian Immigration” more often than any other topic. 

As this topic has been covered in the social studies course 
in high school, we can assume either that both groups lack 
the ability to assimilate information which was not taught 
or they lack an interest in the events of the day. As I 
checked the essays two other facts became apparent. 

(1) The ”B” group has a greater grasp of details. 

(2) These students tend to organize and develop 
their thoughts better.

QUESTIONS WITH BELOW AVERAGE DISCRIMINATION 
Groups "D" and ,f C w 

Question 4, - This question demanded a knowledge 
of the increased cost of living of World War 1 as com¬ 
pared with that of World War 2. Little discrimination 
in the core of knowledge of the two groups was evident. 

But the extent of error reveals a considerable difference. 
The "C" group seemed to have a much better idea of the 
comparative costs of living.

Errors 

(a) "D" group average 35 % error in its estimate. 

"C" group average 20 % error in its estimate. 

(b) "D" group had an average error of 1.5 years. 

”C" group had an rverage error of 1 year. 

Question 5 proved that our students, whether of a 
"D" or ”0" standard, were efficient at reading the type 
of graph which was on the paper. "C” groups percentage 
attainment was 95.13, and ’’D” group’s percentage at¬ 
tainment was 93.43. The percentage discrimination was 
1.70. Questions which were found easy by both groups 
usually failed to discriminate between them. 

Question 7. - This question asked for a com¬ 
parison of certain events in England and United States 
since World War 1. The ”D” group’s average percentage 
attainment was 45.79 per cent. Thus the percentage 
discrimination of 1.43 indicated this question as a whole 
failed to discriminate between the two groups. 

The two graphs following show in detail the 
comparative attainment of the two groups. It is noticed 
that items (f) and (g) discriminated best. Item (f) 
requires an answer not likely to be taught, indicating 
a knowledge of political trends of the past few years.

countries toward the League of Nations, was covered in 
the course. As would be expected the "C" group absorbed 
more of the taught information than the "D" group. 

A further study of the statistics and the an¬ 
swers indicate that: 

(1) There is a lack of specific knowledge and a 
loose use of general terms by both groups. 

(2) Both groups had a better knowledge of political 
parties and trends in the United States 

than in England. 

(3) The greatest number of marks for each group 
was obtained for partially correct answers. 

This denotes a lack of specific Knowledge. 

(4) In part (d) 27 students had the same answer 
for both the United States and England. This 
indicates a very scanty knowledge of the poli¬ 
tical parties of each country. 

(5) Because of the limited space for answers this 
question tested the ability of the groups to 
state their thoughts concisely. Both were 
deficient in this ability. 

Question 13. - This question tested the students’ 
knowledge of the purpose and details of post-war recon¬ 
struction. The percentage attainment of the n D n group 
and "C" group was 54.62 and 60.35 respectively. The

percentage discrimination was 5,73, Thus, this question 
follows the usual pattern of the ones in which, if the ac¬ 
hievement is above average, the discrimination is below 
average. 

ihe question should ha.ve been easy as post-war 
reconstruction plans were much discussed at this time. 
However, part (a) of the question w i hich asked the students 
to state the underlying purposes of a reconstruction 
program was not as well answered by either group as part 
(b) which asked them for specific detail of some pro¬ 
gram. In other words, part (a) tested the ability of the 
groups to generalize to a certain extent and this part of 
the question was not as well answered as the part of the 
question wnich demanded the recall of facts. This would 
seem to indicate that both groups found generalizations 
more difficult than recall of details. The ft C n group had 
the ability of generalization to a greater degree than 
the u D n group had. 

Question 14. - This question was a multiple- 
choice one dealing with the possible post-war situation 
in Europe. The response of both groups was above average 
but discrimination was below average.

As this question does not penalize for quessing 
and as every one attempted each part of the question it 
is safe to assume that this type of question results in 
a considerable amount oi guessing. 

The graph on the following page shows that the 
two parts of the question which had the lowest response 
were best able to discriminate between the two groups. 
Fifty per cent of the T, D" group chose item (a) as the 
answer which stated Germany should have a democracy 
patterned after our own, indicating that they had ex¬ 
treme faith in our type of democratic government but 
lacked the tolerance necessary to allow the German people 
to pattern a democratic government according to its needs. 
Both "C w and "D" students were deficient in tolerance or 
the necessary judgment to understand the need of adapting 
institutions to people rather than trying to mould people 
to suit institutions. 

The fifth part of question 14 asked what type 
of organization should be formed in Europe after the war 
or should the countries be allowed to go back to the 
situation as before the war. The answers of the students 
seemed to indicate that they did not appreciate fully the 
need of adjusting the political machinery to the economic 
reality of one world. 

In regard to the two above items ,f C M group showed 
considerably better judgment than the "D" group.

QUESTIONS WITH BELOW AVERAGE DISCRIMINATION 

Groups "D" and "B” 

Question 5, - This question proved that students 
of both groups were efficient at reading the type of 
graph which was on the paper. The percentage attainment 
of the "D" group and "B" group was 93.43 and 93.75 res¬ 
pectively. The percentage discrimination was .32. The 
results of this question gave further evidence that "easy" 
questions do not discriminate. The main purpose of such 
a question besides checking on the students ability to 
read graphs would seem to be to provide marks which would 
help raise the attainment of every student. 

The graph on page 67 shows the comparative at¬ 
tainment for each item. 

Question 12. - This question asked the students 
to identify ten statements that were quoted from the 
peace plans of Streit, Stassen and Culbertson. Neither 
the response nor the discrimination achieved by this 
question was equal to the average for the paper. The 
percentage achievement of "D" and "B" groups was 42.18 
and 48.12 respectively. The percentage discrimination 


was 5.94

The graph on the following page indicates: 

• (1) That only once did the ”B W group fall below 

a pure chance score of 33 per cent. The 
"D" group surpassed the chance score on only 
five of the items. 

(2) That items (1) and (6) scored outstanding 
differentiation which would indicate that the 
"B" group was definitely superior in its 
knowledge of Culbertson’s plan. 

(3) That plans for world peace meant less to the 
”D” students. 

There was a great deal of guessing on this 
question as some students from both groups named one of 
the men throughout, thus assuring themselves of either 
3 or 4 marks. 

Question 13. - This question tested the students’ 
knowledge of the purpose and the details of post-war re¬ 
construction. The percentage attainment of the ”D tT group 
and ”B W group was 54.62 and 60.94. The percentage dis¬ 
crimination was 6.32. Thus, this question follows the 
usual pattern of the ones in which, if the achievement is 
above average, the discrimination is below average. 

The question should have presented little dif¬ 
ficulty as post-war reconstruction plans were much dis¬ 
cussed at this time. However, part (a) of the question,

which asked the students to state the underlying pur¬ 
poses or a reconstruction program was not as well answered 
by either group as part (b) which asked them for specific 
detail of some program. In other words, part (a) tested 
the ability of the groups to generalize to a certain ex¬ 
tent and this part of the question was not as well an¬ 
swered as the part of the question which demanded the 
recall of facts. This would seem to indicate that both 
groups found generalization more difficult than recall of 
details. The "B" group had knowledge of more details 
and had the ability of generalization to a greater degree 
than the "D" group.

Question 14 was a “multiple choice”one dealing 
with the possible post-war situation in Europe. The 
response of both groups was above average and the dis¬ 
crimination was below average. 

The table shows that the two parts (4) and (6) 
of the/piestion, which had the lowest response, were best 
able to discriminate between the two groups. 

Both "B" and n D w group had a common error in 
their answer to the fourth part of the question. They 
felt that Germany should have a democracy patterned after 
ours rather than a democratic organization which would 
meet the needs of the German people. The errors in the 
answer to the fifth part of the question revealed that 
the students in neither group appreciated the need of 
adjusting themselves to the reality that the apparent 
size of the world has shrunk.

CHAPTER IX 


THE QUALITATIVE DATA 

For the purpose of this part of the investigation 
the three groups "D", "C" and "B" will be considered 
together. This procedure will give us a better picture 
of the increased growth of intelligence as evidenced by 
the responses of eadh group* 

The difficulties of such a study have been noted 
in the introduction* The limitations of the examination 
questions in measuring differences in the quality of think¬ 
ing have been stressed, and they qualify the definiteness of 
the investigator's conclusions. However, the committee 
and the investigator have accepted Thurstone’s factoral 
theory of intelligence, 1 ' as a basis for proceeding with 
this investigation. 

It may be pointed out here that we have not 
listed all the factors, as there are some which the an¬ 
swers to the questions of this paper are unable to dis¬ 
cern. We have picked factors which we felt could be dis¬ 
cerned by the questions on the paper. Thus there is no 
pretense of a complete study of mental abilities or 
quality of thinking. The committee and the investigator

have agreed that the following list of questions would 
best show eertain mental abilities,,

Concept s Psychologically, a concept may be defined as 
an experience built up from past experiences, in which 
the relatively universal, in those experiences, becomes 
emphasized and the particular eliminated, £hus, the 
choice of correct definitions which is asked for in 
question six would offer a basis to ascertain if there is 
a steady growth in this ability as we go higher in the 
gradings. The tables on the following page would seem to 
indicate such a trend. n C n and M B n groups are decidedly 
superior to M D M group,' and ,! B n is only slightly superior 
to "C". 

The definitions of economic nationalism, imperial¬ 
ism, and cartel, items (5)? (7)? and (10) respectively, on 
the tables, are those which obtained the most discriminat¬ 
ion. These items are terms which are described rather than de 
fined in our text^, which would seem to indicate that these

74 


groups found generalizing or the forming of concepts 
difficult. The percentage discrimination between the 
groups shows improvement in this ability as we proceed 
from "D" to "B" category.

Interpretation. - Question 11(b), which asked 
the students to name three of the great powers, besides 
the British Commonwealth of Nations, upon which the peace 
of the world depends, should have been answered by- 
naming Russia, United States and China, but was often 
answered by naming three Commonwealth Nations, Thus, 
the attainment in this question depended upon the ability 
to interpret. The results were as follows:

fewer times (in per cent) than did the "C" group. This 
would seem to indicate that the ability to interpret is 
related directly to the student’s attainment. Thus, 

"B T * group is superior to "C” group, and the ”C" group is 
superior to the ,f D" group in the mental ability of inter¬ 
pretation. 

Judgment and Evaluation. - Question 10(a) asked 
the contribution of four acts to the constitutional 
development of Canada. An evaluation or judgment was 
necessary to properly assess their effect on the develop¬ 
ment of Canada.

the mental ability of evaluation. The table of the in¬

to the "D" group in judgment. There is little evidence

A steady growth in the ability of deductive 


reasoning is indicated by the above table. M B M students 
are superior to the n C" students, and the rt C" students 
to the TT D tf students in the ability to apply a generalization 
to a concrete situation. 

Critical Attitude. - This attitude is one of the 
necessary end-results of the teaching of social studies. 

If this ability is not developed the student lacks the 
equipment to be an intelligent citizen of democratic 
society. Question 14 asks for the best course of action 
which should be ta^en in post war Europe. Although this i§ 

a''multiple choice** question in which guessing plays a part in 
the attainment of the student, it does provide a basis for

Thus each group’s achievement was above the average. 
There is little evidence to assume that tt B" group has 
developed or that it has this ability to a greater degree 
than the ”0" group. Parts (4) and (5) have discriminated 
well between T, D ,f and "C". Either these parts demanded 
answers which are not liKely to be taught, or else the 
choice here is not as obvious as in the other parts of 
the question, indicating that the critical ability of 
the "C" group is superior to the ”D" group’s. However, 
there is not evidence enough of the development of a 
critical attitude for the teachers of social studies to 
feel satisfied with the result of their instruction.

CHAPTER X 
ENGLISH MARKS 

The objective type of test, that was given in 
Social Studies 3, was designed primarily to test Know¬ 
ledge in the field of social studies. However, the mark 
in English, which was derived solely from question 8, ac¬ 
counted for 18.8 per cent of the total mark and it played 
an important part in grouping the students. This is true 
of the f, sampling ,f which I received; whether or not it is 
true of all the Social Studies 3 papers could only be 
ascertained by further research. The question then arises: 
Is this fact desirable even if it were true only of the 
border line cases which I have studied? 

The question then is: Was there any correlation 
between the English mark and the social studies attain¬ 
ment? If the English mark gives the student approximately 
the same percentage as the social studies mark then its 
effect would be no more than that of having another social 
studies question on the paper.

TABLE XL1-CONTINUED 

Percentage 

Discrimination 14.00 - 10.50 3.45 

The above table reveals a lack oT consistency in 
the discrimination achieved by the English mark. While 
it discriminated between "D" and "C" well, the discrimi¬ 
nation between the "B" and the "C" group was negative. 

In other words the "C" students were superior to the "B" 
students, which is the opposite to that which we would 
expect. Should the mark for English be included in the 
grading of a student in social studies when such un¬ 
reliability is indicated? 

The correlation between attainment on the Social 
Studies 3 paper and the English mark was negative if onlyy6ne 
group was considered. This would seem to indicate that 
the students who knew most social studies suffered from 
the inclusion of the English mark, and the students who 
knew the least social studies benefitted by the inclusion 
of the English mark. 

however, this apparent negative trend is explained 
by the "two factor effect”. Whenever two factors are used 
in reaching a limit, within this limit, the greater one 
factor becomes, the less the other must become. In grouping 
the students, the demarcation line separating the "D" and 
"C" groups fell between 100 and 99. Thus if a "D" student 
had attained 90 marks in Social Studies 3, he could make 
only 9 marks in English and still remain

a "D" student; likewise a student who had attained 95 
marks in Social Studies 3 could make only 4 marks in 
English and still remain a "D" student* 

Thus the generalization, that the more social studies 
the student knew the less he would receive for his English 
mark, is not compatible with the evidence. The correlation 
table involving the three groups illustrated the in¬ 
validity of the above statement. The indications were 
that there was no correlation between the English mark and 
the social studies mark as displayed on the essay questions. 

Conclusions drawn from the study of the English 
attainment of the students: 

(1) The discrimination achieved by the English 
mark was not consistent. It differentiated between groups 
n D" and "C M but it showed the "C" group superior to the 
,r B n group. 

|2) The correlation between the English mark and 
the attainment on the essay is approximately zero. Thus, 
there is little or no relation between the students* 
ability to express themselves and the mark obtained on 
the eighth question. 

(3) The correlation between the English mark and 
the attainment on the Social Studies 3 paper is approximately 


zero

(4) Table 1 shows that 16 students who received 
"B w standing knew as little or less Social Studies 3 
than those in the highest ranking of the "C" group. As 
"B" standing grants university entrance, is the ability 
to express yourself the basis to disallow some students 
and give the go-ahead sign to others, or should the basis 
be the core of knowledge and the quality of thinking?

CHAPTER XI 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
For the purposes of this study the questions 
included in the test were grouped according to a plan which 
would seem to present more clearly the quantitative and 
qualitative differences demonstrated by the M D" and the M C" 
and the "D" and the M B n groups. The most valuable group of 
questions for this particular study was that which 
most markedly discriminated between the groups. The 
second grouping of questions was made, which included those 
items in which approximately average discrimination was 
achieved. A third group of questions included those items 
which achieved less than average discrimination. The 
basis of the above comparative grouping of questions was 
the average discrimination achieved by the entire paper. 

The English mark was excluded in the groupings and was 
treated separately. 

The method of grouping brought to light a number 
of facts: 

(1) The questions which achieved the greatest dis¬ 
crimination between the M D M and M C U students were those 
which proved most difficult. In five out of the seven 
questions in this group the response of both "D" and ’’C 11 
groups was below their average achievement on the entire 
paper. 

(2) Only question 6, whose attainment could have been 
affected by guessing, elicited an above average response 


' 0 -- 



- 91 - 


from either the "D" or M C M group* 

( 3 ) The questions which achieved the greatest dis¬ 
crimination between the M D M and "B" students were those 
which were the most difficult. The seven questions in¬ 
cluded in this group elicited less than an average response 
from both groups. 

(4) The response, to the questions which achieved 
average discrimination, was average or better. 

(5) In the comparison of the M D M and M C" groups 
five questions achieved less than average discrimination. 

One of these proved difficult for both groups while on 
the other hand, three of the remaining questions had a 
better than average response. 

( 6 ) In the comparison between the "D M and the "B" 
groups, four questions attained less than average discrimin¬ 
ation. Three of these had an above average response while 
the fourth had a less than average response. 

(7) It appeared that, generally speaking, those 
questions which were difficult for one group were diff¬ 
icult for the other two groups. The same follows for 
the less difficult questions. 

GROUP 1 

"C" and M D" Students 

Those questions which achieved greatest dis¬ 
crimination were listed under Group 1. The first map 
question was included in this group. The items in this

question which required the more exact and detailed 
knowledge proved difVicult for both groups, while the 
items which required a more general knowledge proved less 
difficult and achieved greater discrimination. Items 
which were very difficult or presented relatively little 
difficulty achieved least discrimination. Where items 
were based on historical knowledge (items which should 
have been learned in previous courses) the "C" students 
were superior and greater discrimination was achieved. It 
appears, while the "C" students shewed more ability in the 
type of recall demanded in this type of question, they 
seemed to find the same items difficult. 

A second question in this group asked for the 
statement of an important fact connected with the name of 
a prominent person. In this question the n C" students 
showed a greater tendency to state facts than the tf D rt 
students. A demand for specific information appears to 
make for lower achievement by both groups but especially 
for students of the "D" group. 

A further question of Group 1 asked the students 
to match definitions with terms. Both groups of students 
found association of definitions relatively easier than 
recall of detail. Both the "C" and "D" students were 
misled by what they considered clues. However, the con¬ 
ceptual knowledge of the "C" group was superior to the "D" 


group

The essay question was included in Group 1. 

The ’’C" Students showed a more detailed and a greater 
general knowledge and a better ability to organize this 
knowledge than the ”D” group. 

A further question of Group 1 dealt with historical 
detail and general knowledge of conditions in pre-war 
Italy. Statements of facts were required and the answers 
had a tendency to be vague and general. However, the 
"C" students showed a superior grasp of details and a 
better ability to generalize than the "D” students. Both 
groups had a rather poor understanding of the basis of 
Fascism. This type of question which demanded specific 
knowledge and ability to generalize proved difficult for 
both groups of students, but it was relatively more dif¬ 
ficult for the ”D*’ than the’^C" students. 

The question which concerned itself with Canadian 
history was listed under Group 1. The demand for specific 
knowledge and detail made this question difficult for both 
groups. The best knownitems achieved the best discrimi¬ 
nation. While both groups’ knowledge of Canadian History 
was poor the "C M group had a broader and more detailed 
grasp of important men and events in the development of 
Canada. 

One of the better questions in Group 1 was the 
one which dealt with Lord Halifax’s proposal for the 
assumption of more responsibility for the members of the 
British Commonwealth of Nations. Both groups lacked an

appreciation of the reasons for Canada’s political and 
economic development and the implications of Halifax’s 
proposals. Both groups suffered when specific detail was 
called for. The ”0” students showed superiority in the 
interpretation of statements and in the application of 
inferences to specific problems. ”D” and ”C” students 
showed relative poor ability to draw inferences from 
given facts. 

GROUP 1 

”D” and ”B” students 

The first question in this group asked the 
students to identify important men in the news. The "B” 
students showed a greater ability to state facts and a 
wider field of knowledge than the ”D T ’ students. Further¬ 
more the type and extent of error found the ”B” group 
superior. The demand of this question for specific in¬ 
formation appeared to cause lower achievement by both 
groups but especially for the "D” group. 

A further question of Group 1 demanded historical 
and geographical knowledge of the Far East. The items 
which called f orfdetailed information had the poorest 
response but showed the ”B" students maintaining their 
superiority. The items which called for historical as 
well as geographical knowledge showed the ”B Tt students 
markedly superior.

cost of living in Canada after World War 1 as compared 
to the cost of living after World War 2. The exacting 
answers of this question appeared to cause a poorer than 
average response. The "B" group showed a superior know¬ 
ledge of the economic conditions of Canada. 

A further question of Croup 1 dealt with historical 
detail and general knowledge of conditions in pre-war 
Italy. Statements of facts were required and the an¬ 
swers had a tendency to be vague and general. However 
the "B" students showed a superior grasp of details and 
a better ability to generalize than the ff D n students. 

The "B" students showed superiority in the ability to 
relate knowledge of specific details to a general pro¬ 
blem. This type of question,which demanded specific 
knowledge and ability to generalize,proved difficult for 
both groups of students, but it was relatively more 
difficult for the "D" than the "C" students. 

The question dealing with Canadian history was 
listed under this group. Both groups were deficient in 
their knowledge core. The recency of the event seemed 
to increase the percentage attainment of both groups. 

The "B" group had a better appreciation of the men and 
of the events which helped to shape Canadian history 0 

The last question in this group dealt with Lord 
Halifax’s proposals regarding the acceptance by Canada 
of more responsibility as a member of the British Com¬ 
monwealth of Nations. The items, which demanded the

application of a generalization to a speciric situation, 
showed that both groups suffered from lack of this ability 
and that the M D M group suffered more than the "B" group. 

The items, which demanded interpretation and judgment 
continued to show the superiority of the f, B M students. 

GROUP 2 

"D" and "C” Students 

Question* which were listed under Group 2, ac¬ 
hieved approximately average discrimination. The first 
question in Group 2 dealt with the history and geography 
of the historical development of Japan, found the "C" 
group definitely superior. The "C n students had better 
ability than the "D" students to locate regions of more 
general application and the more detailed places of 
current interest. 

A further question in this group asked the students 
to identify statements taken from Streit’s, Stassen’s 
and Culbertson’s peace plans. Tt C” students had superior 
ability in recognition of details connected with the 
plans and the plans for world peace were more meaningful 
to them. 

GROUP 2 

"D" and "B" Students 

The question dealing with the locating of place 
names important in the Italian war theatre achieved average 
discrimination between Group "D" and Group "B" students. 





97 


The "B" students showed a superior general knowledge by 
always surpassing the "D ,f students in their response to 
items which were not likely taught* The locating 
of general regions, showed the marked superiority of the 
"B" students in this type of recall. Furthermore the 
mistakes or errors made by the "B" students showed them 
to be much closer to the correct location than the "C" 
students were. This question indicated that the M B” students 
followed the actual events of the war more closely than 
the "D" students. 

The next question listed under Group 2 asked for 
the matching of terms and definitions. The better than 
average response suggests that both groups of students 
found association of terms and definitions easier than 
recall of specific detail. Terms which were not likely 
to be defined in the course achieved a relatively poor 
response. Hence, although the n B ft students were superior 
to the "D" students in the ability to generalize, the 
responses of both groups showed a deficiency in this ability. 

A further question dealing with history of Britain 
and of the United States showed that both groups were given 
to guessing. The answers on the whole were vague. The 
greater the number of facts demanded by any part of the 
question the greater the discrimination between the groups. 

The last question listed under this group was the 
essay one. Both groups found this relatively easier than 
the questions which required specific detailed knowledge. 

The tf B" group showed a greater grasp of detail and a better

ability to organize that detail. Both groups favored 
topics which re uired the writing of memorized detail rather 
then those which required an evaluation of events, ./hen 
this type of topic was chosen attainment was lower. 

GROUP 3* 

M D M and "C" Students 

The questions of Group 3 were those which achieved 
less than average discrimination. The two graph questions 
were included in this group. In the one question which 
demanded a detailed knowledge the attainment was low for 
both groups. In the other, which required the reading of 
the graph and where the information was given, the attain¬ 
ment was high. The graph question which required recall of 
details achieved greater discrimination than the one which 
required only the ability to read. 

A further question in this group dealt with post¬ 
war planning. The "C" students showed better ability ih 
stating and illustrating an idea. They also showed a 
better understanding of the purpose and need of post-war 
reconstruction. 

The last question in this group was a "multiple 
choice" type dealing with the probable post-war situation 
in Europe. Both groups seemed to possess the knowledge 
and understanding to make correct choices which would be 
in accord with our democratic principles. However, 
guessing and working from "clues" was evident. It would 
appear then, that both groups have better attainment where

knowledge of details or a factual statement was not 
necessary. 


GROUP 3 

"D" and "B" Students 

This grouping included four questions which failed 
to attain average discrimination. The first question, 
which demanded the ability to read a graph was comparatively 
easy and indicated no difrerences between the groups. 

The second question was too difficult and failed to show 
any outstanding differences. However the "B" students 
on the whole had a better understanding of the peace plans. 

A further question in this group was the one on 
post-war reconstruction. The part of the question which 
asked for more than one detail differentiated the best, 
rhe "B" group students demonstrated that they could state 
facts more concisely, and that they could expand an idea 
to better advantage than the "D" group students. 

The last question in this group was the "multiple 
choice" one dealing with the post-war situation in Europe. 
Both groups* response was above average and the students 
appeared to have a fair knowledge of our democratic 
principles. However, the item with the least obvious 
answer, and which contained no clue found both groups 
deficient in an appreciation of the fact that institutions 
are made and that they must be adapted to the needs of 
man rather than man moulded to suit the institution. In 
this question the most difficult items achieved the best 


discrimination

QUALITATIVE DATA 

An increase in the ability to form a concept or 
to generalize is evidenced as one examines the responses 
of the respective gradings of the students. The W B" and 
"C" student are definitely superior to the W D" student. 
There is little evidence of any distinction between the 
"C" and ,f B TI student in this ability. 

Factual memory or the ability to recall specific 
detail would seem to me to be very important as it is 
from this source that we form our generalizations, draw 
our conclusions and form our judgments. There was a 
marked increase in this ability. The "B ,f and "C" student 
considerably better at th^s type of recall than the n D w 
student. The M B M student was also superior to the "C" 
student. 

Geographical memory follows much the same pattern. 
The "C n student was superior to the ft ^ w student, while the 
”8” student was definitely superior to both the n D" and 
"C" student. 

The mental factor of interpretation and the ability 
to evaluate are found in an increasing degree as we go 
higher in the gradings of the students. 

From this study, it would appear that the out¬ 
standing qualitative difference was in the ability of 
deduction. The difference between the "C" and n D" student 
was approximately the same as the difference between the 
”0” and "B" students. The percentage discrimination was

large in both cases. 

The question, which was analysed in an attempt 
to see the relative standing of the three groups in 
critical ability, was a multiple choice" one. As 
these questions tend to promote guessing and answering 
from clues it is especially difficult to estimate how 
much of this ability each group has but it appeared 
that the "B" student has more than the "C" student 
who in turn has more than the "D" student. 

The English Mark 

The English mark was based on the essay question. 
While this mark, in many cases, was the only difference 
between students of the different groupings, there was 
little or no correlation between the mark and either the 
social studies attainment on the essay question or the 
social studies attainment of the whole paper. 

General Remarks 

The findings of the study would seem to indicate 
the following points. 

(l) The classification of questions according to 
the percentage response of the students indicated that, 
on the whole, the more difficult questions on the 1944 
social Studies 3 paper discriminated the best. However, 
it must be realized that questions which were too difficult 


10 


or for which the average response was too far below the 
response average for the paper, those questions failed to 
discriminate. On the other hand, questions which were too 
easy failed to discriminate as they did not give the better 
students an opportunity to show their superior knowledge. 

(2) The knowledge of Canadian history was very 
inadequate. 

( 3 ) ‘The knowledge of the three groups appeared to 
be vague and unrelated. 

(4) All groups did better than average on the essay 
question. 

( 5 ) Questions such as "multiple choice" and "matching" 
ones, in which the student did not have to write his ideas, 
achieved a higher attainment, not only this, but they 
encouraged guessing. 

(6) The students, whose papers I checked, appeared 
to have a superficial knowledge of events. Although in 
many cases they had memorized certain facts they seemed uni- 
aware of the causal nature of events. 

It would seem to the investigator, that one of 
the necessary end-results of Social Studies 3 instruction, 
would be the ability to evaluate and form judgments concern¬ 
ing certain happenings. This ability is needed especially 
in a democratic society. The ability to generalize or 
relate concepts forms the basis of judgment . The knowledge
