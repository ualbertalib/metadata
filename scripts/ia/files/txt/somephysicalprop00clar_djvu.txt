SOME PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALBERTA COAL 


GENERAL INTRODUCTION 

Coal research of any kind may be broadly divided into two fields - 
one concerning the physical properties of the coal, such as its friability, 
its specific gravity, the melting point of the ash, etc; and the other 
concerning its chemical properties, such as its chemical composition, 
its reaction with different reagents, and so forth* And in between these 
extremes, there is a field of investigation which is concerned with 
phenomena which are manifestations of both the physical and chemical 
properties of the coal, such as its moisture holding capacity, and its 
ignition temperature* 

Since 1921 the Research Council of Alberta has devoted itself to a 
study of Alberta coals along many of these lines - to pursue all the 
branches of the study is obviously impossible. Among the subjects which 
have been investigated during these years might be mentioned; the in¬ 
flammability of coal and coal dusts, the fusibility of coal ash, oxidation 
and spontaneous combustion, wetting of coal, specific gravity, specific 
surface, and many others (1). Satisfactory studies in many of these sub¬ 
jects have been hindered by the lack of a suitable means to determine 
particle size and surface area* The recent work of J. Oberholtzer (2) in 
these laboratories on such measurements has made it possible for renewed

and more satisfactory investigations to be pursued, and some of these 
will be considered in this paper* 

The first part of the work concerns a purely physical property of 
coal, its weathering ability* Here an attempt is made to find a suitable 
test to measure this property in a coal* 

The second part of the work is the result of a problem which started 
out fairly simply, as a result of the first investigation, but which later 
became more inclusive# Originally, a comparative weathering test of Ed¬ 
monton and Drumheller coals was undertaken, at the request of a coal 
operator, and three samples from each area were obtained and tested* 
However, Mr* W. A* Lang questioned the influence of particle size upon 
the results of the various routine and other determinations made upon 
coal* It was therefore decided to investigate some of the aspects of this 
problem, while doing the weathering tests, since these samples, besides 
being available at the time, were suitable for such studies* 

Both of these studies - the accelerated weathering tests, and the 
study of the influence of particle size - have a very important bearing 
on fuel technology, and this relationship has been kept in mind during 
the progress of the work described* 

In order to avoid any confusion, it might be here mentioned that 
in any reference to the rank of a coal, the new classification according 
to A.S.T*M* designation D 388-38 is used*

I 

THE ACCELERATED WEATHERING TEST FOR COAL. 

A* Introduc tion . 

When a low rank coal is exposed to the effects of the weather, it 
shows a tendency to disintegrate, or slack* Lignite slacks very readily 
on exposure to weathering conditions, and sub-bituminous coals are also 
affected this way, but to a lesser extent* High rank coals are resistant 
to weather* 

All low rank coals contain relatively large amounts of moisture, but 
as this moisture is not firmly held the coal may dry when exposed* On drying, 
some shrinkage takes place* On subsequent wetting the piece expands again, 
but does not attain the same size which it originally had. This process 
of drying and wetting, shrinkage and expansion, may go on a number of times. 

In the process of drying, moisture is lost from the surface of the 
coal. There is then a gradual drift of moisture from the interior to the 
surface. If the amount lost through surface evaporation is greater than 
the amount replaced from the interior of the lump, there is a greater 
shrinkage at the surface than in the interior. This sets up stresses in 
the lump, which result in its disintegration. Similarly, if a piece of 
dried coal is exposed to moist conditions, the surface may take up mois¬ 
ture faster than it will diffuse into the middle of the lump. This re¬ 
sults in a greater swelling at the surface than in the interior, and 
again there are resultant stresses and consequent breakage. In the process 
of weathering, this alternate wetting and drying is undergone with con¬ 
tinued disintegration*

This effect has great practical significance* Lump coal brings a 
higher price than fines* A dealer, obviously, does not want to sell as 
fines the coal he bought and paid for as lump* He should therefore know 
something of the weathering properties of his commodity - whether it can 
be stored in the open, in an open shed, in a closed bin, or whether it 
will have to be taken directly to the consumer from the car* 

Also, the more readily a coal slacks, the greater is its tendency 
to ignite spontaneously, because of' the greater surface exposed, and the 
more care must be exercised in shipment and storage* 

Besides the problem of spontaneous ignition, the effects of the 
size degradation accompanying the slacking introduce further difficulties* 
For most uses, coal must be fairly closely sized, and unless something is 
known of its weathering properties, it is impossible to predict the state 
of a shipment of coal by the time that it reaches the consumer, after 
handling and storage, even though the shipper may have sized it to the 
required specifications* 

For example, in the operation of gas producers, (and the problems 
related to this process may become very important under the present war¬ 
time economy) the size of the feed must be very closely controlled. As 
an illustration, the British Coal and Carbonisation Industries specify 
that for transport producer gas installations, the feed shall not exceed 
3/4”, nor be less than l/8” in size (3). Another, more familiar case 
where close sizing is required, is in the domestic stoker* 

All of these considerations become especially important at the present 
time, in view of the general request that consumers purchase their coal 
during the summer and store it till needed, in order to even out the demand*

It is tedious to get a test of weathering by actual exposure to 
weather, and difficult or impossible to standardise such a test* A 
laboratory "accelerated weathering" test was therefore devised* Such a 
test should determine, rapidly and conveniently, the ability of a coal 
to stand up under the conditions which may be imposed on it during 
handling and storage due to these weathering effects* Such a test has a 
two-fold purpose* Firstly, it is necessary for the classification of 
certain coals* Secondly, it gives a means of comparing the weathering 
ability of different coals* These problems will be separately discussed 
under appropriate headings* 

It should be noted that there is some ambiguity concerning the 
term "weathering"* Fieldner and Selvig, who did some of the first work 
on this problem, define a weathering coal as one which breaks up under 
disintegrating influences* Unless, however, one is familiar with the 
terminology, the term "weathering" is very apt to bring to mind the 
opposite meaning - i*e. that the coal resists these disintegrating in¬ 
fluences. The term "storage ability" suggested by Stansfield, is worthy 
of consideration for its lack of ambiguity. 

B* Method of Test . 

Fieldner and Selvig, of the U. S* Bureau of Mines, did some early 
work on the subject about 1928 (4). Originally, they dried the coal sample 
over concentrated sulfuric acid till it lost no more moisture, and then 
they exposed it to 100^ relative humidity till there was no more gain in 
weight* This cycle took a long time, so they evolved a more rapid method 
for the determination* As the test was finally evolved the procedure was 


as follows:

About 500 grams of coal, as lumps of approximately 1 1/4” cube, 
were used for the test. The sample was subjected to a blank sieving, and 
the undersize and oversize weighed. (The sieve had 0.263” square openings). 
The oversize was then dried at 30-35°C for about 24 hours, in a current of 
air. The sample was then cooled, immersed in water, drained, and dried 
again for 24 hours as before. It was then screened as in the blank 
screening, and the undersize and oversize weighed. The percentage under¬ 
size in the blank screening was subtracted from the percentage undersize 
in the weathered sample, and the result termed the slacking index. A later 
modification of this test suggested the use of a duplicate sample for the 
blank instead of using the one sample for the whole run. 

A great weakness in this test was the fact that there was no control 
of humidity of the air used for drying the coal* This humidity was found 
to have a very definite effect on the determined weathering index - see 
Stansfield and Gilbart (5). They suggested a modification of the test to 
specify that the drying air should have a definite relative humidity, with 
the further suggestion that this value be somewhere in between 20^ and 40^ 
relative humidity. The A.S.T.M* specification now requires that the 
drying air have a relative humidity of between 30 and 35?o. 

The Accelerated Weathering Test and Coal Glassification. 

(a) Classification . With the wide variety of present day uses for 
coal, there has to be some general means for its classification in order 
to avoid different terminology in different parts of the continent and- 
consequent misunderstandings. 

According to the method of classification of coal by rank, adopted 
by the National Research Council and the Department of Mines and Resources 
at Ottawa (A.S.T.M. specification D 388-38), a coal may be classed either

as one of three varieties of "High Volatile C Bituminous” or as "Sub- 
bituifiinous A” depending on its weathering properties* See Table I* The 
necessity of an exact and reproducible test to determine such characteris¬ 
tics is readily apparent* 

(b) Previous Work . A considerable amount of work on the weathering 
of Alberta coals has been done in previous years at the Research Council 
laboratories* Much of this has been done on coals which are just on the 
border line between the bituminous group and the sub-bituminous group* 

In any classification work the proximate analyses of the samples 
should be considered, for ary indication in this field of the superiority 
of one coal over another* Present studies included coals from the Coal- 
spur, Saunders and Lethbridge areas, so the results of a number of pre¬ 
vious analyses on these coals were studied* Representative classification 
data are shown in Table II* It will be seen that Coalspur coals, with 
8.4$ average capacity moisture, in this respect rank higher than Saunders 
coals, with 9*1%, but in fixed carbon and heat value the Saunders coals 
rank higher. The heat value is that employed for ranking in the classifi¬ 
cation scheme* Lethbridge coals, on the average, are lowest on all three 
counts; but some Lethbridge coals rank higher than some Coalspur or some 
Saunders coals. The last column in the table shows the order of the 
mines, arranged according to their calorific value. 

On the basis of the classification shown, it is apparent that unless 
there is a marked difference in their weathering properties, there is no 
essential difference in the rank of the coals from these three areas* The 
sample from the Drumheller area has been included in order to allow a com¬ 
parison between the higher ranking group and a representative example of 
a lower ranking group. The A*S.T*M* specifications put those samples

In this series the screening was not well standardized, nor was the 
humidity well controlled. In some of the tests, no blank screening was 
done, so no blank corrections could be applied on the samples. However, 
some idea of the values may be gained from the results which are given. 

The results indicated in the storage index column are fairly reliable 
as a relative guide to the weathering abilities of the coals. This storage 
indesfc is based on five cycles of weathering and screening (6). It should' 
be noted that good storage coals have a low one-cycle loss, and a high

storage index. 

The Saunders, Coalspur and Lethbridge samples are seen to be coals 
with a high storage index - they obviously should be grouped together. 

Below the Lethbridge samples there is a large drop, from 78 to 25, in the 
storage index before the next classification is reached. These low-index 
coals, as given by the table, are definitely weathering coals. Taber, 

Milk River, Champion and Carbon are the principal areas in Alberta with coal 
classed as"Sub-bituminous A" rather than "High Volatile C Bituminous" be¬ 
cause of this slacking property. (Drumheller is classed as "Sub-bituminous B") 
In some carefully controlled tests run a few years later, the Coal¬ 
spur coals were given a slacking index of 1.2, and Lethbridge coals an index 
of 0.6 - both by the A.S.T.M. method. This method specifies that if the 
index is over 5.0, the coal shall be classed as weathering. Hence the two 

V 

samples tested should be non-weathering# 

Later tests, using the A.S.T.M. method and blank corrections, gave 
the results as shown in Table IV.

Ottawa Tests . 

Some of these samples were received from Ottawa, from Mr* J.H.H. 
Nicolls, who stated that he had obtained an index of over 5.0 for some 
Coalspur coals when following the A.S.T.M. procedure. Mr. Nicolls sent 
five samples of coal from Coalspur and Lethbridge, to this laboratory, in 
order that comparative tests should be made in the two laboratories on the 
same samples. It should be noted that the Ottawa samples are very liable 
to have been weathered and broken in the course of sampling and transit. 

The results of the tests on these Ottawa samples are shown below, 
in Table V, with earlier results from this laboratory on samples received 
direct from the mine added for comparison.

Method (1) was the A.S.T.M. Method. 

Method (E) was a slightly modified A.S.T.M. method. 

Method (3) employed Ro-tap screening. 

Method (4) employed a trommel screen. 

The R.C.A. (Research Council of Alberta) value is the value obtained 
in the tests reported in Table IV. It should be noted that these values 
agree closely with the averages of the Ottawa methods (l) and (E).

The earlier values are all lower than those obtained from the Ottawa 
samples* Apparently the Ottawa samples were inferior to the samples which 
were received directly from the mine, as suggested earlier* 

As a general conclusion, we may state that the Coalspur, Saunders and 
Lethbridge coals should all be classed as non-weathering* 

It might be noted here that even if coal from one or two mines in a 
district did fall below the boundary line in a test used for classification - 
as suggested by Mr* Nicolls for some Coalspur coals in the weathering test - 
economic reasons might still make it advisable to place all the coals from 
the district in the same class* 

(c) Criticism of Present A*S*T»M® Test * There are a number of ob¬ 
jections to the existing weathering tests* 

1* The blank screening is done on the same sample which is used for 
the test* This is not satisfactory if the original sample is somewhat 
cracked, as e.g* from the blasting of coal* Small pieces will be broken 
off and included in the blank* The pieces actually tested, therefore, are 
stronger than before and thus the blank is too high* 

Selvig, in private correspondence, has approved the use of a 
separate blank, and such procedure has always been used in these labora¬ 
tories* The A.S*T*M*, however, still specifies the original procedure* 

2, Hand screening is too subject to the personal equation* 

3* Gentle screening by hand may leave on the screen flat pieces, which 
would readily pass through if turned over® 

(d) Object of Test * The present aim is to establish a procedure of 
operation and calculation of weathering index that will give reasonably 
consistent results in different laboratories* In view of the fact that 
the present classification has been adopted both in Canada and the U*S*A*

it is obvious that the line of differentiation between weathering and non¬ 
weathering coals should not be notably changed, but only be mere exactly 
defined* 

Apparatus . 

It was felt that some improvement over the earlier work could be 

obtained by combining the screening action with a more definite breakage 

action, and a turning over of the pieces on the screen* In this way a 

truer indication of the ability of the coal to stand up under handling 

and storage conditions should be obtained* 

A box tumbler, which could meet these requirements, was therefore 

constructed* This tumbler is a modification of an earlier design by 

(7) 

Stansfield and Gilbart and is constructed as a hexagonal cage* 

Three and a half walls of the hexagon are made of 12 gauge iron plate, 

and the remaining 2 1/2 walls are of 3 mesh per inch, square opening, wire 

screen, with l/4” opening* The plates and screens are 5 l/2” wide and the 

hexagon has a diagonal length of 15”• The side walls are of 3 ply wood, 

hexagonal, of 17” diagonal* Placed approximately along one radius of 

the hexagon is another .12 gauge iron plate or lifter* In one of the side 

walls, a 3” diameter opening is cut, with centre 2 l/4" from the platform 

and 2” from the near screen, and this is used for loading and unloading 

the tumbler* This opening is covered by a hinged piece of light iron, 

which is backed up by a piece of 3 ply* 

The cage is rotated about a shaft, made of 9/16” pipe, by means 

of a hand crank attached to one end of the shaft. Figure I and the photo¬ 

ns 

graphs on page 4-fr illustrate the construction details. The ”DETAIL” in 
Figure I simply shows the method of attachment of the cage to the shaft.

As the cage is rotated, (in a clockwise direction according to 
Fig* I) the coal is caught on the radial plat#*, or lifter, raised and then 
dropped approximately 6 n onto the iron plates below, where it suffers some 
breakage, and is then rolled over the screen for a distance of 18”• The 
undersize, passing through the screen, falls onto a chute and is guided 
onto a pan on a balance* 

This chute is made of #26 B. & S* gauge galvanized iron* It is 
8” wide, the rest of the dimensions may be obtained from the scale drawing 
of Figure I* At the discharge end, a cover is soldered onto the vertical 
portion of the chute, in order to minimize the loss of fines* A 3/8” x 8 M 
opening is left in the cover to allow for the discharge'of the coal* The 
chute is mounted at an angle of approximately 45 degrees in a wooden frame* 
The shaft of the cage rests in two notches cut in the beams at the top 
of the frame* 

The cage is turned at approximately 30 revolutions per minute* If 

the speed is increased, the coal does not fall from the platform onto 

the iron plate below, but instead is thrown forward, so that it lights 

on the screen* Further, if the coal is thrown at all, it will hit with 

will 

a greater force than if it just falls freely and suffei^s increased and 
indeterminate breakage* 

While it was attempted to keep the speed nearly constant during the 
runs, it was felt that any reduction in speed below the maximum mentioned, 
would have no effect on the results* As long as the coal only drops from 
the platform, with no throwing forward, the speed should be of no consequence* 

Another result of too great a rotating speed, is that fines are thrown 
out, over the top of the chute, by centrifugal action* To further minimize

the loss of fines, the cage should be rotated in such a direction that 
the top of the cage is coming towards an observer who is standing in 
front of the chute* Actual tests show that the loss of material, on 

harder 

border coals, is about 1/3 of 1%. (This value was obtained by taking 
the average loss of jbwenty runs, selected at random). On softer coals, 
the loss may be somewhat higher, due to the greater amount of material 
being broken# 

One advantage of the screen tumbler is that the undersize is re¬ 
moved as formed, and therefore does not have any cushioning effect on 
the larger samples # 

This tumbler gives better screening of the coal than the earlier 
model, due to the greater screen area per gram of charge# Observation 
showed that there was very little material under l/4 n size left in the 
residue on completion of a run# 

Gilmore, Nicolls, and Connell (8) show that the amount of breakage 
in apparatus such as this tumbler is dependent on three factors as cited 
below# These factors were not studied in the present investigation, 
since those conditions were kept constant# 

(1) A reduction in the size of the coal employed resulted in less 
breakage# Although no tests were run in this investigation to confirm 
this fact, it seemed to be indicated by a general observation of the 
results# 

(2) A reduction in the weight of the coal charge caused a slight 
increase in the breakage# This would seem to be quite as expected, for 
an increase in the charge would give increased cushioning effect for the 
falling pieces, and hence a smaller breakage# In the present test, the

size of the charge is kept nearly constant, and the average of four runs 
is used, so that the final result is that of an essentially constant charge 
(3) A reduction in width of the tumbler had only slight effects. Here 

trot 

again, the tumbler width was''changed, so errors due to this effect did 
not occuro 

(f) Procedure . The changes of procedure from the original A.S.T.M. 
method were designed, as already stated, to give a positive breaking effect 
with absence of cushioning of the lump, and standardized and efficient 
screening* Furthermore it was decided that the us© of large samples sized 
by screening, would be better than the selection by hand of a comparative¬ 
ly small number of lumps approximating a cube of 1 1/4” size* 

Large samples of coal, consisting of 2" lumps, packed with fines, 
were shipped in carbide tins from the mines studied* A representative 
sample of the coal, weighing about 5600-3800 grams, and consisting of lumps 
passing a 1 1/2" square screen, and retained on a 1" square screen, is 
obtained* This is then riffled in order to give eight samples* Four of 
these are used as a blank and four for the test. It was felt that the 
process of fiffling, besides giving a representative sample, served another 
purpose in that it tended to break up those lumps which already contained 
fracture planes. Such cracked lumps would give erratic results* Due to 
the breakage which ilways occurs in the riffling process, the samples, 
as finally obtained, weigh about 450 grams each. This means that about 
20-25 lumps are used in each run. The process is indicated in the diagram 
below. 

The four samples marked "B" are used for the blanks, those marked 
"T" are put through the weathering cycle. The small "r" indicates that 
riffling has taken place. Each blank in turn is weighed and immediately

placed in the tumbler, and the cage rotated for about 200-500 turns. 

At appropriate points, the number of turns and the amount of material 
under size is recorded, so that a complete curve which represents the 
breakage characteristics of the material can be obtained by plotting 
the percentage under size against the corresponding number of revolutions. 
This operation is done for each of the four blanks as soon as possible 
after the riffling* 

From the final curves an average is obtained by taking average 
results at various abscissae* Note that this average is obtained from 
values taken from the smoothed curves - it is not obtained by averaging 
values recorded from the runs directly. By following this procedure, it 
is felt that any variations causing erratic values in single runs are not 

unt/v/y 

allowed to A influence the final average* 

Those portions which are used for the test are first subjected to 
a period of air-drying at 30°C, and 32% relative humidity (R.E.). This 
is done in an oil-sealed chamber, using saturated magnesium chloride

solutions for humidity control, as described by Stansfield and Gilbert'(5) 
After being dried for 24 hours, the sample is immersed in water at room 
temperature for one hour, and is then taken out, drained quickly and re¬ 
dried under the original conditions. After 24 hours it is removed from 
the chamber and subjected to breakage in the tumbler* Results are ob¬ 
tained and plotted as previously described for the blank* 

(g) Results . This series of tests was conducted on nine samples of 
High Volatile C Bituminous Coal from different locations in the Saunders, 
Coalspur and Lethbridge areas* Coals from these areas were chosen for 
the test, as the classification of these coals is dependent on the 
weathering character* Earlier work here, it has been shown, groups 
the coals of these areas together as being non-weathering - and the 
finding at Ottawa that a minority were weathering had not been accepted* 

In this work it was hoped to evolve a test and procedure that would give 
more constant results and clarify the situation* Results of tests, on 
a sample of Drumheller coal made for another investigation are included 
to show the results obtained with a coal which is undoubtedly weathering 
in character. The classification data, based on analysis for each of 
these coals, is given in Table II on page 9. The sample numbers, mines, 
and mine numbers, and areas of each of the samples are shown in the 
table belov/i They are all from the Belly River Horizon* 

The results of these tests are shown in the graphs from page 30

When the tests were first made the blank was subjected to a partial 
drying, through a mistaken understanding of the procedure to be followed. 
It was placed in the constant temperature - constant humidity chamber for 
24 hours before being run. These results are shown in the curves labelled

"ADB” (Air-dried. Blank) of the Series 1 graphs. The results from the 

weathering tests are labelled ”WS w (Weathered Sample). When there was 

sufficient sample remaining, a second series of runs was made following 

the correct procedure. As Series I was run with fresh coal, and Series 

2, necessarily, on coal which had been stored, it was decided later to 

use the results of Series I, but with the blank adjusted to the correct 

procedure basis by means of a factor determined in Series 2, In Series 

2 a blank was run immediately after riffling, and the corresponding 

curve is labelled M CB" (Correct Blank), A further blank to correspond 

with that done in Series 1, was also run, and this curve is similarly 

labelled ”ADB U . The weathering test for Series 2 is done in the usual 

fashion, and again is labelled tt WS n . It was then assumed that, had a 
run 

correct blank been for Series 1, it would bear the same ratio to the 

air-dried blank as does the correct blank to the air-dried blank of Series 

2 , i.e, CB(1) s CB (2) , A value for CB(1) was then calculated from 
ADB(l) ADB(27 

this relationship, at a number of definite abscissae on the curve. This 
value is shown with Series 1 by the dotted line, and is indicated as 
"DB" (Derived Blank).

In most cases it will be seen that the under size for Series 2, in 
both the blank and weathered samples is greater than for Series 1. This 
is probably due to the weathering effect which would occur in the stored 
coal, even in a closed can, between the time of running the first and 
second series of runs. 

For this reason, and for other reasons explained later, it was decided 
to make no use of the Series 2 runs, except as a guide to the adjustment 
of the blank in Series 1 to the value that would have been obtained if it 
had been made prior to air-drying. Nevertheless the curves for Series 2 
are all shown. 

There are several things which should be noted about the individual 

runs. 

In #436-41, Series 1, the weathered sample and the air-dried blank 
are practically on the same line. In the runs on the weathered sample in 
Series 2, a leak had developed in the cooling coils of the fan motor in 
the constant-humidity chamber, with the result that the bottom of the 
chamber was flooded, and the samples were exposed to 100$ R.H. for a time. 
The approximate cycle was a drying at 32$ R.H. for 24 hours, immersion in 
water for 1 hour, drying for about 6-8 hours at 32$ R.H. (the exact time 
that the leak developed being unknown) exposure to 100$ R.H. for about 12 
hours, and drying at 32$ R.H. for 18 hours. As a result, the weathering 
effect is greater than usual. Since there was not enough sample for air- 
dried blank to be run in Series 2, the derived blank for Series 1 had to 
be obtained by interpolation from the curves of similar coals. 

In #445-41, Series 2, the original weathered sample showed a breakage 
which was obviously too high; hence this value was discarded. For interest, 
a calculated curve was deduced, using Series 1 and the air-dried blank, and 
is shown dotted in the figure for this sample.

In $456-41 there was not sufficient sample for a second series to be 
run. Hence there is only shown the Series 1, and the derived blank in this 
case had to be obtained by interpolation from the curves of similar coals. 

In $457-41, Series 1, the weathered loss was lower than the air-dried 
blank. This was a hard coal, and even in Series 2 there was little difference 
between the results of the test and the blank. The derived blank for Series 
1 bears the normal relation to the test values. 

In $482-41, the sample was tested after the error in the method of 
making the blank had been noted. The tests have been labelled Series 2, 
as the procedure of that series was followed, but it should be noted that 
as the tests were made as soon as the can was first opened, this weathering 
test had all the reliability of a Series 1 run and the results were used 
for calculating the weathering indest of this coal. 

(h) Calculations . A number of different methods were tried, to obtain 
a suitable value which could be used as an indication of the weathering 
properties of the coal. Note that this test gives an indication of both 
friability and weathering properties of the coal, but for the present 
purpose of classification, only the weathering properties must be repre¬ 
sented in the calculated index. 

An attempt was made to find an empirical equation to fit the curves, 
and to see if some measure could be derived from the constants of the 
equation, but no satisfactory indication was obtained from this method. 

One attempt which seemed to give some promise was based on taking 
a simple ratio, from the two^curves, of the percentages lost at definite 
abscissae. It was felt that an average of a number of these ratios might 
have some value. A similar calculation was based on taking the ratios 
(test to blank) of the number of turns to produce any particular per-

centages of under size material* However, these ratios did not show any 
constancy among the values used to obtain averages, and further, some 
lower ranking coals approached some of the higher ranking coals on some 
of the ratios. There should be a clear line of demarcation. Further, 
this method involves both strength and weathering properties. 

Another system considered was that of ascertaining the number of turns 
required in the test to give a definite percentage undersize, corrected 
for blank. This had the disadvantage that no satisfactory percentage could 
be chosen which would be applicable to all samples, even in such closely 
related groups as the one studied. See Figure XI. Thus for example, #482-41 
had not reached a 5 % difference at 200 revolutions, but 438-41 had reached 
it at about 22 revolutions. The first number is too ») the second too 

J/hd/f mcM'd 

h igh , and' 1 would not permit tests with a wider range of coals. 

It was finally decided to take the percentages (corrected for blank) 
of undersize material at 50 turns as the weathering index. From Figure XI 
it will be seen that there is only one sample, #438-31, which goes over 5 % 
loss at 50 turns. The remainder are all well under the mark. This one 
sample is from the same mine as the sample which was questioned by Ottawa. 

Two points are significant about thiss - 

(1) This mine is a stripping pit. 

(2) Other previous samples from this mine have sometimes shown good 
weathering properties and sometimes bad, which suggests that from an open 
pit mine there is a great possibility of obtaining a pre-weatherea sample. 

If such samples were obtained, the results would naturally be high. 

This choice has a number of advantages: - 

(l) The amount of material retained in the cage throughout the test 
with the weathered sample is of the same dimension as that retained in 
the blank. With some coals, after one hundred or so turns, the material 
left in the cage in the blank runs is likely to be considerably greater

than the material left in the weathered runs* As previously mentioned, 
this affects the amount of breakage* 

(2) As weathering is a surface effect, the test should not go beyond 
knocking off the surface* When the test is carried too far, the breakage 
from the weathered lumps becomes close to that of the blanks* Note that 
the curves tend to become parallel* 

(3) By only having to do 50 revolutions, the time taken to run the test 
is considerably shortened* 

(4) With this method of calculation, it is not necessary to change the 
A.S.T.M* limit for weathering and non-weathering coals* It can be seen 
that all coals, with the exception of one, as previously explained, fall 
below the 5% limit at 50 turns* A definitely weathering coal, as the 
Drumheller* sample, shows an index of 45 - this shows a clear line of de¬ 
marcation. 

This investigation must entirely remove any question of classifying 
Lethbridge coals as lower rank than Coalspur or Saunders, on the basis of 
weathering tests, and as previously shown, they fall in the same class on 
the calorific value basis. 

The test, as carried out, giving results on seven out of nine coals 
as between Z% and 5%, is apparently slightly more drastic than the tests 
previously described* 

(i) Discussion* This test reveals some very interesting things. 

As previously mentioned, Gilmore, Nicolls and Connell found that a reduc¬ 
tion in the weight of the charge to the tumbler resulted in increased 
breakage. While no particular tests were run to confirm this, it seemed 
that a variation of 10-15?$ in the weight of the charge had no effect on 
the amount of breakage. However, in one case it was necessary to put in 
one charge, which was about half the usual weight* The result was con-

siderably higher than the values obtained for the other check samples. 

No use was made of this result. 

A further point of interest concerns the depth to which the samples 

are immersed in water. In $445-41 Series 2, the weathered test was 

, Usually the samples were immersed in about 3-4 inches - 
immersed in about 6-7 inches*- just sufficient to completely cover the 

lumps. This sample gave a result which seemed to be exceptionally high. 

It is conceivable that the increased water pressure from the greater depth 
forced liquid further into the lump, with the result the weathering effect 
penetrated further than usual. Due to insufficient sample, it was not 
possible to test this point further. But it can be argued that the pene¬ 
tration is proportional to the sum of the barometric pressure and the water 

c/oie 

pressure. In this case, the ratio is about 51.7/31.5. This is *a very tew- 

on%+/ 

value, and suggests that the high value may have been a coincidence. It 
is suggested that this point be tested, and if necessary a standardized 
immersion depth be selected. 

Another point was noticed on the curves which were obtained from the 
weathered samples. The broad form of the curves shows a line which rises 
fairly steeply, and then gradually slopes off. However, close examination 
of the curves seemed to indicate that after about 90-100 turns of the 
tumbler, the slope of the curve increased slightly, followed by the usual 
tapering off. This may be an indication that during the first- 100 or so 
turns while the outside, more weathered portions were being broken off, 
some fracture planes were being introduced into the inner portions of the 
lump. At about this point, sufficient work had been done on the lump that 
a rather sudden size degradation took place, with the corresponding in¬ 
crease in the amount of undersize material. This effect, however, seemed 
to be very slight, so there is still some question as to whether or not it

actually exists, or is just an experimental error, since ttye latter could 
easily account for the effect* However, the frequent occurrence of such 
a bend in the curve in this neighborhood might be significant* 

It is also interesting to note that the curves, particularly for the 
blanks, seem to approach linearity after a number of turns* This linear 
portion would seem to follow Kick*s Law - that the energy consumed in 
breakage is proportional to the volume reduction* 

A calculation of the errors in the test shows that the average de¬ 
viation in the values of the blank at 50 turns is 0,5$. This represents 
a 10$ average deviation on the determined values. For the weathered 

</eria£fon 

samples there is a greater range - the average difference being 1.5$, 
which corresponds to 13*5$ of the determined values. Parry and Goodman 
(9) using a trommel screen, show an average maximum deviation of 8*3$. 

They obtain a fraction whose denominator is about eight times the value 
obtained here, so this lowers the percentage* 

(j) Conclusion . In conclusion, it is suggested that the test developed 
has the following advantages over the A.S.T.M. tests - 

(1) The blank is done on a separate portion* 

(2) More pieces are taken for the test, and these are selected as to 
size by screening and not by hand picking. 

(3) A standardized method of screening is established. 

(4) This screening involves a positive breakage, whereby the small 
fractures induced by weathering play some part in the total size reduction. 

(5) The use of a riffle to separate the blank and test portions is 
advantageous• 

One weakness of the test is the magnitude of the blank as a result of 


the more drastic treatment during screening. The inderi is therefore the

difference between two larger amounts than in the A*S*T*M. test* Greater 
differences between replica tests may thus be anticipated, but for reasons 
stated above, there should be closer agreement between different operators 
and laboratories* 

The test can be used to replace the A.S*T*M* test without change of 
weathering factor to differentiate between weathering and non-weathering 
coals* 

Coalspur, Saunders and Lethbridge areas should be given the same 


classification

D. THE ACCELERATED WEATHERING TEST AND COAL COMPARISON . 

(a) Object of Test. A second use for the weathering test, besides 
the classification of coals, is in the study of the relative weathering 
properties of different coals whose rank may be entirely removed from the 
High Volatile "C” Bituminous class, where the classification is important. 
Such a case is illustrated in the following studies. There seemed to be 
some doubt regarding the relative weathering properties of Edmonton and 
Drumheller doals, so in response to a request, a study of these coals 
was undertaken. 

The following samples were used for the analysis.

The samples were received in carbide tins, and were prepared following 
the procedure previously outlined for the earlier tests. However, in addi¬ 
tion, samples were run after exposure to different humidities, as will be 
explained later, so that a larger gross sample had to be prepared. Some 
of the sample was ta cen out for further tests, so that the preparation was 
according to the following schemes -

Stansfield and Gilbert found that the lower the relative humidity 
used to dry out the coal during the weath' ring cycle, the greater the 
degradation effect* The humidity used in tests for the classification 
of coals is 62 %. For this test on lower rank coals it was felt that such 
a drying would result in excessive breakage, and give little differentia¬ 
tion between the samples* Therefore it was decided to make further runs 
at relative humidities of 47$ and 75 %. It was because of these added 
tests that a larger sample was required* According to the diagram, the 
(B) samples were used for the blank determinations* T 1 -T 4 were exposed 
to 52 % R.H*, T 5 -T 8 to 47$ R.E., and Tg-T^ to 75 % R.E. 

In earlier work on the accelerated weathering test the attempt was 
made, without success, to tie the weathering index up to the moisture 
holding properties of the coal* If this had been possible, the complicated 
weathering test, hard to standardize, might have been replaced by suitable 
moisture tests* The coupling of these series of weathering tests with 
careful moisture holding tests on the same samples was therefore planned 
as a further effort to relate the two characteristics* Complete moisture¬ 
holding curves for these coals were therefore determined, and these are 
shown in Figures XII and XIII. Where possible, these curves were checked 
with the results of J. Oberholtzer, and the two series of determinations 
were found to be in fair agreement* 

(b) Meth od of Test. The tests were run in similar fashion to those 
previously described* Only one blank series was run, and this was done 
immediately after the riffling and screening of the sample* While test 
samples were waiting to be placed in the chamber under appropriate humidity 
conditions, they were wrapped in paper bags, and stored in tightly closed 
cans, which were just large enough to admit the samples - i*e* there was a

minimum of air for any further weathering# 

(c) Results and Discussion * The results are shown in Figures XIV 
to XIX* Table IX, page 44, shows the losses per 50 turns for the blank 
and test runs of the different samples. The individual values ana also 
the averages are shown* 

The last column in the table shows the deviations in the values 
obtained# They are given in order for the 32$, 47$ and 75$ runs in each 
case*. Under 11 A" is given the average of the deviations of the four runs; 
under "B” this average is expressed as a percentage of the average value 
of the run# Both are expressed as percentages# For example, the average 
of the deviations for the 32$ run, sample 412-42, is 6#9$. But this 
represents 11#1$ of the average value of the runs, 62A$. It was felt 
that both of these deviations should be shown. The average percentage 
deviation of all runs is 8#0$, compared to the previously mentioned 
value obtained by Parry and Goodman (9) of 8#3$# 

In connection with the question previously discussed concerning the 
relative quantities of coal left in the tumbler in the blanks and in the 
tests, (see pp. 1? and£6) a study of these results is interesting. In 

V"-' 

all cases there is a high percentage of material lost, and hence there is 
liable to be considerable error due to change in weight of the residual 
charge in the tumbler. There is also considerable variation in the amount 
of blank undersize. Four different cases may be noted: - 

(1) A high blank value, with a high test value, as 415-42. 

(2) A high blank value, with low test value, as 417-42. 

(3) A low blank value, with low test value, as, 412-42. 

(4) A low blank value, with high test value, as 413-42.

For reasons just stated, the determinations with a high test value 
are probably in error. Similarly a result with a low blank value might be 
doubtful. In the case of a run such as (2) though, there is a smaller 
difference between the amounts of residual material in the blanks and in 
the tests, than in the other tests. Hence the factors just discussed tend 
to cancel each other, and the result may be more reliable. 

As can be noted, the 75$ run had the lowest absolute error, but even 
this cycle was possibly too drastic. We are, however, on the horns of a 
dilemma. If the drying is slight there will not be sufficient difference 
between a good and a poor weathering coal; if the drying is considerable, 
the blank will be far from accurate with the poor weathering coal, as the 
pieces left after the weathered outside has been knocked off are so small 
that the blank determined on full size pieces is not applicable. Some 
factor might be devised for use with the blank to allow for variation in 
size - but this at best would be little better than a guess. 

A study of the curves of Figures XIV to XIX suggests that a 50 

revolution point for comparison - as in the ?/ork on classification - is 

.too small a number of revolutions, as the curves are all rising very rapidly 

at this point. To use a higher number, however, magnifies the uncertainty 

with respect to the blank to be used. One point to consider is that all 

the runs at 32$ R.H. were good; but two runs at 47$ R.H. and one at 75$ 

R.H. were each poor. Another point is that the 32$ runs were used in the 

classification series. It was therefore decided to use the 52% R.H. runs. 

An adjusted blank, however, was adopted. It was assumed, quite arbitrarily, 

that the blank would be proportional to the weight of the material left 

for 

after the 50 turns. Thus/the run on 412-42 and 32$, the average loss was 

6 £rb$, or &H9% left. The blank loss was 3.5$, or 96.5$ left. The blank

to be subtracted was therefore taken as 3.5 x 57.7 /96.5, or 1.4$, and the 

<o2 * 6 /•/ 

weathering index is therefore 6 2.3 - 1.4 or 6 0* 9. The other runs were 
similarly calculated. 

The value of the percentage losses are shown in Table IX. It will 
be seen that except in the case of 415-42 there is a progressive increase 
in the percentage losses as the humidity value goes down. No explanation 
can be given for the one anomalous result, possibly an error was made in 
the salt used for the humidity control. Due to the loss of humidity con¬ 
trol during the weathering process, the 47$ results of 413-42 and 447-42 
and the 75$ results of 449-42 are questionable. 

These indices, calculated as shown above for the 32$ humidity runs, 
are compared with the results of the moisture determinations in Table X. 
The retained moisture values at 60$ R.H. ana at the capacity moisture 
are the most frequently obtained during routine analyses in this labora¬ 
tory, therefore these two values are used. The samples in each area are 
shown in descending order of weathering index.

The complete moisture curves are shown in Figures XII and XIII. 

It will be seen that these moisture curves cannot be closely corre¬ 
lated with the weathering properties of closely related groups of coals, - 
such determinations cannot, therefore, replace the weathering test* This 
same conclusion was obtained in previous work at this laboratory* They do 
show a broad relationship between separate groups, but this gives little 
more information than the previously known fact that the lower the rank of 
the coal the higher the moisture, and the higher the weathering index* 

One factor which may have seriously influenced the results was the 
presence of clayey lumps in some of the samples* These disintegrated 
completely under the weathering influences, and hence raised the amount of 
undersize* This may partly account for some of the high results in Table 
IX - in many cases it will be seen that there are three close results and 
one high one* There was seldom more than one such lump in any test run, 
and more often not one* Clay partings in a coal lump would also give a 
similar, but less noticeable effect. Such particles, however, should not 
have any marked effect on the difference between retained moisture values 
at different humidities* 

The Drumheller indices, on the average, are lower than the Edmonton 
indices, so it is concluded that the former coals are better weathering 
coals than the latter. The Edmonton coals, on the contrary, had the lower 
blank values, indicating lower friability* It is suggested that the slight 
extra friability of the Drumheller coals may have given the impression that 
these were inferior in weathering properties* 

With respect to the humidities used in the tests, a suggestion might 
be offered for consideration in further work on this line. While the coals 
were being tested some slacking occurred in the tumbler - the noise could 
be plainly heard* This of course is due to the drying of the coal in the

drier atmosphere of the laboratory. For further work it might be well to 
use some cycle ass - 

Exposure to 32% R.H. for 24 hours. 

Exposure to 75% R.H. for 24 hours. 

Exposure to 32% R.H. for 24 hours. 

Tumbler test. 

In this way the sample is still not a great deal more moist than its 
surroundings, and still it has not gone through too great a degradation 
cycle. This is only offered as a suggestion for getting improved indices 
on lower rank coals during comparison tests - not to replace the existing 
classification test. 

A major problem in these studies was that of getting satisfactory 
humidity control. In spite of regular checking in the chamber to see that 
there was both saturated salt solution and undissolved salt in contact 
with the solution, humidity control was lost in three runs. Since the 
results are still in proper relationship to the corresponding ‘62%, and 
75%, runs, the humidity could not have been too far out of line. Never¬ 
theless, these results are questionable. A mild centrifuging, after 
immersion, would reduce the risk of loss of humidity control. The coal 
could be put in a wire basket and swung in order to obtain this action. 

In another run at 75%, R.H. a leak had developed in the motor cooling 
coils, and there was water in the bottom of the chamber. However, there 
was still a good deal of exposed salt in the evaporating trays. This 
would indicate that the salt trays were not controlling the humidity too 
well. (This may only occur at the higher humidities - it is doubtful if 
there would be any free crystals with a deliquescent salt such as MgCl2.6H20,

which is used to obtain the 52 % R.H.). This whole series was subsequently 
discarded as being unreliable. 


In conclusion, it can be suggested that the accelerated weathering 
test is not entirely satisfactory for classification; it is far less 
satisfactory for comparison of low rank coals.

CHAPTER I I. 

THE INFLUENCE OF PARTICLE SIZE ON DETERMINATIONS. 

A* Introduc tion. 

During the summer of 1941 Mr. W. A. Lang suggested to the writer 
that some work on the influence of particle size on the analytical deter¬ 
minations as carried out in this laboratory might be both useful and in¬ 
teresting# In the preparation of samples for analysis in the laboratory 
the coal is ground in a ball mill till it is a fine powder. A rough,, 
and probably conservative, estimate of the size distribution would indi¬ 
cate that about 90% would pass through a 150 mesh screen, and certainly 
pass through a 100 mesh screen. The A.S.T.M. specifications indicate 
that the sample shall pass through a 250 micron (60 mesh) wire screen, so 
that it is seen that the samples are ground more finely than this specifi¬ 
cation. It is certain that fine grinding will give better checking on 
replica determinations, but it is less certain that the absolute accuracy 
is increased. For example, fine grinding may increase the liability to 
error from oxidation - this point is touched on in the next chapter. 

It may be noted that particle size influence should be considered 
in two different ways. Thus the size of the particle, irrespective of 
its composition, may affect the course of a determination, e.g. the time 
of test in a moisture determination might be insufficient to remove all 
moisture from the centre of a large particle. On the other hand, with 
a heterogeneous material such as coal, the composition of two small portions 
taken for tests may differ with large particles. For example, it has often 
been noticed in the course of running calorific value determinations, that 
if the sample is at all coarse there is difficulty in obtaining good dupli-

cates, although combustion may be complete in both cases* 

Aside from the effect of particle size on analytical procedures, it 
has a tremendous bearing on industrial processes* Rosin (10) states "that 
to give an exhaustive report on the influence of particle size in fuel 
technology would be impossible* Our insight into the phenomena and our 
experimental knowledge of the fundamentals and characteristics are far 
too small". A direct study of the size effect on industrial applications 
is rather out of the scope of this report, but mention was made of it to 
still further emphasize the importance of particle size studies* 

B* Previous Work * 

There seems to have been very little work done along this line in 
previous years, and this lack of research is very surprising, considering 
the importance of the subject* Most of the investigations have been 
carried out in studies of actual fuel problems, or on larger sizes than 
are here considered* It is doubtful if such work can be compared with 
the present work, because of the great difference in conditions* The 
work of the previous investigators in this field will be dealt with in 
appropriate sections, and in the discussion* 

C* Present Work . 

(i) Ash. The determination of the ash content of a coal is, next to 
the calorific value determination, probably the most important analytical 
procedure in coal work* The more that coal is used for purposes other 
than heating, such as in extraction processes, the greater will be the 
bearing of its ash content on its usefulness* This test, which is 
relatively simple in procedure, can show some very interesting results 
if the conditions are varied* In one particular sample, to be discussed 
later, the results showed an astounding dependence on the rate of heating 


of the furnace

This present work is concerned with the amount of ash found in 
successive portions separated by screening from the same crushed sample, 
and with the agreement of replicas at each size* 

Samples were prepared by grinding lumps in a coffee mill, and then 
sieving the ground material through appropriate screens* Ash determina¬ 
tions were made on the resulting sized material. The difference between 
this procedure and that of grinding a number of similar samples, each to 
a different size, should be noted. In the latter case, of course, the 
ash content of each product should be the same as it would not be changed 
by grinding* 

Roszak, in some earlier work on French coals (11) found that the 
ash content increased with fineness* He found that the increase was not 
at all regular, but that the finer samples always had more ash than the 
coarser samples* On the other hand, later investigations by Krolevetz (12) 
on some Russian coals showed that the ash content decreased with increase 
in fineness of the coal sample. 

Some of the results of the present investigation are shown in Table 

XI. These results are obtained from the coal samples utilized in the 

V 

standardization of the weathering tests. It will be seen that in all 
cases, except one, the ash content in the smaller size is greater than 
that in the coarser sizes. However, in six of the nine analyses, the medium 
sample shows a lower content than the coarser samples* In three of these 
six, however, the results are very close, so they should not be considered 
as being too far out of line with the general trend. 

Further work on the six samples used in the comparative weathering 
tests is shown in Table XII. The first four results are on the "as

received basis", the last two on the "air-dried” basis. This air-drying 
was done in order to facilitate the separation of the sizes in screening. 

In some of the previous samples it was noticed that some fines were in 
with the larger particles. This may have been due to the moist condition 
of the coal, causing the fines to adhere to other particles. Some air¬ 
drying was then considered advisable as a means of eliminating this 
possibility. 

Where duplicate determinations of the ash were run, these are shown. 

It will be seen that the general tendency is for the figures to vary about 
a lower value until at the smallest, or next to the smallest, they rise. 

Here, in all cases, the finest size has the highest ash content. The 
values shown below the table are the values obtained in the normal analysis 
of the sample. These values are, in all cases, adjusted to the same mois¬ 
ture basis as the rest of the ash values given above. It will be seen that 
these values, as would be expected, lie between the high and low percentages.

A study of the figures for the duplicate determinations is re¬ 
vealing. On the whole, as we progress from the coarser to the finer 
materials, the difference between duplicates becomes less. This increase 
in accuracy is due to two reasons: - 

Firstly, better sampling will be obtained with the finer sizes. 
Though the material was stirred before portions were removed for weighing, 
it can be readily appreciated that a few larger pieces are much more 
liable to variation in composition than a large number of smaller pieces. 

Secondly, there is liable to be incomplete combustion of the larger 
coal particles. That is, the outer surfaces will burn first, and the ash 
so formed will not allow such free access of air to the central portion 
of the lump. This could result in the presence of unburned coal in the 
lump, and a consequent high value reported as ash. However, in some 
early suspected cases the ash was re-ignited, but no further loss was 
observed. 

It might be noted that there seems to be little improvement in 
accuracy of this determination by using the fine samples obtained in this 
laboratory rather than by using the relatively coarser samples allowed by 
the A.S.T.M. 

The results of this test must depend largely on whether the clean 
coal is the harder or the softer, and the results will therefore change 
from coal to coal. 

(ii) Moisture. The moisture content of a coal probably ranks next to 
the ash content in importance. This study deals with both the moisture in 
the coal and its capacity moisture. This latter quantity, which has been 
defined by Stansfield and Gilbart (1.3) as "the minimum amount of water in 
the fresh coal which can exert the same vapour pressure as free water at 
• the same temperature", might be expected to show some interesting results

when correlated with particle size. 

Roszak's work, previously referred to, makes no mention of any mois¬ 
ture determinations. Krolevetz found that the moisture content increased 
with fineness of the coal. 

All samples in this test were selected as before - i.e. - grinding 
and screening. The total moisture results for the first nine samples were 
obtained from the capacity moisture determinations. These results, together 
with the capacity moistures, are shown in Table XIII.

The results of the second series of six determinations are shown in 
Table XIV. As with the first series, total moisture results are those ob¬ 
tained from the capacity moisture runs* In addition, for the last two 
samples, a moisture determination was made in tho usual fashion* The re¬ 
sults in this table are only the averages of the runs - the duplicates are 
not given, since there was no difference in the accuracy of the two series 
As with the ash, the results are on the "as received" basis for the first 
four samples, and on the "air-dried" basis for the last two* In the table 
the total moisture*results are in row "T", the capacity results in row "C" 
and the moisture as determined in the usual way in row "Ta".

Looking at the results for the total moisture, we see that there is 
a regular decrease in moisture content with increasing fineness of the 
coal* This would suggest that a considerable part of the moisture was 
held in fissures in the coal, and not on the surface* 

In the process of screening, it was necessary to re-grind some of 
the medium sizes in order to obtain a sufficient amount of the fine material 
for all of the tests* During this grinding it is quite possible that some 
moisture could have been lost, though all precautions against this were 
taken* This might seem to vitiate the conclusion arrived at above* How¬ 
ever, the results from the capacity moisture determinations indicate that 
a similar drop in this value occurs with decrease in size* This supports 
the conclusion just obtained, since earlier work has shown that capacity 
moisture determinations are not seriously affected by any slight previous 
drying which may have occurred. 

The relationship between the capacity moisture and the specific 
surface of the coal is shown on the curves of Figure XIX. It will be 
seen that the capacity moisture varies linearly with the log of the 
specific surface. The slope of the lines, however, is just the opposite 
to what would be expected - they show a variation in the same direction 
as does the total moisture* 

The major part of the moisture in coal is probably held as part of 
a colloidal solution, which makes up the coal structure. Some is also 
held on the surface of the coal, and some in fissures in the lump. The 
above results woiild seem to indicate that in the process of grinding, 
moisture is readily lost through the break-down of one of the absorption 
mechanisms. During the process of grinding the coal, breakage takes place 
along the existing fracture planes and fissures* As the size of the par—

tides decreases, there is a net decrease in the volume of the particle 
which is occupied by a fissure# This results in a decrease in the mois¬ 
ture holding capacity of the particles, and the surplus evaporates# It 
is clear that the increase in surface does not make up for the loss of 
fissure volume# Apparently the grinding which occurs is of such a 
nature that few new fissures are introduced into the smaller lumps. It 
is recognized that the question of segregation of the coal into different 
constituents during screening may play a part in the moisture holding 
capacity of the coal, but the degree to which this property is affected 
has never been ascertained. Some segregation does occur in the different 
sizes, as is indicated by the variation in the ash content, just pre¬ 
viously shown# Examination of the duplicate determinations from Table 
XIII will show that there is no lowering of the difference between 
replica determinations with the finer sizes. This might be expected, 
since there is less heterogeneity with respect to moisture than with 
respect to ash, with the different sizes of coals. Also, the 'drying 
procedure used for these determinations (three hours at 108°C under 
vacuum) should remove all traces of moisture from such sizes as are used 
in the determinations. 

(iii) Specific Gravity. These determinations were run in the course 
of the study of the specific surface of the samples. By the method of 
determination used, it is necessary to know the specific gravity of the 
material under consideration. The tests were run according to a method 
developed in these laboratories and described by Oberholtzer (2). In a 
few cases a slight variation of the test was employed. 

In the usual test, a centrifuge tube is partly filled with a 
wetting agent, and then a weighed coal sample added, before the tube is 
completely filled. This is a precaution against getting air in with the

coal. The coal must release any air bubbles it holds before it can 
sink, and the subsequent centrifuging employed would also tend to drive 
out entrapped air. In the modified test, the tube containing the sample 
is evacuated, and the wetting agent added. Results using this test are 
substantially the same as in the original method, so the latter was used 
for the rest of the tests as it is somewhat shorter. No loss, even of 
dust, was observed during the evacuation of the centrifuge tube. 

The results of the test are shown in Table XV. It will be seen 
that these results are very similar to those for the variation in the 
ash content - i.e. the specific gravity increases with the fineness of 
the particles. This is quite to be expected. The mineral matter of 
the coal is much heavier than the carbonaceous material, and any in¬ 
crease in the former will naturally result in a heavier particle or 
mixture of particles. If the specific gravity is plotted against the 
ash content, it is found that one varies as the other, though not re¬ 
gularly. There is one factor which tends to interfere with correlations 
between ash and specific gravity, and that is the moisture change. The 
specific gravities were run at the same time as the specific surface 
determinations, sample for sample and size for size. It was impossible 
to do the ash determinations at the same time, so these were done earlier. 
Subsequent moisture loss and oxidation might change to specific gravity 
of the sample from its value at the time of ashing, to a new value at 
the time of the specific gravity determination. 

(iv) Specific Surface. This is a most important characteristic of 
any lot of coal, particularly of the finer sizes, since it is very closely 
connected with such problems as ignition of coal, whether spontaneous or 
not, and other chemical reactions in which the coal takes part. This

work is mainly concerned with its effect on the ignition temperature 
of the coal* The whole question of specific surface is intimately 
associated with the problem of particle shape, and an assumption as to 
this relationship is the basis of, and the weak point of, a number of 
different techniques for the determination of the former (14)* From 
the standpoint of the surface determination, two methods seem to be 
adapted to this work, especially for the finer sizes. These are the 
permeability method, and the adsorption method. The latter method has 
given good results in the hands of Emmett and his associates (15)and (16). 

The former method has been advanced by Carman (17), and is based on 
equations developed by Kozeny. It probably does not give the total 
specific area of particles as found by the latter method, especially 
if a liquid is used as the flowing medium - i.e. it will not measure 
the surface existing in very narrow cracks, or minute "caves” in the 
substance, open to the outside only by a narrow neck. But for many fuel

problems, e,g, ignition, this is an advantage since such openings do not 
come into the picture as the rate of diffusion of a gas into them is very 
small, and a liquid would not even enter many of the openings, A further 
advantage of the permeability method is its convenience. Determinations 
may be done quickly and easily, the apparatus is simple and inexpensive, 
and there are no complicated conditions to be set. The apparatus and 
method of procedure used in these tests are essentially the same as de¬ 
scribed by Oberholtzer (2), 

An increase in the surface area exposed will normally result in 
a greater reaction effect. One particular aspect will be considered 
under ignition temperature. 

The results of the specific surface determinations are given

These figures are given in square centimeters per cubic centimeter. 
That is they represent the aggregate surface area of the particles per 
cubic centimeter of the coal substance present. It was thought that there 
might be some difference between the surface areas of coals from different 
areas represented by the samples, due to any difference in the breakage 
characteristics of the coals. The figures above show no difference, but 
it is felt that before any conclusions can be definitely drawn, it would 
be necessary to use a very carefully controlled method of breakage and 
sieving for all samples. The size distribution of the particles which 
remain on any one sieve is so irregular in these series that any com¬ 
parisons cannot be made. 

With any one coal, arbitrary values of abscissae for each screen 
size can be chosen, such that the plot of specific surface against 
screen size gives a straight line. But if the other coals are plotted 
on the same scale, the relation is no longer a straight line. Such 
arbitrary values can be determined for the other coals, but as can be 
seen from Table XVII, there is no regularity in these numbers. It is 
therefore concluded, as stated above, that, the size distribution is 
quite irregular. 

(v) Ignition Temperature . Ignition temperature in a solid fuel is 
a complicated phenomena, with many factors involved, so thdt under prac¬ 
tical conditions no temperature may be measured and defined as ignition 
temperature. Laboratory tests can be devised and given exact specifica¬ 
tions whereby a temperature can be determined, which can be defined as 
the ignition temperature. -The arbitrary nature of such tests is shown 
by the wide variation in the results they give. For example, ignition 
temperatures as given on a particular sample tested here, by two different

methods, are given as 408°C and 173°C (18), Such laboratory tests do 
give a comparative indication of the ignition points of different coal 
samples, and are very useful, provided that their limitations are kept 
in mind* 

Two methods of making this determination will be discussed* In 
one method, developed at this laboratory, (19) a fairly coarse sample of 
coal is exposed to a current of heated air, and the temperature of the 
fuel bed noted, when one or more of the particles of coal catches fire 
within a short time limit. Conditions are carefully standardized* This 
test was designed to give a better correlation between actual ignition 
temperatures and laboratory results* The second method, developed by 
Wheeler (20), and modified by J. S. Charlesworth (unpublished) was the 
one used in these tests* By this test, the sample is heated from the 
outside and the temperatures of the coal sample and of the surrounding

medium are noted. A current of oxygen is passed through the bed of 
fuel. Normally, the temperature of the sample is the lower of the two, 
but as the heating goes on, the rate of reaction of the coal with oxygen 
increases notably, and the heat thus produced soon causes the temperature 
of the coal to catch up to and pass that of the surroundings. If the 
test were not stopped at this point, open combustion would soon result. 

The point at which the fuel temperature equals that of its surroundings 
is taken as the ignition temperature. A typical curve is shown in Fig. 
XXI. 

This method has been rather extensively used by other investigators, 

with good results. Sebastion and Mayers (21) used it in studies on coke 

reactivity, and by correlating the results with the Arrhenius equation, 

obtained a measure of the reactivities of various cokes. Sherman, Pilcher, 

and Ostborg (22), using this same method, did quite an extensive series 

of investigations on the ignition of bituminous coals. They used the 

Arrhenius equation to obtain their results. As applied to this work the 

equation takes the form: 

log l/p tan (a) = b-E/4.575 T 

p partial pressure of oxygen 

tan (a) slope of sample temperature curve at crossing point, 
deg. Gent, per minute 
b constant 

E Activation energy 

T degrees Kelvin. 

Results are expressed as Tl 5 or T 75 , which are temperatures at which 
the temperature of the sample crosses that of the furnace when the rates 
of rise of the sample temperature are 15 deg. and 75 deg. per minute, 
respectively. 

They found that the ignition temperature was not materially 


affected by:

They did find that the size and the specific surface of the parti¬ 
cles influenced the results, but for the same size of particles the method 
"seemed to measure an inherent characteristic of different fuels". 

Scott and Jones (23) did some studies on the effect of particle 
size on the rate of oxidation of anthracite. Though they did not de¬ 
termine ignition temperatures, this effect is closely related with the 
rate of oxidation. They found that below 400 deg. C. the rate of oxida¬ 
tion was determined by the velocity of the reaction between oxygen and 
the coal. For sizes below 20 mesh the initial rate of oxidation in¬ 
creased more slowly than the surface area did, and appeared to reach a 
maximum beyond which further subdivision of the particles had no effect. 

In studies on Alberta coals in this laboratory, it had previously 
been found that the ignition temperature was dependent on the size of 
the sample used, the rate of flow of oxygen through the bed, the rate 
of heating of the sample, the moisture in the sample, the initial tem¬ 
perature of the furnace, and of prime importance, the lag between the 
two temperatures during the initial heating period. Therefore these 
factors were as closely controlled as possible in the tests. The rate 
of heating was kept to 5 deg. Cent, per minute, the oxygen flow was kept 
at about 35 c.c. per minute, (under atmospheric pressure or but slightly 
higher) the same volume of sample was used in all cases, and the samples 
were dried for two hours at 108 deg. under vacuum. 

The results of the tests are shown in Table XVIII. A plot of the

EFFECT OF SIZE ON REPLICA IGNITION TEMPERATURE 
DETERMINATIONS

ignition temperatures against specific surface is shown in Fig. XXII. 

It will be seen that for the larger sizes the ignition point varies 
greatly with the surface, and then suddenly switches to show a very 
small variation with any surface area change. This agrees with the 
results of Scott and Jones (23)-, but does not agree with the findings 
of Sherman et al (22), who found that the ignition temperature varied 
linearly when plotted against the log of the specific surface. A 
number of attempts were made to find some linear relationship between 
the specific surface, but none were successful, so only a general 
statement will be mades - that the ignition temperature drops with 
increasing specific surface to a specific surface of 500-700 sq.cm./cu.cm, 
beyond which point any increase in the specific surface seems to have 
but little effect. 

The above facts would indicate that there is something else 
besides specific surface which affects the ignition point, or that 
there is something in the finer sizes which delays the ignition of 
the coal until the temperature is higher than it should be. The in¬ 
creased ash content of the finer sizes may have something to do with 
this. Having a higher heat conductivity than the coal particles, the 
ash particles might prevent the proper temperature rise of the sample. 
Further, any loose ash particles would tend to shield the fine coal 
particles from the stream of oxygen. 

The accuracy of this test is notably influenced by the size of 
the particles used. For a fine sample, the sample temperature curve 
runs parallel to the outside temperature curve for a time, and then 
swings suddenly upward to cut the upper line sharply. With coarse

material the temperature curve is a long sloping line, very gradually 
approaching the curve for the outside temperature. The two lines do not 
cut sharply, and they give a very uncertain value of the crossing point 
temperature. Even when a fairly satisfactory temperature can be deter¬ 
mined, duplicate results show poor checks. Results with samples above 
#14 mesh are very poor, with sizes between #14 and #65 mesh they seem to 
be doubtful, but below #65 mesh good results can be obtained. 

Table XIX gives some representative results. 

Sebastian and Mayers make reference to this increased error with 
larger o amp l e e . They suggest that the error with -12 +20 mesh samples is 
about 20%, with -20 +40 mesh samples about 5.8%, and with -40 +60 mesh 
samples about 5%. They offer the explanation that with large particles 
there is poor sampling of the temperature by the thermocouple tip, in¬ 
serted in the bed. These figures are higher than those from this series, 
but they do indicate the same trend. It might be noted that in the 
apparatus here the wire gauze, on which the sample lies, averages the tem¬ 
perature for the thermocouple. Sherman et al have calculated the error 
due to the apparatus and operator using their set-up (65 mesh samples) 
and find it to be about 2 degrees. This is more in line with the results 
obtained in this laboratory. 

The problem of the moisture in the coal is interesting, but little 
is known as far as Alberta coals are concerned. Previous work here had 
shown that the moisture did affect the results, so the present samples 
were heated in order to dry them. In spite of this, moisture collected 
inside the furnace - probably as a result of oxidation of the coal. TThat 
effect this has is unknown. Sherman claims that the moisture content of

"th© coal does not affect the results, since the sample is dried out anyhow 
in the course of raising the temperature. 

A very interesting phenomena" was observed in the course of the runs, 
particularly with the coarser samples. At quite a low temperature the 
temperature of the bed started to rise fairly sharply towards the furnace 
temperature, - in some cases even passing it, - and then levelled off to 
continue along a normal rise. This effect had previously been noted on 
this apparatus. It has been ascribed to an exothermic, low temperature 
reaction, of still doubtful nature. An interesting run was made on a 
sample, size -14 +28 mesh, which had shown this effect. Determined igni¬ 
tion temperatures were 193 and 199 deg. Cent. In the next run, the sample 
was raised to a temperature of 125 deg., and kept there for a period of 
ten minutes. During this time the outer temperature varied from 120-125 
degrees, as the heat input was varied in an effort to keep, the inside tem¬ 
perature constant. After ten minutes the oxygen supply was cut off and 
the furnace allowed to cool for two hours, after which heating was re¬ 
commenced. This time the determined ignition temperature was approxi¬ 
mately 245 degrees, or about 50 degrees higher than before. Only one test 
was made, but the difference in the ignition points was beyond experimental 
error. Earlier work (24) showed an increased ignition temperature after 
oxidation. An illustration of the above anomalous temperature rise is 
given in Fig. XXIII. There seems to be a general trend, as the size de¬ 
creases, for this effect to be ironed out. This chart also illustrates the 
gradual approach of the two temperature curves, and the resultant poor in¬ 
dication of the crossing temperature.

D. Conclusions . 

The conclusions only apply to the sizes studied. 

1. With coarse particles it is difficult to obtain satisfactory replica 
ash determinations. 

2. In a sized sample the finer sizes usually contain the higher ash 
content. 

3. Particle size does not affect the agreement of replica moisture 
determinations• 

4. The capacity moisture goes down with increasing fineness of the par¬ 
ticles, presumably because of the destruction of fissures in the particle. 

5. Specific gravity increases with fineness, partially at least, be¬ 
cause of increased ash. 

6. Ignition temperature goes down with increase in fineness, due- to 
the increase in specific surface. 

7. With coarse particles, it is difficult to obtain satisfactory 


replica ignition temperatures

CHAPTER HI 
OXIDATION AND PARTICLE SIZE 

A. Introduction . 

TJhile this chapter might well have been included in the previous 
chapter, it was felt that it was best to place it in a separate section 
since the work was on a separate sample, and since the test and procedure 
differed from those first described. 

During the routine analysis of a particular sample, (from Mine f56, 
Lethbridge area) it was found that the moisture values, determined one day, 
did not check with those determined a few days later. Normally some 
change is to be expected. Many laboratories have observed that a coal 
sample, stored in a tightly stoppered bottle, shows an increase in the 
determined moisture content. This increase is undoubtedly due to oxidation 
of the coal. In this case, though, the difference was far more than usual. 
It was therefore decided to run a series of oxidation tests, using two 
different ranges of particle size, on this coal. The real point at issue 
was this: 

^-"Does the extra-fine grinding used in this laboratory result in 
greater or less absolute accuracy, in contradistinction to merely better 
agreement between replicas?” 

The amount of literature on oxidation of coal is so vast that it 
would be impossible to give a reasonable summary of it in this paper. It 
is felt, however, that this investigation follows along a rather different 
path than usual, in the methods of analysis and the calculations. Some 
previous work done at this laboratory should be mentioned, as it has some 
direct bearing on this paper. In this earlier work, coal samples were 
exposed to an atmosphere of oxygen, and the oxygen absorption measured.

Calorific values were also determined. This procedure is the process of 
M slow combustion” which is later mentioned, and from which some calcula¬ 
tions were derived. An interesting result of this work was the finding 
that the heat liberated by slow, partial combustion of coals of different 
ranks, did not vary greatly when calculated on the basis of B.t.u. per 
pound of oxygen consumed; and that this value was of the same order as 
the heat liberated by the rapid, complete combustion of the coals calcu¬ 
lated on the same basis. 

B. Present W ork. 

For the test to be described a fresh sample was taken from Mine #56 
by the mine operators and sent to the laboratory in a pair of the usual 
quart sealers. A representative part of the sample was divided into two 
halves; one ground for 3/4 of an hour and the other for 3 hours. Previous 
tests had indicated that this would give two samples with specific sur¬ 
faces of approximately 5,000 sq.cm./cu.cm., and 10,000 sq.cm./cu.cm. After 
grinding, nine portions were weighed out for each of the six determinations 
to be made, or six sets of nine portions each. On three portions in each 
set, the required determinations were run immediately; on the next group 
of three portions, the determinations were made after a week in storage 
in a non-evacuated desiccator, which had an open stopper to allow free 
access of air. The desiccator contained a saturated solution of magnesium 
chloride to control the humidity, and was kept at 30°C. On the last group, 
tests were made after two weeks in similar storage. In some of the deter¬ 
minations, if two runs showed satisfactory duplication, the third portion 
was not utilized. Where possible, the portions -were weighed out directly 
into the crucibles or combustion boats to be used for the determination. 
Thus transference of samples from one container to another was kept at a

minimum* Capacity moisture determinations were made on the finely ground 
coal as above, before and after storage; but were also made on the fresh 
coal according to the usual procedure, on approximately 10 mesh material* 
Results are shown in the accompanying tables. 

Before any oxidized sample was used for a determination, the container 
and sample were re-weighed* Differences in weight from the original values 
are shown as weight changes in exposed samples. The proximate analyses 
are next indicated, followed by capacity moisture determinations* The 
next shown are the ultimate analyses. 

Table XXI gives a summary of the changes in weight of the various 
samples on exposure. It can be seen that the changes for the various de¬ 
terminations are not always comparable. This is probably due to the 
variations in the amount of material exposed for the tests, due to the 
differences in the shape of the vessels and the weights of the samples. 

The changes in the determined values of capacity, and total, moisture 
follow, and then the change in the proximate analyses, fuel ratio, and 
calorific value. 

An interesting calculation can be made on the basis of some of these 
results. It can be calculated from the calorific value and ultimate analysis 
that the hbat liberated, in complete combustion, per pound of oxygen used 
in the combustion, is 5,740 B.t.u. for this coal. Earlier work, referred 
to above, had indicated that a sample such as this would liberate 5,220 
B.t.u. per pound of oxygen on slow combustion. Using this latter value, 
it can be shown that the loss of 65 B.t.u. per pound of coal, shown in 
the tables, corresponds to an absorption of 1.25^ of oxygen. From the 
changes in the ultimate analysis an oxygen absorption of 2.00^ is indi¬ 
cated. These figures seem to be remarkably good checks, considering the

errors which can arise* As previously mentioned, there were great 
differences in the amounts of material exposed for the different de¬

checks* Small errors in these determinations will greatly affect the 
results•

This is indeed a remarkable check with the experimental values 
as found above* 

Examination of the table will show that in almost all cases the 
finer material (3 hr. grind) showed a higher change of value than did the 
coarse material. This is entirely as would be expected - any oxidation 
or moisture loss will take place more readily from the material with the 
higher surface area. One important exception is in the B.t.u. values. 

In this case the fine sample, over a one week period, showed a smaller 
drop than the coarse sample, and for the two week period the drop was 
practically the same. One possible explanation for the lesser oxidation 
shown in the two weeks storage than in the one week storage is that the 
desiccator used for the shorter storage permitted a more rapid air diffu¬ 
sion through the open stopper than did the other desiccator. 

Concerning the problem stated at the outset, with respect to fine¬ 
ness of grinding, it should be noted that in the routine procedure of 


















95 - 


the laboratory, the grinding is intermediate between the two values 
tested. All important determinations are made within two days of 
grinding, and exposure of the samples to air is reduced to a minimum, 
in contradistinction to the above tests, with free exposure to air for 
a longer period. Finally, the sample taken for test had been selected 
as one which was particularly susceptible to oxidation. It was con¬ 
cluded that the test failed to give clear evidence that the disadvan¬ 
tages of fine grinding out-weighed the advantages. Further tests should 
be made. 

The above work was only a very short investigation, but it indi¬ 
cates an interesting avenue for a new line of work. A number of sugges¬ 
tions for repetition have been made by Mr. Stansfield and may be found 

filed with the laboratory records of the investigation. 

The writer would like to express his thanks to Mr. W. A. Lang 
for his help with the analyses, and to Mr. E. Stansfield for calcu¬ 
lating the results.
