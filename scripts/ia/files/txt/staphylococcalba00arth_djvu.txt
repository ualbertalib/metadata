ABSTRACT 


Staphylococcal bacteriophage was studied to determine the limits 
which must be set on some of the factors influencing the propagation and 
maintenance of phage suspensions. Information obtained about these fac¬ 
tors was applied to the phage typing of Staphylococcus aureus strains 
isolated from various parts of Alberta, 

The most satisfactory method for the propagation of phage was found 
to be the method of Wilson and Atkinson (1945a;, b). Examination of 
various peptones in phage production showed neo-peptone to be superior to 
others. It was found that slight variations in temperature^ NaCl con¬ 
centration, pH etc, from those usual in the cultivation of bacteria did 
not, in themselves, greatly affect bacteriophage. It is concluded that 
the summation of such minor variations affects bacteriophage adversely. 

A total of 963 strains of Staphylococcus aureus was examined. In 
this investigation the nxmber of staphylococci which could be identified 
by phage typing was too restricted. Of the total number of staphylococci 
examined 53*79^ were non-typeable, 71*0>o of the bacterial strains typed 

were sensitive to phages 3A, 3B, 6, 31> 47 and the 6/47 pattern. The 
majority of phage typeable strains x^'/ere coagulase positive and penicillin 


resistant

INTRODUCTION AND REVIEW OF LITERATURE 









INTRODUCTION 


The majority of investigators working with bacterial viruses are 
interested in (a) the mechanism of the host-virus system, (b) the 
use of bacteriophage as a means of classifying and typing microorganisms 
and, (c) the application of the findings in the host-vLrus system to 
viruses infecting man* 

In starting this investigation, it became apparent that the lit¬ 
erature contained few reports which would afford sufficient information 
to a new worker in the field, in order that he might overcome the 
fundamental problems of propagation and maintenance of bacteriophage 
preparations. 

In view of this, the present investigation has been concerned, 
mainly, with the problems of propagation and maintenance of bacterio¬ 
phage. The experimental work has accordingly been reported under 
three main headings (a) factors influencing the propagation of 
bacteriophage, (b) factors influencing the maintenance of bacterio¬ 
phage preparations and, (c) the application of bacteriophage pre¬ 
parations in identifying the most frequently encountered types of 
Staphylococcus aureus in Alberta. 

There is general agreement, at the present time, that the bacter¬ 
iophage principle of Twort and d*Herelle is a group of filterable 
viruses which are closely related to animal viruses. 

Bacteriophages are found to be parasitic upon specific bacteria, 
generally on a particular species. Since most of the bacteriophages 
and their hosts may be cultivated with comparative ease, and since 
they can both be assayed with high precision, they have become models 
of the host-virus relationship. The bacterial viruses have been used

in test systems in the search for likely chemotherapeutic and anti¬ 
biotic agents for virus diseases, in the study of ultra-violet light 
and X-radiation effect on viinises, in the study of the virus interfer¬ 
ence phenomenon and in the study of mutational patterns of both bacteria 
and viruses. 

Bacteriophage action has been noted in various groups of bacteria 
such as streptococci, nycobacteria, actinomycetes, corynebacteria, 
staphylococci, shigella, proteus, vibrio, salmonella, aerobacter and 
escherichia. Such action, however, has not been encountered in yeasts, 
molds, algae or protozoa. Extensive studies have been made of certain 
groups of bacteriophages such as the coli phages (Anderson 194S, Cohen 
1950 ), coli-dysentery and salmonella phages (Burnet 1934)? cholera phages 
(Asheshov 1933)? staphylococcal phages (Northrop 1937? Wilson and 
Atkinson 1945? and Fisk 1942) and tsrphoid phages (Craigie and Yen 193^a, 
1938b). 

d*Herelle (1918a, 1926) believed that bacteriophages are ultra- 
microscopic parasites capable of invading susceptible bacterial cells, 
multiplying therein and in time lysing the invaded cells. 

He reasoned that bacteriophage could therefore be used to treat 
disease. Experience has shown that some success can be attained by 
using large doses of specific bacteriophage to protect experimental 
animals under limited conditions (Asheshov et al 1937? Ward 1943)? 
but for the most part, therapeutic use of bacteriophage has met with 
failure. It is possible that increased knowledge of the bacteriophage- 
bacterium reaction and improved techniques may achieve more favourable 
results than have been obtained to date. The successful application 
of bacteriophage to the treatment of disease must wait, in part, for

the answer to how it acts upon bacteria 



REVIEW OF LITERATURE 


Ivanowsky (1S92) reporting on the mosaic disease of tobacco plants, 
recorded what is believed to be the first direct evidence of the exist¬ 
ence of a causative agent of disease which apparently passed through 
a filter that retained bacteria. Some seven years later Beijerinck 
(1899) repeated Ivanowsky*s experiment and confirmed that the agent of 
this disease was indeed filterable. About the same time, Loeffler and 
Frosch (1898) showed that the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease 
was also filterable and the existence of submicroscopic agents of 
disease was established, 

Twort ( 1915 ) noticed that transparent areas, free from bacterial 
growth, occured in a culture of a Micrococcus . Upon touching one of the 
clear areas with a loop and then streaking it over a ciilture made with 
the same strain of Micrococcus he found that further clear transparent 
areas developed along the line of streaking. He also found that when 
material from the transparent areas was placed in broth and the broth 
then passed through a Berkefeld filter, the filtrate contained a sub¬ 
stance capable of causing transparent areas similar to those first noted. 

d'Herelle (1917), independently of Twort, observed the same phenom¬ 
enon while investigating bacillary dysentery. He named the lytic 
principle bacteriophage. The term ^bacteriophage” is usually referred 
to simply as phage and means literally ”bacteria«consuffiing agent”. He 
argued that the lytic principle was a single living entity. Protobios 
bacteriophagum . which had the ability to become adapted to different 
bacteria, including different species. 

Evidence has since accumulated to show that not one but many 
different phages exist. d'Herelle found that small clear areas formed

in a sheet of bacterial growth, when phage had been applied to the 
original inoculum, and these areas, once formed, remained unchanged. 

He named these areas plaques. He also demonstrated that the number of 
plaques formed was directly proportional to the amount of phage used 
(d*Herelle 191Sb). On the basis of this observation he devised a 
technique to estimate the number of phage particles present in any sus¬ 
pension (d'Kerelle 1920a). This method is still used at the present 
time. He further contended that phage particles are adsorbed to the 
bacterial cells, that multiplication of phage occurs within the bac¬ 
terial cell and that the liberation of phage particles into the 
surrounding medium is due to the lysis of the bacterial cell. These 
contentions have been confirmed by many present-day investigators.

The Source of Phage 

Although bacteriophage has not been found free in nature, it has 
been shown to be present in such materials as throat washings, soil, 
feces, urine, sewage, and river water (d*Herelle 1926; Gardner and 
Weiser 1947; Bottcher and Hofer 1943; Smith and Jordon 1931). The iso¬ 
lation of phage is usually attempted from materials where host organ¬ 
isms are likely to be numerous. These materials may be human or animal 
excreta, soil, or exudates from disease processes. 

In general, the technique followed is that of filtering the sample 
material to get rid of the bacteria and then mixing the filtrate with 
bacterial strains in order to test for phage activity. If no phage 
activity results the mixture is again filtered and added to a dilute 
suspension of organisms. This procedure is repeated a number of times 
in order to allow any active phages to multiply. After several pass¬ 
ages, the final filtrate is plated in varying dilutions with the host 
cells on solid media. Lytic activity is shown by the appearance of 
small clear areas in the sheet of bacterial growth. 

A second method of obtaining phage makes use of the fact that some 
bacteria are carriers of phage. Bacteria of this type are said to be 
lysogenic, and are completely resistant to the strain of phage which they 
carry. However, the carried phage, called a latent phage, will causa 
lysis to occur if brought into contact with susceptible host cells. 

Bacteria >rtiich are susceptible to this type of phage are referred to as 
indicator strains. It is common practice to isolate these phages by placing 
various strains of bacteria on each other or by spotting the filtrate of 
one culture on a second organism. Following incubation, these so-called 
latent phages are evidenced by the occuj^nce of plaques, vhere the two

bacterial strains have come into contact or where the filtrate of one 
has been placed on the second bacterial strain (Fisk 1942a). 

Phage has been isolated for such a large number of different bac¬ 
teria that it seems reasonable to assume that further investigation 
might well reveal that most, if not all, bacteria are susceptible to 
phage action.

The Ori^n of Phage 

Consideration of the nature of phage has resulted in two general 
theories; first, that phage is a living entity, existing at the expense 
of the bacterium, and second, that phage is a non-living entity which 
can produce more of itself when in contact with susceptible organisms, 
from which it is derived, 

Clifton ( 1950 ) believes that the lack of a comprehensive definition 
of "life” makes it difficult to distinguish between animate and inanimate 
matter. 

In support of the second theory it may be said that phage apparent¬ 
ly lacks an independent metabolism (Kreuger 1936). 

Several authors (Blair 1924; Kuttner 1920; LeMar and Myers 1935) 
have defended the second theory but their evidence cannot be considered 
as conclusive, particularly in view of the fact that a great number of 
bacteria are lysogenic or phage-carrying strains. For exanple. Smith 
and Jordan (1931) showed that many strains of diphtheria bacilli were 
lysogenic toward an indicator strain of the same species, Burnet (1932) 
found that 93 130 stock Salmonella strains regularly produced phages 

which were capable of lysing one of three bacterial indicator strains 
which were highly phage susceptible. It rests then that attempts to 
prove that phage can be derived from phage-free bacterial strains must 
be prefaced by proof that the bacterial strain in question is not carry¬ 
ing latent phage. Otherwise, the sudden appearance of a latent phage, 
or even phage contaminating the suspension under examination, may be 
mistaken for the generation of phage "de novo”. Difficulties involved 
here are evidenced by the fact that phage may be picked up by contamina¬ 
tion during mechanical manipulation from such unlikely material as dust

(Colvin 1932 ), or even during filtration of suspensions through candles 
(Beard 1931)♦ It seems reasonable to demand that any technique in 
support of this theory should be regularly effective on all bacterial 
types known to be naturally phage-susceptible. 

In support of the first theory it is undoubtedly true that phages 
do multiply at the e:q)ense of bacteria; they do have antigenic proper¬ 
ties, and though not always true, antigens are typically proteins. In 
view of the fact that living material is composed largely of proteins, 
the antigenicity of phage favours the theory that phage is a living 
entity. Schlesinger*s (1934) report favours this theory, his analysis 
of what is claimed to be a purified phage, indicates that it has a 
protein structure. 

Bauer (1952) in reviewing the metabolic aspects of virus multiplica¬ 
tion states, 

“It may be assumed, so far as is known at present, that viruses do 
not posses any independent enzyme activities of their own”. 

This statement appears to support the opinion, of most contemporary 
investigators, that phage has a bacterial origin. 

Clifton ( 1950 ) noted that, 

“Some phages have been shown to posses definite head-and-tail-like 
structures with possible differentiation within the head” 

and concludes that the structure of some phage suggests, 

“an organismal rather than a molecular type of configuration”•

General Properties 

The extensive literature v^ich has grown since the discovery of 
the Twort-d*Herelle phenomenon reveals that bacteriophages share many 
properties with the animal and plant viruses. Some of the facts re¬ 
garding the behaviour of the lytic agent are as follows: 

(a) The lytic principle may be separated, from the organisms 
upon which it acts, by filtration throu^ a candle. It is usually a 
spherical particle whose diameter varies between 10 and 90jni. 

(b) The lytic principle, when injected into an experimental 
animal, acts as an antigen. 

(c) The lytic principle acts only in the presence of actively 
growing cultures of bacteria. 

(d) The lytic principle may produce an interference effect toward 
a second lytic principle. 

(e) The lytic principle is usually active against only one bacterial 
species, it may, however, be active against closely related bacterial 
species but quite inactive against unrelated species. The activity range, 
on first isolation, may be quite wide and the bacteriophage, following 
serial propagation with a selected species of organism, may increase in 
activity toward that particular organism while losing affinity toward 
other bacterial strains. 

(f) Bacterial strains normally susceptible to the action of 
specific phage may give rise to variant strains which are completely 
resistant to the lytic principle involved. 

(g) The lytic principle acts on bacteria in such a way as to bring 
about the lysis of the susceptible bacterial cells, or it may rest in 

a latent state within the host.

Size and Morphology 

Prior to the introduction of the electron microscope, the size of* 
bacterial viruses was estimated by comparing the ability of the virus 
and other materials, of known size, to pass through filters of known 
porosity. d’Herelle (1926) determined that the size of phage was about 
the same as that of a serum albumin molecule. He arrived at this con¬ 
clusion by showing that phage particles could pass through filters that 
albumin passed through and that both were stopped by filters of identic¬ 
al porosity. 

Elford and Andrewes (1932) were able to conclude, by diffusion ex¬ 
periments through collodion membranes, that staphylococcal phages range 
in size between 8 and They also determined that particles of one 

phage appeared to be uniform in size and not to vary when the phages are 
grown on different organisms. Probably their most interesting conclusion 
was that the size of a phage particle is an important factor in controll¬ 
ing the size of the resulting plaque, small phages tending to give rise 
to large plaques on agar, and conversely. 

Schlesinger (1933) using the high speed centrifuge sedimentation 
rate and Wollman and Lacassonge (1940) using the inactivation of phage 
by X-radiation determined that the size of phage particles lay between 
20 and 50}i}i. 

The introduction of the electron microscope made available a method 
for more accxirate evaluation of phage particle size and also a means of 
establishing the morphology of particles, 

Ruska (1941) showed phage particles to vary from club-shape to rod- 
shape in structure, Anderson (1943) reported that some phage particles 
have heads 30-90}ip in diameter, and tail-like structures varying in 
length up to 250]i|i and in width up to 20|ip. To date, no particular

piirpose has been shown for the presence of the phage particle tail* 

Examination of phage particles by the electron microscope has re¬ 
vealed that the particles of any particular phage have a constant size 
and morphology, though different strains vary both in size and morphology.

Antigenicity of Phages 

Bordet and Ciuca (1921) first reported that phage is antigenic and 
it has been repeatedly confirmed that antisera against phage can be pre¬ 
pared by animal inoculation. 

The reactions between phage and antiphage serum are similar to those 
shown in other antigen antibody systems. The serological specificity 
of phages, however, is not related to the bacteria on which they are 
grown (Gratia 1922). * 

The combination of phage and antibody may be demonstrated by (a) 
phage particle agglutination; (b) neutralization of phage; and (c) 
agglutination of bacteria, on which phage has been adsorbed, by anti¬ 
phage sera. The neutralization of phage by antiserum is specific and by 
means of neutralization tests phages can be classified serologically 
(Burnet 1933). 

Andrewes and Elford (1933a) showed that such neutralization of 
phage by antiserum follows the percentage law. They found that a given 
strength of antiserum acting for a constant time will neutralize a 
constant percentage of phage. 

The fact that a phage-antibody combination may still adsorb to the 
host cell surface suggests that the receptor spots on the surface of the 
phage particle are of two kinds, one set designed to combine with anti¬ 
body and the other set designed to combine with the bacteria (Andrewes 
and Elford 1933b). This opinion influenced Burnet, Keo^ and Lush 
(1937) to conclude that occasional phages which are unrelated serologic¬ 
ally may act on the same bacterial species and, similarly, that serolog¬ 
ically related phages may have a different host range.

Growth Properties of Phage 


Adsorption 

Upon being added to sensitive bacteria, phage particles are adsorbed 
to the surface of the organisms. Such adsorption is thought to be a 
combination of complementary chemical groupings on the surface of the 
bacterial cell and on the surface of the phage (Burnet 1937^ Delbruck 
1942 , and Putman 1950). Adsorption in some systems may be assisted by 
the presence of certain anirao acids (Anderson 1945) and calcium ions 
(Delbruck 194S), Kreuger (1939), vfcile investigating the phenomenon, 
arrived at the conclusion that the presence of electrolyte was a necess¬ 
ary factor for adsorption. 

Phage adsorption need not occur only on living bacteria. Kreuger 
( 1931 ) showed that dead bacteria can adsorb phage irreversibly and 
Evans (1944) found that phage may be adsorbed on dead bacteria although 
no phage growth occurs after adsorption takes place. 

Although it is generally true that phage is not adsorbed by resis¬ 
tant bacterial variants of the parent strain, Burnet and Lush (1935) 
noted that certain staphylococci, v^ich did not support the multiplica¬ 
tion of the staphylococcal phage used, readily adsorbed the phage. 

Craigie (1946) found that mutants of Type II typhoid Vi phage were 
adsorbed by phage resistant Vi types of Salmone3J.a typhosa as well as 
by the sensitive strains. He pointed out that lytic specificity depends 
not on specificity of adsorption, but on some specific factor in the 
host cell that determines penetration and multiplication of the virus. 

Henry and Henry (1946) were able to obtain resistant variants of a 
Staph, aureus strain which were able to adsorb phage as readily as the 
susceptible parent strain of the organism.

Anderson (1949) noted that phage adsorption does not occur when mix¬ 
tures of phage and bacteria are violently agitated. This suggests that 
the agitation prevents a steric fitting from taking place. Such a prop¬ 
osition requires consideration when observing techniques employed in 
estimating the number of phage particles present in a suspension, for, 
such techniques involve the making of dilutions and the tendency is to 
agitate the suspensions in order assure thorough mixing. 

Invasion 

Following adsorption of phage, on the cell wall of the host, lysis 
may occiir in one of two ways. 

(a) Lysis from without . This type of lysis usually occurs when a 
large number of phage particles attach themselves to the bacterial cell 
and cause the cell to be lysed. There is no increase in phage particles 
at the expense of the host cell and there is no apparent penetration of 
the cell wall by the phage partiales. Such lysis is termed ’’lysis from 
without” (Delbriick 1940). When conditions are varied, it is found that 
lysis from without (LFW) may occur when only a small number of phage 
particles are present. Cohen (1950) found that a small number of phage 
particles could cause LFW in the presence of cyanide. By placing the 
host-virus complex in the presence of dinitrophenol, Doermann (194^) 
found that the same thing occured. 

Kreuger (1939) is of the opinion that the spontaneous clearing of 
some bacterial stock cultures may be due to LFW. 

(b) Lysis from within . Lysis of this type occurs following the 
entry of one or more phage particles into the bacterium. The dissolu¬ 
tion of the host cell is sudden and only occurs after the phage particles, 
within the bacterial cell, have greatly increased in numbers. Upon the

dissolution of the cell, the phage particles are released into the 
surrounding mediunio The number of phage particles present within the 
cell at the time of the release of phage is referred to as the burst 
size. 

Kreuger and Northrop (1930) and Northrop (1937) have determined, 
while investigating staphylococcal bacteriophage, that a ratio of 1:125 
must exist between the host cell and virus before the critical level, 
required for lysis to occur, has been reached. They feel that lysis 
should be considered as the result of phage activity and that adsorption, 
invasion, and multiplication of the phage particles is of more importance 
in the study of the host-virus complex than is lysis.

Multiplication 

When phage is added to a bacterial culture on the surface of an 
agar plate, under optimal conditions, and an incubation period is allow¬ 
ed to elapse, small clear areas, plaques, are found to form in the sheet 
of bacterial growth. Although a plaque may be produced by a single phage 
particle, it is probable that many plaques result from multiple infect¬ 
ion of one bacterium by a number of phage particles. Phage increases 
most rapidly in young cultures in which bacteria are found to be in 
the logarithmic phase of growth. 

This increase in phage occurs in sudden jumps, each jump following 
a latent period of some^O^UO minutes after adsorption of phage on the 
cell wall (Downie 1950). Presumably this coincides with the "bursting" 
of infected cells when the new phage particles attack fresh cells and 
the whole process is repeated. The sudden increase in phage particles 
following a latent period has been investigated by Ellis and Delbruck 
(1939) by means of "one step growth experiments". 

Briefly, this technique enables an investigator to determine quan¬ 
titatively the latent period of intracellular virus growth and the burst 
size. The latent period is the minimum length of time from adsorption 
of the virus to the lysis of the host cell; the burst size is the average 
yield of phage per infected host cell. The method involves the remov¬ 
al of portions of a phage-host mixture at various intervals of time and 
the determination of the plaque count. 

As plaque counts are made at various times and plotted against 
time, a one step growth curve results. The curve is composed of three 
parts, (a) a latent period (time from initial infection until lysis 
begins to occur)j(b) a rise period (time during ^ich lysis occurs).

and (c) a final stationary period (showing the concentration of phage 
following lysis of the initieilly infected cells). 

It is interesting to note that the latent period does not vary, 
regardless of whether the host cells are singly or multiply infected 
by phage particles (Luria and Delbruck, 1942b). 

The potentialities of the one step growth curve in studying the 
effects of salts, nutrients, inhibitors and other chemical agents on 
the multiplication of phage have scarcely been realized and further 
work along these lines should bring to light many facts which are at 
present unknown or in doubt. 

The most striking event which follows the adsorption of phage on 
the bacterial cell wall is, probably, the “loss’* of phage as an infect¬ 
ious unit. Luria (1947) argues that once a phage particle penetrates a 
host cell, the phage breaks down into small genetic units and following 
a short incubation period these units undergo a recombination into new 
phage particles. Lwoff (1950) has furthered this proposition and this 
will be discussed in the section titled “Lysogenesis”. 

Doermann (1950) using cyanide to arrest the growth of T phages 
infecting E, coli , caused the bacteria to be lysed by adding an excess 
of a second phage type. T6 was used to cause lysis. The growth of 
other T phages was assayed by plating with E. coli strain B/6, which 
Doermann says, "is specifically and totally resistant to T6, all other 
phages used formed plaques when plated against B/6’’. Using the above 
technique, he determined that no material which can initiate phage 
activity in new host cells can be obtained from the infected organism 
until the middle of the latent period between infection and lysis. 

This is thought to be the point in phage multiplication when recombina-

tion of phage characters among related phages, which have entered into 
a mixed infection, occurs. Doermann also determined that the first 
phage extractable around the middle of the latent period already con¬ 
tained an appreciable proportion of recombinant particles, in an amount 
not much lower than that present following natural lysis. 

Wyckoff (1949) in reporting his investigation of E. coli and Tl, 
T 2 , and T 3 phages, with the electron microscope, stated; 

"Electron micrographs show that the bacterial membranes rupture 
very soon after adsorption of bacteriophage and that colonies of new 

phage particles rapidly appear in the protoplasmic masses.the 

observed phenomena are those to be expected of particles behaving as 
if they were minute microorganisms multiplying by division at the 
expense of the bacterial protoplasm." 

It would seem reasonable to assume that chemical substances re¬ 
quired to build new phages are provided by (a) host cell materials, 

(b) materials present in the sxirrounding medium, possibly introduced 
by the infecting phage, and (c) that part of the new phage material 
is synthesized after infection^

Interference and Mutual Exclusion 

If two phages are added to a bacterial strain which is sensitive to 
both, but one of those phages is added a short time before the other, 
then it is found that the phage which is added first excludes the action 
of the second. Should both the phages be added at the same time it will 
be found that only one of the phages will increase in numbers. This 
phenomenon is said to be one of “interference, or mutual exclusion". 

Luria and Delbriick (1942) suggested that the mutual exclusion 
phenomenon is similar to that encountered in the completion of an enzyme 
system. This hypothesis is based on their observations with T^ and T^ 
phages of Escherichia coli and they believe that the condition is one of 
competition for the completion of the host-virus complex. 

It is sometimes found that the exclusion process favours one of a 
pair of phages employed. In infections of E. coli with phages T^ and 
T 2 > Delbriick (1945) found that T 2 excluded T^ in almost all trials. 

The excluded phage, however, often decreases the yield of 
the phage i«diich infects the organism. Delbriick (1945) calls this the 
“depressor effect". 

This phenomenon is not clearly understood, but it is generally 
held that one phage must enter the bacterial cell in order to exclude a 
second phage.

Nutritional Requirements for Phage Growth 

In a review of the literature and an analysis of the evidence 
Kreuger (1936) concluded that phage apparently lacks an independent 
metabolism. 

Fowler and Cohen (1947, 194B) investigating the usage of amino acids 
during the multiplication of T phages infecting E. coli were able to 
determine that the following laevo types increased phage production, 
L-isoleucine, L-phenylalanine, L-aspartic, L-lysine, L-proline, 

L-valine, L-arginine, and L-glutamic. Of these amino acids, L-glutamic 
was found to have the greatest effect. L-leucine, L-serine and L-cystine 
all exhibited inhibitory effects. Th^ also determined (194S) that 
ribose nucleic acid (RNA) and desoxyribonucleic acid (DRNA) increased 
the burst size. Cohen (1950), investigating E. coli and T phage, de¬ 
termined that dicarboxylic acid is removed from the medium by uninfected 
cells while infected cells remove monoamino monocarboxylic acids. This 
indicates that DRNA S 3 mthesis is valuable as an estimate of phage growth. 

Cohen (1950, 1951) working with £. coli (strain B) infected with T 
phages determined that the energy for phage synthesis, amino acids, and 
nucleic acid components, which may be non-specific building materials, 
are provided by the metabolic equipment of the host cell as it existed 
at the moment of infection. For example, in the synthesis of phage T 
at least about 80% of the phosphorus of its DRNA comes from the host 
(Labaw 1951). The phosphorus and various aromatic bases from host DRNA 
are transmitted in different proportions to phage DRNA. This suggests 
that these substances are broken down at or below the nucleotide level 
before being utilized for phage synthesis (Kozloff, Putman, and Evans 
1950).

Phage Specificity 

Most phages are found to be active against one particular strain 
of one species of organism or against a small number of closely related 
species, but not against unrelated species, Delbruck (1942) believes 
that receptor spots exist on the bacterial cell and that specific phage 
particles can attach themselves to these spots. He feels that the 
relationship between these receptor spots and the phage is similar to 
the antigen-antibody reaction. 

Burnet (1932) and Delbruck (1942) both associate these receptor 
spots with bacterial heat-stable polysaccharides, Burnet found that 
the bacterial constituents, to which the phage is adsorbed, are not 
destroyed by heating for one hour at lOO^C, It is found that polysac¬ 
charides isolated from bacterial extracts are able to inactivate the 
phage, (White 1936, Freeman 1937). 

Considerable work has been carried out to show that there is a 
close relationship between phage action and the ajitigenic make-up of 
the bacterial cell attacked (Burnet 1927, 1929; Graigie and Brandon 
1936 ; Graigie and Yen 1936), 

Burnet and Freeman (1934) suggested that the surface of phage con¬ 
sists of a mosaic of receptor sites and that some of these are used for 
their attachment to specific bacteria, vfeile others are used for the 
attachment of antibody. If this is valid it would seem to explain why 
phage active on one genus of organisms cannot be trained to become 
active on a second genus of organisms.

Host Cell Mutations 

When a phage and a susceptible bacterial host are plated together 
on an agar plate and then incubated for an appropriate period of time, 
secondary bacterial growth sometimes occurs in the lysed areas. This 
secondary bacterial growth is resistant to the phage strain which has 
caused the lysis and is the result of a bacterial mutation. It is in¬ 
teresting to note that the bacterial mutant may be sensitive to the 
action of other related phages to which the original organism was re¬ 
sistant, but, the bacterial mutant generally does not adsorb the phage 
to which the original organism was sensitive.(Downie 1950) 

Two theories have been advanced for the phenomenon of bacterial 
mutations as a result of association with phage. d'Herelle (1920b) 
believed that the bacterial mutants are phage induced, i.e., the re¬ 
sistant bacterial strains are a result of adaptation and have acquired 
immunity to action of the phage through association. Gratia (1921) 
and Burnet (1929) believed that the bacterial mutations occur^d in the 
culture before contact with phage was made. 

Luria and Delbruck (1943) felt that there were two possible explan¬ 
ations, (a) the bacterial mutants are attacked by phage particles and 
survive phage action, and (b) the mutants are resistant to phage action 
prior to the addition of phage and no host-phage reaction takes place. 
They concluded that the mutations occur naturally and independently of 
the presence of phage. This, of course, means that the mutant’s resist¬ 
ance is due to a natural genetic change in the steric fittings on the 
cell surface which are necessary for phage adsorption to occur. 

Burnet and MacKie (1933) and Demerec and Fano (1945) followed this 
reasoning in developing cross-resistance tests to differentiate between

phages. 

Since mutant bacteria, surviving the action of a phage, are 
generally resistant to that phage and closely related ones, but may not 
be resistant to unrelated phages which are able to lyse the original 
strain, a differentiating criterion between phages exists. 

The current designation of such bacteria is that of Demerec and 
Fano (1945), and is arrived at by following the number of the resist¬ 
ant culture with the number of the phage to which it is resistant^ for 
instance a bacterial mutant of susceptible strain X, now resistant to its 
phage Y, is written X/Y. 

Oakberg and Luria (1947) found evidence which led them to conclude 
that the resistance of Staph, aureus to penicillin and sulfonamides is 
sometimes arrived at by mutation and selection similar to that found in 
phage resistant mutations.

Phage Mutations 

A phenomenon similar to bacterial mutations sometimes occurs with 
phage* When a large amount of phage is plated with an organism normally 
resistant to action by the phage, one occasionally finds that a few 
plaques are formed* It is thou^t that receptor spots on the phage 
surface undergo a change and thereby permit the phage to assume a steric 
fitting with the receptor spots on the normally resistant bacterial 
strain, therefore a phage mutation has occurred. Tlie phage mutant is 
now unable to lyse the original susceptible bacterial strain. 

Such phage mutations have been described by Burnet and Lush (1936), 
Craigie and Yen (l93Sb) and Luria (1946). They showed that phage can 
change its host specificity by attaining the ability to lyse bacterial 
strains which were previously resistant to the phage. 

The best known application of phage mutation is that developed 
by Craigie and Yen (l93Ba, 1942) with Type II ?i phage idiich attacks 
the V form of S* typhosa * They found that each time a high concentra¬ 
tion of the phage was grown with a different strain of S* typhosa a 
small amount of the phage adapted itself to the new strain and lost its 
ability to lyse the last strain of S* typhosa that had been used. In 
this way a series of phages was isolated and with them different strains 
of typhoid bacilli may be distinguished* 

Such phage mutations are not confined to bacterial viruses, but, 
can also be detected in certain plant viruses* Jensen (1937) was able 
to obtain some 50 mutants of the tobacco mosaic virus by employing a tech¬ 
nique similar to that described above.

Latent Phages 

While investigating bacteriophage action in relation to S. typhosa , 
Craigie (1946) reported that some strains of the bacterium carry phage 
in a latent state. He named the strains "gamma strains" and stated 
that some 10^ of S, typhosa may carry a latent phage. Lytic activity 
is not commonly shown by this kind of phage on its homologous type 
strain of bacterium, and other strains of the organism are usually used 
in order to isolate the phage, 

Burnet and Lush (1936) and Craigie (1946) obtained evidence which 
indicates that such bacteriophage may occur as mutants which can revert 
to their original form and lyse the normally resistant parent. These 
latent agents are difficult to isolate, propagate, and maintain, due to 
their instability. 

In the present investigation some 43 strains of Staphylococcus 
aureus (4.52^ of the total strains examined) showed evidence of latent 


phage

Lysogenesis 

Delbruck (1946), in an attempt to differentiate between the pres¬ 
ence of latent phage in bacteria and true lysogenicity, defined the 
latter as not involving lysis of the host cell, 

den Dooren de Jongh(1930, 1931) isolated and described a strain 
of Bacillus megatherium which seems to be truly lysogenic. Spores from 
this culture can be heated to a temperature which will destroy free 
bacteriophage and yet, upon germination of the spores, bacteria are 
truly lysogenic. 

Virus free colonies of this culture have not been demonstrated by 
the usual plating methods and, in contrast to organisms carrying latent 
phage, no report has been made of this strain showing spontaneous lysis. 

Free phage may be demonstrated by placing the filtrate of a broth 
ciilture of a lysogenic organism in contact with a suitable indicator 
strain of organism. Hadley and Okuda (1924), Smith and Jordan (1931) 
and Burnet (1932) have shown that a large number of bacterial strains 
are lysogenic. 

Delbruck (1942) points out that reverse mutations may cause con¬ 
fusion between the carrying of latent phage and true lysogenicity. 

Should a phage resistant lysogenic bacterium throw off sensitive mutants 
these will show evidence of phage action and may suggest that latent 
phage was initially present.

Nature of the Phenomenon 


The nature of lysogenesis has been investigated since a lysogenic 
strain of E. coli was first described by Lisborne and Carrere (1922). 

Burnet and MacKie (1929) concluded that the phage or its ’’anlage” 
is a part of the hereditary constitution of the organism and that it 
must be present in each cell of the culture. The '‘arJage” has been de¬ 
fined as the intracellular form of phage by Wollmann (193^) and as the 
probacteriophage by Lwoff and Gutmann (1950). 

Lwoff and his co-workers have reviewed the problem of lysogenesis 
and presented papers which are most thought* provoking. Their work 
has done much to open new fields in the study of the host-virus relation¬ 
ship. 

L;^raff and Gutmann (1950) followed one cell of B. megatherium 
through 19 divisions, never observing lysis or demonstrating free bac¬ 
teriophage, yet all cells of the 19th generation were lysogenic. 

Lwoff ( 1952 ) states, 

”If lysogenic specimens of B. megatherium are brought into contact 
with the bacteriophages which they produce, the latter are adsorbed 
but the bacteria nevertheless continue to develop. Lysogenic bacteria 
are evidently resistant to the bacteriophages which they themselves 
liberate. In ordinary systems, the mutants which are resistant to a 
given bacteriophage do not adsorb it, and from a purely practical point 
of view, they could be described as impermeable. The resistance of a 
lysogenic bacterium is obviously of a different character, for here the 
bacterium is penetrated by the bacteriophage; this resistance represents 
a kind of immunity”. 

He further postulates that lysogenic bacteria perpetuate specific 
particles, the probacteriophages, which are non-infective, non-pathogenic, 
and cannot be demonstrated with the electron microscope. He considers 
probacteriophages to be building blocks through which bacteriophages 
are built. Should the probacteriophages develop into bacteriophages, 
then the bacteriophages may be liberated by bacterial degeneration and

lyse sensitive bacteria. He believes that lysogenic bacteria pass on, 
by heredity, the power of producing bacteriophages. 

After adsorption and prior to lysis, phage enters the bacterial 
cell and apparently disappears. Lwoff claims that the phage disinte¬ 
grates into a number of probacteriophage particles, and this action 
coincides with the ’’dark period” during vdiich no phage particles 
have been demonstrated with the electron microscope. 

The probacteriophage, Lwoff claims, is, or contains, a specific 
particle endowed with genetic continuity, which seems to behave as a 
normal endocellular particle but can, under certain conditions, be 
transformed into a bacteriophage. 

The work of Lwoff and his co-workers has been confirmed and ex¬ 
tended by Clarke and Cowles (1952) and Clarke (1952).

Application of Bacteriophage 
Treatment of Disease 

Opinion is divided on the value of bacteriophage in the treatment 
of disease. This is probably due to the fact that the results so far 
reported are vd.dely varied. 

d’Herelle (1926) first reported the use of phage in the treatment 
of disease. He claimed to have achieved great success in the use of 
phage for the treatment of bacillary dysentery, stapnylococcal infect¬ 
ions and fowl typhoid. Unfortunately other workers (Compton 192B; 

Pyle 1926 ; Clark et al 192?) met with little success when they attempted 
to use phage in the treatment of infections caused by Pasteurella pestis 
in rats and mice, S. pullor\3m in chickens and haemolytic streptococci 
in rabbits. The results of these workers discouraged other investiga¬ 
tors and interest in such use of phage did not revive until some years 
later. 

Compton ( 1944 ) claimed that bacteriophage could be used prophylac- 
tically in bacillary dysentery; Fisk (193^) and Morton and Perez (1945) 
showed that administration of phage to mice within 3-4 hours after an 
infecting dose of typhoid organisms, offered considerable protection. 

Desranleau (194^) reported the successful application of a polji^^hage 
of S. typhosa (types 1, 11, 111, and IV) to the treatment of 19 cases of 
typhoid fever. 

The major difficulties in using bacteriophage for the treatment of 
disease appear to be threefold, (a) body fluids such as serum, urine, 
cerebrospinal fluid and pus, inhibit the action of phage; (b) the 
phage used in the treatment of disease must be specific for the infect¬ 
ing strain of organism and, (c) great difficulty is usually encountered

ient quantity* 

Typing Bacteria 

Bacteriophage has been used to differentiate between closely re¬ 
lated species of bacteria and also to differentiate between strains of 
a given species. Such typing of bacterial strains has considerable 
epidemiological value as was shown by Craigie and Yen (I93^b), during 
an epidemic of typhoid fever. Information of great value is obtained 
by phage typing when strain differences cannot be shown by serological 
means. The onployment of bacteriophage for the identification of bac¬ 
terial strains often saves considerable time in identifying a carrier 
responsible for an outbreak and brings imder control a situation which 
might otherwise get out of hand. 

Fisk (1942a, b) showed that phages isolated from lysogenic strains 
of Staph, aureus could be used to identify particular strains of the 
same organism. Wilson and Atkinson (1945) extended Fisk's work and 
managed to isolate 18 phages and type 21 strains of Staph, aureus . 

This number of phage types has been enlarged and they are regularly 
employed to identify unknown Staph, aureus strains. 

Using 31 phages, Denton, Kalz, and Foley (1950) completed a suc¬ 
cessful investigation into an outbreak of staphylococcus follicxilitis 
(pemphigus neonatorum). 

Other investigations, most notably with organism^! causing enteric 
disease, have been conducted by Felix and Callow (1943a, b), Craigie 
(1939), and Felix (1944). 

It is interesting to note that the classification of bacteria by 
the use of phage typing is not confined to organisms causing human

disease; recently Conn, Bottcher, and Randal (1945) were able to class¬ 
ify closely related soil bacteria by the use of phage.

METHODS 


The strains of bacteriophage and the propagating strains of Staph . 
aureus used in this investigation were supplied by Mr. J. M. Deslanreau 
of the Laboratory Division, Quebec Ministry of Health, Both the viruses 
and host cells are designated by the British system and table I shows 
the phages used and their propagating strains of Staph, aureus . 

The bacterial strains were maintained, through the investigation, 
on nutrient agar slants (NAS, appendix III). These strains were sub¬ 
cultured once each month, being plated on blood agar plates (appendix 
IV) and picked to new NAS, in screw capped tubes. 

The strains of phage were received in tryptose glycerolated broth 
(appendix I) and that medium was used to maintain the phage for most of 
the time during which this work was carried out. Following investigation 
into the keeping qualities of phage under various conditions, the com¬ 
position of the-above medium was modified and named neopeptone glycero¬ 
lated broth (appendix V), 

Titration of Phage 

Throughout the investigation, phage was «spotted” on the surface of 
agar plates on which bacterial suspensions had been spread and allovred 
to ”dry in”. In all cases where either bacterial suspensions or phage 
suspensions were spotted on agar plates, platinum (gauge 24) loops, hav¬ 
ing an internal diameter of 2 mm., were used, A series of ten such 
loops was employed alternately in order to permit cooling of the loops 
to occur prior to their re-use. The internal diameter of the loops was 
determined by moulding the platinum wire around a piece of metal rod 
having a diameter of 2 mm. The rod was kept for this sole purpose. At 
the start of each day, all loops were checked to assure that delivery

These loops are referred to, in the following text, as ’’standard 
platiniim loops” or merely ’’standard loops”. 

Determination of Critical Test Dilution and litre 

The Critical Test Dilution (CTD) is a means of testing the potency 
of a phage suspension. Two general methods of determining the CTD are 
in common use (a) the broth method and (b) the agar plate spread 
method. 

(a) The broth method . This method involves preparing a series of 

phage dilutions in nutrient broth (NB, appendix II), and adding an equal 

volume of a concentration of host cells, such that each tube will con- 
7 

tain 12x10 cells per ml. Following incubation the tube containing 
the hipest dilution of phage, which shows complete lysis of the host 
cells, is said to contain the phage at its CTD. 

Plate I shows a series of tubes prepared in this way. Tube 7 is 
the last tube in the series to show complete lysis of the host cells 
and that tube is said to contain the phage at its CTD. In this case, 
the CTD of the phage is 1x10 ,. 

This method of determining the CTD of a phage suspension did not 
prove satisfactory during this investigation. Difficulty was encount¬ 
ered in obtaining consistent results. This was due, in great part, to 
the growth of resistant mutants of the propagating bacterial strains 
and resulted in turbidity due, not to insufficient phage being present, 
but to secondary bacterial growth. 

In consequence, this method was not used routinely. 

(b) Agar plate spread method . This method entails placing susceptible 
bacteria on the surface of an agar plate, allowing the bacterial sus-

pension to "dry in'*, and then ’'spotting'* the phage, in varying dilutions, 
on the plate. The highest dilution of phage causing confluent lysis 
after incubation, is said to be the CTD of that phage suspension. Such 
a method also allows one to determine the last dilution containing one 
phage particle. This dilution is called the titre of the phage suspen¬ 
sion. 

Two variations of this method were attempted. In both cases it 
was necessary to ’’spot** the phage dilutions at regular intervals over 
the surface of the agar plate. This was best accomplished by making 
plastic templates slightly larger than the size of the plates used. 

Rings of sponge rubber were cemented to the surface of the plastic in 
order to position the plates, and allow them to be placed in the same 
position after incubation, as they were while being "spotted**. 

Numbered spots, (15 mm in diameter) were etched on the plastic 
and located so as to accommodate the various dilutions used and yet 
avoid merging of one dilution into another. PLATE 2 shows the plastic 
templates used throughout the investigation. 

The first agar plate spread method, (Desranleau 1951)^ entails 
spreading one loopful of the host cells over each of the numbered spots 
individually. The organisms are allowed to **dry in*’ prior to "spotting** 
the phage dilution. Following the method described by Graigie and Yen 
(193Sa,b) the loops were angled so that they would lie parallel to the 
agar surface during inoculation. Bacterial cultiires were guided over 
the area of inoculation with the loop, but in the application of phage, 
suspensions actual contact between the inoculated surface and the loop 
was avoided. The drops of phage were allowed to make contact with the 
agar and flow naturally over the plate. PLATE 3(A) shows one such plate.

on which a phage suspension having a CTD of 10 ^ and titre of 10“^^ 
been spotted, following incubation. 

This method proved to give satisfactory results but involved a 
great deal of mechanical movement. It was therefore decided that, for 
most work, the second technique should be employed. 

The second technique (Williams 1949) varies from the first in that 
instead of spreading the host cells on specific spots on the plate, the 
plate is flooded with about 0.1 ml of a 4-6 hour broth culture of host 
cells (or suitably diluted host cells scraped from a 16 hour NAS culture 
and suspended in distilled water or normal (0.85^) saline). The inoc¬ 
ulum is delivered through a Pasteur pipette which also serves to suck 
off any excess fluid. 

The plate is left, with the lid cocked up, until it is dry, at 
which time, it is placed on the plastic template. Phage suspensions 
are applied, one over each etched area, using standard loops, and the 
plate is allowed to dry again before being incubated. 

This method proved satisfactory, it involved less labour and was 
quicker than the previously described method, A plate prepared in this 
manner, using the same phage suspensions and dilutions as above, is 
shown in PLATE 3(B). In this case the CTD is 10“'^ and titre is 10“^^, 
Experience showed that both techniques produced equivalent results. 
Readings for CTD or titre of individual phage suspensions were almost 
invariably the same by both methods. 

(c) Count of apparent number of phage particles present . The method, 
just described, of determining the CTD andtltre of a phage suspension 
proved satisfactory for many of the determinations made later. However, 
more involved methods for estimating the potency of a phage suspension

are available and may be useful especially for determining the number 
of phage particles present. 

In the first method a small volume of bacterial cells from a broth 
culture is placed on the surface of an agar plate and spread over the 
surface with a sterile glass spreader. When the plate has dried, an 
appropriate volume of phage suspension is likewise spread over the 
surface of the plate and the plate is allowed to dry before being incu¬ 
bated. Following incubation the number of plaques formed is counted and 
the number of phage particles in the original suspension is calculated. 

This method of mixing phage with host cells has defects. The spread¬ 
ing of phage suspension on the surface of an agar plate frequently 
clears host cells from some areas on the plate and phage particles, 
though present, have no opportunity of adsorbing on host cells. This 
means that those phage particles become lost because their presence 
cannot be demonstrated unless they lyse the host cells. 

Although this technique was simpler and more rapid than the one 
to be described, the above defect forced me to discard it. 

The second method is an agar pour plate method and was first 
described by Gratia (1936)., and is referred to hereafter as ”Gratia*s 
pour plate method”. 

Tubes containing 2.5 inl of 0,7 percent agar (in distilled water) 
are melted in boiling water and cooled in a 46°G water bath. Desired 
concentrations of host cells are added in 0.2 ml amo^ints either direct¬ 
ly from a broth culture or from a suspension prepared by washing the 
organisms from the surface of an agar slant with broth or distilled 
water. Then the diluted virus is added in any desired volume up to 1 ml. 

The mixture is poured immediately over the surface of a 1.5^ nutrient

agar plate. The plate is tilted gently to allow the mixture to spread 
evenly over the surface of the agar, and the lid of the Petri dish is 
cocked to allow the agar to harden. The NAP is now incubated and follow¬ 
ing incubation the number of plaques formed may be counted. The number 
of apparent phage particles in the original phage suspension may then 
be calculated. 

The porosity of the soft agar layer permits rapid diffusion of 
phage particles and the technique assures a more even distribution of 
phage particles than does the spreading technique. 

PLATE 4 shows a plate prepared in this manner. The phage suspen¬ 
sion contained 3460 particles per ml.

Significance of Results in Titration of Phage 

Phage 3A was diluted in glycerolated broth until a concentration of 
about 650 particles per ml, was obtained. 

Twenty 0,1 ml. samples were then removed and, following the pour 
plate method of Gratia, mixed with 0.2 ml. of a 6 hour culture of Staph¬ 
ylococcus strain 284, 2,5 ml. of melted 0.7^ agar and plated. 

Following incubation at 37^0 for 6 hours and then over-night at 
room ten^erature, the number of resulting plaques was counted. The 
mean (M), the standard deviation (cT), the coefficient of variability 
(Cv), the probable error (PE), and the number of duplicate plates that 
would have to be counted in order that the mean would be within 10^ of 
the true mean, 22 times out of 23 trials (Denny. 1922 and Pearl. 1923) was 
calculated

Using the foregoing data the following formula (Denny. 1922) was employed 
to determine the number of duplicate plates that would have to be counted 
in order that the mean would be within 10^ of the true mean 22 times out 
of 23 trials. 



Where N = the number of plates to be counted,

Therefore 1.87 duplicate plates would have to be prepared and counted

CONCLUSIONS 

The probable error expressed as percent of the mean can be taken 
as a fair indication of the variation expected in using 0,1 ml. quan¬ 
tities to do one-tenth dilutions of phage suspensions. 

The number of duplicate plates required in order that the mean will 
be within 10^ of the true mean is within the limits of the two plates 
normally used in determing the titre of a phage suspension by Gratia's 


method. 




PART THREE 


ELIMINATION OF HOST CELLS 






Elimination of Host Cells 


It is difficult to obtain phage suspensions free from host cells. 
When a phage suspension, apparently free from host cells, is held at 4^C 
for a period of weeks, it is frequently found to be turbid due to host 
cells which have developed during the holding period. 

When host cells are present phage adsorption on old or resistant 
bacteria greatly reduces the titre of the suspension. It is desirable, 
therefore, to eliminate host cells from a phage suspension or to arrest 
the growth of the host cells as soon as possible following the prepara¬ 
tion of the phage suspension. Several methods were tried in order to 
achieve this. Variations of the methods presented here were attempted 
but are not reported.

(A) Seitz Filtration 

The CTD and titre were determined for NB suspensions of three 
phages (3A, 31 and 42B) by the agar plate spread method. 

To these suspensions the appropriate propagating host cells were 
added, in NB, to a concentration of 10^ cells per ml. and the resulting 
mixtures were held at 20*^C for 1 hour. 

Host cells were added and mixtures were allowed to stand for one 
hour so that a common point, from \(diich determinations could be made 
might be established. It was realized that after the establishment of 
this point of departure the phage count might be varied in one of the 
following ways: 

(a) adsorption on host cells. 

(b) lysis of the host cells. 

(c) removal from the diluent by the method being examined. 
Notwithstanding this, I felt it advisable to establish a constant from 
which the methods employed could be compared. 

The three suspensions were passed through Seitz filter pads (grade 
SB) and the filtrates were assayed for phage by the agar plate spread 
method. 

The number of host cells present following filtration was determined 
by adding dilutions of the supernatant to melted nutrient agar and mak¬ 
ing pour plates. The plates were incubated at 37^0 for l6 hours. After 
incubation the resulting colonies were coiinted and the number of host 
cells per ml. of filtrate was calculated. All assays were done in 
triplicate and mean readings are recorded in table 2.

(B) Centrifugalization 

The CTD and titre were determined for NB suspensions of three 
phages (3A, 31> and 42B) by the agar plate spread method. 

To these suspensions the appropriate host cells were added, in NB, 
to a concentration of 10^ cells per ml. and the resulting mixtures were 
held at 20^C for 1 hour. This was done to establish a constant depart¬ 
ure point (page45 ). 

The three suspensions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. 
The supernatants were assayed for phage by the agar plate spread method. 
The number of host cells in the supernatant was determined by making agar 
pour plates and incubating them for 16 hours at 37*^0. Results are re¬ 
corded in table 3.

(C) Phage Penetration of Ap:ar 

An attempt was made to separate phage from host cells by means of 
harvesting phage from below the agar surface upon which the bacteria 
were growing. In order to accomplish this a 5 ml. syringe was cut trans¬ 
versely about 2 inches from the top of the barrel. A rubber stopper 
(B) was fitted in the bottom of the barrel and the syringe was filled to 
within 1/2 inch of the top with melted agar and plugged with a second 
stopper (A). PLATE 5 shows a syringe prepared in this way. 

After the agar had set, stopper A was removed and the surface of 
the agar was inoculated with a standard loopful of Staphylococcus strain 
2B4, containing 2 x 10 cells per ml. "When the host cells had "dried 
in", a standard loopful of a phage 3A suspension, having a CTD of 10“^ 
and a titre of lO"^^, was spotted on the agar surface and allowed to 
dry. 

In order to minimize the possibility of material flowing down 
between the agar and the inside wall of the syringe, great care was 
exercised to prevent the host cells and the phage from coming into con¬ 
tact with the outer edge of the agar surface. 

With stopper A replaced, the syringe was incubated, in a vertical 
position, for 6 hours at 37°G followed by 12 hours at 20^Q, At the end 
of the incubation period confluent lysis of the host cells had ta^en 
place. 

With stoppers A and B removed the agar was forced through the 
syringe by means of the plunger, inserted in the top of the syringe. 

As the agar was forced out sections, 1/8 inch in length, were cut off 
with sterile razor blades, macerated and placed in 2 ml. of NB. 

Agar sections were removed in this manner to a point immediately

below {about l/l6”) the surface upon which the suspensions had been 
inoculated. The resulting suspensions were held at 4^C for one week 
(exp. p69) after which they were assayed for the presence of phage. 

This was repeated using various concentrations of agar. 

Host cells did not penetrate any agar concentration used. 

Table 4 shows the depth to which the phage was found to penetrate 
the agar tested. 

Results recorded in table 4 indicate that phage penetration of agar 
is slight. Penetration to 3/16" occurred in 1.75^ agar and no penetra¬ 
tion occurred in 2,0:t agar. It is interesting to note that the penetra¬ 
tion of 0^15% agar, lov;est concentration of agar that would remain 
firm, was not greater than in higher concentrations up to 1.25/o. Pos¬ 
sibly mechanical interference of the agar or adsorption on agar accounts 
for this. 

The amount of phage recoverable, from below the agar surface 
inoculated, is not great enough to warrant using this technique in its 
present form. 

Conclusions 

The technique described, in its present form, is not suitable for 
routine use in the elimination of host cells. 

Phage does not penetrate 2.00/ agar to a depth of l/l6".

(D) Presence of Glycerine 

Glycerine increasing in 5% concentrations from 0% - 50;o was added 
to tryptose broth. 

To 5.0 ml. of the above mixtures, one standard loopful of 18 hour 
cultures of Staphylococcus strains 284, 1307, and 1363 were added. All 
mixtures were incubated at 37*^0 and examined daily for evidence of 
growth, for a period of one week. 

Tubes containing 25^^ or less glycerine showed evidence of bacterial 
growth. Tubes containing 30;o or more glycerine failed to show evidence of 
bacterial growth. 

After the one week period, all tubes were held at 4^0 for the next 
three weeks. At the end of that time, viable staphylococci were recovered 
from all tubes containing k0% or less glycerine. 

Conclusions 

The presence of 30^ or more glycerine in tryptose broth arrests the 
growth of staphylococci for a period of one week at 37^C. A concentra¬ 
tion of more than 4‘3^ glycerine is required to kill staphylococci in 4 
weeks (under the conditions of this experiment).

PropaFiation of Phar.e 

It is difficult to obtain phage of high titre. Within the limits of 
pH, NaCl concentration, incubation temperature, nutrients, etc, used for 
the routine culture of staphylococci, phage of low titre majr be obtained 
without undue difficulty. Small variations of the above factors affect 
the chance of obtaining a phage suspension of sufficient strength for 
most phage work. Since it is necessary to have a phage suspension con¬ 
taining lo"^ or more particles per ml, in most instances, I conducted ex¬ 
periments to investigate the limits which must be set on these various 
factors to assure satisfactory phage production. 

For one or more reasons, as yet unknown, the phages used during this 
investigation showed on occasion, a great and sudden decrease in potency. 
In some cases a recently prepared phage suspension showed a decrease in 
titre, for example, 10”^^ to 10“^ in one week. This reduction in titre 
necessitated an immediate attempt to increase the potency of the suspen¬ 
sion by one or other of the methods to be described. 

Increase of L:vi:ic Activity 

(A) A procedure for the propagation of phages has been outlined in 
detail by Wilson and Atkinson (1945a, b) in their report on an extension 
of Fisk's (1942) T/Vork, A phage suspension is plated out with its propa¬ 
gating strain of host cells and incubated at 37°G for 6-8 hours, followed 
by holding at room temperature overnight. After incubation, a plaque is 
picked and added to a 2-4 hour NB culture of susceptible host cells and 
incubated at 37°C for 4-6 hours. As soon as evidence of lysis appears, 
an equal volume of the culture is added to a fresh 2-4 hour NB culture of 
host cells, and incubated again for 4-6 hours. The number of passages 
required to reach a sufficiently high phage titre varies from about four

to twelve. The final culture is filtered through a Seitz SK pad and re¬ 
frigerated without preservative. 

This method was found to be satisfactory and was used, except for 
filtering through a Seitz EK pad, when handling phages having a particu¬ 
larly low titre. 

(B) a second method has been employed by Williams (1949). Petri 
dishes containing 1/2 strength Hartley Broth, to which 1.25? shred agar 
has been added, are spread with a 4-6 hour NB culture of the propagat¬ 
ing host cells. The plate is dried and an equal volume of a phage suspen¬ 
sion is spread over all but a small section, which acts as a control. 

After overnight incubation at 30®C, lysis occurs (PLATE 6). The un¬ 
lysed control area is excised and discarded. The remainder of the agar 
is cut into squares (about 1/4” in size). The plates are then frozen and 
held at -10°C or lower, for 24 hours. On thavjing at room temperature, 
the clear fluid which separates from the agar may be sucked off with a 
Pasteur pipette, centrifuged to clear organisms and stored at 4*^C. This 
method has two defects. Uneven spreading of a phage suspension on the 
"dried in" host cells results in a great number of unlysed host cells in 
the fluid obtained following freezing. The space available for freezing 
plates allowed only four to be frozen and held at one time.. Since 21 
phages were maintained during this investigation, it required almost a 
full week to obtain high titre suspensions of all phages. 

(C) Desranleau (1951) described a method which I used with minor 
variations throughout this investigation. 

Two dry NAP are placed on plastic templates and the propagating strain 
of Staphylococcus (NB culture incubated overnight at 37°C) is inoculated 
with standard loops over 10-12 of the etched areas, on each plate.

Propagation of phage by William's (iy4yi 
method. Unlysed areas have not been 
excised, 









54 


Lids are cocked and when the plates are dry, (usually in about 15 
minutes), a standard loopful of phage suspension is added to each inocu¬ 
lated area. Plates are allowed to dry and then incubated at 37°C for 5-6 

o 

hours, followed by 12 hours at 20 C, at which time lysis has occurred 
(PUTE 7A). 

Following incubation, sections of agar are excised from lysed areas 
(PLATE 7B) and about one dozen placed in a 1 ounce screw capped bottle 
(PLATE BA) containing 15 ml. of buffered tryptose glycerolated broth to 

which a small crystal of thymol has been added. The preparation is then 

o 

stored at 4 C. The purpose of this is to allow diffusion of phage into 
the diluent. 

Working dilutions of phage are made in tryptose glycerolated broth. 

I found that the titre of the diluted suspensions decreased more rapidly 
than that of the stock suspensions and therefore prepared only a small 
quantity of working suspension (2-3 ml.) at one time. This I held at 
in 5 nil. screw capped bottles (PLATS BB). 

This method proved satisfactory if the initial phage suspensions 
were active enough to give confluent lysis of the host cells. When the 
phage suspension was not potent enough to give confluent lysis the method 
of Wilson and Atkinson was used to increase potency followed by Desran- 
leau*s method for the preparation of a stock suspension.

Effect of Thymol on the Growth of Staphylococci 

All Staphylococcus stock strains were plated on NAP. 0.5 gram of 
thymol was added to 1.0 ml. of nutrient broth. One standard loopful of 
the broth containing thymol was then spotted on each staphylococcus strain. 
All plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 hours. 

All strains of staphylococci grew well and without evidence of growth 
restriction due to the presence of thymol. 

Conclusion 

The presence of thsrraol in a concentration of approximately five times 
greater than that used to inhibit the growth of molds in phage suspensions’ 
has no noticeable effect on the growth of staphylococci.

Both tubes were incubated at 37 C for 3 hours and centrifuged at 
4000 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatants were assayed for phage, in 
triplicate, by Gratia's pour plate method; mean readings are recorded in

Effect of A^ar Concentration on Plaque Formation 

In view of the results obtained when attempting to separate phage 
from host cells by phage penetration of agar, I felt it desirable to de¬ 
termine the effect of agar concentration on Gratia’s pour plate method. 

A suspension of phage 3A containing about 3000 particles per ml. 
was assajT-ed by Gratia’s method using varying concentrations of agar. All 
mixtures were poured on NAP containing 1.5^ agar, and incubated at 30®C 
for IB hours. 

Mean plaque counts from each agar concentration, investigated in 
triplicate, are recorded in table 6.

As the concentration of agar increases, the size and number of 
plaques decreases. This decrease is probably due to interference with 
phage particles by the agar, either mechanically or by adsorption. This 
would decrease the number of infective particles available for adsorp¬ 
tion on host cells and consequently reduce the number of plaques formed. 

PLATE 9 shows the decreasing size and number of plaques formed in 
the presence of varying concentrations of agar.

Effect of Various Peptones on Phage Production 


The follovdng procedure was carried out in the case of each peptone 
examined. 

Peptone was added in a concentration of 1,5% to normal saline {0,B5%) 
and the pH was adjusted to 7.4* Following sterilization by autoclaving 
for 20 minutes at 120°C the pH was found to be 7 •2. 

To 4.S ml. of the peptone mixtures the following were added: 

(a) 0.1 ml. of a suspension of phage 3A in peptone free glycerolated 
broth (containing 12^500 particles per ml.). 

(b) 0.1 ml. of an 18 hour culture of Staphylococcus strain 284 (di- 
luted to contain 2x10° cells per ml. and prepared by scraping growth from 
a NAS and suspending organisms in normal saline). The resulting suspen¬ 
sion contained about 1250 phage particles and 2x10^^ host cells. 

The suspensions were incubated in a 37^0 water bath for 3 hours. 
Following incubation bacterial growth appeared to be the same in all tubes. 
The suspensions were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes and the super¬ 
natants were assayed for phage by Gratia’s pour plate method. 

Results are recorded in table 7 and figures given are the average of 
three determinations. 

Under the conditions employed, phage production in the presence of 
neo-peptone was about eight times greater than the next highest amount 
obtained. 

Phage production in the presence of tryptose, Bacto tr3rptone, try- 
pticase, poly peptone, proteose peptone #3 and Bacto peptone was far below 
that obtained, under similar conditions, in the presence of neo-peptone. 

It is evident that neo-peptone stimulates in some way the host-virus 
system, probably either by supplying some nutrient readily adapted to phage

nutrition or by diminishing the bacterial lag phase with consequent 
acceleration of "burst periods" in phage raultiplication, A similar effect 
could, of course, be produced by the absence in neo-peptone of some inhib¬ 
itory factor present in the other peptones. 

Conclusion 

Neo-peptone was the most suitable, of the peptones examined, for 
the production of phage.

The above results suggested the desirability for further study of 
the peptones. Investigation was carried out by the application of paper 
chromatography to the study of amino acids present.. The amino acids con¬ 
tained in the various peptones were determined by the method of Proom and 
Woiwod (1949). Each peptone was examined in duplicate, the resulting 
chromatogram is presented in PLATE 9 A. 

It is apparent that neo-peptone contains the amino acids present, 
in a lesser amount than the other peptones. It is suggested that this 
evidence supports the hypotheses that the other peptones contain some

Effect of Sodium Chloride on Pha>:^e Production 


NB was prepared without sodium chloride and distributed in 6 oz* 
bottles in 100 ml. amounts. Sodium chloride was added to these bottles 
in varying amounts. The following procedure was carried out in the case 
of each sodium chloride concentration: 

4.8 ml. of NB plus NaCl was placed in a 5”xJ'* test tube and to this 
was added: 

(a) 0.1 ml. of a culture of a Staphylococcus strain 284, (prepared by 
suspending the growth from an 18 hour NAS culture in sterile distilled 
water and diluting to obtain 2x10 cells per ml. 

(b) 0.1 ml. of an NaCl free suspension of phage 3A containing 2000 phage 
particles per ml. 

Tubes were then incubated at 37®C for three hours after which they 
were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatants were then 
assayed for phage by Gratia’s pour plate method. Incubation was carried 
out for 18 hours at 30®C. 

Assays were done in triplicate and mean readings are recorded in 
table 8. 

It appears that a small amount of NaCl is desirable for phage produc¬ 
tion. However, as the amount of NaCl increases above 0»25%, no sharp re¬ 
duction in phage production is noted, until a concentration of 4.25^ is 


reached,

No explanation is offered for the irregular plaque counts found with¬ 
in the range of 0,25% and 3•15% NaCl. 

Conclusions 

A small amo'unt of NaCl is required for phage production to occur. 

Mo obvious benefit accrued by increasing the concentration above 0,25%» 
Between this concentration and 3*15% considerable irregularity but no 
obvious reduction of phage production was recorded^ but as the concentra¬ 
tion of NaCl increases over k*'25% the production of phage particles is 
distinctly reduced. 

Table 9 shows the plaque size and the number of plaques formed in 
the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl, 

Plaque size was determined with a low power lens and eyepiece micro¬ 
meter. Figures reported are the mean size of 30 plaques on each plate.

In this experiment, the plaques formed varied in size, PLATE IC^ 
and ^^with no apparent relationship between size, concentration of NaCl 
used or total number of plaques formed. This variation conflicts with 
most of the other findings during this investigation, when the strains 
of staphylococcal phage formed plaques of a fairly constant size, about 
0.25 mm in diameter.

Effect of pH on Phage Production 

Tubes containing 4.5 nil. of sterile NB with varied pHs were buffered 
and inoculated with the following: 

(a) 0,4ml. ofanlS hour culture of Staphylococcus strain 2S4 
(scraped from a NAS, suspended in normal saline and diluted to contain 
2x10^ organisms per ml. 

(b) 0.1 ml. of a suspension of phage 3A which contained approxim¬ 
ately 800 phage particles per ml. 

All mixtures were incubated at 37^0 for 3 hours and then centrifuged 
at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. The supernatants were then assayed for 
phage by Gratia's pour plate method. Incubation was carried out at 30^0 
for 18 hours. The figures listed in table 10 are the average of three 
assays. 

As one would expect, phage production is limited by the pH of the 
medium used. Under the conditions of this experiment, the range of pH 
within which satisfactory production of phage is obtained, is compar¬ 
atively small and lies sli^tly on the alkaline side of neutrality. 

This suggests the desirability of buffering at an optimum point any med¬ 
ium used for phage production. 

Conclusions 

Maximum phage production is obtained when the medium employed is ad¬ 
justed to a pH value which is slightly higher than neutral. Under the 
conditions of this experiment phage production is greatest when the pH 
value lies between 7.0 and 8.0,

Effect of Different Methods of Incubation on Pha^e Prodaction 

A series of NAP (20 ml. of 1.5/o agar) was flooded with 4 hour NB 
cultures of Star^hylococcus strain 284* Once the organisms had "dried in" 
a suspension of phage 3A, having a CTD of 10"“^ and a titre of 10"!^, was 
spotted on the plates with standard loops, and allowed to dry. Plates 
were incubated at different temperatures for varying periods of time. 
Following incubation 5 equal areas, showing lysis, were excised from each 
plate. The excised areas, in each case, were placed in 2 ml, of tr 3 q)tose 
glycerolated broth and maintained at 4*^0, 

At the end of one week the CTD and titre were determined for each 
suspension. Figures recorded in table II are the average of triplicate 
assays, 

o 

>/hen plates were incubated for long periods of time at 37 G, second¬ 
ary gro\^rth occurred (table II, plates E, G and L). Apparently, in the 
case of plate A, insufficient time elapsed to pemit lysis to occur, but 
prolonged incubation at the same temperature did permit lysis to occur. 

A comparison of plates F and H with plates D and E shows that if 
plates are to be incubated at two different temperatures, they should'be 
incubated at the higher temperature for the shorter period of time. 

Two methods of incubation were used during the remainder of the in¬ 
vestigation. These methods were chosen (a) because they were satisfac¬ 
tory for the production of phage and (b) they proved to be convenient. 
The methods chosen were 18 hours at 30^C, and 6 hours at 37^0 followed 
by 12 hours at 20°G.

Conclusions 

Satisfactory production of phage may be obtained when plates are 
incubated under one of the following conditions: 

(a) for 6 hours at 30°C followed by 12 hours at 20°G, 

(b) for 6 hours at 37°C followed by 12 hours at 20^C. 

(c) for IB houi’s at 30°C. 

The amount of phage produced by a, b, and c is the same. Any one 
of these methods of incubation may be used, depending upon which proves

Effect of Time on Phap^e Titre Following Harvest by Desranleau Method 
Duplicate NAP (20 ml. of 1 . 5 % agar) were spotted, using standard 
loops, with a 6 hour NB culture of Staphylococcus strain 284. Following 
the "drying in" of the host cells, a suspension of phage 3A, having a 
CTD of 10~^ and a titre of lO” , was spotted on the host cells and allowed 
to dry. Both plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37°G followed by 12 
hours at 20°C, 

From each plate six lysed areas of approximately 1/4 inch in dia¬ 
meter were excised, macerated in 2 ml, of tryptose glycerolated broth, 
o 

and held at 4 C. The CTD and titre of each harvest were determined at 
different times. Average readings are recorded in table 12.

These results indicate that phage is retained for some time by the 
agar of the medium, either mechanically since maceration can ,never be 
complete, or by adsorption, A suitable interval of storage must be allowed 
for the maximum diffusion of phage into the surrounding diluent.

Conclusion 

Following harvest by Desranleau's method, a period of one week must 
elapse before the highest titre of the phage suspension is reached.

Effect of Concentration of Susceptible Bacteria on Pha/3:e Production 

The following experiment was conducted in order to determine (a) 
what effect the number of susceptible bacteria used might have on phage 
production, and (b) what limits need be placed on the number of suscept¬ 
ible bacteria used in order to obtain satisfactory production of phage 
particles. 

A stock suspension of Staphylococcus strain 284 was prepared by wash¬ 
ing the growth from an 18 hour NAS culture and suspending the organisms 
in normal saline. 

To each of seven tubes containing 4.5 nil. of MB, 0.4 ml. of a sus¬ 
pension of organisms (as estimated by McFarland’s turbidity standards) 
was added in increasing concentrations such that the final suspensions con¬ 
tained 1x10^, Ixio"^, 1x10^, 2x10^, 3x10^, 5x10^, and 1x10^ cells per ml. 

0.1 ml. of a phage suspension containing 500 particles per ml. was 
added to each tube and all tubes were incubated at 37®C for three hours. 

After incubation, all tubes were centrifuged at 4000 rpra for 30 
minutes following which the supernatants were assayed for phage by Gratia’s 
pour plate method. All assays were done in triplicate and mean values are 
recorded in table 13

plaques did not vary significantly. The slight decrease in the number 

a 

of plaques obtained when the number of bacteria used was above 2x10 per 
ml. may be due in part to the increased opportunity for resistant bac- 
teria to develop and obscure some plaques which formed. 2x1.0 per ml. is 
a convenient number of cells to prepare and is a satisfactory number for 
phage production; therefore, this number of cells was used in almost all 
later experiments* 

Conclusion 

When the number of bacteria used for staphylococcal phage production 
falls below 1x10 per ml., growth is discontinuous. 

As the number of bacteria, under the conditions of this experiment, 
is increased above ljd.0 per ml,, the total number of plaques produced 
varies only slightly.

Effect of Age of Host Cells on Phage Production 

The follovdng procedure was carried out at different times during 
the growth of a NB culture of Staphylococcus strain 284. 

A volume of 15 ml. of the culture was removed and centrifuged. The 
packed cells were resuspended in NB in a concentration of 2x10^ cells 
per ml. (as estimated by McFarland’s standards). 0.1 ml. of a stock sus¬ 
pension of phage 3A containing 400 particles per ml. was added to 4*9 nil. 
of the resuspended cell suspension, and incubated for 3 hours at 37°C. 

Following incubation, the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 rpm 
for 30 minutes and the supernatant was assayed for phage by Gratia’s pour 
plate method. 

After the removal of the last 0.1 ml. of phage required for the ex¬ 
periment, the stock phage suspension was assayed and the number of phage 
particles present was found to be unchanged. 

Table 14 shows the effect of age of host cells on phage production.

As the age of host cells employed during the production of phage 
increases past l6 hours, the number of phage particles formed decreases. 
This may be due, in part, to adsorption of phage on dead host cells with¬ 
out subsequent development of new particles. 

Conclusion 

The resulting number of phage particles is dependent on the age of 
the host cells used during the production of phage.

Effect of Initial Phage Concentration on Phage Production 


The following experiment was carried out in order to determine the 
effect of initial phage concentration on phage production during a period 
of 3 hours incubation, 0,1 ml. of dilutions of phage 3A were added to 

g 

4.9 inl* quantities of NB containing 2x10 cells of Staphylococcus strain 
284. This number of cells was used because of the convenience of prepar¬ 
ation, and the desirability of having a constant point from which this 
experiment could be carried out. The final mixtures contained 10, 20, 

30 , 40, 50, and 60 phage particles per 0.1 ml. respectively. 

All tubes were incubated at 37^0 for 3 hours, after which they were 
centrifuged and the supernatants were assayed for phage by Gratia's pour 
plate method. All assays were done in duplicate and mean readings are 
recorded in table 15.

The three hour period of incubation .of the phage-host mixture was 
chosen since it proved to be the most convenient period of time to use 
during routine work. It is probable that an increase in time of incuba¬ 
tion would permit tubes containing the smaller initial numbers of par-~

tides to increase in phage content sufficiently so that at the point of 
complete lysis all tubes would contain approximately the same number of 
phage particles. 

' Conclusion 

Under the conditions of this experiment the final concentration of 
phage is dependent upon the initial amount of phage used.

Effect of Chemicals on Phage Production 

The effect of chemicals, used routinely to clean glassware, was 
determined by the following procedure in the cases of lysol and tri 
sodium phosphate. Lysol dilutions were made vol/vol and tri sodium phos¬ 
phate dilutions were made \>rt/vol. 

The glassware in this experiment was washed routinely and soaked in 
tap vater overnight, followed by rinsing in distilled water for 15 minutes 
prior to being autoclaved. 

The chemicals were added to NB in amounts such that final concentra¬ 
tions of 1/103; 1/10^; 1/10^; 1 / 10^1 and l/io"^ were obtained. 

To 4.5 ml. of each dilution the following were added. 

(a) 0.1 ml. of a suspension of phage 3A which contained 1x10^ 
particles per ml. 

(b) 0.4 ml. of a six hour NB culture of Staphylococcus strain 284> 
diluted to contain 2x10 organisms per ml. 

Controls were prepared by leaving out the chemicals, but othervd.se 
follovd.ng the above procedure. 

All mixtures were incubated at 37®C for 4 hours and then centrifuged 
at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. 

The supernatant from each was assayed for phage by Gratia’s pour 
plate method; incubation being carried out at 30®C for 18 hours. The 
figures recorded in table l6 and table 17 are the averages of three plat¬ 
ings.

A marked reduction in phage production is observed when lysol or tri 
sodium phosphate is present in a dilution of 1/10^ or less. Since phage 
production in the control tubes was not greater than in dilutions of the 
chemicals 1/10^ and greater, it would appear that ordinary glassware pre¬ 
paration removes sufficient of the chemicals so that no adverse effect is 
exerted. 

Conclusions 

Lysol and tri sodium phosphate, in a dilution of 1/10^ or less, cause 
a marked reduction in phage production. 

Routine preparation of glassware removes at least sufficient of the 
chemicals so that phage production is not materially affected.

MAINTENANCE OF PHAGE 





i 


i 



78 


Maintenance of Pha^e Suspensions 

It is difficult to maintain phage in high titre. Throughout this 
investigation phage preparations diminished to about one-half their init¬ 
ial titre after 4-8 weeks. On several occasions phage was lost entirely, 
without the introduction of any apparent change in technique. As*yet no 
explanation is offered for this sudden loss in phage strength. 

It is most desirable that phage suspensions retain sufficient potency 
for use in routine investigations and the typing of bacterial cultures. 
This should be retained for at least two months because the necessity of 
making fresh preparations within this period interferes too grossly with 
the progress of any investigation.

Effect of Thymol on CTD and Titre of a Phage Suspension 

Thymol was added to glycerolated broth to restrict the growth of 

molds and proved effective for this purpose. In order to determine what 

effect, if any, thymol had on the keeping qualities of a phage suspension 

the following procedure was carried out. 

A thymol crystal weighing 0.5 grams was added to 15 ml. of a try- 

ptose glycerolated broth suspension of phage 3A having a CTD of 10"^ 

-21 

and a titre of 10 

The suspension was held at and the CTD and titre were determined 
at intervals, by spotting one-tenth dilutions of the phage suspension on 
NAPs which had been inoculated with Staphylococcus s train 2S4. Plates 
were incubated at 37^0 for 6 hours and then held at 20°C for a further 
period of 12 hours. 

The above was done in triplicate and the mean values are reported in 
table 18.

adverse effect on the CTD and titre of phage suspended in tryptose gly-

81 


Effect of Glycerine on Keeping Qualities of Phage 

Tryptose glycerolated broth was prepared with concentrations of gly¬ 
cerine ranging from 

To 4.9 ml, of the various broths 0,1 ml. portions of a NB suspen¬ 
sion of phage 3A were added. The final suspensions had a CTD of 10”^ 
and titre of 10“--^. 

All suspensions were held at 4°C and assayed for phage particles 
at different times by the agar plate spread method. Figures recorded in 
table 19 are the average of two platings. 

Conclusions 

Glycerine in concentrations up to 35 % do not appreciably affect the 
titre of a staphylococcal phage suspension. 

Staphylococcal phage can be recovered from a suspension, containing 
50^ glycerine, after being held at 4^C for 8 weeks.

Effect of Peptones on the Keeping Qualities of Phag:e 

In view of the results obtained when employing different peptones 
for phage production, I felt that it would be advisable to determine the 
effect of the same peptones on the keeping qualities of phage suspensions. 

A stock suspension of phage 3A having 5000 particles per ml., in pep- 
tone-free glycerolated broth, was used as the source of phage for this ex¬ 
periment . 

4.5 ml. quantities of 1,5^ peptone solutions in glycerolated broth, 
were placed in 5 ml. screw capped bottles. To each bottle 0.5 ml. of a 
phage 3A suspension containing 5000 particles per ml. was added. The 
final mixture, therefore, contained 500 phage particles per ml. All 
bottles were held at 4°C and assayed for phage, at various times, by 
Gratia’s pour plate method. All assays were done in triplicate and mean 
figures are recorded in table 20. 

With the exception of Bacto tryptone, trypticase and Bacto peptone, 
none of the peptones examined appear to affect the keeping qualities of 
staphylococcal phage. These three peptones, however, appear to contain 
some substance injurious to phage.

Conclusions 

Some of the peptones^ commonly used in the making of bacteriological 
media, affect the keeping qualities of phage adversely. 

Neo-peptone, which proved to be the most valuable of the peptones ex- 
amined for phage production (table 7), does not affect the keeping qual¬ 
ities of phage adversely.

Effect of NaCl on Keeping Qualities of Phage 


Glycerolated broth was prepared with varying amounts of NaCl and 
dispensed into 5 nil. screw capped bottles. 

To each bottle the following was added; 

(a) 4.9 ml. of glycerolated broth containing NaCl. 

(b) 0.1 ml. of phage 3A suspension diluted such that the final 
suspension contained about 3000 particles per ml. (300 particles per 0.1 
ml.), 

The resulting suspensions were held at 4*^0 and assaj^ed for phage at 
different times by Gratia's pour plate method. 

Figures in table 21 are the average of triplicate assays.

From table 8 it will be seen that the presence of a small amount of 
NaCl appears necessary to maintain phage under the experimental conditions 
eii 5 )loyed. The number of viable phage particles in the suspension devoid 
of NaCl, after a period of 8 weeks, was considerably less than the number 
found when NaCl was present. The keeping qualities of staphylococcal

phage are best when the atno'ont of NaCl present lies between 0.25^ and 1*75^5 
however, there is no significant difference in plaque count within that 
range. 

Conclusions 

A small amount of NaCl is necessary to enhance the keeping qualities 
of staphylococcal phage. The amount of NaCl required for the most sat¬ 
isfactory maintenance of staphylococcal phage lies between 0.25^ and 
1.75^.

Effect of pH on the Keeping Qualities of Phage 

Tryptose glycerolated broth was prepared with various pH values and 
then buffered. 4.5 ml, quantities of the different media were placed in 
5 ml. screw capped bottles. Each bottle was inoculated with a stock 
suspension of phage 3A so that the final suspension had a CTD of 10“^ 
and a titre of 10”^^. 

After thorough mixing, all bottles were held at 4°C and assayed for 
phage at different times by the agar plate spread method. pH values of 
the buffered phage suspensions were checked at the end of eight weeks and 
are recorded in table 22 along with the CTD and titre determinations. 

Beyond the limits of pH 4.0 and pH 10.0 staphylococcal phage is 
destroyed within one week. Prolonged storage at a pH value below 6.0 
or above B.5 results in a considerable loss in phage titre. The range of 
pH within which phage may be maintained satisfactorily is comparatively 
small and lies slightly on the alkaline side of neutrality. 

Conclusions 

The resistance of Staphylococcus phage is limited, for purposes of 
keeping stock, by the hydrogen ion concentration corresponding to pH 
6.0 on the acid side and pH 8.5 on the alkaline side.

Effect of Storage Temperatures on Pha/^e Keeping Qualities 

The effect of storage temperature on the maintenance of phage sus¬ 
pensions was determined by placing 2 ml, portions of a tryptose glycer- 
olated broth suspension of phage 3A in 5 lAl. screw capped bottles and 

holding them at various temperatures. The initial phage suspension had 
-4 -21 

a CTD of 10 and a titre of 10 . Assays for phage were made, in tri¬ 

plicate, at weekly intervals. Mean readings are presented in table 23.

The reduction of phage titre in suspensions held at -15°C and 4*^0 
is probably due to a natural decrease in titre not directly connected 
with temperature. As the storage temperature is increased above 4*^C, 
the loss in titre becomes greater until a dramatic reduction in titre 
is exhibited at temperatures of 30^0 and hi^er. 

Conclusion 

The titre of a phage suspension is best maintained at a temperature 
of 4°C or lower.

approximately 10, 100, 300 , 500, and 10,000 particles per 0.1 ml. res¬ 
pectively were held at 4°C and assayed for phage at various times by 
Gratia's pour plate method. 

All assays were done in triplicate and mean values are recorded in 
table 24.

Effect of Chemicals on Phage Keeping Qualities 

In order to determine the effect of chemicals, used routinely to 
clean glassware, on the keeping qualities of phage, the following pro¬ 
cedure was carried out in the case of lysol and tri sodium phosphate. 

The chemical was added to tryptose glycerolated broth, in amounts 
such that the final concentrations were 1/103; l/lcA; 1/10^; 1/10^; 
and 1/10^. The lysol dilutions were made vol/vol and the tri sodium 
phosphate dilutions were made wt/vol. A tube containing tryptose gly¬ 
cerolated broth but no chemical, was included as a control. 

To 4.9 nil. of the above dilutions, 0.1 ml. portions of a suspension 
of phage 3A were added in a concentration such that the final mixtures 
would contain 500 phage particles per ml. The resulting suspensions 
were stored at 4°C in 5 nil. screw capped bottles which had been rmmersed 
in running tap water for 3 hours and rinsed thoroughly in distilled 
water for 15 minutes before being autoclaved. 

At various intervals of time, 0.1 ml. of each dilution was removed 
and assayed for phage particles by Gratia*s pour plate method. The 
figures recorded in table 25 and table 26 are the average of three such 
platings.

A reduction in the number of phage particles was obtained in two 
cases with each chemical examined. It is probable that after routine 
washing of glassware in tap water, and rinsing in distilled water, the 
amo^ont of lysol and tri sodium phosphate remaining on the glass is less 
than that in the tubes aontaining 1/10^ of the chemicals in question.

Therefore, the use of these chemicals in the washing of glassware should 
have no significant effect on the keeping qualities of phage, provided 
the glassware is reasonably well rinsed. 

Conclusions 

The amount of lysol and tri sodium phosphate remaining on glassware 
following the routine washing and rinsing of such glassware does not 
affect adversely the keeping qualities of staphylococcal phage. 

Experience showed that staphylococcal phages were best handled in 
the following manner. The method of Wilson and Atkinson (page 52) for 
phage propagation was modified as follows. Neo-peptone broth containing 
1 % neo-peptone, 0.25^ NaCl and 1 % Bacto meat extract in distilled water 
was used throughout. This broth had a final pH of 7.4-7.6. 4*9 ml. of 

a 4-6 hour broth culture of host cells was inoculated with 0.1 ml. of 
phage suspension of maximum potency. After incubation at 37°C for 4-6 
hours the mixture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. 

Stock suspensions of phage were prepared by Desranleau*s method 
(page 53)* The agar medium was modified by replacing Bacto peptone with 
1 % neo-peptone and reducing the amount of NaCl from 0.85^ to 0.25^. 
Plates were inoculated with 4-6 hour broth cultures of host cells con- 

g 

taining 2x10 cells per ml., spotted with phage suspensions of maximum 
titre and incubated for 6 hours at 37®C followed by 12 hours at 20®C or 
for 18 hours at 30°C, whichever proved most convenient. Following incu¬ 
bation, 10-12 sections of agar were excised, placed in 15 ml. of neo¬ 
peptone glycerolated broth (page 124) and maintained at 4^0. 

Gratia‘s method (page 39) was most satisfactory for the assay of 
phage, the host cell suspensions used contained 2x10^ cells per ml.

SUMM/iRY 


(1) The most satisfactory method for the production of phage is the 
broth method of VJilson and Atkinson (1945a, b). 

(2) The peptones examined prove to have a considerable effect on phage. 
The most suitable for the production of phage is neo-peptone. This pep¬ 
tone does not affect the keeping qualities of phage adversely, 

(3) A small amount of NaCl is necessar^^ for phage production and for 
maintenance of phage suspensions. A concentration of 4.25^ is detremental 
to phage production and a concentration of 2.25^ is detremental to phage 
keeping qualities. Phage plaques vary in size with varying concentrations 
of NaCl. 

(4) A slightly alkaline pH (7>0-8.0) is required for optimum phage pro¬ 
duction. This range of pH favours the keeping qualities of phage. 

(5) Temperature of incubation during phage production is extremely im¬ 
portant. Phage production is equivalent under three methods of incuba¬ 
tion, it being necessary, in two of these methods to incubate at the 

higher temperature first. Follov/ing harvest by Desranleau’s (1951) method, 

o 

one week must elapse before the maximuju amount of phage held at 4 C, has 
diffused into the diluent, and thereafter phage is best maintained at 
4°C or lower. 

(6) The number and age of host cells present is an important factor in 

S 

the production of phage. 2x10 host cells per ml, is satisfactory'’ for 
phage production, but these cells must not be more than 16 hours old or 
phage production is greatly reduced. In phage production the final 
concentration of phage is dependent upon the initial amount of phage 
used, but the initial phage concentration does not affect the percent 
decrease in phage particles maintained at 4°C.

(7) The number of host cells in a phage suspension can be satisfactor¬ 
ily reduced by centrifugal!zation at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes. 

(8) Filtration of phage through agar is not satisfactory by the tech¬ 
nique employed. Filtration through the equivalent of a Seitz EK pad is 
likewise unsatisfactory, bacteria being removed, but viable phage par¬ 
ticles also being removed, 

(9) The development of host cells in a phage suspension held at 4®C is 
restricted by the presence of 30 ^ glycerine. 

(10) Lysol and tri sodiijim phosphate do not affect phage production or 
maintenance when in a concentration equivalent to that present following 
the routine washing of glassware. 

(11) The assay of phage bj^ Gratia’s (1936) pour plate method, is condit¬ 
ioned by the concentration of agar employed. As the concentration in¬ 
creases the number of plaques formed is reduced.

PART SIX 


PHAGE TYPING 










96 


Pha/^e Typing; 

A total of 963 haemolytic Staphylococcus aureus strains were phage 
typed. All strains were isolated in the Provincial Laboratory, University 
of Alberta, from specimens submitted for blood culture, ’’miscellaneous” 
examination (wound infections, hands, skin lesions, etc.) and nose and 
throat swabs. 

Upon being isolated, all strains were tested for pigment formation, 
mannit^fermentation, penicillin sensitivity and production of coagulase. 
At the same time, they were planted on NAS in 1/2” x 5” screw capped 
tubes, incubated for 18 hours and then held at 4°C pending phage typing. 

Pigment formation could nearly always be determined on NAS follow- 
ing 18 hour incubation at 37*^0. Failing this, tubes were held at room 
temperature for one week and reexamined for pigment. Cultures showing 
colours ranging from cream to golden yellow (excluding paper white and 
lemon yellow) were retained for further examination. 

Mannitol fermentation was determined by inoculating a loopful of 
culture from an overnight NAS culture to 3 of peptone water containing 
0.5^'"^ mannitol and Andrade’s indicator. Cultures were incubated at 37°C 
for 10 days before being considered negative mannitol fermenters. Pro¬ 
duction of acid was recorded as (+), absence of acid formation was re¬ 
corded as (-). 

Penicillin sensitivity was determined by the ’’ditch plate method”, 
which was done in each case within three days after the organism was 
isolated. A trough (J” x 3”) was cut in BAP medium and the section of 
agar removed. Bacterial strains were streaked on the surface of the 
medium from the edge of the ditch to the outer edge of the plate. 0.5 ml. 
of penicillin (10 units per ml.) was placed in the ditch and plates were

incubated overnight at 37°C. Follovdng incubation resistant organisms 
were found to grow up to the edge of the ditch while sensitive organisms 
usually grew to within only of the edge of the ditch. Organisms sen¬ 
sitive to penicillin were recorded as ’’penicillin S”, and organisms re¬ 
sistant to penicillin were recorded as ’’penicillin R”. 

Coagulase production was determined by adding 0,5 dL. of an 18 hour 
NB culture of the bacterium under test to an eaual amount of human plasma 
diluted 1:1 with normal saline (0,85/^). After incubation for four hours 
in a 37°C water bath, tubes were examined for evidence of clotting. 

Tubes showing a negative result were held at room temperature (20oc) and 
reexamined the follovdng morning. The formation of clot of the small 
envelope type, or greater, was considered to be evidence of coagulase 
production. Production of coagulase was recorded as ”coagulase+” and 
the absence of coagulase production was recorded as ’’coagulase 

Phage suspensions v/ere held at 4°C and used at their GTD for typing 
purposes. The potency of each suspension was checked once a week and 
adjusted accordingly. To facilitate the typing procedure, suspensions 
were 'numbered from 1 to 21, the numbering system conforming with the 
marking of etched areas on the plastic tem.plates. Each bacterial strain 
to be typed was first grovm in NB for 4-6 hours or for 18 hours at 37^C, 
whichever proved to be more convenient. 

The agar plate spread method vi&s employed. Follovring the drying in 
of host cells on two plates, the plates were labelled A and B and placed 
on the templates. One standard loopful of each phage suspension vras in¬ 
oculated on the appropriate area of the plate and allowed to dry. The

The degree of lysis occurring was recorded as: 


no lysis 

1+ discrete plaques 
2-)- semi-confluent lysis 
3 confluent lysis with secondarj?- growth 
4-f- confluent lysis 

PL4TE IIA shows the degrees of lysis which conform with this method of 
recording phage action* Bacterial cultures were considered as typeable 
by phage, only when 3‘flysis or 4-f lysis occurred. 

PMTE IIB demonstrates phage action by closely related phages (47, 
47B, and 47C) on one bacterial strain. In this instance, the bacterial 
strain was recorded as sensitive to phage 47 but not to phages 47B or 
47C. 

A total of 963 strains of Staphylococcus aureus strains were inves¬ 
tigated. Of this number, 51^ (53.79$^) proved to be non-typeable, while 
445 ( 46 . 21 ^) proved to be sensitive to at least one phage preparation. 
Non-typeable Bacterial Strains 

51 s of the bacterial strains examined could not be phage typed by 
the suspensions used. Table 27 and table 28 show the relationship of 
non-t 3 q)eable strains to penicillin and coagulase production. 

Z<46 ( 86 . 29 ^) of the non-typeable strains fermented mannitol v±th the 
production of acid while 71 (13-71)^) failed to ferment mannitol.

It is interesting to note that the number of typeable and non-type- 
able strains which produced coagulase is about the same. The majorit^^ 
of typeable strains were penicillin resistant and about the same number 
of non-typeable strains were penicillin sensitive. 


































71.0> of the typeable strains were sensitive to six individual 
phages or phage patterns. These phages fall into two groups, the (3A, 
33 , 51 ) group and the (6, 47) group. Of the phages within these groups, 
29A, and 473 did not lyse any bacterial strain by themselves, although 
each was involved in two phage patterns. 

Table 31 shows the percent of typeable and non-typeable strains in 
relation to each category (based on penicillin sensitivity and coagulase 
production).

It is interesting to note that the majority of organisms lysed by 
phages 3A^ 6, 47^ and pattern 6/47^ are coagulase positive and penicillin 
resistant. Organisms lysed by phages 3B and 31 are also coag>j.lase pos¬ 
itive, but differ in their reaction to penicillin, the vast majority■being 
penicillin sensitive. 

An examination of the "total typeable strains" revealed that the 
percentage of each phage-type organism was a,lmost identical in those iso¬ 
lated from nose and throat specimens and those isolated from miscellaneous 
specimens. The only exception of note being that 27*5/0 of the typeable 
miscellaneous specimens were 'sensitive to phage 6, while only 17*6^ of

the typeablenose and throat specimens were sensitive to the same phage. 
Only two of 15 specimens isolated from blood cultures could be phage typed, 
these were included with the miscellaneous specimens. 

Table 34 shows the typeablenose and throat, and miscellaneous spec¬ 
imens and their relationship to penicillin and coagulase production. No 
great difference was noted in the percentage of each group in relation to 
coagulase production or penicillin sensitivity.

The persistence of staphylococcal sensitivity to particular phages 
was examined. The bacterial strain used was chosen because of the multi¬ 
plicity of phages to which it was sensitive in varying degrees. The bac¬ 
terial strain was phage typed within two weeks after being isolated and 
was then held on NAS at 4*^0. Transfers to new NAS were made once each 


month.

After a period of 18 nionths the strain was plated on NAPs and follow¬ 
ing overnight incubation at 37^C a series of 25 separate colonies were 
picked to tubes of NB. The NB was incubated (18 hours at 37°C) and each 
culture was examined for phage sensitivity. 

Resulting phage patterns were of three types, two being different 
to the original pattern. No action by new phage was noted.

A study of table 35 suggests that variation A is merely intermediate 
between the original pattern and variation B, and not a final variation. 

PL/iTE 12 illustrates both of these variations. 

Conclusion 

Bacterial variants to phage sensitivity occur during prolonged main¬ 
tenance at 4°C, with intermittent sub cliI tuning.

SUMM^JiY 

(1) A total of 963 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. 
Of this number 53.79^ proved to be non-typeable while 46.21^ were type- 
able, The number of typeable and non-typeable strains which produced 
coagulase was about the same. The majority of phage-typeable strains 
were penicillin resistant, 

( 2 ) Phages and phage patterns most frequently encountered were 3A, 3B, 
6, 31> 47 and 6/47. These accounted for 71.0^ of all typeable bacterial 
strains. 

( 3 ) During prolonged maintenance at 4®C bacterial variants occurred. 
Some of these differed in phage susceptibility from the parent strain, 

( 4 ) Phage typing of staphylococci was most satisfactory when^ 

(a) host cells were typed as soon as possible after isolation, but 
otherwise when held at kPo until typed. 

(b) the agar plate spread method (page 3B) was employed using host 
cells grown in neo-peptone broth (page 93) for 4-6 hours, and phage sus¬ 
pensions at their CTD. 

(c) plates were incubated for 6 hours at 37^C followed by 12 hours 
at 20^0 or for 18 hours at 30°C. 

It is probably advisable to type 3 or 4 cultures picked from the 
original plate. An organism should not be reported as sensitive to 
phage unless 3"^or 4+lysis occurs.

GENERAL DISCUSSION 




General Discussion 


The propagation and maintenance of phage suspensions is, generally- 
speaking, not affected by minor variations in individual factors such as 
pH, NaCl concentration, temperature, etc. Pro-vided that these factors 
are kept within the limits that are usual in the cultivation and mainten¬ 
ance of bacterial cultures, phage does not appear to be greatly affected. 
However, it is possible that the summation of a number of individually 
negligable variations may have a marked effect; indeed it is very diffi¬ 
cult otherwise to explain the occasional complete loss of phage in rou¬ 
tine preparation or storage. Even a two factor variation can have a con¬ 
siderable influence. For example, phage may be propagated and maintained 
satisfactorily icjithin a range of NaCl concentration (0,25^ - 1.75^) >/hen 
the pH is 7*4 - 7*6. A variation in pH from this range undoubtedly 
limits the concentration of MaCl in which phage may be propagated or 
maintained (p 64). Although this restriction may be slight, it suggests 
the cumulative effect of further variations, as in factors such as nu¬ 
trient materials, temperature and so on, and suggests the probability 
that these may easily determine the loss or destruction of a bacterial 
virus. 

Too many investigators are satisfied with passable propagation and 
maintenance of phage suspensions, provided these suspensions will last 
just long enough, in sufficient potency, to permit the investigator to 
study some aspect of phage action. In so doing, many workers are losing 
sight of the most fundamental factors in relation to phage and its 
action v/ith host cells. 

To determine the exact set of limits within the interrelationship 
of all the possible variables is a tremendous, if not impracticable, task.

Nevertheless, much can be done by exact study to determine as nearly 
as possible an optimum set of conditions under which phage can be pro¬ 
pagated and maintained. In this thesis these conditions have been es¬ 
tablished for staphylococcal bacteriophage and consequently the virus 
callow be handled with reasonably constant and satisfactory results. 

The application of certan techniques and methods to particular 
problems can now be discussed, 

Twfo of the methods described for the increase of lytic activity 
were put to constant use. Variations introduced into the techniques were 
based on findings which indicated that the efficiency and convenience 
of the methods might be improved. 

The method of Wilson and Atkinson (1945a, b) proved to be of great 
value in attempts to increase the potency of phages having a particu¬ 
larly low titre. The chance of contact between host and virus in a 
fluid medium being greater than on a solid medium more rapid increase in 
phage particles resulted. However, since it was found that filtering 
through a Seitz pad greatly reduced the number of phage particles, this 
method of clearing host cells was discarded in favour of centrifugaliz- 
ation at 4000 rpm for 30 minutes, 

Williams’ (1949) method proved uns^uitable because of the freezing 
space required and the mechanical difficulty in attempting to spread a 
phage suspension evenly on "dried in" host cells, 

Desranleau’s (1951) method proved satisfactory only under certain 
conditions. The method i^jas of value only when the initial phage sus¬ 
pension was sufficiently potent to produce confluent lysis. If this was 
not the case, then the method of Wilson and Atkinson was resorted to. 

The possibility of combining Williams’ and Desranleau’s methods for phage

production was recognized but not attempted. 

Peptone exerted a great influence on phage production. Of seven 
peptones investigated, the growth stimulating property on staphylococci 
appeared equivalent, but phage production in the presence of one peptone 
far exceeded that with the others. The application of chromatography 
did not reveal the presence of any extra amino acids in this peptone, 
and indeed suggested it contained the usual amino acids in lower con¬ 
centrations. Two exf>lanations seem possible. Either the increase in 
concentration of certain amino acids is inhibitorj»- to phage, or the 
superior peptone contains substances required as phage building materials 

in an amount or combination that is more favourable than in the other 

# 

peptones. 

In view of the time of incubation being relatively brief, it is 
suggested that neo-peptone may supply some nutrient more readily ad¬ 
apted to phage nutrition or shorten the bacterial lag phase with conse¬ 
quent reduction of time elapsing between "burst periods" in phage mul¬ 
tiplication. Gordon and McLeod (1926) observed that the addition of 
various amino acids to culture media frequently introduced substances 
inhibitory to bacterial growth. The Difco Manual (194S) states that 
bacteriostatic substances are frequently present in peptones and that 
neo-peptone is apparently free from these substances. Since bacterial 
viruses are generally influenced by the same factors as are bacteria, 
it is therefore possible that neo-peptone contains fewer substances 
injurious to phage than the other peptones. 

The same peptones were examined to determine their effect on the 
keeping qualities of phage. Three of the peptones, Bacto tryptone, try- 
pticase and Bacto peptone appear to contain some substance injurious to

phage. Tryptose, poly-peptone, neo-peptone, and proteose peptone //3 
do not affect the keeping c^fualities of phage adversely. In consequence 
of these findings and the experiments on phage production, neo-peptone 
was used in place of trjrptose in glycerolated broth and in place of Bacto 
peptone in nutrient broth and nutrient agar media. Neo-peptone proved 
to be a satisfactory replacement. 

Experiments vdth NaCl showed that a small amount was necessary for 
maximum phage production and for satisfactory maintenance of phage. 

When NaCl is absent the formation of new phage particles cannot be dem¬ 
onstrated. Hershey et al (1944) investigating a coli phage variant vd-th 
E.coli , determined that the addition of 0.2M NaCl to tryptose agar had 
an efficiency factor of 10^ over that of a similar agar without salt. 

Puck ( 1949 ) working with E.coli and T1 phage demonstrated that the 
presence of electrolyte (in this case Ca ion) was necessary for viable 
T1 phage to be liberated. 

It is suggested that the presence of NaCl may be necessary for the 
adsorption of phage on host cells or for the liberation of viable phage 
particles. 

Although a small amount of NaCl enhances phage production and main¬ 
tenance a large amount is injurious to phage (pages 6 I, S5). For this 
reason, the amount of NaCl, used in media^both for propagation and main¬ 
tenance, was reduced from 0,75/^ to 0.25^ an amount which proved to be 
satisfactory. 

The application of phage to the identification of staphylococcal 
strains can be of great value. Under some conditions it permits the 
identification of the source of infection in food poisoning outbreaks 






and defines the spread of staphylococci in hospital wards. Without 
phage, the staphylococcal strains involved could not be distinguished 
one from the other and the probable source could not be identified. The 
use of phage for these purposes is, however, neither foolproof nor sat¬ 
isfactory, and its application is too restricted. 

In the present investigation only 46<»21/o of the strains examined 
could be phage-tjrped. Of the non-typeable strains only 5 * 59 % showed 
evidence of phage susceptibility when phage was used at its GTD. This 
means that more than 50 % of the specimens examined remain unidentified. 

It must be remembered that all phages were used at their GTD. hTiat then 
are the reasons for so many bacterial strains being non-typeable? I 
believe that the follovdng are wor*thy of consideration. 

There are too few phage types available. The 21 types used in this 
investigation actually belonged to only 11 comparatively unrelated 
groups. For example, the 47 group is composed of phages 47^ 47A, 47B, 
and 47G and an organism is seldom found to be sensitive to one of these 
phages without showing some sensitivity to one of the others. This means, 
then, that the distinct groups of phages available for typing staphy¬ 
lococcal organisms is quite limited. For this reason I believe that a 
great necessity exists for the isolation of more phages which can be 
applied to the typing of bacterial strains that cannot be typed at the 
present time. It is possible, of course, that new strains of phage of 
sufficient stability for use in phage typing do not exist. However, the 
results obtained by Fisk (1942), Wilson and Atkinson (1945)^ Rountree 
(1949) £nd others have shown that a large number of staphylococci are ly¬ 
sogenic, Some of these strains carried as many as 5 distinct phages, 

I believe that a great deal of attention should be given not only

to the isolation of new pha-^e strains but to sorting out the phages 
available at the present time with a view to eliminating some of the 
closely related ones and replacing them with less closely related ones. 

In this way the range of phage types can be increased and more bacterial 
strains rendered susceptible to identification by phage typing. 

In an investigation of this kind it is frequently necessary to hold 
bacterial cultures for a considerable length of time before they can be 
phage typed. The possibility that alteration in host cell steric fit¬ 
tings, for phage adsorption, might occur during this holding period, can¬ 
not be overlooked. It has been shown in this investigation that when 
cultures are held for a prolonged period of time at 4^C variants may 
arise and show an alteration in phage susceptibility as compared with 
the parent strain. This variation may be continuous because strains have 
been found intermediate in their range of phage susceptibility between 
the parent strain and late variants. It seems reasonable to assume that 
the bacterial variants which arise after storage, at for a long 
period of time, may even reach the condition of being completely insus¬ 
ceptible to phage action. If successive variations of this type do 
occur then the non-typeability of many bacterial strains might be ex¬ 
plained. It appears advisable therefore to phage-t 5 rpe Staphyloc occus 
strains as soon as possible after they have been isolated. 

In this investigation a number of non-typeable staphylococci were 
shown to be lysogenic. These bacteria are resistant to the lytic action 
of the phages which they carry. Rountree (1949) demonstrated that many 
lysogenic bacteria carry phages which lyse the bacterial strains used 
for the propagation of phage. It is possible that this information can 
be applied to the identification of lysogenic bacteria which are insen¬ 
sitive to known phages.

At the present time staphylococci are identified by the phages to 
which they are sensitive. A new scheme for the identification of lyso¬ 
genic organisms may be developed by identifying the phages which they 
carry. By spotting lysogenic organisms on the recognized propagating 
strains, the "carried phage" may be brought into contact v/ith recognized 
phage-sensitive bacteria. Lysis of the propagating strains will indicate 
the phage or phage patterns carried by the lysogenic organisms. 

Although the propagating strains are not usually considered to be 
lysogenic, it is simple to determine whether the propagating strain or 
the organism under test is the one carrying the phage. V/hen one organ¬ 
ism is placed on the other lysis occurring at the periphery indicates 
that the phage is carried by the "spotted" organisms and lysis occurring 
in the centre of the superimposed organisms indicates that the phage is 
carried by the basal culture. Some of the propagating bacterial strains 
are sensitive to more than one recognized phage type. ¥e may distin¬ 
guish between these phages by placing them with bacterial cultures known 
to be sensitive to only one of the phages in question. 

The possibility that some of the propagating strains may be sensitive 
to new phages is recognized. Lysis of any propagating strain then vdll 
indicate that one of two conditions exists, (a) the lysogenic bacterium 
carries the same phage to which the propagating strain is normally sen¬ 
sitive or (b) the lysogenic bacterium is carrj^ing a new phage type to 
which the propagating strain is sensitive. 

The procedure to be followed would be to phage type a culture in 
the manner used at the present time. If the culture proved to be non- 
typeable it would then be spotted on the established phage propagating 
strains. Lysis of the propagating strains would determine that the cul-

ture being tested was lysogenic and carried a particular phage or phage 
t^T^es. 

It seems reasonable to assume that bacterial strains carrying the 
same phages are identical, therefore the above procedure would permit 
the identification of some of the lysogenic bacterial strains and reduce 
the number of cultures at present classed as non-typeable. 

In the present investigation 59*55% of the typeable strains were 
penicillin resistant and 7^*k0% were coagulase positive. A positive cea- 
gulase test is generally regarded as an almost certain indication of pa- 
thogenicityo The fact that the majority of the coagulase positive organ¬ 
isms proved to be penicillin resistant indicates a tendency for patho¬ 
genic staphylococci to be resistant to penicillin. 

Numerous investigators have reported that bacteria sensitive to the 
6/7/47 phage group are largely composed of bacteria v^hich are coagulase 
positive and penicillin resistant. Blair and Carr (1952) found that the 
6/7/47 and 29/31/52 phage patterns included 87.5^ of the typeable coa¬ 
gulase positive, antibiotic resistant strains isolated during an inves¬ 
tigation of staphylococcal organisms found in a hospital over a period of 
time. Reports from England (^arber 1949; Barber et al 194^) and Austra¬ 
lia (Rountree and Thomson 1949; Rountree 1951) indicate that coagulase 
positive, penicillin resistant strains of the 6/7/47 and 29/31/52 phage 
groups are becoming established in hospital populations, while other 
groups are being eliminated by penicillin therapy. The results reported 
in this thesis show that at least one of these groups (6/47) is estab¬ 
lished in this province. There may be a tendency, therefore, tov^ard 
worldwide distribution of identical phage-type strains of Staphylococcus 


aureus.

Conclusions 

The method of Wilson and Atkinson (1945a, b) is the most effect¬ 
ive of those employed for increasing the potency of a low titre phage 
suspension, Desranleau's method is satisfactory only when the initial 
phage suspension has a high titre. 

Minor variations in individual factors such as pH, NaCl concentra¬ 
tion, temperature, etc. do not greatly affect the propagation and main¬ 
tenance of phage suspensions. However, the cumulative effect of these 
minor variations may determine the loss or destruction of a bacterial 
virus. 

Phage production in the presence of neo-peptone far exceeds that with 
the other peptones examined. Maximum phage production is conditioned by 
the presence of a small amount of sodium chloride. 

The application of phage to the identification of staphylococci 
is too restricted. In view of the large number of non-typeable bacterial 
strains encountered it is apparent that a need exists for the isolation 
of additional phage strains. 

The majority of staphylococcal strains, which can be phage-typed, 
are resistant to penicillin and produce coagulase. One phage group 
(6/47)j which appears to have a world-wide distribution, is established 
in this province.
