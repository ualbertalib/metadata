GLYOXALINES IN URINE AND THE KNOOP TEST 


I INTRODUCTION 

In 1908 Engeland*(7) first proved the 
presence of glyoxaline derivatives in human 
urine when he isolated from it histidine and 
two other unidentified glyoxalines. Histidine 
has subsequently been isolated from measles 
urine by Hunter (10) and from pregnancy urine 
by Armstrong and alker (2). Ackermann and 
Fuchs (1) and Hunter and Raragosky (unpublished 
data) succeeded in isolating histidine from normal 
urine• 

Histamine too has been isolated but in very 
small quantities. Ackermann and Fuchs (1) obtained 
only 0.9 mg. of Histamine Dipicrate from 1000 
litres of normal urine. Recently Kapeller - Adler (13) 
isolated a small amount from urines of pregnant 
women with eclampsia. Thus it is unlikely that 
histamine constitutes a significant part of the 
glyoxalines present in urine. 

In recent years interest in urinary glyoxalines 
has been increased by the claims notably of 
Kapeller - Adler (16), (17) that histidine 
excretion is increased during pregnancy. She 









- 2 - 


clairas that the excretion of histidine in the 
urine is dependent on the presence of an enzyme, 
histidinase, in the liver. Her theory is that, 
in pregnancy, the histidinase activity of the 
liver is inhibited and hence the appearance 
of unchanged histidine in the urine. She bases 
her evidence largely on the finding that the 
urines of pregnant women give a positive Knoop 
test that is not found in the urine of men or of non 
pregnant women. 

In view of the facts that histidine has been 
isolated from normal male and female urine, and 
the Knoop test is described as being specific for 
histidine, there appears to be some discrepancy in 
Kapeller - Adler's theory. 

The present investigation v/as carried out to 
study the relationship that does exist between 
urine glyoxalines and the Knoop test. During the 
course of our experiments we found that there are 
several substances, even in normal urine which give 
a Knoop test. Among these is histidine. But the 
bulk of the colour given in the test appeared to 
come from material other than histidine and not 
glyoxaline in composition. The investigation then 










































































proceeded with a view to determine the nature of 
the main Knoop giving substance.

II HISTORY OF THE KNOOP RFACTION 

When a very slight excess of bromine is added 
to a solution of histidine, and the solution then 
warmed, a wine - mauve colour Is produced, the 
intensity of which depends on the concentration of 
histidine present. This is the Knoop test as it 
was first described in 1908 (20). The test was 
said to be specific for histidine and was sensitive 
in a dilution of 1:1000. Histamine also gave a 
reaction but was much less sensitive. 

Hunter (11) modified the reaction somewhat by 
using chloroform to remove the excess bromine and 
thereby increased bot the delicacy and certainty 
of the test. The sensitivity was now increased to 
1 : 10 , 000 . 

In 1932 Armstrong and Walker ( 2 ) found the 
reaction worked best in a faintly acid solution. 

Kapeller - Adler (15) claimed to further 
sensitize the reaction so as to give a test in a 
dilution of 1:50,000. She added a if bromine in 
33^ acetic acid solution in slight excess, let it 
stand for ten minutes, and then made the solution 
ammoniacal with an ammonium hydroxide - ammonium 
carbonate mixture. On heating in a water bath for 
five minutes a blue - violet colour developed.

Conrad and Berg (5) recommended the use of 
arsenious oxide for the removal of excess bromine. 

Recently Racker (22) claimed to increase the 
sensitivity of the Knoop test to 1:100,000 by the 
presence of sodium urate. 

The Knoop test is not quite specific for 
histidine. It is also given by histamine or 
iminazolylethylamine (Knoop (20) and Hunter (11) ) 
and by N - methylhistidine, where the methyl group 
is attached to the N of the ring, (Linneweh et al (21) 
and Armstrong and Walker (2) ). Adrenaline and 
tyramine also give a reaction with bromine but of 
a different type, and easily distinguishable from 
the histidine test. (Armstrong and Walker (2) ). 
Tryptophane (Hunter (11) ) gives a reaction in the 
cold and the colour developed is easily extractable 
with amyl alcohol. Indoxyl gives a bright red 
colour which is readily extractable wit amyl alcohol. 

The test is interfered with by tyrosine, 
tryptophane, methioneine (Woolley and Peterson (34) ) 
and glycine (Kapeller - Adler (16) ). 

Attempts have been made by many workers to 
apply the Knoop test to human urine especially 
since Voge (26) suggested it as a means for the 
early detection of pregnancy. He claimed 95 % 































































- 6 - 


agreement with Aschelm-Zondek tests. Burt - 7/hite 
(4) obtained similar results. 

Many contradictory results have been published 
since then about histidine excretion in urine. 
Kapeller - Adler (16), (17), (18) has written a 
series of papers supporting her claim that a positive 
Knoop test is given only by urines of pregnant women. 
Papers by Weiss (33), Henton (23) and Dello Jojo (6) 
upheld Kapeller - Adler’s theory. 

However Foldes (8) seriously questioned the 
value of the pregnancy test since he obtained tests 
in urines of non pregnant women. Also Tschopp and 
Tsohopp (24) came to the conclusion that histidine 
is excreted so etimes in normal but more frequently 
in some pathological conditions. This was especially 
so in liver diseases and allergic conditions. 

It is apparent that the literature on the 
Knoop test is full of variations and contradictions 
and at the present time no uniform agreement exists 
on the specificity of the Knoop test. Thus it is 
evident that there is need for a systematic study of 
the Knoop reaction.

III SCOPE OF TK WOPJK 

The present study has resolved itself into 
three main topics: 

A. The development of a satisfactory procedure 
for the Knoop test. 

B. A study of Knoop test in relation to urinary 
glyoxalines. 

C. A study of the nature of the Knoop giving 
substances in human urine.

IV EXP 'HIMENTAL 

A. The Development of a Satisfactory Procedure 
for the Knoop Test 

The reagents and method used were similar in 
part to those employed by Conrad and Berg (5). We 
did, however, introduce certain modifications. 
Reagents Used 

1. Histidine solution - concentration 1 mg. 
per ml. 

2. 5N Acetic Acid. 

3. Saturated bromine water. 

4. Saturated solution of arsenious oxide in 
10$ ammonia. 

5. Ammonium acetate solution made by just 
neutralizing concentrated ammonia with 
glacial acetic acid. 

In developing the procedure we found there 
were several variable factors in the production of 
the maximum colour. 

These factors were:- 

(a) reaction of the test solution. 

(b) time of bromination. 

(c) large excess of bromine. 

(d) temperature during bromination. 

(e) volume of solution. 














- 9 - 


(f) ammoniaoal mixture used. 

(a) Reaction of the test solution. 

Three tubes containing 0.1 ml. histidine 
solution and varying amounts of acid 

(1) no acid 

(2) 2 drops 5N acetic 

(3) 2 drops glacial acetic 

Bromine was added drop by drop until an excess 
was present. The tube was let stand for 5 minutes, 
after which the excess bromine was removed by the 
addition of a drop of the arsenious oxide solution. 
Finally 0.5 ml. of ammonium acetate solution was 
added and the tubes set in a boiling water bath. 

There was only a trace of colour in (1) but 
about the same good purple colours in ( 2 ) and (3). 

This shows that we must brominate in an acid 
solution. 

(b) Time of bromination. 

Four tubes - each containing 0.1 ml. histidine 
solution, 2 drops 5N acetic and 1 drop (excess) 
bromine. 

After 2, 4, 6 and 10 minutes we added 1 drop 
arsenious oxide solution and 0.5 ml. ammonium 
acetate and heated for 5 minutes in a boiling water 
bath. The tube with only 2 minutes bromination 




















- 10 - 


was lightest in colour, the others all had much 
the same oolour. This shows there is a time factor 
at this stage. 

Five minutes was taken as a suitable time for 
bromination. 

(c) Effect of a large excess of bromine. 

Three tubes - each containing 0.1 ml. histidine 
solution and 2 drops 5N acetic acid. 

(1) added 3 drops bromine 

(2) added 3 drops bromine after 5 minutes 

(3) added 3 drops bromine after 9 minutes 
After ten minutes the Knoop tests were completed 

Number (3) was very faint, (1) and (2), however, 
were about the same. This shows that a large excess 
of bromine does not give less colour development 
as long as the excess is removed before the addition 
of the ammoniacal solution. However, a large excess 
still does not dispense with the need for 5-10 
minutes contact with bromine. On the other hand, 
the solution must be fully saturated with bromine 
in order to get the maximum Knoop. 

(d) Te perature during bromination. 

Five tubes containing 0.1 ml. histidine solution 
and 2 drops 5N acetic acid left for 10 minutes with 
excess bromine 










- 11 - 


(1) in frigidaire (about 4 - 5°;) 

(2) at 24°C 

(3) at 37 °C 

(4) at 55°C 

(5) at 80°C 

Knoop on (5) was quite negative and there was 

only a faint colour in (1). Good colours in (2), 

o 

(3) and (4) - if anything, it is best at 37 C. 

o 

Thus it would appear that 5 minutes at 37 C 
represents good conditions for a maximum Knoop. 

(e) Volume of solution. 

Tests showed that the smaller the volume in 
which the colour is produced the greater the final 
colour. 

(f) Ammoniacal mixture used. 

Tests were done using 

(1) saturated ammonium sulphate solution. 

(2) ammonium hydroxide - ammonium carbonate 
mixture as used by Kapeller - Adler (15). 

( 3 ) ammonium acetate solution made by just 
neutralizing concentrated ammonium hydroxide 
with glacial acetic acid. 

From the foregoing tests the optimum conditions 
were chosen and incorporated into our procedure 
for the Knoop test.

Stan ard Prooedure for doing the Knoop T^st. 

1. To 0.1 ml. of histidine solution in a test 

tube is added two drops of 5N acetic acid and 

saturated bromine water drop by droo until there is 

a definite excess (usually 1-2 drops are sufficient). 

o 

2. The tube is set in a water bat at 37 C 
for 5 minutes. 

3. Excess bromine is removed by the addition 
of a drop of arsenious oxide solution, immediately 
after which 0.5 ml. of ammonium acetate solution is 
added. 

4. The test tube is placed in a boiling water 
bath for 5 minutes for full color development. 

Sensitivity of Our Method vs. Kapeller - Adler*s 

Method. 

Two series (A and B) of tubes containing 
0.1, 0.08, 0.06, 0.04, 0.02 and 0.005 mg. histidine 
in 0.1 ml. of solution. 

Final volume of test solution is about 1.0ml. 
Series A. - Our Method. 

0.06 tube showed a definite colour 
0.04 tube was questionable 

Taking 0.05 mg. in 1 ml. of solution as the 
limiting concentration, the sensitivity of the test 













- 13 - 


is 1:20,000. 

Series B. - Kapeller - Adler’s Method (15) 

0.1 tube showed a colour about half as strong 
as same tube in series A. 

0.06 tube showed no colour. 

Therefore, sensitivity by this method is about 
1:12,500. 

7/e have thus been unable to duplicate Kapeller - 
Adler’s claim that her test is sensitive in a dilution 
of 1:50,000. 

It might be mentioned here that we investigated 
Racker’s claim (22) of increasing the sensitivity 
to 1:100,000 by the presence of sodium -irate but 
we found a discrepancy in the method. Our tests 
showed that both sodium urate and uric acid them¬ 
selves gave a bright pink colour in the Knoop test, 
the intensity of which was roughly proportional 
to the amount used. We concluded, therefore, that 
the increased colour obtained was derivable from 
the oxidation product of uric acid in contact with 
bromine, namely alloxantin. Alloxantin gives a pink 
colour under the conditions of the Knoop test even 
without bromination. Alloxan and parabanic acid 
both gave positive tests as well.

Compa rlson of Knoop Test on Histidine and Hlstaralne. 

Both the histidine and histamine solutions 
used had a concentration of 1 mg./ml. 

Colour of Knoop Test 

1. 0.1 ml. histidine mauve colour 

2. 0.2 ml. histidine deep purple 

3. 0.1 ml. histamine pale yellow 

4. 0.2 ml. histamine darker yellow 

In more concentrated solutions histamine gives 
a purple colour. Its sensitivity is only about a 
third that of histidine.

B. The Knoop Test in Relation to Urinary 0 l.yo - alines. 

After the development of a satisfactory 
method for the test, we undertook to study the 
Knoop test of urine. Assuming that histidine 
was responsible for the Knoop test, we attempted 
to correlate the Knoop test with the glyoxaline 
content of the urine as determined by the diazo 
method of Hunter and Raragosky (14). 

Preparation of the Glyoxaline Fraction from Urine 

Five ml. of urine is placed in a 15 ml. 
centrifuge tube, followed by 4.0 ml. of 40$ normal 
lead acetate with shaking. Four ml. of 2.0 N 
sodium hydroxide is then added, and the contents 
thoroughly mixed. The tube is then centrifuged 
until the precipitate is well packed and the super¬ 
natant is poured off through a small filter paper 
into a 50 ml. centrifuge tube. The drained lead 
precipitate is washed well with 3.0 ml. of water 
and the tube again centrifuged. The supernatant 
fluid is filtered as before. The filtrate, which 
is clear, colourless and slightly alkaline, 
contains a tr ce of lead. This lead is precipitated 
by the addition of a few drops of 20 % disodium 
hydrogen phosphate solution. The tube is again 
centrifuged and the supernatant is poured into a 
glass evaporating dish which is then placed on a 




























- 16 - 


boiling water bath and the contents boiled to 
dryness. The white crystalline residue is dissolved 
in a little water, transferred to a graduated 
centrifuge tube and made up to 10 ml. The glyoxaline 
fraction has thus twice the volume of the native 
urine. 

Tie Diazo Test. 

The reagents used 

1. Diazo Reagent - Koessler and Hanke (19) 

- made from two stock solutions. 

A. Nine gm. of sulphanilio acid with 90 ml. 
of 37% hydrochloric aoid is made up to 

1 litre with water. 

B. Fifty gm. of 90% sodium nitrite is made 
up to 1 litre with water. Solution is 
kept in a refrigerator. 

The reagent is prepared by placing in a 
50 ml. volumetric flask, immersed in ice 
water, 1.5 ml. of solution A along with 
1.5 ml. of solution B. After five minutes 
6.0 ml. of solution B is added, and after 
5 minutes ore the flask is filled to the 
50 ml. mark with cold water. The glass 
stopper is inserted and the contents 
thoroughly mixed. After 15 minutes the

reagent la ready for use. 

2. A freshly prepared 1.1/ solution of best 
quality anhydrous sodium carbonate. 

The colour standard of Hunter (12) was used. 

This is made from two stock solutions. 

A. Stock methyl orange - consists of 0.1 gm. 
of pure methyl orange made up to 100 ml. 
with water. 

B. Stock congo red - consists of 0.2 gm. of 
pure congo red made up to 100 ml. with water. 

To about 80 ml. of distilled water in a 100 ml. 
volumetric flask is added 0.40 ml. of stock congo 
red solution and 0.06 ml. of stock methyl orange 
solution. The contents are mixed and made up to 
volume. Some of this colour standard is placed in 
the right hand cup of a semi-micro colorimeter of 
the Duboscq type. 

Into the other cup is placed (0.5 - x) ml. of 
water, 2.5 ml. of 1.1% sodium carbonate solution 
and 1.0 ml. of diazo reagent, and the time noted. 

The cup is agitated to mix. One minute later 
x ml. of the urinary glyoxaline fraction is added. 

The cup is quickly placed in the colorimeter and 
the contents mixed by raising and lowering the 
plunger several times. The plunger is then set at 





. 


















. 










-la- 

a depth of 10 mm. The standard solution plunger 
is moved to match. Maximum colour is reached after 
3-4 minutes. 

All determinations are carried out with at 
least two quantities of the solution under 
examination in order to test the proportionality. 

With the test solution set at 10 mm. 1 mm. of 
standard is equivalent to 0.001352 mg. of histidine 
or 0.0010 mg. of "glyoxaline." 

Knoop tests were done both on the native 
urine and on the glyoxaline fraction (filtrate from 
lead precipitate). In order to compare the Knoop 
tests on the two, the native urine was diluted once 
with water. 

Thus, since 1.0 ml. of the glyoxaline fraction 
was used for a test, 0.5 ml. of urine was diluted 
with 0.5 ml. of water for the corresponding test. 

The tests were carried out as previously described. 

The degree of the test was indicated relatively 
trace - pale yellow 

+ - pale violet 

++ - mauve colour 

+++ - dark mauve to purple. 

++++ - very dark purple. 

The determinations were done on pregnancy 
urines hot pre and post delivery. The pre delivery 














- 19 - 

sample was a single specimen usually taken about 
6 to 12 hours before delivery where this was 


possible. However, the post delivery sample was 


a 24 

hour specimen collected about the 

third 

day 

post parturn. The 

results 

are tabulated.

There is no proportionality whatsoever between 
the glyoxaline content and the Knoop test. 

In the oase of Subject 2, the glyoxaline contents 
per 5 ml. of the pre and post specimens were practically 
identical, yet the Knoop tests on both the native 
urine and glyoxaline fractions are greater in the case 
of the post specimen. 

In the glyoxaline fraction a "one plus" Knoop 
test is given by specimens in which the glyoxaline 
content varies from 0.35 - 2.70 mg./5ml. and a negative 
test is given by a specimen with a content of 1.41 
mg./5 ml. 

In the native urine, too, a "one plus" test is 
given by specimens in which the content varies from 
0.20 - 1.70 mg./5 ml. and yet a specimen with only 
0.30 mg./5 ml. gave a ’two plus" Knoop. Two specimens 
with 1.70 and 2.66 mg./5 ml. gave "three plus" Knoop 
tests and one with 2.70 mg./5 ml.gave a "four plus" 
test. 

However, in practically every case, there is a 
marked differenee between the Knoop tests of the native 
urine and the glyoxaline fraction. 

This could mean one or both of two things. 

(1) The glyoxaline fraction contains substances 

. which inhibit Knoop colour development. 

(2) Some Knoop giving substance is removed in the

lead precipitate. 

(1) On investigating the dependability of the 
Knoop test on the lead filtrate it was found that 
urines vary in their behaviour. 

When 0.1 or 0.2 mg. histidine per ml. is added 
to the filtrates and a Knoop test done, those with 
histidine added are often questionably distinguishable 
from filtrates without added histidine. 

If 1.0 or 2.0 mg. histidine per ml. is added, we 
get a slight brown intensification. 

Some lead filtrates will, however, give good 
tests and, on the addition of histidine, will show an 
intensification of colour approximating the histidine 
added. 

(2) The lead precipitate from the preparation of 
the Glyoxaline Fraction was washed and then freed with 
5 N sulphuric acid until the supernatant was acid to 
congo red paper. The supernatant was centrifuged off 
and a Knoop test done on it gave a strong brown colour. 
A little of this colour was extractable with anyl 
alcohol. A diazo test on this supernatant was a pale 
yellow colour. 

Thus, we have evidence that one or more Knoop 
giving substances are removed in the lead precipitate. 


























- 23 - 


These two experiments explain the difference in 
the Knoop test of the Native Urine and the Glyoxaline 
Fraction. 




C. A Study of the Nature of the Knoop Glvln~ Substances 


After the demonstration of the presence of Knoop 
giving substances in the lead precipitate, we under¬ 
took to study the nature of these substances. 

We attempted to isolate these substances but were 
unsuccessful in doing so. We did, however, fractionate 
the precipitate so that we obtained a sticky resinous 
like concentrate which gave a strong Knoop test. 

In the lead precipitate there are present lead 
salts of such inorganic radicals as, phosphates, 
carbonates, sulphates and sulphide; such organic 
materials as sugars, acetone bodies, phenols and 
purines; and such pigments as urochrome, urobilin and 
its chromogen and bilirubin. 

The lead precipitate was fractionated into two 
portions: 

A. That which comes down on the addition of 
normal lead acetate to the urine - Acid 
Lead Fraction. 

B. That which comes down on the addition of 
sodium hydroxide to the filtrate of the 
acid lead fraction - Basic Lead Fraction.

Lead Fraotlonatlon 

To one litre of urine in a 3 litre erlenraeyer 
flask was added half its volume (500 ml.) of 40% 
normal lead acetate solution. The fine light buff 
coloured precipitate was allowed to settle for a few 
hours, after which the clear yellow supernatant was 
carefully poured off through a dry filter paper so as 
to remove floating particles. The remainder of the 
mixture was centrifuged in 250 ml. cups and the super¬ 
natant added to the filtrate. 

The precipitate (Fraction A) was washed well by 
dispersing it thoroughly in distilled water and 
centrifuging the mixture again. The wash water was 
discarded. 

To the filtrate from the acid lead precipitate 
was then added 500 ml. of 2.0 N sodium hydroxide. 

The creamy coloured precipitate was allowed to settle, 
and the supernatant - the glyoxaline fraction, which 
is almost colourless, was here discarded. 

The precipitate (Fraction B) was collected in a 
250 ml. centrifuge cup and washed as before. 

Both precipitates were now treated in exactly 
the same way. 

The precipitate was transferred to a mortar and 
then 5 N sulphuric acid was added in small quantities

until the supernatant was blue to oongo red paper. 

Then the acid was added two drops at a time until 
the supernatant gave a positive test for sulphate ion 
with barium chloride. The mixture was centrifuged and 
the clear yellow-orange coloured supernatant poured 
through a dry filter paper. 

Knoop tests were done on an aliquot of each of 
the supernatants. In all but two of the urines 
investigated, there was a greater concentration of 
Knoop giving substances in the basic fraction. 

The acid lead fraction was more orange in colour 
than the clear golden yellow colour of the basic 
fraction. The precipitate left, after the removal of 
the acidic and basic fractions was supposedly lead 
sulphate. If, however, more acid was added to this 
precipitate, a dark orange-brown supernatant was 
obtained which did give a Knoop test. On standing, it 
turned even darker and eventually- blackened, thus 
indicating decomposition had taken place. 

It was decided to devote the investigation mainly 
to the basic lead fraction since it contained the 
greatest portion of the Knoop giving substance. The 
acid lead precipitate was washed with acetone, dried 
and stored as a dry powder for future investigation. 

The lead free supernatant from the basic fraction 
was left overnight in the refrigerator. Small brown 
crystals separated out. These were filtered off and

on testing proved to be urio aoid. 

The filtrate was ooncentrated in vaouo. At a 
certain stage the solution became cloudy and a precipit¬ 
ate came down. It was filtered off through a sintered 
glass funnel. The Knoop test was negative and it was 
discarded. 

Mercury Fractionation 

The filtrate was then put through a mercury 
fractionation. Mercuric acetate (25%) was added until 
there was no further precipitation. The solution was 
then made just alkaline to litmus with sodium carbonate 
(10%) and the mixture centrifuged. The precipitate 
was washed well with a little distilled water contain¬ 
ing a few drops of sodium carbonate. The precipitate 
was suspended in a little water, made acid with a 
little sulphuric acid and then hydrogen sulphide was 
bubbled through to free the material of mercury. The 
mercuric sulphide was centrifuged off, washed and 
discarded, while the filtrate and washings were 
evaporated in vacuo to remove the hydrogen sulphide. 

A Knoop test done on the concentrate showed that there 
had been very little loss of material in this 
fractionation.

Silver Fractionation 

The procedure used was similar to that described 
by Vickery and Leavenworth (25). 

One ml. of the concentrated filtrate from the 
mercury fractionation was put through a silver 
fractionation. 

Silver nitrate (10%) was added until a definite 
excess was present as was demonstrable by the develop¬ 
ment of an immediate brown spot - test with barium 
hydroxide solution. The precipitate (A) was centri¬ 
fuged off and washed. Saturated barium hydroxide 
solution was added to the filtrate until the solution 
had reached a pH of 6.4. Precipitate (B) was centri¬ 
fuged off and washed. To this filtrate more barium 
hydroxide was added until the solution now was at a 
pH of 7.4. Precipitate (C) was centrifuged off and 
washed. Finally barium hydroxide was added until there 
was no further precipitation. Precipitate (D) was 
centrifuged off and washed. Filtrate (E) was saved. 

Precipitates A, B, C, D and filtrate E were made 
acid with sulphuric acid and freed with hydrogen 
sulphide. The supernatants were centrifuged off and 
evaporated to dryness on a boiling water bath. The 
residues were dissolved in a little water and made 
up to a volume of 1 ml.

Knoop and 

diazo tests were done on 

the five 

solutions.

There seemed to be a little loss of the Knoop 
substance in this fractionation. However, the remainder 
of the concentrate from the mercury fractionation was 
put through the silver fractionation. Only the 
precipitate between the pH range of 6.2 - 7.6 was 
saved. The precipitate was washed and freed in the 
usual manner with hydrogen sulphide. The supernatant 
was evaporated to dryness on a water bath and made 
up to 10 ml. volume. Knoop test was positive but showed 
a little loss in the fractionation. 

P hosphotungstlo Acid Precipitation 

The method of Hunter and Eagles (13) was followed. 
The solution from the silver fractionation was made 
0.5 N with respect to sulphuric acid by the addition 
of the requisite amount of 10 N acid. Then a 20; 
solution of phosphotungstic acid in 0.5 N sulphuric

aoid was added to a point where further addition caused 
no precipitation in a test portion of the supernatant. 

The tube was lightly stoppered and allowed to stand 
overnight in the refrigerator for oomplete precipitation 
to take place. In the morning the preoipitate was 
centrifuged off care being taken to keep the temperature 
of the solution as low as possible throughout the 
entire procedure. The preoipitate was washed twice 
with its own volume of ice - cold 0.5 N sulphuric 
acid to which had been added a little of the phospho- 
tungstic acid solution. 

Solid barium hydroxide was added to the precipit¬ 
ate until the supernatant solution tested definitely 
alkaline to litmus. The mixture was centrifuged and 
the filtrate decanted through a filter. The precipitate 
was washed thoroughly three times with 0.1 N barium 
hydroxide solution and the washings added to the filtrate 

The strongly alkaline filtrate and washings 
were heated to boiling. 5 N sulphuric acid was added 
till no further precipitation occurred. The barium 
sulphate precipitate was centrifuged off and washed 
with a little hot water. Quantitative removal of both 
Ba + * and S0 4 " ions was effected by the addition of 
the required volumes of 0.1 N barium hydroxide and 
sulphuric acid.

Knoop and diazo tests were done on the 
phosphotungstlc acid preoipitate and filtrate 
fractions. 

Knoop Diazo 

Preoipitate fraction negative negative 

Filtrate fraotion positive pale pink 

Thus the Knoop giving substance is not 
preoipitated by phosphotungstio acid. 

The filtrate fraction was concentrated in vacuo 
to a small volume and a little absolute ethanol added 
to bring about crystallization. The tube was stoppered 
and set in the refrigerator over night. In the morning 
there was no sign of crystals. The alcohol and as 
much of the water as possible were evaporated in vacuo. 
The material left in the tube was a sticky mass. It 
was taken up in a little absolute methanol and left 
in the refrigerator for crystallization. The material, 

t 

in the morning, showed no sign of crystal structure 
and had darkened considerably indicating decomposition 
had taken place and was discarded. 

The foregoing fractionation procedures were 
repeated twioe more. The first time the material was 
lost in the silver fractionation and the second time 
the Knoop giving substances were unstable to the 
mercury fractionation.

No reason for these inconsistent results 
oould be discovered. 

The Potassium Salt Formation Method of E xtraction . 

This procedure was found to be the most stable 
method of extracting the Knoop giving substanoe. 

2.0 N potassium hydroxide was used as the base 
in the basic lead precipitation. 

The basic lead preoipitate was treated with 
5 N sulphuric acid until the first faint blue tinge 
with congo red paper (pH about 3.5 - 4) was obtained. 
At this pH it was thought that all of the lead salt 
of the Knoop giving substance was soluble and the 
supernatant solution was centrifuged off. The 
precipitate left was found to contain some Knoop 
substanoe but the loss of this amount was more than 
compensated for by the stability of the extract. 

The supernatant was treated with a saturated 
solution of potassium sulphate. The theory was that 
the potassium ion replaced the lead ion in the salt 
of the unknown substance and the lead was removed as 
insoluble lead sulphate. Potassium hydroxide was used 
as the base above in order to prevent the formation 
of mixed sodium - potassium salts. 


The lead sulphate was filtered off and the filt- 

















- 53 - 


rate was ooncentrated in vacuo to a small volume and 
set in a vacuum deslocator to dry. After several days 
the dry residue was extracted with absolute methanol, 
reconcentrated and dried again. 

In all, five - 2 litre lots of urine were treated 
in this way. Even after standing in a vaouum 
desiccator for periods as long as 2-3 weeks the 
yellow brown residues showed no sign of orystals but 
remained as a sticky mass. The material was stable, 
however, and showed no sign of darkening. One of the 
fractions did become hard and resinous like but not 
crystalline. The Knoop test also was stable - showed 
no sign of becoming weaker. 

The material was readily soluble in water and 
methanol forming a yellow brown solution, but not so 
soluble in ethanol. A sodium fusion showed the absence 
of sulphur, phosphorus and halogens but gave a positive 
test for nitrogen. 

The material decolorized bromine and alkaline 
potassium permanganate and also gave a reddish colour 
with ferric chloride. The diazo test was weak yellow 
colour. The material gave a positive Ninhydrin test. 
This was rather surprising but it could have been 
due to the presence of an impurity. The material gave 
a negative biuret, Millon’s, Tollen's (ammoniacal 








- 34 < 


silver nitrate), glyoxylio and phenylhydrazine tests, 

gUrther Notes on Procedure . 

Barium hydroxide and concentrated ammonia were 
used in some of the fractionations as the base for 
the precipitation of the basic lead fraotion but were 
found to be not as suitable as either sodium or 
potassium hydroxide. The precipitate was more granular 
in type but the filtrate still contained some colour. 

Hydrogen sulphide was used in several of the 
fractions to free the lead precipitate. The method 
was quite satisfactory if the hydrogen sulphide were 
removed as soon as possible and the solution made 
neutral to litmus with potassium hydroxide. 

Solvent Extraction Method 

Several solvent extractions of the basic lead 
aqueous concentrates were tried. 

Benzene, toluene, ether, acetone, ethyl methyl 
ketone and chloroform failed to extract anything from 
the aqueous solution. Both isoamyl and n-butyl alcohol 
extracted some of the material, the latter one being 
the better of the two. 

A procedure, similar to the Bogomolow (3) 
test for urobilin was tried. 
















- 35 - 


The aqueous solution was made slightly acid 
with glaoial aoetio aoid and a few drops of copper 
sulphate (5$) were added* The mixture was shaken with 
butyl alcohol and oentrifuged to aid in the separation 
of the phases. Two layers formed: 

(a) a green water layer 

(b) a pink - brown aloohol layer. 

The alcohol layer was drawn off and evaporated 
in vacuo as far as possible. The residue was taken 
up in a little water and the Knoop test done on it 
was positive. 

The water layer was taken to dryness and the 
residue taken up in a little water. Knoop test on 
this fraction was negative. 

It was thought that the copper formed a salt 
with the material which was soluble in butyl alcohol. 
An attempt was made to crystallize this copper salt 
but it was unsuccessful. 

Garrod*s method (9) of saturating the urine 
with ammonium sulphate and extracting the yellow 
pigment from the ammonium sulphate solution with 
absolute alcohol was modified. 

The basic lead fraction was saturated with 
anhydrous sodium sulphate. On adding absolute methanol 
an insoluble residue was thrown down and two layers 






















'

. 























- 36 - 


were formed: 

(a) water layer 

(b) alcohol layer containing the yellow colour 
and the Knoop giving substance. 

The alcohol layer was separated in a separatory 
funnel, drawn off, evaporated in vacuo to a small 
volume and then dried in a vacuum desiccator over 
night. The dried residue was extracted with absolute 
methanol. This alcohol extract gave a strong Knoop 
test. It was again evaporated to a small volume and 
left in the desiccator to crystallize. Even after 
a week the material remained sticky and there was 
no sign of crystals. 

Throughout all our experiments it was noticed 
that the intensity of the Knoop test was directly 
proportional to the intensity of colour of the test 
solution. This suggested that the Knoop giving sub¬ 
stance was a pigment in the urine. In many ways it 
resembles Weiss' (27),(28),(29),(30),(31),(32) 
urochromogen. 

Like urochromogen, it is found in the basic 
lead preoipitate, it has acid properties since it 
forms salts soluble in water and alcohol but insol¬ 
uble in ether, and it reduces permanganate. Also it 
gives negative Millon’s, glyoxylic acid tests. 











± 37 - 


Unlike uroohromogen, it gives a red oolour 
with ferrio chloride (Weiss says uroohromogen gives 
a green oolour) and it fails to reduoe ammoniac^! 
silver nitrate. The diazo test is weak. 

Other Knoop Giving Substances in Urine. 

In addition to histidine, indoxyl, and the 
substance in the basic lead precipitate we have evidenoe 
that there are at least three other Knoop giving 
substances in urine. 

The aoid lead fraction contains two such 
substances: 

(a) one whioh is precipitated by barium 
hydroxide 

(b) one whioh is left in the filtrate from 
the barium hydroxide precipitation. 

A third Knoop giving substance was found in 
the filtrate from the mercury fractionation of the 
Glyoxaline Fraction of the urine. 

These three have not been investigated as yet. 











- 38 - 


V SUMMARY 

1. A method for doing the Knoop test has been 
described, 

2. Histidine is not the only substance in urine 
giving a positive Knoop test but evidence points 
to at least five other substanoes. 

(a) Two in the acid lead fraction 

(b) One in the basio lead fraction 

(o) One in the filtrate from the mercury 

fraotionation of the Glyoxaline Fraction 
of the urine, 

(d) Indoxyl 

3. A resinous like concentrate of the substance 
in the basic lead fraction was obtained.
