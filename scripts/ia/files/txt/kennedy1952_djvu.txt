ABSTRACT 


THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF MUSIC IN 
CALGARY, 1$75r1920 by NORMAN J. KENNEDY 


This is a study of the musical growth of Calgary 
up to 1920* Musical activities of the pioneer are 
described. The early concert halls are located and 
early leadership under Mr. J.S. Denn s, Mrs. Annie Glen 
Broder, Mrs. W. Roland Winter and Mr. P.L. Ne T 'combe is 
recalled. Attention is given to such phases of musical 
development as choral music, church choirs, the symphony 
band music and musical education.

INTRODUCTION 


No attempt, has been made to record the history of Calgary's 
musical development. No one has inquired into the many aspects of 
musical activity in the city. Only general articles in special or 
souvenir editions of the local press have asummarized these phases 
of cultural gro?;th. 

Calgary's importance as a musical centre has been commented 
upon by visiting artists of world renown and by adjudicators and 
examiners from Great Britain, the United States and Eastern Canada. 
The former have been quick to sense the keen appreciation of the 
audiences before whom they performed, while the latter have had the 
responsibility of passing judgment upon the evidences of the city's 
musical progress and achievement. Conscientious and well-directed 
effort on the part of a large and vigorous section of its citizens 
went into the attainment of Calgary's musical reputation. 

The purposes of this study are therefore, fourfold. It will 
summarize the nature and characteristics of the growth of music in 
the pioneer West and in a frontier town. It will recall the contri¬ 
butions of those citizens who participated in the musical development 
of the city.' It will record the various phases of musical activity 
attempted in Calgary and ex-amine the progress of musical education. 

The scope of this study has been limited to the period extending 
from the founding of Calgary in 1875 until 1920® The latter date has 
been selected for several reasons. 

It was in 1918 that the first Provincial Musical Festival was 
held in Calgary. Previous to this such festivals had been held in 
Edmonton with an occasional one in Lethbridge. In that year, Calgary 
was included in a three-year cycle along with the other two cities.

II 


The competitive festival movement gave a changed direction to 
musical activities. 

By 1920, standards in musical performance had been definitely 
established and the British tradition in this regard had triumphed. 
This was indicated in the practice of inviting British adjudicators 
to the annual provincial festivals. The British tradition was further 
strengthened by the number of students taking the examinations of the 
Royal Schools of Music, London, and by scholarships making possible 
advanced study at that centre. 

By that date the responsibility for music in Calgary was passing 
from the amateur, who regarded his musical activities as an avocation 
and a civic duty, to the professional, who regarded his musical act¬ 
ivities as his chosen vocation and means of livelihood. 

The expansion of the city with the concurrent complexity of city 
life after World War I, made musical efforts no longer the community¬ 
wide enterprises they had been in the decades that had gone before. 

A multiplicity of interests were claiming attention and group efforts 
were becoming increasingly difficult. 

The radio was introduced into the local community after 1920. 

This development brought music in all its phases into the homes. 
Programmes from the larger centres of population and under profess¬ 
ional auspices had a discrediting and discouraging effect upon local 
efforts of a similar nature.

CHAPTER I 


MUSIC IN THE PIONEER ERA . 

(Before 1900) 

The development of the fine arts in any community, large or small, 
at any period of its history, depends upon the prerequisite satisfaction 
of man*s basic needs* With adequate food, clothing and shelter assured, 
native and pioneer peoples, even though leisure may be at a premium, 
will ultimately express themselves in music, dancing, art and literature, 
and in so doing lay a foundation for the cultural progress of the region 
in which they have established themselves# Such is the story of the 
cultural development of Western Canada and of Calgary* 

The Bow Valley, particularly the spot where the Elbow merges with 
it, had always proved attractive to the Blaekfoot, Sareee, Stoney and, 
at times, even the Cree, Indians# The elastic wood of the young firs 
growing there provided material for their bowmaking. The high river 
banks and the thick evergreens gave protection from the winter winds* 

The swift-flowing waters of the Bow and the Elbow rarely entirely 
covered with ice, attracted herds of buffalo wintering in the north* 

Among the native inhabitants, assembling in considerable numbers 
because of these surroundings favourable for the basic essentials of 
life, musical effort was restricted to the use of percussion instru¬ 
ments as an accompaniment to the equally monotonous chants of their 
initiation ceremonies and tribal dances* By chant and tom-tom, the 
Indians inspired courage among their warriors and hunters, cured the 
mysterious ills of their infirm or called forth general jubilation from 
the tribesmen. The drum as a healer or as an entertainer was the greatly* 
prized prerogative of the medicine man who, with the greatest goodwill, 
would perform for hours at a stretch. Mrs. John McDougall testified ts 
its employment in a serenade. A combined conjuror and medicine man

cheerfully performed upon it for hours aa a polite attention to her in 
front of her mission door* 

To these native encampments came trader and missionary* Each con¬ 
tributed in a small measure to musical growth on the frontier* Mr. G* 0. 
King, a former mayor of Calgary and one-time postmaster, admitted having 

heard in the early days, the violin playing of the French half-breed 

( 2 ) 

traders. In 1875* the McDougalls - David the trader and John the 
missionary - came to the Bow Valley* They introduced the first portable 
organ or melodeon to the mission services and taught the Indians numer¬ 
ous hymns of the Church* Mrs. John McDougall recalled the Indian pre¬ 
ference for the tunes of “Nearer My God To Thee“ and “All Hail The Power 
Of Jesus* Name” (Diadem/ tunes exacting much vocal effort even from 
our modem congregations. 

The establishment of the police post of Fort Calgary at the junc¬ 
tion of the Bow and the Elbow Rivers in the fall of 1875, and the imme¬ 
diate growth of a community around' it, no doubt gave occasion for 
musical activities. The extent and nature of these must be left to 
conjecture as no written record is available. 

Between 1875 and 1885 Calgary was extremely isolated. Its position 
in the Bow Valley was not commercially strategic* The routes of contact 
with the East were by way of Edmonton and the North Saskatchewan, or by 
Macleod, Fort Benton and the Missouri. So insignificant did Calgary 8 s 
future seem that police authorities, after successfully stamping out 
the whisky trade in the valley, gave serious consideration to abandoning

the post. It was the southward shifting of the route of the Canadian 
Pacific Railway from the Yellowhead Pass to the Bow Valley that gave 
impetus to the development of the isolated post* Calgary was thus 
linked by rail with Eastern Canada and the Pacific Coast* 

Its newly significant position effected cultural changes in Calgary, 
the most important being the publication of a local newspaper,, On 
August 51# 1885# the first edition of "The Calgary Weekly Herald and 
Mine and Ranching Review 11 came off the press* This weekly later, on 
July 2, 1885, became a daily. Using this as a source, rather than con¬ 
jecture, the musical development of Calgary can be more reliably outlined. 

The coining of the railway and the subsequent growth of the city 
made music of value as a medium of social intercourse. No gathering was 
complete without a sing-song, or some instrumental contributions *- mouth 
organ, parlor organ, piano, fiddle or flute - that added to the joy of 
life. Such proceedings were usually expected to end in a dance*^ 

Most people were indisposed to venture upon what is elegantly described 
as "high brow” music. 

The reports of musical events appearing in the weekly and daily 
press will illustrate certain significant characteristics of musical 
development during this pioneer period. 

In the weekly issue of the Herald dated January 2, 1884, under 
the caption "Concert” the following appears! 

"A concert was held on Christmas Eve in the new depot, 

27th Siding, which was a great success and creditable to 
all that took part. The programme consisted of instrumental 
music, dialogues, songs, both comic and sentimental, two 
hours being pleasantly spent by those present. •••• A dance 

was given after the concert was over ....... The proceeds

amounted to $74, which were contributed to 
charitable purposes*" 

Again under the heading "Dramatics", the Herald of March 12, 1884 
reports: 

"On Monday evening last, the Calgary Amateur Dramatic 
Club presented to the public the laughable farce entitled 
"Chopsticks and Spickens"* The characters were all well 
sustained* Mr. Mortimer sang a song "Peer Relations"^ 
and was deservedly encored* Mr. Couzener*s comic songs 
were highly appreciated and that gentleman was encored again 
and again* ••*«• The house was full and the audience went 
away highly satisfied. The performance was repeated last 
night with equal success." 

In the issue dated March 19, 1884, under the title "Musical" an 
interesting item appears. 

"We were regaled the other dey *ith an exhibition of 
Mrs. Millward^ skill on the pianoforte and were highly 
delighted. Mr. Millward we believe, is possessed of no 
mean skill as a violinist. We are quite sure that they 
will be a great acquisition to the town." 

From the above excerpts it is readily recognized that the local 
press was not indulging to the slightest degree in musical criticism* 
Rather it turned "the blind eye" to obvious faults and weaknesses, and 
adopted a tone of commendation and encouragement. The judgment it 
passed was based upon audience enjoyment. No attempt was made to esta** 
blish standards of selection, repertoire, performance or technique. 

The community demanded "popular" entertainment, and not the development 
of musical taste.

So it would seem that the aim of such events in the pioneer settle¬ 
ment was solely enjoyment. To guarantee against the concert programn© 
being inadequate, the evening was concluded with a dance. This emphasis 
upon the entertaining feature of such events is also evident in the type 
of numbers listed upon the programme and in their heterogeneity - "in¬ 
strumental music, dialogues, comic and sentimental songs, the farce" - 
the "scrapings" from what the pioneer community could offer. "The 
contribution of Old Country folk coming to the west as ranchers and 
farmers was almost negligible as regards music, their tastes being more 
sporting than aesthetic, and even practical settlers from Ontario and 
the Maritimes, who toiled hard all day, not unnaturally looked forward 
to some sort of light recreation, theatricals or popular miscellaneous 
programmes, ending in a dance, being their favorite fare." ^^ 

It is interesting and significant to note that the proceeds from 
such affairs were devoted to charitable purposes. This was a common 
inspiration or culmination of such enterprises even long after the 
pioneer stage had been passed* An article reminiscent of these early 
efforts in Calgary remarks upon this feature of community life. 

"The raison d 3 etre of its (the light opera ‘Dorothy 1 ) 
performance was either a hospital needing special equip¬ 
ment or a church or some society craving funds wherewith 
to purchase something. In those far off days the require¬ 
ments of others always provided a good and sufficient 
excuse for ‘putting on something 3 either a play or a 

(2) 

musical comedy which had won popularity elsewhere." 

However, no thought seems to have been given to using such proceeds 
for the promotion of the cause of music in the communityJ

The third item quoted above indicates, on the part of press and 
public, an alertness to and an awareness of potential musical talent 
arriving with each immigrant train during the 1890*s and early 1900*s. 

During this period in Calgary*s musical development there is 
evidence of the beginnings of church music sufficient to merit atten¬ 
tion in the local press. The Saturday edition of December 21, 1889, 
announces the music of the midnight mass to be sung in the new Catholic 

Church by the choir "under the leadership of Mrs. Feehan and Dr. 

n (l) 

Rouleau, Mr. Curley being the organist”. v ' 

A later edition comments upon the Christmas Services in the Pres¬ 
byterian Church by stating that "the choir*s singing of the anthems 
and the music generally was admired", and in the Church of the Redeemer 

that "the service was bright and hearty, the hymn singing being espec- 

( 2 ) 

ially good and the church looked well in Christmas garb."' ' 

From time to time there appear notices of miscellaneous concerts 
held in the town which illustrate trends in musical development during 

this pioneer stage. On September 16, 1890, a concert featuring drama¬ 

tic readings by a Miss Knox was well received by a large audience in 
the Calgary Opera House, which stood just east of the present Post 
Office site. The proceeds were for the Medicine Hat Hospital. Music¬ 
al talent for the programme came from Medicine Hat and Canmore.^^ 

A sacred concert under the auspices of Knox Presbyterian Church 
was held on October 18, 1890. The programme as it appeared in the 
press ^ indicated the non-sectarian, co-operative spirit of pioneer 
days. Listed as one of the vocal soloists was the Reverend J. J. 

Leach. This gentleman was the Methodist minister at that time.

Later on the programme, several organ numbers were given by Mr, H. J. 
Curley, who was the organist in the new Catholic Church. Also appearing 
as a vocal soloist was Mr. E. R. Rogers, the town fire chief. 

It wa9 during the 1890's that Calgary witnessed amateur productions 
of light operas currently popular in larger centres. The first of these 
was presented in 1890 in the old Opera House under the direction of 
Mr. H. J. Curley. Along with two farces, he produced Gilbert and 
Sullivan's "Trial by Jury". ^ ^ Among the cast was Mr. P. J. Nolan, 
Calgary's famed criminal lawyer. 

During the decade, interest in light opera gained impetus with the 
arrival in 1895 of Judge Roland Winter and his talented wife. The 
former was a 'cellist with orchestral experience, while the latter had 
had experience upon the English stage. Around this talented and dis¬ 
tinguished family gathered a group of notable citizens who did much to 
further light opera in the West. Their annual presentations included 

such current favorites as "The Pirates of Penzance", "lolanthe","H.M.S. 

( 2 ) 

Pinafore" and "The Geisha". v 7 Among those participating in these per¬ 
formances are found the names of prominent citizens, for example, 

Crispin Smith, conductor, then the police magistrate! J. J. Young, 
organist, then editor and part owner of "The Calgary Daily Herald"! 

Judge Winter, 'cellist, then a district court judge! M. C. (Charlie) 
Bernard, stage manager, a partner in a legal firm! and Mr. and Mrs. P.J. 
Nolan and Mrs. Winter who played principal roles/"" This group founded 
the Calgary Operatic Society, a society which remained active until 1921. 

The pioneer settlement had seldom been without a band. As early ©s 
June 14, 1885, Calgary's first mayor, George Murdock, recorded in his

diary that "the instruments arrived for the band". Band music, besides 
being encouraged by the civic authorities, was also fostered by the Odd¬ 
fellows# However, in 1890 they sold their instruments, uniforms and 
music to W. D. Marsh who in turn, presented the equipment to the Calgary 
Fire Department for a band. This musical organization attained a high 
state of efficiency, played on all civic occasions and turned out to 
welcome distinguished visitors. The citizens were proud of it, regard¬ 
ing it as a great credit to the city in general. 

It was during the 1890*s that there grew up in Calgary a native 
daughter who was to bring fame to herself and to her birthplace. In 
1891, Kathleen Parlow was born in Calgary. Her mother was active as a 
violinist in the town’s musical life. Although mother and daughter left 
the pioneer town five and a half years later, and Kathleen received all 
her musical education in cities other than Calgary, Calgary has laid 
claim to this world-renowned violinist. 

It would seem that musical development in Calgary during this 
pioneer stage was the result of individual rather than collective 
effort. With the exception of the town bands, local church choirs and 
the Calgary Operatic Society, the progress of music depended upon the 
abilities and resourcefulness of the individual artist. No attempt 
was made to organize the vocalists into an aggressive choral society 
or the instrumentalists into a permanent orchestra that would assure 
growth and development along these lines of musical expression. 

Thus during this pioneer era, from the beginnings of settlement 

to the turn of the century, with the adequate provision within the 

area for man’s essential needs and with the assurance of the economic 

survival end development of the settlement into a town and later a city, 

the rugged inhabitants turned from their toil to give expression to

themselves and to the joy of living through the channel of music* The 
musical progress during the era no doubt was restricted and thin in 
its scope, 1 and open to criticism in the light of modern standards* 

None the less a cultural foundation was laid, based upon the innate 
desires of the people of the community, to improve their environment 
and make life more pleasant through this medium of self-expression.

CHAPTER II 


THE PIONEER SPIRIT IN RELATION TO ART . 

A recent editorial contained the following statement in reference 
to the relative importance of material and cultural prosperity as an 
indication of the progress achieved by an area of settlement. 

11 A community*s greatness is judged not by its size, 
the glory of its buildings or the number of cars on its 
streets, but by its concern for what is loosely called 
culture.” ^ 

The concern for culture during the early period of Calgary*s mus¬ 
ical development, as considered in the preceding chapter, was extremely 
low* This indifference is common to pioneer areas end may be attributed 
to at least three significant things? the influence of the pioneer 
spirit, the want of adequate leisure for artistic pursuits and the lack 
of qualified leadership sufficiently removed from the strain, stress 
and influence of the frontier existence. For a people, keen of brain 
and quick of thought, as the pioneers were, may starve artistic 
instincts until, atrophied, these fail of any purpose or use. 

The pioneer spirit has been eulogized in epic, song and story. 

The indomitable will which surmounted obstacles has been the them© of 
realist and romanticist. The fortitude of that rugged individual who 
risked life and limb to open the frontier lands and to prove such areas 
to be economically able to sustain settlement, has won the admiration 
of the succeeding generations that have reaped the benefits of his 
dauntless efforts.

specifically entitled “Need in the Way of Art” signed ,S A.B.“ under 
a general heading “Needs of the West from Various Standpoints 51 , in 
a special edition of the Calgary Daily Herald, January 28, 1905, 
which had been compiled by representative women of the city.

This spirit was compounded of many elements. At its core were 
faith and self-confidence. Ingenuity end adaptability went into its 
composition. If one way failed, if the first method attempted proved 
unsuccessful, other means and techniques were tried* The process did 
not matter; ”any old way” as long as the obstacle was overcome. Fertil¬ 
ity of invention meant much in solving pioneer difficulties® Their sol¬ 
ution by methods and with materials not usually associated with such 
problems, led the pioneer to break with the traditions and the standards 
of the land from which he had come. 

This gave rise to independence and self-satisfaction. After the 
fierce struggle against the forces of nature in meeting his basic needs, 
after success crowned his efforts at the expense of physical exertion 
and mental ingenuity, a feeling of complacency in accomplishment exuded 
from the hardy pioneer. Commendable as such a spirit is in the attain¬ 
ment of material prosperity, it has a retarding influence upon progress 
in the cultural field. 

The almost complete absence of an “art-spirit" in pioneer areas is 
actually the result of the settlers 1 cleverness in doing things ”eny old 
way 1 *. The resourcefulness and the independence found so admirable in 
the frontier character are fatal to chances of finished workmanship. 
Fertility of invention, unless directed toward perfection, is ephemeral 
and futile, like the skill of the n jack-of-all trades” or of the typical 
female ”who can mend almost anything you can mention with a hairpin”. 
This may be ingenuity but it certainly is not art. 

When the instinct of an artist, - artist in its broad connotation - 
leaps to life in the worker, be he amateur or professional, nothing but 
the best possible use of his materials and his talents becomes support¬ 
able to him. He is not content merely with what nature has given. He 
turns and polishes, tries this way and that, until he attains toward

the utmost perfection in his special medium of self-expression, be it 
music, drama, art or literature* 

It may be concluded that the indomitable will of the pioneer, rest¬ 
less and eager to achieve, if not by one route, then by another, is a 
hindrance to the development of the best in culture. The need of the 
time was concentration of purpose and concerted effort to attain results 
in art commensurate with those made in the material field. The tendency 
to break with tradition in surmounting obstacles and in solving problems, 
when applied to the cultural field, implied an overthrow and a disregard 
of those standards in art which had been accepted in the lends from 
which the settlers had come. 

The apathy of the pioneer toward things cultural during this era 
may have been due also to the lack of leisure to perfect and to enjoy 
the fruits of the arts. Time was fully occupied in seeking the physi¬ 
cal necessities of life and in adding to man’s material gains. Patience 
was consumed in the labor of the daily task and little energy remained 
for those artistic pursuits demanding sustained, concentrated effort. 
Recreation was available through the arts, but it was 11 anything will 
do M or "do the best you can.” 

The spirit and the enthusiasm were there waiting to b© aroused. 

What was required was direction for concentration of purpose and for 
concerted action! leadership to establish standards and models of 
achievement. Such direction and leadership had made its influence 
felt in the field of light opera during the last decade of the century* 
The Winter family, arriving when interest in this phase of musical 
endeavor was running high, gave artistic tone in repertoire, selection, 
performance and technique — Judge Winter in the field of orchestral 
accompaniment, but more particularly Mrs. Winter in stage management 
and in general artistic atmosphere. She was able to rally the local 



7“ir 

















-15 


forces and give them direction toward concerted action. 

It was during the early years of the new century that further 
leadership came to Calgary to give guidance in the organization of 
choral groups and church choirs. 

In 1902, Col. J. S. Dennis arrived in Calgary. He was by profession 
an engineer in charge of the irrigation department of the Canadian Pacific 
Railway, by avocation a musician with keen enthusiasm and interest in 
the field of choral music. He had taken an active part in things musical 
in his former place of residence, Regina. There he had collaborated in 
choral enterprises and light opera with a lady of musical education and 
distinction, Mrs. Annie Glen Broder# He had been quick to recognize 
musicianship of a high order in Mrs# Broder, and upon his advice and in¬ 
vitation, she came to Calgary Ho take hold of the musical situation” 

In the summer of 1904, Mr. P. L# Newcombe also cam© to Calgary# He 
was an experienced baritone soloist and had been influenced in choral 
music by Dr. A# 3# Vogt and his Mendelssohn Choir of Toronto# His inter¬ 
est in the West had been aroused by the Rev. John McDougall during his 
lecture tours of Eastern Canada. Mr. Newcombe first stopped in Brandon 
and later, in August, came to Calgary where he was to give exceptional 
leadership in choral music for many years to come. 

The following year, Mr# Frank H# Wrigley came as organist and choir 
leader to Knox Presbyterian Church. He was a graduate of the Royal 
Schools, London, England, and a pupil of the famed English organist, 

Edwin Lemare# Mr. Wrigley established high standards in church music 
and in his organ recitals. 

(l) Quoted from a letter in ny possession from T# A# Powell, Edmonton, 
former Court Reporter, who was associated musically with Col. 

Dennis and Mrs. Broder in Regina at the time. The statement in 
the letter reads: “Mrs. Broder told us that Mr. Dennis had written 
asking her if she would come to Calgary to Hake hold of the 
musical situation 11 1 1

Thus was provided the trained leadership to give direction to, and 
to set standards for Calgary^s musical d evelopment. The efforts of 
these four musicians, along with others, are dealt with in subsequent

CHAPTER III. 


CALGARY 1 3 EARLY CONCERT HALLS . 

A perennial problem that has faced Calgary from comparatively 
early times until the present, has been the providing of adequate 
accommodation for large assemblies of her citizens* The physical limit¬ 
ations of her concert halls, aggravated upon certain occasions by in¬ 
creased interest in particular events, or by edicts of the city council 
in the interests of safety, have been the common plaint of impresario 
and editorial writer. Whenever plans were being drawn up for the erec¬ 
tion of a public building, or a master scheme for town planning was 
under consideration, then as now, various parties agitated for a civic 
auditorium that would include those features that would serve their 
special interests and in the multiplicity of their demands delayed the 
permanent solution of the city’s problem. 

Regardless of terminology, whether it be hall, opera house, theatre 
or rink, these places in the early years of the community gathered 
around them an atmosphere of romance, and to the pioneer the dimly- 
lighted, poorly-ventilated, ill-equipped halls glow warmly end brill¬ 
iantly in reminiscence* The indirectly-lighted, air-conditioned, 
electrically-equipped auditoriums of today will never hold the same 
appeal and romance as those places of the past. They were the centres 
of the intimate social contacts that those of the present, with all 
their modern facilities, do not foster. Boynton Hall, Hull f s Opera 
House, the Lyric Theatre and the Sherman Rink meant much to early 
Calgarians, much more than a civic centre will mean to future genera¬ 
tions, if one is ever provided in the interests of civic culture. 

The first of these places of public assembly was Boynton Hall, a 
wooden structure located on Eighth Avenue East across from the present 
Queen’s Hotel. Here public entertainment in its varied forms attracted

the townspeople. Secular and church groups made use of its facilities 
for balls, concerts, lectures and services. Here in 1884, the Anglican 
community organized the Cathedral Church of the Redeemer and for eight 
months held services until their first building was completed. The 
Herald of December 18, 1886 contains this item, ©live with musical 
interest and pungent admonitions 

"The Boynton Hall was filled to its capacity on the 
occasion of the Presbyterian Church Concert last night, 
a large number of redcoats turning up to do honor to the 
occasion which marked the debut of the Hbrth West Mounted 
Police Orchestra before a Calgary public. The orchestra 
struck up the overture with refreshing military punctual¬ 
ity precisely at 8 p«m., but it proved a false start so 
to speak, as it was followed by a long wait of some 
twenty minutes before the choir, to whom the next events 
were entrusted, could be brought up to start. There is 
an admirable virtue in which the humblest amateur can 
emulate and even outshine the professional, it is that 
of punctuality end we strongly recommend Calgary amateurs 
to cultivate it." 

Later, Boynton Hall was taken over by the Salvation Army and used 
as their citadel. In the early 1890 J s it was completely destroyed by 
fire. 

By this time the Calgary Opera House had been erected on Eighth 
Avenue East on the site of the present post office. This was used as 
a concert hall and roller skating rink under the management of a Mr. 
Fraser. It was in this hall, in time referred to as "The Old Opera 
House" that such activities as the dramatic readings of Miss Knox and 
the light operas of Mr. H. J. Curley, already referred to, were held.

With the erection of places of greater and more suitable accommodation, 
the Opera House was used exclusively for roller skating, until with the 
expansion of business construction westward along Stephen Avenue (Eighth 
Avenue), it was torn down to meet the needs of a more pressing commerc- 
ial enterprise. 

In 1895, Hull^s Opera House was built to serve the needs of the 
growing community. The building, now called the Albion Block, still 
stands on the south-east corner of Sixth Avenue and Centre Street, 
immediately north of the York Hotel. Its purpose was to accommodate 
commercial entertainment by the stock companies and individual artists 
who were passing through Calgary with increasing frequency. Its doors, 
however, were opened for local efforts. Her© the firemen held their 
annual New Year’s Ball, the gala event of the season, and loyal Irish¬ 
men celebrated March 17 with a dance. 

For several months prior to the completion of their present build¬ 
ing in 1904, the congregation of Central Methodist Church, now Central 
United Church, held services in Hull*a. The late Dr. George W. Kerby, 
their popular pastor of those years, attracted numbers that taxed the 
seating capacity of the house. Rough planks, strung between chairs, 
provided the additional seats for the worshippers, many of whom left 
the services with aching backs only to return for more the following 
Sunday. 

This was the scene also of the early activities of the Calgary 
Operatic Society under the leadership of Mrs. Roland Winter, with 
Charlie Bernard as stage manager taking full advantage of the facil¬ 
ities that the new opera house afforded. 

Later, under Mr. W. B. Sherman, the opera house was remodelled 
into a ”modem M theatre to meet the demands of the travelling stock 
companies and such companies as Sherman himself organized. On

January 27, 1905, it was re-cpened as Sherman*s Opera House. ‘'Bill” 
Sherman was a typical showman, replete with tremendous diamond stick¬ 
pin and finger ring. Both were as large as searchlights.^ 

On December 15, 1904 the Calgary Auditorium Rink was opened. This 
structure was built by George Irish on the north-west corner of Centre 
Street and Seventeenth Avenue West as Calgary*s first indoor ‘‘ice 
palace”. It was reported to be at that time the most complete struc¬ 
ture of its kind in the West. In 190? it was purchased by W. B. Sher¬ 
man, whose idea was to operate it for summer stock shows. The Calgary 
Auditorium Rink became better known as the Sherman Rink. 

In 1909, Mr* Lloyd Turner, the present manager of Calgary*e new 
Stampede Corral, came to the city as the Rink*s manager. For several 
years it was used for roller skating both in winter and in summer. 
Ultimately, during the winter it became a hockey arena. 

The rink provided accommodation for twenty-two hundred people, 
and this could be increased to over four thousand by seating the ice 
area. A large stage was provided at the western end. Stars of the 
theatrical, sport and entertainment world performed here. Dame Nellie 
Melba, the world-famous Australian soprano, sang to a record crowd 
during her Canadian tour of 1912. Other operatic stars of that day, 
such as Jessie McLaughlin and Alice Neilson sang to Calgary audiences 
from this platform. 

The large seating capacity and the ample stage made the Sherman 

Rink most suitable for choral presentations. Thus, in 1911, the famous 

Sheffield Choir conducted by Dr. Henry Coward, making a world tour 

under Dr. Charles Harries* Festival of Empire, presented two concerts 

in this building to large audiences. The major local group using these 

facilities was the Apollo Choir, under the direction of Mr. P. L. 

(l) Leishman McNeil! '’Tales of the Old Town”, Calgary Daily Herald, 

June 6, 1950*

Newcomb©. On two occasions, first in 1911 and again in 1912, this 
organization presented the St. Paul Symphony Orchestra in programmes 
of choral and orchestral music. But in spite of the large seating 
capacity and good houses resulting from a vigorous ticket-selling cam¬ 
paign by choir members, the local organization sustained considerable 
financial loss on both occasions. 

In the late spring of 1915, the Sherman Rink was destroyed by 
fire. By this time the Calgary Exhibition Board had built the Arena, 
hence the rink was not rebuilt. Its site today is used as a children*s 
playground maintained by the Parke Department. 

During the first decade of the century a number of theatres were 
built in the city. The earlier ones were devoted to presentations of 
stock companies and vaudeville troupes. With the arrival of motion 
pictures, other theatres were built and the older ones gradually 
adopted the newer form of entertainment. 

Of these theatres, two seemed to welcome, on occasions, presenta¬ 
tions by local artists and local organizations. Both were built by 
Sir James Lougheed and leased to men imbued with a sense of their civic 
responsibility in encouraging the cultural development of the city of 
their adoption. 

The first of these was the Lyric Theatre rjjlch is now the Arcade on 
Eighth Avenue West. It was managed by Ernest Willis, a former actor 
himself, who later established an enterprising sign-board business in 
the city. In May 1907, Mrs. Annie Glen Broder presented to a large 
audience in this theatre, what she described as U A Springtime Matinee 
Musicals”. The Lyric was used by the Apollo Choir in their annual 
concert of February 15, 1909* On this occasion the programme consisted 
of Handel*s "Messiah” and miscellaneous choral numbers. 

The management also opened the theatre during the winter months

for local band concerts on Sunday evenings# "These concerts, or one- 

hour musicals, were a success in every way and furnished entertainment 

of an educational nature to thousands of music-loving people." ^^ 

The second of these theatres was the Grand, opened in February 

1915, to Forbes Robertson and his English company playing "The Passing 

of the Third Floor Back"* At that time, this new theatre possessed a 

stage equalled only by five others in the Dominion for size and modern 

equipment. It was commonly referred to as the Sherman Grand Theatre 

because W. B# Sherman was its original leaseholder* 

Many famous personages of the dramatic and operatic worlds have 

"trodden its boards". These have included Margaret Anglin, May Robson, 

Sir John Martin Harvey, Robert B* Mantell, Mathison Lang, Bransby 

Williams, and Maurice Colbourne* Visiting opera companies have also 

been accorded a hearty welcome, among which have been the San Carlo, 

the San Francisco and the D*0yly Carte, each bringing at various 

times something to keep alive the music of the stage. 

Interest in opera must have been high in Calgary judging from a 

scheme announced by the Calgary News Telegram early in 1911# Under 

headings of "Calgary Will Become Known as a Theatrical Producing Centre 

Soon", "W. B* Sherman and Frank W. Healy are to Launch the New San 

Francisco Opera Company", "Mr. Sherman Agrees to Finance Company, 

Initial Expenditure Being $15,000", there follows a statement by Mr. 

Healy, "It means that Calgaiy will have a Calgary-owned opera company, 

for I am making my residence here as soon as I can close up my present 

business (in New York), while Mr. Sherman has never been anything else 

( 2 ) 

but a Calgarian for years." The scheme was that the company would 

be owned and operated from Calgary, and all the engagements for the

company would be booked from the city. An ambitious undertaking in a 
city of 45,000^ ^and in a land of relatively small centres! Like many 
schemes of those days it did not materialize, although for a tine 
Sherman and Healy leased several of Calgary’s theatres. 

The management of the Grand encouraged its use for recitals by 
world famous musical artists such as Dame Clara Butt, John McCormack, 
Reinald Werrenrath and Fritz Kreisler. The theatre’s capacity of 
fifteen hundred was taxed on the appearance of outstanding individuals 
and touring companies. 

Local productions had access to this theatre. Within its walls, 

choral and orchestral music was heard. During its seventh season, 1915“ 

1914, the Apollo Choir presented concerts in conjunction with the newly 

organized Calgary Symphony Orchestra in the Sherman Grand. The latter 

organization had been enthusiastically sponsored and supported by music 

lovers in the city. It was credited with being the most outstanding 

( 2 ) 

orchestral organization west of Toronto. During this same season it 
presented six formal evening concerts besides several young people’s 
matinees to which children were admitted at reduced prices and for which 
they received special dispensation in the matter of school attendance* 
The Calgary Operatic Society, taking advantage of the improved 
stage facilities provided by the newer and larger theatres, presented 
their annual productions in the Lyric Theatre and later in the Sherman 
Grand. 

Another hall to figure prominently in housing concerts and drama¬ 
tic efforts by local groups and visiting artists was St. Mary’s Hall. 
This was a club room, officially opened on October 10, 1905 by a group 
of the Roman Catholic community as a home for the St. Mary’s Club, a

men's organization* In later years this club became the Knights of 
Columbus# The hall, though small, was used for recital purposes and 
even for concerts by such groups as the Apollo Choir. In the former 
instance, a report of a recital held in it on October 6, 1909, gives 
insight not only into the accommodation, but also into the habits of 
concert goers of that day. 

“Signor Piero Gherardi's vocal recital in St. Mary's 

Hall 1ast evening was a success from all points of view. 

\ 

The pleasant little auditorium contained about five hun¬ 
dred people, among fchom could be noticed most of those 
who are known in musical circles in this city. The assem¬ 
blage was to a good extent what is known as a “dress" 
audience and the aegis of society appeared to have been 
thrown over the occasion."^' 

Today St. Mary's Hall is the Calgary depot of the Canadian National 
Railway and still occupies its original site. 

No consideration of Calgary's concert halls would be complete with¬ 
out reference to two other auditoriums, namely the A1 Azhar Temple and 
Paget Hall# 

The Shriners' Temple, often referred to as the A1 Azhar, was built 
by the Temple Company in 1910. This company consisted of the executive 
and leading members of the Shrine who purchased share© for the construc¬ 
tion of the building. Among these were prominent Calgary citizens, « 

R. A. Darker, the Illustrious Potentate for that year; Harry Minchin, 
former city treasurer; Col. James Walker; J. H. Stanley, president of 
the Stanley Paper Company; T. F. English, customs collector, and Col. 
Armstrong. The Temple was rented at a high fee to other organizations 
end during its early years of operation proved a financial success.

But the effect of World War I weakened the company financially and in 
1919 the Shrine bought out the shares of the original members of the 
company* 

During its early heyday, the A1 Azhar Temple was the "Mecca" of 
recitals and concerts of a local and profession^ nature* It had a seat¬ 
ing capacity of eight hundred* The Apollo Choir used it for its semi¬ 
annual concert in November 1910. Such crowds must have attended that 
when the Choir applied for its use in 1915* the civic authorities inter¬ 
vened and decreed that in the interests of safety such large gatherings 
could not be held in the AX Azhar Temple. This led to considerable agi¬ 
tation and editorial advocacy of a civic auditorium. For a time the 
edict of the Council threatened the very life of the Apollo Choir and 
the daily press referred to such an eventuality as "the loss of an 
asset". 

It was in the Shrinere 1 Tempi© that Kathleen Par low, Calgary* s 
native violin virtuoso, gave two recitals early in 1911* Such enthus¬ 
iasm was aroused in certain quarters by these recitals that © suggestion 
of establishing a Kathleen Parlow Conservatory of Art became temporarily 
current, as indicated in the following editorials 

"What is your idea of the News Telegram*s suggestion 
regarding a Kathleen Parlow Conservatory of Art? Kathleen 
Parlow is the greatest artist Oalgsry can claim. And for 
a city of the size of Calgary to b© able to lay claim to an 
artist of her splendid rank does it © vast ©mount of credit* 

Would not this recognition of her splendid genius forever 
constitute a source of inspiration for the Calgary youth? 

"A Parlow concert for this purpose would yield many 
thousands* The city has vacant land which may, with

credit and profit, be devoted to the purpose* 

’’All the matter requires is public approval. 

Please let the News Telegram have your opinion. 

Such flashes of enthusiasm were only momentary. The conservatory 
did not materialize. 

Paget Hall was built in 1910 beside the Cathedral Church of the 
Redeemer on the site of an earlier Sunday School hall which in its day 
had served for concert and rehearsal purposes. The new building was 
simply to be called the Parish Hall, but at the time it was considered 
fitting to honor the then dean of the Cathedral, the Very Reverend E. C. 
Paget, who served the diocese in that capacity for twenty-five years. 

Even with a limited seating capacity of five hundred, it was used 
by many organizations. Over the years we find such groups as the Paget 
Players under Mr. C* Max Bishop giving dramatic presentations. The 
Paget Hall Entertainment Committee planned a series of outstanding pro¬ 
grammes, a concert by the International Operatic Company on November 29, 
1911, being the first. Prior to and during World War I, the Calgary 
Choral Society under the leadership of Mr. Horace Reynolds rehearsed 
and presented concerts in Paget Hall. At about the same time, Mr. 

James Smart, an enthusiastic Scottish choir master, used the same facil¬ 
ities for his Scottish Choral Society and later for hie Tonic Sol-Fah 
Choir. 

During 1912, the Calgary Concert Bureau functioned in the city. 
Three local citizens with musical interests, Mr. Frank Wrigley, Mr. 

R. J* Lydiatt and Mr. J. E. Williams, assumed the responsibility of 
booking outstanding artists for appearances in concert series. They 
made use of Paget Hall and of the A1 Azhar Temple. During the early 
months of 1912, they presented Mr. David Bispham, famous English

baritone, the Royal Welsh Moelwyn Male Voice Choir and Kathleen Parlow 
in recitals, the first two in Paget Hall, the last one in the Temple* 

In the fall of the same year they arranged a series of operatic recitals 
by outstanding stars to be held in the Shriners* Hall# These were 
Madame Schumann-Heink, contralto, Riccardo Martin, tenor, and Alice 
Neilson, soprano* The heavy expense involved in bringing such artists, 
and the lack of public support behind the enterprise, resulted in fin¬ 
ancial loss for the bureau, and in spite of plans for further concerts, 
the three gentlemen suspended operations, much to Calgary’s cultural 
loss. 

Churches, then as now, were used for concert purposes. The three 
most frequently used were ©entral Methodist, First Baptist, on the 
present site of the Greyhound Building, and Knox Presbyterian, where 
the York Hotel now stands. Even these were too small for ©vents of 
special interest and significance* Such was the case when Madame 
Lillian Nordica sang in the first named church on November $ 0 , 1911# 
Earlier than this on May 15, 1908, Knox Presbyterian had proved inade¬ 
quate for the crowds interested in the Festival of Cathedral Music 
conducted by Sir Fredrick Bridge, then organist of Westminster Abbey* 
This prompted editorial comment which savors much of what we read 
today under very similar headings, "Calgary Needs an Auditorium 15 . 

"The large attendance at the Bridge Musical Festival, 
which taxed the accommodation of Knox Church to the utmost 
and which could have been increased had there been more 
room, directs attention to the need for an auditorium hall 
in Calgary* This city is beginning to be known as the 
centre of culture in Western Canada, a reputation than 
which there is none more profitable and pleasant for © 
city to secure. It is also becoming a convention city*

The number of important gatherings here is growing each 
year and these are already requiring better facilities 
for their meetings than exist at present# From both these 
viewpoints, as well as for purposes of public gatherings, 
the necessity for a large public hall centrally located, 
is increasing rapidly and should receive early attention. 

During this time, plans were under consideration for a new City 
Hall, which was completed three years later# The same editorial comments 
upon this fact and' makes some interesting comparisons and suggestions# 

“It was hoped that an auditorium of this character 
would be included in the plans for a new city hall, but 
such is not the case® Perhaps some enterprising alderman 
would undertake the project of organizing a public under¬ 
taking of this character, or one or more of our rich citi¬ 
zens might emulate the late Hart Massey of Toronto by pre¬ 
senting such a building to the city# Toronto receives a 
great deal of advertising besides illimitable pleasure 
from Massey Hall, while other and older cities, both in 
England and in this continent, have cultivated the artis¬ 
tic taste of their citizens through the facilities which 
such a structure offers. 

“Calgary urgently needs an auditorium and sugges- 

( 2 ) 

tions as to how it can best be secured will be welcome.“ 

This plea has been repeated many times, but then as now, has 
fallen upon barren ground. 

Some consideration was given to a civic centre with auditorium 
in the famous and elaborate Mawson Plan for Calgary published in 1914

by the Town Planning Commission.^^ This proposed a ’’mall 11 of civic 
buildings stretching from Fourth Street West to Centre Street along 
the south bank of the Bow River and extending far enough to utilize 
Prince's Island* At the eastern end of this concourse, flanked by 
city hall, museum, library and educational buildings, was to be a 
convocation hall, the civic auditorium, conveniently and centrally 
located. The plan and the published report have since been relegated 
to the civic archives. 

Calgary has had many and varied concert halls which have given 
her citizens programmes by local as well as by professional individual 
artists and groups. So well served was the city during the season of 
1911-12 that the music-loving public found it difficult to support all 
worthwhile presentations* Within one week, between November 21 and 29, 
1911, Calgarians had the opportunity of hearing four outstanding per¬ 
formances |oy Mark Hamburg, pianist, Williams' Jubilee Singers, Jan 
Kubelik, violinist, and the International Operatic Company. Calgary 
was certainly a cultural centre, but with more far© than its relatively 
small population could then adequately digest.

CHAPTER IV, 


PERSONS CONTRIBUTING TO CALGARY *3 MUSICAL DEVELOPMENT . 

The attainments of this comparatively young community in drama, 
art and music are in great measure due to the effort and enthusiasm of 
those who devoted untiring energy to its cultural life over several 
decades. Their names and their contributions can be recalled by the 
older elements of the city's population. To the younger members, who 
are indebted to them for the cultural opportunities that are now theirs 
to enjoy, these names are unfamiliar and insignificant. Brief consid¬ 
eration of the work of each may serve as an expression of appreciation 
and as a means of keeping their memories alive. 

Reference has been made in an earlier chapter to Col. J, 8. Dennis, 
Mr#. P# L# Neweombe and Mr. Frank Wrigley. Special mention must now b© 
made of three ladies who did much for Calgary's musical development. 
These are Mrs. W. Roland Winter, Mrs. Annie Glen Broder and Mme. Ellis 
Browne, 

Although not an Alberta pioneer, Mrs. Winter had the indomitable 
spirit of the first-comers. She settled here at the right time to 
become a force in the development of Calgaiy's ©esthetic life and to 
play a large part in making the city a finer and more pleasant one 
in which to live. 

Mrs. Winter arrived in 1895 after her husband, a judge of the 
District Court, had found the climate to be beneficial# Both had a 
rich cultural background and were anxious to pursue these interests 
in their new place of residence. They had much to give and did not 
stint in the giving. 

Judge Winter was very musical and was most proficient on the 
'cello. He was the sustaining influence behind the early orchestras 
which played the accompaniments for the amateur productions presented

in Hull’s Opera House. In these his wife took an active part. 

In later years, Mrs. Winter described this early instrumental 
group in an article appearing in The Calgary Herald. 

"As for the personnel of the company, the then 
editor-owner of The Calgary Herald, the late Mr. J. J. 

Young, wielded the conductor’s baton; a much-loved 
Calgarian, Dr. Sanson, played the piano; "Johnny 11 
Augade was the f irst violin. His name wasn’t ’’Johnny' 5 . 

It was "August© 51 or "Alphonse", but no one ever gave 
him his real name, which goes to show what a good 
fellow he was! The double-base was George Mitchell, 
and the first 'cello, Judge Winter. Amateurs and 
professionals all linked fingers to create as good 
support for the singers as possible. Our oboe was a 
former instrumentalist in the Paris Opera, a clever 
player cast up on these far distant shores for a 
brief sojourn. There were numerous other members of 
the orchestra whose names I have forgotten. 

Mrs. Winter had travelled widely in Europe and Asia with her Span- 
ish-Portuguese mother and English diplomat father. She had had profess¬ 
ional experience as a singer and actress, and had achieved success and 
recognition on the English stage# A great love for England and things 
English possessed her. She never lost her nostalgia for that country 
and it was possibly that regard which made her so active in encouraging 
cultural pursuits in Calgary. She tried to bring to the West the advan¬ 
tages of the older country. She was active in music, dramatics and 
art, - an enthusiastic participant and critic whose judgments and 
encouragements were felt in all these fields. As a director of

dramatics, she was unsparing in her criticism, applying her own high 
standards to amateur work. Her personal experience made her a capable 
instructress of voice production as well as an authority on stage de¬ 
portment. No musical or dramatic gathering was complete without her 
presence. Her opinion on many problems was sought and respected, and 
perhaps in no particular was her advice of more value than when 
directed to the assistance of young and ambitious students. 

Soon after her arrival in the city, Mrs. Winter became associated 
with the Calgary Operatic Society in the presentation of "The Geisha”. 
This was its first performance on the North American continent. She 
sang the leading role of O'Mimosa San. Presented as a benefit for the 
General Hospital, it was a huge success. It ran for three nights be¬ 
fore capacity audiences in the Old Opera House. Ranchers from Cochrane 
and other surrounding districts thought nothing of riding in for such 
an outstanding event. To many of them light opera and Mrs. Winters 
characterization were reminiscent of the Old Land. v ^ 

This was the first of many presentations in the field of musical 
comedy with which Mrs. Winter was associated either ©s principal or as 
the director. Sometimes she participated in both capacities. Each of 
the years preceding and succeeding the turn of the century saw the pre¬ 
sentation of an operetta which had won popularity in the larger centres. 
These included such favorites as “Dorothy”, “Floradora”, ”The Cingalee” 

and "The Country Girl” besides the Gilbert and Sullivan successes, 

( 2 ) 

”The Mikado” and ”The Yeomen of the Guard”. 

Under Mrs. Winter*s leadership nothing daunted the members of the 
society. They courageously met the challenge of the new works and the

inadequacies of the.early halls and theatres® Years later Mr. Winter 
emphasized the spirit among these early amateurs when she wrote of a 
current local performance: 

"One could not help contrasting the old "Opera House" 
with its gallery usually filled to the roof, and its many 
disadvantages "back stage" with our present beautiful 
theatre. Nevertheless, good' performances took place. The 
rehearsals were productive of much harmless fun and new 
> friendships, and many regrets when the finished work of 
several weeks came to an end. 

During her later years, Mrs. Winter became interested in the Little 
Theatre movement* She directed the majority of plays offered by this 
group. Musically, her interests turned from the field of light opera 
to that of chamber music. She was a force behind the presentation of 
recitals by a trio of piano, violin and ’ cello in the Palliser Hotel 
on Sunday afternoons during several fall and winter seasons. She con¬ 
tributed frequently to the local papers under her initials L.M.W* upon 
musical and dramatic events and upon a variety of artistic subject® 
such as china and painting. Her interests were wide and vital. Her 
personal beauty, her commanding personality and her extensive knowledge 
all combined to make a decided mark upon Calgary’s cultural development. 
Mrs. Winter passed away on October 16, 1939 in her home which was 
located on Nineteenth Avenue and Fourth Street West* It has since been 
torn down to provide an adequate sit© for the Athlon© Apartments* 

Col. J* S. Dennis was responsible for Mrs. Annie Glen Broder’s de¬ 
cision to come to Calgary. At the close of the Riel Rebellion in which 
he had participated. Col. Dennis re-entered the government service as 
chief inspector of surveys* During this period of his residence he

Penzance" and "Erminie" and the oratorio "The Holy City"# 

In 1896, Col# Dennis was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Public 
Works for the North West Territories# This promotion necessitated his 
transfer to Regina. It was here that he came into association with 
Mrs# broder and recognized her musical abilities when she was hurriedly 
called upon to act as accompanist for the Regina Choral Society in 
their presentation of "H#M.S. Pinafore"# "And folks not possessing 
even the slightest taste or inclination to musical matters just gasped 
when they saw the difference in the performances,"^^ 

In 1902, Col# Dennis became assistant to the Vice-President of the 
Canadian Pacific Railway with headquarters in Calgary# Here he esta¬ 
blished the Department of Natural Resources. Resuming his leadership 
in the city's musical activities, he "officially invited" Mrs# Broder

friend of Sir Arthur Sullivan and Sir John Stainer 


After graduation she was given positions requiring both literary 
and musical skill. She undertook the musical criticism of the famous 
concerts of Dr. Hans Richter, Sir George Henschel snd the guest conduc¬ 
tors of the historic Philharmonic Society of London. 

Miss Glen had always cherished an ambition to write a book on mus¬ 
ical accompaniment, a special department of musical art in which she 
excelled. In this she was not encouraged by any of the eminent music¬ 
ians who praised and furthered her efforts in other ways. Sir Arthur 
Sullivan and Sir John Stainer strongly si vised her not to waste her time 
on such an uncertain venture. They, along with musical publishers, 
considered that it was impossible to teach the art of accompaniment by 
book, and that if such a book were written, no one would buy it. 

Quite undaunted by these pessimistic opinions, she finally brought 
out the book entitled rt How to Accompany 1 ’. It met with immediate success, 
going into a second edition within six- weeks. As a result of its pub¬ 
lication, classes on accompaniment were formed in the Royal College and 
in the Royal Academy. Miss Glen was chosen adjudicator for the Sir 
Charles Santley prize for accompaniment at the latter institution* Sir 
Alexander Mackenzie, principal of the acadeay, was one of the first to 
recognize the book*s value. As a consequence of its merit. Miss Glen 
was invited to lecture at Dublin University for the New Scientific 
Society, and also at Oxford. At the latter university, Sir John Stain¬ 
er, acting as chairman of the lecture, generously admitted that he was 
wrong in forecasting failure for her venture on behalf of artistic 
accompaniment. As a crowning recognition. Her Majesty Queen Victoria 
commanded copies for herself and for her Imperial Majesty the Empress 
Frederick, a distinction which included the privilege of presenting any

future work for the acceptance of the Sovereign. 

During this time she was called upon to give recitals of songs and 
accompaniments before audiences ranging from eminent musicians in the 
large cultural centres of England to ship-builders, miners and factory 
hands in Wales, Yorkshire and the Midlands. She also had many associa¬ 
tions with the royal family, being called upon to perform before "The 

Prince" as King Edward VII was then called, and also enjoyed the privi- 

( 2 ) 

leges of playing for and with H.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh who was 
an enthusiastic violinist. 

It has been a matter of some conjecture as to the circumstances 

which brought a person, so endowed with fine musical gifts and with 

indisputable musical knowledge, and moving in distinguished circles in 

England, to a pioneer life in the West. 

In her earlier years, it seems that Miss Glen had kept company with 

or had been engaged to one, Richard Broder, who was a classics master at 
(4) 

St. John*8 College. As a result of a misunderstanding or quarrel he 
emigrated to Western Canada, settling in Regina. Nfe one there had the 
slightest inkling about him. He married, had two sons and kept a few 
good milking cows which seemed sufficient for their livelihood. His 
wife died and the boys were able to carry on the milk business. 

He contacted his old sweetheart. During the correspondence he in¬ 
timated that he had important positions in the Bank of Montreal and in 
the church. He painted such an attractive picture of his circumstances

(4) The obituary notice published in the Calgary Daily Herald, Sept. 11,

writer the details of this "Regina episode" from personal exper¬ 
ience, states Mr. Broder to have been a classics master at Rugby. 
Regardless of the college or university, he was an educated gentle¬ 
man, which his appearance and attitude in Regina belied.

that upon his invitation Miss Glen consented to come and share his life. 
His relation of "important positions" was not altogether a fiction. In 
the bank he was the general caretaker and in the Presbyterian Church he 
attended the furnace, two very important roles during a Regina winter. 

In appearance "Old Dick", to use his common appellation, was not at 
all prepossessing. He had black hair; he never shaved, and went about 
clothed in rags. But he had ambitions* He desired a position in the 
Customs Office* He was told it was out of the question unless ha passed 
the Civil Service examinations. No one every imagined he wes able to do 
that, and it wasconsidered an easy way to get rid of him. To everyone h 
surprise he took the examination and passed with flying colors. But he 
did not get the job. 

When Miss Glen arrived at Regina she failed to recognize her sweet¬ 
heart in the unkempt person of "Old Dick" who attempted to embrace her* 
When he explained who he was, she informed him it was "off"* He finally 
brought her "around" and they were married. 

Immediately she began to teach* Soon she had a number of elemen¬ 
tary pupils for the piano and for vocal training. She extended her field 
to include Moose Jaw where she taught during the last three days of each 
week. Here she organized choral groups of adults and of children. She 

presented Sir John Stainer^ "The Daughter of Jarius" with the former, 

( 1 ) 

and a number of "fairy" operettas with the latter. / 

As the months slipped by, she made her influence felt, not only in 

Regina, Moose Jaw and the Territories, but eastward to Winnipeg and 

Toronto. The Mail and Empire of the latter city observed at this time 

that "Canada was fortunate in getting such a many-sided musician to ad- 

( 2 ) 

vance the cause of music. ' In 1902 she had the honor of being 

(1) Miss E. L. Glasford, Calgary teacher, studied piano under Mrs. 

Broder at Moose Jew. Her mother sang in the adult group and she 
in the children’s group.

present at the coronation of Edward VII in Westminster Abbey* On that 
occasion she acted as special correspondent for the Toronto Globe. 

It was shortly after this that she came to Calgary, the family tak¬ 
ing up residence in a small, house on Northcote Avenue East, now Fifth 
Avenue* Mrs* Broder assumed the financial responsibilities of the home 
through her music. Her husband was the housekeeper until his death in 
1924* Her stepsons established homes in Edmonton and Vancouver* 

Her distinguished reputation must have preceded herto Calgary* 

This was not to the advancement of her best interests as is suggested 
in her advertisement running in The Calgary Herald at repeated intervals 
after November 5, 1903. 

5, Mrs* Broder 

Organist of the Pro-Cathedral 
is now settled in her house on Northcote Avenue 
where she is receiving pupils* 

“Many rumors having been current concerning Mrs. Broder 9 a charges - 
which as a matter of fact were in England at the rate of a guinea an 
hour (§5) - she thinks it would be well to make it clear that in 
response to the representations of those who are keen to learn but 
would find anything like that price prohibitive, she has decided to 
take students in singing for $1*50 a lesson and pianoforte students 
for $1*50 a lesson (45 minutes). 

“These tercns will not be raised until further notice. 59 
The musical activities in which Mrs. Broder engaged during her 
long period of residence in Calgary were numerous. As teacher, recital¬ 
ist, lecturer, accompanist and critic, she became the authority upon 
things musical* Across the Dominion she gained wide recognition. She 
maintained a close association with musicians and musical developments 
in the Old Land by extensive correspondence and visits. 

An article based upon a personal interview and dealing with her 
contribution to musical development states in part, 

“Mrs. Glen Broder declares that the pioneering in 
music in Alberta has been a joy - its results have been

so manifest and so tremendous. When one considers the 
number of students, successful candidates, licentiates, 
gold and silver medalists, who have received instruc¬ 
tion and inspiration from her; the musical and literary- 
organizations which have benefitted by her experience 
and criticisms; the choral societies that have obtained 
assistance from her and the high standard of musician- 
ship in this city and province, largely through her 
genius and culture, it must be realized that Mrs. Brod- 
er*s services have been and are of inestimable value to 
this young country."^ 

This article concludes by stressing the peculiar significance of 
Mrs. Broder in the cultural progress of the West. 

"Although declaring that she did not come to Calgary 
early enough to be an old-timer nor recently enough to be 
a novelty, she is regarded as the veteran authority on 
musical instruction and interpretation in Alberta, form¬ 
ing a most charming link between the aspiring artiste of 
a new land and the time-tested institutions and cele¬ 
brities of the cld. M ^ 

Dr. Lawrence Mason, the musical critic of the Toronto Globe who 
visited Calgary in 1928 wrote the following of Mrs. Broder at that time. 

"The outstanding older musician in the city is Mrs# 

Glen Broder, a lady of the highest social distinction 

both in Canada and in England, who has been active and 

influential in Calgary for more than a generation as

teacher, critic, accompanist, recitalist, organist 
and general leader* To a thorough practical knowledge 
of many instruments and a fine equipment in musical 
theory, history and culture, she adds an unusual per¬ 
sonal acquaintance with most of the more eminent 
British musicians since latter Victorian days, and is 
thus pre-eminently fitted to keep alive the best trad¬ 
itions of the art. The British tradition is so strong 
here, in fact, that the Associated Board examinations 
are taken by many more pupils than are the Toronto 
Conservatory examinations.”^^ 

Subsequent chapters of this thesis will describe in greater detail 
the part played by Mrs. Broder in furthering choral and orchestral 
groups and in encouraging musical education. In concluding this account, 
mention must be made of her work in musical criticism as it appeared in 
English, Canadian and local papers. 

As the representative from Canada to the Old Land on various his¬ 
toric occasions, Mrs. Broder was unique* In 1902, as has already been 
stated, she represented Canada musically at the coronation of Edward VII* 
In 1911, in a similar capacity, she was present at the coronation of 
George V* She attended the ceremonies in Westminster Abbey celebrating 
the Diamond Jubilee of Confederation. In 1929 she was present at the 
service of thanksgiving for the recovery to health of King George. She 
was in attendance at the opening of Canada House by Their Majesties, 
when the Hon. P. C. Larkin was High Commissioner for Canada. A few 
months before her death in August, 1957, she witnessed the coronation 
of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth.

By these visits Mrs* Broder maintained her connection with assoc¬ 
iates of past years* These ties were further maintained by her news¬ 
paper work* She was a special contributor to such English periodicals 
as '’World”, "Pall Mall Gazette", "Musical Standard" and to Cassell's 
Magazines* 

In 1954, at the Anglo-American musical conference held in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, the Dominion was represented by Mrs. Broder* She had been 
invited by Percy Scholes, the convener of the Conference and by Ernest 
MacMillan, principal of the Toronto Conservatory of Music* She was 
the only woman on the Canadian Commission at the gathering and the only 
speaker to report on the general progress of music and the competitive 
festivals in Canada* 

In addition to her capacity of representative musician, Mrs* Broder 
acted as special correspondent at thepe various ceremonials and musical 
conferences, for a number of Canadian dailies* Sir John Willison of 
the Toronto Globe and John W* Dafoe of the Winnipeg Free Press requested 
her to contribute articles. 

Locally, she was musical critic for the Calgary News-Telegram 
until it ceased publication in 1918* From then until her death, she 
did similar reporting for The Calgary Herald. 

"Her musical opinion was valued not only locally 

but by all the great artists who visited Calgary. In 

the clippings forwarded by their advance agents, almost 

invariably Annie Glen Broder in The Calgary Herald was 

quoted. When Greta Stueckgold of the Metropolitan 

Opera Company sang in Calgary she read her report and 

said "I have never had a more intelligent criticism.

Who is this marvellous person you have in Calgary?” 

All the visiting artists seemed to f eel the same way.”^^ 

To musicians, music-lovers and concert-goers, Mrs. Broder “re¬ 
mained a figure of Victorian elegance, retaining a Dresden-like distinc¬ 
tion until the end. When she swept down the aisle at concerts to her 

critic 1 s chair, her befeathered hat swathed in pale pink tulle was 

( 2 ) 

known to half the audience.” ' 

Associated with Mrs. Broder in her lecture and concert work was 
Mrs. Elaine Dudley Smith. Mrs. Smith came to Calgary in 1907* Her 
special field was the teaching of the string instruments. She played 
both the violin and viola, and took an active part in fostering 
orchestral music. For many years she conducted her own string orches¬ 
tra, which had a membership of about thirty players. Her orchestra was 
frequently used to perform illustrative material for Mrs. Broder*s 
lectures or to provide a more satisfying accompaniment than a second 
piano could, for concertos performed by Mrs. Broder*s more advanced 
pupils. 

It was her untiring efforts that sustained interest in orchestral 
music during the period between the disbanding of the Calgary Symphony 
Orchestra of 1915-14 and its reorganization in 1928. Her orchestra, 
made up of her string students and augmented as occasion demanded by 
professional instrumentalists, presented annual concerts in the Palliser 
Hotel. This organization gave the opportunity to outstanding pupils of 
both lira. Smith and Mrs. Broder, as concerto performers, to present 
advanced works.

another lady musician with an English backgroundo She contributed much 
to the growth of the city as a musical centre. This was Madame Ellis- 
Browne, 

Born Marion Ellis, at Cermarthon, Wales, Madame Browne entered 
the Royal Academy at the age of sixteen. There Manuel Garcia was her 
master and students such as Marie Tempest, Julie Nielson, Edward 
German, Stewart Macpherson, Edwin Lemaire, who have since attained fame 
in the musical world, were her associates# 

As a student she was outstanding in vocal work. She won a number 
of scholarships and medals, and was finally honored by having the degree 
of A.R.A.M# granted her in recognition of her high standing and musical 
attainments. 

Upon graduation she became the contralto soloist, first in the 
Stamford Hill Congregational Church, London, and then at St. James's 
Church, Albemarle Street, London, There the Prince of Wales, later 
Edward VII, W. E. Gladstone and other notables, including the great 
Nordica, attended. At that time, in conjunction with choral work, she 
specialized in oratorio. She took a prominent part in the Boosey 
Ballad Concerts and miscellaneous productions as well as instructing 
her class of London pupils. At this time she married# 

After the death of her husband in 1905, she resumed her musical 
career# She became a pupil of the famous Madame Marches!, who included 
Dame Nellie Melba among her pupils# Madame Browne studied with Marches! 
for two years end was assistant teacher in her London studio for another# 
In July 1903 she came to Canada to visit her father who was resid¬ 
ing at Nelson, B.C. With her three children, she made what was intended 
to be a brief stop-over in Calgary. But Frank-Wrigley, the organist at 
Knox- Church, persuaded her to remain for a visit# Calgary became her 
home from that time until her retirement and final return to England

in the fall of 1956* 

Her old world culture, her musicianship and her thorough teaching 
proved of immense value to ambitious students and musical organizations 
in the city and throughout the province# As musical directress of the 
First Baptist Church from 1909 to 1920 she raised and maintained high 
standards of sacred music in that choir# It was considered one of the 
best. Then, in the capacity of mueic instructress in the Calgary 
Normal School from 1909 to 19^6 she exerted an extensive influence 
through the teachers on the cities, towns and rural areas# In her 
private pupils she had many notable successes as evidenced in the 
results of the Associated Board examinations and of the Alberta Musical 
Festival competitions# Some of her pupils attained recognition overseas# 
Odette de Foras was an opera star in Covent Garden# Florence McHugh 
figured in the London theatrical world and Eleanor Newton White took 
leading parts in C. B# Cochran's productions in England. 

Frequent visits overseas maintained Madame Browne's associations 
with British traditions in music# Upon retirement, she returned to 
London to be with her daughter who had won a brilliant musical career 
there# In February, 1941, while active in the musical phases of war 
work, she passed away rather suddenly. 

The credit for the attainment of Calgary as an established and 
recognized musical centre must be given to these three outstanding 
women, Mrs# Winter, Mrs, Broder and Madame ElLis-Browne# Each one was 
a strong individualist, regal in bearing and determined in spirit# 

Each was politely gracious to the other, uncompromising and firmly 
opinionated# What they failed to do through their unwillingness to 
cooperate, was to a good measure accomplished by their individual 
singleness of purpose to maintain the best and highest of the English 
tradition in their own particular fields - Mrs# Winter in light opera

As regards other ladies who have played a vital role in Calgary^

CHAPTER V. 


THE GROWTH OF CHORAL MUSIC IN CALGARY - "The Atonement", the 

Philharmonic Society and the Bridge Festival. 

Choral music is one aspect of Calgary's musical development that 
has given evidence of a continuous growth. Once initiated, this phase 
has shown marked progress in a variety of organizations under a number 
of skilled leaders, until Calgary has gained recognition as a musical 
centre through the efforts and activities of its choral groups and its 
church choirs. Choral music enlists the services of more amateur mus¬ 
icians than any other phase of music, and a good choral society has, 
therefore, every reason to be regarded as a civic institution. 

The initial efforts in choral music, outside of those of the 
church choirs or those involved in the presentation of light operas, 
were carried out under the inspiration of Col. J. S. Dennis. During 
the first period of his residence in the city in the early 1890's he 
conducted "The Holy City" (Gaul) with Mrs. Dennis, soprano, and Mrs. 
Alex Allen, contralto, in the leading partsDuring his absence 
in Regina as Deputy Commissioner of Public Works, choral music as a 
distinct phase of cultural growth was neglected. 

Upon his return in 1902, Col. Dennis sought to revive interest 

in music generally and particularly in its choral aspects. It was 

with this purpose in mind that he is reported to have invited Mrs. 

Annie Glen Broder to come to Calgary to "take hold of the musical 

situation". Their collaboration in Regina had been most fruitful 

and in Mrs. Broder he recognized the spirit and the musicianship 

essential to the inspiration and direction of things musical in 

Calgary. Mrs. Broder took up residence here in 1903 and immediately 

they began to plan for the city's musical development.

It was decided that in a new century and in a young country no challenge 
could be more arousing than the choice of a brand new choral work just 
produced in England and this to be performed in Calgary as the first 
time in Canada, The new work was "The Atonement” by Coleridge-Taylor, 
the young English musical genius whose setting of ’’Hiawatha” had caused 
such a sensation in England at the turn of the century# It was hoped 
by Col. Dennis and Mrs# Broder that there would be sufficient musical 
talent in Calgary to provide a chorus of one hundred voices and an ade¬ 
quate orchestra for a work of this kind# As an outcome of its success¬ 
ful production they envisaged the formation of a strong and permanent 
choral or oratorio society. 

Practices commenced in the English Church school house on March 1, 
1904 and ’’The Atonement” was performed in Hull 1 s Opera House on April 26# 
The soloists were Mrs. J. S# Dennis, soprano, Mrs. A# M# Grogan, mezzo- 
soprano, Mrs. R# B# O'Sullivan, contralto, 0. Horsfall,tenor and P# 

Warr, baritone. The chorus numbered fifty-four and a fifteen-piece 
orchestra trained by Prof# A. Augade supplied the accompaniment along 
with Mrs. Broder at the piano and Mr, P# B. Cooper at the organ. 

”The Atonement” created a stir in many circles# Mrs# Broder, 
writing twenty years later of its presentation, stated, 

”--that nothing could so successfully have destroyed 

the former apathy as the furious discussion and antagon¬ 
ism that arose concerning this curious cantata# 

On another occasion she writes in reference to the purpose of the 

presentation and of its reception in certain quarters, 

” —- a bold stroke must be made to start Calgary 

upon an ascending grade of achievement# This view was

strongly contested by a late lamented writer of merry 
wit - Mr, Bob Edwards who, though of most cultured 
antecedents himself, lamented the passing of the irres¬ 
ponsible gaiety of an earlier period, 'Why 1 , he cried 
to all the echoes, 1 Why not give the public what it 
wants? 1 Though secretly sympathizing with the wish to 
keep the western atmosphere free from a too painful 
pedantry, it was impossible to heed his advice. Where, 
indeed, would Calgary have stood now in musical coun¬ 
cils if any amount of derision had been allowed to put 
the clock backi" ^^ 

Mr, Edwards was scathing to the point of ridicule in his criticism 
of "The Atonement", Of it he wrote: 

"Mrs, Jarley's Atonement, a peanut oratorio by 
Coleridge-Taylor, was sung in the opera house Tuesday 
evening before a large audience. We apply the word 
peanut because it needs roasting, 

"That a coterie of ladies and gentlemen of culti¬ 
vated musical intelligence could put themselves to the 
bother of practicing, rehearsing and producing at in¬ 
finite trouble to themselves such a blithering and 
inchoate mass of discordant sounds as the Atomement 
will remain a mystery. As a piece of musical rubbish, 
it stands alone like a skyscraper. Throughout that 
dreary waste of song there was not one faint sugges¬ 
tion of harmony, and of course none of melody. Other¬ 
wise it would not have been classical enough. Next 
time they produce it, they should start at the end

end sing backwards. It might be better. It could 
not be worse. 

Here, in the attitudes expressed by Mrs. Broder and by Mr. Edwards, 
is exemplified the struggle of traditional culture with its standards 
of artistic achievement against the pioneer spirit with its ingenuity 
and resourcefulness in accomplishment. It is a battle of means - the 
one with precise artistic goals, the other proceeding "any old way." 

But comments expressing surprise at Calgary^ initiative, and con¬ 
gratulating the city for its effort, came from distant parts. Mr. 
Charles H. Wheeler, music and dramatic critic of The Winnipeg Tribune, 
had the following to say regarding "The Atonement": 

"What sort of a place is Calgary that it should 
have the honor of being the first to produce 3. Coler- 
idge-Taylor ! s new oratorio "The Atonement" in the 
Dominion of Canada? 

"The musicians of Toronto, Winnipeg and Montreal 
confine themselves chiefly to performances of a well 
defined line of compositions, of known potency in 
attracting popular favor and incidentally to secure 
financial support. 

"Seldom indeed do these business centres produce 
new works of importance. Calgary is a flourishing city 
of several thousand inhabitants being the capital of a 
vast range of ranching country in the great North West 
sections of Canada and hitherto supposed to be outside 
the pale of musical culture in its highest form. 

"The population of the city, probably because there 
was no incentive toward musical excellence, is principally

devoted to sport, social entertainment among them¬ 
selves, with an occasional production of some old 
comic opera or a drama, both being pl^ed by amateurs. 

"Not long ago in these columns the writer was 
congratulating the citizens of Portage la Prairie upon 
the recent and notable advance made in the concert 
programmes presented by Miss Miller and Mr. Wrigley, 
but the reaction at Portage la Prairie is as nothing 
compared with the astounding development of high class 
music at Calgary in the production of the difficult 
and masterly work "The Atonement" on Tuesday, April 26. 

"It is earnestly hoped that the reputation thus 
gained by the musicians of Calgary may be made perman¬ 
ent. It can be done if sustained by its leading citi¬ 
zens and the generous support of the people or at least 
that intelligent section of the population who are not 
entirely given over to the flippant diversions of the 
time or to the more real attractions of outdoor sport. 

"There can be no doubt that the success of this 
production was mainly owing to the personal efforts of 
J. So Dennis, the Conductor, an enthusiastic amateur 
musician well known in Winnipeg and also to Mrs. Annie 
Broder, an English musician of wide experience in mus¬ 
ical matters and thoroughly imbued with the valued 
traditionary spirit pertaining to the proper perform¬ 
ance of oratorio. 

"But material assistance of the right kind was 
contributed by the organist Mr. Cooper and the first 
violinist Professor Augade.

”A production of oratorio at least once a year 
would give Calgary a solid musical standing in the 
country, and be of immense value to the young people 
of both semes who would otherwise spend their time in 
frivolous amusements during the long winter season."^^ 

In spite of these words of condemnation and of praise, the report 
of the performance in the local press indicated the basis for this 
battle of words# While giving due recognition to the efforts of all 
concerned, it questioned the selection of the work performed. This 
opinion is supported by choristers living today who participated in 
this early choral venture. It was an ambitious undertaking far beyond 
the vocal and instrumental capacities of the musicians available in 
such a young community. 

n That an extremely difficult and complex composi¬ 
tion like Coleridge-Taylor* s "Atonement” lacking, as it 
is, in nearly all the elements of popular music, should 
have been performed by the amateurs of Calgary in a 
manner which called for the hearty applause of a large 
audience, speaks volumes for the musical talent of the 
city. 

“The Atonement” is not an attractive composition. 

It falls far behind "Hiawatha” the cantata which made 
Coleridge**Taylor famous. It has characteristics, not¬ 
ably the numerous high passages for soprano, which 
render it unsuitable for amsteur effort in Calgary, 
where most vocalists lose at least one of their top 
notes. While enthusiasts may see beauty, grandeur and 
profundity in n The Atonement”, to the average music

lover, it is more or less obscure, fantastic and 
lacking in variety of treatment. It nevertheless 
contains much, especially in the choruses that is 
vigorously and powerfully written and there are some 
passages of extreme beauty. —-. 

“The orchestra while not as well balanced as it 
might have been had more instrumentalists been avail¬ 
able, played the difficult prelude and interludes in 
a creditable manner and with the aid of the piano gave 
the chorus strong support, though more trumpet would 
have added greatly to the effect in places. 

“It is to be hoped that the production of “The 
Atonement” will mark th9 beginning of a new epoch in 
choral work in Calgary. The Herald may be allowed to 
express a further hope that th© next work undertaken 
may be of a somewhat easier and more tuneful character 
and one in which both performers and audience can feel 
that mutual sympathy without which no work of this 
kind can be a perfect success. With continued and 
careful work will come with each successive perform¬ 
ance a greater clearness of enunciation, more preci¬ 
sion in attack and more delicacy of light and shade 
in the crescendo and diminuendo passages. Now that a 
well balanced chorus has been got together there are 
immense possibilities ahead of it in these lines and 
the Herald ventures to hope in the interests of music 
generally, that both rank and file and the leaders in 
the good work which is now well under way will be

encouraged to continue upward and onward. 

The hopes of The Calgary Herald and the dreams of Col. Dennis and 
Mrs. Broder were partially realized in the outcome of a meeting held a 
few weeks later in the English Church school house. Those who had 
participated in "The Atonement" and others interested in music in Cal¬ 
gary met to hear the financial report of their recent choral effort 
and to discuss plans for a more permanent organization. The press 
report of the meeting states that, 

"after a very full discussion it was decided by those 
present that the good work done in the way of encour¬ 
aging music by producing "The Atonement" should not be 

allowed to drop, and it was finally decided to organize 

( 2 ) 

the Calgary Philharmonic Society." 

Col. Dennis was elected president along with an executive of 
interested choristers. The proceeds of the past performance, amount¬ 
ing to $80, were handed over to the new organization as a nucleus for 
any work they might undertake in the immediate future. Consideration 
was also given to the society endeavoring to get the necessary chorus 
together to produce in Calgary the Territorial Musical Festival. This 
would be one of the series of musical festivals being organized by Mr. 
C. A. E. Harrisa and to be conducted by Sir Alexander Mackenzie of 
London, England. He was to visit the musical festivals held at the 
various Canadian centres between the Atlantic and Pacific. 

The Calgary Herald of Tuesday, October 25, 1904 announced the 
initiation of the society’s plans.

will be held this evening in McLean’s Hall,

Stephen Avenue, It is hoped there will be a good 
turnout of all those who propose taking part with 
the society in the production of this very fine work 
as it is desired to get together a thoroughly good 
and strong chorus to take up the music for the Mus¬ 
ical Festival, immediately after the production of 
the n Golden Legend !, <> The programmes for the festi¬ 
val have been received from Mr, C. A, E, Harriss, 
and arrangements with him completed to hold the 
festival under the conductorship of Sir Alexander 
Mackenzie in April next. All vocalists in the city- 
are cordially invited to join the Philharmonic Soc¬ 
iety and aid in producing these very fine works.” 

On February 28, 1905, the society performed Sir Arthur Sullivan’s 
"Golden Legend" in the Lyric Theatre with a chorus of sixty voices and 
with orchestral accompaniment. Col. Dennis was the conductor, Mrs. 
Broder presided at the piano and Mr. F. B. Cooper played the organ. 

The soloists were Mrs. J. S. Dennis, soprano; Mrs. R. B« O’Sullivan, 
contralto; 0. Horsfall, tenor; J. D. MeAra, baritone and Dr. G. R. 
Pirie, bass. 

The press report of the following day is rather restrained in its 
praise of the performance. 

"Of the soloists -- they acquitted themselves 

in a manner that bespoke hard and conscientious work. 

As for the chorus — it sang with attack, accuracy 
of tempo, firmness and -— a pleasing delicacy of 
expression. The orchestra was an excellent one and — 
did most creditable work. For the efforts of the 


conductor there can be nothing but praise. To his

energy and thoroughness, supported by Mrs. Broder’s 
ability and long experience, is due the fact that 
last night*s combination of orchestra and chorus was 
so well drilled that scarcely the slightest hitch in 
following the baton was perceptible throughout the 

. »(i) 

evening. 

In the opinion of Mr. P# L. Newcombe, who had arrived in Calgary a 
few months prior to this presentation and who was an interested member 
of the audience, the work was beyond the capacities of chorus, soloists 
and orchestra. The choir was not well balanced, there being a prepond¬ 
erance of ladies. The vocal range of both soprano and tenor soloists 
was inadequate. The orchestra was not well unified and was ton loud 
in its accompaniments. 

The press report, from which quotations have already been made, 
also implied that the work was beyond the capacity of the audience. It 
took exception to the selection of the "Golden Legend" as a suitable 
number for concert purposes "in a limited musical constituency like 
Calgary". It recalled the selection of "The Atonement" of the previous 
year by stating that, 

"The Herald seriously advances the opinion, in all 

due consideration and kindness, that except possibly as 

a sort of exercise for vocal training, selections such 

as the "Atonement" and the "Golden Legend" for concert 

purposes are strictly out of place. It is sn undeniable 

fact that, except to the few - the very few who were 

familiar with Longfellow’s beautiful legend of Prince 

Henry and Elsie, very much of last night’s performance 

as far as the audience was concerned was just so much

Greek. - granting that our audiences are ignorant, 

why not start to educate them from the bottom, instead 
of from the top. We don't advocate altogether pandering 
to popular tastes. - Take something easier, some¬ 

thing intelligible, something they (the audience) will be 
gl9d to pay to hear. In time perhaps, they may be edu¬ 
cated to the point where th$r can appreciate even the 
"Atonement". 

In concluding the criticism of the Philharmonics presentation 
The Herald made a constructive suggestion. 

"In future appearances of the Philharmonic Society, 
which is now in splendid condition to do much for the 
cause of music in Calgary, it is a generally felt desire 
that a programme of good standard choruses, whether sel¬ 
ected from grand opera or oratorio, should be put on." 

The annual meeting of the Philharmonic Society followed up this 
suggestion, especially after hearing of the $50-deficit resulting 
from their recent effort. In discussing the nature of their next per¬ 
formance there 

"was a general feeling that it should be a miscellaneous 
programme that would be sufficiently attractive to the 
public to draw a good house and increase the financial 
receipts of the society. 1 ^ 

The second immediate objective behind the organization of the 
Philharmonic Society was the participation of Calgary, through such a 
choral group, in the Dominion-wide festival organized by Mr. Co A* E. 
Harries and to be conducted by Sir Alexander Mackenzie. 

Dr. Harriss was one of Canada's best known musicians at the turn

of the century. During the first decade of the twentieth century he 

sought to encourage a sincere understanding between Canada and the 

various parts of the Empire, especially Great Britain, through the 

medium of musico To do this he brought to Canada 

“men of great musical power from the heart of the Empire 

who in coming amongst us and in the light of workers 

with us in our musical activities, can learn to know us 

for what we are, and from their own knowledge of the 

conditions as found when they come here, enable such 

distinguished visitors from the Motherland to return to 

Great Britain and credit us with aspirations looking unto 

those things that matter, of which we know more about 

( 1 ) 

than we are given credit for. n 

Dr. Harriss was responsible for three Dominion tours, organized 
in the interests of imperial understanding. These were tthe first 
Canadian Festival conducted by Sir Alexander Mackenzie, the Cathedral 
Music Festival by Sir Frederick Bridge in 1908 and the Musical Fest¬ 
ival of the Empire featuring the Sheffield Choir conducted by Dr. 

Henry Coward in 1911# Local arrangements were made to enable Calgary 
to participate end to benefit musically from these outstanding visits. 

The visit of Sir Alexander Mackenzie, principal of the Royal 
Academy of Music, though included among the initial plans of the Phil¬ 
harmonic, does not seem to have materialized as far as Calgary was 

concerned. No further reference to such a festival than that pre- 
(o) 

viously quoted v 'was made in the local paper. Sir Alexander makes 
no mention of it in his chapter ”A Canadian Tour" in his Autobiography,

Singers active in the organization ^^ and musicians in the city at 
that time do not recall an event of that nature. When questioned they 
recall the Bridge Festival which occurred four years later. 

As for the Philharmonic itself, an article dealing with musical 
development in the province contains a statement which indicates a loss 
of vitality in attempting to hold to its original purpose ©e a perman¬ 
ent choral society in the city. 

"The chorus, as now constituted, with Frank Wrigley as 
conductor and Dr. Pirie as the indefatigable secretary, is 
run more upon the lines of an individual choir than a pub¬ 
lic society, but is trained with a thoroughness and preci¬ 
sion, especially in unaccompanied music, that is wholly 
admirable. 

This statement was written just two weeks before a meeting was 
held to prepare for the second of Dr. Harries 5 musical tours. 

Sir Frederick Bridge was the organist at Westminster Abbey. His 
tour involved a lecture upon three centuries of English cathedral music* 
In each city he visited, a mass choir was organized and trained to sing 
specific selections illustrating the development of church music since 
1540. 

On March 5, 1908 such a group was organized in Calgary from the 
membership of the various church choirs. Mr. Frank Wrigley of Knox 
Presbyterian Church was chosen its conductor and Mr. Arthur Qua, organ¬ 
ist at the Pro-Cathedral, was its accompanist. The choir was built up

to number 120 voices, the largest ever organized up to this time

west of Winnipeg.^ Thirteen anthems were prepared.The festival 
was held on May 15 in Knox Presbyterian Church, located on the present 
site of the York Hotel® 


Nothing of a musical nature performed in Calgary up to this date 
met with such enthusiasm in preparation nor was carried to such a success¬ 


ful conclusion as the Bridge Festival* Twelve hundred people attended, 
crowding the auditorium and the adjoining rooms of the Church.' An editor¬ 


ial at that time implies that many were unable to gain admittance and 
directs attention to the need for a civic auditorium in Calgary .^^ 


The letiuref was described in the press report as "interesting and 


witty. 


if somewhat dilatory. 



The choir was complimented for its 


"remarkable tone, color and fine attack and finish obtained in the short 

(5) 

time given over for practice for the festival*" Sir Frederick praised

the excellent work done by them under Mr. Wrigley 1 a leadership. 

A few weeks later Dr. Harriss announced in a telegram to Mr. 
Wrigley, that Calgary had been "awarded the blue ribbon of Western 
Canada comprising all the territory from Winnipeg to Vancouver, 
for its magnificent choral effort. It was no slight honor to the 
city that its singers had surpassed those of Winnipeg, Regina, Moose 
Jaw and Vancouver. 

This success gave considerable impetus to choral music in Calgary. 

Within a few days of the announcement, a very enthusiastic meeting was 

held and as a result, the Calgary Philharmonic Society and the Bridge 

Festival Chorus were disbanded, and the Bridge Choral Society was 

formed. Plans were made to enlist 180 voices for the coming season 

and to commence rehearsal for the next concert at the end of September. 

Hopes were expressed to give a percentage of that concert’s receipts 

to the hospitals so that the work of the society would be worthy of 

wide public support. The members recognized that they had a reputation 

to maintain and that they would, 

"spare no efforts to uphold Calgary’s latest honor - that 

( 2 ) 

of having the finest choir in Canada west of Toronto. ' 

Mrs. Broder, who accompanied Sir Frederick Bridge on his western 
tour as special correspondent for the Winnipeg Free Press, commented in 
a letter to the Editor, The Calgary Herald,^"upon this choral success 
and upon the consequent reorganization of the city’s choral forces. 

"I should be glad to express through the courtesy 
of your columns a cordial satisfaction at the result of 
the competition, also at the outcome of it which is 
still more significant. Thanks to the thoroughness and

efficiency of the conductor such a musical victory will 
add enormously to the prestige of the city, and the 
formation of a Bridge Choral society will complete the 
distinction as being unique and peculiar to Calgary rather 
than a mere imitation of organizations elsewhere*" 

In the same letter Mrs* Broder stated what she considered to be 
the reason for the failure of the Philharmonic Society to attract 
greater public support. 

"It is only upon a definite basis of purposeful 
endeavour that a society can hope to stand four-square 
and rise to a lofty height* By the opportune and in¬ 
spiring visit of Sir Frederick this desirable consumma¬ 
tion seems at last to have been reached* The position 
of the Philharmonic was becoming untenable, for the 
reason that.it was not upon a fair footing; its aims 
were too indefinite, and a great deal of splendid 
energy was being wasted in trying to prove a wrong 
conclusion," 

She also expressed an opinion upon the value of the Bridge Festival 
in the development of choral music in the city and of its appreciation 
by the general public, 

"In the musical events of last winter the force 
of public opinion unmistakably made itself felt; and 
with the agreeable climax of the Bridge Festival con¬ 
cert •* due allowance for the attraction of the famous 
personality engaged in it having been made - two facts 
stand out in clear relief. One is that the concurr¬ 
ence of a really representative chorus and the sym¬ 
pathy of other musicians can only be secured - and

held - upon the broad lines of a consistent aim and 
a progressive policy. The other that Calgary is more 
willing to support serious music when a sufficiently 
distinguished and coherent programme is placed before 
it," 

In Concluding her letter, Mrs. Broder, while commending the prim¬ 
ary aims of the new choral society, questioned the secondary motive of 
raising funds for worthy charitable institutions as an additional means 
of attracting and sustaining public interest, 

"Your very suggestive comment upon the recent 
victory as a starting point for further achievement 
strikes the right note. The pronouncement of the 
new organization is equally admirable in taste and 
tone. There is only one reactionary item in the 
proposed plan, i.e., the appeal to the secondary 
motive of helping hospitals. This would put back 
the society into the ranks of the parochial and 
amateurish, and would not be in the highest inter¬ 
ests of art. A city that aspires to metropolitan 
methods and that has every reason to expect the 
best and give the best for music*s sake alone, to 
a chorus that has inscribed the name of Calgary 
upon the roll of honor, should need no such incen¬ 
tive, The Bridge Choral society should be free to 
develop its utility upon the most advanced working 
principles. And I very cordially hope that it will." 

The Bridge Choral Society, though organized on the wave of such 
civic enthusiasm and supported by the good wishes of press and critics, 
did not survive. There was a lack of sustained effort so essential to

its continuous existence. Rehearsals were held during the fall months 
but the programme under preparation was never presented. Persons 
living today who were active members of the society^ ^cannot recall 
any of its efforts after its brilliant display of May 1908. Some imply 
that internal dissension end jealousy played a large part in the 
collapse, while others suggest that the then smaller and. more virile 
Apollo Choir under Mr® P. L. Newcombe proved more attractive to the 
choristers.

CHAPTER VI. 


THE GROWTff OF CHORAL MUSIC IN CALGARY (Continued) - 
The Apollo Choir and the Sheffield Chorus. 

"Bravely charging the breach left by the Phil¬ 
harmonic Society, Percy Newcombe has successfully 
met a growing need by founding a second society 
for the performance of oratorios." 

Thus did Mrs. Broder dramatically describe the organization and 
the purpose of the Apollo Choir. 

Mr. Newcombe was associated with two musical presentations between 

the time of his arrival in Calgary in 1904 and the formation of the 

choral group referred to above. On February 15, 1905, for the occasion 

of the opening of the new Central Methodist Church, he presented 

( 2 ) 

Andreus Romberg's "The Lay of the Bell". The organ had not been 
installed and his choir of almost fifty voices was accompanied by piano 
and a ten-piece orchestra. Among the soloists was Mr. J. D. McAra, 
still a respected citizen. 

The next year witnessed Mr. Newcombe*s only venture into the field 
of light opera. On April 25 and 24, 1906, he conducted "The Princess 
Eonnie" in the Lyric Theatre. In this production he was associated 
with Mrs. Roland Winter as director end leading lady, and with Mr. M. 0# 
Bernard as stage manager. A third performance of the opera was given 
on April 25 in aid of victims of the San Francisco earthquake which 
had occurred a few days earlier.^' 

The following year Mr. Newcombe returned to his chief interest,

choral music, when he planned the premiere presentation^ 1 ^in Calgary 
of Handel's "Messiah". He sought Mrs. Broder's assistance but wa 3 
haughtily refused as she considered the work too ambitious for him as 
conductor and for local choristers. He experienced difficulty in obtain¬ 
ing an organist. Both Mr. Cooper of the First Baptist Church and Mr. 
Wrigley of Knox Presbyterian Church refused to serve. At the very last 
moment when he was quite prepared to use the piano accompaniment of 
Miss Ethel Vickery, he heard of Mr. Arthur W. Merrick, a young English¬ 
man who was farming in the Okotoka district. He proved an efficient 
Hendelian accompanist. Today Mr. Merrick is the organist in one of the 
large churches in Great Falls, Montana. Among the soloists was Mr. 

T. H. Magee, a farm hand working in the Crossfield district. 

The oratorio was presented in the First Baptist Church on December 
17# 1907. That church was the only one possessing a pip© organ at that 
time. The four-page programme of the event, besides listing the solo¬ 
ists, choir personnel and the words of the oratorio, contained this 
heavily underlined statement, 

* "The object of the offering to be taken is to defray 
£ 

the expenses in connection with the production of this 
work, which amount to about $200. The committee request 
a liberal offering from those present in view of the 
limited seating capacity of the building." 

In 1908 the choir was organized as a choral society under the 
name "The Apollo Choir". A later programme contained the purpose of 
the organization and the conditions of membership. 

"Its purpose is to cultivate in our citizens the 
desire to hear and enjoy the great masterpieces in choral 
music and to give singers the pleasure and profit to be 
derived from the study of these works. 

(l) The Calgary Herald, December 18, 1907. 




- 6 k - 


“The choir is reorganized annually and a cordial 
invitation is extended to singers to become members of 
the organization. The conditions attached to membership 
arei (l) A voice test by the conductor to ascertain if 
the applicant has sufficient vocal equipment to under¬ 
take the work; (2) Faithful attendance at rehearsals; 

(5) Payment of a small fee which is used to cover the 
cost of music. 

The first work undertaken after the reorganization was Haydn*a 
“Creation 11 . Three soloists were brought in from Winnipeg, Mrs. T. H. 
Verner, Mr. Norman Douglas and Mr. John Moncrief. Mr* Moncrlef was 
the editor of the Winnipeg Tribune. The oratorio was performed in Cen¬ 
tral Methodist Church on April 7, 1908 before an audience “numbering up- 
( 2 ) 

ward of 1000“, The press report contained two significant statements. 
“The standard reached by the Apollo Choir last 
evening was a surprise to many, and a cause of gratifi¬ 
cation to all who heard it.”^'^ 

From this it would seem that the memories of the “Atonement” and 
the "Golden Legend" had faded and now oratorio was being presented 
more acceptably by this group to a more receptive audience. 

“In conclusion, one cannot help regretting that 
an attempt could not have been made to secure orchestra 

accompaniment. - It would be good to hear a 

Calgary choir supported by a Calgary orchestra; and 

(4)

It was the Apollo Choir that was instrumental in introducing the 
symphony to Calgary audiences and later played an important role in 
initiating the presentation of a local symphony orchestra,^' 

The programmes of subsequent concerts indicate a gradual departure 
from the presentation of a single choral work to the presentation of 
miscellaneous choral numbers of outstanding merit and interest. Plans 
seem also to include the appearance of an outside soloist, vocal or 
instrumental, from points as far distant as Toronto and New York, This 
was the character of the concert presented in the Lyric Theatre on 
February 15, 1909* The first part consisted of selections from the 
"Messiah 11 , while the second portion was made up of choral numbers and 
selections by the visiting artists. On this occasion the soloists 
were Mrs, Vemer of Y/innipeg and Mr, 01 en Hall of New York, 

The Apollo Choir programmes show an increasing desire to master 
choral works of merit and interest, and to challenge the abilities of 
the singers. The programme of the third season, 1909-10, included 
Tschaikowsky 1 s "Legend", Macfarren's "You Stole My Love" and Elgar*s 
"My Love Dwelt in a Northern Land", 

In 1910-11, it© fourth season, the Apollo Choir was assisted by a 
"Calgary Symphony Orchestra" conducted by Mr, A, P. Howells, a capable 
violinist and local music store manager. Each organization performed 
various numbers, - the Choir, Gounod's "By Babylon's Wave", Tschaikow- 
sky's "Angel Spirits Ever Blessed" and Knyvett-Stewart's "The Bells of 
St. Michael's Tower", the orchestra Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance", 
German's "Henry VIII Dances" and Schubert's "Unfinished Symphony". 

Choir and orchestra combined to present C. Villiers Stanford's "The 
Battle of the Baltic" and Elgar's "Epilogue to Carsctacus 'Britons 
Alert'",

It was during its fourth and fifth seasons that the Apollo Choir 
introduced a large symphony orchestra to Calgary, In the spring of 

1911 end again in 1912, the choir presented the St, Paul Symphony Orch¬ 
estra with its vocal soloists, under the direction of Mr, Walter H, 
Rothwell. These concerts were held in the Sherman Rink, The programmes 
included orchestral and choral selections, solos «ith orchestral accom¬ 
paniment and numbers in which choir, orchestra and soloists combined 
their forces. Among the latter were Grieg*s "Landerkennung", Elgar’s 
"Challenge of Thor" from ’King Olaf* and his Epilogue from "The Banner 
of St, George", Gounod’s "Gallia" and Mendelssohn*s Psalm GXIV "When 
Israel out of Egypt Came". 

These ventures were carried out at a considerable financial loss 
to the Apollo Choir, but they meant much to Calgary’s musical develop¬ 
ment and to the choir’s experience* To many it was their first exper¬ 
ience in listening to, or in singing with, a "some funny" orchestra. 

From the visiting symphony the city obtained its first permanent con¬ 
ductor of the Calgary Symphony Orchestra in the person of Mr. Max Weil* 
Mr. Weil played leading second violin with the St. Paul Symphony. 

Calgary appealed to him during his two brief visits and in the fall of 

1912 he took up residence in the city. His work will be discussed in 
a later chapter. 

During its sixth and seventh seasons the Apollo Choir sought to 

aid in the launching of the Calgary Symphony by presenting programmes 

of choral and orchestral music. Go-operation between the two conductors 

was very close, Mr. Weil appearing as violin soloist upon the choir 

programmes that did not feature the assistance of the orchestra. 

The Apollo Choir presented a special concert in Knox Church on 

May 22, 1914. This was in honor of Dr. A. S. Vogt, conductor of the 

(l) Mr. Newcombe relates that in selling tickets to the general 
public, this term was frequently used.

Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, who was passing through Calgary after adjudi¬ 
cating the provincial festival in Edmonton. A varied programme with full 
chorus and men's and women's choruses was given. Dr. Vogt conducted sev- 
eral of these numbers. Interest also centred around numbers by Mr. Wrig- 
ley played on the new organ which was the largest in Western Canada at 
that time. Mr. Weil was featured in a violin obligato to the women's 
chorus. 

The war years witnessed the presentation of concerts of miscellan¬ 
eous numbers with special stress upon those of patriotic sentiment. 

Among the most outstanding choral works were Grieg's "Olaf Trygvason”, 
Coleridge-Taylor's “Hiawatha's Wedding Feast” and Elgar's “The Spirit 
of England”. To satisfy the interest of the times such items as 
Percy E. Fletcher's “For Empire and For King”, Vogt's arrangement of 
“Rule Britannia" and Elgar's “Britons Alert” were included. 

The tenth season, that of 1917-18 was the last complete one for the 
Apollo Choir. The membership, as listed on a programme dated March 19, 
1918, included 50 sopranos, 26 altos, 18 tenors and 24 basses, - a total 
of 98 voices. 

Rehearsals for the eleventh season upon Verdi's “Requiem” were held 
during the fall of 1918. The outbreak of the influenza epidemic with its 
severe quarantine upon public gatherings prevented the realization of 
the season's plan. Choral interest was now swinging to the support of 
the Provincial Competitive Festival. It had been held for the first 
time as far as Calgary was concerned,Iduring the spring of that year. 

Thus the activities of the Apollo Choir merged with the festival move¬ 
ment and Mr. Hewcombe continued to foster choral music through partici¬ 
pation in festival competitions. 

The success of the Apollo Choir during the ten years of its activ¬ 
ity in the musical development of Calgary was due to the high quality of 














- 68 - 


its leadership, Mr, Newcombe directed his efforts toward raising the 
standard of performance among his choristers. He sought to cultivate 
an appreciation of the best in choral music on the part of his audiences. 
He recognized that the realization of these must of necessity be a grad¬ 
ual process. His programmes challenged the ability of his singers; they 
were attractive to audiences. He was wise in preparing miscellaneous 
programmes rather than those confined to the rendition of long choral 
works. His approach to his choir and audience was always gentlemanly; 
his leadership was calm and precise, not dramatic. He was imbued with 
the highest ideals of the choral art, winning and retaining the admira¬ 
tion of all. Today he is most highly esteemed among Calgary's choral 
conductors. 

The growth of Calgary's appreciation of choral music as nurtured 
by the organizations and leaders just described, was indicated by the 
city's reception of Dr. Herriss 1 Musical Festival of the Empire featur¬ 
ing the Sheffield Chorus under Dr. Henry Coward. In the course of its 
world tour, the chorus presented concerts in the Sherman Rink on the 
evenings of May 11 and 12, 1911* City council and citizens left noth¬ 
ing undone to welcome and entertain the chorus and in the evenings 
11 surged into the Auditorium 11 to receive 11 a powerful stimulus to their 
musical development and an immense amount of pure pleasure,"^' 

That Calgary was appreciative of the Choral fare presented for 
its approval was well borne out by statements in the local press. 

Mrs. Broder stated that, 

“It was a high compliment to the west to present 

such solid musical fare as thet offered by its first 

number, "Sing Ye to the Lord" (Bach) and the gratifying 

fact that it was listened to with closest attention and

and genuinely enjoyed is not only a tribute to the 
extraordinary merit of its performance but to the grow¬ 
ing power of western audiences to assimilate complete 
musical works when provided for their appreciation, 

Dr. Coward in a short address before a group of local musicians 
who had tendered the famous conductor and his choir a banquet, is 
reported to have 

"complimented Calgary on its musical appreciation and 
said that he knew as soon a9 he heard the applause 
showered on some of the very intricate selections on 
Thursday night that Calgary contained among its citizens 
some appreciative and intelligent lovers of music.' 

As a result of the visit of this famous chorus, Calgary received, 
a few years later, several of its members who exerted influence upon 
the city’s musical development. Its efficient accompanist. Dr. J. E. 
Hodgson, returned to become organist in Knox Presbyterian Church and 
supervisor of music in the public schools. Miss Pert Windle, the 
late Mrs. William Ireland, came to reside in Calgary and as ©. most 
acceptable contralto soloist contributed much to choral societies and 
church choirs. In the spring of 1918, the Apollo Choir presented Miss 
Jennie Taggart as the soprano soloist in Elgar’s "The Spirit of England". 
Miss Taggart was one of the soloists with the Sheffield Choir on its 
Empire Tour and had later taken up residence in Vancouver. 

This visit of such a famous chorus under such a renowned conductor 
gave impetus to choral organizations. Numerous small groups came into 
being based upon specific national or technical lines. Such was the

Calgary Choral Society under the leadership of Mr. Horace Reynolds. 

Mr. Reynolds was an English baritone soloist who came from the Sheffield 
area to Calgary in 1912. This society fostered the English tradition 
in its presentations of the opera "Maritana" and the oratorios "The 
Me s si ah " and "E1 i j ah". 

At this time Mr. James Smart and his family arrived from Scotland. 
They formed a most talented group, vocal and instrumental, for the 
presentation of Scottish music. To encourage the rendition of such 
songs, and to use his family as a strong nucleus, he organized the 
Scottish Choral Society or as it became familiarly known, the Scottish 
Choir. It attracted to its membership those from Scotland and presented 
concerts each year for the commemoration of St. Andrew*s Day and Burns* 
Anniversary. 

Mr. Smart, who was an Associate of the Tonic Sol-Fah College, was 
interested in the promotion of Sol-Fah reading amongst choir singers. 

He formed classes for this purpose and from them developed the Tonic 
Sol-Fah Choral Society. This group presented programmes of miscellan¬ 
eous number during the years following the close of the First Great War* 

Choral music in Calgary continued during the 1920*s in the com¬ 
petitive atmosphere of the provincial musical festivals. Church choirs 
of various sizes and choral groups of varying interests vied with one 
another for choral honors each year, particularly during the year that 
the festival was held in Calgary. The raising of funds to finance the 
journey to Edmonton or Lethbridge during the other years fostered 
choral presentations in the city. The depression of the 1950*s and 
the complexities of modern city life made it more difficult to finance 
and assemble choral groups and the choir concert became a rare event 
confined to the efforts of the churches.

The thrill of participation in a large choral society, numbering

CHAPTER VII. 


CHURCH CHOIRS IN THE MUSICAL DEVELOPMENT OF CALCARY . 

It was from the choirs of the large and small city churches that 
the choral organizations described in the previous chapters, drew their 
memberso The church choir, with its regularity and continuity of pur¬ 
pose, rallied those interested in choral work* Here such persons found 
an outlet for their talents in the simpler numbers of the choral reper¬ 
toire. Here were afforded opportunities for the maintenance and 
improvement of their vocal techniques. It was to these groups of inter¬ 
ested singers that the ambitious choral conductor with a city-wide 
enterprise in mind could appeal for aid in the formation of a large 
group essential for the presentation of a major choral work. 

The origin of the church choirs of Calgary lay in the desire to 
give inspiration and leadership through music to the services of worship* 
The more musically gifted of the congregation were enlisted* Under the 
baton wielded by one of their number, they sought to improve the sing¬ 
ing of the psalms and the hymns, and to add to the beauty of the services 
and to their own inner satisfaction by rendering the simple harmonies 
found in such anthems as Bamley 1 s ”Now the Day is Over** and Sullivan’s 
’’Homeland”. 

The early choirmasters and organists were often blessed with 
enthusiasm and musical zeal far in excess of their talent and musical 
education. They assumed their positions as extra responsibilities to 
their daily tasks. Among those serving the leading churches were the 
editor of the Calgary Herald, the manager of the Bank of Montreal, 
an official of the local cement company and, in one instance, the 
minister of the church assumed this additional role. 

Having built their choirs upon local talent and reed organs, and 
having increased membership as a result of the city’s growth, the

churches began to employ specially trained leaders, soloists and organ¬ 
ists, and included in their building budgets sufficient funds for the 
installation of pipe organs. The new leaders were more discriminating 
in their selection of voices, the music was more difficult and exact¬ 
ing, and altogether the tone of the choirs was raised. When the musical 
appreciation of the congregation develops through regular contact with, 
and participation in, improved musical aspects of worship, the calibre 
of the work of the individual musician - conductor, organist or solo¬ 
ist - is challenged. Church choirs in giving impetus to things musical, 
become important factors in the cultural development of the city. 

No information is available on the first Calgary church to organize 
a choir. The person considered one of the pioneers in church choir work 
was Mr. J. J. Young, then editor and proprietor of the Herald. For 
fourteen years he was leader of the Methodist Church Choir. When he 
assumed this position, the church was located on 2nd Street West between 
5th and 6th Avenues. The building now forms part of the Arlington Hotel. 
When a larger building was erected on the corner of 7th Avenue and 1st 
Street West under the name of Central Methodist Church, in 1905, Mr. 

Young was retained as choir leader. 

During his leadership a Karen pipe organ was installed. At that 
time it was considered the finest in Western Canada. On October 10, 

1905 it was dedicated by the presentation of a sacred concert# The 
report, under the heading "Large Audience Hears the Organ Music and 
the Vocal Solos", mentioned the following features of the openings 
"Over five hundred people last night attended the 
opening concert for the fine new organ of the Central 
Methodist Church. The remarkable capabilities of the 
organ were displayed on solos by five different organ¬ 
ists, and the same number of vocalists contributed

sacred songs. Generous applause and in several 
instances, encores, greeted the various members of 
a programme so replete with good music as to be 
almost a surfeit* 

“Organ numbers were played by Mr. J. J. Young, 

organist of the church; Miss Cushing, the assistant 

organist, graduate of the Toronto Conservatory of 

Music; P. B* Cooper, A.R.C.O., organist of the First 

Baptist Church; P* L. Newcombe, teacher of Piano and 

Voice; and J* W* Jones, late organist of Holy Trinity 

Church, Elgin, Scotland, and who has recently joined 

( 1 ) 

the music teaching profession in Calgary.” / 

Mr* Young’s trials end difficulties have never been recorded nor 
have his accomplishments, save as they may live in the memories of those 
who at one time have been connected with the choir and his work. From 
the later years of his leadership. Miss Della Jones and Mr* W* V* Moore 
still attend Central Church. His choir at their time of membership 
boasted of two soprano soloists in the persons of Miss Margaret Munro 
and Miss A. Luton, a contralto soloist Mrs. George Crooks and a baeso, 
Mr. Dybert McFarland. 

Mr. Young was succeeded by Mr. Wilber Horner as choir leader and 
Miss Sue Blow as organist on May 15, 1908. Mr. Horner, a baritone solo¬ 
ist, came from eastern Canada to take a position with a cement company# 
Several miscellaneous concerts were given during hie leadership. These 
included the rendition of Stainer’s “The Daughter' of Jarius’ 1 and Fred¬ 
eric Cowen’s “The Rose Maiden”. For the latter work, George Dixon, then 
of New York, later a popular tenor of Toronto, was brought to Calgary as 
soloist. A small orchestra with piano and organ provided the accompani- 
(l) “Sacred Concert”, The Calgary Herald, October 11, 1905.

merit* 

After two and a half years of leadership, Mr 0 Horner was forced to 
resign because of ill-health. He was followed by Mr* Percy Hook, the 
Apollo Choir accompanist and later leader at Grace Presbyterian Church, 
and he in turn by Mr. J*E*W. Rendale, a teacher at Mount Royal College. 

In October 1911, Wilfred V. Oaten assumed the positions of both 
organist and choirmaster at. Central Methodist Church and that of musical 
director at Mount Royal College* The choir gave its first concert 
under Mr. Oaten*s direction in March 1915, presenting Rossini*s ’’Stabat 
Mater 1 ’ and Gounod*s ’’Gallia 11 * In this concert the choir was assisted by 
Miss Estelle Carey, soprano from Hamilton, Mr* Herbert Cave, tenor from 
Vancouver, Miss Florence Bruce, contralto and Mr. Wilber Horner, bari¬ 
tone, both of the city. 

The choir celebrated the 100th Anniversary of Wagner’s birth by 
giving a concert entirely of Wagnerian compositions in May 1915* This 
was the only attempt in Calgary to keep alive the memory of the great 
composer. A few weeks later the choir participated in the Alberta 
Musical Festival in Edmonton competing for the Sifton Shield* The Cal¬ 
gary choir lost to the All Saints Choir of the northern city. This was 
the beginning of keen competition between choirs of these cities for 
choral honors through the festival movement. 

The activities of Central Methodist choir were retarded by the out¬ 
break of war in 1914* The male sections were seriously depleted in num¬ 
bers through enlistments. Its work was further hampered when on 
February 29, 1916 fire gutted the interior of the church, completely de¬ 
stroying the organ. During 1916 services were held in the Grand Theatre* 

With the reconstruction of the church, a new Casavant organ was in¬ 
stalled and dedicated as a memorial organ on May 6, 1917* Shortly after 
this occasion. Dr* Rogers was appointed organist and choirmaster. He

was particularly interested in the festival movement, taking his choir 
to Edmonton and to Lethbridge for the competitions. He was one of those 
instrumental in having Calgsry included in the festival^ three-year 
cycle. 

The choir of the First Baptist Church labored for many years in 
the small building on the north-east corner of the intersection of 6th 
Avenue and 2nd St. West. Occupied August ^>0, 1890, this church was 
used for services of worship until last summer when it was torn down. v ^ 
The musical services of the Baptist congregation were led by Miss Laura 
Eschelman, the late Mrs. J. B. Paterson, a daughter of charter members 
of the church. She continued in this capacity when the new church was 
occupied on February 24, 1901, on the present site of the Greyhound 
Building. Miss Eschelman gave sixteen years of service without remuner¬ 
ation. 

In 1904, Mr. F« B. Cooper, A.R.C.O. took charge of the music. 

Under his direction the choir increased in numbers. A pip© organ was 

installed. The congregational singing which was always an outstanding 

feature of First Baptist Church, was greatly assisted and improved by- 

Mr. Cooper*s accompaniments. Located directly across from the Methodist 

Church, the situation gave rise to numerous stories regarding the rival- 

ry between the two congregations. On one occasion while the Methodists 

were plaintively singing, "Will There be Any Stars in My Crown”, the 

( 2 ) 

Baptist defiantly replied "No Not One, No Not One”. 

The choir at this time presented a number of special programmes, 
one of which included Gaul’s "Holy City". 

By 1909, the music committee of the church felt that the time had 
come when they would require a choral leader as well as an organist. 

(1) The First Lutheran Church used the building until the summer of 1951. 

(2) This story was often told by the late Dr. George W. Kerby, minister 
of Central Methodist Church at that time.

Mme. Ellis-Browne was invited to take full charge of the choir while 
Mr* F. C* Nidd presided at the organ. The growth of choir and congre¬ 
gation taxed their respective accommodation and on May 12, 1912 the 
First Baptist Church moved to its present edifice on the corner of 4th 
Street West and 15 th Avenue. 

From a small choir when Mme* Browne assumed its leadership, it 
grew to rank among the first choirs of the city. In 1915, Mme. Beatrice 
Chapman became organist. These two ladies collaborated until 1920 when 
Mme* Browne resigned. 

During this period the sacred concerts presented by this choir at 
Christmas and at Easter became a feature in the musical life of Calgary. 
The works which this group performed were the simpler cantatas such ©a 
Maunder’s “Bethlehem” and “Olivet to Calvary”, Stainer’s “Crucifixion” 
and “Daughter of Jarius” and Mendelssohn’s “Hear My Prayer”. 

This choir did not take part in the festival movement as an organ¬ 
ization. Its members either entered the competitions as individuals or 
joined those larger groups which participated in the choral classes. 

The history of the Wesley Methodist Church choir is unique in that 
it records among its early conductors the pastor of the church, a con¬ 
cert impresario and a theatre manager. The Reverend Charles W. Bishop 
possessed a voice of soloist calibre and proved himself a successful 
choirmaster. As a Boloist, he contributed to Mr. P# L. Newcombe’s prem¬ 
iere presentation o f the "Messiah” in December 1907*^^ As a choir leader 
he was credited with having one of the finest small choirs in the city. 

With his removal to another ministerial charge, Mr* Bishop was 
succeeded by Mr. J. E. Williams in February 1909* This gentleman was 
most interested in things musical, being a bass soloist of note during 
his previous residence in Winnipeg and was presently engaged in promoting

programmes by outstanding artists under the name of the Calgary Concert 
Bureau* Under his leadership the concerts given raised the status 
of Wesley Choir in the eyes of musical Calgary, 

On December 17, 1911* the church moved from its original building 
at 819 - 15th Avenue West, to its present site on the northwest corner 
of 14th Avenue and 7th Street West, In January 1912, Mr, R* J, Lydiatt 
took charge of the choir, Mr,. Lydiatt was then the manager of the Sher¬ 
man Grand Theatre, Under his direction the choir numbered thirty-seven* 
A few months later a large pipe organ was installed by the Canadian 
Pipe Organ Company and dedicated on Sunday April 28th* On the following 

Wednesday, May 1st, it was officially opened by a grand concert, Mr, 

( 2 ) 

Frank Wrigley as guest organist demonstrated its capabilities. The 
organist of the church at this time was Mr. Leonard Pearson, 

In 1915, Mr* P, L* Newcombe became choir leader at Wesley Church, 
a position he retained until late in 1925* During the latter part of 

( 5 ) 

this period he had Dr* J. E* Hodgson as organist. Mr* Newcombe gath¬ 
ered around him a group of competent church choristers who brought honor 
to the church and their conductor in their successes at the Alberta 
Musical Festivals* 'Wesley Church choir through its, membership and the 
quality of its work was considered among the larger and finer choirs of 
the Calgary churches. 

The choir of the Pro-Cathedral of the Redeemer dates back to the 
time of the wooden church which was built in 1884 and enlarge! in 1895* 
During the early pastorates up to the appointment of the Reverend E, C, 
Pagst as rector in 1900, the church singing was led by a group of men 
and women* There was also for a time, in addition to this choir, a

eurpliced one of boys, which was trained by Mr. A. D. Braithwaite, 
then manager of the Bank of Montreal. Of these. Dr. R. D. Sar^on, one 
of the early members of the choir, writes: 

u In September 1892, I attended the evening service 
in the Pro-Cathedral Church of the Redeemer. Having just 
arrived from Toronto I thought I had left all music be¬ 
hind me, therefore, I was delightfully and agreeably 
surprised at the beautiful rendering of Evensong and the 
sympathetic accompaniment of the organist. The organist 
was a chap named Telford, a Constable in the North West 
Mounted Police, and'he was the finished product. 

A few weeks later Dr. Sanson became organist "when Constable, Telford 

( 2 ) 

was ordered away with the First Detachment of the N.W.M.P. to Dawson'. / 
The instrument was what was called a vocalion. This organ was later 
given to the Anglican Church at Beddington and is still there. 

Regarding the members of the early choirs of the Pro-Cathedral, 

Dr. Sanson has the following to says 

"We had what is known as a mixed choir, with four 
small boys, who could not sing, but they looked well® 

One of these boys is now Dr. L® 3* MaeKid of Calgary; 
another, now Mr. Justice Lucas of British Columbia. The 
tenors and basses were good, the sopranos excellent. As 
I remember, the soprano section at that time consisted of 
the present Mrs. W. R. Winter, the late Mrs. J. 3. Dennis, 
the present Mrs. R. N® Kirkpatrick, Miss Birdie Harris, 

Mrs. 0*Sullivan, the late Mrs® Norton, the Misses Kennedy 
of Victoria, Mrs. Boucher, the late Mre® Msrkley, the

present Mrs, Pearson. Colo J, 3, Dennis was Choirmaster 
and other members of the male section still alive, are 
Larry Clark, C, W, Peterson and F. Hardy, The late Mr, 

’Big' Dick Jephson was an outstanding member of the choir 
and had a 3plendid bass voice. 

Dr. Sanson was followed at the organ by Mrs. Annie Glen Broder and 
she in turn by Mr. F, B, Cooper. In 1908, Mr, Arthur Qua, a young account¬ 
ant of the Imperial Bank, was in charge of the organ. He and his choir 

( 2 ) 

participated in the Bridge Festival of Cathedral Music. 

Mr. Qua was succeeded by Mr. G. E. Holt, Mus. Bee., a teacher at 
Western Canada College. Under his training, a boys 1 choir was brought 
to a high state of efficiency and in 1911 a choir consisting entirely of 
men and boys was constituted on the same model as choirs in the large 
parishes of the Old Country. At this time the choir not only had its 
largest membership, but also attained to its highest degree of efficiency. 

Mr. Holt, who was very well known in the city and especially among musi- 

„ ( 5 ) 

cel people, really '’worked miracles with the boys and men of the choir; 1 

After his departure for the East, Mr. Holt was succeeded by Mr. 

Theodore Sangster, A.R.C.O., who was sent out by Dean Paget on one of 

his biennial visits to England. The choir consisted of some seventy or 

eighty boys and men, and was a splendid foundation upon which the new 

leader could build. However, Mr. Sangster only remained a year. He was 

succeeded by several choirmasters who each remained for comparatively 

short terms. These frequent changes in leadership were not conducive 

to the best in a parish choir and particularly in the maintenance of an 

effective boys’ choir. From time to time ladies had to be recruited to

maintain balanced soprano and alto sections# 

Information regarding the activities of the choir of Knox Presbyter¬ 
ian Church, today Knox United, is limited and appears very inadequate in 
view of the importance of the congregation in the religious life of Cal¬ 
gary# In a series of weekly articles in The Calgary Herald^ the one 
dealing with Knox Choir, though scheduled as the second of the series, 
failed to appear# Church advertising by means of press display blocks 
and news, paragraphs as used today, was not the practice of earlier years# 
Toward the end of this period a column of the Saturday paper dealt with 
the church activities for the following Sunday# The last of the major 
churches to avail itself of this opportunity of informing the public of 
its services was Knox Presbyterian. This may be attributed to that in¬ 
nate characteristic of Scottish Presbyterianism which frowned upon any 
ostentation in its desire to preserve the sanctity of the church and its 
services# This may also explain the non-appearance of the article deal¬ 
ing with the history and organization of the choir# 

References to the choir of the Preebyterian Church are found in the 

early papers# A Presbyterian Church Concert held in Boynton Hall in

December 1886 included numbers by the choir# v ' The music for the 

Christmas Service of 1889 is described in the following sentence,

Mr, 3, Saunders is listed as musical director with a Mrs. Binkley and 
later Mrs. J. G. Templeton as organist. In 1898, Crispin E. Smith is 
noted as choir leader, while in 1901 Mr. John de Sousa and his daughter 
are mentioned as leader and organist respectively. Along with these is 
listed an important official in the person of the organ blower. In this 
capacity the names of Hunter, John Parry and Allan Smith appear. 

In 1905, when the enlarged Knox Church was opened on what is now 
the site of the York Hotel, a choir of forty voices under the leadership 
of Mr. George S. Dingle, conductor, and Miss E. M. Davidson, organist, 
supplied the music for the dedication of the new auditorium and pipe 
organ. The programme included the following anthems: ”0 Come Let Us 
Worship 1 ’, Himmel; ’’Praise Ye the Father”, Gounod; "The King of Love My 
Shepherd Is”, Shelley, and ”0 Gladsome Light”, Sullivan. Solos were 
contributed by Mrs. A. M. Grogan, soprano, Mrs. R. B* 0*Sullivan, con¬ 
tralto, and Dr. George Pirie, baritone. The pipe organ, built by Casa- 
vsnt Freres at a cost of $5,000 was the largest instrument of that type 
between Winnipeg and Vancouver.^' 

( 2 ) 

On November 1, 1905, Mr. Frank Wrigley from Portage la Prairie, 
was appointed organist and choir leader. For the next ten years Mr. 
Wrigley exerted a great influence upon church music and music in general 
in the city in his capacities of choirmaster, organist and conductor of 
choral and operatic organizations. The organ and choir work in the ser¬ 
vices of worship reached a very high standard under his leadership. The 
restrictions placed upon the use of the auditorium and orgen compelled 
the enterprising choirmaster and his singers to seek outlets for their 
abilities along more secular lines in the organizationcf musical activ¬ 
ities outside the church.

These restrictions under which choirs functioned in the various 
churches at this time are suggested in the minutes of the Session of 
Knox Presbyterian Church between 1903 and 1925* The following are 
examples: 


"The Moderator explained that the reason for the 
meeting was for the purpose of finding out the feeling 
of the Session with reference to Sacred Concerts in the 
Church and charging an entrance fee* 

"Moved by Langlands and Neil son that before any 
Sacred Concert is given and. a charge made, that the con¬ 
sent of the Session be obtained each time. Carried. 

"Rev. Dr. McRae v ^'dissented to the motion and wished 
his name recorded against it# J 

The operation of this control by the session, and the elders’ 

desire to guard the sanctity of the auditorium and organ is emphasised 

in the following motions: 

"Moved by Terrill and seconded by Findley that 

the Session views with favor the musical services to be 

( 2 ) 

given by Sir Frederick Bridge 'and is willing, to allow 

the church building to be used for the purpose, and in 

the special circumstances the making of a definite fee 

(4) 

is also granted. Carried." 

"Moved by Terrill and seconded by Neil son that the 
request to allow Mr. Lemaire to give an organ recital 
at which a definite fee is charged be granted on the

understanding that the recital be strictly of a 
sacred character. Carried. 

That even the worthy purpose of the enterprise would not move the 
elders to relax their stand is shown in the following minutes 
"The Moderator stated that the ladies of the 
Ladies Aid Society wished to get the Church for a 
concert to be given by the Edith Miller troupe in 
aid of the Organ Fund. Moved by Terrill and Archi¬ 
bald the request be not granted. 

During the ten years in which he was organist and choirmaster at 
Knox Church, Mr. Wrigley made two innovations in the choir which were 
brought about in spite of some opposition from the session. These were 
the gowning of the choir and the payment of soloists. 

Early in 190?, he requested the use of black gowns for the choir 
members, with mortar-board, hats for the ladies. This did not find favor 
with the session at the time. In the fall of 1909, he repeated his re¬ 
quest, which was granted according to the following session minutes; 

"The moderator called upon Mr. Wrigley, the organist 
who was present to explain what was wanted, in the way of 
gowns and caps for the choir. 

"Moved by Dingle and Lane that the ladies be allowed 
to wear black gowns and mortar-board hats and the men of 
the choir to wear black gowns. 

"Moved in amendment by Neilson and Archibald that the 
ladies only be allowed to wear gowns and caps. Amendment 

lost and original motion carried. Mr. James Linton request¬ 

er) 

ed that his name be recorded as voting against the motion."''

Thus Knox Church had the first choir in gowns and caps among the 
major city churches, - except for the surpliced choirs of the Anglican 
and Roman Catholic Cathedrals - at a time when such were not the common 
custom in church accoutrements. 

It was for the summer months of 1910 that Mr. Wrigley first re¬ 
quested payment of certain of his singers c He desired a paid quartette 
for the months of June, July and August as he found it difficult during 
those months to keep up the choir 

In January 1915, in a report by the choirmaster to the congregation 
and in a record in the minutes of a subsequent session meeting, he ex¬ 
pressed the need of remunerating some of the singers. He felt thatthis 
was essential in maintaining the quality of the choir music, particularly 
when the organization w©3 faced with such fluctuations in membership as 
it had been experiencing during the past two years and with the uncom¬ 
fortable situation of having to sing from the drafty theatre stage. The 

church was worshipping in the Sherman Grand pending the opening of their 

( 2 ) 

new and present edifice. ' ^ 

That Mr, Wrigley*s wishes were acceded to is indicated in the 
following resolution of session and managers i 

"On motion of Mr. E. M+ Saunders, seconded by 
Mr. A, M. Terrill, it was agreed that the principle of 
remunerating some members of the choir be approved by 
the session and managers, and that the Congregation be 
asked to approve the matter, and to authorize the 
session and managers to appoint a committee who shall, 
take charge of the matter."^''

Mr. Wrigley'8 name is associated with the musical progress of Knox 
Church in a very permanent way* On the console of the magnificent organ, 
which was installed by Casavant Freres when the church built the present 
cathedral-like edifice in 1915, is a plate to the effect that "Specifi¬ 
cation drawn and organ opened by Frank Wrigley". Of this organ an 
article written twenty years later states: 

"The color scheme stands to Mr. Wrigley*s credit and 
for tonal tints it has few equals in Western Canada* 

During his remaining years as organist of Knox Church, Mr* Wrigley 
presented from time to time, series of twilight organ recitals on Satur¬ 
day afternoons* Their purpose was to demonstrate the capabilities of 
the organ end to raise funds to meet its cost* They also proved Mr. 
Wrigley to be a versatile master of the instrument. 

In the summer of 1915, Mr. Wrigley resigned his position in Calgary 
to accept a similar one in the First Presbyterian Church, Detroit* Dr* 

J* E. Hodgson, the official accompanist of the Sheffield Choir, succeeded 
him at Knox* He remained with Knox Choir for two years, but as his 
particular field was the organ and accompanying, he resigned to accept 
such a position under Mr. P. L. Newcombe at Wesley Church and to become 
Supervisor of Music in the public schools of the city. 

During the 1917-15 season, the choir was under the leadership of 
Mr. A* Arlidge as conductor and Mr* Harold Ramsay as organist. In Sept¬ 
ember 1918, Mr. G. Herbert Knight assumed the dual responsibility which 
he held for two years until he resigned to accept a position in Balti¬ 
more, U. 3. A. 

Upon the recommendationcf Dr. A. 3* Vogt of Toronto, Mr. Clifford 
Higgin became organist and choir leader in September 1920. He held these 
positions with distinction for over twenty years, in that time building

a strong, effective choral organization for the services of worship and 
one which received recognition in the Alberta Festivals* 

These are the major choirs of Calgary as they developed up to 1920* 
It was in these groups that the average singer found the opportunity for 
his perhaps limited talents in the service of his church and of his city*

CHAPTER VIII. 


THE SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA IN CALGARY . 

A permanent musical organization contributes much to the fame and 
development of any enterprising centre, be it large or small. The 
group may be vocal or instrumental - chorus, quartette, orchestra or 
band - no matter which, as long as it bears the name of that city or 
town. It is a measure of the cultural progress attained by its citi¬ 
zens through their willingness and ability to give continuous support 
to such an organization* It publicizes that centred fame and future. 
It confers upon that city marked social and ethical benefits. 

That there was considerable opinion favorable to the encourage¬ 
ment of such a civic organization In Calgary around the years 1912 and 
1915* is shown by editorial comment and musical criticism at that time. 
This attitude is apparent with regard to the Apollo Choir and its 
record of achievement in promoting choral music. The Calgary Herald 
hastens to the support of the Choir editorially when the organization 
had been refused the use of the A1 Azhar Temple by an edict of the City 
Council. In the interests of safety the use of. this hall had been 
prohibited for large gatherings. Under the heading ”The Loss of An 
Asset” the editorial says in part, 

15 One of the chief assets of a city is a good 

musical organization. —»- Calgary has such an 

asset and it is worthy of fullest sympathy and supp¬ 
ort. The best executive ability has been manifested 
in the organization and maintenance of the Apollo 
Choir, and the work executed has always been of the 
highest quality and worthy of an older city* In a 
few years Calgary may be known far and wide for its 
Apollo Choir. - Even the temporary disbanding of

the Apollo Choir will be a great lose, only to be 
measured in the currency of ideals and public culture 
rather than dollars and cents, 

In a more general way the same attitude is In evidence in the 
following statement from the local press: 

"Everybody in the West has been so busy with the 
development of the country and their own interests dur¬ 
ing the last few years that the musical and artistic 
aide of our life has been to a very large extent neg¬ 
lected, But now that our western centres are beginn¬ 
ing to take on the air of real cities and are regularly 
supplied with first class dramatic productions there 
seems no reason why they should not also put to good 
advantage the splendid amateur musical talent which is 

( 2 ) 

particularly lying dormant except in a few instances," v ' 

In advocating a civic musical organization for Calgary, this state¬ 
ment proceeds to draw attention to the contributions that similar organ¬ 
izations have made to the growth and renown of the cities they repre¬ 
sented, 

"Look what the Mendelssohn Choir has done for 
Toronto, It is without doubt the finest aggregation 
of voices on this continent and thousands flock to hear 
it when it accepts engagements in the United States 
cities. Boston’s Symphony orchestra has been the means 
of assisting that city to gain its present reputation 
as a centre of culture and refinement. The Minneapolis

Symphony has done the same for that city. 1 '^^ 

There seemed to be a willingness to admit that the Apollo Choir 
did work of a standard worthy of a civic organization which would bring 
recognition to Calgary. Yet it would seem that a civic symphony orch¬ 
estra is the more desirable organization to encourage for this purpose. 
The reason for this may be attributed to the more highly specialized 
skill demanded of an instrumentalist in an orchestra than of a vocalist 
in a large choral group. This preference is implied in the following 
statement made by a local musical critic at that time. 

“Just as there is no higher form of music than the 
wholly perfect symphony form, no more potent factor for 
the uplifting of the standard of music can be imagined 
than the symphony orchestra, nor can its value as an 
educational force be over estimated or indeed realized. 

The tremendous change for the better in the musical 
taste in all countries within the last two decades (for 
it is only music which is truly international) must be 
in great measure ascribed to the work of the symphony 
orchestra. 

From references in newspaper files, it would seem that orchestras 
were organized during the early days of Calgary's history. Only a 
passing mention is made of them, as for example the following of 
January 1884: 

15 On Friday evening a committee of civilians enter¬ 
tained the non-commissioned officers and constables of 
the police force to a ball in the Opera House. —-- 

(1) Ibid. 

(2) "Musical Notes 1 ' by Caeglas. The Calgary Herald, April 2 6 , 

1915. 















- 91 - 


The music was supplied by the Calgary Amateur 

Orchestra Society under the leadership of Mr, Ao 

McNeil, while George A, Winten presided at the piano. 

In spite of the air of permanency that the name implies, this 

society is not mentioned in any later musical activities. Its leader’s 

position in the town's business life is divulged in an advertisement 

appearing a few days later, 

"Coal - best in the city. Order from A. McNeil 

at the yard, opposite C,P.R, station or at the office 

( 2 ) 

of the Bow River Mills," 

Later, mention is made of a North West Mounted Police orchestra 
appearing before a Calgary audience at the Presbyterian Church Concert 

O) 

held in Boynton Hall on December 17, 1886,, The existence of this 
police orchestra seems to have been eclipsed by the work of a police 
band. Numerous references are encountered to the latter organization 
as in the case of its performance at the Firemen's Ball on December 26, 
1889'. 

If -- The music, which was excellent was 

supplied by the Mounted Police Band under the lead- 

(4) 

ership of Staff-Sergeant Bagley. —— " 

In the early 90*s, the presentations of the Calgary Operatic Soc¬ 
iety required orchestral accompaniment. Such orchestras were trained 
by Professor A, C. Augade. "Johnny" Augade was a violinist trained at 

the Paris Conservatory of Music, He was a ready reader at sight,

houses came into existence* Theatres of both these types required 
orchestras which created a demand for instrumentalists that the local 
community could not provide. As a consequence many professional music¬ 
ians cams to the city and found ready employment in Calgary's theatres. 

The community spirit of many of the theatre managers was in evid¬ 
ence when they permitted their instrumentalists to aid local operatic 
and choral presentations with orchestral accompaniments. It was from 
these ranks that Mr. P. L. Newcombe recruited his orchestras to accomr- 
pany the Apollo Choir. During the 1910-11 season, such an instrumental 
organization assumed the title of “The Calgary Symphony Orchestra”• 

It was conducted by Mr. A. P. Howells, the manager of the local branch 
of the Gourlay Piano Compary and an official of the Apollo Choir. Mrs. 
Dudley Smith was its concertmistress* At the choir concert of Novem¬ 
ber 29, 1910, besides accompanying several choral numbers, the orchestra 
presented Schubert's “Unfinished Symphony", Edward Geman's "Henry VIII 
Dances" and Edward Elgar's "Pomp and Circumstance March No* 1." 

The Apollo Choir was responsible for arousing the desire among 
Calgary citizens for a symphony orchestra. This was accomplished in 
two ways. As a feature of the spring concerts of its fourth and fifth

seasons, the choir sponsored visits of the St. Paul Symphony Orchestra 
under the leadership of Mr. Walter H. Rothwell. Evening concerts and 
orchestral matinees were given on both occasions in the Sherman Rink. 

The programmes, besides presenting numbers by the orchestra and the 
choir, demonstrated the effectiveness of choral numbers with the accom¬ 
paniment of a symphony orchestra. 

As a consequence of these two visits to Calgary, the principal 
second violinist of the orchestra, Mr. Max Weil, became a resident of 
the city. In the fall of 1912 he gathered about him a group of instru¬ 
mentalists and formed a symphony orchestra. Again it fell to the Apollo 
Choir to introduce to the citizens the new Calgary Symphony in a concert 
of choral and orchestral numbers held in the Grand Theatre on January 
27, 1913o 

Mrs. Broder, writing in The Morning Albertan the next day, paid 
tribute to the Apollo Choir and its conductor for their efforts in the 
interest of a symphony orchestra for Calgary in the following paragraph. 

“Precedence upon the program and the courtesy due 
to a new organization render it not ungracious to give 
lfigh% af way ta th# Calgary Symphony orchestra when deal¬ 
ing with the concert of combined forces at the Sherman 
Grand last night. The Apollo Choir, Mr. P. L. Neweombe, 
conductor, evinced a broad mind and a progressive spirit 
when he decided to encourage the formation of an instru¬ 
mental society to supplement and enhance the merits of 
his chorus, and win its own triumphs in its own sphere. 

To him Calgary was indebted for the presence of its 
first visiting orchestra and to him should be accounted 
the praise of trying to promote a home orchestra which 
should be a glory to this city. A pennyworth of

initiative is worth a pound of musical platitudes and 
prosperous citizens would do well to provide a guarantee 
fund which, combined with a liberal policy and progress¬ 
ive program, would soon put the combined societies upon 
an impregnable basis# A large audience testified both 
to its power of enjoyment and its discrimination in the 
full measure of encouragement given last night* Expect¬ 
ation had been keen, fulfilment was even better. Mr* 

Max Weil and his enthusiastic: players more than made 
good." (l) 


That the successful debut of this new organization was a measure 
of Calgary’s musical progress was emphasised in The Calgary Herald’s 
editorial the following evening# It said: 

"From time to time these columns have recorded the 
progress of music in Calgary, and have chronicled the 
succeeding events that have marked the upward steps of 
this city in that respect. It is a pleasure today to 
set another notch farther up than any that went before# 

The performance of the Apollo Choir last night and 
particularly that of the Symphony Orchestra, was a cause 
of pride as well as delight to those who listened to 
them. Calgary has in its leaders and enthusiastic 
amateurs the best of an excellent musical future. 

"Tha Apollo Choir is known in this city. It has 
performed in other years and in recording last night's 
achievement there is nothing unexpected in the state¬ 
ment that it excelled its own record and gave promise

of even higher things to come. The choir itself will, 
however, not grudge the statement that the notable event 
of last evening was the appearance and performance of 
the Symphony Orchestra under Mr. Weil. Few cities of 
Calgary's size, few indeed anywhere can produce a cred¬ 
itable amateur orchestra. Last night gives ground for 
the hope that Calgary will before long hold a really 
distinguished position in this respect.^ 

From the spirit expressed in the above paragraphs by music critic 
and newspaper editor, it would seem that rarely had an organization 
created a more favourable impression on the occasion of a first appear¬ 
ance. The audience was as delighted as it was surprised. Hope was 
expressed that the orchestra would take its place as one of the perman¬ 
ent musical forces of the city. 

A step toward realization of this was made next day when a group 

of enthusiasts, men representative of the highest interests of city 

life, - social, intellectual and commercial, - met to talk over the 

future of such a society. Those present were Alfred Price, J. W. 

Davidson, E. J. Riley, P. L. Newcomb©, J. E. Williams, T. M. Fyshe, 

R. J. Lyd'iatt and Max Weil. As an outcome it was decided to call a 

representative gathering of citizens to a meeting in the Public Library 

on Saturday, February 1st, to discuss the matter thoroughly. 

There it was decided to feel the pulse of the public by appealing 

for financial aid through subscription lists, and by canvassing for 

guarantees. Within a week, 11800 had been guaranteed. A meeting of 

the guarantors decided it was advisable to proceed with the project. 

Mr. Max Weil was engaged as conductor and instructed to gather together

a force of competent musicians. This was on April 19o In another 
week's canvass $6000 was guaranteed with which amount the board felt 
itself in a very enviable position and quite confident and certain of 
its ground. The officers of the organization were elected with Col. 

J. S. Dennis, honorary president; Hon® Mr. Justice Walsh and J» W. 
Campbell, honorary vice-presidents; T. M. Fyshe, president; A. W. 
Pryce-Jones, vice-president; R. J. Lydiatt, secretary and D. J. Young, 
treasurer. All the available talent of the city was enlisted and cer¬ 
tain instrumentalists and instruments which were required in such an 
orchestra and which were lacking in the city were brought from outside 
musical centres. There were twelve imported musicians in the symphony 
which numbered fifty-five.^^ 

In organizing the Calgary Symphony Orchestra, the directors de¬ 
sired to make it a civic project, wide in its appeal and interest. For 
its success it had to reach all the people® It could not survive as 
the pastime of the few. Thus, in addition to plans for a series of 
evening concerts, provision was mad© for several cheap matinees for 
school children at which programmes, designed to appeal to youngsters, 
were to be presented. 

To further popularize the new organization, a women's auxiliary 
was formed. Under the leadership of Mrs. A. W. Pryce-Jonee as presi¬ 
dent, Mrs. G. West-Jones as vice-president and Mrs. Harold W. Riley as 
( 2 ) 

secretary-treasurer,' ' the interest of the women of the city was 
enlisted on behalf of the symphony. 

Much financial aid was needed. Expenses were high. Rehearsals 
cost from $150 to $200 each. One rehearsal was necessary every day

Herald, November 11, 1915*

for the first three weeks and three or four per week thereafter. Over 
the season of twenty-six weeks, the talent brought from outside points 
had to be paid 05 to $40 per week and the other professionals of the 
city were paid in proportion.^ The only source of revenue for the 
orchestra was the concerts, as the matinees were produced at a loss to 
enable every person in Calgary, however poor, to hear good music. 

The directors were ever concerned over the strengthening of the 

organization's financial position. The initial campaign of the spring 

of 1915 had raised $6000 in subscriptions and guarantees. At the time 

of the first concert, November 10, 1913, this had been increased to 

$8500. In order to assure the continuance of the organization the 

board estimated that at least $15,000 must be guaranteed and with this 

amount subscribed the guarantors would not be called upon for more than 

( 2 ) 

fifty or sixty percent of their guarantees. 

The first concert was presented before what was reported to be a 
large and appreciative audience. The programme consisted entirely of 
orchestral numbers, w/ with no assisting artist. Enthusiasm was high 
and spontaneous. Newspaper reports and editorials, and comments by 
critics and directors were loud in their praise of the performance and 
confident of the symphony's role in the future of the city. 

The Morning Albertan introduced its report on the symphony concert 
with the following paragraphs:

Western Standard, October 5, 1913* 

(2) "Orchestra at Last a Reality", The Calgary Herald, November 11, 1913*

"The group of local citizens who have been instru¬ 
mental in developing the symphony orchestra idea in Calgary 
have looked forward with eager expectation to the opening 
concert, but even the most optimistic of them could not 
possibly have anticipated the tremendous enthusiasm which 
marked the opening performance last evening. Busy men of 
the street who have given liberally of their time and money 
for months past to place Calgary in the vanguard among 
Western Canadian cities in the development of musical art 
must have felt amply repaid in witnessing the unbounded 
delight of the audience which just about taxed the capac¬ 
ity of the Sherman Grand Theatre# 

"It was surely an inspiration for the conductor and 
members of the orchestra to see the large and brilliant 
audience which filled every nook and corner of the large 
auditorium, even to the boxes and loges, and if this par¬ 
ticular performance is a specimen of what the symphony 
orchestra will mean to the life of the city we may all 
congratulate ourselves on the outset for the splendid 
body of professional players, individually and collect¬ 
ively, who acknowledge this city as their home, and for 
the intelligent and masterly direction of the conductor, 

Max Weil* It is an auspicious start for the conductor 
and board of directors* Its educational value cannot be 
measured; its ethical influence cannot be estimated* It 
was very appropriate that the orchestra itself should be 
the sole attraction on the opening night, and no assist¬ 
ing artist was either desirable or necessary to complete 
the evening 1 s enjoyment. The orchestra played with

authority which betokened confidence in themselves and 
their conductor and the results that have been produced 
with less than three weeks’ rehearsals justify the pre¬ 
diction that before the season is finished Calgary will 
be able to boast the possession of an orchestra compar¬ 
able to any organization of its size on the continent. 

"Mr. Weil used rare discretion in the selection of 
numbers for the initial concert and even the people who 
endeavoured to delude themselves into a belief that they 
cannot enjoy " 018881081 ” music were unrestrained in their 
enthusiasm tahile the dyed-in-the-wool music lovers put in 
an evening of unalloyed pleasure. — - -- 

The editorial appearing in The Calgary Herald emphasized the signi¬ 
ficance of the reception of the previous evening’s symphony programme 
as an indication of the city’s cultural progress. It said in part: 

"Calgary has had reason to feel proud of its commerc¬ 
ial progress, its fine buildings, its increasing bank 
clearings and its growing financial strength; but Calgary 
never had more reason for pride than when she found, as 
she did last night, that her people were true and loyal 
lovers of art, that high class orchestral music could 
draw a record audience, and that she had laid a founda¬ 
tion for an organization whose like is not to be found 
in Canada and which will we hope, take its place among 
the great orchestras of the continent. 

" -- and to Calgary and Alberta congratulations 

in a new departure which will mean much to the increase

of true refinement in the people and the musical 
education of its youth# 

Mr, A. W# Pryce-Jones, the vice-president of the symphony, was 
quoted in the press as being "surprised and impressed with the perform¬ 
ance" and added the following regarding the place of the orchestra in 
the life of the cityi 

"The promoters also deserve great credit for the 
success that has so far met their efforts, and as the 
foundation for one of the best orchestras in the Domin¬ 
ion had been firmly laid, he hoped and believed that the 
city would reap great benefit in more ways than one. 

Music was necessary in a large city like Calgary and 

went far to make the residents more contented and placed 

( 2 ) 

social life on a higher level." 

Mrs. Broder in an article "specially written for the Herald," 
discussed the influence of the Symphony not only upon the citizens of 
Calgary but upon the Dominion and beyond* As a preamble to a detailed 
criticism of the programme she wrote: 

"A bumper house in the Sherman Grand and a banner 
night for Calgary, crowned the efforts of the enthusiasts, 
musical and other, who had promoted a scheme which will 
redound to the honor of this city from coast to coast, 
over the border and across the Atlantic* Many audiences 
are politely called representative but this really was* 

Every profession and trade in Calgary sent of its best to 
swell the throng of music lovers, and testify to the

pleasing fact that the Symphony Orchestra is not for 
the few but for the many, not only an occasion of civic 
pride but a solid contribution to the national credit 
of Canada. Such an organization makes, as J. S. Dennis, 
hon. president, well, said - and no one knows the signs 
of the times better than he - a standing reminder to the 
whole Dominion that in its pleasures, as in its business 
aims the West is striving for the best and that nothing 
tut the best will do."*' 1 ' 

That other sections of the Dominion were conscious of the existence 
of the Calgary Symphony Orchestra and of the quality of its work as 
evidenced in its initial concert is noted by an article in The Canadian 
Courier of Toronto entitled “The Calgary Symphony* 1 by Carlton McNaught 
It says in parts 

“If it be true, as a recent writer on musicfel topics 
says, that no city can pretend to be a leading musical 
centre till it maintains a regularly supported symphony 
orchestra, then Calgary, the first city of Alberta, is 
determined to begin well# For this ambitious little 
western metropolis is now the only city in Canada outside 
Toronto which supports a professional symphony orchestra. 

“The orchestra was organized this season, and is giv¬ 
ing a series of ten concerts, with the backing of leading 
citizens. Its musical success is in the hands of Mr. Max

Weil, conductor, formerly connected with musical 
organizations in Minneapolis and Halifax, but now for 
a year a resident of Calgary. The orchestra has a 
complement of fifty-five musicians. All, however, are 
professionals, and for the most part artists who have 
reached a high degree of proficiency in their special 
lines. The orchestra is in no sense amateur. 

"This was fully demonstrated at the first concert 
held on November 10th--." 

The article proceeds to comment upon the numbers performed at the 
first concert and to outline the history of its organization* It con¬ 
cludes with the following sentence, 

"This is the history of the Calgary Symphony 
Orchestra, for long a dream of a few music lovers in 
Alberta*s largest city, now an established fact, the 
second symphony orchestra in the Dominion, and the 
only one in the West." 

From the foregoing quotations it would seem that the orchestra was 
given a reception that proved the citizens of Calgary to be "true and 
loyal lover8 of art" and fully aware of the fact that this civic project 
was a means of social refinement and contentment for themselves and of 
educational and ethical value for their young people* 

A unique feature of the Calgary orchestra, one which was an innova¬ 
tion as far as symphonies in Canada were concerned, was its children*s 
matinees* These concerts were''planned with the musical interests and 
financial abilities of a younger audience in mind* Programmes were of 
duration and variety to sustain attention* Special arrangements were 
made with the School Board permitting an early dismissal of classes* 






















- 105 - 


Concessions by theatre owner and management, and by the Symphony 
directors enabled the fixing of the admission at fifteen cents. 

The first children's matinee was held at 5.50 on November 25th, 
1915. The programme presented was typical of subsequent ones/ 1 ^ It 
included numbers by the orchestra and special solo features. The latter 
on this occasion included harp solos by Miss Eva Bohmbach, - her initial 
appearance with the orchestra - and vocal solos by Miss Zelie Delearte, 
now of Edmonton. 

The press notice on the following day was most complimentary, 
especially to the audience of children. 

"The directors of the Calgary Symphony Orchestra 
struck a responsive chord in the hearts of the school 
children of the city when they introduced the young 
people'8 matinee as a part of the scheme for developing 
the orchestra idea in Calgary and the young people gave 
tangible appreciation of the movement on the occasion 
of the first matinee which was held in the Sherman 
Grand yesterday afternoon. ---

"No conductor could have wished for better attention 
or more sincere appreciation than the little ones extended 
to Mr. Weil and his players, and the carefully chosen pro¬ 
gram was just the right length to maintain the interest to 
the end, there being no evidence of fatigue among the 

children at the conclusion of the performance. - 

"The orchestra mustered its full strength, through 
the courtesy of the managers of the various theatres who 
kindly relieved the symphony players for the afternoon. 

-- Moreover, the complete orchestra showed an improve¬ 
ment over their first appearance, the intervening*rehears¬ 
als contributing to the perfection in ensemble work. 

During the season which lasted until the end of March, the symphony 

( 2 ) 

orchestra presented seven evening concerts' 'and three children's mat- 

(3) 

inees. / At the majority of the former special artists were featured 
with the orchestra. Among these were Mr. George Harris, tenor, of 
Toronto; Miss Marie Oaslova, violinist; Mme. Cornelia Rider-Possart, 
pianist, and Mr. Rowland Leach, the concertmaster of the orchestra. 

At the matinees local artists were presented. These included, besides 
those previously mentioned. Miss Lillian Wilson, soprano. Miss Pert 
Windle, contralto, and Mrs. Florence Blake-Mahoney, soprano. 

On January 15th, 1914, after its third evening concert, the orch¬ 
estra travelled to Edmonton to present a symphony programme. It gave 
two concerts in the capital city and its members were entertained at 
Government House by Lieutenant-Governor Bulyea.

At this tine, particularly after the Edmonton visit, a feeling was 
apparent in the press notices and editorials that the programmes were 
becoming too heavy and were lacking in popular appeal* Calgarians were 
not supporting their orchestra through capacity audiences. 

The press report on the orchestra's third concert held on January 
12th had the following to say about the type of programme* 

"Perhaps the programme as a whole might be criticized 
on the score of being somewhat over the heads of the aver¬ 
age audience. With the exception of the Peer Gynt Suite, 
there was nothing on the programme which a popular audience 

r 

could be expected to have been familiar with* While last 
night's audience showed an intelligent appreciation of the 
technical skill of the orchestra, which some of the numbers 
admirably displayed, it was evident that something of a 
more familiar, if not less classical nature would have been 
more satisfying to them* After all, there is a great range 
of good music which has a popular as well as an esoteric 
appeal end which offers scope for the skill of the best of 
orchestras* One imagines that more of this type of music 
would have been welcomed by the audience at last night's 
concert. Mr* Weil's former programmes could not have been 
found fault with on this score, and it is hoped that we 
will be favoured with more of the music of the type re- 
ferred to at succeeding concerts. v ' 

A few weeks later, prior to the orchestra's fourth concert, Mrs. 

Broder wrote an article questioning the possibility of such a programme 

that could bedescribed as popular and coming to the defence of Mr.

Weil*a programme policy* Under the title "Microscope ia Applied to 

'Popular* Programs"^ ^ she wrote: 

"Paradoxical as this title may appear in Calgary - for 
the man is not yet living who could produce one - the popu¬ 
lar program is as alluring as it is elusive,* it is the blue 
rose in the fable, the shy bird that is still in the bush. 

Shifting sands cannot provide a soil in which it would 
flourish, inconsequent appeals cannot persuade it to stay 
its flight. If perchance in some golden hour it burst into 
flower, or as suddenly alighted, few would recognize it till 
it was gone; meanwhile in grey days and hard times nothing 
is so painfully easy as to cavil and carp and if possible 
wantonly destroy the first fair promise of budding enter¬ 
prise. It is always easier to prevent than to promote. 

" —- Reams could be written about it (the popu¬ 

lar program); but no better working model could be suggest¬ 
ed than that followed by the conductor of the Calgary 
orchestra, proceeding from the simpler to the more complex 
symphonic forms, contrasting the older and better known 
overtures and suites with those more modern, novel and 
impassioned and romantic; courtly minuets with the charac¬ 
teristic dances of emotional people. ——. 

"Possibly Mr. Max Weil may offer to put on a universally 

popular program. Meantime the general public cannot do 

better than enjoy the one provided for next Monday night." 

The next day after the orchestra's visit to Edmonton, an editorial 

( 2 ) 

entitled "A Pertinent Question" 'emphasized the value of the orchestra

to Galgary and deplored the growing apathy of the citizens toward their 
musical organization. 

”The trip of Calgary^ Symphony orchestra to Edmonton 
yesterday was a fine bit of advertising for this city and a 
good stroke of business for the orchestra management. Two 
concerts were given and at each the auditorium, seating poss¬ 
ibly 2000 people, was filled. The players excelled themselves 
and the Edmonton people were thoroughly enthusiastic. 

''Considering the oi&come of this Edmonton trip The Herald 
wonders if those Calgarians who should be first in the effort 
to maintain this high class musical organization are doing all 
that might reasonably be expected of them. The attendance at 
the last concert given locally does not indicate that they 
are. Can it be that the people of Edmonton have a higher 
appreciation of artistic value than we have ourselves?” 

The comments of the press upon the fourth evening concert held on 
February 1 6 , 1914 were more complimentary to the or chestra 1 a choice of 
programme and to the attitude and size of the audience. The Herald of 
the following day reported in part! 

"Calgary music lovers were given another feast of 
good things last evening and went away from the Sherman 
Grand feeling that if Calgary were to lose its Symphony 
orchestra much that makes for the finer spirit in our 
civic life would be taken from us. With each succeeding 
concert the Symphony is demonstrating more undeniably its 
claim to a permanent place among our civic institutions. 

Only the man who holds that it is the material things 
alone that make a city great would think of withholding, 
his support from such a splendid organization. ——-

“Conductor Weil and the orchestra board may be congrat¬ 
ulated on the success of the fifth concert* The audience 
was encouragingly large, and last night's concert showed 
that the orchestra is d eserving of even greater patronage 
than it has yet received* It is something of which we can 
not be proud, but which we can enjoy. 


To complete the orchestral season, the sixth and seventh concerts 
were presented on successive nights, March 23rd and 24th* On the sugg¬ 
estion of the Conductor, the Board of Directors decided to give a popu¬ 
lar request programme on the second of these evenings* The various 
numbers were selected by a plebiscite taken at the fifth concert on 
March 9th. On that occasion there was inserted in the programme a 
ballot listing the compositions played by the orchestra to that date* 

The patrons were requested to indicate one favorite in each group, - 
symphonies, suites, overtures, marches, string orchestra and miscellan¬ 
eous “A" and “B“ - and to deposit the ballot in a box at the exit. 

Just how much of the final programme of the Calgary Symphony 
Orchestra under Mr. Max Weil reflected the selection made in the pleb¬ 
iscite is not known. It was an attempt to meet a demand for popular 
programmes and to answer a criticism of its programme policy. From 
the press it brought forth the following remarks: 

“ --♦ Altogether, last evening's concert was one 

to be remembered for many days both as a splendid feast 

of the beat class of familiar music, and as an evidence 

of an achievement in Calgary's history - the successful 

( 2 ) 

first season of a real symphony orchestra."

The experiment with a permanent musical organization for the city 
of Calgary seemed to be most encouraging. From a musical standpoint, 
those who recall the 1913-14 symphony season,^speak highly of the 
standards achieved by the orchestra and of the cultural enjoyment 
afforded the citizens. A newspaper resume of the orchestral season 
concludes with the following paragraphs emphasizing the significance 
of the symphony in the development of Calgary: 

"Taking duly into consideration these two functions of 
the symphony orchestra (l. entertainment, 2. education), one 
cannot help feeling very deeply that if the orchestra were 
allowed to lapse for want of interest or support, the city 
would be losing a great deal. The cause of music would 
suffer a severe blow, and we would be deprived of one of 
our greatest agencies for the promotion of real culture. 

"This is to speak of the purely intrinsic value of the 

orchestra. It has also a very great value to Calgary, of 

course, as an advertising feature. Calgary has received a 

great deal of favorable publicity by reason of its symphony 

orchestra. This city enjoys the distinction of being the 

only city in Canada besides Toronto that has a real symphony 

orchestra. The advertising that the city gets from the 

orchestra’s presence is not to be disregarded, and from this 

standpoint alone the city council would be well justified 

in making a grant to the orchestra board. With such a civic 

grant and with the continued support of all lovers of music, 

be they amateurs or past masters, let us hope that the 

orchestra will continue to exist, not only to exist, but to

grow steadily and surely in coherence and artistic 
efficiency.^ ^ 

Such pious hopes for the future of the Symphony in Calgary were 
not to be realized# Several factors determined its demise and post¬ 
poned its revival for fourteen years# 

There is little doubt that financially the first season had not 
been altogether a success. It had been necessary to call upon the 
guarantors to make up the deficit. The suggestion of a civic grant 
for the orchestra seems not to have been openly acted upon as a means 
of relief. Neither the failure of city council to encourage this 
movement in a tangible way nor the fear of further demands upon guar¬ 
antors would have precluded a second season, had it not been for local 
and national events which intervened. 

In May 1914, the "Dingman Discovery" well was brought into pro¬ 
duction in Turner Valley. This set off the first of the great oil 
booms which have shaken the economic, social and cultural life of 
Calgary# All phases of civic activity were in a state of suspense 
pending the outcome of other drilling ventures in the field which 
might make the citizens "oil kings" over night# It was this state 
of affairs that prompted the music editor of the Canadian Courier to 
write under the caption, "No Oi^, No Symphony Orchestra": 

"If you go to Calgary now you will find very little 
organized enthusiasm about Conductor Max V/eil and his 

i 

band. They have struck oil in the foot-hills and until 
the cobolds down in the rivers of oil can decide that 
there is to be a general chorus of oil, nobody can tell 
what is to become of the Calgary Symphony. One level¬ 
headed guarantor of the orchestra put it tersely a few

days ago when he said to one of the judges at the 
Alberta festival: 

"'Well, it's just like this - if we strike oil the 
way we hope to, we'll have the best orchestra in Calgary 
that you can find in Canada, bar none. If we don't 
strike oil, there'll be no orchestra. It's either one 
thing or the other.' 

"Conductor Weil naturally is praying for oiL. With 
half a dozen miniature John D. Rockerfellers behind his 
orchestra, there will be nothing to prevent him from 
having what one westerner technically termed 'a damned 
good orchestra* next year."^ 

Mr. Weil's prayers were not answered. Oil in the expected quan¬ 
tities at the relatively shallow depths was not available and the boom 
collapsed in the face of the national crisis. 

On August 4, 1914, Canada found herself at war when Great Britain 
made her declaration against Germany. War-fever ran high. Interest 
in such cultural activities as symphony orchestras lapsed. The oppor¬ 
tunity for a second symphony season in Calgary slipped by with the 
decline of organised enthusiasm for such a society. Later in the 
year, Mr. Max Weil, a German by birth, left the country. 

"The progress of the Calgary Symphony Orchestra 

for one brief, almost giddy season of splendid programmes, 

has been quite the most brilliant orchestral outburst in 
( 2 ) 

Canada," ' 

(l) "No Oil, No Symphony Orchestra" by The Music Editor, The Canadian 
Courier, June 20, 1914.

CHAPTER IX. 


BAND MUSIC IN CALGARY . 

There are very few villages, towns or cities that cannot boast 
of possessing a "town band" at some stage of their development* Such 
an organization is a common feature in civic growth* It meets many 
needs and serves numerous purposes. A band arouses the spirit of the 
citizens on special and gala occasions* It expresses civic enthusiasm 
when visits of distinguished persons from distant places necessitate 
formal receptions* Its martial notes and stirring rhythms appeal to 
all, young and old, irrespective of musical training or musical 
appreciation. 

The town band attracts a more generous and more general support 
than other musical groups* The municipal authority itself, or frater¬ 
nal organizations, or business enterprises may instigate and nurture 
its growth. Because of its wide appeal, it attracts those elements 
in the male population who consider choir or symphony membership incon¬ 
gruous with their masculine dignity* The motives prompting such an 
organization may range from the satisfaction of civic pride, from the 
fostering of fraternal ceremonial pomp to the modern conception of it 
being a means of combatting juvenile delinquency. 

Early in its history, Calgary possessed a town band* Records 
indicate that the first mayor was interested in the band*s organization 
and that the Oddfellows* Lodge may have played an important part in its 
existence• 

George Murdock, the town* s first chief magistrate, fortunately 
kept a diary. Under the date December 12, 1885, he noted, 

"Beautiful sunset. Meteors shot from northeast to 

southwest, clear blue and russet, like a Roman candle in

half-a-dozen pieces* Bagpipes playing on the hill* 11 
Thus is recorded the existence in the frontier town of musical instru¬ 
ments suitable for outdoor use. 

Later, on June 14, 1885, Mr. Murdock reported that “the instruments 
arrived for the band 1 ’ and on the following night, a fine summer one, 
the bandsmen met for the first time “and played a march in public”. 

The weekly paper give3 a more detailed account of this occasion. 
Under the heading "Calgary Brass Band” it reported as follows, 

"The instruments for the use of the town band arrived 
from Hamilton, Ont. on Sunday. They include a cornet, 
trombone, base(bass) and snare drums. As there are two 
additional cornets in town the strength of the band is 
brought up to six pieces. The members had their first 

( 2 ) 

practice on Monday night under Mr. Millward's leadership.” 

The musical ability of Mr. J. H. Millward was recognized in a 
comment appearing in the press on March 19, 1884.^^ Now a year later 
he had become a prominent townsman. His occupation was that of painter 
and decorator. He had been elected to the town’s first council and 
held high office in the Oddfellows’ Lodge. These dual interests of 
its leader may account for ths band being known as "The Calgary Brass 
Band" and again as "The Oddfellows’ Band". Mr. Millward was later to 
be among Calgary’s first aldermen when the town was incorporated as a 
city in 1894. 

A week later, further comment upon the band’s progress and the 
interest it arroused, is noted.

"The Calgary Herald Brass Band is making notice¬ 
able progress. As they parade the streets these summer 
evenings under the able leadership of Mr, Milliard and 
the enthusiastic attendance of notable Indian visitors 
and Spencer Douglas^ (2)d isciples, no patriotic citizen 
refuses to put his loyal head out of his window and shake 
his fist approvingly. Great things are expected of the 
band when the troops return, and they do well to practise.^ 
July 1885, witnessed official appearances of the band on two occ 

sions, first at the Dominion Day sports and later, on the 18th at the 

welcome extended to "the Scouts" returning from the Riel Rebellion. 

Of the first of these, the press report said, 

"The Calgary Band performed in public here for the 
first time, and is to be congratulated on its performance 
which was excessively good considering the short time it 

( 4 ) 

has been in existence." ' 

On this occasion a subscription was taken in aid of the band. The 

report concluded by stating that, 

"The fund raised by Messrs. McLeod end Ogburn amounted 
to and was presented to the band forthwith. Considering 
the excellent work the band did on the two days named the 

( 5 ) 

presentation was well deserved." 

(1) This must be a printer^ error. The band was never known by thi 
name.

A week later the bend received two new cornets and a piccoio 0 
New music also arrived. These were welcome additions to the organiza¬ 
tion for the second of its official appearances. The press comment 
was as follows, 

"The preparations for the reception had been going 
on for several days, Mr. Millward's band had got two 
new cornets and an armful of music and the rink resounded 
during hours of heat and cool to the soul-stirring strains 
of 'The Girl Dressed Up in Green 1 and 'The Harm I Can't 
Explain.'"^ 

The same issue of the local paper announced that Mr. Millward, 
whose "untiring efforts to bring the band up to its present state of 
efficiency" was retiring from the leadership and that his place was 
being taken by Mr® W. Scollen. 

The band's outstanding appearance each year was at the Dominion 
Day sports. This was a two-day event, extending over July 1st and 2nd. 
The services of the band were required for both days. It was also 
called upon to welcome distinguished visitors and to honor citizens 
who were leaving the town. An issue of the Herald of July 1886 re¬ 
ported that the band accompanied Spencer Douglas, the local teacher 
and himself a bandsman, to the station when he left for his vacation 
at the Pacific coast. 

In 1890, the Fire Brigade Band was organized to replace the Odd- 

( 2 ) 

fellows' or Calgary Brass Band. This group brought much honor to 
Calgary as a town and was a credit to Calgary as a city.^' 

On September 50, 1890 a concert was held under the auspices of the

Fire Brigade Band. The event had been announced aa 

■i -- one 0 f ^e choicest entertainments of the 

season and should be patronized with the utmost liber¬ 
ality* The brigade band is always ready to turn out 
for the public at a moment 1 s notice and as our citizens 
are aware, they are at considerable expense to perfect 
themselves and to render the band creditable as a mus¬ 
ical organization of the town* A band master has to be 
provided, new music must be procured and other expenses 
incurred. All this means a good deal of money paid out 
in the course of the year, to say nothing of the large 
amount of time devoted by the members to practise* The 
citizens appreciate the sacrifices which are being made 
and will no doubt turn out en masse to the concert. 

The concert was described the next day as 

" —— a great success. Calgary is noted for giv¬ 
ing hearty support to a good cause, and the hall, though 
not crowded, was comfortably filled by an audience fairly 
representative of the culture and intelligence of the 
town." 

The band was under the leadership of a Mri H. F. Standhsft who had 
recently arrived to fill the position. The press reported his appoint¬ 
ment by the Brigade in the following paragraph and implied that, even 
in those pioneer days, a conductor's "life was not a happy one". 

"There is a difficulty between Professor Black, the 
new leader of the Fire Brigade band and the other members* 

The Professor has received a month's notice but claims

aix months’ pay# It is understood that Professor 
Standaft, of Strathroy, Ont#, l4 years a bandmaster 
in the 52nd Regiment, has been engaged and is on his 
way here. Professor Standaft is said to be one of 
the most accomplished musical instructors in Canada 
and a conposer of merit."^ X/ 

( 2 ) 

He is reputed to have been a leader of the real German-band type and 

certainly proved his musical versatility by contributing violin and 

clarinet solos to that initial programme. Tribute was paid to Mr. E. 

R. Rogers, "the efficient chief of the fire department to whose ener- 

(5) 

getic efforts much of the success of the entertainment is due, ''for 
his singing of "Rocked in the Cradle of the Deep” to band accompani¬ 
ment. Mrs. Jo R. Costigan al9o contributed vocal solos, while Mrs. 

J. H. Millward was the accompanist for the evening. 

The band was complimented for, and encouraged to continue, its 
street performance by the local press in the following statement. 

"The serenade, given on the street before the 
concert, was greeted with pleasure by many who had for 
some time felt and expressed a desire that the band 
should make itself heard and seen more oftener in simi¬ 
lar performances. We hope now that they have shown 
their capabilities, that we shall often hear them in 
the open air. The practice will do them good, and Cal¬ 
gary will soon come to take pride in her musicians, which 

(4) 

cannot fail to prove of great value in the future;. '

Calgary did "come to take pride in her musicians" as the events 
of 1901 showed. 

By this date, Mr. Crispin Smith was the leader of the Fire Brigade 
band. He came to this position as the result of a very spectacular 
occurrence. Mr. Smith, a lawyer by profession, had spent about three 
weeks in detention for contempt of court. He had refused to submit 
certain financial documents as evidence in a case of misappropriation 
of funds which he was defending. Upon his release he was met and 
escorted up town by the Fire Brigade band.^^ As a consequence he be¬ 
came bandmaster on July 25, 1900, as recorded in the press at that tine. 

"At a meeting of the Fire Brigade last, night 
Crispin Smith was elected leader of the reorganized 
band which will meet for its first practice on Thurs¬ 
day night. —-Mr. Smith, we understand, has had 

experience as a band master in England and with his 
well known musical abilities and the abundance of mat¬ 
erial he has to work on he should succeed, with the 
co-operation of all the members of this old time 

organization, in making a band that will do credit to 

( 2 ) 

the city of Calgary." 

Crispin Smith was equally at home in various fields of musical 
entertainment - as a vocalist at concerts and "smokers", as an actor 
in light opera, as a conductor of a minstrel troupe or as a director 
of local amateurs in a musical production. To such enterprises he 
gave his services willingly. From 1901 to 1912 he dispensed justice

to the city as police magistrate.^^ 

Under his leadership, Crispin Smith brought the Fire Brigade band 

to a high state of efficiency for the tv?o major events of the year 

1901, namely the band championship and the visit of the Duke and 

( 2 ) 

Duchess of York. 

For many years it was the custom of the Fire Department to spon¬ 
sor a sports programme as the annual civic celebration of May 24th. 
Special trains brought contestants and spectators into town* The 
events of the day started with a grand parade and to this, towns were 
invited to send their bands. In 1901, a band competition was intro¬ 
duced into the programme and Sergeant-Major Harry Walker of Regina 
acted as judge. 

Sergeant-Major Walker was a bandsman of note. 

"Sergeant-Major Harry Walker, who acted as judge in 
the band competition, has grown to be a landmark of west¬ 
ern military life. He wears three clasps, one for the 
Fenian Raids, one for the Red River Rebellion and the last 
for the Saskatchewan campaign of ’85* He organized the 
first military band west of Lake Superior and in the old 
days at Fort Garry many an old timer has a happy recoll¬ 
ection of military dances at which Sergeant Walker's band 
furnished the music. Sergeant Walker is also a composer 
of no mean order. His waltz "The Riders of the Plains" 
is well known and from it and other compositions he gets 
a fair royalty. When Dan Godfrey, the famous bandsman 
was in the West a couple of years ago he stated that 
Sergeant Walker was one of the most efficient bandmasters

(2) King George V. and Queen Mary.

he had ever met in the course of a long and varied 
experience* The North West Mdunted Police may indeed 
consider themselves lucky in possessing his services.^ 

Here was the pioneer counterpart of the modern festival adjudicator I 
Competing bands came from Medicine Hat, Edmonton and Canmore. 
Sergeant Walker awarded the prize to the Calgary Fire Brigade with the 
Canmore Band running a close second* The report in the newspaper of 
this success was written in a facetious veins 

11 -• The victory was popular and the crowd that

mony heartily cheered the decision* There were chivalrous 
people who said they almost regretted the home candidates 
had won because it looked selfish for the home lot to win 
things when visiters have been having a try* On the other 
hand prejudice against the home entrants simply because 
they do belong to you is absurd. The Calgary boys worked 
hard to win and they were not up against duffers in the 
music jerking business. If the judge ie a racing man no 
doubt he would estimate Calgary winners by a short neck*

word technique) and in the evening the opera house aud-

ience metaphorically jumped on the band for an encore.” 

During the summer of 1901 and as a result of the efforts of Chief 
,l Cappy ,, Smart and Bandmaster Smith, a band stand was erected in the 
C.P.R. Park.^^ This area was situated west of the depot. Here the

Brigade band presented its open air summer concerts* When the build¬ 
ing of the Palliser Hotel required this site, the stand was moved to 
Mewata Park where it remained in solitary neglect north of the 3tadium 
behind the Municipal Swimming Pool until it was demolished in 1959 
when the park was used to accommodate military huts* 

On September 28, 1901, the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York 
visited Calgary* The services of the Brigade band were requisitioned 
for the occasion and the "city fathers urged Calgarians to be particu¬ 
larly careful about fire hazards, so the civic firemen^ band could 
play for the Royal visitors without interference."^' The day* s cele¬ 
brations were concluded by a concert given in the opera house under 
the auspices of the Fire Brigade band* The local group was assisted 
by the North West Mounted Police Band and Orchestra from Regina con¬ 
ducted by Sergeant-Major Walker. "The audience was very largely comr- 
prised of visitors to the city, from whom numerous compliments were 
heard upon the high state of efficiency to which the Calgary band had 

been brought. No less then 50 players took part in the selections on 

( 2 ) 

Saturday night and each number was vigorously encored." v ' 

This early notable pioneer band, though sponsored by the Fire 
Brigade and drawing the core of it9 members from that civic department, 
included on its roster some of the city&s leading citizens, such as 
Dr. George McDonald, Prof. A* Augade, Mr. Neil MeKelvie, Dr. 0. E. 

f 2 \ 

Lyman, Mr. E. J. Young and Mr. George Tempest. ' 

The Fire Brigade band gradually disintegrated after 1902. A picture 
dated September 1st of that year was described by Mr. H. B. Wilson,

the band's secretary, as taken on one of the last parades of the organ¬ 
ization# A smell band continued to exist for many years using the old 
name# Judging from a picture dated 1906, its membership was no longer 
drawn from the men of the brigade but from the young instrumentalists 
of the city. The Fire Department had become the sponsor of the smaller 
band. 

Its decline in size and importance may have been due to the eleva¬ 
tion of its leader, Mr. Crispin Smith, to the position of police 
magistrate which necessitated his resignation. Another factor may have 
been the organization of the 15th Light Horse Regimental band under 
Major Fred A. Bagley. 

In the 1890's, Mr. Bagley, a former sergeant-major with the North 
West Mounted Police, had conducted the Calgary Citizens' Band. In 1901 
he secured his commission and proceeded to South Africa as a captain 
with the Canadian forces. Upon his return he formed the Light Horse 
band made up of musicians drawn from his old Citizens 1 band and equipped 
by purchasing the stores of the Fire Brigade band. This new organiz¬ 
ation proved a credit to the city, contributing much in the way of 
publicity to Calgary. 

It was enabled to do this by a tour of Eastern Canada and of the 
British Isles during the summer of 1907, fulfilling a two weeks' 
engagement at the Dublin International Exposition. 

The band was brought up to a strength of forty-five instrumental¬ 
ists, the majority of whom were from Calgary. A few soloists were 
brought in from the Pacific Coast. All the members purchased new 
instruments in anticipation of the trip/ 1; The initial expenses of 
the tour were raised locally through open-air concerts in Central Park 
and through programmes presented in the Lyric Theatre.

The band received official recognition from the Department of 
Militia a few weeks before its departure. It had only existed as the 
15th Light Horse Regimental Band upon the understending that it should 
be self-supporting and no expense to the department. It was not the 
custom in this country to have bands in connection with cavalry regi¬ 
ments. But according to instructions received from Ottawa for the 
attendance of the regiment as guard of honor for His Imperial Highness, 
Prince Fushimi of Japan during his visit to Calgary on June 18, 1907, 
the orders included the band. ^ 7 Thus it received the official recog¬ 
nition enabling it to travel as a Canadian regimental band. 

The personnel of the touring band included a number of Calgary's 
leading citizens, some of whom are still living. The commending 
officer of the regiment. Colonel James Walker, of North West Mounted 
Police fame, accompanied the band. The business manager was Mr. Robert 
Mackay, who for years was the superintendent of the City Ele ctric Light 
Department. Mr. 3. L. Saunders, a former North West Mounted Police 
officer and a member of the Fire Brigade band, was the assistant con¬ 
ductor. In the brass section playing cornet was Mr. J. A. Foss, local 
leathe-rcraft manufacturer, while among the clarinet players were Mr. 

H. L. Flumerfelt, well-known men 1 s clothing merchant,, and Dr. 0. A. 

Lyman, dentist. Mr. Bruce Cameron of the Herald's editorial staff was 

. .. ( 2 ) 

press representative. 

Mr. James Farrell was the band's advance agent. He left early in 
May to arrange concert engagements in the East and in the Bri tish Isles.

His failure to adequately fulfil his duties almost resulted in the 

cancellation o f the tour shortly after it had got under way.^^ 

In making the trip, the 15th Light Horse was the first Canadian 

( 2 ) 

regimental hand to tour the British Isles. It was usual for British 
hands to visit Canada. The band left Calgary on July 1, and played a 
five-day engagement in Winnipeg. Stop-overs were made at Fort William, 
Ottawa and Montreal for the presentation of programmes. After playing 
in Quebec City, the hand embarked on the Empress of Britain for Liver¬ 
pool on July 26. From here it went to Dublin for two weeks, from 
August 12 to 24, where it made alternating appearances with the famous 
Coldstream Guards* Band. Later it played in the “White City", Man¬ 
chester. 

Press clippings dealing with these appearances indicated a warm 
reception for the players and a generous approval of their work. The 
band was reported to have “sprung quite a surprise on the music loving 
enthusiasts of Ottawa”. The critic went on to say that, 

"While not quite up to the best military bands of 
the old country, which have been heard here, it ia only 

in the smaller details of technique. —*- 

“Fred A Bagley, the conductor, was heartily congrat¬ 
ulated on having under his baton such a well assorted 
array of mueicians who should make a name for themselves 
and the great northwest of Canada. 

As a result of the band*s performance in Montreal the following 
interesting comment was made by the complacent east.

"When musicians heard that a band from the plains 
of the west was to essay Wagner, Gounod and Rossini in 
this city, which has heard rnoet of the great organizations 
of the day attempt the task, they shook their heads and 
anticipated the worst. But the 15th Light Horse band did 
not murder the works of the great masters. They played 
them with great intelligence and though the result was not 
always perfection, one appreciated the honest efforts that 
were made, for they gave promise of greater things when 
the organization has greater concert experience. It really 
is a band to advertise western Canada, and it will doubt¬ 
less succeed admirably in that direction.^ 

The comments from Quebec emphasized the significance of the tour 
in the interests of the Dominion. 

"Canada has for a number of years been receiving 
visits from some of the finest military bands of the 
Motherland, and now the young but vigorous end progress¬ 
ive Dominion is about to return the compliment. - 

Prior to sailing the band gave a concert at the Drill 
Hall last evening which was at the same time an intro¬ 
duction and a farewell - an introduction to the people 
of the ancient capital of the splendid capabilities of 
this corps of musicians from the plains of the boundless 
west, and a farewell to the Dominion before seeking that 
endorsation from the Motherland which their abilities 30 

C 2 N 

richly deserve." y

Under the headlines of "Our Band Captured the Irish" and "Col. 
Walker and Capt. Bagley Carried on Shoulders of Cheering Spectators - 
Most Popular Band at Fair" the local press reported from the Irish 
Times the impression left by the Calgary band at the Dublin Exposition. 
"At eight o’clock they (The Coldstream Guards) gave 
way to the Canadian Light Horse band whose visit unfort¬ 
unately was about to close. Everyone felt sorry it weB 
- their farewell programme, for the colonials were hearty 
favorites with all. From the first they won hosts of 
admirers and as their stay advanced their friends in¬ 
creased, so that it was not surprising that when the time 
came for departing an impressive demonstration took place. 

The band returned to Canada on the Empress of Britain and disem¬ 
barked at Quebec on September 15. Five days later the bandsmen were 

welcomed home to Calgary. On September 20, in the newly renovated 

( 2 ) 

Vaudette Theatre they presented a programme of the most significant 
of their tour numbers. An expression of appreciation of the services 
of the band to the regiment and the city was made by military personnel 
and civic officials at a smoker and concert held in its honor early the 
following week. Thus concluded an enterprise that gained recognition 
and publicity for Calgary a3 a centre of importance in the cultural 
development of Western Canada. 

In 1909, the lO^rd Regimental band was formed to complement the 
reserve militia rifle unit that had been recruited in Calgary. This 
band gradually assumed a position of prominence at civic functions, 
attracting instrumentalists who had been connected with the Fire Brigade 
and Light Horse bends. Its first bandmaster was Professor Augade who

had been a number of the firemen's group and had always taken an 
active part in things musical during the early days,, He was succeeded 
by Mr. H. H. Hull, an American, who in turn preceded Mr. C. D. Joiner. 
Mr. Joiner had been a cornet soloist with the Light Horse band on its 
trip to the British Isles. He was bandmaster of the lO^rd Regimental 
band until the outbreak of war in 1914. 

The services of this band were in demand during the summer months 
at open-air concerts in Central Park and St. George's Island. Civic 
grants financed these appearances. During the winter months it pre¬ 
sented a series of Sunday evening concerts in the Lyric Theatre. A 
silver collection taken at the door maintained these programmes. There 
was a need for such entertainment in the city to serve the immigrant 
section of the population which, after the close of the church services 
had no other place to go to than its hotels and rooming houses. These 
concerts were timed to supplement rather than to compete with the 
churches. 

The lQ^rd Band joined the Canadian Forces as the 56th Battalion 
band and proceeded overseas with that unit. The war period witnessed 
the organization of several military bands in the city including those 
of the 50th, 82nd and 89th Battalions, all of which saw service over¬ 
seas. 

Another of the early bands in the city was that of the Salvation 
Army.' 1 ) The Citadel Band was organized under Bandmaster Tomlinson 
in 1895. The city streets resounded to its "gladsome, uplifting and 
comforting sacred music” as it attracted western pioneers to the 
Amy's meetings. 

By 1905 the Salvation Army band numbered twenty-six instrumental-

ists under Bandmaster Kilburn and by 1915 it ranked as one of the 
West*s premier brass bands under the baton of Bandmaster C, W, Creighton. 

When war was declared forty of its forty-four members joined the 
colors. Undaunted by the loss of so many of his men. Bandmaster 
Creighton recruited new material from the junior ranks to form the 
Young Peopled Band, which "carried on" during the war. 

After a period of reorganization the band went on tour to the 
coast in 1921, playing in many western centres. The Salvation Army 
band has been over the years, ever willing to assume its civic respons¬ 
ibilities by contributing music to parades, patriotic gatherings and 
religious services. 

Those are the early bands whose martial notes and stirring 
rhythms resounded up and down the streets of Calgary, Their cheerful 
strains made life more pleasant for the citizens and sought to direct 
attention to the enterprising city of the West.

CHAPTER X. 


MUSICAL EDUCATION IN CALGARY . 

The question "Does Calgary appreciate good music?" has been and 
is frequently asked. A vigorous negative has been the answer whenever 
public support of some significant musical event has not come up to 
expectation. It was asked when Kathleen Parlow played to an audience 
of only 550 in her native city early in 1912 although she had filled 
the largest auditorium available when she appeared in Winnipeg. 

It was repeatedly heard during the Calgary Symphony eeason of 1915-14 
when support for the local organization seemed to be waning/ 2 '* And 
even to-day choral and symphony conductors and concert impresarios 
hazard such an answer when faced with a deficit. 

An explanation for this attitude of the public toward musical 
events is difficult to find. It could not lie in the fact that Calgary 
was overrun with high-class musical attractions, particularly during 
the years being examined here. Nor could it be the constant strain 
upon the pocket-book. Nor was it a lack of organization in handling 
these performances. The search for an answer has generally ended by 
conceding that there was something wrong with the musical taste of 
Calgary people. 

The development of musical taste or appreciation in a community 
is a slow process. Material development is rapid and favors the 
encouragement of activities other than those of a cultural nature. 

It must be recognized that there is a large amount of educational 
work which must be done in every new city before the people are able 
and willing to appreciate high-class music.

Albertan, March 25, 1912.

The musical education of a community may be fostered and carried 
on through various channels. The most common of these is the training 
of the individual by private music teachers. To further the work of 
the private instructor, conservatories of music are organized and these 
make available a more extensive course of musical training. In an 
attempt to acquaint the masses with things musical, specialized in¬ 
struction is introduced into the curricula of the public Schools. 

Then, to supplement these media of training, particularly in adult 
life, musical societies under a variety of names - Studio, Clef, 
Oratorio, Lieder - sustain musical interest throughout the years in 
the community. 

All these varied means of musical education have been and are 
available to Calgary. Their contribution in raising the standard of 
muBical appreciation in the city cannot be overlooked. During the 
period under examination, successful efforts were made to provide 
adequate opportunities for the development of musical taste. 

The first music teacher in Calgary was Miss Ada Dowling, who 
upon marriage became Mrs. J. R. Costigan. Miss Dowling came from 
Fredericton, N.B. in 1887 to teach in the public school in Calgary. 

She was the only teacher beside Mr. Boag, the principal* In Freder¬ 
icton, Miss Dowling had been organist of St. Dunstan 1 s Church. She 
brought with her a baby grand piano, the first of its kind in Calgary. 
Soon she became the music teacher of the sons and daughters of the 
early townspeople. 

After her marriage she devoted her time to the teaching of the 
piano and participation in the musical activities of the town. Later 
she became associated with Mrs. Broder in teaching music at Western 
Canada College for boys and at St. Hilda's College for girls. Mrs. 
Costigan was the first piano teacher of Canada's first scholarship

winner ^to the Royal Acaden^ of Music, London, Mrs. Gladys McKelvie 
Egbert* 

Among the early vocal teachers in Calgary was Mrs* Charlie Booth. 
Mrs* Booth was a vocalist and pianist, having appeared on the concert 
stage from the age of five* She was reported to have been a great 
granddaughter of John Sebastian Bach. She came to Calgary from Mil¬ 
waukee, U*S*A* As early as 1905, Mrs* Booth was placed in charge of 
music in the public schools of Calgary. She was active in the first 
Women’s Musical Club of the city organized in 1904. In 1907, she 

became musical instructress in the Provincial Normal School opened at 

( 2 ) 

Calgary in that year/ ' 

The music teachers in Calgary after the turn of the century real¬ 
ized the need of academic musical standards as guides for themselves 
in their teaching and as goals for their pupils. Those who had come 
from England taught with the criteria of the Royal Schools of Music 
in mind, while those coming from Eastern Canada were influenced by 
the Toronto Conservatory of Music* 

It was a natural consequence that steps were taken to introduce 
into the city the syllabus and the examination standards of these 
recognized musical institutions* The value of their requirements was 
realized equally as well then as it is now* This was emphasized by 
His Royal Highness the late Duke of Kent in his presidential address 
to the Annual General Meeting of the Associated Board of the Royal 
Schools of Music in Juljr 1953 when he said, 

"There can be no doubt that the local Examinations 
conducted by the Board have a great influence for good

Mrs. Costigan, now in her 94th year, and living in Victoria.

upon musical education. They set a standard which must 
mould the tasters and develop the appreciation of good 
music in a great number of young people; there must be 
many a teacher who finds in the annual issue of the syll¬ 
abus a means of stimulus for renewed industry on the part 
of the pupils, and many parents, I am sure, notice an 
increased perseverance in regular practice when there is 

an appointment with an Examiner to be faced in a few 

H (l) 

days. 

Again, an article in the educational supplement of the London 
Times in 1959, commenting on the fiftieth anniversary of the Board's 
foundation, reiterated this value to remote centres such as Calgary. 
"The examinations of the Associated Board of the 
Royal Schools of Music have done much to raise the gen¬ 
eral level of music teaching in this country and through¬ 
out the British Empire. The Board's examinees are brought 
into touch with a well-thought-out and progressive scheme 
of real music. The teachers, and more especially those who 
live in remote places, learn from the experience of others, 

and many of the teachers themselves are the product of an 

( 2 ) 

education based on these examinations." 

The Royal Schools were the first to establish a Local Examination 
centre in Calgaiy. This was the result of the influence and the in¬ 
sistence of Mrs. Broder. Dr. A. 0. MacRae, the principal of Western 
Canada College, was the first local representative of the Board and 
writing of his work in such a capacity, he states,

"As far as I can recall, it was through the 
influence of Mrs. Broder and the interest and response 
through her of many music teachers - a goodly number of 
the Old Land — that the Associated Board came to esta¬ 
blish a centre of Examinations in Calgary. Mrs. Broder 
and friends sent my name to said Board to be Represent¬ 
ative of the Board in Calgary as centre. I found it of 
real interest to meet the different examiners each year. 

I would put them up at the Ranchmen’s Club, being myself 
a member. They were careful to keep away from teachers 
during exams and tests. They were particular in desir¬ 
ing that I should publish no results until they were 
safely and surely on their way to next centre, Vancouver 
I think. This was to avoid interviews whether of parents 
or teachers et al. Some of these examiners were very 
notable persons in the realm of music in Britain."^ 

The activities of the Calgary centre were given much prominence 
during the visit of the Duke of Connaught to the city as Governor- 
General in September, 1912. From a special platform erected at the 
main entrance to the City Hall, His Royal Highness presented certifi¬ 
cates to the successful candidates of the Roy a}. Academy of Music and 
the Royal College of Music. Again it was Mrs. Broder who was instru¬ 
mental in making these arrangements. The proceedings included 
addresses by Mayor Mitchell and R. B. Bennett, M.P. The certificates 
were "handed by Dr. MacRae to His Royal Highness who had a smile and 
word of commendation for each blushing recipient as he (sic) curtseyed 

(l) Quoted from a letter from Dr. A. 0« MacRae, Vancouver, B.C.

and received the ribbon-bound roll."^ 

By this time, the Toronto Conservatory of Music had established a 

( 2 ) 

local examination centre in Calgary, ' Col. J. 3. Dennis was the first 
honorary local representative. He was succeeded by Col. John Drummond, 
a local photographer, who was interested in the musical development of 
the city. 

The year 1909 saw an attempt to establish a conservatory of music 
in Calgary. The business enthusiasm of Mr. Wilber Horner end the mus¬ 
ical zeal of Mrs. Broder were instrumental in its foundation. A pro¬ 
vincial charter was taken out under the name of The Conservatory and 

(3) (4) 

Academy of Music, Limited. The name used in its advertising' 'end 

( 5 ) 

upon its programmes was The Calgary Conservatory of Music. 

The Conservatory listed a number of departments which indicated 
the wide and varied scope of the musical training it offered. These 
included pianoforte, voice and vocal repertoire, violin, organ, harmony 
and history of music, theory, guitar and mandolin, and sight-singing. 

The next year there were added languages, elocution and declamation, 
choral classes and wind instruments. Mr. Horner was the secretary- 
treasurer and Miss S. B. D. Blow was the registrar. Permanent quarters 
were established in the Heintzman Building, 222 Eighth Avenue West. 

Among the faculty were many of Calgary^ well-known musicians. 

These included "as principal professor of pianoforte, Mrs. Annie Glen

The Calgary Conservatory of Music was officially opened on the 
King* s (Edward VII 1 s) Birthday, November 9, 1909. The public was in¬ 
vited to inspect the new studios in the afternoon and evening. Inaug¬ 
ural addresses were delivered by Mayor Jamieson and Mr. R. B. Bennett. 

Programmes of musical numbers were presented by the faculty members 

( 2 ) 

on both occasions. ' 

Eight months later on June 21, the Conservatory held its first 
annual closing concert. The press report of the following day com¬ 
mented upon the significance and nature of the event. 

"An unusually interesting occasion - the first of 
its kind in Calgary - was the closing concert of the 
Conservatory of Music at St. Mary*s Hall last night, 
when a large audience followed closely and with marked 
appreciation the numbers of a well chosen programme 
performed by advanced students of pianoforte, singing 
and violin. The capacity of the conservatory for train¬ 
ing young artists of greet promise for the future was 
emphatically proven by results. Marked powers of inter¬ 
pretation and technical efficiency were displayed, and 

...., it may be permitted to predict a successful career

Among those "talented performers" were Jaroslev Bauer, violinist, 

and Freda Sweet, pianist* Mr* Bauer was the Royal Acadeny scholarship 

winner for that year, the second successive one from Calgary for the 

whole of Canada* Mies Sweet achieved a similar honor in 1912.^^ 

Both these students were able to take advantage of their scholarships 

by attending the Royal Academy of Music in London* This would not 

have been possible for Mr. Bauer had not Mrs. Broder and Dr* A* 0. 

MacRae recognized his talent and obtained financial aid through a 

special benefit fund raised by concerts and subscriptions. He later 

( 2 ) 

became a sub-professor in the Royal Acadeny*' 

After the musical programme, Mr. Horner, as secretary-treasurer, 
presented the first annual report of the Conservatory. He stated 
that sixty-two students had been under instruction during the year. 

In addition to these, many private pupils of Mrs* Broder, Miss Phillips, 
Mrd. Dudley Smith and Mr. Howells had studied at the Conservatory and 
had brought the total number under instruction by the faculty to over 
two hundred. He recorded the creditable work of Mr. Bauer in violin 
and of Miss Freda Sweet in pianoforte. 

The presentation of certificates by Mrs. P. Bums marked the 
conclusion of the Conservatory’s first annual aclosing concert. 

Throughout the summer of 1910, a series of advertisements from 
the Calgary Conservatory of Music ran in the Calgary Herald* These 
featured individual pictures of the faculty, especially drawing 
attention to the additions to the staff, Mme. Walter, to. Bessie 
Evans-Duggan, R.A.M*, vocalist, and Mr. G* E. Holt, Mus. Bac., of 
the Pro-Cathedral, and to additional departments of instruction

including languages, elocution and wind instruments. These also 
announced several scholarships available at the conservatory, namely 

a Heintzman scholarship for pianoforte/ 1 ^ an Agnes Phillips scholar- 

( 2 ) 

ship open for competition in any line of musical study and the R. B. 

(5) 

Bennett scholarship for singing. x J 

It would seem that, after a successful initial year, and with the 
encouraging prospects of enlarged staff and increased areas of instruc¬ 
tion, together with the incentives of available scholarships, the con¬ 
servatory was firmly established in the city and generally accepted by 
the citizens. Its future seemed assured* 

But this was not to be* Disintegration set in through lack of 
co-cperation among the staff members and suspicions relative to busi¬ 
ness administration* The actual cause of the collapse of the Calgary 
Conservatory is difficult to obtain from surviving faculty members. 

One has to read between the lines in a statement given the writer by 

(4) 

Mr* Horner a few months before his death. 

"In such a venture, there must always be some, 
like Frank Wrigley, who will endeavour to undermine 
and I had left him out* I had even made application to 
City Council for a site for a Conservatory Building on 
the corner opposite the Central High School, then vacant 
and much more suitable for such a purpose than for a 
service station. I was much surprised to find Wrigley

opposing the application and P. L. (Newcombe) 
withdrawing his support, chagrined to lose the 
site and too far into the venture to quit."^^ 

Professional jealousies from within and without, and tensions 
resulting from real estate deals 3eemed to have undermined an organ¬ 
ization which had the making of and might have developed into a 
splendid institution contributing much to the cultural well-being of 
Calgary. 

An organization which has fo^stered musical education in the city 
and provided opportunities for the appreciation of the best in music 
is the Women's Musical Club. From the time of its founding down to 
the present, it has done much to draw attention to promising young 
musicians and to encourage them to pursue their studies at more advan¬ 
tageous centres. It has made available to the general public, through 
its regular concerts, music by the great performers of the day. 

The first Musical Club was formed in Calgary in 1904 to give 
pleasure to a group of music lovers and to meet a need because of 
lack of entertainment at that time. Mrs. A. Scott Dawson and Mrs. 

J. S. Dennis, wives of leading engineers here, invited a group of 
friends to meet one afternoon to organize the Club. Among those 
present were Mrs. R. R. Jamieson and Misa Eleanor Davidson, who was 
then the organist at Knox Presbyterian Church. 

The first president was Mrs. Scott Dawson, herself a violinist. 

Mr8. Jamieson was secretary. Meetings were held in a hall on Eighth 
Avenue. The club was soon augmented by the valuable addition to its 
roll of Mrs. Roland Winter, Mrs. O'Sullivan, Mrs. A* M. Grogan and 
Mrs. Muckleston, a music teacher. The programmes were in charge of

a music committee. Some of the early artists were Mrs. Charles W. 
McMillan, Mrs. Sidney Houlton and Mrs. E. Sisley, vocalists, and Mrs. 
Grogan, Mrs. Dawson and Mrs. Charlie Booth, instrumentalists. "This 
dut progressed for a time but finally petered out. 

In 1912, Mme. Anderson, the wife of Mr. Herbert Edgar Anderson, 
took up the threads by calling a meeting at her home. At this meeting 
Mme. Anderson was elected president. Mrs. Roland Winter, Mrs. R. J. 
Colgrove and several lady music teachers were prominent in the organ¬ 
ization of this second club. This was the origin of the present 
Women*s Musical Club. 

The places of meeting have changed from time to time according 
to the needs. The assembly hall of the old Central School, Unity Hall, 
the Hudson’s Bay Company store, Nolan’s Hall, First Baptist Sunday 
School Room, Isis Theatre, Palliser Hotel and Central Church have been 
used to meet the increased demands of the club's membership. Many 
familiar names have appeared as presidents throughout the years. 

These include Mme. Anderson, Mme. Walter, Mrs. J. W. Mitchell, Mrs. 

H. H. Sharpies, Mrs. F. J. Butler and Mrs. R. J. Colgrove. 

To Mrs. Sharpies the club owes much of its present success and 
community standing. It was she who inaugurated its most successful 
type of programmes and gave it a mission in the city. The early pro¬ 
grammes were of a miscellaneous nature, noted for their entertainment 
value. Later special papers were prepared by individual members upon 
musical topics. Both these types lacked careful long-term planning. 

When Mrs. Sharpies became president in April 1916, she introduced 
the policy of planning the entire season's programmes from September 
to the following June. In this she was able to enlist the co-operation

of the leading musicians and music teachers of the city in a vsell- 
planned series of recital programmes. Later this developed into the 
"concert-series” type which is followed out at present. 

Mrs. Sharpies was also instrumental in directing the club's act¬ 
ivities towards aiding worthy students in their musical education. 

This was done through scholarships. No doubt her interest in this 
field was aroused through her position as local representative of the 
Royal Schools of Music and her activities in connection with the 
Alberta Musical Festival. A scholarship fund was built up during the 
early 1920's from the proceeds of concerts given by outstanding artists 
under the Club's auspices. Among these was the famous soprano, Amelia 
Galli-Curci. The net: proceeds of this concert were used as the nucleus 
of a fund for festival use. Young festival winners of outstanding 
merit and promise have benefitted through further study made possible 
by financial aid from the Women's Musical Club. 

The introduction of formal instruction in music into the Calgary 
schools and the appointment of a music master occurred in 1892.^ ^ 

It was after much deliberation and not without certain misgivings 

( 2 ) 

that the trustees of the Protestant Union School Board permitted 
this innovation into the curriculum. The discussion at the time 
implied the fear of "this frill" occupying too much of the pupils' 
time to the detriment of the more essential subjects. 

In January 1892, the school children presented two concerts in 
the Opera House. The training of the pupils had been done by Professor 
Frank B. Fenwick, the musical director of Knox Presbyterian Church. 

The press report of the concert concluded with the following statement:

"It was evident that Prof. Fenwick had taken lots 
of pains with the children and it was equally clear 
that the youngsters had responded to his instruction 
with zeal and alacrity.^ 

Whether the success of the concerts prompted a public demand for 
musical instruction in the schools by Prof. Fenwick or if he used the 
presentations to demonstrate his ability to teach music to children's 
groups, is not stated, but the report of the board meeting held the 
following week contained this paragraph under the caption, "Music in 
the Schools". 

"A letter from Prof. Fenwick was read, formally 
applying for the position of music teacher to the public 
schools; his salary to be $500 a year, with two exhibi¬ 
tion entertainments to be given during the year, one 
half of the proceeds to go to him, the other half to 
the schools. The matter was discussed freely and some 
apprehension was expressed in reference to the possible 
effect of the getting up of exhibitions on the ordinary 
work of the schools. Mr. (James)Muir said a complaint 
had been made to him, not in regard to the music being 
taught in the schools, but upon the exciting effect of 
the work of preparing for the entertainments in the 
Opera House. The chairman (Mr. Peter McCarthy, Q.C.) 
favored music being taught but was a little afraid of 
the expense. The principal (Mr. James Short) being 
interrogated said music was taught in the French 
schools and in all Ontario towns of a population of

over 5000. The secretary (ivlr. F. H. Turnock) said 
it was taught in the Winnipeg schools. Dr. (H. G.) 

Mackid thought it was well to proceed slowly in the 
matter. Finally it was resolved to defer action on 
the professor's letter, and in the meantime to ascer¬ 
tain the feeling of parents and ratepayers on this 
subject.^ 

That the matter became a live issue for the moment is implied by 

the tone of the following front page editorial. 

"As the decision of the school trustees to employ 
Prof. Fenwick to teach music in the Protestant schools 
of Calgary will not be approved by all taxpayers, and 
as the Professor's proposal does not embody all necess¬ 
ary details, it is important that the trustees should 
be at some pains to have the proposed arrangements 
closely defined, and especially with regard to the days 
and hours when the music lessons shall be given. There 
is no novelty in the introduction of the teaching of 
music in public schools, and it ought not to be any more 
difficult to arrange for its introduction here than else¬ 
where. At the same time it can not be denied that the 
time of the pupils is pretty well occupied by their pre¬ 
sent studies, and it is admitted that some of these must 
be curtailed to admit musical instruction. The point to 
be kept in view is to interfere as little as possible 
with the more essential studies, giving parents as small 
ground as possible for complaint on this score. The

degree of authority to be exercised by the music teacher 

over the pupils is also a matter to be fully considered. 1 ^ 

On February 15, 1892, the School Boerd appointed Prof. Fenwick 

as singing teacher in the Calgary Schools. As the number of classes 

( 2 ) 

was small' 'his duty involved the actual teaching of music in the 
classrooms. The course as planned by Prof. Fenwick and outlined in 
his application was as follows: 

"I would give the children a musical education 

(vocal) in class, including sight reading, the proper 

use of the voice and singing. I would propose to have 

examinations and give an exhibition of their work from 

time to time. Time of lessons to be arranged with the 

principal so as not to interfere with other subjects. 

Thus music was introduced early into Calgary schools under a 

special teacher. Professor Fenwick retained this position until 

June 50, 1895 when he resigned and left Calgary. Residents of those 

days when questioned now about his musical reputation and success in 

school and in church are unable to contribute information. One admits 

there was such a person in the school3^^while another's recollection 

does not include his name nor does it associate him with the Pro- 

( 5 ) 

Cathedral or Knox Presbyterian Church.' '

the schools. Mrs. Charlie Booth*s appointment in this capacity became 
effective on October 1, 1905* She was successful in this position 
until December 51 > 1907 when she was appointed to the staff of the 
Calgary Provincial Normal School. Teachers who were on the staff at 
that time^ ^ speak of her work as wonderful. As the number of classes 
in 1905 was only seventeen and had only increased to forty-five in 
1907, Mrs. Booth was able to assume complete responsibility for the 
actual teaching of music in all the classrooms. Her animated manner 
and confident musicianship contributed to her success in this capacity. 

Miss Edith A. Comben, of Sackville, New Brunswick succeeded Mrs. 
Booth in January 1908. Miss Comben remained on the staff until 1914. 
Owing to the outbreak of war and resultant economies, music teachers 
were then dispensed with. 

On this phase of musical education in Calgary during this period, 
Mrs. Broder contributed the following comment, 

"Educationally, Calgary may be said to have struck 
a distinctive note in the matter of child voice training. 

In advance of other cities and of the provincial status, 
it had already secured (in 1905) a talented teacher in 
the person of Mrs. Booth, from Milwaukee, to give special 
attention to this department. In preference to the rou¬ 
tine work of teachers already tired in the larger public 
schools with other topics, all cultured minds in Calgary 
concurred in supporting a system which promised to pro¬ 
duce the best results in the hands of an enthusiastic 
and vivacious instructress coming fresh to her subject. 

Recently this branch of musical education has passed 
(l) Miss Elsie Cook and Miss Kate Currie.

into the capable hands of Miss Edith Comben, who, 
under the superintendence of Dr, Melville Scott 
(himself keenly interested in music) is carrying 
out a well arranged plan in a clear, thorough and 
systematic manner, Mrs, Booth meantime has been 
promoted to the fine Normal School built last year, 
where the work of preparing teachers to carry on 
musical training throughout the province, while it 
presents peculiar difficulties, should be fruitful 
in excellent results, 

( 2 ) 

In September 1918, Dr, J. E. Hodgson 'was appointed music super¬ 
visor in the Calgary schools. By this time the number of classrooms 
had increased and was approaching three hundred® No longer was the 
work of a music teacher possible. The teaching of music had been 
carried on by the regular classroom teachers during the war years. 

This practice was now to be continued under the guidance and inspira¬ 
tion of a supervisor. Dr, Hodgson was responsible for the participa¬ 
tion of school choirs in the Alberta Musical Festivals, In June 1922, 
for reasons of health, he was forced to resign and to take up residence 
at a lower altitude. 

The private schools of the city also gave attention to music but 
on an individual rather than a class basis. At Western Canada College 
for boys and at St, Hilda 1 s College for girls, Mrs, Broder, assisted 
by Mrs, J. R. Costigan and Miss Muckleston, prepared pianists and 
vocalists for the examinations of the Toronto Conservatory and the 
Royal Schools of Music,

In 1911, under the auspices of the Methodist Church and under 
Dr. George W. Kerby as principal. Mount Royal College v?as established. 

A conservatory of music wa3 organized in the college which aimed "to 
attract a faculty of distinguished musicians and to provide Alberta 
students of music, facilities for study equal to those of the leading 
institutions of Eastern Canada and the United States. 

In achieving its aim the Conservatory has been quite successful. 
Under the guidance of a number of well qualified musicians as director 
at successive periods between 1911 and the early 1920's - Mr. Wilfred 
Oaten, Dr. J. E. Hodgson, Dr. Frederic Rogers and Mr. P. L. Newcombe - 
the Conservatory has played an important pert in the musical life of 
the city and district. It has provided complete courses in music and 
theory under competent teachers which could be taken in conjunction 
with other college studies. It has permitted students to specialize 
in the courses required by such musical institutions as those at 
McGill, Toronto and London. It has encouraged participation in choral, 
symphonic and chamber music groups. Year by year these facilities 
have been extended and widened until today its name is associated with 
Calgary's only symphony orchestra. 

Musical education in Calgary has been fostered by individuals 
and by public and private bodies. Each made available those facilities 
necessary for training in music and for the appreciation of the best 
in man's musical heritage.

CONCLUSION. 


CHAPTER XI. 


In The Morning Albertan of February 22, 1908, there appeared an 
article entitled ‘‘Alberta's Musical Development". The writer, Mrs. 
Broder, dealt entirely with the musical progress of Calgary, rather 
than of Alberta, up to that time* But in her introductory and conclud¬ 
ing paragraphs, she made the following predictions for the cultural 
well-being of the immigrant to the province and to the city, and sensed 
the significance of her own position in the pioneer era. 

"In a young country, a young century and a young 
province precedence must be given to youth, and it is 
a pleasure to be able to say 'right here" (as a good 
Canadian would express it) to all intending settlers, 
whether with tiny children, tall sons and daughters, 
or as yet only rosy dreams of home and family, that 
whatever their musical requirements may be they are 
coming to a place where those requirements will 
promptly be met. - 

" - But enough has been said to prove to in¬ 

tending settlers that whatever their gifts may be, in 
Calgary they will be trained, fostered and made the 
most of. They would arrive in Alberta at a veiy inter¬ 
esting period of its musical growth, and help to swell 
the chorus of the future. There is an immense fascina¬ 
tion as well as a high sense of responsibility in the 
work of the musical pioneer. There is the first fresh 
joy of turning up the virgin soil, and the fuller satis¬ 
faction of knowing that in an art that is illimitable 
with a scope that is boundless 'there yet remaineth much

land to be possessed'"• 

It mas as musical pioneers that Mrs. Annie Glen Broder, Mr. P. L. 
Newcombe/ 1 ) Mr. Frank Wrigley, Mr. F. B. Cooper, Mrs. Ada Dowling 
Costigan, Prof* Augad© and Captain Begley found themselves in Calgary 
at the time of the appearance of the above quoted article. The musical 
soil was indeed virgin, and gave promise of great fertility. The "fresh 
joy of turning up" that soil must have given them such sustaining sat¬ 
isfaction that they were challenged to devote their lives, in face of 
misunderstanding and prejudice, to train, foster and make the most of 
the gifts possessed by the settlers they found living here, and by 
those hundreds of thousands who arrived at varying intervals on the 
immigrant trains. 

The people among whom these musicians pioneered were spirited, 
resourceful and restless. They possessed a strong desire to express 
themselves. Music and drama were two natural avenues of such express¬ 
ion. But in the strange atmosphere of the new land they were too prone 
to neglect the artistic standards and traditions of those countries 
from which they had come. They were too willing to accept ingenuity as 
a substitute for the artistic, too eager to accept "doing their best in 
any old wey". They regarded the intention and the spirit behind the 
rendition as their criteria for the acceptable performance. 

It was the responsibility of the pioneer professional musician to 
keep the spirit of the settler interested, vital and enthusiastic. At 
the same time it was required of him to give it direction in the line 
of acceptable standards and traditions. He must not assume a super¬ 
cilious attitude toward their efforts. He must begin with them at 
their level and build from that point the musical structure of which 
he dreamed for the West. 

(l) Mr. P. L. Newcombe passed away suddenly on March 1, 1952.

Here lies the reason for the apparent failure in the performance 
of "The Atonement" and of its subsequent outgrowth, the Philharmonic 
Society of 1904-08. Here also is the explanation of the success of 
"The Messiah" and of its subsequent outgrowth, the Apollo Choir of 
1907-18. In the former case. Col. Dennis and Mrs. Broder were attempt¬ 
ing something so new in form and harmony that it was far beyond the 
appreciation of the singers and of the community at that time. In 
their anxiety to do something for the musical development of the city, 
they were moving too fast. But in the latter case, Mr. Newcombe started 
with a work with which a large portion of the community was familiar. 
There was the appeal of the known. He was proceeding more slowly. 

Here also lies the reason for the popularity, success, growth and 
multiplicity of bands in the community. The bands of the street cor¬ 
ners, the "German Bands" of the Old Land were familiar to the immigrants. 
They were the musical groups with which they had come in daily contact, 
while the choral societies and the symphony orchestras were limited to 
the specialized minority. The bands were more willingly and more eas¬ 
ily financed; the choral presentations required vigorous ticket-selling 
campaigns if deficits were to be avoided. A series of symphony concerts 
demanded an extensive subscription list and numerous guarantors. 

The pioneer musicians early realized the need of organized effort 
in the field of musical education. This is evidenced by the early 
introduction of a music specialist to the public school programme and 
the prominence given to music in such private schools as Western Canada 
College for boys and St. Hilda’s School for girls. It is also seen in 
the desire of the local music teachers to establish conservatories of 
music and to take advantage of the examination facilities offered by 
the Royal Schools of Music of London and by the Toronto Conservatory

of Music* Though not all of these ventures were successful, the 
attempts indicate that efforts were made to provide the younger members 
of the population, and the older ones also, with an opportunity to 
cultivate a proficiency in and an appreciation of the better types of 
music• 

It is also worthy of note that participation in musical events 
held during the period under examination attracted wide and varied 
elements of the town or city* These presentations were community 
enterprises and participation in them was regarded as a civic respons¬ 
ibility. Programmes of early concerts and operettas contain the names 
of leading business and professional men, their numbers being augmented 
by their wives and families. The irrigation expert and railroad execu¬ 
tive, the police magistrate, the editor-owner of the city daily, the 
fire chief, the district court judge, the notable criminal lawyer and 
the member of the cloth, gave of their time and talent as conductors, 
principals, soloists, instrumentalists and choristers to further the 
cause of music in Calgary. It wa3 not for personal monetary reward 
or exhibitionism, but rather to lend their whole-hearted support to a 
civic cause that wes making life in the young community more pleasant 
by fostering the spirit of friendship and co-operation. This is sugg¬ 
ested in the following excerpts which were written in reminiscence of 
those days. 

"The rehearsals were productive of much harmless 
fun and new friendships, and many regrets when the fin¬ 
ished work of several weeks came to an end."^^ and 

"In the formative period of musical taste in Calgary 
while other sources of entertainment were scarce, members

and friends of the central churches flocked to each 
other's concerts and social gatherings and welcomed 
newcomers. Teachers and pupils sympathetically supp¬ 
orted each other's performances while the press gener¬ 
ously reported and inserted favorable advance notices 
of all that went on. This was certainly an agreeable 
state of affairs and provided a favorable atmosphere 
for further developments to follow. 

The community spirit and the friendliness developed in those mus¬ 
ical efforts of the earlier era have passed. The smaller city with its 
limited attractions encouraged willing co-operation among its citizens 
in fostering cultural enterprises. The passing of these conditions is 
due to the complexity of modern life in the expanding city. During 
the closing years of World War I this changed feeling was in evidence 
and the trend became increasingly noticeable during the 1920's and 
throughout the 1950's. It became more difficult to organize large- 
scale musical enterprises. Practices were poorly attended and constant¬ 
ly came into conflict with the more numerous events that were now 
taking up people's time, interest and attention. The growth of the 
city placed those interested at considerable distance from the centres 
for rehearsals. This is the feeling expressed in the following para¬ 
graph with an attempt to account for the change. 

"But with the expansion of the city and its activ¬ 
ities, the increased number of churches, schools and 
social service clubs, to say nothing of the competing 
attractions of the theatre, moving pictures end the more 
recent lure of the radio, such reciprocal concurrence

has become exceedingly difficult. It belongs to a 
pleasant period that has passed, but a period that no 
one could seriously wish had remained permanent. To 
it has succeeded an era of fuller achievement and more 
discriminating co-operation. With difficulties still 
to overcome and obstacles yet to be surmounted, musi¬ 
cal development is decidedly on the upgrade and com¬ 
bined efforts have placed Calgary in a commanding 
position in the musical annals of the Dominion.^ 

As a consequence of this effect of modern city life upon cultural 
development, music and the related arts have become the media of ex¬ 
pression for the professional group and the specialized few. No longer 
does participation become a community enterprise or a civic respons¬ 
ibility. As the writer implied in the foregoing paragraph, "an era of 
fuller achievement and more discriminating co-operation 11 has succeeded 
the "pleasant period" of the past. The quality of the music has 
improved with the restrictions and limitations placed upon the number 
who enter into the experience of producing it. The modern music lover 
is no longer an active participant enjoying the creative experience 
and the social contacts with the many of like interests. He is a 
passive spectator ready to pay a fee for the satisfaction of his cul¬ 
tural need by listening to the artistry of the specialized few. 

Progress has been achieved at the expense of the many. 

As for the wish for that "pleasant period" to have remained per¬ 
manent, - that would have neant stagnation for Calgary’s musical 
development. But it must be conceded that the modern era is too prone 
to seek its music through the mechanical devices of recording and

radio. The experience for the individual through participation in a 
full chorus with pipe organ, symphony or band accompaniment can only 
be appreciated by those few choristers who, in spite of adversity and 
discouragement still make such organizations possible. The individual 
instrumentalist also, under union jurisdiction, is too prone to regard 
monetary reward rather than creative enjoyment as the end of symphony 
or band membership. The young are being trained musically for the 
role of solo performers rather than that of participants in a group 
effort. Exhibitionism and fees are set as the goals of achievement 
rather than the giving of pleasure to others and to oneself through 
creative expression. This is borne out forcibly by the entries in 
the Alberta Musical Festivals. The solo classes, vocal and instru¬ 
mental, are heavy, but group classes are dropped because of lack of 
entries or appear on the programme with a single contesting choir or 
orchestra. 

The foundation of Calgary's present musical structure was laid 
in the years covered in this study. Enterprising pioneer people were 
led by a select professional group, the members of which made available 
for these early settlers and citizens opportunities for cultural 
growth, and for the enjoyment through participation in various musical 
experiences, - light opera with its many facets of expression, small 
and large choral groups attracting wide and varied membership, the 
symphony orchestra with its demand for specialized instrumentalists 
and secure financial backing, and the band with its general appeal to 
the public. They attempted to raise the standard of performance and 
appreciation through education directed by private tuition, conserva¬ 
tory and public school. To the larger centres of musical culture, 
London and New York, Calgary sent her talented musicians in Odette de

Foras, Jean Gilbert and Minuetta Schumiatcher Borek. Others returned 
from these centres to give leadership to things musical, - Gladys 
McKelvie Egbert, Mollie Pierce Hamilton, Harold Ramsay and Jean Cotton. 
The symphonic outburst of 1915-14, after being dormant for fourteen 
years, reappeared under the leadership of Grigori Garbovitsky from 

1929 to 1959. 

To those who struggled against obstacles of inertia, prejudice 
and discouragement to develop its musical heritage, Calgary should be 
everlastingly grateful. May this brief study help to keep their 
memory green and to remind those who follow of their indebtedness to 


them.
