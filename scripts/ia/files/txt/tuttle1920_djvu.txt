The relations between a plant and the tem¬ 
perature conditions of its environment, form a 
problem which can only be solved indirectly, by 
regarding the result of temperature upon the 
many life processes of the plant. These are the 
factors which determine its growth, and upon 
which depend its successful existence and pro- 
; pagation. The ability which plants possess to 
withstand low temperatures varies widely, not 
only with those of different species, but even 
amongst various individuals of the same species 
which have grown under different climatic con¬ 
ditions. 

Some hydrophytes, i.e.plants living under 
moist conditions such as fiitella syncarpa, are 
frozen at a temperature of -4° C while Sphaerella 
nivalis, living in the snow of Arctic regions 
is often exposed to a temperature of -20°C for 
months without being destroyed. One of the 
most striking illustrations of the ability of 
plants to withstand extremely low temperatures, 
is given by Kjellman, reported by Schimper (1),

in a description of the Arctic flora as seen by 
him on the "Tega^exp edit ion. In speaking of 
Cochlearia fenestrata he says: 

fc 

There are few places on earth where the 
winters are so severe as the spot on which the 
n Yega IT expedition passed the winter. The cold 
was very persistent, and the temperature went 
below -46°C. The individual in question grew 
on the top of a fairly high sand hillock near 
Pittlekaj, exposed to the constant and cutting 
North or Northeast wind. It had commenced to 
bloom in the summer of 1878, but its blooming 
| was far from being completed, when the winter 
came on and stopped further progress. Its sys¬ 
tem of flowers consequently included flower-buds 
in the various stages of development, recently 
opened flowers, blown flowers, and some more or 
less ripened fruits. Only an insicnifieant, 
shrivelled remnant of the basal rasette of leaves 
remained, but the upper ones were fresh and vig- 
ourous. In this condition the plant was over¬ 
taken by winter, and exposed to its utmost rigour. 
We might well have believed that it must have 
been killed, and especially that the tender 




3 


flowering parts which were attacked during the de¬ 
velopment would have been destroyed hy the frost 
and so prevented from developing further* Phis 
however, was not the ease* When the summer of 
1879 began* the plant continued its growth from 
the point at which it had been arrested by the ap¬ 
proach of winter, the flower-buds opened, and from 
the axils of the fresh upper leaves fresh inflor¬ 
escences sprouted forth* n 

On the other hand, there are plants whose 
critical temperature lies above freezing point* 
Plants such as the tropical Acanthaceae, the varie¬ 
gated Coleus, tobacco plants and melons wither, dry 
up and die if exposed for any length of time to a 
temperature of £°U, due to their roots being unable 
to absorb sufficient water at this temperature to 
balance that given off by the leaves during transpir¬ 
ation. such plants, after an exposure to this tem¬ 
perature, resemble closely plants that have been 
actually frozen, but, as will be seen latter, the 
phenomenon here does not include the processes 
which take place when a plant actually freezes* 

If, then, plants respond so differently to 
temperature, the question arises as to the cause of 



4 


or factors which regulate their ability to with¬ 
stand low temperatures. But in order to deal 
with these factors, one must first determine 
clearly as to what is meant by freezing of plant 
tissues, and whether a frozen plant need there¬ 
after be a dead one. 

At one time it was thought that the freez¬ 
ing of a plant entailed the rupturing of the cell 
walls, but it has now been determined that such 
is not the case. It is a fact known to all, that 
plant tissues contain a very high percentage of 
water. A small amount of this water enters into 
chemical combination in the formation of the 
different plant products, but by far the largest 
percentage of it is present in the cell wall, 
the cell body,and in the cell sap of the vacuoles. 

If frozen plant tissue be examined, ice 
crystals will be seen to be most abundant in 
the intercellular spaces, how, under ordinary 
conditions these intercellular spaces are fill¬ 
ed with air- and contain a very small amount of 
water, if indeed, any at all. Hence, some force 
must have been exerted during the process of 
freezing, by means of which the water was ex¬ 
pelled from the plant cells into the intercell- 



5 


ular spaces where it crystalised. According to 
Kerner (2),.the phenomenon of freezing is best 
explained as follows: ” The protoplasm becomes 
stimulated and roused by the lowering of the tem¬ 
perature to transport a portion of the water from 
the interior to the exterior of the cell, by 
means of contraction and pressure ..........In the 

cooled leaves the benefit, of course, is to be 
sought for in thefaet that the living portions of 
the cells are protected from destruction as long 
as possible by the formation of ice crystals in 
the intercellular spaces. If the water were forth¬ 
with frozen inside the cells, between the groups 
of molecules of the living cell body and its wall, 
by a few degrees of cold, fundamental displace¬ 
ments and disorganizations of the groups of mole¬ 
cules would be unavoidable. On the other hand, 
the ice crystals on the Exterior of the cells do 

9 ) 

not produce such destruction. 

It has been shown that this excretion of water 
need not connote the death of the cells. If the 
material be slowly thawed, the water can be again 
received back into the cells. If, on the other 
hand, the cold has been so severe as to change to 
ice the water held in the protoplasm, which is 







essential to its vitality, then a disorganization 
of that substance takes pla.ce. It is then that the 
plant would he frozen dead. 

It would seem then, that with the protoplasm 
of the individual plant, rested the determination 
of the critical degree of cold for that individual. 
The protoplasm of Cochlearia, mentioned above, was 
able to withstand -46°C, while that of Hitella was 
killed at -4°C. The- definite composition of proto¬ 
plasm has no t, as yet, been exactly determined, but 
one is justified in contending that a variation in 
its composition in different plants is largely re¬ 
sponsible for their varying response to temperature 
just as the presence of different salts in solution 
causes a change in the freezing point of water. 

Because of the important ps.rt which water 
plays in the process of freezing, it follows natur¬ 
ally that the water content of the plant at the 
time of freezing would be an important consider¬ 
ation. Young shoots, flowers and leaves are frozen 
at such a temperature as -1°0, while woody trunks 
and mature seeds are able to withstand extreme 
winter temperatures. This is generally attributed 

to the difference in water content in the two eases. 



That this is true in the case of seeds, is 
shown by an investigation reported by Detmer (3): 

W I have taken on the one hand air-dry 
wheat grains, and on the other wheat grains which 
had been lying in water for seven hours, and 
! exposed both for fifteen hours to a tempera¬ 
ture of -10°C in small glasses. 1 found that 
the former, when placed on moist sand under 
normal conditions for germination, are still 
capable of germinating, while the latter do 
not germinate and perish . n 

There is still another factor which must 
be regarded as one which affects the temperature 
at which plants freeze, and that is the concen¬ 
tration of their cell sap. It is this concentra¬ 
tion which determines the osmotic pressure, and 
because of the relationship existing between 
the freezing point of a solution and its osmot¬ 
ic pressure, the importance of the concentration 
of the sap within the cell is very great. The 
following data obtained by Dixon (4( are of in¬ 
terest in this connection:

From these figures it is seen that such

en at ordinary freezing point hut at approxim¬ 


ately one degree below, while Syringa and 
Fraxinus are able to withstand more than two 
degrees of frost as a result of a fairly high 
concentration of their cell sap), lo doubt, 
figures could be obtained from other groups, 
the halophytes for instance, which would yield 
still more striking results. 

It has been mentioned earlier that Cochlear- 
ia fenestrata is able to withstand even so low 
a temperature as -46°C, and so the question arises 
I as to whether there is any temperature so low as 
to prohibit the existence of plant life. As 

yet none has been recorded. She coldest known

then, at no 

place on 

the earth 

is the temperature so low 

that no 

plant can 

withstand it* 

The alleged 

complete 

absence of 

' all terrestrial vegetation in the 

Antarctic 

polar zones is 

not due to 

an absol- 


utely greater cold there - for the thermometer 


does not fall so low as in the iiorth polar 
zones - but to the fact that the temperature 
remains so low, and almost constantly under 
the minimum of the essential functions. 







The life of a plant is made up of very 
different actions, each of which is performed 
within its own range of temperature, tiust as 
a wide range of temperature exists in the 
phenomenon of freezing, so a similar range 
occurs in connection witn all tne vital pro¬ 
cesses of the plant. 

For the process of germination the degrees 
of temperature given for minima, as quoted hy 
Sehimper, are instructive : Tf Sinapsis alha, 

Camelina dent at a. Trifolium hyhridum and Med- 
icago sativa germinated between 0°C and 1°C ! . T 
Of plants from hot countries ^olanum Melongena, 
Hieotiana Tabacum and Oueurbita Pepo germinat¬ 
ed between 11°C and 16°C, but Cucumis sativa, 

C. melo and The chroma cacao only above 16°C. 

Uloth observed the germination of several grasses 
Oruciferae and Papilionaeeao, at 0°C but the 
process was very protracted. Ke rner placed 
glass tubes containing earth and seeds in a 
spring, the temperature of which remained 
constant at 2°C and he found that numerous 
alpine plants germinated even at this low 
temperature. 




Growth after germination depends on 
conditions of temperature similar to these 
required for that process. Some alpine plants 
are able to grow at temperatures approaching 
freezing point. Flowers of Soldanella alpina 
have been found breaking through the snow and 
those of Anemone vernalis and Crocus in half 
melted snow. More remarkable than this how¬ 
ever, is the growth of the seaweeds of Arctic 
seas in water whose maximum temperature sel¬ 
dom exceeds 0°C, and their production of sex- 
! ual organs in the winter at-l°0. 

As regards the processes of assimilation 
and respiration, fewer data are available, but 
it is a well established fact that these two 
functions do exhibit very dissimilar tempera¬ 
ture curves, She lower zero point for assimi¬ 
lation is lower than that for any other func¬ 
tion of the plant, dummelle observed a dis¬ 
tinct though weak assimilation in Abies ex&el- 
sa, tJuniperus communis and Evernia prunestris 
even at -40°C, while he could not observe any 
distinct respiration below -10°C in the same 
I plants, fhe optima for these functions lie, 
of course, amongst the higher temperatures. 








that of assimilation lying "between 30°C and 56°C, 
while respiration increases in proportion to 
the temperature up to nearly the higher limit 
of plant life. 

There are,however, some physiological 
processes for which not only the optima are low, 
but which can take place only in winter, late 
autumn, and early spring, fhese, obviously, 
concern plants of temperate and higher latitudes 
only. Certain of these will be dealt with at 
length in connection with the reserve food 
materials of the plants of the colder zones. 

Low temperatures exert a favourable 
influence on the sexual organs and on the parts 
connected with them, in many plants of the tem¬ 
perate and frigid zones. A further quotation 

. 

from Sehimper Cl) is of interest at this point: 

n fhe cardinal degrees for the growth - 
and perhaps for the inception - of the primordia 
of flowers are often much lower than for the 
|growth of the vegetable shoots, so that the 
former are favoured by a relatively lower tem¬ 
perature, and the latter by a higher tempera¬ 
ture during development. It is well known 




that Crocus, Hyaeinthus and other perennial 
herbs do not send out flowers or inflorescences 
at a high tenperature, hut shoot out luxuriant¬ 
ly into leaf. Also in the forcing of fruit 
trees the temperature must he kept moderate 
before, and especially during the blossoming 
period. Ror the same reason many temperate 
plants seldom blossom in the tropics, for ex¬ 
ample most of our fruit trees,........Kurz 

found in the mountains of Burmah that increased 
coolness due to increased altitude expedited 
the blossoming of temperate plants such as the 
Rhododendron and Centiana but delayed that of 
tropical ones.” 

It has been observed that although there 
has been no lower limit of temperature recorded 
of plant life, yet, in many respects, low tem¬ 
peratures are fatal to the life functions of 
the individual when these temperatures are of 
considerable duration. It would be expected 
then, that plants would possess protections 
against extreme temperatures, but as yet our 
powers of observation have not enabled us to 
recognize any such protections. 






Attempts have been made to establish 
some distinguishing points between individual 
plants belonging to species growing respect¬ 
ively in alpine and temperate climates. Ac¬ 
cording to lindberg, mosses growing in Spits¬ 
bergen have shorter stems, more richly branch¬ 
ed; leaves which are more crowded, shorter 
and less pointed. Kjellman gives similar re¬ 
sults for plants of higher orders. He men¬ 
tions that Picea and some of the Ericaceae 
show the leaves broader and shorter. ?/arming 
(according to Schimper (l) ! observed in Juniper 
commtais, lycopodium aimotinum and 1. selago a 
tendency to bear leaves which are straighten, 
adpressed, and do not stand off from the stem 
as is elsewhere the ease, fhese modifications, 
however, have not been shown to depend only on 
temperature. 

On the other hand EJellman records that 
all contrivances which might be considered as 
protective against cold are wanting in the 
above-mentioned Cochlearia, which proved it¬ 
self so resistant to extremely low tempera¬ 
tures. In central Europe the absence of any 


































. 








15 


protective means is evident in all the meadows 
and fields during a frost. There, delicate 
plants such as Kellis perennis and stellaria 
media are frozen hard and brittle. When the 
thaw comes these plants continue to grow un¬ 
disturbed, despite the fact that during the 
cold periods they v/ere entirely unprotected 
by any external contrivances. 

Accordingly, as Schimper states, "We al¬ 
ways come back to this, that the freezing of 
\ 

a plant to death, or not, depends upon whether 
or not the condition of the protoplasm is 
such that its molecular constitution becomes 
permanently disorganized in consequence of 
the cooling, andthat the most effective pro¬ 
tection must be sought for in the constitution 
of the protoplasm itself # Since we do not 
know the constitution of the protoplasm, it 
is idle to puzzle ourselves in surmises about 
it, this only being certain, that the resist¬ 
ing capacity of protoplasm differs much from 
plant to plant, as well as at different times 
in one and the same plant." 





The process of assimilation, or the 
means by which a green plant manufactures 
organic compounds from inorganic substances 
through the agency of Chlorophyll in the 
presence of light and water, has been men¬ 
tioned above as one whose optimum temperature 
lies rather high, although extreme cases have 
been determined where certain plants Y/ere able 
to assimilate at a very low temperature, 
hence it follows that the greatest amount 
of organic food material possessed by the plant, 
is manufactured during the seasons of higher 
temperature and greater water supply, and that 
the plant is dependent upon reserve food fof 
the remainder of the year, during the period 
of comparative quiescence of its functions. 

The fact that plants in the temperate 
zones undergo definite periods of growth 
followed by a resting period has as its con¬ 
clusive proof the presence of the so-called 
"annual rings” in the woody perennials, here 
the wood is composed of a regular series of 
concentric bands, every pair of which repre¬ 
sents one year's growth, with the large thin- 













































' 































walled cells formed in the spring, and the 
smaller thick-walled cells of the autumn wood. 
The variation in the two kinds of wood is due 
to the smaller amount of reserve materials 
available to the plant for food in spring, 
while, as the season advances, temperature 
and the water supply increase, and with the 
resultant increase in assimilation^the char¬ 
acter of the wood changes. 

The phenomenon of leaf-fall of decidu¬ 
ous trees is a further demonstration of the 
fact that during the winter season the plant 
undergoes a rest period, so far as the pro¬ 
cess of assimilation is concerned, for with¬ 
out the chlorophyll present in the leaves, no 
fresh organic food can he manufactured. The 
assimilation mentioned above at the extreme¬ 
ly low temperature, referred to evergreen 
plants only. 

The exact products of assimilation and 
their sequence in formation have not as yet, 
been determined. Investigation at the present 
time is yielding startling results. Many 
listinguished plant physiologists are devot¬ 
ing themselves to research in this subject. 

























' 

















; and their latest results tend to upset, 

| materially, existing theories. 

Whatever may he the earlier products, 
however, it has been conclusively demonstrat¬ 
ed that the carbohydrates of most plants are 
transferred from one part to another in the 
form of soluble sugars, and stored in the 
insoluble form of starch. When required as 
food material the starch is changed into 
sugar again through the action of enzymes, 
and in the soluble form migrates to the part 
of the plant where it is required. 

In the summer, during the period of 
greatest assimilation the majority of plants 
show their starch content to be very high. 

If these plants are examined several months 
later, at the beginning of winter, it will 
be noticed that a great many, especially 
those of the high temperate regions, have 
lost their starch altogether, and on the other 
hand, contain a large percentage of oils and 
fats, another form in which food reserves 
are frequently stored, hence in many trees 
the starch is altered during the winter into 



fats, which are again changed to starch in 
the spring. Both these processes, according 
to dost (5),"have been seen to depend in a vari- 
able manner on temperature; low temperatures 
tend to produce the formation of fat, high 
temperatures starch." 

Since all trees do not undergo the change 
of starch to fats, but retain the former as a 
winter food reserve, they are generally divid¬ 
ed, especially evergreen trees, into two class¬ 
es, (a)"Starch" trees, whose reserve is stored 
in the form of starch, and (b) "Fat" trees, in 
which the starch is converted into oil during 

| the autumn. As this change is .only found 
associated with a lowering of temperature, 

the idea is at once suggested that this may 

* 

j in some way protect the protoplasm against 
extreme temperatures, fhis suggestion is 
supported by Warming (6) in the following 
statement: " fhe presence of oils and fats 
in the latter ("fat" trees) may enable the 
plant to withstand lower temperatures in that 
the fatty oil .in the form of an emulsion pre¬ 
vents the sub-cooling of the plant tissues 










and increases the power of resistance to frost. n 
The distribution of the two groups lends fur¬ 
ther support, in that IT 'fat M trees are largely 
distributed throughout the colder regions, while 
the "starch^ trees are found in localities of 
|higher winter temperature. 

Much attention has been given this pheno 
menon in trees but no information is available 
in connection with herbaceous plants. Since 
many evergreen herbaceous plants grow in the 
shade of the w fat w trees subjected to the same 
extremes of cold, it would seem possible that 
they should exhibit similar features. It was 
with a view to ascertaining a few facts in 
this connection that the following investigation 
was undertaken. My attention was called to the 
need for investigation in this direction by hr. 
iF.d.Lewis, to whom I am greatly indebted for 
helpful criticism and suggestions given through¬ 
out the progress of the work. 

The only recent investigation bearing 

V) 

on this subject is that of Ktiehi Miyakej^of Tokyo 
Ee confined his attention solely to the calcula¬ 
tion of the winter starch content of a number of 




21 


1 trees and herbaceous plants from different 
parts of Japan. The conclusion is reached 
that the starch content of trees in winter 
is very small compared with that during the 
summer, but that this content varied with trees 
of different species and also with the region 
from which the material came - that from 

northern Japan, where lower winter temperatures 

. 

occurred, showed less starch than that from the 
southern districts. Kuchi Miyake simply re¬ 
corded the starch content as he found it. He 
did not try to account for its variation* It 
would have been interesting to know whether 
part of this decrease of starch was due to the 
formation of fats and oils at the beginning of 
winter, but no mention is made of investigation 

in this direction. 

- investigation 

The following was undertaken not so much 

53 A. 

with a view to ascertaining the food reserve 
in a large number of plants as that of a single 
: one, Linnea borealis, var. Americana (I’orbes) 
Eehdner, and to investigate the changes which 
these reserves undergo when subjected to dif¬ 
ferent temperature conditions. 





22 


In view of the fact that temperature is 
vitally connected with the problem, a brief 
statement may be given of the meteorological 
conditions of the district. Early frosts are 
eharactic of Western Canada, occurring usually 

t 

from the 6th to the 10th of September - fre¬ 
quently followed by warmer periods. The pre¬ 
cipitation during September and October is 
usually high but varies considerably with the 
different years. The winter seasons are quite 
variable but the extreme temperatures remain 
the same from year to year, ranging from about 
-40°3? (-40°C) to an occasional 50°E (10°C) . 

The humidity of the air is moderately low and 
high winds are rare. The depth of snow aver¬ 
ages from one to two feet on the level. 

This season, however, has been unusual. 
Cold periods of five to ten days, in which the 
thermometer ranged from0 °w f-17°C) to -40 o I* 

1 -40 CJ, have alternated quite regularly with 
slightly longer periods of rising temperature, 
reaching on one occasion 47°E (S°C). As will 
be mentioned later, these fluctuations have 
been useful during the ptogress of the invest!-

gation, especially in connection with reconversion 

I,Preliminary Tests of Reserves . 

fhe work was commenced late in October, 

Just abotit the time of leaf fall of deciduous 

trees. A number of leaves were examined then, 

for their starch and oil content. Asolution 

of 

of iodine and another chloral hydrate and iodine 
were used in the tests for starch, the former 

I 

in the preliminary tests and the latter in the 
material during conversion as the chloral hydrate 
swelled the starch grains and also decolorised 
the sections thus making the reaction much 
clearer. For fats and oils, sections of the 
material were tested with a 1 % solution of 
Osmic Acid and also with neutral red solution, 
both tests yielding similar results.

tent of the majority of local plants which still 
retained their leaves.

II. Conversion of Oils and Fats to Starch , 

A series of experiments was then started 
to induce the formation of starch in the de- 
starchified plants. The following plants were 
brought indoors and subjected to higher tempera¬ 
tures - Linnea, Pyrola and Pie@a, The first 
two plants were potted, hut in the ease of 
Picea, shoots were kept in water. The experi¬ 
ments were kept in a dark room at a temperature 
of 68°P (80°C), and in each ease a control was 
placed in the dark outside ^at the lower tem¬ 
perature. 

The material of Linnea showed starch ap¬ 
pearing as early as the second day while Pyrola 
and Picea showed no increase, although allowed 
to remain at the higher temperature for five 
weeks. This points to the fact that different 
species vary in their response to the change 
in temperature. 

As linnea responded most readily to 
experiment, the following observations were all 
made from that plant. They are based on mater-

ial collected and potted at intervals of five 
or six days during November and December,1916, 
and January,1917. In each case the result 
was based on a test from six to twelve leaves. 

Table II. shows that material which has 
been inside for two days shows a starch reaet- 
ionin all parts of the leaf. At the end of 
four days the cells are quite crowded with 
starch but the amount increases until the se¬ 
venth or eighth day. (fig. 1), after which 

time the starch content seems to remain constant. 

, 

The starch in all cells is present in a 
very finely divided state and the individual 
grains exhibit Brownian movement to a marked 
; degree. 

It is interesting to note the large 
amount of starch in the epidermal cells of 
material undergoing conversion (fig.II.d as 
none is found there during the summer, when 
the starch is being formed as a product of 
photosynthesis - this apparently suggesting 
that the starch has arisen by conversion of 
oils and fats which are abundant in the epi¬ 
dermic during the winter(fig. JJp . It has

been observed that the starch grains are grouped 
as though each group had arisen from a single oil 
globule. 

ho regular variation in the conversion has 
been determined. Entire plants have been tested 
and it has been shown that they do not possess 
“fat” leaves and “starch” leaves - all leaves 
tend to form starch when exposed to higher tempera¬ 
tures. Eigure r$V.shows the test of three plants 
from material which had been exposed to higher 
temperature for four days. 

In this test, plants Ho.I and III. gave a 
strong reaction in all of the leaves but very lit* 
tie reaction was obtained in any leaves from 
Plant no. II. Phis may be due to the fact that 
the leaves were not so vigorous as those of 
Plants Ho. I. and III. Hence any variation 
seems to be due to some plants being more vigor¬ 
ous than others and also to the age of the leaves^ 
as it has been observed that younger leaves 
carry on the conversion much more rapidly than 
do the older ones. 

Ihe increase in the starch content of 
these leaves is mucn more evident than the de-

crease in the oils and fats which one would sup- 
ipose must he taking place, as that seems the only- 
source from which the starch can he derived, for 
the factor of photosynthesis has been eliminated 
by placing the material in darkness. All the 
leaves showing a large amount of starch, gave a 
strong reaction with the test for oils and fats. 

In horizontal sections passing through the epi¬ 
dermis there seems to be quite as much oil as 
starch present. The palisade tissue shows no 
appreciable decrease. It is only in the cells 
of the mesophyll that an actual difference has been 
recognized, here the decrease is quite evident as 
will be seen by comparing Figures ¥*■and 

III. Reconversion of Starch into Fats 

and oils . 

Having shown that starch appears in those 
leaves subjected to a higher temperature, it was 
then attempted to cause a reconversion of the 
starch to oils and fats by lowering the tempera- 
ture. Material of Linnea, which had been kept at 
68°F (EO°C) for a week and which showed as a re¬ 
sult. a high starch content, was placed outside in

darkness on two different dates, November 25th 
and December 13th. As will be seen from Tables 
III.and IV, the temperature conditions were very 
different during the two experiments. 

IProm Tables III.and IV. it is seen that 
material containing a large amount of starch under¬ 
goes reconversion in which the starch is changed 
back into oils and fats if subjected to moderate¬ 
ly low temperature. If however, the material, 
full of starch, and hence in a summer condition* 
be subjected to extremely low temperatures no 
reconversion takes place and the material is 
killed. The strong plasmolysis of the cell con¬ 
tents exhibited in this material is shown in 
Fig. VJI. 


IV. Cause of Conversion . 

The conversion of fat3 to starch is quite 
impossible as an unaided chemical change, and 
hence the action of an enzyme is suggested. 

Tests were made for the presence of an enzyme, 
both in material fresh from outside, and in that 
which had been exposed to a higher temperature 
for some time.

The test in this case, was an alcoholic 
solution of guiacum resin which, with the addi¬ 
tion of hydrogen peroxide gives a blue reaction 
in the presence of any enzyme. In enzyme tests 
made December 7th and 18th on fresh material no 
reaction was obtained. Material, however, which 
had been exposed to higher temperature for 
several days gave a strong reaction when tested. 

About a month later (Jan. 11-16) material 
in the same condition was tested which yielded 
rather different results. In the interval, 
however, the weather had modified and some very 
high temperatures had been recorded. All linnea 
leaves, both from outside and inside -cnen re¬ 
sponded very strongly to the enzyme test. There 
was an inclination at first to doubt the test 
but when leaves of Begonia and Geranium from a 
greenhouse gave negative results it was conclud¬ 
ed that the change in temperature must have af¬ 
fected the outside material - still the change 
had not been great enough to cause the formation 
of starch for the outside material gave no re¬ 
action to the iodine test. The effect of chang¬ 
ing temperature was watched and it was found that 



41 


the enzyme response diminished after a fortnight 
of lower temperature, although at that time a 
slight reaction was given despite the fact that 
the material was gathered when the temperature 
was lower than 0°Ffl7°C). 

The important point, however, was that the 
material undergoing conversion gave a strong en¬ 
zyme reaction* The next step was to determine 
whether or not this was due to the fat splitting 
enzyme lipase. The test applied was that used 
by Gr. J. Fowler (8) and Reynolds Green (9) in 
work with germinating Ricinus seeds, here the 
solution which is to be tested for the presence 
of the enzyme, is allowed to act on an oil 
emulsion causing, if lipase be present, the 
hydrolisation of the oil and the formation of a 
fatty acid. 

An extract of the leaves was made by 
grinding them in a mortar with a solution con¬ 
taining 5/6 sodium chloride and 0.2J6 thymol as as 

. 

antiseptic. This was allowed to stand for 
twenty-four hours and then filtered. The filtrate 
was treated as follows: An emulsion of olive oil 





42 


w ith a little gum arable was made and to this w s 
: added a small amount of the extract, phenol- 
thaleine being used as an indicator. As the leaf 
extract and oil emulsion were both highly acid, 
they were carefully neutralized with a few drops 
of very dilute caustic potash. Prom two to five 
experiment tubes were made up in this manner. A 
control was made up in a similar manner, except 
that the extract was boiled for two or three 
minutes before it was added to the emulsion. 

Both experiments and control were placed in an 
oven at 95°F (35°C). Table Y.gives the results 
of several tests for lipase in extracts from 
material of different conditions. The test 
made on January 9th shows that fresh material 
from outside, without exposure to higher tempera¬ 
ture, does not respond to the test for Lipase. 

It has been recorded earlier in the paper 
that material fresh from outside responded to 
the general enzyme test. Experiment of January 
9th in Table V. shows that the enzyme in fresh 
material is not Lipase - hence the presence of 
another enzyme is suggested. Owing to the 
browning of the leaf extract on standing, oxidases

were suggested. 

It was determined (8) that guiacum resin, 
without the hydrogen peroxide, was a test for oxid¬ 
ase alone and so this material was subjected to 
this test. Sections of the leaves, both fresh and 
converting, gave only slight reactions with the gui¬ 
acum resin,, but the extract gave a good response. 

This is due to the fact that, on standing, a sub¬ 
stance is formed in the extract which increases 
the oxidation (10). 

In the tests for Lipase given above, it will 
be noticed that phenolthaleine was used as an indic¬ 
ator instead of the litmus solution used by Reynolds 
|Oreeh in his experiments with extract form endosperms 
of ricinus. Litmus was used in early experiments in 
this work but it was found that the plant extract de¬ 
colorised the litmus directly it was added. This 
fact was a further proof of the presence of oxidases, 
as they cause an immediate deeolorisation of litmus 
solution. Hence Litmus was of no use as an indic¬ 
ator in the presence of oxidases, and so phenol¬ 
thaleine was substituted, with ¥/hose action they do 
not seem to interfere. 


The results of this investigation may 




45 


be briefly summarised as follows: 

1. Most evergreen plants are destarchi- 
fied in northwestern Canada as early 
as October, and then contain a large 
amount of oil. 

2. Exposure to a higher temperature in 

the case of Linnea induces the formation 
of starch in darkness. 

3. Starch is present in the material after 
two days and increases in amount until 
about the eighth day. 

4. The starch is in a very finely divided 
state and the individual grains exhibit 
Brownian movement. 

5. All healthy leaves are capable of carry¬ 
ing on conversion. The plant does not 
possess "fat” leaves and "starch” leaves. 

6. The starch disappears when again exposed 
to moderately low temperature for about 
eight days, but the leaves are killed if 
exposed to extremely low temperature when 
filled with starch. 

7. Adecrease in the oil content is evident 





in leaves which have formed starch by 
conversion. 

8. Enzymes are present in material under¬ 
going conversion. 

9. Lipase has been demonstrated in material 
undergoing conversion. 

10. Oxidases are present in the leaf of 

Linnea even at quite low temperature. 

The presence of Lipase and its action in the 
transformation of the oily reserves in certain 
seeds, at the time of germination, has been a fact 
familiar to plant physiologists for several years. 
The chemical changes taking place in the germin¬ 
ation of Ricinus, the castor oil plant, were re¬ 
ferred to above. But so far as definite inform¬ 
ation went, the presence of Lipase in plant 
tissues was confined to seeds. The similarity 
in the chemical changes probably led Sachs to 
formulate the following hypothesis, regarding the 
transformation of food reserves in processes other 
thanthat of germination, that in this, and other 
similar eases it may be a question of the 
gradual formation of ferments. To this Sehimper 
adds "An experimental proof of this suggestion 







Although confined 


has not yet been attempted.” 
to one single species, the piece of investigation 
reported above seems to give evidence of the fact 
that Sachs's hypothesis was not an idle one, but 
one which would amply justify further research 
in order that the metabolism of plant reserves 
might be more fully understood. 

From what is known then, of the action of 
low temperatures upon plant tissues, one is in¬ 
clined to draw the following conclusions. In 
the first place the effect of temperature is 
not evidenced directly on the plant tissues, 
but only as it is seen in the performance of 
the life functions, and that so far as is 
known there is no spot on the earth from which 
plant life is absolutely excluded b j reason of 
the thermal conditions. 

Yaried as are the temperatures in the dif¬ 
ferent zones, just so varied are the abilities 
of different plants to withstand them. T‘he in¬ 
ability or ability to withstand low temperature, 
so far as ?/e are able to discern, does not de¬ 
pend on external difference of structure as is 
the case with the regulation of water supply. 




Taut rather to internal variations. Primarily, 
it is the result of the variability in the 
structure of the protoplasm in plants of dif¬ 
ferent species, or even those of the same 
species which have grown under different cli¬ 
matic conditions. Secondary to this, one 
places the importance of food reserves. In the 
investigation above, the fact that Linnea 
borealis was not able to withstand low tempera¬ 
tures, when its food reserves consisted large¬ 
ly of starch, yields evidence of efficient pro¬ 
tection afforded by oily food reserves against 
the sub-eoolingof the plant tissues, and especi¬ 
ally of the protoplasm upon the vitality of 
which^the life of the plant depends..
