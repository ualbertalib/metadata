ABSTRACT 


The possibility ol reducing crude oil pipe¬ 
line pressure gradients by the addition of water to the 
flowing oil suggests the need for further fundamental 
knowledge on the flow characteristics of oil in the 
presence of water. 

The flow of three oils of viscosities 6.29, 
16.8 and 65.0 cp. in the presence of water was studied 
in a horizontal pipeline of 1.040 inches internal dia¬ 
meter. The densities of the oils and water 'were equal. 

Flow patterns were noted for a range of 
superficial oil velocity from 0.05 to 3*0 ft. per sec. 
and.a range of superficial water velocity from 0.1 to 
3-5 ft. per sec. with oil-water input ratios from 0.1 
to 10.0. At high superficial oil velocities oil formed 
the continuous phase and a ’water drops in oil’ regime 
was noted. At a lower superficial oil velocity a 
transition to 'oil in water concentric’ flow was ob¬ 
served followed by the flow patterns 'oil slugs in 
water’, 'oil bubbles in water' and 'oil drops in water' 
in which -water was the continuous phase. The flow 
patterns for the least viscous oi3s were similar; the 
patterns for the most viscous oil were similar to those 
of the least viscous oils at high superficial water 
velocities, but at low superficial water velocities and 
high oil-water input ratios a dissimilarity occurred in

that, for the most viscous oil, a series of flow patterns 
was obtained, with oil as the continuous phase. 

Pressure drop and holdup data were noted for 
the three oils at various superficial oil velocities 
for superficial water velocities of 0.1, O.J, 0.8, 1.8 
and 3»5 ft. per sec. The pressure drop data are presen¬ 
ted as modified friction factors based on the water 
properties. At low oil-water input ratios the modified 
friction factors were largely independent of the oil 
viscosity but at high input ratios much higher friction 
factors were obtained for the more viscous oil when 
this oil formed the continuous phase and was in contact 
with the pipe wall. 

Por a given superficial water velocity the 
holdup ratio was a maximum for the ’oil in water con¬ 
centric' flow pattern. This indicates a relatively high 
accumulation of water in the pipe for this flow system. 
At low input oil-water ratios the holdup ratio was found 
to be largely independent of the superficial water 
velocity.

INTRODUCTION 


A knowledge of the factors affecting the simul¬ 
taneous movement of crude oil and water in pipelines is 
important in the petroleum transportation industry. Water 
is often produced in large quantities with crude oil and 
although most of the water is usually separated from the 
crude oil under the influence of gravity at the wellhead 
storage tanks, the separation is not complete, particularly 
in the case of heavy viscous oils. The oil with the 
entrained water is then usually transferred by pipeline 
to the oil treating and refining facilities. When the 
amount of water produced with the oil is low wellhead se¬ 
paration equipment may not be justified and again the 
water is moved by pipeline with the oil. 

For many years the beneficial effect which accrues 
from the introduction of water in controlled amounts into 
pipelines carrying heavy viscous crude oil has been recog¬ 
nized. The introduction of water can reduce the pressure 
gradient along the pipeline and the power requirement ne¬ 
cessary to pump a given quantity of oil. Further practical 
knowledge and a proper scientific understanding of this 
phenomenon would be advantageous. 

In general two immiscible liquids have different 
densities and there is a tendency for them to stratify when 
flowing together in a pipeline. The greater the density 
differential the more complete is the stratification. In the 
case of oil and water, the oil usually has a density less 
than that of the water and forms an upper layer flowing

above the water. Stratified flow has been investigated by 
Russell, Hodgson and Govier (7) in a horizontal pipeline 
of one inch diameter. Pressure gradient data and holdup 
measurements were obtained for a white mineral oil of spe¬ 
cific gravity 0.834- and viscosity 22 cp. at 20° C. he 
pressure drop data were plotted as a modified Panning 
friction factor based on water properties versus a super¬ 
ficial water velocity. Three flow patterns were observed 
which were designated bubble flow, stratified flow, and 
mixed flow. Holdup measurements indicated that in the 
laminar region of flow the holdup ratio was a function of 
the liquid input ratio and the viscosity whilst in the 
turbulent region the holdup ratio was also a function of 
the superficial water velocity. 

Sullivan et al (8) investigated the upwards 
vertical flow of two phases (a reference phase of water 
and a second phase of air or oil) in pipe diameters of 
1.5 inches and 1.023 inches. The pressure drop data were 
presented as a friction factor plotted in terms of the 
superficial velocities of the two phases, pipe diameter 
and difference in kinematic viscosity of the phases. The 
holdup ratio was correlated with the velocities of the 
two phases, the densities of the phases and the pipe 
diameter. Although a density differential existed strati¬ 
fication did not result because the flow was vertical. 

Mention has been made of the possibility of 
reducing crude oil pipeline pressure drops by the addi¬ 
tion of water. The flow system which apparently is most

attractive from the viewpoint of pressure drop reduction 
is the concentric flow of oil and water. In this system 
the less viscous water forms a uniform film in the region 
of high shear rate next to the pipe wall. Russell and 
Charles (6) in a paper on the theoretical aspect of the 
problem analysed laminar stratified liquid flow between 
wide parallel plates and concentric laminar flow of two 
liquids with the same densities but different viscosities 
in a circular pipe. Por the concentric flow system equa¬ 
tions were presented for the flow rates of the two 
liquids, the pressure gradient and the poY^er requirement. 
The optimum factor by which the pressure gradient can be 
reduced was shown to be proportional to the viscosity of 
the oil when the oil viscosity is very much greater than 
the viscosity of the water. It was stated, however, that 
although the possible power savings are very large the 
concentric flow system would be difficult to maintain in 
practice where a density differential would tend to pro¬ 
duce stratification. 

Patents by Clark and Shapiro (3) and Chilton 
and Handley (2) deal with the commercial application of 
water to reduce oil pipeline pressure gradients. Both in¬ 
dicated that the water should flow as a film on the pipe 
wall but acknowledged the difficulty introduced by a 
density differential. Clark and Shapiro suggested that 
8-10% water provided an optimum pressure gradient reduc¬ 
tion vdiilst Chilton and Handley suggested that 1% would 
be more suited to commercial operation and indicated a

method by which the water could be introduced through a 
set of holes spaced equally around the pipe wall. 

The concentric flow system was also considered 
by Yuster.(9) He was concerned with the relative permeabi¬ 
lity of oil and water in porous media and derived flow 
rate equations, which were similar to those developed by 
Russell and Charles, for concentric flow in an idealised 
capillary system. 

Heavy crude oils have densities which approach 
the density of water and it was thought that much useful 
information could be obtained by an investigation into 
the flow characteristics of the idealised system in which 
the oil and water have the same density.

THEORY 


The relationship between pressure gradient and 
fluid flow rate for a single liquid flowing in a circular 
pipe is usually represented by the friction factor-Reynolds 
number plot where the Fanning friction factor is defined 
as: 


APdg 

f = -X.(1) 

2ALPV 


where AP _ p ressure gradient, lb f ,. per ft? per ft. 

d = pipeline diameter, ft. 

V = average fluid velocity, • ft. per sec. 

g = dimensional conversion factor, lb . ft. per lb«.sec. 
°c 5 m “ f 

jO = fluid density, lb^. per ft. 


and Reynolds number is defined as: 


Re = ^ ..... (2) 

where JJ = dynamic fluid viscosity, Ib^. per ft. sec. 

The simultaneous flow of two fluids is more 
complex and the friction factor and Reynolds number de¬ 
fined above cannot be used without modification. Russell 
et al (7) used the superficial water velocity instead of 
the Reynolds number and a modified friction factor based 
on the water properties. This convention will be adopted 
in the present study. A friction factor is defined as:

where f 

w

Av 

= density of water, lb m . per ft? 

\ 

= superficial water velocity, ft. per sec. 

fhe superficial.water velocity is the velocity 


the water would have if it alone occupied the pipe and is 
simply obtained by dividing the water flow rate (ft? per sec.) 
by the pipe cross sectional area (ftfO 

In two phase flow the relative flow rates of the 
two fluids is important and the input ratio, is defined 


as: 

Q V

R V = ~~ = ~ 

w 

where Q q 

= volumetric flow rate of oil, fW per sec. 


= volumetric flow rate of (water, fti per sec. 

V o 

= superficial oil velocity, ft. per sec. 


Since the densities of the oil and water phases are iden¬ 
tical in this study the input ratio is also equal to the 
ratio of the mass rates of flow. 

The holdup ratio, H p , is defined as the ratio 
of the input oil-water ratio to the in situ oil-water 


ratio.

In general, the holdup ratio differs from unity 


because the liquid in contact with the pipe wall tends to

EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT 


The pipeline., used in the present work, together 
with the subsidiary items of equipment and piping connec- 
tions.is shown schematically in Figure 1. Photographs of 
the pipeline are presented in Plates 1 to 5- Satisfactory 
pipeline operation was achieved with oil and water storage 
facilities, pipeline test section, oil and water separation 
equipment, a salt tower to dehydrate the recycled oil, and 
a combined heater-cooler for the oil. 

Control and measurement of the variables were ob¬ 
tained with rotameters for the oil and water flow rates, 
differential water and mercury manometers for the pipeline 
pressure drop, and simple volume measuring equipment for 
the in situ contents of the pipeline. 

In order to carry out the tests three oils were 
required with viscosities in the range 5 to 100 cp. but 
each with a density of 0.998 gm. per cm.' - the density of 
water at the flowing temperature of 25° 0. Commercially 
refined oils were available in the correct viscosity range 

but their densities were in the range 0.8 - 0.9 gm. per 
z 

cm. Consequently it was necessary to add a second liquid 
with a density greater than that of water to give the re¬ 
quired oil densities of 0.998 at 29° C. Carbon tetrachlo¬ 
ride with a specific gravity of 1.59 was selected on the 
basis of high density and reasonably low cost as the most • 
suitable liquid for the purpose. Other chlorinated organic 
solvents could.have been iised "but these were generally

less dense and much more expensive than carbon tetrachloride. 

However, the inhalation of carbon tetrachloride is 
a serious toxic hazard unless adequate precautions are taken 
in ventilation and in the confinement of vapour. Consequently 
the pipeline area was provided with its own exhaust system 
and care was taken to eliminate possible points of loss of 
carbon tetrachloride to the atmosphere. Care, in this respect, 
was particularly necessary during the measurement of the in 
situ contents of the pipeline. 

Three commercially refined oils Marco 1 GX, Wyrol J 
and Teresso 85, all supplied by Imperial Oil Ltd., were used 
as the bases for the three test oils. The test oil with a 
viscosity of 6.29 cp. at 25°C. was a mixture of Marcol GX 
and carbon tetrachloride; the test oil with a viscosity of 
16.8 cp. at 25°C. was a mixture of Wyrol J and carbon tet¬ 
rachloride and the test oil with a viscosity of 65*0 cp. at 
25°C. was a mixture of Teresso 85 and carbon tetrachloride. 

The properties of the commercial oils are given in Table 1 
and of the test oils in Table 2.

The test oil supply was contained in a 230 IJ.S. 
gallon tank containing a double propeller-type mixer dri¬ 
ven by a 0.25 horse power electric motor. Two 4-5 U.S. gallon 
drums containing the commercial oil and carbon tetrachloride 
although not shown in Figure 1, were mounted above the test 
oil storage tank and pure oil or carbon tetrachloride was 
gravity fed as required to maintain the density of the test

tallic gauge thermometers fitted into the recycle line. The 
water supply was contained in a 4-5 U.S. gallon tank fitted

through the rotameters and hence through the pipeline test 
section were controlled by operating by-pass valves on the 
pumps and valves on each side of the rotameters. Spring 
loaded cut-out switches were installed in the discharges 
of both pumps as a safety measure. These switches auto¬ 
matically switched the pumps off if the pressure rose above 
2 

40 lb./in. gauge. 

The metered oil and water flows were combined 
concentrically at the beginning of a 10 ft. long calming 
section by means of a nozzle where the oil was introduced 
inside the water annulus. A diagram of the nozzle is given 
in Bigure 2. 

G-ovier, Radford and Dunn (4) when concerned with 
two-phase air-water flow concluded that the mechanical de¬ 
sign of the injection nozzle did not affect the flow pat¬ 
tern and used a simple tee in their work. Hence it was 
assumed that the form of the nozzle would not influence 
the flow pattern in this study. However, since another pro¬ 
ject for which the pipeline was designed was the detailed 
study of the "oil in water concentric” flow regime, a nozzle 
was designed which appeared to give encouragement to the 
establishment of the concentric system. 

Pipeline Test Section 

The pipeline was supported in a horizontal po¬ 
sition by a wooden trestle constructed mainly from 2 in. 

4 in. timbers. The test section consisted of 28 ft. of 
1.04 in. I.D. clear butyrate pipe (Busada 210, supplied by

the Busada Supply Go. Inc.) with an approach calming sec¬ 
tion 10 ft. long. 

The possibility was forseen that the flow pattern 
would not become steady over the calming section and the 
pipeline was designed with three pressure tappings so that 
the pressure drop over the first and second halves of the 
test section could be compared. The tappings were drilled 
through brass couplings 12 ft. apart. However, the flow 
patterns were visually observed to become steady within 
the calming section. Consequently, throughout the tests, 
only the tappings at the ends of the test section were used. 

At the ends of the test section were 1 in. A.C.F. 
ball valves, the operating arms of which were .joined by a 
taut steel cable. This cable enabled the valves to be closed 
simultaneously in the measurement of the in situ contents 
of the pipeline test section. 

The measurement of the in situ contents necessi¬ 
tated a method of ejecting the liquids from the pipeline 
and into volume measuring equipment. The passage through 
the pipeline of a ’pig', which closely fitted the internal 
surface of the line, provided a fast, efficient method. A 
diagram of the ’pig' is presented in Figure 3* The 'pig' 
was introduced into the pipeline at a removable brass sec¬ 
tion, which was 8 in. long and situated immediately up¬ 
stream of the test section. Two such brass sections, which 
were identical except that one had a flexible air line 
attached, were manufactured. The section without the air

lipe was in place during pressure drop measurement and 
this section was fitted with union couplings which were 
machined on the inside surfaces to give a smooth passage 
to the flowing liquids. After the pressure drop had been 
recorded and the flow stopped the second section contai¬ 
ning the 'pig' was substituted into the pipeline and the 
'pig' pushed through the test section under air pressure. 

A'third ball valve was located upstream of the 
removable brass section. This valve was closed during the 
measurement of the in situ contents of the pipeline test 
section to prevent oil and water flowing from the pipe¬ 
line when the short brass section was removed. 

The pipeline was mounted on brass slides, one 
of whfch is shown in Plate 3? so that, with a flexible 
coupling bet T ween the pipeline and the separation unit, the 
pipeline was free to expand and contract under the influ¬ 
ence of ambient temperature. 

Separation Unit 

Economy necessitated the separation of the oil 
from the water and its return to the test oil storage tank. 
The oil and water separation unit consisted of a 200 U.S. 
gallon primary separator, a 45 U.S. gallon secondary sepa¬ 
rator, a 65 U.S. gallon brine tank and a salt tower. 

When a sufficient density differential exists, 
liquids separate readily under the influence of gravity. 

In order that gravity separation could be used to separate 
the oil and water a saturated brine(sodium chloride)

solution was injected by a centrifugal pump into the 
liquids leaving the pipeline test section. The brine in¬ 
creased the density of the aqueous phase and two liquid 
layers formed in the primary separator, the more dense 
diluted brine forming the lower layer. Some of this brine 
was recycled to the brine tank and the excess was run to 
waste; when the lower layer was diluted to such an extent 
that the density fell below about 1.10 gm. per cmf the 
lower layer was run to waste and replaced by a saturated 
brine solution with a density of 1.206 gm. per cm^ 

The upper oil layer, which usually contained a 
small amount of water dispersed as small droplets, was 
transferred to the secondary separator. A Moyno pump tak¬ 
ing suction on the secondary separator .transferred the oil 
through the salt tower to the test oil st.orage tank. 

The salt tower was necessary to remove the last 
traces of Yrater from the oil. The toY/er was six feet high 
and fourteen inches in diameter and the position of the 
point of introduction of the oil wels about one foot from 
the bottom. The salt bed weighed approximately five hun¬ 
dred pounds and consisted of two layers of coarse salt 
separated by a layer of fine salt and supported on a wire 
gauze lying on a strong grid. The tower Y/as flanged at the 
top said at the bottom to facilitate the removal of spent 
salt. The clean oil left at the top of the tower. The 
average oil throughput for the salt bower before it became 
necessary to replace the salt bed was estimated to be about 
500 U.S. gallons.

Temperature Control Equipment 

The desired flowing temperature of doth the oil 
and water was 25°C. The temperature of the oil was con¬ 
trolled by a simple unit in which the oil flowed through 
four 5/S in. copper coils 25 ft. long surrounded by hot or 
cold water. The oil was recycled until the desired tempera¬ 
ture was registered at the inlet to the unit. 

The water- temperature was controlled by adjusting 
the relative flows of hot and cold water into the storage 
tank. 


Control and measurement of the variables were 
obtained with the aid of rotameters for the oil and water 
flow rates, differential water and mercury manometers for 
the pipeline pressure drpp, and simple volume measuring 
equipment for the in situ contents of the pipeline. 

Elow Meters 

Large and small rotameters in parallel, all with 
interchangeable steel and plastic floats were used to meter 
both the oil and water flows. The large and small rotameters 
had capacities of approximately 21 and 5*7 U.S. gallons per 
min. and the minimum capacities of approximately 1.5 and 
0.3 gallons per min. respectively. 

Pressure Drop Manometers 

The differential pressure between any two of the 
tappings on the pipeline test section could be registered on

either a'water or mercury manometer. The method used for 
transmitting the pressures was similar to that by Russell 
et al (7). Mounted above the pipeline at the pressure 
tappings were splash pots, one of which is shown in Plate 3« 
Air was supplied to the splash pots through pressure re¬ 
duction valves. Each splash pot was fitted with a pressure 
gauge, a vent, a needle valve in the connection to the pipe¬ 
line and an air line to the manometer system. Catchpots in 
the air lines to and from a splash pot prevented oil or 
water being accidentally entrained in the air pressure reduc 
tion valves or manometer lines. Marks on each splash pot 
enabled the liquid to be,adjusted to the same absolute level 
in each splash pot. 

Hoidup Measurements 

The calculation of the holdup ratio necessitated 
a knowledge of the in situ contents of the pipeline. The 
'pig 1 shown in Eigure 3 was used to eject the liquids con¬ 
tained in the pipeline and the volumes of oil and water 
were measured in graduated cylinders.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


A description of the rotameter calibration and 
the calibration curves are presented in Appendix A. 

The pressure measuring equipment and rotameter 
calibrations were checked by taking pressure drop measure¬ 
ments for various flow rates of water and the test oils 
alone and comparing the resulting plot of the calculated 
friction factors against Reynolds number with the accepted 
curves. This comparison is presented in Figure A 4 of 
Appendix A. 

Experiments were made to study the flow of the 
three test oils in the presence of water over a range of 
superficial oil velocity from 0.05 ft. per sec. to 5*0 ft. 
per sec. and a range of superficial water velocity from 
0.1 ft. per sec. to 5*5 ft. per sec. For given flow rates 
of oil and water the flow pattern was noted, and the pres¬ 
sure drop between the extreme stations on the test section 
and the in situ contents of the pipeline were measured. 

An experiment is now described in detail. Flows 
of hot and cold water into the water storage tank were 
adjusted to give the required water temperature of 25 °C. 
The temperature of the oil was raised by recycling the oil 
through the heater. When the oil temperature reached 25°C. 
the oil was caused to bypass the heater and the density of 
the oil was checked using a hydrometer in a sample taken 
from the storage tank. Invariably the density was low(for 
example 0.995 gnu per cm? compared with the required value 



























.

of 0.998 gm. per cm?) "because of the loss of carbon tet¬ 
rachloride vapour. Carbon tetrachloride was added to 
produce the required density whilst the propeller mixer 
and the action of recycling produced adequate mixing and 
a uniform oil supply. 

All valves between the oil and water pumps and 
the primary separator were opened and the brine pump star¬ 
ted. The .oil and water pumps were started and flow was 
allowed through all rotameters until all air entrained in 
the lines was removed. Bypass valves and valves on each 
side of the rotameters were adjusted to give the required 
flow rates of oil and water. Visual observation indicated 
when steady conditions had been obtained and a note was 
made of the flow pattern. The period of time necessary to 
establish steady conditions was usually one to several 
minutes and depended on the flow rates. In general, the 
slower the flow rate the longer the time required to 
obtain steady conditions. 

To obtain pressure drop measurements the extreme 
pressure tappings were opened and the liquid levels in the 
splashpots adjusted to the same absolute level. Air pressure 
was used to balance the line pressure. The splash pots were 
then opened to the manometer system and a final adjustment 
made to the liquid levels in the splashpots. The pressure 
differential as registered by the water, or mercury manometer 
was then recorded. 

After the measurement of pressure drop the in situ 
oil-water ratio was measured as follows. The pressure tap¬ 
pings were closed and after checking the rotameters to

ascertain that the correct flow rates were being maintained 
the quick action valves, B and C (see Figure 1) were closed 
and the oil and water pumps stopped simultaneously. Valve A 
was closed and the section of pipe between valves A and B 
was removed, care being taken to confine the liquid content 
of the section in a small sump beneath the pipeline. This 
section was replaced by the similar section which contained 
the 'pig' and had the flexible air line attached. 

The drain valve D, the valve B and the air valve F 
were opened and contents of the pipeline discharged into a 
container containing 2000 ml. of concentrated brine solu- 
tion. The 'pig' was removed from the line at the same point 
as it was inserted by closing valves F and D and opening 
valve C and the air valve E. The original section between 
valves A and B was then replaced. 

After vigorous manual shaking the contents of the 
pipeline and the brine were alloY/ed to settle and subse¬ 
quently the volumes of'oil and water were measured in gra¬ 
duated cylinders. The in situ contents of the pipeline were 
thus determined and the in situ ratio calculated. 

Bets of measurements were made in this way, with 
periodic checks on the oil and water temperature until all 
the oil had been used. .Sufficient time was allowed for the 
oil to become substantially water-free and the level of the 
oil-brine interface in the primary separator was raised by 
the addition of brine. The oil was thus transferred to the 
secondary separator, from where the Moyno pump returned it 
through the salt tower to the storage tank.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 


Pressure drops were recorded for water and the 
three test oils flowing alone. The calculated friction 
factors and Reynolds numbers are plotted in Figure A4 of 
Appendix A. The data show good agreement with the theo¬ 
retical curve in the laminar region and with the Blasius 
equation in the turbulent region and it is assumed from 
this that'the calibration of the rotameters and the pres¬ 
sure drop measuring system were accurate. 

Flow patterns were noted for the flow of water 
with each of the test oils over a range of superficial 
water velocity from 0.1 to 3.5 ft. per sec. and a range 
of superficial oil velocity from 0.05 3.0 ft. per sec. 

Examples of the flow patterns are presented in Plates 6, 

7 and 8 and the flow regimes are indicated in Figures 4 
and 5 • 

Pressure drops and in situ oil-water ratios were 
measured for various superficial oil velocities at super¬ 
ficial water velocities of 0.1, 0.3? 0.8, 1.8 and 3*5 ft. 
per sec. Modified friction factors based on the.water 
properties were calculated from the pressure drops and are 
shown plotted against the input oil-water ratio in Figures 
7, 8 and 9? and against superficial water velocity in 
Figures 10, 11 and 12. 

Holdup ratios calculated from the input and in 
situ oil-water ratios are plotted against the input oil- 
water ratio in Figures 13? 14 and 15«

Flow patterns 

Photographs of representative flow patterns were 
taken for the 16.8 cp. oil and are presented in Plates 6, 

7 and 8. The three plates of photographs show the effect 
on the flow pattern of the oil flow rate at constant super¬ 
ficial water velocities of 0.1 ft. per sec. (Plate 6), 

0.682 ft. per sec. (Plate 7) and 2.04 ft. per sec. (Plate 8). 

The flow pattern obtained with high superficial 
oil velocities at a superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. 
per sec. is shown in Photographs 1 and 2 in Plate 6 where 
the superficial oil velocities are 2.27 and 1.36 ft. per 
sec. respectively. The water is dispersed as small drop¬ 
lets in a continuous phase of oil and this flow pattern is 
designated 'water drops in oil'. 

Reduction in the superficial oil velocity to 
about 1.2 ft. per sec. caused both oil and water to be 
present as continuous phases. Concentric flow, in which the 
oil formed a continuous core along the axis of the pipe and 
the v^ater a uniform layer on the pipewall, is shown in 
Photograph 3 for a superficial oil velocity of 0.454 ft. 
per sec.This flow-’pattern is designated 'oil in water con¬ 
centric ' . 

A further reduction in superficial oil velocity 
at a superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. re¬ 
sulted, in the oil phase becoming discontinuous. The oil 
flowed as slugs and, at lower superficial oil velocities, 
as bubbles. The 'oil slugs in w T ater' flow pattern is shown

for- a superficial oil velocity of 0.200 ft. per sec. in 
Photograph 4 and the 'oil bubbles in water' flow pattern 
is shown for a superficial oil velocity of 0.050 ft. per 
sec. in Photograph 5 * The small water bubbles entrained 
in the oil slugs in Photograph A- were due to a temporary 
roughness in the pipe and are not characteristic of the 
flow pattern. 

The effect on the flow pattern of reducing the 
superficial oil velocity at a superficial water velocity 
of 0.682 ft. per sec. is shown in Photographs 6 to 9 in 
Plate 7» At high superficial oil velocities the water was 
dispersed as small droplets, and an example of the 'water 
drops in oil' flow pattern is shown in Photograph 6 for a 
superficial oil velocity of 1.95 ft. pen sec. Reduction 
in superficial oil velocity again resulted in 'oil in wa¬ 
ter concentric' flow and an example is shown for a super¬ 
ficial oil velocity of 1.11 ft. per sec. The flow pattern 
is more disturbed compared with the concentric flow at a 
superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. The photo¬ 
graph shows that the oil-water interface is wavy and that 
some water is entrained in the oil. 

A further reduction in superficial oil velocity 
again resulted in 'oil slugs in water' flow and subse¬ 
quently 'oil bubbles in water' flow. An example of slug 
flow is shovjn in Photograph 8 for a superficial oil velo¬ 
city of 0.682 ft. per sec. and an example of bubble flow 
is shown in Photograph 9 for a superficial oil velocity 
of 0.200 ft. per sec.

The effect on the flow pattern of reducing the 
superficial oil velocity at a superficial water velocity 
of 2.04 ft. per sec. is shorn in Photographs 10 to 12 in 
Plate 8. At high superficial oil velocities the 'water 
drops in oil' flow pattern was again encountered. At a 
lower superficial oil velocity of 1.82 ft. per sec. the 
very disturbed form of 'concentric' flow shown in Photo¬ 
graph 10 was noted and a further reduction in superficial 
oil velocity gave the 'oil slugs in water', the 'oil 
hubbies in water' and the 'oil drops in water' flow pat¬ 
terns. At this superficial water velocity of 2.04 ft. per 
sec. it was difficult to differentiate between the slug, 
bubble and drop flows because for a given superficial oil 
velocity the oil was present as slugs, bubbles and drops 
of various sizes. An example, which is considered to be 
intermediate between slug and bubble flow is shown in 
Photograph 11 for a superficial oil velocity.of 0.682 ft. 
per sec. 'Oil drops in water' flow is shown for a super¬ 
ficial oil velocity of 0.200 ft. per sec. in Photograph 12. 

The photographs indicate that for the 'oil in 
water concentric', 'oil slugs in water', 'oil bubbles in 
water' and 'oil drops in water' flow patterns the pipe was 
always in a water wet condition. 

The flow pattern regimes are shown for the 6.29 
and the 16.8 cp. viscosity oils in Figure 4 and for the 
63«0 cp. viscosity oil in Figure 5 where the superficial 
ofLl and water velocities are represented on logarithmic

co-ordinates and single lines are drawn between the various 
flow regimes. The change from one regime to another was not 
well defined and the lines represent gradual transitions. 

The oil and water superficial velocities for which experi¬ 
ments were performed are plotted with the corresponding 
experiment number in both Figures 4 and 5 whilst the super¬ 
ficial velocities for which photographs were taken are 
plotted with the corresponding photograph number in Figure 4. 

The flow regimes for the least viscous oils are 
almost identical. The only difference occurs in the posi¬ 
tion of the boundary between the 'water drops in oil' and 
the 'oil in water concentric' flow regimes. The boundary is 
at a higher superficial oil velocity for the 16.8 cp. oil 
than for the 6.29 cp. oil. This could possibly be accounted 
for by the higher viscosity of the 16.8 cp. oil but the 
more viscous 65*0 cp. oil did not continue the trend. 

The flow regime boundaries tend to converge to a 
point represented by a superficial oil velocity of 3«5 ft. 
per sec. and a superficial water velocity of 10 ft. per 
sec. It is possible that at greater superficial oil and 
water velocities the flow is completely mixed and that 
this type of flow is an intermediate between the 'water 
drops in oil' and 'oil drops in water' flow patterns. 

The flow regimes observed for the 65 «0 cp. oil 
are shown in Figure 5* This oil behaved differently from 
the less viscous oils at low superficial water velocities. 

At low superficial water velocities a succession of diffe¬ 
rent flow patterns was obtained with the oil as the 



- 25 - 


continuous phase. The line PQ is the inversion line; for 
a given superficial oil velocity a superficial water ve¬ 
locity of less than that represented by the inversion line 
gave a flow pattern with oil as the continuous phase, 
whilst for a superficial water velocity greater than that 
represented by the inversion line flow patterns with water 
as the continuous phase were obtained. The boundaries bet¬ 
ween the regimes in which water was the continuous phase 
were almost identical with the corresponding boundaries for 
the less viscous oils. The regime boundaries are represented 
by dashed lines at low oil and water superficial velocities 
because the flow patterns were not well defined under these 
conditions. 

It is possible that the different behaviour of 
the 65.0 cp. oil at low superficial water velocities can be 
attributed to different interfacial properties of the oil 
when in contact with water. The most viscous oil was 
visually observed to spread readily on, and displace water 
from, the pipe surface whereas the less viscous oils were 
observed to maintain a definite angle of' contact with the 
pipe surface in the presence of water. As the first stage 
in ascertaining whether the interfacial properties of the 
three oils in contact with water were significantly diffe¬ 
rent the interfacial tensions were measured and this work 
is reported in Appendix D. Table D3 shows that the inter¬ 
facial tensions of the 6.29 and the 16.8 cp. oils in 
contact with w r ater were 44 and 45 dynes per cm. and 












> 



- 26 - 


that the interfacial tension of the 65.0 cp. oil in con¬ 
tact with water was 50 dynes per cm. these interfacial 
tensions are probably correct to within 5-10%. It is suggested 
that quantitive measurements of oil contact angles on the 
pipe surface in the presence of water would further illus¬ 
trate the apparently different interfacial properties. 
Different interfacial properties would not be surprising 
because the 6.29 and the 16.8 cp. oils were both-prepared 
from white mineral oils whilst the 65 .0 cp. oil was pre¬ 
pared from a lubricating oil containing anti-corrosion 
compounds. 

The flow patterns observed in this study are 
related to the flow patterns reported by Russell et al (7)• 
Russell et al in their study of the flow of oil and water 
of different densities noted three flow patterns: 

1. bubble flow, in which oil drops and bubbles 
moved along the top of the pipe. 

2. stratified flow, in which the oil and water 
flowed in two layers with a quiet interface. 

5 . mixed flow, which occurred at high flow rates 
and was a completely mixed type of flow. 

The bubble flow of Russell corresponds to the 'oil drops 
in water' and 'oil bubbles in water' flow patterns ob¬ 
served in the present study, fhe stratified flow corres¬ 
ponds to the 'oil in water concentric' flow pattern and 
the mixed flow to the 'water drops in oil' flow pattern. 

A circulation of oil within the bubbles and 
slugs was noted for the 'oil slugs in water' and 'oil 
bubbles in water' flow patterns. This movement is indicated

in Figure 6 for bubble flow. The arrows represent approxi¬ 
mate velocities relative to the average flow velocity. The 
direction of rotation of the bubble is probably dependent 
on the direction of a small density differential between 
the oil and the water. When the oil is slightly more dense 
than the water the bubble would tend to drag more at the 
lower surface of the pipe and rotate in the direction shown. 
A circulatory movement was also noted in the water phase 
between the bubbles or slugs of oil. 

Pressure drop data 

The pressure drops were recorded for the 6.29, 

16.8 and 65*0 cp. viscosity oils for various superficial 
oil velocities at superficial water velocities of 0.1, 

0.3, 0.8, 1.8 and 3-5 ft. per sec. The pressure drops 
obtained for the three oils are recorded in tabular form 
in Tables B2, B3-and B4. The reproducibility of pressure 
drop measurements was tested by recording three pressure 
drops in each experiment with the 6.29 cp. viscosity oil. 

The three pressure drops with the average pressure drop 
are given in Table B2 and, in general, the three pressure 
drop readings are in good agreement. Consequently only 
one pressure drop measurement was recorded in each ex¬ 
periment with the more viscous oils. The calculated 
modified friction factors based on the water properties 
are given in Tables Cl, 02 and 03. 

The modified friction factors are plotted against 
input oil-v\rater ratio with superficial water velocity as

parameter for the 6.29 cp. viscosity oil in Figure 7, for 
the 16.8 cp. viscosity oil in Figure 8 and for the 65 .0 
cp. viscosity oil in Figure 9* 

When a smooth family of curves was drawn through 
the data for each oil, the modified friction factors cal¬ 
culated for water flowing alone were given infinite weight. 

In general the data fitted smooth curves showing, 
for a given superficial water velocity, an increase in 
friction factor with an increase in input ratio. Difficulty 
was experienced in fitting a curve to the data at a su¬ 
perficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. for the 6.29 
and 16.8 cp. oils. Data were obtained for input oil-water 
ratios from 0.5 to 10.0 at a superficial water velocity of 
0.1 ft. per sec. and these data are not represented by 
curves which fit into the families of curves representing 
the data for the higher superficial water velocities. No 
data were obtained for input oil-water ratios less than 
0.5 at a superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. 
However, at an input ratio less than 0.5 a large change 
in slope must take place so that the curve can approach 
with zero slope to an input ratio of zero. No explanation 
is offered of the apparently anomalous behavior at a 
superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. of the 
6.29 and 16.8 cp. viscosity oils. The de,ta for a super¬ 
ficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. for the 65*0 
cp. oil show good agreement with the data obtained at 
higher superficial water velocities.

At low input oil-water ratios water was the con¬ 
tinuous phase and the modified friction factor curves for 
the three oils are almost identical. Hence when oil flows 
as the discontinuous phase the friction factor is largely 
independent of the oil viscosity. 

At high input ratios the data for the least vis¬ 
cous oils are similar hut the data for the 65*0 cp. oil 
show dissimilarity for experiments in which this oil was 
the continuous phase. The relatively high modified friction 
factors obtained for this oil are accounted for by the 
relatively high viscosity of the oil. 

Two more points are worthy of mention. First, 
the dip, at an input ratio of 4.0, in the curve for a 
superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. for the 
6.29 cp. viscosity oil coincides with 'oil in water con¬ 
centric' flow and indicates a relatively low pressure 
drop for this flow system. The dip in the curve for a 
superficial water velocity of 0.1 ft. per sec. for the 
16.8 'cp. oil is not so evident. 

Second, the friction factor for the 65*0 cp. oil 
at a superficial water velocity of 0.3 ft. per sec. and an 
input ratio of 2.0 was highly variable because the flow 
pattern continually changed from one in which the oil was 
the continuous phase to one in which water was the con¬ 
tinuous phase. 

The smooth families of curves given in Figures 7, 
8 and 9 were used to produce the cross plots given in

Figures 10, 11 and 12 where the modified friction factors 
are plotted against superficial water velocity with input 
oil-water ratio as parameter. The data for the 6.29 cp. 
viscosity oil are represented in Figure 10; for the 16.8cp 
viscosity oil in Figure 11 and for the 65.0 cp. viscosity 
oil in Figure 12. 

The similarity of the data for the three oils 
at low input oil-water ratios, and the different behavior 
of the 65.0 cp. viscosity oil at high input ratios is 
again evident. 

In general, the data for the least viscous oils 
are similar. However, for a given input oil-water ratio 
the friction factors for the 16.8 cp. viscosity oil are 
less than those for the 6.29 cp. viscosity oil. The 
difference is most apparent at input ratios of 4.0, 6.0 
and 10.0 and indicates that for these input ratios and a 
given superficial water velocity the pressure drop is 
less for the 16.8 cp. oil than for the 6.29 cp. oil. 
Although the more viscous oil would be expected to give 
the higher pressure drops the apparent anomaly is ex¬ 
plained by the existence of 'oil in water concentric' 
flow at higher superficial oil velocities for the 16.8 cp. 
oil than for the 6.29 cp. oil.

reproaucibility of the holdup ratio was tested by making 
two measurements in each experiment with the 6.29 cp. 
viscosity oil. The agreement was good and only one hold¬ 
up measurement was made in each experiment with the more 
viscous oils. The holdup ratios are shown as a function 
of the input ratio with the superficial water velocity 
as parameter for the 6.29 cp. viscosity oil in'Figure 13, 
the 16.8 cp. viscosity oil in Figure 14 and the 65.0 cp. 
viscosity oil in Figure 15. 

A holdup ratio greater than unity indicates an 
accumulation of water in the pipeline relative to the in¬ 
put ratio and a holdup ratio less than unity indicates an 
accumulation of oil in the pipeline relative to the input 
ratio. 

In general, the curves for the three oils are 
similar In that, for a given superficial water velocity, 
the curves pass through maxima which coincide with the 
’oil in water concentric* flow pattern. This indicates a 
relatively high accumulation of water in the pipeline for 
this flow system, and is explained since the water is next 
to the pipe wall and is flowing with a lower average ve¬ 
locity than that of the oil. 

The theoretical holdup ratio for laminar 'oil 
In water concentric* .flow is given by equation (8) as: 

M w 

E-p> = 2.00 + L —— (in situ ratio) 

A 

for/ A w = 0.894 cp. and Mo = 6.29 cp. and the in situ

ratio of 2.48 recorded in experiment 102: 

H r = 2.00 + 2^894. 2.48 = 2.38. 

R 6.29 

A similar calculation fory^o = 16.8 cp. and the 
in situ ratio of 3.07 recorded in experiment 202 gives a 
theoretical holdup ratio of 2.16. 

These theoretical holdup ratios compare with the 
values 2.11 and 1.66 obtained in experiments 102 and 202 
respectively. The difference between the theoretical and 
experimental holdup ratios is probably accounted for by 
the experimental flow systems not being perfectly concen¬ 
tric. A water annulus of varying thickness would tend to 
lower the holdup ratio. The laminar ’oil in water concentric' 
flow pattern was not obtained for the-65.0 cp. viscosity 
oil in experiment 302 . 

Although in general the holdup curves obtained 
for the three oils are similar the holdup ratios recorded 
at superficial water velocities of 0.1 and 0.3 ft. per sec. 
for the 65.0 cp. oil differ considerably from those for 
the less viscous oils. At these superficial water velocities 
the most viscous oil gave holdup ratios of approximately 
0.6 for the flow patterns in v/hich the oil formed the 
continuous phase. 

A general conclusion from, the holdup data is, 
that at low input oil-water ratios,the holdup ratio is 
less dependent on the superficial water velocity than at 
high input oil-water ratios. With one exception (experi-

CONCLUSIONS 


1. The flow patterns for the equal density 
horizontal flow of oil-water mixtures were found to he 
largely independent of the oil viscosity for the three 
oils of viscosities 6.29, 16.8 and 65.0 cp., although 
the most viscous oil showed dissimilar behavior at high 
input oil-water ratios. This was probably due to diffe¬ 
rent oil-water interfacial properties. 

2. At low input oil-water ratios the pipe¬ 
line pressure gradients were largely independent of the 
oil viscosity. At high oil-water input ratios the more 
viscous oil gave relatively high pressure gradients in 
the regimes of flow where the oil formed the continuous 
phase in contact with the pipe wall. 

5« Lor given superficial water velocities 
the curves for holdup ratio plotted against input oil- 
water ratio pass through maxima which coincide with the 
'oil in water concentric' flow regime. 

4. The anomalous behavior ox the most vis¬ 
cous oil at high input oil-water ratios was reflected 
in flow pattern, pressure drop and holdup ratio obser¬

1. Rotameter Calibration 


The oil and water rotameters were calibrated 


by weight-time measurements. Large and small rotameters 
were used for each liquid. Interchangeable steel and 
plastic floats were used with the large rotameters; only 
steel floats were used with the small rotameters. The 
calibration data are tabulated in the research notebook 
and are presented graphically in Figures 11, 12 and 13 
in which the flow rate (lb. per min.) divided by the 
rotameter reading is plotted against the rotameter rea¬ 
ding. 


The water rotameter calibration curves are pre¬ 
sented in Figure 11. The three curves represent: 

(1) the calibration of the large rotameter 
(56-10-B-1097/1-2) with the steel float 

(2) the calibration of the small rotameter 

(56-10-B-1097/3-4) with the steel float 
and (3) the calibration of the large rotameter 

(56-10-1097/1-2) with the plastic float. 

The oil rotameter calibration curves are pre¬ 
sented in Figures 12 and 13* The two sets of curves in 
Figure 12 represent: 

(1) the calibrations of the large rotameter 
(56-10-B-1097/1-2) with the steel float 
for the three oils of viscosities 6 . 29 , 


16.8 and 65-0 cp.

for the three oils. 

The curves presented in Figure A3 represent 
the calibrations of the large rotameter (56-10-B97/1-2) 
with the plastic float for the three oils. 

2. Measurement of Pipeline Diameter 

The internal diameter of the pipeline was deter¬ 
mined with calipers. The diameter varied between 1.028 and 
1.053 inches and thirty readings were averaged to give a 
pipe diameter of 1.040 inches. 

3. Check of Pipeline Operation 

The rotameter calibrations, the pipeline dia¬ 
meter and the operation of the pressure drop measuring 
equipment were checked by taking pressure drop measure¬ 
ments for the oils and water flowing alone. The pressure 
drops and calculated friction factors are tabulated in 
the research notebook and are presented here graphically 
in Figure A4 where the Fanning friction factors are 
plotted against Reynolds number. Also plotted are the 
curves f = ^ for the laminar region of flow and the Blasius 
equation for the turbulent region. Good agreement is 
evident between the experimental data and the accepted 


curves.

EXPERIMENTAL DATA 


















EXPERIMENTAL DATA 

The properties of the test oils and the 
dimensions of the pipeline test section are given 
in Table B1. 

The experimental data for the test oils 
flowing in the presence of water are tabulated for 
the 6.29 cp. viscosity oil in Table B2, for the 
16.8 cp. viscosity oil in Table B3 and for the 
65.0 cp. viscosity oil in Table B4. The tables give, 
for a given experiment number, the oil and water 
superficial velocities in ft. per sec., the pre- 
sure drop over the test section in inches of water 
and the in situ oil-water ratio. 

Experiment numbers begin with a one for 
the 6.29 cp. oil, with a two for the 16.8 cp. vis¬ 
cosity oil and with a three for the 65.0 cp. vis¬ 
cosity oil. 

The three pressure drops and wo in situ 
ratios, reported in Table B2, for the 6.29 cp. 
viscosity oil were recorded to test the reprodu¬ 
cibility of the measurements. The reproducibility 
Y^as good and only single measurements were subse¬ 
quently made for the more viscous oils.

MEASUREMENT OE OIL-WATER INTERRACIAL TENSIONS 



MEASUREMENT OE OIL-WATER INTERRACIAL TENSION 

The interfacial tensions of the three oils 
in contact with water were measured by the capillary 
method described by Bartell and Miller (1). The 
capillary was contained in one side of the U-tube 
shown in Figure D1. 


Theory 

The height, h, of rise of a pure liquid in 
a capillary tube of diameter I) is given by: 



where A = surface tension of the liquid, 

dynes per cm. 

p>- density of the liquid, gm. per cm? 

2 

g = gravitational acceleration, ft. per sec. 

Hence B = . . . Dl) 

hpg 

Now, with reference to Figure Dl, h Q is the 
height of the air-oil interface above the oil-water 
interface in the capillary and h w is the height of the 
air-water interface above the oil-water interface. If 
and are the densities of the oil and water 
respectively then a force balance, in which a zero angle 
of contact is assumed for the oil-water interface at the 
capillary wall, gives:

Experimental Procedure 

Pure water, pure benzene and the benzene-water 
system were used as standards to experimentally deter¬ 
mine the diameter of the capillary. The standards used 
in this determination are given in Table D1 and the 
results are given in Table D2. 

In the measurement of the oil-water interfacial 
tensions the U-tube was surrounded by a water bath at 
25°C. and burettes were used to feed the oil and water 
to the different sides of the U-tube. A cathetometer was 
used to measure the heights of the interfaces. The re¬ 
sults obtained in the measurement of the interfacial 
tensions of the three test oils are given in Table D5.
