PREFACE 


This investigation has been carried out as a project 
under the Robert TegLer Research Scholarship. The direction and 
supervision has come from the Department of Philosophy of the 
University of Alberta with the approval of the Committee on Gradu¬ 
ate Studies. The work has been made possible only through the 
kindly cooperation of a large number of officials of the Provincial 
Government, the City Police Court, and the Ft. Saskatchewan Pro¬ 
vincial Gaol. The Department of the Attorney-General granted 
permission to use such records as were necessary for the study, 
the Department of Public V/orks consented that the work might be 
carried on within the Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol, and Chief of Police 
Shute and Detective Inspector Sutherland gave us access to what¬ 
ever records were available in their departments. Thanks are due 
to the officials in each of these departments, and particularly to 
lit. Shaw of the City Police Identification Bureau, who did much to 
assist us in securing the necessary records. Especially would we 
express gratitude to the officials of Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol for 
their continual cooperation over a period of almost a year. Warden 
McLean made it possible for the investigator to live in the Gaol 
for a large part of the summer, and granted access to all of the 
gaol records that were useful in the study. He gave generously 
of ais time for discussion of the problems being studied, and the 
information and guidance thus afforded have proven invaluable. 
Deputy Warden Hill spared no inconvenience to make possible all 
the interviews that were desired, and similar cooperation was 
received from Chief Guard Pollard and his second, Mr. Herbert 
Holt. The kindness and courtesy of V/arden McLean, as well as his 

keen interest in the subject matter of the study, were reflected

in the treatment received from ail of the members of his staff, 
and added greatly to the ease and effectiveness of the work in 
this investigation. Carefal systematisation of the Gaol records 
makes information about the prisoners easily available, and the 
very smooth functioning of the daily routine throughout the whole 
institution makes it a pleasure to live and to work within its 
walls. The period of intimate association with the life of the 
gaol extending over several months and numerous visits before 
and since have given the writer a well-founded impression of a 
very efficiently administered public institution. 

This study was begun in the second half of the month of 
May, 1932, and was continued throughout the summer. During the 
succeeding university term a number of visits were made to the 
gaol, and the early part of January was spent as a further per¬ 
iod of residence in the institution. 

A portion of the information used in the study is based 
on interviews made by Dr. H. B. Smit^, Associate Professor of 
Psychology and Education of the University of Alberta. It was 
under his guidance that the project was planned and the methods 
outlined; and to his personal interest and assistance 1 owe a 
great deal. Gratitude is also due to Dr. 0. A. Barager, Provin-. 
cial Oommissioner of Mental Health, and to Dr. J. M. McAllister, 
Superintendent of the Oliver Mental Hospital, for valuable sug¬ 
gestions and advice, and for time spent in securing psychiatric 
reports of a number of the oases studied.

Introdaot Lon 

Alberta is a very young province, bat she already has q, 
crime problem of large proportions. Daring the year ending Septem¬ 
ber 30, 1931, criminal convictions to the namber of 16,000 were 
made by the Alberta law coarts. Daring that year 3508 men and 
women served sentences in the provincial gaols, 289 penitentiary 
terms were imposed apon Alberta people, and 589 javenile delin- 
qaents were convicted before the javenile coarts of the province. 

hage sum is spent by the Alberta people annually on the various 
public institutions necessitated by crime. Legal administration, 
police services, criminal courts, and penal institutions impose 
a much heavier financial burden upon our citizens than do all our 
facilities for formal education. 

The most alarming fact in connection with the present 
magnitude and expense of our crime problem is the very rapid rate 
at which it is increasing. During the years 1.926 to 1931 the 
total number of convictions for Alberta increased from 1579 to 
2187 per 100,000 of the population, an absolute increase of 38.1% 
in the ratio of convictions to the total population. Between 1921 
and 1931 the total number of convictions increased from 9834 to 
16,000, an increase of 62.7%. Daring the same period the popula¬ 
tion of Alberta increased 24.3%, so that the number of convictions 
increased almost three times as rapidly as did the general popula¬ 
tion. The more serious offences, classed as indictable, increased 
128.5%,an increase over five times as great as the corresponding 
increase in the total Alberta population. Such vastly dispropor¬ 
tionate increases in crime rates necessarily involve increasingly 
heavy financial burdens upon each individual citizen.. The present

unfavorable bueinesa and economic conditions call strongly for 
decreased expenditure in ail fields of public administration; but 
at the same time we are experiencing .an increase in crime which 
demands in turn a larger expenditure of public money. 

This investigation has been planned and carried through 
in order to secure a better understanding of what is involved in 
our crime problem in iilberta. The efforts expended have been 
based on the belief that a more scientific approach to crime prob¬ 
lems will lead us to a new methodology which will be both more 
effective and more economical than that now in use. 

The approach which has been accepted as offering the 
greatest contribution toward a truer understanding of the funda¬ 
mental principles governing crLme and its successful treatment is 
the study of the individual who becomes an offender against the 
law, not as an isolated individual, but in terms of the whole 
social milieu in which he has lived and in which he must find his 
future place. Such an approach does not provide a shortcut or an 
easy way. It involves an attempt to combine a knowledge of the 
best that modern psychology has to offer toward an understanding 
of human nature with an appreciation of the practical difficulties 
encountered in seeking to administer any system in our complex 
social order. It requires an attitude that carefully balances 
the good of the individual and the welfare of society, seeing 
always as an ideal the synthesis of the two. 

The method used is that of individual interviews, and 
the emphasis is on the attempt to understand the inner life of 
ea3h of the men as he is affected by his environment and as he 
The information obtained from the men concerning 


reacts to it.

thelr own criminal histories was carefuliy checked by means of 
official records, in so far as the limited extent of criminal re¬ 
cords in -dlberta made this possible, in regard to certain, other 
facts in connection with some of the oases objective verification 
of the reports given by the men was obtained from other sources. 
,Apart from the record of their appearances in court and their in¬ 
carcerations in various Oanadian gaols and penitentiaries, the 
largest part of the information given by the men during the inter¬ 
views was not objectiyely verified. It will be at once recognized 
that this fact places serious limitations upon the value and re¬ 
liability of the material thus acquired. Case histories dependent 
largely upon the subjective report of the individual concerned’, with¬ 
out adequate objective verification, must necessarily lack accuracy 
in detail and will indeed reflect throughout the mental viewpoint 
of the narrator. From the beginning of this investigation it has 
been clearly realized that the results would be of much greater de¬ 
pendability and value if it were not for tnis weakness in the method 
of securing information. But attention may well be drawn to the 
fact that for a study of this kind the subjective method of secur¬ 
ing information about individual lives does not suffer nearly such 
great disadvantages as one might at first anticipate. 

There are a number of considerations which offset the 
apparent•disadvantages of the reliance upon subjective narration 
as a method of securing case histories. In the first place the 
men studied were all gaol prisoners serving sentences. They 
were receiving punishment for their past misbehaviour, and in 
the opinion of most of them had reached the lowest stage in 
social (diaappr^ival^ Feeling that they had nothing left to fear 
they did not attempt to conceal the facts of their past lives, 





- 5 - 


bat were rather prone to tarn their attention to the past and 
to examine the series of events that had brought them finally to 
the ^eol. The majority of prisoners are lonely. Only those of 
duller mentality appear to be immune from the urge for companion¬ 
ship when they have spent even a short time’ in confinement. The 
desire for companionship is really a desire to share experience. 
’.Vhen prisoners are approached in a friendly way by one who seems 
to have no intent to harm, and are drawn into discussion of their 
personal feelings and reactions in a way that is not common in the 
world in which they ordinarily live, it is natural that they seek 
to share their past experiences. It pleases them to do so. The 
interest shown by the interviewer strikes a responsive chord in 
their often socially starved natures, and with men of the type 
constituting the majority of the group in Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol, 
the natural thing is to relate those past experiences in the way 
in which they seem to them to have happened. It is certainly the 
way in which experiences seem to them to have happened that they' 
relate: and the way in which they see or interpret events may 
be, and usually is, quite different from the actual objective 
events. But for an understanding of the place that any experience 
plays in an individual life it is the interpretation given to that 
experience by the individual concerned which is the important 
thing. Hence in seeking to understand the careers of these prison¬ 
ers in the light of their past environment and experience, it is 
their interpretation of that environment and that experience which 
offers the most valuable approach, ^s long as the investigator 
is continually aware that what he is receiving from his narrators 
is subjective interpretation and not historically accurate enum- 





- 6 - 


eration of details, the method of approach has very real value 
for an understanding of the influences and the motives which have 
made ihe individuals .vhat they are. 

In further regard to the reliability of the information 
obtained, it ma^ be observed that the largest part of the mater¬ 
ial came either spontaneously or in response to questions which 
were not of such a nature as to present reasons for false replies. 
Iho prisoners see no reason for supposing that harm will befall 
them on account of what they relate in regard to their homes, 
their school life, or their early occupational experiences. 

Human beings, with the exception of very abnormal people, do not 
lie deliberately unless there is some reason for doing so. As far 
as the largest number of the questions used in this study are con¬ 
cerned, there was no obvious reason why the prisoners should seek 
to give untrue answers. Very significant in regard to this ques¬ 
tion of reliability is the fact that it was the group of questions 
about which prisoners would be most naturally expected to evade 
the truth, that objective evidence was available, namely in re¬ 
gard to the record of past court trials and sentences imposed. 

On this section of the subject matter respecting which we should 
expect to find the truth most difficult to obtain, there was a 
very high degree of correspondence in the cases of the majority 
of recidivists between the accounts given by the prisoners and 
the records furnished by the police courts and gaols. This 
furnishes a strong reason for accepting the life histories of 
the prisoners as, on the whole, reliable accounts of their ex¬ 
periences as interpreted by themselves subjectively. 





- 7 - 


There are seme otner phases oi* a prisoner’s story about 
which it might be expected dirricult to discover the truth. 
Instances are criminal records o! the family, and bad habits of 
ether members of the family or of the individual concerned. The 
figures summarizing statements of the men concerning these things 
must be considered to represent something less than the complete 
truth, yet they seem to the writer to constitute a larger 
proportion of the whole truth than might at first appear likely. 
Cur report of the mental ability and the education of the men 
studied shows them to be on the whole of dull mentality and of 
limited general ability. Mental dullness is usually accompanied 
by dullness of feeling and of both moral and aesthetic sensib¬ 
ility. The act of revealing bad habits and family criminal records 
does not cause sensitiveness of feeling among the men of the gaol 
group in as great a measure as among men who have not had court or 
gaol experience. Sven police records and gaol terms are almost a 
normal part of the life of a large number of the prisoners, and 
such men are much more casual in their references to court charges 
and gaol terms than would be expected by one who is not familiar 
with the world in which tnese men live. The same principle 
applies in regard to personal habits. Embarrassment when mention¬ 
ing illicit sex experiences, for exam|)le, was obvious in only a 
few cases. These things are a part of their daily lives and 
their casual conversations. The degree of mental dullness and 
the low moral standards which were found among the majority of 
the men are such that they feel no reticence in speaking of 
things which are seldom mentioned openly in "respectable” circles. 
Hence, in spite of a more lax standard of veraoitj?-, these men

are not as Likely to deliberately oonoeal supposedly unpleasant 
facts concerning their past experiences as is the average citizen 
who has a concern for his standing among fellow-citizens. 

It must be born in mind in considering the reliability 
of the case histories that the present investigation was carried 
out in a provincial gaol, where the maximum sentence served is 
less than two years. This means that the men studied are not 
those who have committed the most serious offences, and are 
therefore less likely to be of the kind who, because carrying 
out a deliberate policy of crime, make statements only with 
guarded watchfulness and deliberate purpose. Because of the 
large number of petty offences for which terms are served in 
provincial gaols it is a reasonable expectation that the aver¬ 
age intelligence level of the prisoners is lower there than in 
a penitentiary. The prisoners of duller mentality are less a- 
ware of any reasons that may exist for falsifying their stories. 

ilpart entirely from deliberate desire to oonoeal or per¬ 
vert the truth, there is bound to be inaccuracy in some of the 
facts given by the men concerning their earlier lives, especially 
when many years have intervened. Wherever it was felt that the 
facts as given could not be relied upon for approximate accuracy 
they were omitted from consideration in the compilation of the 
tables and summaries. That part of the material which was used 
includes statements of the ages of leaving, school, of entering 
employment, and of beginning certain habits. Particularly in 
the case of older men it is recognized that many of these ages 
and dates represent approximations rather than precisely accurate 
figures. It is felt, however, that in the material actually used

the errors are saffiolently few in number and small in proportion 
to the population interviewed to oanoei each other according to 
the law of averages, so that the facts given in the summaries 
and conclusions centre closely about the truth. 

^ word is in order here o. the value of such an invest¬ 
igation conducted in iilberta on a acale that is relatively 

small. There have been a number of studies made in recent years 
in both England and the United States in the same field as that 
with which this project has been concerned, and many of them have 
been considerably more extensive and more thorough. I.Iany general 
principles hitherto unrecognized, concerning the causes and treat¬ 
ment of delinquency have come to be accepted by students of this 
subject in consequence of the facts revealed by the several 
scientific investigations. But there are a great many phases 
of the problems involved upon which no agreement has been reached, 
and the most advanced of the investigators have looked upon their 
work as merely an introduction to what may yet be done by way of 
understanding anti-social behaviour and of placing our treatment 
of it on a more scientific and effective basis. There have al¬ 
ready been discovered many principles that can be safely accepted 
as of much greater soundness than many of our earlier ideas con¬ 
cerning cr Lme and punishment, and if they were actually put into 
practice they would render our Judiciary and our whole social 
organisation much more effective. But administration has lagged 
far behind scientific knowledge, in this field as in many others. 
There are obvious reasons: the general public is slow to accept 
new ideas, especially on matters which have been assumed to lie 
entirely within the sphere of untrained common sense; legislators

and administrative officials find it easier to oontinae doing 
things in the traditional way than to inaugurate changes, and, 
perhaps strongest of ail reasons, the needed changes necessitate 
immediate expenditure of money, and it is very difficult for the 
tax-paying public or the economy-driven administrator to recognize 
that a more efficient method will be m)re economical on the whole 
and in the long run even though it does require larger expenditure 
at the moment. But it is urgent, nevertheless, that research 
should go forward, that the public should be gradually educated 
to new methods, and that well-founded facts be obtained upon which 
to base our thinking on the matters of practical social organiza- 
t ion . 

limong the general principles that study has revealed are 
many which can very well be taken into account in future social 
legislation in any country or on any continent, but the most dif¬ 
ficult problems are those which concern the details that vary in 
every locality. Alberta has her own characteristic problems 
which cannot be answered by any amount of research in London or 
Chicago. It is essential to the future social welfare of the 
people of Alberta that careful scientific study of our social 
problems be carried forward just as rapidly as the supply of 
funds and of trained workers will permit. It is from objective 
field studies of the immediate local situation that the most 
useful and immediately practical knowledge will come, provided 
such detailed and close-range studies are seen in relation to 
studies made at other times and places, and interpreted in the 
light of the^ longer historical trends. The present investigation 
is fully recognized to be but a mere beginning in this direction* 







-li¬ 


lt is hoped that it will prove valuable in indicating methods 
that may be used and results that may be achieved by I'urther 
research in the field of Albertans very real social problems. 

The subject matter of this report necessarily includes 
some discussion of the present institutions by which this 
province seeks to deal with those who offend against its raws. 
That discussion inevitably involves some criticisms of these 
institutions, some indications of weaknesses, and some Judgments 
of ineffectiveness. ?7e wish it to be understood that tnese 
criticisms are directed toward tne institutions and not toward 
the individuals who happen to be responsible for their administ¬ 
ration. Where weakness and inefficiency exist, and they certainly 
do exist, the blame lies with every citizen of the province who 
does not interest himself in knowing the facts involved and in 
attempting to improve the means by which our society deals with 
those of its members who fail to live within it harmoniously* 

The aim of this report is to set forth such facts as the 

investigation has brought to light, together with a discussion 

of the bearing of these facts upon Alberta’s policies of dealing 
with 

''offenders and upon her social problems in general. Chapter I 
presents an analysis of tne sample group of prisoners in 
Saskatchewan Gaol whose life histories were studied, without 
seeking to relate the various factors of life and background to 
the delinquency of the individuals concerned. Chapter II is a 
collection of some half dozen life stories presented for the 
purpose of depicting a number of the factors most common in the

Lives of these men in their aotual setting as parts of continual 
life processes. Chapter III attempts to analyze some of the 
factors contributing to the delinquency of the men studied, and 
to indicale certain relationships between the various factors. 
Chapter IV discusses the present method of treatment and its 
effect upon the offender. Chapter V presents a discussion of 
such changes in the treatment of anti-social conduct as seem on 
the basis of this study to be desirable in Alberta. Chapter VI 
discusses the relationship of the problems touched upon in this 
study to the larger issues of our whole social organization, and 
the bearing of public opinion and public attitudes upon our 
general social problems and our progressive treatment of them.

OHAPTKR I 

AU AIUI.YSIS OF iHF OAOL P0PULATI01\I 
The analyses of the gaol population presented in this 
chapter are based largely upon the data oolleoted in the inter¬ 
views with one hundred and twenty-nine prisoners during their 
terms in the Ft. Saskatchewan Graol. The conclusions are sub¬ 
ject to the qualifications set forth in the preceding pages 
concerning the methods of securing the data and the limited 
means of verifying the data so secured. It is believed, how¬ 
ever, that the summaries presentea in this chapter give a 
fairly accurate picture of the personality types and the back¬ 
ground of the general population of the Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol. 

It will be noted that the information as set forth in 
tabular form does not, in all oases, include data for the total 
number of men studied. There are tv7o main reasons for this 
limitation. The method chosen for the interviews was that of 
informal and natural conversation rather than that of a routine 
gathering of answers to a stereotyped list of questions. The 
field covered was more or less uniform in most of the oases, 
but the method of procedure was in each case adjusted co the 
individual being interviewed, in the belief that such a manner 

of procedure was likely to yield mors accurate information as 
as 

well'^a greater understanding of the individual life. Further¬ 
more the system used limited the time of the interviews in the 
majority of oases to one half iay, and when occasionally points 
of especial interest took a good deal of the time, other phases 
of the life story were necessarily dealt with in less detail. 

The result was that while the questions considered of major 





-L4- 


interest were answered in ail oases, there were a large number 
of less significant questions to which answers were given by 
fewer than the totai number interviewed. The second reason 
for the incomplete number of answers is that in oases wj.ere 
the statements made seemed of doubtful accuracy they were dis¬ 
carded for purposes of tabular sunimaries. 

The material presented in this chapter concerns the 
general factors in the personal lives and environments of the 
men. The relation of these factors to the crime experiences 
of the various individuals is considered in Chapter III, 

Home Environment 

The first and most important factor in the individual 
life is the nome. This section, therefore, presents the in¬ 
formation collected concerning the home bacKiground of the men • 
in the group studied. In addition there is used in connection 
with some points information drawn from the gaol records of 
the men imprisoned there during the twelve months ending Llarch 
51, 193£. Comparisons are made also between the group studied 
and the general population of Alberta in oases where the cor¬ 
responding figures for the general population were available. 

Information Concerning iiirthplace .- Data concerning 
the birthplaces of the men studied, together with that concern¬ 
ing the birthplaces of the parents in the case of those born in 
Canada, are summarized in the following table. Where one parent 
was born outside of Canada the parentage is here classified as 
non-Canadian. Only 1E6 of the 129 oases studied are listed 





here as there was uncertainty with regard to the birthplaces of 
the parents in the remaining three cases.

Of more direct value is a comparison of the birthplace 
distribution of the gaol population with that of the general 
population of Alberta. The following table places in parallel 
columns the birthplace distribution of three groups: the 126 men 
of the sample group studied, ihe 1168 men who were admitted as 
prisoners to the Gaol during the year ending I,larch 21, 1932, and 
the general population of Alberta as given by the 1921 Dominion 
census. It is assumed that the percentage distribution of the 
general population has not changed greatly since 1921.

The comparison or the birthplace distribution oi* tne gaol 
population with that or the general population yields valuable 
inrormation. Support is given to the conclusion often drawn 
from casual observation or court proceedings that inuaigrants 
rrom Europe contribute more than their proportionate share to 
the gaol population or Alberta. Only 1^.^% of the total popul¬ 
ation of Alberta, according to the ly^l census, were born In 
Continental Europe. Yet this small portion of the total 
population contributed thirty-five per cent to the gaol popul¬ 
ation. The group maKing the second largest contribution to the 
gaol population in proportion to its share in the general 
population is the group born in the British Isles. Next comes 
the group born in the United States, and lowest in proportionate 
contribution to the population or the gaol is the Canadian-born 
group. 

The extent to which European ir:imigration contributes to 

the population of the gaol is only partially expressed by the 

figures of the above table. Of the Canadian-born group a 

large number have been raised in foreign settlements in this 

country, or in homes in which a European language, and, to some 

extent, European customs have persisted. The percentage of 

gaol 

such cases in the entire'^population is not Icnovm, but approximate 
figures have been compiled for the sample group of 12b men. Of 
the eighty-three men of the sample group who were born in Canada 
or in the United States, twenty-one, or more than one fourth, 
were of families of which at least one parent was European in

origln. There is reason to believe that in the total gaol group 
the proportion among the Canadian or ^\merican born v/nose parents 
were European is greater tnan in tne sample group, lor the reason 
tna-c in selecting cases I'or stuay, tnose prisoners wnose conimancL 
or English was reported by tne gaol omcials to be very limited 
were excluded on account or the presumed dirriculty or con¬ 
versation. Even assuming the ratio to be the same in the total 
population as in the sample, we would have 14^ or tne men born 
in Canada and the United States who could be expected to have 
had European parents. This number constitutes 12.of the total 
population of the gaol. Adding to this figure the actually 

born in Europe, we have 47.>7* of the gaol population coming 
from European homes. 

French-Canadian Parentage .- There is another group 
besides that of European origin in which the home has failed 
to provide unity of language and cultural influence. Eleven 
or the men studied, or ?;ere found to be from homes in 

which at least one of the parents was of French-Canadian stocic. 

In only five of these cases were both parents of the same 
nationality, so that in over hair of the families represented 
there was a dual tradition of nationality and language. In all 
or these eleven cases tne individual had lived in a world that 
used both the English and tne French language, and that combined 
two cultural traditions. 

Bilingualism in the Home .- Thirty-three of the group 
studied, or 2^.6fo, came from homes in which a language other 
than English was commonly used during their childhood. In 

most cases this meant that the boy was forming his

formed the basis for estimates of the general level of the edu¬ 
cation of the parents in eighty-nine oases.

The parents who are here classed as having had very 

little education had in most instances left school at an early 

age. Some had not attended school at all. Those rated as 

having had a fair amount of education had for the most part 

left school from the upper intermediate grades, or were Judged 

to have the equivalent of from five to seven years of schooling. 

Those credited with a good amount of education were those who 

had completed at least the eight grades of'public school. Very 

hnd 

few of the men reported that their parents had^any education 
beyond high school.

Looation of Home .- In one hundred oases the men were 
definitely classified as having lived daring their ohildhood in 
cities, in towns, or on farms.

The hundred men classified above had spent all of their 
childhood, or the major portion of it, in homes located as shown. 
The others of the group studied could not be so classified. Some 
had moved from a farm to the city, others had moved from city to 
farm, and stiLI others had lived sometimes in a town and sometimes 
in a city. 

The table following presents a comparison of the urban- 
rural distribution of the homes of the gaol group with that of 
the general Alberta population. Those of the gaol group whose 
homes were in towns or cities are grouped under Urban, and for 
the general population the classification of the Dominion Census 
of 1931 is used, including under urban those living in towns, 
cities or incorporated villages.

The above comparison shows that the urban population 
contributes considerably more than its proportionate share to 
the population of the gaol. Although constituting only 38.1^5 
of the total population of the province, urban centres furnished 
the home environment of 53^^ of the gaol group studied. 

Occupation of Parents .- The occupations as classified 
below are largely those of the fathers. In a very few oases 
the wage-earner had been the mother. Only 123 of the 129 oases 
studied are tabulated according to the occupation of the parent. 
In most of the other cases the subject did not know his father 
because of the early removal of the, latter from the home by 
death or separation, or because of the early departure of the 
subject from the home.

The above classification is based on the definitions of 
skilled, semi-skilled, and unskilled furnished by Professor 
John LI. Brewer, Birect'or of Vocational Guidance of the Graduate 
School of Education, Harvard University, and quoted by Glueck 
and Glueck in ’’Five Hundred Criminal Careers”. (Page 114, foot¬ 
note.) The unskilled laborer does work which requires no train¬ 
ing at all; the semi-skilled laborer uses tools and processes 
which require a short period of learning, probably three days 
to three months; and the skilled laborer does work which requires 
a year or more of training for the acquisition of the necessary 
skill. 


Church Attendance .- The statements of the men as to 
the church attendance of ^heir parents are summarized in the 
following table.

The percentage of regular ohurch attendance is seen to 
be much greater for the mothers than for the fathers. Averaging 
the figures for the two groups we find that 55.6^ of the total 
group are regular attenders at church. An additional 27.8^ 
belong to the group of occasional attenders. Of this group 
the proportion of men is nearly twice as great as that of women 
(36.3';^ men and 19.37o women). The group who do not attend church 
at all constitutes 16.6^ of the whole group of parents. Of 
these again the percentage of men is much greater than that 
of women. 

Religion of Parents. - The religious faiths of the 
parents, with ‘Che percentage distribution for fathers and mothers 
separately and as a total group, are given below. The heading 
"Greek” includes both Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic.

The percentage of those olaiming the respective faiths 
is almost the same for the mothers as for the fathers. There 
were very few cases in which the religion reported for the 
father was different from that reported for the mother, except 
among the various Protestant denominations, in whioh”mixed” 
marriages are, of course, common. In at least one of the homes 
concerned, a marriage between a Protestant and a Roman Catholic 
led to the dropping of religion so completely that the child¬ 
ren were not introduced to the church in any way. 

The following table presents in parallel columns, as 
percentages, the religious affiliations of the parents of the 
men in the group studied, those of the entire gaol population 
during one year, and those of the general population of Alberta.

It will be noted that it is the religion of the 
parents which is given for the sample group studied, and 
that the total of 199 is the number of parents for which this 
information was given. The religions listed for the larger 
gaol population are those which were given as their own re¬ 
ligions by the total number of prisoners entering the gaol 
during the year ending March 31, 1932. The distribution of 
religions for the general population is compiled from figures 
given in the Canada Year Book for 1932, based on the 1931 
census. 

The table- makes it clear that the number of Roman 
Oathoiics and those of the Greek Orthodox and Catholic faiths 
is much larger among the gaol population than their representa¬ 
tion in the total population would justify. In connection 























-£ 6 - 


v;Lth this fact should be considered those facts previously 
presented as to the nationalities of the gaol population. It 
was seen that the group most heavily represented among the 
pris'oners in proportion to its percentage of the total Alberta 
population was that group originating in Central Europe. It 
seems to be true that in the majority of the countries from 
which these immigrants come the percentage of Protestants is 
less than it is in the countries whose populations are less 
adequately represented in the gaol. It is possible that this 
weighting of the nationalities may be a factor sufficient to 
account for the smaller proportion of Protestants among the 
prisoners than among the general population. 

It will be noted that Table X show's a larger per¬ 
centage of Protestants and a smaller percentage of those of the 
Greek faiths among the sample group than among the gaol group 
as represented in total for one year. This disparity is ob¬ 
viously due to the weighting of the sample to include a 
larger proportion of those of English stock than of those 
originating in Continental Europe. The purpose of the we ight- 
ing as indicated at the beginning of this chapter was to avoid 
the language difficulty involved in obtaining case histories 
from those of immigrant stock whose command of Eiiglish was 
not good. One of the results seems to have been to include 
in the group studied a larger proportion of Protestants than 
is found in the gaol population as a whole. 

Habits of Father. - The information obtained concern¬ 
ing the use of liquor and of tobacco by the fathers of the men 
is summarized in the following tables.

It appears that 

the fathers of two- 

-thirds of our group 


were addicted to the use of liquor either moderately or in ex¬ 
cess, and that the fathers of almost four-fifths of these men 
were users of tobacco. Jdo figures are available for comparison 
with the general Alberta population, but it seems that the 
prisoners studied have come from homes in which the proportion 
of fathers using liquor and tobacco is relatively high. In 
chapter III tables are presented showing the relationship ex¬ 
isting betv;een the habits of the parents and those of the 
prisoners. 

Humber of Children in the Home .- The number of children 
in the home during the childhood of any individual is obviously 































- 28 - 


a factor of considerable weight in determining the home con¬ 
ditions and relationships. Below is the distribution of the 
number of children in the fraternity of each of the 127 men 
of our group for whom the facts were known.

The average number of children in these homes, as 
represented by the arithmetic mean of the above distribution, 
is 4.9. The median family, or that ranking mid-way between 
the greatest and the least, has four children. Families with 
three, four, five or six children occur with almost equal 
frequency. The distribution shows a decided preponderance of 
relatively large families. 45.7^^ of the men are from homes 























- 29 - 


oontaining more than five chiidren, and 12.6/a are from homes 
with ten or more ohiidren. Oniy three men oat of 127, or 
were "only ohiidren" in their homes. 

Position in Fraternity. - Closely related to the size of 
the family is the position of the individual member being studied. 
Of our group of 129 men, 21 were the eldest in their families and 
12 were the youngest. Of those who were not the eldest members 
of families and who lived in fraternities containing six or* 
more ohiidren, 17 had four or more younger brothers and sisters. 

Completeness of Family .- Basic to the normal condition 
of a home is the presence of both parents. The extent to which 
the homes of our gaol group were broken in various ways is 
shown in the following table.

In 49 cases, or 58.0^ of the total, the men came from 
homes which had been deprived of one parent by separation, or of 
one or both parents by death. These figures are minimal, and the 




















- 30 - 


percentage coming from broken homes is very probably larger than 
here Indicated, because although inrorraatlon on this point was 
not obtained in all cases, the total number of 12y was used as 
the base in calculating the percentages. 

Criminal Records or Immediate Family .- The numoer or 
prisoners who reported that their lathers had been criminally 
convicted celore the courts was 7 out or the 12y, or 3.4%. 

There were also lb, or 14.0%, who reported that one or more or 
t;eir brothers had been convicted by the courts. These figures 
may be expected to represent something less than tne truth, as 
the criminality or relatives is one matter regarding which some 
of the men would wish to have the least possible known. But 
even accepting these figures as they are, they represent an 
index of criminality much higher than that of the general pop¬ 
ulation. A consideration of the fathers alone gives tne following 
facts: The number of males in Alberta by tne 1^31 census was 

400,199* According to the figures lOr Canada based on the 1921 
census, one third of these are below 13 years of age and there¬ 
fore not old enough to be fathers. The nuirxber of convictions 
of males before the Alberta courts in 1931 was 23b3. The number 
of criminals is considerably less than the number of convictions 
because many of the men were convicted on more than one charge, 
yet accepting this figure as representing the number of male 
criminals in Alberta we find the group constituting only 0.9% of 
the total adult males of the province. In comparison with this 
figure the 3.4% of our cases in v/hich the fathers had been crim¬ 
inally convicted is very large indeed.

FamlLy Relationships .- The ninety men of the group who 
expressed their feeling as to the happiness of the relationships 
within their home did so as follows:

The kind of relationship existing in the homes from 
which these men have come is probably even less favorable than 
the above percentages indicate. Many of the men whose reaction 
was accepted as indicating happiness in their home life were 
quite obviously referring to an absence of friction or openly 
hostile attitudes among the members of the family, rather than 
to any positive relationship exceeding that of mere cordiality. 
The men who spoke of their home as if it had been a life centre 
of such really vital happiness as to provide them with genuine 
inspiration were very few. Apathetic indifference was rather 
the general rule, as if the home had been taken for granted as 
a place to eat and sleep and little more. Two or three spoke 
with warm appreciation of the companionship they had had with 
their parents. Apart from these few instances the only men who 
had not taken complacently for granted the relationships within 
their homes were those who were openly antagonistic to other

members of the family. Ihere were six men who felt quite hostile 
to their fathers, and three who had lived in continual fear of 
them. Many of the group spoke of strenuous quarrelling with 
brothers and sisters. Almost all expressed a favorable attitude 
toward their mothers. 

Age of Leaving Home 'Fourteen of the men were still 

living at home at the time of the present conviction. There 
were others who still lived at home intermittently, and still 
others who had broken their contact with the home gradually 
over a period of time by increasing periods of absence. Those 
who had left home at a definite and known time number eighty- 
nine .

be ing ten years and the maxLmom thirty-four. The average age 
of leaving as expressed by the arithmetic mean of the dis¬ 
tribution is 17 years 10 months, 'ihe median age of Leaving, 
or that of the man for whom that age ranked mid-way between 
the earliest and the Latest, is L0 years LO months. The modal 
or most frequently occurring age is 18 years. Some of the 
more significant facts presented in the table are: 21.4;^ of 
the men had left home before they were past the age of 14 
years, 41.6J5 had left before they were past 17, and 64.1;^ be¬ 
fore they were past 18. On the other hand, of the group who 
left home at some time previous to the present conviction, 
58.4^ were still in the home when they reached the age of 18, 
and 21.3J^ were still there when they reached the age of 21. 

Reason for Leaving Home .- The reasons for which the 
men left home are listed below in order of the frequency of 
occurrence. The percentages are given in terms of the group 
of one hundred men for which this information was obtained.

The largest single group under this olass ifioation is 
that of the men who left home when they reached a certain age 
in order that they might find work for themselves because it 
seemed the natural thing to do. This group is not distinctly 
demarcated from the group who left home because of the necessity 
of work, for the desire and the necessity often occurred simul¬ 
taneously, but the men classed under "Recessity of V/ork" are 
those who left home earlier than they would otherwise have 
' done, due to the economic necessity of wage-earning. Those 
described in the table as desiring to travel often went forth 
intending to work, but are thus classified because the dominant 
motive in leaving home when they did seemed to be the desire 
for a change from the home environment. 

In a number of cases the age of home leaving was 
distinctly related to the conditions in the home. Placing 
together the groups leaving because of home break-up/oecause

of unemployment and poverty in the family, and in order to 
escape from undesirable home oonditions, we have E4 men who 
left home definitely because of the failure of the home. V/e 
may add also to this group the one boy who was sent away from 
home on suspended sentence, assuming that this action would 
not have been taken had the home oonditions been satisfactory 
in the eyes of the court. Thus we have a group constituting 
25^ of the total number of men here considered for whom the 
determining factor in the age of home leaving was the unfor¬ 
tunate situation in the home,- economical or otherwise. 

The reasons for home leaving at a specific time may 
be grouped according to the motivating force as follows:

It is impossible, of course, to speak of the motives 
behind human actions in terms other than those of general 
approximations. The above cla^ssifications are the result of 
a careful attempt to drav; from the statements of the men the 
reason which in general prompted their action. In each in¬ 
dividual case the conclusion was based on a personal knowledge 
of the men derived from one or more long oonversations. The 
decisions classed under personal volition v/ere by no means

free from the influence of strong external factors such as 
that of economic pressure. 

Relations With Home Since Leaving .- Only 31 of the 
men or 24.0^ of the whole group, reported intimate and frequent 
relationships with the home since leaving, by either personal 
contact or correspondence. At least 14 of them, or 10.7^ of 
the total, had had no relations whatever with their homes since 
leaving. In interpreting these figures it must be kept in 
mind that not all of the men had homes after leaving, and also 
that the use of 129 as the base in calculating the percentages 
makes them somewhat too low, as information on this point was 
not obtained in all oases. However it seems certain that a 
relatively small percentage of the men who had homes really 
maintained a relationship with them after leaving. Ihis bears 
out the conclusion previously reached on the basis of Table XV 
that in only a small percentage of the cases studied were the 
original home relationships vital and happy, and adds weight 
to the impression that the home lives of the majority of the 
men studied were not highly favorable. 

Mobility of Famil y.- A final factor in the home in¬ 
fluence and environment is that of the degree of permanence or 
mobility in the location of the home. Some of the facts furnish¬ 
ed by the men of our group concerning this factor in their home 
lives is here tabulated.

It is seen that a large number of our prisoners have 
oorae from homes which experienced frequent change of physical 
environment. These percentages again should be Larger than 
they appear here, because the total population is taken as the 
base, although information on this matter was not obtained from 
the entire group. At least 22.4^ of the men had experienced 
change of country during their childhood, and in a large per¬ 
centage of these oases the move was from the Old World to the 
IJew, bringing of course very radical changes of social environ¬ 
ment, custom, tradition, and institutions, as well as of 
language and thought forms. Among the 12.4:% of oases in which 
the moves were wiLhin one country, many of the families were 
prone to move very frequently, with the result that the school 
life of the children was disrupted and the family at no time 
came to feel itself a part of any community in a permanent 


sense.

Kationality 

Ihe nationalities of the prisoners oan best be sum¬ 
marized by a tabulation of the countries of birth. For this 
purpose we are using the enumeration of birthplaces given by 
the 1188 men entering the gaol during the year ending Llarch 
31, 1932. Table ICK gives the number of men born in each 
country represented, and also the percentage distribution of 
the nationalities among this total gaol group of 1108 and 
among the general population of Alberta as given in the 
19.31 census.

percentage of Canadian-born in the gaol group is 
considerably less than the corresponding percentage or the 
general population. The British Isles contribute slightly less, 
proportionately, to the gaol population than to the general 
population. The same is true of that portion or the population 
born in the United States. The situation with regard to 
Europeans is in marKed contrast to that concerning those 
born in the British Isles, the United States, and Canada. 

The percentage of the pra)soners who were born in Europe 
is more than twice as great as the percentage of European- 
born in the total Alberta population. 

The proportionate shares of the leading immigrant 
nationalities in the gaol group may be expressed as follows:

be one, the representation or Austrian-born in a proportionate 
unit or the gaol population would oe seventeen. Thus the ratio 
or the percentage or prisoners Austrian-born to the percentage of 
or our whole population Austrian-born is seventeen to one. 

The corresponding ratio tor UKrainians is thirteen to one, 
ror Norwegians two to one, and tor Polish two to one. For 
the Russian-born the ratio is one to one, that is, their 
contribution to the gaol population is in almost exact 
proportion to their share in the total population or tne 
province. For the British Isles, the United States, and Candda, 
in that order, the ratios are successively less, in all 
three cases being less than one to one. 

It is very plain from the above tables and ratios 
that immigrants rrom the countries or Continental Europe 
contribute a larger propoEtionate share to the population 
or Fort Saskatchewan Gaol than do the Canadian-born or the 
immigranta from the United States and the British Isles. 

Any interpretation of the above conclusions, however, must 
take into consideration the fact that the section or the 
population of Alberta from which the Fort Saskatchewan 
prisoners are drawn probably includes a larger proportion 
of the Central European iimaigrants than does the soutnern 
part of the province which is served by the Lethbridge Gaol. 

A further significant consideration is that immigrant groups 
usually include a disproportionately large number of adult

Only slightly over one-fifth of the group have come 
from homes of really comfortable conditions. The great majority 
are from homes of marginal economic status, in which there is 
little luxury and frequent financial pressure. The families 
classed as dependent, constituting 8. IJo of the total number, 
are those which have been on government relief during the period 
that the individual being considered was in the home. The econom¬ 
ic scarcity which has cliaracterised such a large number of these 
homes must necessarily have been a strong factor in determining 
the pastimes, the associations, the opportunities, and the 
general social environment of the youths who spent their im¬ 
pressionable years in them. 

Mental Ability and Personality. 

Intelligence Level .- There are two chief methods which 
may be used in securing data concering the intelligence level 
of any group of individuals: an estimate of the intelligence 
may be made on the basis of personal observation^or standardized 
intelligence tests may be used. The method of general estimate was 
used by Pr. Charles Goring in his monumental statistical study 
of English convicts. The method of intelligence tests has been 
used in the leading studies of delinquent groups on the American 
continent. The method of estimate is bound to be influenced by 
the personal equation of the investigator and by his preconceiv¬ 
ed opinions. Moreover the lack of unifoiraity renders comparison 
between groups decidedly unreljdble. The method of examination 
by means of intelligence tests is much more objective and largely 
free from personal bias. It possesses also the great advantages 
of uniformity and convenience of administration# But the exam-

Lnat ion method has its limitations, and mast be oarefally 
interpreted. It measures a limited field of mental ability and 
leaves out of o ons idera 1; ion various phases of mental reaction 
which are included in a well-founded general estimate. The 
analysis here presented of the intelligence level of the group 
of prisoners studied in Ft. Sasxatohewan Gaol is based chiefly 
upon the scores obtained from standardized intelligence tests, 
but these are supplemented, where deemed advisable, by estimates 
based on personal observation, and interpreted in the light of 
general impressions. 

The most satisfactory method of intelligence examination 

used in this study was the Herring Revision of the Binet-Simon 

Tests. The Liental iiges obtained by the use of this revision have 

the same meaning as the Stanford-Binet Mental i»ges, with v^hich, 

{ O'} 

according to Herring, they correlate 99 per cent in unselect- 
ed age groups. The Terman scale assumed the average mental age 
of adults to be 16 years and considered 100 the equivalent I.Q. 
Subsequent studies have indicated that the average mental level 
of the general population is something less than 100 on the 
Terman scale. Ho definite'conelusions have been reached as to 
the actual average score of adults, because of the difficulty 
of eliminating selective factors in the choice of sample popula¬ 
tions. The large number of tests administered in the United 

States army during the war indicated an average mental age of

between 13 and 14 years, but, as V/ells points out the condi-

ditions of seleotion and of administration were such that this 

average is very likely below that of the general population. 

V/eiis refers to Dearborn and Plntner as authorities for the use 

of 14 or 14^ years li^stead of 16 years as the divisor for adult 

( 0 ) 

Intelligence quotients. Terman has been quoted as estimating 

the average mental age to be slightly above 14(^^ His own work 

with prospective firemen and policemen showed an average mental 

f e) 

age of something over 14 years. The consideration of these 
various expressions of opinion leads one to the conclusion that 
the mental age of the average adult population is less than 16 
but is not as low as 14. It has seemed justifiable on the basis 
of the available information to use 90 as the average I.Q., thus 
assuming the average mental age to lie between 14 and 14-|- years. 
Adopting this conclusion as a working basis, the intelligence 
scale used for a comparison of the prison group of this study 
with the general population is the original Terman scale adjust¬ 
ed to make 90 instead of 100 the central point of the distribu¬ 
tion . 

The actual method used in tabulating the test scores 
for the gaol group was as follows: The mental ages obtained 
from the Herring Revision were converted into scores by the 
use of 16 as the divisor. For classification of the scores thus 
obtained the normal distribution of the general population, as 
given by Terman in "The Measurement of Intelligence”, was moved

The above classification of intelligence scores shows 
a wide discrepancy between the proportions of the various levels 
of intelligence found in the gaol group and the proportions 
accepted for the general population. Only 27.9 per cent of the 
gaol group tested average or above average while our classifica¬ 
tion shows 80.0 per cent of the general population to be average 
or superior. Those classified as of border-line deficiency 
constitute 25.8 per cent of the gaol group but only 5.0 per cent 
of the general population, while the definitely feeble-minded are

18 times as numerous among the prisoners as among the general 
populat ion. 

The average Herring soore of these 12E prisoners was 
7E.y. This IQ is equal to a mental age of 11 years 5 months. 

If we accept the assumption stated above that the average men¬ 
tal age of the general population is between 14 and 14£ years 
we find the gaol group to be about three years' be lovt/ the average 
in mental age. 

The Healy Picture Completion Mo.pp was given to ISO of 
the prisoners. Accurate norms were not at hand for the conver¬ 
sion of the P.O. scores into mental ages, but according to 
rough norms obtained from 160 tests for each age group the 
average mental age of this group of prisoners is somewhat higher 
than that shown by the Herring Mental Ages. There seem to be 
good reasons, however, for placing more confidence in the Her¬ 
ring mental ages than in those obtained from the Picture Com¬ 
pletion Test. The scores from the P. 0. test correlated 0.66 
with the Herring IQ scores. 

The Otis Intermediate Self-Administering Test of Mental 
Ability was given to 24 of the men. The average IQ thus obtain¬ 
ed was 85.4. Selective factors entering into the choice of this 
group of 24 resulted in the inclusion of a greater number of the 
more intelligent prisoners. However the same 24 men made an 
average soore of only 77.7 on the Herring, which, while 3.8 
points above the average for the total number of prisoners 
tested with the Herring,’ is still 7.7 points below the average 
of the 24 Otis scores. In spite of the difference in the levels 
obtained on the Otis and -cierring scores for these 24 oases, the

oorrelatlon between the two series of scores was 0.77. 

A comparison may well be made between our test resuits 

and those obtained by Llr. Kibbiewhite when testing i49 men in 

(a) 

the Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol in 1930^ The mean IQ of the 149 
prisoners was found by Llr. Kibblewhite to be 76.^7. This is 
nearly four points above the average Herring IQ which we have 
found, but Ilr . Kibblewhite used largely Otis tests which have 
been shown above to give higher scores for this group of men 
than those given by the Herring. 

Mechanical Ability Test .- She Stenquist Mechanical 
Assembly Test was performed by 114 of the men in our group. 

The raw scores ranged from 50 to the maximum possible of 100 
with an average raw score of approximately 80. Converted into 
T-scores the range was from 60 to 82, with an average of approx¬ 
imately 72. Ho figures are at hand for comparison of these scores 
with those of other groups. The Stenquist T-scores correlated 
0.41 with the Herring IQ scores, and the Probable Error was 0.055 

General Information Test .- A list of twenty-five quest lore 
covering a wide range of general information and arranged in 
order of difficulty was used as a test of the general knowledge 
of the prisoners. In 110 oases in which the Herring IQ was ob¬ 
tained as well as the Information Test score, the Latter scores 
ranged from 4 to 24, with an arithmetic mean of 16.3. The 
average IQ of this group of 110 as measured by the Herring Test 
was 77.

The Table shows that the mean score of the gaol group on 
the information Test lies between the mean score of the Grade VII 
group and that of the Grade VIII group. The range covered by 
the scores is oo.*siderably greater in the case of the prisoners 
than with the school children, some of the prisoners scoring 
lower than any of the school children and others scoring higher. 
The general conclusion warranted by these test results is that 
the group of prisoners studied have on the whole a range of 
general information approximating that of school children in 
Grades Vli and VIII. 

Correlation of Tests Used .- A summary of the relation¬ 
ships between the various series of test scores used in this

Personality of the'Prisoner s.- It has been indicated 
above that over seventy per cent of the men in the group studied 
were of dull or feeble mentality. Among men of such a low gen¬ 
eral intelligence level one would expect to find dull, anemic, 
and weak personalities. Such is very largely the case. The 
general impression given by the group of prisoners is of a 
type of personality very dull, heavy and insensitive. There 
is a fairly wide range of variation and some marked exceptions, 
but for the most part the men are characterized much more by 
the lack of intensity and awareness, than by any malicious 
propensities. The majority are of kindly disposition and of 
friendly nature.

The edaoatlonal background of the group of prisoners was

in school, the attitude toward school, the age and reason of 
leaving, and the amount of study of any kind done since leaving 
public or high school. 

The grades reached by the 110 men who gave a definite

The average grade attained by the men of this group, as 
represented by the Arithmetic Mean of this distribution, is 6.5. 
The Median grade, or that reached by the man who would be mid¬ 
way in the series if the group were arranged in rank order ac¬ 
cording to the grade reached, is Grade VII. The Modal grade, 
or that at which leaving school is most popular for this group^ 
is grade VIII. 

The table shows that of the group did not reach 

grade VI, and that 37^ did not reach Grade VII. Of the thirty 
who left school at Grade VIII a large number did not finish the 
year, so that portion of the total group who finished public 
school is well under 40^i. Only 19 out of the 110 or 17.3^ did 
any work in high school, and of these only 2 went on to College 
or University. 

Attitude Toward School.- The attitudes of the men toward 























- 54 - 


aohoo; at the time when they were in attendance have been 
recorded on the basis of their own recoliection of their at¬ 
titudes. In cases where the men were not certain what their 
attitude toward school had been no record was made.

The table shows that only slightly more than half of 
the men of this group really Liked school, and that over a 
quarter of them had a decided dislike for the regime under 
which they were being educated. This comparatively large 
incidence of unfavorable attitudes toward schooling may well 
be kept in mind in considering later the early age at which a 
large nur.iber of this group left school and also vfhen observing 
their general failure to find satisfactory social adjustment. 

Truancy .- In discussing their school days forty-one of 
the men made definite statements concerning the extent of their 
school truancy. The facts thus revealed are set forth in the 
following table.

This group is hardly large enough to form the basis for 
any very definite conclusions, but it does seem to indicate that 
the percentage of truants among this group of men must be higher 
than among school children in general. Among this group of 41 
who made statements concerning their own truancy, only 31^ claim¬ 
ed to have played no truant, while over 68fo had been deliberately 
irregular in attendance. 

Deliberate truancy was not the only factor revealed as 
contributing to the irregularity of the attendance of this group 
at school. In a number of oases the lack of educational facil¬ 
ities prevented the attendance at school until a late age or 
sometimes altogether. In other oases, particularly among farm 
boys, parents or guardians kept the children at home to v^fork 
during the busy seasons, and in many instances the irregularity 
in attendance became so great that the boys lost interest in 
the school work, or found themselves far behind and became dis¬ 
couraged. It was much less common for city boys to be kept at 
home by the parents. 

The individuals who reported in regard to their practise 

of truancy are distributed as follows on the basis of the location 
of their homes.

The table shows that In this group of men truancy had 
been much more common in the case of those who had spent their 
childhood in the city than in the case of those who had lived 
on farms. The percentage of city boys among those who reported 
’*muoh truancy” is more than four times as great as the correspond¬ 
ing percentage of farm boys, although in the total group the 
percentage of city boys is much less than tiiat of farm boys. 
Similarly the group of farm boys, representing 47.0)o of the total 
group, furnished of those who did not play truant. The 

number of town boys is too small to be considered, but the 
figures of the table certainly emphasize the fact that within 
this gaol group the truancy occurred among the city boys in 
much greater proportion than among those whose homes were on 
farms. 

Age of Leaving School. - One hundred and six of the men 
made definite statements of the age at which they left school. 

In some oases there had been breaks in the sequence of education 


























‘

before the time recorded as that of final leaving, and in others 
there v^ere Later periods of night school or other irregular study. 
The earlier breaks are not taken into ooi.s iderat ion here, but 
are allowed for in a later statement concerning the number of 
years spent at school. The later periods of irregular study 
are also disregarded here but are recorded roughly under the 
heading "Subsequent Schooling". The following table sets forth 
data concerning those men for whom the age of leaving school 
can be expressed with fair accuracy by means of a numerical 
figure.

The average age of school leaving for this group, as 
expressed by the Arithmetic Ilean of the above distribution, is 
fourteen years and four months. The Lledian age of leaving, or 
that of the individual who ranks mid-way when the men are listed 
in order of age of school leaving, is fourteen years, which is 




























- 60 - 


aLso the Modal or most frequently ooourring age. 

fhe table shows that almost sixty per oent of the group 
left school before they were past fourteen yjars of age, that 
almost eighty per cent left before they were past fifteen, and 
that almost ninety-per oent left before they were past sixteen, 
fhe fact that nearly sixty per oent of this grou; left school 
before reaching the age of fifteen years is of particular inter¬ 
est in’ view of the fact that sohool attendance is compulsory in 
this province until the age of fifteen. 

The one hundred and six oases listed in the table do not 
include the five individuals who received no schooling at all, 
and also omits several others who attended school only inter¬ 
mittently or for short periods. If these oases could have been 
included the average age of school leaving would have appeared 
as considerably less than in the table given. Although cor¬ 
responding figures for the general population of Alberta are not 
available, the impression given by this distribution is that the 
gaol population represents a group who leave school at an earlier 
age than the average population. 

Reason for Leaving School. - Olosely related lo the age 
of school leaving is the reason for leaving. From the life 
stories of eighty-four of the men it was possible to record the 
reasons for leaving school as -follows:

One-fourth of the men who gave reasons for leaving 
school when they did, made it ciear tbit they left on their own 
initiative because they did not like school. There were many 
others who expressed a dislike of school but with whom it was 
not the determining factor in bringing their school days to a 
close. They are therefore classified otherwise in this table. 

The second and third reasons, "To Work Willingly" and 
"To Work of iJecessity", do not divide the men clearly into two 
mutually exclusive groups. In many oases it was necessary to 
go to work and the individual was also willing. In other oases 
the three reasons were combined;because of a dislike of school^ 
and the necessity of wage earning^the boy went to work willingly. 
The e ighty-four cases tabulated above are those in which it 
seemed possible to estimate the reason which was the determining 
factor. In some of the oases listed either one or two otiier 
reasons were present but only that reason is tabulated which 
seemed to be decisive. 

The impression left by the men’s reports•of their school 
days and the early stages of their economic life leads one to the

oonoluaion that the factor of economic necessity brought an end 
to school careers in a much larger number of oases th^n the above 
table would seem to indicate. In many oases the boy had liked 
school and made such progress that it would have been very much 
worthwhile for him to continue at school at least several years 
longer, but the difficult financial situation of the family made 
it the natural thing for the boy to leave school at an early age 
and go to work. As will be shown in tables below, li/o of the men 
studied came from homes that were rated as of only marginal 
economic status, and Sfo came from homes that had for at least a 
period of time received government relief. The preponderance of 
homes in which the making of a living was difficult gives reason 
for the finding that in a large number of cases boys were taken 
from school at the earliest opportunity and put to work in order 
that they might support themselves and in many instances contri¬ 
bute as well to the support of thd family. The factor of economic 
necessity seems to have been the decisive one in many of the 
cases in which the boy was not unwilling to leave school. Th^is 
too is quite reasonable in view of the type of family represented 
in this populati':n. The parents of 4:6fo of the men were of the 
laboring class, and of 4 O 70 were farmers. This means that S6fo of the 
boys came from homes of two classes which in Alberta have not on 
the whole built up any tradition of higher education. Among both 
of these classes the families which aspire to send the children 
to institutions of higher learning are still in the minority. 
Consequently the boys grow up without any ambition or desire to 
continue beyond public school, and their interest turns in the 
direction of finding work at the earliest opportunity and be-

ooming established in the oocupation of the parent or in a 
similar one. A knowledge of the kinds of homes found in this 
province among the two oooupational classes contributing most 
heavily to the gaol population forma a basis for the conclusion 
that, although a relatively small number of the prisoners re¬ 
ported that they had ieft school against their will because of 
the necessity of work, in a large niuaber of oases it was zhe 
economic status of the home that was the determining factor in 
bringing the school career to an early end.

a picture of 

The above table presents'^the educational bacicground of 


the group • similar to that given by the distribution of grades 
reached, in Table XXXIV. The average number of years spent at 
school, as shown by the Arithmetic Ilean of the distribution, was 

























-62- 


7.2. The median of the distribution, or the soore of the man 
who’ ranks mid-way between the highest and the lowest ratings,is 
also 7.2 years. The mode, or period of school attendance which 
occurred most frequently among the group is 8 years. 

The average number of years spent at school is thus 
shown to be higher than the average grade reached, which accord¬ 
ing to Table XXXVI was 6.5. This fact indicates that the group 
as a whole did not average a grade per year while in attendance 
at school. 

The table may be roughly summarized by noting that of the 
total group 20.9^ spent less than six years at school, that 69.2^ 
spent eight years or less, and that only 9.1;^ spent more than 
ten years. 

It is interesting to note that of the seven men who re¬ 
ceived less than one year of schooling all were born in Canada 
except one who was born in England and brought to this province 
in infancy. Of the six born in Canada, two were of European 
parents, and the other four of Canadian born parents. 

Among the reasons for the short period spent at school 
by many of these men are the following: Distance of farm homes 
from school, necessity of early work due to poverty in the home, 
necessity of work due to lack of parents, or to their failure to 
support the children, early home leaving due to trouble and un¬ 
happiness in the home, ill healtlji, and failure to make progress 
in school due to mental deficiency. 

Subsequent Education .- In addition to the two men who 
went directly to college or university after completing high 
school a small number did further study of some kind at some

t ime after Leaving school. Such subsequent eduoallon was 
reported by only 14 of the L29 men (10.9^). i’he amount of this 
after-study varied greatly, • nd the types of study were equally 
diverse. Some of the foreign born spent a few hours a week for 
one or two winters at night school learning the Lnglish language 
and some had spent one or two years in army school in the country 
of origin, -among those born in Canada or the United States sev¬ 
eral had taken short courses or served apprenticeships in motor 
mechanics, Others had taken correspondence courses in photo¬ 
graphy and barbering, and one had become a pilot in the American 
Air Service. One young man had attended a religious college in 
preparation for an intended life-work of preaching, and another 
had studied telegraphy in an Alberta college. 

The great majority of the men, at least eighty per cent, 
had received no formal education of any kind since leaving 
school and were accustomed to no reading other than very light 
fiction and magazines of the poorer kind. 

Summary of Eduoat ional Bac.-iground . - The group of men 
studied have been found to have an educational background con¬ 
siderably below that of the general population. The average man 
of the group spent slightly more than seven years at school and 
failed to reach the seventh grade. The majority of them did not 
like school, and truancy was very common, particularly among 
those who had attended city schools. V/ell over half of the 
group had left school before reaching fifteen years of age and 
nearly eighty per cent had left before passing their fifteenth 
year. Seven had attended school not at all or for less than 
one year, and over ZO'Jo attended for less than six years. Slightly 








r 


-64- 

more than lOJo had received formal edaoatlon of some kind after 
leaving pnblio or high school, and in most oases the after- 
education was not at all extensive. 

On the basis of the interviews with Lhe men, it was 
recorded that genuine benefit would have ensued from further 
schooling in the case of £7 of them or 20.9/^; of the whole group. 
Ihis is decidedly a minimal figure, and was intended to refer 
only to those who, it was felt, would have benefitted directly 
by further schooling of the kind being experienced at school 
leaving. It takes into consideration the mental ability of 
each subject as measured by the series of tests used, and also 
the attitude which he recalls having had toward school at'the 
time when he left. fhe number who would thus have benefitted by 
further schooling would be greatj.y increased if we should add 
those oases in which the removal of the economic necessity of 
early wage earning would have left the boy free to feel the 
possibility of continuing with his education. It might also have 
been augmented by a group who possessed good mental ability , 
but who missed so much school through the necessity of work or 
on account of distance from school that they found it too dif¬ 
ficult to keep up with the work, and became so discouraged that 
they dropped out. But when we have taken into consideration 
the group who had the ability to succeed and who probably would 
have desired to continue at school provided the difficult econo¬ 
mic circumstances were removed, as well as the group who actually 
did desire to continue, there still remains a large group who 
did not fit"satisfactorily into the school life. The chief 
reasons for the failure of this group to find satisfactory school 



•r> 








-65- 


ad jus tment seem to lie in the mentality and the outlook of the 
boys in relation to the educational system. Many of them lacked 
the mental ability to succeed in school work beyond the very 
lowest grades. Others possessor ability of a mechanical type 
but seemed unable to handle tho more abstract conceptions requir¬ 
ed in the work of the higher grades of public school. In both 
groups the failure to handle tho school w'ork with ease naturally 
induced a dissatisfaction with the school regime. The boys of 
these mental types would not have profited greatly by being kept 
longer at school, under the general program of public school 
education now used in this province, but might conceivablyA^ene- 
fitted by a kind of training suited to their particular type of 
mind. 

The aim of this section has been to present the general 
educational status attained by the men now in the Ft. Saksatchew- 
an Gaol. Our conclusion is that the majority of the men now 
prisoners there had less advantage from their school experience 
than the average citizen of Alberta. The relation of this 
educational factor to delinquency will be discussed in Chapter 
III * 

Economic Life of the Gaol Inmates 

Bconomic Status of th e Home.- The economic condition 
of the home is the first factor in the economic life of the in¬ 
dividual. Figures previously given (Table XAIII) show that 
slightly over one-fifth of the men studied are from homes that 
are sufficiently well provided financially to be called comfort¬ 
able, and 8.155 were receiving government relief. The occupations 
of the fathers were shown in table Idll to be distributed as

Business and Professional men 8.9;i. 

The homes from which the men have come have presented in 
general a picture of the classos less fortunate financially and 
seldom beyond tho range of economic pressure. Over half of the 
group studied were introduced into the economic world through 
the medium of a working class home.

Farmers and business and professional men are in much 
smaller proportion among the prisoners than among their fathers. 
Skilled Laborers too are considerably fewer among the sons, and 
semi-skilled laborers slightly fewer. The only group for which 
the proportion is greater among the sons is that of the unskilled 
laborers, and here the excess is very great^there being almost 
five times as large a percentage among the prisoners as among 
their fathers. 

It was noted previously tho-t over half of the men had 
come from homes of the working class. Subsequent tables have 
shown that over seven-eighths of the prisoners themselves have 
found their way into laboring occupations. There is thus a 
distinct trend of the gaol men toward the classes lower in the 
economic scale. Within the laboring class itself there is a 
marked tendency for these men to find employment requiring less 
skill, less training, and less initiative than was needed in the 
occupations of their fathers. Corresponding figures for the 
general population are not directly available, but there are 
reasons for believing that such a trend does not greatly dis- 














- 69 - 


tingaish the gaol group from the generation of Alberta people 
which they represent. In the discussion of the birthpiaoe of the 
men it was shown th'it a much Larger percentage of the prisoners 
than of their parents were born in Canada. Consequently a larger 
group of the parents spent their youth in the older countries of 
the British Isles and Europe. It seems generally true that men 
and women educated a generation ago .in the countries of the Old 
World learned a trade or some ftkiiied occupation in a larger 
proportion of oases than is common among the present generation 
of Albertans, especially of the immigrant group. Tables XX and 
XXI have shown that the majority of the gaol group studied are 
immigrants themselves or of immigrant stock one generation re¬ 
moved. However, in spite of the probable truth of this quali¬ 
fication, it appears to be a sound conclusion that one of the 
characteristics of the group of men found in the gaol is their 

tendency to find occupations which are of a lower economic order 

which 

than those of their fathers, and-^require less ability and less 
education.

ily obtained.

age 

The average^of beginning to work as represented by the 


arithmetic mean of the above distribution is 15.3 years. The 
median age, or th t ranking mid-way, is 15 years, and the modal 
or most frequently occurring age is 14 years. Practically two- 
thirds of the group began work between the ages of 14 and 16. 

Of this group 41.9% began work at the age of 14 years or earlier, 
and 81.0% had begun to earn before reaching the age of seventeen. 
Figures for comparison with the general population are not avail¬ 
able, but it is hardly likely that of the general male population 
of Alberta four-fifths have begun to earn at the age of sixteen 
or younger. The picture of the group thus given is in accord 
with that of the previous discussion of school achievement, in 
which it was indicated that over sixty per cent of the men had 
left school before completing the eighth grade. A predominant 
characteristic of this group seems to be early school leaving and 





























- 71 - 


oorrespondingly early employment. 

Immedlacy of V/ork When Leaving Sohool .- Eighty-six of 
the man supplied information as to the period of idleness elapsing 
between school leaving and the commencement of employment.

It would appear that 23.3% of the men were idle for at 
least a short time after leaving school, and that in 70% of the 
oases the idleness lasted for more than a year. This means that 
in something less than a fourth of the total group was a period 
of idleness after leaving school a probable factor in forming 
habits of idleness, and in encouraging a tendency to drift. It 
must be said in qualification, however, that with the group who. 
went to work immediately on leaving school the first period of 
employment was often very short, and was followed by a series of 
very short Jobs, interspersed with periods of varying length 
during which the time was spent in idleness or in travelling 
from place to place in search of work. 'The extent to which the 
men of this group found steady employment is indicated in Table 
XLII below. 

Length of Periods of Employment .- The periods of work 


varied greatly among the men. oome had never held one Job for 
more than a month and others had worked in the same capacity for 




















- 72 - 


periods from eight and nine years up to a maximum of seventeen 
years. In general, the number of men who had worked steadily „ 
at one Job for a long period of years were very few. l^o tabular 
presentation of the i ;ngihs of work periods has been attempted. 

It would give an inaccurate picture of the work history of the 
men for in a great many oases there had been one period of one 
year or more at a single Job, and tr.e rest of the ompLoyment 
history had been one of continual moving from one very short time 
Job to another not exceeding a few weeks. Seasonal employment in 
lumber camps, on farms, at road work and construction of various 
kinds had been common among a majority of the men who have been 
classed above as laborers, and the periods of employment for that 
group were on the whole even shorter than seems common among men 
in those types of work. Further information on this point is 
given in the following section on Type of Worker. 

Type of V/orker .- The group of 129 prisoners studied v/as 
oarefuily analyzed on the basis of the regularity of their work, 
and the kind of work habits that resulted from their ability and 
their attitude toward work. For this purpose the following 
classification terms have been used: 

Drifter - The type of man who travels a good deal and 
holds no Jobs for more than a very short period, who seems satis¬ 
fied to be unemployed a good portion of the time, and who is either 
too restless to remain in one place or too poorly qualified to 
hold Jobs with any degree of permanence. 

Hover - The man who is more satisfied than the "drifter" 
to remain in one location for a period of time, and who does not 
desire regular periods of unemployment, but who either through 












- 73 - 


deaire or Laok of capacity, fails to hold jobs permanently, and 
Is therefore regularly employed but with frequent ohaiiges of em¬ 
ployment and In some oases of location. 

bteady-worker - The man who possesses sufficient ability 
and sufficient tenacity and stability to remain at one job for a 
period of years, and who does not ordinarily relinquish his job 
of his own free will, but on].y when economic conditions make it 
necessary. 

Eon-worker - The men in this class form two distinct 
groups: There is one group of men represented in the gaol group 

studied who for various reasons have not worked for such a long 
period of time that they no longer think of themselves as workers, 
but who deliberately make their living in other ways. There is 
also the group who reached the age of wage-earning since the be¬ 
ginning of the business depression and who have consequently 
never found employment . 

according 

The distribution of the men in our sample group^to the 
classification outlined above is given in Table XLII together 
with the percentage which each group forms of the total number 
of men studied. •

The distribution presented above is very significant in 
its indication of the classes of ^A-orkers represented by our gaol 
popuiation, and their general place in the economic life of the 
province. It shows that over half of this group are either 
drifters or non-workers. 

The factors determining that one of the above groups in 
which each man is found are numerous and complex. Difficult 
economic conditions throughout industry in general loom large in 
the causation of much of the drifting and unemployment. But 
there is usually to be found some reason for the fact that one 
particular individual out of many thousands possible, should be 
the one thus affected. Temperamental weakness, mental dullness, 
limited education, and lack of definite training for any task 
requiring skill, are among the factors which occur frequently, 
and usually in groups of two or more, as undermining the ability 
of the individual to maintain a satisfactory place in the economic 
order. Hence it is usually some defect ot personality, or the 
failure of the early environment to provide adequate training, 
which causes the individual to be among the group of those oast 





















- 75 - 


aside from the normal routine of trade and industry to become 
drifters, non-v»forkers, and seekers of reiief. 

War Experienoe in Reiation to Employment .- Service in the 
Great War had been a factor in the economic history of a number 
of the men. There were 10 who had seen active service in the 
trenches for varying periods of time. Of the total group of 
129 men studied there w’ere 45 who were born in 1900 or earlier, 
and therefore of sufficient age to participate actively in trench 
service. Hence 4 O 70 of those of our group who were of eligible 
age served actively in the overseas army. Several of the 
number carried physical injuries as a result of the war, and 
man^^ suffered severe nervous shook. In the case of most of 
them the war experience had been a disrupting factor in their 
occupational careers. Most of them had left Jobs to go and had 
found work much more difficult to obtain on their return. 

Several had become addicted to the use of alcohol while in the 
army and had allowed the habit *so to grow that in' recent years 
it had seriously affected their capacity to maintain satisfac¬ 
tory employment. The mental outlook resulting from the war ex¬ 
perience had become of considerable significance in some cases. 

A fairly definite "returned-rnan-complex” was evident in the 
attitude of some men who had suffered nervous shook and found 
themselves less efficient in ordinary work as a result. They 
had been accustomed to steady employment prior to the war, and 
their inability to secure such work again under the post-war 
economic conditions had made them feel that their country was 
treating with gross ingratitude the men who had sacrificed so 
much for her. The resulting bitterness and sense of mistreat- 


















- 76 - 


ment had not Inoreaaed their efforts to fit in -with the changed 
economic conditions. 

Kmpioyment a t Time of Offenc e.- The distribution of the 
men according to- their empioyment at the time of the offence for 
Bhioh they were serving a sentence whon interviewed is informative.

It seems very significant that of this group of prisoners 
over sixty per cent were unemployed at the time of committing 
their offences. It is true that §t the period when these men 
were arrested unemployment was stea'^ily mounting in volume, and 
was nearing a peak in the history of the province. But at no 
time during the period which we are considering did the most 
extravagant estimates of the number of unemployed in Alberta 
reach an amount equal to iOp of the total population. A group, 
therefore, which includes more than 60 per cent of unemployed 
seems to depend for its size upon factors which are at least 
closely related to the economic conditions.

their accounts of past occupational history, of their attitude 
toward work, and of their training, their contacts, and their

the information seemed adequate to make such an estimate.

The table emphasizes the fact that the group as a 
whole have deoidedly poor expectations as regards future work. 

It is seen that 15.1,1; have no plans at all, and this group might 
very well be augmented in the Glassification by the addition of 
two other groups. The group who expect to drift have no defin¬ 
ite plans with regard to work, but intend to continue their past 
travels from place to place, largely by freight train trans¬ 
portation, securing such short time jobs as they happen to en¬ 
counter. The group listed as "hoping" to work have no specific 
prospects of employment, but are separated from the drifters or 
those having no plans because they are earnestly desirous of 
securing steady work. A majority of those who intend to go home 
live on farms, so that they may be considered to have prospects 
for steady employment, but a sma].l number of this group belong 
to city homes, and their intention to go home implies li^^ing on 
relief or being supported by other members of the family.

Adding together the percentages of these various groups we find 
that about sixty per cent of the men studied have no definite 
prospects of satisfactory employment. This does not mean that 
none of these men v^'iLi find work, but it does mean that the 
probability is that not more than a small number of this sixty 
per cent will find satisfactory economic placement at least 
under the ^resoni conditions of business and industry. 

Marriage Relationships and Family Responsibility 

Civil Status .- The distribution of the civil states of 
the 1£9 men studied is given in the following table.

Of this group studied only 31 per cent have at any time 
been married, and only 20.9 per cent were living as married at 
the time of imprisonment. One-fourth of the number who had 
married had separated from their wives, in all oases but one the 
separation being without legal divorce. These figures may be 
taken as more accurate than those given in the regular gaol 
statistics because they are based on detailed interviews rather 























- 80 - 


than upon brief questioning, but the disorepanoy between the 
percentages is not great. The gaoi records show that of the 
iI88 prisoners admitted during the year ending March i5i, 1^32, 
there were 747 or 62.8 per cent w’ho were single. Our sample of 
129 men therefore shows a larger percentage of single men than 
the average gaol population. This excess is due in part at least 
to the fact that our sample group v;as chosen as previously in¬ 
dicated to contain a larger percentage of recidivists than the 
average population of the gaol, and as shown in Table XLVI the 
recidivist group included a larger proportion of single men than 
do Lhe groups of first and second offenders. The prisoners ad¬ 
mitted during the year, however, include only 37.2 per cent who 
have at any time been married. 

Happiness of Married Life .- Tho fact indicated above 
that of the prisoners in the group studied who had been married 
fully 25 per cent had afterwards separated seems to indicate 
that unsatisfactory marriages were common among these men. 

There were a nui:Qber of others who in the interviews made it 
known that their married lives had not been happy. Of the 40 
men in Che group who had experienced married life 19 or 47.5/j 
reported relations with their wives that were decidedly unhappy. 

Family Responsibilities of Prisoners .- The distribution 
of the prisoners according to their feeling cf responsibility 
for Che economic welfare of families or relatives is given in

It is significant that of this group of men over three- 
fourths are conscious of no family relationships which they look 
upon as involving responsibility for economic welfare of other 
members of the family. An additional group constituting nearly 
one-fifth of the total number are conscious of family relation¬ 
ships which would normally be considered to involve responsibil¬ 
ity for material support, but these men are largely indifferent 
to such responsibility. Only 15 per cent of total group feel 
keenly that their term in gaol is prev.^nting their support of 
any families or relatives. 

Habits of the Prisoners 

Use of Liquor. - The extent of the use of alcoholic 
liquors among the men in the group studied is indicated in 
Table XLVIII.

The Percentage of heavy drinhers among these men is 
greater than that among their fathers, as given in Table XI. 

Only 12.1,5 of the fathers were reported as being hea^x/ drinizers 
in contrast to the large percentage of 45.3 given above for 
prisoners themselves. On the other hand there are more moderate 
drinXers recorded among the fathers than among the prisoners, 
the ratio being almost two to one. The total abstainers number¬ 
ed one-third of the fathers and only one-fifth of the prisoners. 
The general impression concerning the alcoholic habits of the 
prisoners is that of a very marXed tendency tovrard excessive in¬ 
dulgence. This Cxharacteristic is naturally associated v/ith the 
fact that 25.3yS of the men admitted during a one yea.r period had 
been sentenced on charges in connection v/ith the Liq.uor ^xCt. The 
relation of the use of liquor to the delinq.nency of these men is 
discussed in Chapter III. An additional fact of significance 
here is that of the group vrho reported themselves to be heavy 
driiUcers the largest number regarded their alcoholic habit as 
being entirely their master, and considered themselves powerless 
to breal: it, no matter how much they might v;ish to do so. There 
is some relationship between the strength of the habit and the 


















age at which it was begun, the 87 men who had been using 

aicohoi, 61 reportecl the age at which they had begun to do so.

•Ihe averages of the above distribution calcuiated from 
data more detailed than that given in the table are as follows: 
Arithmetic Llean 18.0 years, i.Iedian 18 years, Mode 18 years. Ihe 
distribution centres very closely around the age of 18 years. 
Those who began to dr inir between the ages of 16 and 21 inclusive 
constituted 73.8 per cent of the whole group here considered. Of 
the 61 for whom the data is known 77 per cent had begun to drink 
before reaching the age of 21, and 34.4 per cent before passing 
the age of 17. In some cases the children had learned to use 
liquor quite early in their homes, nine of the individuals 
studied having begun between the ages of six "ind eleven. 

Use of Tobacco. - In the oases of 92 of the men satis¬ 
factory information was obtained concerjng the extent of the use 
of tobacco, and these facts are recorded below.

The arithmetic mean of the above distribution, oaloulat- 
ed from more detailed data, is 15.4 years. The median, or the 
age for the individual ranking mid-way when all are arranged in 
order, is 16 years, l^he mode, or most frequently occurring age 
of beginning the habit, is also 16 years. Of this group 24.0 
per cent had begun to smoke before reaching the age of 14, 

73.5 per cent before reaching the age of 18, and 96.4 per cent 
before reaching the age of 21. 

Practice of Illicit Sex Relations. - Eighty-five of 
the prisoners reported as to the extent that they had practised 
illicit heterosexual relations. A summary of their statements 
is pres'^nted in Table LII .

iiLmost half of the group were accustomed to illicit 
heterosexual practices quite regularly, and for well over three- 
fourtiis of them such xDractises were not uncommon. This habit 
was taken very much for granted by the majority of the 78.8 
per cent who practised it at least occasionally, and was not 
by most of them classed as any more immoral than the use of 
tobacco. 

Twenty-six of Lhese men, or 20.1 per cent of the total 
group of 129 studied, admitted that they had had venereal 
disease either at the time of their admission to the gaol or 
at some previous time. These figures may be considered as 
representing a minimum probably much below the actual truth, 
as not all of the men were questioned on this point. 

Of the 69 men who admitted having had illicit sexual 
relations 45 gave information as to the age at which they had 
begun the practice. A summary of these statements follows:

The average age at which men in this group had begun 
illicit sexual relations is 16.8 years as represented by the 
arithmetic mean of the above distribution. The median age of 
the distribution is 16 years, and the mode is 15. The ages of 
beginning this practise centre for this group closely about 15 
and 16 years. Of the 39 individuals, 2U.5 per cent had practis¬ 
ed illicit sexual relations before reaching the age of 15, 58.9 
per cent before reaching 17, and 84.5 per cent before reaching 
21 years. 

In addition to the 39 individuals whose statements are 
listed in the above table, there were six out of the 69 who did 
not state the exact age of first indulging in illicit sex prac¬ 
tices but who said it occurred first during their school days. 
Adding these six to the group of 23 who stated ages of 16 or less, 
we find that at least 29 out of the total of 129 prisoners 
studied, or 22.5^, had had heterosexual experiences of an

ilLLoit nature before they were older than sixteen years. 

Sixteen of the men or i2 .4 per cent of the total group 
admitted having been guilty of nutosexual praotioes at some 
time during their lives. The .^'en seemed muoh more sensitive on 
this point than on any of th^ other points concerning per.:onal 
conduct, and for this reason the figures given probably repre¬ 
sent considerably less than the actual extent of such practices 
among the men of tliis group. 

Gambling Practices .- xh^ list of questions usually asked 
of the prisoners during- these interviews did not include one 
respecting gambling. Consequently statements made by the men 
about gambling practices were usually spontaneous or due to an 
incidental reference during the conversation. Under these cir¬ 
cumstances the summary of statements concerning gambling cannot 
be taken as any adequate estimate of the extent of the habit 
among the men. There were fourteen who made reference to their 
own practice of gambling, constituting 10.8 per cent of the total 
group. Of these four considered themselves professional gamblers, 
as they made their living usually by that method rather than by 
other forms of work. 

The Use of Drugs .- There were two men out of the 129 
studied who were known to be addicted to the use of drugs. One 
had taken a s ix month period of treatment in the Ponoka i^ental 
Hospital but seemed to have returned to the habit within a few 
months after release. Both the men are completely enslaved by 
their drugs, and neither seems competent now to earn an honest 
living without supervision.

HeLigion of the Prisoners 

The distribution of the leading religious faiths among 
the prisoners studied is almost the sawe as that presented in 
Table IX with reference to tho parents of the men. The only 
significant difference lies in the fact that a number of the 
prisoners who gave the religious denomination of their parents 
declared that they themselves had no religion. Consequently 
the proportion of those claiming no religion is greater among 
the prisoners than among thoir parents. The fact that the dis¬ 
tribution of religions as given by the prisoners for themselves 
is almost the same as that given for their parents is one reason 
that no additional table is given to present the former. But 
furthermore a list of the religious denominations given by the 
men has little meaning. Lfeny of the men were giving the name 
of the religion which was claimed by the parents, whether or 
not they themselves had had any experience of that particular 
form of worship or belief. The religious traditions of the 
homes from which the men have come are indicated in general by 
the distribution in Table X. The denominational designations 
of both parents and prisoners are to a large extent merely 
nominal. 

Llore pertinent to the significance of the religious 
background is the account of the extent to which the men at¬ 
tended Sunday School and church themselves. The number of the 
men from whom this information was obtained with reasonable 
certainty is relatively small. The record given of Sunday 
School and church attendance is presented in the following 
tables•

Of the group whose experience is thus recorded the

Sunday School with some degree of regularity, -among the 45 who 
attended regularly 9,or 20 per cent^had done so because their 
parents had exerted pressure, rather than because they wished 
to attend. Twenty-two of the men estimated the age at which 
they had ceased to attend Sunday School and the arithmetical 
average of the ages was twelve years.

mo3t oasGS not such as to bear witness Lo its efficacy in their 
lives. I.Iany were utterly indifferent. "I've never given much 
thought to religion", was a frequent reply to any questioning 
on the matter, in a manner that plainly indicated a complete 
lack of significant interest. A very common view was that 
religion is a good thing but that it really has no relation to 
the kind of life a man lives. Others felt that the constant 
repetition of "don'ts" in religious teaching is a help to a 
young man in refraining from undesirable conduct. Some re¬ 
garded religious teaching as an essential part of the training 
of children, but had no clear idea of what such teaching was 
intended to accomplish, accepting it pretty much for granted 
as part of the regime of their home and therefore of good 
quality. Even these men v\/ho expressed approval of religious 
teaching in childhood felt for the most part that it was quite 
superfluous for adults. There were a fev/ who were decidedly 
antagonistic to religion, declaring it to be false and hypo¬ 
critical. They were chiefly among the group who had accepted 
some measure of socialistic or communistic doctrine. On the 
other hand were a few who believed in religion in a magical 
way. One of these was a middle-aged man who said: "If I be¬ 
lieve in Jesus Christ my sins will be forgiven. If a Lian does 
the way his Bible says and the way God says, there wouldn't be 
any gaol". He was very sincere in this statement of belief, 
yet he has served eighteen terms in gaol totalling over ten years. 
His apparently strong belief in a magical religion had come to 
mean nothing in terms of his actual conduct. Typical of the 











-92- 


aame type of religious attitude was the mental experienoe of 
a teen-age boy who had always attended Sunday School and ohuroh 
regularly but who had seen no connection at all between any¬ 
thing learned there and the habitual stealing of the gang of 
boys with whom he associated. There was just one young man out 
of the whole group interviewed who seemed to have had a real 
religious life. He had identified religion with morals and 
was struggling consciously to achieve victory in the battle 
between the higher and lower desires of his nature. Religion 
iias a real meaning for him; he is conscious of it as a power 
in his life associated with his own will. His experienoe of 
religion was a very marked exception to that commonly found 
among the prisoners. Ihe great majority had thought so little 
about it that they were content to express mild approval of the 
ohuroh and to consider the matter then closed as far as they 
were concerned. 


Age of Prisoners 

The table below presents in parallel columns age 
distributions of three groups: the 129 prisoners of the sample 
group studied, the 1188 prisoners entering the gaol during the 
year ending Liaroh 51, 1932, and the male population of Canada as 
at the census of 1921.

The group of prisoners entering the gaol during,the 
period of one year may be considered a fairly accurate repre¬ 
sentation of the gaol population as a whole. This group shows 
a much larger percentage of young men than does the total 
population of Canadian males. The class designated 10-19 
Includes for the gaol group only the ages 16-19 as 16 years Is 
the minimum age of admission to the gaol. This means that the 
10.2 per cent listed opposite this class In the gaol column Is 
for only the four years 16-20 Inclusive, while the 19.9 per cent 
In the corresponding position of the general population column 
Includes the ten years of 10-19 Inclusive. Consequently the 
percentage of the gaol population falling betv/een the ages of 
16 and 19 is somewhat larger than the percentage of the general 
male population falling within the same range of ages. The 


























- 94 - 


largest single group of ^he gaol population Is that between 
the ages of 20 and 29. It constitutes more than twice the per¬ 
centage of the total number of prisoners that the same age range 
constitutes of the total Canadian population. The men in the 
thirties and those In their forties also form a Larger proportion 
of the gaol group than of the total population, but he excess 
grows less as the age increases above thirty, /ifter the age of 
forty the percentage of each age group among the prisoners is 
less than the percentage of the corresponding age group of the 
general population. Ten per cent of the prisoners are between 
the ages of 16 and 19, almost one-half are under 30 and almost 
three-fourths are under 40. 

The figures as given in the table show that of the 
total population a larger percentage of young men are in the 
gaol than of the men of middle-age or more. This excess would 
have been greater, and would have indicated the true conditions 
more accurately, if the percentages for the total population had 
been calculated on the basis of adults only, excluding those 
under 16 years who may not legally be sentenced to gaol. 

The sample group of 129 prisoners includes a greater 
percentage of men under thirty years than does the total gaol 
group for the year. This is largely due to the fact that in 
selecting the sample a larger proportion of young men were 
chosen in the belief that more could be learned from those who 
were closer to the beginning of their careers.

the Ilotor Vehicles hot and the Liquor Act. The Railroad Tres¬ 
passing charges are almost all for stealing rides on trains, 
chiefly on freights.

Ciupr :r II 

repr^.3Ei;tativk life stories 

The problema presen.ed in this study can be properly 
oiiderstood only when approached with an appreciation of the 
individual lives which consuitute the gaol population, the 
problem of crime, like every social problem,' resolves itself 
finally into the problems of the individual life, and figures 
and generalizations are valueless unless they are interpreted 
in terms of the human individuals who constitute the group 
being studied. OhaxDter I has presented statistically and in 
general terms some of the factors and conditions in the bacit- 
ground of the men who are prisoners in Ft. Saanatchewan Gaol, 
Jhapter III will xDresent in similar form the criminal part of 
the careers of these men, and the relationships appearing between 
the earlier life factors and the later delinquencies. But tliese 
statistical summaries .uid general discussions can have real 
meaning for the reader only as he thinks of the individuals 
concerned as real human beings, it is in order to facilitate 
this approach that the present chax^ter outlines the life stories 
of a number of the men who within the past year have been 
prisoners in our provincial gaol. It is hoped that thus 
the multiplex factors which in isolation seem to be only of 
academic interest may take on something of the color and 
warmth of active human life, and that the summaries of facts 
and the discussions of general principles may in some measure 
grow together in interrelatedness to form a living picture of 
a group of human lives moving across the stage of our social 
and economic life in nlberta at the present time.

IJo group of lives oan be considered adequately repre¬ 
sentative of the gaol population, for each individual life is 
in itself unique, yet it is possible to select a number of life 
stories which do rei^resent certain fairly definite types of 
offender. The group of life stories presented in the follow¬ 
ing pages indicate a number of the factors of both personality 
and environment which are most comiaon among the prisoners in 
Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol. 


Bob 

Our first story is of an Edmonton boy whom we will call 
Bob. Bob was born in Edmonton in 1913, His father was a 
carpenter by trade, and by descent an Irish Protestant. His 
mother was of French parentage and born at St. Albert about the 
year 1888. The mother never attended school, and spent her 
youth on a farm in the St. Albert district. She is a Roman 
Catholic, but seldom attends church. 

The father and mother did not get along well together 
and before Bob was old enough to go to school the father left 
the home altogether and did not return. The mother was left with 
four children, two girls and two boys, of which Bob was the young¬ 
est. She set out to support her family by working at cooking, 
washing, scrubbing, and rough housework in general. Apparently 
finding the task of supporting the children a difficult one, 
she placed the three youngest in a Convent when Bob was five 
years old. In this institution the children were given lessons 
and Bob seemed to find life fairly satisfactory. 













- 99 - 


V/hen Bob was ton years old, he was adopted by a farmer 
and taken to live on a farm something over a hundred miles from 
Edmonton. Here his life was anything but ha^^py, for although 
the farmer's wife was kind, the farmer himself had a violent 
temper, and was a heavy drinker. Bob has vivid memories of 
being frequently kicked, knocked down and beaten. V/hen the 
farmer went into a passion, any weapons available were used to 
punish the boy, (including axe-handles and binder-whips.) 

Bob lived in continual fear, and as the wife too was afraid 
of the husband’s temper, she could do nothing on the boy's 
behalf. 

Bob was required to work quite hard while on the farm. 
Before and after school there were continual chores to do, and 
in the busiest seasons he was kept home from school to assist 
with- the farm work. V/hile attending school Bob spent such a 
large portion of his time working about Lhe farm that he seldom 
had time or energy left to apply to his studies, and during the 
seasons when he was kept at home he naturally lagged behind the 
other pupils in the work. He lost his interest in the school 
work, and failed to make good progress. 

During this time Bob had no contact at all with other 
boys or girls except during the hours that he was at school. 

His time at 'the farm was always occupied with work and he was 
never allowed .0 associate with visitors who came to the home. 
He found life very lonely, repressed and dreary, iilthough he 
remained with the farmer for nearly five years he claims in 
looking back that he was never happy for one day during that 
t ime .

As soon as Bob reached the age of fifteen and could 
be legally kept out of school, he was made to work on ihe farm 
ail of the time. There were no breaks in the monotony, never 
did he leave the farm even to make brief visits to neighboring 
farms, and now there was no longer the diversion of going to 
school. After a few months Bob felt that he could endure no 
longer the monotony, the loneliness, the cowed repression and 
in February, 1928, he ran away. A neighbor gave him enough 
money tc buy a ticket to Edmonton, and he arrived in the city 
alone on a winter evening. He had not been in the city for 
nearly five years, and he had not been at his home since the 
age of five, so he had very little idea how to find his way 
about. He walked about the streets all night, and in the 
morning discovered from some postmen how to find his home. He 
was placed in a Children's Home until the following spring. 

Then he returned to his mother’s house and stayed with her. 

It was during the ensuing months of enforced idleness 
that Bob first found his way into experiences of delinquency. 

He tried to find work, but wherever he apx)lied.was forced to 
admit that he was inexperienced except in farm work, and he was 
consistently turned down. His reluctance to go to the country 
to seek work can be readily understood in view of the unhappy 
years spent on a farm. Farm work was too closely associated 
in his mind with memories of misery for it to appeal to him at 
all. His mother was always busy all day long with her work, 
and had no time for him. His new existence of idleness he 
found almost as lonely and dreary as his previous farm drudgery 
had been. The only pastime that seemed to be open to one of

his background and his situation was that of loafing about the 
streets. Naturally he sought companionship, and he found it 
among boys who were situated in similar oircumstanoes, and whose 
lives were spent on the street. 

Among the boys with whom Bob thus became acquainted 
habits were common which were entirely new to him. Hetero¬ 
sexual relations became common with him for the first time. 

For some reason, Bob did not begin to smoke at this time, pro¬ 
bably because of lack of money. She lack of money had other 
consequences of quite another nature. She desire to have some 
of the things and to engage in some of the pastimes that appear 
to be common to other people must play a large part in the 
thinking of boys of the street who have little else to do but 
watch the activities of the people all about them, of the crowds 
who are continually entering theatres, eating in restaurants, 
and spending prolifically in all kinds of stores. She desire 
for money as a means of doing some of these attractive things, 
combined with the urge to activity that underlies the restless¬ 
ness of idle youth, soon overcame any inhibitions against steal¬ 
ing, once Bob's new associates had shown him that money could 
be obtained in that way. ■ She practice of pilfering small 
articles and disposing of them at second hand stores and other¬ 
wise, secured for the boys small amounts of money that were very 
attractive, and at the same time furnished interesting activity 
for the hours that had previously hung so heavily upon Bob's 
hands. One venture succeeded another, and courage grew until 
the small group attempted more dangerous enterprises, such as

entering empty houses. It was while on an expedition of this 
kind that Bob was first arrested by the police. As a consequence 
he was placed on probation for two years. 

Apparently the warning had little meaning, and certainly 
the probation, whatever its nature, was not very effective, for 
it was exactly two weeks later that Bob was again placed on 
trial for further charges as well as for the previous offence, 
and as there were now against him six charges of breaking, 
entering and theft, he was sentenced to two and one-half years 
in Prince Albert Penitentiary - a boy of barely sixteen years. 

Bob is of a sensitive, shy, retiring nature, and he 
felt the penitentiary sentence a very heavy blow. The two and 
a half years seemed such a long period to spend in prison that 
as he looked ahead he felt that he couLd never endure it. But 
he gradually became acquainted with the other prisoners and to 
feel more at home. He learned to mix with the older men, and 
incidentally he learned to smoke for the first time. In speaking 
of the experience some time afterward, Bob said: ”1 thought at 
first I wouldn’t be able to do the time - it seemed so long. 

But after a couple of months I got used to the ways of the 
place, and didn’t mind so much. But a fellow learns a lot of 
things there. I guess there’s no place where there’s so many 
bad things talked about as in gaols.” 

After his release from the penitentiary Bob returned to 
Sdmonton. He spent a short time at his mother’s home, but she 
could not afford to keep him. It was then the middle of the 
winter of 1921-32, and of course he could find no work around 
Edmonton, so he went on relief, iimong the group of men who

were receiving relief he met several whom he had known in the 
penitentiary. fhey were the only men in the whole city with 
whom he had had any experiences in common, and it was only from 
them that he reo ived any measure of friendship. It was in 
company with one of these ex-mates of the penitentiary, a feeble¬ 
minded drifter of thirty years who had’ served several gaol terms 
for petty theft and vagrancy, that Bob entered an Edmonton ware¬ 
house and along with his companion stole small articles of hard¬ 
ware. While trying to dispose of these articles at a second¬ 
hand store, the two men were arrested, and both were given three 
months in Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol. 

Bob hated the life in the gaol far more than he had hated 
that in the penitentiary, so much so, in fact, that while in 
the gaol he said it would have been better’ for him if he had 
been sent to the gaol the first time instead of to the penitent¬ 
iary, because the gaol life was so much more disagreeable that 
if he had served his first term there he might never have re¬ 
turned. In spite of this intensely bitter reaction against the 
regime of the gaol, and apparently strong determination to keep 
clear of gaols in tho future, it was less than four months 
after his release that he was sentenced to a third term, this 
time of four months, for further petty thefts. 

Bob has retained his sensitiveness of feeling to a 
large extent, and when interviewed during the last gaol term 
seemed to feel the experience as keenly as he had done on the 
previous occasion. He expressed regret for his association 
with the boy in whose company he was when arrested, but sought 

to justify himself on the grounds that he had no other companions 











-104- 


"I shouLdn^l have been going around with him, I guess, but its 
pretty tough when a feilow’s in the oity qnd hasn't anything 
to do. He wants to find somebody to walk around with and pass 
the time." This third term expired at the middle of February, 
1933, ond Bob was brought from Ft. iiaskatohewan to Hdmonton, 
deposited in the middle of the city without a cent in his pocket, 
and left once more to make his ov;n way. His economic condition 
was precisely the same as at his first arrest, tiiree and one- 
half years previously, but his mental condition was much less 

f 

favorable than at the time of first incarceration. During his 
stay in the penitentiary he became very nervous, and since that 
time he has been very conscious of being a "gaol-bird." He is 
fearful of people watching him on the street, he feels physically 
weak and shaky most of the time, and is always unhappy and de¬ 
pressed. She contacts that he has made during these three 

wholly 

years have been almost with men of criminal habits, and it 
is in terms of their world that, he now thinks. His attitude 
toward life is decidedly more bitter than before his experience 
in the gaols. The treatment which he has received from our 
Judicial and penal institutions has certainly had no effect 
whp.teYer that- would tend ’ to decrease his unsocial habits. 

Unless he is dealt with in some different way by agencies or 
individuals capable of seeing his needs and of treating him 
accordingly, the chances are very great that Bob will continue 
to pursue his present course of continual drifting and occasional 




orime .

Ilelvin 

Melvin is an eighteen y ar old youth representative of 
a number of young single men who were imprisoned for the first 
time in July 1932 on charges of trespassing on railroad prop¬ 
erty by riding freight trains. Melvin was born in Ontario, 
the son of a lumber-camp foreman who had always been steadily 
employed. Both the parents were of good habits, had a fair 
education, and attended church regularly. In a family of eight 
children Melvin was fourth, having three sisters older. He 
considers that his father was strict in his discipline when the 
children were small, but since leaving school and working away 
from home ^Dart of the tine, Melvin has been left pretty much 
to himself. 

Between the ages of seven years and twelve, Melvin 
attended school, and reached the Junior Fourth, corresponding 
to Alberta Grade YII. ■‘•^e liked some of his school work, but 
detested such subjects as grammar. He received a good number 
of strappings while at school, and played truant very occasion¬ 
ally. On the whole Melvin was quite indifferent to school, nd 
when at twelve years there came an opportunity to take a job 
as chore-boy around a lumber camp he accepted it. She parents 
were largely indifferent to the early school leaving. She job 
with the lumber camp lasted a year and a half. Then he worked 
on a farm for over a year at ^25.00 per month. 7/hen the farmer 
no longer needed him he returned to the lumber camp and worked 
there for one winter at about $35.00 per month. 

Up to the age of sixteen Melvin had worked mostly away 
from home, hut always near enough to his home that he often 












- 106 - 


visited It on woek-ends and at other Limoa. .\t sixteen there 
seemed to be no more work near home, so early in 1931 Lie Ivin 
left home and v.'ent to the southern part of Ontario, where he 
spent eight months working on farms and at road work for short 
periods. In Deoember of 1921 he returned home again und stayed 
tho rest of the winter with no work except a little trapping. 

In April 1st 1932 Mellvin left home again to search for 
work. A week at Llontreal brought no success. He then took 
the freight trains to the west, and found three weeks work on 
a farm at Prince Albert. Phe farmer needed him no longer, and 
again riding the freights he arrived at Galgary. As he still 
had some of his wages left he was able to see the Galgary. Ex¬ 
hibition, but he found no work in Galgary. Having given up .he 
propect of securing work before harvest time Melvin and a friend 
whom he had previously met in Edmonton on his way through from 
Prince Albert decided to go to Edmonton and to wait there for 
the harvest season. together with a very large crowd of 
’’travellers" the two men rode a freight from Galgary to Edmon¬ 
ton, and got off on the south side of the river. V.lien walking 
across the high level bridge the two men were arrested by a 
detective and later sentenced to a month of imprisonment on 
a. charge of trespassing on railroad property. 

Melvin has a mental age of about 13 years and 4 months, 
which according to most authorities is classed in the lower 
range of dull normal intelligence. He showed good ability on 
a mechanical test, ranking among zhe highest ZO^L of the gaol 
group tested. He displayed a fairly good range of general in¬ 
formation, grading among the first 15'^ of the gaol group on

the general inforraallon test. He is of an easy-going disposi¬ 
tion, taking life casually as it ooraes, seldom elated, seldom 
downoast. He dislikes the gaol, but is not greatly worried by 
being there. He has not written to his family during his im¬ 
prisonment, and lacks the initiative to decide whether or not 
he should do so . 

fhe facts impressed upon one by a study of He Ivin’s case 
are briefly these: His ability was not sufficiently high for 
the work of the ordinary school to appeal greatly to him. He 
was indifferent about school to the extent that he was willing 
to leave in order to accept a very ordinary job as chore boy. 

His rather good mechanical ability received no training or de¬ 
velopment. In the absence of guidance or training of any kind, 
Lie Ivin drifted into the jobs which were nearest at hand, and 
most likely to be given to men with no training. Laturally of 
a contented disposition, he would have been content to remain 
in the east at the same kind of work had not the depressed con¬ 
dition of the last few years made work there almost unobtainable 
for men of his type, kfter a brief period of idleness he set 
out to look for work in the belief that there must be some- some¬ 
where in Canada. His original intention was not to come further 
west than V/innipeg, but not finding work readily on farms near 
V/innipeg he proceeded to Sas^iatchewan and later to alberta. 
Natural dullness, lack of any training of the kind which he had 
the ability to absorb, and the tendency of business and 

depression to crowd out of employment those of least economic 
usefulness, seem to be the. general factors which have combined

to make him a drifter. 

It is not easy to say what will be th effect in the 
life of this eighteen year old boy of his month in gaol. He 
is too lethargic in disposition, too lacking in sensitiveness, 
to be maoh affected in his life attitude. That any value will 
come to him from the experience is not apparent. Certainly as 
a warning the gaOl term is utterly ineffective, for it was 
Melvin's intention to continue riding freights on his release 
since to go somewhere, and lie had no money to pay his way. 

Hor does the gaol experience in any obvious way tend to minimize 
any of the factors which were indicated above as having contri¬ 
buted to his drifting and therefore to his arrest. On the pos¬ 
itive side the only value of the sentence appears to be that 
it has removed from circulation for a^ period of one month a 
young man who because of naturally weak ability and of economic 
misfortune has become one of the unemployed, hnd on the negative 
side, certainly the experience has introduced the boy to a type 
of social contact which can hardly be considered constructive. 

J im 

Jim is the son of an Irish-Ganadian farmer of Quebec. 

He -was born in 1889, the youngest of three children. When ten 
years of of age he attended school for three months, but he did 
not like school, and attended no longer. His father had no ed¬ 
ucation but was in comfortable circumstances, fhe family rela¬ 
tionships were happy, and Jim remained at home working on the 
farm until eighteen years old. Then he spent three years working 







-loy- 

In logging camps, and came west at the age or twenty-one. In 
Saskatoon he round a job driving a team, and then worKea at 
various places mostly on rarms and in the woods until 
Three years or service in the war resulted in a wounded leg 
and a nervousness that lasted ror some time, but no permanent 
injury is known. Alter the war Jim returned to tne western 
provinces, and during the years since has roamed aoout I'rom 
one job to another, usually working on farms or in lumber camps. 

Since the time that Jim began to work he has been in 
the habit or drinking occasionally, and during the laso lev/ 
years the habit has grown. It is his custom after leaving each 
of his short time jobs to come into one of the cities and to 
enjoy himself for a time by loafing about and spending part 
or his money on liquor. His weakness for liquor became such 
that every time he began to drink he continued until he was 
completely intoxicated. Since 13^2j?, when he was thirty-six 
years of age, Jim has experienced a series of arrests for 
vagrancy, drunkenness, creating disturbance, and breach of the 
liquor act. During the one year of 1^30 he was convicted of 
such offences on seven different occasions in four different 
towns or cities. The penalties varied from small fines v/ith 
gaol terms in default, to a three month gaol term without option. 
Jim continued to work for short periods and during the inter¬ 
missions spent "holidays'*in the cities or larger towns enjoying 
liquor to an extent that frequently brought him into contact 
with the police. At the time of interview he was serving a six 
month term for vagrancy. That was his twentieth conviction, at

least,in the past seven years. 

•i'he world in which Jim has lived has always been very 
narrowly ciroamsoribed. He has known only the life of the 
logging-camp laborer, the farm hand, and the bar-room idler. 

His lack of education and very limited ability to read has pre¬ 
vented his field of interest from widening beyond that of his 
Immediate contacts. He has not desired to do other than tlB 
simplest laboring jobs, and probably has not the ability to do 
any work requiring more than a minimum amount of skill. His 
intelligence level borders on that of mental deficiency and he 
is thus too dull to be concerned about his situation at any time. 
He is of cheerful disposition and very good-humored. His at¬ 
titude toward life and people is kindly, and he accepts what¬ 
ever fortune comes to him with very little complaint. 

The prospects are that Jim will continue his life in 
just the same way as in the past, in a sequence of short time 
jobs, I'iquor-dr inking festivals, and gaol terms. He realizes 
that once he takes even a small drink of liquor his self-control 
is gone, but he does not desire to desist altogether from drink¬ 
ing . 

If we consider that by such a routine of life, men such 
as 'Jim are filling a satisfactory place in our social order, 
why do we seek to punish them by intermittent periods of in¬ 
carceration? If we do not believe that such conduct is conducive 
to social well-being, the rational line of action is that which 
seeks a method of treatment of such men that will actually 
affect their future behaviour.

George 

George is a boy of seventeen who was Interviewed while 
serving a sentence of nine months on a charge of breaking, enter¬ 
ing and stealing, lie is the son of German Lutheran parents, 
who came to Canada just before tho war and have Lived in Kdmon- 
ton most of the time since. I’he father is a butcher, but during 
the recent difficult times has^found difficulty in providing for 
the’ family, has been too proud to accept city roiiof, and 
has retained possession of a house in poorer part of the city. 
Hhere are five children in the family, of whom George is the 
second oldest. fhe home was fairly hapxDy, and the father exer- • 
cised enough interest in the conduct of the children that fre¬ 
quent strappings were administered but in a way that George did 
not resent. 

When George was eight or nine years of age he began 
selling newspapers on the downtown street corners. It was while 
at this task that he met associates to whom he attributes the 
habits of delinquency which he has since practised. Boys older 
than himself invited him to join them in a method of making 
money which they claimed to be easier than seiling papers. Ihe 
method was that of "lifting" small articles in the l-,rge stores 
and seiling them again to men on the street. Sometimes they 
were caught at this game by the police and given warning. A- 
ware that a police warning meant the notification of his parents, 
and fearing a strapping when returning home, George sometimes 
ran away from home for periods of two or three days. 

George ^3 progress at school was not good. He did not 
like the school work and soon began to play truant with the older

boys whom he had met wliile selling papers. Playing truant from 
school and home at the same time groups of Iho bojs ocoaslonally 
0 1Imbed on freight trains to spend a few days out of the city. 
While attending school George spent very few evenings at home, 
but was usually enjoying himself without discipline of any kind 
with his boy friends on the streets. When thirteen years of 
age and only In Grade V George left school altogether. 

hbout a year later he was arrested for stealing money 
from milk bottles, and was sent to the Keformatory at Portage 
La Prairie. George maintains now that he was treated too well 
at the Reformatory for the term to do him any good. Ke met 
many boys from V/innlpeg whom he claims were much worse than any 
he had icnown in Edmonton. Lfter a stay of a little more than 
one year he relumed to his home. 

Luring the next two y )ars George worked at various odd 
jobs, often on farms near Edmonton. Kis pastimes were baseball, 
rugby and skating, of which sports he was very fond. Each 
summer the family spent some time camping at a lake near Edmon¬ 
ton and hers George particularly enjoyed the fishing. It seems 
that only once during these two years did George come into con¬ 
tact with the police. In comxDany with one of the boys with 
whom he had formerly sold papers he broke into a store. He was 
arrested, but dismissed, ax^parently because his record for some 
time had been good. 

In the spring of 1932 G-:orge and his brothers undertook 
to operate a garden farm near Edmonton. They bought the little, 
farm and the three brothers had been living on it for a few 
weeks when George was arrested* The charge was that of breaking 










-LL3- 


into an unoccupied house and removing various articles, and the 
offence had been committed some time previousiy in comp...ny with 
another of the friends of the early paper seliing days. It was 
during the serving of this nine month term th: t the int rvicws 
with G orge took place. 

George’s intelligence test rating is that of border-line 
deficiency, but his mechanical ability is very good. His inter¬ 
ests tend toward the mechanical. He owns a oar of his own and 
is fond of dissembling and reassembling it. He has no particular 
ambitions but is very active and likes to work. His range of 
general information as measured by a test rated slightly less 
than that of an average Grade VII pupil. In disposition George 
is quiet and inclined to be sullen. He is too dull to be very 
resentful of his imprisonment, but is anxious to be released. 

George seems to possess ability and activeness that 
qualify him to do good mechanical work under supervision, but 
his outlook on life and his mental limitations are such that 
he is not likely to become a satisfactory member of society 
without some measure of supervision.

the mother with four children, of which Sam was Lhe second. A 
grandmother raaue it possibie for Sam to continue in schooi unt ii 
the age of i8 y^ars despite the poverty of the famiiy. He went 
as far as Grade XI taking technical school in the afternoons 
during the three years of high school. Sam liked the machine 
work of the technical schooi, and planned to train to be a 
machinist. Ihe death of his grandmother in 1950 made it 
necessary for Sam to leave school and to return to his home. 

Ills elder brother was on city relief and Sam too found it im¬ 
possible uo get work, except two weeks of fruit picking. 

The home became very unhappy. The eldest brother was 
earning a small amount by working on city relief. This pro¬ 
vided groceries for the family, but barely enough foar their 
existence. Sam’s relations with his mother were good, bdt both 
he and his brother were too moody tn get along well together, and 
the members of the family were all worried and dejected on ac¬ 
count of the lack of work, the poverty, and the poor prospects 
for the future. Finally, late in June, 1952, Sam left home not 
intending to return. He was so dejected th-t he says he often 
felt like committing suicide. V/ithout any definite plans for 
the future, he and a friend left Victoria, intending first to 
seek work at Kelowna picking fruit. Finding themselves too 
early for the fruit season, they decided to wait until apple 
p>ioking began. In the meantime Sam’s friend suggested that if 
they visited some relatives of his near Edmonton they might find 
w-ork there, hccordingiy they rode a freight train to Calgary. 
When they were waiting in the Calgary yards for a freight to 
Edmonton a brakeman told them that there would not be one for

In the darkness they climbed on the tender of the passenger 
locomotive, but only travel ied as far as Ked Deor, v\'here they 
wore arrested and sentenced to twenty days in gaol. 

Grioomy and letliargic in disposition Sam offers little 
protest against the gaol regime, in fact ho was so discouraged 
and depressed before his sentence that his feelings liave been 
changed very little, he is of dull normal mentality, but tested 
considerably above average in mechanical ability and in general 
information. He dislikes travelling about, and would like to 
get steady work, preferably with machinery. He does not drink 
or smoke but has had occasional heterosexual relations since 
sixteen years of age. He has no plans for the future because 
he sees no prospect of any steady work and expects to merely 
drift from place to place. 

3am possesses sufficient intelligence and mechanical 
ability, and sufficient interest in that kind of work to make 
his chances’ for satisfactory economic adjustment good if he 
could be provided with steady emjployment of a mechanical nature 
requiring only a medium amount of ability. It is needless to 
say tiiat tuo exxDC' ience in the gaol has done him no good for 
he - intends to travel about without paying train fare just as 
he has done in the past, except that he will be more likely to 
limit himself to freight trains in future. Hot possessed of a 
keenly receptive nature he will not likely be much changed in 
outlook by the experience of detention, although he does speak 
of the large number of conversations he has listened to while

oomniitted. Sam's fundamental diffioully is that of finding a 
suitable place in an economic order v.'hich at the present time 
presents difficulties too great to be overcome by one of his 
limited training and ability. That is the difficulty which must 
be met by any form of treatment‘which would attain the least 
measure of success in dealing with cases such as this one.

Morris is twenty-nine years of age and has been sent¬ 
enced to terms in gaols and penitentiaries totalling ten-years. 
He was born in Ilichlgan and his home has always been on a farm. 
The parents separated when Morris was seven or eight years old, 
and he and his brother were kept by the. father. The father 
moved about a good deal, so that the school attendance - of the 
boys was badly broken up. But Morris -liked school, made good 
progress, and came within a year of finishing public school. 

\Taea he was fourteen he accompanied his father to hlberta, 
where they later took up a farm not far from Edmonton. Morris 
was restless and soon Left the farm t: find work elsewhere, 
frequently returning home to spend the winter. He travelled 
about freely in Alberta and Saakatchewan working at various jobs 
and finding a certain satisfaction just in moving about. D'uring 
part of this time he had a job as sub-foreman on railway con¬ 
struction crews, and could have continued longer but he was not 
completely satisfied with the work and left it simply because 
he desired a change. 

When he was twenty-one Morris was in Edmonton and found

hiraself attracted by an auto parked in an Uiigaarded ax^ot. He 
.treated himself to a joy-ride and was subsequantiy arrested for 
automobile theft. He was released on probation for a period 
of two years, and Salvation Army officers took responsibility 
for his supervision. He was given work as night clerk in the 
Salvation Army building, ^hree months later the building took 
fire in the night, and although the blaze was immediately ex¬ 
tinguished Morris was convicted on a charge of arson, and 
sentenced to a three year term in Prince Albert Penitentiary. 

He was released at the expiration of the term in April of 19E7. 
After spending a few weeks at home he secured a job driving a 
taxi in Edmonton. 

Three months later Morris was in Oalgary, and again 
found himself attracted by a car to the extent that he went for 
a joy-ride on the highway outside of the city. When returning 
to the city with.the alleged intention of leaving the oar once 
more on the street, he ran out of gas and v/hile in this pre¬ 
dicament aroused suspicion and was arrested. He was sentenced 
by a Oalgary court to two years of hard labor, and was returned 
to the penitentiary at Prince Albert. During this term Morris 
learned the ^rade of a baker and when he was released in the 
spring of 1929 he was given a ticket to Winnipeg where he in¬ 
tended to secure work as a baker. The attempts to secure such 
work were unsuccessful and he undertook to canvass for a dry 
cleaning company. Business had already become poor, and he 
derived very little income from his attempts. The $10.00 given 
to him on release from the penitentiary was soon gone and al¬ 
though he lived in a cheap room he failed to secure enough

work to pay for his living. Kis health had been poorer s Inoe 
a severe attack of fla during the first penitentiary term, and 
at this t i..ie his situation worried him and his nerves became 
bad. He found the ^revious imprisonments a coavoniont excuse 
for conduct which he ^cnew was entirely wrong, especially since 
he felt the second term for arson to be quite uiideserved, and 
he began to collect a little money to live by stealing clothes 
from hotel rooms and selling them to second hand stores. He 
wished to gather enough money to go to Llissouri where his 
brother was living, for he felt that he would improve his lot by 
changing his location. Before a month had passed he was 
arrested and convicted on nine charges of stealing clothes. 
Iknother three year penitentiary term was imposed, this time 
to be served in Stony Mountain Penitentiary. 

xkt his release in October 1931 he was returned to 
Winnipeg. He looked for work and went to the employment office 
several times, i-he chances for employment appeared very slight 
and it did not seem that he was eligible for VUnnipeg relief. 

He decided to return to Hlberta to people whom he knew, and 
accordingly rode the freights in the direction of Oalgary. At 
a town in the eastern part of alberta he stopped off to visit 
some friends with whom he had worked in earlier years. In the 
night, while walking down the street of the town toward tne 
station where he intended to take the train for Jalgary, he 
noticed a large crack in the window of a store. It appeared 
an opportunity to take some of the goods within, and his weak¬ 
ness for the things which attract him led him to do what he 
really knew quite well was foolish as well as wrong. As a 






1 ’, 






resuLt he spent thr.e months in the Lethbridge frovinoiai Gaol. 

V/hen released in January of 1952 he received a ticket 

to Strathmore, and visited there with friends for whom he had 

worked when his father had farmed in the district many years 

previously. He expected to find work there, but lh.;re Wi.s none 

to be had, and the friends advised him to go homo. He went to 

Calgary, met some people he knew, borrowed lived 

for a time in rooming-houses. He felt too restless uO seek 

work, but tooK advantage of relief meals that were being given 

in the city at that time. Before many days-he met a friend 

who was driving to Edmonton by oar. and they set out togeiher. 

Cn .he way the supply of gas became exhausted, and they stole 

some to carry them on their way. I’he car too was found to heve 

been stolen, and Llorris was sentenced to two years less one day 

in the Ft. Saskatchewan Provincial Gaol. 

Interviewed several times, while serving this term, 
quite 

Llorris was found*^ready to converse,, and very straightforward 

in his way of talicing. He was diagnosed by a psychiatrist as 

psychopathetic, of a too facile disposition, as well as of 

borderline intei1igence . He has a fairly clear sense of right 

and w’rong, and quite a rational view of life in general, much 

' conversat ion failed to reveal any noticeably warped attitudes, but 

y showec decided immaturity of thought. He admits qui^e freely

desired in order to enjoy iife. Ke is determined that he wiii 
not be an offender again, bat he is qaite oonsoioas of his 
weakness, and realizes tiiat some change of environment or some 
saDisf .ctory employment wiii be necessary if he is not to make 
similar mistaices in the future, he has no definite plans, and 
in fact, changes his inLentions from ti ue to time through sheer 
instability of mental outlook, xie is very much out of touch 
with the normal world, for auring the seven year period from 
his first sentence to the time that he will be released from 
the present term he has spent, less than five months as a free 

Lian. 

■^he basis of Idorris* trouble is his weakness of mentality 
and of personality. i'he succession of gaol and penitentiary 
terms has done nothing more constructive than to keep him away 
from society during the periods of his incarceration. If the 
extent of our aim in such oases is to remove the men from the 
freedom which they are too weak not to abuse, they ought t© be 
so removed permanently and under more oonetruotive conditions 
than those of a series of expensive offences, trials, and im¬ 
prisonments. if our aim includes a desire oo find for the in¬ 
dividual some such place in society as he no oo ubt has the 
ability to fill under suitable supervision, our method should 
be one which takes into intelligent consideration his capacities, 
his weaknesses, and his needs.

CHAPTER III 

ANALYSIS OF CAUSES OR COHTRIBUTIHG FACTORS 

Ihe Search For Causes .- The purpose of this chapter is 
to search for causes of the deiinquenoy in the Lives of the men 
we are studying. Our survey of the background and environmentai 
factors in the Lives of the gaol inmates has produced a picture of 
great diversity and complexity. The representative life stories 
have in no case pointed to single specific factors as responsible 
for .he delinquent behaviour. But progress in social studies de¬ 
pends upon a full realization that there is a cause or a set of 
causes for every event and every condition in human life, and that 
the farther we can push our analysis of human lives toward the 
more fundamental factors in the series of causes; the fuller and 
more practically valuable will be our understai.ding of human be¬ 
haviour. Causal relationships in human life are, however, exceed¬ 
ingly complex. Seldom can any one factor be isolated as directly 
and wholly responsible for a given manner of behaviour on the part 
of any individual. Causative factors of human behaviour do not 
occur separately, but in complex series of varied and intricate 
interrelationships. But detailed study of individual lives does 
reveal leading factors which contribute to the behaviour observed. 
Something of the interrelationships and the relative strength, of 
various factors can be determineo., and by careful and critical 
study 0 one lus ions of practical value can be reached. In a study 
of this nature dealing wich the field of delinquent behaviour we 
cannot expect to produce an analysis that will indicate the 
specific factor respoi^sible for .he anti-social behaviour of a.. 











- 122 - 


group of men or even of an individual. Indeed we must recognize 
that such a specific and direct causal relationship probably does 
not exist. But we can expect to discover by detailed analysis 
some of the factors which have contributed to the particular line 
of conduct that has brought the individual into conflict with 
society. V/e can expect to see relationships of various environ¬ 
mental conditions and personal characteristics to one another and 
to the course of behaviour pursued, hone of the f.otors thus dis¬ 
covered to be causative can be considered absolute or final, but 
each must be recognized to depend upon other factors earlier or 
more fundamental in the series. Our conclusions will thus present 
conceptions of delinquent behaviour and its antecedent events and 
conditions that are still complex and relative, and that merge 
at almost every point into fields of human life demanding further 
study and more intensive analysis. Such conclusions leave us un- 
sac isf led, for our minds crave solutions characterized by simplicity, 
directness, and finality, but our conclusions are of the only kind 
that can be reached sincerely at the present time in dealing with 
the highly sensitive and infinitely complex qualities of human 
personality, and they are rewardingly fruitful for guidance in 
both practical application and further study. 

Causal relationships are not determined by the mere 
enumeration of the characteristics and conditions found in the 
early lives of those who have later become delinquent, for as 
Healy points out in his /’Individual Delinquent" many factors may 
exist simultaneously in a life without causal relationship of 
any kind necessarily being implied. However, the individual can 
be understood only as he reacts in and to his environment, and

a full understanding depends upon a knowledge of the factors of 
environment and development. In discussing specific causal factors 
in this chapter we shall therefore, recapitulate some of the major 
findings set forth in our precedin' survey of the previous ex¬ 
perience of the prisoners, thus seeking to relate specific aspects 
of the early life history to the delinquency of the individuals 
concerned. But it is only in relation to the whole of each indi¬ 
vidual life that we can understand the causal significance of any 
factor or condition, fhe enumerations in this chapter which have 
real and immediate value for the understanding of the causes of 
delinquency are those in which each factor is recorded in terms 
of its relation to uhe delinquency of the individual concerned. 

V/hen in the light of knowledge of the life history, those factors 
are recorded which are seen to have contributed to the course of 
behaviour that has led to delinquency, and when similar findings 
are summarized for the group of men being considered, the results 
have genuine value as indications of causes of crime. 

V/e shall proceed to discuss the re ia c-ionships existing 
between the major factors of life experience and uhe delinquency 
of the men in this group. 

fhe Home and Be 1 in^puency . - ht the present stage of study 
in psychology and sociology there seems little doubt that the 
home is the largest and most fmidamental factor in determining 
the course followed by each individual life, fhe home influence 
is so comprehensive and far-reaching that it is difficult to re¬ 
gard any experience of later life apart from the mould that the 
home has been and the impact that it has given. V7hatever the

inherlted oapaoitiea may be, it is largely the home that determines 
the extent to whioh they are realized. It is the home atmosphere 
that fixes in large measure tho emotional (qualities, the manner of 
thvUght, and the habits of behaviour. A knowledge of tiie home 
GO.editions oannot fail to give some concept ion of zhe initial trend 
given to tho individual life. Jhere follows a aiscussion of 
various factors in the home lives of ih^ prisoners with whom wo 
have been dealing in this study. 

Over twe-fifths of the prisoners in the group were i.orn 

(a) 

outside of Canada. This means that in each of these cases either 
the home was moved during the childhood of the subject or the a- 
dult life was lived in a country other than that for which the early 
home training had given preparation. 8.7 per cent of the group 
werj born in the United States, 21.4 per cent In the British Isles, 
and 12.7 por cent in Europe. ' In the case of each of these groups, 
and particularly with the men of European origin, immigration to 
Canada had involved a change of social environment and the necessity 
of finding adjustment to a different set of social standards and 
laws. In addition to uhe group of men.born in European countries, 
16.7 per cent of those interviewed were born on this continent of 
European parents. In a large number of these cases the children 
had- lived in a dual environment, because their parents had 


(a) The group studied includes a much smaller percentage of Europeans 
born than does the general population of the gaol, because as 
indicated in Chapter I only those Europeans were interviewed 
whose command of English vuas fairly satisfactory. The uotal 
number of 1188 prisoners entering uhe gaol during the year 
ending llarch 31, 1932 included 58.5 percent of non-Canadian born. 

(b) Similarly the total gaol group for the year included 35.0 per 
cent of European born.

retained the Language, oustoms, aiid sooial standards of their 
mother country, whiie it was necessary for the chiidren to attend 
an Engiish sohooi and to take their piace in a community whose 
sooiai Life was markediy different from that represented in their 
homes, fhe resuit vA’as inevitabiy some measure of ouiturai con- 
fiiot ia ihe Lives of che chiidren, for oniy with great difficuity 
couid they adjust themseives to the thought forms and ideais of 
the outside community as weii as to those of their homes, fhe 
extent to which such a situation has been a factor in the back¬ 
grounds of the prisoners studied is indicated by the fact that over 
one-fourth of them came from homes in which another Language in 
addition to Engiish was regulariy spoken, fhe confiict of cuitures 
and the difficuity of adjustment lo new sociai modes appear aiso 
in the case of immigrants from the British Isies, aithough naturai- 
iy in Less degree than in famiiies originating in Europe. In a 
stiii smaiier degree this situaiion is true of the families moving 
from the United otates to Canada, hut in aii immigrating famiiies 
the change of country inevitabiy contributes to the instabiiity 
of the home, and increases for both chiidren and parents the dif¬ 
ficuity of sooiai adjustment. Factors which thus tend to augment 
sooiai maiadjustment certainly increase the probabiiity of crime. 

It has been indicated (Pages 40-42) that the nationalities 
most heavily represented in the gaoi population in proportion to 
their share in the general popuiation of Alberta are those of the 
Central Europeans, i’he highest ratio of gaoi sentences to popuia¬ 
tion is that of the Poiish, and next in order come Ukrainians, 
Austrians, Roumanians, Germans, Russians, and Swedish. These

faots by no means jastify Ihe conolusion that the nationalities 
mentioneci are those most diaposed to oriminal oonaact. Facts to 
be considered in interpreting' proportionate shares in the gaol 
population are that the area served by the Ft. bashatchewan Gaol 
includes a larger percentage of foreign born than other sections 
of iilberta, and that immigrant populations usually include a very 
large proportion of adult males, which is .he only group consider¬ 
ed in our gaol study, it seems to be true that when-a llowance is 
made for factors such as these, the immigrants and children of im¬ 
migrants, especially of Central European countries, constitute a 

disproportionately large share of the gaol group. She explanation 

I 

probably lies very largely in the conflict of social customs and 
standards, and in the changes of cultural and administrative en¬ 
vironment which we have discussed above, hn example of the type 
of administrative regulation which increases the difficulty of 
social adjustment for the immigrant is our liquor law. During 
the ye r ending l.iarch El, 19E2, E07 men were sentenced to Ft. 
Saskatchewan Gaol for violations of the liquor lot, anu of these 
a large number were of European Suock. Selecting the month of 

July, 1932 as representative we find that of thirty-five liquor 
over 

offences ^ fifty per cent were committed by European born, al¬ 
though the gaol population included an average of thirty-five per 
cent of European born. Ilany of these men expressed i.jdignation 
at their imprisonment for offences such as the manufacture of 
liquor in their homes, which they could not understand to be 
offences at all. 

Besides those prisoners whose early years were spent in 
immigrant homes, a‘group of French Canadians had also experienced

stituted 8.7^0 of th ^ ^otal number of men studied. 

iin adequate home training is very often i.-revented in 
homes that are made incomplete by the absence of one or both 
parents. 2he nature of family relationships is such that the 
home does not as readily play its part in facilitating the social 
orientation of the children when there has been a removal of one 
of the parents so tlaat t .ere is no longer one to earn the living 
a^.d one .to care for the home. In the homes of 38.0/j of our group 
of prisoners one of the parents had been absent by separation or 
one or both parents by death. The life stories of the men v?ho 
came from these disrupted homes made it clear in most oases that 
the ii.completeness of the home had proven a detrimental factor 
in the total home situation, seriously limiting the training 
received by the children. 

^mong the factors recorded in particular case histories 
as appearing very directly in a causal relation to the delinquency 
of the individual were several concerning the home, ihey are 
listed below with the frequencies of occurrence, and the per¬ 
centage of the whole group in which they seemed to have contri¬ 
buted definitely oO the delinquency.

In addition to the factors listed above as directly 


contributive to delinquency in some of the oases, and in ad¬ 
dition also to the major and obviously causative factors of 
cultural conflict anu incomplete homes, are many conditions a- 
mong those prevailing in the homes which are more subtle in 
their influence, but which form a part of the whole home'envirorj- 
ment and its character-shaping power. Lrnong such are the number 
of children in the home, the habits and characters of the parents, 
and the attitudes of the various members of the family to one 
another. Our group includes a large proportion of men who were 
members of large families. Forty-eight per cent of the group 
were from homes containing more 'th n five children and thirteen 
per- cent were members'of families numbering ten or more children. 
It.is seldom that the members of families as large as those indi¬ 
cated receive from the parents the persona], interest and care 
w^hich is usually found in smaller families. 


The habits of the fathers were not in the majority of 


oases such as to indicate the best type of moral atmosphere. 
Two-thirds of the men reported that their fathers were users of 




















-L28- 


aloohol, ‘^nd lZ,Vp of : he group oonsidered their faihors heavy 
drinkers. Four-fifths of the fathers ^vere found to be users of 
tobaooo. Partiouiariy significant are the f .cts that of 

the men reporte. th;;t their fathers had been oriminaily con¬ 
victed in the courts, and that l4Jj^ reported the same concerning 
their brothers. in view of the fact that oii the same basis of 
recording probably less th-.n one per cent of the hiberta poi-uLa- 
tion have criminal records, the percentages given are decidedly 
high. Apparently a number of the prisoners come from homes in 
which court records are not unknov^n, and in which the familiarity 
with such experiences on the part of other members of the family 
must be an influence rendering delinquency more commonplace than 
it is for the children of the general population. 

The education.of the parents is always a considerable 
factor in determining the cultural influence of the home.' In 
our group of prisoners only IhJ^y oonsidered their parents to have 
had a good amount of education, 45.0J5 a fair amount, and 39.3^. 
very little. Here again we find that in a large number of the 
cases which we are studying the home influence was not such as to 
give the men a reasonably good cultural background. 

V/e have indicated in Table XV nd the subsequent dis¬ 
cussion that a large number of the men regarded the relationships 
of their homes with apathetic indifference, that very few spoke 
of them with any warmth of appreciation, and that at least 14.4'^ 
had found their homes decidedly unhappy. It seems reasonable 
that men who come from homes where the relationships are strained, 
or even where there is merely a lack of cordiality, are less

likely than others to develop the attitude of goodwill which is 
essential to satisfactory social adjustment, and mor^- likely to 
develop that anti-sooial attitude wliioh leads to criminal be¬ 
haviour . 

i'he cordiality of the home relationships is a considerable 
factor in determining the age at which young men leave home. ,Ve 
find that of this group of prisoners at least one-fourth left 
their homes at the time that they did because of the failure of 
the home in one way or another. As indicated in Xable aVI one- 
fifth of the men left home before they were past seventeen. ihe 
home background was found largely responsible for the age of home 
leaving, and in a number of cases the early age of Leaving was a 
factor contributing to the later delinquency. 

^s has been indicated above, a number of factors of the 
home situation were found to have contributed directly 
delinquency of some of the prisoners. There were many other 
ways in which the home background influenced delinquency in¬ 
directly. The home determined largely the social background, Lhe 
economic status, and the occupational success of the various in¬ 
dividuals. These factors in turn affected the generaj. relation¬ 
ship of the men with society, and seemed to be responsible in 
large measure for their delinquent behaviour. 

Social Glass and Delinquency .- The social classes 
represented among our group of prisoners are indicated in Table 
XKII. The laboring class provided the social environment of 
46.2% of them, 59.5% came from farm homes, and only 14.5% were 
of the business or professional classes. These figures indicate 
that for the most part the prisoners studied came from the classes

that are ordinarily considered in Alberta as tho lowest in the 

social scale. One reason for this preponderance of those whose 

homes have been of the lowes. social class is that such classes 

have fewer resources at their disposal, either cultural or 

material, for t :e constructive use of leisure time. Our social 

system does very little to provide constructive leisure activ- 
lack or 

ity for those whoseAabiIity or income prevents .hem finding such 

activities themselves. The result is that both the young people 
the 

and^adults of the laboring class spend their spare time in idle¬ 
ness or learn to indulge in pastimes that are even more likely 
than idleness to lead in the direction of delinquent behaviour. 

In more th^^n one-third of the individual oases which we have 
studied idleness was judged to be a direct factor in the causa¬ 
tion of delinquency. 

Economic Life and Delinquency .- The figures of Table 
iOilll indicate chat nearly eighty per cent of the prisoners 
studied came from homes which could not be considered economical¬ 
ly "comfortable". A few of the families were on relief, and 
zhe remaining seventy per cent were of marginal economic status. 
Forty-six per cent of the group were of laboring parentage. 

Quite obviously the grocep represents the poorer section of our 
Alberta pojpulation. But it would be far from justifiable to 
conclude that therefore the laboring man is possessed of much 
more criminal propensity than the neighbor of other occupational 
groups. There are many reasons for believing that the percentage 
of gaol sentences to offences is much larger among those of limit¬ 
ed economic means than it is among those more comfcrtably situat-

ed. Although It has not been within the scope of this study to 
investigate the point there seems to be evidence that those of 
the laboring class who commit minor infractions of the law are 
much more likoly to be arrested and convicted lh...n similar 
offenders of the business and professional classes. Moreover 
the largest number of sentences imposed by the magistrate's 
court, in which the prisoners studied have nearly all been 
sentenced, are those of a gaol term with the option of a fine. 
C-uite naturally, as a general rule, the laboring man goes to 
gaol because he lacks the money to pay the ‘fine, and the man of 
higher social and economic status pays his fine in almost all 
cases where- an option is given. When allowance has been mada 
for these discriminating factors it remains true that homes of 
poverty furnish conditions conducive to criminal conduct more 
frequently than homes of economic comfort. The economic pressure, 
the lack of cultural environment, and the associations into which 
those of poorer working homes are necessarily thrown, are all 
factors which tend to turn the life of the working class young 
person in the direction of those ways of living which promote 
delinquent behaviour. 

In the consideration of the individual case histories 
there were recorded a number of factors in the economic sphere 
which were judged to have contributed directly to the criminal 
conduct. These factors are listed in the table below with the 
percentages of cases in which they v;ere considered causative.

'Jhe table shows a definite relationship between ihe 
type of worker and the xreqaei;oy of offences. The ’’Drifter" 
groap includes 7£.U^ of recidivists while the group of steady 

includes 

workers'^only 27.o;b of recidivists. On the oth.r hand the per¬ 
centage of ist offenders is three times as great among the 
steady workers as among the drifters. Th.; men who do not work 
are s iocty per cent recidivists, and only ten per cent steady 
workers. There is practically no difference in the distribution 
of offences among steady workers and that among the "Hovers". 

On the whole it is clearly indicated that the men who have been 
most often in the gaols are the men who have made the poorest 
occupationa1 adj ustment. 

Unemployment has been a large factor in the past ex¬ 
perience of the men of this group. Only 14.7^^ were regularly 
employed at the time of committing the offence for which they 
were serving a sentence, and over sixty per cent were totally 
unemployed at that time, ^his percentage of unemployed is 
much greater among the men of the gaol group than in the gen¬ 
eral population of i^lberta. In many of the life histories a 
definite causal relation was evident between the failure to 
find employment and the offence leading to arrest . hll of ihe 
men in this group who had been arrested for riding trains were 
engaging in that kind of travel because of the difficulty of 
finding work. The pressure of economic need accompanying un¬ 
employment was the stimulus to theft in many more oases. The 
worry and concern of being unemployed had in many oases quite 
obviously been a factor in disorganizing the personality and 
undermining the adjustment to society, oome of the men who 





-134- 


had been unable to find work for some time had beoome so in¬ 
dignant and biiter that their attitude to society vms openly 
antagonistic. In ail of these cases (.he economic difficulty 
had been the immediate factor in causing antisocial behaviour. 

Economic pressure was also the immediate cause of a 
number of the men leaving school at an early age. The result¬ 
ing poor preparation for any life work except that of manual 
labor was often one of the weaknesses contributing to delin¬ 
quency . 

Education and Delinquency .- Olosely related to .he 
economic factor as a cause of crime is the failure of a large 
number of .he men to remain at school Long enough to obtain 
adequate preparation for any type of work requiring training 
or ability. It was often because the home was poor and the 
income needed to be supplemented that the boy loft school to 
accept a job. In some cases there was a definite desire for 
higher education but it was thwarted by the lack of funds. 

Llany of these men had desired to secure training in mechanical 
work, and their ability as tested seemed to indicate that they 
could have achieved a moderate degree of success at some form 
of mechanical work. 

There were many other oases in which the individual had 
left school quite independently of the economic siiuation. Two- 
fifths of the men in the group had c.iiliked school or felt in¬ 
different toward it. Seventy per cent had practised truancy, 
and 39.0)0 had done so quite regularly. One-fourth had left 
school because they did not like it, and well over half had 
gone to work at an early age because they felt at the time that

they preferred a job to a farther period of edaoation. The dis¬ 
like of school was often bas 'd on the fact that the progress in 
school work had been unsatisfactory. ..e liave been led to ihe 
conclusion that in a large number of the instances here con¬ 
sidered the school system to which the boys were subjected was 
not suited to their type of ability and mental make-up. 'i?hey 
found the academic work uncongenial and irksome, and its diffi¬ 
culty for them led to discouragement and the leaving of school. 
Limited mental ability was very obviously the cause of school 
failure in many oases. The whole question of education depends 
upon the general intelligence level and the special capacities of 
individuals considered. These fundamental factors will be dis¬ 
cussed in the ne:^'t section in relation to the delinquency of this 
group. 

Llentality and Delinquency .- It was indicated in Table 
XXIV that 12. ,\-]q of the prisoners studied were below normal in in¬ 
telligence, that one-fourth were of border-line deficiency and 
that nearly one-fifth were definitely feeble-minded. This means 
that the portion of the gaol group testing normal or superior in 
intelligence is 27.9% v/hile for he general population it is con¬ 
sidered to/^80.0%. Our conclusion is that the intelligence level 
of the prisoners is very much below that of the average population. 

This condition of low mentality greatly increases the 
probability of crime among any group of men. Those who are merely 
dull in intelligence usually lack sensitiveness of moral dis-_ 
crimination, and so do not experience moral inhibitions to nearly 
the same extent as those of normal intelligence. Those of border¬ 
line deficiency are often able to care for themselves satisfactor- 








-156- 


Lly as long as they do not encounter difficulties, but under the 
severe economic c nditions of the present time it is not surpris¬ 
ing that a large number of these men of extremely dull intellect 
should be crowded out of employment , and in their idleness become 
guilty of such offences as petty theft. Under the existing dif¬ 
ficulties of economic adjustment few of the men who are on the 
border-line of mental deficiency are capable of living socially 
without some moasure of supervision, fhere is a very Large number 
of definitely feeble-minded among the gaol group in proportion 
to the percentage of the general population which such men con¬ 
stitute. Hen of this level of intelligence are always likely to 
commit anti-social acts when not under supervision, and in none 
of the oases of feeble-minded individuals vjas the prognosis for 
the after-release period at all satisfactozry. 

fhe low range of general intelligence and the large in¬ 
cidence of feeble-mindedness among this group of prisoners leads 
us to seek in this factor a more fundamental cause of some of the 
factors previously considered, fhe failure to make good progress 
in school, and the departure from school without an adequate 
educational basis, were factors indicated -o have played a part 
in the series of causes leading to delinquent conduct. But we 
must now recognize that a group of men including such a large 
number of those of low or defective intelligence could not be ex¬ 
pected to produce a larger xDercentage of school successes than 
were found in our group. 

The large proportion of economic maladjustment may also 
be exxDected to have some basis in the limited mental ability.

The Inte11igenoe level is found to be almost the same 
in the three groups "Steady Worker", "Hover" and "Eon-Worker". 
The group of "Lrifters" shows an average IQ 4.7 points below 
that of the steady workers. The numbers in the group of "Eon- 
Workers" and in the column "Lefinitely Feeble-! inded" are too 
small to be significant. The net result of the larger numbers 
in the "Below Eormal" column is the indication that the group 
of drifters includes a larger percentage of men of low intelli¬ 
gence than does the group of "Hovers" and that both of these 
groups contain more men of the lower intelligence levels than 
does the groux) of steady 7'orkers. The difference between the 
intelligence levels of the drifters and the steady workers is 
signifleantly large, the drifter group containing a proportion 
of those of low intelligence 13.6Jo greater than that included 
in the group of steady workers. 

It seems likely that the difficulty of economic adjust- 



















-lo8- 


ment causes failure first on the part of the group whose intei- 
ligenoe level is so low that eduoational advantages were not 
adequately used and whose ability least qualifies them to m.iin- 
taiu satisfactory jobs. The mental weakness is probably a l-.rge 
factor in the failure to obtain adequate training for any life 
work, ^'^nd habits of short time labor and continual drifting are 
built up. Then the mental weakness, the lack of training, and 
the unsatisfactory habits of labor combine to render the indivi¬ 
dual among those of least value in any form of work, with the 
result that such a norson is among the first to find employn.ent 
unavailable. It is then a combination of the earlier factors 
which is responsible for the individual's predisposing weakness, 
and the economic difficulty of the times and consequent unemploy¬ 
ment are immediate factors breaking down his social adjustment 
at the point of greatest weakness. The unemployment, as pirevious- 
ly indicated, resulted in disorganization of personality, antagon¬ 
ism to society, and habits of idleness. These attitudes and 
habits tended.to weaken the customary moral inhibitions, and when 
the idleness and lack of money presented situations in which there 
was an opportunity to steal, the long succession of contributing 
factors culminated in the delinquent act. 

^n estimate of the relationship existing between mental 
ability and delinquency can be obtained by comparing the intelli¬ 
gence level of the repeated offenders with those of the first, 
second, and third offenders. Such a comparison is afforded by 
Table XLII.

t 

Among this group of I£2 men for whom tirt' Herring IQ was 


known the intelligence level is shown by the table to vary in- ^ 
versely with the frequency of the offence. The average IQ of 
54 prisoners serving terms for the fourth time or more is 7.6 
points less than that for 42 men serving sentences for the first 
time. In the column showing percentage of Borderline Deficiency 
or Definite Feeble-Mindedness the figures are too small for the 
difference between the percentages of second and third offenders 
to be significant. If we therefore group together the percentages 
for second and third offenders -.ve find the percentage of border¬ 
line cases and mental defectives to vary directly with the frequen¬ 
cy of the offences. The percentage of border line and defective 
individuals among the habitual offenders is well over twice as 
great as that among the first offenders. In general the table 

/ 

gives sound support to the conclusion that among this group of 
prisoners those who are repeaters are of lower intelligence, and 
the more frequent the repetition Of offences the lower the intel¬

The reLationahip of intelligence to the generai type of 
offender may be observed in Table luQII. One hundred nd twenty 
men for whom the Herring IQ waa known have been classified accord¬ 
ing to eight m in types of offender. She men classed as Victims 
of Economic Pressure are those who would not lik.ly have committed 
their offences had it not been for their economic d ifficultios. 

The group I belled '*iiGOidental'* are principally first offenders 
whose delinquent act was due largely to unusual circumstances, and 
who are not likely to repeat their offence. Those classed as * 
’’Potential Oriminals" are young men who are not- yet deliberately 
antisocial but whose early environment has resulted in such habits 
of delinquency that they are very likely to continue in antisocial 
behaviour unless some influence comes into their lives with power 
to reconstruct them. The men labelled "'Veak and Drifting” are 
vagrants, drunkards, and petty thieves, who have no criminal in¬ 
tentions but who are so weak that they seem lo be entirely lacking 
in control of their appetites and impulses. The group classed as 
of "Low I-.Ientality" includes only those whose delinquency seemed 
to be directly due to lack of mental ability. The meanings of the 
remaining classifications are clearly indicated in the titles 
given to them. The method by which the intelligence scores were 
obtained and the meaning of the intelligence classifications used 
are discussed in the section on the Ilentality and Personality of 
the Prisoners. (See Pages 43-46.)

The two groups of offenders whose delingaenoy depends 
the most upon externci,! faouors and. the Least upon the nature of 
the individual himself, namely the viotims of eoonomio pressure 
and the accidental offendersare seen to rank highest in the 
intelligence scale. The deliberate criminals have an average 
intelligence very little below that of the two highest groups. 

The deliberate criminals average 11.3 points above those wlio are 
merely \^eak and drifting. 

The’group of x^risoners who are victims of economic 
pressure includes over fifty per cent of men with normal intel¬ 
ligence while of the .otal number of men whose intelligence was 
tested less than thirty per cent possessed normal or superior 
intelligence. It seems that offences due to economic pressure 
have brought to the gaol a larger proportion of normally intel¬ 
ligent men than any other type of offence. 

The three groups "Potential Oriminal", "Victim of Liquor", 
and "V/eak and Drifting" comprise over half of the 120 men here

olassified. These three groups within the population studied 
include the largest number of repeaters and habitual offenders. 
Placing these three classes ogether we have a group of 62 men 
whose average IQ is 69.1, and of whom 78.8/^ are below normal in 
intelligence and 17 definitely feeble-minded. This means that 
a group of the prisoners who return most frequently and who con¬ 
stitute over one-half of our sample population have an average in¬ 
telligence which is of border-line deficiency, and include almost 
four-fifths of men below normal intelligence and over on^-sixth 
definitely feeble-minded. The significant fact is that our prison 
population includes a very large proportion of menvhose mental 
ability is too limited for them to continue to live in satisfac¬ 
tory socir.l adjustment without supervision. 

Six of the iorisoners of our sample group were given psy¬ 
chiatric examination by Tr. Barager and Dr. Llc^llister. Three 
were diagnosed as of xDsychopathic personality and three as mental 
defectives. Pour other men who did not receive complete psychia¬ 
tric examination showed very marked psychopathic tendencies. Thus 
at least seven of the 1B9 men, or 5.4^3, may safely be said to be 
of psychopathic personality. In each of these seven oases the 
mental abnormality appeared to be a factor in the failure to 
maintain satisfactory adjustment to the environment, and there¬ 
fore contributed to the delinquent conduct. 

Habits and Leisure in Relation to Delinquency .- The 
habits of the prisoners have been discussed in a general way in 
Chapter I. It was seen that 4:6.&fo were heavy us^rs of alcohol, 
34.0^ used- it moderately, and only 20.2]^ were total abstainers.

xhe ages at Wf.ich the men began to drink varied from six years 
to more than thirty, with an average age of beginning of 18 years. 
Cne-third of tl.e group liad begun to drink before passing iho age 
of seventeen, 'fobaooo was used by more than ninety per oent of 
the men and two-thirds of those who used tobacco did so heavily, 
fhis habit had been begun at ages varying from six years to twenty- 
three. ^bout one-fourth of them had begun to smoke before reach¬ 
ing the age of fourteen and about three-fourths before reaching 
the age of eighteen. Of those who gave reliable information con¬ 
cerning their sexual life, n.>ariy one-half practised illicit 
heterosexual relations regularly, and a further thirty per oent 
occasionally, leaving less than one fifth who had not pructised 
such relations, fhe practice of illicity sexual relations had 
begun at ages varying from eleven y ars to twenty-seven. i'he 
average age of beginning was about sixteen years. One-fifth of 
the group here considered had begun such illicit practises before 
reaching the age of fifteen and four-fifths before reaching seven¬ 
teen. At least ten per oent were gamblers, four of the nuniber 
depending upon the practice for a large part of their livelihood 
•Two of the 129 men were drug addicts. 

The description which this survey affords of the habits 
of- the prisoners gives an indication of the quality of life to 
which they are accustomed. »Ve find a very large percentage ad¬ 
dicted to bad habits, and a large number who have practised such 
habits since a comparatively early age. This picture of the 
habits of the men is of more value in suggesting the tone of their 
environmental influences than in indicating any factors contribut- 









-L44- 


ing directLy to their delinquency, xh; habits of smoiing and 
of illicit sexual experiences do not show any direct relationship 
with delinquency, although they appoar very .ftoii to accompany 
other practices which have a more direct influence upon antisocial 
conduct, i’he habits of gambling, drug using, .nd drinking, how¬ 
ever, appear to have direct relationships with the delinquency 
of the men of this’group. The gambling habit was found closely 
associated with the lack of desire to engage in constructive work. 
Some of the young men had found it possible to derive 'a larger 
income from gambling tnan from honest work and in the course of 
time had lost their desire to work. The gambling practices had 
also brought them into contact with companions whose influence 
contributed to a mental outlook that was conducive to crime. The 
drug habit seemed to have rendered both of the men who practised 
it quite incapable of assuming a satisfactory place in normal 
occupational life. The craving to obtain supplies of the drug 
no matter what method might be required was quite evidently a 
factor in causing the drug addicts to consider illegal behaviour 
a necessity for them. The most strongly antisocial attitudes 
were found among gamblers and drug addicts. 

The habit which shows the greatest direct relation to the 
delinquency of the prisoners we have studied is that of the use of 
alcohol. The fact shown in Table XLVIII that 79.8 per cent of the 
prisoners in our group are users of alcohol does not necessarily 
indicate a relationship between the alcoholic habit and the de¬ 
linquency of the men. The most that such enumerations indicate 
is that there is a fair probability of the use of alcohol and 








- 145 - 


delinquont behaviour ooourring in the sime individuals. But the 
study of individual oase histories has ennabled us to go farther 
and to enumerate those oases in which the use of alcohol has been 
a direct factor in the individual's delinquent behaviour. A sum¬ 
mary of these findings is given in Table JdCIV

As a farther indication of the extent to which alcohol is 
a factor in contributing to delinquent conduct it may be added that 
of the 1188 offences for which men were sentenced to the gaol dur¬ 
ing the year ending March 31, 1932, 307 or 25.8 per cent were 
breaches of the Liquor Act. 

Associated with the large incidence of undesirable habits 
among the men who have become prisoners is the problem of the use 
of leisure time. Very few of the men had lived in social environ¬ 
ments which provided constructive pastimes for the use of their

Leisure. Very few iiad belonged to clubs or organizations of any 
kind when boys. Few were fond of reading, and few came from homes 
of sufficient cuiturai background to ^^rovide any vf:'riGty of in¬ 
terests beyond that of making a living. This absence of con¬ 
structive Leisure activities and Lack of cuiturai interests had 
tended to leave a Large number of the men in their youth with 
much time not profitabiy empioyed. haturaiiy the young men did 
not remain inactive, but found pastimes to occupy their Leisure 
time, and companionships to furnish them wi.h interests. The 
pastimes and companionships to which they drifted most readiiy 
were those of the street corner, the pool-haii and the gambiing 
rendezvous. Ilany of the young men who were ciassed in a prev¬ 
ious tabie as potentiai criminais found their way into delin¬ 
quent activities as members of street gangs which grew up to 
supply this need for group interests and for Leisure time act¬ 
ivities. The impression given by conversations with the prison¬ 
ers corioerning their earlier Lives was .hat in a very Large 
number of cases habits which Led to deLinquency were acquired 
mereLy because as boys they had not been introduced to any 
variety of v/orthwhiLe interests, to any constructive Leisure 
activities, or to the companionship of any group of young 
people of their own age enjoying healthy social intercourse. 

Bad companionship. - It was found that in the lives of 

52 of the L29 men, or 40.3 per cent, bad associates had been an 

influence to delinquency. There-seems to be Little significance 

of 

in pointing out this fact for almost aLL''our acts are social acts 
and criminal offences not differ from other acts 'in being 
committed in the company of other people. Furthermore, it

is only natural that tiie associates with whom de 1 in .ueno les are 
committed are people of the type accustomed to such offences, 
or likely to commit them themselves, it seems a futile circle 
to Indicate bad comp, ny as a factor in causing delinquency. Yet 
such facts as we have d iscovered .and expressed nuiu ^rically in 
coi.iiection with this group of delinquents are of distinct value 
in emphasizing one central truth: the importance of associations 
in shaping life habits and behaviour patterns. One of the most 
insidious factors discovered to play a large part in the early 
experience of many of our potential criminals Is that the very 
youth whose homes do not provide healthy ahd constructive in¬ 
fluence or richness of interests are the youth whom the com¬ 
munity provides with no more constructive guidance for.leisure 
time than that afforded by motion picture theatres, cheap dance 
halls, pool rooms and the poorer cafes. It is the young people 
lacking in worthwhile interests and activities who gather on 
street corners to lounge away idle hours, or who form gangs to 
invent activities that will provide action and excitement. V.'hen 
guidance 9 f any kind is lacking, it is very natural that to a 
large extent the activities of such groups take an antisocial 
direction. Our conclusion is that in the lives of a large number 
of the men of our group who have become potential criminals at 
an early age the most direct factor contributing to their de¬ 
linquency has been that of undesirable associations formed out 
of a healthy desire for the activities and companionships that 
were not constructively provided in any other way. 

The Press and Pe linqiiency .- during our conversations with 

them several of the prisoners made spontaneous statements concern- 













ing the effect apOi. them of crime reports in the newspaprs. 

lidmont on boy who has a long gaol record, in describing the 
exploits of a small gang to which ho belonged, told of frequent 
thefts of guns by walking into stores during daylight aiid daring¬ 
ly carrying off the desired firearms. "1 wouldn't have the nerve 
to do it now," he said in retrospect, "But we used to get a 
kick out of seeing our names in the . xhat's partly why 

we did it." 

boy of eighteen years who was interviewed had been 
arrested on a charge of vagrancy while travelling by freight 
from his home to another part of -nlberta where he had been ac¬ 
customed to work on farms, ^n Edmonton nev/spaper published a 
very exaggerated account of the event, giving the impression 
that the youth was heavily armed and was intending to hold up 
a bank. She boy learned of the newspaper account and was bitter¬ 
ly indignant tiiat his friends in the community where his standing 
had previously been very good should read in the paxjer what he 
considered an utterly untruthful account of his conduct. Jinother 
young man exx)ressed indignation that a sentence of one month 
which he served for fighting in a moment of anger should have 
been rex^orted in the new^spaper with his name, so that the people 
of his home community came to know of the event, k boy of 
eighteen who was waiting trial in the gaol for a very serious 
charge expected to receive a long penitentiary term. Even under 
those c ircumstances he sx^oke with very marked pride of the sen¬ 
sational write-ups which were being given to him in the news¬ 
papers. Another boy of about the same age who had been arrested 
sev.eral times for theft of automobiles made the following remark 










i ■■

with a real show of pride: "Didn't you read in .he pap r about 

H_G_ taking cars \vi hout the owner's co/.sent? ',V Li, 

that v/as me I" 

It may be argued with some measure of soundness that the 
publishing of accounts of the detection and punishment of crime 
is a deterrent influence, but it is difficult to make any esti¬ 
mate of the effectiveness of this form of publicity as a deter¬ 
rent. however the instances which we have quoted make it clear 
that in the case of some of the younger men there are at least 
three undesirable effects of such newspaper publicity. The 
publication of the name of the offender makes his offence well 
known throughout the community, and thus renders more difficult 
his 'adjustment to society after his release. The indignation 
thus aroused in the minds of some of the men tends to increase 
their antisocial feeling, and even to instill a bitterness which 
lessens the probability of satisfactory social adjustment. In 
other oases, especially among young boys, the newspaper publi- 
city gave a pleasing sensation of importance, and thus provided 
a stimulus for further delinquent acts. 

^Enumeration of Gontributing factors .- As an indication 
of the number and variety of the factors contributing to the 
delinquency of this group of men we list below a number of 
these factors in order of frequency of occurrence , with the 
number of cases in which each factor is considered to have con¬ 
tributed directly to ..he delinquent behaviour. The factors 
listed necessarily overlap a great deal, for in most oases 
several of them occur together in their contribution to the 


individual's antisocial conduct.

Some of the strongest and most frequently occurring 
factors arc not included in this list because of their very 
fundamental nature and the consequent difficulty of estimating 
their direct relationship to criminal conduct. Such factors are 
incompleteness of the home, weakness of home standards, unsatis¬ 
factory family adjustments, deficiency of cultural background, 
economic difficulties, inappropriate educational methods, lack 
of guidance in leisure activities, and conflict of cultures and 
standards in immigrant homes, llany of these general conditions 
are much more fundamental than the direct factors listed in the 
table, but they are rather the predisposing causes resulting in

the weaknesses which permit direct factors to influence be¬ 
haviour towards delinquency. 

Ooncluslons Regard ing; Causes of De L in^ue noy . - Our 
survey of Ihe life histories of this group of prisoners has not 
led us lo attempt any simple or exact diagnosis of the causes 
of the delinquency of the group, or even of any one individual. 

«Ve are forced, rather, to the conclusion that the factors con¬ 
tributing to Lhe delinquency of these men are numerous, complex, 
and intricatoly interwoven, ihere are superficial influences 
which appear to exercise a direct effect upon the behaviour of 
the individuals, but these influences are always dependent upon 
more fundamental conditions in the previous life history, hny 
understanding of crime causes that is to be of practical value 
must take into consideration the immediate stimuli to antisocial 
behaviour and must also push back as far as possible in an 
analysis of the long series of those variously interrelated 
factors of experience which through the whole process of the 
growing life have made the individual what we find him. 

In this study we have been able to follow such a method 
only in a limited measure, and in a way tliat is quite superficial 
in comparison with the depth and thoroughness necessary for the 
completeness of understanding which we desire. But we have been 
able to reach tentative conclusions as to the general elements 
in the background of these men which have been largely responsible 
for their social behaviour. 7/e have found a general level of 
intelligence which is very low, and which has thus limited the 
ability of the individual to find satisfactory adjustment to 
the educational system, the economic world, and the general

sooial Life of the oonimonity. V/e have found a Largo proportion 
of immigrant homes in which the confLiot of standards and thought 
forms has made Life adjustment more difficuLt. In a Large num¬ 
ber of the homes the absence of one or both parents, unhappiness 
of family relationships, Low moral and cultural standards, or 
poverty and economic failure have resulted in a weak and inad¬ 
equate home training, na educational system which attempts to 
force into a common mould children of widely different types 
of ability has failed to provide successfully for the training 
of many of these individuals whose limited ability is more 
readily adaptable to mechanical work than to abstract conceptions. 
The OGCupa-cional life of many of the men has begun at an early 
age, and, due largely to a combination of economic pressure 
and limited mental ability, without any adequate training, so 
that only manual-labor could be secured and that for only very 
short periods. Consequently habits of drifting have been 
acquired in many cases, and such a life has brought associations 
which have led naturally in the direction of deliny^uent conduct. 

In general we find predisposing weakness, due to low mentality, 
inadequate personality, or defective training, turned into a 
de linquent tendency by some external factor such as economic 
need or tne attraction of alcohol. 

Ho single theory is adequate as an explanation of crime. 
Criminal conduct is not a special and isolated phenomenon in our 
society. Antisocial conduct has its roots deep in our-social 
system, fhe men who pass through our courts and our gaols register 
the failure of our social institutions to provide adequately for

the community life of a large class of citizens. ;.o cannot 
understand the reasons for their delinquency unless we see 
their whole lives in relation to the social environment in terms 
of which all their reactions have been made. V/e can never deal 
adequately with .he problem of the antisocial individual until 
we deal at the same time.witk those wider social problems which 
have of-necessity been mentioned in our discussion of the causal 
factors in the lives of our group of prisoners. V/e have seen 
that the life problems of our group of off:nders have been close¬ 
ly interrelated with the specific social problems of home re¬ 
lationships, education, immigration, vocational training, leisure 
activities, economic adjustment, and the use of aIcoholac.bever¬ 
ages. ihe increasing complexity of modern life is increasing 
the demands of society upon .he individual. Economic develop¬ 
ments are making ever heavier demands of ability and training 
upon all who would maintain a satisfactory position in the 
world of material affairs. Tevelopments in education and in 
organized social activities have not kept pace with the rapid 
economic and industrial changes. Ihe result is that an increas¬ 
ing number of those of limited native ability and inadequate 
home background are failing to receive such training as will 
enable them to measure up to the more severe standards of the 
economic order. i'his general inadequacy is basic to the delin¬ 
quency of a large proportion of our gaol inmates, k more co:/.- 
plete understanding of criminal conduct requires deeper research 
into the personalities of the Individual offenders, and more 
thorough analysis of the social institutions which are breaking 
down tlie adjustments of so many individuals at their points of

CHAPTER IV 

THE PRESENT LIETHOP OF TREATl.IEHT 
The Underlying Theories 

Many large volames have been devoted to discussions 
of theories of penology, but such discussions are Largely irrel- 
'evant to the problems of actual everyday practice. However, 
there must be in the minds of both administrators and general 
public a general attitude toward those who are offenders against 
th§ law, and the intellectual formulation of that attitude con¬ 
stitutes a working theory. There is much evidence that the 
actual working theory in the minds of citizens and administrators 
of iilberta is that which m^y be called the Retributive Theory: 
the offender has violated the law of society ahd society must 
mete out punishment in return. ',7e express anger when a criminal 
act is committed and satisfaction when the judge pronounces the 
sentence which administers to the culprit his due punishment. 

\7e insist, too, that the treatment of those who have offended 
against the law shall be of a severity sufficient to justify 
its being called punishment. V/e resent an offence against the 
law as if it were against our own persons , ^nd evidencing a 
survival of primitive passions we demand "an eye for an eye and 
a tooth for a tooth". Although we have long since discarded the 
idea of revenge as a principle of personal reaction in civilized 
society, we retain it in our thinking as.the basis of our in¬ 
stitutions for the administration of "justice". 

There is a second motive which plays a part in our 
attitude toward offenders: that of deterrence. Society must be 













- 166 - 


proteoted from .arther antLaoolel aots , and as an example to 
others who might be Likely to offend, we must administer suit¬ 
able punishment to current offenders. That Is, we punish our 
present offenders for the crimes which contemporaries or future 
generations might otherwise commit. This Is the theory which 
we advance In defence of our punishment of criminals when we 
are ashamed to admit the more obvious motive of revenge. The 
deterrence motive seems a questionable basis for the adminis¬ 
tration of "justice". It can be soundly defended only If It 
really does deter, and If Its Inhumanity Is really needed for 
the protect Ion. of society as a whole. are not aware that It 
has ever been convincingly demonstrated tiiat either of these con¬ 
ditions are fulfilled by methods of punishment based on the de¬ 
terrence theory. 

A third theory which Is often discussed in relation to 

* 

punishment is that of reformation. There is little evidence, 
however, that this concept plays a significant part in the think¬ 
ing of the ilberta public concerning the offenders who are dealt^. 
with by our judicial and penal Institutions, ilberta has no 
reformative Institution for juvenile offenders and In the penal 
institutions provided for adults there is no evidence of any 
serious attempt to reform the Inmates. Ue are forced to the 
conclusion that our judicial and penal policies are dictated 
largely by the motive of revenge, associated with the theory 
that punishment of offenders is necessary for the protection of 
society.

' . The ilotual Treatment 

Let as give some attention the the aotaal treatment 
which oar hiberta institations do provide for those who offend 
against oar laws. We shall consider the treatment first in the 
ooarts, secondly, in the gaol, and thirdly, after release from 
gaol. The following disoass ion is based on oar observation of 
the sentencing of prisoners in the magistrate's coart and the 
treatment of inmates in the Ft. iiasicatohewan irrovincial Gaol. 

In the Coarts. - It has not been within the scope of 
this stady to give any great attention to the methods and pro- 
oedares of the ooarts, bat we have made oarselves fairly famil¬ 
iar with the manner in which those men are treated who come be¬ 
fore oar Jity Police Goart and are sentenced to the Provincial 
Gaol. It is in this court that the majority of the prisoners 
who go to Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol receive their sentences. 

It is the policy of the court to determine whether or 
not the accused person is guilty of the alleged offence, and, if 
the verdict is "guilty", to administer such punishment as is pre¬ 
scribed by the law, varying the severity of the sentence accord¬ 
ing to the known circumstances, v/ithin the limits allowed by the 
law. The motive of the court is quite obviously to administer 
the law, and not to understand or treat the aocusec individual. 
Individual magistrates undoubtedly exert their efforts to under¬ 
stand the circumstances of the case, and to administer such 
punishment, within the prescribed limits, as sefvms most just to 
all concerned. But there is no systematic attempt by our courts 
to go behind the circumstances•of the immediate situation to 
dLscovef “the background and motivating forces in the life of the

Individual being tried. The general oourt polloy places Its 
emphasis on the offence and not on the human Individual who Is 
charged with having committed It. The "justice" of the court 
extends only to the administering of whatever punishment within 
the legal limits seems most In keeping with the circumstances 
under which the offending act was committed. As at present 
constituted our courts do not seek to administer that type of 
justice which Involves an understanding of the causative factors 
In the life of the offender and an attempt to prescribe the treat¬ 
ment most likely to restore him to a satisfactory place In society. 

Ilany men are sentenced to terms of Imprisonment without 
spending more than a very few minutes In the presence of the 
magistrate. The magistrate becomes Informed of the nature of 
the offence, receives a plea of "guilty" from the prisoner, and 
Immediately Imposes the sentence prescribed by the law. In 
courts constituted as ours are at present It Is Inevitable that 
tne sentence Is Imposed without a diagnosis of the real cause 
of the act, and without a knowledge of the effect which the 
sentence Is likely to have upon the future of the Individual 
concerned or upon his reaction to society. 

Treatment In the Oaol .- The Internal life of the gaol 
Is' efficiently administered, and the routine flows along with 
smooth regularity. The prisoners who are in good health are 
employed regularly in some branch of work associated with the 
Institution or on the gaol farm. For most of the men the work¬ 
ing day is eight hours long, but those who care for livestock 
and do other chores work longer. The kinds of work requiring a

nuinber of men are done asually by gangs of twelve prisoners under 
the supervision of an armed guard. Most of the work is of a very 
healthful nature, a large proportion being done in the open air. 
There are, however, a number of prisoners regularly employed 
within the gaol building as sweepers and scrubbers. In a general 
way the men are a signed to work which is appropriate to their 
type of ability, but the possible limits of choice of work are 
not wide. In addition to the men who work in gangs under armed 
guards and to those who work within the gaol building are a num¬ 
ber of prisoners known as "trusties’* who are allowed to do various 
jobs around the farm without supervision. Very rarely does one 
of the men placed on his own responsibility attempt to escape 
from the gaol. 

iill of the able-bodied men serving sentences eat their 
meals together in a dining hall. Strict silence is enforced 
among the prisoners while they are in the dining hall or marching 
to and from it. The food served is for the most part, wholesome, 
and fairly well prepared. But the prisoners do the baking, and 
it is not always done most efficiently. The majority of the men 
complain bitterly about the quality of the food, and insist that 
it would cost no more to prepare it in a more acceptable way. 
However, it is quite to be expected that where a number of men 
are gathered together under a regime of force, and where they 
have very little of constructive interest to occupy their minds, 
a considerable portion of their attention will be directed to 
cr'iticism and complaint concerning the conditions under which 
t,hey are living. It is true that the food is monotonous, but 
changes recently made by ’.Varden McLean have made it less so than

former ly. xhere are few Luxuries: no sugar in tea, no butter 
on bread, and dessert only oaoe x^er week, i^ny statement con- 
oerning the quality of the food depends upon the viewpoint as 
to the function of a gaol. If it is considered a place for 
punishment by ill treatment, nunotony of food is one effective 
method, and a method that is actually in us.e in our gaol. But 
in general the food is much better than would be assigned in 
accordance with a deliberate policy of punishment by such de¬ 
privation . 

Ihe living quarters provided for the prisoners ai’e of 
two distinct kinds: cells and dormitories, Each of the tv/o cell 
blocks contains two rows of cells three tiers deep. The cells 
have solid walls, and heavy steel doors each with a small glass 
window facing the large central corridor. Each cell has a window 
in.the outer wall admitting light, but glazed so that the prisoner 
cannot see outside. The windows do not open, so no fresh air 
enters directly from the outside. Vent illation is provided by 
flues in the walls through which the air is forced by a large 
electrically-driven fan. One prisoner occupies each cell, and 
when the door is closed he has no opportunity to converse with 
any other prisoner. 

Those prisoners who are engaged in ordinary forms of 
work are confined to their cells for about fifteen hours out of 
every twenty-four, except on Sundays and holidays when they are 
out of their cells for less than three hours. This means that 
a large number of the prisoners spend two-thirds of their time 
in actual solitary confinement. 

Approximately two hundred prisoners are housed in the 







- 161 - 


oelLs. ihe remainder ocoupy dormitories in -ach of wliioh there 
are twelve beds, one or two tables, and some bei.ohes. The 
twelve men in •. aoh dormitory have almost complete freedom of 
conversation among themselves. ?hey are also allowed such pas¬ 
times as checkers and cards. 

The reason for the two conditions of housing and the two 
methods of treatment seems to be the lack of sufficient cell ac¬ 
comodation for the number of prisoners usually in the gaol. At 
the present time, however, the dormitory method of treatment is 
used as something of a promotion and reward system. Those 
prisoners who show themselves oapabJ.e and dependable in such 
tasks as caring for the cattle, horses, and pigs, operating farm 
machinery, or firing the boilers, are given quarters in the dor¬ 
mitories. If a man breaks a rule of discipline or shows that 
he cannot be depended ux^on to perform his task adequately he is 
given a job of lower rank and often is at the same time trans¬ 
ferred from dormitory to cell. There is no systematic method 
O'f awarding marks of merit or demerit, but the prisoners are so 
well aware of the advantages of life in the dormitory over ^hat 
in the ceils that in many oases the realization of the possibility 
of transfer from cell to dormitory is a real incentive to con¬ 
scientious work and good -behaviour. 

There is freedom to talk in the dormitory, which in the 
minds of the prisoners, is a tremendous advantage over the solitary 
confinement of the cells. The recreations of checkers and cards 
are a very welcome addition to the single pastime which the cells 
afford, that of reading. The men in the cells must be in bed by 
six thirty in the evening, while those in the dormitories need not 






retire until nine o’olook. The lights in the dormitories are 
extinguished at nine o'oiook in the ov.:ntng; in the oells the 
Lights remain on u,Li night. Both early retirement and t)ie bright 
lighting throughout the night give tlie oe ll inmates additional 
subjects for complaint. The strongest reason for the preference 
of the dormitories is the companionship tliat is afforded there. 
The prisoners thoroughly dread and nate the lonely hours of con¬ 
finement in the oells. 

There is no program of occupational.training for the 
;risoners. V/hatever vocational training is received is obtained 
incidentally as the men carry on the work necessary for the sup¬ 
port of the institution. • Two men at a time are assigned to the 
shoe repair shop, two to the barber shop, one to the blacksmith 
shop, six to firing the boilers in the power plant, several to 
the laundry, two to the offices, and others to such tasks as cook 
ing, baking, milking cows, driving horses and operating machinery 
When new buildings are being constructed, a number of the men 
work as carpenters, plasterers, and painters. I.aturally the men 
who work at each of these tasks know more about that particular 
kind of work when they leave the gaol than when they entered. 

But the men assigned to each task are those able to do the work 
most efficiently, rather than those for whom the experience would 
be most valuable. The barbering, for example, is done in so far 
as possible, by men who had previously been good barbers, rather 
than by men to whom it would be an advantage to learn the trade 
of barbering. Uoreover, a large number of the men are not given 
an opportunity to do work of any greater educational value than 
scrubbing floors, hoeing garden^, mowing lawns, or pulling weeds. 












-163- 


]?he institution as it exists at present simply does not 
provide facilities for oooupationai training of any real value 
for more thra a very small number of men. The trades that are 
necessary to the life of the institution exist on such a small 
scale that they do not permit of adaption to purposes of training. 
Furthermore the terms served by the men are in general so short 
that in very feiw oases could training be of sufficient length to 
be valuable. The average term served in the gaol is less than 
three months and about half are less than two months. Less than 
five per cent of the sentences are for one year or raore^. Under 
a judicial system imposing such.a preponderance of short sentences 
no effective program of any kind of training is feasible. 

Education of academic nature had not been attempted until, 
in the closing months of 1932, V/arden McLean' inst ituted a class 
for those who would profit by teaching in the rudiments of read¬ 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. Under charge of a high school 
teacher of the town, the class meets two evenings per week, and 
the men are furnished with materials that enable them to spend 
part of the time in the cells practising their reading and writ¬ 
ing. The prisoners who have been given this opportunity to use 
some of their enforced Leisure time in overcoming to some ex¬ 
tent their previous lack of education are very grateful for it, 
and by means of eager and conscientious industry are making good 
progress. This prison school has begun on a small scale, but if 
its present success continues, the V^arden hopes to extend it as 
facilities permit. 


Table LYiI, page 96, gives distribution of sentences.

In general the routine of the gaol life La drearily mono¬ 
tonous. Rising by a bell in the morning, the prisoners continue 
throughout the day in accordance with a schedule that changes only 
on Sundays and holidays. 'iJhe additional leisure of Sundays and 
holidays is usually unwelcome to the prisoners, for they prefer 
the outdoor work to the monotony of confinement. The enforced 
silence,in the dining room and among the prisoners generally^ in¬ 
creases the monotony and repressiveness of the atmosphere. It 
is only by fear that men can be prevented from talking, and when 
they cannot talk openly they take every opportunity to do so 
clandestinely. Thus to the monotony of the atmosphere is added 
repressiveness and stealth. 

Pisoipline is rigidly enforced. A small number of guards 
handle the large group of prisoners by the use of strict militar¬ 
istic methods. There is very little insubordination. The chief 
offences against discipline are talking at the wrong times or 
places, and addressing officers improperly. The most common pun¬ 
ishments for disciplinary offences are the cancellation of part 
or all of the prisoners remission,^ confinement to cell with a 
diet of bread and water, confinement to the dark cell for a max-, 
imum period of three days and three nights with tv/o rations of 
bread and water each day. 

The atmosphere in which the prisoners in the cell blocks 
live is monotonous, strict, and repressive. There is somewhat 
more freedom permitted to the men in the dormitories. There is 


The system at present used in Provincial Gaols provides that 
a certain number of days be struck off each sentence unless the 

behaviour of the prisoner during ia§@,i‘deration is unsatisfactory.

no evidence of any cruelty wliatever of a physical nature, and in 
spite of the necessity for very rigid discipline when dealing 
with the men in large groups, the personal relationships between 
officers and prisoners are often quite kindly and friendly. 

There is much moral and montal suffering on the part of the more 
sensitive prisoners, due to the monotony and repression, to the 
brooding resulting from the lack of healthful interests, and to 
the unsatisfied need for companionship and personal interest. 

The conversations of the men in the dorj??itories, and the 
playing of checkers and cards, are the only recreations of social 
activities permitted to the prisoners. Those in the cells are 
allowed no social activities of any kind, and no recreations ex¬ 
cept reading. The one possible exception to this generalization 
is the regular Sunday afternoon meeting of the oalvation hrmy, 
and since talking among the men is strictly forbidden at this 
service it can hardly be considered a normal social activity. 
However, the music and singing led by the Salvation Army visitors 
provide an interest for most of the men which makes the meeting a 
pleasant break in the monotony of the week^s routine. Very much 
appreciated by the prisoners are the occasional visits of a Sal¬ 
vation iirmy band on holidays. Sesides enjoying the music and 
singing, some of the men take a real interest in the messages 
given by the speakers. For the most part, however, the meetings 
hold no great religious significance for them. The language 
used by the speakers is largely that of orthodox evangelical 
Protestantism, and long familiarity with it has apparently ren¬ 
dered most of the men ’iirmune^' to its'appeal. It is exceedingly 
difficult to estimate the impact of religious messages in the 



a

lives of individuals, but it seems .0 be olear that personal 
Gontaot with someon j who comes to know them individually would 
affect the men of this group much more vitally than does the 
familiar evangelical appeal in a mass meeting. V/ith the exception 
of the weekly Salvation ^rmy services, and the recent innovation 
of the elementary school class, the gaol program makes no direct 
effort to reconstruct the men, or to send them forth better cit¬ 
izens than when they entered. 

After He lease .- An account of the treatment given to 
prisoners after their release from our gaol need occupy little 
space. Officially, there is none. The prisoners whose terras 
are ended are in most oases taken by a guard to the roadway and 
placed on the uus which delivers them to the Edmonton bus depot. 
They dismount from the bus as free men, but without having a cent 
of financial assistance, without guidance or help of any kind, 
without even encouragement. ho one meets them or assists them 
to find employment. Some approach the Salvation Army in response 
to the invitation previously given by Salvation Army officers 
while visiting at the gaol, and a number of the recidivists re¬ 
ported having received much-needed friendship and assistance in 
this way. But there is an utter absence of any organized effort 
to assist the men who are released from Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol, 
or to give them any indication that society is ready to accept 
them aga in as members. 

The Effect of Present Gaol Treatment on Offenders. 

Whatever may be our theory as to the task of our penal 
institutions, it is essential that we know vhiat effect they are 










-167- 


aotuaLIy having upon the men who serve terms there. Careful 
attention to the effect of the gaol term upon ’aoh of our 129 
prisoners revealed some significant facts. The first general 
principle impressed upon us was that the gaol regime affects no 
two individuals in the same way. There are as many different re¬ 
actions as there are prisoners. A/id the same individual exper¬ 
iences various reactions that are not necessarily consistent. 
Sometimes apparently inconsistent reactions occur simultaneously 
and often varying attitudes occur successively as the term of 
imprisonment advances. Out of the complexity of varying attitudes 
and reactions to the gaol life a number of dominant effects were 
recognized and are here set forth. 

The most general reaction found w.s that of depressed 
spirits, discouragement, worry, and mental deterioration. Forty- 
eight per cent of the men interviewed were found to be depressed 
and only twenty-six per cent reasonably cheerful. (Table , 

Page 5l) A large number of first offenders were definitely v;or- 
ried by the experience, oome found it difficult to sleep. Llany 
found that during the long hours alone in their cells they could 
not keep their minds away from Lheir homes, or their disgrace, 
or the blackness of the future prospects. For persons of any 
sensitiveness of disposition it is inevitable that a routine of 
life which provides so little of healthy interest or food for 
thought, but plenty of time in enforced solitary idleness^should 
promote mental worry. A number of the men expressed their con¬ 
sciousness of mental deterioration while in the gaol. A young 
man nearing the end of a two year term said: "-a fellow’s memory 
gets poorer here. I don’t remember near as well as when I came

in* It»s the same with your brains and everything - you 
don’t use them. You don’t thinic aoout anything except going 
to be and getting up. The routine is all the same. It 
would be diii’erent ii* there was school to go to or anything.” 
The worry is greatest on the part or those who have respons¬ 
ibilities of family or work which they feel are being 
seriously neglected during their absence. Even in the oases 
of men without definite responsibilities elsewhere, the sheer 
mental emptiness of the gaol routine leaves nothing construct¬ 
ive to think about during the hours of solitary confinement, 
with the result that brooding causes worry, irritation, and 
nervousness. 

A very definite effect of the gaol life upon the 
prisoners, especially upon the younger men, is an increased 
familiarity with criminal methods of living and criminal 
thoughts and attitudes. The power of companionship is very 
strong in shaping thoughts and attitudes at any time in 
normal life. It is especially strong under gaol conditions, 
which form a novel adventure for the youthful first offender, 
and throw closely together a number of men who have little 
common interest except their criminal past. The shared 
reeling of martyrdom among a group serving sentences together 
increases the mutual receptiveness

to ant 1300iaL feelings, thoughts, and plans. Tho general con¬ 
census of the statements v/as to the effect that oonversat Ion among 
prisoners deals very largely with criminal subjects. "Prisoners 
are ort of vain", said one young man. "They like to tell about 
what they have done and everything. That is about all they talk 
about here _ A married man of thirty years said: "A man is a 
dozen times more crooked when he gets out of here. I had learned 
more crooked ways when I had been here a week than I ever did 
before. You hear guys tell how they did this and that crooked 
stunt." A boy of eighteen said: "This is the worst place in the 
world for a young boy. All the men talk about is wild women and 
such stuff." Ilany others made similar statements and expanded 
them to indicate that the chief topics of conversation among the 

W67"€ 

prisoners^past or future crimes and sexual immorality. 

The one point upon which practically every older man ex¬ 
pressed an indentical opinion was this one of the harmful effect 
upon youthful offenders of the associations of the gaol life. 

Llan after man made emphatic statements to the effect that what¬ 
ever else might be allowed to remain in our penal procedure, 
this glaringly pernicious evil ought to be at once removed. A 
period of acquaintance with the type of men with whom the boys 
associate while in the gaol, and with the atmosphere in which 
those associations are made, is sufficient to convince one of 
the incontestable soundness of these assertions. 

Another effect produced upon a number of the men was to 
make them less fearful of gaol, ii great many said that they 
were not nearly so much worried about being in gaol after a few 
months of the term had passed by. And many of the recidivists

explalnGd (luite caaually that t}iey had beoouiG accaatomed to the 
gaol life and no longer found it disagreeable. ^ man ..lio had 
served over thirty terms in various gaols made these observations 
"When a fellow gets'making* (i.e. getting into) these gaols he 
doesilt care what the class outside thinks, uq gets going with 
the men who "make* gaols and they're his friends, i^e forgets 
about the others, ik fellow’s got th, t record nov;. -^c can't 

blot it out. It's just like a disease - it's got him." In only 
a few of the oases which we studied did a succession of gaol 
terms fail to make the offender less sensitive to the disgrace 
of the experience and to the repressiveness of the institution. 
Whatever power as a deterrent our gaol system may have for those 
wiio have never been imprisoned, there was abundant evidence in 
the lives of our group of men that for those v;ho actually ex¬ 
perience gaol life the thought of gaol loses much of its deter¬ 
rent value. 

large number of the men had become embittered by their 
term in the gaol. Twenty-six of the men, or on^^-fifth of those 
studied, gave very definite evidence of a more antagonistic at¬ 
titude toward society in general on' account of their prison term. 
The hours of lonely thought aa well as the conversations with 
fellow "martyrs" has the very definite effect upon many personal¬ 
ities of an increased feeling of bitterness and antagonism to¬ 
ward the whole society which they blame for their misfortune. 

In some of the lives which we considered it was found 
that associations made during imprisonment had tended to increase 
later delinquency. V/hen young men have spent a period of time 

in a reform school or a gaol they are usually -eager to find 








- 171 - 


rriends alter their release. It is quite natural that among 
those most likely to become their mends are other ex-inmates 
with whom they have shared experiences ol detention. Several 
oi* the young men had been arrested on further charges in 
company with men whom they had met in gaol or reformatory, 
ether boys described plans they were making during tneir 
current term of imprisonment to accompany older men, whom 
they had met during the term, upon some venture of business, 
sometimes legal, sometimes frankly illegal. 

There were a number of men among the group whose 
thinking had been affected favorably by the gaol experience. 
Some of the first offenders had received it as a warning. 

Some of the repeaters reacted to their last sentence in such 
a way as to confirm their good intentions to remain out of gaol 
in the future. Many made vague resolves that a similar 
experience would never come to them again, and a very few 
made definite changes in their future plans on account of 
the gaol sentence. 

The various changes which seemed to have been effected 
in the individual lives of the prisoners by the sentences 
being served at the time of the interviews are summarized in 
the following tabler

As has been indicated previously no single attitude 
characterizes each individual consistently, but a complexity of 
attitudes and reactions are evident in each individual at any 
one time, and change decidedly with the passage of time. Hence, 
this table can only summarize those attitudes which seemed to 
be dominant in the individual’s thinking at the time of the 
interview. 

According to the figures of Table LXVI more than half 
of the men'experienced reactions to the gaol term which were 
decidedly unfavorable or altogeth.r negative. Only forty-five 
per cent showed reactions which might be considered in any sense 
favorable, ft must be indicated that as far as any value for 
future conduct is concerned many of the r actions listed under 
"Lesson Learned" are practically negative. The reaction thus 
described often cons istec of nothing more than a strong desire 
to keep out of gaols in t:ie future. How it is quite obvious 
that a mere desire to keep out of gaol does not of itself change 
a man’s way of living so that he really avoids antisocial con- 
















-L73 


daot. aks long as the same v/oaknesjos of x rsonality reravln, 
as Long as defloienoy of mentality and tralnli^g is not compen¬ 
sated for by adequate supervision, the probabilities are very 
great that there will be a recurrence of the beliaviour w’-ich led 
to the oreaeat gaol term. Llany of the life stories furnished 
strong evidence for this fact. Ilany recidivists reiated the 
experience of having determined during each previous gaol term 
that it would be their last, but in sprite of that resolve they 
seemed unable to prevent the recurrence of their trouble. V/hat 
is thus true of many of the men whose r-sactions were classed 
under "Lesson Learned" is true of practically 411 who were listed 
under "Vague Resolves". The simple fact is that the innate 
qualities and environmental influences of most of these men are 
such that a prison regime which does not strengthen personal char¬ 
acter or remould life habits has accomplished nothing for the 
individuals detained there. The life of the prison which we 
have described is quite different from the kind of life which 
the men must lead when they become free men again. The abnormal¬ 
ity of the "training" received in the institution is so great 
that the longer the prisoner remains there the less capable is 
he on release of occupying a satisfactory place in normal life. 
There are a few of the prisoners, mostly men of the higher in¬ 
to lligence levels, who seemed to have actually learned through 
their gaol experience that they must find other channels of 
conduct if their lives are to be satisfactory. But the great 
majority go forth with very little of constructive value having 
been accomplished in their lives, and with attitudes and habits 
changed in a direction which makes antisocial conduct a much 





-174- 


greater probability Jor them ia tho future than it has been in 
the past. 

Our study gives us no ba is for an opinion as to the 
value of our gaol system to deter th se ;;ho have not yet come 
into conflict with the law. But it leads us to conclude very 
definitely that although our Provincial Gaol provides very safe 
custody _or offenders, and prevents them temporarily from 
troubling society, it does very little to make better citizens 
of the men who become prisoners , and in a large number of oases 
sets its inmates free less qualified to maintain a satisfactory 
place in the social and industria'l order than they were at the 
time of arrest.

OHAPTFa V 

PROPOSED OHiii.GEO Ij rREiilU i.T OF CFFE..DI:H0 
Motive and Theory 

Sit the beginning of Chapter IV V7e made the observation 

that the mental attitude underlying the tr atment of orirninals 

with 

in Alberta is that of retribution coupled a belief that the 
punishments administered have a general deterrent value. Our 
brief survey of court methods and gaol treatment indicates very 
clearly that the desire to reform the criminal is not. an actual 
motive in the administration of justice in Alberta. As long as 
the court places its emphasis on. the offence committed and makes 
no effort to understand the background or causative factors in 
the life of the offender, or to consider the likely effect of 
the sentence upon the future welfare of the individual or upon 
his adjustment to society, the court treatment cannot honestly 
be said to have a basis in any real desire to reform the criminal. 
As long as the gaol regime provides no more deliberate attempt 
to reconstruct the individual than does the monotonous routine 
and mental emptiness of the gaol life which we have described, 
and as Long as prisoners are released from the institution with¬ 
out even an attempt being made to assist them to find a place in 
society, any court which did seek to reform the individuals 
tried before it would have to administer oome treatment other 
than sentence to such a gaol. The claim that our treatment of 
offenders is reformative must fail to stand before the facts 
revealed by any sincere examination of the procedure of our 
courts and the treatment provided in our gaols. 








-L76- 


There is bat one test to whioh an Intelligent modern 
society can submit its program for deaiing with antisocial in¬ 
dividuals: tho dual test of the future welfare of the individual 
and of society. The welfare of the individual and the welfare 
of society are to a large e..tent two different ti.ings , but they 
are so closely interrelated and interdependent that they cannot 
well be considered separately. Any policy .vnich operates con¬ 
sistently to the detriment of that large group of citizens who 
offend against our laws is operating at the same time to the 
detriment of society as a whole, And, on the other hand, any 
program which is conducive to the good of society as a whole is 
oonductve in the long run to the good of those individuals v.ho 
have become delinquent. Any theory or motive underlying our 
treatment of offenders must be subjected to the test of its ten¬ 
dency to contribute toward or to undermine the future welfare of 
the offenders and of society generally, it is one of the many 
indications of our failure to direct sound thinking toward our 
jpractical p»robterns that we continue for so Long to treat offenders 
by a traditional method without any systematic attempt to eval¬ 
uate the actual results which that method is producing. 

Obviously the retributive motive in the administration 
of punishment fails to satisfy the pragmatic test. V/e cannot 
Justify pragmatically our continued practice of satisfying our 
iorimitive emotions of revenve by the infliction of punishment 
upon the offending individual unless it can be shown that in 
that act of revenge we are benefitting the offender or someone 
else. But if our motive is really the benefit of the offender 
or the prevention of further delinquency on the part of the in- 




‘Lc 


•j 


'■t 




- 177 - 


dlvidaal oonoerned or of others, then our motive is reformative 
or deterrent, and not retributive. Modern society is rapidly 
accepting the pragmatic test as applicable to all her Institu¬ 
tions and is retaining only that part of the heritage from the 
past vi’hich can be justified on the basis of ..hat it actually 
contributes to human welfare today. The time has certainly come 
to apply such a test to the administration of our laws, and the 
most elementary attempt to do so involves the rejection of the 
theory of retributive justice as a basis for the treatment of 
offenders. 

Having rejected the retributive motive as of no practi¬ 
cal value, and having found that current judicial and penal 
methods in Alberta involve no serious reformative efforts, the 
only basis remaining to support our present administration of 
punishment to offenders is that of deterrence. It is^impossible 
to estimate the extent to which our penal system actually deters, 
but it seems fairly clear that the fear of punishment with its 
attendant disgrace is a factor in the prevention of antisocial 
conduct. But deterrence by punishment depends essentially upon 
fear, and fear is a negative method, psychically unhealthy. \Je 
may well hope that by the gradual extension of constructive 
methods of forming character the need for the coercive force of 
fear may be ultimately eliminated. Ileanwhile, however, our 
general educational measures fall so far short of developing 
sound life attitudes by constructive methods that the demoral¬ 
izing motive of fear must for some time yet be resorted to in 
order to prevent an even greater amount of antisocial behaviour 
than now occurs. But punishment administered as such is not the 





- 178 - 


only form of tr.^atment which Involves a deterrent influenoe. In 

the Latter part of this chapter we shall Indicate the general 

principles of methods, which are already cdming InvO use in some 

parts of the world, and which can be depended upon to retain an 

adequate measure of deterrent power while at the same time giving 

to the individual that treatment which his particular case requires, 

and that guidance which will contribute to his successful readjust- 

\ 

ment to society. 

The aim of a constructive program for dealing with of¬ 
fenders will be the- reconstruction of the individual to achieve 
the greatest fullness of life for himself, and the most complete 
adjustment with society, retaining such measure of deterrent in¬ 
fluenoe as will be most nearly adequate to the protection of 
society and least harmful to .he individual offender. In a pro¬ 
gram based on such an aim punishment will have no place for its 
own sake,but will be retained only in so far as it contributes 
to the reformation of the individual or is necessary to the pro¬ 
tection of society. Our study of the individual oases of of¬ 
fenders has convinced us that punishment is inconsistent with 
reformation, and that if we approach the problem of the anti¬ 
social offender with the attitude that demands punishment we are 

ci 

precluded from^-true comprehension of the factors involved^and from 

are 

an understanding of the motives of behaviour.These ^ essential 
to successful treatment. The substitution of the medical approach 
of treatment for the legal approach of punishment does not mean the 
elimination of that element of deterrence which is necessary for 
the protection of society. The methods which are being devised 
for the treatment of offenders where the punishment attitude has 




i -;'I J ; ij'va?..'J -ri; 








- 179 - 




been displaced are of saoh a nature that those who oorae under 
their influence are directed toward more constructive attitudes 
and more wholesome habits, rather than toward ^roat^tr antisocial 
behaviour as under our hlberta gaol system, yet juoh methods 
always retain Lhat element of supervision wiiioh rnak-s them un¬ 
attractive to offending individuals. In so far as deprivation 
of liberty and substitution of social control may be considered 
punishment, punishment will be retained in the administrati n 
of the methods of treatment that will grow from a scientific and 
understanding attitude. But since it will be retained for the 
purpose of assisting the individual raiher than of inflicting upon 
him revenge for his wrong-doing, and since it is the attitude be¬ 
hind the treatment to which the offender is sensitive, such super¬ 
vision and dexDrivation of liberties v;ill not be aocomx)anted by 
the harmful effects which have been shown in a previous ohaptef 
to characterize the reaction of prisoners to present methods of 
punishment by incarceration. 

Increased efficiency in dealing with problems of crime 
and delinquency depends upon the acceptance of a more constructive 
attitude. Such an attitude would involve the replacement of the 
present emphasis on the administration of the law concerning the 
particular offence by an emphasis on a knowledge of the individual 
offender, including his background and his personality; it would 
involve displacing the legal concept of punishment by the medical 
concept of treatment; and it would mean in general a desire to 
understand ihe offender rather than to seek blind revenge by the 
infliction upon him of punishment regardless of its effect. Such 
an approach would be at once more scientific, more humane, and 

_ 








- 180 - 


more soolaLIy efficient. 

Changes heeded in Coart hrooedure 
It has been observed in Chapter IV thnt oar present ooart 
methods emphasize the offence ra.her th^^n the offender, make no 
attempt to understand the background or the fundamental causes 
of delinquency in the individuals being tried, and give little 
consideration to the effects likely to result to the offender 
from the sentence imposed. Cur courts do not include facilities 
for che examination and understand^g of the x^risoners who are 
tried there. Magistrates are bound to impose sentences of a 
length prescribed by the criminal code, without regard to the 
needs of the individuals concerned. Legal institutions in Al¬ 
berta make no provision ordinarily for the acquisition of such 
information about the individual’s past environment and his per¬ 
sonality as is absolutely essential to the administration of ad¬ 
equate treatment. Whatever may be the efficiency of our courts 
as ageneies for determining guilt, they are entirely unqualified 
to prescribe treatment on a basis of understanding sufficient to 
ensure any measure of true success. 

Our first suggestion, therefore, is that in our courts 
the function of determining guilt be separated from the function 
of imposing sentence. The guilt-determining function may very 
well continue to be administered as it is at the present time, 
but the task of prescribing treatment ought to be tran ferred to 
a body equipped to understand the offender and the possibilities 
of treatment. Such a body might be a board composed of bo h men 
and women and including persons trained in psychology, psychiatry, 









-isl¬ 


and social work, us wo 11 ns onpablc layinon. i^ssooiated with such 
a board there should be traiiiod social workers to study the home 
and environment of the off nder. Tlnirough study would be jiven 
also to the personality and mentality of the offender so that the 
board would have as a basts for its consideration a relatively 
complete knowledge of the individual himself as well as of his 
backgrouiid. fhis board should have control of the various agencies 
to which it would have the choice of assigning the offender for 
treatment, in order that the information originally gathered con¬ 
cerning the individual and his environment might be of value in 
determining the treatment throughout. One of the facilities at 
the disposal of the proposed board ougnt to be an institution X'^o- 
viding for temporary detention of those individuals requiring 
further study before the final decision as to trv^atment. ouch 
a place of detention would be protected as far as possible from 
the stigma of a x^^i-son, but it would inevitably involve sufficient 
deprivation of freedom to retain the efficacy of a deterrent to 
potential offenders. 

It will be at once objected that the institutijn of such 
a board together with the facilities necessary to enable it to 
function effectively v-ould involve a very heavy expense in com¬ 
parison with the relatively simple method of allowing a magistrate 
to impose sentence imtiediately after conviction. It is true that 
the initial expense would be considerably greater than that in¬ 
volved in the present method, but immediate exx^ense is not the 
only thing to be considered, -a scrstematic program of treatment 
based on an expertly secured kno7;ledge of causative factors has 
a possibility of succeeding, so much greater than that of the

Ilethods of Treatment 

Concentration upon the needs and possibilities of each 
individual offender v/ouid be the essential feature of :he method 
of such a board as we have suggested. Since such individualiza¬ 
tion would diagnose each case differently, many different methods 
of treatment would be required. .Ve here suggest a few of the 
general principles which our study has indicated as being de¬ 
sirable in the treatment of offenders, or which have been employed 
with some measure of success in other communities. 

Special methods ought to be employed in dealing with 
juveniles, and the use of such methods ought to be extended to 
all those below the age of twenty-one years. More than ten per 
cent of the prisoners in Ft. Sasuatchewan Gaol are less than 
twenty-one years of age, and there was the strongest evidence 
that in most of these oases the boys were receiving more .:arm 
than good from their gaol experience. Altogether, the evidence 
is overwhelming that boys below the age of twenty-one should not 
be sent under any circumstances to gaols of the kind now being 
used for adults. 

One of the possibilities in the treatment of youthful 
offe..der3 is the establishment of a farm colony which would be

an institution exoiusiveiy Tor t .ose under tv.’eaty-one y^ars of 
age and wouid not bear the stigma of a gaoi. 3uch an institu¬ 
tion has been advocated oy V/ardei) McLean of Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol 
as an aiternative to the imprisonment of boys in the common gaoi— 
imprisonment which his iong x^ractical experience has convinced 
him is fraught with insidious eviis for the younger delinqur'nts 
who find themseives among men who think and iive in-a world of 
crime. Such an institution ought to be entirely separate from 
the institution provided for adult criminals, and ought to be re¬ 
garded as a training school rather than as a place of punishment. 
By no means should such an institution be regarded merely as a 
place of detention, but it should include a very careful and 
thorough program of general and vocational education, with em¬ 
phasis on the development of a sense of social responsibility and 
the qualities of good citizenship. Lmong those in charge should 
be thoroughly trained psycho logists, psychiatrists, and education¬ 
alists. It is a vivid testimony to the lack of intelligent di¬ 
rection in our social affairs that the boys ..hose homes and 
schools have failed to give such training as would inculcate 
sufficient moral sense or social consciousneos should be placed 
for further -training in a gaol of which the officials are not 
trained in educational methods but are employed as guards with a 
military function. It was found that among the younger men im¬ 
prisoned in the Ft. Saskatchewan Gaol one of the most general 
causes of social failure was the lack of vocational training. 

The institution provided especially for these younger delinquents 
could very well include vocational training of types suited to 
most of the boys whom we studied in the gaol. V/e shall not attempt

here to outline details of such an ins11 tut ion, as we are limit¬ 
ing ourselves to such sugges Lions as grov/ directly from our ].er- 
sona I study of the group of prisoners in our gaol. That study, 
however, has convinced us tl.at the treatment needed by the young 
men whom we find there is of a far more constructive nature than 
anything that a gaol can provide. They need supervision tliat is 
personal and intimate; they need to be made to foei that someone 
has a personal interest in ihcm, and is r mdy to o:;tend kindly 
assistance though at the same time insisting Uj..on good behaviour. 

The organization of the institution should be much more nearly 
fitted to provide an atmosphere of normal social life than is that 
of the gaol. It is folly to expect that the detention of a young 
man for one or two years under the exceedingly abnormal conditions 
of the gaol regime and without contact wibh^normal social life 
will send him forth better fitted to take a x^lace in society. Our 
exx>erienGe with youthful prisoners indicates that the actual ef¬ 
fect is just the rev rse. The institutions which we are suggest¬ 
ing should include as large an element as possible of healthy so¬ 
cial life under adequate suprvision. It should include the largest 
possible measure of inmate seIf-government, in order that a feeling 
of genuine social responsibility be developed, hmong the young 
men whom we interviewed there seemed good reason to believe t .at 
everyone would respond to such a form of tr atment, except those 
of extreme mental deficiency, and obviously such cases should be 
in an institution of another kind. 

V/e are not without guidance in the form of experiments 
along the Line of such institutions, ^mong these are the dliit- 
tier otate ochool in Oalifornia, and the Borstal Institutions in 






- 185 - 


Knc;rland. Both of theao experiments are yielding a large maasore 
of suooesa. JJhoy inoLade the features of vooational training and 
of supervised group activity which we have suggested as being much 
needed by the boys whom we interviewed in l^'t . f^askatchewan Gaol. 

^t the same tine these institutions provide periods of strict 
supervision of a Length of several years or more, so that there 
is little need to fear that the kindly and humane treatment will 
attract boys to the institution and so remove the deterrent effect 
claimed for our present gaol system. V/e are told that delinquent 
boys sentenced by English magistrates tn a Borstal Institution 
have begged and pleaded for the shorter term in the common gaol, 
but that afterwards, convinced of the value of the Borstal train¬ 
ing they have been grateful for the longer sentence. 

In a large number of oases institutional life is not de¬ 
sirable for a first offender or even for one who has been before 
the court previously. V/here the home conditions are reasonably 
good, and where work and leisure activities are availabl , ad¬ 
ditional careful supervision within the normal environment are 
sometimes preferabie to the. regime of an institution, which must 
always involve some element of abnormality. For such cases the 
method of probation holds great possibilities, nere again the 
.primary need is for workers possessing thorough training as well 
as genuine human interest and understanding. The objection of 
expense is here^too^supported only by a short range view, for 
adequate supervision by parole officers can often divert delin¬ 
quent tendencies which would otherwise involve the expense of 


(a) See ”3oys in Trouble" by L. Le I.Iesurier for an admirable 
account of the English Borstal Institutions./ 








M'l. 




- 186 - 


ooiirt proceedinj3 and subsequent detention, iiiero is good reason 
to believe that a great deal of de linquei.cy v. ould be avoided in 
iilberta if an adequate system of probation were put ii to use in 
the oase of ail offenders up to the age of twenty-one for w.iom 
the method seemed suitable. Boys who failed to m ke good on xro- 
bation, or whose home surround ings were so bad that th^v ought to 
be removed from them, could be sent to the institution discussed 
above. 

Adult offenders ought to be given the s-me careful exam¬ 
ination as juveniles by the board responsible for administering 
treatment. Facilities should be available to give them the kind 
f treatment which they individually need, rather than as at 
present sentencing all alike to fine or imprisonment regardless 
of environment or personality. [Dhe treatment should always aim 
to restorethe individual to normal and staisfactory social life. 
The present system of short sentences is doing very little toward 
that end. Even if it were the aim of our present penal system 
to ret’orm men it would be an impossible achievement when eighty 
per cent of the prisoners received at our provincial gaol are 
sentenced by the courts to terms of less than four months. 

There are some adult criminals who do not respond to any 
form of treatment now knov;n. For such men permanent segregation 
must be used. There is, however, nothing to be gained by con¬ 
demning such men to a life of misery during their detention. They 
are the product of their inheritance and their environment and 
there is no proven basis for the belief that anything is accom¬ 
plished by punishing them. Ahiie our knowledge remains insuf¬ 
ficient to provide a successful method for their treatment, our 









- 187 - 


dealing with them should be limited to that measure of restraint 
which will securely protect society from their antisocial ten¬ 
dencies. Men of this kind ought to be detained under conditions 
similar to those which we have but recently adopted for the ii.sane, 
who also suffered punishment ^t the .ands of society in days that 
we now consider Unenlightened. Certainly purmanent segregation 
is more acceptable from the standpoint of social safety, as well 
as more just to the individual, than the infliction of successive 
short sentences intersperse, with periods of original activity. 

5he evidence is tfat there are very few men who are in¬ 
curably crin'iinal. iimong the 129 prisoners interviewed at the 
Ft .'Sasxvatchewan Caol not more than half a dozen showed deliberate 
criminal tendencies which would be likely to offer any difficul¬ 
ties which could not be overcome -by an intelligent program di¬ 
rected toward rehabilitation. 

The great majority of the prisoners studied were found 
to be too weak to meet the difficulties of the economic struggle 
or to resist the attraction of alcohol, theft, and other bad 
habits because of deficiency in either native intelligence or 
early training or both, k few were so extremely defective in 
intelligence or so definitely psychopathic as.to require care in 
the institutions provided for the feeble-minded and the insane. 

A large -number of those of definite feeble-mindedness and some 
of those classed as of borderline intelligence are not able to 
conduct themselves adequately as independent menbers of our pres¬ 
ent social system. They require supervision in either an instit¬ 
ution or a work colony of some kind. These men are the victims 
of weakness and inadequate background. It is inhuman to victimize 




.r f 






- 188 - 


thera farther by panlshment in gaol. Moreover the s ocoess of 
short terms to which many of them are sentei.oed does nothing to 
overcome their weakness or to fit them better to occupy a place in 
the economic order, -^t would be quite possible for Alberta to 
provide an institution really suited to the needs of men of thio 
kind, fhey are capable of performing tasks largely of a manual 
nature quite efficiently with a small amount of training. Under 
supervision they would work steadily as useful members of society, 
ihey would be much happier under comfortable conditions of super¬ 
vised employment than left as at present to drift from one short 
time job to another, with intervening periods of unemployment 
often resulting in crime and imprisonment. At the same time they 
would be less troublesome and probably less expensive to society 
than they are at the present time. ' -• 

Almost half of the prisoners belong to a claSs possessed 
of dull or borderline intelligence and without sufficient educa¬ 
tion or training to ensure work that would keep them occupied in 
socially acceptabLe ways. Hot capable of other than rough manual 
labor, they seek diversion by periods of idleness in between their 
short tine jobs, iheir background has been culturally poor and 
their education very limited. Consequently they find few whole¬ 
some interests to occupy them during their leisure while holding 
jobs or during their frequent periods of complete idleness. The 
result is the formation of habits of delinquency, for they are 
too poorly equipped intellectually to resist the attraction of 
petty theft or of alcohol, fhe crimes committed by men of .his 
class are usually very trivial. Large numbers of them are sen¬ 
tenced for theft of such things as wrenches, rings, watches, suit- 






M- 








- 189 - 


oases, or articles of clothing. For these offenoes or for vag¬ 
rancy or begging these raon serve sentence after sentence, usually 
lamenting their time in the gaol '^.nd determined not to reiurn, 
but too weak to carry out their intentions when once again sub¬ 
jected to the pressure of the world as independent citizens. Phe 
evidence previously presented as resulting from our study of 
prisoners is that gaol sentence's are confirming these men in their 
antisocial habits rather than reforming them. 

When we seek to find for these men a way of treatment'rather 
than of punishment we find no one method that is applicable to 
them all. 2heir needs are different and their treatment must bp 
individualized to give any measure of success. The board w-.ich 
we have proposed for the prescribing of treatment would find it 
necessary to adopt various methods for the men of this group. 

Some of the illiterate have a capacity for much more education 
than they received and their ability to hold jobs could be greatly 
increased by a period of several years spent in an institution 
really directed toward their training. Sheer lack of the training 
needed to do the kind of work they would like to do has been re¬ 
sponsible for the drifting and delinquency of many, and an in¬ 
stitution providing training in vocations within the range of 
their ability would go far toward solving their problem. Host 
of these men whose mentality is dull and whose background of train¬ 
ing inadequate could be fitted for some constructive place id the 
economic system by a period of training that would vary in nature 
and in length according to the needs of the individual, oome of 
those of borderline intelligence are fully aware of their inade¬ 
quacy and their failure, and realize their inability to conduct

themselves oroperly in society if left entirely to themselves. 

3uch men, although complete failures as independent citizens, often 
prove very conscientious and industrious v^orKors und r the super¬ 
vised regime of the gaol. They respond very well to a limited 
measure of responsibility, and often take great ^ride in their 
work. They can probably never become capable of the successful 
direction of their own affairs, but under tlie right measure of 
supervision would work in a very satisfactory way. Man^ of these 
men expressed their willingness to accept work under the super- 
vis ion -of a colony or permanent work camp, and while in the gaol 
have shown the qualities that would make them successful ma^i bers 
of such a community, providing adequate guidance were sux^plied to 
them. Cur institutions of Justice are measuring out to these men 
something much less than Justic when, for their failure to meet 
the demands of an economic order decidedly too severe' for the a- 
bility given to them by their inheritance and their early environ¬ 
ment, they are sentenced to successive short terms of degrading 
and demoralizing impjrrsonment and then released again to face an 
increasingly difficult economic world less qualified than when 
they were removed from it. 

There is also the group of dull or borderline intellect 
-who in early youth developed habits of active delinquency, but 
whose thinking and attitude has not yet become that of the delib¬ 
erate ciiminal. Their present gaol experiences are giving than 
very good education toward becoming deliberate and embittered 
criminals. It seems necessary that such meii should spend a period 
of time in an institution, but it should be an institution with 
some aim other than that of punishment. If such men V7ere hopeless’ 







- 191 - 


and incurable, we would still not be justified l/i sentencln^j ihern 
to short periods of Imprisonment, 'ind releasing them again to prey 
upon society. Permanent segregation has been suggested as the 
most intelligent way of dealing with those whose delinquency we 
are as yet unable to treat successfully. But the great majority 
of these men are not hopeless and Incurable. They will respond 
to treatment, but It must be treatment and not vindictive punish¬ 
ment. To deal successfully with these amateur and potential 
criminals changes must be made in our present gaol system - changes 
that aim to reconstruct human personalities. V/e outline briefly 
below some of the changes which our experlenc in the Ft. Saskat¬ 
chewan Gaol has convinced us would increase the effectiveness of 
gaols of its kind. 

L. The replacement of fixed and short sentences by 
longer sentences of indeterminate duration, the ti.'-e of release 
to be determined by qualified persons of the prison staff on the 
basis of the length of time required to fit the prisoner for a 
place in society. If prisons are to reform at all, the short 
sentences must go, for human nature is not reconstructed over¬ 
night, and the sentence of fixed length must go, for no judge or 
magistrate or even the most highly trained psychologist can ^re- 
dict the time that will be required to change a criminal's nature. 

2. The provision of facilities for careful psychological 
and psychiatric exaLilnatl n of each prisoner, and the administra¬ 
tion of treatment in accordance with the individual's needs. If 
a sentencing board had already given the individual such study, 
repetition would not be required, but the progress of the prisoner 
should be observed and guided by officials qualified to understand 


him. 






- 192 - 


3. The training of prison offioiais in modern methods 

of dealing with human nature, a training involving psyohoiogy and 
sooial work, as well as penal administration. The work of penal 
administration ought to be elevated to the rank of a profession. 
Those who undertake the care of men in gaols have a very difficult 
task, expeoially if their aim is to send their wards forth better 
men than when they came in. They are dealing with the individuals 
for whom our other i..stitutions were not adequate. Tlie home fail¬ 
ed, the school failed, the church failed. lio ouher social organ¬ 
ization has made of these prisoners the kind of men who are social¬ 
ly acceptable. Kow we ask the j^.rison administrator to do it. But 
we give him no special training for this exceedingly complex task 
of dealing with recalcitrant human beings. He needs the very best 
training that can be given toward an understanding of human nature 
and human behaviour. Every officer who has contact with the prison 
ers ought to have such a training. Prison work ought to be a 
profession calling for well-trained men who are wi ling to devote 
themselves to the service of that large unfortunate element of 
our population which constitutes our gaol populatioii, rather than, 
as it now is, a poorly paid job requiring no training. 

4. A thorough program of education. It is by means of 
- education, in the broadest sense, that human nature is remade. 

The education provided in a gaol should be much broader than th t 
of our ordinary public school curriculum, -‘■t should emphasize 
training in social eonsciousness, in citizenship, in vocation. 

It should not be a single stereotyped program, such as that which 
dominates our public and high schools, but should provide for the 
varying needs of different individuals.

5. l?he reoonstruot ing^power of religion ought to be 
given a chance to work through boh group and personal means. 
Religion is too powerful a factor in human experience to be neg¬ 
lected by those who would seek to reconstruct broken natures. 

Among the men in charge of an institution for delinquents should 
be at leas, one whose opportunity it is to know the men personally 
and in such an intimate way that he may give guidance in those 
experiences of inner life and meaning which we include within the 
term religion. '£o most people genuine religious transformation 
can come only through an understanding of religion in terms of 
actual living from day to day. Thus such an experience is much 
more likely to come through the guidance of one who lives the same 
life and knows the everyday experiences tnan by means of abstract 
emotional appeals presented at mass meetings. Personal religious 
guidance is an instrument which will be used increasingly in in¬ 
stitutions. for delinquents as the general public grows tolerant 
enough to overcome the denominational difficulty. 

6. Remuneration of prisoners for work well done, ouch 

a practice would do much to build up the self-respect of the men, 
and would be an incentive to good work, it would also mean that 
the small sum accumulated would assist the prisoner to get a fresh 
start after release. She realization that he was not working en¬ 
tirely for nothing would eliminate much of the present tendency 
of gaol sentCi.oes to give the prisoner a grudge against society, 
i'he method of remuneration could be used also as a measure of 
training in social responsibility, by requiring that the man who 
has a family or dependents should send part of his earnings to 
them tc: assist in their upkeep during his incarceration.

7. 2he Classification and segregation of prisoners. She 
facilities suggested above for 3t..dy of the Individual off nders 
would provide a sound basis upon which to classify the men. so 

as to avoid much of he evil of bad influence which now thoroughly 
saturates the gaol atmosphere . 

8. j?he elimination of such measures of repression and 
degradation as still remain, ihe enforcement of silence, as in¬ 
dicated previously, breeds fear, stealth, and secrecy. -It is an 
unwholesome influence. Deprivations in food furnish grounds for 
discontent, and all such grievances are magnified greatly in 

the minds of the prisoners during the- hours of solitude. Brooding 
over these grievances is detrimental to the state of the prisoners' 
minds, and tends to increase the feeling of antagonism toward the 
world in general. Punishment by confinement to the "black hole" 
with ration of bread and water is very unsound from the viewpoint 
of its effect upon the prisoner, boy of nineteen after confine¬ 
ment in the dark cell for seventy-two hours for "saucing" a guard 
declared the experience to be the worst mental agony he had ever 
endured, and was certain that had he been left fora few h urs 
longer in the empty, black, nothingness of the underground cell 
he would have lost his mind . Buch punishment does nothing to 
accomplish an understanding of 'the reasons for.-the misbehavior* 

It merely rankles in his mind, developing a feeling of greater 
antagonism toward everyone associated with his stay in the gaol. 
Physical brutality has been eliminated from our gaols, but mental 
suffering is just as cruel as physical, and at least equally harm¬ 
ful. 5he gaol life will not reconstruct men until the conditions 
are made such that an attitude of cooperation is engendered in

the men rather than one of repressed antagonism. ^ step toward 
eliminating the humiliation of gaol treatment was made by 7/arden 
MoLean during 1932, when the custom of clipping the hair of 
prisoners was abolished except as a punishment for serious 
breaches of discipline. 

9. Ihe introduction of group activities and recreations 
among the prisoners, so that the gaol term may be a more effective 
preparation for normal, life outside. She present regime is very 
unnatural and makes subsequent adaption to social life more dif¬ 
ficult. Lien must live in terms of social contacts, and. they can¬ 
not be trained to live better socially by a tedious routine entire¬ 
ly void of hS'althy social relationships. The rule depriving 
prisoners of access to newspapers is one instance of the tendency 
of the present system to break the contact of the prisoners with 
the natural, normal life of the outside world. 

10. The institution of a system of probation and guidance 
for the prisoners who are released. If our aim is to restore the 
offender to a satisfactory place in society it is essential that 
some assistance and guidance be given during the period following 
discharge . 

■Jhe fubdamental principle which must xDermeate this whole 
method of treatment if it is to accomplish the desirec end of 
reconstructed character is that of genuine personal interest in 
the individual offender. Llost of the men in the gaol have for 
many years lived in a world in which no one nas taken a real in¬ 
terest in them as individuals. V/e found that they respond warmly 
to the personal touch. The personal touch is largely lacking under 
the present system of prison administration, but it is absolutely

essential to any i*orra of treatment which is to appeal to the better 
selves of the prisoners and to draw oai suffiolent effort on their 
part to ensure a fair chance of their auooessfui reestablishment 
in normal life. 

Even an institution involving' such principles of treat¬ 
ment as we have sug^'ested ought to be used for only those offenders 
who show definitely delinquent personal tendencies. It would not 
be appropriate for prisoi^ers of types that number almost half of 
the present gaol population. It should not be used for any of 
the men below the age of twenty-one. It would not be suited to 
the psychopathic cases, or to m^Tjn of extreme mental deficiency. 

Both of these groups should be in the special institutions pro¬ 
vided for them. I'hose of dull mentality lacking mainly ability 
and self-control might much better be colonized on farms or in 
connection with other industries, and employed under permanent 
supervision. Another type existing in considerable ivunilers among 
the present gaol population is the alcoholic. Ihe contribution 
of alcbholism to delinquency is a special problem which must be 
given further study and experimentation before we know the best 
way of dealing with the men who are alcoholic victims, ^^hort 
gaol terms are certainly far from adequate as a treatment for 
them. - 

final group which comprises a significant but constantly 
fluctuating proportion of the present gaol population is that of 
the vagrants and freight-riders who are the victims of economic 
pressure, 'fiiere is usually some weakness of personality or train¬ 
ing that results in the rejection of these particular individuals 

from industry, and the men themselves often require treatment or

trainlng. The ineqaallty and unjustLoe ot the eoonomlo system 
is very plainly a large underlying factor in the delinquency of 
not only this group, but of a very large proportion of the gaol 
population, llo consideration of methods of troatmeat' can justly 
overlook the economic factor, but certainly it is being completely 
evaded by the present policy of sentencing vagrants to short terms 
of imprisonment and then releasing them with no more money and no 
more training than they had before, with no assistance for future 
employment, and with in addition, very often, a more unsocial at¬ 
titude. The institution of cooperative colonies to absorb these 
unemployed men would remove a great deal of the crime problem of 
Alberta. IJore than sixty per cent^ of the group of prisoners we 
have studied were unemployed at the time of arrest, and only fif¬ 
teen per cent were steadily employed. 

The Prevention of Crime .- V/hile it is essential that we. 
place our methods of treating offenders on a scientific and ef¬ 
fective basis, it is even more essential that we give careful 
attention to measures for the preventio'n of crime. To effect a 
reduction in the amount of criminal behaviour v/e must systemati¬ 
cally attack the whole range of social problems facing our com¬ 
munities, for .he crime occurring in any.community is but a mani¬ 
festation of the failure of social institutions to function ade¬ 
quately. -u. study of causative factors in the lives of prisoners 
in Ft . Saskatchewan Saol brought us at every point face to face 
with the fundamental problems of our social order. Having found 
low mentaliuy, and large families that could not be properly 
provided for, we must face the xDroblems of eugenics, and the 
control of the quantity and quality of our population. Having 















-L98- 


foand unhappy and uncon^jenial homo env Ironm--nts, we must face 
ohe problems of family relationships and sooiai control of the 
environment of children. Having found Inadequate sohooIUig and 
Lack of vocational training, we must face the problems Involved 
in our whole educational system and Its apparent failure to qual¬ 
ify large numbers of youth for any constructive place In life. 
Having found the growth of delinquent habits during Idleness, we 
must face the problem of unused leisure time. Having found a 
large contribution to delinquency from the abuse of alcohol, we 
must face the huge problem of the exploitation or social control 
of this persistently destructive traffic. And permeating almost 
the whole of the social life in which we found our causative 
factors Is the economic system with Its Inequality, its training 
to an over-emphasis on the value of property, its difficulties 
too great to be overcome by the poorly qualified, ana its Insid¬ 
ious temptations breaking down the morale of men of all classes 
and all cIroumstances. 

Recent discoveries and conclusions regarding jhe causation 
of crime give good reason for a hopeful attitude toward the pos- 
si’bllltles of prevention. Ihere has been little evidence that 
criminal tendencies, as such, are Inherited. Llental deficiency 
seems to be very definitely heritable; but it is only to the 
extent that external circumstances bre .k down the social adjust¬ 
ment of the Individual at the point of weakness, that criminal 
behaviour depends upon the traits that are Inherited. The very 
recognition of this fact that all feeble-minded individuals are 
potential offenders offers real promise for the development of 
fundamental measures looking to prevention of crime. American

authorities on the subject or mental djl'icienoy agree tnat it can 

( 8l ^ 

be overcome by the proper icind or education in early youth. 
Fortunately mental detectives can oe identii'ied at an early age, 
and tnere is no reason why we should not select rrom among the 
children in the early grades or public sciiool those who require 
special training, and thus prevent their railure in later lire. 

It would be infinitely more economical in the long run to 
institute facilities for a complete survey of our public school 
population in order to isolate in institutions adapted to the 
purpose those in need of special training, rather than to allow 
large numbers of boys and girls to drop out of our schools as 
failures thus becoming misfits, expensive to society. 

The whole educational system can be broadened to permit 
of more adaptability to individual needs, and to attempt less to 
force all types of children into a common mould. It can also be 


(a)Davies, in Social Control of the Mentally Deficient, says: 

”V/hen institutional care begins early enough most of the 
intellectually subnormal 'children can be trained to taxe a very 
satisfactory place in society. This training must be of an 
entirely different nature to that given in the public schools." 

Dr. W. E. Fernald maices this statement: "Those defectives 
whose defects are recognized while they are young children, 
and who receive proper care and training during their child¬ 
hood, are, as a rule, not especially troublesome after they 
have been safely guiaed through the period of early adoles¬ 
cence." (Q,uoted by Davies in Social Control of the Mentally 
Deficient, p. 214). 

Dr. H. H. Goddard, Director of the Research Laboratory 
of the Training School at Vineland, New Jersey, for Feeble- 
Minded Girls and Boys, takes a similar position in his book: 
"Feeble-Mindedness, its Causes and Consequences." He main¬ 
tains that moronity is a problem of education, and that the 
right kind of education can make those of definitely low 
levels of intelligence capable of filling appropriate po¬ 
sitions happily.

made to inolude training in sex reiat ionships and home-making, 
so that young people may approach these most vital of ail personal 
problems with an intelligent and healthy attitude. 3ich training 
would greatly increase the probabilities of success and hax.piness 
in marriage relat ionships and home life. Aa extensi-an of leisure 
t i::ie activities of wholesome and constructive nature especially 
for the children of underprivileged families would remove much 
of the cause of juvenile delinquency. 

The control of population by private use of contraceptive 
measures and by government storilization of the unfit will de¬ 
crease that section of the population which now contributes most 
heavily to the delinquent class. The existence of large families 
among the classes whose material circumstances do not permit the 
proper support or training of the children, the tendency of large 
families to make impossible the proper care of any of the child¬ 
ren by the parents, the prolific reproduction of the people of 
mental weakness and often of both mental and physical disease, 
ail of these factors have been seen in our study to contribute 
to a Large extent to the growing number of unfit and criminal 
citizens in Alberta. There is therefore a tremendous need for 
a wider spread of knowledge of hygienic measures wl.ich will limit 
the reproduction of the socially undesirable. There is need for 
a saner and more enlightened view on the part of the general pub¬ 
lic. There is need to free the attitude of the people toward 
social legislation from the irrational taboos of certain outworn 
religious beliefs. Citizens of iilberta need to re_*lize that it 
is more Christian to Imit the population to families of such 
size and quality as will contribute to a more capable future

general public, as well as those in positions of administration,

introduction of methods of prevention even at considerable in¬

CHAPTER VI 

Sm:MARIES AND CCNCLUSIONS 

Some of the findings of this study may be summarized 
very generally as follows: The great majority of the prisoners 
in the Ft. Saskatchewan Provincial Gaol have become delinquents 
because, weak in native Intelligence or deficient in early train¬ 
ing, they have lacked the ability to meet the difficulties of 
the economic struggle or to resist the attraction of alcohol, 
theft, or other bad habits. The courts which sentence these men 
to imprisonment give very little attention to the individual 
offender, his personality or his background, but place tneir 
emphasis upon the offence committed, and impose the penalty pre¬ 
scribed by law for such an offence regardless of the probable effect 
of such treatment upon the offender. The gaol as it now functions 
provides safe detention for the sentenced men, but does little or 
nothing to help the prisoners to become better qualified for social 
life on their release, and in many cases sends them forth with 
an attitude which increases the probability of their anti-social 
behavior in future. The great need is for a study of the 
individual offender, and the provision of such treatment as will 
tend to reconstruct his character and enable him to live socially 
after his release. Individual treatment is especially desirable 
for youthful offenders, many of whom are suffering great mental and 
moral harm under present gaol conditions. The methods of treatment 
recommended in this report are likely to be criticised on the 
ground that they will lack the deterrent effect of punishment. 

The criticism loses its force because of the almost complete 
absence of evidence for the existence of such deterrent effects as

the present punitive methods aro generally considered to exert 
upon those who would otherwise become offenders. 

The methods of treatment which seem to be desirable in¬ 
clude permanent segregation for those few individuals who are in¬ 
curably criminal, training for those whose lack of vocation is 
responsible for their delinquency, education of an appropriate 
kind for those who are illiterate because of low intelligence 
or lack of opi')ortunity, sux^ervised employment rnd colonization 
for those of mental ability too low for adequate social adjustment 
and carefully supervised institutional life with training in 
social resiDonsibi 1 ities for uhe young offenders v;]io have developed 
definite delinquent tendencies. 

Having found the causative factors of crime deeply im¬ 
bedded in our social structure and integrated into the whole com¬ 
plexity of social institutions and human relationships we realize 
that any adequate preventative program must include a progressive 
solution of the vast range of social problems f cing our commun¬ 
ities. The soundest method of dealing with crime is that which 
prevents its appearance by dealing constructively with the pro¬ 
blems of eugenics and population control, of education and vo¬ 
cational training, of marriage and family relationships, of 
leisure time activitie.s for both young people and adults, of 
alcohol, drugs, and other agencies of vice, and of religion as 
a constructive life force. 

Public Opinion. - It is upon enlightened public opinion 
that we wait for progress in treatment of offenders and in dealing 
with our social problems generally. The public attitude toward 

criminals is slow to change. The present demand for vindictive 









-C04- 


punishment as a form of roveiige vjLIL gi'adually be roi laoed by a 
realization ti.at v?e can be more humane and Ju 3 i , a/id at the same 
time serve best the interests of society, by seeking to under- 
staiK. those 'm.o offend and to give them the treatment which they 
individually need. 

^ scientific approach to social problems is delayed by ti.e 
reluctance of vhe layman to surrender to the trained specialist 
th se fields of human relationships v/hich have always been con¬ 
sidered the unquestioned domain of untrained common sense and 
everyday pr.^cticll experience. This reactionary attitude is 
gradually being overcome as knowledge of modern psychology and 
social science spreads among the general populat ion. 

Perhaps the greatest barrier to social progress is the 
reluctance of administrator and taxpayer to appropriate funds for 
new institutions, -i* vital need is that citizens and governors 
should come to see that more scientific and thorough methodology, 
although involving heavier expense during the period of inaugura¬ 
tion, is more truly economical because it provides cure and pre¬ 
vention whereas the unscientific methods of traditin are merely 
pailiatives. 

The Heed for Research and Study .- Public opinion and 
administration alike will progress slowly until students of 
social problems can speak with some measure of agreement and 
certainty as to causes and needs. it is therefore of the utmost 
importance that study and research should go forward on the most 
thorough and scientific basis possible, dependable knowledge must 
be the basis of our social advances, and dependable knowledge can 
come only from detailed and scientific investigation.

The present study has dealt with problems of .elinquency 
as found among the prisoners of an Alberta provincial gaol. It 
has been a study involving much more detail and looKing deeper 
into rundamental conditions and causes tnan is possloie to ad¬ 
ministrators under our present system. Eut from tiie standpoint 
of really understanding those deep motives of human nature which 
are fundamental to misbehaviour it has been a superficiaa study. 
There is tremendous need for more detailed and analytical study 
of those whose conduct brings them into conflict with accepted 
social standards. There is equal need for detailed and thorough 
study of the social conditions which are producing our delinquents. 
It is hoped that the present study will prove of value as a start¬ 
ing point for other investigations and researches in this province 
into the phenomena of personality disorder and social conflict 
which are fundamental to our problems of delinquency,. 

The following suggestions pointing the way to further 
studies in this immediate problem of delinquent conduct and its 
treatment have grown out of the present investigation. The 
study of youthful offenders offers far more of guidance and in¬ 
formation than the study of mature gaol inmates. More valuable 
information can probably be gained by the detailed study of a 
comparatively small number of individuals over a period of time 
than by a superficial statistical study of a larger number of men. 
The statistical figures depend for their value upon the thorough¬ 
ness of the studies which furnish their basis. A complete study 
of youthful offenders should include the most thorough investi¬ 
gation possible into the conditions of home, corainunity, and school 

life under which the early childhood was spent. Much valuable

guidance ror future treatment of delinquents can almost certainly 
be gainea by experimentation with various methods of treating 
offenders of different types and of different ages. The most 
fruitful field of worlc in delinquency seems clearly to be with 
the youngest children who in school or home life display tend¬ 
encies to unsocial behaviour. However we have seen evidence that 
much can also be accomplished by careful personal guidance of 
the younger men who enter our common gaols. 

This study has impressed us very strongly with thereal- 
ization that even those individuals who reach maturity without 
having learned to live in adequate social adjustment still possess 
great possibilities for development of character and training 
in citizenship. Tremendous advances can be made in dealing with 
problems of delinquency if the individuals who have failed are 
approached with an attitude that is both human and scientific. 

We need confidence in their possibilities and the desire to under¬ 
stand.
