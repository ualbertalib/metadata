ABSTRACT 


The principal aim of this study was to determine the guidance 
value of Grade IX departmental examinations and other selected factors 
at this level* These factors were studied in relation to the degree 
to which they indicated students* chances of success with the matri¬ 
culation program in Composite High Schools* A secondary aim was to 
present the findings in as meaningful and useful a fashion as possible* 

In addition to Grade IX departmental examinations, the factors 
studied included the Grade IX General Test, relative class standing in 
Grade IX, honor points determined from Grade IX results, age, and sex* 

The subjects of the study were Composite High School students who had 
been enrolled in Grade IX in 1953-5^# and who, in writing six Grade XII 
departmental examinations in June, 1957# were eligible for matriculation* 
The importance of this study arises from the objectives of all 
High Schools, the unique function of Composite High Schools, the res¬ 
ponsibility of students and parents for educational decisions, and the 
concern expressed in regard to this problem by Composite High School 
officials. 

In addition to the traditional academic program, Composite High 
Schools provide general, commercial, technical and home economics 
courses* Of the 553 students with whom this study deals, 217 or 39$ 
failed to matriculate* Thus, guidance is essential if students are 
to enroll in the program which is best suited to them* 

Matriculation success and failure constituted the criteria of 
the study. The major requirements for matriculation are a "B” or higher 
standing in the required Grade XU courses, and an overall average of 
at least 60$ in these courses* Students who did not fulfil these 







requirements failed to matriculate. 

.The results of this study indicate that the majority of 
students who fail to matriculate do so in that they do not obtain the 
"B" standing in one or more subjects. In comparison, only a small 
percentage fail because they do not obtain the required average. More 
students failed Mathematics 30 than any other Grade XII subject. 

Grade IX General Test scores and aggregate scores on Grade IX 
departmental examinations were found to bear a substantial positive 
relationship to the criteria of matriculation success or failure. 
Relative class standing in Grade IX and honor points gained in 
Grade IX were found to bear a very significant positive relationship 
to the criteria of the study. 

Grade IX General Test scores were found to bear a substantial 
positive relationship to aggregate scores on Grade IX departmental 
examinations. This finding suggests the possible use of Grade IX 
General Test scores as a predictor of Grade DC achievement itself. 

Age was found to be so slightly related to the criteria as to 
be negligible. No significant differences in matriculation success or 
failure were found in relation to the sex of a student. 

The study indicated that it is possible to give reliable 
guidance to prospective matriculation students in Composite High 
Schools on the basis of Grade DC General Test scores, aggregate 
scores on Grade DC departmental examinations, relative class standing 
in Grade DC, and honor points gained in Grade DC. When these guidance 
factors are considered simultaneously, rather than individually, the 
reliability of the guidance is increased.

THE PROBLEM AND ITS IMPORTANCE 

Prediction of scholastic success is important in counselling 
and has been, therefore, the subject of many theses. Specifically, a 
great deal of research has been devoted to studying the relationship 
between high school achievement and subsequent college success* 1 
Investigations in this area have contributed much to the problem of 
counselling students* Furthermore, local validity studies have predicted 
particular students® chances of successfully completing certain programs 
in some institutions. 2 Information of this type is of considerable 
value to the prospective University student* 

The many useful findings and the general progress in predicting 
college success from high-school achievement have encouraged other 
investigations aimed at determining the factors involved in high school 
achievement itself.-' Information, similar to that which is made available 
through studies at the college level, would be beneficial to the junior 
high-school graduate* This student, upon entering high school, is im¬ 
mediately faced with important decisions, dealing with the type of 
program which he should follow, and the particular electives which he 
should take within this program. 

Aims of the investigation . The central aim of this study was to 
determine the guidance value of departmental examination results and 
certain other factors at the Grade IX level. The particular guidance

value sought was the degree to which these factors could be used to 
indicate a student’s probable success or failure. The criteria of 
success or failure were defined in terms of the student's performance 
in the matriculation program offered in Composite High Schools in the 
Province of Alberta, 

Another aim of this study, scarcely less important than its 
central aim, was to present the statistical findings of the study in 
as meaningful and useful a fashion as possible. 

Importance of the investigation . The traditional role of the 
Canadian High School has recently been challenged in such provinces as 
British Columbia, Alberta, and Ontario, The unique purpose of preparing 
students for entry into university is no longer regarded as the only 
justification for the existence of a high school. Large numbers of 
pupils are attending high schools in Canada today, who do not have 
either the desire, or the ability to go on to university. These stud¬ 
ents are preparing for careers which should take them along other routes. 
Their goals are not the goals of the prospective university student. 

It is wasteful, and often detrimental, to place these students in pro¬ 
grams which move them toward objectives in which they are not interested. 
Such programs soon become meaningless for them* Further, it does not 
seem just that students who are not planning to attend university should 
be forced to enroll in a university preparatory program* The matric¬ 
ulation or academic program has not been designed for these students; 
it is not, therefore, suitable for them.

enrolls in a Composite High School, In the latter case, a student must 
first choose one of several broad programs; having made this choice, he 
is then faced with the selection of elective subjects within that program. 

In England, as in Canada, parents are anxious that their children 

k 

be educated according to their ability and aptitude. In England, the 
"eleven plus” examinations are used in an attempt to achieve this ob¬ 
jective.^ These examinations are written, as suggested by their name, 
at about the age of eleven and are used as the measure of the ability 
and aptitude of students who attend publicly supported schools in 
Britain. On the basis of these examination results, students are en¬ 
rolled in particular types of schools, and in particular programs for 
which they seem best suited. They are, then, being educated according 
to their ability and aptitude as measured by these examinations. Neither 
students, nor parents, therefore, are faced with the need for making a 
decision as to further educational program, in the publicly supported 
schools. The choice is made for them, by the educational officials, on 
the basis of the examination results* 

In contrast to the British system, this choice in Canada is not 
made by educational officials. Responsibility for such decisions here 
has traditionally rested in the hands of the student and his parents, 

A student entering Grade X is free to enroll In any of the educational 
programs offered in the high school which he is attending. While this 
procedure is generally deemed wise on the North American continent, its 
ultimate efficiency and effect on the student are very often the subject

Hence, Composite or Comprehensive High Schools are being 
established in many Canadian centres. These schools have been designed 
to provide suitable and beneficial educational programs for all students. 
They are thus serving not only students who are contemplating future 
university education, but also those who are not. The provision of 
courses described as general, commercial, technical, and home economics, 
in addition to academic, is, in the opinion of the writer indicative of 
progress, provided, of course, these programs are well prepared and 
challenging. 

One of the most important objectives of Composite High Schools, 
therefore, is to provide a range of programs within which all high school 
students may profitably work. However, the mere provision of the physical 
facilities, and the inclusion of a wide range of programs in such schools 
are not in themselves the complete solution. Because of its size, the 
complexity of its operation, and the diversified character of its 
program, the Composite High School is faced with many special problems. 

One of the most important and pressing is the guidance of pupils into 
programs best suited to them. This problem is so closely related to the 
nature of the Composite High School, that the success of the school 
depends, to a large extent, on its solution. At the same time, the 
problem is one of the most difficult with which students and school 
officials alike are confronted. It is recognized, of course, that this 
problem is present to some extent, in any high school which provides 
elective subjects, even though such a school may offer but one main 
program. Nevertheless, the situation is more complex when a student

of controversy# In such cases, people are concerned, not so much with 
the right to make such a decision, but rather with the method by which 
the decision is made. A decision which is to be intelligent and ben¬ 
eficial to the student, must be made on the basis of a proper foundation. 
In the British system, as already mentioned, the basis is the "eleven 
plus" examination. It is the purpose of this study to examine the basis 
used in Canada with particular reference to the Composite High Schools 
in Alberta. 

The Senior High School Handbook for the Province of Alberta 

states that, "The prime aim of the school is to assist each Alberta 

„ 6 

youth in his growth towards maximum self-realization . Of the 553 
Composite High School students included in this study, 217, or thirty- 
nine per cent, failed to meet matriculation requirements. Many of them 
failed several subjects and were, it would seem, enrolled in programs 
not well suited to them. This statement becomes more significant when 
the number of other programs available to students within such schools 
is considered. 

On March 27, 1956, a conference of Composite High School admin¬ 
istrators was held in Calgary. The purpose of this assembly was to 
discuss the major problems confronting Composite High Schools. In a 
subsequent report of the conference, the following question stands first 
in a summary and restatement of the ma jor problems submitted: ,f Within 
the present scope of Composite High School programs, how should students 

be placed in programs to which they are best suited by way of ability, 

7 

aptitude, past achievement, and interests?"

In summary, then, it may be stated that the present investig¬ 
ation grew out of the four following considerations: (l) the prime aim 
of all high schools; (2) the unique function of Composite High Schools; 
(3) the responsibility of the student and his parents for making 
educational decisions; and ( 4 ) the present concern on the part of 
Composite High School officials for guiding students into programs 
best suited to them*

REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE 

Much time and study has been devoted to the problem of predict¬ 
ing success at the university level. Bloom and deV, Heyns summarized 
the major findings of the research in this area in 1956, 1 In so doing, 
they expressed a feeling of frustration because of the vast quantities 
of literature available on the topicIn contrast to this situation, 
relatively little attention has been given to the parallel question of 
predicting high school success* Nevertheless, research relating to high 
school achievement has resulted in some significant findings. 

Factors involved in high school achievement . The major concern 
of research dealing with achievement in high school has been the deter¬ 
mination of the factors responsible for achievement. In England, con¬ 
siderable attention has been given to the 11 plus examinations, from 
the point of view of their efficiency in predicting academic achievement* 
This attention has resulted from the fact that these examinations are 
used for selection purposes and their reliability is, therefore, subject 
to continuous study, 

Emmett and Wilasat, studying the prediction of School Certificate 
performance, obtained a very high correlation of *84 between the pooled 
11 plus transfer tests and the pooled School Certificate results,3 

In another study of the prediction success of entrance examin¬ 
ations, Peel and Ruther found that the standardized intelligence test

was the best single predictor of achievement with regard to School 

Certificate results. This finding held true whether the examinations 

were considered in relation to their prediction of success in the Arts 

or the Science programs. This series of entrance examinations included 

English and Arithmetic tests, as well as the Intelligence test. 1 * 

Peel and Armstrong, in a study of the use of essays in selection 

at 11 plus, found that the most efficient predictor of academic success 

was a battery of tests which included English Composition, Moray House 

English, and the Moray House Intelligence test.5 

Wrigley made a survey to test the generally accepted view of 

educational psychologists in Britain that the Intelligence test is the 

best predictor of success in the grammar school.^ His survey confirmed 

this view. He also found, however, that a battery of three tests resulted 

in more efficient predictions.^ 

Wellman, in a study of high school achievement, reported that 

Otis I.Q. scores contributed more to the prediction of success than any 

8 

of the other variables he had examined. He further found that his 
predictions were improved significantly by considering other selected 
factors.^ 

Stagner, studying academic achievement in 1933, reported only 
negligible relationships between personality tests and grade averages. 10 

Harris, in studies of college achievement, found motivation to 
be the most important non-intellectual factor involved. 11 Motivation 
was followed in importance by other personal, social, and economic

characteristic s• 

Gough, studying high school achievement in 19^9, reported a 

growing realization that non-intellectual factors must be assessed, 

12 

if the margin of prediction error was to be diminished. Studying 
the non-intellectual factors further in 1953 , Gough found that the 
attempts to relate these factors to scholastic achievement had not 

IQ 

been particularly successful. J 

May, in an early study of academic achievement, concluded that 

intelligence and degree of application were the most reliable predictors 
lk 

of academic success. 

With regard to this important factor of motivation, Frandsen 
and Sessions found that while some students are motivated to some extent 
by interests, others are more highly motivated by extrinsic factors. 1 ^ 
These two groups were found not to differ either in average scholastic 
achievement, or in quality of personal adjustment. 

Myers studied the possible relationship between biographical 
factors and academic achievement. He was able to increase a multiple 
correlation of .62 to .65 by adding a biographical score to the pred¬ 
iction battery of average high school grade and two aptitude test 
scores.^ 

Schultz and Green, studying the relationship between achieve¬ 
ment, and attitudes and interests, found a small but positive corre¬ 
lation. 1 ^ 

In 19^9, Black and Ulmer studied the efficacy of Grade XX marks 





11 


19 

in predicting Grade XII success. Their study represents the first 
such investigation in the Province of Alberta. The subjects of the 
study were city, town, and rural students, who had completed Grade Xll 
in 1941, 1942, or 1943. A stratified random sample of five hundred 
students was used in this study. Measuring the relationship between 
scores on corresponding Grade IX and Grade XII subjects, and between 
the averages for the entire sample, and for several sub-groups, the 
authors obtained correlation coefficients ranging from 0.4c to 0.74. 

The various correlation coefficients were found to have a predictive 
efficiency ranging from 8.3 per cent to 32.7 per cent better than a 
guess. 

The authors concluded that a Grade XII score predicted from a 
Grade IX score was not very accurate, and therefore, of little practical 
use. They recommended for further study that a prediction measure made 
up of a number of factors be sought. 

Moysa, in 1950* studied the comparative value of prediction 

tests, administered in the University High School between 1946 and 
20 

1948. His aim was to determine which tests showed the greatest promise 
in predicting scholastic achievement in the High School. The tests used 
were six intelligence tests, and two reading achievement tests. The 
author found that no one intelligence test proved itself superior in 
predicting academic achievement throughout the high school grades. He 
further found that neither reading test was superior to the other in 
predicting achievement* However, each test used at each grade level 






- 







12 


indicated a significant or a highly significant relationship with 
academic achievement. The author concluded that these intelligence 
tests and reading achievement tests could be relied upon to predict 
academic achievement in the high school, with a reasonable degree of 
accuracy. 

In 1953> Evans selected for study the 1945 Grade IX class, and 

traced the progress of this class in their subsequent high school car- 
21 

eers. He compared the records of students classified into A,B, and 
C categories from the point of view of their duration of attendance in 
high school, their performance in compulsory, academic and optional 
subjects, and their perseverance in repeating subjects. Four hundred 
students, from each category, were selected at random from the 1945 
Grade IX class. 

The duration of time spent in high school was found to be 
greatest among "A" students, with over half of the students dropping 
out by the end of Grade X. Of the original four hundred students rep¬ 
resenting each group, 3 ”C" students, 107 student^ and 268 n A n 
students obtained High School Diplomas. From the point of view of per¬ 
formance, though all categories of students performed satisfactorily 
in optional subjects, ,, A M students were superior to and W G" students 
in both compulsory and academic subjects. Both M A” and W B M students 
displayed greater determination in repeating subjects. 

r 

Summarizing the results of these studies, it is quite evident 
that intelligence, as measured by intelligence tests, plays a very im-

13 


portant role in academic achievement at the high school level. This con¬ 
clusion is in agreement with the findings in relation to achievement 
at the college level. With reference to the non-intellectual factors 
involved in achievement, motivation would appear to be the most signi¬ 
ficant at the high school level, as at the college level. Though re¬ 
search has indicated the influence of other personal, social, and economic 
factors on academic achievement, it has had little success in determin¬ 
ing the extent of this influence. 

Limitations of past prediction studies . While reviewing the 
research related to high school achievement, the present writer found 
that the emphasis was centered on the construction of the perfect pred¬ 
iction equation through an assessment of a great number of factors. An 
attempt has been made, and is still being made, to find and properly 
weight the many and varied factors influencing scholastic achievement. 

In this regard, Travers criticized much of the time and effort devoted 
to prediction studies, when he said: 

Second, it should be noted that a multitude of the studies 
under consideration are based on the belief that the main 
reason for the inadequacies of present prediction is that the 
tests do not adequately measure the factors within the indiv¬ 
idual which made for success,^ 2 

He further stressed that the viewpoint behind these studies needs 
to be examined, based as it is on the assumption that the individual’s 
own qualities are entirely responsible for his success and failure and 
that the person who has the right qualities, will inevitably succeed. 

In Travers’ opinion, this is an idealistic position to take, hardly 





t 








14 


justifiable in view of so many unplanned events, largely outside the 
domain of those that can be predicted from tests and other data avail- 

23 

able to the counselor. J 

In regard to counselors, it has been found that there is a wide 

range in their ability to predict success of students. Counselors were 

found to be more accurate in predicting for bright students than for 

dull students. They consistently under-estimated the school performance 

of the duller pupils, and overestimated school performance of the 

24 

brighter ones. 

In all toomany cases, the concern of past research appears to 
have been with the statistics of these studies, rather than with the 
students for whom the results of the studies should have provided guid¬ 
ance. There is growing criticism of this misplaced emphasis, and more 
attention is being directed to the guidance value of examinations and 
tests in relation to the student. McConn, reviewing all proposed ob¬ 
jectives of testing in schools, maintained that there is but one proper 
function of testing, namely, the guidance of the pupil being tested. 2 ^ 
Cronbach expressed the same point of view when he stated that, "Predic¬ 
tion is the ultimate justification for the achievement test used for 
„2 6 

grading in school. He further maintained that grading is warranted 
primarily because it predicts the pupil’s future ability in relation to 
some activity. Cronbach concluded that if the achievement test does not 
fulfil the predictive function, grading will likely not be worth the 
trouble it causes. 2 ^ 












? 














15 


The proper objective of prediction studies is the provision of 
information whereby students might make more intelligent and rewarding 
decisions# Fredericksen stressed the importance of this oftenneglected 
function when he stated: 

The longer I have tried to counsel students, the more I 
have been impressed with the lack of adequate information on 
which to base interpretation of test scores# Even when deal¬ 
ing with prediction of academic success, which has been studied 
more thoroughly than any other prediction problem, I often feel 
the handicap of a lack of useful information to give to the 
student sitting across from my desk who wants to know his chances 
of being successful in some academic undertaking* 2 ® 

Not only is there a demand for increased attention to making 
the results and findings of studies more meaningful, but consumers of 
research are demanding local validity studies# Dyer indicates the im¬ 
portance of validity studies by pointing out that the local situation 
always has features peculiar to itselfMcCabe reiterates the impor¬ 
tance of local validity studies; further he brings out an often neglected 
point when he emphasizes the presence of meaningful relationships which 
are useful in counselling, but which may not be revealed by the use of 
the correlation techniques #^ 0 Fredericksen also recommends local valid¬ 
ity studies and the publication of their results# A counselor would 
then be able to indicate to a student his chances of success in a 
particular program, and give the student advice that was justified by 
the findings of the particular study under consideration.^ He suggests 
that an author should compute the regression equation and error of 
estimate, and then present the results in the form of an expectancy 
table or a computing diagram*^ in this way, the results of the study 


would be most useful 









16 


Implications of the literature for the present study * In view 
of the literature on high school achievement, the present investigation 
has been organized so as to determine the guidance value of certain 
factors which are available for the counselling of the Grade IX grad¬ 
uate* An attempt has been made to present the findings in as meaning¬ 
ful and as useful a fashion as possible from the point of view of the 
guidance of the student* To achieve this aim, statistics have been the 
means rather than the end.

CHAPTER III 


METHOD AND DEFINITIONS 

Method of procedure . The guidance value of the selected 
factors was studied in relation to the matriculation program only, 
for two reasons. In the first place, large numbers of students are 
failing the matriculation program each year* for this reason guidance 
information is an immediate requirement in relation to this program 
in particular. Secondly, selection of the matriculation program proved 
to be a satisfactory method of delimiting a very broad problem. At 
the same time the number of students enrolled in this program was 
sufficiently large to make possible the drawing of reliable con¬ 
clusions. 

Sources of the data . All examination results and other data 
with which this study deals were obtained from the records on file 
with the Examinations® Branch of the Department of Education of the 
Province of Alberta* The following schools were included in this 
Composite High School study: Strathcona, Victoria, Eastglen, Lindsay 
Thurber, Western Canada, Crescent Heights, Lethbridge Collegiate and 
Alexandria Composite. 

The subjects of the study . The subjects of this study were 
Composite High School students who wrote at least six Grade XU external 
examinations (academic program) in June, 1957. Only such students were 
included in the study because matriculation success and failure were 










1 

















21 


the criteria and only such students were eligible for matriculation* 
Further, an attempt was made to eliminate the possible effects of 
retardation and temporary withdrawal on high school achievement* 

From this point of view, to be included in the study, students must 
have been in Grade IX in the school year 1953-5^• Thus, the subjects 
of this investigation were those students who progressed through the 
Senior High School grades in three years* Students, whose high school 
work was interrupted because they left school for a year or more after 
completing Grade IX, or because they repeated all or part of a grade, 
were automatically excluded from the study* The 553 students with 
whom this investigation deals do not then constitute a statistical 
sample of the Composite High School Students enrolled in the matric¬ 
ulation program* To all intents and purposes, they constitute the 
Composite High School population in this regard* 

The selection of guidance factors to be studied * In order to 
determine the factors to be selected for the purposes of this study, 
the student*s Grade IX permanent record card was examined. Many facts 
pertinent to the student and his educational progress are recorded on 
this card* The factors selected for this study included marks on 
Grade IX departmental examinations, standing in the Grade IX class, 
the number of honor points gained, the raw score on the Grade IX 
General Test of Learning Capacity, age, and sex* 

Marks on departmental examinations, class standing, and honor 
points gained were selected as measures of past achievement to be 
related to subsequent high school achievement* The student*s raw score 



/ 











% 


























22 


on tbe General Test was selected as a measure of potential learning 
capacity, and age and sex factors were included in order to determine 
any significant differences which might be attributable to these 
characteristics. 

Additional factors were available for use in the study but 
were discarded for various reasons. For example, scores on individual 
Grade XII external examinations were not considered as such, because 
the study is essentially concerned with the student*s general standing 
rather than his results on specific subjects. It was found that various 
types of I.Q. tests had been administered to most of the students. 
However, scores on these tests were not selected for use in this study 
because different tests had been administered to different groups of 
students at different times* Teachers® estimates of pupils® ability 
had also been recorded. These estimates were not considered for the 
purposes of this study because of their possible lack of objectivity. 1 
Trevor, writing on school marks, reported that such factors as actual 
attainment, teacher-pupil relationship, deportment, sex, promptness, 
attendance, personal appearance, obedience, effort and attitude had 

p 

been found to affect the marks which teachers assign their pupils. 

His results indicated a tendency for most-liked pupils to be marked 
higher than their accomplishment would justify, whereas the least-liked 
pupils were assigned marks lower than their actual attainment.3 

Definitions . Certain terms which are vital to a full under¬ 
standing of the investigation are here defined.

(a) Matriculation requirements: are those requirements which have 

k 

been established by the University of Alberta, Thus, to matri¬ 
culate, a student must possess a High School Diploma, a B or higher 
standing in the required courses of Grade XII, as set forth in 
the prescriptions of the various Schools and Faculties of the 
University, and an overall average of at least sixty per cent, 

(b) Pass student: for the purposes of this study indicates a student 
who was successful with the matriculation requirements, 

(c) Fail student: for the purposes of this study indicates a 
student who was unsuccessful in relation to one or more of the 
matriculation requirements. It is to be noted here that changes 
resulting from students 8 supplementary examinations were not con¬ 
sidered in this study; the results used were those originally 
obtained by the student* 

(d) Grade IX aggregate score: represents the sum of the scores 
obtained by a student on his Grade IX departmental examinations* 

(e) Grade IX General Test score: represents the raw score obtained by 
the student on the Dominion Group Test of Learning Capacity* This 
test was administered to all Grade IX students in 1954, while they 
wrote the departmental examinations* 

(f) Relative class standing: refers to the relative achievement of a 
Grade IX student, within his own school, on the basis of his 
achievement in that school during the school year 1953-54*

for each C classification they obtained in indication of their 
external examination results. The maximum number of honor points 
obtainable was twenty-four, on the basis of six external examin¬

CHAPTER IV 


STATISTICAL FINDINGS OF THE STUDY 

This section presents the statistical findings of the study 
and describes the methods by which the data were treated in determin¬ 
ing the relationship between the selected guidance factors and the 
criteria of matriculation success and failure. 

General Test findings . In June, 1954, the Dominion Group 
Test of Learning Capacity, Intermediate, 1950 Edition, Form B, the 
Alberta Edition, was administered to all Grade IX students in the 
Province of Alberta. This test was written along with the Grade IX 
departmental examinations. 

Table I shows the distribution of students® Grade IX General 
Test scores in relation to the students® subsequent matriculation 
success or failure. Of the 553 students with which this study deals, 
336 were successful in matriculating, while 217 failed. For the pass 
group of students, the General Test scores ranged from thirty-eight 
to seventy-three; for the fail group, scores on the General Test 
ranged from thirty to seventy-three. The mean raw score for the pass 
group was found to be 61 . 02 , while the mean raw score for the fail 
group was 55 . 89 . 

It might be well indicated here that the mean raw score for 
all Grade IX students who wrote the General Test in 1954 was 46.96 
with a standard deviation of 12.47*^ The mean raw score for the Com¬ 
posite High School group of this study was 59.01 with a standard

Students had been assigned scores on the General Test but 
had been classified only in two categories in relation to matricul¬ 
ation results. Therefore, to determine the relationship between these 
two factors, a bi-serial coefficient was established. The bi-serial 

coefficient may be interpreted in the same way as the product-moment 
2 

r * An r bis of ,4l and a crr^g of ,05 were obtained. Thus, a fairly 
substantial positive relationship was indicated, at the .01 level, 
between Grade IX General Test scores and the Grade XII criteria of 
matriculation success and failure. 

Grade IX aggregate score findings . Table II shows the dis¬ 
tribution of the students® aggregate scores on the Grade IX depart¬ 
mental examinations, in relation to their subsequent success and 
failure at the Grade XII level. The aggregate scores for the pass 
group ranged from 300 to 525; for the fail group, these scores ranged 
from 225 to 525. The mean aggregate score for the entire group was 
407,08 with a standard deviation of 53.25. This compared to the mean 
aggregate score of 425.99 for those who passed, and 375*94 for those 
students who failed. 

With a bi-serial coefficient of .58 and a standard deviation 
of *04, a fairly marked positive relationship was indicated between 
Grade IX aggregate scores on departmental examinations and the 
matriculation pass and fail criteria. This relationship was found 
to be significant at the .01 level.

Because both General Test scores and Grade IX aggregate scores 
on the departmental examinations were found to have a fairly marked 
positive relationship with the Grade XII criteria, the relationship 
between the General Test scores and the Grade IX aggregate scores 
was measured. As shown in Table III, the product-moment correlation 
coefficient was found to be .64. This coefficient indicated a sub¬ 
stantial positive relationship between these two factors, and thus 
partly explained their mutual relationship with the criteria. This 
relationship suggests the possibility of making use of the Grade IX 
General Test as a guide to Grade IX achievement. 

Relative class standing findings . Table IV pictures the 
relationship between the Grade IX class standing of the students and 
their subsequent matriculation success or failure. The chi-square 
test was used to compare the matriculation results with those which 
would have been expected in the absence of any real association be¬ 
tween relative class standing in Grade IX and subsequent matriculation 

q o 

success or failure. The data were accordingly computed,-’ and a X of 

73*9^ was obtained. With three degrees of freedom, a P of less than 

.01 was indicated. The null hypothesis could, therefore, be rejected, 

and a very marked relationship was seen to exist between the relative 

class standing of a Grade IX student and his subsequent success or 

failure in meeting matriculation requirements in Grade XII. To provide 

a measure of correlation the coefficient of contingency was computed 

on the basis of the value of the X • Testing the significance of C 

p 5 

on the basis of the significance of its equivalent X , the obtained 0 
of .35 was found to be very significant at the .01 level.

Age differences . Table V shows the relationship between the 
age of Grade IX students and their subsequent matriculation success or 
failure. The null hypothesis was tested in relation to the observed 
age differences in relation to the Grade XII criteria. With a X 2 of 
7*89 and three degrees of freedom, a slight relationship was indicated 
at the .05 level. Thus the obtained C of .10 was also considered of 
slight significance at the .05 level. Most of the students included 
in the study were found to be in the fourteen to fifteen year age 
group. Thirty-seven students were sixteen years of age and over, 
while twenty were less than fourteen years old. Of these twenty, who 
apparently had been accelerated at some point, seventy-five per cent 
passed the matriculation program. Of the thirty-seven over-age pupils, 
approximately fifty per cent succeeded with the program. 

Table VI, on page 35,shows a further test of the age differences 
as treated by a tetrachoric coefficient of correlation. The r^. was 
found to be .16 indicating the same slight relationship between the 
age of Grade IX students and their subsequent matriculation success 
and failure. 

Sex differences . Table VII, page 38, presents the sex 
differences as they relate to the criteria of success and failure. 

In order to determine the significance of the sex differences, the 
null hypothesis was tested. With a X^ of .24 and one degree of free¬ 
dom, a P of between .50 and .70 was obtained, indicating no significant 
relationship between the sex of a student and matriculation success or 
failure. The null hypothesis was retained. The obtained C of .02 was 


considered of no significance

Honor point findings . Table VIII indicates the relation¬ 
ship between the number of honor points obtained by Grade IX students 
and the students* subsequent matriculation success or failure* The 
null hypothesis was again used to test the significance of observed 
differences* With a X 2 of 104.87 and three degrees of freedom, P was 
found to be equal to less than *01. On this basis the null hypothesis 
was rejected. The relationship between honor points and the pass and 
fail criteria was considered very significant at less than the ,01 
level. Thus, the obtained C of .40 was also considered very sig¬ 
nificant at the .01 level. 

Other findings . In an analysis of the data, it was found 
that the group of students failing to meet matriculation requirements 
was largely composed of students who had failed one or more subjects* 
Such students made up eighty-eight per cent of the entire fail group. 
The remaining twelve per cent of the fail group were accounted for 
by those students who had obtained a B or higher standing in six 
academic subjects, but who had failed to gain an overall average of 
sixty per cent. 

Twenty-two per cent of the 217 students who were unsuccessful 
with the program had failed one subject; twenty-eight per cent had 
failed two; seventeen per cent had failed three, and twenty-one per 
cent had failed four subjects* Mathematics was by far the most trouble¬ 
some subject; sixty-six per cent of the entire fail group had failed 
this subject. The other subjects, in their order of apparent 
difficulty, were Chemistry, Physics, Social Studies, English and

In summary, fairly marked positive relationships were 
found between the criteria of matriculation success and failure 
and Grade IX General Test scores, departmental examination aggregate 
scores, relative class standing, and honor points. There were no 
significant differences between the number of boys and the number 
of girls passing and failing the matriculation program. Differences 
related to age were found to be slight and apparently negligible.

CHAPTER V 


THE GUIDANCE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FINDINGS 

To find and report the statistical relationship between 
matriculation success and failure and the selected guidance factors 
constituted but one aspect of this study. The basic objective was 
to determine, on the basis of the findings of the study, the guid¬ 
ance value of the selected factors, and to present this information 
in a meaningful way. The development of an objective foundation 
for counselling students contemplating enrollment in the academic 
program of a Composite High School was, therefore, the aim of this 
section of the study. 

Expectancy tables and their analysis . Table IX is an 
expectancy table based on the distribution of Grade IX General Test 
scores. This table shows the percentages of matriculation passes 
and failures to be expected on the basis of the observed results 
of this study in relation to General Test scores. It can be seen 
from this table that of the twenty-six students who scored between 
seventy and seventy-three on the Grade IX General Test, twenty went 
on to matriculate successfully, while six failed. In other words, 
seventy-seven per cent of the group passed and twenty-three per cent 
failed. It might be said, therefore, that students scoring between 
seventy and seventy-three in the future will, in most cases, be 
successful with the matriculation program. Similarly, those students 
scoring from sixty-six to sixty-nine, may reasonably be expected to

pass the program* Subsequent entries in this table can be read in 
the same way* As one proceeds from the higher to the lower General 
Test scores, the percentage of pupils passing decreases, while the 
percentage of pupils failing increases. 

Figure 1 consolidates the information pictured in Table IX 
by setting up wider intervals of General Test scores. This figure 
presents four significantly distinct groups of students in relation 
to their varying percentages of expected matriculation passes and 
failures* This type of grouping is desirable because the larger 
frequencies in each interval make possible a greater degree of con¬ 
fidence in the guidance which might be based on such information. 

From this figure it can be seen that of the students who scored 
sixty-six or more on the General Test, only seventeen per cent 
subsequently failed to meet matriculation requirements* It can 
be said, therefore, that students scoring in this range in the 
future have an excellent chance of passing a matriculation program. 
Further, it may be said that students who score from fifty-four to 
sixty-five have a fair chance of passing the program. However, 
students who score fifty-three or less are more likely to fail than 
pass* Students scoring not more than thirty-seven have apparently 
a very slim chance of passing a matriculation program. 

Table X, page 4;>, is another expectancy table based on the 
distribution of Grade IX aggregate scores on external examinations. 

This table shows the percentages of matriculation passes and failures to 
be expected on the basis of the observed results of this study in

relation to Grade IX aggregate scores. Of the nineteen pupils making 
an aggregate score of 500 or more, seventeen passed while two failed. 
Thus eighty-nine per cent of the students scoring in this interval 
passed and eleven per cent failed. On this basis it might be said 
that an extremely large percentage of the students making similar 
scores in the future, can be expected to pass the matriculation pro¬ 
gram. Subsequent entries in this table can be read in the same way. 
As one proceeds from the higher to the lower aggregate scores, the 
percentage of students passing decreases, while the percentage of 
students failing increases. It is very interesting to note that 
of the nineteen students making a Grade IX aggregate score of 500 
and above, seventeen passed while two failed; this is equal to an 
eighty-nine per cent pass record. Thirty-eight students made an 
aggregate score of from 475 to 499 j thirty-seven of these passed 
while one failed. This is equal to a ninety-seven per cent pass 
record, nine per cent better than that of the top group who scored 
500 and above. 

Figure 2 consolidates the information portrayed in 
Table X by setting up wider intervals of Grade IX aggregate 
scores. This figure presents five significantly distinct groups 
of students in relation to their varying percentages of expected 
matriculation passes and failures. On the basis of this figure, it 
may be said that students scoring 450 or more on the Grade DC depart¬ 
mental examinations have an excellent chance of passing the matri¬ 
culation program. Only twelve per cent of the students who so scored 
subsequently failed. Students scoring from 400 to 449 can be said to

Percentages of expected matriculation passes and failures of five significantly distinct

Examinations* 
















































have a very good chance of meeting matriculation requirements, while 
students scoring from 300 to 399 are more likely to fail than pass. 

Of the few students who had an aggregate score of less than 300 on 
the Grade IX departmental examinations, all failed the matriculation 
program. Students making an aggregate score of not more than 324 
apparently have very little chance of passing such a program. 

Table XI shows the probable chances of success or failure 
of Composite High School students in relation to their relative 
class standing in Grade IX. Of the 385 students who placed in the 
top quarter of their respective Grade IX classes, 279 passed, while 
106 failed the matriculation program. On this basis, it might be 
said that most of the students similarly placing in the future can 
be expected to pass the matriculation program. As one proceeds from 
the top to the bottom quarter of the class, the percentage of students 
passing consistently decreases while the percentage of students fail¬ 
ing sharply increases. 

Figure 3, page 50, consolidates the information pictured 
in Table XI into two significantly distinct groups of students in 
relation to their chances of matriculation success or failure on 
the basis of relative class standing. The first group is composed 
of those who finished in the top quarter of their respective Grade IX 
classes, and the second group is made up of students who placed in 
all other quarters. Students placing in the top quarter of their 
respective classes are seen to have a very good chance of success¬ 
fully meeting matriculation requirements; specifically about 73 per

cent of such students might be expected to pass the program. All 
students who place below the top quarter of their class apparently 
have a poor chance of passing the matriculation program. Only about 
34 per cent of the students who so place can be expected to succeed 
with the program. On this basis it might be said that to have a 
good chance of successfully completing the matriculation program, 
a student must place in the top quarter of his Grade IX class. 

Table XII is based on the relationship between the number 
of honor points gained by a Grade IX student and his subsequent 
matriculation success or failure. This table shows the percentages 
of matriculation passes and failures to be expected on the basis 
of the observed results of this study in relation to the number of 
honor points obtained by students. The majority of students in 
this study gained from fifteen to twenty-four honor points. Of the 
264 students who gained twenty or more honor points, 215 passed while 
49 failed the matriculation program* As one proceeds from the 
greater to the lesser number of honor points gained, the percentage 
of pupils passing decreases markedly while the percentage of pupils 
failing increases to a correspondingly sharp degree. 

Figure 4, page 53 , consolidates the information contained 
in Table XII into three significantly distinct groups in relation 
to students* chances of matriculation success and failure on the 
basis of honor points gained. Thus, on the basis of this figure, 
students who merit from twenty to twenty-four honor points, the 
equivalent of at least five H’s, might be said to have an excellent

chance of passing the matriculation program. Those who score from 
fifteen to nineteen honor points have about equal chances of passing 
and failing. Students who score less than fifteen honor points 
apparently have a very poor chance of meeting the Grade XII matri¬ 
culation requirements. 

The feasibility of establishing critical scores . At this 
point, the effects, and hence the advisibility, of establishing 
critical or cut-off scores in relation to entry into the matri¬ 
culation program are examined. For this purpose, the critical 
scores used have been established on the basis of the information 
contained in this study. Critical scores are generally used in 
selection procedures. It is assumed, for the moment, that it might 
be desirable to select students for enrollment in the matriculation 
program. Following this assumption, it is suggested that students 
might well be advised on the same basis as that on which they 
would be selected. Information which appears to be useful in the 
hypothetical selection procedure would, therefore, be valuable 
from a guidance point of view. The objective in establishing a 
critical score is to locate an optimum point. This is the point 
at which a maximum number of students who would pass, and a minimum 
number of students who would fail, would be accepted for a particular 
program, in this case the matriculation program. 

Figure 5 shows the effects of five different critical 
scores in relation to the General Test results. If the high score 
of fifty-four had been established as the critical General Test

score, then 295 students or eighty-eight per cent of the group who 
actually passed the program would have been accepted in the program, 
while twelve per cent who actually pasBed, would have been rejected. 
This rejection of twelve per cent of the students who could have 
actually passed the program would be unacceptable to many who might 
maintain that no student who could have passed should be sacrificed 
in the selection procedure. On the other hand, the same critical 
score would have resulted in the rejection of thirty-five per cent 
of those students who actually failed the program. To determine 
the optimum point, the critical score was lowered to fifty, then 
forty-six, forty-two, and finally thirty-eight. As the critical 
score was thus lowered, the percentage of the pass students who 
would have been rejected was consistently being lowered; this 
feature was desirable. At the same time, however, the percentage 
of the fail group of students who would have been accepted was being 
increased; this was undesirable. If on the one hand a critical 
score of thirty-eight is looked upon as successful because at this 
point 100 per cent of those students who passed would have been 
accepted, it might well be termed inefficient on the other, because 
only five students or two per cent of those who failed would have 
been rejected from the program. 

Figure 6 shows the effects of five cut-off scores in 
relation to Grade IX aggregate scores on external examinations. 

A critical score of 400 appears to be quite efficient; it approx¬ 
imately reverses the percentages of pass and fail students, accepted

and rejected* Seventy-one per cent of the pass group would have 
been accepted and seventy-five per cent of the fail group would 
have been rejected. A critical score of 325 would have resulted 
in the acceptance into the matriculation program of ninety-nine 
per cent of those students who actually passed, and in the rej¬ 
ection of sixteen per cent of those students who failed. Further, 
to include 100 per cent of the pass group in the program it would 
be necessary to set the critical score at 300 , at which point 
ninety-five per cent of the fail group would have been accepted. 

Figure 7 pictures the results of four critical scores 
or quarters in relation to relative Grade IX class standing. 

When the top quarter was established as the cut-off quarter, the 
results appeared to be fairly efficient. At this point, eighty- 
three per cent of the pass group would have been accepted, while 
fifty-one per cent of the fail group would have been rejected. 

To include 100 per cent of the pass group, the bottom quarter 
must be used as the critical score. At this point, however, one 
hundred per cent of the fail group would also have been included 
for selection in the matriculation program. 

Figure 8, page 60,presents the results of four critical 
scores in relation to the number of honor points gained by a 
Grade IX student. Using a critical score of fifteen honor points, 
ninety-eight per cent of the pass group would have been included 
in the program whereas sixteen per cent of the fail group would 
have been rejected. To select 100 per cent of the pass group the

critical score must be set at five honor points; at this point, 

100 per cent of the fail group of students would also have been 
included in the selection for the program* 

The major problem associated with the determination of 
critical scores is evident upon examination of the last four 
figures. As the critical score is altered so as to select a 
larger proportion of those students who would pass, the number of 
students selected, who would eventually fail, is simultaneously 
increased* Upon analysis of the effects of the preceding critical 
scores in Figures 5, page 55, Figure 6, page 57, Figure 7, page 59, 
and Figure 8, page 60, it was concluded that a selection procedure 
based on such scores would not be satisfactory. 

Basis of guidance information at the Grade IX level * 
Students completing Grade IX can be reliably advised as to their 
chances of succeeding with a matriculation program in Composite 
High Schools. Grade IX General Test scores, aggregate scores on 
Grade IX departmental examinations, relative class standing in 
Grade IX, and honor points gained provide a sound basis for this 
advice. Such students® chances of success can be indicated by 
considering each of these guidance factors individually. However, 
considering them simultaneously, increases the reliability of the 
guidance. This point is illustrated in Tables IX, page k2, X, page 
^5, XI, page 49, and XII, page 52. Thus, students scoring 66 or 
more on the General Test were said to have a good chance of 
succeeding with the matriculation program. Nevertheless, 21 of

the students so scoring failed. Similarly, students making an 
aggregate score of 450 or more were said to have a good chance of 
passing the program. Sixteen of these students failed. Students 
gaining 20 or more honor points were also said to have a good 
chance of passing, but 49 of such students failed. Students 
placing in the top quarter of their Grade IX class were said to 
have a good chance of passing the program* Of such students, how¬ 
ever, 106 subsequently failed the matriculation program. Some 
students, then, whose chances of success appeared to be good on 
the basis of individual guidance factors, went on to fail the 
program. Specifically, advising the students of this study to 
enroll in the matriculation program on the basis of individual 
factors, could have resulted in the failure of from 16 to 106 
students. Guiding students on the basis of a single guidance 
factor is, then, not sufficiently reliable. This possible result 
was compared with that effected by considering the guidance 
factors of this study simultaneously. Thus, a student scoring 
66 or more on the General Test, making an aggregate score of 450 
or more, placing in the top quarter of his class, and gaining 20 
or more honor points could be very reliably advised that he has 
an excellent chance of successfully completing the matriculation 
program* In fact, only five students who met these qualifications 
subsequently failed the program. 

It can be said, therefore, that more reliable guidance 
is provided for prospective matriculation students when the guidance 
is based on a number of factors rather than on a single guidance 


factor

CHAPTER VI 


SUMMARY AMD CONCLUSIONS 

Summary of the findings : 

1. A substantial positive relationship was found between: 

(a) Grade IX General Test scores and subsequent matri¬ 
culation success and failure, and 

(b) Grade IX aggregate scores on departmental examinations 
and subsequent matriculation success and failure; 

2. A very significant relationship was found between: 

(a) relative class standing in Grade IX and subsequent 
matriculation success and failure, and 

(b) the number of honor points gained by a Grade IX 
student and subsequent matriculation success and 
failure; 

3* A substantial positive relationship was found between 

Grade IX General Test scores and Grade IX aggregate scores 
on departmental examinations; 

4 . A significant, though slight, relationship was found, at the 
.05 level, between a student’s age in Grade LX and subsequent 
matriculation success and failure; 

5. No significant relationship was found between sex and matri¬ 

culation success and failure; 

6. Eighty-eight per cent of the 217 students who failed to 
achieve matriculation standing did so because they did not

attain at least a B standing in one or more subjects. 

Twelve per cent failed because they did not obtain the 
overall average of sixty per cent, in spite of the fact 
that they passed all subjects. 

7# More students failed Mathematics 30 than any other Grade 

XII subject. Sixty-six per cent of the students who failed 
to achieve matriculation standing were unsuccessful with 
this subject. 

Conclusions . The findings of this study indicate that 
General Test scores, aggregate scores on departmental examinations, 
relative class standing, and honor points gained provide useful 
information for counselling Grade IX students. On the basis of 
a student 4 s results on each of these four factors, he can be 
reliably advised on his chances of success in a matriculation 
program. 

Among the four factors mentioned above, relative class 
standing seemed to be the most efficient single predictor of 
matriculation success. On the basis of this one factor alone, 
a sharp differentiation can be made between those students likely 
to pass and those likely to fail. This conclusion is similar to 
a finding at the college level by Williams and McQuary who re¬ 
ported that rank in high school was the best single predictor 
of college success. 3 * 

Some of the students studied in this investigation had 
good Grade IX records but subsequently failed the matriculation

program, while others with poor Grade IX records matriculated 
successfully. Apparently factors other than those studied in 
this thesis were responsible for the success or failure of these 
students. It could be reasonably assumed that the absence or 
presence of motivation may have been the deciding factor. Thus 
the importance of motivation must not be underestimated when 
counselling Grade IX students. 

Recommendation, for further study . The findings of 
this investigation indicate that it is possible to advise Grade IX 
students as to their chances of success in a matriculation program 
in Composite High Schools. However, some students do not conform 
to the usual pattern. In this study, for example, two of the 
nineteen students who made Grade IX aggregate scores of five 
hundred or more (v.Table X, page 45), failed to matriculate. 

Future study of such exceptions might reveal their distinguishing 
characteristics and thus make possible the isolation and sub¬ 
sequent guidance of these students.
