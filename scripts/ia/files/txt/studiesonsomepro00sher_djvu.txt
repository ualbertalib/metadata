STUDIES OH SOME PROPERTIES OF ALBERTA

General Introduction 

In carrying out the investigations which are reported in 
this thesis two main objectives have been pursued* The first of these 
has been the examination by graphical means of a considerable body of 
hitherto unpublished data on Alberta coals* Relationships such as have 
been established by other workers for European and American coals have 
been applied to Alberta coals* with the result that it is now possible 
to state with some degree of accuracy respects in which Alberta 
coals resemble, and those in which they differ from, coals in other 
parts of the world* In addition, new relationships have been found 
which throw fresh light on the process of coalification* Again, these 
studies, to which the happy epithet “Goal Systematical has been applied, 
have been used as the basis for a discussion on the classification of 
coal which attempts to reconcile some of the differences between var¬ 
ious systems of classification in present use, and leads to a new 
system particularly adapted to Alberta coals, but probably of general 
utility* 

Secondly, consideration of such data, together with recent 
developments revealed by the examination of the ultra-fine structures 
of coals and cokes, and an inquiry into the state of existing knowledge 
of the processes of lignification, humification and coalification, has 
led to the development of certain theoretical considerations which 
attempt to relate and combine such diverse fields of knowledge* Though 
difficult of verification, this theoretical development has naturally 
led to attempts to determine the extent to which it is true, and it is 
with these attempts that the second and third parts of this thesis will 


be concerned,

These investigations fall under two headingso Part two of 

this work is concerned with the measurement of the reflectivity of coals 

/oAysics 

(a comparatively new development in the field of coal ghomaio-tffy), a 
means of investigation which promises the greatest utility* In addition 
to the measurement of the reflectivity of polished blocks, which has 
been carried out also by other workers, the measurement of the reflect¬ 
ivity of powder samples has been attempted, and this has naturally led 
to a consideration of the relation between powder reflectivity and 
that of a polished block# Part three is devoted to the report on 
measurements: of density# Such measurements have often been made before, 

<5>iben 

but until now these efforts have be©ny(unguid©d by theoretical consid¬ 
erations# 

Although the actual course of this investigation has followed 
the familiar pattern, fact - theory - experiment - modification of 
theory, it has been found convenient to exclude theoretical discussion 
from the experimental part of this work, and for this reason such dis¬ 
cussion has been reserved for the conclusion# 

Only such problems as are immediately raised by the exper¬ 
imental data have been treated in the discussion section of the separate 
parts# The general discussion which forms the conclusion of this work 
will serve to relate and epitomize the preceding sections*

Note on the Geology of the Coal Areas of Alberta♦ 

Coal-bearing formations underlie most of the southern half 
of the Province and occur both in the plains and in the foothills of 
the Rocky Mountains# The coal formations which are distinguished, are 
the Blair more-Kootenay and the Luscar of Lower Cretaceous age, the 
Foremost, the Oldman and the Edmonton of Upper Cretaceous age, the 
two former constituting the Belly River Series, and minor Tertiary 
deposits of Paleocene age# In the earliest periods of coal formation, 
vegetation accumulated in swamps as deposits confined within a broad 
shallow basin which trended in a north-westerly direction and extended 
from north-east British Columbia, south-east into the United States# 
Conditions favourable to coal formation were intermittent and limited 
and the areas in which coal formed was different over various periods# 
During the general rise of this part of the North American Continent, 
there were periods of quiescence, recession and submergence, and de¬ 
position of fresh water sediments and marine shales occurred locally# 

The coal seams of Lower Cretaceous age are separated in places by a 
thick series of coarse sands and conglomerate# The deposits develop 
to the greatest extent in th© mountain districtss beneath the plains 
they are deeply buried and the seams are thin and inferior in quality# 
Again, between the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Cretaceous coal formations 
is a great thickness of marine shales# In the Upper Cretaceous form¬ 
ations, in eastern areas, a thin series of marine sediments separate 
the Oldman from the Edmonton formation above it# 

In certain areas in the foothills, the Upper Cretaceous de¬ 
posits are not so well developed or so continuous as those of Lower

Cretaceous age which occur in the mountain regions and they cannot be 
readily divided into the individual formations# As the land rose in 
the east and the Rocky Mountain uplift occurred in the west in early 
Tertiary time, the large structural basin of the Alberta syncline was 
formed with the youngest formations in the centre of the basin and the 
progressively-older formations on the outer rim# Erosion and denud¬ 
ation resulted in the removal of the Edmonton formation in certain 
areas in the central plains and in a thick covering of sediment laid 
down from the Rocky Mountains in the west* From the standpoint of 
metamorphism, the most outstanding feature of the coal formations of 
western Canada as a whole is the effect which the mountain-building 
forces have exerted on the degree of maturity of the coals* The rank 
of the coal does not conform to its geological age; coals occurring 
in the foothills are more mature than coals which are geologically 
older but further removed from the mountains, and at the northern and 
southern extremities of the Alberta syncline, where the deposits of 
the plains are closest to the mountains, the coals are of higher rank 
than coals of the same geological age which, being more distant, have 
been less influenced by the dynamic stresses developed during the 
mountain-building period* That the coals increase progressively in 
rank from the east to the west of the province must not, however, b© 
applied too rigidly, for some variations may occur in the maturity of 
the coals occurring in relatively restricted areas, and particularly 
so in more mountainous regions where faulting and folding of the seams 
have been extreme* As far as seam correlation is concerned, this has 
been possible in certain localities in the plains where rivers have

exposed complete series of seams along the banks of the valleys, but 
elsewhere, and especially in the foothills and mountainous regions, 
owing to the partially explored nature of the territory, the wooded 
character of the foothills, the absence of rock exposures except along 
the river valleys and the highly-faulted and folded nature of the strata, 
any satisfactory correlation of the coal seams over extensive areas has 
proved difficult* 

For more detailed and precise information on the geology of 
tli© coal-bearing formations of Western Canada reference should be mads

inion Government of Canada in Be-eomber to the appropriate Reports 

of the Research Council of Alberta by J# A* Allan, R. L» Rutherford, 
et# alP^, to Reports of the Geological Survey of the Department of Mines 
and Resources of OanadJ^, and to many papers which have appeared in 
the technical literature on the geology of the region# A geological

GRAPHICAL STUDIES OH THE PROPERTIES

Introduction 

Over a period of about twenty years a considerable body of 
analytical data pertaining to the coals of Alberta has been accumulated 
in the files of the Research Council of Alberta® These data, hitherto 
unpublished in any considerable detail, consist of proximate and ult¬ 
imate analyses on channel samples of coal from the major coal areas 
of the Province* The samples are representative of coals covering a 
wide range of rank# It is with the examination of this body of inform¬ 
ation, by graphical methods already familiar to workers in the field 
of coal chemistry, that this section will be concerned© 

From a purely scientific as distinct from the strictly util¬ 
itarian point of view, the analysis of coal samples may be thought to 
have two major purposes# Firstly, analytical data may provide some 
information about th© ultimate nature of the coal substances secondly 
analytical data my be used for the classification of coals# That these 
ends are ultimately identical will be obvious, since any truly scient¬ 
ific classification of coal must distinguish its species on the basis 
of real differences in the ultimate structure of coals© In practice, 
too, we may most profitably start in our pursuit of both ends by the 
same means# The relations between the various properties of coal and 
its precursors is a necessary first subject of study, to be followed 
by some consideration of the changes which occur in these properties: 
as the humic and other materials from which coals are formed mature, 
through the lignitous and bituminous stages, to the anthracites which 
my be regarded as the end-product of metamorphosis#

It will be neither practicable nor profitable to attempt 
to give a detailed account of all the graphical studies made by other 
workers# A brief survey, together with a fuller account of the more 
recent work, is to be preferred, since this will present what are 

considered to be the more important features to be emphasised* 

(4) 

Grout, in 1907, graphed ultimate analyses (calculated 
to the basis of carbon plus hydrogen plus oxygen equals one hundred 
percent) on a triaxial diagram# He found that points representing 
the natural series, wood to anthracite, formed a narrow band on the 
diagram* He showed that lines could be drawn on this diagram to 
separate coals of similar calorific value* This treatment was system¬ 
atically extended by Ralston^ 5 ) in 1915, by the location of isocal- 
orifio and isovolatile lines on the ultimate analysis diagram* These 
methods have also been applied to British coals by Drake ley and Smith^^, 
while Hickling(^) has continued such work with United States coals;® 

Such triaxial diagrams, or biaxial representations of carbon 
and hydrogen content (which suffice, since carbon + hydrogen + oxygen 
with nitrogen and sulphur equal 100 per cent#), have been used as a 
basis for systems of classification, though the earlier classifiers^ 
were content to give limits of carbon and hydrogen content, of volatile 
matter and calorific value, in tabular form. Seyier,^®' in particular, 
used a carbon/hydrogen diagram in his classification, assigning his 
species to carbon and hydrogen planes® The super-imposition of iso¬ 
volatile and isocalorifio lines on the diagram allow the assignment 
of limits of these properties to the species®

Such diagrams, then, serve to represent and relate several 
important properties of coals* Not only may ultimate and proximate 
analyses and calorific value be related by them, but also such prop¬ 
erties as carbon/kydrogen ratios*which have been used by Seyler 
and by others when considering high rank coals* Any classification 
which uses ultimate or proximate analyses can be related to such a 
diagram: for example, Seyler (^2) has related his own classification 
with those of Parr ^ and Ralstonby this means* Rose has 

compiled “multibasic coal charts" for this purpose* 

The fact that isocalorific lines may be superimposed upon 
a carbon/hydrogen diagram implies that the calorific value may be 
calculated from the ultimate composition* Various formulae have been 
used for this purpose, of which the Dulong formula is perhaps the best 
known, namely 

Gross calorific value, B.t.u. per pound, dry, m.-nu-free basis s 


14,5440 + 62,028(H-^) + 4.050S ... (i) 

This formula is not, however, satisfactory for low rank coals* Perhaps 

(15) 

the most accurate equation yet devised is that given by Mott, namely 

e.t.u./a. , ? 

Oala - pfer g . - [80.3C + 339H - (36.6 - 0.172 0)OjX/'.§. (ii) 


This author points out that, where both ultimate composition 
and calorific value are available, the identity of the observed and 
calculated calorific values within reasonable limits serves as a useful 
check on the accuracy of both determinations* 

The volatile matter, too, may be expressed as a function of 
the ultimte composition* Both Seyler and Mott 1 ^ 15 ) have given 




; >ti 


r

formulae for its calculation, that of Seyler being, 

V(dry, m.-ra.-free) 3 10.61H - 1.24C + 84.15 ....(iii) 

while Mott gives 

V(dry, m.-m.-free) = 12.6H + 1.15 0 + 0.005 Q ? " - 41.8 .......... (iv) 


It must be emphasized that these formulae apply accurately only to 
bright coals. 

In this connection Seyler ) has introduced a most important 
concept, in the “volatile displacement 1 *, usually written as £v* This 
quantity expresses the difference between the observed and calculated 
volatile matter. Most coals show a banded structure with bright coal 
("vitrain”) intersperesed with harder, dull coal (“durain”)* Closer 
examination, as has been applied by Stopes and Wheeler (whose 
nomenclature I adopt), reveals the presence of a number of components 
(“macerals”), of which the most important are vitrinite, fusinite, and 
exinite. Seyler has shown that the presence of fusinite and/or exinite 
increases the volatile displacement* Since fusinite contains less 
hydrogen than vitrinite, and exinite more, and since the hydrogen con¬ 
tent and volatile displacement for pure fusinite, exinite and vitrinite 
are constant within certain limits for bituminous coals, it is possible 
to construct on a basis of hydrogen and volatile displacement a triang¬ 
ular diagram representing the proportion of these three components® 
Thus, given the ultimate and proximate analyses of a coal, we may 
predict within reasonable limits its petrological composition. 

Thus far we have not taken into account the mineral matter 
and moisture which occur in coals. In general, analyses are expressed

on a dry, mineral-matter-free basis when using them for graphical 
purposes# For bringing coal analyses to this basis, the satisfactory 
empirical formula of Parr has been generally accepted# That is, for 
example 

Dry m.-m.free carbon percent ® __A QQP_ _(v), 

100 - (M + 1.08A + 0.55S) 

where M = moisture percent, 

A = ash percent, 

S s sulphur percent. 

Some workers, however, have preferred a moist, mineral-matter-free basis 
for the expression of certain quantities, especially the calorific value. 
For low rank coals th© moisture content is an important quantity, and 
the use of a moist basis brings this quantity under consideration# It 
appears that the moisture content of low rank coals must b© taken into 
account in their classification# Since this quantity is dependent on 
the humidity of the air, Stansfield and Gilbart v 1 have worked out a 
means of determining the moisture content at 100 percent, humidity. 

The moisture content of coals is a property which may also 
be separately graphed against 'other coal properties# No very great 

(19) 

amount of work has been devoted to this subject hitherto# Dunningham 
has determined some moisture contents, and has plotted them against 
rank, as indicated by the carbon content# He obtains a band, the 
moisture descending with increasing rank to a minimum in the bituminous 
range, and rising again for the anthracites. However it may be doubted 
whether Dunningham 1 s method of determination, which purports to give 
values for saturated coals, entirely eliminates the purely mechanically 
admixed water, Mott^^ has also given a plot of moisture content (at 












- 12 


undetermined humidity) against oxygen content, obtaining a band similar 
to that of Dunningham® 

In conclusion, it may be mentioned that the coking properties 

(15 ) 

of coals have also been related to their ultimate analyses* Mott' 1 
in particular has given formulae, and has shown relationships between 
the various methods used to assess the coking power* However, since 
no data are available for the coals of this Province with respect to 
their coking properties, beyond a simple classification as coking or 
non-coking on the basis of the residue from the volatile matter test, 
this subject need not be considered in detail®

Graphical Studies 


Data ? 

These consist of approximately 900 proximate analyses 
(moisture, ash, volatile matter and fixed carbon) together with measure¬ 
ments of calorific value, on samples of Alberta coals taken over the 
entire range of the Upper and Lower Cretaceous measures* Volatile 
matter contents have been determined by standard A*S*T*M* procedures, 
in general the slow-heating method being used for non-agglomerating 
coals containing in excess of 10 per cent of moisture, and the quick 
heating method for coals with moisture contents below this amount* 

It has been shown by Mott and Spoonerthat values obtained by 
these methods are comparable with those obtained by British Standard 
methods* 

In addition, ultimate analyses have been carried out on 
approximately 350 of these samples* Determinations made are carbon 
and hydrogen content, in most cases sulphur content, and In many, 
nitrogen content* It is with these ultimate analyses that we shall 
be mainly concerned* 

Measurement of moisture content has in all cases been mad© 
on coals “as received”, but in addition to this it has been customary 
since 1932 to determine the “capacity” moisture content of most coal 
samples received by the method of Stansfield and Gilbart^®^ This 
quantity is determined by standing the coal sample over saturated pot¬ 
assium sulphate solution until saturated, and subsequently drying at 
105°C. in vacuo* The value thus obtained gives the moisture content 
at 98*6?£ humidity, and the “capacity" moisture is readily obtained by

dividing this value by a factor of 0*986. Such results are in accord 
with values obtained by the more laborious method of extrapolation of 
moisture/iiuinidity curves. 

Ash Correction : 

Hitherto the results of analyses have been expressed in the 
files only on an **as received* 1 and on a dry basis. The 350 ultimate 
and proximate analyses and calorific values as they were given, on 
the dry basis, are shown in Appendix I, together with the capacity 
moisture on a moist basis wherever this was determined. These values 
(including capacity moisture) were recalculated to a dry, mineral** 
matter-free (Parr) basis by means of the Parr formula (v). This 
formula may be simplified for Alberta coals to the form 

X dry, m.-m.-free 33 _ _ .•••••••••••. (vi) 

100 - 1,1 A 

where X is carbon, hydrogen content etc., and A the ash content. This 
simplification is allowed by the fact that the sulphur content of 
Alberta coals is remarkably constant® In addition, the S00 proximate 
analyses and calorific values were calculated to this basis, but are 
not listed here. The 350 proximate and corresponding ultimate analyses 
are listed on the Parr basis in Appendix II.

However, in some cases the analyses may be more widely in error 
especially for coals containing high ash contents. For this reason 
it is desirable to have some check upon the accuracy of the various 
determinations. Mott(^) has proposed the use of the difference 
between observed calorific value (perhaps the most accurate of the 
determinations) and that calculated by means of his formula 0 (ii). 

A maximum difference, which we have called of ± 100 B.t.u. has 

been suggested by him as a limit to be set in judging the acceptability 
of any analysis* However, an inspection of the limits of accuracy 
for the determination of carbon and hydrogen expressed above, together 
with consideration of the fact that the cumulative error of all deter¬ 
minations is expressed in the oxygen content, suffices to show that 
this limit must be extended somewhat. In actual fact, Mott has used 
analyses for which 5 Q had the limits 1 200 B.t.u., and this limit has 
been taken as satisfactory. Values for the calorific value have been 
calculated for the 350 Alberta coals using the formula

and are expressed, together with the quantity &Q, in Appendix II. Yfhere 
the sulphur and/or nitrogen content was not determined, it was found 
to be possible to assume values of 0.5 and 1.5 per cent, respectively, 
and thus to find the oxygen content. Where such an assumption has been

made the figures have been enclosed in parentheses, as have all quant¬ 
ities calculated from them* 

In order to determine the validity of Mott’s formula for 
Alberta coals, Gaussian distribution curves, or rather histograms, 
were prepared showing the number of analyses with values of &Q within 
the 100 B*t.u* limits* The three series of coals, Edmonton, Belly 
River, and Blairmore-Kootenay were treated separately, and the result 
is shown in Figure 2.* The peak of the curve will be seen to be dis® 
placed further from zero £q with increasing rank* 

Thus: 

(a) for Blairmore-Kootenay and Luscar coals, S Q is approximately 
+ 100 Bot*u* (the arithmetic mean value is + 114 B«t*u*) 

(b) for Belly River coals, 5 q is approximately + 50 B«t«u* 
(Arithmetic mean, + 51 B*t*u.) 

(c) for Edmonton coals. So. is approximately + 25 B*t*u* (Arith¬ 
metic mean + 12 B*t*u*) 

Thus, although Mott’s formula and limits may be said to apply 
very well to low rank Alberta coals, some small modification must be 
made in the limits chosen when dealing with the higher rank coals* 

Also, we may say that, since the calorific value of a coal must be the 
sum of the heats of combustion of its elements, together with its heat 
of formation, and since the former value is the same for coals of the 
same composition, the coals of Alberta, as they increase in rank, tend 
to posess a smaller heat of formation than average (that is to say, than 
the average value possessed by comparable coals which. Mott has studied)*

Plots of Proximate and Ultimate Analyses : 

In Figure 3 the volatile matter contents of approximately 
900 samples of Alberta coals are plotted against gross calorific values* 
For purposes of comparison with the "coal band" so obtained, the band 
for American coals given by Mott^^ has been drawn in between broken 
lines* It will be noted that the band for Alberta coals is displaced 
from that for the American coals for calorific values above 15,000 
B*t*u* by 200 B*t*u*, while in the region 12,250 to 14,000 B*t*u« the 
band assumes a wave-like form, the trough corresponding to a mean dev¬ 
iation from Mott*s band of 4 percent* of volatile matter* 

In Figure 4 are plotted the determined carbon and hydrogen 
contents, on the Parr basis, of 350 Alberta coals# When the coal band 
so obtained is compared with that for American coals (broken lines), 
displacements of the band comparable to those displayed by Figure 3 
will again be observed* This displacement amounts to a mean value of 
approximately 0*5 per cent* of carbon for high rank coals, whilst in 
the region of the less mature coals there is a mean displacement of 
approximately 0*2 per cent, of hydrogen* 

The shape of the coal band in Figure 3 in the region 14,800 
B*t*u* and over may be accounted for in part (though not wholly, as 
has been formerly state ^) by the displacement of the observed from 
the calculated calorific value in this region, already reported. That 
this displacement cannot entirely account for the shape of the coal 
band my be seen from the fact that a comparable deviation also occurs 
in the carbon/hydrogen plot. Figure 4*

Volatile Displacement : 

The treatment of the analytical data presented here has been 
considerably influenced by the paper of Mott^ often referred to 
heretofore, since a comparison of these data with the large number 
of analyses with which that author lias dealt was thought to be desir¬ 
able* In consequence, Mott’s formula (iv) for the calculation of 
volatile matter (and hence volatile displacement) has been used* This 
unf or tuna ta1y makes impossible, without a great deal of extremely lab¬ 
orious recalculation, an accurate comparison of the data for Alberta 
coals with that of Seyler, the originator of this most valuable con¬ 
cept of volatile displacement* However, the differences between 
volatile displacements calculated by means of Seyler ? s (iii) and by 
Mott’s (iv) formulae are not great enough to invalidate the results; 
obtained by the use of the latter® 

The volatile matter of Alberta coals whose ultimate analyses 
are known has been calculated using the formula already referred tos 

V s 12.6H + 1*15 0 + 0*005 0 2 - 41*8 .. (iv). 

* 

The determined volatile matter, subtracted from this figure, gives, 
the volatile displacement* 

The volatile displacement has been graphed against hydrogen 
content (Figure 5), following Seyler It will be seen at once that 

the points would not fall simply within the area of a triangle whose 
apices represent the hydrogen content and volatile displacement of 
vitrinite, fusinite and exinite of the type with which Seyler has made 


* 

Since Mott’s formula has been used, I have also used his convention 
in expressing the sign of £V, though I cannot see any obvious reason 
for changing the convention originated by Seyleri

us familiar (Figure 6), even when we allow for the fact that Mott’s 
formula gives TOlues which are in general two per cent, greater than 
Seyler’s for low rank coals. This, however, is hardly surprising in 
view of the far greater range of rank in the coals considered here as 
compared with those treated by Seyler. Thus, Seyler could assume a 
value of 5.25 1 0.25 per cent, for the hydrogen content of his vit¬ 
rinite, while the same is not true for Alberta coals, owing to the 
wider range of rank encountered. Some account must also be taken of 
the carbon content of these coals. Thus, if we plot only the coals 
of highest rank, those of the Blairmore-Kootenay formation, a series 
of coals containing in general less than 4.8 per cent, of hydrogen 
(marked with square dots in Figure 5) detach themselves markedly from 
the rest, and may be confined within a narrow band (broken lines. 

Figure 5) whose mean line has been drawn (l. Figure 5). These coals 
all lie within an area which is well defined geographically.* The 
mean line of these coals cuts the hydrogen axis at 4.2 per cent., and 
is almost exactly parallel to the line drawn by Seyler in his diagrams 
joining M pure n fusinite with vitrinite (Figure 6). It must be allowed, 
then, even though Seyler*s formula for the calculation of £v has not 
been used, that it is distinctly probable that these coals are largely 
mixtures of vitrinite with fusainous material. The vitrinite present 
would be expected to have a lower hydrogen content than Seyler’s, owing 
to the high rank of the coals in question, and the hydrogen content of 


Little importance can be attached to this, ho’wevers the coals in 
question may only be distinguished from others by their rank, which 
varies quite definitely with geographical location, i.e. distance 
from the Rocky Mountains.*

the fusainous material might be expected to be similarly displaced 
to a lower value* In view of the high values given by Mott*s formula 
for the volatile matter, coals having a volatile displacement of + 2, 
rather than zero, must be regarded as vitrinouso Thus it may be said 
that the coals discussed above contain vitrinite whose hydrogen content 
is 4*55 t 0*25 per cent* 

The rest of the coals now fall more readily into a Seyler 
triangular diagram® The mean line of all these points rises to a 
peak at about 5*2 per cent* of hydrogen and Sv “ +2*5® Coals with 
high hydrogen content and negative volatile displacements can now b© 
supposed to contain exinous material, while those with low hydrogen 
contents and negative volatile displacements will be thought to con¬ 
tain fusinite or micrinite* The vitrinite in these coals, it will be 
seen, does not vary in hydrogen content mush beyond Seyler»s limits, 
i*e* 5 - 5*5 per cent® 

Shape of the Coal Band and Petrology ; 

Having discussed the volatile displacement of Alberta coals, 
the problem which the shape of the coal band (as shown in Figures 5 and 
4) presents may be considered* The cause of the displacement of the 
band from "normal" in regions of high rank remains an enigma apart from 
the partial explanation already suggested* However, the fact that coals 
possessing carbon contents between 80 and 87 per cent* have hydrogen 
contents greater than that found to be general by Seyler (5*6 per cent® 
of hydrogen being the mean, as compared with Seyler®s 5*25 per cent®) 

* 

my be explained by assuming these coals to contain exinous material® 

7 


Owing to the small number of points in this region, however, I cannot 
support this conclusion with any very great certainty*

Tills is supported by the conclusions drawn from Figure 5* It is 
interesting to note, however, that Mott has drawn his coal band in this 
region in such a way that the band for Alberta coals in coincident with 
it tt 

One may be tempted to ascribe to the presence of fusinitic 
components the dip in the coal band between 73 and 80 per cent* carbon* 
However, examination of a carbon per cent*/volatile displacement plot 
(Figure 7) does not bear out this conclusion* We see from Figure 7 
that, while in the region 80-87 per cent* carbon the mean volatile 
displacement (shown, by histograms for convenience) tends to be negative 
as is expected, in the region 73-80 per cent* carbon the mean volatile 
displacement is definitely positive, reaching a maximum of about + Z 
at carbon values of 76 to 77 per cent* Hence it must be concluded that 
the n trough” in the coal band in this region is not entirely due to 
the presence of components other than vitrinite, but that it represents 
a decrease in the mean hydrogen content of the vitrinite itself to 
about 5*0 per cento This fact can only be ascertained by examination 
of Figure 7, and will not be revealed by Figure 5 alone* We are com¬ 
pelled, then, to recognize the fact that the course taken by the band 
for Alberta coals is the expression of some phenomena more fundamental 
than can be explained by the petrological make-up of the coals in question* 
Capacity Moisture : 

The capacity moisture contents of Alberta coals, measured 
by the method already outlined, constitute a body of information as 
interesting as it is unique* The capacity moisture contents of 300

coals, calculated to a Parr basis, are shown in Figure 8 plotted against 
carbon per cent. (Parr basis). It will immediately be noticed, on ex¬ 
amining this graph, that, in regions of Iowa*rank, coals of widely 
differing capacity moisture content may possess the same carbon content, 
while coals with different carbon content may possess the same capacity 
moistureo In other words, the capacity moisture/carbon band is step-wise 
in nature. This observation, previously made by McCulloch' 1 on the 
result of a few analyses only, and now fully borne out by the examin¬ 
ation of a far greater quantity of data, by its surprising character 
fully reveals to us the hitherto unknown importance of capacity moisture 
content in determining the properties of coals. For it is not unreason¬ 
able to assume that coals which, though having the same carbon content, 
differ widely in their capacity for absorbing water, differ also in 
rank. Indeed, this fact appears to b© taken cognizance of by the A.S.T.M. 
classification of coals, which classifies low rank coals according to 
their moist calorific value. 

Before this curve is examined in detail, a three dimensional 
plot which has been prepared showing capacity moisture graphed against 
both carbon and hydrogen content may be presented. This is shown in 
Figure 9® It will be noticed that, on the "treads” or horizontal parts 
of the capacity moisture/carbon curve, the hydrogen content of coals is 
definitely in excess of that shown by coals on the "riser” of the steps. 
This can best be seen by examining the projection of the plot on a 
plane bounded by the percentage C.M. and percentage H axes, also shown 
separately in Figure 10.

If we now compare this with a further plot, that of capacity 
moisture against volatile displacement (Figure 11), it will be seen 
that these peaks and troughs in the hydrogen content are coincident 
with peaks and troughs in the volatile displacemento Our first impulse, 
then, may be to attribute the step-wise nature of the carbon/capacity 
moisture plot merely to petrological difference in the coals. However, 
such a statement explains nothing unless we examine in more detail just 
how the petrology of coals influences their moisture content. That 
petrological composition alone cannot account for the step-wise pro¬ 
gression is immediately obvious. Let us take those coals which fall 
into the horizontal parts of the band in Figure 8, considering only 
coals whose carbon content is less than 84 per cent. These coals have 
volatile displacements which are comparable, lying at the peaks of the 
volatile displacement/capacity moisture curve, and, in the absence of 
more direct data, it must be assumed that their petrological com¬ 
position is comparable. The same will apply to those coals lying in 
the vertical parts of the band in Figure 8, only in this case the coals, 
tending to have negative volatile displacements, must be presumed to 
be petrologically more complex, probably containing some durainous 
material. Thus if only coals which are petrologically comparable are 
taken (whether those with small or those with large volatile displace¬ 
ments) we are forced to the conclusion that their capacity for absorb¬ 
ing moisture decreases with increasing rank in a discontinuous manner 
assuming certain definite values only, until at about 86 per cento 
carbon the capacity moisture assumes a limiting minimum value of 
2©3 1 0,9 per cent. When anthracitic rank is reached this value may

increase again* Though at first one may tend to incredulity of the 
statement underlined above, I believe that it is the only adequate 
description of the data presented here*

Classification of Alberta Coals * 

The classification of Canadian coals, and in particular 

those from the Province of Alberta, has received some attention from 

other authors# In particular, mention must be made of the work of 

Stansfield and Sutherland, who in 1929 most ably reviewed the subject 

(23) 

of classification with reference to Canadian coals* To them the 

reader may be referred for an outline of systems of coal classification 

used up to 1929, and for a corresponding bibliography* They also dis- 

cuss the application of these systems to Alberta, and other Canadian 

coals, and propose a classification on a basis of the calorific value 

and volatile matter of the pure, raw ("as mined' 1 ) coal, which has much 

in common with the A*S*T*M* classification* 

It is not proposed, here, to review in detail advances made 

in the scientific classification of coal since 1929* Readers may be 

referred back to the introduction to this Part, and also to the pub- 

(10)(12)(16) 

lished papers of Seyler and to the standards of the 

(24) 

American Society for Testing Materials* Other contributions to 

the knowledge of the subject will be more appropriately referred to 
when necessary in the text# 

Classification of High Rank Alberta Coals 

In considering the coals of Alberta it is proposed to treat 
of coals possessing carbon contents on th© Parr basis of greater than 
84 percent* separately from those possessing lower carbon contents# 

The reason for such an apparently arbitrary division will become appar¬ 
ent later, but at the moment it may be mentioned that Seyler has

adopted a carbon content of 84 percent* on the Parr basis as dividing 
lignitous and bituminous coals:* 

To these coals of higher rank may be safely applied those 
observations of Eviropean investigators which are concerned with coals 
of bituminous or higher rank* There is little difficulty here in 
classification according to one or other of the established systems® 

The question to be decided is whether to use ultimate or proximate 
composition as the basis for classification® The choice between the 
Seyler and the A®S*T*M* Classification is primarily a natter of the 
use of the ultimate or proximate composition of the pure coal® Both 
systems agree on the use of data calculated to the dry, minera1-matter- 
free (Parr) basis for the expression of their parameters, for the 
moisture contents of such coals are low, and fairly constant* 

The A*S*T*M® classification of coals suffers from two defects* 
In the first place no real account is taken of the petrological nature 
of coals - nor can any classification based upon proximate analysis 
alone take into account this most important characteristic® A qualit¬ 
ative expression of the petrology, on the basis of the appearance of 
band specimens, is the sole assessment mad©* It is only by a compar¬ 
ison of the determined volatile matter content with that calculated 
from the ultimate composition of the coal by means of the formula 
developed by Seyler that a quantitative estimate of the petrological 
composition of a coal can be made, short of a somewhat laborious 
physical examination* 

Secondly this classification does not provide any means of 
checking the results of a proximate analysis of a coal* The comparison 




- 37 


of the determined calorific value with that calculated from the ultimate 
composition is an invaluable means of checking the accuracy of both 
proximate and ultimate analyses. ) 

For these reasons, if it can be shown that the coal band 
for Alberta coals takes essentially the same course as that of Seyler, 
it will be more profitable to adopt Seyler*s classification for those 
coals which rank above 84 per cent, of carbon on the dry, mineral- 
matter-free (Parr) basis. This has already been shown to be the case, 
the deviation in the region 84 to 87 per cent, of carbon being ex¬ 
plained by the presence of exinous material (which Seyler*s method 
takes into account), while that in the region 90 to 93 percent, of 
carbon is not considered sufficiently great to render inapplicable 
Seyler*s limiting ranges of carbon and hydrogen content. Thus, Seyler*s 
classification in its entirety (as depicted in Table l)may be preferred 
with safety for the higher-rank Alberta coals. In Table I, the only 
liberty which has been taken with Seyler*s nomenclature is that the 
species "pseudo-bituminous” has been renamed "per-semi-bituminous”, 
and the species "serai-anthracite ”, "per -an t hr a c i te f 5 - a change proposed 
to render the nomenclature systematic. The term "pseudo-bituminous" 
will also be employed later to designate a class of coals lower in 
value than bituminous, just as the terms "pseudo-anthracite" and "pseudo- 
carbonaceous” are used to designate coals lower in carbon content than, 
but with the same hydrogen content as, anthracitic and carbonaceous 
coals respectively. In general, the boundaries between Seyler*s groups 
distinguish well between different types of Alberta coals, and his 
charts may be used to predict their properties#

From Seyler f s most recent work, it appears that the 
carbon contents which he has chosen to mark the boundaries between 
his species are the same as those critical carbon values at which a 
marked change occurs in the optical properties (and hence, probably, 
chemical properties) of the coal substance* Some future slight mod¬ 
ification of the limiting values for the carbon and hydrogen defining 
Seyler*s several species may be necessary in order to describe more 
precisely particular properties of Alberta coals* Measurements of 
the optical properties of selected Alberta coals are reported in Part 
II, where this subject will be pursued in greater detail* Meanwhile, 
Seyler ? s well substantiated classification will be accepted unchanged, 
other than in the matter of the nomenclature described above* 
Classification of Lower Rank Albe rta C oals 

Seyler 1 s classification of coals is not however, satisfactory 
for coals containing less than 84 percent, of carbon* Indeed, Seyler 
has dealt with such coals only in a general way, no doubt due to the 
infrequent occurrence of low rank coals in Great Britain. The two 
classes of “lignitous” coals defined by Seyler between 75 and 84 per¬ 
cent. of carbon are inadequate to distinguish accurately the changes 
in the properties of coals which occur over this range of carbon con¬ 
tent. On the other hand the classification put forward by Mott^^ ^ 
for these coals by means of a large number of apparently arbitrarily 
defined classes, tends to carry subdivision of species too far* Nor 
is his use of the proximate composition entirely to be recommended* 
Above all, both Seyler and Mott fail to emphasize the importance of 
the moisture content of low rank coals.

The A.S.T.M* classification is more satisfactory in that 
it takes into accoimt the moisture content of coals as mined* However, 
only in the case where a sample obviously contains surface moisture 
is Stansfield and Gilberts method of determining moisture applied - 
a not altogether satisfactory specification since coals in their 
"as received" condition may contain appreciably less than their "capacity"' 
moisture* Other equally grave objections may be levelled at this 
system of classification. The first of these is its use of proximate 
analysis, which, as has already been pointed out, allows no accurate 
assessment of the petrological character of coals, nor any check upon 
the accuracy of an analysis* Further, the use of the moist calorific 
value results in the overlapping of the groups with respect to such 
an important property as ultimate composition, for two coals possess¬ 
ing the same moist calorific value may differ considerably in their 
moisture contents (vide infra) and hence, on the dry basis, possess 
widely different carbon contents. Nor is the introduction of such 
factors as agglomerating and weathering properties in order to define 
certain classes entirely satisfactory* 

The difficulties encountered by these classifications when 
dealing with low rank coals appear to result from, an attempt to use 
only two fundamental parameters for the definition of the respective 
classes* In fact, the graphical study of lew rank Alberta coals has 
mad© it apparent that three parameters are necessary to completely 
describe the rank of such coals, namely, carbon, hydrogen, and 
"capacity” moisture contents (all expressed on a dry, minera 1 -matter- 
free (Parr) basis). Of these the hydrogen content is of less importance

when dealing with coals which consist mainly of vitrinous material, 
though a truly thorough classification must retain it for determining 
the volatile displacement and checking the accuracy of analytical 
data. Both carbon content and capacity moisture are, however, neces¬ 
sary for the definition of the rank of low rank coals: carbon content 
alone does not suffice, for it has been shown that coals which possess 
the same carbon content can differ widely in their capacity moisture, 
and hence, it is to be supposed, in rank. Further, many important 
properties of low rank coals are known to be dependent upon their 
moisture contents. 

For utilitarian purposes, it would seem that the A,S,T,M« 

classification, in spite of its defects, is the best system for the 

classification of low rank coals, using as it does the moist calorific 

value (which involves implicitly carbon content and moisture) as the 

parameter. The condition must be added, however, that the moisture 

(18 ) 

be determined by the method of Stansfield and Gilbart, * Hone the 
less, for the several reasons given above, a truly scientific class¬ 
ification must use three parameters for low rank coals, carbon, 
hydrogen, and capacity moisture contents. Such a classification will 
combine the good features of both the A,S,T,M, and the Seyler systems, 
while overcoming the objections to both. 

It remains, then to select the limits of the classes of 
coal in terms of carbon and capacity moisture contents, giving also 
the limits for hydrogen content to define per- and sub-hydrous species, 
lftlth respect to capacity moisture and carbon content, we are presented

with natural divisions, for a carbon/capacity moisture curve proceeds 
in a step-wise manner up to 84 percent, carbon, and each step may be 
taken to constitute a class. The divisions are shown on a capacity 
moisture/carbon diagram in Figure 12, and in tabular form in Table II, 

It must be emphasized, however, that though the carbon/capacity moisture 
curve most definitely proceeds in steps, the exact extent of these 
steps cannot at the moment be completely defined, and consequently 
until a greater body of analytical data accumulates, the classes out¬ 
lined must be taken as subject to modification. In Table III are 
shown the limits of the major properties of the coals in each group, 
together with the nearest equivalent groups in Seyler*s and the 
A«S,T*M* classifications. 

Terminology 

Inhere Seyler*s classification has been used, his nomenclature 
has also been adopted except for the two minor alterations already 
referred to for which a reason 1ms already been given. When dealing 
with coals of lower rank, the term, “pseudo-bituminous" has been pro¬ 
posed for naming the transition group between the high and low rank 
coals since the coals in this group exhibit true coking propensities 
regarded as characteristic of bituminous coals® Though swelling 
indices have not, in general, been determined for Alberta coals, the 
simple distinction between non-coking and coking coals 1ms been 
customary on the basis of the coherence of the residue from the vol¬ 
atile matter determination (in doubtful cases, under pressure from a 
500 gram weight). The line distinguishing coking from non-coking 
coals on a carbon/capacity moisture diagram coincides almost exactly

with the division between what have been called the pseudo-bituminous 
and semi-lignitous species* (See Fig* 12)* Should the term "pseudo- 
bituminous" be thought an unsuitable one, the new term "proto-bituminous” 
might serve to characterize these coals as preceding bituminous coals 
in rank* 

For coals of lower rank than this, following Seyler, the 
term "lignitous" has been adopted* The term "subbituminous" used in 
the Classification of the American Society for Testing Materials cannot 
be used if Seyler*s terminology is to be employed for the higher rank 
coals* The term is employed by Seyler for subhydrous bituminous coals# 
The lignitous class of coals has been divided into five groups, pre¬ 
fixed respectively semi-, meta-, ortho-, para-, and pseudo- (or perhaps 
proto-), by analogy with Seyler*s nomenclature* The pseudo-lignitous 
class might be termed lignite, though these coals do not differ from 
the other lignitous species enough to fully justify dropping the appel¬ 
lation "lignitous” when dealing with them* It would be better to 
reserve the use of the term "lignite" for even lower rank coals which 
have the properties associated with the name in common usage, as for 
example, in the A*SoToM* classification a calorific value below 8,300 
B*t*u* per lb. on the moist basis* Too few analyses of such coals 
are available, however, to allow us to define the leaver limit of this 


group.

PART II 


THE REFLECTIVITY OF ALBERTA COALS 















- 47 - 

Introduction 

Studies on the optical properties of coals arise naturally 
from attempts to differentiate bet?reen coals on the basis of their 
appearance* either to the naked eye, or under microscopic examination. 
The appearance of hand specimens to the naked eye, their brightness 
or dullness, their “lustre 11 etc., must obviously be the first prop¬ 
erty of a coal which is distinguished; and such distinctions have 
been made from the earliest times. However, these observations were 
not systematized until about 1920 when Dr. Marie Stopes first put 
forward a systematic classification of coal types on the basis of 
examination of hand specimens. Pour components were distinguished 

(17) 

thus and named vitrain, clarain, durain and fusain. / Microscopic 
examination of coals allows further distinctions to be made, reveal¬ 
ing clarain and durain to be essentially more complex than vitrain 
or fusain. These further components into which coals may be differ¬ 
entiated were named by Stopes, a common suffix ”-inite” being 
adopted, and were called collectively “macerals", by analogy with 
the term mineral applied to the components of crystalline rocks. 

Thus, vitrinite and fusinite are the macerals corresponding to the 
rock types vitrain and fusain respectively. Clarain consists of 
mixtures of vitrinite with another maceral, "exinite", and often 
some fusinite. Durain consists of vitrinite, exinite, and fusinite, 
together with considerable quantities of yet another maceral, " micro- 
nite" (“residuum” )• Differentiation of these macerals is made mainly 
on tlie basis of their optical properties (in a qualitative manner 
only). Purtlier distinctions may be made on a genetic basis - that 








48 


is, on the kind of plant material composing the various parts that 

* 

may be differentiated* 

Such a system of classification naturally gave rise to 
attests to estimate quantitatively the optical properties of coals 
and their components; in particular, it led to measurements of 
reflectivity, since it is the reflecting properties of a body which 
give it its distinctive appearance* It is with such measurements 
of this nature as have already been made, together with further 
measurements on the reflectivity of coals, that this section will 
deal. 

Previous Work : 

The earliest measurements of the reflectivity of coals 
were mainly confined to the examination of vitrain bands* Hoffmann 
and Jenkner^^ used the Leitz slit photometer for measuring the 
index of reflection of vitrains over a wide range of coalification* 
This apparatus consists essentially of a lamp giving a diffused 
source of light, an adjustable slit shutter, and a microscope fitted 
with a photometer* Light passing the slit enters the photometer 
attached to a dark-field condenser, and is resolved by a glass prism* 
One component beam, passed through a polarizer to the microscope, 
illuminates half the field of vision by reflection from the specimen* 
The other component, reflected at an angle of 90°, is employed for 

* 

The similar system evolved by Thiessen and others in the United 
States need not be considered here, for its distinctions are made 
on genetic rather than on optical considerations*

comparative purposes, passing through glass filters of various 
densities# 

These authors found that the reflective power of their 

specimens increased with decreasing volatile matter content; i*e*, 

(27) 

with increasing rank* Similar conclusions were reached by Stacm J , 
using a microscope with twin objectives for the simultaneous viewing 
of two specimens* Zhemchuzhnikov is reported to have made similar 
observations • ^ 

Observations of this nature give the specular reflectivity 
(sometimes called "lustre”) of specimens# Saprozhnikov and Syskov^^ 
measured both specular reflectivity at 45° incidence, and the diffuse 
reflectivity at 22#5° incidence and 67*5® reflection* Sharpiey^®^ 
also compared specular reflection at 22*5® incidence with diffuse 
reflection at 0® and 45® incidence, using unpolished surfaces# He 
found a large variation in both factors for the coals examined* 
Seyler,(3l) confirming Sharpley*s results in a written contribution, 
showed that polishing increased the specular and decreased the dif¬ 
fuse reflection factors* Camion and George measured specular 
and diffuse reflectivities incidental to the measurement of refractive 
index* Using a simple apparatus consisting of light source, sample 
holder, and collimator with a photocell, they measured specular re¬ 
flections of polished samples at 60® incidence, and the diffuse 
reflection at various angles around this* Hence they plotted curves 
showing the distribution of intensity of reflected light around the 
specular angle, curves of the typical Gaussian shape* They found 
that the "spread” of these curves was greatest for fusain, less for 
durain, and least for vitrain* To what extent this might be due to

the greater difficulty encountered in polishing the two former was 
not considered# Again, these workers found the specular reflectivity 
to increase with rank# 

However, the most important work in this connection has 

/OK \ / \ 

been that carried out by Seyler ' A ' on the petrological com¬ 
ponents of coal# This work arose directly from the observations of 
Stopes (see above), and carried on and extended that of Jenkner, 
Hoffmann, and Stach# Vendl^^, in 1954 described a method of deter¬ 
mining the percentage by volume of the different petrological con¬ 
stituents by means of reflectivity measurements carried out while 
traversing a coal specimen® Using a petrographic microscope, with 
a Berek photometer attached, Seyler measured the reflectivity of 
the various components in coals of different rank# An oil immersion 
lens, previously applied by Stach, was used# Seyler also measured 
the quantity of each component present by traversing the specimen# 
Both polished block, and polished powder set in wax specimens were 
examined# 

Seyler found that coal consists of a number of discrete 
regions which appear on a plane surface as what Stopes has called 
“delimited areas, optically different”# Each area is optically 
homogeneous and quite sharply separated from its neighbours, often 
coinciding with recognizable cellular plant structures, or parts of 
them# Further, Seyler found that for all the components, with the 
exception of exinite, the reflectivity varied discontinuously with 


rank, and could only as sums a small number of values# Since only

definite values of reflectivity -were found, it was possible to find 
with some degree of accuracy the percentage of each component present 
in any coal* In general, it was found that one component predomin¬ 
ated and that the component of next highest reflectivity was present 
in next greatest quantity* 

The values of reflectance, which can be assumed by compon¬ 
ents, are shown in Table IV below, a "reflectance number” (Nr) being 
assigned to each#

When coals at different stages of coalification are con¬ 
sidered, it is found that the predominant component tends to have 
a certain reflectance according to its rank, and that on reaching 
a certain degree of coalification, this component is stepped up.

or "imitates”, to the next highest value. The values of carbon 
content at which these mutations occur are given by Seyler as 
80 to 85 %, 89 %, 91 %>, and 92 to 93^* It may be noted that these 
values are not far removed from the limits between certain species 
in Seyler’s classification (see p*39 ), 

A further observation made by Seyler is that all the com¬ 
ponents belong to a series in which there is a constant ratio between 
the reflectance of any two successive members* The value of this 
common ratio is 1*363* Thus, if Rq is the reflectance of a compon¬ 
ent (in cedar oil, of refractive index 1*515), and is a whole 
number, then the series is represented by the formula; - 

R 0 » 0.26 x 1.363 NR . (viii). 

Here the starting point of the series (Ng - 0) is arbitrarily taken 
to be 0*26, the lowest reflectance yet encountered* 

This relation holds exactly only when oil of refractive 
index 1*515 is used as immersion medium* It is unlikely that this 
is accidental* Seyler has pointed out that Dopplerite, a fairly 
"pure" form of ulndn, must have a refractive index not very differ¬ 
ent from 1*515* Since the reflectance of transparent materials is 
dependant only on the difference between their refractive index and 
that of the surrounding medium, it follows that the reflectance of 
a coal component in cedar oil is a measure of the change which has 
occurred in its refractive index in the course of coalification* 

Seyler has also found that similar changes occur in coals 
on carbonisation* In this case, the reflectance of the components

present is stepped up as carbonization proceeds# However, the 
end-point on carbonization is not total conversion to component 
No* 9 t this point is exceeded, and the resultant product, called 
by Seyler “ rx coke”, has a reflectance of about 5*25^* 

The importance of these observations cannot be over¬ 
emphasized* Hitherto it has been assumed that the processes of 
coalification are continuous* Seyler*s findings must necessarily 
revise all theories concerning the changes which take place in the 
ultimate structure of the coal substance on coalification and car¬ 
bonization* These processes must now be regarded, at least in 
some particular, as discontinuous* No adequate appreciation of 
the consequences of Seyler*s work has yet been forthcoming, and 
this task must be undertaken in the discussion section of this 
present worko Some skepticism as to the validity of Seyler*s 
results has thus far been the only reaction expressed by other 
authors* However, repetition of the original measurements made 
under conditions rigorously exclusive of any subjective element, 

together with the results of similar observations made by the U* S.

Definitions and Formulae 

It will be as well, at this stage, to give definitions 
of terms which have been, and will again be, encountered in this 
section* 

(i) Refleci»nc£,^s£e£u£a£* This is defined as the percentage of 
light incident upon a surface which is reflected, the angle of 








54 - 


reflectance being equal to the angle of incidence* For a given 
surface, this quantity varies with the angle of incidence, which 
must consequently be specified* Where this angle is not specified, 
normal incidence and reflection may generally be understood* All 
measurements made by means of a petrological microscope necessarily 
measure the specular reflectance at normal incidence* 

(ii) Refl£ctanc£,__diffuse• This is defined as the percentage of 
incident light reflected from a surface at other than the specular 
angle* This may be measured for definite angles of incidence and 
reflection, and is found to decrease as the angle of reflection 
recedes from the specular* Of greater value for comparative pur¬ 
poses is an expression of the diffuse reflection defined as the 
ratio between the area of a rectangle which will just enclose a 
reflectance^/angle of reflection curve, and the area under such a 
curve* 

(iii) Fresnel Equation^ For transparent media, the electromagnetic 
theory of light predicts that the reflectivity, R, is given by the 
equations - 




where i = angle of incidence 


r “ angle of refraction* 


Where the light is vertically incident, this reduces to* -

Objects of Present Work 

Since Seyler has made his discoveries, it becomes obvious 
that studies on coals might most profitably be pursued by the separ** 
ation and separate examination of the components which he has found* 
However, such a separation may be regarded as extremely difficult, if, 
indeed, it is at present possible, and it is necessary, perforce, to 
determine the properties of coals, other than their optical ones, on 
mixtures of Seyler’s components* In view of this, measurements on coals 
as a whole do not lose their value* Further, the equipment necessary 
for the complete petrographies! examination of coals is complex and 
expensive, while a skilled technique is required in the measurements* 
Consequently, methods involving simpler equipment and technique, while 
not giving complete results, may be of considerable practical value* 

If the coals examined be petr©logically simple, it may be possible.

even with relatively crude apparatus, to confirm (though not to contra¬ 
dict) Seyler f s measurements* In addition, since reflectance varies 
with rank, it may be possible to obtain a classification of coals based 
upon reflectivity, alone or in conjunction with other properties. 

For this purpose, a relatively rapid and easy means of deter¬ 
mining reflectivity is needed, and since the polishing of coal samples 
is a laborious and often uncertain process, attention was turned to 
the measurement of the reflectivity of powder samples. This subject 
has received almost no attention from other authors, though Simek and 
Ludmilaare reported to have made, or discussed, such measurements* 
Finally, it was with some hope of relating measurements of reflectivity 
with other properties of coals that this work was undertaken, in the 
hope that thereby new light might be shed upon the fundamental processes 
of coalification* Since these other properties were necessarily deter¬ 
mined on ’’whole" coals, measurements of reflectivity for purposes of 
comparison had also to be made on the ’’whole" coal* It must be empha¬ 
sized, however, that such measurements can never b© regarded as a 
substitute for Seyler f s methods, which must always be used where a 
knowledge of the optical properties of a coal in detail, as well as in 
toto, are required*

Apparatus 


Experimental 


The apparatus which was used in making reflectivity 
measurements is simple, both in principle and design (see elevation. 
Figure 13, and plate. Figure 14), It consists essentially of a light 
source, sample holder and photometer unit comprising collimator and 
photocell* The light source consists of a number one photoflood lamp 
enclosed in a ventilated, light tight brass box, (B, Figure 13) which 
bears a brass tube, (C) holding a lens* Light is admitted to the 
tube from the box via a small hole, l/8" in diameter, and is focussed 
into a parallel beam by means of the lens* A mask over the lens 
aperture limits the diameter of the beam to 7/l6 w * This beam impinges 
upon a sample holder (s), consisting of a brass trough, rotatable about 
an axis perpendicular to the centre line of the light beam* The photo¬ 
meter unit is mounted upon an arm (a) rotatable about this same axis* 

It comprises a collimator tube (T), l/Z n in inside diameter, blackened 
on its inner surface, terminating in a photocell (P) screened by means 
of a cover (d) from adventitious light* It is contrived that the 
centre lines of the light beam and of the collimator tube intersect 
at all times in the plane of the sample when in position* A pointer 
attached to arm (A) and a scale graduated in degrees, allows the 
angle between the light beam and the collimator to be read* The 
angle between the plane of the sample and the light beam may be found 
by means of a peg attached to the stationary, and a scale attached

to the moving parts of the sample holder* 

In order that the intensity of the light source may be 
measured, an alternative socket for the photocell is provided (E) 
such that, when in position, the centre line of the photocell coin¬ 
cides with the axis of the sample holder, (this last being removed 
when such readings are taken)* 

The intensity of the light source may be varied by means 
of a powerstat inserted in the lamp circuit* 

In measuring the reflectivity of polished blocks it was 
possible to measure the photocell output directly, using a sensitive 
mirror galvanometer (sensitivity 0*0001 microamps per m.m*)* The 
circuit in this case consisted of a 90 volt potential delivered by 
a battery, applied across a Cetron, gas-filled photocell, with the 
galvanometer and its Ayrton shunt in series, together with a pro¬ 
tective 10 megohm resistance (see Figure 15, A)* 

When measuring the reflectivity of powdered samples, it was 
necessary to amplify the photocell current, for which purpose a D*C* 
amplifier was used (Circuit, see Figure 15, B)* 

The Reflectivity of Polished Blocks 

Method 

(1) Cutting and Polishing* By means of a power circular saw a block 
was cut from each sample, the surface to be polished being cut, where 
possible, parallel to a natural plane of cleavageo Where the coal had 
a banded structure it was necessary to cut in the plane of a band in 
order to obtain a resonably homogeneous surface* This block was then 
ground, using successively finer grades of emery powder on glass plates.

until a flat and reasonably smooth surface was obtained* Polishing 
was completed using a power driven high-nap cloth lap and alundum 
abrasive* 

By this means it was found to be possible to polish and 
repolish a surface to give reflectivity readings consistent in most 
cases to within two per cent* Where the coal was of a soft or frag¬ 
mented nature, or where the surface was markedly heterogeneous, this 
limit was sometimes exceeded* 

This method of polishing was found to give the best possible 
polish, though microscopic examination revealed that some scratches 
were still present in the surfaces thus polished* However, further 
polishing introduced shatter-cracks, the reflectance dropping rather 
than rising* For this reason care had to be taken not to polish a 
specimen for too long, or a low value was obtained* Further polish¬ 
ing on a low-nap cloth or on a lead lap, while not producing shatter- 
cracks, was found to introduce more scratches than it eliminated and 
so did not increase the reflectivity* Where low rank, high moisture 
coals were concerned, it was found to be necessary to keep the surface 
wet at all stages of polishing,, otherwise the surface rapidly cracked 
as it dried out* For this reason consistent results were obtained 
with greater difficulty for these coals, though when the reflectivity 
was measured as rapidly as possible after polishing and drying it was 
found possible to obtain results agreeing to within two per cent* in 


most cases

(2) ^pacular__r£fle_ctivi-t^ # All measurements were made in a dark room. 
Before making a measurement of reflectivity the photocell was placed 
in position E (figure 12) and the light intensity adjusted by means 

of the powerstat until a standard deflection of 700 cm. was registered 

by the galvanometer* This reading was repeated after each set of 

measurements, and if the intensity of the incident light had varied 

by more than two per cent, during the course of the experiment, the 

* 

readings were rejected. 

The polished block of coal was then mounted in the sample 
holder on a piece of plasticine, and pressed on a level surface so 
that its plane was in the plane of the sides of the sample holder* 

This was then placed in position on the apparatus* The arm A 
bearing the photocell was swung into position at 30° from the light 
beam, and the sample holder turned through approximately 15° from the 
horizontal* With the light on,the sample holder was next turned slowly 
until a maximum deflection was registered by the galvanometer* This, 
reading gives the specular reflection at 15° incidence* The specular 
reflection at other angles of incidence could be found by varying the 
angle made by arm A with the light beam, and turning the sample holder 
cor re sp ondingly* 

(3) Diffuse^ Reflection^round a Sp^ecular_Angle• With the sample in 
position as at the termination of the measurement of specular reflection, 
the arm A was turned successively through angles of 0*5®, 1°, 2°, 3°,

(Footnote) In fact, variations greater than this were seldom encount¬

4°, 5°, 7% 10°, and 15°, the galvanometer deflection being noted 
after each movement* Above 15° the diffuse reflectivity dropped to 
negligible values, undetectable by the photocell* By this means the 
diffuse reflectivity at 15° incidence and 15.5°, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 
22, 25 and 30 degrees reflectance respectively were measured#

From this, and from Figure 16, where angle of incidence is plotted 
against reflectance, and the curves extrapolated to normal incidence, 
it will be seen that the specular reflection at 15° incidence differs 
little from that at normal incidence# This is in accordance with 
what may be theoretically predicted from the Fresnel equation# Con¬ 
sequently, reflectivities measured at 15° incidence may be compared 
with those measured by other workers at normal incidence#

In measuring the reflectance of polished blocks, polishing 
was in general continued until agreement between two successive read¬ 
ings agreed to within two percent* Fluctuations in the intensity of 
the light source may also introduce an error of up to two percent*

However, it must be emphasized that this limit of error only applies 
to a particular block of coalo Where the coal is fairly heterogeneous, 
different blocks from the same sample may not differ by much more 
than two percent, in their reflectivity, but where the coal is mark¬ 
edly heterogeneous, the deviation may be much more considerable, since 
different proportions of the petrological components will be exposed 
in each block* Thus, measurements of reflectivity on polished blocks 
of this nature cannot be taken as truly representative of the coal 
sample* Only by making measurements on a large number of blocks 
from the same sample could a reasonably representative value be 
obtained* Such a process is far too laborious for practical purposes* 


The Reflectivity of Powder Samples 


Method * 

Since the reflectivity of powder samples is very much 
lower than that of polished surfaces, a far more sensitive means 
of detection must be used* To this end, a D*C« amplifier was used 
to amplify the photocell current, with a built-in microammeter to 
detect the amplified current (Circuit, Figure 15B)* Since the amp¬ 
lifier gave a linear response, no correction of the reading was 
necessary, the reading in microamps, being taken as a measure of the 
reflectivity* The incident light intensity was determined in the 
same way as before, a less sensitive galvanometer (Sensitivity, 0.0009 
microamps./mm.) being used, however* It was found to be necessary 
to reduce the E*M.F* applied to the photocell from 90 to 45 volts, 
in order to prevent a tendency for the photocell current to build

up over a period of time when exposed to light, thus causing an 
unsteady reading* 

The procedure used was as follows* The sample holder was 
fixed in a horizontal position, and filled to overflowing with the 
powdered sample* Excess was then scraped off with a glass plate, 
leaving a level surface flush with the sides of the sample holder* 
The arm bearing the photocell remained fixed in a position 30° from 
the normal* With the photocell in circuit with the amplifier, the 
zero adjustor on the amplifier was turned until the microammeter 
registered zero current* The light source was then switched on, 
and the microammeter read* This procedure was repeated after the 
surface of the sample had been disturbed and smoothed again, three 
readings being taken in all* 

Since the angles between light beam and sample, and sample 
and collimator were kept constant, it was not necessary to work in 
a dark room, providing the extraneous light remained constant* 
Current induced in the photocell by this extraneous light was bal- 
anced out by means of the zero adjustor on the amplifier* 

In order to ensure that the incident light remained 
constant, one sample, - (442-48), was taken as a standard, and 
before making a reading on a sample the light was adjusted with 
the standard in position to give a certain deflection on the micro- 
ammeter* Besides this, the intensity of the incident light was 
periodically checked by means of a mirror galvanometer connected 
to the photocell in position E* Remarkably little fluctuation was

observed in the intensity of the incident light over reasonably 
short periods of time, though occasional adjustment was necessary* 
Preliminary Experiments . 

The effect of particle size on reflectivity was first 
investigated* It was found that, even using samples which passed 
a 100 mesh sieve, though remaining on a 200 mesh sieve, consistent 
results could not be obtained when the surface was disturbed and 
remade* However, coals ground in a ball mill (such as are used for 
analytical purposes) gave results which were completely consistent 
within the limits of experimental error® It was necessary that 
grinding should continue for rather longer than the average grinding 
time used in preparing analytical samples* The actual grinding time 
necessary naturally varies with the type of mill used® That used 
in these experiments required at least 55 minutes (up to 50 mins* 
for some coals) to produce the requisite degree of fineness, though 
this time could be reduced by using samples already ground for 
analytical use* 

Further experiments were also carried out to determine 
the effect of moisture on reflectivity* Three samples of low rank 
coals were examined in a moist condition, and after drying for three 
hours at 105 °C* in vacuo* No change in the reflectivity was observed 
after drying® 

Results * 

In Table IX are shown the reflectivities in microamps® of 
some 35 samples of Alberta Coals® The incident light intensity in 
all cases corresponded to a galvanometer reading of 21,5 cm*.

(equivalent to 0*1955 microamps)• Readings are given to the nearest 
microamp, it being difficult to estimate fractions of a microamp on 
the scale employed* Within this limit, successive readings on the 
same sample were found to be completely consistent in every case* 
Errors * 

The limits of error in making readings was, as has been 
stated above, equal to one microamp* Thus the error on readings of 
powder reflectivity is from 2 to 5 percent*

Discussion * 

Specular Reflection of Polished Blocks * 

The measurements of other workers on the specular reflect¬ 
ivity of coals have shown that, with minor exceptions, the reflectivity 
increases with rank* That the measurements reported above support 

this general conclusion may be seen by examining Figure 18, a plot 

* 

of specular reflectivity versus carbon content for sixteen Alberta 
coals* However, coals 452-48 and 407-49 are major exceptions to the 
rule, both having considerably higher reflectivities than would be 
expected from their carbon content* Reason for these exceptions may 
be found in the fact that measurement was made in both cases on 
homogeneous bands which formed only a minor part of each sample* 

It was found impossible to obtain consistent readings on the heter¬ 
ogeneous portions of these coals* This indicates the unrepresentative 

nature of overall measurements of reflectivity on polished blocks, 

he 

unless the coals are petrol ogically 4 aete ro gone on a , or unless the 
petrological components are distributed in such small areas as to 
provide a reasonably representative surface when polished* Subject 
to these reservations, however, it may be stated that the reflectivity 
of Alberta coals tends to increase with increasing carbon content* 

This increase is not regular* It will be noticed immediately 
on examining Figure 18 that coals tend to assume certain definite 
values: of reflectivity* Thus coals posessing different carbon contents 


* Analytical data on the coals used in the experimental sections 
of this work may be found in Appendix IV*

may have very similar reflectivities, and the carbon content/reflectivity 
curve appears to be stepwise in nature# Even coals 452-48 and 407-49 
do not appear to be serious exceptions to this rule# Lack of data on 
more than a very few coals, however, precludes any strict generalization# 
But in view of the fact that Seyler has found the change in reflectivity 
of petrological components with rank to be stepwise, these results are 
held to be significant. Such a stepwise progression of overall reflect¬ 
ivity would be expected where coals have a simple petrological composition# 

If it is assumed that the absorbtion of light by coals is 
small, the reflectivity in a medium of refractive index 1*515 may be 
calculated from the reflectivity in air# The results of such a calcul¬ 
ation for the sixteen coals examined are shown in Table X# No exact 
correspondence between the limiting values which Alberta coals tend to 
assume and the members of Seyler*s series (see page 51) can be shown# 
However, the mean values of the reflectivity for groups of coals of 
almost the same reflectivity do not diverge very widely from certain of 
Seyler*s values, though they tend to have rather higher reflectivities 
than Seyler has found# Thus coals 440-48 and 406-49 have a mean reflect¬ 
ivity of 3#18 percent, - c«f# Seyler*s component, N^ = 8, R - 3#X1 per¬ 
cent - while the other groups or individuals have mean reflectivities 
of 1#70, 1.34, 0.98, and 0.25 percent, which may be compared to Seyler*s 
components s 6, 5, 4 and 0, with reflectances of 1*64, 1*26, 0*92 
and 0*26 respectively* 

It will also be noted that some low rank coals posess reflect¬ 
ivities in air which make their refractive index, calculated from the

less than 1*515, the minimum refractive index possible in Seyler’s 
series* In explanation of this fact, evidence will be presented 
(Part III) to show that the low rank Alberta coals contain a high 
proportion of gross, pores or cracks* Such pores probably exist 
between the different petrological units of which these coals are 
composed, and hence would not affect measurements made by Seyler’s 
methods, while yet affecting measurements of the type reported 
above• 

Thus it may be stated that the measurements of the 
reflectivity of Alberta coals, made tend on the whole to confirm the 
work of Seyler and other workers in this field* 

Specular and Diffuse Reflection 

( 51 ) 

It has been pointed out by Seyler v ' that the diffuse 
reflection of a sample of coal decreases with polishing, the spec¬ 
ular reflection at the same time increasing# Thus the diffuse 
reflection depends at least partly on the degree of polish attained* 
As such it may serve as a useful criterion of the degree of polish¬ 
ing which has been obtained for a particular sample• 

It may be pointed out here that what has been called 
diffusely reflected light in the experimental section of this Part 
is not due entirely to diffuse reflection* The incident light is 
not entirely parallel and the angle of collimation is necessarily

finite, so that specularly reflected light may strike the photocell 
even when the collimator tube is displaced from the specular angle. 

It may be calculated that, with the sample at 15° from the light 
beam, the collimator tube must be moved to a position almost 35° 
from normal (5° from specular position) before all specularly re¬ 
flected light is cut off* The possible displacement will naturally 
vary with the instrument used, these values only applying to that 
used by the author* 

Examination of the curves shown in Figure 17 will show 
that the reflectivity of all the samples drops to quite small values 
(from 2 to 10 percent of the specular) for angles of reflection 
greater than 20°* Thus it may be taken that a good polish has been 
obtained on all the specimens* 

Though, strictly, the diffuse reflection should be measured 
only by the reflection at angles of reflection greater than 20°, for 
comparative purposes the complete curves as shown in Figure 17 may 
be used since the measurements were all made under the same conditions 
with the same instrument* It will be seen from these curves, and 
from the ratio, D r , which has been calculated (see Table VIII) that 
the diffuse reflectivity varies* Generally, it tends to increase 
with decreasing rank of the coals, though with exceptions* If the 
diffuse reflectivity is a function principally of the degree of 
polish attained, this means that a comparable polish cannot be pro¬ 
duced in all coals by using a certain polishing technique* The 
specular reflections measured must consequently be affected, since 
the specular reflection also varies with the degr9© of polish* The

results of Cannon and George (see Introduction to this Part) illust¬ 
rate this in a more striking manner* The specular reflection which 
they find for a fusain is less than that for a vitrain, while its 
diffuse reflection is much greater (see Figure 19). How according 
to Seyler, fusains tend to have higher specular reflectivities than 
comparable vitrains® Thus it seems that the low specular reflection 
found by Cannon and George for their sample of fusain was due to the 
imperfect polish of the surface examined* 

Since it is difficult to specify or attain a particular 
degree of polish, it may be thought that measurements of the specular 
reflection on polished surfaces are unreliable® This unreliability, 
however, may be eliminated to some extent by taking the area under 
curves such as those shown in Figure 17 as a measure of the reflective 
power* Such a quantity may be conveniently called the "total reflect¬ 
ivity” of a sample* It should be less dependent upon the degree of 
polish obtained® Indeed, unless the surface under examination is 
so rough as to contain planes orientated to the surface at such 
large angles as to reflect no light onto the photocell whatever its 
position (within the mechanical limits of the apparatus), this quantity 
should be completely independent of the degree of polish attained* 

In the case of the samples examined in the course of this work, the 
adoption of this standard is of no great consequence, since a reason¬ 
ably comparable polish was obtained on all samples. Where, however, 
samples of fusain, and possibly durain, are under examination it may 
be of greater importance, since it would seem that it is difficult

For purposes of comparison, the areas under the curves 
in Figure 17 ("total reflection") are plotted against carbon content 
in Figure 20. 

Reflectivity of Powder Samples . 


The reflectivity of powders as compared with that of the 


polished solid is a subject which has received little attention 
hitherto. 


Before dealing with the experimental values obtained a 


theoretical treatment may conveniently be attempted. A powder may 
be thought of as composed of a large number of facets, randomly 
orientatedo If a beam of parallel light is shone upon it, only 


those facets which are orientated at an angle of 90 to the 


light beam will reflect specularly at an angle of o< * All other 
facets will reflect only diffusely in this direction. Thus a given 
facet, at an angle of 90 - x from the light beam, will reflect a 



percentage of the incident light, ** , where r 


ular function depending on the shape of the curve relating reflect¬ 
ivity to angle of reflection for a perfectly polished sample® The 
reflectivity of a facet orientated at an angle of 90 - (x + dx), 
where dx is infinitely small, will also be equal to • Now the 
proportion of facets which lie between 90 - x and 90 - (x +dx) will 

be . Thus the reflectivity of all facets lying within this 
180 

angle, dx, at an angle of oi to the light beam will be -

Consequently, the total reflection due to all facets will be -

Thus, the percentage of light reflected by a powder sample, with 
the collimator at an angle of to the light beam, should be 
directly proportional to the area under a curve relating reflect¬ 
ivity to angle of reflection for a perfectly polished surface of the 
same material, with an incident angle of ngr s (that is, the total 
reflectivity)* 

The relationship actually found between powder reflect¬ 
ivity and total reflectivity is represented in Figure 21 where the 
powder reflectivity is plotted against total reflectivity, both 
being expressed as a percentage of the reflectivity of coal 440-48* 
The data from which this plot was made are shown in Table XI* It 
will be seen that the coals tend to form two series, each lying 
around a straight line* In all cases, however, the powder reflect¬ 
ivity is greater than would be expected, and the divergence becomes 
greater as the rank decreases* Unfortunately the small amount of 
data available does not permit strict generalizations to be made* 

From this curve, then, it appears that some factors other 
than those considered in the theoretical development are involved 
in determining the relation between powder and total reflectivity* 

A partial explanation may be sought in the fact that lump samples

of the low rank coals apparently contain gross cracks or pores, 
which would presumably be eliminated (by fissure along them) in 
powdering the coal finely® If this is the case, then presumably 
the powder reflectivity is a truer representation of the optical 
properties of the coal substance than is the reflectivity of pol¬ 
ished samples® This matter, however, may best be discussed in 
relation to other coal properties - a subject which will be res¬ 
erved for the general discussion which forms the conclusion of 
this work* 




PART III 


THE DENSITY OF ALBERTA COALS 







- 95 - 

Introduction 

The density of large particles of a non-porous solid is 
a well defined property, easily measured by well known methods* When 
dealing with highly porous solids, such as coals, such measurements 
are complicated by the effect the pore structure may have upon them* 

Thus if the density of a coal is measured by immersion in a liquid, 
the observed density will depend upon the degree to which that liquid 
penetrates the pores* If the pores are permeated completely, the 
resultant density may be regarded as the true density ; that is, as 
the ratio of the weight to volume of the solid, excluding pores* 

Where no penetration occurs, the resultant density will be dependent 
on the true density and on the porosity (percentage of the total 
volume represented by pore space) of the substance* This density 
is often called the apparent density of the solid* Partial penet¬ 
ration of the pores by a liquid will give values for the density 
intermediate between the true and apparent densities* 

Another factor which may influence the results of true 
density measurements is the adsorbtion of the fluid used in density 
measurements by the solid* If adsorbtion occur®, then the density 
may be increased by the volume contraction which accompanies adsorbtion* 
A confusing factor in measuring the density of porous solids 
is the decision as to what shall be regarded as the upper and lower 
limits of the size of true pores* In other words, above what upper 
limit of size shall a pore be regarded as a mere fissure or accidental 
cavity in the substance; and below what lower limit can a pore be 
regarded as a normal inter-molecular (or even intra-molecular) space?

With all these difficulties, however, it is possible to measure the 
density of coals by a variety of means, and to obtain consistent 
results therefrom. 

Mineral Matter Correction ** 

The density of the pure coal substance, unit density, can¬ 
not be directly determined, but may be approximated on the basis of 
simplifying assumptions. For example, several workers have noticed 
an approximate increase of 0*01 in apparent density for each percent 
inci*ease of ash. This relationship is however, approximate. More 
accurate means for determining the unit density exist. If the 
percentage and density of the mineral matter present are known, it 
would be possible to predict the unit density by means of the 
expression -

where a 33 density of coal, including mineral matter. 

b 83 density of mineral matter 
and p ** percentage by weight of mineral matter, in coal. 

The percentage of mineral matter present may be deduced from the ash 
content by means of the expressions evolved by Parr (see page 11) 
and others. The mean density of the mineral matter present may be 
approximated more or less closely from a knowledge of pyritic sulphur

given. The reader may conveniently be referred to the excellent dis¬ 
cussion of this matter in the symposium "Chemistry of Coal Utilisation"

and of total mineral matter by using a value of 5.0 for the density 
of pyrite and 2.7 for that of the other minerals in coal. 

Previous Work 

Though a considerable quantity of work has been carried 
out on the bulk and apparent densities of coals, surprisingly little 
has been done on the more fundamental true density. Most of the 
work on apparent specific gravity has been carried out with a view 
to strictly practical ends, and need not concern us here. The 
residuum of work which is of more than immediate practical interest 
is unfortunately rather sparse and unsystematic. 

Variations of density due to type differences have been 
little explored. Vitrains are generally found to have lower apparent 
densities than durain or fusains (^7)(38) _ -though -^ 0 ^hat extent this 
is a reflection of the relatively low ash contents of vitrains is not 
stated. ■ Wandless and Macrae, determined true specific gravity 

of coals on the mineral-matter-free basis, and found that "grey” 
durains and fusains tend to have higher densities than vitrains, 
while ’’black*' durains (containing considerable quantities of exinous 
material) have lower densities than vitrains. 

Earlier workers failed to find any consistent relationship 

between ash-free density and volatile matter, fixed carbon, or fuel 

(37)(40) (39) 

ratio. ' J However, Wandless and Macrae found that a good 

straight line relationship existed between the density and the 

hydrogen content of the coals they examined, the density increasing 

with decreasing hydrogen content.

Perhaps the most valuable study yet made on the density 
( 41 ) 

of coals is that of Franklin. This worker has determined the 
densities of a number of coals by several methods for the purpose 
of comparing their relative merit. She has found that the density 
of coals determined by a helium displacement method is the most 
accurate and reliable measure of this property. She also finds that 
the density determined by methanol displacement is in all cases 
higher than that given by other methods, and by correlating this 
difference with the heat of wetting of coals in methanol has shown 
that it is due to the compression accompanying the adsorbtion of 
methanol by coals. 

Densities determined by displacement of water are, after 
determinations using helium, perhaps the most accurate, though 
Franklin has shown that for high rank coals the density in water 
tends to be less than that in helium, while for low rank coals the 
density in water is greater. Densities in other liquids, such as 
benzene or n-hexane, are generally low, and that this is due to 
incomplete penetration of the pores by these liquids is shown by 
the fact that the density increases as the coals are allowed to 
stand immersed in these liquids. Such liquids do, however, penetrate 
a considerable proportion of the pore space. 

Franklin has used her results to confirm the observation 
of Wandless and Macrae, that the density varies inversely with 
hydrogen content. Plotting hydrogen content against specific volume 
(a more logical quantity to use in this connection) she obtained a 





0 .

straight line relationship, expressible by the equation - 

V = 0*54 + 0.043H cm. 5 /g. .......• •<>• (xv) 

where V is the specific volume, and H the hydrogen content percent* 
Since the apparent density of a coal is a function only 
of the true density and the porosity, a knowledge of both true and 
apparent densities makes possible the calculation of the porosity 
of a coal. Thus - 


Porosity 


_ 100 (True density - Apparent density) 

True density 


(xvi) 


(42) 

King and Wilkins have measured the porosity of a number 
of coals by this means, using a mercury displacement method for the 
determination of apparent density. They have found that the porosity 
is approximately proportional to the heat of wetting. Assuming that 1 
cal. of heat of wetting (methanol) corresponds to 10m. of surface 
it is possible to calculate the mean pore diameter. Assuming the pore 
space to consist in cylindrical, non-intersecting pores, the mean pore 
diameter is found to be 40 A 0 : alternatively, the separation between 
equally spaced cubes of coal material would in every case be about 
12 A°. 


The results of Franklin confirm this work. This author deduces, 
however, from the fact that liquids such as benzene and n-hexane 
penetrate the pores in coals only slowly, that the pores are not 
uniform, and are obstructed by more or less numerous fine constrictions. 

A further property of coals which gives information as to 
the porosity is the moisture content. In this connection the volume

moisture content must be used, that is

M + (100 - M) V 

where M is the weight moisture content percent, and V is the true 
specific volume of a coal® Franklin shows that for low rank coals 
the volume moisture content and the porosity are comparable, -chough 
for higher rank coals the volume moisture content is only a fraction 
of the porosity® (The quantity of data on which this statement is 
based is* however, small)* It has also been shown that porosity/rank 
curves (or rather, bands) have the same typical ‘'parabolic” shape 
as moisture/rank curves* (4X) 

Objects of Present Work 

The primary object of the present work has been to obtain 
values of the true density for a number of Alberta coals for purposes 
of comparison with other properties (particularly reflectivity), and 
with the work of others* Most measurements have hitherto been carried 
out on high rank coals, while the majority of Alberta coals examined 
here were of low rank, so that it was hoped to extend, as well as 
confirm, the work of others* Since it was not found possible to 
assemble the apparatus necessary for the determination of densities 
in helium, the density in water was measured* 

In addition to the measurement of true density, measurement 
was also made of the apparent density* For this purpose a mercury 
displacement method, applicable to coarsely ground (though dust free) 
coals was evolved, since most of the coals examined were not available

in lump form. In a few cases, where it was possible, measurements 
of the "lump” density were also made for purposes of comparison# 

By these means, the porosity of the coals examined was found* 

Finally, it was decided to attempt to gain some idea of 
the distribution of the pores according to size* For this purpose 
measurement was also made of the density of a number of coals in 
xylene* Additional experiments using tetralin formed an attempt to 
estimate the size and shape of the pores not readily accessible to 
xylene, benzene etc* 

Experimental 

True Density: Water Displacement Method s 

Method : 

In order to obtain a true and reproducible result in density 
measurements by the water displacement method it is necessary to 
ensure that the coal is thoroughly wetted* This has been achieved 
by previous workers by previously evacuating the coal, by boiling, 
and by the use of wetting agents# Preliminary experiments showed 
that if the coal were brought to capacity moisture content before 
immersion in water wetting was facilitated, and complete wetting 
could then be achieved by boiling, even with bituminous coals: which 
are wet with difficulty* It was also found that, using this "pre- 
saturation” technique, coarser coal could be used than was otherwise 
necessary* 

The procedure finally adopted was as follows# Approximately 
10 g# of the coal, ground in a corn mill, was brought to capacity 
moisture content by standing over saturated potassium sulphate

solution in vacuo at 30°C for 72 hours* It was then transferred to 
a tared density bottle of 50 ml* capacity, and weighed* Freshly 
distilled water was next added, half filling the bottle, and the 
mixture was boiled on a hot plate for not less than an hour* The 
time of boiling varied with the type of coal, low rank coals seldom 
requiring more than an hour, while bituminous coals needed sometimes 
three hours or more in order to become thoroughly wetted* At the 
end of this period the density bottle was cooled, and filled up with 
distilled water* After coming to equilibrium in an air bath at 30°C 
(a period of about 3/4 hr. was required for this) excess water was 
removed and the bottle and its contents weighed* Each determination 
was duplicated in order to check the accuracy of the experiment* 

Now if W is the weight of moist coal taken, and M its 
moisture content per cent, the weight of dry coal, w, is W(100«H)* 

If the volume of water displaced by the wet coal is V, then the 
quantity which would b© displaced by the dry coal, v, is (Y - W x M)* 
Hence the true densitjt is given by the expression - 

D(true) ■ ! ' W(100 - M) ..... (xviii) 

v Y - W x M 

From this the unit density may be calculated using the formula (xiv) on 
page 96* The mineral matter content may be assumed to be equal to 
1*1 times the ash content (see page 14), while the density of the 
mineral matter may be taken to be 2,7, since the sulphur content of 
Alberta coals is low and remarkably constant*

some 35 Alberta coals* The unit densities calculated from these are

also given* In a third column the specific volume, the reciprocal 
of the unit density, is also given* These results represent the 
average of duplicate experiments* 

From a knowledge of the true density and of the weight 
moisture content the volume moisture content may be found, using 
equation (xvii), page 100* The results of such a calculation are 
expressed in the fourth column of Table XII* 

Errors, 

Agreement between duplicates could generally be obtained 
to within 0*2 per cent, (3 in the third place of decimals)* Where 
this limit was exceeded the determination was repeated* The correction 
applied for mineral matter content probably introduces a somewhat 
greater error of uncertain magnitude* 

Apparent Density; Mercury Displacement Method s 

Apparatus and Method , 

For the determination of apparent densities on coarsely 
ground samples of coals a mercury displacement method was devised* 

Since coal floats on mercury and since it was necessary to evacuate 
the coal to free it from trapped air, a special density bottle was 
designed to this end (see Figure 22)* It consisted of a stout 50 ml. 
capacity flask with a well-fitting ground-in joint at the neck, the 
neck above the joint being tapered down to a sintered glass disk 
(impermeable to mercury)* Above this disk the neck was drawn off 
to a narrow tube. From below the ground joint a side arm projected, 
being carried upward and terminating in a neck of capillary dimensions 
just above the level of the sintered glass plate*

A determination of apparent density was carried out as 
follows* A portion of the coarsely ground, dust-free coal weighing 
about 10 g* was dried at 105 °C in vacuo for 3 hrs*, then placed in 
the tared density bottle and weighed* The side arm of the density 
bottle was then connected to a reservoir of clean, dry mercury by 
means of a rubber tube and screw clip, while the neck of the vessel 
was connected to an oil pump (see Figure 22)* The vessel was evac¬ 
uated thoroughly, and mercury was then admitted slowly by opening 
the screw clip, the bottle being meanwhile shaken* When full the 
bottle was disconnected from the pump and mercury reservoir, the 
side arm being full to its neck, and the bottle and its contents 
were weighed* Knowing the weight of the bottle full of mercury 
alone, the volume of mercury displaced by the coal was readily found* 

In order to obtain a good vacuum in the density bottle 
before admitting mercury, it was found to be necessary to lightly 
grease the ground glass joint* The weight of this grease was imper¬ 
ceptible as compared to the weight of the bottle plus coal and mercury* 
Results * 

The results of determinations of the apparent densities of 
35 Alberta coals are given in Table XIII* Also listed are the 
densities corrected for mineral matter, and the specific volume* 

From the true and apparent densities the porosities per cent* of the 
35 coals were calculated, and these are also shown in Table XIII*

this limit were rejected, the determination being repeated* 

Lump Density! Buoyancy Method 

In a few cases where lump samples were available densities 
were also determined by the buoyancy method* This consists in weighing 
the lump of coal first in air and then suspended in water* The loss 
in weight in water corresponds to the weight of water displaced* 

The lump used in such determinations was subsequently 
ground and its moisture content determined* Hence the "lump” density 
of the moisture and ash-free coal could be found* 

Resuits . 

The results of four determinations of lump density are shown 
in Table XIV, as determined, and on a dry, ash-free basis* The por¬ 
osities of the lump coals, calculated from this and the true densities, 
are also shown*

is necessary to use a completely standardized procedure to obtain 
comparable results, short of allowing time for complete penetration# 
Since a measure of that part of the pore space readily accessible to 
xylene was required in this case, the determinations were completed 
as rapidly as was compatible with freeing the coal from trapped air* 

Determinations were carried out as follows# About 5 g# of 
the powdered coal sample were dried at 105°C in imcuo for 3 hours, 
then transferred to a tared 25 ml# density bottle and weighed# Xylene 
was adued to half fill the vessel, and the bottle and its contents 
were placed in a vacuum dessicator, which ms then evacuated by means 
of an oil pump for a period of 1 hour# It was judged from the appear¬ 
ance of the bubbles that this length of time was sufficient for the 
removal of trapped air, the liquid beginning to "bump" after about 
3/4 hr# The bottle was then filled with xylene and placed in an 
air bath at 30° for 3/4 hr# to come to equilibrium, after which time 
excess xylene was removed, and the bottle weighed# The total time 
of the determination, from the addition of xylene to the removal of 
excess, was in no case allowed to exceed 115 minutes, or to fall 
below 110 minutes. Using this standard procedure it was found to be 
possible to obtain reasonably reproducible results#

Discussion 

True Density and Elementary Composition: 

Wandless and Macrae and Franklin have found that the 
specific volume of the coals examined by them is dependent upon the 
hydrogen content, according to the equations - 

Y « 0.54 + 0.043Ecm. 3 /g, *... ••••••.«.. (xv) 

A plot of specific volume against hydrogen content for Alberta coals 
(Figure 23) shows that this relationship does not hold for these coals. 
However, if an arbitrary relationship is taken, namely; - 

Y = 0.45 + 0.55Hcm. 3 /g. (xix) 

and the specific volume calculated for the 35 coals, it is found that 
the difference between the observed and calculated values of specific 
volume bears linear relationship to the oxygen content. This may be 
seen from Figure 24, where the difference between observed and calculated 
specific volumes is plotted against oxygen content. The scatter of 
points around the mean line is somewhat greater than can be accounted 
for by experimental error, but the relationship is none the less 
striking. The figures from which this graph was plotted are shown 

in Table XVI. 

Thus it is possible to predict the specific volume of a 
coal with a fair degree of accuracy from the oxygen and hydrogen 
contentso The resultant equation of the mean line in Figure 24, by 
means of which this prediction may be made, is - 

•2 

Y = 0.512 + 0.055H - 0.0053 0cm. /g. ... (xx).

Now on theoretical grounds it would not be expected that 
the oxygen would have so great an effect upon the specific volume, 
for the ratios of the atomic weight to the effective atomic volume for 
carbon and oxygen are comparable in magnitude* The variation with 
hydrogen content, on the other hand, is expected, since the ratios 
in this case differ considerably* It appears, then, that some other 
factor is involved in determining the density of these coals* This 
factor must be either fundamental or some systematic error in the 
determination* In the latter case, the only obvious systematic 
error which can be conceived is the effect of adsorbtion of water 
by coals* If this is the factor involved, the deviation of the 
specific volume of Alberta coals from that predicted by Franklin*s 
equation should be a function of the internal surface of the coals, 
and hence of the porosity* There is, indeed, a tendency for the 
deviation to increase with increasing porosity, but the relationship 
is not simple* Thus, though the effect of adsorbtion cannot be 
ignored, and certainly plays a part in determining the density, it 
appears that some more fundamental factor, dependent upon the chemical 
composition rather than physical properties, in part determines the 
density of Alberta coals* The factor of atomic volume is already 
taken into account - the effect of factors such as adsorbtion on a 
macromolecular level cannot be held to be entirely responsible* Hence 
the density of coals must be held to be dependent not only upon the 
atomic voliune of the constituent atoms, but on the spacing of the 
molecules: which make up the coal substance* 



* 








- 117 - 

It seems likely, then, that the density of coals in -water 
is not simply determined by one factor alone, but is the resultant 
of a number. These may be listed asj - 

(1) The atomic volume and proportion of the constituent atoms, 

(2) The spacing of the molecules composing the coal substance, 

(3) The degree to which water molecules can penetrate between layer 
planes of molecules. That such penetration does occur in low- 
rank coals at least seems to be indicated by the unexpected 
increase of density with decreasing rank (increasing oxygen 
content). This factor is probably of considerable importance. 

(4) The degree to which water is adsorbed by the coal «• which will 
depend upon its internal surface. 

It is unfortunate that, at the present time, it is not possible to 
assess the relative importance of these factors. It seems probable, 
however, that factors (2) and (3), which are to some extent related, 
are of far greater importance in determining the density of low rank 
coals than they are in the case of bituminous and higher rank coals. 

The Porosity of Alberta Coals . 

Porosity and Volume Moisture Content 

It will become apparent on examining Tables XII and XIII 
that, while the porosity of the higher rank Alberta coals is comparable 
with the volume moisture content, for the lower rank coals the volume 
moisture content considerably exceeds the porosity* Now mercury under 
a pressure of one atmosphere will not penetrate pores of smaller diam¬ 
eter than 10 \ so it must be inferred that low rank Alberta coals 





Q 



CO' 







/'o',:c- . 






118 


contain an appreciable proportion of pores of larger dimensions than 
this, and that these pores are capable of retaining moisture. It will 
be noted that the few "lump" porosities measured are in close agree¬ 
ment with the volume moisture contents, even for low rank coals. 

Hence it seems likely that powdering of the coals destroys some of 
the pore space* 

Both porosity and volume moisture content increase with 
decreasing rank, as has been noticed by others* (^-)(43) The relation¬ 
ship cannot be more accurately characterized than by this statement 
at presento 

From the two sets of porosities derived from the apparent 
density and the density in xylene, together with the volume moisture 
content, it is possible to divide the pore space encountered in each 
coal into three ranges of size* 

(1) ‘’Gross Porosity”, may be defined as that part of the pore space 
permeable to mercury; that is, comprising pores greater in diameter 
than 10,^ * This quantity is obtained by subtracting porosity (from 

density in mercury) from volume moisture content* 

(2) “Medium Porosity”, defined as that part of the pore space imperm¬ 
eable to mercury, but readily permeable to xylene* Obtained by 
subtracting the “fine porosity” (from the density in xylene) from 
the porosity* 

(3) “Fine Porosity” - that part of the pore space difficultly permeable 
to xylene, permeable to water. 

These three porosities have been calculated, and are listed 
in Table XVII, together with the volume moisture content (which may

be regarded as the total porosity) for purposes of comparison© In 
Figure 25 these quantities are shown as a proportion of the volume 
moisture content, by plotting volume moisture content against fine 
porosity, porosity, and volume moisture content® It will be seen 
that, with few exceptions, the "medium 1 * porosity is low, tending to 
increase slightly with decreasing rank* Hence it appears that most 
Alberta coals contain mainly very small and comparatively large pores* 
These latter are probably gross cracks and fissures in the body of 
the coal, and may be partly or wholly destroyed by grinding the coal 
finely* The nature of the fine pores must form the subject of a 
separate discussion* 

The Fine Porosity of Coals* 

Franklin has suggested that the difficulty with which 
benzene and similar solvents penetrate the pores of coals may be due 
to the presence of numerous fine constrictions in the wider pores, 
having dimensions comparable with those of the solvent molecules 
(5-6 A)® In this case what we have called "fine porosity" need not 
comprise only fine pores, but also larger pores blocked by such fine 
constrictions* It was thought to be of some interest to gain further 
evidence as to the size of these fine pores or constrictions, for 
which purpose a further experiment was undertaken, which may be con¬ 
venient! y reported at this stage* 

If the fine pores or constrictions have dimensions com¬ 
parable with those of the xylene (or benzene) molecule, it was thought 
that tetralin would not penetrate these pores, and no drift would be 
detected in the density of a coal in tetralin* Alternatively, if the

pores were large enough to admit tetralin molecules, the relative ease 
of penetration might be expected to be proportional not only to the 
viscosity and internal pressure of the liquids, but also to a factor 
dependent upon the relative size of the molecules* 

Preliminary experiments showed that there was a drift in the 
tetralin density* Subsequently, 10 g* samples of the same coal (437-48) 
were weighed into 2-50 ml* density bottles, and the bottles half 
filled with xylene and tetralin respectively* They were then evacuated 
in a vacuum dessicator for 1 hr*, and afterwards filled and put in an 
air bath at 30°C for a further hour* After this time excess liquid 
was removed and the bottles were weighed* After a further two hours 
at 30°C they were again filled with solvent at 30°C and weighed* This 
process was repeated* Hence the weight, and so the volume of each 
liquid entering 100 g* of coal in a given time could be calculated* 

The results are shown in Table XVTII* How if conventional flow theorems 
apply, the rate of entry of each liquid should be proportional directly 
to the internal pressure, and inversely to the viscosity and to the 
amount of liquid which has entered the pores* That is, if V is the 
volume of liquid which enters the pores in a given time T, the viscosity 
of the liquid being Yj and its internal pressure P,

experimental value* 

From this it appears that the only factors which influence 
the rate of penetration of xylene and tetralin are the internal pressure 
and the viscosity of these liquids* On the other hand, n-hexane, virhich 
has a low viscosity, but large molecules, penetrates coals much less 
readily than benzene, and it is for this reason that Franklin has 
stated that it is the si?;© of the molecules which mainly determines 
the ease of penetration. The facts seem reconcilable only be taking 
into account the shape of the molecules and of the pores* Benzene, 
xylene and tetralin all have relatively flat molecules, while n-hexane, 
an open chain compound, has not* If it were assumed that the pores, 
or fine constrictions in coals are not circular in section, but flat, 
the comparable ease of penetration of xylene and tetralin may yet be 
reconciled with the difference in the size of the molecules, and the 
difficulty with which n-hexane enters such pores be explained. 

If this is indeed the explanation of these facts, then 
the mean separation of the sides of the pores may be taken to be 
about 12 A p (see page 99) for most coals. If this value applies to

low rank Alberta coals, in which about 50 per cent* of the pore 
space consists of pores of greater diameter than lOy^C, the fine 
pores must have dimensions considerably less than 12 f* separation* 
This would seem to indicate that the slowness with which xylene 
and other similar solvents penetrate coals is due to the presence 
of fine pores rather than frequent constrictions. It seems not 
improbable that these fine pores may in fact be identical with 
intermolecular spaces. 

Conclusions . 

From the data presented above it is possible to form a 
tentative picture of the coal substance as a collection of large, 
flat molecules, separated by fairly rigidly defined distance into 
layer planes, the spaces being at least partially permeable to some 
fluids. It might be supposed that a strongly polar liquid such as 
water might be progressively excluded from such spaces as the mol¬ 
ecules lost their hydrophilic properties with increase of rank, and 
the angle of contact increased. This would account for the drop in 
the density of coals in water with increasing rank up to a certain 
point. Beyond this point, when water could no longer penetrate such 
pores, the density in organic solvents might be expected to equal or 
even exceed that in water - which is indeed the case. 

On a higher level, the molecules may be imagined as organ¬ 
ized in micelles, the internicellar spaces forming a range of more 
open pores. Considering even greater dimensions, a range of gross 
adventitious cracks and fissures may be imagined, perhaps separating 
the petrological constituents of the coal.

GENERAL DISCUSSION

General Discussion 

Additional Data . 

Before discussing more fully the significance of what has 
already been reported in this work, it will be necessary to present 
some additional data* This consists in work on the diffraction of 
X-rays by coals, by Blayden, Gibson and Rileylater with the 
assistance of M* Holahan.^ 0 ^ The results of these workers have 
been borne out and to some extent corrected by Ruston^ 4 ^. 

With the help of X-radiation these workers have been able 
to detect the presence of, and measure the a and c parameters and 
dimensions of crystallites in coals, cokes and chars. At first it 
was assumed that these crystallites were of a graphitic type, but 
more recently it has been shown that their structure is probably 
of a three dimensionally cross-linked aromatic nature* Distinction 
between aromatic and hydroaromatic (or heterocyclic) ring systems 
cannot be made on the basis of the c parameter, since the lattice 
spacings of these types in the c dimension are very similar (about 
3*5 A.)* However Ruston, using corrected a parameters, has shown 
that the hydroaromatic and heterocyclic type probably predominates 
until a fairly high rank is attained, the change over occurring 
in the transition from bituminous coals to anthracites* Further 
the presence of hydroaromatic or heterocyclic ring systems with 
attached functional groups (OH, C02H» etc.) is shown to be probable, 
such crystallites having c parameters between 5 and 6 A 0 • As the 
rank of coals increases, or on carbonization, the quantity of such 









' 








- 128 - 


material decreases* Finally, it has been shown that both the a and 
c dimensions increase- gradually with rank up to the bituminous 
range* Here the size of the crystallites begins to increase more 
rapidly, but while the a dimension continues to increase, the c 
dimension passes through a maximum and subsequently decreases* Also, 
on carbonization of materials ranging from cellulose to anthracites, 
the a dimension grows steadily, but the behaviour of the c dimension 
differs for coals of different rank. Thus cellulose, lignin and 
glycine chars have a c dimension which remains substantially 
constant until, at very high temperatures, an increase is observed* 
Peat and brown coal show a fairly rapid growth in the c dimension 
between 700 and 1000° C* Bituminous coals, on the other hand, 
exhibit a maximum on a c dimension/temperature curve at about 600° C* 
and thereafter a decrease* At 900° C* the values pass through a 
minimum; followed by a pronounced increase with increasing temper¬ 
ature. Vitrain behaves in a similar manner. Fusain however behaves 
like cellulose chars, the c dimension remaining substantially 
constant* Anthracites for the most part show a decrease in the c 
dimension up to 1100° C* followed by a rapid increase. Only the 
c dimension of those anthracites which have probably been formed at 
elevated temperatures remain fairly constant. 

In deciding whether the nature of the crystallites is 
graphitic or otherwise, the evidence of reflectivity and density 
measurements may be of assistance. Se 3 rler has measured the reflec¬ 
tance of graphite by his method, and finds it to be 11 per cent* - 


~ % -

far greater than the reflectivity of the highest rank coals, or even 
of carbonised coals. Even allowing for any lowering which the porous 
nature of the coal substance may cause in its reflectivity, it would 
seem that the high reflectivity of graphite rules it out as the end 
product of the coalification process. In addition to this, the work 
of Frankin shows that a "coal" with zero hydrogen content would be 
expected to have a density of about lo85g./cm.^, while graphite has a 
density of 2.26gm./cm.^ s Even graphite like crystallites with layer 
plane spacing of 3.5 J? (true graphite has layer planes spaced 3,35 A° 
apart) would be expected to have a density of 2.16g./cm.\ This 
would seem to indicate that for true coals either the spacing of 
layer planes in all crystallites is greater than 3.5 if (which is 
contradictory to X-ray findings) or, there is always present some 
material having a layer plane spacing considerably greater than 3.5 A 0 . 

It seems that only upon carbonisation at temperatures in the region 

3 

of 1000° C, does the density of coals approach the value of 2.16g./cm« « 
Theoretical Developments from Seyler t s Work 

The work of Seyler on the reflectivity of coals has already 
been outlined in Part II. From this work certain conclusions may be 
drawn which may be extended to form a basis for the correlation of 
a variety of data on the properties of coals. 

The refractive index of an organic compound is dependent 
only upon; (a) the specific refractivity of the compound - a partly 
additive, partly constitutive property - that is, on the number and 
type of atoms present in it and on their arrangement; (b) the packing 







.o 


o 


; :o '£

of the atoms, and of the molecules in the compound. The first of 
these is partly an additive, partly a constitutive property. Thus, 
if an organic compound undergoes a reaction which causes a marked 
change in refractive index, this change must be due either to a marked 
change in the specific refractivity, or to a change in packing, or in 
both. Now Cannon and George^ 52 ) have shown that the specific re¬ 
fractivity of coals varies little with rank. Consequently, any marked 
change in the refractive index of the coal substance must be due to 
a change in the packing. 

The reflectivity of a substance depends upon: 

(i) its refractive index 
(ii) its absorbtive index 

In the case of bright coals at least, the latter is small 
and has a negligible effect upon the reflectivity. Consequently, any 
marked change in reflectivity must also be due to a change in packing. 
Now the reflectivity of discrete areas of the coal substance has been 
shown to increase with rank discontinuously, such that a reflectivity 
always bears a constant ratio to the next possible value. In view of 
the facts mentioned above, this can be interpreted in only one of two 
ways. 

(1) Successive chemical reactions may be supposed to occur leading to 
a series of typical compounds, the reflectivity of each of which 
bears a constant ratio to its precursor and successor. This hypothesis, 
supposing as it does the successive formation of at least 10 different 
types of compound, v/hose refractive indices must be related in a

complex but definite manner to each other, (for the relation between 
reflectivity and refractivity is not a simple one) is essentially im¬ 
probable* Nor have any facts been found to support it. 

(2) The coal substance may be supposed to be heterogeneous, consisting 
of a mixture of - 

(i) material which has a refractive index comparable to 
that of the oil used as an immersion medium in reflectivity measure¬ 
ments, and whose measured reflectivity is consequently zero or very 
small; 


(ii) material having a higher, fairly definite, refractive 
index, and hence a higher reflectivity. 

If, then, we call these two materials X and Y respectively, 
as the coal substance matures X may be supposed to be converted to Y, 
with consequent increase in reflectivity. Now the reflectivity at 
any stage will be determined by the proportion of Y present, and since 
Seyler has shown that the reflectivity increases in a stepwise manner, 
the quantity of Y present must be supposed to do likewise. The 
proportion of Y present may be related to the reflectivity as follows* 
At the xth stage of the stepwise process, according to 

Seyler, 


Reflectivity, R 0 = KiKg* .... (xxii) 

If we call the quantities of X and Y present at this stage 
Xx and Yx, and suppose Y to have a reflectivity of X, then 
KYx 


Xx + Yx 


K]K2“ 


(xxiii) 






- 132 


We may now predict the quantity of X which will react to 
form Y in passing from one stage to the next. Thus, at the x + 1st 
stage. 


KYx+1 

Xx+1 + Yx+1 


KlK2 x+1 


(xxiv) 


Dividing (xxiv) by (xxiii), 

Yx+1 CXx + Y x ) 
Yx "(Xx+1 + Yx+l) 


(xxv) 


Now if one molecule of Y is formed from one of X (which seems 
probable - and the linking up of Y molecules with one another will 
not alter the case) - 


X x + Y x ” Xx+1 + Yx+1 .... (xxvi) 

So, combining (xxv) and (xxvi), 

Yx+1 = KgYx (xxvii,a) 

Alternatively, 

Yx+1 - Yx = (K2-1) Yx ...... (xxvii,b). 


Thus the amount of Y formed at any stage is seen to be de¬ 
pendant only on the quantity of Y already prese nt at the start of the 
reaction. 


Alternative to the deduction given above that the amount of 
reaction which will occur is dependant on the amount of reaction which 
has occurred up to that point, it may be simply stated that the 
proportion of Y present at any stage is in simple relation with the 
proportion present at the preceeding stage. One is reminded of the 
behaviour of certain interstitial compounds of graphite.In

these compounds, layers of ions are interspersed with the graphite 
layer planes* The quantity of the ion which can be inserted between 
two planes is quite definite* further, a definite series of com¬ 
pounds is formed, depending on the proportion of the spaces between 
the layer planes which are filled with ions. It would be possible to 
picture the coal substance in this way as consisting of a collection 
of crystallites of "Y 1 * molecules, having flat layer planes, and with 
flat "X" molecules interspersed in the layer planes. A series of 
'’compounds** would be formed in this way between the X and Y molecules 
which would readily account for the.occurrence of Seyler’s optical 
series, by determining that the proportion of Y present could only 
assume certain values, simply related to each other* 

This suggests that what have hitherto been called, non- 
coramitally, X and Y may be identified with the crystallites encountered 
in the X-ray work. **Y’* would presumably be crystallites with c 
dimensions of 3*5 A° , and would grow in sizes as the proportion of 
Y increased (though beyond a certain point break up might occur into 
smaller crystallites)* The material encountered with a layer plane 
spacing of 4.5 A° or greater might be supposed to be crystallites of 
“Y w with interspersed **X I * molecules. 

If this is as true picture of the ultimate nature of the 
coal substance it is possible to make certain predictions which will 
be capable of verification. Most important it may be predicted that 
the density, or the porosity of coals, or both, will be related to 
their reflectivity* For the theory outlined above supposes that the

reflectivity is a function of packing, of layer plane spacing, which 
will also partly determine the density (the other factor being the 
volume of the atoms present) providing the layer planes are impermeable 
to the fluid used in the density determination . If the layer planes 
are permeable to the fluid, then it will be the porosity which will be 
related to the reflectivity - the fine porosity necessarily. It 
remains only to determine the particular measures of reflectivity, of 
density, and of porosity which will be comparable. 

It has already been stated that it is suspected that the 
reflectivity of polished blocks as measured in the course of this vrork 
is influenced in a purely mechanical way by the presence of gross 
pores. This v,rould seem to make such a measure of reflectivity un¬ 
suitable for purposes of comparison with density. However, if a 
measure of the density is taken which also takes into account these 
gross pores, a rough comparison should be possible. This density will 
be the density of the coal with all its pores impenetrated by the 
fluid used in measurement. An approximation to this density may be cal- 
culated from a knowledge of the true density and of the volume moisture 
content. 

In Table XIX is listed this density calculated for fifteen 
coals on an ash free basis, and the * total* reflectivity, which, for 
reasons already given, is taken to be the most reliable measure of the 
reflectivity of a polished surface. In Figure 27 reflectivity is 
plotted against density. 

The relationship obtained is not striking. Through all 
but three of the points a straight line my be fairly drawn, but these 
three points diverge widely from such a line. Either the theory

deduced is incorrect, or else measurements of the reflectivity and/or 
density of these coals are unrepresentative or incorrect. It must 
be remembered also in this connection that the density is determined 
not only by the molecular packing, but also by the volumes and 
proportions of the atoms present - chiefly os the hydrogen content*

Since this is not taken into account, it may cause some deviation of 
the points from the line. 

For further light on this subject we must turn to the powder 
reflectivities of the coals, as being completely representative 
of the coal sample. It will be remembered that it was suspected 
that the powder reflectivity is uninfluenced by the presence of 
gross pores. Some support for this may be adduced from Figure 28, 
where the difference between total and powder reflectivity (expressed 
as a percentage of the reflectivity of coal 440-48) is plotted against 
gross porosity. Though no striking relationship is apparent, a 
roughly linear relation between the two quantities may be observed. 

It is, perhaps, not insignificant that the two coals which diverge 
most markedly from the mean line are two of the three coals which 
do not obey the relationship between reflectivity and density. If, 
in fact, the powder reflectivity is reliable, it would seem that the 
measurements of the reflectivity of polished blocks of these coals 
are unrepresentative. 

How since the density of a coal is related to the hydrogen 
content as well as to the packing of the molecules, and consequently 
is not a function of the reflectivity alone, it is more likely that 
a relationship will be found between fine porosity and reflectivity 
if water penetrates between the layer planes. That the shape and 
dimensions of the fine pores permeable to water but not to xylene 
in low rank coals are compatible with their being inter-molecular

spaces has already been shown in the discussion section of Part III* 

In Figure 29 the powder reflectivities of some 35 Alberta 
coals are plotted against fine porosity. Through these points may 
be drawn a straight line, the deviation of points from the line 
being little greater than the experimental error. This, indeed, is 
striking confirmation of the theoretical deductions which have been 
made above* It also seems to indicate that the powder reflectivity 
is an excellent measure of the optical properties of a coal: the 
reflectivity of a polished block by the methods used here is at the 
same time indicated as unreliable. 

That the relationship holds only up to bituminous rank, and 
perhaps somewhat beyond, seems probable* The porosity of higher 
rank coals increases again after passing through a minimum, and there 
is every reason to believe that the powder reflectivity would still 
increase with rank rather than decrease* The reason for the cessation 
of the relationship is not far to seek* It is most unlikely In view 
of the low porosity of bituminous coals that the layer planes in 
such coals are more than very slightly, if at all, pervious to 
water* It would seem that the permeability decreases with the loss 
of hydrophilic properties by the coal substance. Consequently the 
porosity ceases to be a measure of the layer plane spacing, and so 
of the reflectivity* So long as the layer planes remain partially 
permeable to water, however, the relationship holds. This, of course, 
supposes a linear relation between rank and hydrophilic properties - 
a not unlikely supposition*

The fact that the fine porosity is related to the reflecti¬ 
vity implies that it, too, changes in a stepwise manner* This effect 
will be masked by the fact that most coals consist of a mixture of 
several of Seyler*s components* A stepwise progression of the fine 
porosity cannot, in fact, be marked for the 35 coals examined* 

However, the fine porosity contributes to the total porosity, 
measured by the moisture content, and a large number of coal samples 
ha-ve been examined for moisture content* Dealing with large numbers 
of coals, the stepwise progression might be expected to become apparent* 
It has already been shown in Part I that the capacity moisture of 
Alberta coals decreases in a stepwise manner with increasing rank - 
added confirmation of the theory given above* 

To collect the impressions we have gained, then, from 
experimental data and theoretical deduction, coal may be pictured as 
consisting of crystallites, composed of large, flat molecules 
arranged in layer planes with a spacing of 3*5 Interspersed 
between the layer planes are large, flat molecules of a different 
type, probably distinguished by the possession of polar groups, and 
of greater lattice spacing* For low rank coals these layer planes 
are permeable to water, but with increasing rank, as polar groupings 
are lost by the molecules, become increasingly impermeable* Again 
with increasing rank the second type of molecules become converted 
to the first in a stepwise manner, due to the tendency for definite 
interstitial compounds to be formed between the two types of molecule*

The Chemical Nature of the Coal Substance : Humic Acids 

With this general picture of the physical structure of the 
coal substance in mind, it remains to examine the chemical nature 
of the coal substance. Unfortunately the structure of the humic acids, 
the precursors of coals, remains an unsolved mystery. However, while 
no formulae may as yet be proved for such compounds, it is, the author 
believes, possible to make intelligent guesses, for we know something 
of the constitution of the materials from which humic acids are 
formed, and we also know a variety of their reactions, and their 
approximate elementary composition* 

The development of suchintelligent guesses” would demand a 
lengthy account of the studies made by the author on the known 
properties of cellulose, lignin, and the humic acids. This is beyond 
the scope of the present work, and has been reviewed elsewhere.* It 
will be sufficient for the present purpose to present the conclusions 
drawn from such a study. 


It is believed that the properties of the humic acids and 
their formation from vegetable tissues in peat swamps may be best 
explained by the postulation of a structural formula of which I is

Substance 1 , 1 a brochure by the author, (unpublished), pp. 1 to 16 0

Such compounds can be readily imagined to be formed from both 
cellulose and lignin under appropriate conditions, and the properties 
expected of a compoundwith such a formula agree well with the known 
properties of the humic acids. Such molecules may be imagined to 
associate strongly by virtue of their amphoteric nature, forming 
complexes of high molecular weight and colloidal properties* 

If such compounds can be shown capable of undergoing a 
series of reactions which will account for the changes which occur 
in the coal substance both on coalification and carbonization an 
additional point will have been registered in their favour. 

The shape of the coal band may be accounted for, as certain 
authors have pointed out,(^) by the loss from the coal substance of 
water and carbon dioxide in the early stages, followed by loss of 
methane and carbon dioxide in the bituminous range. Evidence of this 
change over in type of reaction may be seen in the shape of the coal 
band, and in the break which occurs in carbon/oxygen and hydrogen 
/oxygen percentage plots, and more direct support is found in the 
presence of considerable quantities of methane in bituminous coal 
mines. If we take as typical of starting material the structure I, 
which may be assumed to be linked to other such molecules in planes 
by virtue of its amphoteric properties (or even more strongly by 
ester and ether linkages), we may propose as a scheme of decomposition 
for it the following reactions, 

(1) loss of carbon dioxide by elimination of the carboxyl groups. 

(2) loss of water by elimination of hydroxyls, with formation of 


■

double bonds, and 

(3) elimination of the pyrane ring. 

This last may be imagined to take place with elimination of carbon 
dioxide and methane, or with loss of carbon monoxide. More explicitly: 
(a) under alkaline conditions an oxoniura base will be formed - 

/V/°\+>OH 



(if the adjacent hydroxyl group has been previously eliminated, the 
total reaction so far as percentage composition is concerned, may be 
regarded as a shift of the hydroxyl group). 

This may decompose with opening of the pyrane ring. 



or (b) alternatively, with the formation of a furane ring. 




+co

It may be stated that, while these changes are by no means 
conventional organic reactions, little data are available on the 
decomposition of this type of compound, and so reasonable assumptions 
may be made. In support of the last reaction pictured, it is 
known that coumarin loses carbon monoxide to form coumarone in 
good yield at temperatures of 860 to 880°C., a reaction which open 
chain ketones do not undergo. Thus mechanism (b) may be 

supposed to occur on carbonization of material containing such 
compounds as T • 

The final product of reaction (a) will “be an anthracene 
derivative, more or less unsaturated according to the unsaturation 
of the original material. Thus if the original molecule contains 
two or less double bonds, the product will be hydroaromatic; with 
three double bonds, aromatic. Any greater degree of unsaturation 
(and it is most likely that humic materials are more unsaturated) 
will give eventually aromatic molecules with free valencies which 
will immediately link up at normal temperatures to form planes, 
possibly cross linked to other similar planes. On the other hand 
the intermediate in the reaction before loss of methane (but after 
loss of carbon dioxide) will not have free valencies unless the 
original material had more than six double bonds. Thus humic acids 
with four, five and six double bonds will give rise first to a 
molecule of quite low molecular weight, and subsequently to a cross 
linked, extended aromatic structure. In this we may look for an

explanation of the development of coking and agglomerating properties 
in coals. Providing the original material was not oxidized (de¬ 
hydrogenated) beyond a certain point, during its subsequent coalifi- 
cation low melting material may accumulate, and subsequently be 
bound into a rigid form* 

We can now link up this theory with that previously outlined* 
Humic acids and all intermediates in their decomposition which contain 
polar groups may be identified with the material hitherto known as 
"X", and products without polar groups as U Y U • (For reaction (a), 

"Y" compounds will contain no oxygen)* Any combination of, or all 
reactions designated by (1)(2) and (3)(a) and (b) may be supposed to 
occur at the same time, with the proviso that complete loss of polar 
groups is a stepwise, controlling reaction* Considering normal 
coalification — reactions (1), (2) and (3)(a), it seems likely that 
only (3)(a) must necessarily be stepwise, resulting in a change of 
lattice dimensions, and that there must occur previous loss of carbon 
dioxide and water from carboxyl and hydroxyl groups* 

This scheme of reactions, together with dehydrogenation 
which may be supposed to occur in high rank coals and on carbonization 
above certain temperatures, can readily explain the processes of 
coalification and carbonization* In normal coalification, a continuous 
loss of C02 and H 2 O may be supposed by reactions (1) and (2) down to 
butuminous rank, accompanied by the periodic intervention of reaction 
(3)(a)* For acids containing 5 and 6 double bonds reaction (3)(a)

will give anthracene derivatives with no unsatisfied valencies which, 
by loss of methane (which we may call reaction (4)) will give rise to 
compounds which must polymerise in order to satisfy valency consider¬ 
ations e In this, together with final loss of all carboxyl and hydroxyl 
groups by the time bituminous rank is reached with consequent loss of 
associative properties, we may look for an explanation of the develop¬ 
ment of coking properties, followed by their decay as methane is elim¬ 
inated* It may be noted that humic acids with five and six double 
bonds are those whose lines of decomposition would most nearly approach 
the course of the normal coal band for bright coals* 

Carbonization, on the other hand, may be supposed to take 
place mainly by reaction (3)(b), which is known to occur in comparable 
compounds at elevated temperatures, accompanied by dehydrogenation* 

If slow heating were used, reaction (3)$a) might also be supposed to 
occur., Thus , on carbonization some of the oxygen will be retained in 
the coke, probably up to fairly high temperatures* The reaction (3)(b), 
presumably taking place with a change in lattice dimensions, may be 
supposed to be stepwise* However, in the case of carbonization, where 
conditions are more rigorous than those under which coalification 
takes place, it seems probable that the reaction would proceed to 
completion, all f X f compounds being eliminated, and the limit of 
Seyler T s optical series being exceeded* A new product (’oCcoke 1 ), 
consisting of "pure” Y compounds, may be supposed to be formed. 

It must be emphasized that this interpretation of the chemical 
nature of the coal substance is speculative in that only indirect 
evidence as to its truth can be cited* It does, however, rest upon 
such facts as are known about the chemical nature of the humic acids

and the coal substance, and it does provide a means of relating and 
explaining the facts which are known about the processes of coalif- 
ication and carbonization* Taken together with the theories on the 
physical structure of the coal substance, for the relative truth of 
which some evidence has been presented in these pages, it provides a 
means of relating phenomena hitherto linked only by empirical means, 
and may serve as a basis for experiment which may further elucidate 
the intricate problems connected with ttoer ultimate nature of the

Part i* 

By graphical means the coals of Alberta are shown in their 
relation to other coals. Analytical data for Alberta coals lend them¬ 
selves to the use of formulae for the calculation of the volatile 
matter and calorific value. The calculated and determined values show 
only minor deviations. The coal band for Alberta coals, however, 
deviates from those described by Seyler and by Mott. This deviation 
can be only partly accounted for by the petrological constitution of 
the coals. The capacity moisture content of the low rank coals tends 
to assume certain definite values, and a.plot of carbon content against 
capacity moisture content shows a stepwise progression. 

The bearing of these data upon the classification of Alberta 
coals is discussed. 


Part II. 

Measurements are made on the reflectivity of both polished 
block and powder samples of Alberta coals* The relationship between 
powder reflectivity and the reflectivity of polished blocks is 
discussed, and the effect of gross porosity on reflectivity is noted. 

Part ill. 

The true and apparent densities and the density in xylene 
of a number of Alberta coals are measured, and the porosity calculated. 
The true density is related to the elementary composition. The size 
and distribution of the pores present are assessed, and the significance 
of these observations is discussed* The fine porosity is believod to

General Discussion# 

From the data presented in the proceeding sections, and with 
the addition of further evidence from X-ray diffraction work, a theory 
is formed as to the ultimate nature of the coal substance. It is 
believed that coals consist of an agglomerate of crystallites, whose 
lattice parameters determine the optical properties of coals, and 
partly determine the density and porosity. The chemical nature of 
the molecules composing these crystallites is discussed, and some 
views are expressed as to their probable structure.
