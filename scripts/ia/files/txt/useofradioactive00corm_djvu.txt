INTRODUCTION 


The land surface of Alberta may be divided roughly 
into several major soil zones, each of which may be considered 
separately in relation to farming operations and soil fertility. 

The wooded or gray soil zone is the largest of these and covers 
about two thirds of the entire province. Gray soils, like 
these, which have developed for a long period of time under 
forest conditions have usually been subject to more severe 
leaching than soils which have developed under grass or prairie 
conditions. Because of their leached nature the gray wooded 
soils are generally rather low in natural fertility* 

In order to investigate the fertilizer requirements of 
gray wooded soils experiments have been conducted by the Soils 
Department of the University of Alberta. These experiments 
come chiefly under two headings: {1) Those carried out on the 
Soils Department plots at Breton, and (2) Co-operative experi¬ 
ments with farmers* These experiments and others have clearly 
indicated that a large proportion of the gray wooded soils in 
Alberta have a serious sulphur deficiency for some crops* On 
sulphur deficient soils yields of legume crops are greatly In¬ 
creased (sometimes over %OQffo) by application of sulphate fer¬ 
tilizers. Direct application of sulphate fertilizers has very 
little, if any, beneficial effect on cereal crops or grasses 9 
However, application of sulphate fertilizers to legume crops 
produces substantial increases in the yields of subsequent cereals*

All fertilizers containing a high percentage of sulphur 
have given these results when used on sulphur deficient gray 
soils. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate with added ammonium 
sulphate ( 16 - 20 - 0 ), ammonium sulphate (21-0-0), ammoniated 
superphosphate (2-20-0), sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate 
and gypsum have all given large increases in the yields of 
legumes such as altaswede clover and alfalfa. The yields of 
cereals following the legumes have been greatly improved. A 
beneficial residual effect lasting for several years has gener¬ 
ally been obtained when sulphur fertilizers were applied to 
clover and alfalfa (13)# 

Analyses of crops from the Soils Department f s plots 
at Breton have shown that sulphur fertilization has increased 
the sulphur content of crops there (15)* However, the amount 
of the applied sulphur taken up by the crops and the proportion 
of sulphur in crops coming from the applied fertilizers could 
not b© determined. 

In order to obtain more direct information concerning 
these matters it was decided to carry out experiments using a 
sulphate fertilizer labelled with radioactive sulphur. The 
project, on which this report is being made, was conducted 
under the combined direction of the Department of Physics and 
the Department of Soils of the University of Alberta. The 
Physics Department was concerned with obtaining and measuring 
the activity of the radioactive sulphur while the Soils Depart¬ 
ment supervised the actual field work and the interpretation 
of the results obtained#

REVIEW OP LITERATURE 


The normal isotopic composition of sulphur consists 

of S 32 (95$), S 33 s 3 ^ (4.2$), and S 36 (0.0l6%) (18). 

Radioactive forms of sulphur of mass number 31, 35 and 37 have 

11 

all been investigated* S*^ is a positron emitter with a half 
life of 3*2 seconds* s 3 * is a negatron emitter (T_| = 87 ©X days) 
having a maximum energy of 0,17 million electron volts (8,9,^8)« 
S 37, discovered more recently, is also a beta emitter and has a 
half life of 5*0l|. seconds (10), It is apparent that is the 

only isotope of sulphur suitable for use as a radioactive tracer. 

Of the several ways of producing S-^b (9^10) the most 
common at the present time is by neutron irradiation of chlorine 
according to the reaction (n,p* The decays, 

as mentioned before, by negatron emission with no appreciable 
gamma radiation. Measurement of the radiations of such radio¬ 
active isotopes has been discussed by many workers (4, 8, 12, 17), 
the method of Coryell (4) being the one most closely followed In 
the present work. 

The long half life of makes it especially suitable 
for use in such researches as the present one In which the 
experimental procedure is carried out over a comparatively long 
period of time. This was early recognized when S^5 was used 
in the study of vitamin B and protein metabolism In animals (20), 
The first use of i n studies of plant metabolism and the 

fate of fertilizers was reported by Thomas in 1944 (21)« Exten-

sive experiments were carried out on plots of grain treated 
both with Na 2 S*K)j^ and In a previous paper (8) these 

workers describe their technique for measuring the activity 
of precipitated BaS-*0^ samples * Radioautographs were also 
taken (7) to show the distribution of the in the wheat 

kernels. The study of fertilizers using radiophosphorus has 
been quite extensive (2, 3, 19 ) and rather similar methods 
can be employee/ using 

Although some experiments have been carried out in an 
attempt to define possible damage to plants by the more energetic 
beta emitters such as P 32 ( 16 ) no information was available 
on possible metabolic disturbances caused by the radiation from 
s3 ^ 0 In this work it has been assumed, as is common in tracer 
experiments, that the concentrations of the radioactive isotope 
were so small that no significant changes would occur in the 
metabolism of the plants« 

The preferential uptake of radioactive isotopes because 
of a disturbance of the isotopic equilibrium has been described 
by Overstreet and Broyer (lip) * Although this may be an important 
consideration in the initial uptake of sulphur from the soil 
it becomes increasingly negligible as the total sulphur taken 
up becomes much larger than the quantity of sulphur originally 
present in the plant e The method of analysis used in the ?/ork 
here reported gives a direct measure of the fraction of the 
available sulphur in the soil which is attributable to the 
applied fertilizer* If we assume that no sulphur was initially 
present in the plant, this gives the fraction of the sulphur

in the plant which came from the fertilizer* 

The effects of sulphur fertilizers on gray wooded soils 

in Alberta have been reviewed by Newton and co-workers (13), 

and Peters (l£). Besides containing the results of experiments 

thesis 

carried out in Alberta, Peters 1 pap er- contains references to 
investigations on similar sulphur deficient soils in various 
parts of North America. *^t has frequently been observed that 
if wheat or another cereal follows a good crop of clover fer¬ 
tilized with ammonium sulphate or ammonium phosphate (contain¬ 
ing sulphate) the grain yield is increased far more than is 
the case when the same fertilizers are applied directly to 


the cereal

OUTLINE OF INVESTIGATION 


The radioactive sulphur to be used as the tracer was 
obtained as carrier-free In separate one mlllicurie 

shipments from the Chalk River plant of the National Research 
Council. Handling the radioactive material with the approved 
precautions, each shipment of was mixed thoroughly with 

sufficient chemically pure Na-^SO^ to fertilize ten square yards. 
In the field the various fertilizer solutions were applied by 
hand to 10 one square yard plots. Specific details concerning 
these applications follow:

Altaswede clover being kept separate. A six Inch strip was 
harvested from each barley plot. In each ease all miscellaneous 
foreign plants were removed from the samples. Check samples

were taken from square yards immediately adjacent to the 
fertilized plots in order to obtain a control for each fer¬ 
tilized plot* At the time of the first sampling there had been 
practically no rainfall in 1949 an< ^ the growth of crops, especi¬ 
ally of the barley, was very poor* Yield data were obtained by 
taking the air dry weight of each sample* 

The second collection of samples took place on August 
2lj.-25, 19 ^ 9 # under moisture conditions almost/, opposite of those 
of the first sampling* A great deal of rain had fallen during 
the intervening time, especially in the period July 16-18* The 
samples were taken as before except the checks which were taken 
from square yards separated about a foot from the fertilized 
plots. Another six inch strip was harvested from each square 
yard of barley* 

By comparing the radioactivity of the field samples with 

those of samples from the original fertilizer material, it is 

possible to determine the fraction of the sulphur in the plant 

which came from the fertilizer* Suppose a quantity of S 

having an activity of H a w counts per minute is combined with f, b lf 

gm. of ordinary sulphur which is to b© applied to the soil* 

The ratio |L is called the specific activity of the mixture* If 

the plant, in taking up sulphur from the soil, takes n b M gm* 

from the fertilizer for every "c” gm. originally present in the 

soil, the specific activity will be reduced to _The 

b sr c 

specific activities « and — may be determined analytically 
and by division the fraction of sulphur coming from the fertilizer

METHODS OF ANALYSIS 


1o The Counting Apparatus 

In order to determine specific activity, samples con- 
taining S were precipitated in the form of BaSO^ and were then 
transferred to nickel-plated steel dishes, or pian diets. These 
planchets were placed in the recess of a l/8 in* aluminum plate 
which was slid beneath the thin (1*8 mg. per cm. ) window of 
a Tracerlab TGC-2 G.M* counter tube shielded by a lead castle® 
Regulated voltage was applied to the counter by means of a power 
supply and voltage stabilizer® After amplification by an 
N*R.C. type pre-amplifier the pulses were recorded using a con¬ 
ventional scale-of-6i|- scaler and mechanical register* Reproduc¬ 
ible geometry of the planchet with respect to the window of the 
G.M* counter was achieved by the use of guides for the aluminum 
plate at various distances from the window® The shielding by 
the lead and aluminum of the castle cut down the background 
count to about 30 counts per minute® The resolving time of the 
tube was determined by the method described by Lapp and Andrews 
(12) to be 5 x 10*° minutes*

2* Self Absorption 

One of the most important factors to be considered in 
the use of such low energy beta emitters as is the absorption 

of radiation by the carrier precipitate* The first attempt to 
correct for this was made by precipitating various amounts of a 
homogeneous solution of 8^5 in Na^SOj^ carrier* The Na2S#0j^ 
solution used was, in this case, some of the stock solution from 
one of the applications of fertilizer* Expressing the specific 
activity as counts per minute per milligram of BaSOj^ precipitate 
and plotting this figure against weight of BaSOj^ the graph shown 
in Pig* 2 was obtained* This curve was used to prepare a 
correction curve for self absorption (Fig® 3)* However, using 
samples of this size (10-30 mg.), it was very difficult to 
obtain reproducible results, and when duplicate determinations 
were mad© on certain of the field samples considerable variation 
was found. This is illustrated by the following data for % fer¬ 
tilizer sulphur in a set of samples®

This variability is probably due to failure to obtain layers of

self absorption properties* The differences in the weights of 


precipitates are believed due to the difficulty in handling such 
minute quantities of precipitate* However, the variability might 
also be due to inaccuracies of the correction curve. In any case. 


the results obtained were unsatisfactory*

In view of this difficulty it was decided to use samples 
such that radiation from the lower layers of precipitate were 
completely absorbed by the upper layers. This is achieved by 
increasing the amount of precipitate until a maximum counting 
rate for a given material is obtained (Pig. 5). Such samples 
are generally referred to as thick samples and were determined 
to have a minimum thickness of l6 mg. per sq. cm. for the BaSOj^ 
precipitates. Surface irregularities of the precipitate in the 
planchets are much less important in these samples. A series 
of samples was made up to check the relation between the thick 
sample counting rate and the specific activity (Pig. I|_) . Since 
this relation is linear the calculations using the thick sample 
method are very simple® The fraction of the sulphur coming from 

the fertilizer may be found by a direct comparison of the thick 

<*, 

sample counting rates for field samples with the counting rates 
of the corresponding standards. 

3 • Preparation of Samples for Counting, 

For analysis approximately 11 gm. of air dry plant 
material from each plot was oven dried in a weighed aluminum 
container. The dried samples were weighed and then ashed with 
HNO^ and HCIO^ following the method of Gieseking (6). The ashed 
material was treated with HC1 to destroy chlorates (11) and was 
finally taken up in HC1 approximately Q.3N. After filtering, 
the solutions were stored in 500 ml. volumetric flasks. 

For the preliminary analysis of the field samples, £0 
or 100 ml* aliquots were removed from these solutions and pre-

cipitated with 10% BaCl 2 to give a fine precipitate of BaSO^. 

The precipitates were transferred quantitatively to centrifuge 
tubes, centrifuged, washed with water and finally washed with 
ethyl alcohol to remove the water* Nearly all the final alcohol 
wash was drawn off before the suspended precipitate was transferred 
as quantitatively as possible to weighed planchets by use of 
special "dropper” tubes* In the planchet a uniform suspension 
of precipitate in the alcohol was obtained by churning the material 
with the "dropper"* This produced an even distribution of pre¬ 
cipitate on the bottom of the planchet* The alcohol was evapor¬ 
ated under a heat lamp* 

When analyses were being made by correcting for self 
absorption the following procedure was used* Standard samples 
from the stock solutions of applied fertilizers were precipitated 
and transferred in a similar way to give precipitates of about 
the same weight as those from the field samples* After weighing, 
the field samples were counted against the standards• A count 
on a standard was mad© at the beginning and at the end of each 
set of five field samples* After correcting for resolving time, 
background and self absorption, the specific activities of the 
field samples and of the standards were calculated and the frac¬ 
tion of the sulphur coming from the fertilizer was determined* 

When it was decided to adopt the thick sample method of 
determining specific activity, the entire remaining solution of 
ashed material was precipitated and counted against thick samples 
from the standard stock solutions. The plot of counts per minute 
for thick samples of various specific activities showed a linear

relationship so, after correction for background, the fraction 
of sulphur from fertilizer was found directly by division. 
However, there were insufficient amounts of precipitate from 
some samples to be considered as “thick” samples and in such 
cases an appropriate correction was applied (Fig. 6)* In order 
to obtain a more reliable determination of the total sulphur 
content the BaSO^ precipitate was weighed in the centrifuge 
tubes before transferring to planchets. 

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 


Since the time available for analysis was somewhat limited 
only 5 of the 10 field samples from each of the various treat¬ 
ments were analysed for s35* Results were obtained for 12 sets 
of samples from plots fertilized with Na^S^Qj^ and from 12 sets 
of corresponding check samples. Each of these samples was analyzed 
by the methods described and typical values of a set of samples 
from one treatment are shown in Table I. The yields are given 
in gm. of air dry material per square yard while the percent 
sulphur figures are reported on the basis of the oven dry weight 
of the sample analyzed. The activities of samples and standards 
are the observed counting rates for thick samples of BaSOj^ cor¬ 
rected for background and self absorption where necessary using 
the correction curve of Fig. 6. 

Tables II and III report only average values for each 
set of 5 samples from a particular treatment. At the time of 
writing the analysis of the barley collected at harvest time had

not been completed• However, yield data for this sampling of 
barley are shown in Table IV, Table V shows the amount of sul¬ 
phur which the various plants obtained from the soil. This was 
found by subtracting the fertilizer sulphur uptake from the total 
sulphur uptake• 

It will be seen from these tables that some of the check 
or control plots show appreciable uptake of fertilizer. This 
effect is generally more pronounced for the second sampling than 
for the first in spite of the stricter precautions which were 
taken at that time to guard against it. It is believed that the 
unusually heavy rainfall between the two sampling dates caused 
the unexpected lateral movement of fertilizer. 

The amounts of sulphur taken up from the fertilizer on 
each square yard was found from the yield data and from the 
figures for percentage of fertilizer sulphur. As the sulphur 
had been applied at the rate of 22.6 lb. per acre or 2.12 gm. 
per sq. yd. (except for the second application) it was possible 
to determine the fraction of the applied sulphur which was re- 


covered in the 

crop. The

about 2.5 lb• per acre. The more typical figures reported by 
Peters show an average yearly uptake of 7*5 lbs. per acre on 
Plot 10 by clovers. 

Using the percentage of sulphur for the unfertilized 
legumes on Plot 10 as determined in this study, and applying that 
figure to hay yields reported by Newton et al ♦ (13) for the 
period 19 tfO~ij _6 the average hay crop would remove about 5»7 lbs. 
of sulphur per acre. Annual applications of 75 lbs. per acre 
of 16 - 20-0 (10.5 lbs. of sulphur per acre) would supply more than 
this amount of sulphur. However, semi annual applications as 
now applied to the Breton plots would hardly supply the sulphur 
needs of the legume hay crop. Inadequate data do not permit si¬ 
milar calculations for other crops. Peters f figures indicate a 
sulphur removal considerably in excess of this application. 

In order to show some of this information more clearly 
the % S, yield and uptake data are presented graphically in 
Figs. 7-12. 

The accuracy in determining the percent fertilizer sulphur 
in any one of the field samples was estimated from the results 
from various standards using thick samples. The maximum variation 
between duplicate standards was 2.% so the accuracy in the reported 
values of specific activity for field samples may also be taken 
as being at least within 2$. In view of the biological fluctua¬ 
tions between square yard plots of the same treatment, it was 
not thought necessary to try to attain any greater degree of 


accuracy

DISCUSSION OP RESULTS 


The results reported in this paper were obtained from 
the analysis of crops grown during a single season, 19 ^ 9 * 

Since the seasonal fluctuations in yields and sulphur percent¬ 
ages are rather large, it might well be expected that other 
similar determinations would also vary considerably from season 
to season. This limitation of the value of the results obtained 
must be kept in mind in drawing any conclusions from them. The 
season, itself, was rather an unusual one, being made up of a 
prolonged period of drought followed by one of extremely heavy 
rains » 

Prom a consideration of the total sulphur content of 
the plant material from the various plots certain general con¬ 
clusions can be drawn. The values found for percent sulphur 
were generally considerably lower than corresponding figures 
reported by Peters (lf>) for 19lf0 and 19 I 4 -I♦ However, Peters 1 
results may possibly have been affected by the presence of weeds 
and other miscellaneous plant material not included in the 
materials analyzed in this study® No comparison has been mad© 
of relative accuracies of the magnesium nitrate method as used 
by Peters and the nitric-perchloric method used in the present 
investigation. 

On Plot 10, alfalfa was found to b© consistently higher 
in sulphur content than Altaswede clover, while on Plot 11, 
not previously fertilized, the clover contained a higher percent¬ 
age of sulphur than did the alfalfa. This was found in plant

material taken at both sampling dates* These differences, 
however, were rather small and most of them were not statis¬ 
tically significant. In nearly all cases barley on Plot 11 
contained a higher percentage of sulphur than did barley on 
Plot 10 for both check and fertilized plots. Again the differ¬ 
ences are not generally statistically significant but they are 
nevertheless rather surprising since Plot 10 had received pre¬ 
vious sulphur fertilizer. 

The sulphur content of alfalfa and clover grown on 
Plot 11, and of all barley samples was lower at the time of 
the second sampling than it was when the first samples were 
taken. This might have been expected since in the period of 
rapid growth following the heavy July rains the general level 
of mineral content would tend to be lower than it would during 
a drought period such as the one preceding the first sampling. 
However, the percentage of sulphur in both alfalfa and clover 
on Plot 10 increased during the period between the samplings. 

This might possibly be due to the plants being more vigorous 
and deeply rooted as a result of previous fertilization of 
this plot. 

Much information can be obtained by a study of the results 
of the radioactivity measurements. This was the main purpose 
of the present investigations since all the foregoing results 
could have been obtained by purely chemical methods. 

Of the total sulphur taken up by the plants, a large 
proportion was found to come from the applied fertilizer. This 
fraction varied from 30 % to Q0% in the samples analyzed. It is

interesting to note that the highest percent of sulphur coming 
from the fertilizer (79*3$) corresponds to the greatest increase 
in yield ( 4 00 %). 

In all plots the fraction of sulphur from fertilizer 
was greater in Plot 11 than in Plot 10, This was to be expected 
since the previous fertilization of Plot 10 had presumably left 
a residual quantity of available sulphur in the soil which, by 
the method of analysis used, would appear as sulphur from the 
soil rather than sulphur from fertilizer. 

Perhaps the most surprising result was the amount of 
fertilizer sulphur taken up by the barley. Previous work, 
described earlier in this report, indicated that direct applica¬ 
tion of sulphur fertilizers did not produce important or very 
significant increases in the yield of cereals and it might have 
been supposed that barley would not take up much sulphur from 
the applied fertilizer. However, the results indicate that the 
uptake of fertilizer by the barley compared favorably with the 
uptake by the legumes both in percent of sulphur from fertilizer 
and in total uptake, Effects of the sulphur fertilization on 
barley yields were somewhat variable. At the time of the first 
sampling, there were slight decreases in the yield on the fer¬ 
tilized plots of both Plot 11 and Plot 10, but these differences 
were not statistically significant. Yields at the second sampling 
showed slight, non-significant increases. The larger Increase 
was on Plot 11 which had received no previous fertilizer since 
1930* Yields at harvest time showed increases on both plots, 
the large Increase on Plot 11 being highly significant whereas

the increase on Plot 10 was not significant* However, these 
increases did not affect the grain yield (see Table IV) and in 
terms of crop production were unimportant. 

Figure 13 shows that the amount of sulphur taken from 
the soil by the legumes is about the same for the fertilized 
plots as it is for the corresponding checks. In the barley 
plots, however, the amount of soil sulphur in the plants seems 
to be definitely lower in the fertilized plots, This may have 
been due to fertilizer sulphur having been more readily avail¬ 
able to barley than was the soil sulphur. 

The graphs of Figures 8 , 10 and 12 show the amount of 
fertilizer taken up per square yard by each of the various 
crops. The alfalfa and Altaswede clover took up a great deal 
more sulphur from the fertilizer in the period between sampl¬ 
ings than they had before the first cutting. This was to be 
expected for a number of reasons. In all cases the length of 
time between cuttings was greater than that bet ween the applica¬ 
tion of fertilizer and the first sampling. The rapid growth of 
the plants and the increase in soil moisture would both tend to 
Increase the uptake of the fertilizer. In the chart for the 
barley plots the amount of fertilizer sulphur taken up between 
samplings is represented by the difference between the values 
for the first and second samplings. These graphs indicate that 
more than half the total uptake occurred before the first sampl¬ 
ing. This is particularly noteworthy for Plot 10 since the 
fertilizer was applied less than three weeks before the first 
collection of samples. The graphs also show that the uptake 
of fertilizer sulphur by clover was greater on the previously

fertilized B-1C plots while the uptake by alfalfa was greater 
on the B-31 plots. 

In nearly all cases, the application of Na^SO^ fertilizer 
resulted in increases in the yields of legumes. For the samples 
taken at the second cutting these increases are large and 
statistically highly significant. The percentage increases, 
however, are generally considerably lower than the average 
figures reported by Peters (15>). This is probably due to the 
unusual nature of the 19^9 growing season. 


SUMMARY 


Sodium sulphate was labelled with radioactive sulphur, 
s35^ in order to trace the uptake of fertilizer by plants groiv- 
ing on a sulphur deficient soil. Harvested plant materials 
were ashed and dissolved before precipitating the sulphur as 
BaSOj^ and measuring its activity with a G.M. counter. This 
enabled the determination of the fraction of sulphur coming 
from the fertilizer and the total fertilizer sulphur taken by 
the plants. 

Results show that for alfalfa, Altaswede clover and 
barley the amount of sulphur taken up from the fertilizer 
accounted for a large proportion of the total sulphur found In 
the plant material. On plots which had received no previous 
sulphur fertilizer this proportion was more than 50 % 9 while 
on plots previously fertilized with 16 - 20-0 the percentage 
was somewhat lower. The application of fertilizer produced

considerable increases in the legume yields but rather small
