SYNOPSIS OF TH E THESIS 

The purpose of this survey is to review the methods that 
have been used in beginning instruction in reading from 1900 to 
1950 to determine the major changes in methods of teaching be¬ 
ginners to read during that period. 

A survey of the classifications by educators provides a list 
of the various methods and assists in determining a basis for 
classifying the methods studied. A description of each major 
method with examples of its application, an outline of its history, 
a statement of its basis, an evaluation of its strengths and weak¬ 
nesses and a summary of its special contribution are derived from 
a review of the literature on reading methodology* The review of 
changes in methods of beginning instruction and of the trends in 
reading methodology serves to delineate the characteristics of the 
present-day approach and provides a background for a better under¬ 
standing of its evolution and its value. 

The survey reveals the influence exerted on methodology by 
the objectives of reading instruction. It points out that different 
methods achieve different results and reveals the difficulties this 
involved in rating methods apart from objectives. It emphasizes the 
effect on methods of a developing concept of the complexity of the 
reading process and the variety and subtlety of the skills involved. 
The increasing influence of educational research and psychology on 
methodology and the technical advances that have affected the con¬ 
struction of reading materials appear to be significant changes.

The desirability of gradual change without going to extremes 
is a significant conclusion from the study. The main trends 
appear to be toward: 

(1) broadened objectives 

( 2 ) the use of composite-eclectic methods 

(3) an increase in the application of highly technical 
skill and a scientific attitude in determining methods in 
beginning instruction in reading.

CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 

A SURV EY OF METHODS OF B EGIN NING INSTRUC TION 
IN READING F ROM 190 0 to 1950 


Background 

There is, among laymen especially, considerable confusion 
and lack of information about the methods used in beginning in¬ 
struction in reading. Some people maintain that a "look-say” 
method is used today to teach beginners to read and they wonder 
why phonics is not being used. Others expect children to "sound 
out” or "spell out” every word they read and they are mystified 
when children, who can read veiy well, can* t perform these expected 
"sounding feats.” Questions such as these are puzzling many par¬ 
ents, and some teachers. It would seem that a study of those 
methods that have been used and those that are being used would 
throw some light on this problem and provide answers to some of 
the questions. 

There is much to be gained from a study of methods of teach¬ 
ing beginning reading in earlier years. Albert J. Harris suggests 
a general trend that has a warning for teachers in the following 
quotation: 

Fashions do not change in education as quickly as they 
change in women 1 s clothing, yet a survey of the methods used . 
in teaching beginners to read during the past century shows 
that many systems which have been popular for a while have in 
turn been displaced by still newer methods. Excesses in one

direction have at times been replaced by equally objectionable 
swings toward the opposite extreme. (Harris 1947 > p. 65 ) 

Adams, Gray, and Reese suggest further values to be gained 

from such a study: 

In addition to warning us against going to extremes in 
our teaching and, as the saying goes, ”throwing away the baby 
with the bath water,” a knowledge of the history of reading 
can also serve to prevent a revival of methods which in the 
past have been proved fallacious. For example, no student of 
educational history acquainted with the pitfalls inherent in 
the battered old ABC spelling methods would ever make the gross 
blunder of trying to teach beginning reading by such means. 

Historical examples show the relationship between the 
aims, methods, and materials of reading and the social order 

in which they are used. If we can see ?dier.e we have come 

from, we may, perhaps, choose more wisely where we should go 
next in the matter of reading instruction. At least, we can 
find evidence confirming the wisdom of our present many-sided 
approach to reading, which, by inference, condemns resorting 
to extremes. (Adams et al, 1949, p. 42). 

It would seem, therefore, that a survey of methods of teaching 
beginning reading to discover changes and determine trends would be 
both timely and rewarding. 

Purposes of the study 

1. To review the methods that have been used in beginning 
instruction in reading during the past fifty years in order to list 
and classify the different approaches to beginning reading. 

2. To describe these methods, to note distinguishing character¬ 
istics and to record comments on them by educators who have observed 
and tested the results of their use. 

3. To note the major changes in methodology that have taken 
place from 1900 to 1950. 

4. To discover the outstanding trends in methods of teaching 
beginners to read during this period.

5. To summarize these trends with special reference to the 
effect that they are having on the teaching of beginning reading 
today. 

Limitations of the problem 

The study is limited in the following ways: 

(1) It confines itself to the activities of the initial 
period of instruction. 

(2) Although the period preceding formal instruction in 
reading is referred to when it has direct bearing on initial in¬ 
struction in reading, this ’’readiness period” is not the concern 
of the study. This is not a study of the readiness period but one 
of the initial period of reading instruction. 

(3) Research studies receive attention only when these 
studies are credited by educators with evidence contributing .fc© 
changes in method or are referred to as bases for evaluations of 
results. This is primarily a study of teaching procedures. 

(4) Statements of evaluations made by educators in their 
publications are recorded in connection with the descriptions 
of methods but no organized attempt is made to search out the 
reasons for, or influences behind, these changes and trends and to 
evaluate them. The relationship between these trends and general 
educational influences would be the subject of another study. This 
is primarily a survey of findings in educational publications relat¬ 
ing to changes in teaching beginning reading. 

(5) The methods considered are those described in publications 
by educational authorities on the teaching of reading during the

period. These methods may or may not be those used in the majority 
of classrooms. No attempt is made in this survey to determine the 
extent to which any of these methods are in use in classrooms at 
any given period or in any given place. It is assumed that the 
attention given to them in the literature indicates a general use 
during the period and signifies a trend. 

Definition of Terms 

The terms 11 initial instruction in reading” and "approach to 
the teaching of reading/’ are synonymous in this report. They 
refer to "the orderly procedure followed by the teacher in introduc¬ 
ing school beginners to printed materials.” This involves reference 
to the kinds of printed materials used and to the first activities 
carried on with the children when using these materials. 

Organization of Presentation 

This study develops in the following manner: 

First there is a survey of the classifications of methods by 
educators throughout the period to note the criteria used to categ¬ 
orize methods. This survey provides a list of the various methods 
used in teaching beginners to read end assists in determining a basis 
for grouping the methods to be studied. 

The second part of the thesis consists of descriptions of each 
of these approaches to beginning instruction in reading. The pres¬ 
entation of each method includes a description and examples of the 
method, a history of its development and a statement of the basis 
upon which it operates. Comments by educators showing their reactions 
to the use of the method in the schools are folloYfed by an analysis

of its strengths and weaknesses. A statement of its special 
contribution and significance to reading methodology indicates 
its place and value as a. method of beginning instruction in 
reading• 

In the third part of the thesis the changes in methods of 
beginning instruction in reading throughout the period from 1900 
to 1950 are reviewed and the outstanding trends in approaches to 
instruction in reading are noted. This also serves to delineate 
the characteristics of the present-day approach to instruction 
in reading.

CLASSIFICATIONS OF METHODS 


OF TEACHING READING

CHAPTER II 

CLASSIFICATI ONS OF METHODS O F TEACHING READING 

Many different classifications of the methods of teaching 
reading are to be found in the literature on the subject* Ten 
classifications typical of those generally made are reviewed in 
this chapter. This review serves the following purposes: 

( 1 ) To discover the different methods in use during the period 
from 1900 to 1950. 

(2) To determine the bases for these classifications of methods 
of teaching beginning reading. 

(3) To formulate a systera for classifying the methods to be 
described in the subsequent chapters of this study. 

Huey (1912) classified methods of learning to read in common 
use in his day in the following five categories: 

(1) Phonic 

(2) Phonetic 

(3) Word 

( 4 ) Sentence 

(5) Combination methods. (Huey, 1912, pp. 265, 275)* 
These, he claimed, "were about all the methods to be found in use 
anywhere.” The special systems of teaching reading, identified by 
the names of their authors, he considered to be merely special 
adaptations of one or another of the first four standard methods.

Suzzalo (1914) isolated two distinct methods, each of which 
was inclusive of several related methods: 

(1) The "phonic" m ethods . In this category he grouped the 
alphabetic, the syllabic and the phonogrammatic methods. 

(2) The "thought" methods . This classification he divided 
into sentence, word and phrase methods. (Munroe, 1914* p. 119). 

Smith (1934) * in her historical survey of American reading 
instruction, classified methods under periods. This classification 
based its grouping on the main objectives of reading instruction 
and showed how methods of teaching reading can be classified, acc¬ 
ording to the purposes which reading serves. She divided the dev¬ 
elopment of reading instruction into seven periods: 

(1) The period o f religious emphasis in reading instruction (I606 - 
1776). The purpose of readiig instruction in this period was to 
enable children to read the Bible to themselves and to others. Be¬ 
cause of the great dearth of reading materials and the high prevalence 
of illiteracy,oral reading met a real social need and was, therefore, 
emphasized in instruction. Speed and comprehension were of less 
importance than ability to pronounce the words. The subject matter 
was a much more important consideration than the method of teaching. 
Method was considered a tool in furthering the fundamental aim of 
acquainting children with the content and ideas needed in their relig¬ 
ious life. During thi3 period the ABC or alphabet method flourished 
as the only method of instruction in reading. 

(2) The nationali3tic-moralistic emphasis in readi n g instruction 


(1776 - 1&40) • The dual emphasis on moralistic and nationalistic

objectives in reading instruction during this period burdened read¬ 
ing with new functions. Reading was expected to purify the American 
language, to develop loyalty to a new nation, and to inculcate the 
high ideals of virtue and moral, behavior which were considered so 
necessary a part of the general program of building good citizenship. 
The nationalistic aims in reading instruction shaped methods used in 
teaching reading. Great stress came to be placed upon rules and ex¬ 
ercises in correct pronunciation and enunciation for the purpose of 
overcoming the diversity of dialects and promoting greater unity in 
the American language. The emphasis upon articulation and pronun¬ 
ciation was significant for method as it brought about the practice 
of teaching the sounds of letters as well as their names. Webster*s 
(1798) investigation of sounds in the English language and the powers 
of the different letters supported this practice. The alphabet or 
spelling method was still the foundation method for inducting children 
into the mysteries of reading, but newer techniques were introducing 
phonetic approaches to the teaching of reading. 

(3) The period of emphasis upon German-Pestalezzian principles 

(1840 - 1880). The German-Pestalozzian principles introduced by 
influential leaders like Horace Mann constituted the basis for import¬ 
ant innovations in reading instruction. There seems to be a close 
connection between these principles of teaching and such changes in 
reading as the introduction of the word method, the appearance of 
many pictures in primary readers, and the inclusion of material deal¬ 
ing with objects and experiences familiar to children. Gradually 
during this period two new methods of teaching reading were evolving, -

the word method and the alphabet-phonetic method. The alphabet 
method was still in use but there were strong tendencies to teach 
the sounds of the letters either together with their names or in¬ 
stead of their names. 

(4) The period of emphasis upon reading as a cultural asset (1880 - 
1918) • This period brought in the emphasis on the use of reading as 
a medium for awakening a permanent interest in literary materials 
which would be a cultural asset to the individual in adult life. This 
change in objectives resulted in the use of literary selections in 
basic readers, and in the introduction of two improvements in method. 
The first of these were the development of the new sentence and story 
methods which were an outgrowth of the word method. The second was 
the development of the elaborate phonetic methods which were an ex¬ 
tension of the previous practices of teaching children the sounds of 
the letters and combination of letters. 

(5) The period of emphasis upon reading as a utilitarian asset . In 
this period (1918 - 1925) the specific aim of reading instruction 
overshadowing all others was the teaching of efficient silent read¬ 
ing in order to enable the individual to meet the practical needs of 
life. This emphasis brought in the new silent reading methods. 

(6) The period of emphasis on broadened objectives in reading . Be¬ 
ginning in 1925 reading emerged into a new era. During this period 
reading methods were designed to develop the different abilities needed 
in the varied purposes for which reading is used in well-rounded 
living. This was characterized as a period of broadened objectives 
because no one type of instruction was given an exaggerated emphasis.

The three major aims of reading instruction as stated in the 
Twenty-fourth Yearbook of the N.S.S.E. (1925) will illustrate the 
change in objectives. These aims are summarized as follows: 

(1) To extend the experience of boys and girls, to stimulate 
their thinking and to elevate their tastes through reading. 

(2) To develop a permanent interest in reading. 

(3) To promote mastery of the mechanics of reading through 
the development of the attitudes, habits and skills that 
are essential in the various types of reading activities 
in which children and adults should engage. 

These broadened objectives introduced the new basal readers with 
their controlled vocabularies, the wide variety of subject matter 
selected as a result of extensive investigation of children 1 s inter¬ 
ests and teachers® judgment, and the new teachers* manual which 
provided detailed instructions for teaching. 

The main feature of reading instruction in this period was 
systematic study of the reader. Educators were reaching toward the 
integration of reading into the whole school program as a tool in 
furthering the interests and activities of children through units of 
work but, in spite of this, correlation of reading with other subjects 
was the principle most generally applied. Methods of approach in 
teaching beginning reading had never been more varied. The activities 
included were composing experience charts, learning and reading 
rhymes, reading and carrying out sentence directions, making and 
reading stories about pictures, dramatizing stories and reading from 
prepared charts. The units used in beginning instruction were equally

varied. A complete story, a small thought-unit, and a combination 
of sentences, phrases and words were the three types of introductory 
units most frequently employed. In no case were such small units 
as letters or words used in introducing the child to reading. Nila 
B. Smith (1934> PP« 220-223) stressed the attention given to phon¬ 
etics in the manuals of these readers and described the intrinsic 
method n advocated by Gates and Huber (1930) as the newest departure 
in procedure. 

In the final chapter of her book Nila B. Smith (1934) described 
a new movement in reading instruction actuated by a philosophy con¬ 
cerned with general child development and based on the soundest 
principles advocated by the great education leaders of the past. 

This type of instruction did not use any basal set of readers or 
any systematized method but taught reading largely as it entered 
into and flowed out of children*s interests, problems and activities. 
This method she called the experience method. 

Gray suggested three different types of classification for 
reading methods. In the chapter entitled "Changing Viewpoints” 

Gray (1943, pp* 3-33) based his classification on extremes in pract¬ 
ices of teaching word recognition. In his discussion Gray pointed 
out how theory and practice have swung from one extreme to another. 
His classification of methods was as follows: 

(l) Those methods which used the word, letter or syllable as 

the teaching: units . These were the "phonic”, the "word” and 
the "word-and-sentence" methods which emphasized "vocabulary 
power" as the all-important aim in reading.

(2) Those methods which used the story as the teaching unit. 

These "better-balanced" and more "eclectic" story methods in¬ 
troduced simpler techniques of teaching phonics and put the 
emphasis on meaningful reading instead of word recognition. 

(3) Those later methods which reacted against phonics. These 
were the experience methods and the silent reading methods. 

(4) The methods of the new basic readers . These emphasized a 
balanced approach to the problem of word recognition and in¬ 
volved a combination of several methods in the teaching of 
beginning reading. 

In his report on the teaching of reading Gray (1949) used a 
method of classification which he claimed was used by most authorities. 
This classification based on the psychological processes involved was 
as follows: 

(1) "Synthetic" methods. 

(2) "Analytic" methods. 

A third group called "analytic-synthetic" is often included. It 
combines certain elements of the first two. There was so much dis¬ 
agreement concerning the class to vdiich particular methods belonged 
that Gray did not use this classification in his 1956 report. 

Anderson and Dearborn (1952, p. 203) used this system in their class¬ 
ification of methods of teaching reading. These two writers grouped 
the alphabet and phonetic methods as "synthetic" and the word, phrase, 
sentence and story or paragraph methods as "analytic". The synthetic 
methods were so classified because each begins with the smallest 
possible units and builds up to the word, while the anyalytic methods

start with units that can be broken down into smaller parts and 
elements. These writers applied this classification only to the 
initial unit of instruction because, as they say, after the start, 
reading becomes a process of both synthesis and analysis. 

In his international survey of the teaching of reading and 
writing Gray (1956, P* 76) divided specialized methods of teach¬ 
ing reading into two groups as follows: 

(1) Those which approach the teaching of reading through 
initial emphasis on the elements of words and their sounds as aids 

to word recognition . This first group antedated all others and was 
based on the assumption that the teaching of reading should begin 
with a mastery of the elements of words, namely, letters or syllables. 
These, when learned, were gradually combined into larger units such 
as words, phrases and sentences. The three main methods that started 
from word elements were as follows: 

(a) 11 Alphabetic methods” in which the names of letters were 
used in the attempt to recognize and pronounce words. 

(b) ”Phonic methods” in which the sounds of letters and 
groups forming phonograms were used. 

(c) ”Syllabic methods” in 'which the sounds of oft-recurring 
syllables were used. 

(2) Those which approach the teaching of re a ding through the 
use of words or larger language units . This second group of highly 
specialized methods was based on the assumption that such meaningful 
units as words, phrases and sentences should be the point of departure 
in teaching. When these units had been recognized as wholes, attention

should then be directed to smaller and smaller elements. This 
procedure is often referred to as the 'global* method or * analytic* 
methods. In this group were the word, phrase, sentence and story 
methods. 

More recent methods he classified as "eclectic? and "learner- 
centred" . The eclectic methods represented an attempt to overcome 
the limitations of the specialized methods. The program of reading 
instruction using these methods was built to attain broader objectives. 
Learner-centred procedures were classified as author-prepared, 
learner-teacher prepared and integrated instructional materials. 

These methods included those of the new basal reading series, the 
experience methods and the eclectic methods. 

Stone (1950, pp. 23-63) used eight classifications for the 
methods he listed: 

(1) Typical mechanical methods. These were the methods which 
stressed artificial word repetition in their introductory materials. 

In this category he placed the ABC, the word, phonetic, the sentence 
and some combined methods. 

(2) The nursery-rhyme and story methods. These were the methods 
which used the literary primers with a natural type of word and 
phrase repetition in their beginning materials. In this group were 
the ^nursery-rhyme* 1 , the'* slow approach story" and the *'story 
memory" methods which used folk tale and other literary materials. 

(3) The memory technique in some recently current methods. 

This group referred to the materials used after 1925 and included 
the primers based upon experiences common to young children. These

primers supplanted the literary primers but continued to emphas¬ 
ize the memory technique through the use of wall chart reproductions 
of early primer stories, 

(4) Some newer extreme theories and plans . Here Stone 
classified the ! »natural incidental*' method and the ,f experience- 
activitj^ 11 approach to reading. 

(5) The n ew composite in trin sic method . This included the 
systems of instruction in beginning reading which utilized the 
underlying psychology of the intrinsic method in beginning reading. 
(Gates and Huber, 1945) . 

(6) The non-oral method . This was the special method that 
grew out of McDade* s (1941) Chicago experiment under the leadership 
of Buswell (1945). The experiments began in 1935. 

(7) The Fe mald Kinesthetic method . This was another special 
method, definitely extreme in character, which developed in connec¬ 
tion with individual instruction of non-readers. It was first re¬ 
ported upon in 1921 by Grace M. Fernald (1943). 

(8) The be tte r-balanced plans in beginnin g reading . This was 
a composite method in which the ideal program in beginning reading 
was one in which a basic, expertly planned course,built upon a minimum 
vocabulary, paralleled improvised, functional reading and the reading 

of cooperatively formulated experience charts which required, an ex¬ 
tensive vocabulary. The systematic course for the orderly development 
of fundamental, habits and shills Stone (1950, p. 60) visualized as 
well balanced rather than extreme and containing both the basal reader 
and experience chart methods and materials.

Lillian Gray and Dora Reese (1957, p. 39) classified methods 
to point out the "excesses" practiced in past methods as follows: 

(1) Alphabet - Spelling Excesses 

(2) Excesses in overdramatic oral reading 

(3) Rugged - phonic excesses (1870 - 1917) 

(4) Culture extremes (1870 - 1918) 

(5) Look-and-say excesses 

(6) Silent reading excesses (after W or Id War I) 

Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 83-106) considered that current 

practices in teaching reading fell into these six broad categories: 

(1) Instruction which is primarily the teaching of word recog¬ 
nition and includes the letter-by-letter spelling or sounding 
method, the phonetic method and the word-drill method, 

(2) Instruction which is primarily oral. 

(3) Instruction which is totally silent and which would in¬ 
clude McDade*s and Buswell*s non-oral methods. 

(4) Instruction which depends primarily on reading experience 
charts and which would include the experience and integrated 
methods. 

(5) Instruction which becomes a thought-getting process centered 
around purposeful activities. 

(6) Instruction which is a well-organized composite of all 
other methods. 

No dates or examples were given in the above classifications but an 
evaluation of each category was made and will be dealt with later as 
the methods are described.

Slover (1957, pp. 413-423) described five past methods: 

(1) The ABC or "alphabet” 

(2) The phonetic or phonic 

(3) The word 

(4) The sentence 

(5) The story. 

Modern methods Slover described as accepting not one method as the 
method but using interest as the keynote of a successful reading 
program and organizing reading around interesting units or problems 
with emphasis, above all else, on meaningful interpretation. 

Thirty-one methods were named in these discussions. These 
methods were the alphabetic, alphabet, ABC, alphabet-spelling, 
spelling, phonic, phonetic, phaiqgramatic, syllabic, word, phrase, 
sentence, word-and-sentence, look-say, story, paragraph, nursery- 
rhyme, literary, slow-approach story, story-memory, memoiy, exper¬ 
ience, experience-activity. Incidental, composite-intrinsic, intrin¬ 
sic, oral reading, silent reading, non-oral, Fernald-kinaesthetic 
and basal reader methods. Some of these are the same or similar 
methods travelling under different names. Others are combinations 
of two or more methods. Many of the methods differ essentially from 
the others in their basic approach to reading instruction. Most of 
these have been grouped into categories according to the basic 
principles upon which they are founded. The educators who are class¬ 
ifying the methods have done this in several different ways. 

In the ten classifications described in this chapter there app¬ 
ear to have been five different bases used for their organization

into groups. These bases are as follows: 


(1) The purpose of function which the reading served deter¬ 
mined, to a large extent, the nature of some methods of instruction• 
Some of the purposes suggested for reading are: reading to recognize 
and pronounce the words; reading to get the meaning, ideas or thought; 
reading to gain experience vicariously. This type of classification 
usually follows a historical pattern for, as society places new 
demands on reading, new methods of teaching reading evolve to meet 
them. Smith based her classification on the objectives of reading 
instruction in this way. 

(2) The content of the material used for reading instruction 
distinguishes some methods from others. Content used has been of 
four types. Some content has been mainly isolated words, phrases 
and sentences designed, merely to repeat or present words for pron¬ 
unciation. Other methods use literary content - usually stories 
or rhymes. Silent reading methods use informational content. The 
more recent methods use content based on children’s experiences. 

(3) The process involved in w o rking out words or i n inter¬ 
preting printed matter differentiates some methods from others. 

Two different types of techniques used for working out words are 
the analytic and the synthetic. Gray and Anderson end Dearborn 
used this basis for classifying methods. 

(4) Elements used as uni ts in beginning Inst r uction have 
varied considerably and are distinguishing features of early methods 
of teaching reading. Units used have been the sound, the syllable, 
the word, the phrase, the sentence, the story, or various combinations

of these. Educators classifying methods according to the elements 
used in beginning instruction were Huey (1912, pp. 265,275), Gray 
(1956, P. 76), Stone (1950, pp. 23-63) and Bond and Wagner (1950, 
pp. 33-106). 

(5) Excesses and extremes in instructional procedures formed 
the main basis for classifications by Gray (1943, pp. 3-33), Bond 
and Wagner (1950, pp. 83-106) and Lillian Gray and Dora Reese (1957, 
p. 39) . These extremes related to methods of teaching word recognition 
or to the types of activities or the content of the materials used for 
instruction. 

The nature of the elements used as units for beginning instruction 
in reading provides a clear basis for classifying each of the earlier 
teaching methods which used one or another of these elements in its 
approach to reading instruction. All these pure methods can be 
classified in one of two categories depending on whether the unit 
used is 

(a) the word or one of its elements 

(b) a unit larger than the word. 

Later methods, which become more complex in structure and in¬ 
volve combinations of the above, need a different basis for classif¬ 
ication. This basis might be established on any one of the three 
pointed out earlier in this chapter. The functions which the reading 
serves provides a basis for distinguishing between these methods in 
a manner which points out the kind of reading activity expected and 
is closely related to the concept, as well as the objectives,of the 
reading process. Methods can be classified as those emphasizing the

function of reading as a tool, those emphasizing reading as ex¬ 
perience, and those emphasizing broadened objectives for reading. 

The methods to be described in the following chapters will be 
classified under these five headings: 

(1) Methods using the word or its elements as the unit for 
beginning instruction . These methods look upon reading as word 
recognition mainly. This process of reading is synthetic and mechan¬ 
ical. The methods that emphasize this approach are the alphabet¬ 
spelling, the phonic, and the word. 

(2) Methods using units larger than the word in beginning 
instruction . These methods start with the idea or thought and 
emphasize the content of the reading material. Word recognition 
skills are developed through a process of analysis to discover the 
word or sound elements. The methods using this process are the 
phrase, sentence, story, memory and literary methods. 

(3) Methods emphasizing the functi on of reading as a tool . 

In beginning instruction using these methods the objective was to 
emphasize the main purpose of the reading through using it, from 
the start, as it would function in reading activities. The first 
such method was the oral reading method which conceived of reading 
as a process of translating printed symbols into speech. Then came 
the emphasis on the utilitarian silent reading methods which looked 
upon reading as a silent process of getting meaning from printed 
materials and its function that of getting information. An extreme 
example of the type of method used to accomplish this was the non-oral 
method.

CHAPTER III 

METHODS USING THE WORD OR ITS E L EMENTS 
AS UNITS OF INSTRUCTION IN BEGINNING READING 

The elements of the word used as units of instruction in 
beginning reading have been, at different times, the letters, 
sounds, phonograms and syllables. Methods using the word, or 
these element^ are of three types: 

(1) The Alphabet and Spelling methods which use letters 
as teaching units. 

(2) The Phonic or Phonetic methods which use, as sound 
units in words, the phonemes, phonograms or syllables. 

(3) The Word methods which use the whole word as the unit 
of instruction. 

Each of these types is described in this chapter. 

THE ALPHABET AND SPELLING METHODS 

The Alphabet, Alphabetic, ABC Spelling and Alphabet- 
Spelling methods all used the name of the letters of the alphabet 
as beginning units in teaching and they employed spelling as a 
technique in word recognition. These names, however, are merely 
different labels for the same method. For the sake of clarity 
in the following discussion, The Alphabet Method is the term used 
to designate all of the above methods.

(1934, pp. 31-35), Adams, Gray and Reese (1949, pp. 44-46), Stone 
(1950, pp. 23, 24), Andersen and Dearborn (1952, pp. 204-207), 
Yoakam (1955, p. 3), Gray (1956, pp. 77, 78), Slover (1957, pp. 
413-415) and Hildreth (1958, PP- 191, 192), agree on the basic 
procedure employed in the alphabet method. 

The unit used was the letter. The order of development was 
from letter to syllable, syllable to word, word to sentence and 
sentence to story. First the names of the printed letters, the 
ABC*s, were taught by rote, forwards and backwards. Practice in 
distinguishing and naming the letters in isolation was also given. 
After having mastered the alphabet, the child was inducted into 
the syllabarium. This syllabarium was a prominent feature of the 
materials. It began with two letter syllables which were gradually 
increased in length until six syllables were given. This inter¬ 
mediate step between the learning of letters and words employed 
the spelling of the syllables before they were pronounced. Nonsense 
syllables like ab, eb, ob, were first spelled and then pronounced 
(ay-bee, ab; bee-ay, ba, etc.). 

This was followed by similar practice on combinations of 
three letters, monosyllabic words, disyllables, and polysyllables. 
These syllable drills constituted a kind of "reading by spelling". 
Suzz&lo (1914, P- 118), described how the child would, in a very 
rough way, obtain a suggestion of the sound of the word through 
converting the familiar word (cat) into its alphabetic name units 
(see-ay-tee). Learning the alphabet and the syllabarium were a 
preparation for the real business of reading which began when the

child attacked the primer itself* The method employed in using 
the primer was to make the child name the letters and spell the 
words until, through repeating this, he could pronounce the shorter 
words by sight. The sentences he was required to learn by heart 
until he had memorized the whole text. Learning the alphabet, 
spelling and pronouncing syllables and words, memorizing sections 
of the content, and reading orally were the techniques used. 

Examples of the alphabet method are to be found among some 
of the earliest materials for the teaching of reading, such as: 

The Hornbook (approximately 1678-1760) 

The Hew England Primer (1727-1776) 

Noah Webster* s Speller (1790-1842 approximately) 

The IcGuffey Primer (1836-1907) 

Tower* s Gradual Primer (1853-1871). 

1. The Hornbook (Smith, 1934, pp. 15-18). 

The hornbook is the earliest example of instructional material 
used in schools throughout the colonial period. It was used for 
catechizing in church as well as for giving children their first 
reading instruction in school. The hornbook was a page of printed 
material fastened to a wooden paddle. The material consisted of 
the alphabet in small and capital letters, a six-line syllabarium 
using the first three consonants in the alphabet with each of the 
five vowels, and the Lord* s prayer. 

2. The New England Primer (Smith, 1934, pp. 18-25) • 

This was the first reading text book specifically designed for

the American colonies. First printed in 1683 it was the standard 
textbook for reading instruction throughout the colonial period. 

The first page and a half were devoted to the alphabet, vowels, 
consonants, double letters, italics and capitals. A series of 
little black and white woodcuts illustrated a religious or moral 
couplet designed to teach a letter of the alphabet. After these 
came the syllabarium. In the New England Primer the child started 
with columns of two-letter syllables and progressed rapidly to 
words of five syllables. Page five of the primer contained five 
columns with a total of eighty-two syllables,each beginning with 
a vowel. Then came the alphabet verses and sentences from the 
Bible arranged in alphabetical order. The Lord*s Prayer, the 
Creed and some famous verses completed the text. 

3. Noah Webster 1 s Speller (Smith, 1934, pp. 44-48). 

The American Spelling Book by Noah Webster was used exten¬ 
sively to teach reading in America during the early part of the 
nineteenth century. The bulk of the book was made up of lists of 
words and syllables, 74 pages out of 158 being devoted to this con¬ 
tent. Rules for correct reading and speaking took up a total of 
39 pages, and. moralistic advice and admonitions were found on an¬ 
other 29 pages. There were 4 pages of fables, Z, pages of realistic 
stories, 2 pages of dialogues and a half page of poetry (Smith, 1934, 
p; 48). According to Judd (193.8, p. 1) the book opened with a few 
pages on the letters and sounds used in English spelling. The first 
exercises introduced the pupil to combinations of the first five 
consonants with the vowels. The pupil learned meaningless combin-

ations as follows: ba, bi, bo, bu, by. Then he studied phrases 
made up of words of two letters, e.g., go in, go on, go up. Then 
came three letter and four end five letter combinations relieved 
by the reading of isolated sentences. In this speller Noah 
Webster provided a logical basis and careful organization for 
the Alphabet Spelling method. 

4. The McGuffey Primer (Smith, 1934> pp. 103-109). 

This famous series, McGuffey Eclectic Readers was first pub¬ 
lished between 1836 and 1844• From 1840 to 1880 it outstripped 
all other series in sales and popularity. The last editions 
intended for school use were printed in 1886 and 1907. 

In McGuffey* s Primer the first page was given over to the 
alphabet in large and small letters. Then came the picture alpha¬ 
bet which occupied three pages, and then Lesson I, followed by 
reading material which came later to be known as "echo*’ material. 
On page ten one half the page under the picture of the ox was 
used for spelling and the right half for reading. The first six 
lines of print were as follows:

McGuffey is credited with producing the first clearly defined 
and carefully graded series consisting of one reader for each grade. 
He also introduced somewhat more childlike materials and earned

the distinction of being the first to provide definitely for 
repetition to fix new words and to decrease the number of new 
words introduced per page. Despite these innovations McGuffey 
clung to the alphabet as an introductory method. 

5. Towels Gradual Primer (Smith, 1934, PP* 109-111). 

Published in 1853 this was one of the later alphabet-phonetic 
methods. In this series Towers attempted to effect a compromise 
between the alphabet method and the word method. The new feature, 
according to Towers (1853), consisted of giving the child only a 
few letters before he was called upon to read words composed of 
these letters. In this way the child was taught words long before 
he had mastered the alphabet and yet no ?fords were given him which 
contained letters he had not learned previously. 

The content of the series was divided into three parts. 

The first 17 pages contained letters and words. These words grad¬ 
ually increased in length and were repeated often. On one page 
there was a range of from three to ten new words. The next 43 pages 
contained words made up of certain letters and arranged in lists or 
sentences according to the phonetic elements in them, e.g. - 


e 

Pen 

Led 

Let 

Bell 

e 

men 

bed 

pet 

tell 

e 

ten 

red 

yet 

well 


I met ten men. 

I have a bad pen. 

Let men set a net. (Smith, 1934, P* 111). 

In spite of Tower* s conciliatory attitude the method remained 
predominantly alphabetic in character.

The last 40 pages of the book contained short stories 
based on nature, morals or child life. These stories used the 
letters, words and phonetic elements that had been introduced 
on previous pages. 

These Alphabet-spelling materials used in teaching reading 
were published before the beginning of the twentieth century. The 
alphabet-spelling method is the oldest known method of teaching 
reading. According to Huey (1912, p. 77) it was used almost 
universally in Greece and Rome and in the European countries 
generally until well into the nineteenth century. Widely used in 
America until about 1870, it is now chiefly of historical interest. 

Nila Banton Smith (1934, P* 98) warns that the statement 
frequently encountered in educational writing, that the alphabet 
method was abandoned about 1840,is far from the truth. Smith 
(1934, P« 128) stated that the practice of learning the alphabet 
end spelling words as an initial step seems generally to have been 
abandoned early in the period of emphasis upon reading as a cultural 
asset, from 1880 to 1918. But she also asserted that, in spite of 
the agitation in favor of the word method, the alphabet method 
persisted because of the years of tradition behind it. 

Huey (1908, p. 265) claimed that there were still "innumerable 
comers of our country, a little removed from the centers and 
thoroughfares of civilization, in which the Alphabet Method is still 
*the good old way*". Wheat, (1923, p. 165) who designated this 
method as "the method of the cloister schools" and "characteristic 
of the teaching in the schools of the colonies", admitted that "even

today its effects are to be observed in not a few of our backward 
schools.” Anderson and Dearborn (1952, p. 204) maintained that, 
although the use of the alphabet method in this country was roughly 
identified with the period before 1840, it is not yet dead and 
buried. Even though it probably is a relic of the past the alpha¬ 
bet method must be included in a description of methods of the 
early 1900’s. 

The alphabet and spelling methods were based on the assumption 
that familiarity with the forms and names of the letters helped the 
pupils to recognize and pronounce the words. Correct pronunciation 
of the word was the main aim in instruction. The response to 
printed symbols was necessarily oral consisting first of the spell¬ 
ing of the words and then the pronouncing of them. This assumption 
that spelling the word provides sufficient clues to enable the child 
to "read” it, or even pronounce it, is one that has been seriously 
questioned by educationists since 1900. ^he assumption that the 
letter is the unit of recognition has been proven to be false. 

Yoakam (1955, pp. 47-49) pointed out that today psychologists and 
educators are generally agreed that words are recognized as wholes 
and supports this theory by reference to Potter’s (1943) findings 
based on an analysis of 300 studies in word recognition. 

Comments by educationists from the early 1900* s up to the 
present time indicate that, during this period, the alphabet method- 
had not met with the approval of highly qualified teachers of reading. 
Even before 1900 educators had expressed dissatisfaction with the 
results of this method. In this connection Wheat (1923, p. 167)

referred to the findings of Horace Mann (1337) who expressed 
dissatisfaction with the "very inadequate" results in reading in 
1333 and blamed these on the alphabet method. In the same year, 
in his report to the Board of Education of Massachusetts, Horace 
Mann attacked the alphabet method of teaching reading. He claimed 
that the arduous spelling tasks set out in the system were not 
mastered by the children and that reading suffered because of the 
excessive devotion to fox-mal spelling. He attempted to learn how 
far reading in the schools was an exercise of the mind in thinking 
and feeling and how far it was "a barren action of the organs of 
speech upon the atmosphere." His information, derived principally 
from written statements of school committees and superintendents, 
revealed that more than eleven-twelfths of all the children in the 
reading classes in their schools did not understand the meaning of 
the words they read. They did not, in effect, acquire a reasonable 
and practicable understanding of the subjects of the reading lessons. 
He concluded with the statement, "It would hardly seem that the 
combined efforts of all persons engaged could have accomplished more 
in defeating the true objects of-reading." 

Huey (1912, p. 266) found it difficult to see just how the 
naming of the letters was supposed to assist in pronouncing the 
words and suggested that "it ims doubtless the value of the practice 
in learning to spell" which "had much to do with blinding centuries 
of teachers to its uselessness for the teaching of reading of words 
and sentences." He also suggested that the pupil who dealt thus 
constantly with letters and their combinations must necessarily

have acquired a familiarity with the sounds represented by each 
letter. Thus the method always combined something of phonics as 
well, 

Suzzalo (1914> P* 120) pointed out the ’’crudity 1 ’ of such 
alphabet spelling and suggests that ”a more refined method of 
phonic spelling,” in which the letters of a word are spelled by 
their elementary sounds rather than their alphabetic names, soon 
came into vogue. 

Wheat (1923, pp. 164-166) attempted to point out the intimate 
relationship which has always existed between the methods of teach¬ 
ing reading and the conceptions people have had of the nature of 
the reading process. He described the conception of reading that 
supported the alphabet method as one that considered the process 
of reading to be just the opposite to that of writing. Since 
”writing” meant the breaking up of words into their ABC’s, then 
reading, being the opposite process, meant the reassembling into 
words of the ABC’s that had been written down. Reading, according 
to this theory, meant the sensing of the letters as they appeared 
on the page and building them into proper words. Wheat advised 
that, "difficult as it is for us in this later day to conceive of 
reading in other than the modern sense,” if we looked into the 
former conception of reading and comprehend how firmly implanted it 
came to be in the mind of the race, we would then be able to under¬ 
stand ”how it came about that such a wasteful method of teaching 
reading as the alphabet method was looked upon by teachers for so 
long a time with such blind devotion.” This word-building idea of

the reading process had ruled over school methods with almost un¬ 
disputed sway from the earliest times of which the history of 
reading was recorded down to the middle of the nineteenth century. 
From time to time. Wheat admitted,the alphabet method had been 
modified in various ways but, with each modification, no change 
in principle had resulted. Innovations had come and gone, but 
each had done no more than to "clothe the old-established method 
in a garment which was new." As long as the prevailing theory 
of the reading process gave it sanction, the ABC method continued 
in the schools, but, as soon as a new idea arose in the minds of 
the people in general, a new method was developed to take its 
place. Wheat stated that the ABC method produced meager results 
generally and that educators became dissatisfied with the enormous 
amount of time consumed, with its "extremely mechanical" results, 
and with the "wasteful" procedures. This dissatisfaction with the 
"very inadequate" results of the ABC method together with "the 
development of a new theory of the reading process" were instrumental 
in the development of modern methods of teaching reading. 

Stone (1950, P. 23) described the alphabet method as "a 
highly mechanical, analytical one which was based upon the false 
assumption that the letter was the unit of recognition." He credited 
the method with building consistent forward movements of the eye but 
warned that it tended to produce slow, labored reading. The reader 
who developed an adequate span of recognition with the ABC method 
does so, in Stone*s opinion, in spite of the method. Those who did 
become good readers under this method acquired a large vocabulary

of sight words and used the syllabic method of analysis which. 

Stone felt, was too often neglected in more recent methods. 

Anderson and Dearborn (1952, pp. 204-206), in their apprais¬ 
al of the alphabet method, established the following points: 

(1) The chief limiting condition of the alphabet method was 
that the sounds of the letter names alone have no meaning or assoc¬ 
iative connections. The sounds of the letter names gave no clue 

to the sound of the word. 

(2) The process was slow and laborious and it took the child 
"forever* to make any real progress in word recognition. 

(3) Although the child did learn to spell with the alphabet 
method, this knowledge did not affect his ability to read. A child 
did not have to know his letters in order to be able to read. 

(4) Children taught by the alphabet method were likely to 
become unduly conscious of the details of the words and might event¬ 
ually become word-callers because they had acquired the habit of 
looking at words carefully. Meaning suffered, rate was retarded 
and the fun of reading was spoiled. 

Gray (195&* 73), in his evaluation of the method for 

D.N.E.S.C.O., pointed out its three chief weaknesses as follows: 

(1) The chief objection to the alphabetic method was that 
the sounds of the names of the letters do not always indicate the 
pronunciation of the words • Gray quoted Menzel* s statement that 
this method helped children "incidentally, wastefully and ineffect¬ 
ively* and supported Anderson and Dearborn’s contention (1952, p. 205) 
that the pupils either guessed the word from the sounds of its

letter names or learned it after the teacher had pronounced it, 

(2) The content of the early reading lessons of the alpha¬ 
betic methods had little bearing on child interests and the arduous 
and meaningless repetitions required often established a permanent 
dislike for reading. Gray contended that practically all critics 
agreed in this and stated further that the validity of this crit¬ 
icism was recognized almost two thousand years ago when devices 

to interest the child and encourage whole-hearted effort were first 
employed. According to Huey (1912), Quintillian, in A.D. 63, 
suggested that the child be given blocks and tablets containing 
the letters and that he trace with a pen the forms of the letters 
as engraved on ivory tablets. In the mid eighteenth century 
Basedow had the idea of making gingerbread letters which the child 
was permitted to eat. Various mechanical devices viere contrived to 
facilitate the manipulation of letters in script and print, and to 
group them into syllables, words and other combinations. Some 
devices were contrived primarily to interest the child in the letters 
Letters were also associated with pictures of words beginning with 
those letters such as a is for apple. 

(3) Finally, since the child learned and repeated the letters 
before he had recognized their functions as component elements of 
words, Gray contended that he was not able to apply them properly. 
Gray concludes his criticism by commenting that, since knowing the 
forms and names of the letters was of little help in recognising new 
words, the alphabetic method was gradually supplanted by more 
effective methods and is rarely used today.

Other educators wrote in even more derogatory terms of the 
alphabet-spelling method. Yoakam (1955, p. 3) described the 
method as a "mechanical 11 process involving "the tiresome learning" 
of letters and syllables as a preliminary to reading. Hildreth 
(195S, p. 35) referred to the "slow, tedious spelling out" involved 
in the method. Adams, Gray and Reese (1949, p. 45) described the 
memorizing-and chanting of rounds as "gibberish" and considered the 
"laborious spelling out" of each "word orally a "confusion of read¬ 
ing and spelling." These last writers discussed the method under 
the heading "Alphabet-spelling Excesses." Hone of these reading 
specialists considered the method effective in beginning instruction 
in reading. 

An analysis of these evaluations by educators indicates the 
strengths and weaknesses of the alphabet and spelling methods. 
However, in spite of the many criticisms of its effectiveness in 
teaching reading, the method had four strong features: 

(1) It was simple, direct, definite and logical. One thing 
was to be taught at a time. The procedure was logical, progressing 
from simple to complex in an orderly fashion. 

(2) It was easy to understand and use. Its simple organiz¬ 
ation of materials and its definite procedures could be interpreted 
without much difficulty. Little teacher training was necessary in 
order to use the method. At a time when teacher training was not 
provided, this feature of the method was an important one. 

(3) It stressed visual perception and left-to-right eye 
movement. Children learned to scrutinize a word carefully from

left-to-right and thus gained a clear impression of its details* 

(4) It developed spelling ability. It is doubtful whether 
the development of spelling ability can be considered a proper 
function of the teaching of reading but, in any case, this develop¬ 
ment of spelling ability was sn important result of the use of the 
method. 

The weaknesses of the alphabet and spelling methods out¬ 
weighed by far the strengths. These are summarized as follows: 

(1) The sounds of the letter names alone were meaningless 

to the child. He was taught them before he had learned to recognize 
their functions in words and they, therefore, were of no significance 
to him. 

(2) The content of the reading lessons was dull and it en¬ 
tailed arduous and meaningless repetitions which often established 
a. permanent dislike for reading. 

(3) The sounds of the letter names did not give the child 
sufficient clues to the sound of the word. The spelling of the 
word did not necessarily indicate the pronunciation of the word. 

(4) The spelling skill which the child did develop does not 
affect reading ability. The relationship between ability to spell 
and ability to read is doubtful. The time spent on learning letter 
names and spelling words was of questionable value in teaching the 
child to read. 

(5) Slow laborious readers, #10 were trained to sense each 
letter as it appeared on the page and to build than into the proper 
words, were produced. Readers who learned in this way developed

into word callers rather than true readers. They were likely to 
become so conscious of the details of words that they spent more 
time on word-recognition than necessary. 

(6) Readers were trained in ability to pronounce the words 
and not to develop understanding of the content. 

The special contribution of the alphabet method was the en¬ 
couragement it gave to careful visual perception, and to left-to- 
right eye-movements in word-recognition. At a time when teacher 
training was not provided the alphabet and spelling methods offered 
simple direct instructional procedures that were easy to follow. 

To summarize, the alphabet method is not a good method to 
use in the beginning stage of instruction. It is slow, wasteful, 
extremely mechanical and dull. When children are introduced to 
reading through the use of this method meaning suffers, rate is 
retarded and the fun of reading is spoiled. For these reasons the 
alphabet method has been gradually supplanted and is rarely used 
today.

PHONIC AND PHONETIC METHODS 

These methods include those commonly called phonic and 
phonetic, as well as the phonogramatic and syllabic methods 
listed by Gray (1956) and Suzzalo (1914)- The distinguishing 
feature of these methods is that they use phonemes (sound units) 
in words as the basic unit of instruction. The word phonogramatic 
refers to the characters or symbols representing a single speech 
sound, syllable or word. For practical purposes any one of the 
three terms - phonic, phonetic and phonogramatic - is used to 
indicate methods using the sounds of the letters as teaching units. 
The syllabic method differs from other synthetic methods in that 
the key units used in teaching reading are syllabic units. As 
there are no examples of pure syllabic methods of teaching children 
to read the English language, there is no special mention made of 
them in the following discussion. Any method using syllabic units 
to teach children to read English uses them along with, and prob¬ 
ably after, the teaching of the letter sounds. Syllabic units have 
received more attention as word elements in the more recent intrinsic 
and eclectic approaches to the teaching of word recognition skills. 
When used in these later systems the syllables are derived through 
the process of analysis and are not used as units in beginning 
reading instruction. 

Huey (1912, p. 362) described the phonic method clearly in 
the following quotation: 

It is a spelling method, but the word is spelled by its 
elementary sounds and not by the letter names. The word is 
slowly pronounced until its constituent sounds come to con¬ 
sciousness, and these sounds are associated with the letters

representing them. Drill on this sound analysis trains the 
articulation, trains the ear and the ability to sound the 
letters of any new word, and gives the power to pronounce it 
by blending the sounds suggested, — provided there are no 
silent letters and provided the sounded letters represent but 
one sound. This seldom occurs, and the reader of new words 
must be helped out by context or conjecture. 

Smith (1934* pp. 130-132), Adams, Gray and Reese (1949, pp. 

51, 52), Stone (1950, pp. 25-27), Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 35, 

86) and Gray (1956, pp. 73-30) are in agreement on the following 

procedure as that generally used in teaching beginning reading 

using the phonic method. In the initial stage the forms snd sounds 

of the letters were taught. Usually the vowels were taught first. 

The teacher wrote the letter on the blackboard or pointed it out 

on a chart or in a primer, and, as he did so, he gave its sound, 

often calling attention to the lip and tongue movements required 

to pronounce it. The sound was then repeated several times by the 

pupil. Then other vowels were introduced and their sounds repeated 

several times to establish association between the sound of the 

letter and its form. After the vowels were taught, the consonants 

were introduced in some prescribed order and their sounds were 

combined with the sound of each of the vowels. The recognition 

and pronunciation of series of syllables,like la le li lo lu, were 

practiced. Then combinations of two, three, four or more letters 

were introduced and, finally, syllables were combined into words 

and words into phrases and sentences. Pupils often went through 

two or more primers of such exercises before actual reading began. 

A great variety of phonic systems were devised to organize reading 

instruction using this general method.

There are many examples of this method in the elaborate phonic 
systems described by Smith (1934> pp. 130-139) and Gray (1948, pp. 
10-23). A list of some of these with the dates of their public¬ 
ation include the following: Rebecca Pollard* s Synthetic Method 
(1889, 1899), The Ward Rational Method in Reading (1894> 1896, 

1907, 1919), The Gordon Readers (1902, 1910, 1918), The Beacon 
Readers (1912), The Children*S Method Reader (1918) and the Moore- 
Wilson Readers published as late as 1927. Samples of content and 
teaching directions from these books will illustrate the different 
interpretations of the phonic method. 


PoHard * s Synthetic Method 

(Smith, 1934, p. 131) 

In her history of American reading instruction Smith stated 
that,after the word method had been in use for a few years, a 
growing dissatisfaction sprang up in some quarters because child¬ 
ren who had been taught by this method were not able to read well 
in the upper grades. As a result of such complaints, several 
writers of textbooks took the opposite position and advocated an 
extremely synthetic method. Rebecca Pollard*s Synthetic Method 
publivshed in 1889 was one of the first of these. 

Some quotations from her manual reveal her position on read¬ 
ing method. 

Make reading of the first importance. As in music, let 
there be scales to practice; drills in articulation; a 
thorough preparation for reading before the simplest sentence 
is attempted. 

Instead of teaching the word as a whdle and afterward 
subjecting it to phonic analysis, is it not infinitely better 
to take the sounds of the letters for our starting point, and 
with these sounds lay a foundation firm and broad, upon which 
we can build whole families of words for instant recognition?

There must be no guess work ; no reference to pictures; 
no waiting for a story from the teacher to develop thought. 

If the instructions of the manual are carefully followed (in 
inflection as well as pronunciation), the child* s own voice 
will give him a perfect understanding of what he reads. 
(Pollard, 1889, pp. 3, 4)* 

The general procedure advocated by Miss Pollard was as follows; 

First: Oral instructional excerpts from Johnny Story, 
using stencils and songs when teaching sounds; talk about tie 
new sound; developing words by families; reasons for marking, 
etc. 

Second: Blackboard drill, which should include the 
marking on the board by pupils, in turn, of all the letters, 
words, and sentences given in the lesson. 

Third: Independent marking of the lesson by pupils at 
their seats. 

Fourth: Writing, from the teacher’s dictation, the 
letters, family names, words, and keys of the lesson. 

Fifth: Recitation; pupils pronouncing the words and 
reading the sentences of the lesson. (Pollard, 1899, p. 24). 

In the Preface of her manual she says: 

.It has been proved, in innumerable instances, during the 

past four years, that first grade pupils are as delighted with 
the busy-work afforded by the marking and sounding of the 
letters as are children of mere tender years with their kinder¬ 
garten occupations. Is it not wise then, to encourage such 
employment as impresses upon the memory the elements of the 
word, and thus, unconsciously, leads the child into independ¬ 
ence of thought and action? Let the marking, sounding, and 

pronouncing of words.follow each blackboard drill. Let 

no attempt be made to read until every word in the reading 
lesson has been marked and sounded; until every word meets 
with instant recognition. (Pollard, 1889 preface). 


Ward* s Headers 
(Smith, 1934, p. 134) 

NilaB. Smith (1934, P* 134) considered Ward to be one of the 
authors who tried to reconcile the word method and the phonetic 
method by using the former in connection with the early pages of 
his primer and then, after equipping the child with the stock of 
sight words which he thought necessary, plunging him into intensive

training in phonetics. This carried over into the reading of 
materials by means of diacritical marks. In an attempt to en¬ 
courage memorization of the sight words in the beginning stages, 
pages of unrelated sentences were designed for drill. These 
provided drill on the new words "that were necessary in making 
stories but which did not lend themselves readily to phonetic 
sounding —- does, do you, etc. 

In his manual Ward (1902) himself describes his method as 
follows: 

The Rational Method is a peculiar combination of the 
word and phonetic methods. It utilizes each for that part 
of the work to which it is especially adapted. The word 
method is used, first as principal, because of its value in 
developing a habit of reading thoughtfully, and afterward as 
auxiliary, to remedy the shortcomings of the phonetic method, 
and increase the stock of word phonograms. The phonetic 
method, which is introduced by easy stages during the ascend¬ 
ancy of the ?ford method, finally becomes the principal means 
of growth and progress. It imparts power, while it supplies 
the key which the word method is inadequate to give. (Judd, 
1918, p. 7). 


The Gordon Readers 
(Gray, 1948, pp. 11-14) 

In the introduction to the Teachers 1 Manual for The Gordon 
Readers (1902, 1910, 1918) the author said: 

The method of teaching reading presented in this Manual 
recognizes: (1) that the child must master certain phonic 
facts before he can have power to solve problems for himself; 
(2) that it is not possible to reduce every word in the 
language to a phonic basis, and that exceptions to phonic 
rules should be taught as sight words or wholes. It gives 
the child such mastery over the mechanics of reading that his 
mind is free to grasp the thought of the sentence when it is 
presented. (Gordon, 1902). 

The Gordon system included 65 letter squares which were 
cards containing vowels, single consonants, and blended

phonograms of two or three letters. Two of the Phonic Charts 
presented 140 vowel-consonant combinations (families) - ah, 
ad, eb, otch, etc. A third chart gave such combinations as 
bble, tion, adge, udge, cy, py, ry, etc. In general, however, 
this system was based on families each of which consisted of 
a vowel and a final consonant. (Gray, 1948, p. 11). 


The B ea con Primer 
(Gray, 1911, pp. 14, 15) 

The preface of the Beacon Primer (1912) illustrated the point 
of view of those who placed major emphasis in reading on n sounding ,, 
words. 


The object of this primer is to offer a set of easy 
reading lessons worked out in connection with a series of 
graded exercises in phonetic drill for the purpose of assist¬ 
ing the child in the easiest and most direct way to acquire 
the power of word getting, of word mastery, and of reading. 

The idea of the author can best be explained by stating 
that he has endeavored to carry out in this phonetic primer 
the exact principles which Ho ah Webster embodied in his so- 
called Spelling Book, a book which in reality was not a 
speller, but a primer, or a first book for teaching reading. 

If the reader will carefully examine a copy of Noah 
Webster 1 s Spelling Book, he will become convinced that Webster 1 s 
idea of teaching reading consisted of two distinct parts, 
namely: (l) tables of words carefully arranged according to 
their difficulty; (2) reading exercises based upon the words 
found in these tables; Thus Webster developed a method which 
long usage proved logical and sound. 

Besides the consonants and the short sounds of the vowels, 
there are but few phonetic rules which the pupil needs to learn 
before recognizing the majority of English words. These rules, 
when brought to his understanding through practice on long 
lists of selected words where only one difficulty is presented 
at a time, quickly and surely develop the reading power. 

It is found in practice that with proper development of 
the principles underlying the phonetic part of the English 
language, the use of diacritical marks is unnecessary; in fact, 
they are worse than useless, for they present to the eye not 
the true form of the letter of word, but an artificial and 
arbitrary form which the child must soon learn to discard.

In preparing the phonetic tables, only those words have 
been used which are easily within the comprehension of the 
child, except in those cases where not enough common words 
could be found for the necessary drill. 

In the section entitled "Directions to Teachers" the basic 

principles of the method of the Beacon Readers (1912) was set 

forth: 


Before the teacher can use any system of phonetics, she 
must have a clear conception of the sounds of the individual 
letters* This can best be obtained by selecting a few simple 
words and slowly speaking them aloud, carefully analyzing 
the sound of each letter as it issues from the mouth. Note 
accurately the position of tongue, lips, and teeth. Take, 
for instance, the word fan : by dwelling on the first letter 
f, it will be noticed that the under lip is brought back 
until it comes in contact with the upper teeth, thus produc¬ 
ing the correct sound of the letter f. Then the lower jaw is 
dropped slightly and the short sound of a follows. Finally, 
to produce the n, the tip of the tongue is brought to the 
roof of the mouth just behind the upper teeth. In a similar 
way the teacher should analyze the sounds of the separate 
letters of the words big , b-i-g , sum , s-u-m , wet , w-e-t , cod , 
c-o-d , etc., until she can indicate to her pupils the correct 
position of the lips, tongue, and teeth in forming ail 
letters. 

In the section in the Beacon Primer (1912) labelled "Important 

Directions" the procedure was described: 

(1) Keep the drill upon the Letter Cards and the phonetic 
tables of the Chart and of the Primer entirely distinct from 
the reading lesson for the first few months. 

(4) Insist on the proper position of lips, t-ongue, and teeth 
in sounding the letters. 

(5) Work constantly for rapidity. 

(6) Work for the individual; concert work is absolutely use¬ 
less. 

(7) Do not leave the first list of letters until each child 
knows and can tell instantly the sounds of all the letters. 

(£) As soon as some facility in sounding is achieved, encourage 
the child to sound the words silently and to give them as wholes.

The Children* s Method Reader 

(Gray, 1943, pp. 20, 21) 

This was one of the phonic methods used in the twenties. The 
materials of reading used in initial stages were largely drills 
on parts of words. These were often "the families" or "final 
blends" (bay, ray, gay, say, day, hay, may) • The method was 
dressed up with interest-catching devices designed to associate 
the sounds with objects and animals. A picture of a growling dog 
was expected to help recall the "r" sound. A cow mooing was 
associated with the "m" sound, and a babbling baby with the "b" 
sound. Phonetic element cards were used for seat work in word 
building. 

Lessons on blending of initial consonants were a large part 

of the contents of the book. This blending proceeded by logical 

steps, e.g., in sounding the word"thinking", "One" brings "th", 

"two" brings "ink", "three" brings "ing", "four" brings "thinking." 

Two sounding methods were used in initial stages. The first method 

used the initial sound as the first step. E.g. - 1 2 3 . Tine 

m at mat 

second method used the phonogram as the first step; e.g. - 1 2 . 

at mat 


Moore -ff ilson Readers 
(Gray,’ 1943, pp. 22, 23) 

These phonic readers appeared in 1927. In this system the 
vowels were "fairies". The long sounds were their names and the 
short sounds their nicknames. Fairy rules were given for determin¬ 
ing which vowel sound should be used. E.g. - When there is only 
one Fairy in a word it says its nickname - unless it is on the end

of the word. Another example, in verse, was as follows: 

When just one Fairy* s in a word, 

Rule one it will obey 

Because it likes its nickname best 

Its nickname it will say. 

A page for blending words such as b-aclc, h-ack, etc. was 
entitled "Help Jack make Fairy »a* words." The phonic reader, 

"A Peep into Fairyland," was liberally sprinkled with drawings 
of fairies in the hope, probably, that they would exert enough 
magic to lead the beginning readers safely through such pages. 

Gray (1956, pp. 79 , 80) described some changes which have 
been introduced in the original phonic methods in response to 
such criticisms. Four of these innovations designed to make the 
learning of the sounds of letters more interesting are: 

(1) Pictures representing animals or people in familiar 
situations accompanied the letters in the first primer. The sound 
normally made in such a. situation was that of the letter to be 
learned; e.g., the squealing of a pig to indicate the sound of the 
letter e. One objection to this was that the sound illustrated 

in the picture was not always the same as that of the letter when 
it occurred in words. 

(2) Pictures representing words in which the initial sound 
was the same as that of the letter accompanying it, have been used 
for years. This was often called the 1 key-word* method. As the 
word was pronounced, attention was directed to its initial sound. 
This sound was then associated with the letter printed beside the 
picture. This procedure aroused interest end directed attention to

the sound of the letter in natural pronunciation, thus avoiding 
distortion of the sound. 

(3) The form of the letter was sometimes drawn over the 
picture the key word represented in such a way that the letter 
appeared to be derived from the picture. This technique was based 
on the assumption that many vivid aids to memory were required for 
the learning of new letters and sounds. One criticism of this 
technique was that the resemblance between the form of the letter 
and the part of the object over which it was drawn was sometimes 
too far-fetched to be of any value. The latest interpretation of 
this method is the one by McKee (1958) called Learning Letter Sounds . 

(4) A multi-sensory appeal is made through the presentation 
of the letter both visually and orally in connection with words 
and with pictures representing words whose initial sounds were 
the same as that of the letter. 

These changes in phonic methods have been intended to increase 
its appeal, vitalize its content and make it more effective. The 
newer techniques have become more and more analytic-synthetic in 
character and have placed greater emphasis on the meaning of what 
is read. In many centres the term psycho-phonetic* has been 
adapted to distinguish the improved phonic methods now used from 
the highly formal phonic methods of earlier times. 

Huey (1912, pp. 255, 256) traced the early history of the 
phonic method in America. It had, apparently,been the method used 
b 3 ^ Jansenists in the Port Royal Schools. For a time it was neg¬ 
lected and then, in 1790, it was again advocated by Thornton.

About 1870 - 1873 it began to be used extensively as a special 
method in the system of Leigh. Smith (1934> P* 69), Hildreth 
(1958, p. 335) and others have agreed on the reasons for the 
interest in phonics during the period of nationalistic fervor 
toward the end of the eighteenth century. Noah Webster (1798) 
was credited with having invented phonics as a tool for pronouncing 
words because of his interest in standardizing American speech. 
About 1840 a reaction to the mechanical nature of the phonic and 
alphabet-phonic methods popularized the word method. Between 
1880 and 1918 elaborate phonic systems were devised as a reaction 
against over-dependence on the word-method, in vshich children were 
expected to learn a large stock of words bjr sight with little or 
no method for attacking unfamiliar words independently. These new 
rugged phonic systems vied with the 'word and sentence methods for 
supremacy until the years following the first world war. During 
the period of emphasis upon silent reading and experience methods 
the phonic method was in the wane. In the 1920‘s and early 1930‘s 
a second reaction against phonics set in. Although the old phonic 
methods never have regained their popularity,there developed in the 
late 1930* s and 1940* s a new emphasis on the teaching of phonics 
along with other aids to word recognition. These new phonetic 
methods were not separate approaches to beginning reading instruct¬ 
ion but were an integral part of a basic reading program. Phonetic 
units were not used as units of instruction at beginning stages 
but were discovered by the pupils through word analysis later in 
the program as aids to develop word recognition skill. Gates*

intrinsic method (Gates, 1930, pp. 204-208) and the eclectic 
methods of the rm basic readers included phonics in their plans 
for teaching in the new balanced reading programs. (Gray, 1948, 
pp. 27-31). 

These newer methods are not considered to be wholly "phonic 
methods" of teaching reading. The traditional phonic methods ex¬ 
emplified in the elaborate phonic systems of the early 1900* s - 
those mechanical, synthetic approaches based on the use of sound 
elements in teaching beginning reading - are the methods commonly 
called "phonic" methods. 

The traditional phonic and phonetic methods were based on 
the belief that all that was necessary in the teaching of reading 
was to teach children to convert printed words into sounds. 

Suzzalo (1918, p. 119) suggested that the educators who advocated 
this method did so on the faith that, once the printed word was 
sounded, the already existing association between pronunciation 
and meaning would complete the pathway to meaning. Effective read¬ 
ing was dependent upon the association of three factors - the 
meaning which the word symbolized, the visual form of the word, 
and its pronunciation. Because the past experiences of the child 
have already been associated with the spoken language, the problem 
appeared to be that of supplying the missing association between 
the printed or visual form and the pronunciation. If the words on 
the page were within the spoken vocabulary of the child then, it 
would seem, their meanings would be recognized if the child could 
be given power to convert what he saw into sound. It was assumed

that, in the natural course of events, the association between 
print and meaning would then became a direct one. This assumption 
implied that reading was a process of word-recognition that con¬ 
sisted of pronouncing the words, that words could be pronounced 
by sounding them out and that the process of sounding could be 
carried out by a simple association of a sound with each letter 
symbol. 

Comments by educators concerning the phonic or phonetic 
methods drew attention to their strengths and weaknesses, Huey 
(1912, p, 266 ) observed that the phonic method developed the abil¬ 
ity to sound the letters of any new word and to pronounce it by- 
blending these sounds. This use of the sounds of the letters, or 
phonograms, in reading was one of the chief advantages of the 
phonic method. Anderson and Dearborn (1952, p. 20 3) pointed out 
that when a person pronounced the sounds of the letters correctly, 
and was able to blend them, the result was that he actually said 
the word. This procedure was a great improvement over the spelling 
of the word advocated in the alphabet method. 

Suzzalo pointed out how single letters with more than one 
sound, silent letters and several letters grouped to represent a 
single sound, interfered with the efficiency of the phonic method. 
He described two attempts that were made to give each sound its 
own characteristic symbol. One was the use of additional characters 
(44 in all) similar in general appearance to show diffeieitiation. 

The other was through the insertion of diacritical marks. The in¬ 
evitable reaction against reading words as they are not presented

in books directed emphasis away from this word distortion back to 
the syllable as the basic unit. This inflexible syllabic unit 
"which does not correspond to the child's natural way of analyz¬ 
ing or building words was replaced by phonogrammic methods which 
provided more flexible natural units separating words purely on 
the basis of their sound divisions." 

Suzzalo's evaluation of the phonic methods drew attention 
to four tendencies which indicated the fallacies underlying the 
work of those who had stressed word-sound translation as the chief 
means of teaching reading to beginners. These tendencies were as 
follows: 

(1) Those methods are chiefly synthetic act the start but 

% tend to become an analytic-synth etic method. First the child 
is given the alphabet and its names, and then builds the 
word-sound from the units. Later with the phonogram he 
breaks the word up into familiar sight units that are nat¬ 
ural to him and then blends them into the pronunciation of 
the word. 

(2) The units for handling sounds grows larger; letter, 
syllable, phonogram, sight word. 

(3) There is decreasing artificiality in the teaching devices 
employed. E.g., note the abolition of diacritical marks. 

(4) The use of larger units and more natural methods frees 
the child's attention from mere phonetic translation and 
permits it to focus in larger degree on the meaning he is 
trying to obtain from his reading. (Suzzalo, 1918, p. 119). 

Suzzalo further claimed that there was a fundamental fallacy 
in placing complete dependence on phonic methods in teaching begin¬ 
ners to read. He conceded that the assumption that children would 
gain meanings from their reading if they could translate the printed 
words into correct pronunciation seemed reasonable when the words 
used in the reading were within the child's experience, but he con¬ 
tended that even when this was the case, children who were engrossed 
with the mere mechanical translation of symbol into sounds hardly

let these normal associations enter into their thoughts. They 
became mere pronouncers, the "parrot-readers n known to every 
school system. 

Judd (1918, pp. 6, 7) noted two main differences between 
the method of phonic analysis and the ABC method: 

(1) Words were broken into sound elements, not into visual 
or letter unit®. 

(2) Phonic methods were inductive in procedure. Word wholes 
with which the child was familiar in oral speech were analyzed. 

The child arrived at the phonic elements by breaking up this larger 
original unit. 

To illustrate these differences Judd compared the method in 
Webster*s Speller, which built up words by adding together single 
letters, with the phonic methods, which began not by building up 
new words out of elements but by discovering sound elements in 
words already known to the pupil. In making this comparison he 
emphasized the fact that the child who was thus equipped, through 
discoveries in earlier analysis, with power in attacking new words, 
could later unravel new combinations through synthesis of the 
phonetic elements into new word wholes. The main difference be¬ 
tween these two approaches was that the phonic elements in the 
second instance, although used synthetically in final stages, were 
first derived by analysis. This inductive approach was a strong 
feature of the methods which have been emphasized in the newer 
intrinsic approach (Gates, 1930) and the eclectic procedures in 
the new basal readers (Gray, 1948).

Anderson and Dearborn (1952, pp; 207-211),in their appraisal 
of the phonetic method, maintained that learning the sounds of the 
letters as the first step in teaching children to read suffered 
the same basic limitations as learning the letter names. The 
sounds of the letters had no more meaning in themselves than did 
the letter names. Anderson and Dearborn pointed out that is was 
a mistake to ask children what letters "said", for isolated letters 
do not "say 11 anything. In the experience of these writers, reading 
became too largely an exercise in mere word pronunciation which 
commonly resulted in developing the "word-calling" habit. Rate and 
meaning both suffered and children found the process of learning 
to read a pretty grim business. In addition the phonetic method 
suffered the limitation that English does not hew to the line 
phonetically, a matter already discussed by both Huey and Suzzalo. 
Vowels are the chief culprits in this regard because each represents 
several sounds. Some consonants, especially those which have "soft" 
and "hard" sounds, can be equally perplexing. This variability in 
the relationship between sound and symbol is further complicated 
by the presence of silent letters. Anderson and Dearborn, recog¬ 
nizing these inconsistencies in the language, suggested that the 
most comfortable 'way to come by the sounds of the letter names was 
by a process of analysis. This would necessarily mean that a 
child should have a vocabulary of sight words before phonics is 
taught. Developing the vocabulary of sight words first would elim¬ 
inate phonics as the approach to beginning reading.

Stone (1950, pp. 174-178) also recognized the difficulties 
presented by these language inconsistencies. He pointed out that, 
although sound appeared to be a better wa y to decipher new and 
unfamiliar words than was spelling, the difficulties encountered 
in attempting to associate single sounds with a vowel letter, or 
even with some consonant letters and diagraphs, were numerous and 
practically insurmountable. Devices such as modified, more 
phonetic characters, and diacritical marks to indicate pronunciation 
merely complicated the process and increased teaching difficulties. 
The phonetic method, like the alphabet method, would give the child 
a means for attacking new words, but a method based primarily on 
the phonetic approach was highly mechanical and developed the wrong 
attitude toward reading. The phonetic method was necessarily a 
one-sided method, and the child who developed rhythmical expression 
in oral residing, and economical and efficient silent reading, under 
a phonetic system did so in spite of the method. Stone contended 
that it was generally agreed in 1935 that the phonetic approach to 
reading was wrong and he considered that decision a great advance 
over the situation prevalent before that time. On the other hand, 
he did not agree with those who opposed any direct instruction in 
phonics. Instead he commended the position of Dr. Gates who advo¬ 
cated the idea that a working knowledge of phonetics could and 
should be acquired, partly incidentally and partly by the indirect 
intrinsic method, wherein comprehension exercises were specially 
organized to develop skill in word perception and analysis. A 
combination of phonics with word, sentence or story methods seemed

to Stone to be more desirable than any of the pure phonic systems 
used by itself. 

According to Gray (1956, p. 77) the defense for all methods 
which lay initial emphasis on elements of words and their sounds 
rested on the eventual time-saving value of having pupils develop 
accuracy and independence in word recognition early and in having 
them become acquainted with the form and structure of the language. 
His criticisms of these atomized and synthetic methods were as 
follows: 

(1) If elements of words are introduced at the start, the 
child*s natural mode of learning is disregarded. 

(2) The teaching of reading is treated as a highly special¬ 
ized procedure, largely dependent on logical considerations. 

(3) The subject matter is not related directly to child 
interests, to other classroom activities or language arts. 

(4) Both the content and the methods are imposed by the teacher. 

(5) So much attention is paid to word elements and new words 
that other essential aspects of reading are neglected and 

pupils fail to acquire an interest in reading for pleasure or 
information. 

(6) Span of recognition and ability to read fluently for 
meaning develop very slowly if at all. (Gray, 1956, p. 79). 

Gray (1956, p. 79) pointed out the contribution the phonic 
method made in providing for the use of sounds of letters in teach¬ 
ing word recognition. This sounding of letters brought the reader 
much closer to the pronunciation of the word than did the earlier 
spelling methods. Gray listed other advantages claimed for the 
method. These advantages were that it was logical and economical, 
carefully graded, and complete with respect to the phonetic elements 
and easy to apply. 

In his criticisms of the phonic method Gray stated that pract¬ 
ically all the "phonic” methods were based on the plan of breaking

words into phonetic elements and then supplying drill on these 
elements, by means of groups of words in which the element 
occurred. The reading material of the primers which followed 
these methods consisted largely of disjointed sentences, built 
up of phonetically selected words as they were developed from day 
to day. In the very nature of things, reading material constructed 
on this artificial basis was certain to lack continuity of thought. 
"Indeed," Gray wrote, "pages of such primers and first readers may 
be read almost as effectively by beginning with the last sentence 
and reading to the top of the page as by reading in the usual way 
from top to bottom." (Gray, 1943, p. 19). 

Gray later pointed out four weaknesses of the phonetic method: 
(1956, p. 79) 

(1) Consonants could be accurately sounded only in combination 
with vowels. When pupils uttered them separately, other sounds 
were often added. This caused confusion when they tried to link 
the consonants to form words. 

(2) The method is not practicable in all languages. In those 
languages which are only partly phonetic, the sounds of the letters 
must be supplemented by other aids to word recognition such as mean¬ 
ing, word-form clues, structural analysis of words and the dictionary. 

(3) The method, while focusing attention on word recognition, 
failed to develop an understanding of what is read. As early as 
1912 Dunville pointed out that the child was so preoccupied with 
the process of deciphering words that little reading in the sense 

of comprehension could occur. Schonell (1946, p. 47) too considered

that it interfered with the idea of grasping words, phrases and 
sentences as meaningful language units. The method, for this 
reason, often produced "word callers" rather than readers. 

(4) Another objection was that the learning procedures 
were often so formal as to involve the repetition of meaningless 
elements and the development of a dislike for reading. 

Gates (1930) pointed out five weaknesses in the orthodox 
phonetic methods. These were briefly as follows: 

(1) Transfer of skill was rarely complete. Techniques learned 
in word study were not widely applied when the sound was primarily 
employed in thought getting. 

(2) Much time was spent in mere word form analysis which 
provided no experience in reading for the thought. 

(3) When phonics was employed as extensively as it was in some 
schools it resulted in an over-emphasis of certain habits until they 
became more detrimental than helpful. The habit of picking a word 
into small phonetic pieces, while useful in moderation, could be 
overexercised until the pupil was unable to perceive words clearly 
and easily as wholes. A very analytical method cf working out the 
recognition and pronunciation of words interfered with fluency in 
reading. 

(4) The most important defect was that the phonetic method 
did not exercise together the various techniques that needed to 
work together. Context clues and word-form clues, which are im¬ 
portant keys to word-recognition, were never practiced with a quick 
perceptive analysis of the word forms as they normally function

together in the actual process of word-recognition. 

(5) The assumption that a mastery of a fairly small number 
of phonograms would enable the pupil to recognize and pronounce 
all, or nearly all, the words he would encounter in reading was 
unsound. Gates (1928) reported on this in Chapter IX of his book 
on methods of primary reading. 

Gates summarized his point of view- in this way: 

Phonetic training should have a place in the modem 
reading program. It is one of the several means of develop¬ 
ing independence in word-recognition. Phonetics, it should 
be noted, is one of several useful devices, it alone should 
not be regarded as a sufficient means of developing effective 
word recognition. (Gates, 1942, p.l) 

Betts (1946, pp. 614-616) described an undesirable type of 
phonics which was characterized by the teaching of phonics as the 
chief aid to word recognition. The method used was a synthetic 
one involving drill on isolated words and on the blending of phon¬ 
ograms into words. This type of phonics instruction he considered 
contributed little to Independence and fluency in reading and had 
no value. He listed eight indictments often leveled against phon¬ 
etic instruction as follows: 

(1) . Overemphasis on phonics as an aid to word recognition 
produced ’’word callers”. Reading then deteriorated into a merely 
mechanical process, devoid of meaning. 

(2) Overemphasis on phonics slowed down the reading rate. 

(3) Overemphasis on phonics reduced interest in reading. 

( 4 ) Unnatural articulation was often produced by unwise phonic 


instruction

(5) Phonic skills did not carxy over into normal reading 
situations. 

(6) Not all children could profit from the usual phonics 
instruction. 

(7) The "unphonetic character 1 ’ of our English language did 
not lend itself to phonetic analysis for the beginner. 

(3) The usual letter-type phonics instruction did not carry 
over to the pronunciation of polysyllabic words. 

Betts considered that a desirable type of phonetic instruction 
had an important place in beginning reading instruction in develop¬ 
ing independence in word recognition. He pointed out very clearly 
that phonics is only one word recognition technique and that word- 
recognition itself is not the major goal of beginning reading in¬ 
struction. 

Several other educators have pointed out the value and place 
of phonics in a reading program. Dolch (193S) has expressed his 
views on the teaching of phonics this way: 

Phonics have a recognized place in the teaching of 
reading. Despite many complaints about the ineffective 
teaching of phonics, th ere is common agreement that the 
child who cannot sound out the new words he meets is trem¬ 
endously handicapped in any independent reading. In times 
past the abuses in the teaching of phonics have called for 
sharp criticism and evaluation. (Dolch, 193B, p. 120). 

Hildreth (1936) stated the problem clearly: 

Phonics instruction instead of dominating reading 
practice as formerly now assumes its legitimate place in 
the reading process as one technique of word analysis. 

Phonics practice is now recognized not as a method of teach¬ 
ing reading, but as a valuable adjunct to the child in 
comprehending unfamiliar words he meets in reading context.

On the same page Hildreth pointed out these four limit¬ 
ations of the phonetic method: 

(1) The child who used phonetic analysis skillfully was 

the child who was mature in speech-sound discrimination and visual 
perception, 

(2) The child who was skillful in the use of phonics was also 
bright enough to identify similar sound elements in words, such as 
rhyming of terminal sounds. Mental tests prove this activity to 
be more suited to the eight-year-old mentality than the six-year- 
old. This fact accounted for the large amount of failure among 
beginners who were instructed by phonetic methods. 

(3) Children often failed to carry over into the actual read¬ 
ing material the elaborate skill in phonetic analysis developed 
through phonetic drills. 

(4) Overemphasis on phonics underemphasized thought-getting 
and the use of context clues. 

Storm and Smith (1930, p. 249) summarized the situation by 
stating: 

Training in word analysis should constitute only one 

part of a well-balanced program, a program which also makes 

provision for the development of appreciation, comprehension, 

interpretation, speed, and good habits of eye-movement. 

This broadening of reading objectives contributed to reveal¬ 
ing the position of the phonetic method as incomplete and insuffic¬ 
ient as an approach to beginning reading instruction. 

These comments suggested a treatment of phonics in the reading 
program quite unlike that procedure followed in the elaborate 
phonetic systems which used phonics as a first step and the main 
approach to the teaching of beginning reading.

The Yearbooks of the National Society for the Study of Educ¬ 
ation stated a definite position regarding the place and function 
of phonics in reading. 'The committee for the Twenty-fourth Year¬ 
book recognized conflicting opinions regarding the place of phonetic 
training in teaching beginning reading. The committee pointed out 
the need to examine certain claims and assumptions which were being 
made. The following four points were mentioned: 

(1) The value of definite phonetic methods was magnified 
when compared with the results of poor teaching. 

(2) Unsupported claims were made as to the superiority of 
one phonetic method over another. 

(3) The assumption was that, since a word was composed of 
phonetic elements, it could be taught more easily through phonetics. 

(4) Both untrained teachers and untrained administrators 
could understand and cope more easily with teaching which resulted 
in word-calling rather than thought-getting. 

The committee warned that phonics badly taught did more harm than 
good but claimed that most of the objections to the teaching of 
phonics was based on poor teaching methods. In the suggested prog¬ 
ram of instruction they did not advocate teaching phonics as the 
first step in beginning instruction in reading. They included it 
in the program but warned against over-emphasis on phonetic analysis, 
premature introduction of phonetic training, over-systematic early 
work and isolation of phonetic training. Since these are all char¬ 
acteristic of the early phonic methods it appears that the committee 
favored other methods than the pure phonetic for the teaching of 
beginning reading.

In the Thirty-sixth Yearbook of the National Society for the 
Study of Education McKee (1937, pp. 239-294) pointed out thirteen 
principles for a program in word recognition. Included among them 
are these statements which referred to phonics: 

1. Word elements should be recognized first by discovering 
them in words, not in isolation. 

2. Certain types of intensive and formal phonetic practices 
should be avoided. For example, it is futile to try to teach beg¬ 
inning pupils to give exactly all the forty or more letter sounds. 

To insist on their sounding out all words fully and definitely is 
a great error. When the sources of suggestion - the general con¬ 
text, the meaning of the particular sentence, and the general 
appearance of the word as a whole and in its parts - are well used, 
complete sounding of all the elements is seldom necessary. (McKee, 
1937, p. 293). 

These principles were contrary to the procedures followed in the 
old phonic methods and suggested that, by 1936, the old synthetic 
phonetic approach to the teaching of beginning reading was not in 
agreement with the principles upon which the newer programs were 
based. 

In the Forty-eighth Yearbook on Reading in the Elementary 
School , Beery (1949, pp. ISO, 181) pointed out the values of phonics 
as established by studies by Smith (1943) and Agnew (1939) and 
described a procedure for teaching phonics as one means of word 
recognition. The formal isolated drills on phonics which charac¬ 
terized the highly organized, systematized, elaborated nineteenth

century methods Beery claimed had persisted only until the 1920*s 
when most schools had dropped phonics as outdated or because it 
was regarded as intrinsically wrong. Beery considered that, in 
194 &> the new treatment of phonics indicated that the pendulum 
had swung back to a more reasonable position. 

The strengths of the phonetic and phonetic methods are 
summarized briefly as follows: 

1. Phonetic methods provided the child with a technique for 
figuring out new words independently. Using a sounding technique 
for pronouncing words was far more effective in gaining pronunciation 
than the old spelling technique. 

2. Teaching phonics early saved time in developing accuracy 
and independence in word recognition. Through phonetic analysis 
of new words the child gained clues to its pronunciation. 

3. The child, through the use of phonics, became acquainted 
with the form and structure of words. He developed an understand¬ 
ing of the relationships existing between the sounds in the spoken 
word and the letter symbols in printed words. This understanding 
created an awareness of, and a familiarity vfith, the general struct¬ 
ure of words. 

The weaknesses of phonetic methods brought out in the previous 
discussions are many. Nine main deficiencies are stated here: 

1. The method developed mere ’’pronouncers”, ”word-callers” 
and ’’parrot readers.” Attention was so concentrated on sounding 
and on elements in new words that meaning associations were not 
readily made. Reading for meaning and other essential aspects of

in reading for pleasure. 

2. The method was highly mechanical and developed the 
wrong attitude toward reading. Reading according to this mechan¬ 
ical process was devoid of meaning. 

3. The material used was disjointed and artificial and 
lacked continuity of thought. Because sounds of letters were mean¬ 
ingless to children and the subject matter was not related to child’s 
interests,devices to arouse interest artificially and to provide for 
the necessary meaningless repetitions complicated the process of 
learning. 

4. Introducing elements of words from the start, rather than 
beginning with meaningful \¥holes, disregarded the child’s natural 
mode of learning. 

5. The method overemphasized certain habits in reading until 
they became more detrimental than helpful. Unnatural articulation 
was often produced by unwise phonic instruction involving sound 
distortions. Narrow span of recognition and slow reading rate 
were encouraged by the over-emphasis on phonics. Rate and fluency 
both suffered when attention was concentrated on details in words. 

6. Transfer of skill was rarely complete. Phonic skills did 
not carry over into the reading process. This was largely because, 
in learning through the phonetic method, the child did not exercise 
together the various techniques that worked together. Instruction 
in the usual letter-type phonics did not carry over to the pronun¬ 
ciation of polysyllabic words.

7. All children could not profit from the usual phonic 
instruction at the beginning reading stage. Ability in auditory 
discrimination of sounds and a minimum mental age were necessary 
before instruction in phonics was meaningful to the child. Read¬ 
iness in certain specific ways was necessary for the child to 
understand phonetic relationships. 

S. The unphonetic character of the English language does 
not lend itself to phonetic analysis for the beginner. Irregular¬ 
ities in letter associations such as the existence of silent letters 
and letter groups which represented a single sound interfered with 
the efficiency of the method. Variability in the relationships 
between sounds end symbols further complicated the problem. The 
difficulties encountered because of these irregularities were 
numerous and practically insurmountable. 

9. The assumption that mastery of a fairly small number of 
phonograms enabled the child to recognize and pronounce all, or 
nearly all, English words was unsound. 

The phonic methods have one major contribution to make to 
reading methodology. This contribution is the result of the atten¬ 
tion the phonic methods centred on the form and structure of words 
through the phonetic analysis of them. The body of knowledge about 
phonetic relationships and the general structure of words that was 
thus built up forms one important means for teaching children how 
to figure out new words independently. The phonetic methods have 
provided one technique for developing independent word recognition.

The weight of evidence to be deduced from the statements of 
authorities on the teaching of reading seems to indicate that the 
pure phonetic method is not a good method to use in beginning in¬ 
struction in reading. As an approach to beginning reading phonics 
has been eliminated. Phonics is, however, an important part of a 
program in word recognition but, before it is taught, a vocabulary 
of sight words must be developed. Phonics serves a useful purpose 
when used in combination with other methods. Judd suggests an 
analytic or inductive rather than a synthetic or deductive approach 
to the tes.ching of phonics. Gates embodied this in his intrinsic 
method. These newer phonic methods in use today are significantly 
different to the original phonetic methods which used phonics as 
the approach to instruction in beginning reading.

THE WORE AND LOOK-SAY METHODS 


The word method has travelled under many different names. 

Gray, in 1956, called it a "see-and-say” method, Bond and Wagner, 
a "word-drill" method and Anderson and Dearborn a "laok-and-say" 
method. In the examples in his 1943 publication Gray referred to 
the method as a "word-and-sentence" one. Whatever the particular 
name used for it, this method, basically,used word-wholes in the 
initial stages of teaching. 

Huey outlined the nature of the word method briefly as follows: 

In the word method, the whole sound of the word is assoc¬ 
iated with the ?7ord* s total visual appearance, and is suggested 
just as the name of any other object comes to mind on seeing 
the whole object; children learn the name of a word about as 
quickly as that of a letter, end recognize the whole word 
about as quickly as they recognize a single letter. A word 
is not a sum of letter-names, nor even of letter-appearances, 
but has a character of its own. The word method short-circuits 
the whole process of word learning. (Huey, 1912, p. 272). 

The procedure in an initial lesson in reading using the word 

method was simple and direct, employing pictures in the presentation 

and various games and drill devices for practice in word recognition. 

'i'he teacher showed or drew the picture of an object, such as a hen, 

and then asked the children to name it. She then showed or wrote 

the word "hen" and told the children that this printed word meant 

the same as the picture. By using games and drill devices the 

teacher got the children to look repeatedly at the word hen and call 

it by name. In this way words were introduced. After a small sight 

vocabulary had been built up the words were put into sentences for 

the children to read. After a basic vocabulary of one hundred or

two hundred words had been developed in this fashion the reading 
of paragraphs was undertaken. All nevf words to be learned were 
learned in this "lock-say" manner, through the use of similar 
’Word-drill" procedures. (Bond and Wagner, 1950, pp. 86, 87). 

The readers which were listed by Gray and Smith as typical 
examples of word methods were the following: 

(1) Bumstead f s Readers, first published about 1840 including " My 
Little Primer " and "My First Schoo l Book." (Smith, 1934, pp. 

87, 91-94). 

(2) Webb* s " New Word Method " Readers first published in 1846. 

(Smith, 1934, pp. 88-91, 94-98). 

(3) " Normal Course in Reading " (copyright 1888 - 1897 and dropped 
from the publishers* catalogue in 1924) • (Gray, 1948, pp. 4, 5). 

(4) " Wheeler* s Graded Readers " (copyright 1900) which illustrates 
the content of the "word-and-sentence" readers. (Gray, 1948, 
pp. 6, 7). 

The contents and procedures featured in these early reading series 
are described briefly in the following paragraphs. 

Bumstead* s Readers 
(Smith, 1934, pp. 91, 92) 

This was one of the earliest of the word method series. The 
full title of the Primer was "My Little Primer going before My First 
School Book to get me ready for it." (Bumstead 1840). The distinc¬ 
tive feature of the primer was its departure from the usual introduc¬ 
tory pages given over to the alphabet and syllabarium. The introduc¬ 
tory pages were devoted entirely to lists of words. These words

were selected on the basis of child experience and were organized 
according to related meanings. Parts of the human head and body 
were enumerated and, sometimes, words in columns were intended to 
convey the thought of a complete sentence. This practice was 
probably to encourage memorisation. E.g. -

Webb* s Readers 
(Smith, 1934, PP. 94-98) 

The primer "Webb’s Normal Header, No. 1" (Webb, 1855) was 
organized into three parts: 

Part I: Words 

Part II: Teaching New Words, Reading, Spelling, the Alphabet, 

Sounds of Letters. 

Part III: A Speller as Well as a Reader, Teaching Children to spell 
Columns of Words and Pronounce at Sight before Reading. 
Hie content was derived from objects in the child* s environ¬ 
ment or from experiences representative of child life. Increased 
attention to method was evident in the liberal distribution of 
"Directions for Teachers" throughout the text. The assumption gen¬ 
erally was that, when the child had learned all the words in the 
spelling lessons, he could "read the reading lessons right off."

The N orma l Course in Reading 
(Gray, 194S, PP« 4, 5) 

This is an example of a word-method series -used in the early 
1900* s. Pictures were employed in the initial presentation of 
some words (mostly nouns) which were printed in manuscrirjt and 
print. The lessons designed to give practice in words repeated 
the words in different phrases hut in quite meaningless context. 

E.g. - On page 14 of the primer there were pictures of a large 
cup and a small one with these phrases above them: 

"Here is Here are" 

(one cup) (two cups) 

Below the pictures was the following text: 

Here is my large cup. 

Here is my small cup. 

My cups are here. 

One cup is large. 

One cup is small. 

This cup is large. 

That cup is not large. 

That cup is small. 

As the authors (Todd and Powell, 1888, p. 4) suggested that 
"no part of the purpose of this early work in reading is to train 
the child to get thought from the printed page", lessons were designed 
solely to give practice in word recognition. 

ffheele r * s Graded Readers 
(Gray, 1948, pp; 6, 7) 

Pages 14 and 15 of the Primer (Wheeler, 1900) illustrated 
the content of these "word-and-sentence" readers. Page 14 used 
pictures of a child 1 s hands to illustrate numbers from one to five 
with closed hand hiding all but the required number of fingers. Then,

using the words, I, see, can, the number words, and pictures of 
fishes, cats, tops, etc., eight lines of print provided drill on 
the new words in the following manner: 

I see four (picture of four fishes) 

I can see two (picture of two cats)• 

Page 15 introduced three new words - apples, big, my - and 
these are combined,with words already introduced,in the following 
sentences: 

See my three big apples*. 

I like my big apples. 

Baby likes little apples. 

Baby is little. I am big. 

I love a little baby. 

Baby loves a little kitty. 

iy mama loves me. (Wheeler, 1900, p. 15). 

These reading series concentrated on the recognition and 
pronunciation of word wholes. There was little or no attempt to 
teach word-analysis skills. The word was emphasized as the initial 
teaching unit and a sentence, designed to give further drill on 
words, was the reading unit. 

Huey (1912, p. 272) traced the histciy of the word method from 
its beginning by Comenius in his n 0rbis Pictus* 1 in 1657 through 
its use by the reformer Jacot&t in France in 1770 and its popul- 
ity in Germany two decades later to the time of its introduction 
into America by Horace Mann and Worcester about 1837. Interest in 
the method developed as a result of the visits of Horace Mann to 
the Prussian schools. The popularity of the word method grew because 
of the reaction, that was taking place in the country, to the undesir¬ 
able results of the use of the more atomized, tedious and mechanical

alphabet and early phonic approaches to the teaching of reading. 
The years between 1840 and 1850 were productive of vigorous 
protest against the Alphabet method by educational leaders who 
considered the word method to be a much more sensible procedure. 
About 1840 Bumstead and Webb introduced primers which were based 
on this method, but these were little used until 1870. The word 
method vied with the phonic systems for popularity during the 
latter part of the nineteenth century. 

In 1912 Huey (1912, p. 272) claimed that the word method was 
used very generally in America. During the early 1900*s the word- 
and-sentence and story methods developed from the word method. In 
combination with other methods the word method is used widely and 
well today. From the time of its introduction by Horace Mann, it 
has been an important influence in beginning reading instruction. 

The advent of the word method was so startling that a cursory 
examination of the writings on this subject leaves the impression 
that the entire procedure for teaching reading was revolutionized 
by its introduction. As a matter of fact, as Smith (1934* p. 90) 
claimed, it affected only the beginning stages of reading instruc¬ 
tion end was not felt at all in the methods used in connection 
'with the advanced grades. The greatest innovation, according to 
Smith (1934* p* 90), was that the child learned entire words during 
his first weeks of reading instruction. As soon as this task was 
achieved, however, spelling end phonetics were employed in the same 
capacity and with emphasis equal to that found in the alphabet- 
phonetic methods which have been described earlier in this study.

The word method was based on the assumption that the word was 
the unit of recognition in reading. Judd, Wheat and others quoted 
Horace Mann f s arguments for this method in his annual report to 
the Board of Education in 1837. Mann contended that n it was about 
as easy to learn a word unit as a letter unit and suggested that 
children could learn twenty-six familiar words with more ease than 
twenty-six unfamiliar meaningless letters. Mann stated his case as 
follows: 

«... .presenting the children with the alphabet is giving them 
what they never saw, heard, or thought before..... But the 
printed name of known things are the signs of sounds which 
their ears have been accustomed to hear, and their organs of 
speech to utter. It can hardly be doubted therefore that a 
child would learn to name 26 familiar words sooner than the 
unknown, unheard-of and un-thought of letters of the alphabet. 
(Mann, 1337). 

Suzzalo (1913, pp. 113-122) supported the view that the total 
visual form of the word was associated with its whole sound and that 
the pronunciation of a word was not a sum of its letter sounds but 
had its own character as a unit. Suzzalo also maintained that all 
these assumptions were borne out by the conclusions of experimental 
psychology. 

The eye-movement studies reported by Judd (1918), Buswell 
(1922) and Gray (1925, Winch (1925) and Potter (1948) supported the 
Gestalt point of view that words are commonly recognized as wholes 
by their general configuration or pattern. Potter* s survey, which 
was based on an analysis of over 300 studies in word-recognition, 
established this theory, first set forth by Cattell (1386), that 
words are perceived as wholes.

Toakam sets forth an argument to substantiate this as follows: 

The unit of perception in reading for most people is 
not the letter, but rather the word, phrase, or short sentence. 
An experiment by Dodge showed that when the practiced adult 
reader attempts to read by words rather than by sentence, he 
is seriously embarrassed in the process. This fact has great 
significance for teachers of reading because it suggests the 
desirability of teaching by modern word and sentence methods 
rather than by emphasizing the analytical methods of the past. 

The reader forms a percept of the word as a whole rather than 
of the letters of the word separately. This is illustrated by 
the following arrangement of letters which at first glance 
seem meaningless: 

inco mpr ehensib le 

The word is easily recognized in its ordinary arrangement - 
incomprehensible. (Yoakam, 1929, p. 13). 

Comments by educators point out the strengths and weaknesses 
of the method and establish the special contribution of the word 
method to the teaching of beginning reading, 

Huey (1912, p. 272) claimed that the method short-circuited 
the whole process of word learning but he pointed out, too, that the 
method did not give the pupil power to pronounce new words for him¬ 
self. Because phonics is finally necessary for some degree of indepen 
dence in the recognition of new words the word method is usually used 
in combination with other methods. 

Suzzalo (1914> PP* 113-122) deemed the word method to be a more 
economical and natural teaching method than the traditional alphabet 
and phonetic practices of beginning instruction in reading. He assert 
ed that teaching children to read by words was undoubtedly the chief 
basic method used by progressive teachers in his time. It was, though 
almost always supplemented by other methods. In order to give the 
pupil power to pronounce unfamiliar words by himself, some phonic 
work was necessarily associated with the word method.

Judd (1918, p. 6) described this method as one in which 
children were taught words as wholes and learned to recognize 
them without analyzing them into letters. He drew attention to 
a major flaw in the method. He observed that experience soon 
brought out the fact that a child who was not taught to analyze 
the words in his reading usually made rapid progress so long as 
he needed only a small vocabulary and was in contact with short, 
simple words. Such a pupil was commonly lost when he encountered 
long, complicated words or was called on to deal with a long list 
of words. Furthermore, the -word method, when followed in its 
extreme form, left the pupil with little or no ability to spell. 
For this reason there was a reaction against the word method in 
its simple form after it had been tried for a time. Out of that 
reaction gre?/ an emphasis in many quarters on what is known as 
phonetic analysis. 

Iheat (1923, pp. 169-177) considered that the word method 
proved to be incomplete in that it did not lead to an independent 
mastery of words. The new conception of the reading process which 
heralded the word method was modified in ways consistent with the 
following demands: 

(a) For phonic analysis as a supplement to the word method 

(b) For ability to read in units larger than the Yford 

(c) For instruction in silent reading, and 

(d.) For content in the reading materials.

Stone (1936, pp. 173, 174) also pointed out the serious 
weakness of the word method in making no provision for means by 
which a child could decipher a new word. He thought that it was 
for this reason the alphabet method persisted and phonetic methods 
were developed. He claimed that advocates of the word method were 
right in the idea that the word was a feasible unit of recognition 
in beginning reading. He referred to the eye-movement studies 
which indicated that the phrase was not the unit of recognition 
in primary reading even though it is often the unit of meaning 
and, in oral reading, the unit of vocalization. Stone further 
noted the tendency for the word approach to become highly mechan¬ 
ical because attention was centred upon recognizing and saying words, 
phrases and sentences with little or no regard for thought-getting. 
When this was the case the child naturally developed the wrong att¬ 
itude toward the reading process. Stone contended that "until 
interest in content and in understanding and experiencing the mean¬ 
ing became uppermost in the child* s mind in his reading, that 
rhythmical expression of the meaning in oral reading and effective 
silent reading could not be expected to be the usual outcomes.” 
(Stone, 1936, p. 174). 

Adams, Gray and Reese (1949) dre?/ attention to these three 
flaws in the word method: 

(1) Children had to drill on isolated words for quite a while 
before being presented with the opportunity to recognize sentences. 

(2) Children had to read individual words which is just the 
opposite of what is wanted in reading.

(3) Children had learned all words by sight, which gave them 
no independent means of word recognition. (Adams, Gray and Reese, 
1949, p. 47). 

Adams, Gray and Reese agreed with Bond and Wagner, and with Stone, 
in stressing the fact that, when using the word method, getting the 
complete thought came last in the process of reading. 

Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 86, 87) also mentioned the danger 
of deve3.oping readers who proceeded ‘’word-by-word’ 1 or were “overly 
word-conscious”, or who “read words rather than ideas.” They noted 
the need to employ artificial motivating devices to keep the child¬ 
ren’s interest and warned that such devices could not ©rouse the 
amount of interest that normal reading experiences elicited. In 
summary, they admitted that the method, when used in combination 
with other methods, was useful in two respects. The teacher could 
build .a wide sight vocabulary and she could also use it effectively 
when introducing words that did not lend themselves to easy recog¬ 
nition. Bond ©nd Wagner (1950) concluded their discussion of this 
method by saying that “in combination with other methods, it is 
used widely and well today.” (Bond and Wagner, 1950, pp. 86, 87). 

Gray’s (1956) evaluation of the word method quoted the opinion 
of others as follows: 

One of the most frequent criticisms of the word method 
is that it often fails to develop the necessary accuracy end 
independence in word recognition, and therefore results in 
much retardation in reading. Such criticisms were discussed 
at length in The Times Educational Supplement . According to 
IhiteheadJ, the main issue is not whether phonics should be 
used as an aid in word recognition, but when such training 
should begin. Word analysis is often delayed, or even omitted

altogether, by many teachers, reliance being placed on the 
intuitive insight of the pupils for progress in the ability 
to identify and master word elements. However, though 
brighter pupils may be able to make the necessary distinc¬ 
tions between words and acquire skill in word attack without 
much help, most pupils require carefully planned guidance, 
(Gray, 1956, pp, 84, 85) . 

Gray drew attention to the fact that the word method foll¬ 
owed the natural mode of perception in that it proceeded gradually 
from recognition of the basic word unit to the recognition of 
details. This process of learning from whole to part had been 
demonstrated by psychologists as the usual procedure in recognition. 
Gray* s chief criticism of these methods was the neglect of teachers 
to develop word-recognition techniques through the use of the word 
method in beginning instruction. 

The strengths attributed to the word-method are summarized 
as follows: 

(1) It follows the natural mode of perception in that it 
proceeded gradually from perception of the whole word to a recog¬ 
nition of its details. This was in agreement with the Gestalt 
theory of learning from whole to part. 

(2) It uses the natural unit of perception - the word. 

This is the basic unit of perception in the language and is the 
one that is natural and familiar to the child. 

(3) It hastens the whole process of word learning in doing 
away with preliminary word analysis and attention to elements. 

It is more economical method than the alphabet or phonetic methods. 

(4) It provides for building a wide sight vocabulary. 

(5) It provides a good method for introducing words which 
do not lend themselves to phonetic analysis.

The weaknesses of the word method are listed in the following 
four points: 

(1) It does not lead to independent mastery of words* It 
teaches no techniques for word analysis and independent word recog¬ 
nition and leaves the child unable to figure out new words on his 
own. 

( 2 ) It concentrates attention on word recognition with little 
regard for thought getting. The child is encouraged to read in¬ 
dividual words which is just the opposite of what is wanted in 
reading. The child reads words rather than ideas and develops the 
wrong attitude toward reading. The method develops word-by-word 
and overly word-conscious readers just as often as does the alphabet 
and phonetic methods. 

( 3 ) It develops no knowledge of word structure or awareness of 
the details of words. Because of this it develops little or no 
spelling ability. It can lead to haphazard and confused word 
recognition habits. 

(4i It devotes so much attention to drill on isolated words 
that it tends to become a highly mechanical method in the hands of 
some teachers. 

The main contribution of the word method to beginning instruction 
in reading is the focussing of attention on the word as the unit of 
perception. The simplification and use of learning to read through 
first building a sight vocabulary through the use of this method was 
an important innovation in reading methodology. The word method 
introduced a more natural meaningful and economical approach to 
instruction in beginning reading.

In summary it must be stressed that, although the word 
method provided a new technique for introducing children to 
printed materials it had serious limitations. The lack of 
provision for means by which a child could decipher a new word 
made it incomplete as a method of teaching reading. The word 
method is useful and performs a useful function in teaching 
beginning reading, but it must be used in combination with other 
methods. 


SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER 

In the case of each of these methods using the word or its 
elements as the unit for beginning instruction it has been shown 
that none of them could be considered adequate as a single approach 
to the teaching of reading. The faults generally lay in the over¬ 
emphasis on reading as a process of word-recognition and the lack 
of attention given to developing attitudes and habits which 
promoted thought-getting.

CHAPTER IV 


METHODS USING UNITS LARGER THAN THE WORD 


IN BEGINNING INSTRUCTION 

















v -,., 


















81 


CHAPTER IV 

METHODS USING UNITS LA RGER THA N THE WORD 
IN BEGINN ING INSTRUCTION 

The teaching units used in these methods were the phrase, 
sentence, stoiy and rhyme. The methods using these units were 
the phrase, sentence, story, paragraph, nursery-rhyme, slow- 
approach story, story-memory and memory methods. All the ex¬ 
amples of these methods in the teaching of reading used literary 
materials such as folk tales and nursery rhymes as the source of 
the vocabulary used in stories. 

The sentence and stoiy methods were so closely interwoven 
that it is impossible to list them as separate methods. The list 
of primers using these methods is, therefore, a composite of readers 
using combinations of these methods. It is placed after the 
descriptions of the various story methods. 


THE SENTENCE METHOD 

Stone (1936, p. 17b) considered that the mechanical character 
of the alphabet method, the phonic methods, the word methods and 
the various combinations of these methods were responsible for the 
development of the new approach. This was called n the sentence 
method” because the sentence, rather than the word, sound or letter, 
was the first unit presented to the child. This method was the 
natural forerunner of the story method.

Although the sentence method was suggested by Comenius as 
early as 1657 it did not become popular in America until after 
Farnham* s experiments in the schools of Binghamton, New York, 
about 1870, and it was not widely adopted until 1885 - 1890. 

Huey (1912) considered. Famham* s little pamphlet, "The Sentence 
Method of Reading," (1895) to be a fair presentation of the method. 

Farnham (1895) described the principles underlying this 
method in the following quotation: 

The first principle to be observed in teaching reading 
is that things are recognised as wholes. Language follows 
this law. Although it is taught by an indirect process, still, 
in its external characteristics, it follows the law of other 
objects. 

The question arises, "What is the whole? or what is the 
unit of expression?" It is now quite generally conceded that 
we have no ideas not logically associated with others. In 
other words, thoughts, complete in their relations, are the 
materials in the mind out of which the complex relations are 
constructed. 

It being admitted that the thought is the unit of think¬ 
ing, it necessarily follows that the sentence is the unit of 
expression . 

A second principle is: we acquire a knowledge of the 

parts of an object by first considering it as a whole . 

Repeated recognitions reveal the characteristics of the whole, 

so as to separate it from other things.The sentence, if 

properly taught, will in like manner be understood as a whole, 
better than if presented in detail. The order indicated is, 
first the sentence, then the words, and then the letters, ^he 
sentence being first presented as a whole, the words are dis¬ 
covered, and after that the letters composing the word. 

(Smith, 1934, p. 140). 

Both Smith (1934) and Stone (1950) referred to this statement 
as a good description of the theoiy underlying the method, of its 
plan of approach to beginning reading, and of the order of. the in¬ 
structional steps.

Huey (1912, pp. 273, 274) gave a vivid description of the 
use of the sentence method in the following quotation: 

In using the sentence method the teacher has come to 
make much use of the blackboard, A sketch of some object 
or scene interesting to the child suggests to the child a 
thought which he expresses in a sentence. The teacher writes 
this sentence and it is read, naturally with expression 
since the child* s own thought here leads the expression. 

Other sentences are suggested, written, and read, until per¬ 
haps a little story of the picture is finished, all of which 
the child can soon ”read” with natural expression. Sometimes 
the child* s experience on an excursion or at play are thus 
written up as he tells them and made into a story which he 
soon can "read", although not at first knowing the place of 
a single word. But the frequent recurrence of certain word- 
forms, and sometimes substitutions such as **I have a dog,” 

”1 have a knife ,” etc., bring these particular word-forms to 
his attention, and the sentence wholes are gradually analyzed 
into their constituent words and these again, in time, into 
their constituent sounds and letters. The important thing is 
to begin with meaning wholes and sentence wholes, make thought 
lead, and thus secure natural expression, letting analysis 
follow in its own time. 

Illustrations of the sentence method, when used in readers^are 
to be found in the literary primers which also exemplify the story 
method. These readers are listed and described after the descrip¬ 
tions of the story method. As suggested in Huey*s description of 
the sentence method, much of the material was teacher-prepared 
blackboard sentences. These were often suggested by the children 
themselves and were based on familiar objects or pictures. 

The method was first used about 1870. It was widely used 
after 1885 but about 1910 it lost its identity as a separate method 
in its use with the story method in the literary primers. The 
sentence method and the story method were an outgrowth and expan¬ 
sion of the word method and thrived during the period of emphasis 
on reading as a cultural asset. About 1918 the popularity of the

sentence method and the story method waned and a new emphasis in 
instruction brought a different method and new materials. 

The sentence method was based on the principle that the sent¬ 
ence should be the unit used in introducing children to printed 
materials. The method began the teaching of reading with thought 
or meaning wholes and was analytic, visual, and ’global 1 or Gestalt 
in character. It represented a third stage in the evolution of 
analytic methods from word to phrase, to sentence. 

According to Huey, in 1908 this method urged that the sentence 
and not the word, or letter, ?/as the true unit in language. If the 
sentence, expressing whole thoughts, which are the units in thinking, 
was the natural unit in language, it was the natural unit in reading 
as well. The sentence, so Huey argued, was not merely a sequence 
of word-sounds and word-names, any more than the word is the sum of 
letter-sounds and letter-names. The sentence had a distinctive total 
sound and appearance and meaning which was indicated plainly in the 
way it was spoken when its meaning was felt. It was read and spoken 
naturally only when this total meaning was prominent in the con¬ 
sciousness of the reader or the speaker. Hence the attention to 
letters, elementary sounds, words, and word meanings - cultivated 
by the alphabetic, phonic and word methods - should be replaced by 
attention to sentence wholes and sentence meanings. (Huey, 1912, 
p. 273). 

Burchill (1919) maintained that the only criteria acceptable 
in that day for the soundness of any method of teaching reading to 
a beginner were the following;

(1) Does the method train the pupil from the start in power 
to grasp not a word but a related set of words, a sentence, or an 
entire situation? 

(2) Does it advance from a unit of thought (a sentence) to 
the words as words without loss of the relationship among words? 

(3) Is a flow of association maintained among the words as 
parts of the original whole from which they have been disentangled 
or as parts of a different whole created anew out of the same words 
set in different relations? (?Jheat, 1920, p. 173) • 

Burchill claimed that it was this "relation" idea that made for 
true reading as opposed to mere word calling with little or no 
consciousness of a higher unity* The teaching must establish this 
sentence habit first and proceed then (and not till then) to treat 
a word as a whole, analyze out of it the constituent parts, and 
synthesize these parts into the original words or new words. 

Wheat (1923) drew attention to the fact that a child could 
become proficient in the recognition of words and yet not develop 
into a good reader because he might read a word at a time, neglect¬ 
ing to put the words into meaningful phrases and sentences. This, 
in part, was a justification for the use of a sentence method. He 
claimed that °the development of modem methods in recent years 
has arisen as a result of dissatisfaction with inadequate results 
of the ABC method and has paralleled the development of a new con¬ 
ception of the reading process which has established a basis for 
modifications of the strictly word method. 0 (¥Jheat, 1923, pp. 172- 
177). One of these modifications related its.elf to the demand for

ability to read in units larger than the word. This established 
a basis for the sentence method. 

Anderson and Dearborn (1952),in an appraisal of the problems 
connected with the sentence method,pointed out that the purpose 
of the first sentence methods was to prevent word-by-word reading 
and. they suggested that the use of easier reading material might 
have provided just as good a remedy. Nevertheless they considered 
the idea behind the sentence method a good one and emphasized its 
essential agreement with the principles of Gestalt psychology. 

It was, in their opinion, not a complete method of teaching reading. 
Sooner or later the child would have to learn the individual words 
of the sentence or acquire a basic vocabulary. Here the sentence 
method broke down just as the phrase method did. The child had 
difficulty in analysis of the sentence to distinguish word units 
and resorted to memory reading. 

polcb (1931) insisted that the sentence method actually set 
conditions for learning the wrong word associations and explained 
how this had been done. The basic problem, as Anderson and Dear¬ 
born (1952) stated it, was the failure to tie down eye movements 
and to develop a rhythmical left-to-right progression with this 
method. The recognition of these problems of eye movements and 
word recognition, which arose with the use of the sentence method, 
did not form an indictment of the method but indicated mainly sins 
of omission. If the sentence approach was supplemented by attention 
to word recognition it could be used very effectively.

Gray (1956) followed a similar vein in his comments on the 
method. He mentioned the advantage attached to its agreement with 
the global or "Gestalt" concept of learning and the stress it 
put on getting the meaning of what is read, thus cultivating an 
intelligent reading attitude and keen interest in reading. He 
also pointed out the value Schonell (1946, p. 50) put on the help 
it offered to the pupil from the context and from the continuity 
of meaning that could be embodied in the material. The first of 
his two main criticisms he found to be the inappropriatness of the 
sentences used in early basic reading texts, in that they were not 
related to the immediate interests and experiences of the pupils 
and thus failed to arouse meaning associations. The second crit¬ 
icism was the lack of development of basic skills in Ytrord recog¬ 
nition 'which suffered neglect because of the great attention paid 
to the meaning of what was read in actual practice. Gray (1956) 
also conceded that, if Y*ell applied, the sentence method laid the 
foundations for practically all the attitudes and skills required 
for good reading - "a thoughtful reading attitude, a clear grasp of 
meaning, accuracy and independence in word recognition, intelligent 
reaction to what was read, application of the ideas acquired, and 
interest in learning." (Gray, 1956, p. 86). Because the reader, 
as he advanced beyond the initial stages, was not faced with the 
difficulties of adjusting himself to a new set of reading attitudes, 
uninterrupted growth was ensured and economy and efficiency in teach¬ 
ing result.

Stone (1936, p. 177) suggested that a combination of the 
word, the phrase and sentence methods and phonics was very prob¬ 
ably the plan most commonly used for a decade preceding the in¬ 
troduction of the stoiy method about 1910. He pointed out how 
the importance attached to phonetic analysis and the repetition 
of words for the purpose of word mastery had led to the neglect 
of a thought-getting attitude of child development through inter¬ 
esting joyful experiences in reading, and of the introduction of 
the beginner to reading with literary merit. The "inanity and 
dis joirrtedness n of the reading context of such primers was their 
most striking feature. He deplored the artificial word repetition 
and the lack of sequence of thought and good composition. The 
selections in these readers were such as to make reading a matter 
of word pronunciation mainly. He supplied samples of material 
which gave the impression that repetition of words has been upper¬ 
most in the author’s mind. The sentence and story methods he 
judged to be innovations to remedy these weaknesses in reading 
instruction. 

Hie main strengths of the sentence method in summary are: 

(1) Its unit of instruction, the sentence, is a natural one 
to use as it is also the unit of expression in language. 

(2) Its basic principles are in agreement with the global 
or Gestalt concept of learning. 

(3) Its emphasis on thought getting from the beginning cult¬ 
ivates an intelligent reading attitude and develops keen interest 

in reading. This emphasis on meaning tends to prevent the development

of the "word-by-word” reading which resulted when smaller units 
and word elements were used as instructional units. The relation¬ 
ship among the words is emphasized right from the beginning and 
attention is centred on the ideas expressed. 

(4) Its use of context clues as a means to word recognition 
right from the beginning of reading instruction helps to lay the 
foundation, from the start, for developing the kinds of skills used 
in good reading in adult life. After the initial period of in¬ 
struction there is no need for adjustment to developing different 
habits end skills to meet the needs of adult reading. The process 
of reading uses the same skills in the initial period of instruction 
by the sentence method as are employed in adult reading. During 
the initial period of reading instruction, context clues operate 

as a means to word recognition in the same way they do in adult 
reading. 

(5) Its content in the reading material has unity and signif¬ 
icance to the child. This is especially so when the child himself 
composes the sentences about pictures and objects familiar to him. 
The stories used have continuity and arouse an interest in reading. 

Four major weaknesses have been found in the sentence method: 

(1) The most serious weakness is the lack of development of 
basic skills in word recognition. As Huey says, the method goes 
famously at first but it breaks down when the child attempts to 
read new matter for himself. (Euey, 1912, p. 274)* 

(2) The method fails to tie down eye-movements and to develop 
rhythmical left-right progression in reading. Methods of word

recognition and eye-movements can become haphazard and habits 
detrimental to accuracte rapid fluent reading can result. 

(3) The sentence method may set conditions for learning 
wrong word associations. The child matches spoken word to the 
printed symbols and if he does not remember the exact wording of 
the sentence he may be associating the wrong words with the 
printed forms. 

The main contribution of the method was the attention it 
directed to the content of beginning reading materials through 
its emphasis on the sentences or ideas as units of beginning 
instruction. It began with thought or meaning wholes and looked 
upon reading as a thought-getting process rather than a matter 
of mere word recognition. This emphasis on ideas added signif¬ 
icance and interest to the process of reading right from the 
beginning stage of learning to read. Materials acquired literary 
merit and reading became a joyful experience, not a mere exercise. 

In summary it is noted that the sentence method is an effect¬ 
ive approach to the teaching of reading but, because it does not 
develop independent methods of word attack, it is usually combined 
with other methods. Phonics is considered a necessary supplement % 
to the sentence method of beginning reading instruction.

THE PHRASE METHODS 

The phrase method was mentioned less often than the sent¬ 
ence and word methods in discussions of the thought methods of 
teaching reading. Suzzalo (1914* P* 119), Gray (1956, p. 84) 
and Anderson and Dearborn ( 1952 , pp. 237-240) are among few 
specialists who gave it a place as a separate method of teaching. 

It has been, usually, merely a supplement to the sentence method 
when identification of parts of sentences and words was desired 
before proceeding to phonetic analysis. It was a necessary supp¬ 
lement to the word method inasmuch as the meaning of certain parts 
of speech (prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) was not easily 
derived except in context (Suzzalo, 1918, p. 119) • 

In this method, as described by Gray (1956, p. 84), a 
phrase was often written on the blackboard as it came up in class 
or it may have been selected or written on the blackboard as a new 
unit to be learned. In either case, it was looked at carefully by 
the pupils, repeated several times, and compared with previously 
learned phrases. By repetition, the pupils gradually learned to 
distinguish the new phrases from others. Familiar words within the 
phrase were then noted and new ones learned. The elements of 
selected words were then studied, as in the word method, and applied 
in the recognition of new words. Anderson and Dearborn (1952, pp. 
237, 238) noted that the individual words were expected to emerge 
by a process of analysis, just as were the letters and sounds when 
the word method was used. This is the “natural" or "intrinsic” 
method applied to the analysis of word units from larger wholes.

Anderson and Dearborn (1952> pp. 237, 238), in their appraisal 
of the phrase method, classified it as an extension of the word 
method which might be termed the "look-and-say-a-phrase* 1 method. 

They considered the method impractical to begin with because it 
asked too much in expecting the average beginner to learn to read 
by phrases. Reading strictly by phrases was the exception rather 
than the rule, even with mature readers. In addition to this diff¬ 
iculty, the phrase method, in the opinion of these writers, was 
an uneconomical way to teach beginning reading, because it might 
involve failure to discover the individual words of the phrase unit. 
When the words were taken out of their original context or presented 
in different settings, the children were often unable to recognize 
them. The place for phrase work, according to Anderson and Dear¬ 
born, was after the children were well on the road to reading. 

Phrase work might then do much to promote fluency and efficient eye- 
movements. The phrase method definitely had a place, along with 
other methods, in a complete program of reading instruction; but, 
as a method of beginning reading, it proved both impractical and 
uneconomical. This conclusion Anderson and Dearborn supported with 
evidence from studies by Thorndike and Buswell (1937, p. 158) re¬ 
garding the relationship between phrase grouping and eye-movements. 

Gray (1956, pp. 84, 85) referred to these findings of Anderson 
and Dearborn (1952, p. 238) which questioned the validity of the 
assumption upon which the phrase method was based. This assumption, 
according to Gray, was that phrases were more interesting than 
words, and placed added emphasis on meaning. They were, also,

the recognition units at each fixation of the eyes of mature or 
good readers. Through an analysis of photographic records of eye- 
movements, Anderson and Dearborn found that good readers did not 
fix their eyes on phrases but that fixations occurred at more or 
less regular intervals along the lines. The recognition of thought 
units — that is of groups of words that form phrases — was a 
mental not a visual process. Gray (195&, pp. 34, 35), in summary, 
credited the phrase method with possessing all the advantages and 
limitations of the word method. Whereas it had the advantage of 
placing added emphasis on meaning, it was an uneconomical method 
of word mastery and, for this reason, has fallen into disuse.

THE STORY METHODS 

Gray’s (1948) (1956) descriptions of the story method included 
these steps: 

(1) The telling of the story by the teacher in a modified version 
in order to arouse interest. (In some cases the children followed 
along in their books as they listened). 

(2) The discussing of details in the order in which they were 
related until they are fairly well known to the pupils. 

(3) The re-telling and dramatizing of the story to provide 
repetition and to develop understanding and appreciation. 

(4) The directing of attention to the story as written on the 
blackboard or as printed in a book. 

(5) The identifying of individual sentences. As the pupils 
already know the sequence of events they soon learn to identify the 
sentences end pick them out repeatedly until they are readily recog¬ 
nized. 

(6) The identifying of phrases and then individual words, using 
techniques similar to those of the sentence, phrase and word methods. 
Important groups of words are first identified within sentences and 
then individual words within phrases. Elements of selected words 
are studied and the knowledge of these elements is applied in the 
recognition of new words. 

Smith (1934) described the essential steps of the story method 
as advocated in the Reading Literature Series (1916): 

The essential steps of method advocated in these series 

were: first, the teacher would tell a story or rhyme to the

children until they had memorized it or had become very fam¬ 
iliar with it; the selection was then read and analyzed into 
separate words and phrases; and eventually phonetics were 
applied in sounding the words. The emphasis upon phonetics, 
however, was not marked. (Smith, 1934, P* 141)• 

The point of view on phonics was clearly set forth as follows: 

It is not the purpose here to set forth a "scientific 
system* 1 of phonetics. It is not believed desirable that 
children in these early grades have even "a complete system” 
of phonics. It is the aim to give, in this manual, only such 
work as experience has shown necessary to train children into 
independent power over words in their reading vocabulary. 

There have been complete and scientific systems used for drill 
in the past. There are such systems yet in use in some sections 
of the country. But these systems have proved generally un¬ 
satisfactory. Their failure may be clearly traced to the fact 
that they are too complex and elaborate. (Free and Treadwell, 

1916, p. 6). 

Stone (1950, pp. 181-190) considered it natural that these new 
primers using the story method should use classical literature in 
the form of nursery rhymes and folk-tales. These "literary” primers 
were dominant for a decade or more, beginning about 1910. From the 
standpoint of vocabulary burden and word repetition these primers 
differed radically from those of the previous period. In essential 
elements of composition, in literary merit, and in interest appeal, 
these new literary materials were vastly better. The repeating of 
words and phrases in the cumulative tales was a natural type of 
repetition in contrast to the artificial repetition contained in 
primers based upon the alphabet, phonetic end word methods. 

Stone (1950, pp. 182-186) described the procedure in using the 
literary type materials to be exactly the reverse of the order foll¬ 
owed in the word method. Instead of proceeding from word to phrase

and sentence and then to the story, as in the word method, the 
literary material, such as the nursery rhyme or story, started 
from the whole selection back to lines or sentences, then to 
phrases and then to individual words. He described three approaches 
to this method: 

(1) The nursery-rhyme method. 

(2) The slow-approach story method. 

(3) The story-memory method. 

The nurs e ry-rhyme method involved the memorization of the 
nursery rhyme, the reading of it from a chart or blackboard as 
memory reading, the matching of cardboard strips of one line each 
to the corresponding lines of the rhyme, then the matching of 
phrases and words, and finally memory reading of the rhyme in the 
primer. Then a story utilizing the characters and vocabulary of 
the rhyme would follow in the primer. The Aldine Readers exemplify 
this method. 

The slow-approach story method (Stone, 1950, pp. 183, 184) was 
used in connection with the folk-tale primer. A representative 
procedure was as follows: 

ONE ORDER OF DEVELOPMENT IN THE STORY APPROACH 

1. Oral Work: Development of Content. 

(a) Telling the story by the teacher. 

(b) Conversation on the subject matter of the story. 

(c) Oral reproduction of the story by a pupil. 

2. Blackboard Work: Establishing of Relations. 

(a) Presentation and formal reading of the first sentence 
as a whole. 

(b) Recognition of wrords by position in the sentence. 

(c) Recognition of words by comparison. 

(d) Independent recognition of words. 

(e) Drill in rearrangements of words. 

BookWork: Reading of the story as a Whole. (Stone, 1950, 

pp. 185, 186).

This method was described in detail in the manuals of such 
cumulative-tale primers as Reading Literatu r e Primer and Progressive 
Road to Reading . 

In the second phase of instruction practices were quite as 
mechanical as those used in the word and sentence methods. By the 
time the child reached the third phase after having heard the story, 
told it, and then had it fed to him in drill doses, a sentence at 
a time, over a period of several weeks, his interest was likely to 
be at a very low ebb. 

The ,story-memory method (Stone, 1950, pp. 185, 186) was another 
approach to the reading of a folk-tale in a primer. It substituted, 
for the preparatory-drill part of the rhyme procedure, chart reading 
and memorization of the story in the exact words of the primer version. 
This memory reading method was developed to solve the difficulties 
involved in the reading of the difficult beginning units in the types 
of literary primers dominant during that period. It was devised to 
develop the attitude of "reading for meaning" and to provide consider¬ 
able joy in accomplishment in beginning reading for both teacher and 
child, in that it facilitated continuous page-by-page reading during 
the child*s earliest experiences in book reading. The objectives 
were worthy but were not achieved in practice. 

The result, as described by Stone, was that "children acquired 
an overdependence on content clues, became phenomenal guessers, and 
failed to learn words." In Stone*s judgment, the stoiy-memorization 
method and current practices derived from it, contributed in no 
small measure to the large number of non-readers and re-feuded readers 
with unfortunate attitudes and habits.

In addition, supplementary practices, brought in to bolster 
up word and phrase recognition, soon became monotonous and des¬ 
troyed the interest and pleasure in reading the method was orig¬ 
inally designed to create. These drill practice® involved the 
matching of line, phrase and word units on card strips to correspond¬ 
ing units in the complete blackboard copy, or chart and flash card 
games to encourage matching visual symbol to visual symbol, or oral 
symbol with visual symbol. They were used in varying amounts by 
different teachers, but always emphasized mechanics rather than 
comprehension. 

Many primers of current interest in Stone*s period carried 
over techniques from the memory method into the early 1930* s. 

Even though the material in those newer primers was different, in 
that it was based upon experiences common to young children, the 
memory method continued to be used in the early part of the primer, 
through the use of wall-chart reproductions of the stories and the 
encouragement of memorization of these by the children through 
practices with them before the reading of the stoxy in the book. 

The following books verify the use of the memory technique 
through charts in beginning readings

Examples of literary primers which used the story and sentence 
methods are found in the following series: 

"Stepping Stones to Literature*' (Arnold and Gilbert, 1897) 
"Graded Literature Series" (Judson and Bender, 1899) 

"Aldine Headers” (Spaulding and Bryce, 1907) 

"Reading Literature Series” (Free and Treadwell, 1910) 

"Story Hour Reader" (Coe and Christie, 1913) 

"Elson-Runkel Primer" (Elson and Runkel, 1914) 

"The Progressive Road to Reading" (Burchill, et al) 

"The Merrill Readers" (Dyer and Brady) 

"The Horace Mann Readers" (Eervey and Hix) 

"Everyday Classics" (Baker and Thorndikes) 

Descriptions of and excerpts from the first six of these 
illustrate interpretations of the sentence and story methods in 
the literary primers. 

Stepping Stones to Literature Series (1897) 

The authors claimed two special features for their readers: 

(1) They aimed to include nothing but good literature. 

(2) The books were better adapted to the modem graded school 
because eight readers were provided, whereas other series up to 
this time had included only five or six books. 

The literary selections in the first reader consist of the 
nursery rhyme of Jack and Jill, Baa, baa black sheep, Mary had a 
little lamb. Little Boy Blue, and Rock-a-bye baby. Much of the 
content was sets of related sentences. Page 7 reads like this:

Graded Literature Readers (1S99) 

These readers were distinctive in that they were the first 
to introduce cumulative tales and rhymes into primary readers. It 
was in these readers that the Little Red Hen first appeared in the 
pages of readers for beginners. The story proved to be so admir¬ 
ably adapted to the capacities of little children and to the repet- 
itional needs of a beginning vocabulary that it readily found its 
way into several other primers of the period. In the First Book of 
Graded Literature Readers this was the way the text of the story 
was handled on the upper half of page 114 : 

As Little Red Hen scratched the 
ground, she found a grain of wheat. 

"Who will plant this?” she asked. 

"I will not do it,” said the cat. 

"Nor I," said the dog and the pig. 

"Then I will," said Little Red Hen. 

So she buried the wheat in the 
ground. It grew up yellow and ripe. 

The Aldine Readers (Smith, 1934? PP* 147, 143) 

These books (copyright 1907) enjoyed wide popularity for many 
years. The distinctive feature of the primer and first reader is 
that the content is based on a series of rhymes, which the children 
learned by heart and later used as a self-help reference in looking 
up any word they might have forgotten. For example, after learning

the Little Boy Blue rhyme they read several pages like this: 

Little Boy Blue, little Boy Blue 
Come to me. 

Bring your horn. 

See, the sheep are in the meadow. 

The cows are in the corn. 

Blow your horn. Boy Blue. (Spaulding and Bryce, 1906, 

p. 74). 

If the child failed to recognize any word he referred to the 
rhyme printed on a previous page. 


Reading-Lite r ature Series 

In one of the earliest sets of story readers - Reading Liter ¬ 
ature. Free and Treadwell (copyright 1910) - the primer contained 
nine old tales which were plot stories, not just a. series of almost 
unrelated sentences, as most previous readers had been. The ending 
of the story of the Gingerbread Boy bears witness to this: 

You can run away from the cat. 

You can run away from the hen. 

But you can not run away from the fox. 

I shall eat you. 

And he did. 


Elson-Runkel Primer 

The Introduction to the Teacher 1 s Manual for another of the 
early story readers - The Elson-Runkel Primer , (copyright 1914) - 
sets forth the advantages of the "story method": 

The Elson-Runkel Primer and the El son Primary School 
Readers, Books 1 and II, are the outgrowth of a deep conviction 
that the new approach to the reading problem pointed out above, 
is pedagogically sound. The keynote of this approach is well 
stated by Dr. Huey: "The child loves a story, loves to get 
somewhither in what is said, wants an outcome to the discussion." 
This fundamental truth has been a guiding principle to the 
authors in the preparation of the Elson-Runkel Primer, which 
consists of a wide variety of interesting stories. 

The distinguishing feature of the Elson-Runkel method is 
that by it the child is made thoroughly familiar with the plot 
of each Primer story, before he attempts to read the text. To 
accomplish this end, the teacher tells the fuller stoiy (printed

in Part Five of the Manual), of which the text version is 
merely a simplified form.Such a point of departure poss¬ 

esses five distinct advantages: 

(1) It enables the child to follow intelligently the 
thread of the narrative, when he comes to the reading of the 
Primer text. Without some foreknowledge of the plot action, 
the beginner is so engrossed in the effort to interpret in¬ 
dividual words, that he is unable to see clearly the movement 
of the story. 

(2) It makes the child thoroughly familiar with the 

sound and meaning of the words he will later find in the text. 
With this feature in mind, the authors have carefully adapted 
the oral stories in such a way as to use over and over again 
the Primer vocabulary. 

(3) It enables the child to see the relationship of each 

printed word to the sentence-thought, instead of looking upon 
the word merely as an isolated symbol. 

(4) It develops the power of connected thinking, - the 
ability to grasp the relationship which each sentence bears to 
the story-incident. 

(5) It enriches and illuminates the Primer narrative 
for the child, by adding a setting and interesting details 
which cannot be given in the text because of vocabulary limit¬ 
ations. (Elson-Runkel, 1914> P* 25) . 


Story Hour Readers 

The general procedure commonly used in teaching reading with 
the use of the sentence or story methods is given clearly in outline 
form by the authors of the Story Hour Readers: 

Method of Teaching: 

(1) Telling the story 

(2) Dramatization 

(3) Blackboard work 

(4) Analysis 

(I) Thought groups 

(II) Sentence 

(III) Words in groups 
UV) Sight words 

(V) Phonetics 

(5) Reading from the book. (Smith, 1934> PP* 141> 142). 


The story methods were developed from the sentence and word 
methods. They ran concurrently with the elaborate phonic systems

and were emphasized mainly during the 1910* s. They offered an 
opportunity to introduce cumulative folk tales and nursery rhymes 
to readers for beginners* These literary primers were consistent 
with the cultural aims of education which had developed as an 
emphasis in the latter part of the nineteenth century. The first 
literary primers appeared about 1897 and they continued to be 
produced until the 1920* s, 

Basically the story method was a “memory method.” It con¬ 
sisted of memorizing a rhyme or story, analyzing the story into 
sentences, phrases and words, and applying phonetics for the sound¬ 
ing of words. It used the story or rhyme as the unit of instruction 
and, then, through analysis of it, discovered its elements. Thus 
the child discovered the word in a natural manner. The story 
method emphasized drill on whole phrases and sentences as well as 
words and recognized phonetic analysis as only a subsidiary factor. 
The emphasis from the first was on ideas not word recognition. The 
method is, basically, global, visual and analytic. 

Comments by educators on the values of the method point out 
its strengths and weaknesses. Stone (1950, pp. 186-190) set forth 
five serious objections to these story-memory approaches to early 
book reading: 

(1) It tended to result in memory reading which, in turn, 
meant that the child did not learn to recognize the words and dev¬ 
eloped poor eye-movements. He consequently became over dependent 
on content clues and guessing. 

(2) When a child approached a reading unit in the book after

having just read the identical material on a chart or blackboard, 
his motives for reading differed from those for which he would read 
a story completely new in sequence and plot. Undoubtedly there was 
less intrinsic interest in the story in the former instance. 

(3) The great advantage of the attractive colored illustrations 
was lost when the stoiy was introduced with chart material first, 

(4) The experiencing of the story by the children was scrappy 
when it was read and re-read in bits, first on charts and then in 
the book, over a period of several lessons. The reading of the 
stoiy from the very beginning should be based upon the method of 
the whole and should be a unified complete experience rather than 

a scrappy, piecemeal one. 

(5) The plan of preliminary chart reading of the identical 
material in the book and the accompanying tendency to rely upon 
memory of content and to become over-dependent upon content clues 
required an abundance of pure drill in word recognition as evidenced 
in the detailed procedures set forth in the manuals. 

Stone believed that the solution of the problem of obtaining 
experience of the whole, and of thought-getting and word-recognition, 
did not lie in plans that involved undue reliance upon memory of 
content supplemented by drill exercises in sentence, phrase and word 
recognition. 

"Rather the solution lies in the new intrinsic techniques 
for word learning in simple, purposeful reading activities, 
(illustrated in Ch. VI) and in abundant repetition of the same 
words in easy, interesting reading in pre-primers and primers." 
(Stone, 1950, pp. 181-190).

The stoiy-method order from story-whole back to sentences, phrases, 
and words was not an essential in achieving a well-balanced set of 
objectives in beginning reading. 

Anderson and Dearborn (1952, pp. 243-257), in their appraisal 
of the story method, classed it as an expansion of the sentence 
method in which the children practiced reciting the story until it 
was memorized and then, assisted by their memory of the story, 
tallied the words seen with the spoken word. They noted the follow¬ 
ing features and values of the methods 

(1) The purpose of the story method was to develop a thought¬ 
getting attitude before all else. Therefore the most meaningful 
unit - the story - was used. This stress in meaning served to 
discourage word-for-word reading, to capture the child*s interest 
and to permit an easy introduction to reading. 

(2) As a means of applying Gestalt theoiy the story method is 
better than the sentence method. 

(3) Nursery rhymes and familiar folk tales were used in order 
to develop a taste for good literature. 

(4) Memorization of the story was encouraged to facilitate 
ease in first reading and to secure a correct reading attitude, 
i.e., looking for large meanings in the selection. 

(5) "Memory reading" is not really reading. Eye movements 
indicate a search for clues to recall what has been memorized, not 
to interpret. Many children show they can "read" the rhyme with 
the book upside down or the eyes closed. 

(6) Nevertheless memory reading was a step before real reading

and served in the nature of reading readiness activity. In recit¬ 
ing stories from memory the children practiced the posture of 
reading, as well as many other functions which had value from the 
stand point of preparation for real reading. 

(7) In Buswell 1 s experiment it would seem that the sentence 
and story method encouraged a "subjective” type of reading, while 
the word and phonetic methods encouraged the "objective” type. 

The differences were supposed to be that the objective readers have 
a narrow recognition span, read accurately, and seldom "read into" 
the material, while subjective readers had a wider sweep of the 
material, saw less detail, brought a large factor of apperception 
to bear, and therefore read less acurately. 

(8) The miscalculations of both the sentence and story methods 
included a failure to learn the individual words of the larger units 
and the habit of memory reading. 

(9) The story method, like the sentence method, is not a complete 
method of teaching reading. Memory reading might best be regarded 

as just a stage of learning to read by the sentence and story method, 
just as word-by-word reading might represent a stage of learning to 
read by the word and phonetic methods. The real problem develops 
only when children are hung up in these stages. Ultimately, all 
the fundamental elements, including both word recognition and comp¬ 
rehension of content, must be carried to maturity. The selection 
of a method resolved itself into a question of which elements should 
be developed first, and what rate of development should be expected.

or the word and phonetic methods meant the carrying over of undev¬ 
eloped elements to a higher level in school, Anderson and Dearborn 
were in agreement with Buswell in his conclusion that reading is 
best taught by a combination of methods. 

Gray (1948) saw five advantages in the story method: 

(1) Because stories have a universal appeal for children, it 
was claimed that the story method ensured keen interest in reading 
activities, thus overcoming some of the disadvantages of the word 
and sentence methods. For this reason it inculcated a love of 
reading and a taste for good literature. The Mother Goose tales 
and rhymes end the fables and folk tales presented much more inter¬ 
esting content than the word lists and synthetic sentences of the 
"word" and ’'phonic” readers. (Gray, 1956, P- 86). 

(2) Because it carried the reader through an entire story 
sequence, it provided a more complete unit of thought than the sent¬ 
ence method. It not only emphasized meaning but trained pupils to 
anticipate and follow a sequence of ideas. It also provided greater 
opportunity for discussion and the understanding of relationships. 
(Gray, 1956, p. 86). 

(3) This "story method", which emphasized drill on whole 
phrases and sentences, as well as words, recognized phonetic anal¬ 
ysis as only a subsidiary factor in word perception and not only 
cut down quantitatively on the phonetic content of their word per¬ 
ception programs but also introduced simpler techniques for teaching 
phonics. These techniques closely integrated phonetic analysis with 
the whole reading process. (Gray, 1948, p. 24)*

(4) The story method, like the sentence method, lends itself 
from the beginning to emphasis on the basic aspects of efficient 
reading. 

(5) It is in keeping with the global or Gestalt concept of 
learning forms. 

The chief criticism was that pupils tended to rely largely 
on their memory of the sequence of events in a story rather than 
on the recognition of words and consequently their reading was often 
inaccurate and incomplete. The pupils would resort to guesswork 
and imagination and would depart from the text to supply whatever 
came to mind or seemed appropriate when attempting to read new stories. 
This could be avoided by means of well balanced emphasis on develop¬ 
ing word recognition skills and promoting thoughtful reading. 

(Gray, 1956, p. 87). Another criticism pointed out that, although 
the better-balanced and more eclectic ”story methods” resulted in 
more meaningful reading, unfortunately, they did not reduce the 
number of words children were to learn at early levels. (The 
Story-Bo we Primer listed 518 words and the Elson-Runkel Primer 303). 
(Gray, 1948, p. 26). 

The strengths of the story method were similar to those of 
the sentence method, with several additions. They are listed as 
follows: 

1. The universal appeal of the stories ensured keen interest. 

A love of reading and a taste for literature developed through their 
use. 

2. The story method provided a more complete thought unit than

did the sentence method. The story was the most meaningful unit 
that had been used and served that much better the purpose of 
developing a thought-getting attitude toward reading. 

3. The application of the Gestalt theory was more consist¬ 
ent than with the sentence method. 

4. The story method put phonetic analysis in its proper place 
as an integral part of the reading program but not as an approach 
to beginning reading. 

The weaknesses that arose from its use as the sole method of 
teaching are theses 

1. Children relied largely on memory of the sequence of 
events and resorted to guesswork in word recognition. Reading be¬ 
came inaccurate ana incomplete. Children often failed to learn the 
individual words. 

2. The method, as had previous ones, still introduced too 
many words for the children to learn. 

3. The haphazard methods employed in recognizing and figuring 
out the words resulted in the development of poor eye-movements. 

4. The method encouraged a "subjective” type of reading in 
which the children searched for clues to recall what had been memor¬ 
ized. This "memory-reading" is not true reading. The motives for 
it differ. In true reading the child reads to find out, to inter¬ 
pret printed symbols. In memory-reading the child merely matched 
remembered oral language to printed symbols. In many cases the 
child could "read" with the book upside down.

The special contribution the story method made to reading 
methodology was the interest it developed, and the joy it afforded, 
in reading. The story content was vastly more interesting than 
any of the contrived, didactic, repetitive, and often frankly n dull 
drillmaterial used in the word, phonic or alphabet primers. 
Reading with this method became a more inviting and natural process. 
The child discovered words himself through use of context clues. 

He also saw, from the beginning, how n talk TI was written down and 
saw the significance of the process from the start. 

In summary it must be recognized that this story method, too, 
is not a complete method. At best it is a stage in learning to 
read. Much of the reading done is "approximate* 1 reading - not 
real reading. The real problem develops when, through over-use of 
the method, the child is hung up at this stage. 


SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER 

None of these methods using units larger than the word in 
beginning instruction can be considered adequate as a single 
approach to beginning reading. Each has weaknesses that require 
that it be supplemented by another method. The weakness most 
apparent and most serious is the lack of attention to the develop¬ 
ment of methods of word-attack.

AS A TOOL

CHAPTER V 

METHODS EMPHASING THE FUNCTION OF READING 

AS A TOOL 

Early reading methods stressed the function of reading as 
word recognition. In beginning reading, training was concen¬ 
trated mainly on developing the ability to recognize and pron¬ 
ounce the words. Much emphasis was laid on oral reading. When 
the idea of reading as a thought-getting process became dominant 
in the teaching of reading, changes in methods of instruction 
were made. The learner was expected to interpret the content. 

Mere pronunciation of the words was not enough. The expected re¬ 
action usually involved a motor response to directions or questions 
or the use of the content in some other way. This concept of read¬ 
ing as a tool to derive meaning brought about a decided shift in 
emphasis from oral reading to silent reading methods. The silent 
reading methods, including an extreme non-oral form, are described 
in this chapter. 


SILENT READING METHODS 

From the beginning of reading instruction, oral reading 
had maintained its supreme and undisputed claim over class¬ 
room methods. In marked contrast to this traditional practice, 
we find a period of years, let us say approximately between 
1918 and 1925, marked with an exaggerated and, in some cases, 
almost exclusive emphasis upon silent reading procedures. 
(Smith, 1934, P* 153). 

That this new emphasis came into being immediately following 
the First World War was not mere coincidence. During the war the

use of tests to determine comprehension and speed had developed 
rapidly and been used widely to test the reading ability of large 
numbers of servicemen. The Army Alpha tests revealed that 11 over¬ 
whelming numbers of young Americans had inferior reading habits. 11 
(Adams, et al, 1949, p. 52). These findings bore out the results 
of research into eye movements carried on by Huey and other invest¬ 
igators prior to 1918. (Huey, 1912, p. 359). 

Smith (1934, pp. 153-159) considered that there were at least 
three important factors that had bearing on the emphasis suddenly 
given to silent reading in the schools. The first factor was the 
n ever-increasing attention directed toward meanings.” (Smith, 1934, 
p. 153). This cumulative movement to which Rousseau, Pestalozzi, 
Herbert and Froebel had each added to their influence was having 
a strong effect on education in all its phases. Francis W. Parker 
(1894, P- 93) applied this factor of searching for meaning to read¬ 
ing instruction. He put emphasis on motor expression, but, following 
Froebels* practice, he reduced its mechanical and imitative elements 
to connect thought with motor expression. Parker stressed the fact 
that "expression helps thought, and thought is necessary for ex¬ 
pression.” Applying these ideas to language expression, he distin¬ 
guished clearly between speech, silent reading, and oral reading. 
While admitting that speech and oral reading are forms of express¬ 
ion he contended that ordinary, or silent, reading was not a form 
of expression but a matter of attention. He held that confusion 
between the two processes of attention and expression was the source 
of many of the grossest errors in. the teaching of reading. Many of

the errors prevalent in his day he credited to the custom of 
making oral reading the principal and almost the only means of 
teaching reading. (Smith, 1934* p. 154) • 

Colonel Parker and others came more and more to urge this 
new emphasis upon meanings in reading. The following quotation 
from Dr. Huey 1 s 1908 publication is an example of this attitude: 

Reading as a school exercise has almost always been 
thought of as reading aloud, in spite of the obvious fact 
that reading in actual life is to be mainly silent reading. 

The consequent attention to reading as an exercise in speak¬ 
ing, and it has usually been a rather bad exercise at that, 
has been heavily at the expense of reading as the art of 
thought getting and thought manipulating. (Huey, 1908, p. 359). 

Such pronouncements as these by advanced thinkers paved the 
way for the second influence which was a strong factor in promot¬ 
ing silent reading. 

This second influence was a movement which made itself felt 
in a wave of scientific investigations in reading between the years 
of 1910 and 1920. (Smith, 1934* P* 155). These investigations were 
probably the strongest single factor in promoting silent reading. 

The movement was two-pronged, involving both the results of invest¬ 
igations and the results of testing. "An unprecedented interest 
in reading investigations" (Gray, 1925) led several curious educat¬ 
ors to probe further into the differences between oral and silent 
reading. "Between 1915 end 1918 Mead, Oberholtzer, Pintner and 
Gilliland, Schmidt, and Judd, all conducted investigations which 
revealed the superiority of silent reading over oral reading both 
in speed and comprehension." (Smith, 1934* P* 155)•

While the results of investigations were important in con¬ 
vincing school people of the desirability of emphasizing silent 
reading, the testing movement, according to Smith, was even more 
influential in bringing silent reading procedures into the class¬ 
room. ’’The Brown Silent Reading Test, the Kansas Silent Reading 
Test, Courtis’s Silent Reading Tests and Monroe’s Silent Reading 
Tests all had appeared by 1918.” (Smith, 1934* p. 157). In the 
years immediately following many additional tests were published. 

The wide use of these tests in classrooms was a powerful factor in 
stressing silent reading instruction. ”A common inference is that, 
as soon as school officials begin to test a certain phase of in¬ 
struction, teachers begin to emphasize that phase in their teaching. 
This was undoubtedly the case in regard to silent reading.” (Smith, 
1934, p. 157). 

The third influence back of this new emphasis can be traced 
to the reports in the Yearbooks of the National Society for the 
Study of Education between 1916 and 1920. (Smith, 1934, p. 157). 

In the Sixteenth Yearbook, William S. Gray made a report on ’’The 
Relation of Silent Reading to Economy in Education.” In the Eight¬ 
eenth Yearbook he made a report on "Principles of Method in Teaching 
Reading, as Derived from Scientific Investigations.” Again he 
emphasized the advantages of silent reading, as follows: 

First, rapid silent readers can be developed much earlier 
in the grades than is usually done at the present time. Second, 
silent reading exercises can be substituted to advantage for 
oral reading by the end of the third grade, since pupils have 
reached the point in their development where silent reading is 
a more economical and rapid process than oral reading. The 
results of practically every investigation of this problem

(comprehension) indicate clearly the appropriateness of 
emphasizing the content of what is read, persistently and 
consistently, throughout the grades. (Gray, 1919, p. 24)• 

The Twentieth Yearbook, Part II, was devoted entirely to 

the Society 1 s Committee on Silent Reading. The report dealt with 

such topics as ’’Controlling Factors in the Measurement of Silent 

Reading,” development of Speed in Silent Reading,” ’’Individual 

Differences in Silent Reading,” ’’Motivated Drill Work in Silent 

Reading.” 

A summary in this Yearbook by W. W. Thiessen expressed the 
point of view of educators regarding silent and oral reading. He 
said: 


For many years, oral reading has played a lone part in 
our schools, particularly in the primary grades. The growing 
dissatisfaction with reading progress and the evident superior 
merit of practice in silent reading is now resulting in a 
movement to introduce a larger proportion of the latter into 
all grades. To what extent silent reading can be profitably 
substituted for oral in the primary grades is a matter that 
should be determined by careful experimentation. In the 
light of the evidence we now possess, there is nothing that 
would justify the amount of oral reading commonly found. 

The tenacity with which primary teachers have clung to 
oral reading is probably due to two causes. They know of no 
¥iray to bring about improvement in oral reading except through 
oral reading, and they have not known how to conduct silent 
reading exercises. (Thiessen, 1921, pp. 7, S). 

These three factors, - the growing emphasis on meaning, the 
results of scientific investigations,supported by standardized test 
results,and the emphasis on silent reading in the Yearbooks of the 
National Society for the Study of Education - were influential in 
directing the attention of educators to new methods of teaching 
silent reading and to the development of techniques commonly assoc¬ 
iated with the ’’silent reading method.” Hester (1955, pp. 6, 7)

reported that the testing program disclosed many discrepancies. 
Although pupils were able to oronounce difficult words through the 
use of the elaborate phonics systems in vogue at the time, compre¬ 
hension of the material was poor and rate of reading was low. The 
results caused many more investigations to be made end they, in 
turn, directed criticism toward methods. Oral word-calling methods 
and unsuitable difficult literary materials were among the factors 
blamed, A strong reaction against oral reading and the use of 
phonics developed. Almost exclusive emphasis was put on silent 
reading, to the extent that Adams, Gray and Reese made the follow¬ 
ing comment on the results: 

With their conscientious tendency to go to the opposite 
extreme if a method is found to have flaws, educators began 
to emphasize silent reading. Oral reading was swept out of 
some school systems and, since tests were more easily devised 
to mes-sure retention of facts than to evaluate appreciation, 
school readers were designed to feature silent reading mater¬ 
ials of 'an informational nature. Literary materials and oral 
reading became so unpopular that many teachers felt guilty if 
they used either. (Adams et al, 1949, pp. 52, 53). 

Silent reading methods of teaching, though varied, had certain 
fundamental characteristics in common. The major concern of silent 
reading materials was the development of comprehension. The proc¬ 
edure generally recommended was that of asking children to make 
certain definite responses to their reading which would require a 
thorough understanding of the subject matter. The method frequently 
used in teaching silent reading to grade one children was that of 
presenting sentences which required action response and using these 
for communicating directions without ever repeating the sentences 
orally.

Three samples of methods set forth in the teacher’s manuals 
of the period are given here. These are taken from the historical 
account of reading instruction by Nila B. Smith. 

The first lesson recommended by Miss Watkin in using her 
silent reading method is as follows: 

The children are in their usual seats. Print on the 
blackboard COME TO CLASS. (This is the first steo in teach¬ 
ing a child to receive an idea - in this case* the idea of 
following directions)• 

Pointing to the words, talk informally to the pupils. 
Waste no words. Say something like this: f, What I have 
printed here (indicating) means that all of you are to rise 
whenever you see this and come to this place where the little 
chairs are. I call this place *the class*. n 

Before the children can comply with the request and COME 
TO CLASS, the teacher erases the request, saying nothing more. 
She then prints it again, still saying nothing, and looks at 
the class. Those pupils less timid than others will do as 
the words indicate. Tell the timid pupils just what it means. 

When all the pupils are seabed ”in class.* 1 turn to the 
board cand print GO TO YOUR SEATS. Tell the pupils that when 
that is printed it means: go and sit in your own seat. 

The children return to their original seats. The teacher 
erases all words from the board. Again print COME TO CLASS. 

Say nothing, but look at the children. They rise, come to the 
class, and seat themselves. Now erase the words and re-print 
GO TO YOUR SEATS, and if necessary explain again. Repeat Hie 
exercises of coming to the class and returning to the seats as 
many times as necessary. 

It is important that in the first lesson, as well as in 
the succeeding one®, the pupils shall obey promptly . You can 
insure this by insisting upon it. Never relax the rule. Do 
not give an oral command. (The writer has frequently conducted 
an entire recitation with not more than ten spoken words, and 
occasionally with none at all.) (Watkin, 1922, p. 31). 

A second procedure was suggested in the reading course of St. 

Cloud, Minnesota in 1924: 

The teacher prints short action sentences (one word at 
first) such as: 

run 

jump 

run and jump 

These cards are used as follows: The teacher shows a card on

which is printed "Run”. She introduces the card by saying 
that it tells them to do something. If any child in the class 
can read it, he is permitted to do so silently and perform the 
action. If no one can read it, the teacher whispers it to 
some child, who performs the action, thus showing the other 
children what it says. The teacher then uses "Run?* in combin¬ 
ation with different children*s names, as: 

Run, Jack. Run, Anna. Run, Mary. 

(Smith, 1934, p. 130). 

A third procedure is described as follows: 

A set of directions for drawing and construction work 
was another favorite technique used with beginners. It fre¬ 
quently took the form of seat work based on a story the child¬ 
ren were reading. For example, if the story is about a pig 
and a cow, the seat work might be this: 

1. Draw the pig. 2. Draw the pig. 

Draw the cow. Color the pig red. 

(Smith, 1934, P- ISO). 

The content of the readers came to consist largely of factual 
and informational selections which were very like the type of mater¬ 
ial frequently met in practical life reading. 

Buswell explained the need for this in his manual: 

Practically all the primary readers which are in common 
use at the present time (1923) are made up of fairy tales, 
folklore, myths, Mother Goose rhymes, and similar fanciful 
material. It has been assumed that such selections will stim¬ 
ulate the imagination of the child and also that they have 
literary value. There is no disposition on the part of the 
writer to deny that there is a certain element of truth in 
this assumption. On the other hand, it is becoming increas¬ 
ingly clear that to feed the child on an exclusive literary 
diet that is entirely divorced from the actual situations in 
the world in which he lives, will defeat one of the fundamental 
purposes of teaching reading. A certain amount of fanciful 
material may be legitimate. But at the present time the supply 
of ’’Little Red Hen” and "Gingerbread Boy" type of material, 
largely used in the schools, needs to be supplemented by a 
suitable proportion of factual material, in order that the 
child* s thinking may be more directly related to the actual 
experiences which he daily encounters. (Buswell, 1923, p. 10). 

This series of readers provides selections which, with 
a very few exceptions, principally poems, are true to actual 
or possible experiences in the world in which the child lives. 
Many of the selections are informational in character and will 
stimulate conversation and thinking about the facts presented.

Lewis and Rowland showed agreement with this explanation in 
their fourth reader manual: 

In selecting the material for these books the authors 
have purposely avoided the established paths of literary 
reputation, and have selected from a wide variety of sources 
interesting material representative of the printed matter 
the child will inevitably read. (Lewis et al, 1924, p. 4)• 

The purpose of the new materials was to provide easy, inter¬ 
esting text to facilitate the development of speed and comprehension 
in silent reading. In addition to the new factual material in tbs 
readers,there were usually exercises requiring the child to make 
some reaction which would check his comprehension of the selection. 
The bulk of subject matter was devoted to child life. From the 
literary standpoint, the content oould be described as being made 
up of sentences related in thought but often having so little plot 
that they could hardly be called narratives. The title usually 
implied the emphasis on silent reading. 

Some of the new readers, as listed by Smith (1934* p. 165) > 
were as follows: 

The Learn to Study Readers , by Ernest Horn and Grace Shields, 
(Ginn and Company) . 

The Silent Reading Hour , by Guy T. Buswell and William H. 
Wheeler, (Wheeler Publishing Company) . 

The Bovs 1 and Girls 1 Readers , by Emma M. Bolenius. (Houghton 
Mifflen Company). 

The Silent Readers , by Lewis and Ro?/land. 

The Progressive Road to Silent Reading , by Ettinger, Shimer, 
and others. 

Lippencott*s Silent Reading for Begin ners, by Watkins. 

These new readers were part of a vast quantity of publications 
and materials which accompanied the new emphasis in reading. Supp¬ 
lemental reading received a strong impetus as the new movement gained

in popularity. Several of the silent readers of the period were 
supplemental in that they were to be used at the same time as 
the basal system. Smith (1934? p. 167) mentioned three sets of 
the informational type and mentioned others of a patriotic 
character which appeared "as an aftermath 11 of the World War. 

These books usually embodied various types of silent reading 
exercises as well as the factual material. "A host of supplem¬ 
ental materials other than readers'* followed in the train of the 
movement. The use of silent reading materials was readily seized 
upon as a solution to the primary teachers' need for seat work. 
Publishers issued a generous supply of seat work materials, "in 
which the children were to read silently and follow directions 
for drawing or construction work, or were to answer true-false 
questions, complete sentences, mark opposites, classify words, 
dramatize, or make some other reading response." (Smith, 1934? 
p. 167). 

As a result of the scientific investigations regarding the 
nature of the reading process, perception cards to increase eye 
span, flash cards containing silent reading exercises, remedial 
materials and phonetic and word drill flash cards, to accompany 
the reading series, became popular. Teachers 1 manuals were another 
outgrowth of the emphasis on silent reading and came into general 
use during this period. Teachers, who were racking their brains 
to think of exercises which would provide a check on children's 
comprehension in reading, found the wealth of material provided 
in these teachers' helps a godsend. (Hester, 1955? p. 7)•

Publications on diagnostic and remedial reading appeared. 
Courses of study gave practical suggestions to teachers for apply- 
ing the new silent reading techniques. Professional books written 
at that time reveal the emphasis more clearly than anywhere else. 
Smith (1934) describes a number of these. J. A. O’Brien's 1921 
publication on Silen t Reading. With Special R ef e rence to Speed , 
was concerned entirely with a discussion of the various investig¬ 
ations which had to do with speed and gave suggestions for class¬ 
room procedure. C. E. Germane and E. G. Germane in their 1922 book 
on Silent Reading. A Handbook for Teachers , summed up investigations 
having a bearing on silent reading and,also,suggested classroom 
procedures. Emma Watkins' book on How to Teach Silent Reading to 
Beginners devoted itself almost entirely to a description of the 
action-response silent reading exercises which Miss Watkins had 
used in teaching primary pupils. Clarence R. Stone's Silent and 
Oral Reading , also published in 1922, while it recognized oral 
reading, placed emphasis on silent reading. Nila B. Smith's One 
Hundred Ways of Teaching Silent Reading contained a variety of 
suggestions for practical classroom procedures to use in developing 
different types of silent reading ability. In the accumulation of 
literature embodying the results of the scientific investigations 
three monographs were prominent: Reading: Its Nature and Develop ¬ 
ment , by Charles H. Judd and others, Fundamental Reading Habits: A 
Study of Their Development , by Guy T. Buswell, and Silent Reading : 

A Study of the Various Types , by Charles H. Judd and Guy T. Bu swell.

These reports presented objective evidence in photographic 
reproduction of eye movements, showing differences between the 
processes of silent and oral reading and effect on reading habits 
of changes in the content and purpose of reading. W. A. Smith*s 
The Readi ng Process summarized investigations, described tests, 
and discussed the history of reading and reading methods. All of 
these materials and publications had a profound effect upon teach¬ 
ing methods. 

The silent reading method was based on the theory that, since 
true reading was a silent process, and, since silent reading was 
of great social value, instruction should stress this type of reading. 
The growing knowledge of the psychological process of reading as a 
result of investigations by Gray (1917, 1925), Judd (1913) and 
Bu swell (1922) directed attention to the importance of a wide eye 
span, few fixations of the eye and rhythmic left-to-right eye- 
movements. Educators became aware of the reed for the development 
of fundamental habits in beginning reading instruction. Growing 
understanding of the eye-voice span (Buswell, 1920) and the differ¬ 
ences in eye-movements when reading silently and orally led to dis¬ 
trust of the oral reading method of instruction. 

Too great emphasis upon oral reading tended to habituate and 
perpetuate such vocalization practices as lip movements and inner 
speech or sub-vocal pronouncing of words (Tinker, 1952, p. 101) (Bond 
and Wagner, pp. 49-50). This was known to be a factor in producing 
slow laborious reading and in thus decreasing both speed and effic¬ 
iency.. Emphasis on oral reading, which tended to encourage these

habits of vocalization, tied reading rate to the speed of speech. 
The silent reading method attempted to circumvent this established 
practice of tying the visual symbol to the spoken language in the 
belief that word meaning associations with the oral symbol would 
be tapped in this way. The silent reading method aimed to estab- 
li^i direct associations of meaning with the printed symbol and to 
effect this through encouraging an immediate response, usually a 
motor one, to the symbols themselves. 

The Yearbooks of the National Society for the Study of Educ¬ 
ation delineated the changing positions held by oral and silent 
reading in beginning methods of instruction. The Twenty-fourth 
Yearbook (1925) pointed out that silent reading has the greater 
social value and is the manner in which most reading is carried out. 
The committee suggested that reasonable speed in silent reading 
could be cultivated and attached large importance to silent reading 
generally. The committee pointed out how excessive emphasis on 
oral reading and failure to provide incentives to reasonable speed 
in silent reading in the elementary grades could result in the 
permanent establishment of habits of slow reading. 

The Thirty-sixth Yearbook (Gray, 1937, p. 9) brought in a 
tempering influence. Gray reported that the social value of silent 
reading had become more and more widely stressed during the previous 
decade. He agreed that the Twenty-fourth Yearbook had rightly 
emphasized the importance of silent reading because of its greater 
social value, economy and efficiency. Nevertheless he pointed out 
that the great importance attached to silent reading in this public¬ 
ation had resulted, unfortunately, in several related practices that

could not be defended. Among them were the following: 

(1) the corresponding neglect of oral reading. 

(2) the adoption of methods of teaching beginning reading 
that resulted in memorizing the statements presented rather than 
in developing independence in recogizing words and meanings. 

(3) the preparation of elaborate and detailed comprehension 
exercises that have little or no relation to vital situations and 
needs. 

(4) the production of a large amount of poorly prepared 
and often inaccurate information reading material. (Gray, 1937, 

P. 9). 

He maintained that, in some schools, the methods of teaching 
silent reading had become as formal and limited in value as had 
formerly been true of oral reading. The routine level at which it 
had been taught, in many schools, he thought had failed to stir 
the interest and effort of the bright pupils. Gray listed the 
necessary types of activities in reading to show that both silent 
and oral reading met vital needs in the lives of both children 
and adults and pointed out that a well-conceived program should 
include both kinds of reading instruction. 

The Forty-eighth Yearbook (1949) stressed a desirable balance 
between oral and silent reading. Each was recognized as having a 
legitimate place in the reading program. The mutual association, 
and intimate relationship, between oral and silent reading provided 
for learning to think meanings into context. (Hildreth, 1949, p. 87) • 
Hildreth considered that swinging over to non-oral reading exclusively

represented a narrow approach and eliminated a meaningful language 
link to reading as well as omitting the social element of fun and 
pleasure in sharing stories. Silent reading was recommended as 
important from the beginning stages of instruction and techniques 
for its development were stressed. A separate chapter devoted to 
the pla.ce and value of oral reading and to methods of teaching it 
was included in this yearbook. The Yearbook advocated that an 
even balance between the types of reading should be maintained in 
the reading program. 

The practice of conducting silent reading before oral reading 
has become established in most reading programs today. This is 
stressed as a basic principle by Betts (194&) and is exemplified 
in the plans for basic reading lessons in the following chapters. 

The stress on silent reading had its temperate and its extreme 
forms. Some enthusiasts saw limitations in its application from 
the first. Others wanted quite drastic changes and sponsored innov¬ 
ations that excluded oral reading entirely. The attitudes of a few 
of these are set forth in the following paragraphs: 

Although this new emphasis upon utilitarian reading over¬ 
shadowed the development of literary appreciation, the use of 
silent reading for the enjoyment of literature was never lost sight 
of. The statement of Dr. Horn* s in the introduction of MissWatkin f s 
textbook is typical of the attitude of some educators in the matter: 

It must not be thought that Miss Watkins would limit the 
teaching of reading to this sort of exercise. It is not in¬ 
tended that these exercises take the place of instruction in 
literary appreciation. There is also a necessity of reading, 
silently, a great deal of easy material such as is found in 
our best primers and first readers. (Watkins, 1922, introduction).

Even in 1923 the few advocates who went so far as to urge 
that no oral reading he taught were in the minority. Although 
practically all the books emphasized silent reading, oral read¬ 
ing was recognized too and its use recommended, particularly in 
the primary grades. The general attitude is reflected in the 
Teachers* Manual accompanying the Silent Heading Hour ; 

The recent reaction against the exclusive teaching of 
oral reading has caused some individuals to take the position 
that oral reading should no longer be taught at all. Such an 
extreme view is entirely unwarranted* Both oral reading and 
silent reading have a value, but the two processes are not at 
all the same. It is not the thought of the writer that silent 
reading should supplant oral reading in the primary grades, 
but rather that it should in an increasing degree supplement 
oral reading. (Buswell, 1923, p. 3). 

Thiessen (1924) noted grov/ing dissatisfaction with reading 
progress,and the evident superior merit of practice in silent read¬ 
ing, as a result of the movement to introduce a larger proportion 
of the latter into the grades. He suggested that, in the light of 
the evidence already in their possession, there was nothing to 
justify the amount of oral reading commonly found. The tenacity 
with which primary teachers clung to oral reading,he thought,was 
due to their lack of knowledge of how to conduct silent reading 
exercises since they knew of no way to bring about improvement ex¬ 
cept through orsl reading. He admitted that it was becoming more 
and more evident that mechanical accuracy did not imply an under¬ 
standing of thought and that comprehension was less and rate lower 
when oral reading was stressed. let he cautioned that "experimental 
evidence sufficient to establish the greater effectiveness of train¬ 
ing in silent reading was not yet available."

Parker (1921), who described a method not entirely a silent 
reading one, admitted in his conclusions of scientific investiga¬ 
tions that "overemphasis on oral reading might interfere with 
silent." In his consideration of the results of these invest¬ 
igations, the first point he makes dealt with "the difference 
between oral and silent reading and the consequent need of specific 
training in silent reading." 

Wheat (1923) in his book on The Teac h ing of Reading pointed 
out the importance of silent reading in meeting social needs. In 
his answer to the question of the important aim of reading in¬ 
struction he submitted the following: 

The problem was examined for solution from the social 
point of view, and a solution was built up on the basis of 
the present-day needs of societjr. It was pointed out that 
the social needs of £1 former time required that reading in¬ 
struction should emphasize expressive oral reading , and, 
further, that the social needs of the present, being different 
from those of a former day, demand a different type of in¬ 
struction from that which formerly prevailed. Thus we reached 
our solution, namely, that the aim of reading instruction which 
should n gw prevail is to develop ability in effective rapid 
silent reading . 

The theme of this book is thus established. Skillful 
silent reading for meaning being: the art to be developed 
through reading instruction, succeeding chapters will describe 
its nature and trace its development through the grades. 

(Wheat, 1923, p. 16). 

Tinker (1952) pointed out that the main argument against 
oral instruction in beginning reading was properly aimed at certain 
injudicious practices such as the following: 

(1) Emphasis which encourage oral reading and vocalization 
on any and all occasions. 

(2) Forcing a child to read aloud in a group situation when 
inadequately prepared, in which case the frustration due to 
lack of success and the embarrassment due to the self- 
consciousness of an awkward performance often reduced the 
child*s interest in learning to read.

(3) An emphasis upon mechanical perfection in word calling 
and phrasing to a sacrifice of adequate comprehension and 
thought getting by the reader. This tends not only to prod¬ 
uce "word callers” weak in comprehension but also to prevent 
development of a satisfactory rate in silent reading. 

(Tinker, 1952, p. 102). 

Therefore, Tinker was not too concerned about the ill-effects 
of the judicious use of oral reading in beginning instruction. 

Although he admitted that instruction in beginning reading 
may be primarily oral, entirely non-oral, or a combination of the 
two, he contended that either of the extremes as the sole teaching 
method had its limitations. Too great an emphasis upon oral read¬ 
ing tended to ha.bitus.te and perpetuate such vocalization practices 
as lip movements, and inner speech or sub-vocal pronouncing of 
words. He summarized his viewpoint as follows: 

As far as the findings to date indicate, there is no 
reason to abandon a judicious combination of oral and silent 
reading instruction in favor of a completely non-oral approach. 

In fact evidence presented by Dearborn, Johnston and Carmichael 
(1949) suggests that certain assets which aid comprehension 
are lost when there is an overemphasis on silent reading. It 
appears that the natural tendency to stress important words 
in oral reading is associated ¥d.th better comprehension. (Tinker, 

1952, p. 101). 

Buswell was one of the main advocates for drastic changes. 

This excerpt emphasizes his position: 

Silent reading is more than noiseless reading. Silent 
reading is not mere non-vocal reading. It is the complex 
process of getting thought from the printed page and involves 
an entire new pedagogy. Silent reading objectives will never 
be attained by oral reading methods. (Buswell, Wheeler, 1923, 

p. 21). 

It is, therefore, not surprising to note that Buswell showed 
special interest in one of the outstanding extremes in the teaching 
of silent reading. This extreme method was McDade* s ”non-oral M ' 
method which will be described on the next few pages.

Several authorities put in a plea for the recognition of 
oral reading in beginning instruction. Hildreth (1953, pp. 204, 

205) argued that oral reading was not only a natural and satisfy¬ 
ing experience for beginners but that it prepared the children 
for recognizing the separate sounds in words. She considered 
that the omission of the link between spoken and printed words 
could result in serious loss for slow learners. Tinker (1952, 
pp. 102, 103) pointed out that oral language was not only a dom¬ 
inant form of reaction but the principal mode of communication 
for young children. He thought that to prohibit the natural 
impulse to any vocalization when learning to read might be exceed¬ 
ingly frustrating to them. In norms! progress in learning to read 
under proper guidance there was. a gradual transition toward less 
vocalization so that by the latter part of grade three there were 
little or no lip movements. In the Forty-eighth Yearbook Hildreth 
(1949, p. 37) also pointed out that the average beginner still 
vocalized and whispered even though he were taught largely by silent 
methods but that this tendency usually disappeared before the end 
of grade three. 

Stone (1950, pp. 94, 95) and Dolch (1955, pp. 119-123) pointed 
out the value of oral reading as an aid to develop good eye-movement 
habits when easy practice material was used. Adams, Gray and Reese 
(1949, p. 231), Dolch (1955, p. 132), Durrell (1940, pp. 50-53), 

McKee (1948, pp. 605-608) and others emphasized the value of oral 
reading as a checking instrument in instruction. Word recognition, 
phrasing and interpretation could all be checked through oral reading. 
The oral reading tests by Gray (1915, 1923) and DurraLl (1937) are 


evidence of this.

The silent reading method had several important points in 
its favor: 

1. It drew attention to the fact that true or proper read¬ 
ing is non-oral (Stone, 1930, p. 63) . In its highest and most 
efficient form reading is strictly silent. 

2. It pointed out the usefulness of silent reading in perform¬ 
ing the true function of reading as a tool to get meaning from the 
printed page. 

3. It introduced the practice of emphasing “silent reading 
before oral reading" so that the child read for meaning from the 
first. This introduced silent reading into beginning reading in¬ 
struction. 

4. It broadened the objectives for teaching reading. Through 
its eventual emphasis on the different purposes for oral and silent 
reading it pointed the way to the realization that reading serves 
many different purposes and the manner of reading is influenced by 
the purpose for which the reading is done. Attention was directed 
toward differentiation between skills needed in work-type and 
recreational reading and toward balance in the reading program. 

5. It developed techniques, other than oral ones, to use 
in diagnosing developing and evaluating reading skills. 

6. It emphasized the importance of the careful observation 
and development of the fundamental reading habits in beginning 
reading. 

7. It developed an acute awareness of the dangers in too 
great emphasis upon oral reading in initial instruction.

The silent reading method proved to have three important 
drawbacks: 

(1) It ignored the importance of the mutual association of 
reading and oral language in beginning instruction. A child 
naturally converts printed symbols into the oral language he 
knows and depends on the association between his oral language 
and the printed symbols to develop word meanings. 

( 2 ) It did not make provision for the development of word 
recognition skills. 

(3) It suffered from lack of the kind of check on word 
recognition that oral reading provides. 

The contributions of silent reading methods to reading meth¬ 
odology have been considerable. The main one is the emphasis it 
placed on reading as a functional process involving reactions other 
than oral reproduction of its content. The new techniques it in¬ 
troduced, the impetus it gave to the effective development of 
fundamental reading habits and the attention it directed to the 
purposes and functions of reading have permeated the methods of 
beginning instruction since the 1920*s. 

The silent reading methods have had a lasting influence on 
reading instruction. There are very few, if any, reading systems 
today that do not stress the development of efficient silent read¬ 
ing as a major goal. The techniques of the silent reading method 
are an integral part of every lesson in beginning reading instruction 
today.

THE NON-ORAL METHOD 

The non-oral method repudiated completely the use of any oral 
reading whatever in beginning reading. The principle underlying 
this method was that it was totally unnecessary in the teaching of 
reading to relate the visual symbols to the spoken word. Bond and 
Wagner (1950, p. 90) pointed out that those who advocated the method 
felt that the vocalization which resulted from this relationship of 
the visual symbol to the spoken word unduly hampered the learner. 
These advocates maintained further that it was just as easy for the 
child to understand the visual symbol as it was for him to learn 
the complicated auditory patterns needed to understand the spoken 
word symbols. The main contentions in support of the method were 
that inner speech was a very serious handicap to effective silent 
reading; that oral reading habits become firmly entrenched in initial 
instruction which used word sounding and oral reading; and that 
the habits of inner speech while reading, once developed, were, in 
the majority of cases, never overcome. 

McDade (1944, P* 15) stated his two cardinal rules for the 
method as follows: 

(1) There must always be an association of the printed word 
with its meaning. 

(2) There must never be an association of the printed word 
with the oral word. 

McDade recommended that communication between teacher and 
pupils be by print and reading. Ora! reading he considered a 
translation of one language into another.

The non-oral method involved motor instead of oral responses 
to visual symbols* It placed emphasis on the use of the picture 
dictionary and on word groups, rather than on isolated words. It 
utilized many games in which the child responded to print through 
action, rather than the oral reading usually expected. 

Betts f and Broome*s 1946 descriptions gave us the following 
eight steps in procedure: 

(1) Pupils were prepared for a reading lesson by ”oral work 
in advance.” For example, if the direction to be met on T, non-oral 
reading cards” was ’’Point to the clock,” the children practiced 
these directions orally before the reading lesson. 

(2) A ”situation method” was used to bring ”meaning into a 
child* s mind.” A number of objects were placed on a table and the 
child was given a card with the word book printed on it, prefenaKLy 
in manuscript writing. If he did not know which object to put the 
word on, he silently consulted a picture dictionary of samples. He 
compared the word on the card with the words of the dictionary until 
he put it over the right word and, in this way, got the meaning. 

The teacher never told the child what word was on the card. All 
the activities were carried out silently. Such devices as action 
cards helped to vary the procedure to maintain interest. 

(3l Sentences were introduced n as soon as a few verbs, nouns 
and objectives are known.” 

(4) Seat work of the individual, self-administering type, 
carried more than half the load. This type of activity was used 
from the first day.

(5) The teacher was urged to give room directions in print 
in order to make use of Additional opportunities for functional 
reading•” 

(6) Materials recommended included: 

(a) objects, persons, models and pictures. 

(b) n something to be read” - a word, phrase or pentence. 

(c) a ’’dictionary of samples” - picture dictionary type, 
labels on objects or a chart of words and objects. 

(Later this was arranged alphabetically in a teacher- 
or-pupil-made dictionary). 

(7) Always the printed word was shown in relationship to a 
situation and never in association with spoken words. If the child 
could not get a word he consulted the ”dictionary of samples” and 
got his clue through matching visual symbol to visual symbol. 

(B) This strictly silent reading continued throughout the 
first two years of school. 

Over ten years of increasing use in the first two grades of 
the Chicago public schools and the survey and report of Professor 
G. T. Buswell (1945) brought this method into the limelight. 

This approach, first advocated by McDade and later approved by 
Buswell, has been called ”the nonoral method” of developing beginning 
reeding, because, as Yoakam aptly said, it ”made a fetish of emphas¬ 
izing direct association between the visual forms of words and their 
meanings without the oral pronunciation of such words in the early

that such an approach would produce readers who would, therefore, 
be more rapid silent readers. 

Kottmeyer (1945, p. 183) classified this non-oral technique 
advocated by McDade as an extreme form of the "ideational” methods 
which emphasized a direct connection between printed symbol and 
the thought or idea expressed. The method was intended to correct 
the fault of "establishing a liaison between the printed word and 
the spoken word, which is not meaning in itself but a symbol, full 
of meaning only when functioning." (Kottmeyer,1945, p. 183) and 
McDade (1938, p. 306) maintained that, customarily, "we permit resid¬ 
ing to be parasite on oral speech." 

The non-oral method employed many devices. Use was made of 
directions, such as open the window , and go to the door . These 
directions were printed on cards and exposed to the children who 
were expected to react to the printed command by following the 
direction. In the initial presentation the teacher would hold up 
the card and then obey the directions herself. Then she would 
combine the card with the name of a child who then showed, that he 
had read it by carrying out the directions. Picture dictionaries, 
games and projects were used extensively to motivate the learning 
and to teach the meaning of words. These devices also provided 
materials through which the child could react to printed symbols 
through motor, rather than oral responses. 

The experiment in the non-oral teaching of reading was under 
the leadership of IcDade(l943), assistant superintendent of schools, 
and the study was under the direction of Buswell. It proposed to

determine "whether pupils taught by the non-oral reading method 
were able to read better, considering both rate and comprehension, 
than pupils taught by the usual method of combining oral with 
silent reading." The two main comparisons were: (a) scores of 
objective reading tests consisting of tests on rate and power of 
comprehension and (b) the absence of lip movement. The mean read¬ 
ing score of pupils taught by the usual method was 3.40 and of 
those taught by the non-oral was 3 * 60 . 

Bu swell (1945? pp. 16, 17), after calculating the mean diff¬ 
erence, the standard deviation of difference and critical ratio, 
came out with the conclusion that the difference in favor of the 
non-oral method (1.8) was highly significant, but Stone (1950, 
p. 51) considered the difference to be surprisingly small. The 
same applied to the difference in the use of lip-movement. In 
the usual oral-silent method, 21 per cent used lip-movement; in 
the non-oral group, 17 per cent used lip-movement. 

Stone (1950, p. 49), while admitting that the Chicago exper¬ 
iment demonstrated that children could learn to read under the non¬ 
oral method, considered the plan just another extreme. He found 
lacking the evidence to support the claims for the ideal results 
expected and considered Bu swell* s experiment inconclusive. Harris 
(1947, p. 74) pointed out that it had not been proven that children 
taught by the non-oral method actually experienced the meaning 
directly without any association with their previously acquired 
understanding and use of spoken language. He suggested that it 
seemed likely to him that most children, if told that they must not

say any words out loud while reading, would simply say the word 
to themselves silently. Even if inner speech or vocalization 
could be suppressed, Harris doubted the desirability of thus 
eliminating entirely the rich meanings which are already assoc¬ 
iated with spoken language and of trying to build up a completely 
new set of meanings for the printed word in which the child's prev¬ 
iously acquired language background was prevented from functioning. 
Harris suggested that, if you followed the non-oral assumptions 
through, they seemed to lead to the conclusion that "deaf-mutes 
should have an advantage over normal children in learning how to 
read." 

Tinker (1952, p. 14) reported on the results of the experiment 
in the following vein. He noted that in Buswell*s (1945) compar¬ 
ison of progress in reading, when beginning reading was taught 
either by oral or by the non-oral method, it was found that the 
reading of those taught by the non-oral method was as good as the 
reading of those taught by the oral method. At neither the third 
nor the sixth grade were there significant differences in reading 
performance. In the non-oral groups, however, there were signif¬ 
icantly fewer children with lip-movements and more who skipped a 
semester. Buswell advocated that oral reading be delayed until 
the basic habit of silent reading had been established. The evid¬ 
ence did not seem to Tinker to justify such a procedure. The view 
taken was that a balanced program of silent and oral reading should 
be employed, starting in grade I. Oral reading seemed well fitted 
to the young child's habits of responding. Advantage should be

taken of the fact that the child has had six years of development 
in oral language. Silent reading could be introduced along with 
oral to fit the particular reading activity engaged in by the child. 
There need be no conflict between oral and silent reading. Each 
had an important place in the development of a well balanced read¬ 
ing program. 

Yoakam (1955, p. 88) saw difficulties in attempting to teach 
reading by a method which made an abrupt break wi th the child* s 
previous experience with words through listening and speaking and 
which tried to develop a direct association between symbol and mean¬ 
ing without the aid of speech. Since inner speech was so difficult 
to identify, he found it questionable that the so-called non-oral 
approach would actually achieve the elimination of inner speech. 

The reduction of inner speech was probably a natural process which 
happened because the reader discovered, after a time, how much more 
rapid his progress could be when he reads silently. Ihile some people 
probably continued to use marked inner speech throughout their life 
times, the more able readers dropped the habit of slow inner speech 
sometime after the third grade. Yoakam considered that the use of 
silent reading exercises, properly balanced with oral reading exor¬ 
cises, would probably produce all the elimination of inner speech 
that was practicable. 

Stone (195Q, p. 55) commended the objective set forth by 
Ruswell, for he felt that, even in 1950, primary teachers, as a rule, 
"depended entirely too much upon oral reading" in the systematic 
group or class instruction in reading and too little upon materials

providing a direct association of meanings with symbols without 
the intervention of oral reading. Harris (1947, p. 74) found 
certain features of McDades* procedure, such as the interesting 
games, much pupil activity, and extensive use of seatwork, commend¬ 
able in themselves. 

Betts (194^, P« 330) found the method justified in the follow¬ 
ing three respects: 

(1) Relationship between visual symbols and the things they 
represent was emphasized. (Getting this point across was one of 
the first jobs in initial reading instruction). 

(2) Oral language control - and incidentally meaning - was 
developed before silent reading. 

(3) Silent reading before oral reading was emphasized even 
though the manner was quite different from that generally accepted. 

Kottmeyer (1945, p. 183) pointed out justification of the 
method on two counts: 

(1) Comprehension, it was claimed, was not impaired by the 
usual delay in the flow of meaning caused by the preliminary oral 
response in other methods. 

(2) Articulation, or inner speech, was said to be eliminated. 

Generally, though, the non-oral method has not been widely 

accepted by classroom teachers. Critics, generally, are not symp¬ 
athetic with what they call an "artificial separation of oral from 
written language." Because they do not exhibit grave concern about 
the alleged handicaps imposed upon silent reading by articulation

or inner speech, they see no special advantages in the use of a 
non-oral method exclusively. The non-oral exponents have left 
their impression though. They have emphasized the importance of 
establishing a direct connection between the printed symbol and 
the meaning expressed and the importance of attention to some 
silent reading in beginning instruction. The dangers of an over¬ 
emphasis on oral reading have been pointed out, as have the results 
of habituated vocalization and inner speech in slowing down the 
reading process. Many of the labelling techniques and interesting 
silent reading games used in beginning reading instruction today 
are a contribution from the non-oral reading method. 

Sond and Wagner (1950, p. 91) discussed the method as an 
interesting divergence from visual practices but did not consider 
that it had been used sufficiently to establish itself as an out¬ 
right method of instruction. That the method made so little use of 
the six years of language development,which have preceded the period 
of learning to read, seemed, to them, unfortunate. Nevertheless, 

Bond and Wagner considered that it had made a real contribution to 
methodology in reading. It had demonstrated many ways to get 
children to read silently for meaning and, through doing so, showed 
that oral reading methods were not the only means by which reading 
difficulties can be appraised and constant diagnosis maintained. 

Betts (1946, p. 380) challenged McDade*s proposal on three 
bases: his basic assumptions, the experimental evidence, and practice.' 
First, McDade's assumption that those who did not use a non-oral 
method would, perforce, use an "oral-before-silent 11 reading apprcsach

was not a fact. Silent reading before oral reading was a gener¬ 
ally accepted principle of reading instruction. Second, more 
experimental evidence was necessary regarding the immediate and 
long-term values achieved by the non-oral approach as well as 
evidence of the values of other approaches. Third, in practice, 
if the authors* hints are followed literally, this approach would 
deteriorate into a highly mechanical and uninteresting one. Fourth, 
the means of developing word recognition had not been made entirely 
clear. 

Horn (1949) also supplied a cautionary note regarding the 
conclusions to be drawn from the Chicago experiment: 

It is possible that the superiority attributed to the 
non-oral reading method in the Chicago experiment is due 
chiefly, or even solely, to greater stress on meaning and 
to a rich variety of silent-reading experiences, rather than 
to the attempted abolition of oral reading. Many of the 
activities which were utilized have been widely used else¬ 
where, and with favourable results, in teaching beginning 
reading. In fact the extreme attempt to avoid any oral 
reading may have operated detrimentally. There are numerous 
learning situations in which the prohibition of oral reading 
would be a hindering artificiality. (Horn and Curtis, 1949, 
pp. 257, 253). 

The non-oral method exhibits the same strengths and displays 
the same weaknesses as the silent reading method. The complete ex¬ 
clusion of aU oral reading make the application and the evaluation 
of it more difficult. The method exhibits these strengths* 

(1) It emphasizes a direct reaction to printed symbol. 

(2) It cuts down considerably on vocalization, but whether or 
not vocalization can be eliminated completely is questionable. 

(3) It directs attention to the weaknesses in certain practices 


in oral reading

The complete exclusion of all oral language exaggerated 
these weaknesses of the non-oral method: 

(1) It does not take advantage of the child* s six years of 
language development and the meanings with which the spoken words 
are associated. 

(2) It is in error in its basic assumptions that association 
of the printed symbols with oral language is unnecessary and harm¬ 
ful. If followed through to its logical conclusion it would appear 
that deaf-mutes have an advantage over normal children in learning 
to read. 

(3) Its use in the non-oral reading experiment presents evid¬ 
ence that is inconclusive. Factors other than those peculiar to 
the non-oral techniques could have contributed to the results 
obtained. More experimental evidence is required. 

(4) It becomes a highly mechanical and uninteresting method 
in practice. 

( 5 ) It does not make clear the means of developing word- 
recognition. 

The non-oral method has made a significant contribution to 
reading methodology. It has demonstrated many ways to get children 
to read silently for meaning. It has demonstrated, also, that oral 
reading methods are not the only means by which reading difficulties 
can be appraised and constant diagnosis maintained.

In conclusion, the fact that the method has not been used 
sufficiently to establish itself as a widely accepted method 
of instruction must be pointed out. The method is similar in 
many respects to one used with deaf mutes (Thompson, 1927) and, 
although it has contributions to make to instruction of normal 
children, it may have more value as a special or clinical method. 


SUMMAHI OF THE CHAPTER 

These two methods, the silent reading method and the non¬ 
oral reading method developed out of a new understanding of the 
processes involved in reading and the new social values attrib¬ 
uted to silent reading. The importance attached to the develop¬ 
ment of fundamental reading habits, to speed and comprehension 
in reading and to the function of reading as a tool in learning 
had an important influence on subsequent reading methodology. 
These methods convincingly demonstrated the values to be gained 
in emphasing silent reading in beginning instruction.

METHODS EMPHASIZING READING

CHAPTER VI 

METHODS EMPHASIZING READING 

AS EXPERIENCE 

As new developments in psychology fostered the concept of 
reading as experience (Gray, 1957, pp. 25-28) (Gates, 1949, pp. 

3, 4) new methods of instruction evolved. These methods emphas¬ 
ized the main purpose of reading through using it from the start 
as it would function in reading activities. These methods went 
one step beyond the silent reading methods, which emphasized the 
function of reading as a tool for getting meaning. They used 
reading as it entered into and flowed out of children* s interests 
and activities and became a part of their daily experiences. This 
chapter includes descriptions of the experience method, the natural 
incidental method and the Femald kinaesthic method. 


THE EXPERIENCE METHOD 

This approach has been called "the experience method" by Nila 
B. Smith (1934, P« 229) and Betts (194&, P* 3&4), the "experience- 
reading method" by Anderson and Dearborn (1952, p. 259), "the ex¬ 
perience-activity method" by Stone (1950, p. 40), the "learner- 
centred method" with "learned-teacher prepared" reading materials 
by Gray (1956, p. 40) and the "experience-chart approach" by Burton 
(1956, p. 218). The above approaches, whatever the particular 
names they travelled under, were essentially the same. Smith (1934,

p. 229) defined the method quite aptly as "a type of instruction 
in which reading was taught largely as it entered into or flowed 
out of childrens interests and activities.” 

Betts (1946, p. 384) briefly described this plan for teaching 
beginning reading as one in which initial reading activities were 
based on co-operatively developed experience charts with controlled 
vocabulary and sentence structure. He pointed out, as well, the 
function these activities served in appraising and developing in¬ 
formally reading readiness. The experience charts grew out of 
direct and vicarious experience, story-telling, dramatization, 
experiments, discussions and manual activities. The systematic 
development of these charts involved the following seven steps: 

1. The preparation of the children through experience and 
discussion. 

2 . The identification of a clear-cut motive for recording 
the experience. 

3. The agreement on the general type of record to be employed. 

4 . The preliminary drafting of the record by co-operative 
effort. 

5. The editing and final revision of the record. 

6 . The preparation of needed illustrations for the record. 

7. The construction of the record in permanent or semi¬ 
permanent form. (Betts, 194&, P* 405). 

Although many of the values of experience records had been 
realized through the actual development of the charts, teachers con¬ 
trived to create situations and problems which required reference to

the more permanent charts and which encouraged several rereadings 
of them for different purposes. This rereading helped to review 
vocabulary and reinforce fundamental reading habits, such as left- 
to-right eye-movement and quick recognition of word-forms. Child¬ 
ren located specific words, discussed them and noted their charact¬ 
eristics. In the earlier forms of this method,matching and isolation 
of words and cutting-up and rebuilding of the charts were practiced 
much in the same manner as advocated in the story methods. 

Adams, Gray and Reese (1949, p. 54) described the functioning 
of this method in an informal reading situation early in the school 
year. After a tour of the school building and grounds and discussion 
about it, the teacher helped the children to make up a story about 
their experience. She wrote down on the blackboard some of their 
remarks, revising them, if necessary, so that they carried the same 
meaning but required only one line of writing for each sentence. 

The children watched as the teacher made the marks with the white 
chalk mean what they had just said. In this way they understand 
that reading was just "talk wrote down 11 as Marion Monroe (1951, 
p. 223) described it. Then with the teacher' s help, they "read 
back” this written record of their experience. Later the children's 
story was reproduced by the teacher on a big chart and the children 
drew a picture to illustrate it. A collection of these "experience 
stories" became a book - their book in every sense of the term - 
and the children could reread and enjoy these stories they had com¬ 
posed and share them with others.

Betts (1946, pp. 338-427) described the variety of uses 
of experience records and illustrated the close relationship 
between these charts and the daily activities of the children. 

He described charts that were narrative records of projects 
carried out by the children; charts listing what they want to 
find out; charts recording plans; charts listing things to do 
and jobs accomplished; charts recording progress; charts describ¬ 
ing experiments; diary records; news records; reminder records; 
library rules; dictionary charts; and exhibit charts. He pointed 
out the values to be derived from the preliminary drafting, the 
editing and final revision, the participation by every pupil, the 
preparation of illustrations and the purposeful rereading required 
in order to use the chart. He showed how these charts grow out of 
and contribute to the interpretation of experience and satisfy 
individual, group or class needs while they provide, for the teacher, 
an instrument through which to relate reading to daily activities 
and to show children, from the beginning, the place end function of 
reading in life. The clcse relationship between speaking, writing 
and reading is significant in first reading activities and develops 
a concept of reading that clearly shows its purposes as well as its 
nature. The teacher needs to be able to control v> cabulary, sent¬ 
ence length and structure, and organization, in order to maintain 
the level of readability for the children.

Teachers who used these types of instruction did not use any 
one basal set of readers or any one systematized method. They 
varied their materials and methods to suit the interests and mat¬ 
urity of each group of children they taught. Much of the reading 
material the teacher and children prepared cooperatively in connec¬ 
tion with their experiences and activities. Many different basal 
and supplementary readers as well as a wide variety of other books 
were used as well. 

Early examples of these techniques of teaching were described 
in books by the following: Dr. John Dewey (1896), Colonel Francis 
W. Parker (1901), Professor J. L. Meriam (1904). Part I of the 
Nineteenth Yearbook of the N.S.S.E. (1920) devotes ten pages to a 
description of materials prepared cooperatively by teacher and 
children. 

More recent illustrations are given by Smith (1934) > Lamoureux 
and Lee (1943},Kallen(193$, Hardy (1931), Gans (1941). 

Readers which utilized this method were: 

"The Child* s Own Way Series" (1926) by Marjorie Hardy, 

"The Children* s Own Readers" (1929) by Pennell and Cusack, 

"Do and Learn Readers" (1930) by White and Hanthom, 

"The Unit-Activity Reading Series" (1935) by Nils B. Smith. 
Materials that were developed with the use of the experience 
method were the "script text" materials. Hildreth (1958, pp. 35-3?) 
used the term script text for any reading material, words, sentences, 
paragraphs, or stories, that was hand-lettered or typed by the 
teacher or by the pupils themselves. This distinguished it from the 
materials commercially printed and purchased by the school.

Hildreth (193S, p. 36) reported that Flora Cook of the Francis 
Parker School in Chicago was using her own blackboard script to 
record children*s sentences based on current experiences in 1900. 
Hildreth suggested that it was not until the introduction of man¬ 
uscript style lettering about 1920 that the experience movement 
began to gain ground. In 1922 Emma Watkins, in the Laboratory 
School of the University of Iowa, published an account of the ex¬ 
clusive use of script text in the instruction of beginners. Miss 
Watkins (1922) used charts, word cards, and hectographed lesson 
sheets for vocabulary and reading context, based on the children*s 
everyday experiences recorded in print-style writing or prepared on 
the typewriter. 

Gray (1956, pp. 90, 91) called these materials "learner- 
teacher prepared reading matter." In Gray* s opinion this kind of 
material, which was based on the immediate experiences of the 
pupils, usually elicited keen interest and hearty cooperation. 

Because the materials read had meaning, a thoughtful reading attit¬ 
ude was established from the beginning. The method, however, had 
several limitations in Gray*s judgment. These were to be found in 
the difficulties involved in preparing sufficient, suitably controlled 
well-written, and adequately recorded materials. Insufficiently 
trained teachers had difficulty in choosing words well and in arr¬ 
anging them in sequences to facilitate rapid mastery. All teachers 
found the demands on their time and effort heavy.

Russell (1949, p. Ill) considered that teacher-prepared 
materials had a relationship to the child* s needs at a particular 
time, and to other events in his daily life, which no other mater¬ 
ials could approximate. These materials made reading something 
more than "book leaming n to the child. On the other hand, Russell 
warned teachers regarding the indiscriminate use of these materials. 
Disadvantages in their use, at beginning stages especially, were 
the constant attention needed to vocabulary control and the diff¬ 
iculties involved in getting the necessary tools and constructing 
the materials. 

The experience method came into existence as a part of the 
activity movement in education. Smith (1934, P* 229) predicted 
that there would be greater and greater dependence upon the exper¬ 
ience method through functional reading in connection with activit¬ 
ies and units. Stone (1950) pointed out that this did not come 
about as predicted. Nevertheless, the method did gain recognition 
during the years between 1924 and 194&, as is pointed out in the 
comments to follow. 

The Yearbooks of the National Society for the Study of Education 
(1925, 1937, 1949) indicated the general viewpoint of educators up 
to the date of their publication. Each of the three yearbooks 
referred to the use of the experience method in beginning reading 
instruction and gave evidence of the changing position of this 
method in the teaching of reading.

In the Twenty-fourth Yearbook of the National Society for the 
Study of Education (1925, pp. 35-37) the committee suggested the 
use of lessons based on experience in the initial period of in¬ 
struction. The use of such lessons was justified by the fact that 
the more interesting and familiar the experience, the more inter¬ 
pretation there would be to carry over to the printed word. These 
were designed to stimulate keen interest in reading activities, 
to stimulate the habit of thinking about what was read and assoc¬ 
iating meaning with symbols and to develop a sight vocabulary to 
enable pupils to read the simplest first books. 

In the Thirty-sixth Yearbook . Gray (1937, pp. 89-91) in the 
section on "Materials and Methods of Beginning Reading" compared 
the experience-activity and the commercially prepared materials 
pointing out the values and limitations of each and stating the 
position of the Yearbook Committee as follows: 

The Yearbook Committee recognized that each of the fore¬ 
going approaches has its advantages and limitations. It 
recommends that the total program of activities provided should 
utilize the advantages of both procedures. At times reading 
materials based upon experience should be employed in order 
to gain as full benefit as possible from the values that attach 
to the use of immediate interests, pupil planning, and syrahols 
with which vivid meanings may be associated. To an increasing 
extent, however, as pupils learn to read, use should be made 
of books the content of which is sequential, that are skill¬ 
fully prepared with respect to word frequency and distribution, 
and that provide opportunity for varying amounts of practice 
in harmony with individual needs. (Gray, 1937, p. 91). 

This point of view suggested that, by 1936, the experience- 

activity approach to beginning reading had, in the eyes of this 

representative group of educators, found a recognized place as one 

approach to the teaching of reading. The experience approach, in

practice, was considered to be another acceptcible method with 
which to begin instruction in reading and one that should be used 
in conjunction with other methods. 

In the Forty-eighth Yearbook , Hildreth (1949, pp. 71-76), 
in a statement of the principles to which all good methods of 
beginning instruction conform, pointed out that the use of script- 
text materials had proved its value as an introduction to reading 
as a link between reading and current experiences, and as a tool 
for direct practice of reading skills. Hildreth asserted that 
teachers used different methods of handling beginning reading 
and described how the teachers might use and combine the exper¬ 
ience method and the basic readers. In the U3e of the script- 
text materials in the experience method she cautioned teachers 
against encouraging mere memorization of sentences, insufficient 
repetition of individual words in variable context, inadequate 
use of the charts in reading lessons and poor construction of them. 
She stressed the value of linking reading with language through 
the use of the script-text materials. Although the values of basic 
readers as a tool for systematic training were stressed, Hildreth 
made this comment regarding the place of script-text materials in 
beginning reading instruction: 

Teachers ordinarily do not introduce beginners to the 
individual book units without some preparation in the form 
of language work based on the first stories or script-text 
reading experience. With preparation through blackboard 
and chart reading the pupils are soon rea^r to practice 
reading in pre-primers of a basic series where they will 
find many words they have already met. (Hildreth, 1949, 

P. 77).

The experience method was an attempt to solve the main 
problem of beginning reading, namely, that of n bringing meaning 
to the printed page” or of ”clothing symbols in meaning.” The 
background of experience of the reader provided the elements 
from which this meaning was constructed or "reconstructed” from 
the symbols. It was the child* s own first-hand experiences to 
which concepts or ideas are related. This experience provided 
the context or setting from which to infer the meaning of the 
separate symbols. Anderson and Dearborn (1952) stressed the 
value of using the child* s own experiences for reading as follows: 

lhat the beginner in reading especially lacks are 
context clues by means of which he can check the meaning 
of what he reads. Herein is found the value of pictures 
and other means, such as the words or comments of the 
teacher or the so-called "experience-reading charts”, by 
which the child* s own "congruous” experiences, that is, 
those experiences which "fit”, are appropriate, or have 
to do with the matter at hand, may be reinstated or 
brought to mind to give meaning to the printed words. 
(Anderson and Dearborn, 1952, pp. 259 , 260) • 

Anderson and Dearborn found this interpretation of meaning, 
first through personal experiences, then vicariously by pictures 
or by word of mouth and then finally by the printed page, to be 
the primary problem of prereading. The experience method helped 
the child to secure this meaning in print because he had something 
in his own experience to which he could refer or relate the con¬ 
cepts or ideas he got from print. Stroud (194&, p. 170) also 
stressed the value of these experience charts to enable the be¬ 
ginner to check the congruity of the meaning he constructed from 
printed sentences.

This experience method was a learner-centred method and 
was primarily concerned with applying the principles of child 
development to reading methodology. To those who advocated 
this method of teaching reading the development of the learner 
was the main purpose of schooling. The mastery of subject matter 
and the development of skills were not the only goals. Progress 
in reading was considered to be an important aspect of individual 
development. Therefore the reader*s interests, immediate concerns, 
previous experiences, and special abilities and deficiencies, were 
given first consideration both in content and methods. The learner- 
prepared materials used in the experience method provided reading 
matter based on the immediate experiences of the group. The 
materials, therefore, had interest and meaning for the children and 
a thoughtful reading attitude was established from the beginning. 

The educational principles upon ich this method was based 
were those of the activity movement and the child-centred schools. 
The principle of learning by doing was applied in the construction 
and use of reading material based on the child* s own experiences 
and growing out of his activities. The principle of integrating 
experiences for most effective learning operated when reading be¬ 
came a part, not only of the language program, but of living in 
the classroom. The reading was meaningful to the child because it 
was based on his own experience and the vocabulary was controlled 
to the extent that it contained words from his own oral vocabulary. 
These words were rich in meaning for him.

Stone (1934? PP* 42, 43) recognized five important and 
significant values in functional reading and in the cooperative 
formulation and reading of units based upon children* s experiences 
and activities. These he summarized as follows: 

1. An important means of developing a correct and 
adequate concept of reading as a meaningful process closely- 
related to life activities. 

2. An aid in fostering an attitude of thought getting 
rather than mere word recognition and pronunciation. 

3. A means of arousing, maintaining, and increasing 
the child’s desire to learn to read. 

4* The medium for experience with an extensive vocab¬ 
ulary needed by those pupils who readily learn words and are 
entitled to an opportunity to expand their reading vocabulary. 

5. An excellent means of integrating a project, oral 
and written composition, and reading. (Stone, 1934, P* 42). 

Stone (1934, pp. 43, 44) was equally alert to the limitations 
and dangers of the “experience-activity" method as a sole approach 
to beginning reading. After pointing out the difficulties in con¬ 
trolling vocabulary, the danger of fostering memory reading, the 
lack of provision for integrated practice in word-recognition, the 
difficulties in meeting varying individual needs of children, he 
summed up his objections as follows: 

Project activities involving pupil purposing, planning, 
co-operating, and creating are an invaluable part of primary 
education. Nevertheless, the theory that all the reading 
activities must be related to, and grow out of, these activit¬ 
ies is psychologically unsound, unduly restricts the program 
in residing, and in practice fails to provide adequately for 
the instructional needs of many children. Incidental, correl¬ 
ated, and integrated reading has distinct and unique values, 
but it should parallel rather than supplant a systematic and 
sequential plan in beginning reading. (Stone, 1934, p. 47).

Stone (1934, pp. 45, 46) quoted one study by Lee (1933), 
which indicated that the activity program did not solve the 
problem of first-grade reading. Lee surveyed the achievement 
in first-grade reading in a large number of centers in California 
and produced data indicating that the schools giving the most 
emphasis to project activities made the poorest showing in read¬ 
ing achievement. Lee pointed out that the results did not mean 
that schools should not use the activity projects but the study 
did raise grave doubt that the experience or activity method used 
exclusively yielded satisfactory results in first-grade reading. 

Betts (1946, pp. 389-390, 423-424) pointed out thirteen 
values of experience records which are summarized as follows: 

1. The "natural order of learning" followed in the procedure 
from facts, or experience, to symbolization, or language, emphasized 
the relationship between language and experience. The reverse order 
which proceeded from language to experience produced verbalization. 

2. The childlike language, which r esulted when the materials 
of instruction were built in terms of the learner 1 s experience and 
language patterns, permitted children to learn to read more readily. 

3. Interest, which was one of the most potent factors in 
learning, could be enlisted and extended through the use of these 
chants. 

4. The satisfaction of pupils* needs could be achieved through 
providing a means of teaching the child the intricacies of how to 
read when he had needs to be satisfied in this way.

5. Skill in language organization which involved a feeling 
for sentence sequence and for the relationship between the group 
of sentences and the title of the record could be fostered through 
the use of experience records. 

6. Informal appraisal of such reading readiness factors as 
background of experience, oral language facility, social and emot¬ 
ional adjustments in group situations, -and visual discrimination 
could be made through observation during chart making. 

7. Parallel reading enrichment could be achieved through 
combining the use of experience records with basal-reader approach. 

8. The gradual transition from oral language to printed lan¬ 
guage which was made possible through the use of the experience 
approach to initial reading instruction was one of the chief values 
of this method. 

9. A gradual control over reading skills acquired as children 
used reading in relation to everyday problems, when reading was 
taught as a means to an end, n when children learned to read as they 
learned to talk” when "reading became an integral part of the child* s 
experience was possible through the use of the experience approach. 

10. A vertical program of language development was provided 
for through the use of experience records as an approach to the 
development of language skills and abilities. 

11. The legibility of well-made charts made with large letters 
in black ink on white paper background reduced the visual task of 
reading and contributes to good hygiene.

12. The reduction of near-point reading through the use 
of charts, also had hygienic values. "There are some data to 
substantiate the nation that excessive reading at close range - 
as required when reading a book - tended to induce nearsightness 
and to interfere with efficient two-eyed seeing habits." 

13. The provision of a common center of attention through 
the use of experience records, in addition to promoting social 
adjustment, made it possible to develop certain basic reading 
skills and abilities un er the direct guidance of the teacher. 
"Some of these items were left-to-right progression, accuracte 
return sweeps from the end of one line to the beginning of the 
next line, sentence sense, and visual discrimination. The variety 
of interesting and meaningful materials, developed through the 
common center of interest, contributed to the development of a.n 
attitude of approach to reading and to an understanding of when 
reading might be used profitably as a learning aid. 

Many of the limitations, according to Betts, grew out of the 
misuses of experience records. Eleven of the limitations stressed 
by Betts are summarized belo*v: 

1. The possibility of memorization wa,s an ever-present pit- 
fall to be avoided during initial instruction. "This memorization 
of instructional material defeated the chief purpose of the reading 
program, namely, the development of attitudes toward the use of the 
language." Betts maintained that children who were led to believe 
they were reading when they repeated from memory the context of an 
experience record were denied a iund.amenta-1 understanding, "namely,

that words and groups of words stand for, or represent, experience." 

He proclaimed memory "reading" to be worse than no reading. 

2. The uncontrolled vocabulary created several problems. The 
vocabulary employed in charts might not be serviceable for the child 
in his attempts to "read" beginning books. If it added more than 
four to six new words each day it would tax his capacity to the 
limit. Insuring sufficient repetition of basic vocabulary to guar¬ 
antee retention confronted the teacher with another crucial problem. 
Established principles of learning demanded that the basic vocabulary 
must be serviceable for reading beginning bodks. They also demanded 
that sufficient repetition be provided in meaningful situations to 
facilitate retention. 

3. Narrow reading programs might result when reading experiences 
were limited to the development and use of experience records. Pupils 
were denied rich experiences with picture books and "beginning" read¬ 
ing materials and one of the major goals of reading instruction - 
namely the extension of interest and enrichment of experience - was 
not attained. 

4. The questionable quality of the material was, probably, one 
of the most damaging criticisms aimed at some attempts to use the 
experience approach to reading instruction. Literary quality was 
impaired when the teacher had little knowledge of creative writing, 
when she lacked a feeling for the beauty of language or when vocab¬ 
ulary repetition was exercased to the point that the material was 


"wooden"

5. Poor attitudes could bd developed with experience 
records. An almost exclusive use of experience records or over¬ 
emphasis of them could foster an attitude of withdrawal from 
reading and writing situations. Betts (1946, p. 42) quoted a 
story that has been circulated for a number of years as an example: 

A busload of children was on an excursion. The teacher 
overheard a child with a speech defect give this advice to a 
classmate: "Don*t wook*. If you wook, you have to wite and 

if you wite, you have to wead'. M 

Poor attitudes also might be developed when the experience 
record was used only for drill purposes. Over-zealous concern with 
vocabulary retention might give the child "experience” in word drill 
alone. 

6. Overdependence on context clues could be developed when 
the principles basic to the experience approach were interpreted 
literally. This results in memorization and sheer guessing. 

7. Lack of creative reading was a criticism leveled at some 
attempts to use the experience approach. This could happen when 
all the reading activities were limited to the everyday experiences 
of children. 

8. Regimented instruction might be another result of exper¬ 
ience record approach if individual needs and rates of learning 
varied widely. 

9. The time factor was a limitation for a large quantity of 
material was required to meet the reading needs of children and the 
mechanical tasks of chart construction often required long hours 


after school

10. Oral reading could be overemphasized so that the principle 
that silent reading should precede oral reading was sometimes 
violated. 

11. The demands upon the teachers* experience, knowledge 

of techniques, time for preparation, ability to appraise learner 
levels of achievement, and to insure systematic growth in vocab¬ 
ulary control and other firsts in reading, without violating the 
principles and assumptions basic to this approach, were extremely 
heavy. In short, superior teachers were required to make the 
best possible use of this experience approach. 

McKee (1943, PP« 221, 222) pointed out two important advant¬ 
ages in the use of experience charts to develop the initial sight 
vocabulary: 

(1) The content of each selection was charged with meanings 
that were familiar to the pupils. Consequently, from the first, 
the children learned that reading matter stood for meanings or 
ideas. 

(2) The words and structure of each sentence arefamiliar to 
the pupils. Thus the child’s first attempts at learning to read 
are not made difficult by the necessity of learning new types of 
sentence structure and word pronunciation as well as the forms of 
words. 

These advantages are not peculiar to experience charts, for other 
types of home-made materials and the more carefully prepared commer¬ 
cial pre-primers have these same advantages.

McKee (1943, pp. 222-224) also pointed out these five dis¬ 
advantages that he attributed to the use of experience charts: 

(1) The content of the charts, although they contained 
only familiar meanings,was insipid and dull to the great major¬ 
ity of children. They told him nothing he did not already know. 
There was no story-element nor any strong interest-pull. There 
was no incentive to read to find out something new. For this 
reason the experience charts were poor material with which to 
feed the children* s desire to read and with which to begin devel¬ 
opment of the attitude of demanding meaning in reading. 

(2) The provision which experience charts made for word 
identification was so inadequate that the average child could 
not become sufficiently acquainted with most of the important 
printed words to permit his subsequent recognition of those words. 
Heavy word load, the "hurry-up" method employed in reading the 
material and lack of sufficient repetition of important words 
contributed to this failure to learn basic words. 

(3) The encouragement that chart use gave to the practice 
of reciting words from memory and calling it reading was a 
questionable practice. Such reciting was not reading. Before 
the child could learn to read he would have to know individual 
printed words. 

(4) The children were actually given practice in "reading* 1 
sentences from charts without the voice control essential to 
making meaning. This was often done when the teacher tried to get 
the pupil to associate the pronunciation of each with the forms.

McKee claimed that this kind of practice, forcing children to 
"read” lines as they would not be spoken or heard, was one type 
of practice that should be avoided religiously. 

(5) The construction of the charts consumed more of the 
teacher 1 s time than was warranted by the amount of reading material 
they supplied to the children. 

In McKee* s judgment the use of experience charts for the purpose 
of beginning the building of the initial sight vocabulary was highly 
questionable. If used at all for that purpose, they certainly should 
not be the sole or chief reading materials utilized. 

Burton found that the experience approach to beginning reading 
made a sharp break with tradition in that, for the first time, read¬ 
ing instruction began with other than the actual reading materials 
themselves. In this approach the child himself helped to prepare 
some of his own reading materials, basing them directly on his store¬ 
house of meaningful experiences. The impact of this experience 
approach i3 suggested in the following quotation: 

Practically all modem basal primary reading series 
make use to some extent of the experience approach. They 
provide initial stories based on experiences that children 
are almost certain to have had in everday living, and 
limit their initial vocabularies to simple words that the 
children are almost certain to have used orally in everyday 
living. Furthermore, they encourage children to make and 
enjoy many reading materials of their own. Thus there has 
been a definite shift in recent years, even in ready-made 
instructional materials, toward the use of children* s exper¬ 
iences in teaching beginning reading. Through the use of 
these experiences, knowledge of the symbol and of the meaning 
develop hand in hand. (Burton, 1956, pp. 213, 214).

Burton pointed out the need for attractive, neat, well- 
illustrated, soundly composed and mechanically suitable charts. 

He emphasized the need for the teacher to be able to handle 
children expertly, to manipulate content deftly in order to suit 
the background experiences and developmental needs of the children 
and to make the materials attractive mechanically to the children. 
Burton saw ten values in the use of experience reading charts: 

1. Reading grows out of the natural ongoing activities. It 
is not formal or remote. It is not a "subject.” 

2. The first reading materials are the child*s own words. 

He actually sees them transformed into print. Meaning and 
understanding are already there. Reading is functional from 
the beginning. 

3. The rate of growth, including the acquisition of abilities 
and attitudes, is almost wholly regulated by the children 
themselves. 

4. The stories, if truly derived from the children* s exper¬ 
iences, are almost certain to be interesting and meaningful. 

5. The content serves one of the essential purposes of 
education; to provide knowledge about, and understanding of, 
the immediate physical and social environment. 

6. The audience situation is a natural accompaniment. 

7. Language abilities and skills are developed naturally 
and freely, almost without attention. 

8. Important phases of comprehension, such as following 
sequence, summarizing, perceiving relationships, and organ¬ 
izing thought and expression, are attained. 

9. Social growth, with all the accompanying benefits, 
emerges along with growth in reading ability. 

10. Adjustments may be made readily to individual differences. 
(Burton, 1956, p. 227). 

Burton considered that the experience-chart approach required 
highly competent instruction. The following are eight weaknesses 
which might exist if teachers were not carefully trained in the use 


of charts:

1. The experiences and the reading materials derived 
therefrom may be imposed upon the children, thus losing all 
the advantages of interest and meaning, 

2. The reading materials may be poorly developed, un¬ 
organized, and nonsequential. 

3. The content may be restricted, held too closely to 
the immediate experiences of the children. 

4* The vocabulary may be carelessly managed. Too many 
words may be included, possibly any and all words suggested 
by the children, resulting in far too large a range. Repetition 
of words may be neglected, or on the contrary, may be badly 
over-done. 

5. The sentences that the children suggest may have ex¬ 
ceedingly poor literary quality. 

6. The materials may become boring, be reread until the 
children become sick of them. 

7. The materials may be memorized, resulting in word- 
calling rather than reading. 

8. The teachers may unduly consume their time and energy 
in developing charts, especially if they are inexperienced. 

They need to realize that chart-making, if carried to an ex¬ 
treme, may become wasteful. (Burton, 1956, pp. 227, 228) 

Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 92-94) recognized four educational 

principles underlying the method as follows: 

1. The child learns through doing. Reading is a natural out¬ 
growth of his activities. 

2. Integrated learning is the most effective learning. In 
the use of this method there is a close integration betvreen the 
child*s activities and experiences, his language and his reading. 

3. The child* s own experiences are more real to him than 
those of other persons, and therefore reading is more meaningful. 

4. Words which the child uses in his everyday conversation 
are most easily learned. 

At the same time Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 94-96) saw fund¬ 
amental weaknesses in the method. These included the difficulty 
of material, uncontrolled vocabulary and concept load, the tendency

to foster memory reading, the poor quality of much of this co¬ 
operative material and the lack of encouragement of imaginative 
reading and an attitude of discovery. 

They recommended the use of the experience chart as a supp¬ 
lementary aid in teaching beginning reading but did not think it 
could be expected to "do the whole job". As a means to "introduce 
the child to reading" it could make certain contributions. It 
showed him that printed material had something to tell. It intro¬ 
duced reading as a part of communication. The children saw, as 
they worked with the teacher in preparing the charts, how reading 
was to be done from left to right. Interest was aroused in reading 
and, under good teaching, the children could be led from the exper¬ 
ience chart reading to the desire to read the experiences of others. 

Tinker (1952, pp. 107-110), in describing devices effective in 
the initial exposure to reading, suggested that experience charts 
might be an integral part of the reading readiness program. He 
stressed their values in developing language and group cooperation. 

He showed how the teacher could use them to develop the realization 
that printed symbols carry meaning and to guide children to note 
the manner in which ideas were converted into print. Eventually 
the child would begin to identify certain word forms and desirable 
training in visual discrimination could be given. Through all these 
activities the child would begin to read. Tinker drew attention to 
the need for the charts to fulfill certain mechanical requirements 
to be maximally effective. These referred to sentence length, word 
choice and repetition, language form, length of chart and construction

He pointed out four frequently mentioned limitations: 

(1) The word repetition necessary to develop an adequate 
sight vocabulary was difficult,and often impossible, to accomplish. 

(2) The charts themselves were frequently uninteresting to 
the pupils. Excessive rereading killed whatever interest was 
present in the organizing of the chart. 

(3) Reliance on memory reading rather than recognition of 
word forms was encouraged in reading the chert. 

(4) The excessive mechanical work required of the teacher 
in constructing the charts was a handicap. 

Yoakam (1955, p. 78) noted the virtue of the emphasis, in 
this approach,upon reading as meaningful experience. The result¬ 
ant insight given the child into the significance of reading and 
writing, the absence of meaningless drill end the natural introd¬ 
uction to the reading of books end other materials were positive 
gains for the method. 

On the other hand, Yoakam claimed that it took an exceptionally 
able teacher to teach children to read in this informed, and functional 
manner. The classroom teacher had neither the experience nor the 
opportunity to employ in the preparation of her experience materials 
the kind of skill applied to the construction of commercially pre¬ 
pared materials. She could never emulate the physical excellence, 
vocabulary control or planned repetitions of the modem primary 
materials prepared by trained people who devote time, effort and 
thought exclusively to these problems. Yoakam pointed out that, 
for this reason, many advocated that the experience method be used

in conjunction with a basic reading series in order that the 
teacher and the children might reap dual benefits. 

Anderson and Dearborn (1949, pp. 265-269) did not consider 
the experience method a complete method of teaching beginning 
reading. They pointed out the difficulties involved in controlling 
vocabulary, the tendency to depend entirely on memory reading and 
the neglect of development of word recognition. Too many different 
words with insufficient repetition per word made the development of 
a right vocabulary, through this method alone, a real problem. 
Anderson and Dearborn pointed out that the experience method served 
the same function as the story or sentence method in that it aroused 
an interest in reading and developed a thought-getting attitude. 

It was, therefore, not to be used to "teach real reading" but to 
introduce reading as a form of communication. Experience stories 
were not a replacement for basal reader materials but a preparation 
for them. 

An analysis of the strengths attributed to the experience 
method by these educators produces the following list of strong 
features: 

(1) It developed a correct concept of reading as a meaningful 
process. The child* s own experiences were more meaningful to him 
than were those of other persons. Using these personal experiences 
as reading content gave the child insight into the significance of 
reading and writing. Reading had meaning and function from the 
beginning.

(2) It aroused and maintained interest, thus increasing 
the child*s desire to read. 

(3) It provided for a gradual transition from oral to 
printed language. Skills in language and in reading were re¬ 
lated and developed freely and naturally. Reading from the 
beginning, developed as a form of communication. 

(4) It followed the natural order of learning by proceeding 
from experience (or facts) to symbolization (or language). This 
procedure emphasized the relationship between language (including 
reading) and experience. 

(5) It related reading closely to the child*s daily activities 
and made reading a part of, and natural outgro?» T th of, these activitie 
In this way the approach to reading was gradual and natural. This 
integration of learning was in keeping with the newer principles 

of learning growing out of the activity movement. 

(6) It was child-centred, in that it used content related 

to the child* s immediate interests and used language of the child* s 
own making. 

(7) It provided for the development of certain basic reading 
skills, such as left-to-right progression, accurate return eye- 
sweep, and abilities in visual discrimination. 

(g) It provided activities through which reading readiness 
factors such as oral language facility, background of experience, 
social and emotional adjustments in group situations and visual 
discrimination could be appraised.

(9) It provided for individual differences in ability to 
read in that it could meet the needs of both the slow and the 
fast-learning child. Children would increase in understanding 
of the process, and develop sight vocabulary in accordance with 
their abilities to comprehend and remember. Real reading devel¬ 
oped from approximate reading gradually, and in keeping with the 
child*s capacities and rate of growth. 

The same process of analysis revealed that prominent teachers 
of reading found deficiencies in procedures emphasizing reading 
and experience: 

(l) Difficulties in controlling the vocabulary were a major 
problem. Poor word selection, lack of attention to adequate 
repetition and re-reading,resulted in lack of development of an 
adequate and basic sight vocabulary. 

(2) Lack of provision for integrated practice in vrord recog¬ 
nition resulted in haphazard methods 6i word attack and over-emphasis 
on guessing through the use of context clues. 

(3) Dangers of fostering memory reading were always present. 

This memory reading defeats the main purpose of reading, in that 
it does not require the child to interpret the printed symbols. 

(4) Oral reading was sometimes over-emphasized in. this method 
where all material was read orally from the first. 

(5) The quality of the reading material being used, in many 
cases>was questionable. Poorly-developed, unorganized, non-sequential, 
stories and sentences of poor literary quality did not provide suit¬ 
able reading material for children.

(6) Demands upon the teacher were extremely heavy and unduly 
time-consuming. The method required highly competent instruction 
and considerable expenditure of both time and effort on the 
teacher’s part. 

(7) Lack of opportunity to develop creative or interpretative 
reading was a serious flaw in the method. The child always knew 
what the sentences told before he was required to read them, which 
resulted in no opportunities to read ’’to find out” or to interpret 
new material. 

The main contribution of the experience method was the influence 
it had on the development of new materials for instruction in be¬ 
ginning reading. The emphasis on materials based on children’s 
experience has left a permanent imprint on reader materials used 
today. The method also established the use of script text mater¬ 
ials composed by the teacher and the children themselves. Through¬ 
out its use the experience method reinforced the emphasis on 
reading for meaning which previous methods had introduced. The 
experience method revealed the value of using reading in beginning 
instruction as it functions in daily life as a vital and useful 
part of daily experience. 

In the consensus regarding the experience method one import¬ 
ant fact stands out. The method has, during the past twenty 
five yeafs, established itself as one method of approach to be¬ 
ginning reading. Ihen combined with other methods it has definite 
contributions to make to the child’s understanding of the reading 
process and to his skill in performance. It is to be recommended

as an aid in teaching beginning reading but it cannot do the 
whole job. It is not to be used to develop basic reading skills 
but to introduce reading as a form of communication. Experience 
stories are not a replacement for basal reader materials but a 
preparation for them. As a single approach to beginning reading 
it has such serious weaknesses that it is considered inadvisable 
to attempt to teach beginning reading solely through use of the 
experience method.

THE NATURAL INCIDENTAL METHOD 
This method is described in some detail in Stone*s (1936) 
•publication under the heading of extreme theories and plans. 

Huey (1912) advocated such an approach and advanced the idea 
that the child should learn to read at home. That some precocious 
children learn to read at home naturally and incidentally, before 
the age of six, is a fact well-known to most of us. 

Dr. J. L. Meriam (1930) presented certain statistical evidence, 
according to Stone (1936, p. 194) > that the incidental method pro¬ 
duced better results than conventional methods. Meriam claimed that 
the best way to teach reading was not to teach reading, but to do 
vigorously that in which reading functions. 

Dr. Meriam set forth two fundamental principles and procedures 
of the incidental method as follows: 

1. The best way to teach reading is not to teach reading, 
but to provide the occasion - normal in the lives of little 
children - in which certain reading functions. This statement 
is not intended to be epigrammatical, spectacular. Its purpose 
is emphasis upon economical teaching and economical learning. 
When Basedow used his gingerbread method of teaching reading he 
set an example of waste - financial waste in supplying the 
gingerbread horn-books, though he claims this additional expense 
was trifling; pedagogical waste in using his ingenuity in devis¬ 
ing such savory motives instead of providing suitable reading 
material. Basedow* s example is too generally followed by primary 
teachers today. 

2. Let pupils read to learn; incidentally they will learn 
to read. This statement is not a mere affected aphorism. It 
is seriously intended to place before teachers and pupils the 
real objective, not to learn an art, but to practice one. Of 
course, pupils are destined to learn to read. But the acquis¬ 
ition of this ability may be - it should be - incidental to 
the accomplishment of a more worthy purpose. This principle 
will not readily be accepted by teachers or laymen. Custom has 
a tenacious grip, and frankly to countenance objectives as 
found in real life is a staggering challenge.

These two principles are thus proposed as fundamental. 

The latter emphasizes function, the former minimizes method. 

The two work together in insisting that the reading process, 
initial or later, be economical. Where the normal motive for 
reading approaches 100 per cent, the method approaches zero. 

How do two-year-old children acquire ability to talk? How 
does the child of six acquire the forms of table etiquette? 
Learning to talk is incidental to children 1 s prattle; and 
table etiquette is incidental to food consumption in good 
family life and society. In recent years - even days - we 
hear such statements as: ’’geography” is learned in the study 
of transportation; ’’language” is developed in group conferences. 
This tendency is most marked. The case method - of a sort - 
is coming into practice. We study incidents in real life, 
not generalizations upon such life. Children are to enjoy the 
story now in print before them. They are to get from the 
printed page the information which they wish. We are thus 
in a position to attack our real problem in reading. 

The last few statements made clearly indicate: that the 
initial steps in reading will be intimately related to certain 
definite activities in which the children are concerned, act¬ 
ivities in themselves independent of any reading. Some teachers 
and students of education will at once say that just this is 
practiced in our progressive schools. {As a basis for ’’reading” 
exercises, pupils are taken on an excursion of the dairy.) Then 
statements about the dairy are placed on chart or blackboard 
for pupils to read. Indeed, much of this teaching goes on in 
our schools, especially the so-called progressive ones. But 
in such cases we have illustrations of the project method in 
its simple form; the ds_iry excursion is used as a device for 
motivating reading. 

The two principles proposed above are diametrically opp¬ 
osed to this project method device. Reading and children’s 
activities are intimately related, but, as here proposed, read¬ 
ing is strictly a means to further the activity. The activity 
is not to be used as a means of furthering the reading. In 
the procedure here described, it is essential that this distinc¬ 
tion definitely be recognized. 

It is important to make three further statements, of a very 
practical nature, about reading: 

1. People enjoy reading about their own activities, or 
even about themselves. I am not so sure that this applies to 
the President of the United States and to our congressmen. But 
it is indeed true of little people in our lower schools. And 
it would be easy to indicate other groups interested in press 
reports and accounts in script referring to themselves. 

2. Such reports and stories have a ’’boomerang” effect, 
that is, they return to the individual and stimulate him to 
a renewal of his activity, and to an improvement upon his

previous achievement. To appear in print is helpful. A 
’’write-up" on blackboard, chart, or paper pleases the pupil 
and stimulates a renewal of his activity. As with the ind¬ 
ividual, so with a group of pupils. The whole class as a 
group is stimulated by reports of the group activity. 

3. Initial steps in reading are most effective when 
they relate to behaviors most active. Pupils respond little 
to a story of "number work," as indicated by "Emmy Lou, labor¬ 
iously copying digits." But these same pupils react promptly 
to a pithy account of their game of marbles or relay race. 

In short, pupils are much more responsive to stories of in¬ 
tense action than to those of inaction. (Meriam, 1930, pp. 

190 - 195). 

Concerning the matter of word recognition in the earliest 
stage of beginning reading Meriam said: 

The first "reading" is largely seeing .and remembering 
expressions used orally only a moment before. Identification 
of individual words is not important. Errors are not serious. 
Indeed these little children do not make mistakes; as Judd 
pointed out in one of his first books, they only fail to do 
what adults expected of them. So, in the first story above, 
the serious rather than emotional pupil may read: "We played 
very fast," instead of "we played so fast." He was close to 
the spirit of the little story. The misreading of one word 
need not even be noted. 

Tell to pupils the recurring words when later they do not 
recall them. Prompt telling is the readiest means of helping 
the pupils on into the story and into further activity. Tell 
them "seventy times seven times” without becoming discouraged. 
Ho, not.many times, for the functioning of the word tends 
strongly to fix it early. But it is important that pupils 
make haste slowly at first. Later, advancement is made rapidly. 
(Meriam, 1930, p. 1S5). 

Stone (1950) indicated three pitfalls to the success of this 


method as follows: 

1. Children have vastly more need to learn to talk in relation 
to their needs, desires and activities, than they have to read. 

The majority of children can get along very happily without the use 
of functional reading. They need to be surrounded by conditions 
most favorable to success in getting started in reading, as well as 
those conditions that merely emphasize the function of reading.

2. The majority of children find the process of learning 
to read a rs.ther complex and difficult one and need planned and 
controlled reading experiences so that, in their approach to 
reading, the difficulties are reduced to a minimum and the inter¬ 
est in reading is raised to a maximum. 

3. That one hundred percent motivation will bring success 
in a complicated learning situation regardless of the lack of 
system is an erroneous assumption. 

Dr. Gates (1923, p. 236), as a result of a study of 130 pupils 
left entirely or almost entirely to their own devices, concluded 
that pupils ranging from fair to distinct^ superior intelligence 
frequently fail to develop satisfactory techniques of word percep¬ 
tion and recognition with natural incidental methods. Many of the 
children became overdependent on context clues. At least a fourth 
of the children floundered considerably or deplorably. Half of the 
children made.scarcely any progress in learning to read. 

Stone (1950) considered this extreme form of the incidental- 
experience method to be a fundamental issue in reading methodology. 
He described the extreme position taken by those who considered 
that learning to read should be a natural, informal, incidental, 
opportunistic process like learning to talk. According to this 
theory there should be no formal instruction in reading, no course 
of study, no formulation of standards of attainment by reading 
levels and no special textbooks in reading. The reading content 
would all be related to the experiences, project activities and 
units making up the curriculum. This theory emphasized the value

of interest as a motivating force in learning, and the incentive 
provided to read which were stimulated by the demands of the 
activities. The functional purposes for reading or the pleasure 
of reading itself inspired interest and motives sufficient to 
carry the child over all difficulties. 

Gates (1953, pp. 28, 29) referred to these methods as 
"laissez-faire procedures" in which the teacher assumed that the 
task was merely to get children vigorously active and that good 
learning would naturally and necessarily follow. The basal fault 
of this method is its lack of adequate guidance. Gates pointed out 
that children cannot learn reading and such similarly complex 
skills without definite meaningful instruction and guidance by a 
teacher who understands what abilities must be learned and how to 
see and provide what a particular child ns eds in order to learn. 

This method did not ever gain a strong foothold in teaching 
practice. Its chief advantages were illustrated in the experience 
methods. Its weakness was that it provided no guidance in the 
development of the skills necessary in so complex a process as 
reading. 

Gray (1931) pointed out the surprisingly large number of 
remedial cases that had been found in schools where reading was 
taught more or less incidentally. Only a few educators considered 
the method sufficiently important to deserve description.

FEENALD KINAESTHETIC TECHNIQUE 

The Femald Kinaesthetic technique is classified with the 
’’experience” methods because it employed sensory experience as 
a basic learning procedure. This method was designed originally 
and primarily to teach children who had failed to learn to read 
with other methods. It was used experimentally in classrooms 
with groups of children who were said to be partially disabled 
readers. During the twenty-odd years following the mid-twenties 
this method created much attention. 

The method proceeded as follows: 

Stage I - Tracing : 

The child selected any word he wished to learn regardless of 
difficulty or length. The word was written for the child with 
crayola on paper in blackboard-size script or in manuscript while 
the child observed the process. Then the child traced the word 
with his first or second finger, saying each part of the word as 
he traced it. This tracing was repeated as often as was necessary 
to enable the child to write the word without looking at the model. 

Almost immediately the child began to write his own stories. 

Any word he did not know was written for him and was learned by 
him before he wrote it in his story. The story he wrote was type¬ 
written for him within the day. He then read the typewritten copy 
orally without delay. Silent reading was used to prepare for fluent 
oral reading. Words written for the child were filed by him in an 
alphabetized word file which he used to look up any words he miglt 
forget.

Words were regarded as units, were never analyzed by parts, 
were always used in context and were always drawn from the child 1 s 
speech vocabulary. Words must have meaning to the child and be 
ones he was interested in learning. The first few words might not 
be words used in a story but they met ih e above criteria. All 
initial activities proposed to convince the child that he could 
learn words and that he could remember them. Later words were 
those he used in experience records, on labels or in captions. 

Children were never permitted to correct errors which necess¬ 
itate the erasing of parts of the words. The word was always written 
as a unit without looking at the copy. If an error was made the 
whole word was traced again and again until it could be written 
without looking at the copy. Attention was directed to the correct 
form, not to errors. As the child learned the printed word directly, 
finger tracing was gradually eliminated. 

The child, in this first stage, made use of several aids to 
learning: 

(a) The word had meaning for him. 

(b) He was motivated by a desire to use the word in communication. 

(c) The child saw the word many times. As it was written by 
the teacher, as he traced it, as he wrote it, and in its final type 
form, he got repeated visual impressions of the word. 

(d) He felt the word through finger contact, through arm 
movement in tracing and writing and through pronouncing the word, 
always combining the seeing, saying and feeling activities. 

(e) He hear d the word pronounced first by the teacher and then

by himself, always accompanied by the seeing and feeling experiences 
of the word. 

How long the child stayed in this first stage depended on his 
handicap. Some completed the stage in a few days, others in a 
year. No systematic help in phonetic analysis was given. The 
emphasis was in structural analysis, especially syllabication. The 
child began to generalize and to malce out new words from their resem¬ 
blance to words he already knew. These words were recognized immed¬ 
iately and not through a slow "sounding-out” process, for, as he 
looked at the word, the simultaneous association by similarity with 
words he already knew, together with the meanings inferred from 
context, gave him an instant perception of the word. 

Stage II - Writing from Script : 

This stage had been achieved when the words could be learned 
without tracing. '4e number of tracings were reduced gradually as 
less retracings were required. The child learned by looking at the 
word in script, by saying it and by writing it without copy as he 
said each part. The steps were much the same as in stage one, ex¬ 
cepting that tracing was eliminated. The child identified the 
word he could not write, then the teacher wrote it as a whole as 
she oronounced each part. The child said each part of the word as 
he wrote it as a whole without the copy. It was important that the 
word was spoken naturally as in conversation, with no distortion 
of the sounds of letters or syllables permitted. If an error was 
made the child either retraced or looked at the whole word, saying 
it to himself until he could write it without copy.

No attempt was made to simplify the vocabulary, sentence 
structure,or concepts in the child*s composition. Immediate and 
delayed recall was checked with the flash cards from the small file 
box. The only method of learning eliminated at this stage was that 
of tracing. 

Stage III - Writing from Print ; 

(Initial book reading) 

This stage was reached when the child could write the word 
after looking at the printed form of it. It was no longer necess¬ 
ary for the teacher to write the word for him. Instead, she pron¬ 
ounced it for him. 

Books were introduced. Silent reading was done first. During 
this activity, unknown words were identified and the child was told 
what they were. After the silent reading the new words were learned 
by first looking at the printed word and then writing it without 
looking at it. Immediate and delayed recall of the words was 
appraised by flash cards or some other means. 

Stage IV - Re cognition of Words without Writing : 

"(Book reading and use of visual analysis techniques) . 

This stage had been reached when it was no longer necessary 
for the child to write a ?ford in order to remember it. Femald (1943) 
claimed that, as he looked at words, the simultaneous association by 
similarity with words he already knew, together with the meanings 
inferred from the context, gave him an instant perception of the 
word. 

With this procedure children always did their own reading; no 
one ever read to them. Word recognition was developed by a syllab¬ 
ication approach. When necessary, writing the word without copy

was used. Phrasing was improved by developing the habit of 
silent reading "to clear up the meaning of the few new words." 

During this fourth stage progress was rapid. 

Betts (l94o> p. 333),who discussed the technique, which he 
called the Femald-Keller approach, did so merely to call attention 
to it as one way of teaching children to read. He did not recommend 
it for all children but considered it a means of helping children 
who had certain types of difficulties through suggesting some 
variations as alternate techniques to develop word recognition. 

In summary he pointed out five important features of the method: 

(1) Very few children required this type of guidance. 

(2) Words were never spelled orally. 

(3) Words were always written as wholes, never in separate 
syllables. 

(4) Tiie child never copied the ?/ord, it was always written 
from memory. 

(5) The correct form of the word was emphasized, the incorrect 
form (i.e., an error) was always erased or covered up. 

Kottmeyer (1945) claimed that the attitude of reading author¬ 
ities toward the Femald method appeared to be colored somewhat by 
skepticism as to the importance of the kinaesthetic factor itself 
in the reading process. The success of retarded children taught 
in this way was attributed to the fact that children were required, 
by this method, to observe word forms more closely and carefully 
than they were accustomed to do by other methods. Any method which 
achieved this end improved word perception. The comparatively slow.

laborious approach involved in finger tracing was not necessary* 

In fact, Betts (194&, P» 332) suggested that with the repetition 
required and the emphasis on the multi-sensory approach the child 
could hardly avoid learning the word* 

Hildreth, in the Forty-eighth Yearbook (1949, p. 35), sugg¬ 
ested that tracing the separate letters probably sharpened the 
visual perception of the word. This appeared to her to be the 
chief value of tracing rather than the supposed training or ex¬ 
ercise of tiie ,! kinaesthic sense.” Tracing she considered to be 
a tedious way of learning words and suggested that it might detract 
from seeing words as wholes and thinking of their meanings. 

The contributions of this method were largely due to clinical 
procedures. It was one means of helping children who had certain 
types of difficulties, but was not a method recommended for all 
children or for regular classroom use.

SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER 

Methods emphasizing reading as experience made the reading 
process meaningful and functional to children from the beginning. 
The relating of reading to daily activities and experiences and 
the close linking of it with speaking and writing gave the process 
of reading significance for the child and emphasized its place 
and function in language activities and daily experiences. These 
experience methods, growing out of a broadened concept of reading 
and the role it plays in life and reacting to new theories about 
the psychology of children and of learning, left an indelible 
imprint on the approach to teaching reading to beginners. Methods, 
as a result, became more closely associated with children*s needs, 
interests and abilities. The experience method had weaknesses 
which meant it was not adequate as a single approach to beginning 
reading but must be used in combination with other methods.

METHODS EMPHASIZING BROADENED 


READING OBJECTIVES

CHAPTER VII 

METHODS EMPHASIZING BROADENED REAPING O B JECTIVES 

The objectives of initial instruction in reading in the 1930* s 
and 1940* s were broader and more inclusive than those of earlier 
decades. To satisfy these objectives new and different methods of 
teaching reading were introduced. These methods went beyond the 
former stress on reading as a tool for getting meaning and on the 
importance of reading as experience to integrate these separate 
influences in a more balanced reading program. The methods 
emphasizing these broadened objectives in reading were the composite- 
eclectic, the intrinsic and those employed in the new basic readers, 

COMPOSITE-ECLECTIC METHODS 

These approaches to beginning instruction in reading combined 
several methods by selecting and using whatever seemed best from 
the various sources. Smith (1934) called the period beginning in. 

1925 11 a period of emphasis on broadened objectives in reading." 

The methods used were composite ones designed to develop the diff¬ 
erent abilities needed in the various purposes for which reading 
was used in well-rounded living. No one type of instruction was 
given an exaggerated emphasis. The methods of the new basal readers 
exemplified this emphasis. Gray (1943) emphasized the "balanced 
approach" of these new basic readers. In a later survey Gray des¬ 
cribed these methods as "eclectic" and "learner-centred" and consid¬ 
ered that they attempted to overcome the limitations of the specialized

methods as well as to achieve "broader objectives in reading." 
Stone (1950, p. 59) pointed out the "better-balanced” plans in 
the composite methods of the new readers. Adams, Gray and Reese 
(1949, p. 53) asserted that broadened objectives characterized 
these modern reading programs which strove for balanced activity. 
Bond and Wagner (1950, p. 100) designated this kind of reading 
instruction as that which was a well-organized composite of other, 
methods. Schonell (1956, p. 53), Tinker (1957, p. 99), Anderson 
and Dearborn (1952, p. 293) and Dolch (1955, p. 107) supported 
these descriptions of the modern "balanced" programs as consisting 
of a combination of methods. 

Interpretations of the composite-eclectic programs vary but 
they have certain characteristics in common. Russell (1949, pp* 
143-145), Tinker (1952, pp. 93-113), Yoakam (1955, pp. 12-17), 
Gates (1953), Hildreth (1953, pp. 133, 139), Burton (1956, pp. 

216, 591# 592) and McKee (1943, pp. 193-199) supply the basis for 
the following list of the main characteristics of these composite 
and eclectic methods: 

(1) The method was designed to meet broadened objectives and 
to provide a balanced program of instruction. 

(2) Procedures were characterized by flexibility and variety. 

(3) The experience method and the basal reader approach were 
often combined for beginning instruction. 

(4) Both silent and oral reading methods were used. Silent 
reading usually proceeded oral reading in teaching. 

(5) Everyday experiences formed the basis for content in

reading materials- Familiar experiences provided the basis for 
interpretation of the symbols representing words within the child¬ 
ren* s vocabulary. 

(6) Emphasis on the relationship between the symbols and 
the ideas or things they represented was basic to the idea that 
reading was meaningful - a process of interpreting symbols. Comp¬ 
rehension and meaning reading were emphasized from the first. 

(7) Emphasis on purposes for reading was important from the 
beginning. 

(3) Interest was a fundamental principle. Methods and mater¬ 
ials generally took into account the importance of a strong desire 
to read, of strong motives for reading, and of pleasure and satis¬ 
faction in the results of effort. 

(9) Reading was closely linked with language. Reading was an 
integral part of the total language program and was dependent on it 
for the development of many basic skills. 

(10) The building of specific reading skills was a major con¬ 
sideration. Fundamental reading habits, word-recognition skills, 
word-analysis techniques and interpretative skills were considered 
essential. It was generally agreed that reading was a complex and 
subtle process involving the development of many specific techniques. 

(11) The building of a sight vocabulaiy was an important first 
job in beginning reading. 

(12) Development of a variety of methods of word attack was 
the aim in developing independence in word recognition. The use of 
a process of discovery to teach phonics, and training in auditory 
and visual analysis were characteristics of the methods.

(13) Controlled vocabularies were common devices for providing 
for limiting word load and for meaningful repetitions. This and 
other controls regarding the structure of the sentence and stories 
increased the readability of the materials and obviated the necess¬ 
ity of using the isolated drills which formerly were supposed to 
provide the repetition and practice required to remember the words 
but which had seriously distorted normal reading processes. 

(14) Much experience with easy and varied reading materials 
provided the necessary practice in reading. 

(15) Heading began with wholes rather than parts. Initial ex¬ 
periences were with stories and ideas. Word analysis and synthesis 
followed the initial experiences in learning to read by wholes. 

(16) A developmental sequence in learning was established. 

The initial period of learning to read was continuous with both 
the readiness and the succeeding periods. 

(17) Instruction was adapted to pupil needs and to individual 
differences in learning. 

Various approaches, teaching methods and emphasis were employed 
in using eclectic methods in the first grade. However, irrespective 
of the method of approach or the area of emphasis, there were certain 
fundamental essentials that were generally provided for the adequate 
development of skill in reading. 

Tinker* s (1950) listing of the teaching jobs that should be 
considered essential in beginning reading was typical of such lists: 

(1) Development of readiness for reading. 

(2) Acquisition of a satisfactory stock of sight words.

(3) Development of word meanings. 

(4) Development of word identification and recognition tech¬ 
niques. 

(5) Introduction to reading. (The essential thing here was 

to employ a procedure which led to learning what words say. Correct 
matching of sight and sound is necessary in the development of real 
reading). 

(6) Transition to book reading. 

(7) Development of independence in choice and use of books. 

(3) Constant evaluation of reading progress. (Tinker, 1952, 

pp. 33, 84). 

The following are descriptions by educators of several inter¬ 
pretations of this composite method. The materials that implemented 
this method were the new basal readers described in the next section 
of this cheap ter. 

Smith (1934, P* 219) claimed that the method of approach used 
in beginning reading in the early 1930 f s had never been more varied. 
An analysis of methods of approach recommended in the manuals of 
eight of the outstanding readers revealed the following procedures: 

(1) Heading stories composed by the children. 

(2) Reading and carrying out direction-stories. 

(3) Dramatizing storie s. 

(4) Learning and reading rhymes. 

(5) Reading from a prepared chart. 

The unit of approach advocated also showed variation. There was 
no case in which such small units as letters or words were used in 
introducing the child to reading. A complete story, a small thought, 
and a combination of sentences, phrases and words were the three types 
of introductory units most frequently employed.

Anderson and Dearborn (1952, pp. 253, 259) reported on a 
survey of 238 successful teachers who were asked to specify the 
units they used to introduce their pupils to reading. Sentences 
were used by 61.9 per cent, short paragraphs by 33*7 per cent and 
phrases, words or letters of the alphabet by 44 per cent. This 
was recorded in a report entitled "Better Reading Instruction." (1935)• 
Russell (1944) found strong backing for the sentence method, alone 
or in combination with other methods. These findings bear out Smith’s 
statement regarding the variability of methods used. 

Dolch (1941)> in his directive on methods of teaching, summar¬ 
ized his description of first methods of teaching reading with this 
statement: 

In the very beginning, a number of methods are used to 
teach children that word symbols have meaning, to increase 
perceptual readiness, and to lead to word-recognition. 

(Dolch, 1941, P. 105). 

Dolch suggested that children’s names, labels, action words, 
picture labels, committee names, directions, bulletin boards, announce¬ 
ments, class newspapers, word games and picture-word cards were useful 
devices with which to accomplish this. Experience charts, in his 
opinion, might precede any other method or might continue parallel 
with other methods. Some of the purposes they might accomplish would 
be the development of school and language readiness, of perceptual 
readiness, of interest in reading and of good habits of attention. 

They are not sufficient to develop a sight vocabulary because of the 
tremendous rate at which they are bound to introduce new words in 
view of the wide subject matter they cover. The first book was usually 
preceded by charts and therefore read with ease.

Dolch (1941, pp. 134-171) described in detail how the teacher 
proceeded to get the children into the story by having them recall 
experiences of their own, to discuss the pictures and to guide the 
reading of the story. Different methods for re-reading and oral 
reading were described and methods the teacher would use to help 
a child to analyze a word he didn*t know. Emphasis was placed 
on silent reading before oral, on requiring good comprehension at 
all times, on building a background of concepts and meanings, on 
language participation in the lesson, and on encouraging thoughtful 
interpretation. 

Betts (1946) stated that modern reading instruction was based 
on a combination of methods which varied from an outright basal- 
reader approach to an all-out experience, or interest approach. 

In between these two extremes were a variety of practices combining 
the two approaches. Of these he considered the basal-reader approach 
to be the most widely used. (Betts, 1946, p. 386) . He recommended 
the use of the experience approach as one that produced superior 
results. 

McKee (1943, pp. 203-230) described certain definite teaching 
and learning activities carried on in the first grade. Building 
the initial sight vocabulary could be accomplished through the use 
of the sight method and three kinds of materials which included: 

(l) the commercially prepared pre-primer, (2) experience charts and 
(3) miscellaneous home-made selections. McKee recommended that, in 
view of the advantages and disadvantages of each of these types of 
materials, beginning work in building the initial sight vocabulary

should be carried out through the use of a first pre-primer and 
certain homemade materials which included pupil* s names, action 
words, short labels and short signs. This re comm end rat ion assumed 
that the use of the preprimer and suitable miscellaneous home-made 
materials would be accompanied by the use of well-constructed 
workbooks and home-made exercises which would provide the experience 
and practice essential to the thorough identification of 'words and 
necessary for learning to recognise these words readily. 

Adams, Gray and Reese (1949> pp. 177, 178) suggested using 
experience records in the readiness period and introducing the first 
pre-primer as soon as the children were ready to read. Through a 
combination of picture reading and silent and oral re ding the 
children were guided to interpret the story. A variety of proced¬ 
ures were used to assist the child in interpreting ideas and in 
identifying sentences and words. Questions directed the child*s 
attention and suggested purposes for reading. Sometimes the teacher 
would read aloud the identifying sentences while the children followed 
in their books. Sometimes she would call upon a child to reread the 
sentence orally. If, previously, the teacher had utilized the 
vocabulary of the first story in several experience chart stories 
it would be possible for the children to read the first story wrfti 
appropriate guidance. The words were presented in meaningful con¬ 
text and the presentation checked before the reading of the story. 
Various kinds of mimeographed assignment sheets and the workbooks 
provided for many repetitions of the word in directions and exercises 
and afforded practice in specific reading skills.

Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 100-106) described a method of 
teaching reading which was a well organized composite of all other 
methods. It was a modified, purposeful method, which used as 
techniques (within the larger more fundamental instruction for 
reading) such devices as analytical word-recognition techniques, 
experience charts, oral study and many silent reading situations. 
Although the teacher needs a diversification of method to suit the 
problem at hand at any specific time, Bond and Wagner considered 
it most effective to have the instruction fundamentally that of 
purposeful topical reading. At the same time the other methods 
were used as teaching techniques to solve the problems and to avoid 
the dangers that would be inherent if only this purposeful approach 
were used. The following fundamental steps were employed: 

(1) Teacher preparation of the unit. This involved accumulating 
materials to kindle interest, to explore community resources and to 
assemble reading materials and formulate her plan of procedure. 

(2) The development of readiness. This helped to develop 
interest, a background of knowledge and vocabulary. Pictures, sound 
films and film strips were often useful in this step. 

(3) Pupil-teacher planning. This step developed purposes, 
raised problems and charted directions and plans. 

(4) Background reading. This was necessary before the class 
organization could be decided upon. This reading could well be 
done in the basic reader by one group and in supplementary books 
by others. 

(5) Further planning. This formulated in greater detail the

direct procedure, formed sub-groups and divided the class into 
committees, each to assume responsibility for some specific group 
of information. 

(6) Guidance by the teacher. Here the teacher anticipated 
difficulties and taught necessary skills, helped select suitable 
materials and suggested efficient ways of proceeding. 

(7) Cooperative and individual reading and discussions. The 
children pursued their tasks systematically and intelligently be¬ 
cause interest had been aroused, their purposes were real and vital, 
they knew how to proceed, they understood the organization, each 
had accepted responsibility for his task and they knew that what 
they produced would be used in a cooperative venture. 

(8) Culminating the experience. Making use of the results of 
their efforts was satisfying to the learner. The essential habit 
of making practical application of what had been read was developed. 
This culminating experience encouraged accuracy in interpretation 
and demonstrated the meaningfulness of the reading act. It furnished 
opportunity for rereading in the case of inconsistencies and dis¬ 
agreements and thereby encouraged critical reading. It was a nat¬ 
ural expression of the type of material that had been read and 
allowed for expression of the purposes pursued. It necessitated 
reasonable organization and encouraged generalization which is the 
goal of much scientific reading. 

(9) Evaluation of the reading experience. This was made by 
both teacher and pupils and was made throughout the progress of the 
experience as well as after its culmination.

Instruction that approximated this description fostered desir¬ 
able reading growth in all areas. The teacher used many different 
methods for teaching throughout the activity. The blackboard list¬ 
ings of the results of pupil-teacher planning were experience charts. 
Much of the material was read in a non-oral fashion. During dis¬ 
cussion pupils quoted and read orally from their books. Oral read¬ 
ing was involved in the culmination. Word recognition techniques. 
Including visual and phonetic analysis, were taught during the 
teacher* s supervision and guidance of the reading. All the reading 
had been directed toward well-defined purposes. 

All phases of the program had functioned in the experience. 

The unit stemmed from the basic reading program of the larger 
middle group of the children. The extended program of reading was 
that done by the committees in the exploration of their problems. 

The personal reading was stimulated through expanded interests and 
direct contact with material which the child pursued by himself. 

The teacher,liberated from listening to children read,had time to 
give special help to those in need of it. 

This method was better adapted to children who had learned to 
read than to those beginning to read. It, nevertheless, illustrated 
the essence of composite methods in practice. In a very elementary 
way it could be used to relate beginning reading and the use of books 
to the activities of the daily program. 

Anderson and Dearborn (1952, p. 294), after pointing out the 
strengths and "weaknesses of all the conventional methods of teaching 
reading, made the suggestion that reading might best be taught by

a combination of methods. They showed how all the methods might 
enter into a balanced program. 

The start can perhaps be most advantageously made with 
the experience-reading method. The experience method serves 
the functions of the story and sentence methods. These 
functions include (l) transmitting the idea of reading, 

(2) developing a thought-getting attitude as a first step in 
reading and (3) arousing interest in reading. The pupils are 
next introduced to their pre-primers. The vocabulary of the 
pre-primer was usually taught by the word method. The use of 
the word method at this point will serve to check the habit 
of memory reading which is associated with experience reading, 
and to launch the children on the road to oral reading. The 
alphabet and phonetic methods are next called into action to 
promote skill in word analysis. These methods serve to count¬ 
eract the inaccuracy which characterised learning to read by 
the word method, and they will also help the children gain 
independence in word recognition. Quick recognition drills 
are often useful at this point to keep the pupils from be¬ 
coming too analytical in their word recognition. Many of the 
children will now be reading word by word. The phrase method 
is brought into play at this juncture to combat that problem. 
(Anderson and Dearborn, 1952, p. 294) • 

Anderson and Dearborn showed in this 1952 publication how a 
combination of methods could provide balance in the program. Each 
separate method could be used to counteract the bad effects of other 
methods, and could make its own special contribution toward develop¬ 
ing skilful reading. 

Tinker (1952, pp. 104-113) recommended that the child be intro¬ 
duced to reeding through a balanced program which made use of a well 
coordinated combination of homemade materials,such as script text, 
labels, notices and bulletins, experience units with charts and pre- 
primers. This coordination he considered to be achieved best ty 
avoiding any overemphasis upon a single approach by recognizing the 
limitations and by capitalizing on the advantages offered by each 


kind of material

When the proper stage of readiness had been achieved teaching 
was organized for associating specific printed symbols with specific 
meanings that were already represented in the oral language patterns 
of the child. Thus,the beginnings of a sight vocahulary were acquired 
through the recognition of certain word forms. Then there could be 
progress to the reading of short sentences and stories. 

Tinker stressed the importance of the accurate matching of 
the visual word form with the sound of the spoken word. This was 
essential in the association of printed symbols with meaning. This 
substitution of printed symbols for oral symbols represented a 
first step in learning to read. Devices found effective in this 
initial exposure to reading were the use of children’s names and 
other labels, the use of action words and various word games and 
the use of simple directions and announcements on the blackboard 
or bulletin board. Through these the children gradually acquired 
a recognition vocabulary of sight words that could be used later in 
reading activities. In establishing the relations between print, 
language and experience,Tinker considered it essential that comprehen¬ 
sion be emphasized. The mere memorizing of the sounds involved in 
pronouncing the printed word would lead to word calling and would 
become a handicap to effective progress in learning to read. 

The transition from these initial reading activities to the 
reading of experience charts or books occurred naturally and eff¬ 
ectively. The use of experience charts became an integral part of 
reading instruction. Used alone,they were inadequate for developing 
the necessary sight vocabulary but, along with other methods, they

provided training in language development and group cooperation as 
well as valuable training in visual discrimination. 

Methods of using charts and basic readers varied. Some teachers 
depended mainly on experience charts. Others adhered to the use 
of a basic series of readers. Usually, however, a compromise was 
reached between the experience approach and the use of the basic 
reader series. Sometimes topical units were employed but never to 
the point of replacing basic instruction. The key note, according 
to Tinker, was versatility on the part of the teacher in adjusting 
instruction to pupil's abilities and needs. 

Yoakam (1955, p* 39) suggested that, in the development of 
basic reading abilities, it seemed wiser to use certain ideas from 
each of the approaches advocated. The experience approach oould 
be used in combination with the basal reader approach and both 
supplemented with topical or unit experiences in reading. Differ¬ 
entiation of instruction and materials td meet the needs of the 
pupils would be provided. Use would be made of visual aids that 
seem likely to aid the child in learning to read. Excessive emphasis 
upon oral reading should be guarded against but it would be unlikely 
that the non-oral method of teaching beginning reading would be 
adopted exclusively. Here again a composite or eclectic approach 
was advocated. 

Hildreth (1953, pp. 196-193) stated that authorities in the 
teaching of reading today recommended a series of steps for beginning 
lessons, somewhat as follows: 

Step I: Have the child respond to words representing familiar 
ideas and expressions. His name, a simple sentence about a picture,

his own description of an immediate experience, or something he 
has said are expressions that will serve this purpose. Total 
ideas expressed simply were the first materials used. Meanings 
were dlarified through preliminary activities employing the words, 
seeing the words and sentences they made up placed below pictures, 
discussing what was read and dramatizing. Rereading was done at 
frequent intervals to confirm habits. No effort in beginning 
lessons was made to drill on words till they were known by heart. 
Learning words, like learning names and faces, came gradually as 
the result of cumulative experience. With this introduction the 
child saw the purpose of what he was doing and sensed the meaning 
of ”reading to oneself.” 

Step II: Centre the child 1 s attention on fixing separate 
words in mind with checks and drills. The child should not spell 
or sound the words but he should say them, in a natural way. 

Step Ills Have the child read to himself - ”look and think” - 
in place of reading aloud. This was a variant to the oral response 
of ”talking to the print.” In silent reading the child was instructed 
not to make an audible oral response but to show the part that tells 
a certain thing without naming the words aloud. This, Hildreth con¬ 
sidered to be the essence of reading for meaning. 

Step IV: Have the child examine the parts of words to say and 
see recurring parts and the sounds that words contain. The beginner 
does this when he identifies parts of his name in new words or sees 
the relation between ”round” and ”found”, ”big« and ”dig”, or sees 
the word ”pump” in ”pumpkin.” Although there is no drill on the

separate sound elements, at this stage, the incidental discovery 
of these similarities between words is encouraged because it lays 
the foundation for sounding or phonics in reading. 

Many activities expand and provide practices in the reading 
skills. Daily response in sentence-story reading, with checks on 
words and meanings, strengthens habits. Daily practice with mater¬ 
ials that repeat a small vocabulary strengthens skill in word recog¬ 
nition. Some examples of these are: Chart-reading, v look-and-say 11 
reading in easy picture story books, reading aloud to others, 
improvising dramatizations of the stories, pronouncing words by 
parts, playing anagrams, copying and writing easy words, pasting 
words under pictures, playing word-matching games, checking exercises 
in Yrorkbooks and lesson sheets and telling little stories for his 
mother or his teacher to write down. 

These experiences pity/ide rich and varied forms of learning and 
practice. Materials include script text (hand-lettered chart 
materials) simple story books, booklets, beginning reader units, 
group lessons in basal readers, accompanying Yrorkbooks, various 
drill devices, reading lessons with film strips and various combin¬ 
ations of these. This composite-eclectic approach Hildreth set forth 
as a desirable method, of teaching beginning reading. 

The combined experience-book approach is, according to Burton 
(1956, p. 229), probably the most widely used method of initial 
reading instruction today. The chief feature of the combined app¬ 
roach was that children were introduced to printed materials somewhat 
more quickly than in t he experience approach, but were provided with

more preliminary preparatory activities than in the direct 
hook approach. 

The first step was to help children build up background 
for reading by having them talk about certain previous experiences, 
or carry on an appropriate activity related to the content of the 
story to be read in the book. These preliminary measures helped 
to pave the way for meaningful reading. 

The second step was to help the children learn to identify 
the new words in the story and, if necessary, to develop suitable 
concepts for the words. Specific suggestions were usually provided 
in teaching guides accompanying the basal readers. A favorite 
method was to print on the blackboard a preliminary story devised 
for the purpose of embodying the new ?/ords and concepts. The 
children read the stoiy, identified the new words, and demonstrated 
an understanding of the meanings. 

The third step was to encourage children to set up their own 
goals for reading the story in the book. They read the title, 
looked at the pictures and discussed what they hoped the story would 
tell. To itensify interest,questions were printed on the blackboard 
for discussion after the story had been read. The children were 
encouraged to set up their own goals for reading. This not only 
helped them to become interested in the story about to be read, but 
also to form permanent attitudes favorable to reading. 

The procedures outlined above are those followed in the first 
steps of most basic lessons in the modem reading series.

Combined methods have been used for decades. Huey (1912, 

P* 275) >after describing the separate methods,found them to be 
n mixed, in endless combinations." Stone (1950, pp. 27, 28) stated 
that a combination of the word method, the phrase and sentence 
method, and phonics was probably the plan most commonly used for a 
decade preceedingthe introduction of the story method about 1910. 
Composite methods came into general use in the 1930* s. Smith (1934) 
considered that the approach used in beginning reading in that day 
had never been more varied. Hildreth (1936) said that, in modern 
schools of that period, there was less adherence to a single method 
and more tendency toward flexibility in methods and varied instructional 
procedures. Today Gray (1956) considers modern methods to be "eclectic." 
New basic readers as well as the texts on the teaching of reading 
emphasize this composite approach. 

The reports in the Yearbooks of the National Society for the 
Study of Education show how this method became established. 

In the Thirty-sixth Yearbook Gray (1937, pp. 23-38) stated 
that the place of reading in the curriculum had greatly expanded 
and the content and materials of teaching pupils to read had improved 
rapidly. Reading had acquired broader relationships than formerly 
in both child and adult life. The aims of reading must now provide 
for promoting clear understanding, developing habits of good thinking, 
stimulating broad interests, cultivating appreciation and establishing 
stable personalities.

The results of scientific studies have developed a clearer 
understanding of the nature of reading end of the basic processes 
involved. The facts presented in these studies showed that reading 
is a varied and highly complex process. In order to provide 
adequately for the needs of child and adult life, the definition 
of reading adopted by the Committee included not only the processes 
involved in recognition and comprehension but also those involved 
in interpretation and application. The analysis of types of reading 
in which persons engaged,both in and out of schools, showed that 
reading assumed different forms and that it varied with the reader* s 
general attitude, with the specific purposes for reading and with 
the kind of material read. In view of this understanding of reading 
as a varied and highly complex process it followed that the task 
of teaching reading could not be considered a simple one. 

The changing conception of reading from the one of reading as 
a process of recognizing printed or written symbols to a much more 
inclusive idea of reading, influenced methods of instruction. The 
newer conception assumed that reading involved not only the recognition 
of the essential facts or ideas presented but the reflection on their 
significance, criteral evaluation of them, the discovery of the 
relationships between them and clarification of the reader* s under¬ 
standing of the ideas apprehended. The Yearbook Committee believed 
that any conception of reading that failed to include reflection, 
critical evaluation, and the clarification of meaning was inadequate. 

In setting forth this broad use of the term the committee recognized 
that this implied that reading included much that psychologists and 
educators have commonly called thinking•

Inherent in this definition is the conception that reading is 
also a form of experience that modifies personality. 

This Yearbook Committee recommended that the total program 
of activities in beginning reading should utilize the advantages 
of both the experience activity approach and the basic reader 
approach. It defined progress in learning to read in terms of 
the achievement of successive goals of early instruction in 
reading. Three such goals were identified and used as guides in 
organizing and evaluating the methods and techniques used in 
attaining them: 

(1) Ability to read with keen interest and understanding the 
simple records of experience and the simple printed booklets of 

the pre-primer type. 

(2) Ability to engage in continuous meaningful reading from 
simple books such as those of primer difficulty. 

(3) Ability to read books of average first reader difficulty 
with keen interest and absorption in content, and growth of interest 
in reading independently. 

A statement of their procedure recommended is contained in ti e 
following quotation: 

The Yearbook Committee recognize that each of the fore¬ 
going approaches has its advantages and limitations. It rec¬ 
ommends that the total program of activities provided should 
utilize the advantages of both procedures. At times reading 
materials based upon experience should be employed in order 
to gain as full benefit as possible from the values that attach 
to the use of immediate interests, pupil planning, and symbols 
with which vivid meanings may be associated. To an increasing 
extent, however, as pupils learn to read, use should be made 
of books the content of which is sequential, that are skillfully 
prepared with respect to word frequency and distribution,^and 
that provide opportunity for varying amounts of practice in 
h ar mony with individual needs. (Gray, 1937, p. 91) •

Hildreth, in the Forty-eighth Yearbook of the N.S.S.E., 
described methods of beginning reading as follows: 

Teachers use different methods of handling beginning 
reading, depending upon the size of class they have to work 
with and the requirements of the school program. Some 
teachers begin soon after the opening of school with the 
large readiness charts and story books of a modern basic 
reading series and continue with the books of the series as 
the chief dependence in reading instruction. Other teachers 
work with the class divided into groups, beginning with script 
text at the blackboard and on large paper. The easy books of 
a basic series are soon introduced and their use is continued 
parallel with the blackboard end chart-writing. Others begin 
reading with script text and continue throughout the year with 
this material based on current experiences. By the time the 
simplest reader units are introduced, the children have already 
learned the basic vocabulary and with only a little help can 
easily read the units of the first bock. (Hildreth, 1949, p. 72) 

The composite-eclectic methods were based on the need to 
attain broader objectives in reading than could be achieved through 
use of the more highly specialized methods. Methods of encouraging 
a thoughtful reading attitude and a clear grasp of meaning and 
methods of developing skill in word recognition were combined. Only 
through the combination of methods in this eclectic fashion could 
the broadened objectives of reading be attained. 

The major strengths of the composite-eclectic methods of be¬ 
ginning reading instruction as indicated in the preceding discussion 
are as follows: 

(1) The different objectives that can be attained and the 
various skills that can be developed through these methods provide 
for a broader and better balanced reading program. 

(2) Individual differences can be provided for more adequately 
when different approaches are used. 

(3) Thoughtful interpretation and a variety of word recognition 
skills can both be emphasized.

(4) A clearer truer concept of the reading process, its 
nature and functions, can be developed from the beginning. 

(5) While interest, function and interpretation are 
stressed, provision is also made for developing basic reading 
skills. 

(6) The weaknesses of any one method can be counteracted 
through the use of a balancing method. 

(7) A positive linking of reading and writing was achieved. 

The major weaknesses of the composite-eclectic approach are 

these: 

(1) Considerable technical skill is required to organize and 
conduct as complex a program as the method involves. 

(2) Some definite system and sequence must be established or 
continuity will be broken and a haphazard program reBult. 

(3) Most teachers need constant and specific guidance in the 
conduct of a program so complex. The guidebooks to the new basal 
readers attempt to do this very thoroughly and specifically. They 
provide the necessary direction for the teacher to be able to use 
the materials as they were designed to be used. 

The main contribution of the composite-eclectic approach is 
the solution it provides for overcoming the weaknesses of all 
more highly specialized methods. It makes possible the provision 
of a balanced reading program and the achievement of the broadened 
objectives of reading instruction today.

THE INTRINSIC METHOD 

This method was first described by Gates (1925)• It was a 
method of teaching phonics as an integral or natural process of 
reading. It consisted of a type of organization of a reading 
situation which guided the pupil to react in a desired way while 
his efforts were directed to accurate interpretation and a normal 
enjoyment of the content. An illustration of the use of this 
"intrinsic device" for the teaching of phonics was described some¬ 
what as follows: The technical purpose of the activities was to 
lead pupils to observe closely certain characteristic parts of 
words and gradually to become aware of certain elements common to 
many different word forms. The method of the supplementary device 
for phonics teaching was illustrated by the traditional phonetic 
drill in analyzing and blending word parts as a special exercise. 

The method of the intrinsic device would use such exercises as the 
following: 

(1) The pupil reads a series of directions which tell how to 
color an outline drawing, e.g.. 

Color the cat blue. 

Color the hat black. 

Color the coat brown. 

(2) After reading a short story the pupils solve such comprehen¬ 
sion problems as the following: 

Who got most of the milk? The rat. 

The cat. 

The bat.

(3) Solve such puzzles as the following: 

I am made of iron. 

I can make a sweet sound. 

I live in every school. 

I call the children to church. 

What am I? A cell? 

A bell? 

A doll? (Gates, 1928, p. 28). 

Such exercises wire not separated from useful reading since 
they provided a helpful means of increasing comprehension. They 
also added to the enjoyment of reading and stimulated a desirable 
attitude toward it. It was the arrangement of the task that re¬ 
quired the child to distinguish carefully between similar words 
and threw into relief the common elements. In this way the teaching 
of word perception was intrinsic. 

This method was described in detail in the last three chapters 
of New Methods in Prim ar y Beading (Gates, 1928, pp. 160-230). It 
was illustrated in the course in beginning reading in the Work-Play 
Series of readers by Gates and Huber (1930). 

A brief description of the recommended composite reading method 
which incorporated these ideas into its procedures was given by 
Gates as follows: 

The method which we have found to be the most successful 
in trials with beginning individuals and small groups includes 
many of the desirable features with few of the handicaps found 
in each of the several traditional devices. The work begins 
with a few words which may be readily arranged into phrases, 
sentences and paragraphs. The larger units are introduced as 
soon as the pupil is able to handle them without undue difficulty, 
and confusion. There is no necessity for a long period devoted 
exclusively to reading words. After the pupil has learned a

few words - on the third day in the materials to be 
described presently - he is able without much difficulty 
to read phrases and sentences composed of these words. In 
the first week he may be introduced to all the types of 
reading matter - words, phrases, senterces, paragraphs, 
stories, and other compositions. The method, then, introduces 
in the first week every type of material: it is, in this 
sense, not a word, sentence, or story method exclusively but 
a composite of these. 

This method selects the word as the first unit of percep¬ 
tion. The pupil first learns to recognize several words. He 
is able to read a phrase and sentence and even a whole paragraph 
almost at once because he can read the component words. He 
cannot at the beginning perceive larger units as wholes and 
does not need to. It is futile to insist that he do so. The 
perception of the more complex units comes gradually. As per¬ 
ception of whole phrases becomes useful, provision for its 
development is made. As sharper discrimination becomes advis¬ 
able, provision is also ms.de for the more refined perception 
of the first words, bjr the introduction of an increasing number 
of words with which they may be confused. Sentences and parag¬ 
raphs introduced at the earliest moment that they can really 
be read, also begin as simple types which are gradually developed 
into more complex forms. Nevertheless, the pupil is able from 
almost the first day to begin training designed to develop 
gradually all types of words mastery and perception, snd all 
varieties of comprehension that are eventually needed. His 
progress is to be gradual, however, while he proceeds to engage 
in a variety of reading activities that are useful and at the 
same time enjoyable. (Gates, 1928, pp. 198-199)• 

The materials used in the initial lessons were: 

1. Word-Picture Cards for introducing the first few words. 

2. A Word-Picture Dictionary containing the words used in 
the materials for the first half year. 


3. A Work Book containing exercises for word, phrase, sentence, 
and paragraph comprehension and for developing skills in word mastery. 

4. A Reading Book containing abundant stories, poems, and 
other materials for free silent and oral reading. 

Reading systems using the intrinsic method in 1936 were the

Reading systems incorporating the method into their word 
recognition programs ere the new basal readers listed in the next 
chapter. 

Gates (1928) motivated by the two convictions (a) that most 
reading difficulties had their genesis in the work of the first 
year, and (b) that most of these deficiencies might be prevented 
by improved methods of teaching, undertook a number of investigations 
of materials and methods for teaching beginners to read. The results 
of these studies formed the basis for his publication New Me thods 
in Primary Reading (1928) in which he set forth his new intrinsic 
method of teaching. The new procedures and materials he recommended 
were not, he claimed, the results of ideas in mind before research 
and appraisal were begun in 1918. They were developed gradually 
during the ten years devoted to the investigations and were based 
on findings revealed during the investigations. 

The investigations were carried out in the hope of securing 
suggestions for the improvement of methods of teaching beginning 
reading. These studies were directed to both phases of the initial 
stages of training in reading: the development of thought getting 
and the development of word mastery. In addition to the report on 
his own two studies,Gates reviewed the investigations made previously 
to survey the ways in which word, forms were analyzed and perceiveo..

Many of the sources used were summarized by Gray in his Summary 
of Investigations Relating to Reading . Two representative studies 
of young children* s first efforts to learn words under difficult 
types of teaching and with different types of material were A 
Study of Initial Stages in Readin g by Pre-School Children by Gates 
and Boeker (1923) and A Study of Learning and Retention in Young 
Children by Meek. 

In addition to case studies, the analysis of the visual 
and phonetic characteristics of a pupil’s reading vocabulary found 
in the publication on New Methods in Primary Reading . Gates con¬ 
sulted the earlier special diagnostic analyses he had made. These 
included publications on ’’The Psychology of Reading and Spelling" 
(1922), "The General and Specific Effects of Training in Reading with 
Observation of Words" (1924), "The Functions of Flash Card Exercises 
in Reading" (1925) and "A Study of the Role of Visual Perception, In¬ 
telligence, and Certain Associated Processes in Reading and Spelling" 
(1926). In addition to his own observation and tests of represent¬ 
ative school groups under experimental control for long periods, 

Gates (192S) consulted previous studies by Gates, Batchelder and 
Betzner (1926) of "A Modern Systematic Versus an Opportunistic 
Method of Teaching." "An Experimental Study of the Beginning 
Reading of Deaf-Muted* (Thompson, 1927), "Methods and Theories of 
Learning to Spell Tested by Studies of Deaf Children" (Gates, 1926) 
and "Methods and Theories of Teaching the Deaf to Read" (Gates, 

1925) also contributed to Gates* conclusions. He analyzed the 
studies of methods adapted by children in their first lessons in

learning to recognize words to note the basis of perception. 

Minute characteristics of words, general configuration, ident¬ 
ification and naming of single letters, phonetic translation of 
letters, phonetic translation of phonograms, larger phonograms 
and. syllables, syllabication, visual analysis and use of context 
were all considered as methods of word-perception. Gates* conclusion 
was that each type of perceptive attack was of service under certain 
conditions and for certain words. No single method appeared to be 
sufficient for all the demands of word perception. It seemed that 
to be highly competent, a pupil must have acquired all methods of 
word-form study as well as facility in utilizing the context and 
a considerable skill in choosing the technique to fit each part¬ 
icular need. (Gates, 192S, pp. 22, 23). Gates* purpose was to 
discover just which combination of techniques and what degree of 
adroitness in their use might be required. 

As a result of the experimental studies these main general 
convictions emerged: 

1. Accuracy, fluency, and fullness of comprehension 
and enjoyment of reading for the thought are the main 
objectives of teaching reading. 

2. Comprehension is not a single unitary skill; it 
embraces a variety of more or less specific skills. 

3. Certain skills in reacting to word-forms are the 
necessary prerequisites of accuracy, fluency and fullness 
of comprehension. 

4. The development of the various comprehension skills 
and the several types of word-form mastery should not be 
left to fortuity but should be definitely provided for in the 
course of instruction. 

5. The training for comprehension and for word mastery 
should be unified, not separated into two projects.

On the basis of these principles Gates (1928, p. 3) developed 
his intrinsic method of teaching reading. He maintained that the 
accuracy facility and fullness of comprehension, which were the 
main objectives of reading, were closely dependent upon the way 
in which pupils were led to react to words. Any method which 
neglected either the skills in comprehension or word mastery, 
leaving them to develop incidentally, was an unsatisfactory one. 
Methods which treated word mastery separately from comprehension 
skills also proved to be deficient in several important points. 

The best method, according to Gates 1 observations, was the method 
in which training in word perception was made, as far as possible, 
an intrinsic phase of comprehension. 

The essential feature of Gates* intrinsic method of develop¬ 
ing the various word perception skills was that these abilities 
were developed as far as possible by means of the mechanical arrange¬ 
ment of the material used in reading and in comprehension exercises. 
Instead of keeping the training for thought-getting and word mastery 
incidental or extrinsic to one another the two were combined so that 
the instruction for word mastery was an intrinsic phase of comprehen¬ 
sion exercises. The materials were so arranged as to facilitate 
the perception of total configurations and the various types of 
significant word parts, such as frequently appearing syllables, 
phonograms of different lengths, and so on, and the most unusual 
combination of letters which are the distinctive features of words. 
The materials were so arranged to throw into relief, in a form 
which facilitated perception,, both the common and the distinctive

characteristics of words. From continued practice on such materials 
the pupil learned to identify certain common elements, and acquired 
the habit of seeing both the familiar and the distinctive features 
of a. word. In these exercises, however, the pupil* s main interest, 
was not in the study of barren word-forms but in the comprehension 
of some form of printed materials. In all cases, therefore, the 
pupil was encouraged or required to utilize context clues simultan¬ 
eously with the observation of word-form characteristics. 

Stone (1936) reported that the intrinsic method was first 
described at the meeting of the National Society for the Study of 
Education in February, 1926, when the report of the National Reading 
Committee was presented. Dr. Gates made a vigorous attack upon the 
typical method which required much non-intrinsic supplementary practice. 
In place of this formal and. wasteful supplementary practice Gates 
advocated the intrinsic plan. Stone considered Smith*s method 
developed in Detroit and illustrated in the Picture Story Reading 
Lessons (1924), to contain the essential elements of the Gates* 
intrinsic method and to be a forerunner of the Gates* plan. 

Reading Series by Gates (1930), Stone (1932) and Smith (1935) were 
based on the intrinsic method. Smith (1934, p. 221) recognized 
the intrinsic method advocated by Gates and Huber as the most 
abrupt departure in phonetic procedure at that time. Smith pointed 
out later (Smith, 1934? p. 276) that the whole topic of phonetics 
was in a state of controversy. Russell (1949, p. 210) suggested 
that the reaction against phonics which began in the 1920? s may 
have been hastened by the study of Gates which set forth the values

of the 11 intrinsic" method rather than the "phonic" method. Many 
teachers and supervisors took the study as a complete indictment 
of the phonics method - which it was not. Nevertheless, the 1930*s 
saw a complete reaction against phonics and Gates' intrinsic method 
was not popularized. Many of the main characteristics of the intrin¬ 
sic method were evident in the new plans for developing word-recog¬ 
nition which became popular in the 1940's. Although the intrinsic 
method as such was not revived its influence was felt in those new 
reader series which emphasized the new functional phonics. 

Basically, this method of developing word recognition was in 
accord with the general principles of eclectic methods. These gen¬ 
eral. principles directed procedure as follows: 

(1) Phonetic analysis would be introduced gradually and 
naturally in connection with reading activities. 

(2) Elements like beginning consonants would be brought to 
children's attention after they had mastered sight vocabulary and 
after they had learned to use context clues. 

(3) Then uses of beginning consonant sounds and context clues 
would be combined and habituated. 

(4) Then would begin the complex structure of further phonetic 
skills which were needed to assure independence of word recognition. 

According to Kottmeyer (1945, P* 189), Gates* intrinsic method 
applied these principles as follows: 

(1) It presented words in carefully planned settings so that 
content clues c^uld easily be used. 

(2) It conditioned children for their basal reading activities 
by preparatory activities which introduced new words slowly.

reviewed them, drew attention to distinguishing features of word 
form and stimulated interest in the subject dealt with in the 
reading text. 

(3) It incorporated phonetic elements into the word perception 
program by the use of poems, rhymes and jingles for noting word 
endings, by word-picture dictionaries for word beginnings, by 
comprehension exercises in which multiple-choice answers required 
careful phonetic discrimination. 

The intrinsic method was an attempt to clarify the place of 
phonics in the program. Those who advocated this ne thod claimed 
that psychology did not recommend either a complete abolition of 
everything in the nature of devices for teaching phonics or a 
return to an exclusive use of a direct trial-and-error attack 
upon reading, in a strictly "natural way." The incidental method 
of teaching had, in the past, proved to be largely "accidental" 
teaching. The limitations of tl©natural method, that is, of 
unguided learning, were too great to be neglected. The use of 
the devices of the intrinsic method had certain functional values 
and practical advantages over the supplementary devices of the 
traditional phonetic systems. 

Not all of the recent books on reading methodology refer to 
this intrinsic method of teaching. Gates, Stone, Kottmeyer and 
Hildreth comment on its strengths and weaknesses.

Gates (1925) pointed out seven advantages that these intrinsic 
devices had over the separate supplementary drill: 

1. They saved time since no time is taken from genuine 
reading activity. 

2. They introduced the particular skill desired into the 
actual reading process. 

3. They greatly reduced the risk of loss through failure of 
transfer. 

4- They usually made possible an easy and accurate check on 
errors. 

5. They introduced no obviously unnatural drills, as do many 
supplementary exercises • 

6. They were typically more interesting than the isolated 
formal drills. 

7. They brought about more fruitful returns as the theory 
indicated they should. 

Gates (1928) claimed that several crucial tests which he 
described demonstrated this advantage. 

Stone (1936) stated that while Gates preferred to depend 
entirely upon intrinsic methods, most authorities on methods-and 
most reader manuals,favored the non-intrinsic as well as the 
intrinsic instruction for independence in word recognition. Stone 
had serious doubts that the devices described and illustrated by 
Gates would provide adequate special instruction for fluency, 
accuracy and independence in word recognition. Nevertheless, Stone 
conceded that intrinsic instruction was important, that skills which 
functioned together in reading must be exercised together in the

specialized training and that specialized instruction should be 
largely intrinsic. 

Kottmeyer (1945) identified the intrinsic method as an 
eclectic method of teaching word recognition. It lay between two 
extremes. The ideational approaches, which emphasized a direct 
connection between the printed symbol and the thought or idea re¬ 
presented by it, concentrated on the development of a basic sight 
vocabulary by means of whole-word patterns in meaningful, purpose¬ 
ful context. These "look-and-say* methods, while undeniably per¬ 
forming a necessaiy function in developing this basic sight vocab¬ 
ulary felled, on the whole, to develop the necessary word attack 
skills. The phono-analytical methods, which stressed the intermed¬ 
iate step from symbol to sound to idea, had many variations and 
included extremely elaborate and mechanistic methods of isolated 
word drill. Although these methods too had much to contribute to 
a versatile method of word perception, Kottmeyer found it difficult 
to understand how artificial isolation of words from context, mean¬ 
ingless linguistic drills, and rejection of children 1 s interests, 
could be seriously considered effective in reading instruction. 

The eclectic methods which introduced phonetic analysis gradually 
and naturally in connection with reading activities, as described 
by Gates in his intrinsic method, combined certain features of the 
other two and struck a balance between the two extremes. 

Hildreth (1958, p. 341) commented on the intrinsic method 
in her discussion on the advantages of "whole word sounding." She 
pointed out that young children were interested primarily in the

meanings words have for them. The intrinsic method, she considered, 
made full use of the child* s interest in the words that he knew 
and understood. The result was a simplification of methods and 
materials. The intrinsic method avoided the reed for two sets of 
lessons, - reading and phonics. 

The strengths of the intrinsic method can be summarized as 
follows: 

(1) It emphasized comprehension at the same time th.it it 
drew attention to word forms. This unified and unifying approach 
was the method* s greatest strength. 

(2) Its intrinsic devices led the pupil to observe words 
closely in meaningful content and to become aware of certain 
common elements in different word forms. 

(3) It added to the child* s enjoyment and interest in reading 
and stimulated a desirable attitude tov/ard it. 

(4) It was a composite method incorporating the strengths 
of several methods and the balancing effect of combining them. 

(5) It emphasized the whole process of reading right from the 
beginning. It introduced many different types of material and the 
variety of comprehension and word mastery skills need in reading 
them. 

(6) It emphasized that all exercises should help to develop 
reading as a functional process. 

(7) It emphasized and drew attention to the close relationship 
between comprehension and word mastery. Certain skills in reacting 
to word-forms are necessary prerequisites to comprehension.

(8) It pointed out the need to teach specific skills in 
word recognition. Gates* investigation indicated clearly the 
necessity for this. 

(9) It was in agreement with the principles of the eclectic 
methods. 

(10) It presented words in carefully planned settings so that 
context clues could easily be used. 

(11) It provided for gradual introduction and planned review 
of words in contextual settings. 

(12) It provided a natural approach to drill in that it intro¬ 
duced each particular skill into the actual reading process so that 
it functioned in its natural setting from the beginning. The skills 
that functioned together in reading 'were exercised together. 

(13) It simplified methods and materials and saved time because 
it avoided the need for two sets of lessons - phonic and reading. 

(14) It contributed considerable information about the charact¬ 
eristics of words and the specific skills required to be able to 
recognize them. 

The weaknesses of the method were mainly these: 

(l) It required a great deal of work in preparing the intrinsic 
devices. To be successful and practical it was. better incorporated 
into a reading series in a very systematic fashion. It required clear 
understanding of word structure, of word elements, of vocabulary 
selection and its control in order to prepare tne materials. Tnis 
prerequisite made the planning of the program a job for specialists. 
The method could not be followed casually with any success.

(2) It was incomplete. Story element and interest value 
must be supplied from sources other than the intrinsic devices. 

The main contribution of the intrinsic method was the emphasis 
it placed on unifying the approach to the development of both 
comprehension and v/ord-recognition skills. This drew attention to 
the close relation sir ip that existed between comprehension and word 
mastery. The attention directed to the specific skills that must 
be developed and the illustrations of how skills that functioned 
together could be exercised together had a valuable contribution 
to make to future methods. 

In conclusion it must be noted that the intrinsic method did 
not flourish during the years following its introduction. This 
may have been the result of other strong influences in reading at 
that time or it may have been because of the internal problems 
involved in constructing materials to implement the method. Sub¬ 
sequent vocabulary studies and techniques in vocabulary control 
might have helped clarify the problems. When the new basal readers 
of the 1940* s were introduced the functional phonic programs of 
these series illustrated many of the characteristics of the intrin¬ 


sic method.

METHODS OF THE NEW BASAL READERS 

The basal reader approach entailed the use of commercially 
prepared materials which dictated more or less the procedure to 
be followed when using the texts in teaching reading. Usually 
several authors collaborate to provide a text-book series with 
a broader viewpoint. Those who prepared the materials for the 
series were classroom teachers, psychologists and reading spec¬ 
ialists working under the leadership of recognized authorities 
on the teaching of reading. One or more readers were supplied 
for each level. The readers had accompanying .guides for the 
teacher and workbooks for the children. 

Accessories in the form of "big books" which are like large 
charts of the first few pages of the first pre-primers, word, 
phrase, and sentence cards, pocket card holders, and pictures to 
illustrate word meanings were among the most common accompaniments 
to the series. The less formal methods place less reliance upon 
such accessories than did the formal programs. They subordinated 
the use of these charts and other printed equipment in order to 
capitalize on the interests that children displayed in the class¬ 
rooms, entailing the preparation of homemade accessories. 

The different types of reading materials usually supplied for 
the beginning reading period were as follows: 

a. Preprimers. Some publishers offered as many as three pre- 
primers. 

b. A ast of word cards to accompany the preprimers, to be used 
in presenting new words instead of writing them on the blackboard.

c. A pocket card holder for displaying word cards. 

d. A workbook to accompany preprimers. 

e. A teacher 1 s manual or guidebook to accompany preprimers. 

f. A large picture and story book to use with the preprimers. 

The preprimers were usually, though not always, paper covered 

books. The first prepriraers had almost full page pictures with a 
very small .amount of reading material. Much use was made of the 
pictures in building a background and in understanding and develop¬ 
ing a reading vocabulary. The pictures carried most of the story 
action while the text recorded the conversation of the story character 
The first reading was as much "picture" reading as it was reading of 
the print. Reading vocabulary was developed very slowly and each 
new word was given repetition after it was presented. Each succeeding 
preprimer used the words presented in the preceding preprimers, grad¬ 
ually adding new words. 

Samples of the text from two of the new basal preprimers are 
included here: 

The following is the text of the first story in the first Pre- 
Primer, We Lo o k and See of the Curriculum Foundation Series:

vocabulary to three words. The other stories in the books are about 
Jane, Baby, Spot, Puff, Tim, Tim and Spot, Up and Down, Puff and

The next stories are entitled Jack, Janet, Find the Ball and 
Play Ball. The prepriraer contains 64 pages and uses a vocabulary 
of 20 words in its stories. 

The workbook gave practice in reading the materials in a new 
setting apart from the book, provided reviews, and aided in develop¬ 
ing the word study program. It provided practice in reading as a 
thinking activity. It provided skill-building activities which 
allowed children to learn to read by reading. Each page in the 
workbook was designed to provide practice in specific reading skills. 
Directions to the teacher for its use were printed on the page for 
the cover of the book. The pages were to be used after certain 
stories had been read because they used the new words introduced in 
that particular story and provided practice in the skills developed 
in the related practice sections of the reading lesson outlined for 
that stoiy in the guidebook. The workbooks were to be used for diag¬ 
nostic as well as developmental purposes. Individual pupil needs 
could be analyzed in detail, since the work required individual 
responses and the results illustrated the child’s understanding of 
the material. 

Workbook exercises emphasized thinking and the application of 
specific skills. 

The index of the skills to be developed through the exercises 
in the My Do an d Le arn Book to accompany the three preprimers of the 
Ginn Basic Readers included the following:

The directions to the teacher were printed in small type 
along the inside margin of the book. They were as follows: 

To the Teacher. Use: With pages 11-14, We Look and See. 
Aim: To emphasize the meaning of the word and and give 
practice in recognizing the printed symbol,: to increase 
ability to interpret descriptive text by associating pictures 
with it. 

Directions: Read the line under the first picture to the 
children, emphasizing the word and . Tell the children to read 
the first line under each picture, then to read the two below 
it and draw a line under the one that is just like it. The 
broken line in the first example should be traced as a model. 


The guidebooks or manuals that accompanied the readers contained 
detailed directions for the use of the reader and the workbook and 
for procedures in teaching. A plan for the procedure in each lesson 
was outlined in steps. Objectives of the program, general principles 
basic to the methods U3ed and supplementary materials were al v so 
included in these manuals.

Each manual that accompanied a basic reader suggested a fund¬ 
amental plan of using the readers in directed-reading activities. 
Russell suggested the following as essentially the kind of plan 
to be found in different manuals: 

A. Objectives for the lesson 

1. In relation to the theme of the unit 

2. In terms of skills, habits,and attitudes. 

B. Developing readiness for reading 

1. Through a check on adequate background of experiences 

2. Through the development of a meaningful vocabulary 

or concepts 

3. Through the stimulation of interest and setting up of 

worthy reading purposes 

C. Guiding the first silent (or survey) reading 

1. To stimulate interest in the selection 

2. To develop understanding of the whole 

3. To develop the habit of reading for a purpose 

4. To promote versatility in approaching selections for 

different purposes 

5. To foster understanding of sequence and organization 

6. To discover words, concepts, and larger ideas which 

require further study 

D. Rereading activities with the book 

1. To prepare for some worth-while activity based on the 

selection, such as story-telling, dramatization, 
finding an interesting word, discovering a well-liked 
character, and answering questions 

2. To develop word-recognition abilities through the use 

of accurate perception, picture clues, context clues, 
phonetic analysis, and related techniques 

3. To increase comprehension of important ideas in words, 

sentences, paragraphs, or complete selections 

4. To give practice in oral, silent, or audience reading, 

as needed by the group 

5. To help the individual child as time allows 

E. Related reading activities 

1. Use of charts, blackboards, workbooks, and teacher- 
prepared materials related to the content of the 
selection 

Evaluation of pupils* progress by means of observations, 
informal tests, word games, and the reading of related 
materials

F. Enrichment activities 

1. Following up certain activities begun under D1 

2. Encouraging discussion, organization of ideas, crit¬ 

ical thinking about the materials, further reading 
of an independent and research nature, and other 
language activities 

3 * Using reading in planning construction, excursions, 
dramatic play, and other art activities, 

(Russell, 1949, pp. 109, 110) 


Adams, Gray and Reese (1949, pp. 
typical lesson plan the purposes each 
in terms of the child needs it met: 

CHILD NEEDS 

The child needs: to be inter¬ 
ested in the content of the story 
to be read; a background of under¬ 
standing; and a double command of 
the vocabulary, that is, power to 
recognize and to understand the 
meaning of the new words he will 
meet in the story. 


The child needs: to read the 
story for a purpose - to find out 
something for himself; to think 
about what he reads; to talk to 
others concerning ideas encoun¬ 
tered in the stoiy or touched off 
by it; to grow in self-reliance 
through finding answers for him¬ 
self and judging their validity. 


133, 134 ) showed in this 
step was designed to accomplish 


LESSON STEP I 

To meet these needs the teacher 
provides a lesson step known as 
the Prepa r ation for Reading . The 
teacher writes the new words from 
the story on the blackboard; 
through discussion and the display 
of pictures, etc., she helps the 
children to understand new word 
meanings. Following this there is 
a brief Vocabulary Check . This 
entire step forms part of the 
Motivation , since it arouses the 
children* s curiosity in the story 
to be read. 

LESSON STEP II 

These needs are provided for 
in the lesson step known as the 
Guided Reading . To help the child¬ 
ren to make a more organized 
attack on print and thus improve 
comprehension and retention, the 
teacher asks a Major Motivating 
Question ?<foich requires the read¬ 
ing of the entire story to answer. 
She asks minor guiding questions 
about essential points in the story 
or selection. The children read 
silently to find the part they think 
answers each question. After a 
child has read the pertinent part, 
first silently and then orally, the 
other children decide if it is the 
right choice. Many opportunities

CHILD NEEDS 

The child needs: opportunities 
to interpret ideas he has gained in 
reading, and to evaluate the story 
in terms of his own experience; 
practice in expressing himself 
aptly and in listening with good 
attention while others talk. 


The child may need to reread 
the story to refresh his memory, 
to settle a point, to get ready a 
dramatization, etc. 

The child needs; opportunity to 
practice what he has learned - to 
work exercises containing new 
vocabulary in order to fix it and 
make it a permanent possession; 
extra practice in employing read¬ 
ing skills introduced in the lesson 
proper. 


The child needs: an opportunity 
to make correlations between his 
reading work and other activities 
of life, both in school and out. 

In other words, he needs to 
develop the habit of linking 
ideas gained in reading with 
action. Reading should be apprec¬ 
iated as contributing to his 
personal development. 


are provided for interchange of 
opinion. At the conclusion of 
the guided reading, the motivat¬ 
ing question is answered. 

LESSON STEP III 

These language and social needs 
are provided for in that part of the 
lesson known as Group Interpretation . 
After a story has been read, the 
children discuss whether or not they 
enjoyed it; the suitability of the 
title to the action; the story* s 
resemblance to others or to real 
life, etc. 

LESSON STEP IV 
Rereading meets these needs. 


This necessary review is pro¬ 
vided for in that part of the lesson 
known as the Related Drill. The 
teacher may take the entire group 
for various types of word drills, 
including phonetic and structural 
analysis, at the blackboard or 
chart, or she may assign individual 
work for individual practice, using 
mimeographed, bectographed, or 
Commercially prepared work sheets 
or workbooks. 

LESSON STEP V 

This form of experience re¬ 
ceives attention in that part of the 
lesson known as the Extension, 
Enrichment or Follow-up Activities. 

If the children read a selection 
about a frog in the basic reader, 
the teacher will do well to provide 
other stories or poems and songs 
about frogs to extend and enrich 
the child*s experience. If the child¬ 
ren have enjoyed a humorous story, 
they may be encouraged to draw or 
paint the pent they enjoyed most, etc.

Methods of the new basal readers varied somewhat in the details 
of their application but they had these characteristics in common: 

(1) The content of the beginning books for the initial stage 
of instruction was closely related to children 1 s environment and 
experience, 

(2) The vocabulary was carefully selected and controlled. The 
words were selected from those commonly spoken by children up to and 
including the age of six years on the basis of their usefulness as 
service words in writing the stories and on their interest value. 
Limiting the number of new words to be introduced on a page and con¬ 
trolling the frequency of their repetition provided a natural kind of 
repetition for practice and did away with the need for artificial 
drill devices. The many vocabulary studies of the 1930* s provided 
the impetus for this vocabulary control. Significant studies were 
presented and reviewed by Stone (1936) (1950), Gates (1930) and 
Hebei (1938) and Dolch (1955)* The trend toward simplification of 
vocabulary in beginning books in reader series that began in the 
late 1920* s continued, so that the number of words in the new basal 
books is much smaller than formerly. 

(3) The mechanical features of the books were carefully controlled 
for readability. Paper, type-size, length of line, leading, spacing 
and size of book all meet certain standards based on the results of 
numerous investigations and studies of readibility af printed materials. 
(Buckingham, 1931). Illustrations are intended to clarify concepts 

and arouse interest. In beginning books (preprimers) they carry much 
of the story action while the printed text records only the conversation

of the story characters. These pictures were usually brightly col¬ 
ored, were full-page or half-page and appeared on every page of the 
preprimers. 

(4) Workbooks were provided to accompany each book. These 
practice books were for pupil use and provided for the application 
of the reading skills taught. The teacher used them as diagnostic 
as well as developmental instruments. These workbooks took the 
place of much of the prepared seat work devices of former periods. 

(5) Manuals accompanied each book of the series. They del¬ 
ineated objectives, principles and procedures in teaching reading 
and provided a lesson plan for using each selection in the reader. 

The teachers* manuals or guide books accompanying the series 
were a vital and necessary part of it. The advice given by Hildreth 
(1936) was typical of the attitude of educators on the use of guides: 

Teachers are advised to make full use of the manuals 
accompanying the basic series which give suggestions for deriv¬ 
ing the greatest value from the books. Failure to use materials 
as the authors intended may destroy much of the value inherent 
in carefully prepared series of readers. (Hildreth, 1936, p. 73) • 

(6) Plans for using each selection in the reader formed a 
large part of the content of the manuals. These lesson plans in 
each series followed fundamental steps in procedure which put into 
practice the teaching principles basic to the reading method. 

(7) The skill-building section in each reading lesson and the 
workbooks provided practice in the development of the necessaiy skills. 
An index of these skills and abilities to be developed was usually 
supplied. An analysis of this index shows how provision was made 

for continuous, sequential development of specific skills and abilities. 
(Gray, 1940, p. 443) (Ginn, 1943, pp. 360, 361).

(8) The growth of fundamental reading habits was emphasized 
in instruction and provided for in the mechanical features of the 
reader and in the directions given for guiding of the children*s 
reading in the books, 

(9) Development of a meaningful sight vocabulary was an 
important part of the method. Words were carefully selected, in¬ 
troduced in context and repeated in different context to emphasize 
meaning associations. Practice techniques provided for the vivid 
association of meaning with word forms and repetitions of these in 
context provided for remembering the word form in association with 
its meaning. 

(10) A program to develop word-recognition techniques was an 
integral part of the basal reading program. A variety of techniques 
for word recognition were taught with phonics as one of them. The 
method of teaching phonetics and structural elements was analytical. 

The pupils were guided to discover the phonetic relationships and 
principles through analysis of words in the sight vocabulary. These 
understandings once developed were applied immediately in figuring 
out new words. In this way phonetics became a functional word-attack 
skill from the beginning. 

(11) Thoughtful interpretation of the printed material was 
stressed from the beginning. The child was expected to read "to 
find out", to think about the content and to react to it in the first 
reading lessons. Reading was expected to be meaningful and purpose¬ 
ful - a thoughtful process - from the initial -stages. 

(12) Both silent and oral reading were stressed but silent reading 
was done before the oral reading. Reading itself was considered to

be a silent process, the oral reading which > too, was a valuable 
activity was interpretative and involved re-reading for a different 
purpose. It was not involved in the first process of finding out 
what the printed matter told. 

(13) The approach to reading in the new basal series was a 
composite one involving elements of the look-say, sentence, story, 
experience and phonics methods, and using each when it would achieve 
the desired objectives. 

The methods of the new basal readers are exemplified in a 
number of series published in. the 1940* s. Among these series are 
the followings

The Learning to Read Series by Nila Banton Smith (1945) 

The New Basic Readers by Gray and others (1947)

The use of a basic reader for beginning instruction in reading 
goes back to colonial times when McGuffey* s Readers held sway as 
the main instrument for the teaching of reading. Since then many 
well known series have been printed and widely used. It was only 
after the experiments with the experience approach to reading that 
the use of basal readers became distinguished as a separate method 
of teaching reading. During the period of educational reform that 
characterized the early 1930*s a reaction against school readers and

systematic basal instruction set in* The reading retardation and 
disability revealed to be present in the schools during the 1930*s 
again directed attention back to basal reading instruction. The 
new basal reading programs that developed in the 1940* s were greatly 
improved in content and method as a result of new demands dictated 
by psychology and new techniques developed by research. 

Stone (1950, p. 93) counted 1930 as the year in which there 
first appeared a series of readers satisfactory from the point of 
view of vocabulary control. The general tendency had been to in¬ 
troduce words more gradually and to provide more books in the primary 
series. In 1921 Parker reported that ten first readers, then in 
wide use, had a total of 3,541 different words, counting all forms of 
each word. In 1930 Wheeler and Howell found that ten first readers, 
then in wide use, had a total of 2,061 words counting all variants, 
except plurals in s, as separate words. The ten primers studied had 
a combined vocabulary of 1,139 words. In 1934> Aline E. Gross re¬ 
ported a study of ten preprimers revealing a combined vocabulary of 
593 words, counting all forms separately except the singular possess¬ 
ive. This was in a total of 8,331 words of reading material. Re¬ 
duction in vocabulary load and introduction of primers and pre-primers 
appeared to be the trend. 

This change for the better Stone (1950) credited to the research 
studies of the vocabularies of primary readers, to the construction 
of standard word lists for primary reading and to the demand for 
simpler reading material level by level with the vocabulary care¬ 
fully controlled. The recent common practice of having two or more

preprimers in a series of primary readers further aided vocabulary 
control. An orderly plan of introducing words gradually and allowing 
for many repetitions characterized these newer basic reading series. 

That the basal reader approach was a recognized method in wide 
use is evident from the comments of educators of different periods. 
Stone (1936), in his chapter entitled "Road to Better Beginning Book 
Reading," described at least twelve basic series in use at that time. 
In the Thirty-3ixth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study 
of Education, Gray (1937) reported that, although teachers are in 
general agreement that the early activities provided should introduce 
pupils to reading as a thought-getting process, they differed on the 
best method of accomplishing this. Some believed that this can be 
best achieved through the so-called "experience-activity" approach. 
Others definitely preferred the use of commercially-prepared materials. 
Nevertheless, the basic reader appeared to be recognized as one of 
the two popular approaches to beginning reading at that time. Betts 
(1946) accorded the basal readers the position of "the most widely 
used approach." Hildreth (1949) regarded the basic readers as "a 
tool for giving pupils systematic training in reading habits." 

Yoakam (1955) claimed that "in spite of the fact that many schools 
have experimented with the experience approach to reading, the 
great majority of schools still use the basic reader approach." 

There are published today at least twenty major basic reader series, 
a list of which appeared in the early parts of this chapter.

The theory behind the basal reader approach is n that children 
must be taught to read by daily systematic lessons gradually in¬ 
creasing in difficulty” and that ”the best way to present this 
material to children is in the form of carefully graded readers”• 
(Yoakam, 1955? p. 1)• This idea is in direct opposition to the 
fundamental principles of the experience approach, which attempts 
to free the child from the textbook. The obvious differences be¬ 
tween the two methods set the traditional ”basal reader” instruction 
apart as a separate type of approach. 

The basal readers have evolved as a result of many different 
emphases and reactions to extremes in methods of instruction. With 
each new emphasis readers have taken on a different character. Each 
new force has led to changes and, in the long run, improvements in 
basal reading materials and methods. The swing from wholly oral 
to wholly silent has given rise to the prevailing belief in a 
balance between oral and silent reading. The extremes in the 
teaching of word recognition have resulted in a ”whole-part-whole” 
method. Emphases on the mechanics of reading and extreme mechanical 
methods of teaching have served to point out the necessity of 
emphasizing reading for meaning from the first. The modern school 
reader reflects the current knowledge of the reading process and 
the enlarged concept of the function of reading in the educational 
process. 

Comments by educators on the use of basic readers for initial 
reading indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the method.

Of the educators who comment on these values and limitations 
some are practitioners in the field as well as commentators. These 
specialists have fundamentally affected beginning instruction in 
reading through their editorial and practical contribution to a 
basic reading series. Several notable examples of such authorities 
are Betts, Bond, Gates, Gray, Hildreth, McKee, Russell, Smith, 

Stone, Yoakam, and Witty. 

Generally educators concede that the basal reader approach is 
the most widely used in schools today. Uhl (1937, p. 210), Betts 
(1946, pp. 386-388), Tinker (1952, pp. 117-119), Gray (1956, pp. 

89, 90) and Stewart (1957, pp. 51-56) made statements to this 
effect. The high degree of technical skill which goes into the 
construction of the basic series is recognized by Gray (1937, p. 90), 
Uhl (1937, p. 210), Stone (1936), Hildreth (1949, pp. 77, 78), 

Russell (1949, pp. 104-110), Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 196, 197) 
and others. That the basic reader is an effective tool for instruction 
if properly used is the general consensus of opinion of reading author¬ 
ities. Great stress is placed upon the intelligent use of the series, 
Stewart states this succinctly in the following quotation: 

We must remember; the basal reader is merely a tool. 

The carpenter has a tool that he calls a hammer. He uses it 
when he builds a house. If he is skilled in its use, he 
will build a strong house. Hammers are used to build ordin¬ 
ary houses and extra-special houses. Strong, fast carpenters 
do their work with the same kinds of hammers used by smaller, 
slower carpenters; both kinds of carpenters build houses. 
Carpenters never live in hammers. Pupils cannot live in basic 
readers. (Stewart, 1957, pp. 55, 56). 

The value of the sequential plan which provides continuity 
in the development of skills and greatly reduces the chance for

“gaps in learning” is stressed by Gray (1936, p. 90), Russell 
(1947), Hildreth (1949, pp. 77, 73), Whipple (1949, pp. 147- 
171), Bond and Wagner (1950, pp. 196, 197), Tinker (1952, pp. 
117-119) and Yoakam (1955, pp. 7, 8). In addition, the advant¬ 
ages of the carefully-controlled vocabulary, child-like language, 
interesting stories and content based on children* s common inter¬ 
ests and experiences, are pointed out by McKee (1948, p. 216). 
Hildreth (1949) adds to these valuable features the good illus¬ 
trations and readiness activities. 

The values of guides and workbooks, and a warning regarding 
the dangers of misusing these useful materials for instruction, 
are pointed out clearly by Dresden (1957, pp. 75-78), Thompson 
(1957, pp. 71-74), Niederman (1957, pp. 57-60) and Stewart (1957, 
pp. 51-56). The need to select these books carefully, to under¬ 
stand them and their purposes and to use them creatively and 
imaginatively is stressed. Educators, generally, recognize the 
danger of routine, formal, inflexible procedures. The resultant 
loss of freedom and the stifling of initiative in teachers and 
children, when rigid interpretations are put on method, is an ever¬ 
present danger. 

Although Russell (1949, 1947) commends these books as care¬ 
fully written for gradation, variety, organization and content, he 
considers them only part of the whole reading program. Betts 
(1946, pp. 336-333), Burton (1956, p. 217) and others concur with 
him in suggesting that other materials and approaches to beginning

reading must be used as well. Stewart (1957, pp. 55, 56) points 
out that the basal reader method was not designed to exclude all 
other methods and maintains that, although the basic reader is 
"the surest thing we have," it is not the only way to teach read¬ 
ing. He further claims that the "best" series had not yet been 
published and commends the keen competition among publishers to 
produce better manuals and improved reading materials. 

Criticisms arose from the dangers involved in the vocabul¬ 
ary control of these commercially-prepared materials. Pennell 
(1933, pp. 29$-297) considered that, when too few words were 
used, meaning might be so limited that reading would become little 
more than the recognition of familiar words. She questioned the 
many repetitions of some words, suggesting that these words did 
not always require so much repetition and that "rediscovery" of 
the word might be better than "dragging in" the word merely to 
provide for repetition. Betts (1946, pp. 336-338} criticized the 
common practice of using pictures to carry the main burden of the 
story. The resultant restriction on content in the text built up 
of three or four words made it dull and uninteresting.

Many strengths have been attributed to this method by 
these and other educators; Some of the main strengths are summ¬ 
arized as follows: 

1. It provided scientifically constructed materials and a 
skilfully organized program for teaching. A high degree of tech¬ 
nical skill went into the controlling of the vocabulary, the 
planning of sequences and the careful construction of the stories 
and exercises. At no previous time had materials and method been 
perfected to such a degree. 

2. It provided the teacher with a sequential plan for the 
systematic development of basic reading skills. The basal series 
was a tool for giving pupils systematic training in reading. The 
sequential grading of the units and levels of the books in respect 
to vocabulary and content provided a program that was truly develop¬ 
mental. Careful grading provided continuity of experience and 
growth in skills, habits and attitudes. 

3. It minimized the possibility of "gaps” in learning exper¬ 
iences through the provision of this sequential plan. 

4. It organized a pattern for developing abilities and for 
teaching different ways of reading which showed the relationship 
between these skills and their uses. 

5. It provided a wide variety of materials on the assumption 
that children had to read many different kinds of material for many 
different purposes. 

6. It greatly eased the load on the teacher through providing 
many materials to work with - readiness activities, prepared exer¬ 
cises, and detailed guidebooks - to aid in teaching.

7. It recognized the maturing reading proficiences of 
children and encouraged the unfolding of abilities and develop¬ 
ing of reading vocabulary and skills without undue strain and 
hazard. The unnecessary hazard of the uncontrolled vocabulary 
was one obstacle to easy growth that was removed. It provided 
for stable continuous growth in reading. 

3. It minimized, through its eclectic approach, the possib¬ 
ility of the weaknesses resulting from overemphasis on one method 
of approach. 

9. It always reflected current theories concerning educational 
method. Publishers competed to meet the demands of teachers and 
the needs of children. 

10. It focused attention almost wholly on reading. Such con¬ 
centration of attention hastened growth. 

11. It constituted a core of reading activities to which other 
activities could be related. 

12. It gave systematic, guided practice in skill development. 
Psychological data favors systematic development of skills. A 
natural order in building reading skills was developed. Natural 
repetition of words was secured through vocabulary control. Analyt¬ 
ical processes involved were natural processes in the setting of 
meaningful reading. It provided carefully worked out sequences by 
means of which these skills could be developed. Guidance and 
materials were provided for the orderly development of specific 
skills in comprehension and word recognition and these specific 


skills were tested.

13. It provided exercise for phonetic training that were 
intrinsic in nature. 

14- It interested learners and created favorable attitudes 
toward reading. The good illustrations and attractive story mater¬ 
ial interested children. The attractive style and colorful books 
provided both profit and enjoyment. The worthwhile content and 
stories selected for their intrinsic value and importance to 
children attracted them. 

15. It gave children satisfaction in the provision of his own 
book for each child to read. 

16. It provided interesting stories with a strong element of 
plot so that children could learn from the first to demand meaning 
and to like to read. 

17. It avoided meaning difficulties in the provision of stories 
about familiar experiences and ideas expressed in words or sentences 
which the child could understand if spoken to him. 

18. It reduced the vocabulary burden for children so that it 
was no obstacle to reading. The vocabulary was controlled so that 
a small number of words was introduced gradually with carefully 
distributed repetitions of each word provided. 

19. It used content close to children*s experiences so that 
early steps in reading would be meaningful, interesting, purposeful 
and challenging to children. 

20. It provided a varied, flexible program that could be adjusted 
to meet the needs of individuals. The multiple books,parallel 
readers and many supplementary materials provided for enrichment 

and extensive reading.

21. It used units around which the stories were organized to 
stimulate reading interests in a theme and to motivate children 
to read widely. 

22. It did not exclude the use of any other methods but 
could be used in connection with any other approach. 

The comments of authorities in reading suggest that the 
method has some weaknesses: 

1. It could become routine, formal and inflexible in the 
hands of some teachers. The hierarchy of skills,established 
could dominate and 11 lock” the procedure. 

2. It could, if interpreted rigidly and inflexibly, stifle 
both teacher and child initiative and freedom. 

3. It could so concentrate attention on the program of 
basic skill development that the purpose of learning was lost in 
the process. 

4. It could encourage emphasis on the teaching of reading 
rather than the teaching of the child. This interpretation enforced 
children to confom to a pattern rather than encouraging the 
teacher to study the individual child and provide for his needs. 

5. It was based on a graded system of instruction which 

in the hands of some teachers could be interpreted to mean rigid 
lock-step progress. The needs of individuals can be provided for 
through provision of different levels of a book in one grade. 

6. It tended to isolate the reading program from other 


classroom activities.

7. It may not provide for sll reading situations such as 
sign or map reading which are best taught through actual use of 
the various materials. 

8. It cannot provide material that would rela.te to the var¬ 
iable interests and abilities of all children. It is difficult to 
"know the interests and experiences of all children. 

9. It does not relate material to immediate interests of 
children. It cannot capitalize on current events and community 
environment. For these reasons it may not be as meaningful and 
purposeful as experience materials. 

10. It may,through the vocabulary control, limit meanings so 
that reading becomes little more than recognition of familar words. 
The content may be palid and dull and not of good style or quality. 
There is the danger of producing a "pale” primer. 

11. It ms.y depend so much oh the use of pictures to carry 
the burden of the story that the text consists of so few words that 
it is dull. 

12. It may repeat, words to the point where it effects content 
and style adversely. The number of repetitions provided may not 
be necessary to learn all words. 

13. It presents many difficulties and requires considerable 
skill to implement this method. Expert technicians are required to 
construct materials, select words and organize them to facilitate 


learning

The main contribution of the methods of the new basal readers 
is the scientifically constructed and skilfully organized instrum¬ 
ents they have provided for the development of basic reading skills* 
Teclinically they are superior to anything previously developed. 

Their scientifically developed readers, carefully designed workbooks 
and detailed and systematically organized guidebooks provide teachers 
with an abundance of materials and information to assist her in 
teaching* 

The basal reader method is the one in common use today. During 
the early 1950* s it was considered to be an effective solution to 
the problems of beginning reading instruction* Two points must 
be considered in evaluating it: 

(1) It is, at best, a useful tool for beginning reading in¬ 
struction* A tool can be used effectively or not, according to the 
purposes and skill of those who use it* 

(2) It was never intended to exclude the use of other methods. 
It provides merely a carefully organized systematized approach and 
practical materials with which to implement this. The effective 
use of these methods and materials depends on the teacher*

SUMMARY OF THE CHAPTER 

The methods described in this chapter were the most 
recent ones in 1950. They illustrated the broadened object¬ 
ives for the teaching of beginning reading and the varied and 
eclectic approaches that developed during the late 1930*s and 
1940*s. The methods used were composites of specialized 
methods previously used separately. In present reading systems 
it is difficult to distinguish between the three methods des¬ 
cribed. Basal readers are illustrations of both the composite- 
eclectic methods and the intrinsic devices for teaching phonics.

CHAPTER VIII 

REVIEW O F C HANGES AND TRENDS 
IN READING METHODOLOGY 

Throughout the thesis the history of the methods of instruct- 
tion from 1900 - 1950 has been presented. If this whole series of 
years is examined chronologically,it can be divided into four 
periods: 

(1) A Period of Specialised Methods from 1900 to 1913, 

(2) A Period of Silent Reading Emphasis from 1913 to 1925. 

(3) A Period of Broadened Objectives from 1925 to 1937. 

(4) A Period of Consolidating Gains from 1937 to 1949. 

In no period was any one method used exclusively but there 
were very definite changes in emphasis. The following list in¬ 
dicates the princiole changes that took place in each period. 

Changes during the Peri o d of Specialized Methods from 1900 to 
1913 

(1) Change from emphasis on word methods to the use of 
phonic systems to develop skill in word recognition. 

(2) Growing popularity, from 1910 to 1913, of sentence and 
story methods which introduced larger and more meaningful units of 
instruction and used a memory technique in learning to read. 

(3) Change from moralistic and nationalistic content to 
literary content for beginning readers.

Changes Du ring the Pe riod of S i lent Re ading Emp hasis from 1913 
to 1925 

(1) Silent reading methods replaced the phonic and story- 
method s, 

(2) A reaction to the use of oral reading methods set in* 

Some extremists advocated no- oral reading at all. 

(3) Content in readers became more factual and informative 
than literary* 

(4) New materials designed to teach silent reading were in¬ 
troduced. These were exercises, seat work, tests and other materials 
designed to check reading comprehension through requiring some re¬ 
action to the content. 

(5) The development of fundamental reading habits became an 
important job of the initial period of instruction. 

(6) The development of comprehension and speed in silent 
reading was considered more important than the teaching of word 
recognition and oral reading. 

(7) New purposes for reading were recognized as a result of 
the need to cope with greater amounts of reading material with 
speed and comprehension. 

Changes During th e Perio d of Broad e ned Objectives an d Eclectic 
Methods from 1925 to 1937 

This was the period between the publication of the Twenty- 
fourth and the Thirty-sixth Yearbooks on reading by the National 
Society for the Study of Education.

about an expansion in reading programs. 

(2) Methods of beginning instruction in reading had become 
more complex. Composite-eclectic approaches became popular. 

(3) Methods used at beginning stages were generally the 
"whole* 1 methods which used large units of instruction. Thi3 method 
was commonly called a "whole-part-whole" because, after the second 
stage of analysis to discover sound relationships and word structure, 
the practice was provided in meaningful context. 

(4) Great improvement had been made in methods of teaching 
reading to increase emphasis upon the meaning or content of what 
was read and in the elimination of much of the formal drill that 
had been required in the past. 

(5) Experience methods gained a foothold in this period. In 
many cases it was often the single method used. 

(6) The approach to reading generally tended to be more in¬ 
formal, natural, and casual than formerly. There was, in some areas, 
a reaction to systematic basal instruction. Textbooks had less place 
in the program generally. 

(7) The development of a sight vocabulary found a place, during 
this period, as one of the main jobs in beginning reading. The "look- 
say" method, often called the sight method, became popular for this 

pu rpose. 

(8) A reaction to the systematic teaching of phonics set in. 
Phonic programs were simplified and quite often, taught incidentally. 
Phonics had lost its dominant place in the reading program.

(9) The non-oral method of teaching beginning reading was 
introduced but it never gained a large following. It introduced 
into beginning reading a number of new device® for making the 
first meaningful associations with printed symbols. 

(10) Materials for reading were simplified. Readability 
studies and vocabulary studies had pointed the way to easier, voc¬ 
abulary controlled and generally more attractive, interesting and 
readable material. Careful grading of book content and vocabulary 
was practiced. 

(11) New materials were introduced into the basic reading 
series. The first pre-primers were introduced in 1929 and work¬ 
books (or work pads) about the same time. Teachers* manuals were 
gradually approaching the status of dignified, attractive and in¬ 
formative professional books. 

(12) Materials and methods had become more child-centred. 
Studies on childrens* interests in reading and, in addition, the 
emphasis on child growth in psychology had directed efforts toward 
the production of more child-like materials and methods that capit¬ 
alized on the child’s interests and his normal growth patterns. 

(13) Reading was gradually becoming related more closely to 
other school activities. Correlation with other activities was a 
common procedure and integration, in the experience-activity and 
more informal programs, was often achieved. Unit organization of 
story materials was becoming a feature of new readers. 

(14) Distinct progress had been made in both the theory and

practice of "reading readiness". Thi 3 had a very salutory effect 
on the pacing of instruction in reading. 

(15) Considerable progress was being made in adapting instruct¬ 
ion to provide for individual difference. 

Changes During the Period of Consolidating Gains from 1937 to 1949 

This was the period between the publication of the Thirty-sixth 
and the Forty-eighth Yearbooks of the National Society for the Study 
of Education on reading. 

(1) The emergence of a balanced program which used composite 
methods and eclectic approaches was the most notable characteristic 
of the period. 

(2) In this more balanced approach to reading the experience 
method found its place as a technique preparatory to book reading. 

An understanding of the values and the limitations in the use of 
this approach contributed to its effectiveness as a part of a comp¬ 
osite approach to beginning instruction. 

(3) The teaching of phonics became respectable. Durrell (1940), 
Betts (1946), Gates (1942), Gray (1943), McKee (1943) and Hildreth, 
Beery and McKee in the N.S.S.E. Yearbook (1949), established the 
place of phonics in the reading program as one technique for attack¬ 
ing new words. The principles and methods introduced by these educ¬ 
ators have been endorsed by, and incorporated into, the books on method¬ 
ology and the manuals to the basic reading series published currently. 

(4) Both silent and oral reading were used in the new eclectic 
methods. Silent reading always preceded oral reading in the guided 
reading lessons but oral reading for different purposes had a useful 
part to play in beginning reading.

(5) Basal reading programs became recognized as the found¬ 
ation experience in learning to read. The necessity for a system¬ 
atic program of basal reading instruction had been indicated by 
the bad practices in teaching that had developed during the years 
of the incidental, informal approach to reading and by the high 
incidence of remedial readers in the schools. 

(6) The high degree of technical skill and knowledge invested 
in the newer basal readers series brought them recognition as a very 
useful tool in the teaching bf reading. The new basal reading series 
provided the teachers with a scientifically planned, systematic and 
sequential program for the teaching of beginning reading and made 
available the materials with Tfoich to put it into operation. 

(7) Emphasis was placed on the development of a meaning vocab¬ 
ulary through introduction and practice of words in context and 
through providing a background of meaning for each new word. The 
importance of associating word symbols vividly with meanings was 
illustrated in all phases of beginning instruction in reading. 
Isolated word drills and extreme n look-3ay B techniques which tended 
to associate visual symbol only with the oral symbol for the word 
were disappearing from practice. 

(8) The emphasis on the relationship between reading and child 
development colored all aspects of beginning reading instruction. 
Materials were more child-like and appealing. Instruction was paced 
and planned to harmonize with the characteristics and developmental 
patterns of children. The child’s nature, needs, interests, and ab¬ 
ilities were a major influence in the organization and conduct of

the reading activities of this period. 

(9) During this peripd reading came to be considered one 
phase of a complex language program and the methods used illus¬ 
trate the relationship between the child 1 s language and exper¬ 
ience and his reading. Reading activities were carried out as an 
integral part of growth in language skills. 

TRENDS IN BEGINNING INSTRUCTION IN READING 

In many cases these changes have taken a general direction 
over the period of fifty years. It would appear that these trends 
may be classified under three headings: 

(1) Objectives 

(2) Methodology 

(3) Content and Materials 

Trends in Objec t ives 

From previous material in this chapter these aspects of the 
trends are discernible: 

(1) Broadening of Objectives 

The objectives of reading instruction are very closely related 
to the concept of the nature of the reading process and the social 
demands made on the reader. As the concepts of reading have changed 
so have the methods of instruction. During this period the concepts 
of reading have developed from the simple theory that reading was 
merely word recognition and pronunciation to the idea of reading as 
getting meaning from the printed page and, finally, to the concept 
of reading as experience. This last concept considers reaoing to

be a creative process involving all types of thinking, evaluating, 
judging,imagining, reasoning and problem-solving, Reading goes 
beyond mere word-recognition and comprehension to include the 
reader 1 s reaction to the content, and to the integration of the 
ideas gleaned from reading with his own experience, through some 
application or use of them. The more extensive the research on 
reading the more complex the process seems to be and the more var¬ 
ied and subtle the skills necessary for its effectiveness. As more 
varied purposes for reading were recognized the objectives for read¬ 
ing broadened. 

The purposes that reading serves in society also determine the 
objectives of reading instruction. When reading materials were 
scarce and few people could read, recognition and pronunciation of 
the words for oral reading to others served the needs of society. 

When comprehension became the purpose in reading,objectives changed 
accordingly. When reading became recognized as a necessary tool 
with which to gain information and,when the increase in the amount 
of reading to be done put a premium on 3peed as well as comprehension, 
utilitarian objectives were emphasized. When purposes for reading 
became more varied and complex, the objectives of reading broadened 
to meet the increasing demands made of it. 

(2) increasing emphasis on the association of meaning with printed 

symbols 

As reading became recognized as an interpretative process depend¬ 
ent on thinking the development of meaning associations rather than 
sound associations with printed symbols became a recognized objective.

(3) Recognizing the need to 3tress in i n struction the funct i oning 

of rea ding in life and its integration with experience 

Early reading instruction had isolated reading practice, making 
it an unnatural activity with no function in the child 1 s daily life 
and no relationship to his experience. The effort to make reading 
a functional and natural part of a child* s experience from the be¬ 
ginning of instruction is a pronounced trend in the later objectives 
for instruction. 

(4) Acknowledging the place and function of reading as an integral 

part of the language program 

Instead of treating reading as a separate subject in the program 
the later methods recognized its dependence on, and relationship to, 
the other language arts and tend to arrange instruction so that read¬ 
ing grows out of and contributes to other language activities. 

Trends in Methodology 

From an examination of the changes in the method used through¬ 
out the fifty year period these trends are apparent: 

(1) The use of composite-eclectic methods as opposed to specialized 

ones 

The early specialized methods proved too limited to achieve 
the broad objectives of the later programs. Used eclectically one 
method offset the weaknesses of another. The composite approach 
evolved in order to develop the variety of reading skills required. .

(2) The. use of whole-part-whole methods Instead of synthetic ones 

Early methods used a synthesized part-whole approach in that 
they proceeded from word elements to the word or story. The later 
methods start with the meaningful whole, proceed by analysis to dis¬ 
cover elements, and then provide practice in meaningful context. 

(3) The use of meaningful units instead of word elements 

Units used in the methods at the beginning of the century stressed 
word elements such as letters or sounds. Then larger units, such as 
words, sentences and stories, were used. In the later methods these 
larger units are used in beginning instruction but th^y are selected 
and presented so they have meaning for the child. Words are intro¬ 
duced in sentences that have meaning for the child. They are repeated 
in sentence aad story settings to provide practice and varied mean¬ 
ing associations. Sentence and story units are used from the begin¬ 
ning so that the child associates meaning with the words. 

(4) An attempt to maintain a balance of activities 

Extremes and the reactions to them have been a pattern through¬ 
out the history of reading instruction. A balanced position appears 
to have evolved from experience. The later programs provide a place 
for phonics, for both oral and silent reading, for both wo* d mastery 
and comprehension, and for both the experience and the basal reader 
approaches. 

(5) Emphasis on developing specific as well as general skills 

As the understanding of the complexity of the reading process

increased and as research and experience identified the specific 
skills involved in the various types of reading, instruction was 
designed more specifically to develop each of the separate abil¬ 
ities. This becomes apparent through an examination of the lists 
of skills and abilities to be developed that are included in the 
manuals of the more recent basic reader series. 

(6) Organizing instruction to utilize the available knowledge of 

how children grow and learn 

Early methods were more logical than psychological. Later 
methods take into consideration the child 1 s interests, his exper¬ 
ience, his normal growth patterns and the psychology of learning. 
Evidence of this trend can be found in the recent emphases on 
readiness, provision for individual differences, attention to 
child* s interests and experience, careful grading of material, em¬ 
phasis on meaningful practice and other such attempts to apply the 
laws of learning governing readiness,exercise and effect. 

(7) Basing techniques on the results of research and experimentation 

The extent to which educators refer to the results of experim¬ 
entation and research in their comments regarding methods and the 
quantity of research information accumulated indicate the value 
placed upon it. The interest in research became pronounced during 
the years of the First World War and has provided an ever-increasing 
body of knowledge since then. Changes in instruction, judging by 
the comments of educators, tend to be made more and more on the 
basis of the results of planned experimentation and the scientific 
analysis of experience.

Trends ir^ Content end Materi als 

An examination of the types of content end materials used 
throughout the period reveals these trends: 

(1) The use of a greater var iety of tea ching mate rials 

Early reading series used a single book. Today pre-primers, 
workbooks, manuals, charts and a variety of supplementary books 
and materials are available for the use of teachers. An examination 
of the lists of materials and teacher aids in recent educational 
publications vdll provide evidence of this trend. 

(2) The use of content based on c hildren 1 s in teres ts 

Early materials used, mainly, content that was didactic or lit¬ 
erary. Silent reading methods used informational materials. The 
experience method popularized materials based on children 1 s exper¬ 
ience. New basal readers consistently base content on children^ 
interests and experiences. 

(3) The use of related practice materials 

Material for practice in the early years consisted of artificial 
unnatural devices to repeat and drill on elements and words. Flash 
cards and seat work exercises were introduced during the emphasis 
on silent reading. Today practice materials use intrinsic devices 
for developing phonic skills and provide for practice through 
repetition of words in context related to the story theme. The 
child practices the skill through putting it into use in reading 
related materials which are designed to present problems involving 
the use of certain specific skills.

(4) The incorpo ration of phon ics Into the basic reeding program 
Phonics has become a functional part of the word recognition 

program; but not an exclusive method in the beginning instruction 
in reading. 

(5) The introdu ction jnd_ impro vement of the readability of materials 
Vocabulary control and the simplification of materials in 

order to make them more readable and to control the difficulty of 
the material has been a trend since the introduction of the first 
graded readers. This control has become gradually more pervasive 
and it now involves every aspect of the material - format of book, 
size of print, length of line, selection of vocabulary, introduction 
and repetition of words, style,and content. Controlling readability 
is an important part of the technique involved in preparing readers 
as instructional tools designed to develop skill gradually through 
their use in guided reading lessons. 

(6') The application of a high degree of t echnical knowledge and 
skill in the construction of m aterials 

As the concept of reading as an extremely complex process has 
evolved, as the objectives for reading have broadened, as the purposes 
and types of reading have become more varied, and as educators have 
come to realize the variety and subtlety of the different skills 
recuired in reading, the methods of teaching have increased in comp¬ 
lexity and variety. The materials necessary to implement such methods 
must he very carefully and scientifically constructed. Vocabulary 
control, writing worthwhile stories under these restrictions, weaving

a phonic program throughout the practice materials, end planning 
lessons to develop specific skills require a high degree of tech¬ 
nical skill and knowledge. Constructing reading materials to meet 
the needs of instruction today is a science and an art. 

These trends have developed slowly through the period and 
are continuing influences directing the course of beginning in¬ 
struction in reading. It is these developing trends in instruction 
that have determined the nature of modern approaches to beginning 
reading.

CHAPTER IX 

CONCLUSIONS 

From this study of the evolution of beginning instruction 
in reading over a period of fifty years there appear to be six 
pertinent conclusions: 

(l) Different methods achieve different results. Each method 
has advantages and limitations and no one method can achieve all 
the objectives of reading instruction today. Different methods em¬ 
phasize different aspects of reading and each starts the pupil on 
a different road to maturity. The method should be chosen for the 
results it is designed to achieve. If word recognition is the ob¬ 
jective then phonic or n look-say w methods would be useful; if oral 
reproduction of the page is required, then oral reading methods will 
suffice; if reading for speed and comprehension is desired, silent 
reading methods will be effective; if a didactic approach to literary 
appreciation and cultural objectives are par amount, then literary mat¬ 
erials and story-memory methods will have value; and if reading is 
intended to become a meaningful experience to the child the experience 
method has merit. If several or all of these objectives are to be 
achieved then the m-ethods known to achieve the desired results must be 
selected and combined into a composite-eclectic approach to instruction. 
It is impossible to determine which of the current methods of teaching 
reading is best without considering the objectives which the instruction 
is designed to achieve.

(2) Research in reading is becoming the basis for determining 
change* The background of knowledge of the nature and psychology 
of reading built up as a result of the experimentation and exper¬ 
ience over the past fifty years can aid in solving the problems of 
how to organize and pace the early stages of instruction in beginning 
reading. A scientific approach to the teaching of reading and a high 
degree of technical knowledge and skill are required for the construct¬ 
ion of new materials in order to implement the theories resulting 

from research ir modern reading programs. Recognition of the contrib¬ 
utions of educational research to changes in methodology is evident 
in the writings of the authorities in reading. 

(3) Changes in reading method based on these findings often 
develop very slowly. There are often great lags in time between 

the introduction of new ideas resulting from the findings of research 
and their utilization. Gates 1 intrinsic phonic method, set forth in 
1925, was not in popular use until the new techniques of reader con¬ 
struction incorporated them into new basic reading programs. The 
statements of method and objectives in the Twenty-fourth Yearbook 
are very much the same as those set forth today. According to Tinker 
(1952, p. S) the time lag between the type of reading instruction 
desirable in terms of current need.s and that which we get in actual 
practice is often as great as fifty years. 

(4) Changes in emphasis and materials in reading instruction 
have occurred frequently. Often there have been reactions to crit-. 
icisms of results. An open mind and an alert attitude must accompany 
the constant evaluation of methods and materials. Weaknesses should

be detected early and efforts made to remedy them. Burton (1956, 
p* 534) points out, as an example, the recent prompt reaction of 
educators to the criticism of the "namby-pamby, goody-goody" 
nature of the content in the basic readers for beginning instruction. 
A flexible attitude that will react to new needs and be ready and 
willing to remedy weaknesses as they are revealed is essential. 

The need for constant change is a recognized one in the history of 
reading methodology. 

(5) The demands of society influence changes in methods. 
Society is vitally concerned about the reading skill of its cit¬ 
izens. Sociological considerations, recognized needs to develop 
specific reading skills and public interest in certain types of 
proficiency set new objectives which promote changes in emphasis 
in teaching and. in the methods used. 

(6) Extremes in methodology are dangerous. The safe middle 
ground is best. The history of reading methodology follows a 
pattern of extremes. The aim of the later 1940* s was to achieve 
a balanced reading program through incorporating into it the many 
good features of past programs and countering the good points of 
several different methods to offset the weaknesses of others. 

Variety, flexibility and constant evaluation are essentials of this 
approach. 

(7) Children react differently to similar methods. No 
method produces the same results in all situations and with all 
children. Methods are constantly being adapted to meet the needs

of each chiles particular background, abilities and interests. 
Methods are selected to meet the particular needs of the language, 
the situation and the community in which it is used. 

(8) Recognition of the complexity of the reading process 
and an awareness of the intricacies involved make heavier demands 
on teacher competency. A basic understanding of methodology and 
a skilful selection and use of materials is vital to meet the 
general and specific needs of the children in the classroom.
