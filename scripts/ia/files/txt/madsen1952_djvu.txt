Abstract 


Pood consumption in alloxan diabetic rats shows a 
positive correlation with serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) 
activity, blood glucose level and body weight. Vitamin 
given orally has no effect on SAP levels of normal or 
diabetic rats, nor does it modify the effect of supple¬ 
mentary methionine in either group, or of supplementary 
choline in normal rats. The addition of methionine to 
Purina Pox Checkers results in lowered SAP levels of both 
normal and diabetic rats due to the lowered consumption 
of this diet. Supplementary choline decreases SAP acti¬ 
vity of normal rats but increases slightly the SAP levels 
in diabetic rats. 

The effect of five inhibitors on the alkaline phos¬ 
phatases of four tissues, in addition to serum, are pre-- 
sented and discussed. The evidence indicates that the in¬ 
creased SAP of alloxan diabetic rats, or of rats receiv¬ 
ing a high-fat diet, originates in the intestine. The 
major portion of the SAP in normal rats appears to be de¬ 
rived from the intestine. 

Fatty acida are the only dietary components which 
raise SAP activity above starvation levels. Oleic acid 
has a greater effect than stearic acid. Alkaline phos¬ 
phatase appears to be involved in the intestinal absorp¬ 
tion of saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids.

I. INTRODUCTION 

The term "alkaline phosphatase" is usually under¬ 
stood to refer to that enzyme which hydrolyzes monoesters 
of phosphoric acid at an optimal pH of approximately 9-10# 
Alkaline phosphatase activity is usually determined by 
measuring the rate of hydrolysis of sodium B-glycero¬ 
phosphate or phenyl phosphate, although other substrates 
are also used* Magnesium is usually added to the incu¬ 
bation mixture, since the enzyme is activated by this 
ion in very dilute concentrations* 

The first discovery of phosphatase activity dates 
back to 1907 when Suzuki, Yoshimura and Takaishi (1) 
found that certain cereals contained an enzyme which 
hydrolyzed phytin with the production of inorganic phos¬ 
phoric acid* This enzyme is now known as phytase and is 
different from alkaline phosphatase. Since then, many 
different types of phosphatases have been discovered and 
investigated; and they have been found to occur in a 
great diversity of living tissues both plant and animal* 
For a comprehensive review and classification of the 
phosphatases the reader is referred to the review by 
Folley and Kay (2). 

Alkaline phosphatase occurs in greatest concen¬ 
trations in kidney, bone, intestine, mammary gland, 
lung, blood plasma, leucocytes and liver, although most

other mammalian tissues contain this enzyme* Recent 
studies (3 - 7) on the characteristics of the tissue 
alkaline phosphatases have led to the general conclusion 
that each tissue has a distinct phosphatase* Each tissue 
phosphatase differs from that of other tissues in beha¬ 
viour toward inhibitors and activators, pH optima, and 
degree of reactivity with various substrates* This con¬ 
clusion is not absolute, since some tissue phosphatases 
are almost indistinguishable, and the enzyme in some 
tissues undoubtedly is derived, in whole or in part, 
from outside sources* 

The function of aikaline phosphatase in various 
tissues has been the subject of much investigation* The 
large concentration of alkaline phosphatase in bone, 
particularly of younger animals, led to studies on the 
role of phosphatase in calcification* Robison and his 
coworkers (8 - 10) investigated this problem and con¬ 
cluded that the enzyme acts on hexose monophosphate, re¬ 
leasing phosphate ion which affects the product of cal¬ 
cium and phosphate ion concentrations to such a degree 
that the solubility product is exceeded and calcium phos¬ 
phate is precipitated* Neuman, Distefano and Mulryan 
(11) showed that ester phosphate inhibits calcification 
when phosphatase is absent, can form a complex with cal¬ 
cium ions, and that glycerol phosphate is used in bone

formation. The three-fold role of phosphatase in bone 
calcification is, then, to increase the concentration of 
free phosphate ion, to exert a protective action by pre¬ 
venting the adsorption of ester phosphate, and to increase 
the calcium concentration by destroying the complex 
forming agent, Zetterstrom (12, 13) has recently shown 
that bone phosphatase is activated as much as 400$ by 
vitamin D 2 phosphate, and kidney phosphatase is acti¬ 
vated 200$, This would explain the role of vitamin D 
in bone formation, and also the poor intestinal and 
renal absorption associated with deficiency of this 
vitamin. The problem of bone formation is still very 
controversial, however, as Siffert (14) concluded from 
histochemical studies that bone phosphatase is related 
to the elaboration of bone matrix, and that any function 
in making inorganic salts available is a secondary one. 

The alkaline phosphatase of the kidney has been 
shown to have an important function in the resorption 
of glucose in the convoluted tubules. This function was 
first suggested by Lundsgaard (15) in 1933 and it has 
been substantiated since then (16 - 18), Glucose is 
phosphorylated during its passage through the convol¬ 
uted tubules and is dephosphorylated during the resorp¬ 
tion process. Phosphatase probably acts in the dephos¬ 
phorylation stage, since the cells of the convoluted

tubules are very rich in the enzyme while the glom¬ 
eruli, organs of filtration, do not contain phospha¬ 
tase in most animal species. 

Intestinal mucosa has the highest concentration 
of alkaline phosphatase of any of the tissues and many 
authors (19 - 23) consider that it may participate in 
the absorption of glucose and/or fatty acids. Lunds- 
gaard (15) and Verzar (24, 25) support the hypothesis 
that glucose is phosphorylated and then dephosphoryl- 
ated during absorption. Feeding of fat, on the other 
hand, has been shown to result in higher alkaline phos¬ 
phatase levels of the intestine (26) and intestinal 
lymph (27) than the feeding of carbohydrates. The 
mechanism of phosphatase action in the intestine dur¬ 
ing the absorption of glucose and/or fatty acids is 
still largely unknown. 

When glycogen in the liver is mobilized, it is 
broken down into glucose for transport by the blood. 
Hexose phosphates are intermediates in this transfor¬ 
mation and alkaline phosphatase undoubtedly functions 
to hydrolyze glucose-6-phosphate to free glucose. 

Serum alkaline phosphatase levels are used clin¬ 
ically in the diagnosis of certain diseases. Many bone 
diseases as well as obstructive jaundice result in ele¬ 
vated serum alkaline phosphatase levels in the human.

Satisfactory explanations for these phenomena are not 
available in some cases. 

Workers in this laboratory have investigated 
factors affecting the serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
in rats* Cantor, Tuba and Capsey (28) found that rats 
with alloxan diabetes had abnormally high serum phospha¬ 
tases which could be affected by alterations in the 
diets received by the animals. Tuba, Baker and Cantor 
(29) found a pronounced diurnal variation in the level 
of the enzyme, associated with the time of feeding, 
which necessitated bleeding the animals at 8 a.m* in 
order to standardize the effect of this factor. They 
showed that serum alkaline phosphatase activity varied 
directly with the daily food consumption, and that the 
influences of sex, castration and sex hormones upon the 
enzyme levels were exerted through the food consumption* 
Cantor, Wight and Tuba (30) proved that it was the fat 
content of the diet, rather than the caloric intake, 
that determined the level of the serum enzyme. Tuba, 
Cantor and Richards (31) found that weanling rats fed 
on a diet consisting chiefly of barley with a low pro¬ 
tein content had greatly elevated serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatases. When methionine was added to the diet the 
enzyme levels were reduced to nearly normal values. 

Tuba and Shaw (32) studied the effect of diet-

ary fat, methionine and cystine on the serum phospha¬ 
tase activity of weanling rats* The serum phosphatase 
levels increased in direct correlation to increased fat 
ingestion but addition of methionine to the diet reduced 
these high enzyme levels to nearly normal values* 

This earlier work has now been extended and a 
study has been made of the effect of methionine and 
other lipotropic substances on the levels of serum 
alkaline phosphatase in relation to food consumption* 

The source of the alkaline phosphatase in serum was 
then investigated in order to explain the effect of 
the various factors mentioned above* Finally, a study 
of the function of the alkaline phosphatase in the 
intestine was begun*

II. METHODS 

1. The Experimental Animal 

Adult male albino rats were used in all exper¬ 
iments. They were housed individually in metal cages 
and were given their diets and tap water ad libitum. 

The individual daily food consumptions were recorded 
weekly. Body weights were taken whenever blood samp¬ 
les were collected, usually once per week. 

Sampling of blood of the animals in the dietary 
experiments was accomplished by "milking" the blood from 
the tail into small tubes which were centrifuged within 
an hour after bleeding. The sera, separated from the 
formed elements, were used for the determination of 
alkaline phosphatase either immediately following separ¬ 
ation or after having been stored at 5° C. for not 
more than two days. Blood specimens were obtained at 
approximately 9:00 a.m., unless otherwise noted. 

Diabetes was induced in adult male albino rats 
by the subcutaneous injection of alloxan (Eastman Kodak) 
into rats which had been starved overnight. One ml. 
of a 3.2^ solution of alloxan was injected per 200 gram 
rat. Blood sugars were determined on the blood of these 
animals one week after the alloxan injection and those 
rats with blood sugars 200^ or more of normal were con¬ 
sidered to be diabetic#

2. Phosphatase Determination 

Alkaline phosphatases of the serum and other 
tissues were determined by the micromethod of Shinowara, 
Jones and Reinhart (33), as modified by Gould and Shwacli¬ 
man (34)* This procedure measures the rate of hydrolysis 
of sodium B-glycerophosphate by phosphatase in terms of 
phosphate ion liberated in the reaction. The phosphate 
liberated is measured by the method of Kuttner and Lich¬ 
tenstein (35). The unit of phosphatase activity is de¬ 
fined by Shinowara et al as "equivalent to one milligram 
of phosphorus liberated as phosphate ion during one hour 
of incubation at 37°C., with a substrate containing sod¬ 
ium B-glycerophosphate, hydrolysis not exceeding 10$ of 
the substrate, and pH optimum of the reaction mixture 
for the alkaline enzyme at 9.3 + 0.15". 

(a) Reagents 

(1) Substrate - buffer mixture 

0.4240 gm. sodium diethyl barbiturate 
0.5000 gm. sodium B-glycerophosphate 
0.2464 gm. magnesium sulfate heptahydrate 
dissolved in 100 ml. cold double distilled 
carbonate free water.

cold ten normal sulfuric acid with constant 
shaking* 

(3) Stannous chloride 

I Stock solution - 6.0 gm. stannous chloride 
and 10 ml. hydrochloric acid. Covered with 
a toluene layer and stored in the refrig¬ 
erator. 

II Dilute solution - 0.2 ml. of stock solution 
diluted to 100 ml. with cold double distill¬ 
ed water. Kept cold and used within four 
hours. 

(4) Stock phosphorus solution 

0.4394 gm. potassium diphosphate made up to 
one litre. (100.1 micrograms of phosphor¬ 
us per ml.) 

(b) Method 

Inorganic phosphorus was determined on 0.2 ml. of 
a 1:10 dilution of the serum or the supernatant from cen¬ 
trifuged tissue homogenates. Alkaline phosphatase was 
determined on 0.2 ml. of a 1:100 dilution of serum or a 
1:10 dilution of supernatant from centrifuged tissue hom¬ 
ogenates. Diluted sera were pipetted into two 10x75 mm. 
test tubes and 0.4 ml. of water was added to the serum 
being tested for inorganic phosphorus. The test tubes

and their contents were warmed on a water bath at 37°C., 
and then 0*4 ml. of the substrate-buffer mixture, also 
at 37°C., was added. Hydrolysis was allowed to proceed 
for precisely one hour and then 0.4 ml. of 10^ trichlor¬ 
acetic acid was run into the tubes to precipitate the 
proteins and stop the enzyme action. 

The tubes were centrifuged and the phosphorus 
concentrations were determined on 0.5 ml. portions of 
the supernatants, which were placed in 13x100 mm. test 
tubes. To each 0.5 ml. portion was added 0.7 ml. of 
0.1 N NaOH and, in quick succession, with constant and 
vigorous shaking, 0.4 ml. of molybdic acid and 0.4 ml. 
of SnCl 2 * All reagents added were cold. The intensity 
of the blue color which develops due to the formation 
of reduced oxides of molybdenum was read after 15 min¬ 
utes in a Coleman Universal Spectrophotometer (Model 14) 
at 6000 A 0 , with a blank, consisting of 1.2 ml. of water, 
0.4 ml. molybdic acid and 0.4 ml. SnClg, set at 100^ 
transmission. 

The percent transmission of each sample was con¬ 
verted into concentration of phosphorus by the use of a 
standard graph which was prepared by plotting the values 
of a number of different known values of phosphorus con¬ 
centration (KH 2 PQ 4 ) against their percent transmission.

3. Blood Sugar Determination 

Blood sugar was determined by the micromethod of 
Reinecke (36). Protein was precipitated with tungstic 
acid. The sugar in the centrifuged supernatant solution 
was oxidised with alkaline potassium ferricyanide. The 
ferrocyanide so formed was estimated colorimetrically, 
after conversion to Prussian Blue. 

(a) Reagents 

(1) Ferric iron gum ghatti solution 

Gum ghatti tears were suspended for 18 
hours in a copper screen at the top of a 
tall container filled with water (20 gm./ 
litre water)• The solution was filtered 
and 7 gm. ferric sulfate hydrate dissolved 
in 75 ml. 85^ phosphoric acid were added 
per litre. 1 % KMnO^ was added slowly un¬ 
til a trace of pink persisted for 15 min¬ 
utes in order to destroy certain reducing 
substances present in the gum ghatti. The 
solution keeps indefinitely. 

(2) Cyanide - carbonate buffer 

4 gm. sodium carbonate dissolved in 25 ml. 
water were added to 0.75 gm. sodium cyanide 
dissolved in 75 ml. water and diluted to 


500 ml 






12 


(3) Potassium ferricyanide solution 

250 mg. potassium ferricyanide in 500 ml. 
of water. 

(4) Dilute tungstic acid 

10 ml. of 0,67 N sulfuric acid and 10 ml. 
of 10$ sodium tungstate were diluted to 
500 ml. 

(b) Method 

A hemoglobin pipette was used to deliver 0.02 
ml. of blood into 5 ml. of the tungstic acid reagent, 
and the pipette was rinsed several times with the acid. 

A stream of air bubbles blown by mouth through the pi¬ 
pette was used to mix the liquids. After 15 minutes 
the mixture was centrifuged and 1 ml. of the superna¬ 
tant solution was transferred to a 15x125 mm. test tube. 

1 ml. of potassium ferricyanide solution was then added 
to the sample and to 1 ml. of water used as a blank. 

The tubes were heated for 15 seconds in a boiling water 
bath and 1 ml. of the buffer was added. The tubes were 
then heated for 15 minutes in the boiling water bath 
with large marbles covering them to act as condensers. 

After cooling the tubes in ice water to 30°C., 1 ml. of 
the ferric iron gum ghatti solution was added and 1 ml. 
of water was then added to bring the volume up to 5 ml. 
Thorough mixing was necessary at each addition of reagents.

After 30 minutes the color produced was read in 
a Coleman Universal Spectrophotometer (Model 14) at 
6400 A°, with the blank set at 100^ transmission. Sugar 
concentration was calculated by comparison of the read¬ 
ings with a calibration curve constructed by carrying 
out the above procedure on glucose solutions of known 
concentration#

III. THE RELATIONSHIP OF TOTAL FOOD CONSUMPTION, METH¬ 
IONINE, CHOLINE AND VITAMIN B 12 TO THE ALKALINE 
PHOSPHATASE IN RAT SERUM 

1. Introduction 

Tuba and Shaw (32) studied the effect of dietary 
fat, methionine and cystine on the serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase activity of weanling male albino rats. Varia¬ 
tions in the concentrations of fat and methionine in 
the synthetic diets fed to growing rats produced marked 
alterations in the levels of the enzyme, as well as in 
the daily food consumption. Cantor, Wight and Tuba (30) 
found that the abnormally high serum alkaline phospha¬ 
tase levels associated with alloxan diabetic adult rats 
could be influenced by alterations in the diets received 
by the animals. This section is concerned with the 
effect of supplementary methionine, already studied in 
weanling animals, on the serum alkaline phosphatase 
and food consumption of normal and alloxan diabetic adult 
male rats. Vitamin which is reported to have li¬ 

potropic and transmethylating effects (37), was used 
as a dietary supplement as well as the lipotrope, choline.

2* Experimental 

Adult male albino rats, both alloxan diabetic 
and normal, were fed ad libitum a basal diet of ground 
Purina Fox Checkers or the basal diet supplemented as 
indicated below. Serum alkaline phosphatase and blood 
sugar levels were determined by the methods described 
above•

3. Results and Discussion 

The Relationship Between Total Food Consumption and 

Serum Alkaline Phosphatase of Alloxan Diabetic Rats 

Nine adult male rats which manifested well est¬ 
ablished alloxan diabetes were placed in individual 
cages and they were given ground Purina Pox Checkers 
and water ad libitum for 3 days. At the end of that 
time the daily food consumption, body weights, blood 
glucose and serum alkaline phosphatase levels were de¬ 
termined for each animal. They were then fed success¬ 
ive decrements of food as indicated in Table I for 3 
day periods. At the end of each period, the animals 
were weighed and estimations were made of the blood 
glucose and serum phosphatase. The results are shown 
in Table I and are illustrated in Figure 1.

FOOD CONSUMPTION IN GRAMS 

Fig# 1# The relationship between daily food consumption and 

serum alkaline phosphatase (—•), blood glucose (—— ), 

and body weights (— - -)# 
















19 


The correlation of mean serum alkaline phospha¬ 
tase activity.' with food consumption is 0.99. The for¬ 
mula of the regression line shown in Figure 1 is 
P ~ 13.27 C +• 6, where P is the phosphatase activity- 
in units/100 ml. and C is the daily food consumption in 
grams. The regression coefficient has a t_ value of 
13.27 (P < 0.01) and the correlation between food con¬ 
sumption and enzyme activity is highly significant. 

Correlations of blood glucose levels and of 
body weights with food consumption are also highly 
significant. (0.96 and 0.99 respectively.) 

The Effect of Dietary Supplements Fed to Normal and 

Alloxan Diabetic Adult Hats 

The effect on serum alkaline phosphatase of 
feeding various levels of food to normal adult male 
rats has been reported by Cantor, Wight and Tuba (30) 
and a highly significant correlation of 0.97 was ob¬ 
tained. Tuba, Baker and Cantor (29) found that vari¬ 
ations in this serum enzyme occuned in male and female 
rats following gonadectomy or injection of various sex 
hormones, and that these changes could be related to 
food consumption. The correlation, which in this in¬ 
stance was 0.70, was significant, but it could also be 
concluded that other factors might exert a modifying 


influence

The concentration of dietary fat appears to be 
very closely associated with levels of alkaline phos¬ 
phatase in rat serum. Statistical analysis of the 
results of Cantor, Wight and Tuba (30) obtained with 
adult animals on limited, subnormal food intake, ind¬ 
icates a highly significant correlation of 0.86 
(P < 0.01) between the daily intake of fat and the 
serum enzyme. The work of Tuba and Shaw (32) with 
weanling rats fed various synthetic diets ad libitum 
further confirms this relationship, and in this case 
the correlation is 0.98 (P< 0.01). It was noted 
from the results of Tuba and Shaw and from unpublished 
data from this laboratory that the influence of diet¬ 
ary fat may be modified by other factors in the diet. 
When methionine is used as a supplement, the usual 
correlation between food consumption and enzyme acti¬ 
vity is not observed, or in other words, supplementary 
methionine in itself produces a significant alteration 
in the serum alkaline phosphatase levels of normal 
weanling rats. 

The action of methionine in lowering serum alk¬ 
aline phosphatase levels, presumably because of the 
lipotropic effect of the labile methyl groups, led to 
the use of this amino acid as a dietary supplement in 
normal and alloxan diabetic adult rats. Another lipo-

tropic substance, choline, was also used as a supple¬ 
ment as well as vitamin B^ g , reported to have trans- 
methylating and lipotropic actions (37)• In all the 
following experiments a basal diet of ground Purina 
Fox Checkers was used. 

The Effect of Vitamin 

Saline solutions of crystalline vitamin B-^g 
were used. Oral supplements of this solution, equiv¬ 
alent to 1.0 microgram daily, were given to 8 normal 
and 7 alloxan diabetic adult rats for 3 days. The 
results, not reported here, showed that supplementary 
vitamin B-^g bad no significant effect on serum alkaline 
phosphatase levels of normal or alloxan diabetic ani¬ 
mals . 

The Effect of Methionine Alone or With Vitamin B iq 

(a) Normal Rats 

A group of 10 adult male rats was fed ad libit¬ 
um a diet of ground checkers to which methionine had 
been added to a concentration of 3 %. Another group 
of 10 animals received the same diet but in addition 
was given oral supplements of 1.0 microgram of vita¬ 
min B^g daily after the eighth day. The two groups 
were maintained on their respective diets for 17 days. 
The results in Table II give a correlation of serum

alkaline phosphatase activity with food intake of 
0.92 (P < 0.01) for the group receiving supplementary 
methionine and of 0.90 for the group receiving supple¬ 
ments of methionine and vitamin B]_2* Therefore in 
normal adult male rats the decrease in levels of the 
enzyme associated with methionine supplementation of 
the basal diet can be related to the lowered food con¬ 
sumption. This is contrary to the findings with wean¬ 
ling animals reported by Tuba and Shaw. Vitamin B^g 
produced no significant effect on the enzyme in addi¬ 
tion to that attributable to methionine.

(b) Alloxan Diabetic Hats 

The preceding experiment was repeated with all- 
oxan diabetic adult male rats for twenty-one days. The 
results in Table III give a correlation of 0.99 (P< 0.01) 
between enzyme activity and food intake in the group 
receiving methionine and of 0.96 for the group receiv¬ 
ing supplementary methionine and vitamin B-^g* There¬ 
fore, in neither group did the supplementation of the 
diet affect the serum alkaline phosphatase levels, as 
in the experiment above with normal adult animals. 

In all four groups of adult animals receiving 
supplementary methionine, after an initial adjustment 
to the dietary regimen, weights remained constant in 
spite of decreased food consumption. In previous ex¬ 
periments with weanling rats fed moderate supplements 
of methionine the rate of growth was similar to that 
of the unsupplemented animals, although food consump¬ 
tions vfere appreciably lower (32) . It would appear 
that supplementation with methionine results in nutri¬ 
tionally adequate diets which are characterized by 
lowered food consumption.

The Effect of Choline Alone or With Vitamin B ^g 

(a) Normal Hats 

Ten adult male rats were fed a diet consisting 
of the basal diet containing a supplement of 1.5$ 
choline, and another group of 10 normal animals receiv¬ 
ed the same diet and in addition oral supplements of 
1.0 microgram, of vitamin each daily after the 

eighth day. Statistical analysis of the results in 
Table IV shows that there is no correlation between food 
consumption and phosphatase activity in either group. 
The results further indicate that supplementary choline 
produced a lowering of about 20$ in the alkaline phos¬ 
phatase activities of both groups. Comparison of mean 
phosphatase levels at the beginning of the experiment 
and at its termination 14 days later shows a signifi¬ 
cant decrease with a t value of 6.05 (P < 0.01) in the 
first group. During the experiment the animals gained 
in Y/eight, which, in my experience, serves to emphasize 
the importance of the decrease in enzyme activity. 
Comparison of the final phosphatase values for the two 
groups shows that vitamin B^g had in itself no effect 
on the enzyme•

(b) Alloxan Diabetic Rats 

Ten animals which had been diabetic for three 
weeks were used* This period ensured the use of an¬ 
imals still in relatively good condition, and with 
serum alkaline phosphatase activity levelled off at 
about 200 - 300$J above normal (30) <» They were fed the 
basal diet containing a supplement of 1*5^ choline for 
6 weeks, and at the end of that time the amount of add¬ 
ed choline was increased to 2.5^ for 7 additional days* 

A slight but statistically significant increase was 
found in the phosphatase values, which showed no corr¬ 
elation with food consumption. A rise of similar mag¬ 
nitude was noted in an identical experiment* 

The effect of supplementary choline on the ab¬ 
normally elevated alkaline phosphatases of the sera of 
alloxan diabetic rats is the opposite of the findings 
with normal rats. This finding further emphasizes the 
metabolic abnormalities found in this type of experi¬ 
mental diabetes. 

The effect of oral vitamin B lg on the serum phos¬ 
phatase activity of alloxan diabetic animals receiving 
supplementary choline was not investigated, in view of 
the lack of effect of the vitamin in the experiments

4. Summary 

Pood consumption in alloxan diabetic rats shows 
a positive correlation with (1) alkaline phosphatase 
activity of the serum, (2) blood glucose level, (3) body 
weight, similar to the correlation between enzyme acti¬ 
vity and food intake in normal adult rats when fed a 
stock laboratory diet* 

Oral vitamin B12 has no effect on serum alkaline 
phosphatase levels of normal or diabetic rats, nor does 
it modify the effect of supplementary methionine in ei¬ 
ther group. The effect of supplementary choline on 
the phosphatase of normal rats is unaltered by this vit¬ 
amin, which is reported to have transmethylating and li¬ 
potropic influences. 

Methionine added to Purina Fox Checkers lowers 
phosphatase levels of the serum of both normal and 
diabetic adult animals, but this is directly related 
to lowered food consumption which always accompanies 
supplementation with this amino acid. The animals 
maintain their weights and appear to be in good con¬ 
dition, so it may be assumed that the lowered intake of 
food is adequate. 

Supplementary choline decreases serum phospha¬ 
tase levels of normal rats by about 20^ of initial val¬ 
ues, and this is due to the choline itself and not to

altered food consumption. Phosphatase levels of alloxan 
diabetic rats, however, are slightly but significantly 
elevated by supplementary choline.

IV. ON THE SOURCE OF THE ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE IN 

RAT SERUM 

I. Introduction 

The results of the previous section confirm, 
the findings of other workers (29, 30, 38) that serum 
alkaline phosphatase activity varies with food con¬ 
sumption; and that most factors affecting levels of 
the serum enzyme transmit their effect through alter¬ 
ations in food consumption. In attempting to explain 
these facts, it appeared logical to investigate the 
origin of serum phosphatase. 

Alkaline phosphatase occurs in several tissues 
and consequently the source of the enzyme in serum has 
stimulated considerable investigation and speculation. 
Dalgaard (39) reported that the removal of the small 
intestine or the kidney from the dog does not prevent 
the increase in serum alkaline phosphatase activity 
which always follows ligation of the common bile duct 
in this animal. Freeman (40) concluded that the liver 
in the dog is the source of increased serum phosphatase 
because increased levels of the enzyme were greater fol 
lowing bile duct obstruction than following hepatectomy 
There was a three-fold increase in serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase In the latter case, despite the fact that the 
animals died within two days, possibly without eating.

It is well known that obstructive jaundice in the human 
causes increased serum alkaline phosphatase activity. 

Ligation of the common bile duct in the rat, how¬ 
ever, was shown by Weil and Russel (41) to result in a 
sharp decrease in serum alkaline phosphatase levels, 
which could be prevented by the addition of bile to the 
diet. The low enzyme levels returned to normal as new 
bile ducts were formed. Other workers (42) reported 
that ligation of the common bile duct prevented the 
increase in alkaline phosphatase activity which normal¬ 
ly accompanies a meal rich in fat. However, there was 
an increase in the plasma over fasting levels of the en¬ 
zyme, although activity was still far below normal. 

These investigations with the rat would seem to indicate 
that the response of serum alkaline phosphatase to bile 
duct obstruction in this animal differs markedly from 
the response in the dog and in the human. 

Weil and Russel (38), and, subsequently. Cantor, 
Wight and Tuba (30), found that the starving of normal 
rats reduced their serum alkaline phosphatase levels to 
very low values within 24 hours. The activity of the 
enzyme remained at constant, low levels throughout fur¬ 
ther starvation, but it was rapidly restored to normal 
when the animals were fed their stock laboratory diet. 
The former workers found that only the fat portion of

the diet was effective in raising fasting levels of the 
serum enzyme to normal. Gould (43) also showed that the 
feeding of fat to rats produced a marked increase in ser¬ 
um phosphatase activity. In addition, he observed that 
the inhibition of the serum enzyme by sodium taurochol- 
ate resembled the inhibition by this substance of intes¬ 
tinal rather than bone or kidney phosphatase. 

Various workers in this laboratory (29, 30, 32) 
have obtained a highly significant correlation between 
the daily food consumption of rats and their serum phos¬ 
phatase levels, and they have demonstrated that this cor¬ 
relation is associated with the amount of fat ingested. 
Laurie and Judkins (26), when studying the effect of diet 
up>on rat intestinal phosphatase activity, found that diets 
containing 55%' to 70% sucrose produced a lower concen¬ 
tration of the enzyme in the intestine than when the 
sucrose was replaced by fat or protein. Kosman, Karl- 
berg and Freeman (44) found that the intestine of dogs 
secreted the greatest amount of phosphatase after a fat 
or protein meal, and least after ingestion of carbohy¬ 
drates. A. Eodansky (20), however, reported that only 
carbohydrate would restore the low fasting levels of 
plasma alkaline phosphatase to their normal values in 
young dogs. He concluded that plasma alkaline phospha¬ 
tase is of mixed origin, and that the intestine is an

important source. Furthermore, levels of the serum en¬ 
zyme in various diseases reflect alterations in alkaline 
phosphatase concentration in the organs affected. The 
latter view is substantiated by Motzok (45), who showed 
that the elevated plasma phosphatase in the rachitic 
chick originates in the bone. 

It would appear from the investigations referred 
to in the preceding paragraph that similar dietary 
regimens have similar effects upon the phosphatase lev¬ 
els of both the intestine and serum of various animals. 
The relationship between the enzyme in the intestine 
and serum was further elucidated by the studies of Flock 
and Bollman (27) on intestinal lymph. The phosphatase 
levels of the lymph were higher than the plasma levels, 
and these were decreased upon starving and increased 
again upon feeding. The changes in the lymph were par¬ 
alleled by the changes in the plasma. The increases 
were greatest after a meal rich in fat. It was further 
observed that when all the lymph was collected contin¬ 
uously and not allowed to reach the blood, the plasma 
phosphatase was reduced to very low levels within 35 
hours. They concluded that alkaline phosphatase is 
supplied to the blood from the small intestine by way 
of the lymph. 

Several investigators have presented evidence to

support the hypothesis that the liver is an important 
source of serum alkaline phosphatase (46, 47), while 
others (39, 48) have concluded that the liver serves 
primarily as a regulator of the secretion of phospha¬ 
tase into the bile. Gould and Schwachman (49) found 
that the decreased level of serum alkaline phosphatase 
in the scorbutic guinea pig was paralleled by decreas¬ 
ed bone phosphatase activity. The inhibitory effect 
of sodium taurocholate on the serum phosphatase acti¬ 
vity resembled the effect on bone and kidney phospha¬ 
tase rather than on intestinal phosphatase. Armstrong 
and Banting (50) extirpated the intestines, kidneys, 
spleen, pancreas, liver, testes and epididymes of the 
dog without lowering the serum alkaline phosphatase 
activity, and they concluded that bone is the sole 
source. 

There are numerous other papers concerned with 
the possible source of serum alkaline phosphatase. 
Unfortunately, many of them fail to consider the highly 
significant correlation which exists between food con¬ 
sumption and the phosphatase levels of both the serum 
and the intestine. 

Certain inhibitors have been used to differen¬ 
tiate the alkaline phosphatases of the tissues. Cloe- 
tens (4) separated the phosphatases of liver extract

into a cyanide sensitive and a cyanide insensitive frac¬ 
tion. Various workers have used cyanide inhibition of 
certain tissue alkaline phosphatases in an attempt to 
elucidate the source of the serum enzyme (51-53)* 

Oxalate will also inhibit the phosphatases of different 
tissues to varying degrees (54). 0. Bodansky (55) found 

that bile acids inhibited bone and kidney phosphatases 
but that they had no effect on intestinal phosphatase. 

He also studied the inhibition of tissue phosphatases 
by amino acids (3)* Glycine and D-L-alanine inhibited 
the phosphatases of bone, kidney and intestine to the 
same extent, while L-glutamic acid inhibited intestinal 
phosphatase more than it did bone or kidney phosphatases 
L-lysine and L-histidine caused a lesser degree of inhib 
ition of intestinal phosphatase than of the other two 
tissues• 

The evidence so far presented by various workers 
on the origin of rat serum alkaline phosphatase tends to 
be inconclusive. Work in this laboratory has clearly 
shown that a number of factors (28 - 32) markedly in¬ 
fluence the levels of rat serum alkaline phosphatase, 
and it seemed possible that some of these would be use¬ 
ful in attempting to solve the problem insofar as the 
rat is concerned. In addition, the successful employ¬ 
ment of inhibitors to differentiate the phosphatases

of various tissues led to the use of some of these in 
this investigation. The effects of five inhibitors 
upon the alkaline phosphatases of four tissues, in add¬ 
ition to serum, were studied simultaneously under iden¬ 
tical experimental conditions in order to obtain a com¬ 
prehensive view. The mechanism of inhibition by any 
of these substances is not considered in this thesis.

2. Experimental 

Adult male albino rats were used in all experi¬ 
ments. They were killed by exsanguination, and the ser¬ 
um, which was separated immediately, was stored in the 
refrigerator. The liver, one kidney, the first ten cm. 
of the small intestine from the pylorus, and the femur 
and tibia of one leg were removed at once and placed on 
ice until they could be prepared. All tissues were 
cleaned of extraneous material, washed with cold dis¬ 
tilled water, blotted dry, and weighed. They were then 
homogenized with approximately 100 ml. of cold distilled 
water for four minutes in a Waring blendor. The homo¬ 
genates were placed in 200 ml. volumetric flasks (250 
ml. for intestine) and stored overnight at 5°C. In the 
morning the homogenates were made up to volume and 
shaken, and a portion of each was then centrifuged. An 
aliquot of the supernatant thus obtained was diluted ten 
times and used at once in the experiments. 

Phosphatase activity was determined by the micro¬ 
method described in Section II. pH optimum tests were 
run on the tissues and while there were slight differ¬ 
ences it was felt that these were not sufficient to 
prevent doing all the tests at the same pH of 9.3. The 
inhibitors used were sodium taurocholate, sodium cya¬ 
nide, sodium oxalate, L-glutamic acid and L-lysine.

These were included in the usual substrate - buffer mix¬ 
ture and the pH was adjusted to give a pH in the incu¬ 
bation mixture of 9.3 +-0.15, in order to obviate inhi¬ 
bition which could be attributed to changes in hydrogen- 
ion concentration. The concentrations of inhibitors re¬ 
ported in the tables are for the incubation mixtures.

2. Results 
Alloxan Diabetic Rats 

Cantor, Tuba and Capsey (28) reported that rats 
with alloxan diabetes had greatly increased serum alk¬ 
aline phosphatases and an attempt was made to ascertain, 
if possible, the source of this extra phosphatase. A 
group of animals manifesting well established alloxan 
diabetes, with blood sugars approximately 400$ of nor¬ 
mal, were used in this experiment. They were given 
ground Purina Fox Checkers and water ad libitum. The 
results are reported in Table VI and are Illustrated 
in Figure 2. See discussion on pages 51 to 54. 

Rats Receiving 25$ Fat Diet 

It was next attempted to determine whether the 
increased serum alkaline phosphatase caused by the 
feeding of fat to rats (32, 43) is of the same nature 
and source as that produced by alloxan diabetes. Rats 
for this experiment were starved for three days and 
then fed a diet containing 25$ fat for two days. This 
resulted in serum alkaline phosphatase levels which 
were much higher than normal. The diet used consisted 
of 23$ hydrogenated vegetable oils (Crisco), 2$ cod 
liver oil, 20$ casein, 51$ sucrose, 4$ McCollum*s Salt 
Mixture, together with adequate supplements of the

Rats maintained on an ad libitum diet of Purina 
Fox Checkers were used. The results are given in 
Table VIII and are Illustrated in Figure 4. 

Starved Rats 

R&ts previously fed on checkers were starved for 
one week before being used in the experiments. The re¬ 
sults are shown in Table IX and are illustrated in

RESIDUAL ACTIVITY OF SERUM PHOSPHATASE (%) 


Fig. 2 . Residual activity of tissue alkaline phosphatases in the 
presence of various inhibitors plotted against the corresponding 
residual phosphatase of serum in DIABETIC adult rats. Each point 
represents the mean value with one inhibitor for 4 rats. The line 
drawn through the origin with a slope of 45° represents the theor- 
etical graph of any tissue phosphatase which manifests a pattern of 
behaviour towars the inhibitors identical with that of serum alk¬ 
aline phosphatase.

4. Discussion 

The data in Tables VI and VII for the diabetic 
rats and those receiving a high fat diet show clearly 
that the inhibition pattern of serum phosphatase strik¬ 
ingly resembles that of the intestinal phosphatase, 
while the phosphatases of the other tissues manifest 
a distinctly different response to the inhibitors used. 
The similarity between serum and intestinal phospha¬ 
tases is emphasized further by Figures 2 and 3. There¬ 
fore on the basis of the evidence presented here it 
may be said that the Increase in serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase levels which is characteristic both of alloxan 
diabetes and of a high fat diet originates in the intes¬ 
tine. In Support of this conclusion, it should be 
noted that the level of alkaline phosphatase in the in¬ 
testine is much higher in the case of these two groups 
of animals than in the case of the normal or the starved 
rats. 

The inhibition of the serum phosphatase of normal 
animals does not resemble that of the intestinal phos¬ 
phatase as closely as in the preceding two groups of 
rats (Table VIII and Figure 4). However, the similar¬ 
ity is sufficient to justify the conclusion that the 
major portion of the serum alkaline phosphatase of nor¬ 
mal rats is derived from the intestine, and this is

supported by the statements of other workers (27, 43)• 
Normal rats have a much lower serum alkaline phospha¬ 
tase level than either diabetic rats or those receiv¬ 
ing a high fat diet, and so any contribution from tis¬ 
sues other than the intestine would be proportionally 
greater, and this would account for the lesser degree 
of similarity between intestinal and serum phospha¬ 
tases which may be observed in Figure 4* In those 
rats which have abnormally high serum phosphatase lev¬ 
els the influence of contributions from other tissues 
would be virtually nullified by the overwhelming ex¬ 
cess from the intestine. 

The response of the serum alkaline phosphatase 
of starved rats deviates still more from the pattern 
for intestinal phosphatase (Table IX and Figure 5). 

This is to be expected, however, since the serum levels 
in fasting animals are only about 20 % of the normal 
levels, and phosphatases from other tissues would con¬ 
tribute relatively more of the total activity. Bone 
is a probable source of some, if not all, of that por¬ 
tion of the serum phosphatase not supplied by the in¬ 
testine. In the course of studies with rachitic rats, 
recently completed in this laboratory, it has been poss¬ 
ible to demonstrate with the above inhibitors that the 
increased serum alkaline phosphatase levels associated

with this condition ahe, in all probability, derived 
from bone* 

There is a significant correlation between the 
intestinal and serum phosphatase levels, when the four 
groups of animals are considered together. While the 
intestinal phosphatase activities of the normal animals 
appear to be lower than those of the starved rats, this 
may be accounted for by the fact that there was a 20% 
loss of weight by the intestine during the starvation 
period of one week* 

With the exception of the liver, the effects 
of each inhibitor on the phosphatase activities of 
the tissues used above show little variation between 
the four groups of animals. The liver has the high¬ 
est phosphatase activity in diabetes, and this is 
somewhat lower in the animals receiving the high fat 
diet, and still lower in the normal and in the starved 
rats. These changes approximately parallel the vari¬ 
ations in levels of the serum enzyme. The inhibition 
of liver phosphatase by cyanide, glutamic acid and 
lysine becomes less as the liver enzyme level decreases, 
and the pattern of inhibition becomes increasingly 
different from that of the serum phosphatase. These 
observations support the view (4, 48, 56) that the 
liver has two alkaline phosphatases. One of these, the

cyanide insensitive "Fraction I" of Cloetens (4), is 
produced in the liver itself, and the other, the cyan¬ 
ide sensitive "Fraction II" of Cloetens, is a result 
of excretion by the liver of serum alkaline phospha¬ 
tase into the bile. As the level of the cyanide sen¬ 
sitive serum phosphatase is decreased, from abnormally 
high to abnormally low values, the proportion and 
amount of the cyanide sensitive phosphatase in the liver 
decreases also*

5* Summary 

The effect of five inhibitors on the alkaline 
phosphatases of the kidney, liver, intestine, bone 
and serum of rats in four different experimental states 
is presented and discussed. The phosphatases of the 
serum and the intestine of diabetic rats and of those 
receiving a high fat diet show similar reactions with 
the inhibitors: their patterns of behaviour are dis- 
dinctly different from those of the other tissues. The 
evidence indicates that the increased serum alkaline 
phosphatase in these two experimental states originates 
in the intestine. In normal and in starved rats, on 
the other hand, the inhibition pattern of the serum 
enzyme does not resemble that of the intestinal enzyme 
as closely as in the preceding two experimental states. 
However, these effects are sufficiently alike to indi¬ 
cate that the major portion of the serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase is derived from the intestine. One or more of 
the other tissues may contribute a small portion to the 
total serum alkaline phosphatase. 

Evidence is presented which supports the hypo¬ 
thesis that the liver has two alkaline phosphatases; 
one is produced in the liver itself and the other ori¬ 
ginates in the serum.

V* ON THE DIETARY COMPONENTS AFFECTING THE ALKALINE 
PHOSPHATASE IN RAT SERUM 

1* Introduction 

The previous sections have shown that the abnor¬ 
mally lowered but constant levels of serum alkaline 
phosphatase, which are characteristic of fasting rats, 
may originate in various tissues, including the intes¬ 
tine. However, the increased amounts of the serum en¬ 
zyme in rats receiving a normal or high fat diet, as 
well as in alloxan diabetic animals, appear to be de¬ 
rived chiefly from the intestine# It has also been es¬ 
tablished that there is a highly significant correlation 
between serum alkaline phosphatase activity and the dai¬ 
ly consumption of food, particularly fat (30)# Since 
the increases: in the serum enzyme over the low, basal 
fasting levels originate from the intestine, the prob¬ 
lem of the functions of intestinal alkaline phosphatase 
might be approached by determining the dietary compon¬ 
ents which are responsible for the increased formation 
of the intestinal enzyme as reflected in the serum* 

The earlier experiments of Weil and Russel (38) 

soluble 

had shown that only the alcohol-ether 1 portion of Purina 
Dog Chow was effective in raising plasma all© line phos¬ 
phatase values of adult rats above the fasting level# 
They tested a large number of substances with respect

to their effect upon starvation phosphatase levels. 
Neither proteins nor carbohydrates had any effect, in 
contrast to Bodanskyte conclusion (20) that only car¬ 
bohydrates would restore the low fasting levels of 
young dogs to normal values. Glycerol, cholesterol, 
sodium B-glycerophosphate, dicarboxylic acids and sat¬ 
urated fatty acids had no effect. Only a few unsatur¬ 
ated fatty acids (oleic, erucic, linoleic and linolen- 
ic) were active in restoring fasting levels of serum 
phosphatase to normal. Elaidic acid, the geometrical 
isomer of oleic acid, was only slightly active, and a 
possible spatial effect was thus indicated. A free car¬ 
boxyl group was found necessary for the effect on fast¬ 
ing levels, since oleic amide and oleyl alcohol were 
inactive. Cephalin restored fasting plasma phosphatase 
values to normal, whereas lecithin did not. 

There is strong evidence (19, 57, 58) that ab¬ 
sorbed fatty acids are changed into phospholipids with¬ 
in the intestinal mucosa and are transported in this 
form in the lymph and plasma (59, 60). Weil and Russel 
believed that the increased plasma alkaline phosphatase 
activity following the ingestion of unsaturated fatty 
acids might be linked with the process of transformation 
of phospholipids to neutral fat within various organs. 
They further felt that saturated fatty acids may have a

different metabolism since they do not affect plasma 
phosphatase levels. The latter suggestion has support 
in the work of Bloom, Chaikoff, Reinhardt and Dauben 
(61), who fed palmitic acid to rats and recovered 96 %, 
of it in the lymph as the free fatty acid. Thus it is 
possible that saturated fatty acids are not transformed 
into phospholipids during intestinal absorption, or at 
least are not transported as such. 

Since it is now known that the increased serum 

alkaline phosphatase activity which results from the 
probably 

feeding of fats is/\derived from the intestine, it seems 
probable that phosphatase functions in the absorption 
of some fatty acids from the intestine. It was decided 
to reinvestigate the problem with larger groups of an¬ 
imals, and to feed them a basal fat free diet supple¬ 
mented with various derived lipids and fat soluble vit¬ 
amins for several weeks.

2. Experimental 

Adult male albino rats weighing at least 250 
grams were placed in individual cages and given food 
and water ad libitum* Serum alkaline phosphatases, 
daily food consumptions and body weights were measured 
once per week* The rats were given ground Purina Fox 
Checkers for one week before taking the ”0 Values n * 
Groups of six rats each were then placed on the diets 
listed below for 4 weeks* All groups were then starved 
for 1 week. 

Diet 1 was the basal fat free diet consisting of 
20$ vitamin free casein (Smaco), 76$ sucrose, 4$ McColl¬ 
um^ Salt Mixture, together with adequate amounts of the 
B-group vitamins; and the fat soluble vitamins in crys¬ 
talline form at the rate of 1.3 mg. vitamin A acetate, 
0.15 mg. calciferol and 133 mg. -tocopherol, per kilo 
of diet. Diet 2 consisted of the basal diet minus the 
fat soluble vitamins. Diets 1 and 2 would thus test the 
effect on serum phosphatase of the fat soluble vitamins 
A, D and E, and the non-fat portions of the diet. The 
remaining diets were devised to test the effect on the 
enzyme of lipid derivatives equivalent to the concentra¬ 
tions which would be present in a diet containing 10$ 
triglyceride. The lipid derivatives were added to the 
basal diet and replaced an equal amount of sucrose.

Diet 3 contained 1.04$ glycerol; diet 4, 9.57$ stearic

ed as a control, consisted of the basal diet with 10$

4. Discussion 

There are no significant differences in food con¬ 
sumption on the basis of which the serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase levels may be interpeted. There is no difference, 
statistically speaking, between the weight gains of the 
six groups of animals for the four weeks on the diets, 
despite the fact that diets 1, 2 and 3 contained no fat 
and diet 2 contained no fat soluble vitamins. This is 
taken as an indication that food consumption was ade¬ 
quate and that the animals were in good health. This 
is a little surprising in the case of the group on the 
diet deficient in fat soluble vitamins. It serves, 
however, as an indication that the animals had a good 
reserve of these vitamins and therefore that only the 
effects of depleting the diet of fat soluble vitamins 
was being tested. No attempt was made to produce vita¬ 
min deficiencies in these rats. The observations made 
above regarding the absence of fat soluble vitamins 
from diet 2 would also apply to the absence of essential 
fatty acids from diets I to 5. 

An analysis of variance of the phosphatase levels 

for the four weeks on the test diets indicates that 

some 

there is a highly significant variation between ; \diets. 
There is, however, no significant variation between diets 
1, 2 and 3. Since there is no difference between the

serum phosphatase values of rats on these diets and the 
same rats after one week of post-dietary starvation 
(Figure 6), it may be said that the fat soluble vitamins 
A, D and E, glycerol, and the non-fat portions of the 
diet do not affect the fasting levels of serum alkaline 
phosphatase* This result agrees with that of Weil and 
Russel (38), who did not, however, test the effect of 
the fat soluble vitamins on fasting serum alkaline phos¬ 
phatase levels* 

There is no significant variation between the 
serum phosphatase levels of the six groups of animals 
aftdr one week of post-dietary starvation. Diets 4, 

5 and 6 produced levels of serum phosphatase which were 
significantly greater than these starvation levels or 
the levels on the first three diets. Stearic acid 
(diet 4) produced an activity greater than the acti¬ 
vity of the enzyme during starvation, although not as 
great as the activity produced by oleic acid (diet 5)* 
The effect of stearic acid, however, did not show up 
immediately, and the phosphatase level after one week 
on diet 4 was the same as the starvation level (Table 
XIII)* This may explain why Weil and Russel (38) did 
not observe any effect from this fatty acid in their 
short term experiments. It would appear from these 
results that alkaline phosphatase may be involved in

the intestinal absorption of stearic and possibly other 
saturated fatty acidf as well as the unsaturated fatty 
acids * 

Both oleic acid and Crisco produced serum alk¬ 
aline phosphatase levels comparable to the normal val¬ 
ues on Checkers (Table XIV and XV and Figure 6)* Oleic 
acid produced a serum phosphatase activity that was 
slightly but significantly greater than the activity 
on the Crisco diet* These results agree with those of 
Weil and Russel (38)*

5* Summary 

Adult rats maintained for 4 weeks on fat free 
diets with or without the fat soluble vitamins A, D and 
E showed a gain of weight equivalent to that of rats on 
diets containing fats and fat soluble vitamins* The fat 
soluble vitamins, glycerol, and the non-fat portions of 
the diet do not produce serum alkaline phosphatase levels 
higher than those found in starvation states. Stearic 
acid produces serum alkaline phosphatase levels higher 
than those resulting from starvation, although not as 
high as the levels produced by oleic acid or "Crisco 11 * 
Thus alkaline phosphatase may be involved in the in¬ 
testinal absorption of saturated fatty acids as well as 
unsaturated fatty acids.
