FOREWORD 


During the spring and summer of 1947 serious 
settlement of the Canadian Pacific Railway Company T s right- 
of-way in the Ville Marie Subdivision took place. Ville 
Marie is approximately 250 miles north-east of Ottawa, 
Ontario, on the east shore of Lake Timiskaming on the 
Ontario-Quebec border. 

The settlement of the roadbed was such as to re¬ 
quire the track to be lifted a total of twenty-one feet in 
one location and between ten and twelve feet in another 
during the 1947 season. 

The soil in this area is a varved clay believed 
to be approximately one hundred feet thick. Between the 
stratum of varved clay and bed rock there is thought to be 
a deposit of gravel, sand or even some boulder clay of 
unknown depth. 

In an attempt to determine the cause of the sub¬ 
sidences, the Canadian Pacific Railway Company consulted 
Dean R. M. Hardy of the Faculty of Engineering at the 
University of Alberta. 

In a letter to the Canadian Pacific Railway 
Company, Dean Hardy wrote, in part, that, "--varved clays 
have been produced in the laboratory in a wet mass of clay 
soil by either an electric potential ^ or an excess 
hydrostatic pressure in the water phase of the soil. In 
the process the clay is fissured, silt particles accumulate 
in the fissures and free water is released which may be

drained from the soil mass. A redaction in volume occurs 
equal to the volume of water removed from the soil. It is 
suggested that all the observed phenomena incidental to the 
subsidences in the Villa Marie area may be explained on the 
basis of the above process being the cause with excess hydro¬ 
static pressures in the water phase the fundamental reason 
for the occurrences. It is probably an oversimplification 
to suggest that an excess hydrostatic pressure alone will 
produce the effect since rather complicated physical kinetic 
relationships probably are involved. However the excess 
hydrostatic pressure may be regarded as the basic reason. 

Accordingly, at the suggestion of Dean H. M. 

Hardy and under his direction, the author undertook a lab¬ 
oratory investigation to produce, if possible, a varved 
structure in a remoulded clay. 

as well as attempting to produce this varved 
structure, the effect of the electrical current on the 
physical properties of the soil, namely, the liquid and 
plastic limits, the plasticity index and the grain size 
of the particles, was determined.

INTRODUCTION 


Up to the present time the science of soil 
mechanics has generally considered soil materials to be 
chemically inert. While this assumption is probably sat¬ 
isfactory in the case of coarse grained soils there is 
reason to believe that some of the most difficult problems 
arising in the case of fine-grained soils must be approach¬ 
ed from the point of view of the mechanics of a chemically 
active rather than an inert material. 

Ralgh E. Grim of the Illinois State Geological 
Society in a paper ^ published in 1942 lists the impor¬ 
tant factors of composition controlling the properties of 
soil materials as follows: 

"1) Clay-mineral composition - the relative 
abundance of the clay-mineral components 
and their particle-size distribution. 

2) Nonclay-mineral composition - the relative 
abundance of each mineral and the size-grade 
distribution of its particles. 

3) Electrolyte content - the amount and kind of 

exchangeable bases and any water-soluble salts. 

4) Organic content - the amount and kind 

5) Miscellaneous textural characteristics such 
as shape of quartz grains, degree of parallel 
orientation of clay-mineral particles, 
silicification, etc." 

From an examination of this list the importance

of physics, cheiaistry and minerology in the study of soil 
as an engineering material is indicated. 

The term "soil mechanics" has been defined as 
the application of the principles of mechanics and hydraul¬ 
ics to engineering soil problems. Since this definition 
does not include the application of the principles of physics 
chemistry and minerology, it has been proposed by Edmund F. 
Preece ^ that the term "geotechnics" be used to designate 
the coordinated application of the principles of mechanics, 
hydraulics, physics, chemistry, and mineralogy to the 
problems associated with the use of soil in engineering. 

This is consistent with the precedent established in Sweden. 

Geotechnics is considered to have come into exis¬ 
tence in 1935 ^ through the application of electricity to 
soils in an attempt to strengthen soils by an electro¬ 
chemical means by the associated conversion of certain ion 
groups, and thus to stabilize their chemical grain struc¬ 
tures permanently by accumulation of insoluble or only 
slightly soluble substances, another application is the 
use of direct electrical currents to effect the drainage 
of fine-grained soils. This latter application was effect¬ 
ively used in Germany during World War II by Dr. Leo 
Casagrande. ^ 

An appreciable amount of physicochemical research 
has already been done in connection with soils, notably in 
the fields of agricultural and ceramic research, which is 
proving very useful to the soils engineer in geotechnical 
work. As in any new field of science, the first step in a

relating to both the principles involved and any applicat¬

Washington District,Corps of Engineers has done a consider¬ 
able amount of work in compiling this data and has pub¬ 
lished a paper on the subject in the Proceedings, Highway 
Research Board, Volume Z7 (1947), entitled "Geotechnics 
and Geotechnical Research". This paper by Mr. Preece has 
been the background for much of the theoretical portion 
of this thesis.

DISCUSSION OF THE THEORETICAL BASIS 


OF THE INVESTIGATION 

It is proposed to present the theory of phys¬ 
icochemical reactivities and electrokinetics starting from 
the fundamental concepts of physical chemistry. Ions, space 
lattices, base exchange, and electrosmosis are presented 
principally from a structural rather than a chemical point 
of view. 

As stated in the introduction the basis of this 
discussion is a paper entitled, tf Geotechnics and Geotechnical 
Research,” by E. F. Preece. ^) 

PHYSICOCHEMICAL REACTIVITIES :- 

Atomic and Molecular Compounds - An atom consists 
of a nucleus around which electrons are arranged in an orderly 
manner in a series of orbits. 

Electrons are unit negative electrical charges 
and the number of electrons associated with a particular 
atom is equal to the total positive charge possessed by that 
atom. The total positive charge, all of which resides in the 
nucleus, is equal to the atomic number of the element and 
this, in turn, is a unique property of each individual element 
Since an atom has an equality of positive and negative charges 
it is electrically neutral. 

Atoms which have complete outermost orbits are 
stable and are the inert elements. An outermost orbit is 
complete when it contains eight electrons, with the except¬ 
ion of helium which is complete with two electrons.

Atoms which do not have a complete outermost orbit 
are chemically active and they tend to gain stability by 
acquiring completeness. This may be accomplished by yield¬ 
ing, gaining or sharing electrons. Generally, if there is but 
one or two electrons in the outer orbit the atom tends to yield 
these atoms and thus make the next inner complete orbit its 
outermost one. If the atom has more then four, it tends 
to gain enough additional electrons to complete its outermost 
orbit. 

The third way of acquiring completeness is by shar¬ 
ing electrons. Energy is required to remove an electron 
from its orbit and when the outer orbit has three or four 
electrons the available energy is generally inadequate to 
accomplish the removal. In such a case the atoms tend to 
share electrons. 

Examples of these three ways of acquiring com¬ 
pleteness are illustrated in Figure 1. Sodium chloride is 
an example where sodium acquires completeness of Its outer¬ 
most orbit by yielding an electron, and chlorine acquires 
completeness by gaining the electron yielded by the sodium. 
Carbon tetrachloride is an example of sharing of electrons. 

Three terms that occur very frequently in the 
following discussion are associated with the foregoing re¬ 
actions. These are ion, molecule, and valence and are de¬ 
fined as follows: 

1) Ion - When an atom (which is always electrically 
neutral) loses or gains electrons, as in the form¬ 
ation of sodium chloride, it is called an ion.

An ion has a net positive or a net negative 

charge depending on whether it loses or gains 

electrons. Ions retain their individual iden¬ 
tity, i.e., they do not unite structurally to 
form a molecule. 

2) Molecules - When atoms share electrons the atomic 
structures must merge at the shared electrons. 
Combination by sharing, then, results in second¬ 
ary structures, i.e., molecules. Since no electrons 
are lost or gained in this process the atoms re¬ 
main electrically neutral and the molecule, therefore, 
does not have a charge. It will have one or more 
unsatisfied valences however, if it does not complete 
its outer orbit which will behave in many respects 
similar to a charge. 

3)Valence - The number of electrons which an element 
must yield, gain or share in order to complete 
its outermost orbit is known as the valence of 
that element. If the atom loses electrons and 
acquires a net positive charge it has a positive 
valence and vice versa if the atom gains electrons. 

Generally, it will be more convenient to regard ions 
in terms of charge rather than valence and to reserve the latter 
term in reference to molecules. The excess charge on an ion 
and an unsatisfied valence on a molecule may both be thought of 
as the source of electrostatic attractive forces. 

Compounds composed of ions are called ionic or electro- 
valent compounds. The individual ions are arranged side by

electrostatic forces called, in this case, electrovalent 
bonds. If the electrovalent bonds are broken, as happens 
when the compound is dissolved, the individual ions become 
independently mobile, i.e., they are free to move about in 
solution. This separation of the ions is called dissociation 
and the individual ions are said to be dissociated.

Compounds composed of molecules are called molecular 
or covalent compounds. Both the atoms composing the molecules 
and the molecules themselves are held together by electro¬ 
static forces called covalent bonds. 

When atoms combine covalently the electrons may be 
closer to one than the other atomic nuclei of the molecule. 

In such a case the electrical centre of all the negative 
charges may not coincide with the electrical centre of all

the positive charges. This relative displacement of the 
two electrical centres will result in a moment of electrical 
force called a dipole moment. The water molecule is a typic¬ 
al example, Figure 2. A molecule which has a dipole moment

is called a dipole and it behaves as though it were a small 
bar magnet, positive at one end and negative at the other. 

In the vicinity of a positive or a negative ion, i.e., in an 
electrostatic field of force, these dipoles tend to orient 
themselves as indicated in Figure 3.

When dissociated ions are in an electrical field 
the positive ions tend to migrate to the cathode and the 
negative ions to the anode because of the charge which they 
individually carry. It is this migration which transports 
the electrical current through the solution, hence, ionic 
compounds are electrolytes. Molecules, on the other hand, 
having no net charge, tend to orient themselves rather than 
migrate in an electrical field, consequently molecular com¬ 
pounds, e.g., water, generally are non-electrolytes. 

Space Lattice - When ions or molecules combine to 
form a crystalline solid, and clays are crystalline, they 
tend to group themselves in that geometrical arrangement 
which will result in the greatest possible degree of electric¬ 
al neutralization, i.e., so that the electrostatic forces 
will be balanced within the structure. The most elementary 
grouping of this sort is called a unit cell. 

The principal constituents of the lattices of the 
various clay minerals are the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron and 
the aluminum-hydroxyl octahedron, illustrated in Figure 4. 
Bonded together by electrostatic forces these cells produce 
the elementary lattice structures called the tetrahedral 
silicon sheet, Figure 5, and the gibbsite sheet, Figure 6. 

Consider the silicon-oxygen tetrahedron, Figure 
4. Bach of the four plus valences of the silicon atom is 
satisfied by a single covalent bond to each one of the four 
oxygen atoms. Each oxygen atom, however, has one unsatisfied 
negative nalence and the surface of the cell will, therefore,

exert an attractive electrostatic force on any atoms or ions 
in its environment having an unsatisfied positive valence or 
positive charge respectively. If, on the other hand, the 
tetrahedron could exchange its oxygen atoms for hydroxyl units, 
each of which has a valence of minus one, the tetrahedron 
would become electrically neutral and consequently indifferent 
to other ions or atoms. 

Both Figures 5 and 6 illustrate an additional source 
of unbalanced electrostatic forces. In both figures the atoms 
at the ends of the sheets have unsatisfied valences simply 
because there are no adjacent atoms. A similar situation 
would exist if the silicon atoms'of Figure 5 were located in 
a surface and, as a result of this, the four upper oxygen 
atoms were absent. 


Thus it can be seen that the electrostatic forces

environment are due principally to unbalanced charges or 
unsatisfied valences located in the surfaces, edges and 
corners of the particle. Since surfaces, edges and corners 
are structural discontinuities it may be stated that the 
greater the number of discontinuities for a given volume of 
matter the more active the matter will be electrostatically. 




In other words the greater the number of discontinuities per 
unit volume, the more active the matter will be electrochem- 
ically and, consequently, the more the physicochemical cha¬ 
racteristics will determine the mechanical properties of the 
matter. 

Clay Minerals - Based upon the character of their 
lattice structure, clay minerals may be classified in three 
groups, each group taking its name from its principle member.

has an equality of plus and minus valences 
and, in addition, there is considerable af¬ 
finity between the adjacent oxygen and hy¬ 
droxyl layers at the interfaces beti^een lat¬

to tight bonding, not only within the indivi¬ 
dual lattices, but also between adjacent 
lattices. 

Due to this tight bonding, water is not 
adsorbed between the lattice sheets of the 
minerals of the kaolinite group, ^

amount of water may vary considerably, as a 
result of which the overall thickness of a 
lattice may vary more than one hundred percent.

however, by the addition of potassium atoms in the 
interface between adjacent lattices. Some of the 
aluminum of the gibbsite sheet, also, may be re¬ 
placed by iron or magnesium. The overall structure 
is relatively strong and water cannot penetrate 
in the interfacial zones. With respect to stru¬ 
ctural strength iliite lies between the stronger 
kaolinite and the weaker montmorillonite. 

The basal cleavage planes of the three types of clay 
minerals lie in the interfaces between adjacent lattices, 
designated B - B in each of the illustrations. Separation 
along these planes does not result in the breaking of the va¬ 
lence bonds, consequently this form of separation does not 
tend to increase the total surface attractive forces. 
Fracturing parallel to the C - C lines, Figure 7, & and 9 
always accompanies basal cleavage plane separation, however. 
These fractures must severe valence bonds and thereby in¬ 
crease the number of unsatisfied valences. Edges of clay 
particles, then, are much greater contributors to the electro¬ 
static forces than are the cleavage surfaces. 

Relative particle size is an especially important 
factor since the total surface area increases tremendously as 
a given volume of matter is reduced progressively to smaller 
and smaller particles. Other things being equal the number 
of unsatisfied valences should be proportional to the total 
surface area.

Solid-Liquid Interface Reactivity - The surface 
of a solid, as has been explained, is the seat of electro¬ 
static forces that manifest themselves in a number of pro¬ 
cesses which, collectively, are generally called ’'capillary 
chemistry”. In soil mechanics the term capillary has a very 
specific meaning and, in order to avoid confusion, the term 
interface reactivities is used here to designate these pro¬ 
cesses. 

Free surface energy is the work that must be done 
to increase the surface area of a liquid against the force 
of surface tension. Since a liquid tends to diminish its 
surface area it follows that the free surface energy tends 
to be as small as possible. 

A solution can diminish its free surface energy 
in two ways, either by diminishing its surface area or by 
a change in the concentration of the solute in the boundary 
film of the solution. This latter process is called ”ad¬ 
sorption” . With respect to a solid-liquid interface this may 
be described as the tendency of the solid to attach to its 
surface a layer of the solute from the solution with which 
it is in contact resulting in a greater concentration of the 
solute in this layer than in the bulk solution. 

Assume that a crystalline solid, such as a clay 
mineral particle, is in contact with an electrolytic solution. 
The solvent in this case will be water and the solute will 
be the dissociated ions. There will be a tendency for the 
solid to adsorb ions on its surface, i.e., at the solid-liquid 
interface, such that the concentration of ions in this

vicinity will be greater than it is well out in the body 
of the liquid beyond the influence of the interfacial forces. 

When a clay mineral is fractured normal to the 
cleavage planes, such as along the line C - C of Figure ?, 3 
or 9, unsaturated valences, both positive and negative result. 
Since there is an equality of positive and negative ions in 
a solution it might be expected that the anions, the negative 
ions, would be adsorbed by the unsaturated positive valences 
and the cations, the positive ions, by the valences in es¬ 
sentially equal amounts. However, this is not the case and 
may be explained by the Fajans-Hahn law, which postulates 
that such ions are preferential!}/ attracted that can be in¬ 
corporated into the lattice structure, or, in other words, ions 
of the same kind as those already in the lattice structure.^7) 
Furthermore, nature always tends to produce matter having the 
smallest possible amount of free surface energy and, of two 
possible combinations, that producing the least soluble com¬ 
pound has the least free energy. Adsorption of ions by a 
solid from a solution is, therefore, a preferential process. 

The layer of ions that is preferentially adsorbed 
by the solid should be visualized as a rigid layer of ions 
the thickness of which is variable and depends largely upon 
the nature of the ions, the strength of the electrostatic 
forces, and the amount of adsorbed water. The itfater is pre¬ 
ferentially adsorbed in a manner very similar to the prefer¬ 
ential adsorption of ions, due to the dipole nature of the 
water molecule. 

In a manner similar to that in which the electro¬ 
static forces emanating from the surface 0 f the solid attract

to it any compatible ions in its environment, this adsorbed 
layer in turn attracts oppositely charged ions called count¬ 
er ions. Both attractive and repulsive forces exist in the 
environment, however, and the counter ions tend to form a 
layer separated from the adsorbed layer of greater or lesser 
depth. The adsorbed layer and the counter layer, also refer¬ 
red to as the diffuse layer, are generally known as the 
double layer. Since the two sides of this double layer are 
of opposite sign a potential difference must exist across 
them and it is this potential difference that is largely res¬ 
ponsible for the variations observed in those properties 
which are associated with the solid-liquid interface reac¬ 
tivities of which plasticity is an example. 

From a practical point of view both the counter 
layer and the rigid layer include negative and positive ions. 
One sign, however, is predominant in each layer and is op¬ 
posite in the two layers. In order to avoid complicated 
qualifications which would serve no useful purpose, the layers 
are discussed here as though they were composed of their 
predominant ions alone. 

Ionic or Base Exchange - A clay particle may be 
pictured as being made up of numerous layers of lattice 
sheets. The interfaces between these stacked lattice sheets 
are called the secondary interfaces as distinguished from 
the overall outer surface or primary interface. 

If the clay particle is suspended in an ionic 
solution in which an adequate supply of ions are available 
a double layer will be formed wherever there are unsaturated

valences on the surface of the particle. If the particle is 
kaolinite, Figure 7, there will be little if any double 
layer formation on the secondary interfaces because both the 
hydroxyl and the oxygen atoms are saturated. There will be 
broken bonds and, consequently, unsaturated valences at the 
edge surfaces however, and while the primary interface as a 
whole will not, the edge surfaces will have an appreciable 
double layer. 

In the case of montmorillonite particles, Figure $, 
as was stated previously, some of the silicon or aluminum 
atoms may be replaced by atoms of different valence upset¬ 
ting the electrical neutrality of the lattice. Unsaturated 
valences may, therefore, exist in the cleavage surfaces of 
the primary interface. Moreover, water can enter between 
the lattices at the secondary interfaces. Thus with mon¬ 
tmorillonite the double layer formation occurs on the primary 
interface as a whole and also at the secondary interfaces. 

The illite particle, Figure 9, does have unsat¬ 
urated valences at the secondary interfaces but these are 
Glanced by the potassium ions. The cleavage areas of the 
primary interfaces, however, are more or less active as are 
the edge surfaces. Therefore, the double layer is associated 
with the primary interface as a whole. 

Up to this point it has been assumed that the ionic 
solution in contact with the solid has only two kinds of ions, 
one of which is preferentially adsorbed and the other forms 
the counter layer. If the original solution is replaced by 
one containing entirely different ions, the new ions will

replace the ions of the original double layer either in 
whole or in part if such replacement will result in a de¬ 
crease inthe degree of hydration or in a lower net charge. 
This is called "base exchange ,T . 

There a re three types of base exchange which 
may be classified as follows: 

1) Exchange within the lattice structure; 

11) Exchange external to the lattice, 

a. At the primary and secondary interfaces, 

* 

b. At the primary interface only, 

c. At the edge surfaces only; and, 

111) Upon negative organic groups. 

The replacement of the aluminum or silicon atoms 
in the montmorillonite and illite lattices is an example 
of the first type and, quantitatively, it is relatively un¬ 
important with respect to base exchange capacity. The second 
type of base exchange is that discussed at the beginning of 
this section. Montmorillonite, illite and kaolinite are 
examples of the three sub-types a, b and c respectively. The 
third type may be omitted since only inorganic materials are 
being considered here. 

As might be expected from what has been said the 
base exchange capacities of the three mineral groups should 
follow the series kaolinite< illite <montmorillonite. The 
average limits are given in Table 1. 

The ease with which ions in the double layer may 
be exchanged depends, among other things, on how firmly they 
are held in place. This in turn depends upon the strength

of the electrostatic forces holding them and the size of the 
ions, small ions being more firmly held thorn large ones. 

The ionic size to be considered in this case is the size of 
the hydrated ion, i. e., the ion together with its adsorbed 
husk, rather than its atomic size.

Base exchange with respect to soil is essentially 
a solid-liquid interface reactivity. Since the total inter¬ 
facial area for a given volume is a function of particle 
size it follows that the greater the interface-volume ratio 
the greater the exchange capacity, other things being equal. 
It is well known that the base exchange capacity of a sand 
is a negligible quantity and that the exchange capacity of 
colloidal particles may be very high. Somewhere between 
these two limits is a boundary between soils having import¬ 
ant interface reactivit 3 ^ and those that do not. To dis¬ 
tinguish them they ma 3 ^ be called fine-grained and coarse¬ 
grained. This -boundary between fine-grained active and 
coarse-grained inert soils has tentatively been established 
to be at a grain size of approximately 30 microns (0.03 mm.) 
or at an interface-volume ratio of 200.

ELECTROKINETICS: - 

The solid-liquid interface reactivities so far 
considered, i.e., ionic exchange, adsorption, free surface 
energy, etc., might be thought of-as static reactivities 
because they do not depend on a relative displacement of 
the solid and liquid phases. The electrokinetic phenomena, 
on the^other hand, are always associated with the relative 
displacement of one phase with respect to the other and may, 
therefore, be considered to be dynamic reactivities. 

"In any system whatever containing matter in two 
phases with different charges, the application of ; an electric 
field causes one phase to travel relatively to the other, 
the negatively charged phase moving to the positive pole, 
and the positively charged one to the negative pole. This 
motion is called ’electrokinetic 1 . The rate of relative 
motion of the two phases is proportional to the intensity 
of the applied field; it also depends on the size and shape 
of the objects, on the properties of the fluid, and on the 
structure of the double layer, particularly on a certain 
potential, which will be described in more detail presently, 
called the zeta potential." 

In the discussion of the formation of the double 
layer it was brought out that the adsorbed layer at the 
solid-liquid interface was rigid. This rigid layer is con¬ 
sidered to be fixed and, therefore, any movement of one 
phase relative to the other must take place against the 
face of the fixed la 3 /er rather than against the face of the 
solid.

Helmholtz presented the first mathematical treat¬ 
ment of the double layer in which the double layer was re¬ 
garded as an electric condenser, the potential of which was 
generally termed electrokinetic or zeta potential. It was 
assumed that the layer consisted of two parts, one located at 
a monomoleculafc distance in the liquid surrounding the particle, 
the other being firmly attached to the wall or surface of the 
solid phase. The former part located in the liquid was con¬ 
sidered movable. (7) 

The modern mathematical treatment is still based 
upon the assumptions of Helmholtz but the concept of the 
structure of the double layer has been modified considerably. 

The present theory was developed by Gouy and Freundlich and 
is known as Gouy T s diffuse double la 3 ^er theory. It pictures 
the rigid layer as being relatively thin and attached to the 
surface of the solid phase, and the diffuse or counter layer 
extending outward from the attached layer into theliquid 
phase a varying distance. The first is represented by the 
dimension A in Figures 10 and 11 and the second by dimension 
B. The boundary between them is also the boundary between 
the immobile and the mobile water. 

The maximum potential difference between a solid 
and the solution with which it is in contact is called the 
thermodynamic potential. This should be visualized as a 
potential difference between the bulk of the solid and the 
liquid, respectively, well beyond the zone of influence of 
the double layer. 

The quantitative relationship between the zeta

There is a sharp decrease of potential across the 
rigid layer and a more gradual decrease across the diffuse 
layer. The zeta potential is that portion of the^otential 
drop that exists between the boundary separating.the rigid 
and diffuse layers on one side and the outer limit of the 
diffuse layer on the other. 

It may be seen that the zeta potential must depend 
quantitatively upon the total potential, the thickness of the 
adsorbed layer, and the thickness of the diffuse layer<> The

total potential, in turn, depends upon the character of the 
solid and the solution with which it is in contact. 

The thickness of the adsorbed layer, as has been 
stated, depends upon the nature of the adsorbed ions, the 
strength of the electrostatic forces and the amount of ad¬ 
sorbed water. It also depends to some extent upon the con¬ 
centration of ions in the bulk of the solution. 

When the concentration of the solution is increased 
there is an increase in the number of counter ions, partic¬ 
ularly in the vicinity of the diffuse side of the boundary. 
Any increase in the number of ions in the diffuse layer tends 
to decrease the effective thickness of both the rigid and 
the diffuse layers. This is accompanied by a decrease in 
the zeta potential. 

If the concentration is made great enough the sign 
of the zeta potential may be reversed. This may be due to a 
neutralization of the charge on the particle or to such a 
decrease in the thickness of the double layer that it even¬ 
tually collapses and reforms with the charges reversed. 

The electrokinetic phenomena may be classified 
conveniently in two systems, first, with respect to the 
movable and the stationary phases sometimes called the Sta- 
tionary Phase System and, second, with respect to whether an 
electromotive force is applied externally or developed inter¬ 
nally, sometimes called the EMlF System. These two systems 
are outlined in Table II. 

When an external emf is applied across a solid- 
liquid interface the movable diffuse layer of the double

layer is displaced with respect to the fixed layer. This 
is "electrosmosis". If this movement occurs in a capillary 
the water in the capillary is dragged Along with the moving 
diffuse layer and a thread of water is discharged from the 
capillary. This is electrosmosmotic flow in its simplest 
terms.

As pointed out earlier, the rate of relative motion, 
thus the rate of discharge of liquid, for a given external 
emf must depend upon the magnitude of the zeta potential which 
in turn is dependent upon the relative balance of the several 
factors that enter into the development of the double layer. 
Therefore any of the factors that tend to reduce the zeta pote¬ 
ntial also tend to reduce the rate of electrosm tic flow, and 
if the zeta potential collapses the flow will cease, and if 
the zeta potential is reversed the direction of flow is also 
reversed. 

If the liquid in a capillary is caused to move by 
hydrostatic pressure the boundary of the moving liquid is at 
the boundary between the fixed and diffuse layers. A ta¬ 
ngential displacement of the diffuse layer with respect to 
the fixed layer results in an emf being produced. 

It was pointed out earlier that the mathematics of 
the electrokinetic phenomena as derived by Helmholtz is based 
upon the assumption that the fixed and diffuse layers are 
similar to the parallel plates of a condenser spaced a distance, 
d , apart and each of which carries a charge, e , per unit 
area. The space between the hypothetical plates is occupied 
by a liquid having a dielectric constant, D , and the potential 
between the plates is $ , the zeta potential. Using these 
terms the fundamental relationship upon which the quantitative 
treatment of all the electrokinetic phenomena are based may 
be written,

this fundamental equation only two will be discussed, the 
volume of electrosmotic flow and the pressure—zeta potential 
relationship. These are the most important with respect to 
fine-grained soil problems at the present time. 

In addition to the foregoing nomenclature the follow¬ 
ing symbols are also used, 

Ele ” applied potential gradient (electrosmosis) 

- developed potential (streaming potential) 

- coefficient of viscosity of the liquid, 
q - area of a group of capillaries. 

V - volume of electrosmotic flow in a given time, 
p - hydrostatic pressure difference between the 
two ends of the flow area. 

L ~ length of the flow area. 

§ - zeta or electrokinetic potential. 

v _ qgEe-P 

4fr 


and, 

? = Tffou 

From these equations it is seen that the electros¬ 
motic flow is directly/ - proportional to the area, the product 
of the applied and zeta potentials, and the dielectric con¬ 
stant. It is inversely proportional to the viscosity of the 
liquid and independent of the length of the flow path. 

The zeta potential is usually derived from a measured 
discharge volume, but it is believed that the streaming 
potential would provide an equally suitable and perhaps a 
better means of determining the quantity.

It has been pointed out by Hans F. Winterkorn 
that the above theory deals with pure electrosmotic flow, 
"i.e., one in which the electricity is carried solely by the 
molecules of the liquid dielectric, ouch pure electrosmosis 
does not exist in normal, soils possessing exchangeable cations 
and dissolved electrolytes. These ions, participate in the 
electric conductance and in water transfer, the water yield 
becoming less with increasing electric conductance of the 
soil moisture. The exchangeable ions are carried away in 
the process and are replaced by hydrogen ions. tf Thus It may 
be concluded that the simple theory of Helmholtz must be 
revised before it- can be applied practically.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND SPURGE Off SOIL SAMPLES 

Three sets of soil samples were obtained from the 
Canadian Pacific Railway Company’s right-of-way in the Ville 
Marie Subdivision. These soils have been called Soils 1, 2, 
and 3. A fourth soil, Soil 4, was prepared from soil available 
in the soil mechanics laboratory at the University of Alberta. 

A brief description of these four soils follows: 

Soil 1 - a distinctly varved clay light in color, removed 

from an escarpment caused by subsidence. It repre¬ 
sents a 21-inch vertical section pictured in Figure 
12 as samples numbered four to seven. Sample 4 was 
taken from the bottom of the section, the top of 
which was about 30 inches below the surface of the 
ground. The sample was taken from beside the track 
at Mile 3. 

Soil 2 - a mixture of samples of a blue clay showing a slight 
varved structure, possibly considerably disturbed 
due to subsidence. These samples are pictured in 
Figure 12 as samples 8, 9, and 12. Samples 8 and 
9 represent a portion of a 23-inch vertical section 
about i mile south of the track at Mile 7, also in 
a sunken area. The source of sample 12 is not known. 
Soil 3 - a distinctly varved clay very similar in appearance 
to Soil 1. This soil was forwarded to the soils 
laboratory in December of 1948 at the request of 
Dean Hardy. The exact source of Soil3 is not known. 
Soil 4 - consists of a 50-50 mixture by weight of a loess

DEVELOPMENT 0? THI ELECTRO SMOSI3 EOITIPNENT 

In describing the development of the electrosmosis 
cell frequent reference will be made to Plates 7, 8 and 9 
enclosed in the envelope on the inside of the back cover of 
this book. Plate 7 shows the details and assembly of the 
electrosmosis cell, Plate 8 shows the various lucite cylin¬ 
ders used in the development of the equipment, Plate 9 is 
a drawing of the loading apparatus used to keep the electrodes 
in contact with the soil as the test was in progress. 

In order to prevent metallic salts from going into 
solution by electrolytic action the cell was designed in such 
a way that no metal surface was in contact with the soil or 
the water in the cell. In order to accomplish this that 
portion of each end plate inside the cylinder was faced with 
a J-inch thick, lucite disk fastened to the end plate with 
lucite screws. The piston rods were made from |-inch di¬ 
ameter lucite rod with 1/8-inch diameter brass rods in the 
centre of them to provide an electrical conductor from the 
outside source of electrical power to the electrodes. To 
insure a good contact between the electrodes and the brass 
rods, brass compression springs were placed between the ends 
of the brass rods and the electrodes. 

The electrodes themselves were originally made of 
carbon, turned to size from a carbon rod, cut to a thickness 
of i-inch, and then perforated with 1/16-inch drill holes as 
shown on Plate 7. 


Uarbon was chosen for the electrodes since it was

thought that carbon would be less likely to go into solution 
than any other conducting material with the exception of 
platinum. Due to the excessive cost of platinum electrodes 
this possibility was discarded. 

These carbon electrodes were used in Tests 1, 2, 
and 3. At the end of Test 3 it was found that the carbon 
electrode used as the cathode was covered with a thin "glaze". 
This glaze also covered the perforations, forming a small 
bead over each of the holes, thus cutting off any further 
possible drainage of the soil specimen. The carbon electrode 
used as the anode was found to be in a very disintegrated 
state since the oxygen released at the anode, due to the 
electrolysis of the water, combined with the carbon to form 
carbon dioxide. 

Since hydrogen was formed at the cathode, which 
would not combine with metals and take salts of the metal 
into solution, it was thought that using a cathode made of 
steel would have no adverse effects on the test and might 
overcome the trouble caused by the formation of the glaze. 

This was subsequently tried and found auite successful. There 
was a slight glaze formed, however, in the case of Test 7. 

The use of steel for both electrodes would result in 
the oxygen, released at the anode, combining with the iron in 
the steel and going into solution, with the possibility of it 
reacting with the soil as an exchangeable base. As it was 
desired to keep the chemical changes taking place in the soil 
to a minimum it was decided to continue using the carbon as 
the anode and replace it as necessary.

Some difficulty was encountered in trying to find 
a satisfactory way of getting rid of the gases formed at the 
electrodes. The original cylinder used in Tests 1 and E 
is shown as Figure (a) on Plate 8. It contained an opening 
A in the lower part of the cylinder at the anode end to pro¬ 
vide a connection to a constant head water supply. Openings 
B and C were made in the top of the cylinder at both ends to 
provide for the escape of the gases and also for the removal 
of the water drained from the soil at the cathode. These 
three openings were machined to provide seats for inverted 
flare fittings. To the gas opening B at the anode end a 
short length of 3/16-inch outside saran tubing was attached 
of a length such that its opening was somewhat above the level 
of the constant head water supply. The saran tubing on the 
cathode end was long enough to lead to a 50 millilitre grad¬ 
uate to collect the water drained from the soil. The open 
end of this tube was placed at the same elevation as the 
constant level water supply so there would be no hydraulic 
head difference between the two ends of the test specimen. 

Test 1 and Test E were made with a potential drop 
across the soil specimen of 106 volts and 105 volts respect¬ 
ively. At these voltages a considerable quantity of heat 
was developed which caused the lucite cylinder to soften. 

The cylinder became distorted and free movement of the pistons 
became impossible. It was therefore necessary to make a new 
cylinder. 

The 3/16-inch diameter saran tubing used for gas 
release openings in the original cylinder did not provide 
free passage for the gases. The gas escaping at the anode

end carried with it some water which splashed over the 
equipment. The gas at the cathode end partially filled 
the gas release tube thus causing a somewhat lower hydro¬ 
static head to exist at the cathode than at the anode.' As 
a consequence the second cylinder was modified somewhat to 
overcome these difficulties, Figure (b) , Plate 8. 

The gas release tubes on the second cylinder were 
made of lg-inch outside diameter Incite tubing and were 
fitted with overflow outlets as shown in the figure. The 
constant head water supply connected to the anode end was 
maintained at the same elevation as the overflow outlets. 

This cylinder adequately provided for the escape of the gases, 
maintained a constant hydrostatic head on both ends of the 
soil specimen, and provided a convenient outlet for the water 
drained from the soil, and consequently was used in the re¬ 
maining tests where free drainage of the soil specimen was 
desired. 

In order to make the cell water tight a rubber 
gasket was placed in the recess in the end plates between 
the lucite cylinder and the end plates. The gasket was made 
by pouring liquid latex into the recess and allowing it to 
harden. To prevent leakage of water past the pistons a gland 
was provided in each of the end plates. The gland packing 
consisted of a length of jute twine, well coated with vaseline, 
placed in the gland seat provided. 

An assembly drawing of the electrosmosis cell used 
for the free drainage tests is shown on Plate 7 together with 
detailed drawings of the various parts.

The cell, when loaded and ready for testing, was 
placed in the loading apparatus shown on Plate 9 in the 
position indicated by the dotted outline. Load was applied 
to the pistons through the loading yoke which was pulled 
horizontally along the guide rods by means of the weights 
suspended by fine cables over the two pulleys fastened to the 
wooden support. The leads from the source of electric current 
made contact with the brass centres in the piston rods by 
means of the brass tips on the ends of the piston rods which 
were in turn insulated from the loading apparatus by the 
lucite loading caps. 

In order to measure the consolidation of the soil 

specimen an Ames dial was supported by the dial yoke clamped 

« 

to the guide rods. This dial measured the amount the* loading 
yoke moved which in turn was equal to the decrease in the 
length of the soil specimen. 

Since both pistons could move with consolidation 
of the soil it was necessary to know the distance the cathode 
piston moved in order to get a true value for the amount of 
water drained from the soil. A volume equal to the volumetric 
displacement of the cathode piston must be filled with water 
drained from the specimen, and this volume must be added to 
the volume of water in the graduate to determine the actual 
quantity drained from the soil. To do this a hole was dril¬ 
led in the base plate of the loading apparatus and fitted 
with a thumb screw to hold a second Ames dial. The stem of 
the .Ames dial was in contact with the end plate (cathode end) 
of the electrosmosis cell, thus any movement of the cathode

piston was registered on this dial. This dial was later 
eliminated and the distance between the end plate and the 
base plate was measured to the nearest 0.01-inch by means 
of a steel rule. This distance was recorded in the data as 
the Tt x-distance. TT 

The third cylinder used, Figure c of Plate 8, was 
developed in an attempt to retard the movement of water 
through the soil specimen and increase the movement of the 
soil particles, that is, decrease the rate of electrosmosis 
and increase the rate of electrophoresis. 

The third cylinder was made by modifying the 
previous one somewhat. The gas escape tube on the anode 
end of cylinder b was removed and replaced by a 2§-inch 
outside diameter lucite tube to act as a gas collection 
chamber. The top of this tube was covered with a f-inch 
thick lucite plate which was drilled and tapped to accomo¬ 
date two i-inch needle valves. This end of the cylinder 
then became the cathode end and the gas escape tube was left 
on the other end to allow the carbon dioxide formed at the 
anode to escape. 

The opening A, now at the cathode end, was used to 
connect the cylinder to the pressure measurement apparatus 
in order to measure the pressures developed at the cathode. 
The two valves on the gas collection chamber were used to 
replace the gas in the chamber with water by forcing water 
under pressure into the chamber through one valve and driving 
the gas out through the second. 


The first instrument used for measuring the pressure

developed was a mercury manometer made of 1/8-inch outside 
diameter saran tubing, and capable of measuring pressures 
equivalent to seven feet of mercury. The l/8-inch diameter 
tubing was used since it was suitable for measuring pressures 
over a comparatively large range with small changes in 
volume,' thus requiring a minimum amount of water to be 
drained from the specimen to replace the volume of mercury 
in the manometer tube as the pressure increased. 

In Test 11, however, the pressure developed was 
greater than seven feet of mercury and the mercury was blown 
out of the manometer. It was, therefore, necessary to pro¬ 
vide an instrument capable of measuring larger pressures. 

The instrument used was a Crosby pressure gauge capable of 
measuring pressures up to fourteen kilograms per square 
centimetre. This gauge was found to be quite satisfactory. 

Since the cathode end of the soil specimen was 
under pressure and the anode end not, it was necessary to 
provide some means of preventing the pressure from forcing 
the soil specimen to the anode end of the cylinder and 
possibly forcing the soil up the gas escape tube. This 
was done by placing a li-inch length of f-inch outside 
diameter tenite tube around the piston rod between the end 
plate of the electrosmosis cell and the anode piston. 

The electrical equipment and. connections were 
the same for both free drainage and restricted drainage. 

The direct current electrical power was supplied from the 
University Power Plant at 110 volts. 

The electrical circuit is shown in Figure 13.

TESTING- PROCEDURE 
Preliminary Procedure and Tests 

The four soils used in this investigation were 
air-dried and broken down to pass a number 10 sieve. Each 
of the soils was thoroughly mixed and a representative 
sample of each was taken to run classification tests on. 

The remainder of the soil was stored in paper bags until 
needed for testing. 

The following classification tests were made on 
each soil according to the standard procedure for the tests 
as used in the soil mechanics laboratory at the University 
of Alberta: 

(1) Liquid limit, 

(£) Plastic limit, 

(3) Hydrometer analysis, and 

(4) Specific gravity. 

Procedure for the Electrokinetic Tests 

Approximately 600 grams of the air-dried soil was 
weighed out and a quantity of distilled water added from 10 
to £0 per cent greater than the liquid limit of the soil. 

The soil and water were then mixed until a smooth paste was 
obtained. This soil-water mixture was then placed in the 
moist room, covered to prevent evaporation and allowed to 
stand for at least twelve hours before being transferred to 
the electrosmosis cell. 

The soil paste, after the soaking period, was again 
thoroughly mixed to obtain a uniform moisture content through-

out the sample before it was transferred to the electro- 
smosis cell. The anode end of the cell was placed on the 
cylinder with the piston lj to 2 inches inside the cylinder. 
The anode was covered with a disk of filter paper 2 5/8 
inches in diameter to prevent soil from plugging the drainage 
holes in the piston. The cylinder was then supported in a 
vertical position and the soil paste placed into the cylinder 
in l| to 2-inch layers to a depth of approximately 6 inches. 
Each of these layers was carefully tamped to remove as much 
air from the soil paste as possible. A sample of this soil 
paste was placed in a petrie dish and its moisture content 
determined in order that the void ratio of the soil in the 
cylinder could be computed, assuming the voids to be com¬ 
pletely filled with water. 

A second filter paper disk was placed on the surface 
of the soil and then a disk, also 2 5/8 inches in diameter, 
cut from iron window screening was placed on the filter paper. 
The cathode piston and end plate were then put in place and 
the two end plates fastened together by the J-inch diameter 
rods. These rods were tightened uniformly, care being taken 
to make sure that the end plates were parallel to each other 
by carefully measuring the distance between the two plates 
at various points on their circumference. 

The cell was then placed in the loading apparatus 
and the electrical connections were made as shown in figure 
13. The circuit was left open at this point. An initial 
load of 10 pounds was applied to the specimen and the Ames 
dials were adjusted to measure the consolidation of the soil 
sample.

The procedure as given so far is applicable to the 
tests carried out with free drainage and with restricted 
drainage. The procedures for the two types of tests were 
somewhat different from this point and will be given separat¬ 
ely. 


A. Free Draina ge — The anode end of the cylinder was 
connected to the constant head water supply apparatus (Figure 
14) and the elevation of the constant head apparatus was 
adjusted so that the level of the overflow on it was at the 
same level as the overflow tubes on the two gas escape tubes. 
Both ends of the cylinder were then filled with distilled 
water to the level of the overflow tubes. 

A 50 cubic centimetre graduate was placed under the 
overflow tube at the cathode end of the sample to catch the 
water drained from the soil. The readings on the Ames dials 
were then read and recorded as the zero readings. 

In the case where only one Ames dial was used this 
reading was taken and the "x-distance" (see page 38>) was 
measured. 

The electrical circuit was then closed and the 
voltage adjusted to the desired value. The time of closing 
the circuit was taken and the flow of electric current as 
indicated by the milliammeter measured as soon as the proper 
voltage was obtained. These values were recorded in the 
data book. 

Readings of the Ames dial, milliammeter, water 
discharge, ft x-distance ,f and the time of these readings were 
taken at frequent intervals thereafter. The interval between

these readings varied with the rate of change of the readings 
and ranged from five minutes to one hour at the start of 
the test up to one day as the test progressed. It was neces¬ 
sary to adjust the voltage at frequent intervals. 



Constant Head Water Supply Apparatus 

Figure 14- 

As drainage of the soil proceeded the samples had 
a tendency to shrink away from the sides of the cylinder and 
thus provide a free drainage channel from the water supply 
at the anode to the cathode. The sample was watched very 
carefully during the first day and when such shrinkage fi rs t

became apparent the load on the pistons was increased enough 
to keep the soil in contact with the cylinder. Loads of 50 
pounds or more were quite often needed to do this. 

The test was allowed to run until there was little 
or no water being drained from the soil. In some of the earl¬ 
ier tests the lengths of the runs were somewhat longer. 

At the end of the test the electrical power was 
disconnected and the final length of the sample was measured 
through the lucite cylinder before the load on the pistons 
was removed. The water in the cylinder was drained, the 
apparatus disassembled and the soil specimen removed. 

Routine tests were run on the soil specimen and 
these will be described under the heading, "Treatment of the 
Soil Specimen After the Electrokinetic Test." 

B. Restricted Draina ge -- After the cell with the soil 
paste in it had been placed in the loading apparatus and the 
initial load applied, the opening on the lower side of the 
cylinder at the cathode end was connected to the mercury 
manometer or to the Crosby pressure gauge, whichever was to 
be used to measure the developed pressure. 

Distilled water was then added to the cylinder, 
sufficient to bring the water surface to the level of the 
overflow in the anode end and sufficient to completely fill 
the gas collection chamber at the cathode end. The pressure 
lead to the manometer or the pressure gauge was also cleared 
of air. In the case of the mercury manometer a valve at the 
top of the mercury reservoir was opened and water forced 
through the pressure lead and out through this valve, driving

the air out ahead of it. When the pressure gauge was used 
the pressure lead was "disconnected at the gauge and water 
allowed to run through it and then reconnected to the gauge 
while full of water. 

The initial or zero reading on the Ames dial was 
then taken and the tr x-distance" measured. The electrical 
circuit was closed and the voltage adjusted to the desired 
value. The time of closing the circuit was recorded and the 
flow of electric current determined as soon as the proper 
voltage was obtained. 

At intervals as described in the procedure for 
the free drainage test readings of the Ames dial, electric 
current flow, "x-distance" and the developed pressure were 
taken and recorded, along with the time of these readings. 

As in the free drainage test it was again necessary 
to adjust the voltage frequently and maintain enough load on 
the pistons to keep the soil in contact with the walls of the 
cylinder. 

In this case the test was allowed to run until the 
pressure developed remained fairly constant over a period of 
two or three days, after which the electrical power was dis¬ 
connected, the length of the sample measured, the pressure 
released and the water drained off. The cell was then dis¬ 
assembled and the soil specimen removed for further tests as 
in the free drainage case. 

Treatment of the Soil After the Electrokinetic Test 

Immediately after removing the soil specimen from 
the cell it was cut in half along its longitudinal axis.

One half of the specimen was placed in the moist room and 
allowed to dry out slowly. It was observed at frequent 
intervals throughout the drying period to determine any 
variation in structure that might have taken place due to 
the transfer of soil particles in the mass. 

The other half of the specimen was marked off into 
five equal intervals along its longitudinal axis. These 
intervals were called Zones I to V respectively, Zonel being 
at the anode end of the sample and Zone V at the cathode 
end. From each of these zones approximately 5 grams of soil 
was removed and the moisture content of each 5 gram sample 
determined. 

The remainder of the soil in Zones I and II was 
placed in one disk and the soil from Zones IV and V placed 
in another disk.and marked anode soil and cathode soil 
respectively. These samples were then air-dried and broken 
down to pass a number 40 sieve (Note: All of the soil passed 
the number 40 sieve). The liquid limit, plastic limit and 
hydrometer analysis of each of these samples was then deter¬ 
mined to be compared with the corresponding data for the orig¬ 


inal soil.

DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS 


The primary object of this investigation was to 
produce, if possible, by the application of an electrical 
field to a remoulded clay, a structure in the soil mass re¬ 
sembling a varved clay such as is frequently found in nature. 

Dr. Leo Casagrande in a paper published in 

1947 reported that he had produced such a structure by apply¬ 
ing an electric potential to what was originally a uniformly 
remoulded sample of London clay. In the paper he does not 
say how the varved structure was formed, except that the 
laminations follow the equipotential surfaces. He also re¬ 
ported that the electrosmotic transport of the pure water 
towards the cathode resulted in the formation of cracks in 
the soil around and between the electrodes, the pattern of 
these cracks also following the equipotential lines. 

It is possible on the basis of the above statements 
to conceive that the laminated structure was possibly formed 
by the movement of soil particles, by the process of electro¬ 
phoresis, into the cracks along the equipotential lines where 
they were deposited. 

On the basis of this theory the first set of tests ■ 
was made (Tests 1 to 7). While cracking did occur along the 
equipotential lines between the electrodes, no indication of 
a laminated structure showed up during the tests, nor on the 
half specimen that was observed as it was slowly dried out, 
The results of the grain size tests made on the soil at each 
of the electrodes, Plates 10 to 15, showed the anode soil to

be finer grained than the cathode soil such as would be expected 
if a transfer of soil particles had taken place. However, in 
all tests the two soils were both coarser grained than the 
original material. Thus it was not possible to say whether the 
finer grained soil at the anode was a result of a transfer of 
soil particles or of a lesser tendency for the soil to become 
coarser grained at the anode than at the cathode. 

This apparent increase in grain size of the soil 
particles will be further discussed shortly. 

With- free drainage of the soil mass, the specimen 
soon consolidated and formed a comparatively solid mass and 
it seemed reasonable that the transfer of soil particles in 
such a mass would be practically impossible. It was thought, 
therefore, that by cutting off the flow of water as much as 
possible the soil would remain in a semi-liquid state and thus 
the soil particles would be much more mobile. By doing this 
it also seemed logical that if the electrosmotic flow of water 
was decreased then the transfer of soil particles by electro¬ 
phoresis should increase. Consequently the remaining tests, 
Tests 8 to 16, were made with the flow of water restricted. 

It was not possible to keep the soil semi-liquid 
however, as consolidation took place from the cathode end of 
the cell. The sample would consolidate as drainage took 
place and the water merely moved into the space left by the 
concolidation of the soil mass. 

Again cracking of the soil mass took place along 
the equipotential surfaces but there were no visible indi¬ 
cations of a varved structure being formed under these con¬ 
ditions of restricted drainage. Grain size tests were made

on the soil at the anode and cathode end of the specimen 
for these tests and results very similar to those obtained 
for free drainage were obtained as shown on Plates 16 to ££ 

A comparison of the grading bands obtained for the 
anode soils and the cathode soils from each of the two type 
of tests, Plate £3, seems to indicate that a transfer of 
soil particles did take place in the case of restricted 
drainage if not in the^ase of free drainage. This is indi¬ 
cated by the fact that, while in both cases the cathode 
soils lie in the same band (although the band for restrict¬ 
ed drainage is considerably wider than for free drainage) 
the anode soil band for restricted drainage is somewhat 
higher than the corresponding band for free drainage. 

With the above indication in mind a soil (Soil 4) 
from an entirely different area was tried on the chance 
that it would not have the same tendency to increase in 
grain size with the application of an electrical field. 

This test was made with restricted drainage. 

This test showed visible signs of a variation in the 
grain size of the soil sample which was dried slowly at 
the end of the test, as is clearly shown in Figure 15. 

A layer at the cathode end about lj inches in length shows 
up in the photograph a much lighter color than the rest 
of the specimen. This is due to the coarser structure at 
this end resulting in a faster drying of the soil and hence 
a lighter color. The results of the grain size analysis of 
the soil at each end of the specimen is shown on Plate £1 
together with that of the original soil sample. The soil

Effect of Direct Current on the Grain Size - It has been

the case of Soils 2 and 3 as well. 

Along with this soil movement, an increase In size 
of the soil particles resulted from the application of the

electric field* An examination of Plates 15 and 22 was made 
in an attempt to correlate the resulting grain size at the 
electrodes with the applied potential. However no relation¬ 
ship was apparent. It was then thought that possibly the 
resulting grain size would be dependent on the quantity of 
electricity passed through the soil. An examination of Plates 
15 and 22 was made on this basis, but again no relationship 
was apparent. (The quantity of electricity passed through each 
soil specimen is given on Plate 30.) 

It is possible however that with a larger number 
of tests some relationship could be established between the 
final grain size and the applied potential or the quantity 
of electricity passed through the soil. 

It is the opinion of the author that the increase 
in size of the soil grains was due to the orientation of 
the soil grains in the electrical field and the particles 
then combining. A study of the lattice structures of the 
clay minerals, Figures 7, 8 and 9, show that fractures taking 
place parallel to C-C result in a severance of valence bonds 
and one side of the fracture has an excess of positive valence 
bonds while the other side has an excess of negative bonds. 

When the soil paste was placed in the cell the soil particles 
would be in a haphazard arrangement. The application of the 
electrical field would cause the particles to orient them¬ 
selves thus bringing particle surfaces having excess positive 
valence bonds in contact with surfaces having excess negative 
valence bonds and a joining of the particles would result.

A second explanation of the larger grain sizes 

obtained after the electrokinetic testing of the soil is 

possible on the basis of information contained in a report 
( 2 ) 

by Ralph E. Grim • He has shown that when clay-mineral 
particles are agitated in water they tend to break up into 
smaller sized units. The degree of disaggregation varies 
with the clay-mineral structure, montmorillonite breaking 
down more readily than kaolinite and some illites breaking 
down more readily than others. Also a variation in disag¬ 
gregation occurs when the electrolytic content of the clay 
particles change. 

It is possible that the electrolytic content of 
the soil was changed during the test by hydrogen produced 
by electrolysis of the water going into solution and possibly 
entering the soil structure as an exchangeable base. This 
change in the clay soil could then result in a change of the 
degree of disaggregation of the soil with the resulting 
change in the grain size indicated by the hydrometer test. 

The fact that the grain size of Soil 4 was not 
changed as much as that of Soils 2 and 3 is probably due to 
Soil 4 being .composed of different clay-mineral constituents 
than Soils 2 and 3. In order to check these theories it 
would be necessary to determine the mineral structure and 
chemical analysis of the soil. Facilities for determining 
these properties are not available at the University of 
Alberta and so no check of these theories could be made. 

Effect of Direct Current on the Atterberg Limits - The 
application of direct current to the soil samples had very

marked effects on the Atterberg limits of these soils as is 
shown on Plate 30. The liquid limit of the soils was decreased 
somewhat while the plastic limit was increased, resulting 
in a very marked decrease in the plasticity index. The effect 
was greater on the soil near the cathode than that near the 
anode, which would be expected after observing the effects 
of the current on the grain size of the soil at either end. 

In an attempt to establish a relation between the 
Atterberg limits of the soil after testing and the applied 
potential, the final values of the liquid limit, plastic 
limit and plasticity index were plotted against the applied 
potential as shown on Plates 31, 32 and 33. However, no 
relationship appeared to exist. 

These Atterberg limit values were then plotted 
against the quantity of electricity that had passed through 
the soil. These plots are shown on Plates 34, 35, and 36. 

The points for the liquid limit of the cathode soils and those 
for the plastic limits of both the anode and cathode soils 
were too widely scattered to give a definite trend. Plate 
34, however, indicates that with small quantities of electricity 
the liquid limit of the soil was reduced quite appreciably and 
with increasing quantities the liquid limit increased to a 
point and then, with still further increases in quantity of 
electricity, the liquid limit again decreased. Plat© 36 shows 
a similar trend for the variation of the plasticity inde* 
with the quantity of electricity through the sample for both 
cathode and anode soils. 

It is reasonable to expect a change in the Atterberg

limit values as a result of the increased grain size of the 
soili^ but why this variation should be as indicated on Plates 
34 and 36 the author is unable to explain. 

In the case of the anode soil from Test 16 the 
Atterberg limit values were affected in the same general way 
although the grain size of the anode soil was finer than the 
original soil in this case. The author suggests, therefore, 
that the change in the Atterberg limit values as well as 
being due to the increased grain size is also partly a result 
of base exchange in the clay material, hydrogen being the base 
going into the structure replacing the bass already there. 
Again, to verify this statement it would be necessary to make 
a chemical analysis of the soil before and after testing, 
however as evidence in support of the explanation given Ralph 
E. Grim states that, "small amounts of sodium, hydrogen, 

and aluminum as exchangeable bases greatly alter certain 
plastic properties." 

Mr. Grim suggests, as a satisfactory explanation of 
the action of the exchangeable bases, "—that they influence 
the orientation of the adsorbed water molecules. The in¬ 
fluence may be in the perfection of the orientation, the 
thickness to which good orientation can develop, or the abrupt¬ 
ness of the transition from oriented to unoriented water." 

Effect of Direct Current on Pinal Moisture Content - The 
distribution of moisture content in the sample between the 
electrodes together with the average final moisture content 
of the soil is given in tabular form on Plate 24 and shown 
graphically on Plates 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29.

In the cases where free drainage of the soil 
specimen was permitted, the tests were continued until the 
flow of water from the cell had ceased and it would be expected, 
therefore, that the final average moisture content would be 
a function of the magnitude of the applied potential. Plate 
25 indicates such to be the case. From Plate 25 it would 
appear that the final average moisture content is inversely 
proportional to the magnitude of the applied potential. It 
must be realized, however, that this straight line was drawn 
on the basis of only four points, two of which were for Soil 
2 and two for Soil 3. The fifth point, obtained at a potential 
of 60 volts, does not follow the trend. However, during the 
test at 60 volts a glaze was formed on the cathode and the 
author believes that this glaze cut off the drainage of water 
from the sample, hence the high moisture content resulting 
from this test. 

The distribution of moisture between the electrodes 
at the end of the tests is shown on Plates 26, 27, 28 and 29 
for the various soils tested under conditions of free drainage 
and restricted drainage. These plates seem to indicate a 
gradual increase in moisture content from the anode (Zone I) 
to the cathode (Zone V). Again, since the tests were continued 
until drainage had ceased, these curves represent the final 
moisture distribution. Dr. Leo Oasagrande in a paper presented 
at the Second International Conference on Soil Mechanics and 
Foundation Engineering has reported similar results for the 
moisture distribution in a clayey soil subjected to drainage 
by electrosmosis. (11)

Variation of Current, Water Discharge, Developed Pressure and 

Void Ratio During Tests - The variation of flow of current, 
water discharge and void ratio during the tests with free 
drainage are shown on Plates 37 to 41 inclusive. In the cases 
where the tests were made with the drainage restricted the 
variation of flow of current, pressure developed and void ratio 
are shown on Plates 42 to 47. 

An examination of these curves seems to indicate 
that a maximum flow of current occurs with a minimum void 
ratio. With continued testing after the final void ratio was 
reached resulted in the current dropping off considerably, 
possibly as a result of drying of the soil. 

In the case where the soil was allowed to drain freely, 
water was discharged from the soil for some time after the final 
void ratio had been reached, but at a decreasing rate until 
flow ceased completely. 

Where the flow of water was restricted^the pressure 
developed at the cathode reached a maximum and then decreased 
somewhat and more or less levelled off. This result was also 

(pg \ 

found by Gauze, de Bruyn and loustra and was reported in 

a paper published in the Proceedings of the Second International 
Conference on Soil Mechanics and Foundation Engineering. 

The results given in this thesis for the developed 
pressures should be taken as an indication of what is to be 
expected and should not be compared with the pressures devel¬ 
oped at various voltages since considerable trouble was en¬ 
countered as a result of leakage in the gas collection chamber 
and around the piston rod and the values shown are not accurate.

CONCLUSIONS 

It wes unfortunate that sufficient soil was not 
available at the start of the investigation so that tests 1 
to 15 inclusive could have all been made on the same soil and 
thus eliminate one variable at least from the investigation. 

However on the basis of the information resulting 
from the investigation the following conclusions have been 
drawn: 

(1) The movement of soil particles in an electrical field 
is possible and movement of the soil particles is 
toward the anode. 

(£) The soil particles in some clay soil types increase 
in size, possibly through a joining of soil particles, 
when in an electrical field. 

(3) The liquid limit of clay soil is decreased, its plastic 
limit is increased and consequently its plasticity 
index is decreased when subjected to an electrical 
field. 

(4) The final average moisture content that a clay soil 
may attain in an electrical field is inversely pro¬ 
portional to the electrical potential to which it is 
subjected. 

(5) The final distribution of moisture in a clay soil 
subjected to a given electrical potential increases 
somewhat from the anode to the cathode.

RECOMMENhATI ONS FOR FUTURE STUDY 

In future studies that may be made of the effect 
of direct currents on the characteristics of clay soils, 
attention should be given to the following: 

(1) A complete picture of the clay minerals in the clay 
soil should be obtained. 

(2) The non-clay minerals in the soil should be determined 
together with the amounts of each. 

(3) A quantitative determination of the exchangeable 
bases and any water-soluble salts present in the 
soil should be made both before and after being 
subjected to the electric current. 

(4) If organic material is present in the clay material 
the amount and kind of such material should be 
determined. 

In order to obtain a complete picture, an analysis 
of the soil would have to be made on the basis of optical, 
X-ray, chemical and thermal data. The clay minerals, and 
possibly the non-clay minerals are best identified by 
combining the results of X-ray, optical and thermal tests. 
The exchangeable bases, water-soluble salts end organic 
material can be identified on the basis of a chemical 
analysis. 

It is the opinion of the author that if only one 
method was to be made available for the identification 
of clay minerals, the most information could be obtained 
from the differential thermal analysis of the soil. How¬ 
ever for positive and complete identification a combin¬ 
ation of methods must be used.

"The differential thermal analysis method is based 
upon the fact that the application of heat to many minerals 
causes certain physical and chemical changes that are reflected 
in endothermic and exothermic reactions. By comparing the 

a 

change in temperature of/\mineral heated at a definite rate 
with that of a thermally inert substance heated under the 
same conditions a curve or pattern is obtained which is 
characteristic of the particular mineral under examination." (13) 
A comprehensive description of the differential 
thermal method of analysis of clay minerals has been published 
by the following men, Speil Berkeihamer Pask 

Davies Kulp ^ , Kerr ^ , and Hamilton ^ .
