FOREWORD 


Numerous men have made analytical reports of detailed 
investigations on the subject of Aritlmietic* A very large num¬ 
ber of these investigations have been completed in the United 
States. In 1940 Dr. M. E. LaZerte, Dean of the Faculty of Edu¬ 
cation in the University of Alberta, prepared a series of Sur¬ 
vey Tests for use in each of the public school grades. This 
set of tests forms the basis for this investigation.

CHAlPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

Arithjiietic has long been considered a fundamental subject 
on the school curriculum* Foremost in the criteria of judging 
the school was the achievement of its scholars in arithmetic. In 
the school itself, the chief criterion for promoting the student 
was his ability in arithmetic; and to a marked extent that is 
still true. There have always been students who showed a marked 
inability to master the subject. Long pedagogical theory has 
not yet established the best method of presenting it. Various 
theories have been advanced regarding the psychology of learning 
arithmetic. But any sound theory must have its basis on a reli¬ 
able diagnosis of the existing conditions. Diagnostic tests may 
seek to determine particular features of a procedure that indi¬ 
cate the cause of a pupil* s difficulty; or a broader field 
would be to determine the ability of the pupil in a general 
survey by giving examples of many types, each of which repre¬ 
sents the requirement of a different combination of skills. 

The LaZerte Survey Tests are of this latter type and are con¬ 
ceived to give a comprehensive survey of the existing condition 
of arithmetic in the public schools. 

PRELIMINARY WORK 

In December, 1940 a testing program in arithmetic was 
Inaugurated following the 1940 Summer School course on the 
Psychology and Supervision of Arithmetic. At that time about 
nine thousand copies of the tests were sent to Alberta schools, 

A report concerning that test was published in the February(1941) 
number of the Alberta Teachers* Magazine, The second step in 
the testing program came in May when another nine thousand copies 
of a second test were sent to the schools. These tests were pre¬ 
pared by Dr, M, E, LaZerte of the Faculty of Education in the 
University of Alberta, Considerable attention was given to their 
preparation for a survey to establish definite evidence of the 
goals of attainment in arithmetic achieved by children attending 


-1- 






the public schools. The tests were written by pupils from Grades 
II to IX Inclusive under the supervision of the teachers. The 
papers v/ere then returned to the University, Prom these answer 
papers, sixteen hundred , representing a sample of two hundred 
from each grade, were marked in the summer of 1941 and the data 
tabulated* A chart of the norms based on that data was published 
in the September (1941) number of the Teachers’ Magazine* The 
complete data on this second set of tests represent the basis 
of this thesis* 

OBJECTIVES 

Success in the presentation of arithmetic requires clear 
comprehension of the standards to be. attained and the nature of 
the common difficulties* These tests should have as one object¬ 
ive the establishment of provincial norms for teachers’ refer¬ 
ence in analyzing , for correction, the problems of the pupils* 
The Number Highways 6 gives special mastery tests* It is a 
recognized feature of the course of study in arithmetic that 
instruction must be based on effective diagnosis followed by 
remedial teaching* Mere marking of a child’s work from day to 
day is most ineffective, when this underlying principle is 
disregarded. The use of these Survey Tests should give a basis 
for an intelligent analysis of difficulties, which if carefully 
recorded, will enable the teacher to correct the individual 
faults of pupils* Use of the tests merely for comparison of a 
class with a norm lacks realization of their potential value* 
Analysis, recording, and corrective instruction for the errors 
revealed, must follow* 

This dissertation is not intended as a treatise on 
remedial teaching but rather as an analysis of the quantitative 
and qualitative nature of the problems revealed in the LaZerte 
Survey Tests in their use in the Alberta schools in May, 1941*

CHAPTER II 


COPIES OP THE SURVEY TESTS 

It Is generally accepted that survey tests are used 
to determine how the achievements of a class or of pupils in 
a class compare with standards or norms of accomplishment. 

But, as was Indicated in Chapter I, the giving of a survey 
test is only the first step in an effecyive testing program. 
Students* errors must be diagnosised and corrected. It would 
appear that the time for such a test would be early in the 
year so that the teacher could make an analysis of difficulties 
and adjust the teaching procedure in the light of that. There 
is much that is commonly forgotten in the summer vacation tliat 
might be thus revealed. Then too, in a system of administration 
that brings a new teacher frequently into a school at September, 
there is need that he or she should know the area of the field 
to be covered in the arithmetic course of each grade. It fol¬ 
lows from what has been said that the test must be completely 
reprsentative of the course of study for the particular grade. 
Examination of the tests in this chapter will show that careful 
regard has been given to the factual requirements stated by the 
Course of Study for each particular grade. 

Most of the tests were too long for one sitting; they 
are very comprehensive and no time limit is stipulated. Most 
of them require two sessions of writing and therefore are in 
sections. Thus Part A and Part B represent sections written at 
different sessions. All the grades, except Grade VIII, had at 
least two sections on the tests. Grade VI had three sections 
and Grade IX, having two sections of Geometry as well as one of 
Algebra, also had three sections representing three periods of 
writing. 

A copy of the instructions sent to teachers is included 
in the chapter. Copies of the keys to the tests follow in 
Chapter III.

INSTRUCTIONS RE> SURVEY TESTS IN ARITHIviETIC 

A. INSTRUCTIOiMS TO TEACHERS 


(a) General 


1* All but the slowest pupils should be allowed all 
the time required to finish the test. 

2. Before pupils begin the test make certain that all 
data required to be entered in the blanks at the 
top of the test are complete. 

3. See th .t pupils have provided themselves with pen¬ 
cils, rulers, and necessary drawing instruments. 

4. Each test begins with the spelling of a list of 
words. The teacher should dictate these rather 
slowly, pronouncing each word and giving its use 
in a sentence. The spelling lists for the various 
grades are to be found on the grade keys. 

5. In Grade 11 the teacher is to read the questions 
with the pupils as they do them but in other grades 
no assistance is to be given. 

6. See that the time given each pupil to the test is 
recorded on the test paper as soon as the pupil 
completes his work. 

7. No deductions are to be made for mistakes in spell¬ 
ing except in the Spelling Test. 

8. Both the December and the May tests are sectioned. 
Generally the entire test is to be taken at two 
sittings. Arrange to have Part A of the test done 
in the forenoon and the second part in the after¬ 
noon of the same day. 

9. Please try to give tests v/ithin five days of Dec¬ 
ember 15th or May 31st, YsTnere more than one class 
in your school or vicinity is to take the test, 
they should all take it at the same time. 

10. After marking papers, tabulate any information you 
wish to use, and then kindly forv/ard tests for study 
to M. 1. LaZerte, College of Education, University 
of Alberta, Edmoxnton. ¥e suggest that you use the 
December 15th test as your Christmas test for your 
report. It will therefore be marked in December 
and you can forward it to the University before 

the Christmas holidays. The May 31st test should 
be forwarded not later than June 15th. 

11. These test results will be used in two ways. You 
will use them in educational guidance of individual 
pupils. You are testing the pupils knowledge of 
the course. This means that there is to be no 
teaching in preparation for the test if we are to 
get a true picture. We hope to use the test results 
in obtaining provincial norms. Your school is not 
being graded. 


(b) Re. Particular Grades 


Grade 11 — Explain the pictures . 

Teachers should read the entire test through with 
pupils as they work, except the combinations and

separations. Make certain that the pupils follow 
the questions correctly ancl that they put the answers 
in the blanks. 


B. Instructions to be read to pupils 


(a) General 


1. This is not a timed test. Do Not hurry. Work care¬ 
fully but do not Wcxste time. If you cannot do a 
question, go on to the next one. 

2. You may use pencil or ink, preferably pencil. If 
you are using pencil have two on hand if possible 
in case you need them. 

3. All lists of spelling, computation, dravirings, etc., 
are to be used by any pupil. 


(b) Re. Particular Grades 

Grade 111 — Teachers should tell pupils to use 
ink bottle top or some such object 
when they want to draw a circle. 

Grade IV — You may copy the division questions 
on the back of the sheets and work 
them there. Be sure to number them 
correctly if you do this. Mien 
finished with each question put the 
answer in its proper place on the 
front of the sheet. 

Grades V. VI and Vll — 

Common fractions are in all cases 
to be reduced to lov/est terms. 

Grades Vlll and IX —

In tln’ee age classes the hoys are higher; the differenc 
is larger than in the classes where the girls excel. It is sig 
nificant that the youngest age group made high schres compara¬ 
tively, This does not indicate that maturity of experience is 
a weighty factor in coiiprehending arithmetic. It appears that 
these youngest children do as well, if not better , than many 
of the older ones. It may be su.ggested that child of ten years 
in Grade II is backv«ra.rd; but there were children of ten years 
or more who made scores of 96 - 111. There v/as one case of a 
score of 25 in this age class. In the first case it was likely 
lack of opportunity rather than lack of cai^acity. But matura¬ 
tion It^s not made a significant showing either, as children of 
seven years ms.de higher scores, one making 116,

ADDITION 

24 questions with an allowance of 1 mark each comprised 
this section of the test. The addition yielded the highest 
average score on the test. The average score was 84,9/^, 

No one scored zero, though 2 students received a score 
of 3. 63 pupils got all the questions correct. 

A diagnostic test alms to reveal the nature of the errors 
made. It is impossible to find all the types of difficulties 
such as shifting around or counting as might be revealed by 
verbal statements. Nevertheless many types of errors were 
revealed. 

Description of difficulties: 

The greatest difficulty arose in two column addition 
where earrying was involved; for example only the first type 
of error occurred in the first six questions on addition. 

Types: 

1. Incorrect Combinations. 

4 5 

5 4 
2 

XT’ 

This was the most common type of error; 28^ shov/ed weak¬ 
ness in combinations. 

2. Failure to carry to the tens column, 

59 62 

1 8 

rro 6 To 

Here the pupil continued his practise of one column 
addition and wrote down the answer to the first column and then 
went on to the next column and wrote down the left hand number. 
32 pupils showed this inability to make the bridge from addition 
of one colujnn to two columns • 

3. Adds all the numbers together. 

34 56 

__4 

11 13 

9 students, falling to understand two column addition, 
added the left hand digit in the upper number to the sum of the 
right hand digits. Nearly all the addition questions on their 
papers were consequently wrong. The remedy lies in learning the 
new processes involved in two column addition.

4. Adds only the right hand column, 

23 33

This t3rpe Is closely associated with the third type above, 
except that the left hand digit is ignored altogether. 6^ of the 
pupils made this mistake, but as in question 3 type, nearly all 
the problems involving carrying were wrong, 

5* Adds 1 to the second column.

This error occurred once ; but it indicates the difficulty 
for children to learn two column addition. This child has remem¬ 
bered that one writes down one digit of the sum of the first 
combination and * carries* the other, and he has apparently 
acquired the idea th^t one must always carry 1 in addition of 
more than one column, 

6, Adds the bottom number to each digit of the top number, 

75 83 

_4 7 

119 160 

2 pupils made this mistake ; but the difficulty of 
transferri^Jg from one column to two column addition is again 
shown. The second example is interesting, for the pupil carried 
the 1 from his first combination to add with the 8, but he also 
added the 7 again, 

7, Adds all the digits for the second combination, 

26 

_3 

119 

The pupil added 3 and 6 and wrote 9; then he added all 
the figures to get the 11, This is again another exanple of the 
failure to comprehend the processes involved in two column 
addition, 

8, Difficulty in bridging tens. 

62 59 

_ 8 _ _ 1 

80 70 

This type of error shown by 7 pupils occurred only where 
the right hand digit of the first combination ended in zero.

- 1 ^ TT 

The tliree examples of this type may not be evidence of 
lack of knowledge; but it would appear that the students had 
added 1 and 9 and written down the 0 and carried the 1 to add 
with the 5 and placed the second combination on the right hand 
side of the first digit in the answer, 

10, Subtracted, 

66

_ 6 students made this mistake,

11, Failure to carry,

__5 

60 

11 students gave this variation of the failure to 
comprehend two column addition. These students understood 
the writing down of only the zero from the first combination, 
but failed to carry the 1, The examples were all in cases of 
the first combination being 10, 

12, Failure to carry to the tens column and inversion of digits, 

65 62 

_5 

106 106 

Here again the students do not understand the two column 
addition. These students added the right hand digits and wrote 
down the sum without regard for the * carrying process*. Then they 
wrote down the other digit in the answer on the wrong side of 
the first sum.

SUBTRACTION 

The average score for the 26 questions in subtraction 
was 68«3.^. Only 16 pupils did all the questions correctly. 

Subtraction represented the hardest skill on the test; 
it is important that an analysis of skills required in subtrac¬ 
tion be understood andthat errors be diagnosed to determine the 
child* s knowledge of the facts required. 

The nature of each error having been determined, a set 
of exercises should be designed to follow careful instruction 
in the particular skill required. 

Difficulties: 

The most common error lay in the lack of knowledge of 
combinations or else in the failure to understand what was 
wanted; many students added, although many added in the sub¬ 
traction exercises only where no minus sign was shown. 

Types of Errors: 

1. Weakness in Combinations: 

78 

24 

53 students lacked knowledge of subtraction combinations* 

2. Addition instead of subtraction. 

500 

200 

700 

This was the most common error; 66 out of the 200 students 
added the examples. 

One variation of the addition was represented by adding 

the digits of the minuend and then subtracting the 

subtrahend, 45 53 

* 

3. Subtraction of the subtrahend from the right hand digit of 

the minuend only, 

46 

3 

13 pupils showed this fault.

4, Subtraction of subtrahend from each digit of the minuend.

Here again 5 students indicated their inability to 
deal with 2 digit numbers in subtraction. 

5. Borrowing difficulties 

(a) Borrowing when it was unnecessary 

86 

zl 

71 

7 students made this class error. 

(b) Borrowing and not allowing for it. 

60 

-3 

67 

10 students showed this type of error. 

(c) Increased the minuend after borrowing 

40 40 

zi zl 

54 59 

3 students demonstrated this error, 
fd) Deducting 2 from the minuend 
60 
47 

5 pupils erred in this respect. 

Thus 25 students or 12^-^ indicated lack of know¬ 
ledge in regard to borrowing exclusive of those who 
misunderstood it in the zero problems. 

6. Zero Difficulties. 

(a) Zero in the minuend 

(i) 50 

Zi 

50 

Here 14 students obviously said 9 from 0 is 
0 and then 0 from 5 is 5. 
fii) 50 

zi 

40 

Here there is similar procedure except that 
the 10 pupils seem to have an idea they should 


have borrowed 1 from 5 and thus left 4 






(Hi) 40 
-1 


- 70 - 


Here 5 students have apparently added 1 plus 4 equals 5 

and then said 0 from 4 leaves 4, 

(iv) 40 
-1 

"5 

2 students neglected the zero and added the other numbers. 


(V) 

40 

60 


-1 



31 

33 


Here the three students concerned have proceeded thus; 

0 from 1 equals 1; 1 from 4 equals 3* Or in the second case, 0 
from 3 equals 3; 3 from 6 equals 3. 

This is much like type 4 above. 

This first step could be 1 from 0 equals 1; that would 
indicate a failure to observe borrowing* 

(vi) 50 

49 


Here , 12 students have borrowed from the 5 , but wrote 
down the subtrahend instead of the remainder or else they sub¬ 
tracted 0 from 9 equals 0, and poorly understanding borrowing, 
deducted 1 from the 5 and wrote the answer 4* 

(vii) 50 

59 

This appears to be type 2 (addition instead of subtrac¬ 
tion); but the 19 students concerned only did this where there 
was a zero in the minuend. So it is suggested that either bor¬ 
rowing was not understood or what is more likely, students said 
9 from 0 must be 9 or that 0 from 9 leaves 9, and the second 
part would be 0 from 5 leaves 5. 

It is difficult to say how many examples of type 2 have 
been classed as sub-section vii of type 6, But in these latter 
cases, the pupils did not add in other exac^iles on the test. 

Altogether 65 pupils erred in the problems involving 
a zero in the minuend.

•Number Senses 

This was the second division of A-2 
20 pupils or 10 io got all the 10 raarhs aiiOuoed. 

Question 5.- Here 28 students failed to realize that 
the series was'in 5's. 11 more did the first 

three blanks in 5’s but proceeded by I's after 

100 . 

Question 6.- 5 students failed to recognize the 10's 
series; 7 more placed the first tv;o, but missed 
after 150. (It is significant that many students 
were writing 1005 for 105 or a similar tyue of 
error.) 

Question 7.- Many students failed to notice the head¬ 
ing of "By hovj many is" above the question. 

18 pupils added 200 to 180. 

5 pupils wrote yes. 

28 pupils did not try it. 

1 pupil wrote 200 is greater. 

Question 8.- Here again many students did not apply 
the heading to the section. 

10 students wrote yes. 

2 students added-. 

Question 8 was ’easier or clearer in meaning with¬ 
out the heading of "By how many is". 

Only 22 pupils correctly interpreted Questions 7 


and 8 







72 


Vvriting Numbers. 

The third section of the A part of the Test gave 4 
questions on V/riting N^imbers. Here the children did well, 
125 of them getting the full rnarh. 

1. 7 students wrote 129 instead of 139;lwrote 149 instead. 
16 students wrote 104 instead of 140; 1 wrote 16 instead 
60. 1 wrote 80 for 108 and 1 wrote 114 instead of 140. 

2. Wrote the 100; then the unit as one hundred eiq:ht — 
1008; one hundred thirty nine -- 10039 

4 students made this mistake; apparently these 
students went on counting from 100 and retained the 
idea of 100 and proceeded to repeat the process of 
100 and 1 is 1001 and so on to 10039. 

3. Used one cipher. 

One hundred thirty nine -- 1039. 

Here was the most common error. 21 students 
committed this mistake. These pupils have learn¬ 
ed how to start out from 100 by proceeding 101, 

102,-109:i: 'Then they have continued into the 

next set v;ith the zero and written 1010,-1039, 

1040. 

4. One variation was interesting. 

One hundred forty appeared as 1 lOO-iO. 

The pupil wrote the symbol for eLch separate word. 
It would appear that many pupils have drilled 
numbers orally and thus have never really seen 
the symbol. 

5. Another single variation showed in writing one hundred 

thirty nine as 1309. 

6. 14 students did not attempt number 3 and number 4. 

7. 3 students left off the hundred and wrote the last 






- 73 - 

synibol only. 

as one hundred eight--8. 

one hundred thirty nine --39. 


Notation. 

This section involving writing the words for the 
symbols was correctly answered by 113 pupils. 

Some children seemed completely unfamiliar with 
the words for the figures and wrote words that sounded 
like the symbol such as ate for eight. There were 9 
cases that suggested the pupils were unfamiliar with 
the written name of the symbol. 

2. 2 wrote the numbers over again. 

(9) 6; (9) 6 

3. 1 added the numbers and put down the sum. 

^ 9 ) 15 

4. 10 did not try the question at all. 

5. 8 pupils simply mixed the words up getting nine 
opposite six or ten opposite 7. 

6. 3 students wrote the figure 7 in the first blank opposite 
6 and continued to write the other names in consecutive 
order. 

f 9 ) 6 ; seven 
flO) 7; eight 

This question clearly indicated that many pupils 
are drilling in the symbols without knowledge of the 


written word forms 













74 


Assorted Questions 

There was a series of nine questions with an allocation 
of 17 marks. 

A- 3 questions health with the ordinals. 

B- 1 question tested the left hand knowledge. 

C- 1 question tested for knowledge of even numbers. 

D- 3 questions were of the ”3 more than 25 is?” type. 

E- 2 questions v;ere for knowledge of Roman Numerals. 

27 pupils scored a full mark on this section of the 

tes t. 

Analysis of errors 

A- 18 pupils made mistakes here, choosing for example the 
8th instead of the ninth circle or 

4 pupils read the 16th question incorrectly and put 
only one x in the circle. 

9 pupils did not color any circle. 

5 pupils colored 7 circles. 

B- 22 pupils did not show knowledge of left hand from 
right asked for in question 14. 

G- 102 pupils failed to get the even numbers between 
30 and 50. Some put all the numbers between these 
two limits or else none. 

The alloted mark of 9 for this question apoears 
excessive in relation to the whole section and the 
principles tested. 

B- 11 pupils did not interpret this type at all. 

6 m.ore subtracted. 

12 pupils added incorrectly. 

E- 68 pupils failed to give the corredt Arabic symbols 
for the Roman Numerals; all these missed IZ, although 


some knew Vlll. 







75 


PART B 
LANGUAGE, 

The first section on language consisted of 12 questions 
which the child must comprehand and then make the necessary 
answer. 

Only 5 pupils made a perfect score in this part of the 
test. Nevertheless the average score out of a possible 12 
was 8,29 or 69^. 

15 pupils scored less than 6 or 50^, 

7 pupils scored 3 or less. 

Many of the students did not know the meaning of trio or 
quartette asked for in Questions 3 and 4. 

The most common error was in Question 8 ; 155 pupils erred 

Most of them either marked one apple or else 3 apples. 

The next most common error was made by 125 pupils in 
failing to judge 4 of the measure in Question 7, 

TELLING TPvIB. 

In the first clock 6,30 or 7,30 was considered a correct 
answer. 

In the third clock 9,15 or 10,15 was considered correct. 

The total score was 3, 

42 pupils scored the full mark. 

47 pupils scored 0. 

The Second clock occasioned the most errors, 136 pupils 
failing; most of them read it as 15 minutes to 2, 

64 pupils failed to read the first clock correctly. 

94 pupils failed to read the third clock, 

DENOMINATE NULIBERS. 

This section con^prises Questions 4-7 inclusive of 
B - 2 and should be a separate section both on the test and 
on the key. The total score was 4 allowed for the 4 questions 

45 pupils scored 4, 25 pupils scored 0, 

Err ors* 

86 pupils erred in stating the number of inches in 1 yd, 

70 pupils erred in stating the number of inches in ft. 

47 pupils mis-stated correct number of pints equal to 1 qt, 

38 pupils failed to give value of -§• dozen. 








76 


PROBLEMS. 

The last section of the test consisted of ten problems 
with an allocation of 2 marts each, out of a possible 20 marts, 
the average score was 12.59. 

16 students scored 20. 

69 students scored 15 or over (75^ or over). 

157 students scored 10 or over (50^ or over). 

20 students scored less than 5 (less than 25^). 

Problems always require examination of the data and using 
relevant data in a reflective process for a desired end. 
Vocabulary and reading comprehension too are taxed. 

Vocabulary weaknesses showed in question number 2 and 9; 
many students did not understand the meaning of the word 
difference or subtract and commonly added the numbers given. 

Then again when a problem has an unfamiliar wording, 
errors occur. Question number 7 brought a variety of answers 
such as 32, 38 and 28. The answer 32 suggests addition while 
38 suggests an error in subtraction of borrowing without 
making allowance for it. 

Several found the wording of Number 10 unfamiliar too 
and though many tried it unsuccessfully, others did not 
attempt it.

TltiE USED 

The tests were not time tests; pupils were reminded that 
they need not hurry. However those v;ho took the longest time 
did not make as high marks as those who used the shortest time. 
On each paper a blank was fill.ed in, showing the time used for 
writing the test. Prom that data the following comparisons are 
made.

Group (a) Indicates the time in minutes and the acres 
of those who finished in the shortest time; beside it is 
another list (b) of the ten students who took the longest time 
with the time, and scores shoi?n. The average of the times in (a) 
is 44<,9 minutes and the average of the scores is 92,2, The 
average of the times in (b) is 166 minutes and the average of 
the scores is 60.3. This would certainly give support to the 
common conception that the very rapid worker is usually more 
accurate than the very slow worker. 

Most of the students used about 90 minutes and the 
list (c) indicates 10 scores chosen in that time class, showing 
an average time of 91.9 minutes and an average score of 79.8 • 
Even here the scores are not as high on the average as those of 
the fastest workers; it was one of the fastest workers who 
made the highest score of the whole 2Q0 pupils virith a mark of 
116. 

The slow student often loses time in trying to remember 
combinations or some factual matter which the faster student 
probably knows more readily. Longer time used d.oes not indica.te 
greater care.

ACTIVITIES 

T^is section required the pupils to draw a line one half 
of a given length, a square of given dimensions, and a circle 
with one third of the area shaded. This was a comprehension test 
as well. The total score was 3, 

43 pupils scored 3, 63 pupils scored 1. 

68 pupils scored 2. 26 pupils scored 0. 

Difficulties may be analy^ied as: 

1. poor judgmentI 

16 apparently guessed at the length of the line. 

84 divided the circle badly;- usually into quarters. 

2. Careless reading: 

24 drew a line twice the given length 

20 made a square of the wrong size - commonly instead 

of li". 

3.4 did not try the section and 4 others seemed to have no 
idea of what was wanted. 

4. 36 made poor squares - sides unequal. 

DENOMIKATE NUMBERS 

15 questions tested for factual knowledge of denominate 
tables; some fractions were included. 

4 pupils scored the full mark of 15. 

59 pupils scored 12 or more, 

102 pupils scored 8 or more. 

41 pupils scored 4 or less. 

Description of Difficulties: 

1. Lack of knowledge of relationships: 

96 pupils apparently lacked the factual knowledge. 

8 did not try the exercise and another 12 pupils had 
little idea of what they were doing and simply put 
down numbers. 

2* Wrong procedures: 

6 pt. ■12 qt. 

12 pupils multiplied instead of dividing. 

3, 48pupils seemed to know the relationsiiips, but added 

or multiplied incorrectly. 

4. Weakness in fractions: 

■g- of $3.60 equals $1.30 or 7^ ft. equal 84 in.

4 inches equals i ft. 

104 pupils showed errors on the first exajni)le 
of $3.60 alone; 36 stated that 4 in. = -Jft. 

PEIACTIONS 

10 questions with a score of 10 comprised this section. 

11 pupils scored 10. 97 pupils scored 5 or more. 

41 pupils scored 8 or more. 83 pupils scored 3 or less. 

Types of Questions and Difficulties Involved: 

1. Changing a fraction to one of equal value with a new 

denominator. ( Question 1) 

88 pupils failed to do this. 

2. 1/3 doz* equals ? The common answer here was 3. 

3. *of* implies mltlplication: (Questions 3, 4, and 7) 

1/3 of 15 equals ? 

72 students erred in these questions but all,with 

the exception of 6, apparently understood the 
procedure but did not know the tables. 

4. Unusual wording of Questions 5 and 6. 

5 is -I of ? 1/3 of _ is 6. 

90 pupils failed in one or both of these examples; 
the common answer to the first was 10; in the 

second example the pupils took l/3 of 6. 

5. Time- Questions 8 and 9. 

i minute equals _ sec. ; 1-J hr. equal _ min. 

80 students failed to answer correctly. 

6. Question 10 required recognition of 12 in. = 1 ft. and it 

required correct multiplication. The connion answer was 
27 in., indicating that l/3 ft. had been considered as 
3 in. to be added to the 24 inches. 

Rjm)A!£EWTALS 

Pour sections were treated in this section - addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

ADDITION 

4 questions were give given - total score was 4. 

72 pupils scored 4 

71 pupils scored 3. 20 pupils scored 1.

Here there were also 4 questions with a score of 4, 

80 pupils scored 4. 

37 pupils scored 3 • 17 pupils scored 1. 

28 pupils scored 2 . 38 pupils scored 0, 


There was a greater variety of errors: 

1. Weakness in combinations - shown by 28 pupils* 


2* Zero in the minuend - 


620

373 

7. 1 pupil deducted 2 from the minuend in borrowing; another 

2 pupils added Instead, 

8 * Subtracting from Zero - 

6 from 0> equals 6; 7 from 0 equals 7* This error 
is similar to type 2 above, and it is difficult 
to be sure about the 4 students classed for this.

37 pupils scored 15 or more, 57 pupils scored 5 or less. 

Division was the lowest showing in the section on 
fundamentals with the average at 48,5^. 

Difficulties:

Difficulties: 

The children seemed to know the relationship of the 
tables; most of them , for example, knew there were 12 in, in 
1 ft. for the first question but said to divide rather than 
multiply; a few suggested adding or subtracting. Bit the chief 
difficulty was whether to multiply or divide. 

The children found the second question the easiest; 46 
pupils answered it correctly; the next highest was 34 correct 
answers for the third question. Question 1 and Question 4 were 
responded to correctly by 30 pupils. 

Of the 7 students who scored full marks, 4 were from 
urban schools and 3 from rural schools. Of the 11 students who 
scored 9 marks, 8 were from rural schools and 3 from urban centres. 

PROBLEMS 

The last section of the test consisted of 12 questions 

(problems) valued at 2 marks each. 

3 pupils scored 24 (full ma.rk) 144 pupils scored 12 or more 

49 pupils scored 18 or more. 21 pupils scored 6 or less. 

T^e average mark for the 200 pupils was 13.7 or 53.1^^ 

Question 1 - Nearly all the students answered this question. 

Question 2 - Pupils either gave the answer or made up a set of 
conditions completely irrelevant. 

Question 5 - Many added the figures given; they did not seem to 
understand the word * subtraction'. 

Qu-^stion 4 - Nearly all did this one*. 

Question 5 - The procedure was nearly always correct; but the 
multiplication by 2 was commonly incorrect. 

Question 6 - Procedure usually correct; common answer was 125 
instead of $1.25.

Question 7 - Faulty reading ; wrong answer v/as usually 35, 

Question 8 - Results in this question wore poor; the pupils 
did not read correctly or else thought that 
remtiinder meant quotient again, thus they gave 
the quotient as the answer. They often divided 
Incorrectly so that 33, 34 , or 36 were comaon 
answers• 

Question 9 - Division by 2 was usual; but 8 was commonly 

written instead of 852^. 

Question 10 - Results were poor; many divided Incorrectly by 4, 

or else they multiplied. 

Question 11 - The common error waste leave out the decimal point 

in $2,40 or else misplace it. The zero was common¬ 
ly omitted. 

Question 12 - This was the hardest question for many. It involved 

3 operations which seemed beyond the ability of a 
large number of the pupils, 

CONCLaSION 

Apparently many of the pupils do not know the meaning of 
subtraction and other terms. In the classroom , there Is often 
too much use of the term, * take-aways* and the child does not 
become sufficiently familiar with the language. Many refer to 
a product or a quotient as an answer and showed In tills test 
that they did not understand the words either In use or in 
spelling. The course requires that pupils be familiar with the 
language necessary for the subject matter. 

There is strong evidence that the fundamentals are 
drilled by mechanical processes. Pupils can multiply or sub¬ 
tract if told what is to be done; but they do not understand 
varieties of presentation of the same situation, so that they 
must decide what figures shall be used and how. More emphasis 
appears to be needed on recognizing procedures required, such 
as the section on generalizations demanded. It also appears 
tliat exactness should be emphasized in form, as for example 
in specifying what a remainder is, in division, A large number 
of students placed the remainder as a whole number after the 
quotient with a minus sign between them.

SPELLING. 


Section One of Part A of the test allotted 18 marks for 
18 words to be written as dictated by the teacher. 

2 students scored 18. 154 students scored 9 or more 

98 students scored 14 or more. 16 students scored 5 or less 


The mode was 25. 

There was a great variety of mistakes. The first word 
average was usually correct, so also were rod, wheat, barley 
and mile. 


1. account - was most commonly written acount; an error 
occurring 156 times. 

2. perimeter - misspelled 112 times either left out the i 
or placed i instead of e before t. 

3. temperature - spelled either temperture or temperchure 
ranked next with 108 errors. 

4. thermometer - ranked close with 96 errors. 

5. statement - was commonly spelled statment - 92 errors. 

6. rectajigle - spelled as recktangle showed error 48 times. 

7. section - had varied speliiiigs amountirig to 56 errors. 

8. vogetables - misspelled 76 times usually had an a after 
the g. 

9. sales - a considerable number, 28 in all, wrote sails. 

Spelling should be closely associated with pronounciation. 

The errors seemed to indicate that the students were trying to 

spell the words as they are commonly pronounced.

Comments on Questions and Difficulties. 

1. Few pupils had a clear idea of what average meant. The 
first 2 questions demanding this knowledge reflected 
140 pupils did not know what to do; several drew a line 
but so incorrectly that it was clear they had had no 
definite plan of procedure. 

E. 75^ of the pupils were not able to tell how to multiply 

by 100; they said to add one zero or to add the numbers. 
But many of these students did multiply by 100 correctly 
in the multiplication exercises. So it would appear 
that the mechanical processes are known better than the 
methods of procedure. 

3. Questions 4 and 6 were of the same type - to ascertain 
whether the pupil knew when to divide or multiply. 

Here lay the error for again 75^ of the pupils said 
to multiply - Question 4 and to divide in Question 6. 

Most of them knew the Denominate Numbers relationships. 

In question 4 the pupils seem to have been thinking, 

"There are more quarts", so multiply. And in the last 
question a rod appeared bigger - so divide. 

4. Question 5 was answered best; still it wanted to see if 
the child knew a square from a rectangle; 34^ did not 
make that distirretion. 

DENOMINATE NUMBERS. 

Twenty one blanks gave opportunity for showing nearly 
all the denominate numbers tables required - length, volume, 
number, area and bushel weights of different grains as the 
total score was 21. Manipulation of fractions was required 
in five cases. The average score was 11.35 or 54.4^. 

1 student scored 21 flOO^) 112 students scored 11 or mare 
40 students scored 16 or more, students scored 5 earless . 


The mode was 13

Errors:- 

1. Weakness in Denominate Relationships* 64^ of the pupils 
did not know all the tables. This was particularly 
noticeable in weights of bushels of different grains and 
in yards or rods in a mile. The student commonly said 
5,280 yds. to a mile, having thought of feet apparently. 

2. There were 52 cases for 16^^) of mistakes in calculation 
that indicated difficulties with multiplication tables 

or fractions. Common among these was ll/6ft. equals 15". 

3. There were examples of multiplying where dividing was 
required as illustrated in the error, 13 pt, equal 26 qt. 

4. Question 14 regarding area was omitted by many; as well 
25^ made a mistake in the answer. Usually they subtracted 
the 6 (length of a side)^Jthe 40 (area in square feet). 
Pupils in Grade IV often do not study area. These 
confused area with perimeter. 

5. 6 students showed the error of marking the remainder as a 
minus quantity after the quotient. For Question 10 the 
answer thus shown was : 13 pt. equal 6 - 1 qt.

The total mark allotted, was 15, there being 4 marks for the 
first question. 

2 pupils scored 15 flOO^) 116 pupils scored 8 or more 
27 pupils scored 12 or more. 40 pupils scored 4 or less. 

The average (arithmetic mean) was 7.59. The mode was 9. 

Types of Errors: 

1. Addition instead of subtraction. 

^ i equals Sg - 2i equals Sf. 

112 pupils or 56^ made this error, apparently not 
understanding the minus sign. 

2. Lack of knowledge of equivalent fractions. 

^ equals 8/6 equals 12/4. 

40 pupils (20fo) erred in procedure of changing fraction to 
one of equal value with a new denominator. 

3. Adds Numerators. 

1/9 plus 1/9 plus 1/9 equals 3. 

8 pupils (4^) showed this mistake. They do not understand 
nature of a denominator. 

4. Add Denominators. 

1/9 plus 1/9 plus 1/9 equals 27. 1/3 plus 1/6 equals 9. 

22^ of the students failed to express knowledge of adding 
numerators and putting the sum over the common denominator. 

5. Does not understand need of a common denominator for 
addition or subtraction. 

1/3 plus 1/6 equals 2/9. 

2Sfo of pupils erred in this regard. 

6. Adds all numbers in mixed fractions: 

5^ plus ^ equals 13. 

(5 plus 2 plus 4 equals 13). This was not common but 5 
examples were noted. 

7j. Poor knowledge of Multiplication Tables: 
l/s of 56 equals 8. 

22% of pupils erred in calculations of this type*

PART B 

The second part of the test consisted of exercises on 
the four fundamentals and a set of 12 problems. 

ADDITION 

4 questions of 1 mark each comprised this section. The 
average mark was 3.2 or 80^. This was the highest average mark 
made for any section of the test, 

94 pupils scored 4 (100$^ ) 27 students scored 2 

62 pupils scored 3 14 students scored 1 

3 students scored 0. 

The types of questions were four digits wide and four 
digits high in two examples and three digits wide and four 
digits high in four other questions, two of which Involved 
dollars and cents. 

Three main types of errors occurred: 

1. Weakness in combinations. 

6 plus 4 plus 5 equals 16 

1794 

7686 

12746 

This was the most common type of error and appeared on 
49^ of the papers. 

2. Carrying difficulties. 

3265 

1794 

7686 

11735 

20^ of the pupils failed to »carry' in the second and in 
the last columns. 

3. Neglect of dollar sign and decimal point. 

$ 8.25 
4.49 
3.74 
2.95

4* Addition instead of subtraction, 

7 examples of this error appeared. 

3761 

9865 


5* Deduction of 2 from the minuend in borrowing* 

pupil subtracted 2 from 5, 

2946 ^ 

3054 7 examples of this error appeared. 

This error is similar to type 1, but usually the pupil 
had crossed out the 7 and marked a 5, thus indicating v\iiat 


the nature of the error was* 


MULTIPLICATION 

The examples in this section included facts to 10 times 10 
with multiplication by one and two digit numbers. Multiplication 
by 10 and 100 was included as well, so that all demands of the 
course were represented* Dollar and cents questions were included, 

31 pupils scored 14 marks (100^) 

106 pupils scored 11 or more, 18 pupils scored 4 or less* 

166 pupils scored 7 or more* 5 pupils scored 0. 

Types of Difficulties: 

1. Weakness in multiplication tables, 

472 

46 Pupil states 4 times 7 is 29. 

2 ^ 

1898 

365^ of the pupils erred through lack of knowledge of 
the multiplication tables.

30^ of the pupils did no* understand the procedure for 
the 2®ro. 

(h) Zero in the multiplier and in the multiplicand. 

100 times 20 equals 200, 

4 cases of errors appeared of this type. Apparently 
the students were applying the rule to add two zeros 
when multiplying by 100 and have overlooked the zero in 
the 20, 

3, Carrying difficulties. 

256 

73 

758 

Pupil did not carry the 1 from the 18 to add with 
the product of 3 times 5.

3 pupils did not understand placing the product of 
4 times 2 directly under the 3 below the multiplier,4, 

DIVISION 

Ten examples comprised this section with division 
of four place numbers by one digit divisors. The idea of 

division to find averages had been tested for in the

In the first two examples it appears the students were 

saying 2 goes into 16 8 times; zero into zero goes 0. In the 

last case the student either considered the answer was nothing 

or else neglected all the zeros. 

32 % of the pupils erred in this type.

PROBLEMS. 

Twelve problems comprised the last section 
of the test. Averages, simple fractioned and de- 
nomin'te table relationships involving the four oper¬ 
ations were all represented. One question asked 
for a sales slip giving an extra 2 marks for form. 
Thus total score for the set of problems was 26. 

1 pupil scored 26 (lOO^) 

10 pupils scored 18 or more

Difficulties; It is difficult to ascertain the nature of 
errors in many of the problems as no work is shown. 

In the suggestions for ehanges in the test, I would 
suggest space be given on the paper v/here calculations 


are to be shown.

Question 1 was on the average of lengths but the student 
may have erred through ignorance of the denomin¬ 
ate tables, or m .nipulation of fractions. But 
what seemed most prob^ole was that the student, not 
understanding averages, left the siim of the lengths 
as the answer. 

Question 2. Many gave as the answer; the cost of the 6 
tickets and did not subtract this from the 

Question 5, Many multiplied the 90 times the without 
ehanging the pounds to bushels. Some did not use 
60 pounds as the weight of a bushel of potatoes. 

Question 4. The price was 11^^ a quart. There was 5 

gallons of milk. The common error was to multiply 
5x11. Students failed to change the gallons to 
quarts. 


Question 5. The usual error in the estimate arose from 
neglecting the fractions and multiplying the 
whole numbers, so that $2.72 was a common answer. 

Question 6. This was easier for over 75^ of the students 
did what was asked for. 

Question 7. This is a question on area. Few children of 
Grade IV seem to understand area in sq. ft. Many 
of them added the length and Tiridth. 

Question 8. The error here arose from saying to add the 
length and width together and then not mentioning 
to multiply the sum by two. 

Question 9. The stud.ents did not have a good grasp of the 
fractional idea. Others did not understand the 
question. Many added the numbers; e.g. 5 ft., 

5i in, equal lOi ft. Some gave as an answer to this 
example 5i ft. I 7/ould suggest putting the word 
whole before foot in the question.

Question 10. Error most common was to multiply the number 
of eggs (72) times the prxce per dozen (ibi^-) • 

Students failed to reason from the reading that 
they must have the number of dozen since the price 
applied to a dozen. 

Question 11. The student did not establish the relationship 

betv/een 20 minutes and 2^ hours. Nearly all the errors 
arose from multiplying the time it took to walk a mile 
by the total time. 

20 X .2^ equals 50 miles. 

Question 12. Most students tried to use the data on the 
question as the body of the sales slip by ruling 
lines around it and leaving off the heading. Many 
wrote ^’Bought of Mrs. BroiAn” instead of ’’Sold to”. 

Errors in calculation usually arose from 
failing to multiply the cost per unit by the 
quantity number. 

e.g. 4 loaves of bread .10 

2 lbs. butter .23 

Others made mistakes in addition by faulty 
combination.

the 9 means hundreds, 
the 6 means tens. 

This was the source of greatest error, 61^ erred. 
LANGUAGE. 

1 question on Fahrenheit scales and freezing point of 
water and 3 questions on the relationship of remainder 
and quotient to each other comprised this section of the 
test for an allocation of 4 marlcs. The average score 
was 1,39. The mode was 1,

The arithmetic mean for fractions by score was 
23.5 or 63.6^. The mode was 25. 

1 student scored 37 (full mark). 

68 students scored 28 or more. 

146 students scored 19 or more. 

7 students scored 9 or less. 

Types of Errors: 

!• Lack of knowledge of proper and improper fractions* 

20^ showed inability to distinguish improper fractions 
from mixed numbers. 

Sfo showed inability to distinguish proper fractions 
from improper fractions. 

2. Failure to understand common denominator principle. 

(a) Uses larger denominator as common one. 

f plus 5/6 - 8/6. 5/12 minus ^ - 4/l2. 

i plus 5/6 equals 6/6 or 1. 

16/^ erred in this type, 
fb) Adds Denominators. 

•f plus 5/6 equals 8 / 10 . 

8% showed this type of error. 

3. Adds with minus sign. 

3/5 minus ^ equals ll/lO. 

12^ erred in this respect. 

4. Errors in calculation were shown by 32^. 

5. 605^ were unable to interpret Question 11 regarding the 
dimensions of the plan for the house. 

6. Marking a fractional part of the circles in Question 1 
baffled many; about 30% erred in marking 2/3 of the 
circle by marking in of it. That was done by many 
students who had correctly indicated of the second 
circle. 

7. About 4^ of the pupils failed to reduce their fractions 


to lowest terms

stand ’carrying' 10 of liie tenths and leaving the .4. 

6 ^ erred in decimals. 

SUBTRACTIOl^. 

Decimals, dollars and cents, and numbers 6 digits wide 
comprised the eight examples on tlis section of the test for 
a total allocation of 8 marks.

Weakness in comlDination. 

22 ^ showed weakness in use of multiplication tables. 

10 ^ ignored the dollar sign and decimal point. 

32^ erred in the examples with 3 digit multipliers; 
most of the errors were weaknesses in multiplication 
tables over and above those listed under Error No.l 
above. There were more mistakes in adding the numbers 
too, but it was difficult to determine the percentage of 
errors due to this as work was commonly not shown. 

DIVISION 

14 marks were allocated to this last section of the 
Part B test. 3 digit divisors were included in the 
group of problems. 

The average mark for division was 7.36 or 52.5^.

PART C* 

Fourteen problems constituted this section of the test 
with 3 marks allotted to each of the first ten questions 
and one each to the last four questions. Baking 34 as a 
to tal• 

Fractions, scale drawings, square measure, averages 
and problems involving the four operations were all on the 
section. There was more demand for reasoning on the part 
of the pupil in analysis of situations. Careful reading 
was needed and apparently was lacking in many cases. 

0 pupil scored 34 (full mark). 

13 pupils scored E5 or more. 

64 pupils scored 17 or more. 

43 pupils scored 8 or less.

Discussion of Error Types: 

Question 1. The answer here was usually 9; few students 
counted the i-, although some wrote 9 and 8 over. 

The idea Cf averages was better than in Grade lY. 
Question 2. Students nearly all said the 65 books would cost 
more, but it usually developed that they compared 
that price of 55{z( to the 4052 ( price in the first 
situation. This however was one of the easier 
questions for most of the students, 67^ getting a 
correct response. 

Question 3. Here was a simple subtraction problem with tJnit 
fractions; only 21^ failed to make the correct 
response. Some of these made mistakes in subtraction. 
40i - 26i equals 16i; this was an error of 


i

subtracting 6 from 0 is 6. 

Question 4. Response was poorer; 61^ made mistakes; many of 
these appeared to be from wrong remainders in the 
division. Work was not usually shown. Others put 
15 hrs. and ignored the remainder; the others usually 
said 15 hr., El minutes instead of writing 2l/48 hr. 

Question 5. This was a question on scale-drawing. Very few 
analyzed it correctly. A large number multiplied 2^ 
times 250. Sven those who sensed 2^ in equal 250 miles 
did not show they must get the equivalent for unit inches. 

78% missed the proper interpretation. 

Question 6. 61^ of the students failed to change the pounds 

of wheat to bushels before multiplying by the given 
price per bushel; a few of the group did try to make 
the change but erred in the calculation. 

Question 7. There was more money turned in by the girls, so 
nearly everyone put down girls as an answer. 

70^ of the students did not understand the idea of 
average because they proceeded to subtract the 
$125.32 (boys' gross sale) from the $180.54 (girls' 
gross sale). Thus the usual ansv/er was $55.22 

Question 8. This was a question of equivalent fractions, 
but many students interpreted as meaning an increase 
in the value of the fraction. 

Question 9. 75^ of the students failed to understand 

considering 20 pounds as a fractional part of the 
total weight of 50 lbs. The usual error was to 
compare the 20 lb. to the remaining 30 lb. and give 
an answer of 2/3. 

Question 10. This involved area in acres of a piece of 






116 


land 1 mile by 2 miles. 65^ of the pupils did not know 
the relationship of acres to square miles. The answers 
were varied; many wrote 2 acres - product of 2 and 1; 
others added 1 plus 2. Many had 1920 acres which 
represented addition of the dimensions and then 
multiplying 640. These students were not clear about 
how to find area. 

Question 11. Many did not know meaning of included and so 
did not count Sunday, answer given was |l5,00 
(6 X i|2*50). Others made the mistakes in multiplying 
by 7. The total group making errors was 22^ of the 
whole number. 

Question 12. The usual error here was a faulty calculation 
of the number of pints in a gallon. Most confused 
quarts with it and multiplied by 4 giving an answer 
of 56 students or 28^ erred. 

Question 13. Most students realized that one would go 60 

times as far in sixty times as long, but some merely 
wrote 60 as an answer. Others made a mistake 
saying 60 x 20 is 120. 

Question 14. The common answer was However many out 

of the 108 students who erred in this question wrote 
- apparently they divided 16 into 24 and wrote the 
remainder as an answer. 

On the whole the problem section indicated that 

the pupils had not re-read the questions to clarify the 

nature of the question. Most of the errors arose from 

starting out with a misunderstanding of what was wanted. 

There is much problem work recommended for the Grade 7 

course in arithmetic and every care needs to be taken 

to see that a critical sense of analysis is developed. 

It is assumed that a student should have mastered the 

fundamental operations and main facts regarding 
denominate relationships.

PART C 

The Part C of the test had 2 questions - one on 
Graph interpretation and another section on problems. 

GRAPHS 

Here were two questions - one of reading from the 
graph certain elevations indicated by bars; then there was 
plotting elevators by bars on the same diagram. 5 marks 
was allotted to each section. 

The mode was 7. The average was 5.32. 

13 scored 10 (full mark) 

53 scored 8 or more. 

124 scored 5 or more. 

56 siffored 3 or less. 

24^ of the students erred in reading the represent¬ 
ations in Question 1. 

38^ erred in drawing bars on the diagram to represent 
elevations. 

Many did not try the second section. 

PROBLEMS 

Ten problems comprised the last section of the Part 
G test. Question 5 received 3 marks for each part, thus 
the total score for problems was 33. The mode was 12. 

The average for problems was 9.41 or 25.5^. 

0 students scored full marks. 

4 students scored 25 or more. 

37 students scored 17 or more. 

110 students scored 9 or more. 

33 students scored 0. 

Discussion of Problem Difficulties: 

Question 1. 74^ failed to express understanding of what 

was wanted, most students who did not read carefully 
tried to subtract though the answer to the subtraction 
was often 1:|-. A very large number made mistakes in

manipulating the mixed numbers. 

Question 2. This question im'olved division of 60^ by 
a mixed number and multiplying the quotient by a 
mixed number. There is no work shown to account 
for the great variety of answers. 68'^ erred in 
doing the question. Many wrote 40^/ as if an esti¬ 
mate were in their minds. 

Question 3, The usual error arose from not changing the 
10 inches to feet. This was one of the heaviest 
failures on the section. 88^ failed to get the ques¬ 
tion. A few added the dimensions. 

Question 4. 50^o did not get this question. Many divideu 

instead of multiplying. A few made errors in calcul¬ 
ation. A large number did not try the exercise. 

Question 5. Those who missed the first part of the question 
usually made a mistake in placing the decimal point* 

A much larger group failed to calculate the number 
of square feet for the second part of the question; 
thus a common answer here was 19.125 lb. In many 
cases the answer 18.275.1b. appeared. 60^’ failed 
to do the problem. 

Question 6. The chief error lay in not changing the sq. 

ft. to sq. yds. 58^ erred in this question. Many 
errors were made by calculating perimeter instead of 
area. 

t 

Question 7. 2 types of errors accurred; many thought of 

time at Ottawa as being earlier and so put 9 o'clock 
instead of 5 p. m. A very large group did not try 
this question. Many others tho’oght there was one 
degree short of the 45 difference and^-so only a 
differnnce of 2 hours and wrote 2 p. m. as the answer. 

74;^ erred on the question.

Question 8, 62^ erred on oaloulatiag the area by si.ap^y 

multiplying the dimensions given. 

Question 9. 54}o erred on this question. There were rnariy 

varieties of answers, expressei the ans\7er as 

a common fraction,- lo/f^l or o/lO. Ofliars /rota 
50 - equal 15,a. 

Question 10. The common answer was_a l/3 or 33 l/3^. 78^ 

of the students erred; chief cause seems to have 
been thoughtless reading that resulted in finding 
the fractional part £0 W'as of GO.

Description of Errors: 

1. ^ifo of pupils considered the perpendiculars were equal 
and thus gave three sides of one triangle respectively 
equal to three sides of the other. 

8 % had showed no idea in the attempt made. 

2* ZZ% gave as an answer that the two sides and diagonal 
were respectively equal. 

DA, AB and DB respectively equal DC, BG and Du, 

The diagonal having been given required demonstr¬ 
ation of the knowledge that a diagonal bisects the 
angles through which it passes. 

3. dfo did arrange the sides or angles in a respective order, 

4. 8 $) failed to make the proper construction for Question 
3; 40^ failed to write a correct proof. 

IKEEREl^GES 

4 marks were allocated to the 16 blanks to 
be filled in the first Question on diagonals in 
this section. The remaining 3 questions were 
allotted 4 marks each, making the total score for 
Inferences 16 marks. The mode was 3. 

0 pupils scored 16, 

6 pupils scored 12 or more. 

32 pupils scored 8 or more. 

124 pupils scored 4 or less. 

Types of Errors: 

1. 12^ did not express knowledge regarding bisection of 
angles by diagonals. 

4^erred in the section regarding diagonals bisect¬ 
ing each other. 

8^0 erred in the last part regarding equality of 
diagonals. 

2. 48^ did not specify units in giving the answer to 
Question 2. 

56^ did not recognize the rates d)f 18:12 or 1 ^ 
to 1 and thus gave a variety of incorrect figures.

3. 24'^ erred in Question 3 by subtracting 6” from 15", 
giving an answer of 9". 

12'^ subtracted 15" from 21 in., giving an answer of 
6 in. 

8^ subtracted 6 in. from 21.21 in., giving an answer 
of 15.21 in. 

4. In Question 4; 

16^ erred in the first part by saying yes. 

40^ erred in mixing ideas of perimeter and area. 

24^ drew three separate parallelograms without showing 
any proper relationship. 

24^ in comparing area, multiplied the base by the end 
instead of by the altitude. 

LANGUAGE 

Ten questions comprised this section. A total 
of 20 marks was allotted. Five questions required con¬ 
structions as interpretations if written data. 

1 pupil scored 20 (full mark) 

11 pupils scored 15 or more. 

40 pupils scored 10 or morel 

97 pupils scored 5 or less. 

The average score was 6.55 or 32.7^ 

Glassification of Errors: 

1. In questions 2 and 3, 64?^ did not understand the question; 
many in question 1 simply reflected in the blank the words 
of the question. 

2. In Question 3, 44^ drew the figures similar. 

3. In Question 4. results were better; 12^ erred by making 
both angles and'sides similar. 

4. 470 erred in interpreting Question 5 correctly. 

5. 8^ erred in Question 6 and 8. 

6. liZio erred in Questions 7, 9 and 10. 

Question 10 might be worded "median to the liase" 

for the only answer of an "isosceles triahgle". As the 
question reads an equilateral triangle might be a correct 
answer as well. 




165 


TEST B 

This seotion of the geometry test consisted 
of 4 sections--Sy(netry, Loous, Right angled Triangle, 
and Constructions. The total score was 45. 

SYMMETRY. 

Nine questions rated at 1 mark each comprised 
this first section of the test. Five questions were 
on axes of symmetry and four on point symnetry of 
various plane figures. 

1 pupil scored 9 (full mark). 

37 pupils scored 7 or more. 

114 pupils scored 5 or more. 

46 pupils scored 3 or less. 

The average was 4.77 or 53^ 

The mode was 5. 

Errors: 

1. 36^ erred in saying that a circle has 1 axis of 
symmetry. 

12/^ stated it ha§ 4 axis of symmetry. 

2. 12/b erred in stating that an isosceles triangle has 
2 axis of'symmetry; the idea arose, no doubt from 
the idea oi 2 equal sides for the triangle . Idea 
of the median from the vertex is not clear. 

3. 20^ erred in stating that a rectangle has 4 axis of 
symmetry. Most of these had answered 4 for the 
previous question on the square. 

The common error in all these expressions is 
that the child was not cleai^rwhat an axis of symmetry 
is. He must develop the idea that the two halves of 
the figure folded along the axis will coincide and 
that certain figures can only be folded in certain ways. 

4. 31^ erred in point symmetry in stating that a rectangle 
has not point symmetry. (Question ^). 

16/^ erred by replying in the affirmative for Question 
6 >

erred in Question 7 by stating a square does 
not have point symmetry. 

(Point symmetry is not dealt with very fully 
in the text) 


LOCUS 


Six questions with an allocation of 8 marks 
comprised this section. The mode was 1. The 
average was 2. or 25^. 

1 pupil scored 6 marks. 

5 pupils scored 6 marks or more. 

32 pupils scored 4 or more. 

133 pupils scored 2 or less. 

Types of errors: 

There was a general weakness in showing 
comprehension of the meaning of locus. Most 
students answered the first question correctly. 

Question 2. 24^ erred; usually the answer was a 

straight line (20^). 4^ wrote a rectangle; 

perhaps this was closer if it had been conceived 
of as standing on its edge. 

Question 3. This Tjuestion had two parts. 

fa) 20^ erred in answering, a straight line. 

4:% erred in answering a circle. 


(b)

inches long. 

CONSTRUCTION 

Construction 7 and 8 and Theorem 21 of 
the text comprised the^test'on Construction

!• 24^ used the wrong mwthod in dividing the line in 

four parts. 

The usual error was to bisect the line and 
then bisect each of the halves. 

2. 16^ erred in the construction or in the designation 
of the right triangle which equaled the area of the 
given quadrilateral.

ALGEBRA 

The test on Algebra consisted of eight 
divisions with a table score of 109. The 
median was 61.4. 

^ was 49^1; was 76.2 

The results in Algebra were higher tnan 
for Geometry. The average in Algebra being 
51.7^ while that for Geometry was 37^. 

SPELLING 

Six words were given with an allocation of 
6 marks. 

92 pupils scored 6 marks. 

161 pupiis scored 4 marks or more. 

172 pupils scored 3 marks or more. 

27 pupils scored 2 or less. 

The mode was 6. 

Errors; 

1. The heaviest error was on the word, binomial. 44^ 
erred in spelling it as bionomial or as binotiiol. 

2. 40'/^ erred in spelling trinomial; the type of error 
was the same as number 1. 

3. 28/i erred in the spelling of polynomial; the usual 
error was polonomial. 

4. 28^ also erred in writing exponent as exponent. 

5. 20/O erred in spelling monomial. 

It is suggested that the terms,- monomial, 
binomial, trinomial and polynomial need to be 
used more freg.uently in the classroom usage, so 
that students be more familiar with the technical 
terminology of the subject. 

ADDITION 

Eight questions valued at 8 marks comprised 
the section. The test emphasized the use of plus 
or minus signs in addition.

It is possible that these stud' nts to'^’' 
out the 6 as a positive quantity and then sub¬ 
tracted it from 7. 

MULTIPLICATION 

4 questions were pl)aced in this section. 

172 pupils scored 4 marks (full mark). 

18 pupils scored 3. 

7 pupils scored 2. 

2 pupils scored 1. 

1 pupil scored 0. 

The average was 94.7^. 

Errors: 

1 . Does not recognize unlike signs give minus. 

(plus 6) times (minus 4) equal plus 24. 

6% erred in this. 

2 . 7^ erred in writng 2 minuses give a product with 
a minus sign. 

(minus 3) times (minus 7) equal minus 21. 

3 . 4% showed weakness in multiplication tables. 

DIVISION 

7 examples Valued at 1 mark each comprised 
this section of the Signed Numbers. 

The average was 5.48 dr 78.2^. 

The node was 7. 

61 pupils scored 7 

164 pupils scored 5 or more. 

177 pupils scored 4 or more. 

9 pupils scored 2 or less. 

The most common error occurred in Question 
27; the answer usually given was 10. 64/^ erred 

in this particular type. In Question 28 mstny also 
erred, but there was less tendency there to divide 
by the wrong number.

2. 56^ did not change the sign of a number within a 
bracket when a minus sign preceded the brackets. 

Question No. 3 and No. 8 revealed this 
weakness most commonly. 

3. 64;^ erred in dividing the indices in division. 

Question 16 

a^^ V a^ equal a^ was the usual 
answer. 

4. 48^ erred in treatment of indices in multiplication. 

35h^ times 5h equal 175h^ 

5. 28/^ erred in Question 8 in making substitutions in 
the expression.

117 pupils scored 8 or more. 

41 pupils scored 4 or less. 

The average score was 8.3 or 55.3^. 

The mode was 12. 

Description of Errors: 

1. 52^ erred in transferring terms. 

2. 705^ erred in Question 5 -- the usual answer was 

T 

pt plus p - a. 

3. 16^ showed weakness in combinations. 

4. The greatest difficulty in Question 3 appeared to 
be in the calculation of the fractions; 52^ erred 
in this question alone. 

Question 2 had the least errors of the group. 

PR0BLE3i/IS 

4 problems in whcih the student had to 
write his own equations constituted the last 
section of the test. The total value was 20 
marks. 

5 pupils scored 20 marks (full mark) 

13 pupils scored 15 marks or more. 

42 pupils scored 10 marks or more. 

151 pupils scored 5 marks or less. 

The average mark was 4.59 or 22.9^. 

Errors: 

1. 56^ erred in forming equations. 

2. 12^ erred in calculation. 

3. 10^ failed to recognize the relationships in a 
right angled triangle in Question 4. 

The heaviest failure was in Problem 4, 

88^ failed to formulate the proper equation or 
miscalculating.

The figures given in the second column are for the 
results of 195 of the students listed in the first column. 

The writer sent in the names of the writers of the Survey 
Tests and received the raw scores made "by all those students 
who wrote the final examination in the next month. Five sb-id- 
ents of the lot did not \wclte and so the figures in the second 
column are computed on the basis of 195 cases. 

Though the median and other Quartiles are hlgner in 
the June examination, it is most significant that there also 
the students had greater difficulty v/ith tne geometry section 
of the examination as they had had in May with the Survey Test, 
Continued review and the attitude attendant witn a final exam¬ 
ination may have been factors in increasing the results snown

SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES IN TESTS. 

Grade II: Question 7 and 8 of A-2;- children iniesed read¬ 
ing the heading, ’’By how many is”; They 

read: 

200 is greater thaii 180 and wrote yes or 380. 

The error in Number 8 was similar, the answer 
commonly being yes. 

The question should read: 

Number 7: By how many is 200 greater thaji 180? 
Number 8: By how many is 60 less than 100?_ 

Section A-2 should be in four sub-sections: 

1. The first 4 questions are on ’Arriting numbers 
for which the key allots 4 marks. 

2. The next four questions on Number Senses 
should be set appart as number 1, 2, 3 and 

4 and the similar separation made on the key. 

3. The next five questions belong to a sub-sect¬ 
ion of Notation and the key should similarly 
show this sub-division v/ith an allocation of 

5 marks. 

4. The questions designated as 14 - 22 inclusive 
areaan assorted Group that might be numbered 
1-9 inclusive and indicated similarly on 
the key with the total allocation of 17 marks 
allowed. 

Such division would facilitate marking and 
give more definite classification of the difficul¬ 
ties involved for the benefit of teachers. 

The course of study for Grade II requires 
that children should be able to count by 2's to 
50, (page 264), starting at any limits; the 

question, number_, asking for the even numbers 

betv/een 30 and 50 was no doubt based on this; 
but a child may count by 2's and not associate

that with the idea of even numbers past 20 accord¬ 
ing to Section 13, page 264 of the Course of Studies 
A change in the wording of this question viould seem 
warranted. I would also suggest that in the assort¬ 
ed question this same question gets credit for 9 
marks out of the total of 17 whereas there were at 
least five items of factual knowledge asked for 
altogether. 

Section B-E should have further sub-divisions 
Questions 4-7 inclusive pertain to Denominate 
Numbers and for easier classification should be a 
separate sectio 2 ;i, numbered 1-4 inclusive both on 
the text and on the key* 

In the subtraction section I would suggest 
an example with the zero in the subtrahend as an 
item of knowledge to be checked in its relation to 
the difficulties arising from a zero in the minuend* 

Grade III: This is a very comprehensive survey test for 
Grade III* Many teachers may feel that only one 
third of the marks is not enough for the fundamental 
processes as they consider this part of the course, 
the chief work of Grade III. But this test will 
indicate just what the scope of the course is and 
it gives proper regard for all phases of it* 

It is a moot point whether Grade III should 
be expected to do the last question in Division 
involving the proper placing of the decimal point* 

It is also suggested that the last question 
on the course is a three step operation and 
appears beyonl the requirements of the Course* 

Grade 17: Spelling should be closely associated with 
pronounciation^ The errors seemed to indicate 





180 


that a student was trying to spell the word as 
it is conomonly pronounced. 

The last question should hHve an allocation 
of 4 raariis -- 2 for the form and 2 for the answer; 
thus 26 would be the score on the last section 
giving a total of 118 on the whole papers 

Area is dealt with in Grade V; the question 
involving sq. ft. appeared to advanced for Grade 
IV, Page 270 of the Course of Study relegates 
areas of squares and rectangles in sq. ft, to the 
Grade V course. Grade IV study perimeter and since 
the common error arose from an idea of perimeter, 
it is likely that many of the students had not 
taken work in area yet. 

In Question Number 9 of the Problem section 
I would suggest inserting the word whole before 
"foot". The sentence would thus read: "Rewrite 
the following measures to the nearest whole foot", 

A word may be said about the placing of 
remainders after the quotient with a minus sign 
separating them. A very large number of studnnts 
did this in several grades and many teachers 
acquiesce in this procedure. But it may be men¬ 
tioned that the text book is very definite it its 
instructions regarding the correct representation 
of the remainder. 

Grade V; A large part of the test required analysis. 

There was good attention given to the language 
of arithmetic in this test paper. There must 
be language and spelling as familiarity with 
the terminology of the subject is part of the 
content of the course. This was a good survey 
test in that nearly all principles demanded by

the course of study were represented. I would 
suggest that multipiioation of numbers each con¬ 
taining zeroes, such as 100 by 100, mig>t be 
included in the examples. Grade IV papers in¬ 
dicated considerable difficulty with zeroes in 
multiplication* Questions 1 and 3 of the 
language section requested a choice between 
larger and smaller. The child's usual experience 
in Grade V division is that the quotient is 
larger and when the question suggested, a choice 
between larger and smaller, the experience would 
prompt an answer, "larger". 

Grade VI: This test was very comprehensive and should 

form an excellent means for teachers to study the 
weaknesses of their classes. 

Grade VII: In the Grade Vll tests, an error appeared 
in the second "amount" under Question 3 of 
Insurance section; the amount .ipl2.90 should 
be -^1290.00. It might be an advantage in the 
B part of the paper under Problems to put 
Questions 6-10 inclusive under a separate 
section designated as Constructions. 

Grade VIII: In Question 5 of Mathematical Truths, the 
length of DB should be stated. I would suggest 
that a greater difference than one sixteenth 
of an inch be made between the sides AC and BC 
and between the sides EP and DP respectively. 

Of course if the student measures AB exactly as 
1 3/I6 inches and BC as 1 2/I6 inches, then he 
should be able to choose the corresponding sides 
of 1 I2/I6 in. and 1 II/I6 in. respectively 
if he measures carefully in the second triangle.

Grade IX: 

Congruence 

Question E; 'Ihe key suggests the oorresponding sides 
as an answer. But it would appear that the diagonal 
and the sets of corresponding angles res'ilting from 
the hisection by the diagonal might be given as a 
correct answer. 

Language: 

Question 1: The answer should read; 

AG^ plus equal 4AB^ 

Question 10: As the question reads, equilateral 
triangle would also be a correct answer. Question 
should read; In what case is the median to the base 
of a triangle. Also a right bisector* 

Part B - Geometry: 

Symmetry; There is little information in the text 
book about point symmetry. The only reference to 
figures other than a circle is on page 320 of the 
text in Question 4 of the Quiz, which asks, "Does 
any tjrpe of quadrilateral have symmetry about a 
point?" 

Algebra: 

The total score for this test is 109 rather 


than 110

GiiaJifiRAL CONCLUSIONS 

In a written diagnostic test it is difficult to find all 
the errors such as counting or others that verbal statements 
would reveal. 

Insistence on pupils showing their work on the space 
provided would facilitate further diagnosis. 

Although there is evidence that mechanical drill on the 
four fundamental operations of arithmetic receives the great¬ 
est emphasis, yet there is an abundance of errors throughout 
the grades in the number combinations and use of the multip¬ 
lication tables. The mechanical drill has no doubt 
emphasized a symbolism quite separate from any significant 
experience with the concepts involved. Any sjunbolisra should 
have its basis on an association with concrete materials. 

’^en a child, having learned counting, combines one object 
with three objects he finds by experience that he has four 
objects, and he may associate the symbolism of one plus 3 
with that experience. If learning is based on forming cer¬ 
tain connections, then a proper connection for a correct 
response should be established at first. Combinations may 
just as well be learned correctly the first time, as it 
should be as easy to associate the correct answer with a com¬ 
bination as the wrong number. Notation must be clearly 
understood and then combinations established in association 
with meaningful activity. Mere repetition of a corrected 
answer to a combination is not a satisfactory substitute 
for the required experience. ResJ-ization of the uniqueness 
of our number system demands that careful direction be given 
the child in each step in the process of learning the number 
symbolism. Number combinations are important in all the 
fundamental operations and are equally necessary in other 
parts of the subject as in denominate relationships. Each 
grade includes more new concepts of the number symbolism 
that must be established on the factual knowledge of previous 
grades.

It is apparent In the tests that the meohanioal drill 
alone on fundamental operations has not justified Itself as 
an only method. Errors in number oombinations occurred 
throughout the grades, although there is usually a lessening 
of the percentage of errors in the higher grades. In addi¬ 
tion weakness in combinations increased from 28^ in Grade II 
to 40^ and 49^ in Grades III and IV respectively. There 
was little lessening of this rate of error until Grade VI, 
where the errors fell to 16^, Two column addition caused 
the greatest trouble in Grade II where 32^ of the pupils 
erred; Grade III showed 14^ erring. Grade IV, with more 
difficult questions, involving a longer attention span, erred 
in 18^ of the oases. But the higher grades showed little 
error in carrying. Subtraction presented a particular prob¬ 
lem in borrowing which decreased from 25^ in Grade II to 6^ 
in Grade VI. The difficulties involved with zeros showed a 
decrease from 33^ in Grade II to 18^ in Grade IV, 6> in 
Grade V and 2^ in Grade VIII, Multiplication of integers 
did not show as proportionate a decrease of errors throughout 
the grades. 74^ in Grade III showed weakness in tables; 
while Grade IV showed a decrease to 36^; Grade V and VI 
showed errors of 32^ and 28^ respectively. The difficulty 
of carrying in multiplication was not apparent above Grade IV. 
Grade III and IV had difficulty when there were zeros 
involved but this type of error did not appear in the tests 
given the higher grades. As was shown in the other opera¬ 
tions, the chief fault in division was lack of correct know¬ 
ledge of fundamental combinations. Errors of this type de¬ 
creased from 80^ in Grade III to 40^ in Grade VI, 50^ of 
Grade IV pupils had difficulties with zeros in division. 

The errors manifested in the fundamental operations also app¬ 
eared in denominate number relationships. But there was a 
decrease in the percentage of errors from 48$^ to 16^ in 
Grade V. Errors in fractions arose from faulty procedures 
rather than from weakness in number combinations. 

There is a tendency to hurry the learning of the number 






185 


0 ombinationa in the lower grades without due regard for the 
more thorough method of providing active experience to assooi 
ate with the new concepts. The general belief predominates 
that drill will correct errors and that they will disappear 
in the higher grades. It is apparent from the above dis¬ 
cussion that the frequency of certain errors of procedure 
does lessen significantly, although many Important concepts 
are still not comprehended in the higher grades. It cannot 
be assumed that continued practice without careful remedial 
teaching will remove errors in number combinations. 

Denominate numbers demand another body of factual know¬ 
ledge. There is not tlie same opportunity for comparison of 
errors, for each grade studies new denominate relationships. 
All the grades showed weakness in the knowledge of the 
denominate tables in the particular course for- the grade. 

But the decreasing percentage of errors demonstrated from 
96^ in Grade III to 45^ in Grade VIII resulted from each 
grade doing more correctly the questions on the previous 
years' work. It would appear that in the relationships in 
one system, practise helped. But students even in the high¬ 
er grades did not show knowledge of relationships between 
English and Metric Systems in length, for example. It 
would appear that inexperience with the metric system is 
the chief factor contributing to the weakness here. It may 
be concluded that denominate relationships can only be 
effectively learned through activity either incidental or 
directed. 

There is a general suggestion that active experiences 
have been lacking in the presentation of arithmetic to the 
pupils who wrote these tests. There were of course errors 
that could not be analyzed from the written work shown. 

These were examples of faulty reading or poor use of frac¬ 
tions. But the outstanding difficulty arises from the lack 
of a meaningful understanding in a practical setting. 
Activity programs in schools must have meaning for the pupils

It is implied that all activity must be thought of ahead of 
time by the teacher so that there is some guarantee of a sat¬ 
isfactory result. Arithmetic idea, it may be stated, have a 
background of mental ideas which are outgrowths of experience. 
But the experience, representative of purposeful activity must 
be so directed as to culminate in the desired idea. 'fhe 
problem, according to this theory, is not clear or concrete 
unless the pupil can form an image. It cannot always be said 
conclusively that the child did not read carefully. The con¬ 
fusion of perimeter and area in Grades IV and V suggests lack 
of experience with concrete materials in measuring and compar¬ 
ing. It was obvious that many students did not understand 
the numerical value of decimals. The various types of errors 
described in Chapter VI indicate the lack of use of decimals 
in meaningful experience. It is important that pupils should 
learn that decimals are an extension of the notation system to 
the right of the decimal point. It is not intended to give 
an extensive symbolism beyond the demands of practical use; 
but it is significant that knowledge implies more than a 
grasp of symbolism separate from everyday usage. 

Faulty procedure in problem solving indicates lack of 
visualization of the experience involved. Of course it is 
not maintained that every form of experience can be organized 
for the classroom; but it is maintained that sufficient 
meaningful experiences involving the use of numbers in 
various relationships can be so organized as to give a pupil 
a clear conception of their significance. A student in 
Physics is expected to do problems to demonstrate his grasp 
of a scientific principle. The child in arithmetic must 
find the significance of his number symbolism in practical, 
meaningful activity carefully organized by a resourceful 
teacher who has a clear idea of the purpose intended. There 
is evidence that fundamentals are drilled by mechanical pro¬ 
cesses. Pupils cannot decide what procedure to use if 
their drill has been separate from any foim of visualization

of the problem involved. As was said at the end of Chapter 
V, more emphasis must be attached to the recognition of pro¬ 
cedures and exactness of form. 

There is a tendency to believe that formal statements 
in arithmetic should be avoided. But it is a point common¬ 
ly propounded that putting down in a formal statement what is 
given and what is required is one method of developing in a 
child a sense of analysis that appears to have been lacking 
in the problem sections of these tests. Meaningful 
activity is important to understanding but facility in ex¬ 
pressing that understanding in precise language arises from 
practise of it; and precision of expeession implies precisicn 
of thinking which is fundamental in problem solving. Formal 
statements in Grade III should, according to the Course of 
Study be avoided but in later grades it would appear advan¬ 
tageous, particularly where the language of arithmetic is to 
be emphasized. It is the intention of the Course to empha¬ 
size the definite conciseness of the language as a vehicle 
for clear-cut expression of organized thought processes. 

There is evidence of unfamiliarity with the language. Pupils 
did not know when to subtract but no doubt would have done so 
if the instructions had read "Take away'.’ Many refer to a 
product or a quotient as an answer and showed their unfamil¬ 
iarity with the words both in use and in spelling. 

The general conclusion of all this is that teachers 
should be familiar with the psychology of arithmetic, the 
classes of errors that occur, and the difficulties involved 
from the pupils ^ stftndpoint. There is evidence of the need 
of more definite Normal School training in this matter. It 
would appear that outlines of the common problems and norms 
of accomplishment in various operations might serve a very 
useful puipose if printed in the course of study for each 
grade. Along with them might be included forms of charts 
or record sheets which the teacher might use as a guide in 




188 


keeping individual records of the problems of the pupils. It 
is obvious that no effective work can be done in improving 
arithmetic, without regard for the values of efficient diagno¬ 
sis and recording of difficulties for remedial instruction. 

Survey Tests can be more effectively utilized in such a 
program when the significance of their potentiality is fully 
appreciated by all those concerned with instruction in 


arithmetic
