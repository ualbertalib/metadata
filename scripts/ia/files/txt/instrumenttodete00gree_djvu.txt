Introduction 


A radioactive substance of long half Ufa omits particles 
at a nearly constant average rate, but the mi bar of disintegrations 
in any time interval will vary because of their random distribution* 

It has been shown (3,9) that the number will be distributed about 
the mean value in accordance with the Poisoon distribution, and that 
the standard deviation in the number will be given by the square 
root of the mean# 

If now, counts are mad© of the number of disintegrations in 
a given time interval, it may be found that the observations do not 
follow a Poisson distribution because of counting defects* This may 
be checked b t comparing the standard deviation of the counts obtained 
with the square root of the mean count# One my aim use the Chi 
square test to determine the probability that the counts obtained 
are from a random so? roe# Harked effect© on the counting ret and 
on the observed standard deviation will be produced by such counting 
defects as: 

(a) Significantly long dead time (3,5,4) 

lb) Two or more pulses being recorded foi’ each one entering, the 

counter* 

(o) Pick up of 60 cycle line frequency* 

(d) Intermittent counting due to varying voltage on the counter* 

To make a reliable measurement of the standard deviation or to 
apply a Chi square test requires a largo number of reading# and 
lengthy calculations* The instrument described in this thssio eliriin-

■•Valuation of the Counting date. 

A*, dealer : 

The most widely used method of determining counting rate 
is to make an actual count of the number of pulses received in a 
Measured time interval. An electronic scaler ia used to count the 
pulses. Many types of scalers have been developed (14,1 >16,17,18,19; 

v 

■Some of the advantages and disadvantages of using a scaler may 

be listed as follows! 

Advantages: 1. An actual count is made of each Individual pulse 
so there is no limitation imposed on the accuracy of the result ob¬ 
tained by the accuracy of the electronic eomponeata involved. 

2. A series of readings over a constant time Inter¬ 
val may be used to obtain the standard deviation and than the re¬ 
liability of the results. 

Pisa lvarta- '--’3! 1. 3specift.il;, at hi# counting rates the accuracy 

of the results is limited by the precision with which the tim 
interval may be -ensured. An error in timing should be obtained and 
considered when estimating tha reliability of the results. 

2. To obtain an estimate of the reliability of the 
results, the very long nrocedure outlined in a later section niot 
b© followed.

definitions are:

T - the constant interval over which the pulses are counted#

T - the dead tin-■ of the counter*

Th© overage number recorded in the interval is given by

The mean counting rate is then ® * 


The variance in m is obtained by taking 




The standard deviation is then the square root of the variance

If n la large so the expected poisson distribution approaches 

the normal distribution, the standard error in cr is given by

The fractional standard error is then 1/ V§n 
Table 1 shows the standard error as a percentage of the stand¬

Compa rison of the Mean Deviation ath the st a ndard Deviatio n. 

In the construction of the meter it was found that the average 
deviation from the me&r could be more easily obtained than the 
standard deviation* However, the standard deviation is the quantity 
usually used in statistical analysis* 

It will be shown 'that for the roissmi and normal distributions 
there exist simple relations between the standard and the mean de¬ 
viations. Because of this it has been possible to calibrate the 
instrument in terms of standard deviation although it is mean de¬ 
viation which is measured. 

It should be noted that the calibration takes account of 
Foisson and. normal distributions only. For other distributions 
the indicated standard deviations my not be correct.

density is pixj, the variance ia given by the second moment abo^t

Man;- types of counting rate meters have been designed (84*35*26, 
37,88,29]* In general, they consist of an integrating circuit 
with an exponentially decaying memory* For each count received, 
a quantity of charge, q, is fed on to a condenser of an 30 tank 
circuit. The charge on the condenser slowly leaks through the re- 
niatanoe* The voltage on the condenser at which equilibrium is at¬

Calib rati on of the Counting »fato Setor : 


The counting rat© meter was calibrated by feeding in regular 
pulses of a known frequency* These were obtained by tapping off a 
sweep fret uency from the horizontal plates of an oscilloscope, 
synchronized to various multiples and fractions of 00 cycle line 
frequency. The lowest frequency available in this mnmr was 10 
cycles per second or 900 counts pea? minute. This would calibrate 
down to the 1000 c/ia scale* For frequencies below this, the output 
of the coaler on 00 ay cl* > test was used* 4130 c/m wore obtained by 
using 'the output from the scale of 8 with 60 cycle input* 06 «2h 
c/m were obtained fron the output £&m the scale of 64.

Q*0©4 


The voltages at the cathodes or the tubes ?~6 and ¥-9 alco 
give an indication of M and x* If a voltmeter was put between 
these points the current required to run it would come through 
M-l and therefore disturb the counting rate reading* 

This was prevented by using a vacuum tuba voltmeter drawing 
no current. The two voltages were put on to the grids of the double 
tried© V~7. These voltages were jurying fro,; 105 to about 05 volts. 
The cathode bias resistors were chosen to make the grids about 1 
volt negative with no current in (-44. The voltages at the cath¬ 
odes would then indicate B and x« 

The differ cues in cathode voltage was indicated by ss«*2. A 
full wave copper oxide .rectifier mde it indicate the absolute 
differ an a?. The condenser 0*$3 across the voltmeter was chosen 
to give t tire constant of approx hiatal, 30 a*comas* The voltage

C alibration of the s tandard devia tion i-calo : 

An absolute calibration may be made only by comparing the 
reading of M-2 with the standard deviation as obtained by direct 

calculation* 

To do this the pulses from the pulse output terminals wore fed 
into the scalar* A series of n scaler readings were taken while 
the potentiometer was recording the deflection, indicated by '"-2* 

The itandard deviation was calculated fror the readings by using 
the procedure outlined previously. 

A graph was th n plotted to correlate the avew.e meter de¬ 
flect ion with the actual a ten. hard deviation. This graph* Fig.14, 
also shows the standard error of the calculated <r . '

To test for linearity of the scale It was necessary to cali¬

laborious so a compromise of approximately 100 readings per point

wore take , which gave a standard error of approximate 1- 7 • At

Dr ift: 

wv^-r the time required for several readings there occasionally 
appeared some drift in the recorded reading* it me necessary hen 
this was noticed on the trace to check on 6# cycles* 'lha difficulty 
was usually in the pulse splitting elements# Adjustment of k-31 to 
give a minimum in ss-2 gave the correct counting rate again and the 
original standard, deviation rending# 

For this reason it is suggested that any further instilments 
of this type be made with two pulse shaping circuits. 

Aperiaent al procedure for Calibration : 

An externally quench d HCjl, Model 20 uoiger tube was used to 
detect the radiation from a radium sample* The pulses were put 
directly into the counting rate meter* The Output of the meter 
was put into the Scaler and the recording potentiometer* The count¬ 
ing rate, from J-l was recorded for a. .proxiraat- Xy 10 minutes* and 
then the standard deviation from J-2 for approximately 10 minutes#

scaler and register and reset for the next reading* The coaler was 
an Atomic instrument Co. odel 1Q1A, scale of 64. The output of 
this scale was put into a Cyclotron Specialties Go. Mechanical 
register. 

The relay was later put into the counting rate meter output 
as illustrated in figure 13. This led to no spurious pulses intro¬ 
duced into the scaler. In this case also, the contacts on the clock 
remained closed for the 15 seconds during which counting was carried 
out. Hawing the relay ©o close to the pulse splitting network meant 
that the size of the pulses were affected by closing and opening 
the relay. It was then necessary to do the counting while the ” 0 -

Figure 14 illustrates that there is a correlation between the 
computed tt ndard deviation of the counting rate of a sample, and 
the deflection of the meter M2, Fig, 16, shows thr t the meter deflect¬ 
ion is not significnntly dependant on the counting rate, at least if 
the meter deflection is not small. In Fig, 16 the standard deviations 
of two samples showing different counting rates, but with theoretically 
the same standard deviation, do show the same average deflection on the 
standard deviation meter to within about 2$ after equilibrium is reached 
To obtain a similar comparison to the same accuracy by computing the 
standard deviation from a series of samples would require one thousand 
readings (Fig. l) of each sample. 

The accuracy of the standard deviation meter is limited by the 
zero reading as illustrated in Fig, 10, which is expected to be a funct¬ 
ion of the counting rate. This zero correction is apurecialbe only 

a 

for small meter deflections for which it would then be significant 
fraction of the indicated reading. If the distribution dealt with 
is approximately Poissonion . There is usually no need to work with 
small scale deflections because a lower range of the meter may be 
chosen. 

The difficulty in making an accurate calibration of the standard 
deviation scale also sets a limit on its acrur cy. As illustrated in 
Fig. 16, the meter may be used to give comparative standard deviations, 
and hence detect seme of the counter defects outlined at the beginning 
of the thesis.

or by measuring -a# the tandrrd deviation of a sample which may 
reasonably he expected to follow the Poisson distribution within the 
accuracy of the instrument are suggested f-b being expected to give a 
more reliable calibration. Such a sample could be obtained from a 
scintillation counter, counting at a rate low enough so that the 
effect due to dead time of the counter tube and circuits would not be 
significant. The standard deviation would then be very close to the 
•quare root of the mean.

The principle of the meter is thnt it reeds the two quantities, 
average counting rate over a long porio , aru* th counting rate over 
a short period* Thi3 is accomplished b. using two in terra tir cir- 
-iffere:. constants or f MM l * till t, The L 

time constant circuit gives an indication of the average rate, , 
and tno abort time constant circuit giva© an indication of the actual 
rate x over a abort period.

The standard deviation of the counting pate, dj, as 
indicated by the standard deviation meter is to be the standard 
deviation which would be obtained if the readings wore taken 
for unit time, in this case for one minute* This can be done 
because with the decaying memory of the Instrument Any rbitmry 
. time Interval may be chosen as a unit for calibration* 


In calibrating the instrument, if readings are taken 

2 

for a time interval T, the relative variance, 0^ / m , would 


be expeoted to be the same as would be obtained If the reeding! 
were taken for unit time* 



H 


and since M » — , this reduce* to 



The standard deviation of an estimate of the counting 
rate obtained by counting for an Interval T, it given by OJ,/ T. 


This may be obtained by taking 0# // ¥ • It will be noted 


that this is the same as If T readings were taken for the 
unit interval* The standard deviation is reduced by the square 
roCt of tho number of readings, in tfci» case T*

counting, however, it gives the standard deviation of the rate 


as though a unit time interral was being used. Then the indicated 
6 ^ should on the average be equal to the square root of the 
indicated rate if the pulses counted are following the Poisson 
distribution. 

An analysis of the expected standard deviation of the 
indicated <r: has not yet been carried out.
