A DETERMINATION OF THE GENERALIZATIONS IN 
THE FIRST-YEAR SCIENCE COURSES OF 
ALBERTA HIGH SCHOOLS 


Norman Edwin Lougheed 


INTRODUCTION 

One of the commonest criticisms which the science 
teacher hears against present science courses in most Canadian 
high schools is that these courses are too detailed and too 
unrelated to each other to provide the student with the basic 
generalizations which best enable him to understand his 
environment and appreciate the relationship of science to 
everyday life. This type of criticism has been directed 
chiefly against first-year science courses. It has resulted 
in a definite trend toward teaching these courses not as 
specialized subjects but as a single course in "General 
Science”, in which increased emphasis is placed upon the 
generalizations and the inherent unity of all the sciences. 

Some provinces in Canada have already abandoned the system of 
teaching first-year science as specialized courses, and have 
introduced instead one course of General Science for each year 
of the high school. These General Science courses are designed 
to acquaint the first-year student with those fundamental

aspects of science which illuminate everyday life, yet which 
at the same time form a broad enough basis for further and 
more intensive study in any of the specialized fields of 
science. 

Educators are generally well agreed that this is one 
of the chief objectives^ of science education; and almost 
every course of study in first-year science for high schools 
makes it clear that the instructional material must emphasize 
the basic principles of science and also provide an abundant 
opportunity for the student to learn to formulate clearly the 
generalizations which will clarify and unify the field of 
science for him.

CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 


It is the purpose of the following investigation to 
determine the generalizations contained in the authorized 
text books for four of the first-year science courses of the 
Alberta High Schools. It is hoped that in this way science 
teachers may have a more objective means by which to determine: 

(a) The extent to which present first-year science 
courses in Alberta provide the student with basic science 
generalizations or principles, and 

(b) The approximate "learning load” which a reasonable 
mastery of these courses presents to each pupil. 

DEFINITION OF TERMS 


By "generalization" we shall mean a broad concept 
of a fundamental truth perceived as a basic operative factor 
in a wide variety of phenomena. 

It must be realized that the term "generalization" 
as used in this investigation "stands both for a process and 
the result of that process"^. It is true that the student

must understand the basic principles of natural science in 
their wider relationships, but he should arrive at such under¬ 
standing through discovery and the exercise of reason upon the 
great variety of phenomena which he perceives about him. It 
is imperative that the student become the active factor in the 
process of generalization. 

By "learning load" we shall mean the average amount 
of factual and explanatory material which a student must learn 
during one standard-length period of instruction, in order to 
obtain a reasonable mastery of the generalizations comprising 
the core material around which each of the investigated 
courses has been built. 

The explanatory material will be expressed in terms 
of words of material to be studied. 

The factual material will be expressed as the 
average number of new words, diagrams, experiments and acti¬ 
vities, scientific laws, definitions, questions and exercises, 
etc., which the student must learn during the period of time 
calculated as available to learn one generalization. 

THE PROBLEM 

The investigation here reported represents an 
attempt to discover the nature and number of the generaliza¬ 
tions contained in the authorized science books used in Alberta 
High Schools as text books for the courses in Biology I,

"Programme of Studies for the High Schools" for the year end¬ 
ing July 15, 1945. 

Limitations of the Problem 


This investigation will be confined wholly to the 

problem as stated. No attempt is to be made to determine what 

generalizations should or should not be included as curricular 

material; and no evaluation is made as to the suitability of 

the sequence in which these generalizations have been presented, 

since even those investigators 1 2 who have made exhaustive studies 

of a large number of science curricula for High Schools have 

o 

failed to show any general agreement on these two problems. 
However, a few general comments have been added regarding the 
content of each course investigated, and certain suggestions 
made regarding possible improvements. These comments and 
suggestions are based entirely upon the experience and opinions 
of the writer, and should not in any sense be understood as 
deductions from experimental evidence.

CHAPTER II 


METHODS AND MATERIALS 

Method 


The prescribed sections of each of the authorized 
text books used in the four science courses investigated were 
very carefully read and each generalization found was recorded 
on a separate card. These generalizations were, in most 
cases, taken verbatim from their sources. In cases, however, 
where the generalization was merely implied or was incompletely 
stated, the investigator completed it according to the infer¬ 
ence of the contextual material, and recorded it in the same 
way as the others. All scientific words and terms likely to 
be new to the student and therefore to be a source of language 
difficulty were carefully listed in alphabetic order and 
placed after the main generalization to which they referred. 
They will be found listed under the heading "Vocabulary Expan¬ 
sion Required for Generalization". 

Definitions and laws which the student must usually 
memorize were likewise recorded and placed after the appro¬ 
priate main generalization. The generalizations were then 
grouped according to the topics to which they most closely 
referred. Generalizations and "vocabulary expansions" which

occurred more than once in the same course were recorded only 
once on the cards for that course; but where the same generali¬ 
zation, word, or term appeared in more than one course, it was 
recorded in the appropriate place in each course in which it 
appeared. 

In this way all generalizations found in the Chemistry 
I course appear under the subject heading "Chemistry I"; all 
those found in Physics I appear under the subject heading 
"Physics I". The same was done with Biology I and Geology I. 

Before being able to determine the learning load for 
the student, it was necessary to determine not only the number 
of generalizations and the extent of the language difficulty, 
but also the number of diagrams, experiments and activities, 
scientific laws, definitions, questions and exercises, etc., 
which the student is normally required to learn. Then, knowing 
the amount of printed material contained in the authorized 
texts and the amount of time normally allotted to each course, 
the average learning load per generalization was calculated. 

The result gives a concrete expression of the minimum learning 
load which each of these science courses presents to the stu¬ 
dent. 

This investigation has attempted to make clear the 
number and nature of the generalizations contained in Alberta’s 
first-year science courses, together with the learning load 
which a reasonable mastery of these generalizations imposes 
upon the student. It is hoped that this study will enable

CHAPTER III 


The primary purpose of this thesis is to present in 
objective form the various generalizations found in the Biology 
I, Chemistry I, Geology I, and Physics I courses. Therefore, 
the data which follow consist entirely of these generaliza- 
tions organized into major and minor categories under their 
proper subject headings, together with the words, terms, 
definitions, and laws, etc., which are related to each major 
heading and which are likely to present language difficulty 
to the student. 

DATA FOR BIOLOGY I 

Generalizations 


I. For every living thing life becomes a constant search and 
struggle for food. 

1. Methods of food getting are dependent upon the struc¬ 
ture of the organism. 

(a) Animals possess a wide variety of body parts which 
aid in obtaining food. 

(b) The ways in which an organism gets its food depend . 
upon characteristics inherited from the parents. 

2. As we proceed up the scale of animal life—that is, 
from the simple to the more complex forms—we find an 
ever increasing variety and specialization of those

body parts which are used to obtain food, 

(a) Man, like other animals, has been dependent upon 
the structure of his body in developing his 
methods of procuring food, 

(i) Through the use of his brain, which is capable 
of much higher development than is the brain 
of other animals, man has become the master of 
the rest of the living world, 

3* The methods used by plants to obtain food depend upon 
the structure of the plant. 

(a) Food materials from the soil or water pass into 
the plant cells by the processes of osmosis and 
imbibition. 

(i) There are certain specialized systems of cells 
in the plant structure used for transporting 
food materials. 

4. Plants which contain chlorophyll are able to utilize 
the energy of the sun to produce food materials from 
the simpler substances obtained from the air, soil, 
and water, 

(a) Energy from the sunlight is stored in the plant 
body in the form of food material. 

(i) Only plants which contain chlorophyll can 
manufacture foods, 

(ii) By the process of oxidation, energy stored 
in the food materials is released and made

available to the plant cells for growth, 
repair, and reproductive processes, 

5. Animals are dependent upon plants for a food supply, 
since only plants are capable of converting the raw 
materials from the air, soil, and water into food 
materials capable of sustaining animal life. 

(a) Certain plants which lack chlorophyll depend upon 
other plants or animals to provide food. 

6. Wastes from the utilization of foods in the bodies of 
living things must be removed to maintain the effi¬ 
ciency of the life processes. 

7. The protoplasm in living things is the substance which 
carries on all the activities of life in an organism, 
and the protoplasm like other materials wears out and 
must be replaced. 

8. The growth and well-being of an organism is affected 
by the kind as well as the quantity of food which it 
obtains. 

9. All plants and animals have a cellular structure, but 
the cells may vary greatly in structure, composition, 
and function, 

(a) The work of the body is really done by the cells 
which compose it. 

10. The physical and chemical properties of foods must be 
changed by digestive juices before these foods can be 
used by the living cells.

(a) Animals and plants are equipped with special hody 
parts to aid in the digestion of foods. 

(i) Plants and animals produce enzymes which aid 
in digesting foods. 

11. The kind of food used by an organism is closely 
related to the structure of the organism. 

(a) Plant-eating organisms have relatively complex 
digestive systems and long intestinal tracts. 

12. Living things must have some type of transportation 
system in order that food can reach the cells in 
every part of the body. 

(a) Digested foods pass by diffusion into the cells 
of the organism. 

(b) In the transportation and distribution of food, 
higher animals differ from higher plants in that 
animals have organs which drive the food through 
the body channels. 

13. All living things must obtain oxygen to release the 
energy contained in the cell materials. 

(a) The quantity of oxygen required by an organism 
depends upon the size and the activities of the 
organism. 

(b) In respiration oxygen is absorbed through the cell 
wall by the cell protoplasm; and wastes pass out 
from the cell protoplasm through the cell wall.

II. Every organism begins life as a single cell. 

1. The process of cell growth and reproduction is con¬ 
trolled by a great many factors both internal and 
external to the organism. 

(a) The processes of growth and assimilation change 
the non-living materials taken in by the organism 
into living material. 

(i) Protoplasm is the only substance which pos¬ 
sesses the power of growth and assimilation. 

(b) The process of growth consists of any one or 
more of the following processes: 

(i) Assimilation of non-living substances and 
the production of new protoplasm from them. 

(ii) Increase in the size of the cell or cells. 

(iii) Increase in the number of cells. 

(iv) The development in higher organisms of dif¬ 
ferent kinds of cells for special purposes. 

(c) There are five main stages in the growth of 
seeds into plants. These stages are: 

(i) The absorption of water. 

(ii) The beginning of respiration. 

(iii) The digestion of food materials. 

(iv) The transfer of digested food to the grow¬ 
ing parts of the plant embryo. 

(v) Assimilation of soluble food material by the 
growing cells into new protoplasm and cells.

2. The life processes of both plants and animals are 
based upon the opposing forces of anabolism and 
katabolism. 

(a) As long as anabolism ezceeds katabolism, growth 
continues. 

3. Flowering plants may be classified into groups on the 
basis of the number of cotyledons which they produce, 
(a) The internal structure of the stems of monocoty¬ 
ledons and dicotyledons differs characteristically. 

4. The adult stage of an organism results from growth 
and division of the single cell from which it origi¬ 
nated. 

(a) Many animals undergo metamorphosis as they 
develop from the egg to the adult. 

5. Normal growth is regulated by the proper functioning 
of all parts of an organism in the presence of certain 
essential materials and conditions. 

(a) The secretion of the endocrine glands has a 
regulating effect upon normal body growth. 

(b) Drugs interfere with or modify the normal func¬ 
tioning of various parts of the organism. 

6. The body of an organism is a very delicately adjusted 
mechanism, the efficient functioning of which depends 
upon the proper coordination of all its parts.

III. Life must come from life. 

1. All methods of reproduction have as their purpose 
the generation of a new individual which will replace 
the old and dying, in order that the race may sur¬ 
vive. 

(a) Parental care of the young tends to decrease the 
death rate. 

2. Reproduction is essentially a kind of growth in 
which one part of the parent organism is detached

and grows into a new individual, 

(a) The difference between sexual and asexual repro¬ 
duction is essentially a difference in the way 
in which the detached portion of protoplasm, 
which grows into a new individual, is produced, 

(i) All sexual methods of reproduction are simi¬ 
lar in that they bring about a union of two 
cells or a part of two cells to form a 
single cell capable of producing a new indi¬ 
vidual which will inherit characteristics 
from both parents. 

(ii) The extensive production of spores makes 
it difficult for man to get rid of certain 
types of injurious fungi, 

3. As we pass upward in the scale of life, from the 
lower to the higher forms of animals, the power to 
replace lost parts is lessened. 

4. All methods of reproduction are essentially alike 
in that they ultimately depend upon cell division. 

5. In the simpler types of water plants distribution 
of the organism is brought about by the swimming 
sperm; but in land plants the sperms must be dis¬ 
seminated by other means. 

(a) The essential organs of reproduction in the 

higher forms of plants are the stamens and pis¬ 
tils.

(b) Certain changes in the mode of reproduction 
have made the seed plant the dominant plant of 
our present environment. 

6. Offspring have characteristics not exactly like the 
characteristics of either of the parents, and it is 
through these changes that variations in the struc¬ 
ture and function of living things become possible. 

(a) The various devices for growth and reproduction 
which organisms have evolved have been the re¬ 
sult of natural selection since inheritable 
variations which prove to be of advantage to an 
organism tend to survive. 

(b) As we pass from the lower to the higher scale 
of animal life, an increased specialization of 
cells for reproduction is found. 

7. The period of infancy and dependency is longer among 
the higher animals than among the lower animals. 

(a) Parental care among the animals other than man 
is the result of instinct not reason. 

(i) Most insects provide for their young merely 
by depositing the eggs in a favorable place 
on or near a suitable food supply.

IV. Each habitat has its own set of living conditions 

1. Fitness to the environment determines largely the 
type of organism which can survive in that environ¬ 
ment. 

2. The habitat of an animal may be inferred from the 
general appearance of the animal. 

(a) The fitness of a living thing to live in a cer¬ 


tain kind of environment is passed on from 
generation to generation. 

(i) Some living things may change in structure 
and/or function when they are placed in a 
different type of habitat. 


(1) Fitness of most organisms to a water 
habitat requires that the organism have

a body which can be prevented from sink¬ 
ing to the bottom since protoplasm is 
generally denser than water* 

(ii) Water plants have a great variety of special 
characteristics which fit them to a water 
habitat. 

(b) Since soil and air have different properties from 
water, a different set of conditions prevails in 
a land habitat, and these conditions have a char¬ 
acteristic effect upon the structure and function 
of the living things in it* 

(i) Besides numerous devices used to prevent 
excessive evaporation from their tissues, 
land plants have root structures which assist 
the plant in obtaining water and food 
materials from the soil* 

(ii) The transportation system of land plants is 
much more highly developed than that of water 
plants. 

(iii) Land habitats differ according to the 
amount of water available in them for living 
plant and animal organisms* 

(1) Plant structures are modified in many 
ways to adapt the plant to the available 
water in the land habitat,

that the organism possess the ability 
to obtain oxygen and often the 
ability to keep from sinking to the 
bottom while in the water habitat. 

3. Every animal is a bundle of adaptations to its par¬ 
ticular environment. 

(a) Land animals must have structures which enable 
them to obtain oxygen from the air, to effect 
reasonably easy locomotion, and to bring about 
safely the reproduction of young. 

(b) In general all organisms are fitted to their 
environments, but often these organisms possess 
structures which are non-adaptive and appear to 
serve no useful purpose. 

(c) Should structures develop in an animal which are 
harmful to it, that species of animal will not 
likely survive. 

4. Every wild animal has its natural enemies. 

(a) Many animals and plants have colors and color 
patterns which fuse with their usual environment 
and make them almost indistinguishable from their 
immediate surroundings. 

(b) Animals with conspicuous coloration are generally 
provided with special means of defence and are 
usually avoided by potential enemies. 

(c) Some animals lacking special organs of defence 
avoid enemies by the means of mimicry.

5. In the struggle for existence, those species which 
are best fitted to their environment tend to survive. 

6. Paleontologists, using fossil records, have been able 
to build up a fairly complete picture of the history 
of the life on the earth since very early times. 

(a) Fossil records indicate that with the passage of 
time there was an increasing complexity and 
specialization of structure among certain groups 
of organisms; but these records show also that 
organisms abundant in one geological time often 
become extinct in some succeeding age. 

(b) When changes take place in any environment the 
organisms there must either adapt themselves to 
the new conditions, seek a more favorable 
environment, or perish. 

(i) Species which become too specialized to per¬ 
mit change in their structure or function 
usually perish because of their poor adapta¬ 
bility. 

7. The relationship existing between living things in a 
given environment determines the kind and number of 
them which can exist there. 

8. As a result of a tremendous over-production of living 
things, there is a competition among living things 
for the necessities of life. 

9. The interdependency of living things is so complex

that any change in the number of a given kind of 
living thing brings about a change throughout the 
whole living world until a new balance is obtained. 

10. Both geographic and topographic factors influence 
the distribution of plants and animals. 

(a) Where barriers did not exist, species developing 
in one region gradually spread to other favor¬ 
able regions where they came into competition 
with other species and those most fitted for the 
struggle survived.

V. Man has classified living things by grouping together 
those which are similar in shape, habitat, use, habits, 
or other characteristics because he has found that such 
systems of classification are of great value to him in 
learning to understand and control living things. 

1. Modern classification of plants and animals is based 
chiefly upon similarities and differences of structure, 
(a) The closeness of relationship of organisms is

determined by the degree to which they resemble 
each other. 

(b) Much evidence shows that the present forms of 

life have come about through modification of ear¬ 
lier ancestral forms. 

2. The theory of evolution explains satisfactorily the 
fossil records, the resemblance in structure of many 
species, the facts of embryology, geographic distri¬ 
bution, and similar factual evidence.

VI # By discovering the laws of nature which govern the life 
processes of organisms, man may use this knowledge to 
select and improve living things useful to him, or to 
eliminate injurious species. 

1. The main problem of the farmer is to conserve or 
improve the temperature, fertility, moisture content, 
and other necessary soil conditions• 

(a) Certain kinds and amounts of foods are needed for 
each particular type of living thing. 

2. Conservation of our forests, minerals, and wild life 
is essential from both the economic and recreational 
points of view. 

3. By means of refrigeration, canning, preserving, or 
careful storage, the wastage of plant and animal 
products may now be reduced to a minimum. 

4. Control of weeds and insect pests depends almost 
entirely upon a knowledge of their habits and devel¬ 
opment. 

(a) Community cooperation is essential for effective 
control of plant and animal pests.

VII. Natural law operates to preserve the characteristics of 
living things yet, at the same time, provides for the 
possibility of change. 

1. By experimentation man has been able to discover some 
of the laws of heredity and has been successful in 
applying them to improve plants and animals for his 
own use. 

(a) Observations of the many characteristics of 
living things reveal that no two individual 
living things are exactly alike. 

(b) Since both parents contribute to the total num¬ 
ber of characteristics of the offspring, there 
is thus secured the possibility of variation. 

2. The chromosomes, thought to be the bearers of here¬ 
ditary characters, vary in number among the differ¬ 
ent species of animals and plants. 

(a) Certain changes in the chromosomes may give 
rise to mutations, and this probably accounts 
in part for the many species of plants and 
animals. 

3. By regulating the materials and conditions of the 
environment, man may modify the living things of any 
generation, but these modifications are not inherited 
by the next generation.

4. Artificial selection and cross-breeding are the fun¬ 
damental principles used in the modern production 
of new and improved varieties of useful animals, 
grains, vegetables, flowers, etc*, but cuttings are 
used in the case of most trees and fruits. 

(a) Hybridization often produces offspring having 
increased vigor, but this increase lasts only 
for the one generation.

CHAPTER IV 


DATA FOR CHEMISTRY I 


Generalizations 


Matter is subject to two main types of change—physical 
change and chemical change. 

1. There are three physical states of matter known as 
solid, liquid, and gas. 

(a) A change in the physical state of a substance 

does not involve any change in the composition of 
the substance. 

(i) The properties of the components of a mixture 
remain unchanged. 

2. Any chemical change in matter brings about a change 
in the composition and properties of the matter, 
producing a different substance or substances.. 

(a) Chemical reactions may be brought about by any 
energy change which results in combination, decom¬ 
position, displacement, exchange, or molecular 
rearrangement of reacting substances. 

(b) Each pure substance resulting from a chemical 
change manifests a specific set of characteristic 
properties which is always the same for the same 
pure substance under the same conditions. 

(i) Substances are identified by means of their

distinctive physical or chemical properties. 

(ii) Elements are substances which have not been 
decomposed into simpler substances. 

(iii) Compounds are substances that can be decom¬ 
posed into two or more simpler substances. 

(iv) A given compound, whatever its origin, always 
contains the same elements in the same propor¬ 
tion by weight. 

(v) The ingredients of a solution are homogeneously 
distributed through each other. 


3. In physical and chemical changes matter is neither 
created nor destroyed. 

(a) The total weight of substances formed in a chemi¬ 


cal reaction is exactly equal to the weight of all 
the substances which entered into the change.

1, Law of Conservation of Matter. 

2. Law of Definite Composition. 

II. When substances burn in air or in oxygen, oxides are 
formed. 

1. The products of combustion are always heavier than 
the weight of the substances burned. 

2. Raising the temperature in most chemical processes 
hastens the reaction. 

(a) Molecular motion ceases at absolute zero. 

(b) By means of a catalyst many chemical processes 
may be hastened. 

(c) Substances which burn in air burn faster and 
with greater brilliance in oxygen. 

3. The kindling point of a substance may be lowered by 
increasing the surface exposed to chemical action, 
by increasing the pressure, or by using a catalyst, 

4. All methods of extinguishing fires depend either 
upon cooling the combustible material, or upon keep¬ 
ing out the air so that oxygen is no longer available 
for the process of oxidation. 

5. Allotropic forms of the same element may be formed 
either by absorption or by the release of energy.

III* Hydrogen compounds are among the most important, 

numerous, and widely distributed substances in nature* 

1. Hydrogen may be prepared from many compounds either 
by the process of replacement or by decomposition. 

(a) Only those metals above hydrogen in the replace¬ 
ment series will replace hydrogen from dilute 
hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. 

(b) Reduction and oxidation occur simultaneously 
and are quantitatively equal* 

2. Water is the most important of all the hydrogen com¬ 
pounds since it is such a universal catalyst that 
without it life of any sort would be impossible. 

3. The kinetic-molecular theory assumes that a gas is 
a vacant space with exceedingly minute particles 
scattered throughout, and that these particles under 
ordinary conditions are flying about in all direc¬ 
tions with great speed. 

(a) All gases have the power of diffusion.

IV. Water is so universally distributed that it has been 
used in determining many scientific standards such as 
the temperature scales, units of: weight, density, 
heat, and volume. 

1. Since no other substance has precisely the same 
boiling point or freezing point as water, these two 
temperatures are used in identifying water. 

2. Solution = solvent + solute. 

(a) Any substance that will dissolve in water will 
cause the resulting solution to boil at a higher 
temperature and to freeze at a lower tempera¬ 
ture than that at which pure water boils or 
freezes. 

(b) The boiling point of any solution becomes lower 
as the pressure is decreased and higher as the 
pressure is increased. 

(c) The solubility of solutes is affected by heat,

VII. The exchange of the negative and positive ions of acids 

and bases results in the formation of water and a salt. 

1. All acids contain hydrogen. 

E. Acids have a sharp, sour taste, and turn the dye 
litmus from blue to red. 

3. Aqueous solutions of bases have a bitter taste, a 
soapy feeling; and change red litmus to blue. 

4. All bases contain the hydroxyl radical. 

5. When a solution of an acid and of a base are brought 
together in the right proportions, the characteristic 
properties of each disappear. 

(b) The volumes of basic or acidic solutions required 
for neutralization vary inversely as the concen¬ 
tration of the reacting solutions: 

(Y ± x N x - V 2 x Ng) 

(i) Any "normal" solution of an acid contains 
one gram of replaceable hydrogen per litre 
of solution. 

(ii) Any "normal" solution of a basic solution 
contains 17 grams of the hydroxyl group per 
litre of the solution. 

6. The lowering of thefreezing point and the raising 
of the boiling point depend directly upon the num¬ 
ber of molecules of solute present in a given 
weight of solvent.

in a solvent such, as water, or heated to a molten 
state, undergo dissociation into a number of 
oppositely electrically charged particles (ions) 
capable of conducting an electric current. 

(a) The activity of an acid or base is due to the 
degree of ionization of the compound when in 
solution or in a molten state. 

(i) The nature and relative amount of the sol¬ 
vent, the presence of other ions, tempera¬ 
ture, and light may affect the degree of 
ionization. 

(ii) Positive and negative ions unite to form 
neutral molecules. 

8. Electrolysis involves the discharge of the positive 
and negative ions at their respective electrodes, 
with resulting chemical changes. 

(a) When acids are dissolved in water they form 
hydrogen ions, while bases form hydroxyl ions. 

(i) The characteristics of acids are really 
peculiarities of the hydrogen ion. 

(ii) Strong acids or bases are almost completely 
dissociated in dilute solutions; weak acids 
or bases are only slightly dissociated in 
solution. 

(b) In general, all chemical reactions of acids, 
bases, and salts in dilute solutions are reac¬ 
tions between ions.

neutrons, and electrons, around which more 
electrons revolve at high speed in definite 
orbits. 

2. Ordinary chemical reactions involve either a trans¬ 
fer or a sharing of the outer electrons of atoms, 
(a) The valence of any element is determined by the 

number of electrons which its atom must gain or 
lose in order to complete its outer shell. 

(i) In metals the electrons in the outer shell 
are held very loosely and may be readily 
removed from the atom. In non-metals these 
outer shell electrons are held very firmly 
and the atom has even a strong tendency to 
gain electrons to complete the outer shell. 

(ii) The ions of a compound are held together 
by the electrical attraction of unlike 
charges. 

(iii) The tendency of atoms to complete the 
outer shell by gaining or losing electrons 
determines the chemical activity of the 
elements. 

3. The algebraic sum of the total charges of the ions 
which form an electrically neutral molecule must be 


zero

X. Though most gases may differ greatly in chemical proper¬ 
ties, they show great uniformity in many physical pro¬ 
perties. 

1. All gases, and most liquids and solids, expand with an 
increase of temperature and contract with a decrease 
of temperature. 

2. The volume of a mass of gas varies inversely.as the 
pressure when temperature remains constant. 

(a) Every gas has its own critical temperature. 

3. When any gas is compressed it liberates heat; when it 
expands is absorbs heat.

ing them to the combined effects of high pressure 
and low temperature. 

4. The volumes of gases used and produced in a chemical 
change can always be represented by a ratio of small 
whole numbers. 

5. Equal volumes of gases under the same conditions of 
temperature and pressure contain the same number of 


molecules

CHAPTER 7 


DATA FOR PHYSICS I 

Generalizations 


1. Modern civilization is largely the product of man’s know¬ 
ledge and control of matter and its composition* 

1. The smallest particle into which matter can be 
divided without destroying its characteristic proper¬ 
ties is the molecule* 

(a) The atom is a complex structure composed of a 
relatively heavy nucleus of electrically charged 
particles surrounded by minute electrons travel¬ 
ling in orbits at high speed* 

2, Matter can exist in three states: solid, liquid, gas* 

(a) Solids have definite volume and shape; liquids 
have definite volume but they take the shape of 
the containing vessel; gases have neither a defi¬ 
nite volume nor a definite shape* 

(b) Any gas may expand indefinitely to fill the entire 
space containing it, no matter what the volume* 

(c) In solids the molecules cling together very firmly 
and do not easily change their relative positions;

in liquids the attraction between the molecules 
is less and they slide over one another easily; 
but in gases the molecules move so freely that 
they separate and expand indefinitely* 

3. An increase in temperature increases the molecular 
motion of a substance and promotes fluidity, convert¬ 
ing a solid substance into a liquid and finally into 
a vapor* 

4. Matter cannot be created or destroyed. 

(a) All changes occurring in matter are either physi¬ 
cal changes or chemical changes. 

(i) If the identity of a substance is not lost 

during a change in matter, the change is physi¬ 
cal; if a new substance with new characteris¬ 
tic properties is formed, the change is 
chemical. 

(1) We identify substances by studying their 
special properties. 

(b) The quantity of matter which a given body contains 
is its mass, and this mass does not vary. 

(i) The weight of any body depends upon the mass 
or quantity of matter it contains, and upon 
the measure of the earth’s attraction for it. 

(c) Matter is impenetrable, hence no two objects can 
occupy the same space at the same time. 

(i) All matter is more or less porous.

(a) All matter has the property of inertia, hence 
bodies at rest tend to remain at rest; those in 
motion tend to remain in motion* 

5* Substances differ greatly in such properties as ten¬ 
sile strength, ductility, malleability, hardness, and 
brittleness* 

6. From the units of length, mass, and time, all other 
units of measurement have been derived. 

(a) The C.G.S., or metric system of measurement, is 
a decimal system based on natural standards* 

(b) The F.P.S*, or British system, being based chiefly 
on arbitrarily chosen standards, is cumbersome and 
ill-suited to scientific work. 

7* The weight of a unit volume of any given substance is 
called its density. D = W/TT*

II. Pressure applied anywhere to a body of confined or en¬ 
closed fluid is transmitted with undiminished force in 
every direction* The pressure acts at right angles to 
every portion of the surface of the container with equal 
force upon equal surfaces* 

1* The pressure of a liquid increases in direct propor¬ 
tion to the depth and the density of the liquid, 
p = hd 

2. Liquid pressure is independent of direction and of 
the area or shape of the container. 

3. Water seeks its own level. 

4. A body while immersed in a fluid loses as much weight 
as the fluid it displaces. 

(a) If a body, when submerged in a fluid, displaces 
a weight of fluid greater than its own weight, 
it will rise and float with a part of its volume 
above the surface; but if it displaces a weight

comparing the weight of a given volume of it with 
the weight of an equal volume of air. Sometimes 
hydrogen instead of air is used as the standard for 
comparison. 

(a) Dry air is always denser than moist air. 

(i) Barometers aid in forecasting weather condi¬ 
tions. 

2. Winds blow toward centres of low pressure areas; but 
the rotation of the earth on its axis deflects them 
from their courses producing the rotatory motion 
characteristic of cyclones and anticyclones. 

(a) Cyclones are generally accompanied by cloudy 
weather, precipitation, and higher temperature, 
but anticyclones by fair weather and lower tem¬ 
perature. 

3. Both the temperature and the density of the atmos¬ 
phere decrease as altitude increases. 

4. The volume of any dry gas varies inversely as the 
pressure sustained by it when temperature is kept 
constant. Hence, PV = constant. 

(a) The density of a gas increases in direct propor¬ 
tion to the pressure sustained. 

5. Both air compressor and air exhaustion pumps have 
many uses in modern industry. 

6. Many types of water pumps depend upon air pressure 
for their operation.

IV. The rate and nature of molecular motion depends upon the 
nature of the substance, its state, and its temperature. 
1. All devices which use compressed gases utilize the 


energy of molecular motion. 

(a) Because of their rapid molecular motion, gases 
diffuse or intermingle without regard to weight, 
except that the lighter molecules diffuse more 
rapidly through a porous substance than heavy 
molecules do. 

(i) Without osmosis, plant and animal life would 


cease to exist.

(1) Osmosis or diffusion takes place in both 
directions through a porous wall, but the 
greater flow is normally from the less 
dense to the more dense solution. 

2. All liquids evaporate more rapidly in a vacuum than 
when in air or under pressure. 

3. The evaporation and the diffusion of solids furnish 
evidence that their molecules are in motion. 

4. The state of any mass of matter depends upon the 
balance between the molecular forces and the molecu¬ 
lar velocities of the matter 0 

(a) The tenacity, ductility, hardness, elasticity, 

etc., of a substance depends upon the cohesion of 
its molecules. 

(i) Every material has a certain range of perfect 
elasticity through which it may be distorted 
before its elastic limit is reached. 

(1} Liquids are perfectly elastic and have a 
high elastic constant; gases also are 
perfectly elastic but have a low elastic 
constant, 

(ii) The angle of rebound is always equal to the 
angle of incidence when a perfectly elastic 
body strikes a hard surface. 

(iii) Within the limits of perfect elasticity, the 
elastic constant of any substance equals the

(iv) All liquids behave as if a thin elastic film 
were stretched over their surfaces, even 
though the force of cohesion varies in dif¬ 
ferent liquids. 

(b) The molecular force of adhesion causes liquids to 
rise in capillary tubes if the liquids wet them; 
but liquids which do not wet the capillary tubes 
are depressed. 

(i) The amount of elevation or depression of a 
liquid in a capillary tube is inversely pro¬ 
portional to the diameter of the tube, and 
decreases with increase in the temperature 
of the liquids. 

(ii) One substance dissolves in another if the 
force of adhesion between the molecules of 
solvent and solute is greater than the force 
of cohesion between the molecules of the 
solute. 

(1) Both solids and liquids tend to lower the 
freezing point of a solvent when they 
dissolve in it. 

(2) The solubility of solid substances usually 
increases as the temperature increases; 
but the solubility of most gases decreases 
with increased temperature of the solvent.

of the solvent may cause some of the 
solute to precipitate in the form of 
crystals, the shape and size of which

Laws to be Memorized 

Henry’s Law 
Hooke’s Law 
Law of Capillarity 

V. One of the greatest achievements of man is his knowledge, 

use, and control of heat energy. 

1. Heat energy is a form of energy produced by the vibra¬ 
tion or oscillation of molecules or of the electrons 
in the molecules of matter. 

2. Heat may cause a substance to expand or contract, 
increase its temperature, or change its state. 

3. Heat energy may be transformed into or produced from 
mechanical energy, chemical energy, radiant energy, and 
electrical energy. 

4. The chief sources of heat are: the sun, the interior 
of the earth, friction, chemical action, impact, and 
compression. 

(a) Our chief source of artificial heat is chemical 
action. 

5. The heat of any body depends upon the sum total of all 
the kinetic energies of its molecules; but the tempera¬ 
ture of a body depends upon the average kinetic energy 
of its molecules. 

6. Specially designed instruments must be used to measure 
extreme temperatures and to produce automatic records 
of temperature changes.

7. The total increase in the length of a solid when heated 
must be equal to its length times its change in tem¬ 
perature times its coefficient of linear expansion. 

(a) Solids expand in all directions when heated, hence 
for the same change in temperature the coefficient 
of expansion in area is approximately twice the 
coefficient of linear expansion, and the coeffi¬ 
cient of cubical expansion is three times the 
coefficient of linear expansion. 

(b) Unequal heating causes many substances to crack or 
break. 

(c) Since changes in temperature affect the rate of 
oscillation of pendulums, chronometer balance, 
wheels, etc., some compensating device must be 
used in the construction of accurate chronometers. 

8. An increase in temperature causes most liquids to 
expand. 

(a) Liquids have a higher coefficient of expansion 
than solids, and each liquid has its own charac¬ 
teristic expansion curve. 

9. The coefficient of expansion of all gases is the same 
and the expansion is uniform at all temperatures. 

(a) If the pressure remains constant, the volume of 


any given mass of gas varies directly as the 
absolute temperature.

VI. Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating matter 
and can be transmitted only by wave motion in a material 
medium, 

1. All sound vibrations are either transverse or longi¬ 
tudinal in character, 

2, Sound waves travel at different rates of speed, 
depending upon the nature and condition of the media 
transmitting them, 

(a) For all types of wave motion the velocity equals 
the number of vibrations per second, times the 
wave length. Thus: v = nl.

5. Sound waves normally spread out in all directions. 

4. All sound waves will reflect from suitable surfaces, 
producing an echo which is a reflected sound wave of 
undiminished velocity. 

5. Sounds differ from one another in loudness, intensity, 
and pitch. 

(a) The intensity of sound is increased either by 
increasing the amplitude of the vibrations or 
the area of the vibrating body, or by increasing 
both amplitude and area. 

(b) The loudness of sound is inversely proportional 
to the square of the distance from the source, 
and depends upon the nature of the medium through 
which the sound travels. 

{c) The pitch of a note depends upon the number of 
vibrations or pulses per second, but is indepen¬ 
dent ofloudness and quality. 

■ 6. The natural vibration rate of a body depends upon the 
length, thickness, and material constitution of the 
vibrating body. 

(a) Sympathetic vibration occurs when the natural 
vibration rates of two objects are the same, or 
when the vibration rate of one of them is a mul¬ 
tiple of the other. 

7. When the condensation of one sound wave meets the 


rarefaction of another identical sound wave, silence 
is produced.

length is four times as long as the pipe itself; 
while any open pipe produces a sound wave twice 
the length of the open pipe. 

7. In many wind instruments a vibrating air jet is the 
source of the sound. 

8. Vibrating plates, bells, etc., produce notes which 
are not whole number multiples of the fundamentals; 
and it is quite impossible to have such objects pro¬ 
duce harmony by simultaneous vibrations. 

9. Many devices such as the manometric flame, the 


Helmholtz resonators, the phonodeik, and the oscil¬ 
lograph are used to analyse sounds graphically.

2. Though most of our natural light comes from the 
sun, light may also be produced artificially in 
many ways. 

(a) Any body which gives off light because of the 
energy of its own oscillatory particles is 
luminous; but if it merely reflects the light 
it receives, it is "illuminated". 

(b) Light which falls upon a body may be reflected, 
absorbed, or transmitted in various degrees, 
depending upon the nature of the object, and 
the wave length of the light. 

5. The velocity of light is approximately 186,000 
miles per second in air, but varies considerably 
in other media. 

4. Photometry deals with the measurement of the inten¬ 
sity of light. 

(a) The amount of light a body receives is inversely 
proportional to the square of its distance from 
the source, and directly proportional to the 
intensity of the source. 

(i) The quantity of illumination is measured in 


foot-candles, and the quantity of light 
emitted is measured in lumens.

IX* The amount of light which an object reflects depends upon 
the nature of the material, the polish of the surface, 
and the angle at which the light strikes the surface. 

1* The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of 
incidence of light. 

2. Any highly polished surface which can be used to form 
images by the regular reflection of light has the 
properties of a mirror. 

(a) All real images are inverted, but virtual images 


are always erect; and both types may vary in

(a) The index of refraction for any two media is con¬ 
stant no matter what the angle of incidence of 
light. 

(b) Total reflection always occurs when the angle of 
incidence exceeds the critical angle. 

2. A portion of any transparent substance can be used 
as a lens, provided that it is bounded by two non¬ 
parallel curved surfaces, or by one plane surface and 
one curved surface, 

(a) Converging lenses are always thicker in the middle 
than at the edges, while diverging lenses are 
thicker at the edges than in the middle, 

(b) Lenses refract parallel incident rays so that 
they meet at the principal focus. 

(c) Increasing the index of refraction shortens the 
focal length of a lens or lens system. 

5. The spherical aberration which occurs in lenses as 
well as in mirrors may be remedied by the use of a 
diaphragm or by specially ground lens surfaces.

XI, Light has become extremely useful in modern civilization 
through the development of optical instruments which pro¬ 
duce and control it. 

1, Optical instruments depend upon a great variety of 
lenses and combinations of lenses in order to control 
light. 

2. All objects seen by the eye are more distant than 
twice its focal length, hence the image thrown upon 
the retina is a real, inverted, and small image. 

(a) Only certain defects of the eye, such as far¬ 
sightedness, shortshightedness, and astigmatism 
may be corrected satisfactorily by means of 
spectacles. 

(b) One learns to judge the size of an object by the 
size of the visual angle if the distance is known; 
and conversely, if the size of the object is 
known one may judge the distance it is away. 

(c) Binocular vision enables us to get the perception 
of depth or perspective.

3. The camera is modelled after the eye and is superior 
to it in some respects, though inferior to it in 
others. 

4. All microscopes form an enlarged image of the ob¬ 
ject by one set of lenses, and this image is then 
magnified again by another set. 

5. Though telescopes may be either refracting or 
reflecting in character, they must first collect a 
large quantity of light to form a bright, real image, 
which is then magnified.

CHAPTER VI 


DATA FOR GEOLOGY I 

Generalizations 


I. All bodies in our solar system are controlled by the 
gravitational attraction of the sun about which they 
revolve in huge ellipses and in nearly the same plane. 
1. Most modern theories regarding the origin of the 
planets agree that these bodies have resulted from 
the collection and condensation of gases and other 
materials about certain nuclei. 

(a) Certain of these masses of gas cooled enough to 
form liquid spheres, and these by further cool¬ 
ing developed solid crusts of rock on their 
surfaces.

II. The crust of the earth is subject to two opposing forces: 
those tending to build it up; and those tending to break 
it down. 

1, The fossil remains of marine life in rocks prove that 
such rocks were formed from sediment on the bottom 
of an ancient sea. 

£. Denudation of one part of the earth*s surface must be 
accompanied by deposition in another part. 

(a) Elevation of certain areas often results from 
deposition and subsidence in adjacent areas. 

3. Hock strata occur in the earth’s surface in the order 
in which they were deposited, except in the case of 
overthrust faults. 

(a) The succession of fossils in the rocks shows a 
progressive series of simple to complex life 
forms.

III. The history of the earth has been divided into time 

intervals marked by important events such as the rise 
of certain kinds of animals and plants, invasions of 
the sea over the land, elevation of land masses, rais¬ 
ing of mountains, and so forth.' 

1. The chief eras of the earth 1 s history have been 
based on the kinds of life which were dominant at 
certain times. 

2. Rock formations having the same uniform character 
were formed under the same conditions. 

(a) The kind of rock in a formation, together with 
the kind of fossils contained in it, gives an 
index of the conditions under which it was 
formed.

which it is in direct contact. 

2. The moisture-carrying capacity of our air varies 
with the temperature of the air, increasing as the 
air becomes warmer, and decreasing as the air be¬ 
comes cooler. 

(a) Air must be cooled to, or below, its dew-point 
before the moisture it contains will begin to 
precipitate. 

(i) Air which must be cooled below the freezing 
point of water in order to reach the dew¬ 
point will precipitate moisture in the form 
of snow. 

3. The sun is the source of all energy in the atmosphere. 

(a) The temperature of the atmosphere decreases with 
the altitude. 

(b) The radiant energy of the sun is composed of many 
different wave lengths, each of which has certain 
important functions. 

(i) Certain substances will allow heat waves to 
pass through them while others absorb the 
heat waves and become warm. 

(ii) Any object which is warmer than its surround¬ 
ings will radiate heat. 

(iii) Heat may be transferred by radiation, con¬ 
duction or convection. 

(1) Metals are generally good conductors of 

heat, but many other solids, most liquids,

and gases are poor conductors, 

(2) Rock and soil materials will absorb heat 
more rapidly than water does, but they 
also cool more rapidly. 


(c) Convection currents result from unequal heating 
of a mass of liquid or gas. 

(d) Air is a poor conductor of heat and, if convec¬ 
tion currents can be prevented, air becomes a 
good insulator. 

(i) The atmosphere of the earth tends to prevent 


the escape of heat from the earth’s surface. 


(e) Land and sea breezes, monsoons, planetary winds, 
and other movements of the atmosphere depend 
upon convection currents in the air, 

(f) The more oblique the angle at which the sun’s 
rays strike the earth’s surface, the less heat 
per unit area is produced.

V. The original source of all water is the ocean. 

1. The topography of the ocean floor as compared with 
land surfaces is fairly smooth. 

(a) Most deposits on the sea floor are formed from 
sediments which came from the continents or from 
the skeletons of animals and plants which lived 
near the ocean surface. 

(i) Ocean life is most abundant on the continental 
shelves. 

(ii) All marine life is dependent directly or 
indirectly upon the salt content of sea water. 

2. Large bodies of water produce a moderating effect upon 
the temperature of adjacent land areas. 

3. Almost all forms of tides are produced by the attrac¬ 
tion of the sun and moon upon the earth and its hydro¬ 
sphere. 

(a) The nature of a tide is dependent upon the rela¬ 
tive positions of the sun, moon, and earth; and 
upon the nature of the coastline. 

4. Ocean currents result from the combined effects of 
convection currents, prevailing winds, and the rota¬ 
tory movement of the earth. 

(a) The temperature of ocean water decreases with the 
depth. 

(b) The principal ocean eddies have been formed under 
the influence of the planetary winds of the earth

VI. Scientific knowledge of the origin and character of the 
surface strata of the earth depends upon natural and 
artificial exposures of the rock layers. 

1. Residual soils generally get coarser with depths 
grading from soil at the surface to boulders and 
bed rock underneath. 

2. Most sedimentary rocks have been laid down upon the 
continents or upon the continental shelves; but 
little is known about rocks of the ocean floor. 

3. All rocks may be classified according to their origin 
and formation as igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic.

(a) Both igneous and sedimentary rocks may be greatly 
altered in composition and structure by one or 
more of the agents of heat, pressure, and water. 

4. Mountains are most frequently produced either by 
laccoliths or batholiths which form the roots of the 
mountain structure. 

(a) Ore deposits are often associated with batholiths. 

5. Consolidation of deposits may be brought about by 
the great pressure of overlying beds, by the pressure 
resulting from earth movements, or by the chemical 
action of cementing materials such as silica, iron 
oxide, or calcium carbonate. 

6. Most stratified rocks have been deposited by water, 
and are composed of particles fairly well assorted 
according to size. 

(a) Most deposits of limestone, salt, gypsum, etc., 
have resulted from the partial or complete 
evaporation of large bodies of sea water or 
lakes. 

7. Coal is formed from the remains of plant bodies which 
have accumulated in lakes, swamps, deltas, etc., and 
which under the influence of water, chemical action, 
and pressure have been converted into coal. 

8. Alternating beds of sandstone and shale, or of shale 
and limestone indicate that the area was once the 
fluctuating shore-line of an ancient lake or sea.

VII. Weathering agents'continually change the surface of the 
earth’s crust by causing rock to disintegrate to produce 
soil, and by aiding in the production of new sedimentary 
deposits. 

1. Since the earth’s crust is subject to slow rising and 
sinking movements, all rocks will ultimately be sub¬ 
jected to weathering and erosion. 

2. Weathering is due to the action of water, air, and 
temperature changes. 

(a) The rate at which rock weathers depends upon 
such factors as the kind of rock, the climate,

the exposure, the slope, and the amount of 
vegetation present. 

3. Denudation, which includes weathering and erosion, 
tends to reduce the land surface to sea level. 

4. The water in all lakes and rivers came from preci¬ 
pitation from the atmosphere. 

(a) Much of the rain which falls to the ground 
becomes either "immediate runoff" or "delayed 
runoff", depending upon the character and con¬ 
ditions of the soil mantle. 

(b) A water table is everywhere present, but at 
varying depths depending on the depth of the 
first impervious stratum and upon the amount of 
precipitation. 

(i) Underground water is an important source of 
water for wells and streams and is also an 
agent in the formation of ore deposits. 

(c) The presence of lakes, swamps, and vegetation 
decreases erosion. 

(d) Rivers give important aid to thegathering pro¬ 
cesses. 

(i) The erosive power of a river varies as the 
square of its velocity. 

{ii) The velocity of a river is determined by 

the slope, capacity and nature of the channel, 
and by the volume of water moving.

(iii) Erosion by a river is generally most rapid 
at its moutb, decreasing with decrease in 
the gradient of the stream. 

(iv) Rivers fed by lakes or swamps carry very 
little sediment and erode their channels 
slowly. 

(v) As the gradient of a river becomes less, 
the tendency for the river to meander be¬ 
comes greater. 

(vi) Rivers become mature at their mouths first. 

(vii) As a river valley approaches old age, the 
surrounding country is gradually reduced 

to a peneplain by the meandering stream, 

(©) Lakes are formed by some interference with the 

normal drainage system of an area. 

(i) Any area of internal drainage where eva¬ 
poration is rapid will develop salt lakes. 

(ii) Lakes are only temporary geological fea¬ 
tures since they tend to become filled in, 
drained, or evaporated. 

(iii) Areas of incomplete drainage form swamps. 

5. Most coastal plains have been formed from uplifted 

marine plains.

times part of an old sea bottom now elevated above sea 
level. 

1. Plains may or may not be forested. 


(a) Plateaus have probably been plains which were 
elevated along with the mountains by crustal 
movements of the earth. 

(b) Erosion of plateaus proceeds like the erosion 
of plains, except that, since the rocks of 
plateaus are usually harder and the climate

mucfc drier, the rate of erosion is slowed down* 
2. Deserts are characterized by the fact that they 
support few forms of life. 

(a) Erosion in deserts is accomplished chiefly by 
changes in temperature, and by the scouring ac¬ 
tion of the wind and sand. 

IX. Volcanoes do not involve strata dislocation, as mountain 
building movements always do. 

1. Most of the volcanoes of the earth’s surface lie in 
two zones which almost coincide with the mountain 
ranges and earthquake zones of the earth, 

(a) Mountain building movements are probably the 

real origin of volcanic activity. 

(i) Lava erupted from volcanoes is of the same 
general composition as the surface rocks, 
and probably does not come from great depths. 

(ii) Lava flows may well up from a fissure in the 
earth’s crust and spread out over great areas 
of the earth’s surface, forming deep lava 
fields of resistant rock. 

(iii) Fumaroles, hot springs, geysers, and crater 
lakes are found in areas in which volcanic 
action is in the last stages of decline 
before complete extinction. 

(iv) The heat which produces hot springs may

originate from a rising batholith, friction 
of moving rock masses, chemical action in the 
rock, or from the earth’s hot interior. 

2. Soils formed from decomposed lava are very fertile. 

3. Though earthquakes may be associated with volcanoes, 
they are usually caused by faulting movements of the 
earth’s crust.

X. The strata of mountains are rarely horizontal, but are 
characterized by folds and faults which may be very com¬ 
plicated in structure. 

1. As a mountain range is denuded it tends to separate 
into individual units which often have high peaks or 
long ridges. 

(a) Mountain passes are often formed where streams 
head together or where glaciers have been active. 

2. Mountains in the path of prevailing winds cause pre¬ 
cipitation to be heaviest on the windward side; but 
give rise to deserts or semi-desert conditions on

the leeward side. 

(a) In all mountain regions temperature decreases with 
increased elevation. 

3. When uplift proceeds more rapidly than denudation, 
mountains remain young; but once uplift ceases, denu¬ 
dation gradually produces low rounded mountains with 
broad forested valleys as the mountain ranges are 
reduced in old age to a peneplain. 

4, To produce glaciers in their valleys mountains must be 
high, cold, and so situated that they receive much 
precipitation. 

(a) Glaciers move at different rates depending on the 
size and thickness of the glacier and the slope 
and nature of the valley down which it moves. 

(i) The flow of ice in a glacier is faster in the 
middle and at the top surface since friction 
is greatest on the sides and the bottom. 

(ii) Glacial erosion grinds off the sharp features 
of the land and fills depressions with the 
debris. 

(1) The most characteristic effect of glacia¬ 
tion on a mountain region is the produc¬ 
tion of broad, smooth V-shaped valleys, 
truncated spurs, and hanging valleys. 

(b) The present epoch is believed to be one of many 
interglacial periods of warm climate characterized

by retreating continental ice sheets, 

(i) Drainage was greatly affected by the continen¬ 
tal ice sheets which blocked normal outlets, 
carved new river valleys, and produced vast 
new lakes. 

(ii) Though many theories have been formulated to 
explain the cause of glacial epochs, the most 
acceptable explanation is based on the fact 
that temperatures decrease when the carbon 
dioxide content of the atmosphere decreases.

XI. Climate refers to the average weather conditions of a 

region as observed over a long period of years. 

1. Weather is the condition of the atmosphere with res¬ 
pect to temperature, barometric pressure, direction 
and velocity of the wind, humidity, and the state of 
the sky at any given time. 

2. Latitude is the chief factor which determines climate, 
but it is modified in its effects by a number of 
other factors such as altitude, prevailing winds, 
ocean currents, mountain ranges, and location on a 
continent. 

5. The winds of the earth tend to occur in belts because 
of the unequal heating of the earth*s surface. 

(a) Areas of low pressure are generally characterized 
by relatively high temperatures and precipitation, 
while areas of high pressure tend toward lower 
temperatures, less precipitation, and clear 
skies. 

4. The principal factors governing the climate of 
Canada are latitude and prevailing winds. 

5. Rock and fossil evidence indicates that all regions 
of the earth have passed through cyclic climatic 
changes from frigid to torrid.

XII. Most of Alberta’s present mineral wealth comes from 
oil, coal, and natural gas. 

1. Goal has been formed from vegetation which accu¬ 
mulated in certain places and which was subsequently 
covered by water or sedimentary deposits, thus pro¬ 
viding the necessary conditions for bacterial action, 
chemical change, and pressure. 

(a) The longer that microbian action is allowed to 
continue and the higher the pressure exerted 
upon the deposit, the higher the quality of 
coal produced. 

(i) --The higher the percentage of fixed carbon 
and the lower the percentage of volatile 
matter the higher the heat value of coal 
and hence the better the grade. 

(ii) , Most deposits of coal found in the plains 
improve in quality the deeper they are 
found. 

2. Petroleum contains more than 1000 different chemical 
compounds which are of use to man. 

(a) Petroleum oil and natural gas have probably 
been formed from the remains of plants and 
animals which were buried in the clays and 
sands of sea coasts, bays, swamps, and lakes. 

(b) A number of structures such as anticlines, 
domes or other porous rock formations may serve 
as reservoirs for the oil and gas produced by

natural distillation. 

(c) The amount of oil recoverable from an oil well 
depends upon the amount of gas which is dis¬ 
solved, the oil, and the manner in which the 
gas pressure is preserved after drilling. 

(d) The higher the gravity of the crude oil, the 
more valuable the oil. 

3. Oil deposits are generally associated with gas, 
but gas is not always associated with oil. 

4. Since Alberta has large deposits of coal and lime¬ 
stone, extensive iron-producing industries could 
be developed there if iron ore of good quality and 
in sufficient quantity could be found near. 

5. Alberta has deposits of a large number of non- 
metailic ores which are present in commercial quan¬ 
tity.

Conclusions Regarding the 
Biology I Course 


Generalizations 

The generalizations of this course have been pre¬ 
sented in the text by means of a series of problems, each 
involving certain learning activities, explanatory reading 
material, and exercises* Each unit problem, together with 
the sub-problems, leads the pupil inductively to a fuller com¬ 
prehension of one or more important biological generalizations. 
The fact that a generalization should be "both a process and 
a result of that process" has been consistently kept in mind 
by the authors in presenting the textual material for this 
course. Though the Biology I course appears to provide a 
rather light year’s work for the average student, the scope 
is great enough to furnish the necessary foundational con¬ 
cepts to enable the student to appreciate and understand better 
the structure of living things, the physiology of animate 
things, and their relationships and classifications. The main 
branches of Biology, such as taxonomy, ecology, genetics, 
morphology, physiology, adaptation, and behavior have been 
adequately introduced to give the pupil a well unified view 
of the whole field through concepts which pupils at the Grade 
X level can comprehend. This has been accomplished by build¬ 
ing the instructional material around a core of approximately

117 generalizations. 

Learning Load 

Since Biology I is a standard three-credit course, 
it must be given at least three standard-length periods-*- of 
instruction time per week; and since a period of four weeks 
is recommended for review at the end of the school year, which 
has a total of thirty-six weeks, there remains a total of 
thirty-two weeks of instruction time. The maximum number of 
periods available to the student for instruction is therefore 
96, exclusive of review. The average amount of time which the 
student and teacher may utilize to develop and learn one 
generalization would accordingly be twenty-seven minutes. 

Using the data from Table I, the learning load for 
Biology I may be expressed as follows: 

During a period of 27 minutes a student, on an 
average, must develop and learn one generalization. In the 
course of doing this he must: 

1. learn at least one diagram or do one "activity" 
related to the generalization. 

2. learn from three to four new words. 

3. answer from one to two questions or exercises 
based on the generalization. 

4. read approximately 712 words (about 2 pages of 
the text book). 

^ Programme of Studies for High School. Regulations, 1943, 
Page 7, defines a standard-length period to be 35 minutes.

To indicate further that the learning load for 
Biology I is light, let us select at random one of the main 
generalizations and then examine the text book material used 
to develop it. Suppose that Generalization III (p.14 of this 
thesis) has been selected. This main principle, together 
with all its sub-generalizations, is found in Unit 17 of the 
text book. 

To develop this main generalization that "life must 
come from life”, it may be shown that the authors use 40 
pages of textual material and employ 17 sub-generalizations. 

In addition, they use 23 questions and 7 suggested activities 
as supplementary material designed to emphasize further and 
clarify the main concept. 

Now the amount of time required for a Grade X stu¬ 
dent to read Unit 17 once is approximately 80 minutes” 1 *; but 
for the purpose of thorough study most students should read 
the entire unit at least three times. This would require a 
total of approximately 240 minutes. From calculations made 
at the beginning of this chapter, it has been shown that there 
are 27 minutes of class time available for each of the 117 
generalizations of the Biology I course. To learn the 18 
generalizations of Unit 17 there is, therefore, a total of 
486 minutes; but of this about 240 minutes would be spent in 

Based on a number of reading-rate tests given to a Grade X 
Geology class over the period September to December, 1940, 
and believed by the author to represent the usual reading 
rate of an average Grade X class.

generalizations * 

Once the reading has been thoroughly done, the 23 
questions listed should be answered. These are mainly short- 
answer questions and the average student would be able to 
answer them within 45 minutes. There would remain then 
approximately 200 minutes of regular school time for the student 
to do the 7 suggested experiments and activities. The student 
would be required to: 

1. prepare a culture of bread mold, and to examine 
a sample of bread mold, using a microscope. 

2. show how roots may develop from stems and leaves; 
and how stems and leaves may develop from roots (owing to 
the ability of plants to regenerate missing parts). 

3. visit a greenhouse and find out how different 
plants propagate. 

4. examine the parts of a complete flower by dis¬ 
secting it; make cross-sections of the ovary, the 
anther, and the stigma; and observe prepared slides of 
these with a microscope. 

5. obtain some eggs of a turtle, frog, or toad, 
and observe them as they hatch. 

6. collect abandoned bird’s nests and observe the 
materials of which they are made. 

7. observe a robin or other wild bird selecting 


its nesting place

Of these experiments and activities the only ones 
which could be done by the whole class and in regular class 
periods would be No. f s 1, 2, 3, and 4. The other activities 
are of such a nature that they would have to be done in out- 
of-school hours. The available class time for activities 1, 
2, 3, and 4 would therefore be 200 minutes, or approximately 
3§ hours. This appears to be ample time in which to complete 
these four activities. 

In general, then, the Biology I course appears to 
provide the desirable scope of an introductory course and, at 
the same time, to furnish the student with an adequate number 
of generalizations, the development of which does not demand 
a heavy learning load. 

Conclusions Regarding the 
Chemistry I Course 


Generalizations 

This course contains 130 generalizations. In scope 
these embrace a very wide variety of topics and constitute an 
excellent introductory course. They do two chief things: 

(a) they furnish abundant opportunities for the student to 
learn the scientific method and to apply it in a variety of 
different situations; and (b) they give the student a consider¬ 
able body of practical information about the preparation,

properties, and uses of many of the most commonly used chemi¬ 
cals which make modern civilization possible. The interrela¬ 
tionship and ultimate unity of science is emphasized through¬ 
out. This course is quite adequate in respect to the number 
and nature of the generalizations it emphasizes. 

Learning Load 

Unlike Biology I, this course in Chemistry I is a 
five-credit course and the maximum number of instruction 
periods is 160. These periods are also thirty-five minutes 
in length. The average amount of time, therefore, which may 
be devoted by the student to learning one of these generaliza¬ 
tions would be approximately forty-three minutes. 

Then, from the data in Table I, it can be calculated 
that, during a period of 43 minutes, the average amount of 
work which the student would be expected to perform in the 
process of learning one generalization would be as follows: 

1. learn one diagram or do one activity (experi¬ 
ment) for every two generalizations learned. 

2. learn one new word for each generalization 
learned. 

3. memorize one formal definition for every three 
generalizations learned. 

4. memorize one law for every thirteen generali¬ 
zations learned. 

5. learn one equation for every two generaliza¬ 
tions learned. 

6. answer from five to six questions or exercises 
based on each generalization.

7. read approximately 506 words (about 2 pages of 
the text book). 

Fpom the above calculations it would appear that the 
learning load imposed upon a student in gaining a mastery of 
the generalizations of the present Chemistry I course is not 
heavy and should be within the capabilities of the average 
first-year science student. 

Conclusions Regarding the 
Physics I Course 


Comparison of Two Physics I Texts 

Under the heading "Physics I" in Table I, data 
obtained from an analysis of two text books in Physics I have 
been recorded. Dull, "Modern Physics" is the text book 
authorized since September, 1944; but prior to this, Merchant 
and Chant, "Elements of Physics for Canadian Schools"was the 
authorized text book. In comparing the two texts from the 
recorded data, the following significant facts appear: 

1. The number of generalizations has been con¬ 
siderably increased in the new course. 

2. The vocabulary expansion in the new course is 
more than double that of the old course. 

3. There has been a considerable increase in all 
the other elements of core material.

4. The instruction time remains unchanged. 

Generalizations of the New Course 

The generalizations of the new course are consider¬ 
ably wider in scope than those of the old course. This is 
not due to an actual increase in the number of main topics 
included in the course, but rather to an increase in the 
scope of the relationships developed. There are more general¬ 
izations developed as well as inferred in the new course than 
in the old one, chiefly because a much wider relationship 
between physics and other sciences has been made clear. Such 
a trend is entirely in agreement with the chief objectives of 
modern science education. 

Learning Load 

Since the number of generalizations in the new 
authorized course in Physics I has increased more than 30$ 
as compared with the number of generalizations found in the 
old course, there has resulted a considerable increase in the 
learning lead for the student. 

Physics I is a five-credit course and, as in the 
case of Chemistry I, there is a maximum instruction time of 
160 standard-length periods provided for it. Since there are 
148 generalizations to be learned, the average amount of time 
which should be devoted to mastering one generalization would

be as follows: 

1. learn at least two new words* 

2. learn one formal definition for every seven 
generalizations mastered. 

3. learn one law for every seven generalizations 
mastered. 

4. learn to draw or do at least three diagrams or 
activities for every four generalizations 
learned* 

5. answer approximately four questions or exercises 
for each generalization learned. 

6. read approximately 790 words (almost 2 pages of 
the text book)* 

Such a learning load does not appear to be heavy for 
an average first-year high school student. 


Conclusions Regarding the 
Geology I Gourse 


Generalizations 

The generalizations of this course are wider in 
scope than those of any of the other three sciences included 
in this investigation. They form excellent media through 
which the well trained and thoroughly informed teacher may 
create the proper unity among the high school sciences and 
link them into the really tangible and practical experience 
of the child. The text for the geology course provides an 
abundance of generalizations on geology, but these too often

appear as direct statements of fact. In such a condensed 
form instructional material cannot furnish the student with 
the abundant opportunity he should have in discovering and 
gathering the details from which he may arrive at the general¬ 
izations himself. However, this defect may be remedied by a 
frequent use of the two authorized reference texts in geology, 
each of which forms excellent collateral material. 

Learning Load 

Geology I, like Biology I, is a general elective 
carrying three credits. There is, therefore, a maximum 
instruction time of only 96 standard-length periods. Since 
there are 126 generalizations to be learned, the average amount 
of time which can be devoted by teacher and class to the 
mastery of one generalization would be 27 minutes. From the 
data in Table I it can then be calculated that within this 
period of 27 minutes the average amount of work which the 
student should do to master one generalization would be as 
follows: 

1. learn approximately two new words. 

2. learn one diagram or do one activity. 

3. answer one question or exercise. 

4. read approximately 408 words (about two-thirds 
of a page of the text). 

The learning load for Geology I is light. This is 
in large measure due to the fact that too many of the general¬ 
izations of this course are presented in the form of con-

Gentrated factual material, leaving too little scop© for the 
student to exercise his own initiative in finding facts and 
in marshalling the appropriate evidence to make the process 
of generalization functional for him. 

General Conclusions 


The data presented in this investigation are the 
results of an attempt to determine the generalizations which 
form the core material of four of the first-year science 
courses of Alberta High Schools, and the weight of the learn¬ 
ing load which each of these presents to the student. 

The generalizations together with the various items 
which constitute the main aspects of the learning processes 
have been selected, organized, and listed for each science 
course. Conclusions were then drawn from the data for each 
course respecting the scope and nature of the generalizations. 
In addition the learning load which one generalization would, 
on the average, impose upon a student wishing to gain a 
reasonably complete mastery of the course content was esti¬ 
mated. 

The general conclusions drawn from this investiga¬ 
tion are as follows: 

1. These courses all contain sufficient generali¬ 
zations of a fundamental nature wide enough in variety and 
scope to constitute an adequate basis for future science

courses in a more specialized field. 

2. All the courses except Geology I furnish the 
student with plenty of opportunity to formulate generaliza¬ 
tions from the factual material given. 

3. The learning load for reasonably complete mas¬ 
tery of the material of each course is not unduly great, even 
in the case of Physics I which presents the largest number of 
generalizations. 


Implications 


From the data of this investigation certain implica¬ 
tions appear to follow: 

1. That criticisms directed against our present 
first-year science courses are not substantiated by the data 
of this thesis, since there appear to be present in the 
courses investigated all the material elements essential for 
achieving the main objectives of modern science education-- 
the elements of wide scope, abundant generalizations, and 
plenty of opportunity for the student to generalize. 

2. That the courses investigated here are not too 
detailed or too long. The data concerning the average learn¬ 
ing load indicate that the average student should not find 
abnormal difficulty in performing the work required to gain 
reasonably complete mastery of these courses. 

3. That perhaps the reason why our present achieve-

ments in science education in the high school are falling 
short of the standard objectives is to be found in the methods 
of teaching and in the conditions under which students learn 
rather than in the material content of the text books used. 
Concurrent with attempts to improve the material content of 
the science courses, greater efforts should be made to 
improve both the teaching processes and the learning pro- 
cesses as they affect the student. Until science teaching in 
the High Schools is so conducted as to challenge and hold the 
students 1 interest and is based on a full recognition of the 
psychology of youth as well as upon the principles of good 
pedagogy in which definite relationships between the real 
things of a child’s environment are of paramount importance, 
no course in science, no matter how thoroughly appropriate 
the content may be, can possibly give its best results.

CHAPTER VIII 


CRITICISMS AND SUGGESTIONS 

Biology I 


In the opinion of the writer, the course in Biology 
I, though appropriately presented, should be improved in three 
ways. First, since Biology I even more than Chemistry I or 
Physics I carries important cultural values, it should be 
given a more prominent place among the first-year science 
courses. Biology I, perhaps more than any of the other first- 
year science courses, aims to improve the pupil’s behavior in 
and adjustment to his living and physical environment, It 
aims to help the pupil understand himself as an integral part 
of his surroundings. Though biology should contribute greatly 
to?mrd a favorable adjustment of the individual to his environ¬ 
ment, it should at the same time provide him with more scien¬ 
tific methods of thinking and more desirable attitudes toward 
life in its varied manifestations. But to attain these very 
essential outcomes, which are fully as important as the 
desired outcomes of any of the other courses, more time must 
be devoted to this subject. 

Secondly, the content of the course should be 
expanded to include a fuller discussion of such practical sub-

jects as those in the following list: 

1. Community health problems common to many rural 
and urban areas should be discussed from the general biologi¬ 
cal point of view. Thus, certain disease-carrying agents, 
common disease-producing micro-organisms, methods of pre¬ 
vention or control of common diseases, and the part played by 
research in safeguarding community health should be important 
aspects of this topic. 

2. Field excursions should be discussed. Instruc¬ 
tions and suggestions should be given for carrying out these 
field trips which are designed to aid the student in studying 
systematically some of the living plants and animals found in 
the immediate environment of his school. A considerable num¬ 
ber of such excursions should be required as a compulsory part 
of the course. 

3. Foods and nutrition should be further discussed. 
Special emphasis should be placed on balanced diets, vitamins, 
and common nutritional deficiencies in man. Students should 
be familiar with a considerable amount of factual material 

on this subject, as well as with the broader generalizations, 
and an increased effort should be made to make this knowledge 
functional. Heiss^ puts it this way: "Simply to know that a 
balanced diet is necessary for good health may have some value, 
but to make this generalization effective in everyday life one

must also have a knowledge of the principal nutrients in com¬ 
mon foods, and furthermore must know what proportions of the 
various food nutrients make a balanced diet.” 

Lastly, the text book for Biology I should contain 
a vastly increased number of illustrations, diagrams, and pic¬ 
tures, together with a much greater number of objective-type 
test questions so designed that they would aid the child to 
learn and to review the more important details upon which the 
generalizations of the course are built. 

Chemistry I 


The real object of this course as it has been set 
forth in the authorized text is "the mastery of the fundamen¬ 
tal principles and facts of chemistry as the science of the 
changes in matter”.^ The authors, in pursuing this aim, have 
developed a first-year course in chemistry that is informative, 
very coherent, and for the most part very suitable for High 
School students who are beginning the study of this rather 
specialized science. 

To the writer of this thesis, however, the course 
has two main defects. First, it is too didactic: it neglects 
almost completely the intriguing stories of those brilliant 
personalities who have made the history of chemistry such a

fascinating study. One of the first duties of any course 
should be to catch the interests and awaken the enthusiasm of 
the student in order that the necessary desire for further 
study be generated. The present course in chemistry could be 
made much more interesting and profitable to student and teacher 
alike, if less stress were placed on certain difficult topics 
such as: determining the formula of a compound, isotopes, 
atomic structure, reversible reactions, etc,, and more attention 
given to the history of chemistry and the many ways in which 
modern living conditions are dependent upon this science. 

Secondly, the experimental aspect of the course is 
not sufficiently stressed. The importance of measurement and 
technique should be emphasized by having the students carry out 
a considerable number of the simpler experiments involving 
measurement. Unless this is done, one of the chief aims of 
science education—the development of the scientific attitude 
in the student—cannot be successfully attained, and the stu¬ 
dent will continue to feel that learning the factual material 
of the text is the principal objective in Chemistry I. 

Physics 1 


More than any other science studied in High School, 
physics deals with the measurement of the properties of matter. 
Though this course should therefore offer an abundant oppor-

tunity for the student to learn the techniques of making 
measurements as well as the correct way of expressing the 
measurements made, it is common knowledge that graduates of 
our high schools are too often very inefficient in both these 
respects. Part of the reason for this can, no doubt, be traced 
either to inefficient instruction or to carelessness on the 
part of the student; but part of the trouble most certainly can 
be found in the nature of the text books studied. 

In the present authorized text book, a space of only 
two pages is devoted to a formal study of the units of measure¬ 
ment. Nowhere throughout the text has the author considered 
it necessary to discuss methods of measurement nor common 
errors in the techniques of measurement. Though the units of r 
measurement used in the text are carefully defined and excel¬ 
lent examples of their use shown both in formulae and in 
examples of solutions to problems, the importance of measure¬ 
ment is not sufficiently emphasized. In the opinion of the 
writer of this thesis, much more attention should be paid to 
learning- accurate definitions of the units of measurement, the 
relationship of these units one to the other, and to the proper 
methods of expressing magnitude in terms of these units. 

Actual practice in the techniques of measurement should be 
given by experiments in which procedures should be indicated 
and probable errors in techniques discussed. As in the case 
of Chemistry I, the Physics I course should have increased 
emphasis placed upon experiment, if the aim of developing a

scientific attitude in the pupil is to be achieved. 

Considerable space in the currently authorized text 
book for Physics I has been devoted to the study of lenses and 
the formation of images; to the study of musical notes and the 
mathematical relationships existing between these; and to the 
construction and operation of certain rather complex optical 
instruments. Yet, the fundamental principles of magnetism, 
electricity, and the simpler machines have been omitted from 
this course entirely. Since, for a considerable number of 
students, Physics I is the only course in physics which they 
get in our High School, it would seem that an understanding of 
such things as the electro-magnet, the electric bell, the 
electric motor, batteries, internal combustion engines, etc. 
would be of far greater practical value to them than a know¬ 
ledge of the construction of the microscope, the operation 
of the spectroscope, or an understanding of the tempered 
scale. 


Geology I 


There are four text books authorized as source 
material for the course in Geology I. The data given in this 
thesis were taken from the text which the author believes is 
being used most widely by the teachers of the province. 

Since, however, the choice of both the type and quantity of

material for this course has been left so largely to the indi¬ 
vidual teacher, there is little value in attempting to make 
definite criticisms of the course. There are, however, a few 
suggestions which the writer would like to make regarding the 
teaching of High School Geology. First, it should be remembered 
that all the out-of-doors activities of one’s life time, no 
matter where spent, involve a continuous contact with the 
earth--the matrix of life and of natural law. Geology, being 
the study of the earth, is thus admirably suited for showing 
the unity of the sciences. Many of the principles and general¬ 
izations already learned by the student in physics, chemistry, 
and biology, reappear in geology, operating together as inter¬ 
acting and often interdependent factors to produce the en¬ 
vironment we know. This aspect of geology should be con¬ 
sistently emphasized in teaching the course. In this age 
more than ever before, the student has an opportunity of com¬ 
ing in contact with the innumerable aspects of nature. Hence, 
if this first course in geology can make the science knowledge 
of the student functional, that is if it can enable him to see, 
understand, and appreciate more fully the action and inter¬ 
action of natural laws in the world about him, then the time 
spent in the study of this course can be amply justified. 

The second suggestion is that greater emphasis be 
put on field excursions and actual observations of geological 
phenomena. Special instructions, directions, and suggestions 
should be given to every teacher of this subject to aid him

to carry out this practical and highly motivating part of the 
course* 


General Comment 


The writer believes that the present trend of stress¬ 
ing the generalizations of the High School courses is one of 
the most progressive features of modern educational methods, 
but he would like to point out that this practice carries with 
it certain inherent dangers. Since the term generalization 
is so often incompletely understood, there is a likelihood 
that only one phase of the educative process implied by it will 
be emphasized. To avoid this, teachers must realize that 
learning the generalizations of a course involves on the part 
of the student not only an understanding of the broad principles 
of the course but the development and practice of the art of 
arriving at this understanding through a process of precise 
and cautious reasoning. 

Reasoning, in turn, requires that the child have a 
mastery of a wide variety and a considerable number of the 
right kind of details, since these form the units out of which 
generalizations must grow. 

The first danger, then, is that teachers, while 
stressing the generalizations of a course in high school, may 
not put sufficient emphasis upon the mastery of detail. This 
is particularly true in the case of the science courses.

Failure on the part of the teacher to emphasize the develop¬ 
ment of this aspect of the process of generalization has 
serious consequences, since it leaves the student bewildered 
by an imposing array of shallow generalities acquired chiefly 
by rote memory, but over which he has attained little real 
mastery. 

It is true that a comprehension of the generaliza¬ 
tions of our school courses is one of the primary needs of 
the child for self-direction in a changing society, but it is 
too much to expect that the student can fully realize the aims 
of education by learning generalizations alone. 

The second danger is to be found in the tendency 
among teachers to take it too much for granted that the pro¬ 
per mental attitudes and habits required in the process of 
generalization will develop automatically in High School 
students; and that, once the details of a course have been 
mastered, generalization will inevitably occur* This is not 
only a common, but also a most insidious misconception; and 
it has done much to hinder really effective instruction in 
our schools. If the student is to learn how to generalize 
efficiently he must get instruction and encouragement as well 
as abundant practice in doing so. 

Every teacher should recognize this, and he should 
be willing and able to help his students to develop to the 
fullest possible extent their capacities to reason and to 
generalize.

The need for teachers to be warned against the 
dangers above described, and the belief that care must be 
taken to get the proper perspective toward the teaching of 
generalizations is clearly shown in the following quotation^: 

Education of the intellect is not storing the mind 
with inert forms of knowledge, but providing the child with 
tools of thought, and training him to use them. Education 
must furnish the pupil with a well-selected equipment of pre¬ 
cise and manageable ideas and meanings mainly in the form of 
generalizations applicable to a wide range of situations. 

Some definite information thoroughly mastered is indispensable 
as a basis for thought and intelligent action. The selection 
and orderly presentation of this material is vital. An 
excessive number of facts taught as unrelated items impede the 
grasp of principles. There must be a natural growth from 
knowledge that is fragmentary and casual to that which is 
unified, meaningful, and complete. 

"Skill in thinking comes from the use of one’s 
equipmentcf ideas in solving real problems. Thinking calls 
for deliberation and reflection. Pupils should be given sys¬ 
tematic practice in thinking through significant problems not 
only in the secondary, but in all grades of the elementary 
school". 


Though the purpose of this thesis is primarily to 
discover and present in objective form the various generaliza¬ 
tions of certain science courses of Alberta High Schools, the 
writer feels that the above discussion pertaining to the 
emphasis that should be placed upon each phase of the process 
of generalization should add materially to a better understand¬ 
ing of this concept as it is used in modern educational pro¬ 
cedures.

Criticism of Thesis 


This thesis is composed essentially of two parts. 
First, there are the data of the main investigation, the pur¬ 
pose of which was the selection, organization, and presenta¬ 
tion of the generalizations found in four first-year science 
courses. Secondly, there is a discussion of certain supple¬ 
mentary topics which have been included because they have a 
close bearing on the main topic and are of considerable 
importance to science teachers. These latter include an 
estimation of the learning load, as well as certain opinions, 
criticisms, and suggestions regarding the courses investigated. 

The writer feels that in the first part of this dis¬ 
sertation he has fairly well attained the objective of his 
thesis; but he is keenly aware that, in the supplementary part 
particularly, certain defects respecting both the data and the 
techniques employed have become quite apparent since the thesis 
was completed. In the criticisms which follow, these defects 
will be pointed out, and some remedies suggested. 

First, some criticism may be levelled against the 
technique employed in obtaining the generalizations. These 
were obtained solely by the writer of the thesis and, there¬ 
fore, to some extent at least, the selection and the relative 
importance attached to many of these generalizations must have 
been considerably influenced by his personal judgment and 
opinions. Error due to this personal factor could have been 
considerably reduced had the writer sought the help of a 
large number of other experienced science teachers and used

their judgments as a guide in both the selection and organiza¬ 
tion of the generalizations. Such a procedure would have 
required a greatly increased amount of time, but it would pro¬ 
bably have increased the reliability of the resulting data. 

Secondly, there are a number of defects in the sup¬ 
plementary sections, and though these sections were primarily 
intended to express the conclusions of the author, they could 
have been improved in a number of ways. Thus, in determining 
the "learning load", many modifying factors have not been 
considered. For example, no account has been taken of the 
fact that a large amount of the real learning process may take 
place outside regular school hours, owing to the child’s 
general observation, and collateral reading as well as to his 
association with other children studying the same course. 

This factor, if it could be measured, would have the effect 
of decreasing the learning load. Also, in estimating the 
learning load, no account has been taken of the degree to 
which the items composing the load must be comprehended before 
they are considered to be "learned". The degree of compre¬ 
hension demanded for each item would greatly influence the 
weight of the learning load, but it is a most difficult thing 
to measure objectively. Some sort of standard for learning 
load should be found, and some method of testing the degree 
of comprehension would have to be used in determining this 
standard for each science course. 


In respect to the number and kind of activities,

experiments, equations, laws, etc., which have been listed as 
part of the learning load, the writer realizes that these have 
been rather arbitrarily selected. No specific number of 
these has been set either by the authors of the text book or 
by the Department of Education. The selection, therefore, had 
to be made by the writer of the thesis on the basis of his own 
experience as a teacher of these science courses. This defect 
could have been lessened had the opinions of a large number 
of other science teachers been used to develop a standard. 

Even this standard, however, would be little better than an 
approximation, since the actual number of activities, experi¬ 
ments, etc., are in themselves not a true measure of the real 
learning load. The time consumed and the effort required to 
perform these activities depend in large measure upon the 
environment of the student, the equipment he has available, 
and the help and encouragement given him by his teacher. 

Though the above mentioned defects lessen consider¬ 
ably the value of this dissertation, it is hoped that what has 
been done here will at least serve the purpose of stimulating 
science teachers to further investigations regarding the use 
of generalizations in science education.

that is still needed on the main subject of this investiga¬ 
tion, as well as on certain topics closely related to it. 

In the first place the investigation into the num¬ 
ber and nature of generalizations contained in the first-year 
science courses In Alberta High Schools should b© continued, 
Each of these science courses should be dealt with separately 
and the work should be done by a large number of thoroughly 
experienced teachers well informed of the full meaning of the 
concept of "generalization". The selection of the generaliza¬ 
tions from the text books should be made independently by each 
teacher, but one© this has been accomplished all the indepen¬ 
dently prepared lists should be used to develop a master list 
showing those generalizations found by the majority of the 
investigators. In this way a more accurate list of the 
generalizations from each science course could be obtained. 
Having obtained the master list of generalizations 
for each course, the relative importance of each generaliza¬ 
tion could then be found. One measure of this could be 
obtained by determining the amount of space devoted to each 
generalization by the various text books containing it, A 
measure might also be obtained by finding the number of words 
used to develop each generalization. Another index of their 
relative importance could be found by counting the number of 
practical applications or illustrations used to explain each 
generalization. Still another measure could be secured by 
simply submitting the master list to a large number of ex-

perienced teachers and having them rank the generalizations 
in order of importance. Research such as this should yield 
valuable information on the amount of emphasis which teachers 
believe should be placed upon each generalization in a given 
course. 


Much research is also needed to determine the 
"learning load" presented by each science course. Some of the 
data required could be obtained in a manner similar to that 
mentioned above. But, in addition to this, much direct experi¬ 
mental evidence is needed. A great amount of valuable data 
could be obtained by testing a large number of science students 
to determine: 

1. the average normal reading rate of students 
studying science courses, especially first-year 
science courses. 

2. the average number of readings which students 
must make of the textual material, in order to 
gain comprehension of each generalization as it 
is presented by the text book. 

3. the average number of new unfamiliar words which 
students find it necessary to learn in each 
course. 

4. the average number of the generalizations of 
each course which are found to be completely 
new to the student. 

5. the average amount of time spent by each student 
in doing the necessary exercises, experiments, 
and activities required in each course. 

6. the number of activities, experiments, equations, 
formal definitions, memorized laws, tests, etc. 
which teachers on the average require of a stu¬ 
dent.

Until all this has been done and some sort of cri¬ 
terion for learning load established, no reliable measure can 
be made of the effort which each course demands of the pupil. 

At present, therefore, the teacher is forced to rely upon his 
own judgment and experience to establish a reasonable learning 
load for his class. 

Research should also be made throughout the province 
to determine for each science course the degree to which 
students are mastering the generalisations present in the 
various science courses. Tests for this purpose could be ad¬ 
mins tered at the beginning and at the end of each school year, 
and a record thus obtained of the students* actual mastery of 
the course. Data from such a record should furnish valuable 
information as to the nature of the generalizations mastered; 
the number mastered while taking instruction in the course 
containing them; and the number and kind mastered without the 
aid of formal instruction. Research of this sort would provide 
science teachers with a more accurate picture of their success 
in achieving one of the chief aims of science education. 

Finally, further research is needed to determine the 
validity of the criticism referred to in the introductory 
paragraph of this thesis. It has not yet been proven that the 
first-year science courses of Alberta High Schools are deficient 
in basic generalizations, nor has it been shown that such a 
deficiency, if it did exist, could be remedied by teaching these 
first-year science courses, not as specialized subjects, but

as one course in General Science. Only after these two major 
issues have been resolved by accurate evidence from experi¬ 
mental research, may educators feel sufficiently informed to 
reject or accept with confidence the modern trend of placing 
greater emphasis on the generalizations in the first-year 
science courses.
