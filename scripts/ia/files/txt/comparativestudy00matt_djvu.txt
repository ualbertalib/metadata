CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 
I. THE PROBLEM 

Located close to the population centre of Alberta, 

and separated by the Lacombe School Division, are the County 
of Ponoka and the Red Deer School Division. The County of 
Ponoka has closed-out all but a few of its rural schools 
and these have been replaced by six school centralizations. 

The Red Deer School Division has retained most of its one-room 
rural schools but has a very large centralization in the 
form of the Red Deer Composite High School. Why did these 
two administrative units choose such divergent methods in 
their attempts to solve the educational problems of their 
respective areas? Why does one seem to favor bus transportation 
radiating from several centres while the other apparently 
favors the retention of its rural one-room schools, and the 
operation of one very large centralization served by a 
dormitory rather than school buses? An attempt will be made 
in this investigation to find the answers to these questions. 

II. IMPORTANCE OP STUDY 

Any decision affecting the lives of thousands of children 
is important. Any decision affecting the finances of dozens of 
families is important. ' After interviewing present and past 
members of both divisional boards, it is evident that these 
men did what they thought was right. That is, faced with 
the problem of providing adequate educational facilities

for rural students, and limited in their actions by such 

factors as inadequate revenue, geographic,social and 

population conditions, attitude of people toward new methods 

in education, and teacher shortage, these men pursued policies 

which they believed to be proper for their respective 

areas* If the desirable features of each policy can be 

indicated, if a small degree of superiority of one policy 

over the other becomes apparent, then there will be little 

doubt as to the importance of this investigation® 

The Renney ^report indicates that the problem of 

rural education is not peculiar to central Alberta but is 

a matter of concern to all ten provinces. 

Shall we bring educational facilities to scattered 
rural families, or shall we bring the children to 
centres where the facilities are available? ... What 
are the alternatives? 

1. The small rural school. 

2. The correspondence courses and the radio broadcast. 

3. The itinerant teacher. 

4* The railroad car classroom, the shopmobile, the 
bus classroom, etc® 

5. Transportation to a consolidated school. 

6 . Dormitory accommodation at a consolidated school® 

7# Moving the family to the village or town for the 

benefit of the children. 

Can any of the above choices be made to yield for the 
country child a set of experiences perhaps different in 
nature but equal in value to those offered to the city 
child by a large urban school? There are 20,000 one- 
room rural schools in Canada. Can we assure the parents 
of the children who attend these schools that the best ed¬ 
ucational environment is being provided for their 
boys and girls?

III. DEFINITIONS OF TERMS 


School Division : 

n The Minister, by order, may constitute a division 
consisting of any number of rural public school districts 
not being districts included in a consolidated district." 2 

School divisions are not entirely rural. 

"The board of a division may enter into an agreement 
with the board of any city, town, village, consolidated 
or separate school district for the inclusion of the 
district in the division upon such terms as may be 
agreed upon." 3 

In actual practice, about seventy to one hundred rural public 
school districts, together with the villages and towns in 
such an area, constitute the typical Alberta school division. 

In 1953-54 there were fifty-nine divisions and counties 
operating in Alberta. In this investigation the term applies 
to the Red Deer Division since its formation on December 16, 
1938. The Ponoka School Division, also formed in December of 
1938, became a county in 1952. 

School District ; 

(l) Any portion of the Province, on petition of the 

residents thereof, may be established as a public 
school district, if— 

(a) it does not exceed four miles in length 

or in breadth, exclusive of road allowances; 

(b) it contains,-- 

(i) four persons actually resident 

therein who on the establishment 
of the district would be liable 
to assessment or who hold lands 
under a homestead, cultivation or 
grazing lease, issued under the 
provisions of the PUBLIC LANDS ACT; 
and 


2. The School Act Alberta, 1952, Part I, Section 23, pi 2

( 2 ) 


(ii) eight children not younger than five 
nor older than sixteen years of age; 
(c) the boundaries and name of the proposed 

district have been approved by the Minister. 
In a special case the Minister may permit a 
district to exceed four miles in length or in 
breadth or in both.' 1 4 


Six types of school districts operating in Alberta today 
are city, town, village, rural, consolidated and separate. In 
addition, schools are administered by school divisions and counties. 
In this study, Rimbey, Ponoka, Bowden, Penhold, and -Pelburne 
are examples of districts which have been included within 
divisions. The city of Red Beer and the towns of Sylvan 
Lake and Innisfail operate school districts separate and 
apart from the surrounding school division. 

Composite School : 

’’The composite senior high school combines in its 
program the traditional academic subjects with a wide 
variety of pre-vocational, commercial, technical and 
agricultural electives. This type of school serves the 
needs of those students who intend to proceed to higher 
institutions, as well as those who wish to secure 
employment in business, farming, trades and crafts, 
and those who are destined to become homemakers. A 
typical example of the composite high school is that 
at Red Beer, where, in addition to the full matric- 
ulation program, some sixty additional courses are 
offered from which students may elect those best suited 
to their individual needs and capacities.” 5 

County : 

In Alberta, the county is, in the main, a rural area in 
which school, municipal, and hospital affairs are under a single 
administration. It does not include any town, village, 
consolidated, or separate school district which was not formerly 
within a division but these school districts may be included by 
agreement. The county council appoints not less than three of

its members to serve on each of the municipal, school and 

hospital committees. In addition, towns and villages are 

represented on the school and hospital committees, but the 

majority of the members on any committee must be elected 

6 

members of the county council. The Ponoka school division, 
portions of two municipal districts of the area, and hospitals 
serving the towns of Ponoka and Rimbey, became a county in 1952. 
Municipality : 

n Municipality means any city, town, village, municipal 
district, improvement district or special area.” ' 

In this study the term often refers to the municipal district of 
Red Deer which is eo-terminous with the Red Deer School Division. 

Non-Divisional District : 

”Non-divisional district means a district not 
included in a division.” o 

In this study the term may refer to the school districts within 
the city of Red Deer and the town of Sylvan Lake. 

Rural District : 

’’Rural district means a district, no part of which is 
within the limits of a city, town or village, other 
than a summer village.” 9 

Town District : 

’’Town district means a district, other tnan a consolidated 
district, situated wholly or in part within the limits 
of a town.” 1° 

Village District : 

’’Village district means a district, other than a 
consolidated district, situated wholly or in part 
within the limits of a village, other than a summer 
village.” 11

IV. METHODS USED 

In the course of this study, the County of Ponoka 
and the Bed Deer School Divisions are analyzed and 
compared to determine those forces which have affected 
their development 0 Rather than study each one completely 
and separately, continuous, parallel comparisons are 
used. Because the main differences between the two 
areas are the use of buses and dormitories, those 
forces which aid or hinder the transportation of school 
children and the setting up of dormitories are analyzed® 

A brief history of bus transportation of school 
pupils in the United States, Canada, and Alberta is contained 
within this study, A similar study is made of the use 
of dormitory accommodation. An attempt is made to 
determine the desirable and undesirable features of 
bus transportation and dormitory accommodation. 

Maps are used to show the original rural districts, 
areas which have been centralized, sparsely populated 
areas, rivers, lakes, and roads. The location and 
number of miles of provincial and municipal highways are 
indicated and discussed. The presence of natural points 
for centralization such as towns or villages are studied. 

Maps and tables are constructed showing the racial 
extraction and religions of the people. Indian 
reservations and oommunal-religious settlements are 
indicated and their importance analyzed. 










7 


The nature of agriculture and the presence of other 
industries are observed and studied. The locations of cities, 
towns, and villages in the two areas are explored. The relative 
cost of education in the two divisions and their assessed 
valuations are compared. 

A study is made of those forces which have influenced 
rural educational policies during the past ten to twenty years. 
Those selected for particular study are increasing emphasis 
upon exploratory and vocational courses in schools; V/orld War II 
and its effect upon teacher shortage, scarcity of building 
materials and school buses; and finally the post-war inflationary 
period and its effect upon the availability of teachers for 
Alberta 1 s schools. The age of school buildings and the re¬ 
building policies of school boards are investigated. School 
board minutes and interviews are expected to reveal the official 
attitude of administrative authorities toward the operation of 
one-room rural schools, buses, and dormitories. These sources 
should also indicate board policy toward the inclusion and 
later use of districts as points of centralization,

CHAPTER II 


HISTORICAL FACTORS 

I. BUS TRANSPORTATION SERVING SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES 

The problem of providing educational services for 

rural students has long been an important topic of discussion 

and research. Onerecent writer states: 

”....the worst conditions of educational inequality are 
among rural people.” 1 2 

The same writer points out that since birth rates are higher 
in rural than in urban areas and since teacher shortage is far 
more acute in rural than in urban areas, this problem assumes 
even greater proportions. It is the opinion of E. Hilton that: 

p 

”A good many rural schools are too small.” 

This author explains that in play experiences, learning from other 
students, health services, library facilities, group projects 
and discussions, instruction time, breadth of curriculum, and 
supervision by a school principal, the pupils in a one-teacher rural 
school are at a disadvantage 0 The difficulty in obtaining teachers 
and the low qualifications of these teachers, the low incomes of 
the taxpayers in some rural areas, and the transient nature of 
some agricultural labor further magnify this problem.

Child And His Schools , October, 1954* p.426

”•...1869 may "be taken as the year in which pupil 
transportation began to be regarded as a public rather 
than a private responsibility.”3 

In that year, the state of Massachusettes passed an act allowing 
local areas to tax themselves to pay for the transportation of 
school pupils. Since 1920, motor driven buses have been the 
main means of pupil transportation although railways, boats, 
and some horse-drawn vehicles were still being used in 1940. 

The movement toward consolida.tion proceeded hand-in-hand 
with public transportation. By 1910, twenty-six states 
had passed the necessary enabling legislation abolishing 
district control over education. By 1919* all forty-eight 
states had passed laws providing for both consolidation of 
schools and transportation of pupils at public expense. 

Most writers seem to agree that the trend toward bus 
transportation and consolidation has had some undesirable 
results. Hilton ^ mentions the close relationship between 
pupil and nature in the rural school. He believes that 
the rural student therefore has a better understanding of 
life, is better able to understand the community in which 
he lives than is the urban student. The rural teacher

10 


with a few children of different ages can teach the principles 
of good family life. Also, because the teacher knows every 
family in the district, she can give excellent guidance and 
individualized instruction. 

"Rural divorce rate is lower than the urban rate and the 

insecurity of children from broken homes is found less 

frequently in rural schools than in city classrooms." 5 

Therefore it is sometimes argued that we should try to preserve 
the rural school rather than bring urban ways to the country by 
means of the large, centralized school. Rural life teaches habits 
of industry and co-operation. But the rural student spends a 
great deal of time on the school bus and in sports and other 
activities following the afternoon dismissal of school. He 
therefore spends less time at home and these desirable rural habits 
are not learned. 

M. 0. S. Noble lists some objections to transportation 
and consolidation. Those that apply quite frequently to 
conditions in the province of Alberta are listed below: 

(1) The bad roads and irregular distribution of public 
highways make bus transportation difficult. 

(2) The home school disappears, 

(3) The location of a centralized school causes rivalry 
between districts. 

( 4 ) Pupils cannot be transported comfortably and safely. 

(5) A graded school is not better than an ungraded school. 

( 6 ) Children are not available to "do chores". 

(7) The evil influences are greater when children are 
transported to'a large school, 

( 8 ) Consolidation destroys community life. 

(9) The school is too far away. 

(10) There is social distinction between rural and urban 
pupils.

Educational writers in the United States seem to have 
spent more time in defending consolidation and public trans¬ 
portation of school students than in condemning this trend. 
Writing nearly twenty years ago, A. C. Lambert states: 

"The social, cultural, and occupational horizons of many 
pupils, especially those in junior and senior high schools, 
are changed significantly by their experiences in larger 
schools.” ' 

o 

Dawson and Butterworth point out that consolidation came as 
a natural result of changes in transportation, agricultural 
production, and new educational needs. It is impossible to 
put schools of adequate size within walking distance of every 
student, so the student must be taken to. the school. Whereas the 
rural school usually had more playground area per pupil than the 
centralized school, and the possibility of contacting disease 
was not so great, this is more than offset by the provision 
of gymnasiums, organi z ed sport, physical education, medical 
examination, and immunization programs in larger centres. 
Certainly a richer program of education can be provided by 
several teachers than by one. It is also argued that through 
pupil transportation, the time taken to go to and from school 
is often less than it was when pupils walked, that the pupils 
are better able to do school work because they are not so 
exhausted, and that pupils need not spend the school day in

wet garments as they often had to do in u the good old days". 

Q 

M. C. S. Noble^ lists many advantages of consolidation and 
transportation. Some are given below: 

i l) The enrolments and average daily attendance tend to increase 

2) There is a reduction in truancy and tardiness. 

3) Pupils are stimulated by larger social groups. 

4 ) There is greater opportunity to develop leadership qualities 

5) The curriculum is broader. 

6) The teachers are better qualified. 

7) The school environment is more attractive. 

8) There is increased opportunity for high school education. 

9) The quality of high school education is vastly superior. 

10) There is more supervision by principals. 

(11) The larger schools are better equipped. 

(12) The educational and social level of the community is raisedo 

1 0 

Effie Bathurst says that many of the arguments about 
rural children learning from nature through living with it, 
and also learning through working with father and mother are 
not true today. The rural childhood tasks of the past generation 
such as getting the wood, pumping water, turning the churn, 

and beating the rug are now gone. In their place have come 

11 

"dangerous machinery and exacting scientific procedures”. 

So, the farm boy and girl not only have more time to devote 
to education but they also need instruction in such things 
as home economics, industrial education, farm income tax and 
accounts, and scientific farming. In all of these, the larger 
and more specialized school is better able to give training.

At the same time, buses, roads, safety regulations, and qual¬ 
ifications of drivers have improved tremendously. In this changing 
society the bus has become a principal agent in making the 
educational opportunities of rural students equal to those 
of their cousins in the city. This situation, is so widely 
accepted in the United States today that in 1953 the following 
statement could be made: 

”7,300,000 children ride 120,000 vehicles manned by as 
many bus drivers and maintained by thousands of mechanics 
and s ervi c emen." *1 2 

Table I shows clearly that there are thousands of one-room 

schools still operating in the United States. lor the most part, 

however, and especially in the West, they have been replaced 

by multiple-room schools. Very often it is still a "rural” 

school but is usually village- or town-centred serving a larger 

rural community. The centralization of high school students 

is more complete than the centralization of elementary students, 

but Table I indicates the existence of a great many small high 

schools. Most educational authorities consulted in this study 

favour centralization of even the lower grades. 

"Other things being equal, an elementary school attendance 
unit should have enough children attending a single 1 . 

elementary school to justify at least one teacher to a grade." ^

Julian B* Butterworth, Howard A* Dawson, The Modern Rural School, McGraw-Hill 
Book Co* Inc* New York, 1952, p3$9, data obtained from a census of school-bus 
transportation as reported in Bus Transportation* 



























16 


Table II indicates that bus transportation of school children 
is increasing steadily in the United States. In 1950 there 
were more than seven times as many students transported as 
in 1926. 

II. DORMITORIES SERVING UNITED STATES SCHOOLS 
There seems to be very little literature on dormitory 
facilities in the United States. The information that was 
found, in almost every instance, describes dormitories 

1 A. 

serving colleges and universities. Apparently M. C. S. Noble ^ 
experienced the same difficulty for he quoted a publication 
which was eighteen years old at the time of his writing. 

This quotation is as follows; 


"A bulletin: , imblished in 1922 by the United States 
Bureau of Education, revealed that 225 dormitories had 
been established in connection with public secondary 
schools of twenty-one states. Naturally, such data 
caused many persons to ask: To what extent may dorm¬ 
itory schools be used as a means for providing children 
who live in sparsely settled areas with better educat¬ 
ional opportunities? In answer, it may be said that 
although dormitory schools have served an excellent 
purpose, especially in the Middle Vest and in some of 
the Southern States, it is doubtful in view of the cost 
involved and because of the constant improvement in 
facilities for transportation if any marked increase 
in the need;: for dormitories may be expected.” 


14. Noble, oj3. cit . p.113

This bulletin refers to. public schools. It is probable 
that many dormitories serve the parochial schools of the 
United States but this is outside of the present field of 
investigation. 

III. BUS TRANSPORTATION IN ALBERTA 

To a limited extent, Alberta had horse drawn vans 

serving her early consolidated schools. However, as this 

thesis is concerned with the post-war development of bus 

transportation and centralization, no attempt will be made to 

trace the history of Alberta*s horse-drawn vans. By 1939 

1 5 

the Annual Reports mention a considerable number of motor 

vans serving schools in the southern part of the province. 

The same source, reporting in 1942, indicates that some 

Divisions were served by over twenty vans but that in others 

there were no vans at all. By 1943s 

*'thirty-one Divisions provided regular van service 
for conveying children to school.”^ 0 

In 1944? van service was sponsored by twenty-nine divisions. 

’’School vans vary from horse-drawn vehicles and cars 
carrying as few as three children to large buses-- 
one of which is reported to carry sixty-two pupils. 

.... Lethbridge leads the way with twenty-three ov/ned 
by the division and thirty-four privately owned.”^ ' 

Forty-one divisions used vans in 1945 and forty-seven divisions

sponsored vans in 1946. 

"The general history of transporting pupils is the same 
in nearly all areas. When the plan is originated it is 
none too satisfactory because of lack of co-operation on 
the part of parents, poor roads, lack of suitable buses 
and competent drivers. However, as the project continues 
it becomes more and more satisfactory because parents o 
perceive the educational advantages accruing from it. ,,1tt 

Tables 111(a) to 111(g) inclusive are prepared from the 

Annual Reports of the Department of Education. The data are 

one year old in most cases though not in all. For example, 

the report for 1952 gives the number of buses and the number 

of pupils transported in 1951 but the pupil enrolment as at 

June of 1952. However, the tables are given and analyzed to 

note general rather than specific trends in centralization 

and bus transportation. Therefore no alteration of the data 

was attempted. 

The following observations should be valuable in under¬ 
standing the recent history of bus transportation in Alberta: 

Table Ill(a) 

1 . The Lethbridge School Division consistently led the way 
in number of buses and number of pupils transported. However, 
the Lethbridge Division has a large population and this factor 
has affected the number of buses operating there. The percentage 


18. Ibid ., 1946, p.23

. 

■ 




































« 


• 







» i 


















27 

of pupils transported, sixty-five per cent in 1947 and 
seventy-one per cent in 1954, is also high. 

2. The number of pupils transported in the Macleod School 
Division has been fairly constant. Indeed, it increased 
and then decreased between 1947 and 1954* There were 
usually fewer than twenty pupils per bus which seems to 
indicate small buses and this, in turn, probably indicates a 
sparse population. 

Table 111(b) 

1. Generally the divisions of Central-Eastern Alberta were 
slower than those of Southern Alberta in adopting bus 
transportation, but by 1954 the situations were very similar 
in these two areas. 

2. In the Camrose School Division there was a rapid increase in 
bus transportation between 1947 and 1954* This seems to 
indicate a definite policy favoring bus transportation. 

3. By 1954, Red Deer Valley, Sullivan Lake, and Vermilion 
school divisions were each transporting only about one-third 
of their school populations. 

Table III(c) 

1. Bus transportation started more slowly in Western Alberta 
than in either Southern or Eastern Alberta. By 1954, 
however, the number transported was very similar in all 
three areas. 

. Whereas the pupil enrolments of Southern, Eastern and 


2

28 


Western Alberta were very similar in 1947, by 1954 Western 
Alberta had increased the most and Eastern Alberta the 
least. But even in Eastern Alberta the increase was 
more than fourteen per cent. 

3. The Red Deer School Division transported very few pupils 
from 1947 to 1953, but in 1954 there was a sharp increase 
though still there were but 456 pupils transported. In 
view of what was happening in the divisions of the rest 

of the province, it would seem that the Red Deer Divisional 
Board during the years 1947 to 1953 did not favor pupil 
transportation. No attempt will be made at this time to 
determine the causes of this policy. 

4. The Ponoka School Division seemed to start bus transportation 
very cautiously. By 1950 this division apparently adopted 
bus transportation as a definite policy. In 1954, fifty- 
seven per cent of the pupils were being transported. This 

is slightly higher than in Western Alberta (forty-six per 
cent) and in the entire province (forty-nine per cent). It 
should be mentioned that the presence of large towns ? such as 
Ponoka, within a school division have a great influence 
upon the percentage of pupils who may be transported. 
Generally, very few students are transported from a town 
or village where a centralized school is located. School 
divisions receive transportation grants for transporting 
pupils from school districts other than the one in which

29 


a centralized school is located. Unlike Ponoka, however, 
the city of Red Peer is not included within a school 
division. 

Table 111(d) 

The pattern of development of bus transportation was very 
similar in Northern and Western Alberta. The use of 
school buses increased very rapidly from 1949 through 1954. 
Athabasca, Sturgeon and Lac St. Anne school divisions 
seemed to lead the way in the adoption of school bus 
transportation. Edson, Smoky Lake, Bonnyville, Lac La Biche, 
Thorhild and Coal Branch school divisions waited until quite 
recently (1950-51) before introducing transportation 
on a large scale. 

Table 111(e) 

Peace River, High Prairie and Pairview school divisions 
changed over to the use of school buses at an early date 
whereas Port Vermilion and East Smoky school divisions 
used practically no buses even in 1954* 

Tables 111(f), IIX(g) 

1 . The growth of bus transportation in Alberta has been 
continuous and uniform from 1947 to 1954. Up to 1954 
there was no indication of any decrease in this growth. 

. Bus transportation in Southern Alberta was well developed 
in 1947. Here the number transported by buses

seems to "be leveling off at fifty to fifty-five per cent 
of the total enrolment. 

3• With the exception of the Peace River portion of Alberta, 
all parts of the province tr nsported a similar proportion 
of their total enrolments by 1954- 
IV. DORMITORIES IN ALBERTA 

In 1944* eighteen school divisions pro vided dormitory 

accommodation for 645 Alberta students. The Annual Report of 

the Department of Education for that year states: 

n The Dormitory seems to provide the most acceptable method 
of caring for pupils who must leave home to attend high 

school."*9 

Between 1946 and 1950, the Alberta school divisions made their 
most extensive use of dormitory accommodation. In 1946, twenty-six 
divisions provided such facilities for 1087 students. One 
year later, 1125 students were housed in dormitories. The 
Annual Report of the Department of Education for 1947 contains 
the following statement: 

"The value of dormitories is being recognized and appreciated 
throughout the province as indicated by the fact that year 
by year more students are availing themselves of the 
services... "20 

But the same publication mentions that four dormitories were 
closed that year and that road improvement and increased van 
service accounted for the closing of three of these dormitories. 

The 1950 Annual Report of the Department of Education states: 
"Despite the usefulness of the dormitories, it is doubtful

that many new ones will be opened. The establishment of 
van routes to the centralized schools has made it possible 
for many high school students who would formerly spend 
the week in the dormitory to return home each night.” 21 

In 1952 the number of students using dormitories had dropped 

to 970 and in 1954 the number was further reduced to 715. 

V. BUS TRANSPORTATION AND DORMITORY FACILITIES IN THE 
COUNTY OF P0N0KA AND THE RED DEER SCHOOL DIVISION 

The Ponoka School Division operated a small dormitory at 

Lacombe from 1940 to 1947. In the school year, 1955-1956, 

there were no dormitory accommodations in the County of 

Ponoka. Table IV indicates that more than half of the total 

enrolment was transported on thirty-two buses. Eighty-nine 

per cent of the students attended five centralized schools. 

Beginning in September of 1956 a new centralization, Sylvan 

Heights, was opened in the northern part of the County. Now 

(1956) except for a Hutterite Colony, the only one-room 

schools left are located in the extreme western part of the 

County. Here, road conditions and a sparse, scattered 

population make transportation extremely difficult. 

From 1947 to 1953 the Red Deer School Division was never 

served by more than one bus and the maximum number of 

22 

students transported in one year was fifty-four in 1953.

In 1954, however, eight buses transported 456 pupils and in 

the school year, 1955-1956, twenty-one contracted buses trans- 
ported about 85D pupils. J A very large dormitory, capable 
of housing in excess of 400 students, is in operation at the 
Red Deer Composite High School. Here, the buildings of the 
former A20 Army Camp are part of the school plant. Dormitory 
facilities, office and storage space, auxiliary school rooms, 
some staff residences, and all of .the classrooms for this 
large school were located here from 1947 until 1953. Then a 
new high school building was constructed. Since 1953, except 
for senior high school classroom space, this former army camp 
has continued to provide most of the auxiliary space listed 
above. In addition, it provided classroom space for about two 
hundred students from grade one to nine in 1955-1956. 

VI. SUMMARY OR BUS TRANSPORTATION AND DORMITORY FACILITIES 

For nearly a century, some pupils in the United States 
have been transported to centralized schools. However, as late 
as 1950 there were thousands of one-teacher schools in operation 
there. In Alberta, during and following World War II, there 
has been rapid acceleration in the transportation of school 
pupils. By 1954, about one-half of the students in school 
divisions and counties received this service. Bus service in 
the County of Ponoka was slightly less than the provincial average 


23. Information obtained at the Red Deer School Division office.

until 1950 but by 1954 it was slightly above this average. 

The Red Deer School Division transported very few pupils until 
1953. Since then there has been a sharp increase in the 
extension of this service but still this area is far behind the 
provincial average. 

Very few dormitories serve the public schools of present- 
day United States. During the mid-1940*s, dormitories served 
a considerable portion of Alberta*s school students. However, 
as early as 1950, this type of service was on the decline. 

Since its creation, the Ponoka School Division has provided 
very little dormitory service. By contrast, the Red Deer 
School Division has made extensive use of this method of 
serving its non-city students and today operates a very large 
dormitory at the Red Deer Composite High School.

CHAPTER III 


GEOGRAPHIC AND POPULATION FACTORS 

I. ORIGINAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS 

In late 1938, when the Ponoka School Division was created, 
nearly all of its one-room schools were in operation. These are 
shown on Map 1. There have been several alterations of the 
boundaries of this school division, especially along the south 
where it borders the Lacombe School Division. A major change 
took place in January of 1947 when the Lacombe School Division 
was created, to a large extent out of land formerly within the 
Red Deer and Ponoka divisions. Map 1 shows the sixty three 
districts within the boundaries of the County of Ponoka in 1956. 
The towns of Rimbey and Ponoka operated independent schools for 
several years after the Ponoka School Division was formed. 

Rimbev was included within the Ponoka School Division in 1941 

1 

and Ponoka was included in 1947. 

Map 2 shows the ninety-one school districts included within 
the boundaries of the Red Deer School Division in 1956. There 
have been two major changes affecting the boundaries of this 
division. In 1947 a considerable area in the north became part 
of the newly formed Lacombe School Division, while in 1955 
the Red Deer School Division and the Red Deer Municipality be¬ 
came co-terminous. Sylvan Lake, Delburne and Bowden remained 
independent school districts until quite recently but since

September of 1954 they have all been included in the Red 
Deer School Division. In July of 1956 there were six inde¬ 
pendent districts within this division*s boundaries. They 
were the city of Red Deer, the town of Innisfail, three con¬ 
solidated districts in the east end of the Division—Great 
Bend, Lousana, and Elnora—and the Roman Catholic Separate 
School in Red Deer. During the summer of 1956, Great Bend 
and Elnora will have plebiscites to determine whether their 
areas are to be included within the Red Deer School Division. 

After more than seventeen years of operation the situation 

with respect to independent school districts in the County of 

Ponoka and the Red Deer School Division may be described as 

follows: The County of Ponoka has reduced the number of its 

2 

schools to sixteen. Of these, nine one-room schools operate 
in the extreme west where poor roads, sub-marginal land and 
sparse settlement make bus transportation very difficult. The 
only other one-room school is located at a Hutterite settlement 
where socio-religious factors prevent centralization. All of 
the original independent school districts have been included 
within the administration of the County. There are ninety-one 
districts within the present boundaries of the Red Deer School 
Division. As recently as 1954-55, seventy-one different schools 
operated here. However, in the fall term of 1956, an additional 
seventeen of these buildings are expected to be closed.^ 
Considering that Sylvan Lake has been included since 1954-55,

the total number of schools for the 1956-57 school year will 
be approximately fifty-five. The rate at which rural schools 
have been closed has accelerated greatly since 1953. This fact 
is quite significant, especially when one considers that some 
of these buildings may be among the twenty-nine schools which 
the Division built since 1938. There are still six school 
districts within the boundaries of the Red Deer School Division 
which are not administered by the Division* In the eastern part 
of the Division, thirteen districts were consolidated into four 
districts before the Red Deer School Division was formed, therefore 

r : 

the policies of the Division had nothing to do with this move 
toward centralization. 

II. RIVERS AND BRIDGES, LAKES, SWAMPS 

The purpose of this section of study is to determine to 
what extent nature has aided or hindered bus transportation 
and centralization. Along the entire western side of the 
County of Ponoka Is a vast amount of land which has very little 
agricultural value. Most of the soil in townships three, four 
and five is the gray-wooded variety and its fertility seems to 
decrease as one goes west and north. There is some good farm 
land, especially in the Leedale, Midland, Puller, Lavesta and 
Iola districts, but even here the proportion of swamp and 
heavily timbered land is very great. There is another band of 
hilly, sub-marginal land running north from Gull Lake and 
merging into the first-mentioned area on the northern side of 













41 

the County. So, in the western part of the County of Ponoka, 
the better land lies along the Blindman River. The eastern 
half of the County is largely good agricultural lando^ 

There are two rivers in the County of Ponoka, the 
Blindman River and the Battle River. They are both easily 
bridged and therefore are only minor hindrances to the. trans¬ 
portation of school pupils. However, the hills and swamps of 
the County provide a large portion of the headwaters of these 
rivers and this hinders the operation of school buses. Gull 
Lake tends to divide the County in half but fortunately there 
is considerable populated land between it and Rimbey. The 
hindrance to transportation caused by Gull Lake, Samson Lake 
and Red Deer Lake is reduced considerably by their location 
on the perimeter of the County. 

The Red Deer River is a barrier to transportation. 

Because of its width, few bridges are built across it. School 
buses bringing pupils from the western side of this river to 
such places as Red Deer, Penhold, and Innisfail have only three 
bridges which they can use. However, to the north and east this 
river forms a major part of the boundary of the Red Deer 
School Division and therefore does not hinder transportation 
within the Division. All other rivers, including the Medicine 
and Little Red Deer, are easily bridged. Most of the land with¬ 
in the Division is quite productive. There is an area going

of maps of these areas.

from north-west to south-east through Pine Lake which is 
slightly less productive than the rest. Also, there are 
small areas such as that around Burnt Lake and North Raven 
which are not suitable for grain farming. 

In general, there are natural conditions which hinder 
bus transportation in the Red Deer School Division and in the 
County of Ponoka. In the latter area the sparse population, 
hills and swamps make road construction and bus transportation 
quite costly in some places. In the former area the width a nd 
deep valley of the Red Deer River is a barrier to transportation

Map III and Map IV are enlarged but accurate copies of a 
portion of "Official Road Map of the Province of Alberta, 1956". 
All of the surfaced roads of the County of Ponoka and the Munici 
pal District of Red Deer indicated on the Official Road Map are 
shown on these two maps. By comparing Maps III and IV with 
Tables VI and VII it becomes ppparent that many district roads 
have been omitted from the map. The Official Road Map and the 
Auditor 1 s Statements show the same mileage of provincial high¬ 
ways. 

In the County of Ponoka one group of roads are laterals 
serving the towns of Highway 2. In the west can be seen a 
similar group of roads serving people who wish to go to High¬ 
way 12. The County 1 s largest centralization at Ponoka is well

served by two provincial highways and many district roads. 

Also, the centralizations of Mecca G-len, Rimbey and Bluff ton 
are served by both provincial and district roads. At the 
present time (1956) the district road between Rimbey and 
Ponoka is being improved. This will aid the Crestomere 
centralization. 

The Municipal District of Red Deer is served by five 
provincial highways in addition to her district roads. In 
this municipality the majority of towns are located along 
Highways 2, 11 and 21. That is, the province, at no expense to 
the municipality concerned, provides a considerable portion 
of the potential bus routes.

transportation this table may be simplified as follows:

Table VIII gives a land and water area for this municipality 
of 1,018,425 acres or 1591 square miles* There are approximately 
.6 miles of surfaced roads for every square mile of area. That 
is, the Municipal District of Red Deer has a larger total area, 
a greater population (See Maps VI and VIII), more miles of 
provincial highway but fewer miles of surfaced roads than has 
the County of Ponoka. It does, however, have more miles of im¬ 
proved earth road and a greater total mileage of district roads. 

IV. Population 

The Province of Alberta is divided into seventeen Census 
Divisions (See Map V) but these divisions are much .larger than 
the municipalities. Map V shows that the County of Ponoka and 
the Municipal Districts of Lacombe and Red Deer lie within Census 
Divisions Eight and Nine. As the Pifth Meridian is roughly the 
boundary between these two Census Divisions one would expect Census 
Division Eight to be the more densely populated, for it contains 
such towns and cities as Ponoka, Lacombe, Red Deer and Innisfail. 

A breakdown of the 1951 population into townships was found on a 
map in the office of the Department of Municipal Affairs and it 
v/as use^ to construct Map VI and Map VII. 

Map VI indicates a sparse population in the western and 
north-western parts of the County of Ponoka. The area north of 
Gull Lake also has a light population. There are two areas of 
relatively dense population at Ponoka and Rimbey. The concentration 
of people in the rural area of Ponoka is probably

caused in part by the Mental Hospital located there. The 
populations of Hoadley and Bluffton were not listed separately 
and must be presumed to be included in the rural areas of which 
they are a part. A glance around the boundaries of this map 
reveals several small areas whose population could not be found. 
By adding the numbers given on Map VI the population of the 
present area of the County of Ponoka was slightly more than 
12,092 in 1951. The rural population seems to be 8761 but is 
probably much less than this if the inmates of the Ponoka 
Mental Hospital are included in the rural area about Ponoka. 

A study of Map VII reveals a fairly uniform rural population 
in the Municipal District of Red Deer in 1951. The population is 
somewhat more sparse along a line north-west and south-east of 
Pine Lake. With the exception of the Red Raven area the popu¬ 
lation, unlike that in the County of Ponoka, is as dense in 
the western portions as in any other rural area. The area of 
relatively dense population is in the central part along the 
Canadian Pacific Railway where the city of Red Deer, the town 
of Innisfail and the villages of Penhold and Bowden are located. 
The populations of Elnora, Lousana, Bowden, Dickson, Benalto 
and Markerville were not listed separately. Their populations 
were probably included in the surrounding rural areas. The 
total population of the present area of the Municipal District 
of Red Deer v/as 22,327 in 1951. Ike rural population was 
11 , 981 .

A study of Table IX reveals the following facts: 

1. The County of Ponoka has more areas of sparse population, 

2. The Municipal District of Red Deer has more rural areas of 
relatively dense population. 

3# The Municipal District of Red Deer has more cities, towns 

and villages where the transportation of children is not 

* 

necessary and which are therefore logical centres of 
centralization. 

Through calculation of figures already determined the 
density of population per square mile is easily obtained: 

City, town, village Rural areas 
and rural areas. only _ 

Municipal District of Red Deer 14.0 9.6 

County of Ponoka 7.5 7.0 

Considering density of population only, school buses should 

operate more economically in the Municipal District of Red Deer 

than in the County of Ponoka. In the former district, nearly 

half of the people live in cities, towns and villages and if 

these were made points of centralization there would be no need 

for the transportation of pupils living there. This is especially 

true of pupils in the elementary and junior high school grades. 

Larger buses can be used when pupils live close together. Also, 

in this municipality there are no townships of extremely sparse 

population acting as islands or barriers to the transportation 

of school pupils. 

























56 


V. NATURAL POINTS POR CENTRALIZATION 

Within the boundaries of the County of Ponoka are two 
towns, Ponoka and Rimbey, no villages and several hamlets. 

It is therefore quite logical that Ponoka and Rimbey should 
contain the two largest centralized schools (Table IV, Map VIII). 
Bluffton also has a centralized school but its location is 
probably too close to Rimbey. T he remaining three central¬ 
izations are strictly rural. Crestomere and Mecca G-len are 
located on the principal highways of their respective districts 
(Map III). Because of the width of the County in its western 
portions, a sixth centralized school was opened at Sylvan Heights 
in September of 1956. The only part not served by a centralized 
school is the extreme west and here geographic and economic con¬ 
ditions will probably prevent the establishment of such a school 
for some time to come. Indeed, each year more of these schools 
are closed and the students transported to Rimbey and Bluffton. 

Map IX shows what has been done to develop centralized 
schools in the Red Beer School Division. Before the Division 
was created, four small consolidations were developed at 
Great Bend, Delburne, Lousana and Elnora. Each of these 
places is a logical point of centralization, but unfortunately 
they are rather small for efficient teaching and bus service. 
Because the City of Red Deer has a large population and 
is well served by highways and bridges, it is a focal point 
for probably the largest centralization possible in the 
Red Deer area. Small centralizations have been started at

Sylvan Lake, Markerville, Dickson and Bowden. Innisfail has 
a relatively large town population and is a geographic centre for 
a very large rural area. It is therefore a natural point of 
centralization but so long as it remains an independent school 
district its schools will probably give very limited service 
to the surrounding rural areas. 

VI. RACIAL EXTRACTION, INDIAN RESERVATIONS 

The birthplace of people living in Census Divisions Eight 
and Nine was obtained but no further refinement as to municipalities 
or townships could be found. Table X, therefore, does not show 
any differences between the County of Ponoka and the Red Deer 
School Division but it does indicate what is common to both. 

An overwhelming majority of the people in these two census 
divisions was born in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United 
States. A considerable number were born in Poland, Russia 
and the Scandinavian countries. Most of the racial groups in 
Census Division Eight and Census Division Nine are noted for 
their ability to adapt themselves to new conditions. Indeed, 
the presence in Alberta of a person born outside of Canada indic¬ 
ates considerable adaptability of that person or of his parents. 
Considering racial extraction, there seems to be no reason why 
these people should reject the use of school buses and larger 
school buildings. 

Several Indian reservations are located on the north-east 
side of the County of Ponoka. Fortunately these reservations are 
on the border of the County and therefore do not interfere with 
the transportation of school children. Indeed, one effect of the

reservations was to narrow the County of Ponoka so that all 
the children within this part of the County can be transported 
to Mecca G-len. There are no Indian Reservations within the Red 
Deer School Division. 

VII. RELIGION, COMMUNAL-RELIGIOUS SETTLEMENTS 

A study of Tables XI and XII reveals a close similarity 
between the religious denominations of the Municipal District of 
Red Deer and the County of Ponoka. The only difference worthy 
of mention seems to be a greater proportion of Presbyterians in 
the Municipal District of Red Deer. There appears to be no 
difference great enough to affect the attitude of the people 
toward education. 

Both the County of Ponoka and the Municipal District of Red 
Deer have Hutterite settlements. Both settlements, especially the 
one in the Municipal District of Red Deer, are located some 
distance from the municipal or county border. In this respect 
they are a hindrance to centralization but the effect is similar 
in both the County and the Municipality. 

VIII. SUMMARY 

There are sixty-three school districts within the Coimty of 
Ponoka. When the fall term opened in 1956, there were six 
centralized schools and ten one-room schools in operation there. 
The Red Deer School Division at present contains ninety-one 
districts. During the summer of 1956 it v/as estimated that in the 
school year, 1956-1957, there would be nine centralized schools, 
six independent districts, and forty-six one-room schools 
operating within this division.

There are natural barriers to centralization in both 
administrative units being studied. In the Ponoka County there 
are extensive hill and marsh areas where the population is thin 
and where tax collections are relatively small. This tends to 
make bus transportation expensive. The Red Deer River, because 
it is spanned by few bridges, tends to divide the Red Deer School 
Division into two areas. This is a hindrance to transportation 
and therefore to centralization dependent upon bus service. 

The County of Ponoka has a greater mileage of all-weather 
roads but a smaller area than the Red Deer School Division. 
Therefore a more complete coverage by bus routes can be es¬ 
tablished in the former area. However, the Red Deer School 
Division has more miles of provincial highways than has the 
County. Municipal taxes are not needed for the construction and 
maintenance of these roads. This factor tends to favor bus 
transportation v/ithin the Red Deer School Division. 

The density of population in the Red Deer School Division 
should make centralization relatively less expensive in that 
area. Here, a greater percentage of the people live in cities, 
towns and villages, and the rural population is more dense than in 
the County of Ponoka. 

With respect to racial extraction of people, their re¬ 
ligion, and the presence of communal-religious settlements, 
the County of Ponoka and the Red Deer School Division seem to 
be quite similar. Likewise, the presence of an Indian Res¬ 
ervation forming part of the boundary of the County of Ponoka 
seems to have little effect upon centralization within this area*.

CHAPTER IY 


ECONOMIC PACTORS AFFECTING- CENTRALIZATION 

I. RURAL ECONOMI 

The purpose of this chapter is the examination of rural 
economic conditions in the County of Ponoka and in the Red 
Deer School Division, The nature of the farm population 
with respect to owners, managers and tenants was investigated. 
The relative proportion of improved and unimproved land was 
studied. The value of land, buildings, implements and live¬ 
stock was listed and analyzed. The size of farms, number of 
acres in various field crops, and quantity of livestock and 
poultry were studied. Finally, a study was made of school 
revenue, expenditures and assessment. 

In the study of religious denominations, the total area 
of the four census sub-divisions, Numbers 428, 429? 430, and 
431 was considered to coincide roughly with the map of the 
County of Ponoka. In like manner, sub-divisions 338, 339? 

340, 341 and 371 were considered to be approximately the same 

i 

as the area of the Municipal District of Red Deer. Further 
study based on these same sub-divisions is pursued in this 
chapter. 

Table XIII and Table XIY list farm operators. A 
further analysis of this aspect of farm management is

made in Table XV. The percentage of owners, managers, etc. 
is quite similar in both areas. The County of Ponoka has 
a slightly greater percentage of tenants and part owners. 

Table XIII and Table XIV also indicate the amount of 
improved and unimproved land. In the County of Ponoka, 
three sub-divisions have fifty per cent or less land im¬ 
proved but in the Municipal District of Red Deer only one 
sub-division has so little land improved. Considering all 
of the land, the situation is: 

County of Ponoka 56$ improved p 

Municipal District of Red Deer 6'2fo improved 

The municipal District of Red Deer has six per cent more of 
its land improved than has the County of Ponoka. If we may 
assume that soil fertility is similar in both areas, it is 
probable that the Municipal District of Red Deer has greater 
productivity per acre of land. This in turn means greater 
concentration of agricultural wealth. 

Table XVIII and Table XIX are now examined. In the 
Municipal District of Red Deer the average total value of each 
sub-division is in excess of thirteen million dollars whereas 
in the County of Ponoka the average value is about eight 
million dollars. Even though census sub-division 428 is some¬ 
what small because of an Indian Reservation, there is greater 
value per acre in Red Deer*s rural area than in Ponoka*s. 
However, since the former is more thickly populated, 
this concentration of agricultural wealth may not be

too significant. That is, as the school population in¬ 
creases so will the cost of education increase. 

Farm population in relation to farm wealth is examined 
in Table XVI. Wealth per person in the Municipal District 
of Red Deer seems to be greater than in the County of 
Ponoka. If we may assume that both areas have the same 
proportion of school children per family, then it would seem 
that the rural population in the Municipal District of Red 
Deer is the better able financially to provide for the edu¬ 
cation of their children. 

Table XVIII and Table XIX also indicate the size of 
farms. This information for the two areas is summarized 
in Table XVII. 

The size of farm is very similar in the County of 
Ponoka and in the Municipal District of Red Deer. Red Deer 
seems to have a slightly higher percentage of farms from one 
to two quarter sections in size whereas Ponoka has a greater 
percentage from a half to a full section in size. Also, 
the Municipal District of Red Deer has a higher percentage 
of the very large farms, two sections and larger. 

Table XX and Table XXI list the livestock found in 
the census sub-divisions of the County of Ponoka and the 
Municipal District of Red Deer. The number of horses is 
similar in each of these areas and this indicates that 
there is a similar change-over to tractor-operated farms 















70 


in both areas. The Municipal District of Red Deer seems 
to have far more cattle per census sub-division than has 
the County of Ponoka. Among other things, the number of 
livestock such as cattle indicates the productivity of 
the land per acre. The number of milch cows per census 
sub-division is about the same throughout the County and the 
Municipality, The number of beef cattle is much larger in 
the Municipal District of Red Deer than in the County of 
Ponoka. The Red Deer area has more swine per sub-division 
than has the Ponoka area. This indicates greater wealth 
and greater productivity per acre in the former area. 

The Municipal District of Red Deer has more acres of 
wheat per given area than does the County of Ponoka. This 
is to be expected as the former area contains more prairie 
wheat land than does the latter. However, the Municipality 
also exceeds the County in acres of barley, oats and of 
cultivated hay land. 

The rural economy of the Municipal District of Red 
Deer and the County of Ponoka may be summarized. Those 
items pertinent to this study are listed below. The Red 
Deer area exceeds the County ins 

1. Proportion of owner-operated farms. 

2. Proportion of improved land. 

3. Value per acre of land. 

4. Value of farm property per capita. 







71 


Most of the above statements seem to indicate that there 
is a more prosperous rural economy in the Municipal District of 
Red Deer than in the County of Ponoka. If this be true, more 
money per pupil should be available for education in the former 
area, 

IIo SCHOOL REVENUE 

Table XXII and Table XXIII indicate that from 1947 to 
1949 the County of Ponoka (School Committee) received higher 
grants than did the Red Deer School Division, but from 1950 to 
1954 Red Deer received the higher grants. Also, grants per 
pupil were greater for Red Deer from 1950 to 1954. The larger 
grants for Red Deer in 1953 were caused, in part, by a capital 
grant of $121,617.54* The total requisition of the County of 
Ponoka is higher than the one for the Red Deer School Division 
for every year from 1947 to 1954. This is also true of the 
requisition per pupil.^ This means that the taxpayers of the 
Red Deer area pay less per pupil for education than do the 
taxpayers of the Ponoka area. G-rants and requisitions xaake 
up nearly all of the revenue of the County of Ponoka. However, 
from 1949 to 1954 the Red Deer School Division received large 
suras classified as "Other Revenue" <> This is probably caused, 
in part, by the large amount paid in tuition and board at the 
Red Deer Composite High School.

III. SCHOOL EXPENDITURES: 

Table XXYII and Table XXVIII indicate that in the 
years 1947 to 1952 tne cost of administration was less 
for the County of Ponoka than for the Red Deer School 
Division. But in 1953 and 1954 the County system of ad¬ 
ministration seems to have been more expensive. Teachers 1 
salaries are similar for the two area and they are closely 
related to the number of classrooms operated. The cost of 

plant operation per classroom is greater in the case of 
5 

Red Deer. Apparently fuel, light, janitor services, etc. 
are less expensive in multi-roomed schools than in one-room 
schools. The Red Deer School Division paid very little for 
transportation from 1947 to 1952. In recent years the 
County of Ponoka has paid more in debt charges than has the 
Red Deer School Division. This seems to suggest a more 
cautious financial policy in the case of the School Division. 

The Red Deer School Division pays considerably more per 
child for educating its children than does the County of Ponoka*^ 
Hov/ever, this includes the heavy cost of operating a large 
dormitory and the Composite High School. Much of this is 
repaid in the form of payments for board and room, and 
tuition from non-divisional students.

IV. SCHOOL ASSESSMENT 

A study of Table XXIX shows that the County of Ponoka 

had a higher assessment and a higher rate of taxation from 

1948 to 1954 than had the Red Deer School Division. The 

difference in assessment seems hard to understand in view 

of Red Deer's larger and more wealthy rural area. However, 

up until 1954 the Red Deer School Division contained very 

few towns and villages* The City of Red Deer, and the towns 

of Innisfail, Bowden, Sylvan Lake, and Delburne were not 

within the Division then. But the towns of Ponoka and 

Rimbey are included within the County of Ponoka and their 

assessments in December, 1954* were: 

Ponoka 12,951,379 

Rimbey 712,093 

177^37472 

That is, the assessed valuation of the rural portions of 
the County of Ponoka and the Red Deer School Division are 
about the same. The rate of taxation has been from two to 
seven mills higher in the County than in the Municipality.

CHAPTER V 


EDUCATIONAL FACTORS AFFECTING CENTRALIZATION 

I. CURRICULUM CHANGES 

In the late 1930*s increased emphasis was placed upon the 
teaching of commercial subjects. Teachers of Grade IX were 
expected to obtain qualifications to give school instruction 
in typewriting and bookkeeping. These subjects were taught, 
after a fashion, in one-room and two-room schools. However, 
in these subjects as in all others, the teacher was with a 
class for very short and infrequent periods. Also, the 
typewriter, for there was usually but one of them, contributed 
its noise in opposition to the teacher*s lessons and the 
pupils* recitations. 

In general, most rural students together with those in 
villages and small towns were unable to take instruction in 
the commercial, industrial arts, and home economics subjects 
until the centralized school made its appearance. Only then 
were there enough students in one building to justify the 
operation of special rooms for these subjects. Although 
typewriting and bookkeeping can be taught in a two-room school, 
it is very difficult to give instruction in shop-and home 
economics in such a small school. For instance, it is difficult 
to teach home economics without a sewing machine and a stove. 
Also, it is difficult to find teachers in a two-room school 
whose education is so diversified that they can teach such a 
variety of subjects. If they do have legal permission to

teach them there is still not much room for specialization. 

The increased emphasis upon more practical, exploratory 
subjects is only a partial reason for centralization. Other 
arguments based upon the educational advantages of large 
schools were given in Chapter II of this study. Probably 
the most important arguments are the demands that rural children 
should have educational and sociological opportunities equal 
to those of urban children. 

II. TEACHER SHORTAGE 

Shortly after the Province started the formation of 

larger units of administration, World War II broke out. In 

assessing the effects of total war one is apt to give so 

much emphasis to loss of life and property, war debts, and 

increased employment, that the less spectacular results are 

forgotten. Two succeeding generations of school children 

have been affected, largely adversely, by two world wars: 

"The armed forces, Government work, and war 
industries have continued to draw heavily on 
Alberta*s teaching personnel during 1942.... 

In general, Divisions have met the teacher 
shortage by one ore more of the following 
expedients: 

(a) Taking back into service married teachers 
v/hose certificates may or may not have 
lapsed during their years out of classrooms. 

(b) Providing children with conveyance to a 
nearby operating school. 

( c) Student-teacher placements,|w 
(d) Correspondence courses." ' '

Province of Alberta for 1942, printed by A. Shnitka,

The important result, for this study, is the conveyance 

of children. Very often, especially in the prairie portions 

of Alberta, the enrolment in rural schools was as low as 

eight to twelve pupils. If sufficient numbers of teachers 

could not be obtained by a school division, one solution 

might be the opening of four or five additional rooms 

in a town and the closing of seven or eight rural schools. 

Thus two thirty-pupil rooms may replace five twelve-pupil 

schools. This means a saving of three teachers and probably 

a gain in the quality of instruction: 

"Other things being equal, an elementary school 
attendance unit should have enough children 
attending a single elementary school to justify 
at least one teacher to a grade with a ratio 
of about thirty pupils per teacher; and a 
high school attendance unit should have 
enough children attending a single high school 
to justify the employment of at least ten 
teachers." 2 

In part, the problem of teacher shortage is a result 

of V/orld War II. In 1944: 

"only nine divisions had complete staffs on October 
first and the number of teachers of low qualification 
engaged were greatly out of proportion." J 

Under such circumstances divisional boards v/ere forced to 

adopt various expedients to provide educational services: 

"The centralization of schools has been a par¬ 
ticularly satisfactory method of relieving the 
shortage 0 It has been effected by building

additional rooms to existing plants, 
by the moving of schools to new sites, 
and by the transportation of pupils to 
the centres by means of vans and buses. 

In such instances the benefits in im¬ 
proved services have been pleasingly 
satisfactory.” W 

That is, teacher shortage and low teacher qualifications 
were partly responsible for the adoption of centralization 
by many school divisions at a time when it was abnormally 
difficult to obtain building materials and transportation 
facilities. Then, although teacher qualifications remained 
much as they had been or even deteriorated, teaching services 
improved with centralization. 

By 19*+7, teacher shortage was still a foremost problem 
in Alberta i 

,5 At the end of the year there were reported 
24 schools with no service, 2b operating 
under unsatisfactory makeshift co-operative 
arrangements, 489 under correspondence course 
supervisors (uncertificated persons) and 180 /c\ 

under teachers holding Letters of Authority. 11 

That is, two years after the conclusion of World War II, when 

some veterans were returning to the teaching profession and 

others were completing additional university training, the 

problem of teacher shortage was still very acute. 

In 1949 there were not enough teachers for Alberta 1 s 
schools. One significant observation is pertinent to this 
study 2

"The.Superintendents invariably reported little 
difficulty in obtaining well qualified teachers 
for graded classrooms in centralized schools. 

The aversion to rural schools, however, con¬ 
tinued to increase and Superintendents generally 
appear convinced that centralization offers the 
only satisfactory solution to this problem." 6 

Apparently during both the War and Post-war period the 

difficulty of obtaining teachers for country, one-room 

schools forced school divisions to centralize. This trend 

continued in 1951: 

"the factor of isolation was thus a major consider¬ 
ation in determining teacher supply. as far 

as the rural area is concerned little improvement 
was indicated." 7 

Similar statements may be found in the 1952 and 1953 reports 

of the Department of Education: 

"Since many of the recent graduates now go directly 
to city, town, or centralized schools, very few 
beginning teachers are available for rural schools."8 

Finally, in 1955, the last year for which statistics are 

available for this study, teacher shortage seemed less 

critical. Also, the centralization of schools and the closing 

of rural schools were listed as factors which made more 

teachers available. ^ 

Teacher shortage became acute in the early years of 
World War II. However, ten years after this conflict had 
ended there were not enough teachers for Alberta 1 s schools. 
Both in the War and Post-War period, school divisions

adopted centralization to combat teacher shortage and to 
improve instruction and the social development of pupils. 

IV. RETENTION OP SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS 

The senior high school enrolment for the County of 
Ponoka in 1955-56 is given in Table XXXI. The first column 
indicates that 113 pupils would have had high school facilities 
even if the larger units of administration had never been 
introduced. Two hundred seventeen pupils are from districts 
which did not have adequate high school facilities until 
centralization was begun. Por the most part, they are now 
transported to the five centralized schools. The table also 
indicates that approximately two and one-half per cent of the 
rural 1951 population or eight per cent of the total school 
enrolment is receiving a senior high school education. 

Table XXXII shows 274 pupils from the rural portions of 
the Red Leer School Division taking senior high school in¬ 
struction within the Division in 1955-56. This is approximately 
two and one-third per cent of the rural 1951 population or 
nine per cent of the total school enrolment. 

In the school year 1955-56 there seemed to be little 
difference between the County of Ponoka and the Red Deer 
School Division in the proportion of rural students taking 
high school instruction. Unfortunately, data could not be 
obtained for 1953 or earlier when the Red Deer School Division 
was offering very little school transportation.

V. DISTRIBUTION OF CLASSROOMS 

Table XXXIII indicates that since 1946-47 the number 
of elementary rooms in the County of Ponoka has increased 
as the number of rooms giving instruction in both elementary 
and junior high school grades has decreased. This, of course, 
is a direct result of the closing of the rural one-room 
schools. Also, rooms used solely for junior high school, 
and for senior high school have steadily increased in number. 
The average number of students in a single classroom has 
shown a steady increase from eighteen to twenty-eight. 

Table XXXIV indicates that the number of rooms giving 
instruction from grade one to nine has actually increased 
in the Red Deer School Division from 194^-47 to 1954-55. 

The number of elementary rooms did not change greatly until 
1953-54 and at the same time the number of junior high school 
rooms started to increase. There were practically no rooms 
giving instruction solely in the senior high school grades 
until 1947-48 and then, with the opening of the Composite 
High School, the number of such rooms increased greatly. The 
average enrolment per room has also increased but not so 
greatly as in the County of Ponoka. The country one-room 
classrooms have fewer pupils per room than have centralized 
rooms. 

VI. ADHINISTRATIOK--BOAHD POLICY AT PONOKA 10 
Relatively few one-room rural schools were constructed by 

Yol Data for this sub-section were obtained from the minutes 
of meetings held by the Ponoka School Division and by the 
School Committee of the County of Ponoka.

the Ponoka School Division and none was built by the County 
of Ponoka, The minutes of the Ponoka School Division indicate 
that seven new schools were constructed at Midland, Eastside, 
Hobbema, Lonesome Pine, Schultz, Lincoln, and Hoadley. Also, 
a school was renovated at the Ferrybank Hutterite colony but 
both labor and money were supplied by that colony. Lack of 
finance and building materials probably dictated such a policy. 
It is doubtful whether the board members during the first few 
years of the Division*s operation could foresee the time when 
nearly all of these schools would be closed. In any case the 
spending of relatively little money on such buildings was a 
sensible policy though very few realized this at the time. 

There was little or no capital loss on the Hobbema and 
Schultz schools for they were sold to the Federal Government 
for use on Indian Reservations. The Hoadley school is still 
in operation. 

The Ponoka School Division decided to operate a dormitory 
at Lacombe in 1940. A building was bought and furnished and 
it served the needs of a limited number of students until 
the building was sold to the newly organized Lacombe School 
Division in 194? for the sum of $4,760. In February of 1941 
a plan was started whereby if the Rimbey school district were 
included within the Division, a three-room high school would 
be built there. This building was to have a second story which 
would serve as a dormitory. This plan must have been abandoned, 









105 


for in May ol 194-1 the board decided to build a two-room 
addition with full basement. There is no record of any plans 
to construct a dormitory at Ponoka. It seems to have been 
the policy of the Ponoka School Division to spend very little 
money on the construction and operation of dormitories. In 
view of the number of dormitories in Alberta which have been 
closed in recent years, this policy proved to be a sound one. 

The town of Ponoka and the village of Rimbey were the 
only places within the Ponoka School Division where inclusion 
could take place. This was especially true after the town of 
Lacombe became the administrative centre of the newly formed 
Lacombe School Division. 

The first place to be included was the village of Rimbey. 

On January 7? 1941, the minutes of the Ponoka School Division 
read as follows: ”A delegation from Rimbey was heard re. the 

( 11 ) 

possibility of the Rimbey School District entering the Division. M 
Then on February 4, 1941, a motion was made by a divisional 
member that if Rimbey should be included, a three-room high 
school with a second story for dormitory purposes would be 
constructed at Rimbey. Also, the Village of Rimbey was to 
pay $ 2 , 500 . annually and if this was more than the cost of 
operation the surplus was to be used to reduce the debenture on 
the present Rimbey building. On April 1, 1941, a motion was 
passed to the effect that if Rimbey came into the Division and 
if the necessary money could be raised that the Division would

proceed with the building at Rimbey. However, on May 6, 

1941 , a motion was passed: 

"that we proceed toward the construction of a two- 
room addition, with full basement to the Rimbey 
school this year."12 

That is, toward the end of the 1940-41 school year Rimbey 
was included within the Ponoka School Division, This 
inclusion required co-operation and understanding by the 
Rimbey School Board and the Ponoka School Division, There 
seemed to be a need for additional classrooms at Rimbey. 

The local board approached the divisional board as to what 
the latter authority was prepared to do if inclusion took place. 
The Division was prepared to build at Rimbey to the extent 
of its financial ability. The Division at first promised 
a three-room school and dormitory but eventually built a 
two-room addition and full basement. 

It was more difficult to negotiate the inclusion of 
the town of Ponoka than the village of Rimbey. In September 
of 1945 it was necessary for the Division to make an agree¬ 
ment with the town of Ponoka to operate a high school room 
for divisional students. On October 2, 1945, a motion 
was passed: 

"that the application of Lacombe School District 
to enter the Ponoka School Division be accepted..." 

It is noteworthy that this motion was amended to read: 

"and provided further, that a general sentiment 
throughout the Division favors such a move."13 

This amendment was lost.

This suggests that the Divisional Board, as representatives 

of the people, gave leadership and was prepared to take the 

consequences. On November 6 , 1945: 

"Mr. Frame, Director of School Administration, was 
heard re. the Lacombe agreement."1 4 

Then on December 4 , 1945, a meeting was held with board 

members of the Ponoka School District to discuss the 

inclusion of the Ponoka town school. On January 4, 1946, the 

applications of Ponoka and Lacombe to enter the Division 

were tabled because of possible changes in the boundaries of 

the school division. In other words, if a school division 

were to be created centred at Lacombe, it would be unwise 

to proceed with the inclusion of the town of Lacombe within 

the Ponoka School Division. 

The minutes do not indicate any negotiations between the 

Ponoka school board and the Division from December 4 , 1945, 

to August 30, 1946. On April 2, 1946, the application of 

the Ponoka School District was: 

"Taken off the table and accepted provided a satisfactory 
agreement can be reached.” 15 

Then in August, 1946, when the problem of getting enough 

teachers and classrooms for school pupils again confronted 

the Ponoka School Division and District, negotiations were 

pursued. On August 30, 1946: 

"Mr. Balfour, Director of School Administration, who 
was present, outlined a plan whereby inclusion could be 
effected in a manner which would be fair to both bodies and 
within the regulations of the School Act ."' 6

However, additional buildings were needed at the Ponoka 

school and apparently the Division was not prepared to 

provide these buildings, either through lack of finance or 

materials. One member from the Ponoka District Board: 

"stated that until such time as it is possible to 
build suitable facilities, they were not interested."'' 

Another member: 

"argued that Ponoka could provide her own facilities, 
that they did not need the co-operation of the Division 
and suggested that each provide its own facilities. n1 ° 

The reply from the Division was to the effect that the 

educational needs of the Ponoka area could not be met in a 

satisfactory manner by duplication of services by the two 

bodies. A third member of the Ponoka District Board asked 

Mr. Balfour to draw up a sample agreement for inclusion and 

to submit this to the Ponoka District Board for study. 

No more negotiations on inclusion of the town of 

Ponoka took place until a special meeting was called on 

March 24, 1947. Mr. Balfour attended this meeting also and: 

"outlined the terms of agreement which would be in 
accordance with the provisions of the School Act. 

All provisions of the agreement seemed to be 
satisfactory to both sides except that setting forth 
the means of arriving at the amount of additional 
requisition upon the Town district ." 1 9 

Mr. Balfour f -s suggestion on this point was finally accepted by

the Divisional Board. It must be assumed that inclusion 
took place shortly after the March meeting for no further 
mention is made of any meetings between the Ponoka District 
and Divisional boards. 

Agreements between two administrative bodies which are 
equally autonomous are reached when they are equally satis¬ 
factory to both of them. Also, it is easier to reach such 
agreements when the organization which is voting itself 
out of existence gets something desirable which it would 
not otherwise have had. 

The first bus route mentioned in the Ponoka School 
Division minutes was from Forshee to Rimbey. There was no 
school at Forshee but it was on Number 12 Highway and parts 
of the Rimbey, Wooddale, Symonds and Chapel districts could 
be served by this route. At the June 5? 19^ meeting the 
Divisional Board decided to open this bus route. This route 
operated for over a year before any mention is made in the 
minutes of any additional bus services. Then, at the 
October 1, 19^6 meeting a committee was formed to arrange 
a bus route to transport the George School District pupils 
to Mirror. At the same meeting the Board passed a motion 
requesting the Municipal District of Last West to gravel 
three miles of road for part of a bus route in the country 
west of Rimbey. 

Private buses and cars were used in the Division’s 
first experimental routes. At the December 3 5 19^6 meeting

it was decided to send a truck chassis to Calgary where 
a bus body could be added. This is an indication of the 
many problems which had to be solved before centralization 
could be introduced. At this time, Ponoka started to 
purchase and operate its own buses as finances, road conditions, 
and popular demand warranted such a policy. 

It is not necessary to mention all the schools that 
were closed with students transported to one of the six 
centralized schools. The pattern is very similar in all 
of them. The poor condition of the rural school and inability 
to get competent teachers led to requests by the people to 
have their children transported to some other school. As 
far as the School Division was concerned, lack of finance 
and poor roads made it impossible at times for them to 
supply bus transportation as rapidly as it was demanded 
by the people. 

Rural centralization and bus transportation are inter¬ 
dependent. Centralization began as soon as buses started 
to bring students, first to Rimbey and then to Ponoka and 
Bluffton. However, in addition to these three points of 
centralization where schools had operated even before 
buses were used, the Ponoka School Division created two 
more rural centralizations and the County of Ponoka one 
more. 

On April 5, 1948: 

’’the board was interviewed in regard to the proposed 

centralization out East.”20 

At the same meeting a delegation from the Wilmot School

District asked for a two-room school. Within a few years 
centralized schools were established in these two areas. 

They were named Mecca Glen and Crestomere. 

Another centralization was opened for the fall term 
of 1956 at Sylvan Heights. Here, in the northern part of 
the Division, is a group of school districts too far away 
to be served by Bluffton and Crestomere. The reasons for 
establishing this centralization are summarized in a 
petition sent to the School Committee of the County of 
Ponoka on April 12, 1955* 

"We, the undersigned ratepayers of Homeglen, 

Lonesome Pine, Lundgren, Halfway Grove, 
and Glenfalloch, request that a centralized 
school be built in or about this area for 
the following reasons: (1) Crestomere needs 
more room (2) need for high school education 
(3) shorten present bus routes, (4) local 
schools very poor, (5) difficulties in ob¬ 
taining teachers for small schools. 11 (21) 

If new one-room schools had been built in the Ponoka 
rural districts, if competent teachers in sufficient quantity 
had been induced to go to the rural one-room schools, and if 
educational needs and methods had not changed greatly in the 
past two decades, bus transportation and rural centralization 
would not have come to the County of Ponoka. But these changes 
did occur. The industrial revolution is continually affecting 
rural Alberta. Therefore these new patterns and methods in 
education should come in the wake of our changing economy.

VII, ADMINISTRATION—BOARD POLICY AT RED DEER 22 
In the Red Deer School Division many one-room rural 
schools were constructed. Table XXXV indicates that a 
total of twenty-nine new schools were constructed although 
we may assume that the three fire replacements were covered 
by insurance. This table is constructed from the minutes of 
the Red Deer School Division and checked by administrative 
officials who have been associated with this Division. All 
doubtful cases were deleted. 

Table XXXVI gives a rough comparison of the ages of the 
one-roora schools when the two school divisions were formed. 

The district numbers and the ages of these districts vary 
inversely to each other. Furthermore, a vast majority of the 
first schools ever to be constructed in the districts were in 
operation when the school divisions were created. A glance 
at this table reveals that the average age of the schools in 
the Red Deer School Division was somewhat greater than that of 
the County of Ponoka. This no doubt in part accounts for the 
construction of so many new schools within the Red Deer School 
Division. 

During its first year of operation eleven delegations 
waited upon the Red Deer School Division requesting new 
schools. This demand continued unabated through the following 
thirteen years. On February 7, 1942, a motion was passed 
to the effect that: 

"no new school buildings be created for the 
duration of the war, except in cases of very 

22. Data for this sub-section were obtained from the 

minutes of meetings held by the Red Deer School Division.

urgent, and absolute necessity, when such 
situation would be inspected and reviewed 
by at least three members of the Divisional 
board**. (23) 

But in 1943 five schools were being built within the 
Division and on April 13 , 1945, before the War ended, the 
Buildings Replacement Committee had decided that five 
schools would be built that year. Also as late as 1953 
most of the rural children in grades one to eight were still 
attending rural schools for in that year onfcr fifty-four pupils 
were being transported and only one bus was being used. 

(Table IIIC) 

The Red Deer School Division operated several two-room 
schools. Such an arrangement allows a great many children to 
go as high as Grade X in their own rural schools but the 
country population is not sufficiently dense nor stable to 
permit an uninterrupted operation of such a school. For 
example, Shady Nook operated a High School from 1939 to 1943. 
Then there was a greater school population in the Poplar 
Ridge district just north of Shady Nook so a two-room school 
operated here until September of 1946 when the senior room 
at Shady Nook was re-opened. Eventually both districts were 
operating one-room schools. Much the same situation developed 
at Calder, Loyalty and Little Red Deer. The economic waste 
was lessened somewhat through the use of a basement as the 
second classroom in some places such as Poplar Ridge. 

To summarize, there are several reasons why so many

one-room schools were built by the Red Deer School Division,, 

Many of the original one-room schools were very old, draughty, 
and some were unsafe. The demand for new schools was not 
lessened through the use of buses until 1954. Until 1954, 
there was little centralization except at the City of Red Deer. 

The Red Deer School Division has been and still is noted 
for its use of dormitory accommodation for nigh school 
students. The Red Deer Dormitory started operating in the 
fall of 1939 in St. Luke’s Anglican Parish Hall. In the same 
years 

’’permission was granted to place a dormitory room at the 
Loyalty school, all equipment for same....to be paid 
for and taken care of by the students themselves.” 2 4 

There was considerable controversy for some time as to whether 

the Parish Hall should be bought or rented. The minutes seem 

to indicate that it was bought in the summer of 1940. The 

dormitory continued to function in this building until the 

A20 Army Camp was obtained in 1947 for Composite High School 

purposes. Here there is ample accommodation for a very 

large school dormitory<> 

Another difference between the Red Deer and Ponoka divisions 
concerns inclusion of city, town, village and consolidated 
districts. At Red Deer the rate of inclusion was slow and 
in 1956 was incomplete. At Ponoka it was relatively

rapid and is now complete. However, Ponoka had but two places 
to add to the divisional administrative authority while Red 
Deer had ten. In the latter area, as the boundaries are today, 
were four consolidated school districts in the far east, two 
village school districts (Bowden and Penhold) two town 
school districts (Innisfail and Sylvan Lake) the city 
school district of Red Deer and a Roman Catholic separate 
school district. Each of these continued to have the right 
to administer its own school affairs after the formation of 
the Red Deer School Division. 

Blackfalds was included within the Red Deer School 
Division in 1944» However, when the Lacombe School Division 
was formed, Blackfalds became part of it. In this first 
inclusion we should note: 

“that the Division would take them over, on the distinct 
understanding that taxes would be raised from the 
Blackfalds district to cover their needs, but that no 
tax revenue derived from the rural schools would be 
used for this purpose."25 

In the inclusions of Rimbey and Ponoka there were long 
deliberations as to what would be fair to both sides but 
there was no intimation that they would be financed separately 
and apart from the rest of the Division. 

There was the same pressure for co-operation between 
the Red Deer School Division and school districts as there 
was at Ponoka. At one public meeting the superintendent: 

“explained that the high schools of Lacombe, Sylvan Lake,

Innisfail and Red Deer were filled and in some cases 
students were being declined admittance."26 

There was also some desire for centralization, for at another 

meeting the superintendent explained the disadvantages of 

the small country high school and a motion was passed: 

"that the Divisional Board investigate the possibility 
of forming small consolidated schools by closing down 
four or five of the one-room rural schools."27 

This motion was voted down seven to six but nine did not 

vote at all. It would seem that if the Divisional Board 

had taken a definite stand in favour of centralization, 

many of the people "would have followed its leadership. But 

it is quite evident that the Divisional Board was not in 

favor of centralization, especially of lower grades. The 

superintendent: 

"stated that the policy of the divisional board has 
been against centralization except for high school 
level."2^ 

As late as 1954 a delegation from Knee Hill Valley, rep¬ 
resenting six rural schools asked for a centralized school 
served by buses. But this delegation: 

"was advised that the Board would centralize if forced 
to through circumstances or if requested by ratepayers." 29 
t 

A secret ballot was taken in these districts and the vote was 
107 for, and 92 against centralization. 

A lack of positive leadership by the Divisional Board 
is found in the transportation of school pupils within

the Red Deer School Division. In 1946 a delegation from the 

Mount Pleasant School District wanted an additional school 

because some of the pupils went more than four miles to 

school. But the Divisional Board suggested: 

n the parties interested get together and investigate 
transportation possibilities, and again meet the board 
at a later date..."30 

As late as 1955 the building committee investigated the 

possibility of constructing a new school at Hillend for: 

"there will be a large school population for years to 
come with no roads for centralization;" 31 

but the western side of the Hillend School District is but 

five miles from the Calgary-Edmonton Highway. The Divisional 

minutes do not record any request for gravel on bus routes 

until 1953? but in 1946 the Ponoka Divisional Board made such 

a request® 

The Red Deer Divisional School Board, until recently, 
has not favored bus transportation of school pupils, has 
not favored centralization except of students from Grade Nine 
to Grade Twelve, and has not encouraged inclusion of town 
and other school districts. The main reason why it started 
to close its one-room schools after 1953 was its inability to 
get teachers for its rural schools. On July 17, 1953? 
the superintendent of the Red Deer School Division reported 
that seventeen rural schools were vacant. On July 7, 1955? 
their superintendent reported as follows:

VIII. SUMMARY 

If the material requirements of high school students 
were confined to textbooks, notebooks, pen, and pencil, 
one teacher could give instruction in many grades. However, 
if some subjects demand the use of typewriters, sewing machines, 
cookstoves, as well as carpenters* hand and power tools, it is 
physically impossible and economically unsound to have all of 
these materials within one room. Also, manual subjects re¬ 
quire such a diversity of skills that it would be very difficult 
to find such teachers for our many one-room schools. Curriculum 
changes encouraged the centralization of rural schools. 

During the War and Post-War periods, the demand for 
labor has caused many people to leave the teaching profession. 
For more than fifteen years there has been a teacher shortage 
in Alberta. School divisions have discovered that through 
centralization both room enrolment and availability of teachers 
increase. At the same time, the quality of instruction improves. 
Shortage of teachers forced many divisions to centralize their 
schools. 

Most of the first schools built within the school districts 
of the County of Ponoka continued to function until they were 
replaced by large centralizations. Therefore in comparatively 
few instances was there any obligation on the part of County 
members to delay the closing of a school because it had been 
recently constructed. By contrast the Red Deer School Division 
replaced many of its rural schools with new one-room buildings.

Within the boundaries of the Ponoka School Division there 
were but two schools which were not included at the time the 
divisions were organized. The boundaries of the Red Deer School 
Division contain ten or more of these independent school 
districts. Therefore, inclusion followed by centralization at 
these places posed a larger problem at Red Deer than at Ponoka. 
Furthermore, in the inclusion of the town of Ponoka and the 
village of Rimbey, positive action and leadership by the div¬ 
isional board seem to suggest a desire for and encouragement of 
inclusion. The minutes of the Red Deer School Division do not 
indicate that this body encouraged inclusion. 

The Ponoka School Division operated a small dormitory at 
Lacombe from 1940 to 1947. It was then sold to the Lacombe 
School Division. There were no dormitories at any other place 
within this division. The Red Deer School Division has had a 
very large dormitory in the City of Red Deer from 1939 to the 
present date (1956). Red Deer has apparently favored the use of 
dormitory facilities whereas Ponoka has not. 

The Ponoka School Division started its first bus route 
in 1945. At the present time (1956) nearly all of the rural 
students are transported to centralized schools. As late as 
1953 very few students within the Red Deer School Division 
were transported by school bus. 

The Ponoka School Division continued its policy of. 
centralization until nearly every student attended one of 
its six centralized schools. As late as 1954? “the Red Deer 
School Division was opposed to the centralization of rural 
one-room schools.

CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS 

There are still many thousands of one-teacher schools 
in United States and Canada. Their contribution to education, 
even in the modern world of 1956, defies measurement. Further¬ 
more, there are indications that they will be used for some 
time to come. But the proportion of students attending one- 
teacher schools is decreasing steadily. This is especially 
true of Alberta during the last decade, for the school 
divisions now transport half of their students to centralized 
schools. 

Every divisional school board in Alberta has had to de¬ 
cide whether school buses should be used. Transportation may 
be expedient; there may be no other alternative. But this 
does not give positive proof that it is better for the students 
concerned to continue the operation of one-teacher schools 
or to replace them with centralized schools. We may point 
out that the majority of school divisions seem to favor the 
use of buses and a majority tends to be right. However, the 
Lethbridge School Division was decidedly in the minority when 
it started to transport large numbers of rural students. 

The Ponoka School Division has built seven one-teacher 
schools since 1939 as compared to twenty-nine for the Red 
Deer School Division in the same period of time. The building 
of such schools indicates a policy in opposition to centralization. 
Therefore we must assume that the Ponoka School Division was 
the more favorably disposed to the centralization of school

pupils, especially of tiiose in elementary and junior high 
school grades. However, both areas are now making use of 
school buses so it would seem that Ponoka's decision to 
replace very few one-room schools was a judicious one. 

The Ponoka County and the Red Deer School Division seem to 
have similar difficulties in building suitable roads for the 
transportation of school pupils. The County has a great 
deal of low-lying bush land in its western and central 
portions. Bus routes must go around Cull Lake, Red Deer Lake, 
Samson Lake and the Hobbema Indian Reservations but these are 
all on the perimeter of the County and therefore their in¬ 
fluence upon transportation within the County is negligible. 

All of the rivers within the County are easily bridged. The 
Red Deer School Division has comparatively little low-lying 
forested land. There are a series of lakes in the region of 
Pine Lake which are obstacles to bus routes. Sylvan Lake has 
very little influence upon bus routes because it is located on 
the boundary of the Division. However, the Red Deer River is, 
generally, located in a very deep valley and the river itself 
is quite wide. Therefore it is expensive to build bridges and 
road approaches across this valley. Because of this expense 
there are few bridges. This is a hindrance in the operation of 
bus routes in the central and western parts of the Division. 
However, there is ample area west of the Red Deer River for two 
or three centralizations and therefore cross-river bus traffic

is not very necessary except in the region of Red Deer City 
where there is a bridge. In both the Ponoka County and the 
Red Deer School Division there are few reasons imposed by 
nature for unduly delaying the operation of bus routes. 

The successful'operation of school buses depends, in no 
small measure, upon the use of surfaced roads as bus routes. 
Despite the fact that the Municipal District of Red Deer 
has more miles of surfaced roads built and maintained by the 
Province of Alberta than has the County of Ponoka, the former 
area has a smaller total mileage of surfaced roads. Also, 
the Red Deer Division has a greater area and more people to be 
served by highways. This situation with respect to roads 
suggests two conditions. Until lately, there has been very 
little demand upon the Red Deer Municipal District for school 
bus routes. The minutes of the Red Deer School Division reveal 
that gravelled bus routes were not requested until as late as 
1953* The second situation is also quite obvious. Before the 
Red Deer School Division can give school bus service to a major 
portion of its rural area, many more miles of gravelled roads 
must be constructed. However, the extension of bus services 
creates a demand for the construction of more gravelled roads. 
Therefore, school authorities should not wait for adequate 
gravelled roads before they establish bus routes. 

Density of population affects the operation of school 
buses. If a large bus can be filled in a thirty-mile circuit 
the transportation cost per pupil is less than if a panel 
delivery truck transports a dozen children but travels the 
same distance. There is a greater density of population in the 


















. 


















































































































Red Deer School Division than in the County of Ponoka. 
Furthermore, a greater proportion of the school children 
live in cities, towns and villages in the Red Deer area. 

Most of these children woulc not be transported if these 
places were included within the Division and were used as 
points of centralization. 

Map IX indicates nine centralizations now operating 
within the boundaries of the Red Deer School Division. If 
Innisfa.il were added, there would be ten places where small 
or large multi-room schools operated even before the Division 
adopted a policy of centralizing its rural school population. 

If all these were included within the School Division and fed 
by bus routes it is probable that no additional centralizations 
would be needed. In contrast, there are but two places in the 
County of Ponoka where larger than one-room schools operated 
when the Ponoka School Division was formed. The remaining four 
centralizations had to be created. 

There is no significant difference between the County 
and the Division with respect to racial extraction and 
religion of the people . Within each area is a Hutterite 
settlement. The County of Ponoka is bordered by Indian Reser¬ 
vations but because of their location they have little or no 
influence upon centralization or bus transportation. 

The rural economy in the Red Deer area is a more pros¬ 
perous one than in the County of Ponoka. The farmers have a 
greater proportion of improved land, the average value of land

per acre is greater, ana the value of farm property per acre 
is greater. Therefore the Red Deer School Division should be 
able to spend more tax money per pupil on education than can 
the County of Ponoka. 

The Red Deer Division is paying more money per classroom 
for plant operation than is the County of Ponoka. This has been 
true from 1949 through 1954. This seems to indicate that it 
costs less to operate large school plants than it does to 
operate many one-room schools. 

Over a seven-year period, ending June, 1954, the basic 
rate of taxation has been 19.5 to 33 mills for school purposes 
in the County of Ponoka. During the same period, the rate of 
taxation for the Red Deer School Division has been 17.17 to 
29 mills. Likewise, on a per-pupil basis the taxpayers of 
the Ponoka area have paid more for education than have the 
taxpayers of the Red Deer area. This would seem to indicate 
that the total cost of education per pupil is greater where 
rural one-room schools are replaced by centralization. 

It is difficult to give courses in commercial, home 
economics, and industrial arts subjects in a one-room rural 
school. Furthermore, it is difficult to give adequate teacher 
instruction in any subject in a single-teacher school. If a 
teacher has nine grades with many subjects in each one, she 
cannot be with a class more than ten to fifteen minutes at 
a time and then there must be a long interval before the

teacher is again with that class. It is especially difficult 
to start students in grade one under tnese conditions for 
the span of interest for young pupils is very short. Also, 
average daily attendance increases and truancy decreases 
when the one-room rural school is centralized. Considering 
pupil instruction only, the County of Ponoka acted wisely when it 
closed its one-room schools. 

During the recent war and post war periods, teacher 
shortage in Alberta was very acute. This had two effects 
which promoted centralization. Most divisions centralized 
their rural schools. Through such an arrangement, average 
classroom enrolment could be increased and every pupil could 
receive Classroom instruction. At the same time it was easier 
to get teachers for multi-room schools than for one-room rural 
schools. The County of Ponoka followed the provincial trend 
in using centralization to combat teacher shortage. The Red Deer 
School Division was served by practically no school buses until 
1953. 

The trend in Alberta, since 1947, has been toward the 
expansion of school bus services and the closing of dormitories. 
The Ponoka School Division operated a small dormitory at 
Lacombe from 1940 to 1947. It never operated a dormitory 
at either Ponoka or Rimbey. That is, after 1947 this division 
did not use dormitories to extend high school facilities to 
rural students. However, the dormitory has been a principal 
part of the high school facilities at the Red Deer School Division 
since 1939.

It has been pointed out that in general there are no 
geographic nor economic reasons why the Red Deer School 
Division should not make extensive use of school buses. 

Indeed, considering mileage of provincial roads, density of 
population, rural agricultural wealth, and natural points 
for centralization, this division has a definite advantage 
over the County of Ponoka in the conveyance of school children. 
Why, then, did the County of Ponoka replace her one-room 
schools with six centralizations served by buses whereas the 
Red Deer Division retained most of its one-room schools until 
after 1953? Ike answer is to be found in the policies of each 
administrative authority. Since the late 1940*s the County of 
Ponoka has favored the use of school buses. By contrast, the 
Red Deer School Division steadfastly opposed the use of school 
buses as late as 1954 for in that year its board declared 
that it: 

"would centralize if forced to through circumstances 

or if requested by ratepayers. 11 1
