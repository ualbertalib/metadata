A STUDY OP THE NUTRITION OP THE PIG; 

THE INFLUENCE OF THE GESTATION-LACTATION RATION 
ON THE PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT 
OF THE PROGENY 


INTRODUCTION 


Since the inception of feeding trial techniques several 
decades ago, many studies have been made of the nutrition of 
the pig from weaning to marketing age. A much smaller number 
of investigations have been conducted to obtain information 
on the influence of the diet of the sow during gestation and 
lactation upon the number of offspring and their viability. 

To date, no such comprehensive study has been reported from 
a Canadian source, and consequently the information at hand 
concerning the adequacy of common Canadian rations for reproduc 
tlve functions of the brood sow is limited. 

The chief barrier to carrying out reproduction studies 
with domestic animals is their time-consuming and costly nature 
Data on a relatively large number of animals are desirable and 
the accumulation of such data involves extensive investments 
in breeding stock, housing and labor. The alternative to 
maintaining large numbers of breeding animals is to maintain 
a smaller number on a long-term basis, but this procedure 
involves a prolonged delay in obtaining reliable results.

In view of the apparent need for a broad research 
program dealing with brood sow nutrition, a project was inaug¬ 
urated at the University of Alberta in June, I9I+I4-# to obtain 
data on the reproduction performance of sows deprived of pasture 
and fed an unbalanced ration, as compared to that of sows fed 
a balanced ration including pasture. Pigs from these sows 
were utilized in comparative feeding trials to determine the 
effect of the gestation-lactation ration upon the growing- 
fattening performance of the progeny. 


REVIEW OP LITERATURE 


The value of good hay and pasture for brood sows has 
been recognized for many years. Alfalfa as a supplement to 
rations based on corn has been recommended to corn-belt hog 
producers in the United States by numerous authorities. 

Morrison £t al. (l) in X928 observed that grains were 
unsatisfactory as the sole components of brood sow rations, 
and advocated alfalfa pasture during gestation. Martin ( 2 ) 
recommended including 10 $ of high quality legume hay in the 
ration when pasture was not available, but warned that the 
vitamin A potency of alfalfa hay was unreliable. However he 
cited this legume as capable of overcoming the deficiencies of 
a corn-tankage ration for sows.

In several trials Gardner and Freeman at Michigan 
found that good quality alfalfa hay could be utilized success¬ 
fully to replace tankage as a supplement to a basal gestation 
ration of corn or mixed grains. The reproduction performance 
of breeding females, as measured by the weight, strength and 
numbers of pigs farrowed, was not materially different on 
tankage- or alf alf a-shpplemented rations (3) (!{.)• Equally 
satisfactory results were obtained when alfalfa hay was self- 
fed as when alfalfa meal constituted one-third of the basal 
diet (5). 

Hogan and Johnson at Missouri conducted numerous 
trials designed to demonstrate the inadequacy of common gesta¬ 
tion rations of the corn-soybean type and to find means of 
improving them (6)(7)(8). Hogan succeeded in raising to weaning 
age Ql% of pigs from sows whose gestation ration had contained 
15^ alfalfa meal, as compared to only 51 % from sows whose 
ration had contained 5$ alfalfa meal (6). A later report 
showed that fresh cut forage or alfalfa meal reduced the mor¬ 
tality and number of abnormalities among pigs and increased 
the number weaned (9)* The importance of pasture in supplying 
factors needed for optimum performance during lactation and 
for reducing the incidence of mortality was also demonstrated 
( 10 ). Hogan, Johnson and Gahley ( 11 ) reported that over an 
eight year period thirty-eight sows weaned 53$ of the live pigs 
they farrowed when fed the following gestation-lactation ration: 
yellow corn 77* tankage 10, linseed oil meal 5, alfalfa meal 5, 
salts 2 and cod liver oil 1 . Many suckling pigs were stricken

with skin lesions, muscular incoordination, fatty livers, 
diarrhoea or hemorrhage# Supplementation of the above ration 
with niacin, thiamin and riboflavin, plus molasses and soybean 
oil as sources of pantothenic acid and vitamin E respectively, 
considerably increased the percentage of pigs weaned as well as 
their weaning weights, and decreased the number of abnormalities 
( 12 )o The noticeable incidence of leg weakness, however, led 
Hogan and McRoberts to conclude that a vitamin(s) other than 
those supplied was deficient in the common feedstuffs used in 
swine rations* 

Two reports dealing with the effect of nutrition on 
reproduction processes in the pig and rat have been published 
recently by Ross, Phillips and Bohstedt of the University of 
Wisconsin# A common basal ration of the following composition 
was fed to gilts during growth, gestation and lactation: 
ground yellow corn 76*35* soybean oil meal 17*50, ground alfalfa 
hay 5*00* iodized salt 0*50 and calcium carbonate 0*65 percent. 
Invariably the gilts failed to suckle their young sufficiently 
to allow normal growth, though there appeared to be no inhibi¬ 
tion of the reproductive function prior to farrowing (15). 

The young pigs became thin and weak, and death ensued in many 
cases# The inclusion of alfalfa meal in the maternal diet 

materially increased the vigor of the offspring* The basal 
ration, when fed to rats, produced a high incidence of intra¬ 
uterine hemorrhage and fetal death, but when supplemented with 
alfalfa at the level it permitted normal reproduction and 
lactation* Likewise a Skelly-B extract of alfalfa, plus casein.

pantothenic acid, riboflavin and pyridoxin©, gave excellent 
results, though the extract alone was ineffective. 

In a later study by the same workers, the record of 
gilts receiving a similar basal ration plus 15 % alfalfa was 
compared to that of gilts receiving only 5% alfalfa supplement. 
Twice as many pigs averaging 2 *j% heavier were weaned by the 
first group (ll|). The deficiencies of the 5$ alfalfa ration, 
as assessed from the number of abnormalities at birth,were 
more acute in the second generation. Supplementation with 
wheat bran, middlings, fishmeal, tankage, brewers* yeast or 
molasses during the late gestation period failed to improve the 
reproduction performance. 

Cunha, Ross, Phillips and Bohstedt (15) continued 
these investigations by observing the effect of adding various 
supplements to the basal ration. The addition of either choline, 
crystalline riboflavin or 1 % B-Y riboflavin supplement proved 
ineffective and, in some cases, detrimental. Adding 2 % B-Y 
riboflavin supplement produced an improvement but did not 
eliminate abnormalities. Normal reproduction was obtained by 

supplementing the basal ration with either 10% alfalfa meal 

/ 

or soybean lecithin plus pyridoxine. The soybean lecithin 
contained about y% inositol and 5% choline. The investigators 
had previously found that inositol was somewhat beneficial in 
reproduction and lactation rations for swine. 

Of the sows maintained on the basal ration during 
growth prior to this experiment, fifty percent were sterile

and the reproduction record of the remainder was extremely 
poor regardless of the geartation ration fed. This observa¬ 
tion led the authors to conclude that the ration sows receive 
during growth markedly influences their subsequent performance 
in reproduction and lactation. 

Rats reproduced normally on the basal diet plus liver, 
inositol, choline and pyridoxin©, but not on the basal ration 
!>lus all the known B-complex vitamins including folic acid and 
biotin. Prom the studies with swine and rats, these workers 
concluded that the unknown factor or factors necessary for 
normal reproduction were present in soybean lecithin and liver® 

Extensive investigations were conducted by the Illinois 
workers Fairbanks, Krider and Carroll to determine the value 
of adding various supplements to a corn-soybean lactation 
ration. Initial tests indicated that the addition of 
dried corn distillers’ solubles to such a ration produced no 
appreciable improvement in the weaning record (l6). 

Striking results were obtained by Krider et, al. (17) 
from feeding a basal ration of the following composition to 
gilts in drylot during the growth, gestation and lactation 
periods: ground yellow corn 83, soybean meal 8, tankage 5, 
fish meal 2, limestone O.5, steamed bone meal O.5, iodized 
salt O.5 and fortified cod liver oil 0.5. These results, 
together with those obtained from the addition of various 
supplements, are summarized as follows:

These data indicate that storage of known or unknown factors 
was great enough to be manifested in significant differences 
in the number of pigs that survived to weaning* Alfalfa was 
the most effective supplement to the basal ration, though the 
corn solubles improved the breeding efficiency of the sows and 
the vigor of the young pigs 0 The residual effect of the ration 
supplemented with a mixture of crystalline vitamins was not as 
pronounced as that of the rations supplemented with the naturaj. 
vitamin-carriers• 

The effects produced by adding condensed fish solubles 
to the corn-soybean basal ration during gestation and lactation, 
or by giving access to rye pasture during these periods, were 
reported by Krider ejt al. ( 19 )* Results accruing from feeding 
the basal ration were similar to those already described, while 
the fish solubles, at 3$ and 6$ levels, and the rye pasture, 
produced an improvement in the reproduction performance to a 
level somewhat below that attained on the alfalfa-supplemented 
rations previously reported. Gross abnormalities similar to 
those reported elsewhere occurred among pigs whose dams were 
fed the basal ration. 

In a repetition of this experiment, Krider and associates 
(20) found that the deficiency (or deficiencies) of the basal 
ration was corrected by supplementing it with rye pasture, 10$ 
alfalfa meal or either 2$ or condensed fish solubles. 

These results were essentially the same as those obtained in 

6he first experiment, except that in this trial the fish solubles

In attempts to identify the unknown ingredients, 

Krider et al. added all the knovm B-vitamins to the corn-soybean 
ration ( 21 )* The basal ration consisted of ground yellow corn 
72*5, soybean meal 25, fortified cod liver oil 0*5, mineral 
mixture 2, plus the crystalline vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, 
niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine and choline* This mixture 
was fed to gilts during gestation and lactation. Their reproduc¬ 
tion performance as measured by the percentage of pigs weaned 
was as follows: 


Ration 


Pigs weaned 


Basal 

Basal + pyracin + para-amino-benzoic acid 

+ inositol + biotin + alpha-tocopherol 
+ vitamin K 

Basal + 10 % dehydrated alfalfa meal 
Basal + AB liver extract 
Basal + folic acid concentrate 
Basal + Cerogras 


69# 


32^ 

97< 
\z% 


ltltf 


No explanation was offered for the detrimental effect 
produced by adding the assortment of vitamins. Apparently 
the alfalfa and liver contained important factors other than 
the vitamins added to the basal ration. Although the addition 
of the folic acid concentrate did not improve weaning weights 
significantly, the pigs from sows so fed were thriftier and 
more vigorous than pigs from sows fed the basal ration. 

The essentiality of an unknown factor(s), or of one 
of the lesser knov/n B-complex vitamins, for successful reproduc¬ 
tion and lactation in swine was effectively demonstrated by 
Ensminger et al. ( 22 ) by means of purified gestation diets.

The basal diet contained casein, sucrose, lard and minerals, 
plus the six common B vitamins thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, 
pantothenic acid, pyridoxin© and choline. When this ration was 
fed for II4.O days before farrowing, complete lactation failure 
’ followed, but when it was fed for only 52 days prior to farrow¬ 
ing, a good reproduction record resulted, indicating the storage 
of essential factors before the experiment. 

With reference to reports cited in the literature on 
the beneficial supplementary value of liver, dried corn dis¬ 
tillers* solubles and fish solubles in swine rations, it is 
of interest to note that one or more unidentified growth factors 
for chicks have been shown to exist in each of these materials 
( 2 ij.) (25) ( 26 ) • In addition, a chick growth f actor (s) exists in 
cow manure (27), and it would be of special interest to know 
the importance of this factor in the nutrition of sows under 
farm conditions. 

Fortunately, reproduction difficulties of the severity 
of those reported by American observers are not normally en¬ 
countered by Canadian swine producers who feed reasonably well- 
balanced rations based on the common coarse grains. From the 
standpoint of their ability to supply the known essential 
nutrients in the required amounts, the basal corn-soybean 
gestation diets described as 1 inadequate* by many workers 
appear equal, or superior, to those used extensively, and with 
considerable success, in Canada. The chief difference between 
these two types of rations lies in the grains used, and it 
appears that corn,In comparison with barley and oats, is deficient

in one or more factors essential to successful reproduction 
in the pig* 

While the use of pasture and hay in brood sow feeding 
has been recommended for many years, relatively large numbers 
of Canadian swine producers continue to raise pigs under 
conditions approaching continuous drylot feeding# Although 
brood sow nutrition appears to be less hazardous for the mixed 
grain feeder than for the corn grain feeder, it appears likely 
that the former also may suffer losses from the absence of 
green vegetation in the ration* To date no comprehensive study 
has been made of the character or magnitude of these probable 
losses* It was to study these points that the project des¬ 
cribed in the ensuing report was undertaken* 

SECTION I. REPRODUCTION PERFORMANCE 


Object of Experiments 

This study was conducted to obtain data on the performance 
of sows deprived of pasture and fed an unbalanced ration as 
compared to that of sows fed a balanced ration including pasture* 

Experimental 

The experiments subsequently described are divided 
into two series, A and B, according to the nature of the experi¬ 
mental ration* In Series A, comprised of five experiments

(Noso 200, 200B, 208, 208B and 215 ), tiie experimental ration 
contained no greenfeed, whereas in Series B, comprised of two 
experiments (Nos. 218 and 221), it contained alfalfa meal. 

The control ration was similar for both series. Beginning 
with Experiment #208B the original breeding females were 
gradually replaced with second generation stock. 

Procedure - Series A 
Experiment #200 - Summer 19lib- 

Two groups of four two-year-old purebred Yorkshire 
sows of similar breeding were used in this experiment. They 
and their dams had previously been maintained on what is 
commonly considered to be a good practical ration mad© up of 
coarse grains, mixed supplement, and pasture or alfalfa hay 
plus fish oil. The sows were fed the following rations during 
gestation and lactation:

The control group were fed according to the usual university 
herd regime which included cereal grain or rape pasture for a 
period of approximately four months during the summer. The 
experimental group were subjected to continuous drylot feeding 
in vegetation-free yards during the gestation period. Sows 
of both groups were moved into the main piggery for farrowing 
and the first three or four weeks of lactation, where they were 
maintained on the rations outlined* They were then transferred 
outside to colony houses situated in enclosed yards.

All young pigs were dosed with 15 grains of reduced 
iron at 7 , lij. and 21 days of age as protection against 
nutritional anemia. With each dose they were also given 
approximately 3 c.c. of fish oil (I5OOA-2OOD). 

Data were collected on the breeding, farrowing and 
lactation performance of the sows and the weaning record of 
the young pigs. 

Sxperlment # 2 QQB - Winter IQiali-liS* 

Owing to the critical labor situation, it was not 
possible to maintain the two lots of sows on the rations 
originally outlined. Consequently both groups were fed the 
following ration during gestation:

tion, the procedure of that experiment was duplicated.

Experiment #208B - Winter 19il5-l4.6 

Three second-generation gilts were selected from the 
second litters of each original group* These were added to 
their respective lots and maintained according to the procedure 
of Experiment #200, with the exception that during the winter 
the control gilts were self-fed alfalfa hay in addition to 
the regular ration. 

Experiment #215 - Summer 19k6 

Two additional second-generation gilts were selected 
from the third litters of the original sows. These gilts and 
the two remaining control and experimental sows from Experiment 
#200 were continued under the conditions of that experiment. 

In summary, the control group of Series A were fed a 
ration considered adequate with respect to protein, minerals, 
vitamins A and D, and any other factors afforded by pasture, 
whereas the experimental group were fed a mixture consisting 
of coarse grains, calcium supplement and iodized salt, a ration 
considered deficient or borderline in protein and vitamin D, 
definitely lacking in vitamin A, and possibly wanting in other 
unknown nutrients obtained from pasture. 

The crude protein content of the rations of both groups 
varied considerably with different sources of coarse grains, 
but analyses indicated that on an air-dry basis the protein 
content of the drylot ration for the control group ranged from

# 200 B failed to conceive after two services but became pregnant 
after a single service in the following season* 

As indicated in Table I, litters farrowed by the control 
sows averaged 2*7 more live pigs than those farrowed by the 
experimental group* In accordance with the smaller litters, the 
birth weights of the experimental group pigs were somewhat 
superior* However, as evidence of the inability of the experi¬ 
mental ration to meet the demands of lactation, by weaning 
age the disparity in litter size had increased to 3*6 pigs* The 
control sows weaned 7 W of their pigs as compared to 55 $ for the 
experimental sows* While this figure for the control group is 
not considered satisfactory, it indicates the superior ability 
of these so?/s to successfully raise their young* Nevertheless, 
the progeny of the test group which survived to weaning age were 
as heavy at that time as those from the control group* 

In spite of the lack of feeding oil in the experimental 
ration, no apparent manifestations of vitamin A deficiency, such 
as a high incidence of malformations or of stillborn pigs, were 
observed* To what degree, if any, the weakness of many of the. 
experimental pigs and their susceptibility to secondary infections 
were attributable to a deficiency of this vitamin, is questionable* 
Peed records for both groups of sows in comparable drylot 
periods indicated an average daily consumption of 5.7 and 6*lj, 
lbs* of feed during gestation, and 15*0 and 13*5 lbs* during 
lactation for the control and experimental sows respectively* An 
estimate of the daily nutrient consumption for the two groups

The National Research Council recommendations for protein 
appear to be considerably higher than those of Morrison. According 
to the latter, the control ration was adequate frith respect to 
protein and T.D.N., while the experimental ration was slightly 
deficient in digestible protein during lactation. It should be 
noted that the protein content of the grain varied significantly, 
so that it seems certain that the experimental ration was defic¬ 
ient in this nutrient for substantial periods of time. In 
addition, the quality of cereal protein for purposes of gestation

and lactation is questionable* 

The experimental gestation ration failed to meet the 
National Research Council recommendations for calcium, but 
concurred with the specification of Hogan ( 30 ) that the gestation 
diet should contain at least 0*l|.$ calcium. In this case calcium 
constituted 0 * 14 . 6 $ of the ration* 


Procedure - Series B 


Experiment #218 Winter 19li.6-k7 

Data accumulated from Series A experiments indicated 
that the reproduction trends of the respective groups were 
definitely established and that no further information of 
essential importance was likely to accrue from a continuation 
of the nutritional regime of Experiment #200* In view of the 
many reports indicating the value of alfalfa as a supplement to 
corn-soybean gestation-lactation rations, the ensuing experiments 
were designed to determine the ability of alfalfa meal, ?/hen fed 
as part of the experimental ration during pregnancy and lacta¬ 
tion, to improve the farrowing and weaning performance of the 
experimental lot* This group now consisted of five second- 
generation sows from the third and fourth litters of the 
original stock. One sow had already farrowed twice during 
Series A, two had farrowed once, and two were being bred for 
the first time. Their alfalfa-supplemented ration is outlined 
he low:

In connection with Experiment #2l8 it should be noted 


that one control sow farrowed six dead and sixteen live pigs of 
which only two survived. This exceptionally large litter therefore 
caused a disproportionate increase in the average number of pigs 
born alive for the group and a similar decrease in the average 
number weaned. The same sow which failed to conceive in Experi¬ 
ment #215 also failed to become pregnant in Experiment #218 and 
was consequently marketed. 

Inspection of Tables IV and V reveals a wide variation 
between the two experimental lots of Series B in the average numbers 
of pigs weaned and their weaning weights. The mortality rate 
during lactation among the pigs from Experiment #218 was exceed¬ 
ingly high, whereas among those of Experiment #221 it was greatest 
after weaning. In terms of percentages of pigs marketed, 33 % of 
the pigs from Experiment #2l8 reached market age as compared to 
1+2% of those from Experiment #221. 

In so far as a comparison is possible from an average of 
the two seasons 1 data acquired since the supplementation of the 
experimental ration with alfalfa meal, there appears to have been 
no improvement in the reproduction record of the sows except with 
respect to litter size. The results obtained from five farrowing 
seasons in Series A and two seasons in Series B are summarized 


in Table VI

The average difference of 1*3 live pigs born per litter 
between the experimental sows of Series A and Series B was highly 
significant (beyond the 1 % point) according to Student’s t test 
for unpaired values (t = 3 •?(>)♦ This indicates that the addi¬ 
tion of alfalfa to the experimental ration caused a ’real’ improve¬ 
ment in the farrowing record of the sows# 

Although the losses between farrowing and weaning averaged 
!{_• 6 pigs per sow for Series B as compared to 3*7 for Series A, 
the average numbers of pigs weaned by the Experiment #221 sows 
shows a considerable improvement over that of the Series A sows 
and those of Experiment # 2 l 8 # However, the average weaning 
weight for these pigs was the lowest of all the groups and the 
post-weaning losses were the highest# Further data are required 
before definite conclusions can be drawn, but judging from the 
results of these two experiments the alfalfa meal was unable to 
remedy the lactation failure caused by continuous drylot feeding 
of a mixture of oats and barley supplemented with calcium and 
iodized salt# 

With reference to the very low weaning weights of the 
experimental group pigs of Experiment #221 it is of interest

to note that the average daily feed consumption of their dams 
during lactation was only 10.6 lbs. The alfalfa meal supplement 
did not appear to stimulate the appetites of the sows, and the 
average daily intake of protein and total digestible nutrients 
was considerably below the Morrison standards.

As would be expected from inspection of Table VII, a 
highly significant difference in litter size existed between the 
control and experimental sows. The interaction between sows and 
groups could not be removed, but simple analyses of the data from 
each group revealed a highly significant variation between sows on 
the experimental ration and an insignificant difference between 
sows on the control (see Appendix Tables VIII and IX). The high 
variability is indicative of some adverse influence affecting 
litter size. 

' With respect to the average number of pigs weaned per 
litter. Series A and B may be considered together, since no 
significant difference existed in the weaning records of the 
experimental lots for the two series (t for unpaired differences 
= G. 14 . 2 ). An analysis of variance for the average number of pigs 
weaned per litter is presented in Table X.

that of the control sows. The difference for the control sows 
is assumed to be due to the natural decrease among first litters. 

On the basis of their two initial litters, the second 
generation sows showed a decline in litter size of 1.6 pigs for 
the control group and 3.9 for the experimental. The average 
difference between the two groups increased from 1.8 pigs in the 
first generation to 3.1 in the second, indicating that the 
adverse effects of the experimental ration were more pronounced 
in the generation. It is apparent from the weaning record 
of the latter that continuation of the experimental regime led 
to a deterioration of the reproductive efficiency to a point 
representing economic disaster for a large-scale swine producer. 

Loss of Weight During Lactation 

Weights of sows were recorded prior to farrowing and at 
weaning. The average loss of weight during this period was 58 
lbs. for the control sows and Ij .5 lbs. for the experimental, al¬ 
though the test sows consumed approximately three lbs. less feed 
daily. A fraction of this inter-group difference between average 
pre-farrowing and post-lactation weights may be accounted for 
by the difference in the average weight of the litters born 
( 27*5 lbs. for the control group; 22.1j. lbs. for the experimental) 
but it appears to be more closely associated with the respective 
numbers of pigs weaned. In the few instances when average-sized 
litters were weaned by experimental sov/s, the losses in weight 
were greater, comparatively, than among the control sov/s which 
weaned litters of similar size.

SECTION II. PROGENY FEEDING TRIALS. 


Five feeding trials (nos. 208, 208B, 215, 2l8 and 221), 
comprised of from one to three comparable lots of pigs from 
each of the control and experimental groups of sows, were 
conducted from the summer of I 9 I +5 tc the summer of 191 + 7 * 

Object of Experiments 

To augment the reproduction data which have been presented 
in Section I, feeding trials were conducted to ascertain the 
effect of the ration fed to the dam during gestation and lactation 
upon the growing and fattening performance of the progeny. 

Procedure 

Representative weanling pigs from each group of sows were 
allotted uniformly, where possible, with respect to sex, weight, 
dam, condition and type, to lots of five to seven pigs each. 
Corresponding lots of pigs from control and experimental sows 
were housed in drylot with straw as bedding. Minor variations 
in management existed from one trial to another, but management 
practices for lots under comparison in any one trial were the 
same. Weights of individual pigs were recorded at the beginning 
of the experiment and every fourteen days thereafter until the 
pigs attained market weight.

Rations 


- 52 - 


The feeding period was divided into two sections: 

( 1 ) from weaning weight to 110 lbs. 

( 2 ) from 110 lbs. to market weight. 

First period ration: 

Oats 

Barley 

Mixed supplement* 

Second period ration: 

Oats 
Barley 

Mixed supplement* 

*Mixed supplement: 

Tankage 

Linseed oil meal 
Fish meal 
Ground limestone 
Salt, iodized 

The pigs were hand-fed three times daily during the first 
period and twice daily during the second. The meal was slopped 
with water at feeding time and feed records were maintained 
throughout the feeding trials. 

The average protein values for the above rations were 
lk*k% for the first period and 12.1j$ for the second. It will be 
noted that the rations for both periods were deficient in vitamins 
A and D. For purposes of comparison, the two lots of Experiment 
#221 and the first and third lots of Experiment #218, control 
and experimental, were given fish oil (I 5 OOA - 200D) at a rate 
of Ij. c.c. per pig per day.

For two feeding trials, #21? and #221, the composition 
of the mixed supplement was amended because of a difficulty in 
procuring fish meal 0 The fish meal content was consequently 
reduced to and the tankage increased to of the supplement* 

The final mixture contained crude protein by analysis* 

Results and Discussion 

In several instances the numbers of pigs available at 
one time from the experimental group of sows were so limited 
that it was necessary to employ a whole litter as a test lot, 
thereby rendering individual lot comparisons invalid* However, 
continued repetition of the feeding trials resulted in the 
establishment of lot averages which permitted the comparison of 
growth and fattening performances of pigs from the respective 
groups of sows* 

A summary of the results of five comparative feeding 
trials Is presented in Table XII*

Although the differences between the feed lot performances 
of the pigs from the control and the experimental sows were small, 
they were relatively consistent, and the average differences of 
0*09 lbs* per day in daily gain and of 19*9 lbs* feed consumed 
per 100 lbs* gain between the two groups were highly significant

The average weights of the control and experimental 
pigs from 10 to 28 weeks of age are shown graphically in 
Figure I# For comparison, an estimated "normal" growth curve 
for Yorkshire pigs as established by Grampton (23) is also 
plotted* The curves reveal a slight but consistent difference 
in favor of the control pigs as compared to the experimental 
ones, though both groups were significantly lighter throughout 
the period than those comprising the standard* This discrepancy 
may be due to a strain difference, a more favorable nutritional 
regime or other environmental factors, but in any case the per¬ 
formance of both groups of pigs must be considered somewhat 
subnormal. 

Average daily gains of the pigs during the same period 
are indicated in Figure II. The mean growth rate of the control 
pigs was consistently greater, but large variations occurred in 
both groups. The depressions in the curves at about the twenty- 
second week were presumably caused by a change in the composition 
of the ration from Period I to Period II which occurred at this 
time. A decreased slope at the upper extremity of the curves 
was due to the marketing of the fastest gaining pigs. The 
average daily gains for the control and experimental groups 
respectively were .99 lbs. and .92 lbs. during Period I and 
1.5!}. lbs. and l.Jjij. lbs. during Period II. 

Occasional cases of staggering and muscular incoordina¬ 
tion occurred among the growing pigs of both groups. These 
pigs responded to the administration of fish oil and the attacks 
were therefore attributed to vitamin A deficiency. However,

no drastic symptom of a deficiency of this vitamin, such as 
blindness, was observed. The ration for the two lots of 
Experiment #221 and for the first and third lots of Experiment 
# 218 , control and experimental, contained fish oil (I5OOA - 200 D) 
at a level of 1 + c.c. per pig per day. The feeding oil produced 
no significant increase in the rate of gain, though no cases of 
incoordination were observed in these lots. 

The practical significance of the discrepancy between 
the control and experimental groups of sows is represented by 
the respective numbers of pigs marketed, namely 230 as compared 
to 118 . The total losses from farrowing to marketing were 59$ 
for the control group and 59$ for the experimental. For the 
pigs remaining, however, the variability, as measured by the 
criteria of average daily gain and feed consumption per unit 
gain, was less striking. In other words, the effect of the 
deficient ration fed to the experimental sows was exemplified 
primarily in the reproduction and weaning performance rather 
than in the growing-fattening performance of the progeny.

general DISCUSSION - SECTIONS I AND II. 


The prolonged maintenance of sows on the unbalanced 
experimental ration used in these experiments resulted in a 
decrease in the reproductive efficiency as compared to that of 
the control animals, but considering the apparent deficiencies 
in protein, vitamin D and particularly vitamin A, the results 
were in some respects unexpectedly favorable. Evidently no 
factors were deficient to such a degree that the ability of 
the sows to conceive was affected. However, their prolificacy 
was significantly reduced, as is apparent from the average 
difference of 2.7 live pigs born per litter between the experi¬ 
mental and control groups of Series A. Apart from size of 
litter, no impairment of the reproductive function seems to 
have occurred up to the lactation period. The incidence of 
abnormalities was zero, the number of pigs born dead was the same 
for the two groups, and the average birth weight of the test 
pigs was 0.2 lbs. greater than that of the controls. 

In view of the continued absence of a vitamin A supplement 
in the experimental ration, it is surprising that no gross 
evidence of a deficiency of this vitamin occurred in the perfor¬ 
mance of the sows. Although small litters were farrowed and 
many of the young pigs possessed low viability, the expected 
high incidence of mortality and malformations at birth was not 
encountered. In this connection there was, unfortunately, no 
attempt made to determine whether the undersized litters were

due to a low production of ova or to the death and resorption 
of some of the fetuses* 

The main impact of the deficient regime was observed 
during the lactation period* Many of the test pigs became 
thin, emaciated and diarrhoeic within a few days after birth, 
and the incidence of mortality reached 1 + 5 $ at weaning age* 

The hardship of weaning and the change of feed was sufficient 
to cause the death of 2 \+$ of the remaining pigs shortly after 
weaning* Those that survived to 12 weeks of age were, in the 
main, of fair vigor, and they put on weight at a rate approach¬ 
ing that of progeny of the control sows* 

What proportion of the losses which occurred during 
lactation was due to a deficiency of vital factors in the milk 
of the experimental sows and what proportion was caused by an 
inadequate storage of factors in the fetuses is speculative* 

It is also impossible to state with assurance to what extent a 
quantitative deficiency of milk existed on the part of these 
sows, but it is doubtful that there was a shortage during early 
lactation* Many of the young pigs were lacking in vigor and 
failed to suckle adequately* Whether from a dietary cause or 
from insufficient suckling, the milk supply of some of the sows 
became quite meagre during the late stages of lactation* 

The incidence of secondary infections, particularly those 
of the respiratory tract, was high, and this situation was 
aggravated, especially during the winter months, by the housing 
conditions which prevailed*

The addition of alfalfa to the ration of the experimental 
sows produced one positive effect, namely an increase in litter 
size at birth. The losses between birth and weaning were not 
reduced, however, and by market age 62% of the pigs born alive 
had died. Obviously the therapeutic value of alfalfa in this 
ration was in marked contrast to its value in the corn-soybean 
diet as reported by several workers. It appears either that 
the factors deficient in the experimental ration were not the 
ones deficient in the corn-soybean ration or that the experimental 
sows were irremediably affected by continuous subjection to the 
inadequate regime of Series A. There is no report in the litera¬ 
ture concerning the value of alfalfa supplementation of a corn- 
soybean ration for sows which had been previously maintained on 
the basal mixture for a period comparable to that of the dura¬ 
tion of the Series A experiments. 

The re -si dual effect of the experimental regime is 
apparent from the fact that the difference in litter size 
between the first and second generations was 2.5 pigs greater 
for the test group than for the controls. The average litter 
size for the seven second generation experimental sows of Series 
A was only 5*6 pigs. 

An attempt was made to assess the economic significance 
of the discrepancy between the control and experimental groups 
during the period of these experiments. The gross revenue 
accruing from the sale of the progeny was calculated at current 
prices on a carcass grade basis. The feed consumption data 
for the pigs used in the feeding trials were applied to those

for which no records were maintained, and similarly the feed 
consumption of from seven to eighteen sows at different periods 
was assumed to be an average for the entire group. The cost 
estimates, apart from those for feed, were based on the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta method for computing hog production costs (31)* 
Peed costs were calculated from prices prevailing at the time 
of the experiments, A qualified financial statement is presented

The calculated difference in net profit of $859*is 
considered conservative. The charges levied against the 
experimental group for sow replacement, boar service and de¬ 
preciation on buildings are relatively small, and in addition 
the feeding performance of the experimental pigs used in the 
feeding trials, upon which the feed cost estimates were based, 
is believed to be considerably better than the average for the 
whole group. In any event, the net profit estimate emphasizes 
the practical value of a system of brood sow management based 
on the use of reasonably well-balanced rations including pasture 
in aeason, as compared to a system of drylot feeding of coarse 
grains supplemented with only iodized salt and ground limestone. 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


Experiments were conducted to observe the effects of 
maintaining an experimental group of sows on a ration consisting 
of small grains, iodized salt and ground limestone, a ration 
which was deficient in protein plus vitamins A and D and was 
devoid of green feed, as compared to the effects of maintaining 
a control group on a common practical ration which included 
coarse grains, mixed supplement and pasture in season. The 
results of these tests are summarized as follows:

1* The breeding efficiency of the experimental sows as measured 
by their ability to conceive was not impaired by the deficient 
ration* 

2« The prolificacy of the tost sov/s was reduced by 2*7 live 
pigs per litter as compared to the control group* 

3* Sows maintained on the drylot ration were unable to adequately 
provide for the nutritional requirements of their litters 
during lactation. Pig mortality was high during lactation 
and for a period of about four weeks following weaning. 

lj.**The addition of alfalfa to the deficient ration caused an 
increase in the average number of live pigs farrowed but 
failed to provide the missing factors required for success¬ 
ful lactation. 

5* The deleterious effects of the experimental group ration were 
more pronounced in the reproduction performance of the second 
generation test sows than in that of their dams. 

6. The progeny of the experimental sows which survived the 
lactation and early post-weaning periods gained at a rate 
almost equivalent to that of the progeny of the control 
sov/s, and required approximately more feed per 100 lbs. 
gain. 

7* The estimated difference between the net profits accruing 
from the control.and experimental groups during a period of 
three and one-half years or seven farrowing seasons was 
eight hundred and fifty-nine dollars in favor of the group 
fed the supplemented ration with pasture in season.
