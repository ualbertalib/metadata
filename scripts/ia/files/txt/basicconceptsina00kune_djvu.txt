CHAPTER 1 


INTERPRETATION OP THE PROBLEM 

The purpose of the experimental course discussed 

in this thesis has been to interpret the course in first 

year Algebra in a manner which would place major emphasis 

upon the understanding of basic concepts rather than upon 

the manipulation of algebraic symbols and numbers. There 

is evidence that in the past more attention has been given 

to the formal and computational or manipulative phases of 

algebra than to the informational, interpretative, and 

functional aspects. It was felt than an endeavor should 

be made to make algebra, particularly in an introductory 

course, more meaningful. With this end in view the writer 

organized a course in Algebra One and taught it for one year 

to two classes in a city high school in an attempt to deter- 
in 

mine A how far and in what manner this end might be achieved. 

Content of Thesis . The thesis contains a discussion 
of the teaching of each of the main topics in elementary 
algebra, indicating the method of approach, the manner of 
treatment, and the nature and content of the exercises and 
assignments used. 

Algebraic Language, the formula, the equation in one 
unknown, problem solving, and graphs, are each discussed in a 
separate chapter. Chapter seven is devoted to selected topics 
and methods. The teaching of directed numbers and factoring 
are discussed. The study-assignment method and the use of 
geometric illustrations for picturing certain computations 1 nci 
relationships are described. Chapter eight is devotee to a 
study of pupils’ errors as revealed in the analysis of results

of some of the assignments and tests. Evaluations and 
criticisms of the method and procedures used are given in 
chapter nine. 

Place of Experiment . The practical part of the work 
was carried out in the G-arneau High School, Edmonton, during 
the school year 1934-35* The course was taught to two grade 
nine classes consisting of thirty-one and thirty-three pupils 
respectively. The course took the place of the prescribed 
course in Algebra One and occupied the regular scheduled 
place on the school time table. 


Growth of Humber Concepts 

The child is introduced to mathematics through the 
natural numbers. First he learns the verbal or spoken number, 
then the written symbol. During this time he begins to grasp 
the quantitative meaning of the numbers 1-10, then gradually 
of those from 10 to 100 ana beyond. He learns too, through 
counting, something of the sequence and order, of the fascina¬ 
tingly systematic nature of our number system. Then he learns 
the operation of the fundamental laws upon these numbers and 
his wonder of the system grows. The child has now gained a 
rudimentary concept of number. Gradually his comprehension 
grasps the fractional numbers and their symbols in their 
several forms. He learns, too, to carry out the same opera¬ 
tions - addition, subtraction, etc. - with these as he did 
with the integers. With no further extension of the idea of 
number the child grows through his years of arithmetic. All 
numbers - numerical symbols - known to him have a known and 
fixed value and all of them are undirected. 

When the child begins to study algebra several 
additions are added to his concept of number. He learns that 
numbers may be represented by letters. He finds too that 
these new symbols are often unknown in value, that the same 
letter may represent several different numbers, and further- 





3 


more that the symbol may at one and the same time represent 
many values, as for example A a Lw. The concept of general 
number is a far step from the particular or fixed numbers to 
which the child has been accustomed. It must be bewildering 
for him to find that this new symbol may perhaps represent 
many different values in the same discussion, in other words, 
that they vary. He is now confronted with two kinds of 
quantities or numbers - constants and variables. The distinc¬ 
tion between the two is not easy for him because it is not a 
matter merely of form but of use. That is, while all arith¬ 
metical numbers are constants, not all algetr aic numbers are 
variables. The ability to differentiate between algebraic 
constants and variables hinges upon the understanding of the 
basic concept of variability. This power develops slowly and 
requires careful teaching. And, because it is basic to a true 
understanding of algebra, teaching should be planned with a 
view to developing this power. 

To these new concepts - general numbers, unknowns, 
constants and variables - is soon, often too soon, added the 
further complication of directed numbers. Nov/ the plus and 
minus signs come to have a double use, - to indicate direc¬ 
tion as well as operation. It is not easy for the average 
pupil to grasp the meaning of positive and negative numbers 
although he may quickly learn to operate on them oy the use 
of 11 convenient 11 mechanical rules. Here again careful teach¬ 
ing will give added meaning to him. And so, step by step, 
the idea of number comes to have a wider and wider signifi¬ 
cance to tile pupil. 

Gradually the pupil begins to see numbers in their 

relationship to other numbers. He notes how one is affected 

by changes in related numbers; how, for example in A = Lw, 

A is affected by changes in L or w. He sees how quantities 

may be expressed in terms of other quantities due to this 

2 

relationship, as for example, L s A t w, or y » 2x 4 A. But 
these concepts of dependence and functionality develop slowly. 









4 


They call for abstract quantitative thinking through which 
the child must be led step by step. Indirect reference, in 
the early stages, whenever the occasion arises is preferable 
to attempts at direct teaching. 

The goal of meaningful algebra is in large measure 
a mastery of the underlying concepts - general number, 
positive and negative numbers, variability, dependence and 
functionality. Without an understanding of these the pupil’s 
mastery of algebra can be, at best, but a skilful mechanical 
manipulation of algebraic symbols. 


Basic Concepts Stressed 

In an endeavor to make Algebra more meaningful to 
the students, the course in Algebra One was interpreted with 
a view to giving particular emphasis to the following under¬ 
lying concepts, - general number, directed numbers, dependence 
variability, functionality. The first two are but extensions 
of the meaning of number. This leaves as the major basic 
concepts - dependence, variability, and functionality. The 
understanding of these hinges upon an adequate understanding 

of .generalized number and upon the ability to see numbers in 
r elation to other numbers . 

The Question which therefore arose was: In what way 
can an understanding of these concepts be developed and in 
how far can this be done in first year algebra? 


General Teaching Procedure 

A. Departures . Several departures were made from 
the traditional treatment of the subject as given in the 
prescribed text - High School Algebra, Crawford. Firstly, 
the approach to the subject by way of the simple equation 
was abandoned in favor of an introduction based upon the 
formula. The treatment of negative or directed numbers was 








c 


' 


























5 


delayed until the pupils had learned the fundamentals of 
algebraic language and symbolism, and had mastered the simple 
equation, and the four fundamental operations as applied to 
undirected mo.omial expressions. The amount of formal factor¬ 
ing was reduced and it was correlated with products, o t multipli¬ 
cation and division. Again, the lecture and class instruction 
methods were in some measure replaced by the individual study- 
assignment method. Devices such as cardboard models, diagrams 
and graphs were extensively used with an aim to adding con¬ 
creteness to the subject. 


General Teaching Procedure 

B. Mimeographed Assignments instead of Textbooks . The 
students did not have a textbook which, as a general practice, 
could be used as a source of exercise material. They were, 
instead supplied with mimeographed exercises treated as assign^ 
ments to follow the oral presentation. There were some topics, 
notably simultaneous equations and factoring - in which the 
authorized text, Crawford, was used as a source of additional 
practice exercises after the class assignments had been 
c ompleted. 

The mimeographed exercises were drawn up as individual 
assignments constructed in accordance with the aims of the 
experimental course. They were about sixty separate assign¬ 
ments in all. Most of these were used to follow up class 
presentation of a topic after the students had worked out in¬ 
troductory exercises from the board. Some were constructed 
as more or less detailed self-teaching assignments for the 
purpose of trying out the effectiveness of this method of 
teaching. This device was employed in treating the topic, 
type products and factoring. In the first case the mimeo¬ 
graphed exercises were treated in the nature of texts. Some 
were completed in single class periods, and collected. Coners 
were retained by the pupils until completed and used ioc class¬ 
room and home study. Always the assignments were collected, 






6 


marked carefully, then returned to the pupils for correc¬ 
tion, after which they were again collected. If there were 
still corrections to be made they were returned to the pupils 
as often as uncorrect items still appeared. 

When accepted the assignments were filed in individual 
folders at the office. A record was kept of the date when 
each assignment was finally turned in and accepted. A copy of 
this record was posted in each room in the hope that it prompt 
those who were behind in their assignments to make an effort 
to get them completed or corrected. 

These assignments were used as the basis for the arwt- 
hlysis of errors outlined in chapter eight. 

C. The Opening Period - The Rapid Short Dril l. An 
important phase of each lesson was the short period of in¬ 
tensive drill with which the lesson was opened. This occupied 
about four to six minutes of the teaching period, and usually 
consisted of ten to twenty items related to facts previously 
taught. Each pupil was required to have a scratch pad which 
he kept ready on his desk, and in which he entered his answer 
to the drill items. The items were either given orally or 
written on the board and the pupils were usually expected to 
do any computation mentally and to write only the answer on 
the pad. The answers were quickly checked, each pupil mark¬ 
ing his own work. Often % quick survey of the general grasp 
of a topic by the class was made by one of two means; either 
a count of the number of items each pupil had correct was 
obtained or a count of the number of correct answers made by 
the class on any item was taken. 

This drill device secured the attention of every 
member of the class and got the class working with a minimum 
loss of time. It also provided an effective scheme for re¬ 
view drills. Moreover it served as a quick indicator of 
the pupil’s grasp of previous lessons and showed where reme¬ 
dial or further teaching was necessary. 








CHAPTER 11 


INTRODUCTION TO ALGEBRA 

A Study of Nomenclature and the Language of Elementary 

Algebra 

I mportance of careful teaching of Algebraic Language . 

It is often said that first impressions are lasting. There 
is much truth in this statement whether the occasion be meet¬ 
ing new people, or a new school subject. A favorable impression 
stimulates the desire for further acquaintance. A carefully 
planned beginning removes initial difficulties and paves the 
way to success. Algebra confronts the student at once with a 
new language in the form of a new numerical symbolism, new 
forms of notation, and new technical terms. Before he can 
proceed successfully to the study of the various topics of 
algebra he must understand the nomenclature of the subject: 
Herein lies a likely source of difficulty in junior algebra, 
viz. insufficient grasp of the meaning of algebraic symbolism 
when the student is called upon to carry out various opera¬ 
tions with his new symbols. 

Very often, due to inadequate teaching of algebraic 
notation, exercises in algebra become mere manipulations of 
meaningless symbols and expression. They form at best 
interesting puzzles. The student has little or no conception 
of what the symbols mean nor why he does what he does, except 
that it yields the answer at the back of tfte book. He fails 
to see the close parallel between what he learned to do in 
arithmetic with particular numbers and what he is now asked 
to do with general numbers. As quantities are now expressed 
in terms of letters instead of figures this shrouds them in 
mystery. The result is that algebra is not recognized as 


7 
































8 


being Just tin extension of quantitative thinking and every 
bit as real as arithmetic. 

Adequate instruction in notation or symbolism should 
do much to avoid this feeling of mystery and to make algebra 
more meaningful. Upon the student's grasp of algebraic 
language largely depends his grasp of algetr ale concepts and 
upon the understanding of these concepts rests reality in 
algebra. 

With this conviction in mind emphasis was placed 
throughout the course upon the teaching and understanding of 
the symbolism. Review exercises, often of oral nature, were 
inserted throughout the year on algebraic language. 

The formula provided rnary natural opportunities for 
instruction in notation. The formula was in fact used as the 
pivot around which the introduction and much of the early work 
was centred. 


The Teaching of Algebraic Nomenclature - Out¬ 
line of Procedure followed 

The following descriptions are not intended as out¬ 
lines of lessons but as illustrations of suitable intro¬ 
ductory material and methods by means of which algebraic nomen¬ 
clature and language might be taught in an objective way. The 
suggestions are taken from the outlines of the early lessons 
used in the experimental course. Further discussions of 
algebraic language are found in the chapter on the formula. 

F irst Lesson , (a) A Short Talk on "Number", including 
the following:- what mathematics is; the branches of mathematics 
mathematics has to do with numbers or measured quantities; kinds 

of numbers-integers, fractions, decimals, a new kind of number; 

> 

its characteristics compared with arithmetic numbers; definite 
numbers and general numbers; what algebra is. 


(b) Discussion of statements containing algebraic 









9 


numbers, such as: 

A train is travelling r miles an hour. George is h 
inches tall. Henry h - 3 inches tall. The book cost 
c cents. Two books cost 2c cants. Bill has m marbles, 
his brother has n marbles; together they have m ♦ n 
marbles. 

The students were asked to supply other examples. 


Second Lesson . An illustrative talk on Algebra as a 

shorthand . This was introduced by a comparison of certain 

abbreviations and symbols. 

Abbreviations : Symbols : 

ft. lb. sec. U. S. A. f, X, % 

lit. col. mi. Km. 5, 10, iT , M, V. 

The importance of commercial shorthand, shorthand in chenistry, 

and shorthand in mathematics were discussed. 

An illustration: 


Arithmetic Statement 

The cost of any number of pen¬ 
cils is found by multiplying 
the number of pencils by the 
cost of one pencil* 


Algebraic Statement 

T = nc 

Where n Represents number 
of pencils; c, the cost in 
cents of each and T the 
total cost in cents. 


The Green and Brown Ruler; an Introductory Device . 

To proceed with the study of nomenclature an introductory 
device, the green and brown ruler was introduced in the next 
lesson. 

A common yardstick was taken and a double sheath made 
of green paper was placed around one half its length. One 
sheath would slide inside the other and hence the length of 
the ruler covered by the paper could be varied. This was 
shown to the class and as the length of the green part was 
altered, a series of questions, like the following were put to 
the class: 

1. How long is the brown part (the uncovered part) when the 
green part is 18 in.? 21 in.? 30 in.? If- ft.? 2 5 ft.? 

1.2 ft.? 

2. Can you make a rule for finding the brown part when the 
green part is unknown? 

3. If we let x ft. represent the length of the green part 
how can we represent the length of the brown part? 

4. May x represent any number? 

5. If the green part is y inches long how long is the cro .n . 

part? 
























'

. 































. ‘ - . . ... 
















10 


6. May y represent any number? (limits suggested) 

Such an exercise should lead the students to see 
that x is a general number representing in feet any length 
less than 3 feet. It need not be just 1 or 2 but any frac¬ 
tional number as well. Likewise in the expression (36 - y) 
inches, y represents any number, Integral or fractional, 
less than 36. The same applies to (3 - x) and (36 - y). 

They too are single numbers representing in one case lengths 
in feet and in the other, lengths in inches. 

The opportunity was taken to teach the significance 
of the bracket around 3 - x and the need of attaching the 
units. Thus, (3 - x) ft. and (36 - y) inches. 

The students were new ready to proceed to the next 
exercise: 

Write down the length of the brown part when the green part is: 
1 in., i in., r in., f ft., k ft., y yd., c cm., m mm., etc. 

The students were now ready for the full statement 
of the rule . 

In words: "'The length of the brown part in feet is 3, (the 
length of the ruler), decreased by the length of the green 
part in feet.' 1 

In the shorthand of algebra this is b: ft. = (3 - x) ft. 
where b represents the number of feet in the length of the 
brown part. The brevity of the algebraic statement contrasts 
strongly with the other. 

The students can now proceed with an exercise like 
the following: 

1. Write down the value of b when the green part, x, is 
n ft., w ft., etc. 

2. Write down the statement corresponding to"b ft. * (3 - x) 
ft." when the ruler itself is 2 ft. long; 6 ft. long; 

20 ft. long. 

3. If the ruler is 6 feet long what values may x have? 
may b have? 

In the statement, b fit. * (5 ** x) ft., can x be 3 feet*! 

Can it be 6 feet? What is the greatest po3o — >1® 
length of b? 


4 . 











11 


A further generalization can now he made if desired. 
For a green and brovm ruler of any length, "L ft.", the rule 
becomes b ft. • (L - x) ft. 

This statement should be examined carefully. The student 
should be led to see that: 

!• L may represent ary length within reason. 

2. x can never be greater than L. 

3. When x - L, b =0; when b = L, x = 0. 

Discussion should now be repeated when the lengths are in 
inches, and followed by an ejcercise like the following:- 
Write the rule when the lengths are in:- 


(a) 

Centimetres 

(answer expected. . .bcm = (L - x) 

cm) 

(b) 

Yards 

byd = (L - x) 

yd) 

(c) 

Metres 

bm * (L - x) 

m ) 


The student should now be ready for the formula 

b = L - x 

in which the units are understood. It must be emphasized 
that the units have not disappeared but they are understood 
and must be supplied when the formula is used with a given 
set of facts (measurements). 

It may seem to the reader that the above discussion 
relating to the green and brown ruler has been childish and 
unnecessarily simple or juvenile. But let him note that 
several significant concepts have already been suggested. 

Let us see what they are. The formula is a generalized 
very concise statements in which the units are to be supplied 
in any given case. Algebraic numbers are general numbers. 
They may be variables or constants. Thus in the rule 
b « (3 - x), b and x may have many values. Likewise in 
b * (L - x ), for a given ruler L is a constant, but x and b 
are variables. Again, it is suggested that the values of a 
variable may be restricted to a certain range. The aim has 
been kept in mind to keep the symbols meaningful, and in 
order to do so, in the beginning it is necessary to attach 
them to something concrete. Abstractions, or purely 

















I 






























12 


numerical generalizations, if made too early, cannot be 
grasped by the average beginner in algebra. 

Then, as other formulas were discussed these ideas 
and concepts were again suggested. The aim was to have the 
student come to regard algebraic numbers as general numbers 
which may take many numerical values. In other words, that 
most algebraic numbers are variables. 

At this point it was advantageous, too, to stop and 
stress that, x, L, b, (3 - x), (L - x), (6 - k), were all 

numbers just as were 3, 11, s, 2^, but with this difference; 

the former vary in numerical value. 

The Rectangle . The rectangle afforded another con¬ 
crete example for the study of nomenclature. 

Area of a rectangle = length X T/idth 
A * L X w 
A s Lw 

Suggested Exercises : What does A represent? L? w? What 
does Lw mean? [ans• product of L and w) What is assumed 

or understood? If L and w are in feet in what units is 

A? If L were in feet and w in yd. could we express the 
area as Lw? 

Conclusion : (l) L and w must be in the same units. 

(2) The area is expressed in SQUARE units. If L - 3 ft. 

and w = 2 ft. the area is. . . .? If the length is 4 ft. 
and the width w ft. how could you write the area? If the 
length were L ft. and the width 3 ft. how would ycu represent 
the area? 

This led to pointing out that in algebra the multri¬ 
plication sign, "x" , may be omitted. Tnus uiie pro^uco of 4 
and w is written 4w. Also, the numerical j.acuor is written 
first. Thus the product of w and 3 is written 3L, not L3. 
Exercise : 

1. Write the product of: a and b; a and 3; 5 an d n; -, b, 
and c; 3, 4, and r; 2-g- and x; s, 5* 

What does the following mean? 

3x, 4w, xy, nun, mn, 9tk.

5* Represent by diagram

4. Represent by diagram:

Thus 8x can be thought of as representing 
the area of a rectangle whose length is 8 
units and width x units.

Test Exercise #4, p 21, illustrates the use of 
tabular exercises. These are very useful because they are 


concise and self directive. 


The following type of tabular exercise is a very 
useful one to test the grasp of early notions of algebraic 
nomenclature.

Test Exercise #5 illustrates a manner in which the 
students’ knowledge of simple geometric relations can be 
associated with algebraic symbolism and the use of the 

formula. 


Test Exercise #4 is a review exercise embodying the 
contents of the first week’s teaching. The exercises, all 




























16 


related to the formula, are concerned with the first ideas of 
algebraic language and representation. 


Reading and Writing Algebraic Shorthand 

Pupils should not lose sight of the fact that Algebra 
is a shorthand. The symbols and groups of symbols should 
suggest a tangible meaning to the student. 


Drill exercises, like the following, inserted at 
intervals and progressing in difficulty will do much to en¬ 
sure better understanding of the algebraic symbolism. These 
exercises need only take a few minutes and provide a good 
form of review at commencement of lesson period. The two 
exercises, Words to Symbols, and Symbols to Words, are par¬ 
ticularly effective in teaching the meaning of algebraic 
symbolism.

Numerical Substitution - Evaluation of Formulas 

The evaluation of algebraic expressions by substituting 
numerical values for the algebraic symbols may be comparatively 
easy, but it does require teaching. Unsatisfactory results 
are frequent. They are due to the student's lack of under¬ 
standing of the algebraic expression and to inadequate .teach¬ 
ing and practice in this work. 

Errors are frequent in the evaluation of such ex- 

p ~Z O p 

pressions as 2a^, , 2(m - 3)", 3a(x * y), yz . 

However the most frequent cause of errors in subs- 
stitution is due to lack of skill in the ordinary operations 
involving common fractions. There is little time to remedy 
this in algebra, yet some instruction and review in common 
arithmetic operations with fractions seems necessary. Since 
substitution is the basis for verifying solutions of ecus.-

CHAPTER HI 


THE FORMULA - A STATEMENT 0? DEPENDENCE 
A. The Role of the Formula 

The formula is perhaps the most important fundamen¬ 
tal notion underlying all elementary algebra, it provides 
a natural entrance to the entire field. It demonstrates the 
shorthand nature of algebra. From it can be deduced the 
early notions of symbolism and nomenclature. From it the 
student can be led concretely to arithmetical substitution 
for algebraic quantities, to problem solving by algebraic 
methods, and to the solution of simple equations. From it 
the student can be led to the important concepts of varia ble 
and dependence . 

This basic relationship of the formula to the other 
topics of algebra is illustrated in the diagram below. 



It is clear that the formula cannot be considered as 
a separate topic in algebra out that it enters into several 
phases of the work. It deserves a more important part than 
is often given to it. 

In the present experimental course the treatment of 
the formula, though not restricted to any one part of the 
course, wa 3 concentrated at the beginning. The teaching of 


24 












25 


nomenclature, algebraic representation, symbolism, and 
interpretation of algebraic expressions were connected with 
the work on formulas. During the first term direct instruc¬ 
tion in the formula and related topics occurred in 13 out 
of 75 class periods. 

The use of the formula in the teaching of algebraic 
language has already been discussed in chapter 2. 


Abilities Involved in the Study of Formulas 

The abilities which require development in the study 
of formulas may be classified under five headings: 

!• Interpretation of Formulas 

2. Derivation of Formulas 

3. Evaluation of Formulas 

4. Transformation of Formulas 

5* The power to understand relationships contained in the 
formula. In other words, the power to recognize how the 
variables of a formula depend upon each other. 

1. Inte rpr etation of Formulas . To understand the 
meaning of a formula is basic to other abilities. The 
formula is a shorthand, symbolic statement of a mathema¬ 
tical rule or relationship. It is a statement of dependence. 

Consider D - rts The formula states that the dis¬ 
tance travelled by a body under uniform motion is the product 
of the rate and the time. Similarly with A » -|-bh, V s 
etc. The formulas used at least in the introductory work 
should express relationships familiar to or easily understood 
by the pupil. Good examples are those concerning the common 
relationships in mensuration. Graphical representation of 
simple formulas such as the travel, cost, and interest graphs 
add much to the understanding of the formula. The same is 
true of the graphs of such algebraic expressions as x , x, 

x, 3x ♦ 4. The student should be able to read all such 

2 

graphs correctly and intelligently. 




















26 


Exercises in writing formulas from word statements, 
and again translating formulas into word statements are 
good exercises for the interpretation of formulas. 

The following illustrates a good exercise on the in¬ 
terpretation of formulas. 


Writing Formulas and Algebraic Language 


Test No. 6 Fart 2 


1. (a) ..'rite a formula for the humber of days (D) in m 
weeks and 6 days. 

(b) Jack is 16 ye rs old. Henry is x years older. 

..'rite down Henry's age. 

(c) John is z years old and his father is five times 
as old. .7hat is the sum of their ages? .... 

(d) Write a formula for the number of cents (C) in n 

nickels and d dimes . 

(e) If the product of two numbers is A and one of 
the numbers is x, what is the other number? . . 

(f) Write the formula for the total number of cents 
C that N compasses cost at L cents each .... 

(g) Write a formula for the amount remaining (R) of 

d dollars after spending s dollars.. . 

(h) A motorcyclist travels y miles an hour for t hrs. 
Write a formula for the distance (D) covered. . . 


2. Remember that each of the above algebraic quantities are 
NUKBERS. Look back over the formulas and read them care¬ 
fully so as to tell exactly what each one means. 


3. Express in Algebraic Language: 

(a) The sum of twice a and three times b. 

(b) $15 more than x dollars . 

(c) The number of oz. in .7 lb. and 5 oz. 

(d) A number three times greater than N . 

(e) A number c less than d ...... 

(f) A man is y years old. How old was he 5 years 
ago?. . . .How old will he be 5 years from now? 

(g) The remainder after subtracting 3x cm. from 

2b cm. . 

(h) A man is B years old. His son is half as old. 

How old is his son? .

2. Derivation o f Formulas . Development of the 
ability to derive formulas from \ n or observed . t is im¬ 
portant because: 

1. It aids in the understanding of the formula and of the 
relation among the quantities or magnitudes involved. 

2. It gives confidence to the student, - confidence in him¬ 
self and in the reality of mathematics. 

3. It expresses the aim of the scientist - the desire to dis¬ 
cover a mathematical law which would describe the relationship 
°f the quantities he has observed. 

'This ability requires long development. However the 
student should be shown/simple formulas are obtained and be 
given exercises involving derivation of simple relationships 
from similar data. 

This phase of the work is frequently neglected. Per¬ 
haps it is due to the acceptance of the method or principle 
often expressed as follows. "Teach the HOW. Do not be too 
much concerned about the WHY." Hov/ever the "HC.. T " is not 
enough. True education must concern itself with the "WHY" 
above all. else. To be content with the HO,7 whether in 
science or mathematics is to reduce education to the level 
of learning a trade. 

3. Evaluation of Formulas . This phase of the work 
deepens the understanding of mathematical formulas. It was 
briefly discussed at the end of the chapter on Algebraic 
Language. If a pupil evaluates a formula correctly it is an 
indication that he understands the mathematical relation¬ 
ships involved, particularly if he applies it in a problem. 
Concrete application of a formula to problem situations is 
very valuable because it not only deepens his comprehension 
but adds interest. The following examples will illustrate 
tnis: 

Example 1. After the students have become familiar 
with the distance formula, D - vt, such questions as these 


will be of Interest:

go in 5 seconds? How long will It take this bullet to 

reacn a target 1200 ft. away? 

2. The velocity of sound is about 1120 ft. per second. 

How far will the report of an explosion travel in 10 
seconds? A boy hears the sound 3 seconds after he sees a 
man strike a post with a maul; how far apart are the two? 

3. Light travels 136,300 feet per second, it takes light 
from the sun 8§- minutes to reach us. How far away is the 
sun? 


gxaniple 2. The distance that a body will fall in t 
seconds is given by the formula s = l6t 2 where the distance 
S is given in feet. 

1. A stone dropped from the top of a high bridge strikes 
the water in 3 seconds. How high is the bridge? 

2 • How far will a body drop in i second? in 2-|- seconds? in 
10 seconds? 

Example 3. 3 s v 2 represents the height, S, in ft. 

64- 

u o which a body will rise when thrown vertically upward with 
an initial velocity of V ft. per second. 

1. A bullet is fired vertically upward with an initial velo¬ 
city of 1000 ft. per second. How high will it rise? 

2. Tom can throw a baseball with a velocity of 96 ft. per 
second. How high can he throw a ball? 

Many other striking exercises could be devised for 
these and other formulas. 

The following exercise was used as a test exercise 
at the end of the fourth month of instruction. The percer - 
tage of achievement was 80^ which means that the test presen - 
ted little difficulty. Most of the errors were due to mis¬ 
takes in manipulating simple fractions. The straightforward 
item Ho. 2 had the highest frequency of errors, though it 
merely involved the multiplication of 5* °y 10-g-.

tions often arise in

To obtain efficiency much 


practice is required in this.

This phase of the work may well be connected with 
the solving of equations. Transforming a formula is similar 
to solving a literal equation. However it seems to present 
additional difficulties. 

Teaching Hints: 

The early work might well be called "changing the 
subject of the formula." It can be introduced as soon as 
formulas are taught provided the examples are simple enough 
for the student to reason out the new relationship concretely. 
Example: After the formula A = Lw has been discussed the 
question can be raised: "if you know the area and the length 
how could you find the width?" A few numerical examples are 
helpful. Then the student could be asked to complete the 
formula:- w s and L « 

In the same way the student can be led to change the subject 

of formulas like A ^ s' r , P « 2L + 2w, D * rt, G =» 2 r,

5. Dependence : The Understanding.of Relationships 
G ontained in a Formul a. The most important and the most 
difficult of the abilities involved in the study of formulas 
is the power to recognize how the variables of the formula 
are related to one another. This power is identified with 
the concept of dependence, one of the three fundamental 
concepts of algebra. G-rowth of this power is slow. One 
might say that it depends to a large degree upon the matu¬ 
ration of mathematical thinking. Hence the teacher should 
keep in mind the aim of gradual development. No opportunity 
should be missed to correlate simple ideas of dependence 
with other work in algebra. 

Because of its importance this ability is discussed 
at greater length. Suggestions are given indicating some 
ways in which the opportunity can oe taken to insert discus¬ 
sions pertaining to dependence in the study of formulas. 
Following these suggestions a discussion is given upon the 
conclusions reached in the attempt to tea.cn —n~. develop '->ne 












31 


more elementary ideas underlying dependence* 


Dependence 

One aim of this experimental course was to obtain 
some indication regarding in how far the concept of depen¬ 
dence or related variables could be developed in a first 
year algeoi'a. class. In other words, in how far can the 
foundation be laid for the subjects of variation and func¬ 
tionality which are essential aspects of more advanced 
mathematics. 

Related to Formulas: 

This phase of the work was related to the work on 
formulas and the investigation of dependence was largely 
confined to quantities which appeared in familiar for¬ 
mulas and hence for which the pupil could visualize some 
concrete image. No attempt was made to introduce into 
the discussions purely abstract symbols and functions for 
it was accepted that these were beyond the grasp of the 
majority of first year Algebra students. After all, their 
powers of abstraction and generalization are very limited 
and the subjects of variation and functionality, for mastery 
do demand a degree of abstraction which leaves many third 
year algebra students bewildered. However the student 
should and can be introduced to the elementary notions under 
lying dependence. 

Importance of Teaching Ideas Underlying Dependence . 
The present writer has observed in his limited experience 
that algebra 3 students feel quite lost during the first 
weeks in variation, and has concluded that the study must 
begin with the discussion of a greater number of familiar 
relationships as expressed in simple formulas and from 
which the ideas of dependence can be more readily deduced 
than from the exercises in the text. Part of this might 
have well been done in the earlier units in algebra. The 
algebra 3 teacher does tend to assume that the student 












32 


already knows in an informal way at least the basic ideas 
underlying related variables and functions. However, in 
hi3 earlier mathematics the student’s attention has per¬ 
haps never been called to these in such a way that he has 
grasped their meaning. Variable quantities h ve been treated 
in a static rather than dynamic manner. How one quantity 
varies with another and how a variable may assume success 
sively a continuous set of values has not been deliberately 
noted or discussed. Propositions in geometry are deduced 
from fixed diagrams rather than from moving figures in 
which the student could observe the continuity of relation¬ 
ship as the diagram changed shape or position. 

Were the "moving figure" technique used in geometry 
and discussions on variation and dependence introduced when 
the opportunity presented itself in junior mathematics it 
should do much to remove the bewildering strangeness in the 
early work in algebra 3. 

In the present experimental course a deliberate 
attempt was made to teach the elementary ideas of dependence 
as existing between the variables of a simple function or 
formula. The following examples suggest ways in which the 
attempt 7/as made. This is followed by a discussion of the 
conclusions reached. 


Dependence - Outline of Lessons 
or Parts of Lessons Relating to Dependence or Functionality 

1. Introductory Lesson was based on discussion of the 

formula A s Lw 

Illustrative material: a cardboard, model whose length could 
be altered by sliding one piece over another, and blackboard 
diagrams. 

Such questions were raised.as: 

What happens to the area of the rectangle 
(1) as L is doubled? 

($) as L is increased four times? 













33 


(3) as L is halved? 

(4) as w is increased three times? 

(5) as L and w are hot,.: dou 

How does the area change as the length is incr< sed? (Area 
increases the same number of times.) 

These were repeated in the case of the triangle 
noting how a r ea depended upon the length of the base and of 
the altitude. 

A week later an informal quizz was given using such 
questions as the above. Nearly all the students responded 
correctly. The ideas were reviewed and extended to include 
such questions as: 

If the base of a triangle remains unchanged but the area of 
t^ e triangle is increased, a certain number of times what must 
have Happened to the altitude? If A = xy, what hap ens to 
A as x is increased? etc. 

3. The Square : A = s 2 ; p _ 4 S 

After considering several diagrams and numerical examples 
the pupils concluded: 

1. that as S is increased P is increased 4 times as much, 

= 4s; - 4(s ♦ 1) = 4s + 4 = P +-4 

2. that P varies as s varies; that as s is doubled etc. p 
is doubled. 

3. That A varies as the square of a. 

■ p 

That if x = x where Y represents area of a square and 
x its side, then Y varies as x squared. 

4. The Gircle : The pupils measured the diameter and 

circumference of several circular objects and calculated ( 

d 

to two decimal places. 

Conclusions: C depends on d 

C is always a fixed number times d f 

C varies in the same manner as d.

Review of Dependence In A = Lw, 

O 

Diagrammatic represent - tion that .re-, of circle is Ifl v 

Then several values assigned to r and corresponding values 

of A found. 

Observations: Area increases as the sou re of t.ie r tdius. 

A depends on r. 

2 

A varies as r' . 


6. The rectangular Solid : V - Lwh 

V Increases as L Increases or as w increases or as L in¬ 
creases. V Increases as the product of the increases in L, 
w, h. When L is doubled, V is doubled; when L and w are 

doubled V is increased four times; when L, w, and h are 

3 

doubled, V is increased 2 or 8 times. 


7. The Cube : This was first discussed with the use of 

models. 

Area is equal to 6 times the area of any face. 

Volume is equal to the cube of the length of any edge. 

Area depends upon the length of the edge. 

Volume depends upon the length of the edge. 

p p 

A varies as 6 e ; a varies as e . 

V varies as e^, or as the cube of e. 

Compare with H V H varies as the product of L, w, and h. 


8. The parallelogram : Observations of diagrams and 

collapsible model led to the conclusion that area depends up¬ 
on base and altitude and not upon she sic.o-s. 

Hence A = bh 
Vo.spared with A = -gbh.

Then questions were raised such as the following:

p 

*/hat happens to as x is increased? as y is increased? 

Find value of eacn when x - 3, y « 5, z = 0, e$c . 

Such questions were raised incidentally in passing 
in other lessons w here appropriate expressions iro:e. 

H• Graphs of Equations : The graphic 1 ap roach to 
equations in two variables gave an excellent opportunity to 
discuss how one variable is related to and varies with the 
other. 

The first equation discussed was x + y =10. The 
following facts were derived step by step. The equation 
has many solutions; it has an unlimited number of solutions; 
it has a series of solutions; x and y may take any value 
provided their sum is always ten; from the graphs, as x in¬ 
creases (moves to the right) y decreases (falls); as x in¬ 
creases in value y must decrease'. 

In x f y - 10, the students will quickly see that 
y increases and decreases with x. Any pairs of numbers ten 
apart in value will represent solutions of the equation. 

The co-ordi tes of all points on th graph of x t y a 10 
represent such pairs of numbers. The equation might oe 
compared with x = y +• "nd y = x + 6. 

To emphasize that an equation in two unknowns ex¬ 
presses the relationship or dependence between two variables 
such questions as the following were given, and in some 
cases written answers required. "What condition is placed 
upon the variables x and y in the equation x - y =6? 

2x + y = 6? x = 6 - 2y? y Ox - 15? x - y = 0? x + y = 0?- 

The pupils were led to understand that tne graph 
illustrates the relationship or aepenutnce l 1 '- . - . _ „ 













Conclusions: 


Definite objective measured were not obtained but 
some significant subjective conclusions were reached. 

Grade nine students can readily grasp the depen¬ 
dence of algebraic quantities in such expressions as fami - 
liar formulas where there is a concrete basis for interpreta¬ 
tion. They can grasp the elementary ideas of functionality 
through the graphical treatment of simple equations in two 
unknowns,' such as A « S 2 , P 4s, P « £<? + 32 ; x + y „ 10 , 

* = y, y = x - 6. 


The majority of students are unable to transfer 
these notions to abstract expressions unless the analogy .is 
clear. lo illustrate: After the ideas of dependence in 
such a formula as A = r 2 have been taught^ the pupils will 
readily reply to the question, "How does A change when r is 
changed?" that A changes (or varies) as the square of the 
radius. Also if they are given Y = llx 2 0 r A = z 2 they will 
see that Y varies as x"~ and A varies as z^. However if they 
ore given, for example, y = 5X", or y = x 2 + 2 , disconnected 
from any discussion of A = r 2 few pupils will see the 
analogy and be able to state how x and y are related. The 
pupils do not appear to be ready at this stage to generalize 
the notions of dependence. 


The following considerationsv/ould therefore appear to 
be advisable in the treatment of dependence in junior, mathe¬ 
matics in high school. 

1. The word should be concrete in nature. 

2. Any attempts at generalization should proceed by analogy 
from concrete examples such as familiar formulas; otherwise 
it becomes, at best, meaningless imitation. 

3. Such generalization cannot be carried successfully very 

far. 

4. The won: should be informal in nature with most of the 
formal language omitted.

5. The discussion should arise as incidental to other'worm 
and be Introduced when the opportunity arises. Such opportu¬ 
nities will present themselves, above all in the treatment 
of the formula, but, also in evaluating expressions - sub¬ 
stituting numerical values for algebraic numbers - in simple 
expressions arising out of fundamental operations, nd in 
the careful study of the equation in two variables which 
should precede the solution of simultaneous equations. 

The formula provides the basis for the most logical 
introduction of the ideas of dependence. This opportunity 
should not be ignored. Advantage should be taken of the 
possibilities in the graphical treatment of the equation in 
two variables and the graphs of formulas to broaden the 
concept of dependence and to make a beginning in the gen¬ 
eralized treatment of functionality. This treatment should 
then be carried further in a second course in algebra. 

A last word, - one should not be too optimistic 
and exacting of progress in this topic in a grade nine class. 













CHAPTER IV 
THE EQUATION 

A Statement of Relationship 

Ho teacher of algebra will deny that the equation 
provides a most useful tool in mathematics. Hot will he deny 
that like any other tool, whether in the workshop or in the 
scientific laboratory, proficiency in its use requires care¬ 
ful training and much practice. But whereas it may be quite 
adequate for a mechanic or a laboratory assistant in his work 
to use rule-of-thumb methods which he does not understand 
theoretically, but which he knows somehow give the correct 
result, it is not sufficient that a student know how to grina 
out answers mechanically. He should know why the tool, or 
the procedure, produces the result it does. Understandinr , 

rather than mechanical skill, is the goal which the teacher 

strive s his students to reach . Vfhether or not they do, re¬ 
mains a question. It is hoped that some students at least, 
will acquire both, ?/hile for the lower quarter the teacher 
may have to be content at best with mechanical mastery. 

The equation is a tool which easily lends itself to 
mechanical grinding of answers without appreciation of what 
the equation is and why the various steps are performed in 
its solution. 

It is of course necessary that the student be able 
to solve simple forms of equations promptly and correctly, - 
it is even desireable that he acquire sufficient skill to do 
this mechanically ~ but it is of fa.r greater educational 
value that he understand the meaning of each equation and be 
able to solve simple examples intelligently than that he oe

39 


able to grind out the roots of complex and infrequent types 
of equations which have no meaning whatsoever to him. 

The Equation: a Statement, of Rel itlonshlp . The 

equation is a statement of relationship between known and un¬ 
known numbers. This the student should appreciate. 

To illustrate: 

(a) 2x 1 4 ■ 10 should be seen as a statement such as: 

"Four more than twice a certain number is 10". 
or "Twice a certain unknown number increased by 4 is 10". 

The solution should then suggest itself as: 
twice the number is 4 less than 10, 
hence the number is one-half of 6. 

(b) l/3a a 15-The statement of relationship is: 

"One third of a number is 15"* and the solution - 
the number is 3 times 15* 

(c) 25 - 5x = 10. The statement of relationship is: 

"Twenty-five exceeds 5 times an unknown number by 10". 

The student might then think of the solution as follows: 

25 exceeds 15 by 10, 

hence 5 times the unknown number is 15, 
and the number is one-fifth of 15* 

The statement of relationship is a s tatement of 
equality . The student should understand that whatever trans¬ 
formations are made, the equality or balance must not be 
destroyed. 

It is in the problem that the statement of relation¬ 
ship is involved as the key part. It is the student’s most 
important task to express this relationship in terms of symbols 
in an equation. Hence it is logical that the problem precede 
the equation. One might well begin by obtaining equations 
from simple word statements. 

The formula should be compared with the equation. 


Thus in 1 r w - 4 F 
















40 


or, length plus width of a rectangle equals one-half the 
area,— i., w, and P may have many different values. 

If 1 = 8 and w , 6, we have 8 { 6 - Jp. 

The value of P is now fixed and is readily seen to be twice 
14. Or again if the perimeter is 36, 
the formula becomes L. } w = 18 , an equation with two un¬ 
knowns. The relationship expressed is that the sum of length 

and width is 18. The student will readily see that there 

pair of 

are now many solutions. Any/positive numbers whose sum is 
18 will satisfy the relationship. Anything more than in¬ 
cidental discussion of this type should be deferred until 
the solution of simultaneous equations arises. 

Thus the familiar formulas can be used as a basis 
for deriving simple equations which will have some concrete 
meaning to the beginner. 


Teaching Procedure 

A: Principles Accepted . The following principles 
were accepted as desireable for sound teaching of equations. 

1. Any formal work in equations should be withheld un¬ 
til the pupil has obtained an adequate grasp of the language 

o f algebra and an understanding of the fundamental operations 
with simple algebraic symbols or numbers. 

2. The introductory work should be concrete and informal 
with no attempt to present a formal procedure. Early ex¬ 
amples should be kept simple enough to enable the pupil to 
discover informally the correct value of the unknown. 

3. Technical terms should not be used until the pupils 
are ready to grasp their true meaning. It has been my ex¬ 
perience to find that many students do not see tne equation 
as a statement of relationship or equality , nor do they 
understand that 11 solving an equation means binding the 
value of the unknown for which the st3.tement of equality is 
true. Introducing these terms too early into the work only 













4l 


adds mystery. One should be reluctant to employ the term, 
"transposing" at all. 

4. Equations should be carefully graded in difficulty,' 

one type Introduced at a time and ample practice drill provided 
for each type. 

5* A correct and logical form of checking should be intro¬ 

duced early and its use insisted upon. 

B. Characteristics of Early Lessons . The following 
characteristics in the early work on the teaching of equations 
illustrate application of the above principles. 

The study of equations was not introduced until after 
the students had had a considerable amount of work in the 
language of algebra. This included reading, writing, and 
evaluation of formulas which constituted an important part of 
this early work. 

The introduction was made through simple problems 
which gave rise to equations that required solution and through 
problems involving formulas and leading to equations. Thus: 
What is the height of a triangle whose base is 12 inches and 
whose area is 48 sq. inches? 

formula is: A - ibh, Hence 48 =■ -| x 12 x h. 

Equation to be solved is: 6h= 48. 

Examples were kept simple enough to be solved informally, that 
is ; by inspection. "Finding the value of the unknown" was 
treated as a kind of game. 

The types of equations and the gradation of difficulty 
will be seen in the examples and exercises illustrated in this 
chapterv 


Transposing . This term was not used in the course and 
the pupils were not at any time taught to "take the expression 
to the other side and change its sign". This unfortunate and 
meaningless rule leads to much misunderstanding and confusion 
and to mere mechanical manipul-tion. 


Instead of this, the generalization - "whatever you do to 





, .. • .. 


f 







J 


')■ \ . 


















42 


one side of an equation you must do to the other" - was 

developed inductively from the analogy that the equation 

was like a see-saw or scale balance whose equilibrium must 

be maintained. Thus, whatever is added to (or subtracted 

from) one pan or side, the like amount must be added to 

(or subtracted from) the other side. This idea was readily 

extended to multiplication and division and the general- 

is 

izatlon given above made. This meaningful; transposing 
is not. 


Students soon discovered that adding or subtracting 
often amounted to transferring numbers from one side to the 
other and changing their signs. This avoided the teaching 
of mechanical transposition without the student grasping 
that it simply involved addition to, or subtraction from, 
both sides of the equation. 

Written form of Solution and V erification . After 
formal practice was begun in the solution of equations, clear 
correct forms of solution were demanded. Operations in¬ 
volving "transposing" had to be explained. 

Example: 7x f 9 5(x + 3) 

7x -i- 9 5x + 15 

Subtract 9 and 5x from both sides. 

2x= 6 

x =3 

Approved form of check is illustrated below. 

L. H. S. ~ 7 x 3 + 9 = 21 t 9 = 30 
R. H. S.= 5(3+3) = 5x6= 30 
The following incorrect, but common form of check was dis¬ 
couraged because it involves an error in logic. It assumes 
two things to be equal before they are known to be equal. 

7 x 3 + 9 = 3(-' + >) 

21 + 9 = 5x6 

30 = 30

. Content of Introductory Lessons 

First Day: Reading from the board type statements oi 
equality In several ways. 

Thus, type one*.- x * 5 = 9 

students read: x plus 5 is 9; a certain number Increased 

"by 5 is 9; five more than a certain number is 9 . etc. 
Similarly with types x - 6 = 4; 3x « 18 ; £x « 8 . 

These were followed by the question: "What is the unknown 
number." 


Second Day : The procedure was reversed. Students were 
to write in algebraic form dictated statements of equality sucn 

as: 

"Three times a certain number is 15." and 
"Three more than twice an unknown number is 11." The 
students were expected to write: 3x * 15 and 2x +3 = 11. The 
equations were then solved informally. 

Thus: 2x f 3 - 11 

2 x * ? 
x = ? 

It was pointed out t hat in all these statements the un¬ 
known had one value only and was contrasted with such previous 
expressions as: x miles/ hour; b = (L - x) feet; r 2 S; G- = S - C; 
A « LW; where the symbols may have many values. 

Third Day : A set of number problems were dictated and 
the students asked to write the statement of relationship in 
algebraic form using the given symbol. 

Some of the statements dictated were: 

A certain number,"x", increased by 4 is 10. 

Sight increased by twice a number "n", is 29. 

Twice a number,"n" decreased by 7 is 15* 

Sight decreased by a number, "r", is 2 
One and a half times a number, "y", is 6 . 

The resulting equations expected would be:

by the help of such equations as: If 7 less than twice n 
is 15, twice n must be how much more than 15? 

The following mimeographed exercise containin'; ex¬ 
amples of the various simple types was given out as seat- 
work. The students were expected to determine the correct 
value of the unknown by Inspection and trial. It will be 
noticed that in each case unknowns appear on one side of the 
equation only.

Example 1. 3x * 3 « 2x +- 9 

Question: Gan we alter the equation so that w e shall have tne 
unknowns alone on the left and the known 3 on the right? 
Subtract 3 from both sides. 

Hence 3x = 2x f 6 
Subtract 2x from both sides. 

3x - 2x « 6. 

Example 2. 9x - 24 = 5x - 8 

If we add what to 9x - 24 we shall have 9x? (**) 

We must add this amount (24) to both sides to maintain 
the balance. 

9x * 5x - 8 + 24 
9x - 5x = 5x - 5x f 16 
4x = 16. 

This led to the rules: 

"Whatever you add to one side you must add to the other." 
"Whatever you subtract from one side you must subtract from 
the other." , 

"if you divide one side by 4, (etc.) you must divide the other 
side by 4." 

The generalization "whatever you do to one side of an 
equation you must do to the other," was made later.

CHAPTER V 
PROBLEM SOLVING 

"Historically the problem preceded the equation, 
and in fact the equation was invented in order 
to solve the problem; the same sequence should 
be adopted in the class-room." 

C. V. Durell - in the "Teaching of Algebra" 

To develop proficiency in solving numerical problems 
is perhaps the most important function of the study of 
mathematics. It is the end product which the other topics 
should serve. Knowledge of the various processes in Algebra 
are not of great practical value unless one is able to apply 
them in a problem situation. 


Early Informal Work in Problem Solving 
The historical sequence, namely the problem as pre¬ 
ceding the equation and the equation evolving as a means to 
solve the problem was, in a measure, employed in the ex¬ 
perimental course. For instance, "think of a number" problems 
were used to give rise to simple equations. 

Thus for example: 

(1) Think of a number (n), add 12, (or multiply by 3, etc.) 
Write this in algebraic symbols. 

If the result is 36, state this in symbols. 

(2) I am thinking of a number, x, which when increased by 
15 is 27. State this in symbols. 

(3) Three more than twice a certain number is 21. Stated 

algebraically this is. 

(4) Write in symbols: Tom is twice as old as Jack. ---- 
sum of their ages is 24. 

The equations were left unsolved unless the answer appeare- 
evident. In the simpler ones the students discovered, ^ne 


48

49 


the value by trial. 

ilore advanced problems were examined and the relation 
ship expressed In terms of symbols. The need now arose to 
find the value of the unknowns - the symbols - In the state¬ 
ments of equality. This work led to a study of a systematic 
solution of simple equations. '.Then the student had gained 
some facility with equations, problem solving proper, was 
introduced. 


Technique in Solving Problems 

The teaching of problem solving should take cognizance 
ol two factors: first, the development of an effective problem 
solving technique, and secondly a careful selection of problems 
which will give the pupil a feeling of reality. The first will 
Coive t_Jie stuaent confidence and ensure a greater measure of 
success. The second will help to impress him with the meaning 
and value of mathematics through its touch with life. 

The most difficult phase of problem solving is without 
doubt, the analysis of the problem. The student must be able 
to discover the relationship between the given facts and the 
unknown quantities whose values are required and then be able 
to express this relationship in the form of an equation. 

Many students are defeated before they begin because they 
think the problem looks very difficult. They are at a loss 
how to begin. They lack a technique of attack, a way of 
analysing the problem. 

A Systematic M e thod of Analysis Employed . To meet 
the difficulty of analysis as far as possible, a special form 
was devised which set down the necessary steps in logical 
order and helped the pupil to analyse his problem. This 
consisted of a ruled form setting out in nine steps the algek 
\raic solution of simple problems. A printed copy of this 
form was given to each student and its use insisted upon during 
the first half of the year. Results would indicate that this 













- 
























. 






50 


procedure just i,f led itself as a valuable aid to early work 
in problem analysis and solution. 

A copy of the fora is given on the following page. 

In the first column the student names all the quantities 
mentioned in the problem. He must then underline the un-. 
knowns. In the second column he writes opposite each 
known quantity its numerical value and represents the un¬ 
knowns in terms of a symbol, or in other words, gives them 
an algebraic value. In the third column, as his fifth 
step, the student is required to state in a sentence the 
relationship existing between the knowns and the unknowns. 

This tests the student's grasp of the problem. This relation¬ 
ship is then written in symbols as an equation. Solution 
for all unknowns is insisted upon. In the fourth column 
the student interprets the results, thus answering the prob¬ 
lem. He is then left to determine if the values he has 
found for the unknown or unknowns satisfy all the conditions 
of the problem. 

After the first few lessons this was abbreviated by 
omitting the written statement of the relationship, namely 
step five. Students are reluctant to write long explanatory 
statements and before they can write the correct equation 
they must think through the relationship, anyway. After 
the first half of the year the form was further modified, 
the ruled form being abandoned and a set of steps to be fol - 
lowed, given. 


Teaching Procedure 

Using their exercise books crosswise the pupils 
ruled the page a.s directed into columns and wrote tne neact¬ 
ings of each column at the top. 

In the first lesson the pupils were first required 
to examine several problems and to determine the known -nc. 
unknown quantities. These were then written down in their 












HOW TO SOLVE PROBLEMS 


51 




































52 


appropriate column. Next they were required to represent 
the unknowns by algebraic symbols and to write down the 
values of the known quantities. Then followed an oral dis¬ 
cussion on relationship between the knowns and unknowns in 
the problem - after which it was written down in words. 

Then came the writing of the corresponding equation. 

In tae next lesson the solutions were completed by 
solving the equations, interpreting the results and checking. 

i?our consecutive lessons were devoted to this intro¬ 
duction to systematic problem solving. After this, one 
lesson each week was given to problem work until factoring 
was begun in March. 

The pro clems were carefully graded as regards 
difficulty. One or two new points only were introduced in 
any one lesson. The assignment each day contained problems 
of varying difficulty. The better pupils were directed to 
attempt the more difficult ones. 

The reader will note that in this procedure a defi¬ 
nite process of thinking was accepted as being conducive to 
success in problem solving. The ruled form was used to 
suggest to the pupil the steps involved in their logical 
order. 


The following steps were insisted upon in the early 

lessons: 

1. That each pupil rule his page into columns as directed 
and write the headings as given. 

2. That he perform each step regardless of whether or not 
any step appeared obvious. (This insistence was made 
to prevent getting into slipshod habits which would 
tend to increase the likelihood of going wrong in sub¬ 
sequent steps) . 

3. Interpretation of results and checking with given facts 
were stressed. This was done because there is a commonly 
observed tendency among students to stop after solving

the equation and hence to leave the problem unq/swered in 

n 

the strict sense. 

4. Incomplete work at any step was not accepted. 

The following two exercises reveal the nature of 
tne early lessons. The first of these was used as a seat- 
work assignment during the -third lesson. The other was 
given as a test on the fourth day. Both exercises were 
presented on mimeographed paper ruled like the type form 

on page (51). The pupils supplied each step in its appro¬ 
priate place. 


The weaker students were asked to do the first • 
three problems of the test, the others to do the last three. 
Analysis of the results showed that nearly all the students 
haa successfully solved the required problems and had 
perforinea uhe work neatly and completely. Without any 
douot the systematic form of analysis was in lar e part 
responsible for the very satisfying results. 


The Third Day Assignment : 

1. Divide #84 between Prank and Margaret so that Margaret 
shall have 6 times as much as Frank. 

2. One number is 13 more than another. Their sum is 310. 
What are the numbers? 

3. One number is 34 less than another, and their sum is 
1276. Find the numbers. 

4. Two girls made a profit of §3.90 selling lemonade. It 
was agreed that one should receive twice as much of the 
profit as the other received. How much should each 
receive?

^2 • The pupils too! ;he procedure kindly. 

After its features were explained only a few complained that 
it took too much time or space. 

ter a number ox lessons, - about three months after 
tne introduction of problem- solving - the following abbrevia¬ 
ted procedure, which did not require a ruled form was given. 
1. Head the problems carefully. Decide what are the knowns 
and unknowns. 

-• Represent the unknowns by algebraic numbers. (Use of 
clear statements to define the symbols was insisted.) 

3» Solve' for all unknowns. Interpret results. 

4. Check results back in the problem. 

The brighter pupils adopted this but the slower or 
duller pupils in general tended to revert to the first form 
after trying the abbreviated one. Later, they too were 
asked to accustom themselves to the shorter form. 

Without any doubt, the systematic or type form of 
analysis, formal as it may seem, proved an effective method 
for teaching a technique of problem solving. 

In appendix 3 are given some of the problem assign¬ 
ments used in the course. An examination of these will in¬ 
dicate the nature of the problems and their gradation in 
difficulty. 







CHAPTER VI 


GRAPHS 

Graphs originally belonged to higher mathematics. 
However in recent years their importance and range of 
application have become so widely recognized that graphs 
have been introduced into most of the elementary courses 
in mathematics. 

Graphs provide a means of representing statistical 
data in a concise, objective way. They are a powerful 
tool in the study of mathematical and scientific subjects. 
They provide a means of making abstract relationships con¬ 
crete. The aim of graphical study in high school mathe¬ 
matics should be to develop the ability to interpret 
statistical graphs, to develop their understanding to the 
point where they become a useful tool in scientific 
study, and to develop a mode of thinking which makes abstract 
relationships concrete. 

The attainment of the above powers requires a long 
period of development, a period which carries one from high 
school to the university. The role of a first course in 
algebra can be but to lay a sound foundation upon which 
these powers may be built and developed. 


Scope of Graphical T/ork 

At the time of this experiment graphs were not a 
part of the grade nine algebra course. However, as it was 
felt that graphs should enter into junior high school 
mathematics they were introduced into the work of one of 
the classes. 


55 









During the first term the work consisted, chiefly 
of a study of the common statistical graphs - the bar 
graph and the broken-line graphs. This included a study of 
tneir uses and characteristics, of precautions in their 
interpretation, and an acquaintance with th common graph¬ 
ical terms. The meaning and significance of i olation 
were discussed. A study of the simple travel graph was 
included and also the graphs of simple formulas such as the 
Interest formula, - I * 0.06P, as an example - and the 

Centigrade-?'hrenheit Conversion formula, F = £c + 32 . 

5 ~ 

Tne graph of a function was introduced during the 
second term in connection with the equation in two variables 
and in finding the simultaneous solutions of sets of equa¬ 
tions in two variables. The approach to simultaneous 
equations was infract made through graphical consideration 
in one class. Although this graphical work was largely 
confined to linear equations (or functions) a few others 
were considered in order to avoid the impression that graphs 
of all functions are straight lines. Two examples that were 

o p p 

used are: yr + y « 25 and y = 4x. 

The graphical work was done in graph books provided fer the 
purpose. 


Treatment of Statistical Graphs 

Two types of abilities require development in the 
study of graphs \ namely reading and interpretation of graphs, 
and secondly construction of graphs. Exercises in both 
phases of work were devised. It is doubtless more important 
that the student be able to read graphs intelligently than 
to construct graphs from a set/data. The first he is often 
required to do when he reads the daily newspaper or a 
scientific book; the second is seldom required of him in 
ordinary life. However the construction of graphs develops 
the power to interpret them correctly and in that sense is 











l , 
















is

important. 


Introduction . The student s shown < ':rnples of 

"bar graphs, pie diagrams (circle graphs) and broken-line 
graphs picturing familiar rel tionshlps. These were 
discussed and the students were led to the conclusion that 
graphs are mathematical pictures which convey information 
quickly, clearly, and concisely. Students re asked to 
interpret them, and to paste them in their graph books. 

Relationships Pictured . The first graph constructed 
by the pupils was a bar graph showing the average marks of 
the class in the various subjects, in the October examina¬ 
tions. The next one was a bar graph showing the temperature 
at two hour intervals on a certain day. In the third t ie 
same data were used to construct a broken-liae grrph. xP- 
stead of drawing bars whose heights would represent the 
temperature readings the height oi eacn bar was marked by 
an x and the adjacent x’s were joined thus forming a broken 
line. The two are illustrated belo. . 




These graphs provided an occasion for discussion 
relating to interpolation. Such questions were raised as:- 
Ma - we erect bars at intermediate points? 

Estimate the probable temperature at 9 a.m., at 1 
,,'hy is information at intermediate points uncertain? 

Another bar graph was drawn showing the temperature 
at several different places on the same morning. This served 
to Illustrate two points; that interpolation was inadmissabl 
and that the broken-line graph was unsuited for such c:f. 
















































53 



Graphs showing the growth of a plant ive a type of 
variation where interpolation is quite reliable and is of 
interest. The following data showing the height of a tulip 
at one week intervals was used in one of the lessons: 

Observed data: 

Date Jan. 3, 10, 17, 24, 31, Eeb. 7, 14 

Height li in. 2 in. 2| in. 4 in. ? 6 in. 7 in. 

Question: Jhat was the probable height on Jan. 31? 

Does the graph suggest any information regarding the 
height of the tulip on other days? 

Statistical data depicting the growth of an indus¬ 
try over a period of years offer good material for either 
bar or broken-line graphs. The water power development in 
Canada from 1912 to 1932 as given in the Canada year book 
provided an exercise requiring considerable thought in 
choosing a convenient scale on the axis. The students were 
taught to round off such numbers as 43,379, 456 tto the 
nearest millions. 

■Y hat the Student should have Learned : The exer¬ 
cises on statistical graphs taught the students the follow¬ 
ing points in technique: how to draw and label axes, how 
to decide the size of scale intervals, how to mark the scales 
without congesting them with too many numbers and to des¬ 
cribe their graphs clearly. They taught the students to 
interpret simple graphs which they might find in their 
reading. 


Travel Graphs 

Travel graphs are a step nearer to the graphs of 
formulas and functions. Their main value lies in their 
interest to the student and in the added meaning they 
give to the beginners* conception ot graphs. Two examples 
are given here of the exercises used. 

Example 1. Mr. Jones starts at noon from a town A, to go to 
another town 3, 120 miles away. -ne graph below indicates 
how he travelled. Study it and answer the following

questions. Check each reading of the graph. 

1. How far from A was Jones 

at 1 p.m.? at 2 p.m.? at 
5 p.m.? 

2. How far away was he when 
he made his first stop? 

How long did he stop? At 
what time did he resume 
his journey? 

3. .Then and where did he 
make his second stop? 

4. d'hat was his average 
rate of speed over the 
entire journey? .That was 
his actual travelling 
time? 

5. .There was he at 4 O'clock? At what time did he reach 
his destination?

Eaxample 2. ; r. Smith starts from Edmonton at noon and 

travels south. His speedometer indicates the following 
distances from Edmonton at the times indicated. 

Time: 1 p.m. 2 p.m. 3.30 p.m. 4 p.m. 

Distance: 30 mi. 60 mi. 105 mi. 120 mi. 

Draw the probable travel graph assuming that Smith 
made no stops, tfith the aid of your graph answer the 
following questions. 

1. How far was Smith from Edmonton at 2.30? at 5 p,m.? 

At about what time was he 100 miles from Edmonton? 

2. Suppose that a Mr. Brown starts south ot 1 o'clock 
and travels at a steady rate of 45 miles per.hour. 
Where will he be at 2 o'clock? at 4? at 5? 

Draw the graph to show Brown's journey. 

3. At what time will Brown overtake Smith? Hot/ far from 
Edmonton will they be then? 


Graphs of Formulas 

Algebraically the graph of a formula is important. 

It represents to the pupil in a manner better than any words 
can convey the relationship between the variables involved 
in the formula. It shows how the value of one variable 
determines the value of the other; in other words, how one 
is dependent upon the other. The graph is a tangible representa¬ 
tion of dependence and variations. In the examples considered 
in the course it was tried through discussion and suggestion 
to create in the pupils some grasp of these concepts as 
represented by these graphs. 


The following examples suggests the relationships 


discussed.

I n t roductory: The g asoline .•■rap h. At service sta¬ 
tions you may have sometimes seen the vendor consult a 
graph to determine amount of a customer's bill. 

Suppose gasoline is selling at 32** a gallon. The cost of 
ilny number 0 ' gallons is given by the formula T * 32-^n. 


By substituting values 2, 4, 6, 8 , 10 for n, we obtain 
the following table of values: 

No. of gals, n, 2 4 6 8 10 . 

Total cost, T .65 1.30 1.95 2.60 3.25 

By plotting these values a graph is formed by connecting the 
plotted points. It is a straight line. 


Questions based on the graph: 

1. Read from the graph to the nearest five cents the cost 
of three gallons, 5 gals., 2 1/5 gals. 

2 . when a certain customer's tank became full the station 
metre indicated 5 7/l0 gallons. What was the amount of the 

bill? 

3. How much gasoline could be purchased for §1.00? for §2.5u? 

4. If the price fell to 30^ a gallon could you draw a new 
line from which the vendor could read the amounts of pur¬ 
chases at a new rate? 

5* State in words the law connecting T and n.

much interest as it indicated how they could very readily 
find equivalent readings by means of this graph. An attrac¬

CHAPTER VI1 


SELECTED TOXICS AND METHODS 

section 1 : directed Bumbers 

As previously stated, the teaching of directed 
numbers wa delayed until the students had studied the 
simple equation and the four fundamental operations with 
undirected monomial expressions. It was thought unwise to 
complicate further the early work in introductory algebra 
introducing negative numbers near the beginning. The 
essential ideas of algebraic language and algebraic opera¬ 
tions can be taught by considering algebraic numbers to be 
like ordinary arithmetic numbers. 

Directed numbers were first introduced in the forty 
seventh lesson or more than two months after the beginning. 
An outline of this lesson was as follows: 

1. A talk on our number system. 

-• Our signs ( + ) and (-). Their names and meaning. 

3. Illustrations: Temperature above and below zero. 

Gains and losses in stock prices. 
G-ames- wins and losses. 

4. Nomenclature: (a) positive seven (+7) 

(b) negative six (- 6 ) 

5* A number scale was put on the board. 

-+ 3 

_ ±_± _ __? 

• a *_*_■_._i-»—---—i-1-1-■_a_ * _• 

-s' -H- -3 -A. -V 9 + • + *■ -V + 3' -V 

With the use of this scale the students added orally such 

sums as #■4 f4 -4 -4 

+3 -3 +3 -3 

reading the answer from the scale. 

Thus, starting always from zero, (+4) means 4 units up, 
or to the right; (+3) means 3 units further to the right. 
Hence the sum is Similarly (-7) means 7 units to the 

left. The sum of +4 and (-7) is illustrated by: 


62 















































In the next lesson further illustrations 
of negative numbers as ap lied in ordinary life w 
Simple addition with the aid of the number scale 
tlced. The use of algebraic numbers like (+2a), 
etc., were introduced. These were added with the 
following number scale.

+ 2<L +30- 


The students were supplied with the two scales mimeo¬ 
graphed on a sheet of paper. They could then use these to 
find the sums to examples given. The directions given were: 
Start from zero point on scale. 

A positive number indicates that you must move to the right; 
a negative number indicates movement to the le ft. 

To illustrate again: (•►5a),4 (-3a) + (-4a) 



//«. O ^<3, 


Hence the sum is (-2a). 


Subtracti on: The subtraction of negative numbers was 
approached in a most elementary manner. The number scale was 
used in all the early examples. The additive wording was 
adopted in all the illustrative examples. 

Thus for (47) - (-3) 

The problem was considered as: "Jhat must be added to (-3) 
to get (+7)?” The answer is found from the scale as follows:- 


->+/>£> 


->1 


- v 


-z 


- / 


+ 1 


*3 


Locate the Subtrahend (-3) on the scale. Kext locate tne 
minuend (-7). Note in which direction ^(positive or negative) 
and how far, (-7) is from (-3)* Or, "in what direction, 



































64 


h0W far must 1 move from (-") to (47)." 

answer is (flO) or, ten step* in the positive direction. 

A considerable amount of practice in simple subtrac¬ 
tion by the use of the scale was given. The scale was 
dropped when the majority of students felt that they no 
longer needed it. 

The common rule: "To subtract directed numbers 
change the sign of the subtrahend and add" wa not intro¬ 
duced until the majority of the class had discovered it for 
themselves. 

The chief difficulty in addition and subtraction 
arose out of the confusion of (♦) and (-) as signs of opera¬ 
tion with their use as signs of direction. This arose when 
the signs of direction for positive numbers were dropped and 


assumed to be understood.

For example, 

in the

(-5a) - (- 6 ) =

- (-9) - 

-3 - ( 

(-8* - 13 = 

j 

11 = 

2 

- 24 * 

(-7) - 


There were very few errors in the answers for the first row, 
but several students gave wrong answers to exercises of the 
second row. The errors were due to taking the subtraction 
sign as also the direction sign of the s econd number, the sub¬ 
trahend, and hence giving answers as + 10 , +14, +26, and + 1 . 

In the remedial exercise it was pointed out - 

(1) that the connecting sign must indicate the operation, 

( 2 ) that if there is no other sign before the number it is 
understood to be positive. Oral drill then followed with 
questions such as the following. In (- 8 ) - 18, is 8 positive 
or negative? is 13 positive or negative? why is 18 positive? 

An exercise was given in which the signs of operation 
were marked in red 

7- (-7) = -3 - 14 r 2—20 = -3+7 = etc. 

The results were tested by another written exercise.

The following exercise is given here for what it 
may be worth. Its aim is to give a concrete ilrastr^.xon 
for multiplication of directed numbers.. 

An aeroplane is flying southward at the rate ox r 
miles per hour. It passes Edmonton at noon. Let us tare 

















































67 


tills as representing zero hours and consider time forward as 
positive and time backward as negative. Thus, one hour be¬ 
fore reaching Edmonton is represented as (-1) hours. If the 
plane is D miles north of Edmonton, t hours past the ze 
hour, then D s ft. 

Exercise : 

1 * -/hat meanings do you ive to D s -50? to D = -100? How 
would you represent 100 miles south? etc. 

2. How do you interpret r •♦100? r « -100? If the plane is 
moving northward its velocity is (positive or negative)? 
How would you represent a speed of 75 miles per hour 
southward? 

3. Interpret the formula D « rt, when: 

(a) r =• +120 and t r fs (c) v - +100, t * -2 

(b) r = -140 and t = +3 (d) v = -150, t = -1 

4. Hence what is the position of the plane from Edmonton in 
each case? 

Example : If r r -70 nd t = -3. 

The plane is travelling south at the rate of 70 mile3 an 
hour, and time is 3 hours before reaching -idmonton. D s rt 
becomes D - (-70)(-3) = +210. This indicates that plane was 
210 miles north just three hours before noon, or at 9 a.m. 


From these examples the conclusion is reached that: 


(+120)(+5) = +600 
(-140)(+3) = -420 


(+ 100 )(- 2 ) = -200 
(-150) (-1) = 4-150 


Hence

came to the conclusion that the product would be negative 
whenever an odd number of negative factors occurred.

for question number 11 the average achievement was 8l per

average student’s ability to grasp abstract rel tionships and 
demands a form of thinking to which he is unaccustomed. Any 
devices which help to give the beginner a concrete illustra¬ 
tion or interpretation of algebraic processes are useful and 
desireable. 

Geometric diagrams provide a convenient way of ill*s- 
Wtrating processes in multiplication and for pointing out 
certain types of errors. Some of their uses are suggested 
below. 


1. To illustrate multiplication : The device con¬ 
sists of considering the product of two factors as an area of 
a rectangle, the factors representing the length and width. 

Thus, product of w and x + y + z can be illustrated as:- 
x «■ y + s 


w 


of 2x and (x +• 2y + 3) as 


x

= 2x 2

Such diagrams illustrate how every term in one factor 
is multiplied by every term in the other.

2. To illustrate the error in combining terms like b, o , b t 
which are sometimes combined as lime terms oj c.releoo 


ing is 

helpful.

3* To correct the early errors of the type 3a X 2a * 6 a, 
the process can be Illustrated as follows:

To Illustrate why every term within a bracketed quantity 

must be multiplied by the factor outside, as for example:

and hence is 3 a + 3 b

or 3 (a + b) can be pictured as,, the sum 

of two rectangles 3 a and 3 b.

relationship between muliplication, division, and factoring.

As Taught by the Study-Assignment Method 


In the older textbooks Including our Crawford's 
Algebra factoring Is given considerable importance. It 
occupies from about one quarter to a third of the course, 
and is treated in one or more separate chapters much like 
simple equations. 

However educational writers on algebra have very 
little to say about factoring as a topic by itself. ,7hlle 
they not belittle its importance they discuss factoring 
only in its relation to other topics into which it enters. 
They believe that factoring is not best taught by lumping 
ib all together. Rather it should be treated as need 
arises in its connection with multiplication, division, frac¬ 
tions, solution of equations, and other topics. Factoring, 
they emphasize, should be taught in distinct subordination 
to its applications. 

This point of view was accepted as sound. However 
it was not convenient in the experimental course to put this 
into practice completely because the existing requirements 
in grade nine algebra had to be met. Factoring was taught 
rather as a separate topic correlated with products. Some 
of the more difficult types which rarely occur elsewhere 
in algebra were omitted. The close relationship between 
multiplication, division, and factoring was kept in mind and 
referred to repeatedly. Multiplication of binomials and 
trinomials was reviewed and extended and practical applica¬ 
tions of factoring noted. 

Treatment of the Topic : The topic of factoring 
correlated with type products was chosen for the purpose of 
trying the effectiveness of the Assignment-Study Method of 
Instruction. Hence the section on factoring was lrgely 
taught by use of individual self-teaching assignments. 1 


1. See Appendix G 



















75 


Class teaching was employ . le introduction, in sections 

which required more illustration \nd e::; .nsion th n was 
provided in the study outlines, and in sections where general 
class difficulty was noted. Most of the te 5her's ti w s 
devoted to supervision and to giving Individual ssi3tance 
where necessary. 

Geometric representation was used to illustrate 
type products and to show the relationship between multipli¬ 
cation, division, and factoring. For example, when the stu¬ 
dents were studying squares of binomials and trinomials they 
were told to keep before them the following diagram as an 
aid in writing down the products correctly.

When the student completed an assignment he turned 
it in for correction. After he had corrected any errors 
which he may have made he was allowed to start the next 
assignment. Students who were far ahead in their work were 
suggested additional exercises from the text. 

Four printed assignments were used in all. These 
covered most of the work required in factoring. 

To illustrate the nature and form of the self-teach¬ 
ing assignments used, s copy of the first assignment is 
given in Appendix C. 


S ommeats : 

Diagnostic testing revealed that the majority had 
obtained, a satisfactory grasp of the topic. However it had 
not proved adequate to weaker uninterested pupi-s. It 
hoped that the new method would bring renewed interest to 
















76 




the shiftless section of the room 15 class and thereby 
bring the two classes closer together. The reverse 
occurred. Results in room 16 were much superior. The 
pupils worked with evident Interest and appeared anxious 
to complete their assignments as quickly as they could. 

In the other room those who had shown little inclination 
to effort before, showed as little desire to think through 
the exercises in the assignments. Consequently more class 
teaching had to oe done in this class than in the other 
and less time was available for individual assistance. 

No conclusive results were obtained regarding the 
relative merits of this form of instruction. However the 
following points were in evidence. It allows for individ¬ 
ual differences. It provides a challenge to the good 
pupils uO do additional work. However this should be 
presented in a manner which will arouse their Interest and 
should suggest some new angle to the work. The method 
makes possible more assistance to the weaker section of the 
class who benefit more by individual instruction than by 
class teaching. It provides for a greater amount of 
active participation on the part of the pupil. 

The method is discussed at greater length in the 
next section In connection with another investigation. 


Section 4: The Individual Assignment Study Method 
of Teaching 

In an attempt to determine further the effectiveness 
of the individual assignment-study method an investigation 
was undertaken the following year, 1936 , in a rural school. 
The topic chosen as the basis for the study was again Type 
Products and Simple Factoring. The investigation occupied 
a period of six weeks from February 15th to March 27th. 

This consisted of five one-half hour class periods per week. 

One half of these were confined to independent study. 

During the other half the teacher was available far- 


teaching, 









supervision, or consult tion. 


The suojects were a grade nine class of ten pupils, 
six boys and four girls, in the one room rural high school 
of East Glover Bar. The average chronological age of the 
class was 15.4 years, the average I. Q., 105, and the av¬ 
erage mental age 16.1. 

0 f* 

The basis of evaluation was the average/five diagnostic 
tests given at intervals on work covered in the assignments 
as compared with the average of the October and December 
examinations in Algebra. The tests were given as follows. 

One upon completion of each of the three main assignments, 
one at the end of the investigation period and the fifth two 
weeks later. During this interval the class studied simulta¬ 
neous equations, a topic quite unrelated to factoring. The 
fifth test was designed to determine *retentivity or mastery 
of the topic. 

The Procedure was similar to that followed at G-arneau. 
The multiplication of binomial factors had been omitted during 
the study of multiplication and division. 77hen the occasion 
arose during some problem work which required the square of 
two binomials and the product of two binomials, this occasion 
was used to direct the pupil£' attention to the need of 
studying how these products could be obtained. From prol- 
ducts they were led to.the reverse process, factoring. In 
the introduction the geometric approach was used. (Geometric 
illustrations were used extensively during the whole 
investigation. (Their use has been discussed previously in 
this chapter.) 

After the first three lessons very lit ole class 
teaching was done. The teacher's time was spent in supervi¬ 
sion and individual instruction. 

To make conditions more nearly like those prevailing 
under ordinary teaching, the pupils were not told that this 
was an experiment, nor at any time urged to do tneir }

* Subjects 4 and 6 were repeaters in algebra. 

^Subjects 3 and 5 were absent from the class discussion relstin 
to assignment one. The students are arranged in the order of 
their mental ages. 

Comments and Estimate of Results: 

1. The cl verage for the five tests was the same 

class average for the October ana December examination^, .—• 
74.6 and 74.4. Though this may be considered a mere coin¬ 
cidence, yet it would appear that the assi.-nmen j thod w^o 
equally effective when coopered with teaching methods. At 
























































79 


least the pupils obtained a good average mastery of the facts 
presented. 

2 . Moreover, it would appe r that the facts were learned 
the point of mastery where they would not be quickly for- 
tten. This Is sug ested by the fact that the average score 
for test ho. 5 which compares with test . 3 n type of 
question and degree of difficulty is not lower, but somewhat 
higher than the score for test No. 3, or SO. 7 as comp red 
with 78.3. This is ather striking for there was an Interval 
of two weeks between test No. 3 and No. 5 during which there 
was no reference to products a., factoring. The topic, 
simultaneous equations, was deliberately taken at this time 
because it offered'a type of work quite dissimilar to 
polynomial products end factoring. 

The indication of good retention should be evidence 
esting oast considerable and attentive prctice had been 
supplied by the assignments. 

All pupils were able to follow the instructions in 
the assignments (when given some aid by the teacher) as there 
were no failures. It is somewhat striking that the four 
pupils of least ability received average scores above their 
average in the two regular examinations by 8 . 6 , 4 . 8 , 3 . 0 , 
and 1.6 per cent respectively - while the three of highest 
ability received average scores lower than their examination 
average - by 4.6, 3.0 and 3.4 per cent respectively. 

This would indicate that the weaker pupils derive 
more benefit from the assignmental directions which they can 
study at leisure than they do from class teaching directions. 
The reverse is indicated in the case of the better students. 
This latter might be due to lack of interest or lack of 
application. 

It was observed that the weaker pupils revealed 
greater interest and zeal in the assignment work than did the 
two boys of high mental ability. 








4. 


The Assignmen t-Jtn '.v Let a nd .tt.lt. .id', . All 

pupils lined the method of assi ; _nment-stud v . No one admit¬ 
ted any diss ticf ction with it. Four preferred this 
method to the ordinary class procedure, four had little or 
no preference, while two, (Subjects 1 2) preferred 

class teaching with textbook exercises. 

The preference may of course be due entirely to 
the novelty of the scheme and not to apy inherent appeal 
which it might have over ordinary teaching methods. 

Subject number 5 whose stron^ preference h'd been 
History and French and who had been rather indifferent to¬ 
wards mathematics declared that she was quite fond of al¬ 
gebra under the new way. 

Subject number 3 preferred this method because he 
could understand the procedures better, He had more time 
to examine each step than he did when the procedures were 
presented by the teacher at the board. He was a very slow 
working student. 

Evaluations of the study-assignment method of 
teaching are given in chapter nine. 








CHAPTER VI11 


analysis of pupil errors. 

An analysis of pupil errors was made with the follow¬ 
ing objects in view. 

(a) To determine the relation between frequency of errors 
and I. s,. 

(b) To note what types of items give greatest difficulty. 

(c) To note how relative difficulty of jhe items affects the 
achievement between students of different abilities. 

For the purposes of this study the students were 
divided into three groups according to their I. ratin'. 

The groups were as follows.

The study is based upon the analysis of pupil answers 

to: 

(a) Diagnostic Test in the Fundamentals of Arithmetic 

(b) October, December, and master Examinations 

(c) Diagnostic Test in the Fundamental 1 Operations 

(d) Several Tests on various phases of Algebra One. 

(a) Diagnosis of Pupil Abilities in seme common a p lica - 
tions of Arithmetic . Algebra is in large part an extension of 
the four fundamental operations of arithmetic. Therefore if a 
student is weak in these he is unlikely to succeed in algebra. 

To determine the abilities of the pupils in arithmetic a diag¬ 
nostic test involving essentially fractions and lecinals was 
given at the beginning of the term. The results surges t>ed the 
need for remedial work, exercises were therefore revises, to

There is no gre't difference in the achievements of 
tne three groups. Group A exceeds B by 9 $ and group B ex¬ 
ceeds group C by 2.8$. Weakness in th fundamental processes 
of arithmetic is therefore not restricted to students of in¬ 
ferior ability but is rather evenly distributed among the 
entire pupil population. This is somewhat unexpected since 
the pupils do reveal astonishing weakness in the simplest 
operations witn arithmetic and hence the uniformity cannot 
be claimed to be due to mastery on the part of all pupils. 


'The answer may lie in the fact that practice and 
^.rill raoner than ability determine in large measure the 
mastery of fractions and some pupils may have had more 
training and practice than have others. 

It is significant that in subsequent exercises 
wherever fractions appeared in algebraic work the degree 
of difficulty was suddenly and appreciably increased. In 
fact the greatest single cause of errors was found to be - 
as is revealed in this test - inability to add, subtract, 
etc., simple fractions correctly. (Note the poor results 
for the items in Nos. 1, 2, 3*)

Summary of Results: Group A Is consistently 
superior in each type of operation. Group C however ex¬ 
ceeds group B in several Instances. In the October examina¬ 
tion it exceeds group B in the fundamental operations and 
equals it in substitution. nio 1 

operations, language uid formulas, group B is distinctly 
superior to group C. In the October and master examinations 
the greatest spreads were in language, viz., 12.5$, 25 . 8 $, 
34. 1$ nd lS.3p, 32.5$ and 40.8$. This suggests that where 
understanding rather than manipulation is required, there 
innate ability is a determining factor in achievement. In 
the more mechanical operations the more diligent inferior 
pupils may surpass potentially more capable ones. 

(c) Diagnostic and Review Test on Fundamental 
Operations . This test was so designed that it could be used 
twice. The items were placed in the middle of the quest4on 
paper and answers could be written on either side. First 
trial of the test was made on May 9, shortly after a general 
review of the course was undertaken. Second trial took 
place two weeks later. Remedial teaching followed the first 
trial. This included an assignment of practice exercises 
designed to corre'ct the more frequent errors as revealed in 
the test. The correct answers were given on this assign¬ 
ment with the hope that the student would- check his work 
and seek to find how the results are obtained. Some stu¬ 
dents did this diligently. Others neglected to do and study 
the assignment. The results of the retest be r this out. 

The diagnostic test together with tae number o^ incorreco 
answers made by each group on each item is given o~lo.« f .

CHAPTER IX 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

Tae aim of the experimental course which has been 
discussed in this thesis has been to give an interpretation 
to the course of studies in Algebra One which would make 
tne subject more meaningful to the student. The preceding 
chapters have outlined the manner in which two experimental 
classes were taught in an attempt to’attain this aim. The 
development of basic concepts, including the understanding 
of general number, dependence, variability, and function¬ 
ality - was stressed rather than the development of the 
ability and skill to manipulate symbols and to "grind out" 
answers to intricate "puzzle" Questions. The content and 
presentation of each of the major topics of Algebra One was 
organized with the view to promoting this end. Exercises 
and methods have been suggested which are designed to 
emphasize the meaningful side of algebra. 

The introduction is discussed at greater length 
because it is here that the foundation for tie concepts which 
it is aimed to develop should be laid. The formula served 
as tne keystone to the early work in which the objective was 
to develop an adequate grasp of algebraic language and an 
appreciation of algebraic symbols as just another form of 
numbers. Haste was made slowly. Equations, directed 
numbers, complicated expressions and operations were de¬ 
layed until the pupil had learned to use and tre't alge¬ 
braic numbers similarly to ordinary arithmetic quantities. 

The formula, considered as a statement of depen¬ 
dence, introduced a means of suggesting to the pu; il this 
important concept and provided for discussions related to

dependence and variability. The graph of-the formula 
provided further opportunities for develo.'ln these con¬ 
cepts. The Equation was taught as 6 b of Relation¬ 

ship between known and unknown numbers. The relationship 
enabled one to find in many cases the v lue of t: o unknowns, 
in other words to solve the equation. 


For problem solving a definite technique of anal¬ 
ysis was devised which helped to load the pupil to t link 
through his problem step b\ step in logical manner. This 
scheme proved itself to be an effective means for teaching 
pupils how to solve problems algebraically. It , ave them 
a method for attacking a problem and a neat concise form 
in which to exhibit the solution. The relative high per¬ 
centage of correct solutions, even among pupils of inferior 
ability, to whom problems frequently present formidable 
difficulties, is an indication that the technique justified 
itself. A possible objection to the method is that it may 
develop a set, stereotyped form of solution which may not 
be applicable in all problems. 


Graphs. G-raphs add interest and meaning to the work 
in Algebra. Graph work was commonly taken during an extra 
period ‘iven dednesdiy afternoon and wnicn many s->uienuS 
felt was rightfully a spare period. The eagerness with 
which the students nevertheless awaited the next graph peri¬ 
od was evidence of the interest it held for onem. G-vs.^ io of 
formulas and functions are invaluable as an =ia ^ concrete¬ 


ness in developing the b'Sic concepts of algebr , namely; 
dependence, variability, and functionality, ihe i 

presents to the students a picture of the continuous relation¬ 
ship between two variables, a picture of dependence between 

variable and function. Though it is -o ex± 

grade nine student to grasp the full significance of the 
graphical representation of a function, yet he can under¬ 
stand something of this method of representing mathematical 


relationships.

The graphical approach to simultaneous equations 
was more satisfactory as judged by the difference in re¬ 
action and results between the two classes in one of which 
the graphical work was omitted. The Luable

an indefinite number of solutions, a continuous series of 
solutions. Again tne me .. of the simult neeous solu¬ 
tion of two equations in two unknowns is made clear by 
graphic repr n, (the common point). 

Graphs are an invaluable tool in algebra to stu¬ 
dents and teacher alike and can be used effectively In 
junior algebra. 

Dependence and Variability . The majority of Algebra 
One students can grasp the dependence between the lgebr^ic 
numbers contained in a familiar formula. By analogy they 
can deduce the dependence in similar abstract expressions. 
They can also determine whether a change in one variable 
will produce an increase or decrease in the expression. But 
to determine how one variable varies with respect to another 
except in the simplest formulas, seems beyond the capacity 
of most students. 


They have difficulty in transferring notions of 
dependence and variation from known ex;ressicn3, such as 
A - r^, V - e^, P - 9/50 - 32 to purely algebraic ex¬ 
pressions unless the analogy is clear. In other words 
the pupils at this stage are not ready to generalize the 
ideas of dependence. Therefore the following considera¬ 
tions suggest themselves as advisable in a tre tnent of 
dependence in first year algebra. 

1. Keep the work concrete in nature. 

2. Suggest the similarity between functions like r and 
9x 2 , between Lw and xy. .Strive to have the pupil visual¬ 
ize the relationship in terms of the relationship whicn he 
understands. For example by use of a rectangle the in¬ 
verse relation between L and w can be developed.

carry this over to xy, etc. 

3. Keep the work informed in nature and related to the more 
reguli r class work. Bring in discussions of dependence when¬ 
ever the opportunity suggests Itself in formulas, problems, 
substitution, and fundamental o.er .ions. 


The Study of Errors 

The analysis of errors brought out one very signifi¬ 
cant fact. The greatest single cause of errors is weakness 
in working with ordinary vulgar fractions. '.Tork in decimals 
is very little better. This fact contributed to fully one 
half of the total errors made in the tests analysed. .When¬ 
ever fractional coefficients were introduced in place of 
whole numbers the frequency of errors increased several times. 


This is well illustrated by test No. 17 on the Multi¬ 
plication and Division of Directed Numbers. (See P. 59-70) 
This test followed the teaching of the topic and one might 
well expect several errors in sign and algebraic interpreta¬ 
tion. In 57 papers there occurred 55 errors in sign, 36 of 
these being attributed to 6 pupils. However the number of 
errors involving common fractions was o9 • Twelve suudenos 
multiplied incorrectly (- 1 ) .(-£). Twelve had a wrong co¬ 
efficient for (2-|k) 2 . Thirteen failed to answer correctly 
{•f7-g-n) (-30). In the case of addition and subtraction the 
results are worse. Test No. 1 discussed on pages J2.-S5 
revealed the fundamental weakness infractions. 


The results indicate a lack of understanding of the 
real meaning behind the operations involving fractions. 
is not surprising then that when students are faced with the 
addition and subtraction of algebraic fractions the results 
in many cases are disastrous. 


These findings suggest 


the need of one of two things. 


Either, more practice 
elementary school to 


and attention must be given in the 
the teaching of fractions, or the 










teacher of mathematics In High 3chool must devote some 
time to the review and drill of fractions In arithmetic. 

The study of the relative frequency of errors 
revealed that students of higher I. or greater 1 - 
ity, do make fewer mistakes. However the difference in 
performance between the three groups studied is not large 
There is much greater degree of uniformity between the 
groups than one would expect from the relatively much 
greater variation in individual results. 


Evaluation of the Study-Assignment Method of Teaching 

The study-assignment method was tried out at both 
Garneau and East Glover Bar. The investigation at the 
latter was under better control and a more careful record 
was kept of the results. The findings given below ore 
drawn essentially from the work at East Clover Bar. Any 
conclusions that may be drawn from an investigation of 
such a small group can only be considered tentatively. 
However these bear out the conclusions made at Garneau in 
most respects. The method finds of course greater attrac¬ 
tion in the small, ungraded or one room high schools. It 
is more applicable there because the teacher’s time for 
class instruction is limited. Furthermore the method is 
more effective in the small school because the pupils 
have developed the art of individual study. City pupils 
often do not know how to stu y by themselves. 

With due regard to the limitations the following 
conclusions are offered. 

1. The individual'study-assignment method is :bout as 
effective as the class teaching method in junior algebra. 

2. It may tend to produce more uni'- Its as the 

weaker nupils will receive more individual instruction 
while the better pupils will be left to their own re¬ 


sources . 






















97 


3. It may tend to produce more self relianoe on the part 
of the better pupilage they will be left to rely more 
upon their own ability. "Spoonfeeding" win be minimized. 

4. It is an aid to the busy teacher who has many unite to 
teach. However the time taken to prepare assignments will 
more than make up for any time saved m presentation un¬ 
less the teacher can secure assignments ready prepared for 
each topic of .the subject. 

5. The teacher can supervise more re' lily the work of 
eacti student. He can determine more quickly the amount of 

work done and the comprehension of any pupil on any part of 
the unit. 

. I Pints of Doubt : 

1. It is douotful if the purely study-assignment method 
would prove effective. Some qlass teaching with oral 
questioning, discussion, and illustrations, we believe, 
means economy of time and effort on the part of both 
teacher and pupils. This is particularly true at the 
beginning oi a new unit. (This point might deserve experi¬ 
mental investigation.) 

-• -t is doubtful if the study-assignment method would be 
as effective in the presentation of such units as formulas 
and directed number where many entirely new concepts enter 
and where pitfalls are frequent. 

3. It is doubtful if the interest such as was manifested 
by the pupils in the present investigation could be sus¬ 
tained for an entire term or year, or even years. It is 
possible - it seems likely, - that the interest in this 
method of study would, after the novelty wore off, flag 
mudh more noticeably than it does in class teaching. It 
might tend to become a mechanical routine without even 
the direct personal touch of the teacher. The experience 
at G-arneau where a modified form of study-assignment was 
used throughout the year would indicate that interest 
tends to lag after a time and that it is difficult to 
maintain the interest of the pupils in this method over

a long period. After all, 

more spontanuity by written instructions .repared before- 
aand. This possible objection is m>re likely in a sub¬ 
ject like algebra than in science where there re more 
avenues through which to arouse and to maintain interest. 

Gener a l Qb.:crv -tlon : For .est effectiveness 

the study-assignment and class teaching methods of 
presentation should supplement each other. The pupil can 
be left to master alone the more obvious facts nd details. 
The teacher can then enlarge upon the topic from his own 
experience, clear up difficult points, guide the 
study by means of relev nt comments beforehand, and yet 
find some time to help weaker individuals who did not 
obtain enough from class presentation or from the written 
instructions. For economy of time and hence f r practic¬ 
ability the assignment should be nude available for ^he 
busy teacher. It is physically impossi :le for a teacher 
instructing in several units to prepare his own. If the 
assignments are used as suggested in the paragraph 
above there should be no real objection against the 
standardized individual study-assignments in the various 
subjects.

measurements a factor determining, success in il ;ebra? Or, 
in |>ther words, what relation exists between 1.4. and 
achievement in algebra and hov; is this rel tlon affected 
by poor apj '‘.ion to study? A discussion of these ques - 
lions is included because the course of the experiment 
yielded some interesting observations upon such questions. 

It was the original aim of the experiment to have 
two equated high school classes for experimental teaching 
purposes. One class could then be used as a control 
group in experiments to compare the relative effectiveness 
of different methods of teaching and of presentation of a 
topic. 


With this in view the two classes were equated 
and in so far as could be determined in advance by testing, 
the classes appeared to be very nearly equal in all respects 
as is indicated by the tables..However, as will be explained 
the teaching results did not remain the same. Other iactors 
developed which rendered comparison between the two classes 
invalid. 


A comparison of the two classes and of differences 
in achievement, together with correlations between I. ■*,. and 
examination results follows. 


Ho w the classes were equated . Tne classes e_s 
arbitrarily divided by the principal ox the school cfi ,j be

the two classes could be used as two comparative groups 
without redivision the following observations were made.

It is readily seen that the classes were closely 
equated. Room 16 is consistently superior, but this superior¬ 
ity is in each rating very slight. Certainly it is not 
sufficient to invalidate any comparative studies that might 
be made with the classes on the assumption that they were 
equated. These results would in no way lead one to expect 
that room 16 would show a much higher record of achievement 
during the school year.

In chronological age room 16 is 0.-4 years older, 
and in mental ago 0.4 years in adv ..ce, However in Z. Q,. 
there is very little difference. If one subject whose I. 

- (80) - was far below anyone else'a be omitted from 
the room 15 class its average I. «<,. would equal that of 
the other class. Again, in the tests on fundamentals of 
arithmetic and preliminary notions of algebra the classes 
are very nearly equal. Teacher ratings too, indicate no 
great difference. 


Teaching Results: 


Although the two classes were very nearly equal in 
mental ability and in knowledge of algebra at the beginning 
of the year, as is shown in the table, it soon became 
evident that their achievements in algebra would not remain 
equal. Unforeseen factors appeared which upset the equilib¬ 
rium and invalidated any comparisons to be made between the 
classes. Thus comparative study of different teaching meth¬ 
ods was made ineffective. This necessitated a change in 
some of the original objectives of tae experiment. 


The contrast in the two classes manifested itself 
in a difference in class and individual attitude toward 
work. The pupils of room 16 were attentive and interested; 
they did their homework assignments willingly. 1^ hccm -5 
co-operation of the class was at times difficult to obtain. 
This was due to a group of half dozen flighty girls a... 
three or four fidgety boys who apparently disliked the sub¬ 
ject and disrupted the class. However this dislike was not 
toward algebra in particular but an antipathy toward study 
in general since these same pupils gave difiiculty to one 
teachers of the other subjects as well. The regul ar teaching 
staff of the school considered room 15 to be much inferior 
to room 16 in both industry and intelligence. 

The differences in class achievement are illustrated

nor the algebra teacher (the experimenter) was responsible 
for the difference in attitude and achievement in ai ebra. 

However algebra was more popular in room 16 than in 
room 15 as is revealed by an exercise where’ e pupils were 
asked to rank in the order of their liking the seven subjects 
they studied during the ye: r. Thus rank 1, best liked; rank 
7, least. 

The table below gives the cverage rating. This was

Tea ch i nr Results; Jorreh hons : An attempt was made 
to answer the following questions: 

1. What relation do results in one test bear upon results in 
a sub s equent test? 

2. What relation exists between I. Q* and achievement in 
Algebra? 

3. Is this relation lowered by poor attitude to study? 


To answer the first question, the results in the thred 
tem tests in algebra were correlates as follows: 


with December, December wit .a 
results are as follows, the i 
Room 15l 

October with December 
December with Easter 
October with Easter 
Rc om 16: 

October with December 
December with master 
October with -aster 


Easter; October with Easter, 
.easures being rank correlations: 

r = 0.72 
r - 0.76 
r & 0. An 

r = 0.74 
r sr O .65 

r = 0.60 




























105 






Between adjacent tests the relations -’re f'irly 
hi^h and somewhat In favor of class 15• However between 
Octooer and Easter test., the relation drops to 0.4s or only 
slightly lower t between adjacent tests, ihls wou3 
suggest more consistent work In room 16 as is borne out by 
other observations. 

To answer the second and third questions I..*. v: s 
correlated with algebra marks s follows: 

1. with weighted average of the three term tests on the 
basis of one for October, two for December, and seven for 
Master. 

2. Wit of the thre- - T results 

are as follows, the measures being product-moment correlations. 

Algebra marks (weighted Average) with I. s,. 


Room 15.0.43 - 0.096 

Room 16.0.62 - 0.075 

Room 15 October test vs I. Q.r = 0.56 

December test vs I. Q.r - 0.47 

March test vs 1. 4.r - 0.37 

Room 16 October test vs I. Q.r = 0.60 

December test vs I. Q,.r = 0.55 

March test vs I. ..r = 0.62 


In room 16 where satisfactory application prevailed, 
the correlation is high enough to be quite reliable. Success 
in Junior algebra, does depend upon I. «%. to a marked degree. 
The correlation measure obtained compares witn what has been 
found to be the general average correlation between Junior 
high school mathematics and intelligence measures. 

In room 15 the correlation is lower at all times and 
decreases from October to master as does cniev j — 
gebra. This can be accounted for by the fact than pupils did 
not do work commensurate with their aci_ity. A no. as tne 

attitude to study increased, in like manner tne correlation 
between I. <*. and algebra marks decreased.

An Assignment in Problems 
You have now learned many facts about the handling 
of algebraic numbers. It is time for you to begin using 
them in a way that will help you to solve real problems 
which you may meet later in life. 

Let us, then, practise solving problems. 77e shall 
begin with the simplest kind of problems, number problems, 










then solve other types. Although you may tulnk number 
problems are not of practical Importance they will lve 
you more skill and power to attack other word problems. 

Solve each problem In t he form you have lr id;, It rne d, 
ruling yo u r page In ap p ropri at e manner . (The ob r ed 
problems are more difficult. They re option; !. Do them 
if you like or if you can. All the others must be done.)

rence is 35. Find the numbers. 

4. Five times a certain number, when 2 is added, gives 
the total result 17. Find the number. 

5. If 10 is subtracted from one-third of a certain 
number, the result is 4. Find the number. 

6. I am thinking of two integers whose sum is 37. The 
larger is two more than four times the smaller. What 
are the integers? 

7. There are three numbers whose sum is 84. The second 
is three times the first, and the third is 4 more tnan 
twice the second. What are the numbers? 

8. Find two consecutive integers whose sum is 39. 

9* Find three consecutive integers whose sum is 27. 

10. Find two consecutive even integers wnose sum is 54. 

11 . One number exceeds another by 15. The larger numoer 
is 9 less than four times the smaller. Find the 
numbers. 

12. Separate 54 into two parts such that if 16 is subtract¬ 
ed from the first part, the result will equal the 
second part. What are the parts?

Exercise 3. 

A binomial expression can be factored If the two terms 
of the expression have a common factor. 

Thus: 6x and 8 have a common -‘actor, 2. 

Hence: (6x + ) *4)—
