UIJ GROUNDED AHTEHEA SYSTEM, 

Electrical energy which has escaped into free space 
exists in the form of electromagnetic waves. These waves, 
known as radio waves, travel with the velocity of light, 
and consist of electric and magnetic fields, at right 
angles to each other and to the direction of travel. One 
half of the energy in the wave exists as magnetic energy 
and the other half as electrostatic energy. 

Radio communication is the art of producing and 
utilizing these radio waves, for the communication of 
intelligence through space. It is the function of the 
antenna to liberate the energy for the waves. Radio 
frequency energy is supplied to the antenna by the trans¬ 
mitter and coupling system, and the antenna changes this 
energy into electromagnetic waves. In order that the 
conversion may be obtained with a maximum of efficiency 
and economy, it is necessary to be able to compare the 
relative merits of different antennae, as radiators of 
energy. This may be done from a knowledge of the so- 
called constants of an antenna. A knowledge of the 
constants is also desired for the design of coupling 
and tuning systems for an antenna. 

Eor a grounded antenna, the constants may be 
measured by definite and well-known methods. However, 
when no part of the antenna system is directly connected 
to ground, these methods require modification. In

grounded antennae systems, the ground effectively 
short circuits most of the stray capacitances to 
ground, thus eliminating their effects on the circuit, 
Since ungrounded antennae operate without any connection 

Hot 

to ground, it is permissible to connect any part of the 

A 

measuring circuit to ground. Stray capacitances and 
unbalance in the circuit must be avoided or eliminated 
as far as possible. 

If measurements are made on the antenna, especially 
resistance measurements, using the conventional methods 
but without any ground connection, unreasonable and in¬ 
consistent results are usually obtained. Changing the 
position in the circuit, of any piece of apparatus, will 
lead to different readings for the same quantity. 

Wor the above reasons, it was found to be desirable 
to make an investigation of methods of measuring antenna 
constants, to determine if any of them or modifications 
of them could be used with ungrounded antennae.

HISTORICAL . 

The fundamental laws governing electromagnetic 
radiation were first stated by Maxwell, about 1865. 

The experimental verification was not presented until 
twenty years later, when Hertz, using a spark gap 
oscillator, detected the presence of electromagnetic 
waves by their effect on a neighboring circuit. When 
the oscillator and receiving circuit were tuned to the 
same frequency, the discharge of the spark gap was 
accompanied by a spark across the air gap of the receiving 
circuit. 

The practical application of the theory was sub¬ 
sequently made by Marconi. By grounding one end of the 
antenna, Marconi increased the capacitance between the 
ends of the oscillating system and so increased the 
current flow. Since the earth is usually a good con¬ 
ductor, and since a charge placed a short distance from 
a conducting plane sets up fields, which are identical 
with those due to two equal and opposite charges, one 
in the position of the actual charge, and one in the 
position found by obtaining the electrical or optical 
image of the actual charge, the current flowing in the 
antenna, with one end grounded sets up fields above the 
earth similar to those which would be produced by an 
ungrounded antenna of twice the height. Because of the 
historical connection, the grounded antenna is frequently 
termed the Marconi antenna, while the ungrounded type 
is called the Hertz antenna. 

If the ground is very dry, and therefore a poor

conductor, the ground resistance will be so high as 
to materially cut down the current flow. In such 
cases, a network of wires is often laid on, or near 
the ground, directly underneath the top of the an¬ 
tenna, to carry the current. This network of wires 
is termed a counterpoise. Since the purpose of the 
counterpoise is to supplement, or supplant, the 
ground as part of the circuit, the resistance of 
the counterpoise should be very low, and since the 
capacitance between the counterpoise and the antenna 
top will control the current in the vertical wire 
of the antenna, and hence the radiated energy, the 
surface of the counterpoise should be as large.as 
possible, being in all cases at least as large as 
the antenna top. 

DISTRIBUTED PARAMETERS . 

It is obvious that there is no conducting 
circuit in an antenna, and no direct current would 
flow if a battery were inserted in the uplead. 

The antenna wires and the counterpoise constitute 
the plates of a very incompact condenser, for a 
static charge the capacity of the antenna has a 
definite and precise meaning, and is given by the 
ratio of the charge to the potential of the antenna. 

In low frequency circuits the current at 
different parts of the circuit is, in general, the 
same. The inductance and capacitance are definitely

localised or lumped in the circuit. Mien the 
dimensions of a circuit are comparable to the 
wave-length, the capacitances between different 
parts of the circuit become important, and the 
current in different parts of the circuit may be 
different * Antannae are ordinarily comparable 
in length, to a wave-length and the current may 
vary from point to point in the wires. In such 
a case the inductive and capacitive effects will 
depend on the frequency, and separate inductances 
and capacitances must he considered with regard to 
their position in the circuit, i.e. they must be 
considered as "distributed” inductance and 
capacitance.

drawn in dotted lines. Suppose that a number of 
ammeters were inserted at various points in the 
counterpoise. As the frequency of the generator 
is increased, the reactances of the condensers 
decrease, and more current will flow through them. 
Hence the readings of the ammeters will be different, 
and will decrease successively from the generator 
to the far end. As a result of the changed dis¬ 
tribution of current in the antenna, the equivalent 
inductance, capacity, and resistance of the antenna 
(as measured at the generator, say,) will vary 
with frequency. JPor this reason it is difficult 
to give a precise meaning to the terms capacity 
and inductance of the antenna* 

When an alternating current flows in the 
antenna, there will be a magnetic field created 

due to the current, and an electric field due to 

* 

the voltage between the antenna and counterpoise. 
Hence the antenna will exhibit inductive and 
capacitive effects. This constitutes a definition 
of the terms capacity and inductance of the 
antenna. 

As explained above the apparent capacity and 
inductance of the antenna, as measured at a given 
point, will vary with frequency. In order to 
determine the laws of this variation, at least 
approximately, the antenna can be considered as

a long, uniform transmission line, open at the far end. 

i 

Moullin does this, and shows that a long open line oan 
be considered as equivalent to a concentrated capacity 

L 

G s in series with an inductance—n, and a resistance R s 
where G g and L s are the low frequency capacity and 
inductance of the line, obtained by multiplying the length 
of the line by the capacity per unit length and the in¬ 
ductance per unit length respectively. If the line is in 
resonance, the equivalent inductance is approximately 0*4 L g . 
Thus the inductance varies from 0.4 L s at resonance to 
0.35 L s at frequencies much less than the fundamental. The 
uniform line is therefore equivalent to a concentrated 
capacity in series with an inductance Virhose value increases 
slightly as resonance is approached. It is reasonable to 
expect practical forms of antennae to behave in approximately 
the same manner. 

In a long uniform line, the current distribution is 
sinusoidal. Since an antenna usually approximates to long 
line conditions, it is reasonable to assume that the current 

distribution in an antenna is also sinusoidal. This has been 

z 


verified experimentally by R. M. Wilmotte who used a vertical 
cylindrical cage aerial. Thermo-ammeters were inserted in the 
antenna at various positions, and the current distribution 
determined. After allowing for the inductance of the meters, 
the current distribution was found to be very close to a sine 
curve.

RADIATED PQ^ii AMD RADIATION RESI£TAMOS. 

Practically all analyses of power radiated fro$ an 
antenna start from the theory of the Hertzian doublet, suit¬ 
ably modifying it to make it apply to the grounded antenna. 
Moullin assumes a doublet consisting of a length of thin wire 
of length 1, terminating in conducting spheres, the radii of 
which are great compared with the radius of the wire, but very 
small compared with 1. The current is assumed to vary sinu¬ 
soidally with time, but at any instant is constant in phase 
and magnitude along the length of the wire. With these 
assumptions, the radiated power P is found to be 

P - 80 -rr ~x l 2 * I 2 watts. (I) 

A* 

where X is the wave-length, I the current, and 1 the length of 
the doublet. 

Since this formula for the power radiated assumes a constant 
amplitude current in the antenna, it is not directly applicable 
to practical forms of antennae. However, Moullin shows that 
the formula gives the power radiated by any antenna, if the 
quantity (1*1) is taken as the area under the current distri¬ 
bution curve, and is valid for antennae lengths not too close to 
the fundamental wave-length. "1" is then defined as the 
"equivalent height" of the antenna, when "I" is the current at 
the base of the antenna. 

In terrestial communications, it is seldom convenient 

* Many broadcasting stations are erecting vertical half-wave 
radiators, their expense being justified for high power 
stations.

to obtain the condition of an oscillator situated in 
free space, and Marconi's plan of connecting the base 
of the vertical wire to ground is used. It is necessary 
to consider the effect of the ground on the radiation 
from the antenna* 

The effect of the earth is best visualized by con¬ 
sidering the earth to be plane, perfectly conducting , and 
in such a position as to bisect at right angles, the 
current in the doublet. Since the earth is assumed to he 
perfectly conducting, it must be an equipotential plane. 

Also the originallines of force cross the plane AB (Fig. 2a) 
at right angles since the plane AB bisects the vertical 
current at right angles. Hence the original lines of force 
will cross the plane of the earth at right angles, and, 
consequently, there is no reason to believe that the presence 




of the earth has disturbed the upper half of the original 
field. Kelvin showed that a point charge situated above an 
equipotential plane, produces a distribution of charge on 
the plane such that "the field due to the point charge and 
the charge on the plane is everywhere identical with the 
field due to the original point charge, together with that 
of an equal and opposite point charge placed at anequal 












- 10 - 


dietance below the plane." This is Kelvin’s principle of 

o 

electrical images, hence, by analogy, the field of half 

a doublet above the earth is considered to be the same as 

that of a whole doublet in free space. There is now only 

a hemisphere of field, and the energy radiated by the earthed 
be 

doublet will^half that of the free doublet, of twice the 
height. Therefore the power radiated by a half doublet 
connected to earth at its midpoint is 
P = 40 712, l~.l2 

X 2 (II) 

where 1 is the length of the whole doublet. If "h n is 
the actual height of the half doublet the radiated power is 
P = 160 7t ~*hKl z (III) 

If "h" is taken as the equivalent height of the antenna, 
this is the power radiated by any earthed antenna operating 
at a wave-length not too near to the fundamental. 

The effect of bent tops, such as in "inverted L" and "T" 
type antennae, must now be considered. As pointed out above, 
the power radiated by a vertical antenna, is proportional to 
the area under the current distribution curve, hence, pp e 
greater this area, the greater the radiated power. The 
current in a grounded vertical antenna operating at a wave¬ 
length greater than the fundamental, will be a portion of a 
sine curve i.e.; it will vary from a maximum value: at the 
grounded point, to zero at the top. If by some means, the 
current near the top could be increased, the, the total power 
radiated could be increased. This is usually done by placing

an horizontal network of wires called the "flat-top," 
and connecting it to the top of the vertical wire or 


- 11 - 


"up-lead". The "flat-top" will have considerable capacity to 
ground, thus increasing the current near the top of the 
"up-lead", and hence, the radiated power. The approximate 
current distribution for vertical and "inverted L" type 
antennae are shown in Fig. 3. will be onserved that some 

current flows in the "flat-top", and hence some energy will 
be radiated by the "flat-top". 





b. 


a. 


At wave-lengths appreciably greater than the fundamental, 
the energy radiated from the "flat-top" will be small compared 
to that from the vertical, because the area under the current 
distribution curve is small and because the "flat-top" is 
usually a small fraction of a wave-length above the earth or 
counterpoise. The earth or counterpoise will radiate energy 
also, but, because the currents in the "flat-top" and the 
earth or counterpoise are opposite in phase, and a small 
fraction of .a wave-length apart, these fields will be opposite 
in phase and there will be practically no resultant (field. 

The radiation from the "flat-top" and the counterpoise can 
ordinarily be neglected without appreciable error being

introdueed. The vertical or up-lead radiates 
practically all of the radiated energy. 

Since the up-lead is the principal radiator of 
energy, the quantity (lxl) in the radiated power formula 
will he the area under the current distribution curve on 
the up-lead only. 

It is possible to calculate the equivalent height 
"h" for simple forms of antennae, if a current distribution 
curve is assumed. For example, consider a vertical Vvire 
of height "1" radiating at a wave-length appreciably 
longer than the fundamental, so that the current will 
increase uniformly from zero at the top to I at the 
bottom, it is obvious that the equivalent height is h = 
i x l. 

At the fundamental wave-1emgth, the current distribution 
will be half a sine curve, and th e equivalent - height will 
- b e half a sine curve, and the equivalent height will be 
given by the equation^

But since 1 = X or X = 2.1 f therefore h = 2^ 1* Hence

as the frequency is increased from a low value, to that of the 

fundamental, the equivalent height increases by 2 Wfo. The 

change is negligible until the frequency is about one quarter 

£ 

of the fundamental. 

The equivalent height for an "inverted L" type antenna, 
radiating at a wave-length longer than the fundamental, may 
be found similarly if a straight line distribution of 
current is assumed. 

Consider the "inverted L” antenna shown in Fig. 4. 



Let 1 be the height of the antenna and ”d” the length of 
the flat-top. A straight line current distribution is 
shown. The area of the curve on the vertical is readily 
found to be 

hvl = 1 ( It d_* l\ = 2d+l , 1,1 

Via / 2(d+T)' 

_ — 

Therefore the eauivalent height is h = 2d+l * 1 --(¥} 

2Uti) 

The equivalent height for other antennae may be found 
in a similar manner. The above calculations indicate, 
approximately, the error caused by assuming a straight

line distribution of current on a vertical antenna. 

However, there are other factors entering,where the 

frequency api-roaches the fundamental. For example, it 

is known that the high angle radiation from a long 

antenna is considerably reduced. The polar diagram in 

a vertical plane is no longer a semi-circle but is 

7 

considerably flattened. Hence the total output is 
considerably reduced, and is less than for a doublet of 
the same equivalent height. 

It is therefore evident that an antenna possesses 
inductance due to its magnetic field, capacity due to 
its electrostatic field, and resistance due to power 
dissipation by radiation and other causes. Each of 
these properties of the antenna will now be discussed 
in more detail.

AUTENUA IKDUOTAUOE, CAPACITY 

^nd NATURAL WAVE-LENGTH 

An antenna possesses distributed inductance, 
capacity and resistance, none of which is absolutely 
uniform throughout the length of the antenna. The 
value of most of these quantities depends in a complex 
manner, on the topography of the buildings, etc., near 
the antenna. It is impossible to calculate them 
accurately except for an ideal case. Also, most of 
these Quantities will change with frequency, due to 
the change in current distribution that accompanies a 
change of frequency. 

As a first approximation an antenna can be assumed 

to have uniformly distributed constants, c<nd long line 

8 

eoustions are then applicable. This analysis shows 
that there is a frequency for which the input impedance 
of the antenna is a minumum, and will occur when the 
antenna length is a quarter of a w r ave-length. Minima 
will also occur when the length of the antenna is any 
odd multiple of a quarter wave-length. The lowest 
frequency at which an antenna of given length has a 
minimum input impedance is called the n natural frequency” 
of the antenna. The wave-length at which this occurs 
is called the "natural wave-length” of the antenna. 

The antenna is then in resonance and will have zero 
input reactance.

Resonance can be made to occur at frequencies less 
than the natural frequency, by adding an inductance coil 
in series with the uplead. Similarly, the resonance 
frequency can be increased above the natural frequency 
by placing a concentrated capacity in series with the 
uplead. It is not difficult to obtain an inductance 
large enough to reduce the natural frequency, but it is 
quite difficult to increase the natural frecuency by 
any percentage because of the distributed capacity 
which shunts the inserted condenser. Changing the 
natural frequency of the antenna in either of the above 
ways, is termed "loading” the antenna. 

It is obvious that loading the antenna will change 
the distribution of current from that which occurs at 
the natural frequency. Fig. 5a shows the distribution 
of current on a vertical grounded antenna, excited at its 




Fig. 5 

natural frequency. Fig. 5b shows the distribution of 
current for inductance loading, and Fig. 5c shows the 
distribution for capacity loading.

A knowledge of the effective inductance and capacity 
and the natural wave-length of an antenna must be 
available in order to calculate the size of loading coil 
or condenser necessary to change the natural wave¬ 
length a desired amount. Thus it is desirable to be 
able to measure these so-called "constants" of the 
antenna. They are usually measured by a metnod similar 
to that used in obtaining the distributed capacity of 
an inductance coil, and known as the "intercept method". 
The procedure is to insert various sizes of accurately 
calibrated inductance coils in the uplead and the 
resonance wave-lengths obtained. The constants of the 
antenna can be obtained from this data, in the following 
manner. 

Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 6. Then the 



Fig. 6. 

resonance wave-length is given by 

X = 1.684 J C A ( L a -+ L) (VI) 

where \= the resonance wave-length in meters. 

C^ f the antenna capacity in micro-microfarads. 

f the antenna inductance in microhenrys. 

L = the loading inductance in micronenrys.

Where X 0 is the natural wave-length. If the antenna

inductance and capacity are constant, X plotted against 
L should give a straight line. The negative intercept 
on the "L-axis" will he numerically equal to the antenna 
inductance L^, and the intercept on the (wave-length 
axis will he Thus the inductance and tht natural 

wave-length of the antenna can he found. The capacity 
of the antenna can he found from equation VI, or more 
conveniently, from the following eouation 



(VII) 

(VIII) 


This is the usual method for determining the antenna 
constants. 

In order to perform this experiment, the apparatus 
was connected as shown in Fig. 7. Owing to distributed 
capacity, the apparent inductance of the coils used, 
will depend on frequency. Thus if the loading coils are 
calibrated at one frequency and used at another frequency, 
errors will result due to the distributed capacity of the 


coils

If the coils are calibrated at the frequencies at which 
they are to be used , values of the apparent inductances 



of the coils will be obtained, which represent their 
effective inductance in the circuit. For this reason 
a double-pole double-throw switch (D.P.D.T.) was used, 
to connect the inductance either to the antenna or to 
a precision condenser, as desired. 

The switch was thrown to the antenna-counterpoise 
side, thus placing the coil (General Badio Type 226 
0.2 mh. Inductor.) and thermo-milliammeter (0-125 range) 
in series with the antenna. The oscillator was coupled 
to the loading coil and the frequency was varied until 
resonance was obtained in the circuit. Leaving the 
oscillator frequency set, the switch was thrown to the 
condenser side, and the condenser was varied until 
resonance was again obtained. The coupling was decreased 
slightly so to keep a convenient deflection on the meter. 
The wave-length of the oscillator was determined by means 
of a precision wavemeter. The readings obtained are shown 
in Table I.

it is probable that the intercepts on the axes cannot 

be found with any degree of accuracy. A direct determination

of the natural wave-length is better. Also, the slope of the 
line is more definite than the intercepts,and can be used to 
find the antenna capacity in the following manner.

L A = inductance of the antenna in microhenrys. 

L = inductance of the loading coil in micro¬

coil L.

In making a direct determination of the natural 
wave-length, consideration must be given to the method 
of exciting or feeding energy to the antenna* Moullin 
recommends using a resistance potentiometer to feed the 
antenna. This method cannot,in general, be used with 
ungrounded antennae, because, as will be shown later, 
unless the antenna is fed at the neutral, the system will 
be unbalanced. A coupling coil cannot be used because its 
inductance changes the natural wave-length of the antenna. 

Moullin suggests another method in which is employed 
an oscillator of sufficient power to produce a measurable 
current in the antenna with no coupling other than that 
furnished by the antenna and uplead. This method was 
tried but the oscillator had insufficient power to excite the 
antenna appreciably. It was found, however, that the 
current in the antenna could be increased sufficiently to 
give a measurable deflection of the milliammeter , by 
placing a half turn loop around the tank coil of the 
oscillator, bwing to the fact, that in order to use the 
antenna for any practical purpose, it is necessary to 
employ such a loop and leads in any case, their inductance 
need not be taken into account. In this way a value of 
920 kc. or 326. meters was obtained for the natural 
frequency and wave-length respectively. Using this value 
value for X Q and the value of 0^ ■ 558previously 
obtained, the inductance of the antenna is found to be

The only disadvantage involved in using a proper 
coupling coil in order to excite the antenna to obtain 
the natural wave-length, is that the inductance of the 
coil loads the antenna, i.e.: it changes the natural 
wave-length of the antenna. It should be possible to 
use a condenser to neutralise or "tune out" the effect 
of the inductance. Since, with a condenser and a coil 
in series with the antenna, the condenser can be varied 
until the system resonates at almost any given wave¬ 
length, a means must be obtained for finding when the 
capacitive reactance neutralizes the inductive reactance. 

Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 8, where the 
antenna has been replaced by its equivalent circuit 



L and C are the loading coil and condenser, respectively. 
At the natural wave-length of the antenna and C^will 
form a resonant circuit, and their reactances will be 
equal.

The impedance of the antenna will he a pure resistance, 
equal to R^. At any other wave-length, the antenna will 
possess reactance, which can he neutralized with a 
loading coil or condenser, hence, if at any frequency, 
the whole circuit shown in Fig* 8 is in resonance, the 
resultant reactance of the coil and condenser in series 
must he equal, and opposite in phase, to the antenna 
reactance* At the natural wave-length of the antenna, 
the antenna reactance will he zero, and hence, the 
resultant reactance of the coil and condenser must he 
zero also, which means, that they are in resonance and their 
reactances are equal. If the inductance of the coil, 
and the capacities required to resonate the circuit to 
various wave-lengths are known, curves of their reactances 
can he drawn against wave-length as abscissae. Where the 
two curves intersect, their reactances will he equal and 
the wave-length at which this occurs will he the natural 
wave-length of the antenna. 

The experimental circuit used is shown in Fig. 9. 

A D.P.D.T. switch was employed, as in the intercept 
method, to eliminate the effect of distributed capacity in 
the coil, by calibrating the coil at each wave-length used. 

The switch v*as first thrown to the "A" side, thus placing 
the coil (Gr.R. type 226, Inductor, tap 1.), the preeision 
condenser G, and a thermo-milliammeter (0-125 range) in series 
with the antenna and counterpoise. The oscillator was set 
at a given wave-length and the circuit tuned to resonance

with the condenser. Readings of the condenser and the 
wave-length were recorded. The switch was then thrown 
to the ”B” side, thus forming a series circuit with the 
coil, condenser, and meter. The circuit was again 
tuned to resonance, and the condenser reading recorded. 
These readings were all repeated for other wave-lengths. 
The readings obtined are shown in Table II. The re¬ 
actance of the coil and condenser were calculated for 
each wave-length, and plotted against frequency as shown 



From the graph, the frequency at which Xq^-s X-^, is 
924 KC. or 325 M f , which checks with the value for 
found directly. 

This method also allows the natural wave-length 
to be determined directly without drawing the curves. 
When the oscillator is operating at the natural wave¬ 
length, the switch can be thrown from one side to the 
other, without readjustment of the condenser being 
necessary, to obtain resonance. The wave-length at 
which this can be done, must be found by trial and error.

For purposes of comparison and reference, the 
values for antenna inductance, capacity, and natural 
wave-length and frequency, obtained in each way are 
tabulated in Table III. For want of a better name, the 
new method has been called the reactance method. 

The values for natural wave-length and frequency 
obtained by direct determination, the reactance method, 
and the direct reactance method, all agree within the 
accuracy of the experiments. Compared with the values 
obtained by these methods, the value given by the intercept 
method is about 2% lower. This difference is too large 
to account for by inaccuracies in the experiment. The 
points on the graph in the intercept method lie well on 
the line showing that the experiment was conducted with 
at least fair accuracy. For these reasons, it is necessary 
to look elsewhere for a probable explanation of the 
difference. 

It was pointed out on page 6 that the equivalent 
inductance and capacity of an antenna operating near the 
natural wave-length depend somewhat on frequency. Is it

not possible, then, that the equivalent inductance of 
the antenna varies, for wave-1ength§ near the natural 
wave-length? The intercept method as ordinarily 
used does not easily permit of investigating conditions 
near the natural wave-length. The new reactance method, 
however, does allow investigation near the natural 
wave-length. For, at any given frequency, less than 
the natural, the coil and condenser in series, are 
equivalent to an inductance whose value can be calculated. 
The reactance of this equivalent inductance is equal to 
the ordinate bet ween the two curves on the graph of 
the reactance method, Various values of inductance, 
at different wave-lengths can be calculated in this way, 
and^g-raph similar to that used in the intercept method 
can be plotted. Table IV shows data obtained in this 
way, and Graph III shows the curve obtained. 

The straight line ontained in the usual intercept 
method, was drawn on the graph, starting from the 
intercept on the axis, of value 1.00 x 10 5 , and 
having a slope equal to that of the straight line on 
Graph I of the intercept method. It will be observed 
that the points on Graph III, for the larger values of 
X, lie fairly well on this straight line. However, the 
points close to the natural wave-length diverge from this 
straight line. A curve drawn through these points 
intersects the \ 2 axis at 1.07 x 10*, which gives a 
value of 527 m. or 918 KG. These values agree much better 
with the other values for the natural wave-length. The

fact that the curve diverges from the st. line at 
wave-lengths near the natural wave-length shows that the 
equivalent inductance and capacity of the antenna may 
vary near the natural wave-length. This is due to the 
divergence of the current distribution curve from a 
straight line. It is approaching a quarter sine wave. 

It will be observed that the points on the graph, 
which diverge from the straight line, are obtained from 
the part of the graph in the reactance method, where no 
experimental points lie. Hence what justification is 
there for assuming that the curve of the intercept method 
does diverge as shown? There appear to be three reasons 
justifying this assumption. 

1. The curve gives a value for the natural wave¬ 
length which agrees much better with the other Halues. 

2. For longer wave-lengths, the points determined 
from the reactance method, lie on the straigth line 
obtained in the intercept method. 

3. The variation in the constants was predicted 
from theoretical considerations. 

However, these three reasons are probably not 
sufficient to allow a definite decision to be reached. 

It should be possible to obtain values on the reactance- 
method curve which would permit the intercept curve to be 
definitely determined in the region near the natural 
wave-length. 

If the equivalent capacity and inductance do vary, 
then the curve for the reactance of the condenser, shown in

Graph II, for the reactance method, will not he strictly 
correct near the natural wave-length. At a given wave¬ 
length, near the natural wave-length the antenna will 
have less reactance than would he expected if the constants 
did not vary, and hence will require less tuning reactance, 
which means a slightly larger capacitive reactance for the 
condenser. This will tend to bring the capacitive reactance 
curve nearer to the inductive reactance curve, giving less 
effective inductance. The effect of this would be to 
cause the intercept curve to start to diverge from a 
straight line, at a longer wave-length than indicated in 
Graph III. 

If we assume that the equivalent inductance and 
capacity of the antenna, do vary with frequency, then it is 
necessary to decide on what values to use in computations 
on the antenna. Which value of natural wave-length 
should be used? It would appear that the values obtained 
from the usual intercept method straight line should be 
used for wave-lengths appreciably longer than the natural 
wave-length. For wave-lengths near the natural wave¬ 
length, values for the inductance, capacity, and "apparent” 
natural, wave-length will have to be determined from a 
graph such as that in Graph III, for each wave-length 
desired. Further investigations would be necessary to 
determine if this is so. 

As far as can be determined, the reactance method is 
an entirely new method for determining the natural wave¬ 
length of an antenna, ho references can be found in

the literature which would indicate that this method 
has been previously employed. The method would appear 
to have two advantages which would justify its use for 
determining the constants of an antenna. In the first 
place it allows the conditions existing in an antenna 
operating near the natural wave-length to be determined 
easily. In the second place, it allows a direct determ¬ 
ination of the natural wave-length to be made and it has 
the advantage over the ordinary method for determining 
the natural wave-length, in that a much less sensitive 
themo-milliammeter can be used. When a low range meter 
is not available,the reactance method would thus have a 
definite use. 

In order to calculate the radiation resistance for 
the antenna to ground, it is necessary to have a value 
for the natural wave-length of the antenna. Since the 
natural wave-length for the grounded antenna is different 
to that for the antenna and counterpoise, it must be 
measured. The usual intercept method was used giving 
the data shown in Table V, and the straight line shown 
in Graph IY.

The straight line for the antenna and counterpoise 
has also been drawn on the graph, for comparison. It 
will be observed that when the ground is used, the 
antenna has slightly less inductance, a greater natural 
wave-length, and a larger eapacity (due to the greater 
slope of the graph.) 

The currents ih the earth have a larger area in 
which to flow than they have in the counterpoise, and 
due to this larger area, the path will have somewhat 
less inductance as compared to the counterpoise.wires. 
However, some current will flow in the grounded steel 
towers, which will have inductance. The total effect 
will be that the grounded antenna has practically the 

a 

sme inductance as the antenna and counterpoise. The 

A 

grounded antenna has a larger capacity than the antenna 
and counterpoise due to the greater area of the earth 
as compared to the effective area of the counterpoise. 
The natural wave-length is also greater, due to this 
increased capacity since the inductance is practically 


constant

The resistance of a circuit may he difined as 
that quantity, which, multiplied by the mean square of 
the current flowing into the circuit, is equal to the 

3 

mean rate at which energy is being absorbed: expressed 
in symbols, the definition becomes 

I 2 H = W (IX) 

where I 2 is the mean square of the current, R the 
resistance, and W the power absorbed. As a result of 
this definition, any circuit which absorbs power, may be 
considered to have resistance. 

If an oscillator is connected between i&he foot of 
an antenna and ground, it will be found that the antenna 
system dissipates power, and hance possesses resistance. 

It is natural that an antenna should exhibit some 
resistance, but on consideration will be seen that the 
origin is not simple. 

Since a transmitting antenna is erected for the 
sole purpose of transmitting energy to some distant 
place, and since this energy must come from the oscillator 
at the foot of the antenna, the antenna resistance must 
include this radiated energy. Also, there will be come 
energy lost due to resistance (ohmic) in the wires of the 
antenna, and due to other causes. The antenna resistance 
may be divided into two main components, one component 
that is useful, and one that is not:- 

a. Radiation resistance. 

b. Loss resistance.

RADIATI01\ ^IETAL'JE. 

From the above definition of resistance, radiation 
resistance is that resistance which will absorb the 
same power as is radiated for the same current as flows 
in the antenna. Since the current in an antenna varies 
over its length, the value of this resistance will depend 
on the position at which the current is measured. It is 

standard practice to refer the radiation resistance to 

10 

the base of the antenna. 

The power radiated by an antenna is given by 
formula III p«lG'.. 

P = 160 nph 2 x I 2 

Therefore the radiation resistance can be obtained 
by dividing this power by the mean square of the current 
at the base, which by definition of effective current, 
is I 2

Radiation resistance can be calculated approximately

dimensions for an assumed current distribution. For 
antennae radiating at wave-lengths longer than the 
fundamental, the current distribtion will depart consider¬

In order to calculate the effective height of the 
antenna, the dimensions and the current distribution 
shown in Fig, 11 were used. The length of the vertical 
part AB (Fig. 11) was taken as the height of thetop 
of the uplead, above the counterpoise. The fact that 
the far end of the flat-top is somewhat higher than the 
top of the uplead, was neglected. The counterpoise has 
been replaced by an extensive perfectly conducting plane. 

On these assumptions, the effective height of the antenna 
can be calculated from formula V as follows:- 
h = 2d -t-1 x 1

= 2(154) + 65.2 x 85.2

The radiation resistance of the antenna, at various 
wave-lengths, was calculated from this formula, and 
tabulated, as shown in Table Vi. The third column in

LOSS BESI&TAI'iCE 

The loss resistance is due to a number of causes, 
and may be divided into the following components: 

1 . Dielectric Loss 

Poor dielectrics such as wood, masonry, trees, etc., 
in the vicinity of an antenna, cause a dielectric loss* 

This loss is due to a hysteresis phenomenon which takes 
place in all dielectrics, and is analogous to that due 
to hysteresis in iron. The dielectric loss varies 
directly as the wave-length. 

2. Ohmic Loss 

Due to the ohmic resistance of the wires in the 
antenna and counterpoise, there will be a heat loss. In 
grounded antennae, there is heat developed in the ground 
due to its resistance. The ohmic loss can be kept low by 
using wires of large size and by using a hurnber of wires 
in parallel. Ohmic loss increases with decreasing wave¬ 
length, due to skin effect. 

3. Eddy Current Loss 

Eddy currents are induced in metal bodies near the 
antenna, and in the ground. Eddy currents cause a loss

Waves’* p. 509.

in metal masts, -‘•t is of little use to replace 
metal masts by "wooden or concrete masts to eliminate 
eddy current loss, since considerable dielectric loss 
can occur in these types of masts. The eddy current 
loss increases with decreasing wave-length. 

4. Leakage over Insulators. 

High voltages will occur at certain points in the 
antenna and counterpoise, notably at the ends, and 
insulators will be required. Leakage over the 
insulators may occur if poor quality insulators are used 
or if they become wet. Use of good insulators will 
minimize leakage loss, leakage loss varies directly as 
the square of the wave-length. 

5. Corona Loss. 

Loss due to co. rona occurs at high voltages tend 
is due to a partial ionization of the air about the 
antenna wires which causes the air to become a partial 
conductor and carry a current. Corona does not begin 
to take place until a certain definite voltage, which 
depends on the shape and size of the conductors, is 
reached. Once this critical voltage has been exceeded, 
a large loss due to corona occurs. For a given current, 
corona loss varies directly as the wave-length. 

Therefore, the components of the loss resistance 
vary with wave-length in the following ways:- 

a. The dielectric and corona losses vary directly 
as the wave-length. 

b. The ohmic and eddy current losses increase with 
a decrease in wave-length.

c. Leakage loss is proportional to the square 
of the wave-length. 

Thus there will be a wave-length for which the 
antenna resistance is a minimum, and experiment shows 
this to be true, in general. Fig. 12 shows, 
approximately, the various components of resistance 
for an antenna, leakage loss is ordinarily neglible 
and is not shown on the graph. From the figure it 
will be seen that the dielectric loss may be approximately 
determined, if the total antenna resistance curve is 
known, by drawing a line, from the origin, parallel 
to the curve, at long wave-lengths. The radiation 
resistance curve can-be calculated, and hence the 
ohmic and eddy current loss component can be determined 
by subtraction. In this manner the antenna resistance 
may be separated into its components. 

MEASUREMENT OF ANTENNA RESISTANCE . 

There jjs a large number of methods available for 
the measurement for radio frequency resistance. Each

method has its own uses and not all are applicable 
to antenna resistance measurement. There are three 
well-known methods for measuring high frequency 
resistance, all of which were used in this investigation. 

1. Substitution Method . 

This method consists, essentially, of tuning and 
coupling the antenna to an oscillator, adjusting the 
current in the antenna to a certain value, and then 
replacing the antenna bya resistance and a reactance 
so as to bring the current back to the same value. 

This resistance is then equal to the antenna resistance, 
This is the method employed by Mr. Cornish in his 
experiments on antenna resistance. 

2. Resistance-variation Method . 

The resistance-isariation method is probably the 
simplest and best known method for the measurment of 
high frequency resistance. The method takes advantage 
of the fact that when a series circuit is tuned to 
resonance, the current that flows, is the applied 
voltage divided by the resistance of the circuit. If 
the applied voltage is kept constant, and known amounts 
of resistance added to the circuit, the actual circuit 
resistance nan be calculated from the resulting current 
changes. 

Let E = the voltage induced in the circuit from 
the oscillator. 

R Q = the circuit resistance. 

I 0 = the current with no added resistance.

(XIV) 

This method was decided on, as being the most 
readily applicable to the present problem, 

3. Reactance-variation Method, 

In this inetnod, the circuit is tuned to resonance 
with the oscillator and the current I 0 in the circuit 
noted. The tuning capacity is then increased to value 
0^ at which the current drops to I-^, and the tuning 
capacity is then reduced to value C 2 until the current 
again drops to I^. The resistance of the circuit can 
then be calculated as shown in Appendix 1. 

This method was not found to be useful for 
measuring antenna resistance, because of the distributed 
capacity of the antenna. The method was found to be 
useful, however, for calibrating the resistors 
employed in the previous methods, ho standard of

high-frequency resistance was available so that 
it was necessary to calibrate the resistors without 
using a standard resistance. 

The substitution method was the first method 
tried for measuring the resistance of the antenna. 

(4 

The circuit used is that given by Mr. Cornish ' , 
no part of the circuit being grounded. The 
laboratory oscillator (G.O.I.> was employed as a 
source of radio frequency power. It was found that 
with a given arrangement and connection of the apparatus, 
readings were obtained which could,iin general, be 
repeated coneistently. The readings wer$, however, often 
unreasonable and in some cases impossible. Thus one 
arrangement of the apparatus appeared to have negligibly 
small resistance. Placing the pieces of apparatus in 
different positions in the circuit considerably affected 
the results. In order to determine, if possible, the 
causes of these effects, and also to obtain experience 
with high frequency resistance measurement technique, 
it was decided to conduct some experiments with a 
grounded antenna. 

EXPERIMENTS- WITH A GROUNDED AETETEA 

All the conductors and apparatus used for antenna 
tuning and measuring, have some capacitance to ground, 
and the amount of this capacitance depends on the size 
of the conductor and its distance from ground. Since 
stray capacitance cannot be avoided entirely, it must

be kept as low as possible when measurements are 
being made. 

Fig. 13 shows some of the stray capacitances in the 

1ST 

measuring circuit. R^ and Rg are the resistances used 
in measuring, C and L are the tuning capacity and 
inductance. Due to the stray capacitances, the current 
in Rg will not be the same as that entering the antenna. 
Hence measurements made with R ? will, in general, give 
values different to those obtained with R^. If the 
values obtained with the two resistances do agree, it is 
reasonably certain that there is negligible stray 
capacitance in the measuring circuit. Thus, we have a 
method for testing whether or not the stray capacities in 



It should be noted that it is not always desirable

to eliminate as far as possiole the effects of stray 
capacitances, because stray capacitances exist with 
the antenna in normal operation. For example, the 
lead in insulators and bushings have capacities to 
ground which are permanently in the circuit. Also, 
the loading coil will have considerable capacitance to 
ground on account of its large physical size, while 
resistances measured with these stray capacitances 
present do not represent the true antenna resistances, 
these are the values of resistance to use in computing 
power inputs to the antenna. 

To render innocuous, the inaccuracies arising 
from stray capacitances, the arrangement of the 
measuring instruments should be studied carefully, as 
to connections and placing. Fig. 14 shows a good 
circuit arrangement for the resistance variation 
method for measuring the resistance of grounded antennae,

as given by Laport. The thermo-milliammeter is 
placed so as to read the current actually entering the 
antenna lead in bushing. and R 2 are the standard 

resistances, 0 and L the precision condenser and tuning

coil respectively. The coupling coil is placed 
nearest to the grounded point to eliminate as far as 
possible electrostatic effects between the oscillator 
and the measuring circuit. 

Since the resistance-variation method assumes 

that the voltage induced in the measuring ffiiircuit 

is constant, it is desirable to be able to test for 

constan cy of voltage. The voltage being induced 

in the circuit may be calculated by observing the 

current in the circuit for various values of inserted 

resistance. Then the voltage will be the current 

times the total resistance of the circuit. If the 

voltage is constant, the value of the inserted 

resistance to give half current plus the inserted 

resistance, when multiplied by the corresponding ' 

current will give the voltage. If the voltage is 

/ 

not constant, this product will give a value which 
depends on the voltage induced, and hance will not 
be constant. Thus we have a method for testing for 
constancy of induced voltage. This test i& not 
infallible, however, because the product is dominated 
considerably by the value of resistance to give half 

Kb 

current. The best way for insuring constant voltage 
is to place a thermo-ammeter in the tank circuit of 
the oscillator, and keeping the oscillator current

constant. 

There may be electrostatic induction between 

the tank coil of the oscillator and the coupling coil, 

because the voltage above ground, of the tank coil 

will be varying with the oscillations, causing current 

to flow through the stray capacities between the 

oscillator and the circuit. These currents may flow 

through the thermo-ammeter in the circuit thus causing 

errors in the readings. It is desirable to eliminate 

this electrostatic induction. This may be done by 

employing an electrostatic shield between the 

oscillator and the circuit. Whether or not there is 

any electrostatic induction present may be tested 

by applying the voltage from the coupling coil, to the 

circuit through a reversing switch, if the reading on 

the ammeter changes, when the leads are reversed then 

there is electrostatic induction which should be 

17 

eliminated by suitable changes in the circuit. 

Thus, we can test for the presence of stray 
capacitances, constancy of induced voltage, and 
electrostatic induction. Hone of thes8 tests are 
infallible, however.

The procedure in measuring is as follows. The 
standard resistors and Rg (Fig. 14) are set at 
zero, and the entire circuit tuned to resonance by 
means of 0. The coupling is adjusted to give a con¬ 
venient deflection on the meter. Known amounts of 
Resistance are inserted at R^» the current readings 
noted, and the resistance of the circuit computed using 
formula XIV. Then Rp is set at zero, and similar 
measurments made with Eg. If the two sets of readings 
given by R^ and Eg agree, then the circuit is probably 
properly arranged. If they do not agree, it mill be 
necessary to apply the other tests. The presence of 
stray electrostatic voltages should be determined by 
reversing the leads from the coupling coil. If there 
are no stray electrostatic voltages, then the constancy 
of the voltage induced electromagnetically should be 
determined. If the voltage is not constant, then the 
difficulty should be remedied. 

Some experiments were carried out in the above 
manner, using a grounded antenna. Two decade resistance 
boxes were used as standards. The radio frecuency power 
was obtained from a type 211-D tube connected as a 
shuntfed Hartley oscillator, with 750 volts on the 
plate. The entire oscillator and coupling coil were 
placed ina large galvanized iron box, open at one end, 
and connected to ground. 

The readings taken with the two decade boxes did 
not agree, showing that the circuit was not properly

arranged. However, it was suspected that tHe decade 
boxes were not accurate at the High frequencies used, so 
they were interchanged in the circuit. The readings were 
still different, but the error was in the opposite direction, 
showing that the boxes are not accurate at high frequencies. 
Headings were then obtained using one decade box, taking 
readings with it first as and then as R 2 . These 
readings did not agree showing that the circuit was still 
improperly arranged. The leads from the coupling coil 
were reversed, to test for stray electrostatic induction. 

It was found that reversing the leads caused the current 
to drop considerably. A large edge wound copper strip 
coil had been used as a tuning inductance. Hue to its 
large size and to its proximity to the oscillator, it was 
suspected of contributing to the electrostatic effects. 

This coil was replaced by a smaller wire-wound coil,and 
placed further away from the oscillator. The large precision 
condenser was also replaced by a smaller condenser. This 
improved the circuit considerably, and there was very little 
change in current when the leads were reversed. The constancy 
of the induced voltage was determined by the method already 
outlined, with results as shown in Table VII.The table shows 
that there is apparently very little change in voltage. It 
must be noted, however, that the values of added resistance 
shown, are the nominal resistances of the decades. When 
the true high frequency resistances of the box are used in 
the calculations, it is possible that a drop in voltage 
may be found to have occurred. To test thi&, a thermo-

and its reading was observed to change as the measuring 
circuit was tuned through resonance, showing that a slight

Since the resistor is not continuously variable, 
it was not possible to set on the half current value. 

For this reason, various known amounts of resistance were 
inserted as shown in the table. Also, the method for 
testing for constancy of induced voltage, cannot be 
applied. The value of the circuit resistance was 
calculated for each inserted amount of resistance. 

If the value of circuit resistance calculated in this 
way, is not constant, then it is possible that the 
voltage varied. A decrease in voltage will cause the 
calculated value of resistance to decrease with in¬ 
creasing amounts of inserted resistance. In the table 
it will be seen that the voltage was constant, in all 
cases except the last, and the change in this case is 
not great. 

The curve for the above data-is shown in G-raph 5. 
The total antenna resistance has been separated into its 
components. The radiation resistance' curve is that 
obtained from the tables in Pierce. The dielectric 
resistance line was drawn so that it is parallel to the 
total resistance curve, at long wave-lengths, The ohmic 
and eddy current loss resistance curve was obtained by 
subtracting the radiation and dielectric resistances 
from the total resistance,.

A result of the above experiments, it is obvious 
that there are several tests and precautions that have 
to be observed in order to obtain consistent and reliable 
results. For convenience the tests and precautions are 
enumerated below, 

TEST #1 

Measure the resistance by placing the standard 
resistance near the meter and observing the current, and 
then placing the standard resistance in a part of the 
circuit widely separated from the first point, and again 
observing the current, if the current values are the 
same in each case, it is probable that the circuit is 
properly arranged. This test is a general test on the 
circuit arrangement, whereas the following are really 
tests on particular parts of the circuit. 

In connecting the circuit it is desirable to use 
physically small apparatus, well separated from metal 
masses (such as the transmitter and the test oscillator) 
and connected with short, small wires. 

TEST # 2 

Reverse the leads from the coupling coil, and if 
the current changes then it is probable that there are 
stray electrostatic voltages in the circuit, which 
should be eliminated. An electrostatic shield may be 
necessary. 

TEST #5 

Observe the current in the circuit for various values 
of inserted resistance, and compute the quantity,

cur rent Ij t and R is the resistance to give half¬ 
current. If this quantity varies for different values 
of inserted resistance, then it is probable that the 
induced voltage is not constant. 

Accurate standards of high frequency resistance 
16. 

should be used. Decade resistance boxes were found to 
be unreliable at high frequencies, fhe change in 
resistance is due to skin effect and to stray capacities. 

It is important to set accurately on resonance when 
circuits of low r decrement are being used. If the circuit 
is not in resonance, the frequency of the oscillator 
may be changed slightly which will cause a change in the 
current in the circuit. If the standard resistances used 
are inductive it is necessary to retune the circuit each 
time the resistance is changed.

In measurements on an antenna-counterpoise system, 
it is not permissible to ground part of the circuit unless 
great care is taken. If a wrong point is grounded, currents 
will flow in the ground lead, which should be flowing in 
the counterpoise wires. So that no currents flow in the 
ground lead, the point connected to ground, should be at 
ground potential. Experiment showed that, in general, it 
is not possible to make measurements without any point 
grounded, due to stray capacities, hand capacity effects, eta

Before much progress could be made with the 
measurements on ungrounded antennae systems, it was 
found to be desirable to have an approximate value for 
the antenna resistance. From considerations of the 
power rating of the station transmitter, it was known 
that the antenna resistance was approximately 6 or 7 
ohms at 580 KG., the station frequency. 

A more accurate value for the antenna system 
resistance was obtained, using the station transmitter as 
a source of power, and the antenna loading coil for 
tuning. The G. R. Phantom Antenna Resistor was used 
as a standard resistor. The regular antenna thermo- 
ammeter was used for the current measurements. Other 
than the inserted resistance, and the slight retuning 
necessary, no changes were made in the circuit of the

be rotated inside the tank coil of the final amplifier, 
to vary the coupling of the antenna. The coupling coil 
is connected to the "neutral" of the loading coil, by 
means of a short transmission line. The "neutral" point 
in the loading coil is a point that is always at ground 
potential and is located by touching one end of a long 
wire to various parts of the coil, the neutral being 
the point where little or no arc occurs. 

The current values for various amounts of inserted 
resistance were obtained and recorded as shown in 
Table IX . The resistance of the antenna system was 
computed from formula XIV page 40, for each amount of 
inserted resistance and an average value for antenna

of 7.2 ohms obtained in this experiment includes the 
resistance of the loading coil and coupling coil. 

In order to determine the validity of the measurements, 
the testa indicated in the previous section were applied. 

The first test was applied by first adding the resistances 
at the counterpoise lead-in bushing. The readings obtained 
were shown in Table IX . Then the resistances were added

at the antenna lead-in bushing, # pfte readings obtained 
were identical with those in Table IX , and were not 
recorded. The second test could not be conveniently 
applied. The third test was applied as already inamcated. 

The value of antenna-system resistance obtained in 
this way was believed to be approximately correct, hence, 
an attempt was made to duplicate, electrically, and ona 
smaller scale, the circuit of the antenna coupling and 

19 

tuning system. A master-oscillator power-amplifier was 
constructed for the measurements. 

Connecting the coupling coml to the neutral of the 

CO ll 

loading's probably the most important characteristic of 
the station antenna system, ana will require some ex- 
Planationq It can be shown thatthe potential of the 
antenna is to the potential of the counterpoise, in the 
inverse ratio of their capacities to ground, and they 
are of opposite polarity. Considering the ground to have 
zero potential, one must be negative, when the other is 
positive. Thus there must be a point in the system that 
is always at zero potential, and this point is called the 
"neutral" of the system. By placing the coupling coil at 
or near this point, the potential above ground, of the 
coupling coil, will always be low, making the electrostatic 
coupling small• 

In order to connect the coupling coil to the neutral.

some method for locating this neutral,must be available. 

In the radio station, the neutral is located by touching 
a long wire to various points along the coil, and the 
point where no arc occurs is taken to be the neutral. 

This method for locating the neutral cannot readily be 
employed in the measuring circuit because the low voltages 
existing in the circuit, do not give an appreciable 
spark. Also, in the radio station, the neutral is 
shifted by moving taps on the loading coils so as to 
change the amount of inductance in the antenna and 
counterpoise leads, but keeping the total inductance 
constant. A simpler and more convenient method of 
shifting the neutral would be desirable. A combination 
of coils and condensers, could probably be employed 
advantageously. 

A trial circuit was constructed as shown in Pig. 15. 


V 





Pig. 15 


A coil and a condenser were employed in each lead, 
in order to be able to shift the neutral. The electrostatic 
shield shown between the tank coil and the coupling coil, 
consisted of a large coil of edge-wound copper strap, with

tile coupling coil centrally located inside. 

Various schemes for locating the neutral were tried, 
before a convenient method was found. Thus, when the 
neutral is at the centre of the coupling coil, the voltages 
above ground, of each end of the coupling coil are equal 
and opposite and small in value. When the neutral is not 
at the centre, the voltages at the ends of the coupling 
coil are not equal, and, in general, are relatively 
large due to the resonant rise of voltage that occurs in 
the circuit, hence, an approximate idea of the position 
of the "neutral” could be obtained, by noticing the 
effect on the thermo-milliammeter, of alternately placing 
a finger on each end of the coil. If the neutral is at 
the centre of the coil, the milliammeter reading vail 
change an equal and small amount each time; whereas, if 
the neutral is not at the centre, the changes will not, 
in general, be equal, and they will be large. This method 
allows the neutral to be located approximately. 

It was noticed, in using the above method that if 
the neutral was off-centre, "hand capacity” effects were 
noticeable; whereas, when the neutral is in the centre 
there were no hand capacity effects present. This 
method is not of much use, except as .an approximate check 
on- the location of the neutral. 

After the neutral had been located approximately in 
the centre of the coupling coil, by the above methods, a 
test was made for the presence of stray electrostatic 
voltages, by reversing the leads from the coupling coil. 

It was found that if the neutral was not near the centre, 




- 58 - 


then a change in the reading of the thermo-milliemmeter 
occurred, in spite of the electrostatic shield. The 
reason for this is probably that the shield is not a 
perfect shield. Ho change in the reading of the meter 
occurred when the neutral was at the centre of the coil. 

The adjustment required to accomplish this was somwhat 
critical. The methods for locating the neutral, previously, 
described, were applied, and as far as could be determined, 
the neutral appeared to be at the centre of the coupling 
coil. 

Using this method for locating the neutral, a curve 
of antenna-counterpoise resistance was obtained. This 
curve became parallel to the axis at long wave-lengths, 
the values of resistance being quite small, which is 
contrary to expectations. It was at first suspected 
that the method of locating the neutral was not sufficiently 
accurate, giving erroneous values, so search was made for a 
more positive method. 

It was observed that the neutral point is always at 
ground potential, and so it should be possible to actually 
connect it to ground, without disturbing the circuit 
appreciably. And, conversely, it should be possible to 
connect the centre of the coupling coil to ground and tune 
the circuit so that removing the ground lead doesn’t 
disturb or distune the circuit. This last experiment was 
tried, using the circuit of Pig. 15, with the centre of 
the coupling coil connected to ground through a switch and 
a thermo-milliammeter. Another meter was placed in the 
antenna lead. The counterpoise condenser (Cg) was varied

until tlie meter read a maximum. Most of this current 
went through the ground lead, as was shown on the 
mill iammur: ter in the ground lead. The antenna condenser 
() was then varied until the antenna-lead meter 
registered a maximum. The current in the ground lead 
decreased to a small value. It was found that tuning 
the antenna had slightly detuned the counterpoise, 
because the counterpoise is not a perfect shield or 
screen over the earth. By alternately tuning the 
condensers, positions could be found where both antenna 
and counterpoise were tuned, their meters registering 
equal, maxima,at the same time,- with practically zero 
current in the ground lead. Opening the switch did not 
distune the circuit at all, showing that the neutral had 
been accurately located in the centre of the coil. 
Resistance measurements could then be made. It was 
found, in the course of these experiments, that it is 
not necessary to have three thenpo-milliammeters, only 
one being needed to perform all the tuning adjustments. 
This one meter may be placed in either the antenna or 
the counterpoise leads. 

The circuit used in obtaining the resistance curve 
for the antenna-counterpoise is shown in Rig. 16. 

The coupling coil was electrostatically shielded 
from the amplifier tank circuit,and loosely coupled to 
the tank coil. The shield was grounded at the centre 
turn. The centre of the coupling coil could be grounded 
by means of a switch . The leads from the coupling 
coil to the circuit were twisted, and connected to a

reversing switch SW^. Two coils and two large 
condensers were used for tuning. The circuit, and 
antenna and counterpoise leads, were connected to a 
switch SW 3 as shown, so that the antenna and counterpoise 
could he connected into the circuit or removed as desired. 
The apparatus* in the measuring circuit was kept a good 
distance (about 6' or more) away from the amplifier and 
from the station transmitter. Also, the parts of apparatus 
in the circuit were kept well separated from each other 
and from grounded metal objects. 

The procedure adopted in making measurements in as 
follows. Switch was closed, grounding the centre 
of the coupling coil. With switch SWg on the antenna 
side, the counterpoise condenser (Cg) was tuned to 
resonance on the meter. The antenna condenser ( ) was 

then varied until the meter reading increased to another 
and greater, maximum. The counterpoise and antenna 
condensers were then varied alternately until Doth circuits 
were in resonance at the same time, the meter registering 
an optimum value of current. In this tuning procedure 
the counterpoise condenser was tuned first, because the 
distuning caused by tuning the antenna condenser, is 
less than if the reverse procedure was used. The grounding 
switch on the coupling coil was opened, and one condenser 
varied to test if the circuit was distuned. It was 
found that no distuning accurred if the above tuning 
procedure had been properly carried out. Leaving the 
switch (SWjJ open, switch SW g was changed, reversing the 
leads from the coupling coil, to test for electrostatic

coupling. When the circuit was properly arranged and 
tuned no change in meter reading occurred. Various 
amounts of known resistance were then inserted, and the 
meter readings obtained. The resistance of the circuit 
plus the resistance of the antenna to counterpoise could 
then be computed. 

Switch SWg was then thrown to the other side, removing 
the antenna and counterpoise, and connecting the circuit in 
series, so that the resistance of the measuring circuit 
alone could be obtained. Readings of the resistance of the 
circuit were obtained, at one frequency, without any ground 
connection, with the centre of the coupling coil grounded, 
and then with the case of one condenser grounded. All 
readings checked, showing that there was not much stray 
capacity. It was decided to make the readings with the 
centre of the coupling coil grounded. From these readings 
the resistance of the circuit alone could be obtained, and 
hence the resistance of the antenna to counterpoise could 
be obtained by subtraction. All the readings obtained 
in the measurements are shown in Table X , and the values 
of antenna resistance have been plotted against wave-length 
as shown in Graph VI. 

Two curves for radiation resistance are shown in the 
graph, one obtained from tables in Pierce, and the other by 

assuming a straight line distribution of current on the 

2t 

antenna.

The values of radiation resistance obtained fiom the 
tables in Pierce, will be used in this paper because they 
fit approximately, the total resistance curve, and because 
the values obtained froma straight line current distribution 
are known to be too low at short wave-lengths. Prom the 
curve of total antenna resistance, it will be observed 
that the dielectric resistance is probably negligible. 

The ohmic and eddy current loss resistance curve was 
obtained by subtracting the radiation resistance from the 
total antenna resistance. 

An explanation for the small dielectric resistance 
found when the counterpoise is used, may be obtained from 
a consideration of the origin of dielectric loss in 
antennae. The possible faulty dielectrics in the field of 
an antenna, include trees, masonry, wood, concrete, etc. 
There is very little of these types of dielectrics near the 
antenna at CKUA, and it is believed that the largest 
source of dielectric loss is to be found in the soil under 
the antenna. This soil is quite dry and sandy, so that the 
currents must flow through this soil, down to moist earth 
further below. Consider the current flow in the grounded 
antenna shown in Pig. 17a. At one instant, the current 
flows up the up-lead, into the antenna, through the capacity 
to ground, through the ground down to moist earth and 
back to the generator. It will be observed that the 
current has to flow through a considerable quantity of 
dry earth, which is a poor dielectric, causing a large 
dielectric loss. Prom the curves obtained for the

ground ed antenna, it will be seen that tliere is a large 
dieleotrio loss and a large ohmic loss oaused by this 
poor dielectric soil. 

How consider the antenna counterpoise system in 
Fig. 17b. most of the current from the antenna top flows 
to the low-resistance counterpoise and back to the generator.

Very little current flows in the ground, so that there is 
relatevely little poor dielectric in the field of the 
antenna and thus the dielectric and ohmic loss resistances 
are small. These two graphs of resistances for grounded and 
ungrounded antennae well illustrate the advantages of a 
counterpoise. 

From the graph for a grounded antenna, the total 
antenna resistance is lQ.S^and the radiation resistance

The total antenna resistance for the ungrounded antenna 
is 6.2^ and the radiation resistance is 3.52°° so the 
efficiency is 

- 3.52 *100% = 57% 

6.2 

If the resistance of the loading and coupling coils is 
included in the total resistance, then the overall 
efficiency of the antenna system is 

= 3.52 *100% = 49%

With an antenna current of 9.0 amps., the power input to 
the antenna system is 

P x = (9.0) 2 * 7.2 = 581 watts, 
of which, an amount 

P p = (9.0) 2 * 6.2 - 502 watts, 
enter the antenna itself. 

The remaining 79 watts are dissipated in the coupling 
coil and tuning system. 

The values of antenna resistance obtained for the 
antenna and counterpoise,are reasobable, and can he 
consistently repeated. The tests applied,showed the circuit 
to he arranged properly. For these reasons this method for 
measuring the resistance of ungrounded antenna systems is 
probably correct. 

The accuracy of the measurements of resistance of the 
antenna and counterpoise is not very great due to the fact 
that the difference between two fairly large quantities 
had to be obtained. Greater accuracy could be attained 
by using the coils of lower resistance. 

The method developed, for getting the neutral of

the system in the centre of the coupling coil, is 
believed to be new. It is much more accurate than the 
method which has been employed at the radio station. As 
a result of the experiments ruede it is believed that at 
long wave-lengths, it is not necessary to get the neutral 
accurately at the centre of the coupling coil. The 
approximate method described in this paper, will give con¬ 
sistent results. However, at higher frequencies more 
accurate balancing is necessary, and the accurate method for 
locating the neutral at the centre, would have to be 
employed. 

In conclusion, the author wishes to express his 
sincere thanks to Dr. H. J. MacLeod for supervising this 
investigation; and also to Mr. W. E. Cornish and Mr. D. G. 
Williams for their assistance in the many experiments 
performed.

Calibration of G.R. Phantom Antenna Resistor 
The General Radio Phantom Antenna Resistor is wound 
with flat ribbon on asbestos forms approximately 4” 8" . 

There will be some skin effect, causing an increase in 
the high frequency resistance over the direct current 
value, making it necessary to calibrate th© resistor. 

The resistance-variation method oannot be used because 
no standard of high frequency resistance is available. 

It is thus necessary to employ a method that does not 
require a standard high frequency resistance. The 
reactance-variati on immediately suggests itself as useful 
for the calibration. 

The reactance-variation method depends on the fact 
that the ratio of the inductance to the resistance of a 
circuit may he determined by measuring the sharpnessoof 
the resonance curve. If the frequency and the inductance 
are known the resistance can be determined as follows:- 
Let G 0 - the capacity to resonate the circuit to 
frequency f Q . 

I Q = the current at resonance 
Cp and Cg * the capacities necessart to reduce the 

current to I, or either side of the resonance 
curve.

The circuit employed in the calibration is shown 
in Fig. 1. Radio frequency power was obtained from the 
master oscillator-power amplifier arrangement described 
in Appendix II. This type of power supply is almost 
a necessity for the reactance variation method, (c.f. 
Moullin p. 281) in order to prevent frequency change 
with load. The resistor being calibrated was inserted 
in the circuit by merely moving a clip. In this way 
there will be probably negligible change in induced 
voltage caused by inserting the resistor. 

The data obtained is shown in the table. The 
values of the condenser readings were obtained by 
plotting a portion of the resonance curve, and reading 
the values for resonance and for 1 of the resonance

the measuring circuit affected the oscillator a graph 
of tan 0 against were plotted, where e is the phase 
angle of the whole series circuit when the capacity has 
a value of C.

These lines were plotted, and fo\jnd to be straight over 
the range of ac used in the calculations, showing that - 
there was no reaction on the oscillator. 

In this method for measuring resistance, it is 
necessary to be able to measure the width of the 
resonance curve at .707 of the current at resonance, 
withaccuracy. Several systems of measuring this width, 
were triedm but the one finally used is to obtain 
this width in terms of the scale readings of the precision 
condenser and multiplying it by the slop© of the 
calibration curve for the region used. The slope of the 
curve at the points used in the table is 0.61 /yhr/scale 
division. The width obtained in this way is probhbly 
accurate to about 

Headings were not taken for the 0-16 tap on the 
resistor because it was found that such close coupling 
was necessary as to appreciably react on the oscillator. 

In order to calibrate this tap, readings were taken on 
all taps, using the station transmitter,as shown in the 
second table.

Table 0 shows the values for the resistances of the 
different taps as obtained in each case. The second column 
in the table shows the D.G. resistance measured by a 
Wheatstone bridge, "R - Lab M are the values in Table A, 

”R - Station” the values in Table B. The fourth column 
is an average of the previous two columns and gives the 
values used in the computations. The last column shows 
the resistances to be expected if all units have the 
same resistance as the 0-4 tap. 

Table 0 shows the resistances at 580 KG. Obviously, 
these values are not the values at other frequencies. 

Ro definite formula is available for computing values 
for other frequencies, so the following formula was adopted 
Hjj - R 0 (1+ &/M) (IV) 

where 

R,. = resistance at frequency R cycles/sec. 

R = D.G. resistance,

K = a constant for any given tap. 

K was calculated for each tap, using the data in Table G, 
and giving the following values

Master-Oscillator Power-Amplifier 

In order to obtain high frequency energy at constant 
frequency and constant voltage, a master-oscillator 
power-amplifier was constructed. The circuit is shown 
in Fig. 1. 

The oscillator consisted of a type 59 tube connected 
as an "electron-coupled" oscillator. In order to further 
assume constancy of frequency, the filament and screen of 
the type 59 were supplied from batteries. 

The amplifier consisted of a pair of type 10 tubes 
as a capacity coupled pushpull class 0 amplifier. 90 
volts of B-Battery were used as bias. Two small variable 
condensers were used for neutralizing. The procedure in 
neutralizing was to place a 0-125 M. A. thermo-meter in 
the tank circuit, and with excitation on and plate 
voltage off, the neutralizing condensers were rotated 
alternately uhtil zero current was indicated in the tank 
circuit. The thermo-milliammeter was removed before 
applying the high voltage. 

For calibration of the resistor as described in 
Appendix I, the high voltage was obtained from a small 
power pack employing a type 80 rectifier, with a 
condenser input filter. The high voltage generator at 
the radio station was used as high voltage supply for the 
antenna measurements. 


* For further details see P.I.R.E. Bow, Bee. 1951. The 
cathode tap is at 1/3 of the total turns, from the ground 
end of the grid coil.

effect of Weather Conditions on 

Antenna Constants 

During the normal operation of the radio station 
it was observed that weather conditions had an effect 
on the antenna. With the usual weather conditions the 
variation in antenna constants is slight. However, 
when the antenna insulators get covered with snow or 
ice, there is a considerable change in the constants. 

The antenna has to be retuned and coupled much closer 
in order to gain the normal antenna current. 

In the week of Hov. 28, 1954, the air became very 
foggy causing a deposit of hoar-fVost on the antenna 
wires and insulators. The tap on the loading coil 
had to be moved back a turn, giving less inductance. 

This is probably due to the fact that the frost on the 
wires increased their effective diameter, giving increased 
inductance and capacity to the antenna.and thus the 
antenna requires less loading. 

The antenna resistance had increased so much that 
even with full coupling, the antenna current remained 
less than normal. The actual antenna resistance was 
measured using the station transmitter and the 
resistance-variati on method of measurement. The results 
are shown in Table I. The resistance was calculated from 
the formula 

R = IpxH-L

where R - circuit resistance. 

Rj_= added resistance. 

I » current with no added resistance, 
current with R^ added resistance. 

The voltage is shown in column 4. The last reading is 
probably in error because the meter cannot be read 
accurately at low values. The average of the resistance 
values is 11.4 ohms for the antenna system, as compared 
to 7.2 ohms normally. 

In order to determine, if possible, the cause of the 
increased resistance,the frost was brushed off most of the 
insulators, using a broom. The readings are shown in 
Table II. The ^average value for the resistance is now 
9.9 ohms. Thus brushing the frost off some of the 
insulators dropped the resistance by 1.5 ohms. The re¬ 
sistance is still in excess of the normal value. 

The frost on the insulators at the top of the antenna 
was not brushed off. Since the maximum voltage occurrs at 
the far end of the antenna, there will probably be a large 
leakage current over the end insulators, giving a large loss. 
The frost on the wires probably caused some loss also. The- 
cause of the increased resistance could probably be 
determined by a curve of antenna resistance against wave¬ 
length. 

The reason why the resistance increases with leakage 
over the insulators can be found from.a consideration of 
leakage in condensers. Leakage over the insulators at the 
end of the antenna is in parallel with the capacity of the 
antenna. The increased resistance as measured is really

an equivalent series resistance. The formula given in 
Terman "Radio Engineering" p. 27 for the equivalent 
series resistance R^ for a leakage resistance R^ in 
parallel with a condenser of capacity 0 at a frequency f 
is 

1 a 0 ( 2 7rfo)“ 

Since 

Since leakage over the insulator causes a decrease in Rg. 
Prom the formula, it can be seen that a decrease in Rg 
caused an increase in R^.
