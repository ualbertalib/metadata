ABSTRACT 


Studies were undertaken to compare certain aspects of the physiology 
of representative saprophytic and parasitic soil inhabiting fungi* Four 
fungi were studied in particular, two saprophytes Trichoderma viride Pers* 
ex Fries, and Trichocladium asperum Harz, and two parasites Ophiobolus 
graminis Sacc*, and Fomes annosus Fries* 

Comparisons were made with regard to tolerance to antibiotics, 
nutritional behaviour, and response to plant growth substances* The 
following conclusions were drawn: 

1* The saprophytes were generally more tolerant to antibiotics than 

the parasites but exceptions to this were noted* 

2. Differences in growth rate were found to be of a specific nature* 

3* Study of pH and temperature requirements suggested that certain 

combinations of these two factors alone might favour the growth 
of at least one of the parasites (0. graminis ) over the two 
saprophytes* 

4* All four fungi were capable of some growth in synthetic media 

containing nitrate as the nitrogen source, but the two parasites 
showed a much greater preference for more complex forms of 
nitrogen than did the saprophytes. 

5* F* annosus required thiamine and 0* graminis required thiamine 

and biotin for growth on a synthetic medium containing either 
inorganic or organic nitrogen* Both saprophytes grew 
satisfactorily without added vitamins.

Differences in the ability of the fungi to use representative 
carbon sources were largely of an individual nature, but the 
parasites appeared better equipped to break down the more 
complex molecules* 

Indoleacetic acid inhibited rather than stimulated all four 
fungi. 

The parasitic fungi were typically inhibited by lower concentrations 
of indoleacetic acid than were the saprophytes* 

The difference in indoleacetic acid inhibition probably resided 
in a greater ability on the part of the parasites to break 
down the molecule through enzyme action.

INTRODUCTION. 


The purpose of the investigations described here was to compare certain 
aspects of the physiology of saprophytic and parasitic soil inhabiting 
fungi and an attempt has been made to correlate the findings with the ecology 
of the fungi studied* 

The soil is not homogeneous and the ability of fungi to colonize some 
of the many habitats it presents must be correlated with their physiological 
behaviour. Waksman (216) has classified the components of the soil into 
five main groups, namely: mineral particles, plant and animal residues, 
living systems, water and gases. An indication of the complexity of soil 
environments is only obtained when the variations which occur in each of 
these main groups is considered. 

Many soil types have been recognized (168), differentiated by variations 
in size and chemical composition of the mineral particles. Locally the 
mineral constituents of the soil are augmented by the numerous break-down 
products of plant and animal remains. Living organisms varying in size 
from tree roots and small mammals to amoebae, fungi and bacteria contribute 
to the complexity of the soil both physically and chemically. Considerable 
variations are known to occur in the moisture content of the soil, and in 
the composition of the soil atmosphere. 

The number of possible combinations of these variables is almost 
incomprehensible, but in addition each of these groups is influenced by the 
others, and also by external factors such as atmospheric pressure, light, 
temperature, rainfall and snowfall, fire, trampling and tillage. Here are 
mentioned only factors of which we have some knowledge ; there may be many

more of which we know nothing. 

To attempt to unravel some of these complexities for fungi may seem 
almost foolhardy especially when consideration is given to the large numbers 
and kinds of these organisms which are to be found in the soil (10, 221), 

Optimistically, however, for the purposes of the investigations to be 
described here the soil may be divided into two main microbial environments, 
the boundary between them being the outer surface of the living roots of 
higher plants. Fungi which can cross this boundary and can colonize the 
living tissue within the roots are referred to as parasites, those that 
do not are termed saprophytes. As with most distinctions in nature the 
two groups are not mutually exclusive, many fungi exhibit both saprophytic 
and parasitic ability. Typical parasites, however, such as the two to 
be considered here do not compete successfully in the soil and typical 
obligate saprophytes do nob commonly invade living tissues. 

From the ecological point of view there are, therefore, two main 
questions. Firstly, why do parasitic fungi appear to be confined in the 
soil to living roots, their saprophytic existence being a temporary one 
in the freshly dead tissue of their hosts? That success as a parasite 
would logically be increased by extended saprophytic survival has been 
pointed out by Bawden (1|). 

Secondly, why do obligate saprophytic soil fungi not invade living 
plant tissue? Since competition between micro-organisms for nutrients 
in the soil is believed to be intense (203), why is the ample reservoir 
in the plant root not tapped by these fungi? 

The situation appears even more paradoxical when some of the

3 


characteristics which have been attributed to the two groups are 
considered, particularly of the saprophytic group* These include for 
the latter group generally greater vigour manifested in greater rates 
of growth and sporulation* and ability to colonize a variety of substrates* 
or ability to decompose special substrates such as lignin (75)j greater 
resistance to antibiotics and toxins in general and greater production of 
antibiotics (2h); parasites on the other hand* are not believed to 
possess these qualities* at least to the same degree. 

These conclusions appear to be drawn from scattered observations 
throughout the literature and surprisingly little relevant information 
is available concerning the representatives of the two groups. No 
comparative investigations appear to have been undertaken. 

The investigations are reported under three main headings: 

1* tolerance to antibiotics $ 2, nutritional behaviour* and 3* response 

to plant growth substances. 


THE FUNGI STUDIED. 


Trichoderma viride Pers. ex Fries. 

T. viride is one of the most commonly isolated soil saprophytes 
(10* 78) which probably explains the large number of references to this 
fungus in the literature. Surprisingly few references are to be found 
prior to the observations of Weindling (225) on the antagonism of this 
fungus to Rhizoctonia solani . Waksman (21U) found species of Trichoderma 









in all the soils he examined and mentions the frequency with which it had 
been reported by other investigators. Coleman (42) also listed T. koningi 
as one of the more common species found in the soil. Boswell (14), 

Boswell and Gover (15) and Boswell and Sheldon (16) found it to be present 
in acid soils, being isolated from there on filter paper soaked with 
nutrient solution. It has been recorded as a common, early recolonizer 
of sterilized soils (55, 129) and of fumigated soils (76, 133, 219 , 220). 
Comparatively few papers deal with physiological studies of T. viride . 

These will be referred to subsequently where appropriate. 

Confusion has arisen in the past over the identity of various forms 
of Trichoderma and several specific names appear in the literature. The 
situation was clarified by Bisby (9) when he demonstrated that from a 
single ascospore of Hypocrea rufa, imperfect cultures, showing all the 
variations formerly considered as specific differences, could be obtained. 
The green imperfect forms were, therefore, all classed as T. viride . 

The isolate used, chiefly, in this study and referred to throughout 
the text as Trichoderma viride was obtained from one inch below the 
surface of a wheat field soil. It was isolated on agar plates containing 
cellulose as carbon source. This isolate grew rapidly on agar plates, 
sporulating abundantly in typical concentric rings. A second isolate 
was also used in some of the experiments ’with indoleacetic acid; this 
was found on the surface of an ergot sclerotium buried in the soil and 
will be referred to as T. viride (E). This isolate produced a dense 
white growth, grew comparatively slowly, sporulating much more sparsely, 
but again showing typical zonation. 

The abundant references to the saprophytic ability of T. viride made

it a logical choice for study. 

Trichocladium asperum Harz. 

T. asperum . the second saprophyte used in this investigation, appears, 
from the paucity of the literature concerning it, to have been the subject 
of comparatively little interest. Gilman (78), who refers to it by the 
synonym Dicoccum asperum Corda, indicates that it has been recorded in 
Canada (10), Russia and the United States. It was readily isolated on 
soil plates containing cellulose, from the same soil sample as T. viride . 

It forms a thick dense type of growth both on solid and liquid media, 
producing large numbers of typical two-celled spores. The colour of 
the cultures was usually white at the periphery (on malt yeast dextrose 
agar) varying through shades of yellow and green within, and becoming 
almost black with age. 

Hughes (104) describes and illustrates the genus Trichocladium . 
Ophiobolus graminis Sacc. 

0. graminis was selected for study as being one of the most typical 
root parasites. It infects cereals and a wide variety of wild and 
cultivated grasses (155), and causes the well known disease of wheat, 

1 Take-all 1 • 0. graminis is found throughout the temperate regions of 

the world and is considered by Garrett (?2) to rank second only to stem 
rust in the economic losses it causes to wheat growing. In view of its 
importance for wheat it is of interest that the first recorded description 
appears to have been from species of Agropyron and Cynodon (Saccardo (177))• 

The life cycle and pathology of 0. graminis have been the subject of 
considerable study. Garrett (72) reviews the pertinent literature. 

The isolate of 0. graminis used in this investigation was obtained

from wheat roots# Subsequent pathogenicity tests indicated that the 
fungus was able to produce typical disease symptoms in wheat seedlings* 

In a consideration of the taxonomy of 0* graminis . Arx and Olivier (3) 
suggested that it be transferred to a new genus Gaeumannomyces and called 
G. graminis * The old name has been used in this report, carrying, it is 
felt, more significance for those who have studied the biology of the 
fungus than the new one* 

Fomes annosus Fries* 

F. annosus has been recorded as a frequent cause of root-rot and 
heart-rot of conifers in the northern hemisphere (163)* Some disagreement 
is to be found in the literature with regard to the parasitic status of 
this fungus. By some it has been regarded as a secondary parasite able 
to infect only previously invaded roots or cut stumps* Recent extensive 
investigations by Rishbeth (165, 166, 167), however, indicate clearly that 
on pines (Pinus sylvestris and P. nigra var. calabrica ) at least, F. annosus 
is a true parasite, invading living roots of all ages, but only at points 
where contact has been made with a previously infected root. Spread of 
the fungus apparently did not occur through the soil, but did occur along 
the outer surface of roots; the saprophytic life of the fungus was 
restricted to that in roots which had died after infection. 

A number of references are to be found in the literature to the 
physiology of this fungus and these will be referred to where pertinent. 

The isolate used here was obtained from the Forest Pathology 
Laboratory, Science Service, Calgary, Alberta. 


Several other fungi were used in this study but only to a limited

extent, and it is felt that a separate description here is not warranted* 


GENERAL MATERIALS AND METHODS* 


Although the particular methods used in the separate parts of the 
investigation will be considered with the experiments, certain general 
procedures apply throughout and are considered here* 

SOURCE OF MATERIALS.

Mallinkrodt - ferric sulphate, ammonium sulphate, potassium nitrate; 

Sigma - 2,4,6-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid. 

In each case the highest grade obtainable from the sources indicated 
was used. 

GLASSWARE. 

All glassware used in experiments was of ^Pyrex* 1 brand glass, and 
was cleaned in hot detergent solution ("Calgon” or n Alconox^) and rinsed 
first in tap water (6x) and then in distilled water (6x). 

STERILIZATION. 

Sterilization of dry glassware was carried out by dry heat at 250°C 
for several hours. 

Careful attention was paid to the sterilization of media and other 
solutions• 

There have been several reports In the literature of the undesirable 
effects of steam sterilization of culture media. Thus Englis and Hanahan 
(53) found that on autoclaving glucose with phosphates for 30 minutes at 
15 lbs. pressure considerable conversion to fructose occurred together with 
the development of a brown colour in the solution. Hill and Patton (102) 
showed that autoclaving tryptophane with sugars reduced the growth of 
Streptococcus faecalls . and McKeen (130) found that autoclaving glycine 
with dextrose made media toxic to Phytophthora fragariae . Ramsey and 
Lankerford (160) reported that heating of glucose resulted in the 
production of some compound stimulatory to growth of Lactobacillus fermentii . 
The nature of the compound was not determined but it was believed to be a 
product of glucose and phosphate. 

Obviously in physiological and biochemical studies changes during 
autoclaving in the identity of the compounds used is most undesirable.

Nevertheless, alternative methods of sterilization (such as filtration) 
are usually unsatisfactory especially where large volumes are required. 

If changes occur in media as a result of heating then it is likely 
that the extent of such changes will vary with the amount of heat supplied. 
This being so it would also be expected that great care would be exercised 
in controlling the temperature and the length of time for which heating 
is carried out during sterilization procedures, but unfortunately this is 
seldom the case. Most authors follow the standard procedures adopted 
before the process of steam sterilization was understood. Thus Riker and 
Riker (I 64 ) and Lilly and Barnett (124) both recommend autoclaving for 15 
or 20 minutes at 15 lbs. steam pressure, and many authors do not bother to 
state the conditions of autoclaving that were used. 

Underwood (208) pointed out that the steam pressure is no indication 
of sterilizing conditions and that the important factor is temperature, 
which is seldom recorded in the literature. He also observes that unless 
all the air is removed from the sterilizing chamber, temperatures at the 
bottom of the chamber sufficient for sterilisation may never be reached. 
Thus in all critical work in the present investigation an autoclave was 
used in which the temperature of the steam exhaust leaving the base of the 
chamber was indicated. 

The amount of heat required for sterilization depends upon the volume 
of material to be sterilized. Underwood (208) presents data which 
illustrate this and points out that the more moist the conditions the more 
rapidly does sterilization occur. In the investigation reported here, 
media and other organic materials were sterilized either in flasks or tubes 
containing 25, 20 or 15 ml. of liquid; sterilization for no more than 8 












10 


minutes at a temperature of 121°C, as indicated by the exhaust steam, was 
found to be satisfactory for such quantities* Sterilization under these 
conditions did not result in any discolouration of any of the solutions and, 
it was hoped, little alteration of the chemical constituents* 

CULTURES. 

Cultures of the fungi studied were maintained on slants of malt-yeast- 
dextrose agar in test tubes. After satisfactory development they were 
transferred to a cold room at 0°C. 

WEIGHING. 

The weighing of all chemicals for which accuracy was required was 
performed on a Mettler analytical balance, reading to five places of 
decimals (of grams). 

The same balance was employed for the determination of mycelial 
weights in physiological experiments. The mycelium was collected on filter 
papers (previously dried and weighed) and the gross dry weights determined. 
The dry weights of mycelium were obtained by difference. Drying was 
carried out in an electric oven at 75°C for 24 hours; after removal from 
the oven the filter papers were placed in a desiccator to cool before 
weighing. 

RECORDING OF DATA. 

The data from all the experiments where growth was determined are of 
two kinds, either growth in diameter on an agar plate or mycelial weights. 

The first are recorded here only as the average value of 3 or 4 
cultures. This was considered desirable to save space and sufficient as 
very close agreement usually was found between plates with the same 


treatment

The results of the experiments where mycelial weights were obtained 
are reported in full, the considerable variation inherent in this type of 
experiment necessitating this for the sake of completeness* There seems 
to be little agreement in the literature as to how this kind of data 
should be treated* In the investigation reported here either 4, 5 or 6 
flasks were harvested for each treatment* Norkrans (148)and Vining and 
Taber (209), for example, use similar numbers, but many other investigators 
do not, notably Lilly and Barnett (e*g* 126), who harvest mycelium from 
two flasks and take the mean weight. Very few investigators carry out any 
statistical analyses of this kind of datum. Here the data for the majority 
of experiments have been subjected to an analysis of variance such as was 
carried out by Taber (195) and only values significantly different at the 
1 % level have been accepted. It should be pointed out that additional 
conclusions might be drawn from some of the work if the treatment of data 
had been the same as that of the majority of workers.

PART I , INFLUENCE OF SELECTED ANTIBIOTICS ON TH E GROWTH OF TRIGMODERNA 
VIRIDE. TRICHOCLADIUM ASPERUM. OPHIOBOLUS GRAMINIS AND FOMES 
ANNOSUS. 


INTRODUCTION. 

That antibiotics play an important role in the inhibition of micro¬ 
organisms in natural soil is a matter that still awaits positive proof. 
Waksman (216) regards antibiotic production as a laboratory process 
requiring enriched culture media and the development of high yielding 
strains. It is true that antibiotic production by a micro-organism in 
a soil medium has only been demonstrated a) when the soil has been 
sterilized to remove competitive micro-organisms ( 54 , 56 , 85 , 88 , 99, 101, 
192, 246 ), b) when the soil has been sterilized and supplemented vo_th 
organic matter ( 29 , 56 , 86 , 88 , 91 , 100 , 101 , 192 , 246 , 247 ), and c) in 
unsterilized soil supplemented with large quantities of organic matter 
(88, 246, 248, 250). 

However, the methods available for the determination of antibiotics 
in soil are likely to be successful only when production is general 
throughout the sample tested; in addition there are certain factors which 
tend to limit the amounts of an antibiotic which can be detected. For 
example, many antibiotics are strongly adsorbed on clay colloids reducing 
the amount of f free antibiotic 1 in the soil solution ( 85 , 88, 109, 134, 
I 83 ), and chemical and biological breakdown has also been reported in some 
cases (29, 85 , 109, 185, 218). Further, under natural conditions, 
considering the complexity of the soil population, it is unlikely that any 











: 



13 


one antibiotic would be formed anywhere but in restricted localities. 

It is possible, as Waksman states, that enriched conditions are required 
for antibiotic production, but such conditions do occur locally in the 
soil too, in, on and around fragments of organic matter such as the debris 
of higher plants. It is in such localized environments that greatest 
microbial activity is likely to occur and here, also, antibiotic 
production would probably be greatest. This is the view of Brian (24) 
and some supporting evidence is found in the work of Wright (249, 250), 
who has demonstrated the production of gliotoxin and other antibiotics in 
the coats of wheat seeds and in wheat straw buried in the soil. 

It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that among fungi which pass 
some portion of their life history in the soil, tolerance to antibiotics 
will have considerable survival value. This raises the question whether 
parasitic fungi, which in general are relatively unsuccessful saprophytes, 
have a lower tolerance to antibiotics than saprophytic fungi. Garrett (73) 
suggests that this is the case. Butler (37, 38, 39) observed that of two 
cereal root-rot fungi, Curvularia ramosa and Helminthosporium sativum , the 
former was a much more vigorous saprophyte. This difference could be 
explained by the much greater resistance of G. ramosa to a range of 
antifungal antibiotics. Brian (24) also considers parasitic fungi to be 
in general more sensitive to antibiotics. A brief investigation was 
therefore undertaken to compare the response of Trichoderma viride . 
Trichocladium asperum . Qphiobolus graminis and Fomes armosus to various 


concentrations of some selected antibiotics

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 


ANTIBIOTICS . 

Acti-dione . 

(supplied by the Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan.) 

Acti-dione has attracted considerable interest, particularly since 
it was used successfully as early as 1948 in the control of powdery 
mildew of bean (58), and has subsequently been put into commercial use 
for the control of cherry leaf spot and certain turf grass diseases. 

Acti-dione is produced by certain strains of Streptomyces griseus 
(229, 231). Its chemical structure is beta-(2-(3,5-dimethyl~2- 
oxocyclohexyl)-2-hydroxyethyl)-glutarimide (116), from which its generic 
name cycloheximide is derived. Whiffen (229,230) reported that acti- 

dione exhibited remarkable specificity in its action on micro-organisms, 
having little effect on bacteria but being particularly effective 
against fungi. Ford et al. (60) give a review of the pertinent 
literature concerning acti-dione. 

Gliotoxin . 

(supplied by the Prairie Regional Laboratory, Saskatoon.) 

Gliotoxin was the name given by Weindling (227) to the toxic 
substance observed by him to be produced by Trichoderma viride (226) 
during his classic studies of the parasitism of T. viride on Rhizoctonia 
solani (225, 226). Brian (21) and Brian and Hemming (28) also 
demonstrated independently the production of gliotoxin by T. viride . 

Gliotoxin is described by Brian (23) as being both antibacterial 
and antifungal and has been shown to be produced by at least four fungi -

T. viride. Aspergillus fumigatus . Penicillium terlikowskii and P. 
cinerascens. 

Griseofulvin . 

(sample supplied by Dr. P® W. Brian). 

Griseofulvin was apparently first isolated as a metabolic product 
of Penicillium griseofulvum by Oxford, Raistrick and Simonart in 1939 
(153)* The same substance was isolated by Brian et al. (25) from 
P. janezewskii and called the f curling factor’, because it caused 
peculiarities in the development of the hyphae of Botrytis allii and 
other fungi. That the two substances were identical was demonstrated 
by Grove and McGowan (92) and Brian et al. (27)* Brian (22) reported 
that it is produced by at least three species of Penicillium (P. 
griseofulvum . P. patulum and P. .janezewskii )* 

Griseofulvin attracted attention not only because of its antibiotic 
properties but also because of the morphological effects it produced in 
fungal hyphae. It was noted (22) that griseofulvin was without effect 
on cellulose-walled fungi ( Qomycetes ) but was effective on fungi having 
chitinous walls, and the suggestion was made that griseofulvin was 
active in fungi in the same way that indoleacetic acid was active in 
higher plants. 

Patulin. (Clavatin, clavacin, claviformin, expansine.) 

(Obtained from the California Corporation for Biochemical Research.) 
Patulin was isolated by Anslow et al. in 1943 (2) as a metabolic 
product from two fungi, Penicillium patulum Bainer and P. expansum (Link) 
Thom. Wiesner (234) and Waksman et al. (217) reported the production 
of clavacin by Aspergillus clavatus and this was demonstrated to be

identical with patulin (8). It has since been demonstrated as a product 
of a number of fungi, including Penicillium expan sum . P. clavif orme . 

P. urticae . P. melinii . P. divergens . P. terrestre . P* novae-%eelandiae . 
Aspergillus clavatus . A* giganteus . A* terreus and Gymnoascus sp. (23). 

Patulin is antibacterial and also antifungal, in the latter case 
showing considerable specificity of action. 

Patulin has been produced synthetically (242). 

Trichothecin . 

(supplied by the Prairie Regional Laboratory, Saskatoon.) 

The name trichothecin was applied to an antifungal metabolic product 
of Trichothecium roseum by Freeman and Morrison (63). The same authors 
( 64 , 65 ) isolated the substance and determined its biological and 
chemical properties. It was reported to be highly antifungal but not 
markedly antibacterial. The behaviour of trichothecin in the soil was 
studied by Hessaydn (99, 101). 

All five antibiotics have been the subject of some detailed 
investigations, all are produced by soil fungi, and some of them have 
been demonstrated as products of more than one organism. Hence it was 
considered that they would be good representatives of this particular 
class of substances. 

Only acti-dione was soluble in water in useful amounts. Acetone 
was used as a solvent for the other four. In addition to being a good 
solvent acetone had the additional advantage of a low boiling point, 
much of it being dissipated during autoclaving.

basic medium* 

The basic medium used in the antibiotic studies was a rich organic 
medium on which all four fungi grew particularly well. It was made up 
as follows: 


Malt extract 
Yeast extract 
Glucose 
Agar 


5 grams 
5 grams 
15 grams 
17 grams 


Distilled water to make 1 litre 


INOCULUM, 

Cultures were grown at room temperature ' x in Petri dishes containing 
15 ml, of the basic medium per dish* Plugs 5 m#m* in diameter were 
cut from the periphery of the cultures where possible and used to inoculate 
the experimental media* 


PREPARATION OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDIA, 

The experimental media consisted of the basic medium in which the 
antibiotics were incorporated in concentrations of 0, 0,1, 1*0, 5*0, 

10 *0, 50*0, and 100,0 p*p*m*, except in the cases of gliotoxin and 
trichothecin where the highest concentrations used were 50*0 and 25*0 p*p.m, 
respectively* 

Solutions of the antibiotics were made up at 10 times the strength 
required for each treatment* Acti-dione was dissolved in water and the 
others were dissolved in the following concentrations of acetone: 
gliotoxin 75$; griseofulvin 50$; patulin 25$; trichothecin 25$* The

antibiotic solutions were then diluted with 9 parts of basic medium to 
give the required antibiotic concentrations* One part of water was 
added to the control for acti-dione and where acetone was used as a 
solvent this was incorporated in all treatments at the same concentration* 
The bottles of media containing acetone were stood in boiling water for 
10 minutes to permit evaporation of acetone and the volume was made up 
with distilled water* No deleterious effects on the growth of the fungi 
due to residual acetone could be detected* 

Fifteen ml* portions of the heated media were transferred to test 
tubes and autoclaved for 8 minutes* The contents of the tubes were then 
poured into Petri dishes and allowed to solidify* Twelve plates for each 
concentration of each antibiotic were prepared* 

INOCULATION AND INCUBATION* 

Three plates of each treatment were inoculated with each fungus, 
using the inoculum described above* 

The cultures were incubated at room temperature in diffused daylight 
from a northern exposure* Growth of the fungi was recorded as the 
diameter of the colonies in millimetres, and measurements were usually 
made at approximately 24 hour intervals* 

RESULTS. 

The data obtained for the growth of the four fungi are presented 
in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5* The tables contain both the means from the 
three cultures per treatment and also the percentage growth for a

particular treatment based on the control at 100$* The latter permits 
a more direct comparison between species and antibiotics, and eliminates 
such factors as inherent differences in growth rate between the various 
fungi which should be considered separately* 

The values for the percentage growth in the presence of 10 p*p.m* of 
each of the five antibiotics have been used for the graph Figure 1* Most 
of the important differences are illustrated at this concentration* 
ACTI-DIONE* (TABLE 1) 

T. viride was retarded by all concentrations above 0*1 p.p.m* and 
was strongly inhibited by 10*0 50*0 and 100*0 p*p*m. Good recovery was 
observed, and it was apparent that considerably higher concentrations 
would be required to inhibit this fungus over a longer period of time* 

T. asperum was not inhibited to the same degree as T* viride as is 
indicated by the percentage figures (100*0 p*p.m* reduced growth to 
approximately k.0% of the control), although the total surface growth of 
T. asperum was considerably less* However, if initial inhibition was 
less than with T* viride there was certainly no indication of any 
adaptation to acti-dione. 

0* graminis was more severely inhibited by acti-dione than by any 
of the other antibiotics* The lowest concentration, 0*1 p*p*m., was 
definitely inhibitive and there was not a trace of growth at 5#0 p*p*m* 

In addition even at the concentrations where growth occurred there was 
no apparent adaptation. 

F* annosus was also strongly inhibited by acti-dione but to a lesser 
extent than 0* graminis * Growth did not occur above 10*0 p.p.m, where it 
commenced only after 96 hours, but there were indications that some

adaptation may have occurred* 

Both 0. graminis and F* annosus were much more susceptible to acti- 
dione than either of the two saprophytes* 

GLIOTOXIN. (TABLE 2) 

Inhibition of T* viride « T* asperum and 0* graminis by gliotoxin 
was not particularly great and the percentage values are similar for 
concentrations up to 10*0 p*p*m* 0* graminis was initially more inhibited 
by 50*0 p*p*m. but showed progressive adaptation to it. 

F* annosus was quite strongly inhibited, 50*0 p.p.m* causing a 
considerable lag in the onset of growth; some adaptation probably occurred*

GRISEOFULVIN. (TABLE 3) 

All concentrations above 0*1 p.p.m. inhibited growth of T. viride to 
some degree; at 100.0 p.p.m. growth was only 10$ of the control. There 
was no indication of any adaptation to this antibiotic, growth rates for 
a particular concentration remaining more or less constant. It was also 
noted that the zonation which is typical of this fungus was suppressed by 
griseofulvin. 

T. asperum was less inhibited than T. viride but again all 
concentrations of griseofulvin showed some effect on growth. T. asperum 
gave no indication of adaptation to the antibiotic. It was of interest 
to note that in addition to the percentage growth the actual extent of 
growth of T. asperum at 50.0 and 100.0 p.p.m. was initially greater than 
that of T. viride . in spite of the latter 1 s typically much higher growth 
rate. 

0. graminis was generally less inhibited by griseofulvin than was 
T. viride . as indicated by the percentage figures; it also showed very 
definite adaptation to all concentrations, which was not true of either 
T. viride or T. asperum . 

The response of F. annosus differed from that of 0. graminis in that 
there was apparently no adaptation to the antibiotic and that it was only 
slightly inhibited by concentrations up to 50.0 p.p.m. - much less than 
T. viride and to about the same extent as T. asperum . At 50.0 and 100.0 
p.p.m. there was a marked reduction in growth, but not to the extent 
that occurred in T. viride.

PATULIN. (TABLE 4) 

T. viride was not appreciably inhibited by concentrations of patulin 
below 50.0 p.p.m. Definite inhibition occurred at 50.0 and 100*0 p*p*m* 
and at these concentrations there was some indication of adaptation. 

Patulin inhibited T. asperum only slightly even at 100.0 p.p.m. 

0. graminis was inhibited by all concentrations of patulin used, 
no growth occurring at 100.0 p.p.m. and only a small amount at 50.0 p.p.m. 
At concentrations of 10.0 p.p.m 0 and less there was very marked adaptation. 
Hyphal strands were produced at the higher concentrations. 

The pattern of inhibition of F. annosus was similar to that of 
0. graminis but was somewhat less in degree; adaptation was again very 
strong. Enebo (52) found an extract from Penicillium claviforme 
(believed to be patulin) to be more active against F. annosus than extracts 
from several other fungi.

TRICHOTHECIN. (TABLE 5) 

Trichothecin was quite inhibitory even at 1*0 p.p.m. to T. viride 
and prevented growth for 24 hours at 25*0 p.p.m. There was, however, 
good recovery. 

T. asperum was quite strongly inhibited by trichothecin; initially 
almost 50% reduction of growth occurred at 25*0 p.p.m. This was also 
the only antibiotic to which T. asperum showed a clear-cut adaptation® 

0® graminis did not grow in the presence of 25*0 p®p®m® of trichothecin 
but at 0®1, 1*0 and 5*0 p®p®m. was somewhat less inhibited than was 
T®viride and was rather similar to T« asperum ® Over all concentrations 
up to 25*0 p®p®m® the surface growth of 0® graminis was greater than that 
of T* asperum ® There was some adaptation to 5*0 and 10.0 p.p.m® 

All concentrations of trichothecin inhibited Fo annosus ® No growth 
occurred at 25*0 p.p.m®, growth was prevented for % hours at 10.0 p.p.m. 
and for 72 hours at 5*0 p.p.m. Growth was noticeably reduced compared 
with that of the other three fungi considered. Some adaptation probably 
occurred at 1.0 p.p.m.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. 


If a clear distinction with regard to antibiotic tolerance between 
the two saprophytes and two parasites used in this study had been found 
then it would have been good evidence in favour of the opinion of Garrett 
(73) and Brian (24) that antibiotics exert a selective action in the soil 
in favour of the saprophytes. That absolutely clear-cut differences were 
not observed does not, of course, preclude the possibility that in a 
majority of other comparisons such selectivity would be the rule. 

However, the number of exceptions recorded here make unconditional 
acceptance of Garrett 1 s view unwise until definite supporting evidence is 
obtained. 

Garrett bases his opinion on a report by Brian (22) in which the 
growth response of a number of fungi to griseofulvin was recorded. 

However, examination of the data reported by Brian does not reveal an 
obvious difference between saprophytes and parasites as Garrett suggests. 
For example, Armillaria mellea and several species of Botrytis were 
strongly inhibited. Verticillium albo-atrum and Helminthosporium avenae, 
however, were much less susceptible than T. viride , Neurospora sitophila 
and species of Mucor and Absidia . Garrett apparently also failed to 
observe that none of the Oomycetes tested were susceptible and these 
included species of Pythium and Phytophthora . Surprisingly Brian (24) 
who had not observed in his own data the phenomena which Garrett (73) had 
discovered, endorses and enlarges on the opinion of Garrett with evidence 
almost as slender. 


In the investigations reported on here, it may be stated that 


















cob l 






c'o 








: 









46 


T. aspenun showed superior resistance to antibiotics in practically all 
cases, but did not demonstrate any marked ability to adapt itself to 
inhibitory concentrations. T. viride was proportionately more susceptible 
to griseofulvin than either parasite and in addition was unable to adapt 
to this antibiotic as was 0. graminis . The latter also showed little 
more susceptibility to gliotoxin than did either of the saprophytes. 

It was of particular interest to note that with few exceptions the 
two parasites showed good adaptation to the antibiotics, superior to that 
shown by T. asperum and frequently better than that by T. viride . This 
illustrates the importance of collection of data over as long a period as 
possible, and it would have been interesting to study this phenomenon 
through a series of successive transfers on antibiotic-containing media. 

In addition it should be mentioned that in comparing antibiotics 
determination of actual inhibitory concentrations are the criteria usually 
used. However, it is possible that frequently under natural conditions 
an organism may be subjected to less than completely inhibitory 
concentrations. When such is the case the problem of distinguishing 
between saprophytes and parasites is still more difficult. Occasionally 
at such concentrations the two parasites studied are less inhibited than 
the saprophytes, while being more strongly inhibited at higher 
concentrations. In the present studies this is true in a comparison of 
0. graminis and T. viride with 1.0 and 5*0 p.p.m. of trichothecin and of 
F. annosus and T. viride at the lower concentrations of griseofulvin. 

Thus in conclusion it may be stated that although among fungi which 
inhabit the soil, resistance to antibiotics would be of greatest advantage 
to the soil saprophytes which are unable to invade living tissues, and 






























47 


that a comparative lack of resistance on the part of parasites would 
serve as a general explanation of why they are usually unsuccessful 
competitors in the soil, evidence has not been obtained which supports 
this unconditionally. Tolerance to antibiotics may be a primary factor 
for survival in certain cases and under certain conditions, but under 
other conditions it may be of minor importance, and it would seem premature 
to regard it as necessarily a major factor of distinction between 
saprophytes and parasites.

PART II 


INFLUENCE OF VARIOUS NUTRITIONAL FACTORS ON THE GROWTH OF 


TRICHODERMA VIRIDE. TRICHOCLADIUM ASPERUM. OPHIOBOLUS 
GRAMINIS AND POMES ANNOSUS. 


INTRODUCTION. 


To state that all living matter requires an external supply of 
energy is axiomatic. It follows that the availability of energy sources 
will influence the distribution of living organisms. For higher plants 
(autotrophs) sunlight is the universal energy source. Fungi, which are 
heterotrophic, must obtain the energy required for living processes from 
complex compounds in their immediate external environment. As such 
chemical compounds are exceedingly numerous and exhibit such differences 
in degree of complexity, and as they also have a localized discontinuous 
distribution in space, it is reasonable to conclude that their availability 
and type will be a factor of prime importance in the ecological 
distribution of fungi. 

Thus there is ample .justification for the study of the nutritional 
behaviour of saprophytic and parasitic fungi. It may be anticipated 
that any specific requirement of a fungus not provided by a particular 
environment will prevent colonization. Also the presence of certain 
compounds used by a portion of a mixed population of fungi such as occur 
in the soil will tend to favour that portion over the remainder of the 
population. Unfortunately, an explanation of fungal ecology on a 
strictly nutritional basis is an over-simplification; as in the case of 
higher plants other factors are of importance. These include physical 



















' 

o ' • 

»Xi * ‘ ‘ 











49 


factors, such as temperature, moisture and pH, and inorganic and organic 
inhibitors (of which antibiotics, the subject of Part I of this report, 
are examples.) 5 such organic inhibitors are probably of considerable 
importance in the resistance of most plants to the majority of fungi 
as suggested, for example, by the work of Virtanen (210), Virtanen et al. 
(213) and Turner (207). 

The importance of nutrient availability for the distribution of both 
parasitic and saprophytic fungi has been considered by many investigators 
and is implicit in the reports of many others. Thom and Morrow (201) 
divided the soil fungi into two groups, those capable of breaking down 
animal and plant remains, and those which were able to survive on the 
residual products of such decomposition. Burges (33) classified the 
soil inhabiting fungi into two groups, the root infecting fungi and the 
obligate soil saprophytes. The latter he subdivided into 1 sugar fungi 1 
and * humus fungi 1 , according to the substrate relationships. Garrett 
( 74 ) was probably the first to regard the parasitic soil fungi as a 
separate substrate group. He is not specific as to what particular 
substrates are involved in the invasion of the living host, but points 
out that this ability to invade a living root in advance of the saprophytic 
flora which invades the dead tissue gives the parasite a tremendous 
advantage from the point of view of survival* Lewis (123) formulated 
a theory of parasitism mainly on the basis of nutritional requirements, 
which was subsequently modified by Garber (70) to incorporate the effects 
of inhibitory compounds which may occur in plants.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS OF MATERIALS AND METHODS USED 
IN NUTRITIONAL STUDIES. 


In these studies growth has been taken as a criterion of the 
utilization of nutrients. If it is assumed that growth is the only 
important outcome of nutrition then this criterion is satisfactory. 

This has been the assumption of the majority of workers who have carried 
out physiological studies with fungi. Steinberg (188, 191), Robbins 
and Kavanagh (171), Foster (6l), Hawker (97) and Lilly and Barnett (124) 
summarize many examples of work of this kind. It should be pointed out, 
however, that there is a considerable amount of detailed work in the 
field of microbiology as a whole which demonstrates that utilization of 
a particular nutrient may not always result in growth. In fact, several 
methods of investigation of microbial physiology are based upon this fact. 
Such, for example, are the replacement culture methods described by 
Foster (6l). In this technique metabolism of a particular compound is 
followed in the absence of growth of the fungus. The metabolism of 
glucose has, for example, been studied in this way and although under 
dermal 1 cultural conditions metabolism of this substance would result 
in growth, in replacement cultures it is metabolized to various breakdown 
products which are again released into the medium. Such replacement 
cultures are usually maintained in the non-growing condition by eliminating 
nitrogen or some essential metabolite from the culture medium. Thus 
growth under a particular set of conditions may not be a criterion of 
utilization of a particular nutrient but only of the presence of other 
factors essential for the utilization of that nutrient.

This drawback to the use of growth as a criterion should serve to 
temper the dogmatic interpretation of results obtained from nutritional 
experiments and may serve to explain some of the differences apparent 
in the results of various investigators* 

Various methods have been evolved for the determination of fungus 
growth experimentally, none of which is completely satisfactory* 

Probably the simplest method is by measurement of surface growth 
of colonies growing on solid media* This is the only method which can 
be applied to fungi growing on solid substrates such as soil or wood* 

In the laboratory growth on media solidified with agar is usually 
measured in this way* This may be carried out in Petri dishes where 
the radius, diameter or area of the colony is measured, or in growth tubes 
of the type designed and used by Ryan et al* (176) where linear growth 
is measured* 

This method has several disadvantages, the most obvious of which is 
that no account is taken of the density of the fungal growth* An attempt 
has been made by Worley (245) to take into consideration the tangential 
as well as linear growth of fungus mycelium, but this still does not 
incorporate the vertical growth and the method is complex and seldom used* 
If radial or linear growth was always proportional to the growth in the 
other two dimensions for a given fungus, that is if each fungus had a 
characteristic colony density on an agar surface, the disadvantage might 
not be so great, but unfortunately, the constituents of the substrate 
often influence tangential and vertical growth to a greater degree than 
linear growth* This was demonstrated in the present investigations in 
an attempt to determine growth on different carbon sources* The data

Here the control medium consisted entirely of mineral salts and 
vitamins, (NH^^HPO^ being the nitrogen source. The data would indicate 
that better growth occurred in the absence of a carbon source than in its 
presence. The type of growth in the control medium consisted of very 
fine spreading surface mycelium of the type referred to by Hawker (97) as 
starvation-type growth, and in this case the diameter of the colony is 
most obviously not a satisfactory measure of growth. 

Determination of the dry weight of fungus colonies on agar plates 
have been made by Day and Hervey (50) but these authors found that the 
agar could not be removed from the mycelium without heating and that in 
this process a significant amount of soluble material was lost from the 
hyphae. 

A second objection often made to the use of agar in nutrient media 
is that it frequently contains physiologically active elements (l?0). 
However, in modern preparations impurities are reduced considerably and 
this objection is largely overcome.

Apart from these objections there are several points in favour of 
the use of agar cultures* Firstly, most fungi grow on solid substrates 
under natural conditions and the appearance of colonies on solid media are 
more typical than those on liquid. Cultures on solid media are also 
easily handled, can be moved from place to place and may be examined readily 
Observations can be made on a single colony for a long period of time, and 
data on growth can be recorded at required intervals; replication of a 
series of plates is a simple matter* 

Brancato and Golding (19) have recently discussed the validity of 
the agar-plate method for measuring fungus growth. They concluded that 
the method was satisfactory for the factors which they studied, namely: 
influence of temperature, concentration of the medium, relative humidity, 
reaction of the medium, size of spore inoculum, thickness of substrate, 
and atmosphere in the culture plate* They point out that replicate 
colonies show very close agreement, and that a characteristic growth rate 
is rapidly attained. Observations made during the investigations to be 
reported on below are in agreement with these conclusions. 

The main alternative method of determining growth in culture is the 
one employing liquid media, either still or shaken, from which mycelium 
can be removed and the dry weight determined. Lilly and Barnett (124) 
state that this is the method of choice for precise work, and in fact 
have used it to a large extent in their published work. The chief 
drawback to this method is that from each culture flask only one set of 
data can be obtained, the total growth. To determine growth rates, 
which are of greatest value for comparison of different organisms, a large 
number of flasks needs to be prepared and all but the most simple experiment

becomes impracticable. A second disadvantage is that whilst almost all 
fungi can make some growth on solid media some fungi make much poorer 
growth on liquid media. Thus the use of liquid culture may put some 
fungi at a considerable disadvantage in a comparative study. 

Foster (61) discusses the two methods of liquid culture (still or 
shaken) at some length, concluding that there are very considerable 
advantages in favour of the shaken cultures, chiefly due to factors of 
aeration and mixing of the contents of the medium, resulting in a much 
more homgeneous type of growth. 

In the nutritional studies recorded below both solid and liquid 
media were used in different experiments depending upon the advantages 
which either method appeared to offer in each particular case. Thus 
solid media were employed in the study of general growth rates, the 
influence of temperature on growth rate and general studies on nitrogen 
and vitamin requirements. Liquid media were judged to be more satisfactory 
in the determination of pH requirements, due to the liquification of agar 
at low pH, and for the study of the utilization of different carbon 
compounds where measurement of growth on agar was unsatisfactory, as 
indicated earlier (Table 6). 

The liquid cultures were not shaken, but only a small volume of 
medium was added per culture flask (20 ml. per 200 ml. Erlenmeyer) in 
order to permit maximum aeration. 

In addition, the inoculum, consisting of a plug 5 m.m. in diameter 
cut from the edge of an agar culture, was placed on the bent tip of a 
glass rod which passed through the cotton bung and held the inoculum at 
the surface of the medium, according to the method described by 


t 


' I II v 






■ : ■ , 






55 


Converse (43), see figure 8. 

Where possible the inoculum was grown on a medium corresponding to 
that used in the experiment for which it was intended* This was not 
always possible, for example in the experiments with carbohydrates where 
the choice of inoculum medium is indicated in the description of each 
experiment* 

Incubation was carried out in the dark at room temperature (except 
in the temperature studies). 


BASIC MEDIUM * 

Although certain constituents of the medium were the subject of 
experimental study the composition was basically the same throughout, 
and was made up of the following: carbon source; nitrogen source; 
major mineral sources; minor mineral sources; vitamin supplement* 

Carbon source * 

In all experiments except where the utilization of different carbon 
sources was the subject of the experiment, D-glucose was the source of 
carbon. Usually glucose was used at a rate to give 5*0 grams carbon 
per litre of complete medium (i.e* 12*51 grams); where a larger quantity 
was used this is indicated. 

The choice of glucose was based upon the fact that more fungi have 
been found to use glucose as a source of carbon than any other sugar 
( 124 ) and according to present knowledge glucose appears to play a central 
role in metabolism, and hence should be a good basic compound for 
comparative purposes*

Nitrogen source . 

Growth of 0. graminis and F. annosus in media containing organic 
sources of nitrogen was very much superior to that in media containing 
nitrate or ammonium* Asparagine was chosen as nitrogen source and was 
used at 2*36 grams per litre of medium (i.e. 0.5 gram nitrogen). 

Asparagine has been found to be a satisfactory nitrogen source for many 
fungi (97, 124). 

Major mineral sources . 

In addition to oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen, other elements 
required by fungi in appreciable amounts are potassium, magnesium, 
phosphorus and sulphur. These four elements were supplied as the salts 
KH^PO^ (1 gram per litre), MgSO^.TH^O (0.5 gram per litre). These have 
been found to be satisfactory by numerous workers. References are given 
by Steinberg (188, 191). 

Minor mineral sources. 

The trace element nutrition of fungi has been the subject of 
considerable study by Steinberg and others, e.g. Steinberg (18?) and has 
been reviewed by Perlman (156). Requirements have been demonstrated for 
iron, zinc, copper, manganese, molybdenum, calcium, gallium, scandium, 
vanadium, and cobalt (124). These requirements only become apparent where 
carefully purified media are used and in most ordinary circumstances are 
supplied as impurities in water and other constituents of the medium. 
Consequently, in this investigation, only three minor elements were added 
in the basic medium, iron, zinc and manganese, these having been reported 
probably to be required in greatest quantity. They were supplied as 
Fe2(S0^)q, ZnS0^.7H20, and MnS0^.4H20, to give per litre of medium Fe ion

0*2 milligrams, Zn ion 0*2 milligrams, and Mn ion 0.1 milligrams. 

These salts were made up in a stock solution such that 2 ml. contained 
the amounts indicated and was added to each litre of medium. 

Vitamin supplement . 

0. graminis and F. annosus both grew satisfactorily in synthetic 
media only when vitamins were present. The vitamins added to the basic 
medium had all been demonstrated to be essential for certain fungi; 
these, together with the concentrations used, were as follows: 


Thiamine hydrochloride 

100 micrograms per litre 

Pyridoxine hydrochloride 

100 micrograms per litre 

Calcium d-pantothenate 

100 micrograms per litre 

Biotin 

10 micrograms per litre 

i-Inositol 

5 milligrams per litre 

Niacinamide 

100 micrograms per litre 

p-Aminobenzoic acid 

100 micrograms per litre 


Stock solutions (in 20$ ethyl alcohol) of each of these substances 
were made up so as to contain the amount indicated above in 1 ml., 
simplifying addition of such small amounts of material to the medium. 
The solutions were stored at 0°C.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON GROWTH RATES OF TRICHODERMA VIRIDE . 
TRICHOGLADIUM ASPERUM . 0PHI0B0LU3 GRAMINIS AND POMES ANNOSUS . 

Garrett (75) observed that a high growth rate is typical of the 
common soil saprophytes, other than the lignin decomposers, this being a 
major factor in the rapid and successful colonization of such ephemeral 
substrates as the simpler sugars by these fungi. To determine how well 
this generalization applied to the four fungi under investigation a 
simple comparison of their growth rates was made. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 


A medium of the following composition was used for preparation of

the inoculum and comparison of the fungi: 


Malt extract 


5 grams 


Yeast extract 


5 grams 


Dextrose 


15 grams 


Agar 


17 grams 


Distilled water to make 1 litre* 


A complex medium of this type would be expected to provide optimum 
conditions of nutrition for the growth of all fungi* 

Petri dishes containing 15 ml# of this medium were inoculated with 
plugs 5 m 0 m. in diameter cut from cultures of the four fungi growing at 
room temperature on medium prepared in the same way* Three Petri dishes 
were inoculated with each fungus and incubation was carried out at room 
temperature* 

Measurements of the diameter in millimetres of the colonies were made 
each day or more frequently* 

RESULTS * 

Effect of the source ofthe inoculum on subsequent growth * 

Observation of variation in the growth of agar cultures of F* annosus 
inoculated with pieces of mycelium taken at random from the surface of a 
stock culture suggested that the position from which the inoculum is taken 
from a culture may influence the subsequent behaviour of the fungus* The 
importance of uniform inoculum for experimental work was obvious and so 
5 m*m* plugs were cut from the edge and from the adjacent position along a 
radius of cultures of both F. annosus and 0* graminis and their growth 
rates compared* These are illustrated graphically in Figure 2* The

growth rates are seen to be the same for the inoculum from the two sources, 
but initially there is a lag in growth rate for the plugs from the inside* 
This is most noticeable for F. annosus * 

It is at once apparent that where growth rates are to be compared 
the effect of inoculum source may be of little significance, but where 
total growth is to be compared as in the liquid culture experiments, its 
importance might be considerable* 

In all subsequent experiments where inoculum was obtained from 
cultures on agar, plugs were cut from the periphery or, if this was not 
possible, from points equally distant from the centre of the culture*

asperum. Ophiobolus graminis and Fomes annosus* 

The data for growth rates are given in Table 7 and graphically in 
Figure 3* Each value represents the average from three cultures. 

Most conspicuous is the very high growth rate of T* viride as 
measured by this method* That such a high growth rate is to be expected 
from the observed behaviour of this fungus in the soil will be discussed 
later. By contrast, the second saprophyte has the slowest growth rate 
of the four fungi and is, therefore, not typical of the group according 
to Garrett 1 s view (75)* The growth rates of F. annosus and 0. graminis 
were similar and about twice that of T. asperum * The growth of 
F. annosus was somewhat greater in this experiment than in many others 
where it was frequently observed to be somewhat slower than that of 
0* graminis . but the fact that high growth rate is not essential for 
saprophytic success and that the growth of parasitic fungi need not be 
slower than saprophytes are the main points to be drawn from these

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON GROWTH OF TRICHODERMA VIRIDS . 
TRICHOCLADIUM ASPERUM . OPHIOBOLUS GRAMINIS AND FOMES 

ANNOSUS. 


The cardinal points of temperature of fungi are usually in the 
region of 0-5°C., 20-30°C., and 30 - 35 °C. (97), but the variations between 
different fungi and even different strains of the same fungus may be 
quite marked. Although the majority of experiments reported in these 
investigations were carried out at room temperature, it was of interest 
to compare the effect of temperature on growth, a) to ascertain if room 





































64 


temperature would be satisfactory for the growth of all fungi, and b) to 
uncover any differences between the fungi in response to temperature that 
might have significance in their natural habitats. 


MATERIALS AND METHODS. 

The procedure used here was the same as that used in the previous 
experiment, except that cultures were incubated at 10°C., 15°C., 20°C., 
25°C., 30°C*, 35°C. and 40°C. Three cultures of each fungus were grown 
at each of these temperatures. The incubators used were fitted either 
with a refrigeration unit (10°C., 15°C. and 20°C.), or a heating unit 
(25°C., 30°C., 35°C. and 40°C.), and except for the 25°C. unit temperature 
control was within 1°C. Somewhat larger fluctuations occasionally 
occurred in the 25°C. cabinet due to variations in the room temperature. 

No control of humidity was available and so in addition to differences in 
temperature between the incubators there would also be large differences 
in humidity. The effect of humidity on the growth of the fungi was not 
determined independently, although it should be stated that differences 
in humidity have been shown to alter the temperature optima of Aspergillus 
niger (13) and of Penicillium chrysogenum (90). 

RESULTS. 

The results are given in Table 8 and in Figures 4 and In 

Figure 4 the growth rates are illustrated while in Figure 5 total growth 
after 120 hours is shown. 

The data indicate that considerable differences existed in the 
temperature response of the isolates of the fungi studied. For T. viride 











) 






' ■ ' ' ' 




65 


the optimum temperature was probably between 25°C. and 30°C., higher than 
that of the other three fungi* T. viride was the only fungus to make 
any growth at all at 35°C*, although here the growth was soon arrested* 
Growth of T* viride was much retarded at the lower temperatures, even at 
15°C* there was a lag of 2j days* 

T* asperum had a much lower optimum temperature (20-25°C) than 
T* viride and 30°C. was inhibitory. Growth at 10 and 15°C. was, however, 
comparatively good. 

0* graminis . like T. asperum , was inhibited by a temperature of 30°C* 
and its optimum temperature was also between 20 and 25°C• The ability 

of this fungus to grow at 10 and 15°C. was quite marked. 

The considerable lag before onset of growth for F* annosus was 
somewhat unusual. There was, however, a quite pronounced optimum at 
25°C., •■with no growth at 35°C and only a trace of growth at 15°C. 

References in the literature to the influence of temperature on the 
growth of any of the fungi considered here are few. Rishbeth (165) 
observed the growth rates of F. annosus and T* viride in Petri dishes at 
10°C., 5°C., and 0°C. At 10°C.the growth of T. viride was greater than 
that of F. annosus ; at 5°C. the growth rates were similar, while at 0°C. 

F. annosus grew faster than T. viride, although growth was very slight. 

No indication was given of the length of time over which these observations 
were made, but comparison with the results obtained in the present study 
suggests that the response at least of F. annosus to temperature was 
markedly different. This could be a characteristic difference between 
the two isolates or could be due to adaptation if Rishbeth 1 s cultures 
were incubated for a long period.

Evidence for adaptation to temperature change was illustrated in 
the present investigation by both F. annosus and T. viride, at 15°C. where 
growth commenced after a lag. Other investigators have noted that the 
apparent temperature response of fungi is influenced considerably by the 
temperature at which a culture has been previously grown (Fawcett (57))* 

The results obtained here for T. viride agree reasonably closely with 
those of Ludwig (128) for the same fungus except that he reported growth 
to occur at 40°C. and gave a somewhat higher optimum; growth at the 
lower temperatures was similarly initially poor but showed good adaptation. 

Cartwright and Findlay (41) report 23°C. to be the optimum temperature 
for F. annosus with growth occurring chiefly between 20°C. and 27°C. 
Humphrey and Siggers (105) also list F. annosus as having an optimum 
temperature between 20°C. and 24°C. The results reported above tally 
fairly closely with those of Cartwright and Findlay, and Humphrey and 
Siggers. 

No references to the effect of temperature on the growth of T. asperum 
have been found in the literature. 

The effect of temperature on the growth of 0. graminis on potato- 
dextrose agar was studied by Davis (49)* Three isolates were used and 
all showed similarity in having minimal, optimal and maximal temperatures 
of approximately 4°C., 23-24°C. and 33°C. respectively. A similar study 
was carried out by Davies (47) who used four different isolates of 
0. graminis ; differences between the isolates were demonstrated but the 
optimum was probably within the range 20-25°C. In both these reports 
growth was recorded as a total and hence differences between isolates 
could have been due to differences in the inoculum used, and final growth 













73 


rates may have been more similar than is suggested by the results. 

However, it may be concluded that the temperature response found for 
0. graminis in the present investigation was comparable to that observed 
by other authors. 

Other experiments recorded here were carried out at room temperature. 
This approximated within reasonable limits the optima for the fungi 
studied, and lack of controlled temperatures, although obviously undesirable, 
is not considered too severe a handicap in drawing conclusions. 

From the point of view of the general problem of determining 
differences between the fungi used in this study the temperature responses, 
particularly of 0. graminis and T. viride, illustrate that this factor 
alone could be a major one in determining saprophytic success in the soil. 

EFFECT OF pH OF THE MEDIUM ON GROWTH OF TR1CH0DBRMA 
VIRIDE , TRICHOCLADIUM ASFERUM . 0PHI0B0LUS GRAMINIS 
AND FOMES ANNOSUS. 


The importance of the pH of the medium on growth is illustrated, as 
pointed out by Wolf and W T olf (236) for example, in the simple procedure 
of acidification of media intended for the isolation of fungi from mixed 
cultures of bacteria and fungi. Bacteria as a group tend to prefer a 
neutral reaction. Norkrans (IAS) observes that the effect of hydrogen-ion 
concentration depends largely on the kinds and concentrations of the other 
ions present in the medium, and that pH relations found to apply under one 
set of cultural conditions may be expected to apply strictly only under 
those conditions. Hydrogen-ion concentration has long been known to be a 


















£ 














74 


critical factor for enzyme action and hence optimal pH for growth on a 
particular substrate may be expected to be that pH coinciding most closely 
with the pH optima of the enzymes required to metabolize that substrate* 

In this connection the work of Naguib (142) is of interest. He showed 
that inhibition of growth of Fusarium moniliforme at pH 4*0 on a medium 
containing sucrose could be correlated with reduction in invertase 
activity, and of sugar uptake at this pH. Lilly and Barnett (124) also 
draw attention to the correlation which may exist between the effect of 
pH on growth and on enzyme activity. In addition, pH is known to be a 
factor, influencing the absorption of ions from the medium (32, 252). 

In spite of these observations it does appear to be true that many 
species have a characteristic pH range for growth. Experiments were, 
therefore, carried out to obtain information on the pH range of T. viride . 
T. asperum . 0. graminis and F. annosus . 

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 

Liquid cultures were employed for these experiments due to the fact 
that acidified agar frequently fails to solidify, and growth was determined 
by the dry weight of mycelium produced. 

A medium of the following composition was employed: 


Asparagine 


2.36 grams 


Glucose 


15.00 grams 


Mg.S0^.7H 2 0 


0.50 grams 


Fe ion, Zn ion, Mn ion. 


Vitamin mixture 


Citrate-phosphate buffer 


340 millilitres 


Distilled water to make 1 litre

This is essentially the basic medium described earlier. Asparagine 
was used as nitrogen source here a) because it was known to support better 
growth of the parasitic fungi than inorganic nitrogen sources, and b) because 
its utilization is likely to result in less change in the pH of the medium, 
than is true for inorganic nitrogenous compounds (Norkrans ( 14 B)). 

In order to reduce pH changes during growth to a minimum it seemed 
advisable to use a buffer. Use of a buffer does have disadvantages in 
that it introduces ions additional to those required for nutrition into 
the culture medium, sometimes in rather high concentration and frequently 
in different proportions at different pH levels. This means that 
cultural conditions at different hydrogen-ion concentrations may not be 
strictly comparable. There are few buffer systems which have a 
satisfactory range for use in nutritional experiments of the kind 
performed here. Norkrans (148) and Lindeberg (12?) used a 0.04 M 
phosphate buffer comprised of various combinations of solutions of 
K^PO^, Na2HP0^, K^PO^ with r~N HGI in studies of the pH range of various 
basidiomycetes. Treschow (206) observed, however, that a phosphate 
concentration of 0.066 M prevented the growth of Psalliota bispora and 
one tenth this concentration retarded growth. Naguib (142) used succinic 
acid and Na2HP0/^ to control the pH of the medium in his experiments. 

In the experiments reported here various proportions of 0.1M citric 
acid and 0.2 M KgHPC^, were used to give solutions with pH values of 3*0, 

4.0, 5o0, 6.0 and 7.0 as determined using a Beckman pH meter (model H2). 

These solutions were then incorporated in the final medium, making up 
one third of the total volume. The obvious disadvantage of the buffer 
used was that citrate may act as a nutrient and hence give erroneous

results for the more acid pH values* However, as mentioned by Steinberg 
(183), growth on organic acids as carbon source, including citric, is 
usually poor, and Foster (61) points out that in the commercial production 
of citric acid low pH favours high yields from carbohydrate, the 
carbohydrate being used preferentially as long as it is available in 
sufficient quantity. 

200 ml. Erlenmeyer flasks containing 20 ml. of the adjusted medium 
were autoclaved for 3 minutes under standard conditions, the pH after 
autoclaving was determined and the values are given in Table 9* The 
flasks were inoculated with 5 m.m. plugs taken from the periphery of 
cultures of the fungi growing on the same medium adjusted to pH 5*5 but 
solidified with agar. The inoculum plug was supported on the bent tip 
of a glass rod as described previously. Four flasks for each pH were 
used for each fungus and the mycelium was harvested, dried and weighed 
after the period of growth indicated in Table 9* 

RESULTS. 

The dry weights of mycelium in m.m. obtained for the various 
pH values are given in Table 9 and are reproduced graphically in Figure 6. 

Considerable variation occurred between flasks of the same treatment, 
which has resulted in a lack of statistical significance between some 
of the values obtained. However, in spite of this certain features 
stand out clearly. 

Both saprophytes are able to make good growth under more acid 
conditions than the parasites. In fact, at pH 3*05 and pH 4*00 growth 
of 0. graminis and F. annosus was only slight whereas that of T. viride

was not much less than' that at higher pH values. That of T. asperum, 
although poor at the lower pH, was significantly higher at pH 4*00 and here 
growth was as great as at any other pH value. It was of interest to note, 
however, that final growth o f 0 . graminis at pH 4,00, 5*10, 6.20 and 6.90 
was as great as that of either T. viride or T. asperum . For these three 
fungi the higher pH limits of growth were not determined, and there did 
not appear to be any clear-cut optimum. For F. annosus the pH range for 
growth was apparently much narrower, lying chiefly between pH 4*00 and 6.90, 
with an optimum value probably between pH 5*10 and 6.20. Davis (49) 
found the pH optima of three strains of 0. graminis to vary between 5*6 and 
7*6 and obtained good growth up to pH 9»0. 

There are several references in the literature to the pH range of 
F. annosus . Weis and Nielson (228) found pH 4*0 - 4*5 to be the most 
favourable range, but mention the results of Lagerberg and Melin who give 
pH 6.0 as the optimum. Robak (168) found the growth range of F* annosus 
on sawdust adjusted to various pH values with hydrochloric acid to lie 
between 4*0 and 6.3* Tilford (204) found the optimum pH for F. annosus 
on malt agar to be approximately 5*0. Treschow (205) found the optimum 
pH to be 4»0 - 4*4 on 3 % malt extract and obtained no growth below pH 
3.0 or above pH 6.0. Thus there appears to be some variation in the 
values obtained by different authors, which may be due to differences in 
strains. The observations of Robak and of Tilford agree reasonably 
closely with those of the writer. 

In conclusion it may be stated that high acidity was distinctly more 
disadvantageous to the parasites than to the saprophytes under the 
conditions of these experiments, but under more alkaline conditions, while 





















83 


F. annosus was inhibited, 0* graminis made as good growth as either T. viride 
or T. asperum . 

On the basis of the observations made here media in subsequent 
experiments were adjusted to an initial pH value of 5*5* 


EFFECT OF NITROGEN SOURCE ON GROWTH OF TRICHODERMA 
VIRIDE . TRICHOCLADIUM ASPERUM . 0PHI0B0LUS GRAMINIS 
AND FOMES ANNOSUS. 


Robbins (169) divided fungi into four groups according to their 
ability to utilize different sources of nitrogen as follows: (l) able 
to use atmospheric, nitrate, ammonium and organic nitrogen; (2) able to 
use nitrate, ammonium and organic nitrogen only; (3) able to use ammonium 
and organic nitrogen only; ( 4 ) able to use organic nitrogen only. The 
concensus of opinion at the present time is that utilization of atmospheric 
nitrogen by fungi has not been satisfactorily demonstrated, (238), but the 
last three groups seem to hold satisfactorily, although exceptions have 
been reported. Thus Brian et alo (26) reported that Metarrhizium 
glutinosum was able to grow on nitrate nitrogen but not on ammonium 
nitrogen, and Newton (143) observed better growth of ALternaria solani 
on nitrate than on ammonium nitrogen. 

Some attempt has been made by various investigators to give a 
physiological explanation of the differences in nitrogen requirements 
found among fungi. The pathway of nitrate nitrogen utilization in 
ToruLa utilis has been studied by Virtanen and Csaky (211) and Virtanen 


et al. (212). Nitrate was first reduced to hydroxylamine and this 



























84 


substance then combined with alpha-keto acids; the subsequent pathway was 
identical to that of ammonium nitrogen, a sequence that has long been 
considered to occur in higher plants (202). Thus a fungus unable to use 
nitrate nitrogen is probably deficient for a mechanism necessary to carry 
out one of these initial steps, if it can use ammonium nitrogen. 

Utilization of an amino acid may be by direct incorporation into 
protein or by deamination giving ammonia. However, where growth occurs 
on one amino acid, synthesis of the other amino acid components of protein 
must involve transamination, and hence ammonium should be the preferred 
form of nitrogen. Two explanations have been put forward to account for 
the fact that it frequently is not. One is that the presence or 
utilization of ammonium may cause unfavourable conditions of pH in the 
medium (93), and the second is that a lack of suitable ammonium acceptors 
prevents conversion of ammonia to amino acids. Evidence in support of 
the second explanation has been obtained by several workers who have 
demonstrated that addition of various organic acids to culture media 
containing ammonium as nitrogen source results in an increase in the 
utilization of ammonium nitrogen (26, 93, 118, 122, 149, 161). Thus 
ability to grow only on an organic nitrogen source probably represents 
a deficiency in the production of the four carbon dicarboxylic acids. 

It is apparent, therefore, that ability to utilize nitrogen on the 
part of a fungus indicates more adequate enzymatic equipment than is 
possessed by those fungi able to grow only on ammonium or organic nitrogen, 
and similarly those which grow only on organic nitrogen may be considered 
inferior in this respect to those which are able to grow on ammonium 
nitrogen.

A consideration of the utilization of the various forms of nitrogen 
by T. viride . T. asperum . 0* graminis and F. annosus was, therefore of 
fundamental interest* 

Both 0* graminis and F* annosus were known to require vitamins; growth 
was compared on four different nitrogen sources with and without added 
vitamins* 

HATSRIALS AND METHODS* 

The medium was as follows: 

Glucose 12.51 grams 

KH 2 PO 4 1*00 grams 

MgSO^ * 7 H 2 O 0.50 grams 

Fe ion, Zn ion, Mn ion* 

Agar 17*00 grams 

Distilled water to make 1 litre* 

This was supplemented with the following 8 combinations of nitrogen 
source and vitamin supplement. The vitamins used were indicated earlier 


during the discussion of the basic medium. 

No vitamins Vitamins added 
Potassium nitrate (3*6 grams) 1 5 

Ammonium sulphate (2*34 grams) 2 6 

L-Asparagine (2*36 grams) 3 7 

Yeast hydrolysate (4*54 grams) 4 8 


The nitrogen sources were added at the rate of 0*5 grams per litre, 
the weight of yeast hydrolysate being based upon the figure of 11 * 2 ? 
nitrogen given by the manufacturer. 

















Petri dishes containing 15 ml. of medium were inoculated in the usual 
way with plugs from cultures growing on a medium corresponding to 
combination 7 above. Three dishes of each medium were inoculated with 
each fungus and measurements were made of growth in millimetres. 

RESULTS . 

The data are given in Table 10. 

The most conspicuous feature is that only T. viride and F. annosus 
made any growth on media containing ammonium sulphate, although White (232) 
demonstrated that ammonium nitrate could be used as a nitrogen source for 
0. graminis . The probable explanation is that the utilization of the 
ammonium ion by the fungi resulted in acid conditions in the medium 
unfavourable to the growth of 0. graminis and T* asperum . Growth of both 
T. viride and F. annosus on ammonium sulphate ms much reduced compared 
with that on the other sources of nitrogeno 

Both T 0 viride and T. asperum made as good growth on potassium nitrate 
as on asparagine and although growth of T. viride was better on yeast 
hydrolysate than on the other sources of nitrogen, that of T. asperum was 
much the same. However, growth on asparagine and yeast hydrolysate was 
more dense than on the inorganic nitrogen. There was no indication of 
any vitamin requirement by either of these fungi. Both would fall into 
Group 2 of Robbin 1 s classification. 

Neither 0. graminis nor F. annosus grew satisfactorily on any single 
nitrogen source (except yeast hydrolysate) without the addition of the 
vitamin supplement. Given a supply of vitamins both made better growth 
on asparagine than on inorganic nitrogen. Although the figures in Table

10 indicate growth of F. annosus on potassium nitrate plus vitamins to be 
almost as great as that on asparagine plus vitamins, growth on the former 
was strictly a starvation type of growth and was not comparable to that 
on asparagine. It was of interest to note that even starvation type 
growth was much reduced in the absence of vitamins. As in the case of 
T« viride growth of F. annosus on yeast hydrolysate was superior to that 
on asparagine plus vitamins. Stimulation of this kind has been observed 
by many investigators and is considered to be due to either unknown growth 
factors or to the availability of already synthesized material that can 
be used directly in growth. 0. graminis grew well on potassium nitrate 
when vitamins were present in the medium, and under these conditions 
nitrate may be considered a satisfactory nitrogen source for this fungus. 
Growth on asparagine was considerably better than that on potassium 
nitrate, while that on yeast hydrolysate was much more dense than on 
asparagine. 0. graminis would probably be placed in Group 2 of Robbins 
classification while F. annosus would appear to be more typical of Group 
3 . 

The observations reported here confirm the results of other 
investigators. Thus Hacskaylo et al. (93) found potassium nitrate and 
asparagine to be satisfactory nitrogen sources for T. viride and ammonium 
sulphate somewhat less favourable. According to Steinberg (191) 
utilization of nitrate nitrogen by T. viride was also reported by Slimier (U). 

Jennison et al. (110) indicated that nitrate nitrogen was unsatisfactory 
for F. annosus and for several related species. Hacskaylo et al. (93) 
reported that F. subrosea grew poorly on potassium nitrate and that all 
Basidiomycetes tested, with one exception, made slight growth on this

nitrogen source* 

0# graminis was first reported as requiring complex organic nitrogen 
for growth (59), but it was subsequently demonstrated by Garrett (71) that 
growth would occur on nitrate as nitrogen source* White (232) demonstrated 
that growth of 0* graminis would occur on nitrate provided certain vitamins 
were also present in the medium. This observation was also confirmed by 
Gilpatrick (79)* 

Thus, in conclusion, it may be stated that the saprophytes studied 
in this investigation were able to make somewhat better use of the simpler 
forms of nitrogen than were the parasites* The vitamin requirements of 
the latter are considered in greater detail below* 

THE VITAMIN REQUIREMENTS OF 0PHI0B0LUS GRAMINIS 
AMD POMES ANNOSUS * 

The data given in the previous section of this report indicate that 
satisfactory growth of 0 o graminis and F* annosus only occurred when a 
mixture of vitamins was added to the medium, and that T* viride and T* 
asperum grew satisfactorily without the addition of vitamins. A recent 
report by Gough and Lilly (87) supports this conclusion for T. viride * 

The vitamin nutrition of fungi has been the subject of considerable 
study since Schopfer (179) demonstrated that thiamine was essential to 
the growth of Fhycomyces * The literature on the subject has been 
adequately reviewed by Burkholder (34), Fries (68), Lilly and Barnett (124), 
Robbins and Kavanagh (171) and Schopfer (186).

for fungi were used in this study* 

Thiamine* 

Thiamine, or one of its components (pyrimidine and thiazole), has been 
shown to be essential for the growth of a large number of fungi, notably 
members of the Basidiomycetes ( 69 , 148)* White (232) reported that it 
was required by 0. graminis . and its essential nature for the growth of 
F. annosus was demonstrated by Rennerfelt (162) and confirmed by Fries (148) 
and Jennison et al* (110)* 

Pyridoxine * 

There have been comparatively few demonstrations of pyridoxine 
requirements among fungi. 

It has been reported as essential for certain Ascomycetes, notably 
species of Ceratostomella (67, 172), for Graphium ulmi (35), and for 
Trichophyton discoides (174)* 

Pantothenic acid* 

Requirements for pantothenic acid have been found chiefly among the 
yeasts (235), although a report by Wooster and Cheldelin (244) indicating 
a pantothenic acid deficiency in Penicillium digitatum . and one by Tatum 
and Beadle (197) of a mutant of Neurospora requiring this substance, 
suggest that pantothenic acid requirements may exist among the filamentous 
fungi. 

Biotin, 

Biotin has been shown to be essential for a number of fungi, mostly 
Ascomycetes, the yeasts in general being deficient (34)• Kogl and 
Fries (113) were probably the first to demonstrate a biotin requirement 
among filamentous fungi when they showed that Nematospora gossypii did

not grow in its absence. Fries (67) and others have demonstrated biotin 
deficiencies in fungi. Padwick (154) observed the necessity of growth 
factors present in certain plant or animal extracts for the growth of 
0. graminis on synthetic media. White (232) demonstrated that 0. graminis 
in addition to thiamine, mentioned above, also required biotin for growth, 
and this was confirmed by Gilpatrick (79)* 

Biotin is active in very much lower amounts than most of the other 
vitamins and is commonly incorporated into culture media at one tenth of 
the concentration of thiamine, for example. 

Inositol. 

It is questionable whether i-inositol may be regarded as a true 
vitamin (Cantarow and Schepartz (40)) as it is active in larger amounts 
and occurs in plant and animal tissues in greater quantities than the 
vitamins considered. According to the same authors no catalytic function 
has been demonstrated for inositol. Nevertheless, its importance has 
been demonstrated for several fungi, e.g. Kogl and Fries (113), Fries (66), 
Robbins et al. (174), Leonian and Lilly (119), Burkholder (34), and 
consequently it was considered reasonable to include it in the present 
study. 

Niacinamide. 

Deficiencies for niacin are very common among the yeasts (34), but 
appear to be rare among filamentous fungi. 
p-Aminobenzoic acid. 

Rhodotorula aurantica. was shown to be deficient for p-aminobenzoic 
acid by Robbins and Ma (173); small concentrations were found to be active. 
Deficiencies among filamentous fungi have only been reported for artificial^

produced mutants (68). 

Both niacinamide and p-aminobenzoic acid were included chiefly for 
the sake of completeness* Certain other compounds of doubtful vitamin 
status have been shown to have growth stimulating effects (e*g. choline, 
adenine and several amino acids (148)) but are not considered here* 

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 

As stated earlier in considering the methods used in nutritional 
studies the use of agar may be expected to introduce certain unknown 
substances into the medium (l?0)* Observations of 0. graminis and F. 
annosus considered in the previous section, however, indicated that the 
grade of agar used in these experiments contained vitamins, if any, in 
amounts too small to interfere with the demonstration of vitamin deficiencies 
in these two fungi* Therefore, an agar solidified basic medium was used 
in the following experiment. Asparagine was chosen as nitrogen source 
as it was the only one which was observed to support satisfactory growth 
of both species* 

The basic medium was, therefore, as follows: 


Glucose 

12*51 grams 

L-Asparagine 

2*36 grams 

KH 2 P0 4

To determine which of the seven vitamins were essential for growth 
they were added to the basic medium in 16 different combinations as 
indicated in Table 11. The concentrations used were the same as those 
described under the basic medium, namely: 

Thiamine hydrochloride 
Pyridoxine hydrochloride 
Calcium pantothenate 


100 micrograms per litre 
100 micrograms per litre 
100 micrograms per litre

100 micrograms per litre 


Biotin 
i-Inositol 
Niacinamide 
p-Aminobenzoic acid 

The pH of the media was adjusted to 5*5 after addition of the 
vitamins. 

Preparation of the Petri dishes and inoculation was carried out as 
in previous experiments. The inoculum was grown on the basic medium, 
supplemented with the complete vitamin mixture. Transfer of some 
vitamins with the inoculum was, therefore, unavoidable, and presumably 
accounted for the growth observed on the control medium. Four Petri 
dishes for each treatment were inoculated with each fungus. 

Growth in diameter was measured after the incubation times given in 
Table 11. 


RESULTS. 

The results are given in Table 11 as the mean diameter in millimetres 
of the four colonies for each treatment. 

For 0. graminis it is apparent that omission of either thiamine or

biotin resulted in a marked reduction in growth. Omission of thiamine 
alone produced the greatest effect, growth being reduced to that of the 
control; when added alone, that is in spite of biotin deficiency, it did 
cause increase in growth over the control. Omission of biotin from the 
complete mixture reduced growth very close to that with thiamine alone, 
while biotin alone did not increase growth over the control. These 
results, therefore, indicate that of the seven vitamins used here, 

0. graminis is deficient for thiamine and biotin. None of the others, 
either by omission from the complete mixture or addition separately, 
produced any distinct effect. The results of other workers using different 
isolates are, therefore, confirmed here (79, 232 ). 

F. annosus demonstrated a clear-cut deficiency for thiamine, and 
possibly a partial deficiency for pyridoxine. This was indicated by 
the fact that omission of thiamine reduced growth to that of the control 
but addition of thiamine alone to the basic medium did not increase growth 
to that on the complete mixture. Omission of pyridoxine reduced growth 
to a level similar to that given by thiamine alone. 

Thus in its thiamine deficiency this isolate of F. annosus is similar 
to those studied by other investigators (69, 110, 162). 

Figure 7 illustrates the comparative growth of these two fungi with 
and without added vitamins. 

Thus the two parasites studied in this investigation both required 
thiamine for growth. 0. graminis also required biotin, and growth of 
F. annosus was possibly further stimulated by pyridoxine. Neither 

saprophyte required any vitamin supplement for full growth.

significance from an ecological point of view has been discussed by- 
Fries (68), Attractive as this possibility might seem. Fries points out 
that thiamine deficiencies have been found among saprophytes, parasites 
and mycorrhiza formers* The clear-cut distinction between saprophytes 
and parasites with regard to vitamins reported here would appear to be 
mere coincidence* This will, however, be discussed further subsequently 
in this report. 


UTILIZATION OF VARIOUS CARBOHYDRATES BY TRICHODSRKA 
VIRIDE . TRICHOCLADIUM A5PERUM . 0PHI0B0LUS GRAMINIS 
AND POMES ANNOSUS* 


A consideration of all the carbon compounds which may act as carbon 
sources for fungi would be impracticable* Here an attempt is made to 
compare growth on a few representatives of one of the more important 
groups, the carbohydrates, which are probably the major source of carbon 
for fungi* 

MATERIALS AND METHODS* 

The basic medium considered earlier was used throughout the 
following experiments, substitutions of the various carbohydrates being 
made for glucose, which then served as a standard of comparison. The 
medium had the composition: 

Carbon source equivalent to 5*0 grams of carbon 

2*36 grams 
1.00 grams 
0*50 grams 


Asparagine 

MgSO, .7^0

Media solidified with agar proved unsatisfactory in preliminary 
studies, for differences in density of growth were frequently much greater 
than differences in diameter. Therefore the experiments were carried 
out in culture flasks using 20 ml. of medium per flask# Usually 6 
flasks for each carbon source were inoculated with each fungus and where 
possible data were collected from five, and a statistical analysis was 
carried out. 

The inoculum was grown on the basic medium with glucose as carbon 
source and consisted of 5 m.m. plugs from the edge of the cultures. The 
plugs were supported on the bent tips of glass rods to prevent them being 
submerged. 

The mycelium was harvested at different times in the various 
experiments depending on the carbohydrates used. An attempt was made to 
harvest a particular experiment when growth on any one sugar reached the 
edge of the flask. In this way, and by comparing all data to growth on 
the glucose control, it was hoped to obtain as relative results as possible. 

The carbohydrates were considered in four groups. 


KSK0S5 MONOSACCHARIDES . 

Hexoses have probably been studied to a greater degree than any other 
group with regard to utilization by fungi. The following hexoses are 
stated to occur naturally (124): D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose, 


D-galactose, L-galactose and L-sorbose. Steinberg (189) found D~glucose,

D-fructose, D-mannose and L-sorbose to be of equal value for the nutrition 
of Aspergillus niger and D-galactose to be poor* Mosher et al* (139) 
found D-glucose, D-mannose and D-galactose to give similar growth of 
Trichophyton interdigitale and D-fructose somewhat less* Tamiya (196), 

according to Lilly and Barnett (124), reported mannose to be the most 
favourable hexose for growth of Aspergillus oryzae * Growth of 
Melanospora destruens was similar on D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose, 
(Hawker (96)), but D-galactose did not support growth* Although 
D-galactose is a poor carbon source for many fungi it has been reported 
as satisfactory for Rhizopus suinus (44), Rhizoctonta (135), as well as for 
T* interdigitale mentioned above* Lilly and Barnett (125) found 
D-galactose to be used well by many fungi after an initial lag* Norkrans 
(148) found D-galactose to be a poor carbon source for various species of 
Tricholoma ; considerable variation was noticed in the utilization of the 
other hexoses, particularly of D-fructose* White (233) found glucose 
to provide optimum conditions for growth of 0* graminis , while Gilpatrick 
(79) found growth on D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose to be similar and 
better than that on D-galactose. 

In the present investigation the growth of T. viride . T* asperum . 

0. graminis and F* annosus was observed on D-glucose, D-fructose, D-mannose 
and D-galactose* 

RESULTS* 

The results are presented in Table 12» 

For T. viride fructose is apparently the best carbon source, growth 
being significantly better than on the other three hexoses* D-galactose

supported the least growth. In preliminary experiments on solid media 
it had been observed that L-sorbose did not support growth of this fungus* 

The results with T. asperum appeared similar to those with T. viride . 
D-galactose again being the poorest carbon source. This fungus was 
able to grow well on L-sorbose on solid media. 

Both 0. graminis and F. annosus grew poorly on D-galactose and growth 
on D-glucose, D-fructose and D-mannose was similar. Growth of F. annosus 
on D-fructose and D-mannose appeared better than on D-glucose but the 
differences were not quite significant. Neither of these fungi made 
appreciable growth on L-sorbose. The observations made here for 
0. graminis support those of previous investigators. 

Thus all four fungi appear similar in their ability to use hexose 
sugars with the exception of T. asperum which made good growth on L-sorbose. 

PENTOSE KPNOS ACCHARID5S. 

There have been comparatively few investigations of the utilization 
of pentoses by fungi. 

Steinberg (190) compared the growth of Aspergillus niger on a number 
of pentoses, namely: D-lyxose, D-xylose, L-xylose, D-arabinose, 

L-arabinose, D-ribose and L-ribose. Satisfactory growth occurred only 
on D-xylose and L-arabinose. Wolf (240) found that D-arabinose did not 
support growth of Ustilqgp zeae but L-arabinose and D-xylose did. Lilly 
and Barnett (125) investigated the growth of a variety of fungi on 
D-xylose and L-arabinose; D-xylose was usually the better carbon source. 
Phytophthora infestans did not grow on either D-xylose or L-arabinose, 
Schizothecium longicolle grew only slightly on L-arabinose and Thielaviopsis 




































basicola did not utilize D-xylose. Lilly and Barnett (126) compared 


the growth of a number of fungi on D- and L-arabinose. Of the two, 
L-arabinose supported better growth in all but one case, being occasionally 
as good or better than glucose. Only three of seven species of Tricholoma 
tested by Norkrans (l/+£) grew satisfactorily on D-xylose. 

Gilpatrick (79) found D-xylose slightly inferior to D-glucose as a 
carbon source for 0, graminis . No other references to the utilization 
of pentoses by the fungi studied here have been found by the author© 

Bonner (12) states that L-arabinose, D-xylose and D-ribose are the 
most widely distributed pentoses in nature. In addition to these 
three, D-arabinose has also been included in the present investigation, 

RESULTS. 

The results are presented in Table 13. Figure S illustrates the 
growth of T. asperum and F. annosus on the various pentoses, 

D-Arabinose was poorly utilized by all four fungi, and for T. viride 
and F. annosus growth was not significantly better on L-arabinose, 

For 0. graminis and T. asperum growth on L-arabinose was quite good although 
poorer than on glucose. 

Utilization of D-ribose was variable. T. asperum made very poor 
growth with this sugars F. annosus and 0. graminis made significantly 
less growth than with glucose and T. viride also made less but it was 
not significantly so. 

Growth of all the fungi on D-xy}.ose appeared reduced compared with 
that on D-glucose, but apparently only for 0. graminis was the difference 
significant*

Reference to the summary table (Table 17) or the chart (Figure 9) 
indicates that utilization of D- and L-arabinose by the parasites was 
somewhat better than by the saprophytes• Utilization of D-xylose was 

much the same, while that of D-ribose varied. 

DISACCHARIDES. 

Various disaccharides (notably sucrose) are widely distributed and 
of considerable metabolic importance in higher plants. They must, 
therefore, form potential substrate material for saprophytic and parasitic 
fungi. A study of the relative ability of T. viride . T. asperum . 

0. graminis and F. annosus to utilize these compounds for growth is, 
therefore, warranted. 

References to systematic observations on the utilization of 
disaccharides by fungi are few. Norkrans (148) found growth of all but 
one of seven species of Tricholoma to be poor on lactose. Two grew 
satisfactorily on maltose, and three similarly on sucrose. Beckman et al. 
(5) found Chalara quercina made good growth on cellobiose, maltose and 
sucrose, but poor growth on lactose and melibiose. Wolf (240) found 
sucrose, maltose and lactose to be adequately utilized by Ustilago zeae 
but cellobiose and particularly melibiose supported somewhat less growth. 
Lilly and Barnett (125) found considerable differences to exist between 
the fungi they studied with regard to utilization of disaccharides. 

Hofsten (103) found maltose and sucrose to be rapidly utilized by 
Ophiostoma multiannulatum . Craseman (45) found two species of Blastocladia 
to differ in their ability to utilize disaccharides. B. ramosa grew 
on maltose but not on sucrose, but the reverse was true of B. pringsheimii .

Golueke ( 83 ) observed Sapromyces elongatus and Apodachyla sp. to make as 
much growth on sucrose as on glucose* Vining and Taber (209) found 
Claviceps purpurea to utilize cellobiose and sucrose readily but not 
maltose* 

Of the fungi used here Gilpatrick (79) obtained best growth of 
0* graminis on maltose. That on lactose and sucrose was somewhat poorer* 

Five disaccharides were used in the present investigation: maltose, 
sucrose, lactose, melibiose and cellobiose. 

RESULTS* 

The results are given in Table 14* Figure 8 illustrates the growth 
of To viride on the disaccharides. 

Again there appear to be no consistent differences distinguishing 
the two saprophytes from the parasites* For T. viride only growth on 
sucrose was significantly different from that on D-glucose. Growth of 
T. asperum was significantly poorer on lactose and melibiose than on 
glucose or the other sugars* This might have been expected from the 
relatively poor growth of this fungus on galactose. 

Growth of 0. graminis was poor on melibiose and on maltose and just 
significantly less than that on glucose. The latter finding is contrary 
to that of Gilpatrick (79) who observed maltose to be a better carbon 
source than glucose* 

With F. annosus only cellobiose supported significantly less growth 
than D-glucose. 

The significance of these observations with respect to the enzymes 
involved in utilization of these sugars will be discussed shortly.

POLYSACCHARIDES. 

Polysaccharides form the major structural and storage constituents of 
higher plants. Invasion of higher plant cells by fungi involves the 
penetration of cell walls, the major components of which are pectin and 
cellulose. Subsequent decomposition of dead plant material in the soil 
must also involve the breakdown of these substances and of lignin. 

It is generally conceded that comparatively few fungi are able to 
attack the more complex molecules of the polysaccharides and, in 
consequence of their complexity, make somewhat slower growth than on their 
component molecules. 

Because of their association with trees much attention has been given 
to the ability of basidiomycetes to decompose cellulose. Nobles (146) 
lists many fungi which are able to decompose cellulose, and Word and 
Vitucci (147) have reviewed the literature on the microbial breakdown of 
cellulose. 

Norkrans (14$) found three species of Tricholoma out of seven to grow 
on cellulose, three also used starch and two used inuiin. Wolf (240) did 
not obtain any growth of Ustilago zeae on starch. Beckman et al. ( 5 ) 
found cellulose, inuiin, pectin and starch to be very poor sources of 
carbon for Chalara quercina . Vining and Taber (209) reported no 
appreciable growth of Claviceps purpurea on cellulose or starch. 

Thaysen and Bunker (198) report that van Iterson (10?) observed 
cellulose destruction by T. asperum . T. viride has also been frequently 
reported as attacking cellulose (e.g. Mandels (132)). 

Four polysaccharides were considered in the following experiment: 
inuiin, starch, pectin and cellulose. 

















121 


Because of the insoluble nature of cellulose and the fact that the 
experiments were carried out in still cultures a different method of 
inoculation of the flasks was used than hitherto. Instead of plugs from 
agar plates a homogenate of the mycelium in 0.25 M sodium chloride was 
used, 2 ml. of homogenate being added per flask. The method is described 
in more detail in Part III of this report® 

The insoluble nature of the cellulose powder also necessitated 
weighing the required amount separately into each culture flask rather than 
preparing it in solution with the rest of the medium. 

RESULTS. 

The data for cellulose are recorded in Table 15; for the other 
polysaccharides in Table 16.

It proved impossible to separate the mycelium of the fungi from the 
cellulose and so dry weights of mycelium could not be determined. The 
differences between the fungi were, however, so marked that the method of 
recording the observations used in Table 15 is satisfactory. 

Both 0. graminis and F. annosus produced typical mats on the surface 
of the medium. No such growth occurred with T. viride and T. asperum . 

With regard to the other polysaccharides, inulin gave poor growth 
except for T. asperum . for which it was quite satisfactory. T. viride 
and T. asperum produced significantly less mycelium on pectin than on 
glucose, as also did 0. graminis . F. annosus grew as well on pectin as 
on glucose. Starch was utilized well by all fungi, although compared 
with the other species growth of 0. graminis was not quite as good. 

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. 

The results of the studies on carbohydrates are summarized in Table 
17 and Figure 9, where the values are converted to percentages of the 
growth on the glucose control. 

Ability of a fungus to utilize a monosaccharide as the main source 
of carbon, for growth, indicates that this substance can enter one of the 
main pathways of metabolism, either directly or after some modification. 

It must be able to serve as a source of energy in energy-yielding reactions 
and in addition must provide basic building material for synthesis of the 
structural elements and the protoplasmic components. Inability of a 
compound to serve in either one of these ways would result in lack of growth 
Thus growth in itself can only give a positive indication of availability 
of a compound. It is quite possible that a sugar may be used as a

respiratory source and not for synthesis, and vice versa; either alone 
would be insufficient for growth but utilization might occur if the other 
requirement could be satisfied by a second substance. 

It would most certainly be of interest, therefore, to carry out 
respiratory studies with some of the monosaccharides that have been 
found to support poor growth here. Hofsten (103) found that neither 
L-sorbose nor D-galactose supported growth of Ophiostoma multiannulatum 
but both were quite rapidly respired. All the fungi studied grew 
considerably less well on galactose than on glucose. This could have 
been due to a lag in the synthesis of an adaptive enzyme as has been 
suggested by Lilly and Barnett (125), or due to the mechanism suggested 
above. Evidence to support the second possibility is to be found in the 
fact that except for T. asperum growth on lactose (4-D-glucose beta-D- 
galactopyranoside) was as good as on D-glucose; growth of F. annosus 
and T. viride was also superior on melibiose (6-D-glucose alpha-D- 
galactopyranoside) to that on D-galactose. Both these disaccharides 
contain 1 molecule of D-galactose. Whether any adaptation to the 
utilization of D-galactose occurred could not be determined with the 
methods used in these experiments, but there is no obvious reason why 
adaptation should be any more rapid in the presence of a glucose molecule 
than in its absence. In fact, the literature on enzymic adaptation to 
D-galatose suggests the opposite to be true (186). 

In the case of T. asperum where negative results were obtained on 
all three substrates containing D-galactose it is Impossible to determine 
if D-galactose utilization could occur© Lack of use could have been due 
to inability to produce the necessary hydrolytic enzymes to split the

disaccharides* 

The same discussion may apply to the utilization of L-arabinose in 
which the configuration of the pyranose ring is identical to that of 
D-ga3actose. Lilly and Barnett (125) suggest that if configuration has 
anything to do with the rate of utilization of these two sugars then 
fungi able to use one should be able to use the other* It was not possible 
to confirm or refute this hypothesis here as all fungi grew comparatively 
poorly on both sugars* 

The utilization of di- and poly-saccharides is rather more complicated* 
It is, of course, possible that the disaccharides at least may be utilized 
directly in the synthesis of more complex compounds, thus being utilized 
more economically than the corresponding monosaccharides. This might be 
suspected if growth on, for example, maltose or cellobiose was better than 
on glucose, but no significant increases in growth on these sugars over 
that on glucose were observed in these experiments* However, if 
utilization did occur in this way, breakdown of the molecule would also 
have to take place to provide substrates for respiration* Hence it is 
generally believed that utilization of di- and poly-saccharides involves 
first the hydrolysis of the larger molecules to monosaccharides before 
entering any of the main pathways of metabolism. Thus utilization of a 
di- or poly-saccharide will depend upon the ability of the fungus to 
secrete the necessary hydrolytic enzymes in addition to being able to use 
the constituent monosaccharides* 

In the present study it is possible to infer that a fungus is able 
to hydrolyse a particular linkage when growth occurs on a di- or poly¬ 
saccharide, but when growth is poor it is possible to conclude that the

required enzyme was lacking only if growth was good on the component 
monosaccharides. 

The conclusions drawn are summarized in Table 18. 

It is possible that all the enzymes required for the breakdown of 
starch are not produced by these fungi, hydrolysis of the 1-4 linkages 
would yield sufficient glucose for adequate growth. It is not obvious 
from the literature whether maltase is identical with one of the amylases, 
but it would seem reasonable to assume that it is. Ability to hydrolyse 
maltose would, therefore, permit growth on starch. 

A further point of interest is that although cellobiase is produced 
by all four fungi, cellulase which hydrolyses the same linkage was produced 
here only by 0® graminis and F. annosus . This suggests that more than one 
enzyme is involved in the breakdown of cellulose and hence supports the 
observations of Grimes et al. (89) and of Halliwell (95) for cellulose 
breakdown by enzymes from Hyrothecium verrucaria . Both these authors 
suggest that a rather rare enzyme is involved in the initial breakdown of 
the longer chains of insoluble cellulose. A second enzyme, more widely 
distributed than the first, is considered responsible for hydrolysing the 
linkages of the shorter chains. Halliwell points out that many 
investigations have been carried out with soluble forms of cellulose with 
comparatively small molecules, and many so called cellulases of micro¬ 
organisms have been found incapable of breaking down insoluble cellulose. 

He mentions also that many insoluble preparations of cellulose also contain 
much partially broken down material. This is of particular interest in 
connection with the results presented here as T. viride and T. asperum 
have both been reported as cellulose decomposers. It is possible that

the degree of polymerization in the preparation of cellulose powder used 
here was higher than that used by other investigators (107, 132). 

Considering the utilization of carbohydrates as a whole it is 
difficult to pick out any features which distinguish the saprophytes from 
the parasites. If anything, the parasites appear to be somewhat 
superior in the production of hydrolytic enzymes, and perhaps are able to 
make better use of more of the simple sugars than the saprophytes. For 
example, more n Goods tf appear in Table 18 for the parasites and the totals 
of the percentage growth on the monosaccharides are greater for the 
parasites. 

The possibility that the formation of adaptive enzymes was required 
in some cases before the substrates were attacked must not be overlooked. 
A lag in the onset of enzymic breakdown would appear here as reduced 
growth; only by determination of growth rates could this possibility be 
resolved. 

It is noted that some growth occurred on all carbohydrates and this 
was also observed by Lilly and Barnett (125)* This could have been 
due, in addition to utilization of the carbohydrate, to residual glucose 
transferred with the inoculum and to the fact that asparagine was the 
nitrogen source and could provide carbon for a limited amount of growth.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS* 

Although it is not possible to draw an obvious line of distinction 
between the saprophytes and parasites studied here on the basis of their 
nutritional requirements certain points stand out and are of interest. 

The growth rates of the parasites on solid media were usually 
intermediate between the two saprophytes* T. viride had a very high growth 
rate while that of T. asperum was much slower* It should be noted that 
T. viride in liquid cultures tended to produce a smaller weight of 
mycelium than the other three fungi. Growth rate alone, therefore, is 
no criterion of saprophytic ability although it seems reasonable to 
conclude that under some circumstances it could be of tremendous 
advantage, e.g* in competing with other fungi. 

The relation of temperature to growth was also seen to vary between 
species; however, at low temperatures 0. graminis would probably have 
some advantage in growth rate over both saprophytes. 

The response to pK would indicate that both of the saprophytes are 
more acid tolerant than the parasites. F. annosus had a rather 
restricted pH range while that of 0. graminis was more extended; under 
more alkaline conditions total growth of 0. graminis was as great as 
that of either saprophyte. 

The observations on nitrogen and vitamin requirements of these fungi 
were of interest because both parasites showed a preference for organic 
nitrogen and both required vitamins* Fries (68) has pointed out that 
vitamin requirements at least among the basidiomycetes appear to occur as 
much among saprophytes as among parasites, and Schopfer (180) states that 

















135 


there appear to be adequate supplies of vitamins in the soil* However, 
this requirement, together with a preference for organic nitrogen, does 
suggest that the parasites would be favoured more by an environment that 
provides these substances in abundance, such as the living plant cell* 

Given adequate nitrogen and vitamin supplies the parasites were 
observed to make good growth on rather more carbohydrates than the 
saprophytes* 

It seems entirely reasonable to conclude that from these studies 
alone combinations of conditions could be selected which would favour 
each fungus in turn over the others; the conditions of nutrition which 
appear to favour the parasites are to be found optimally in the living 
tissue of higher plants*

INTRODUCTION. 

For more than 30 years the relationship of indoleacetic acid and 
other growth substances to the growth and metabolism of higher plants 
has been a subject of intensive study. It is somewhat surprising to 
find that this interest has not been paralleled in the case of the fungi, 
particularly for parasitic fungi where the physiologies of host and 
invading cells become so intimately associated. 

It would be surprising if indoleacetic acid did not have some part 
to play in the metabolism of fungi. This substance has been shown to 
have activity for pteridophytes (105, 236), bryophytes (137, 237) and 
algae (20), as well as for seed plants. Even if fungi are not as 
closely related to plants as has been commonly assumed (133), a recent 
report by Woolley (243) suggests that indoleacetic acid or a related 
substance is of widespread occurrence throughout all living cells. 

There have, in fact, been several observations of the production of 
indoleacetic acid by fungi. Nielsen (144,145) was the first to isolate 
indoleacetic acid from fungus material. He found that Rhizopus suinus 
and Absidia ramosa produced a substance (which he called rhizopin) in 
their culture media which was active in the Avena coleoptile test. 

The medium consisted of filter paper soaked with a solution of glucose, 
ammonium tartrate and mineral salts. Boysen Jensen (17) also found

. ' . 













137 


a similar substance to be produced by Aspergillus niger in liquid media 
containing peptone or haemoglobin. He demonstrated subsequently (18) 
that simple amino acids, particularly tryptophane, could be substituted 
for the peptone and haemoglobin and give high yields of this growth 
substance. Kogl and Kostermans (114) demonstrated the production of a 
similar substance by yeast and reported that the active substances had a 
molecular weight similar to that of indoleacetic acid. Thimann (199) 
actually demonstrated that rhizopin was identical with indoleacetic acid. 

These discoveries most certainly had an important influence on the 
study of growth substances in higher plants, but surprisingly enough 
inspired no intensive investigations among fungi. This was due probably 
to several reasons; for example, indoleacetic acid did not appear to 
produce the effects on fungi that it did on higher plants, whereas other 
substances were found which did have stimulating effects on fungus growth 
(115), and also other sources of indoleacetic acid were found. 

Nevertheless, there have been occasional reports of the production 
of indoleacetic acid by fungi up to the present time. Thus Moulton 
and Link (141), Moulton (140) and Wolf (239) have demonstrated the 
production of indoleacetic acid by Ustilago zeae . Berducou (7) 
concluded that the formation of cankers in apple trees invaded by 
Nectria galligena was due to the secretion of indoelacetic acid by this 
fungus. Production of indoleacetic acid by Gymnosporangium Juniperis - 
virginianae has been demonstrated by Wolf (241)* Gentile and Klein (77) 
have demonstrated the production of indoleacetic acid in liquid media 
by Diplodia natalensis . Pilet (158) found that leaves of Euphorbia 


parasitized with Uromyces have a higher indoleacetic acid content than 































138 


healthy leaves; a similar finding has been reported by Shaw and Hawkins 
(182) for rusted wheat and mildewed barley leaves. 

It is of interest that all these observations have been made on 
parasitic fungi, several of them because of the morphological changes that 
have been produced in infected host plants. As the original observations 
of indoleacetic acid production by fungi were made with saprophytes, there 
are no grounds for concluding that indoleacetic acid production is a 
characteristic distinguishing parasitic from saprophytic fungi. It would, 
however, seem reasonable to conclude that indoleacetic acid production is 
a fairly general phenomenon in fungi. 

Comparatively few investigations have been made of the effect of plant 
growth substances on fungi. Leonian and Lilly (117) tested the effect 
of indoleacetic acid on a large number of fungi and failed to obtain any 
stimulatory response. Fries (68) refers to the reports of Kerl (112) 
and Defago (51) who claimed considerable increases in the growth of 
Pyronema confluens and Tilletia tritici, respectively, due to indoleacetic 
acid. Anker (1) reported an increase in the rate of oxidation of glucose 
by Saccharomvces cerevisiae in the presence of indoleacetic acid and 
Berducou (6) claimed indoleacetic acid acted as a mutagen for Nectria 
galligena . Richards (I 63 ) found several growth substances at low concen¬ 
trations to have minor stimulatory effects on various fungi, high concen¬ 
trations were inhibitory. Fraser (62) concluded that under some conditions 
indoleacetic acid stimulated growth of Psalliota hortensis . but was inhibitory 
under others. Nysterakis (150, 151) reported that Neurospora tetrasperma 
was not inhibited by high concentrations of indoleacetic acid and that 
inhibition of Nectria galligena by indoleacetic acid could be overcome by

an unidentified extract of cotton* Gentile and Klein (77) showed that 
indoleacetic acid inhibited the growth of Diplodia natalensis . but pointed 
out that the determination of the effects of indoleacetic acid on fungi 
are complicated by the fact that this substance is produced endogenously, 
which is not the case in the oat coleoptile. The effect produced by 
added indoleacetic acid on the growth of a fungus would, therefore, be 
influenced by the amount already present in the mycelium or secreted 
into the medium. The latter would.in turn vary according to the 
constituents of the medium - media containing tryptophane would support 
better indoleacetic acid formation than media containing other sources of 
nitrogen. They attempted to demonstrate that indoleacetic acid was 
necessary for the growth of D. natalensis by using 2,4,6-trichlorophenoxy- 
acetic acid as an antimetabolite. Growth was inhibited by the latter 
substance and this inhibition could be overcome by adding indoleacetic acid. 

Petursen (157) found indoleacetic acid to be without effect on the 
germination of uredospores of Puccinia graminis var tritici except at 
concentrations of 200 p.p.m. and higher, where it was inhibitory. However, 
stimulation of germination of uredospores by indoleacetic acid has been 
reported by Sumere et al. (194)• 

In addition mention should be made of reports of the value of plant 
growth substances as systemic fungicides. Thus Crowdy ( 46 ) found 
indolebutyric acid effective in reducing apple canker caused by Nectria 
galligena, although it had little effect on the organism in culture. 

Davis and Dimond ( 48 ) found several growth substances to reduce disease 
caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. lycopersici in tomato plants; again little 
activity was observed in culture. Hemphill and Goodman ( 98 ) obtained 





















140 


increased control of Erwinia amylovora with antibiotic treatments by- 
including indoleacetic acid as well# 

A further indication that indoleacetic acid is a natural metabolite 
of fungi comes from the report of Sequeira and Steeves (181) that an 
indoleacetic acid oxidase is produced by Omphalia flavida # 

To summarize, therefore: fungi have been shown to produce indoleacetic 
acid both in culture and in living plant hosts; indoleacetic acid has been 
shown to be physiologically active, inhibiting growth at high concentrations 
and, possibly under certain conditions, increasing growth at low 
concentrations; breakdown of indoleacetic acid has been demonstrated for 
one fungus# Thus it may be concluded that indoleacetic acid is probably 
important in fungus metabolism and also in the physiology of host-parasite 
relations# 

The experiments to be described below were first initiated on the 
basis of a report by Waygood et al. (222) that indoleacetic acid 
stimulated the production of pectin-esterase by Cladosporium herbaru m# 
Unfortunately, to the writer* s knowledge, no full account of this work has 
been published, for such a finding, if confirmed, would be of considerable 
significance# Attempts to duplicate these results with the fungi 
studied here were not successful, but additional observations of interest 


were made

EFFECT OF INDOLEACETIC ACID AND OTHER PLANT GROWTH 
SUBSTANCES ON THE GROWTH OF TRICHODERMA VIRIDE . 

TR1CHOCLADIUM ASPERUM . QPHI030LUS GRAMINIS . FOMES 
ANNOSUS AND CERTAIN OTHER FUNGI* 

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 

A determination of the amount of growth under various conditions 
being the main purpose of the experiments in this section, the materials 
and methods were mostly the same as in the nutritional studies. Part II. 
However, certain points require special mention here. 

Medium* 

The medium used was identical with that employed in the nutritional 
studies with the exception that in some of the early experiments 1 gram 
per litre of yeast extract was used instead of the vitamin mixture* 
Comparison of data indicated that the change from yeast extract to the 
vitamin mixture did not affect the responses of the fungi to indoleacetic 
acid. 

Inoculum* 

Inoculation of solid media was carried out as previously, but the 
method used for inoculation of liquid cultures differed from that used 
in most of the experiments described so far. Briefly it was as follows: 
The culture medium from flask cultures, approximately three weeks old, 
was removed and each mat then washed aseptically three times with chilled 
sterile distilled water. The mats were then transferred to a sterile 
semi-micro monel-metal jar of a Waring blendor assembly, and approximately 
20 ml. of chilled (0°C) sterile 0.25 M sodium chloride added for each 













) •' 


- ....... a 







142 


mat used. The mycelium was then disintegrated for 1 minute at 0°C. 

The resulting suspension served as a uniform viable inoculum. Usually 
2 mlo (by pipette) was used to inoculate each culture flask. 

The blendor jar was sterilized by first washing in hot detergent and 
rinsing in hot water, then rising 3 times with cold methyl alcohol and 
finally rinsing 3 times with cold sterile distilled water. 

Indoieacetlc acid solutions. 

A stock solution of 500 x 10 y M indoleacetic acid was usually 
prepared for each experiment. In the early experiment ethyl alcohol 
was used to aid solution, but because of the possibility that alcohol 
might be physiologically active, ~~K0H was used subsequently. Comparison 
of the results obtained with the two solvents suggested that ethyl 
alcohol had no influence on the effect of indoleacetic acid. 

Composition of the experimental media. 

Solutions of indoleacetic acid were made up at five times the 
concentration required in the experimental media. The indoleacetic acid 
solutions were incorporated in the media so that in making up the latter 
to the final volume they were diluted to the required strength. Final 
concentrations of 0, 0.01, 0.10, 1.00, 10.00, 50.00 and 100.00 x 10 ^ M 

were used. An equal amount of solvent was added to the control as to 

N 

the other treatments. The pH was adjusted to 5*5 with ~ hydrochloric 
acid. 

In the experiments involving other growth substances the treatment 


was similar.

EFFECT OF INDOLEACETIC ACID ON GROUT! f ./ITU PECTIN 

AS CARBON SOURCE - PRELIMINARY ELPERIEENTo 

Waygood et al. (222) reported that growth of Cladosporium herbarum 
on pectin was stimulated by indoleacetic acid at low concentrations and 
inhibited at high concentrations. The secretion of pectinesterase was 
particularly increased by 10“5 m indoleacetic acid and inhibited by 
10"! M. It was also observed that no such responses occurred with 
sucrose as carbon source. 

A brief investigation was, therefore, carried out to determine if 
indoleacetic acid could stimulate growth of the fungi under investigation 
in the present study on pectin. 

The methods used were as indicated above. An equivalent amount of 

pectin was substituted for glucose in the basic medium, and indoleacetic 

-5 

acid was used at 0.00, 0.01, 0.10, 1.00, and 10.00 x 10 M. 

RESULTSo 

Two fungi were used, 0, graminis and T. viride (E); the results 
are given in Table 19. 

No stimulation of the growth of either fungus was observed© However, 
it was noticed that the extent of inhibition of 0. graminis at 10 x 10“ ^ M 
was much greater than that of T. viride (E) at this concentration. In 
fact, whereas there was no significant difference in the growth of 
T. viride (E) with the various concentrations of indoleacetic acid, growth 
of 2® graminis was significantly reduced compared with the control. It 
was decided, therefore, to investigate the effect of indoleacetic acid 
further, using additional fungi and a wider range of concentrations.

EFFECT OF INDOLEACETIC ACID ON THE GROWTH OF VARIOUS 

FUNGI IN LIQUID MEDIA , 

The experiments to be reported here were carried out as described 
above with the difference that D-glucose was used as carbon source instead 
of pectin, and concentrations of 50 x 10~5 m and 100 x 10“5 m indoleacetic 
acid were added# 

RESULTS# 

The results obtained for the four fungi primarily considered in 
these studies are given in Table 20# It can be seen that at none of 
the concentrations of indoleacetic acid used was the growth of either 
T. viride or T. asperum significantly reduced from that of the control# 

0. graminis did not grow in the presence of indoleacetic acid at a 
concentration of 50 x 10~- M, while a concentration of 10 x 10~5 m 
significantly reduced growth from that of the control# Fo annosus 
showed even greater sensitivity to indoleacetic acid than 0. graminis , 
growth being completely inhibited by a concentration of 10 x 10~5 M and 
significantly reduced by a concentration of 1 x 10“5 M. 

These results would suggest that the two parasitic fungi are 
inhibited by indoleacetic acid at a much lower concentration than are 
the saprophytes. It was considered advisable to repeat these experiments 
and extend them to include other fungi. The results obtained from 
some of these experiments are summarized in Table 21. The additional 
species included here were Pyronema sp<> obtained from the surface of 
sterilized soil, Rhizopus sp. from wheat field soil, S.14, a soil 
saprophyte, from the same soil, Fusarium culmorum and Pythium de Baryanum

from the laboratory culture collection, and Botrytis sp* isolated from a 
diseased onion bulb. 

The data in Table 21 confirmed the previous results, indicating 
that under the conditions of the experiments the saprophytic fungi were 
quite tolerant to concentrations of 100 x 10~5 m indoleacetic acid while 
for the most part the parasites were inhibited by much lower concentrations* 

INVESTIGATION OF APPARENT INCREASES IN DRY WEIGHT 

OF MYCELIUM DUE TO INDOLEACETIC ACID * 

From Table 21 it would appear that various concentrations of 
indoleacetic acid supported better growth than did the controls* Except 
for Botrytis sp* this appeared to be true only for the saprophytes* 

However, when such data were analysed statistically the increases in 
growth were found to fall short of the requirements for significance, 
except in one case* The pertinent data have been taken from the various 
experiments and summarized in Table 22. 

The increase in growth of T. asperum at 50 x 10”5 M indoleacetic 
acid was significant in one experiment and almost significant in a second* 

As there have been occasional reports in the literature of stimulation 
of fungus growth by indoleacetic acid it was decided to carry out a further 
experiment with T. viride and T* asperum using a range of concentrations 
from 20 x 10~5 M to 100 x M. It was considered possible that an 

optimum indoleacetic acid concentration might lie between the 
concentrations previously used, and hence the stimulation previously 
observed would be less than the optimum* 

The procedure followed was the same as was used previously and the

concentrations of indoleacetic acid used are indicated in Table 23. 

RESULTS. 

The results are given in Table 23. No significant differences 
were found between the amounts of growth at the various concentrations 
for either fungus. 

Thus it is concluded that at the concentrations used in these 
experiments, indoleacetic acid produced no consistent increase in dry 
weight of mycelium of the fungi studied. The occasional stimulation 
observed does, however, suggest that there may be some conditions under 
which indoleacetic acid can cause an increase in growth, but that these 
apparently were not the conditions operating in these experiments. 

It should be pointed out that in addition to being influenced by 
an endogenous production of indoleacetic acid (77) the experiments 
carried out here and those of other investigators differ from Avena 
coleoptile experiments in that in the latter an increase in growth in 
length of a part of an organ is measured. Observations of increase in 
growth of fungus material under the influence of indoleacetic acid should 
be expected to compare with the type of response found in higher plants 
only if the fungus material is placed in a comparable physiological 
condition and data of the same type are recorded. This does not appear 
to have been appreciated by those investigators who have attempted to 
obtain growth response in fungi. Their experiments and those recorded 
here do not distinguish betxveen growth as a response to nutrition and 
growth as a hormone response. Thus although the effect of a growth 
substance may be very small when compared to the overall increase in

weight of a growing organism, its effect in increasing the size of a non¬ 
growing part may be considerable* To determine whether indoleacetic 
acid is effective as a growth substance for fungi, experiments must be 
designed to test the effects of this substance under conditions where 
growth is not occurring due to the influence of other factors. It is 
of interest to note in this connection that, in spite of the marked 
effect on enlargement of parts of higher plants, application of indoleacetic 
acid to whole plants has generally not been found to cause an increase 
in total growth. The reverse is in fact usually the case (120). 

EFFECT OF INDOLEACETIC ACID ON THE GROWTH OF VARIOUS 

FUNGI ON A SOLID MEDIUM* 

Fraser (62) reported that in his experiments the effects of 
indoleacetic acid on the growth of Psaliiota hortensis were different on 
solid than on liquid media. It was considered advisable, therefore, to 
test the generality of the observations made above for the growth of 
fungi on solid media containing indoleacetic acid. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS« 

The medium consisted of the basic medium solidified with agar; 15 ml. 
of medium were used per Petri dish and three dishes were used for each 
treatment. Two concentrations of indoleacetic acid were used — 10 x 10 ^ M 
and 100 x 10"" ^ M. Inoculation was carried out in the usual way with 
5 m.m. plugs cut from the edges of colonies growing on the basic medium. 

Several additional fungi were used here, including several unidentified 
isolates obtained from the same soil sample as T. viride and T. asperum .

and these are indicated by the letter S. Other species were from the 
laboratory culture collection except for a second isolate of F* annosus 
(C*297) obtained from the Forest Pathology Laboratory, Calgary* 


RESULTS* 

Growth was measured as the diameter of the fungus colony in 
millimetres, but as in general the results support those obtained for 
liquid cultures they are recorded in summary only. In Table 24 growth 
in the presence of various concentrations of indoleacetic acid is 
given as percentages of that of the control* 

Although the parasitic fungi were not inhibited by such low 
concentrations of indoleacetic acid as they were in the liquid cultures, 
and considerably more variation in response occurred among the 
saprophytes, the same trend was again apparent, indicating that the 
differential effect of indoleacetic acid on the growth of the parasitic 
and saprophytic fungi studied in liquid culture was not merely a factor 
of the experimental conditions usedo 

INFLUENCE OF ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS ON THE INHIBITORY 

EFFECT PRODUCED BY INDOLEACETIC ACID* 

A wide variety of substances have been reported as influencing the 
response of higher plants to indoleacetic acid* An experiment was 
designed to see if additional compounds could affect the response of 
fungi to indoleacetic acid.

MATERIALS AND METHODS. 

The additional materials used were as follows: 

a) Biotin at 100 micrograms per litre; Thimann (200) has suggested 
that this vitamin might act as an anti-auxin. 

b) Adenine at 1 milligram per litre; this substance was reported to 
overcome indoleacetic acid inhibition of bud formation in tissue culture 
(136, 184). 

o) Adenosine at 1 milligram per litre; also reported effective in the 
same way as adenine. 

d) 2,4,6-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid at 5 x IQT^ M; reported by Gentile 
and Klein (77) to act as an antimetabolite of indoleacetic acid in 
Diplodia natalensis . 

e) Maleic hydrazide at 5 x 1CP - 5 M. This substance has been considered 
to act as an anti-auxin by some authors ( 121 ). 

f) Boron has been shown to be essential in the rooting of cuttings 
(120), a process also influenced by indoleacetic acid. Boric acid was 
used here to give a concentration of boron of 1 milligram per litre. 

g) Calcium has been shown by Burstrom ( 36 ) to prevent adaptation of 
roots to indoleacetic acid. Calcium chloride was used at 5 'grams per 
litre. 

h) 2,4-Dichlorophenol was found by Goldacre et al. (82) to be the 
most active of a group of substances activating indoleacetic acid oxidase 
in peas. A concentration of 10*”^ M was chosen. 

These materials were each incorporated into 15$ water agar and 15 ml. 
portions of the resulting mixture were allowed to solidify in Fetri 


dishes

The four fungi, T. viride . T. asperum . 0. graminis and F. annosus, 
were used in this experiment• 

In making up the growth medium indoleacetic acid was used at a 
concentration of 250 x 10"”5 M. The medium alone, consisting of the basic 
medium with agar added, was used as a control* 

For each fungus 2 ml* of a mycelium homogenate, prepared as indicated 
previously, was pipetted into the bottom of a Petri dish* This was 
followed by 15 ml* of the molten growth medium cooled to 40°C* which was 
immediately mixed with the homogenate and allowed to solidify. Plugs 
were then cut from each of the water agar preparations listed above and 
transferred to the surface of the inoculated growth medium* The plugs 
were placed close to the edge of the plate and at points equidistant one 
from another* Three replicates were prepared per fungus* 

It was hoped that the indoleacetic acid would inhibit growth of the 
parasites and, possibly, partially the saprophytes except in the vicinity 
of plugs from which there was diffusion of a substance active in over¬ 
coming the inhibitory effect of the indoleacetic acid. 

The results, however, did not bear out this hypothesis in the way 
that was intended, and will not be discussed at length. Growth of 
0. graminis and F* annosus was inhibited as anticipated; growth of 
T. viride and T* asperurn was not markedly inhibited* None of the added 
substances, under the conditions of this experiment, was able to 
overcome the inhibition of 0o graminis and Fo annosus by indoleacetic 
acid* In the case of T. viride and T. asperurn, however, the growth in 
the vicinity of the 2,4-dichlorophenol was less in comparison to the 
growth in the rest of the plate in the presence of indoleacetic acid than 




















162 


in the control* 

In other words, from this purely visual inspection, it appeared that 
the interaction of indoleacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenol was inhibitive 
for T. viride and T. asperum * It was obvious that a more complete 
analysis would be required before definite conclusions could be drawn.

plugs from agar media, four plates were prepared per treatment. Growth 
was measured in millimetres.

is more strongly inhibited by the combination than by 2 , 4 -dichlorophenol 
and the effect would not appear to be simply additive. Both 0. graminis 
and F. annosus were completely inhibited by the combination but the 
response to the two substances separately was such as to prevent any 
further analysis. 

It would have been of interest to repeat the experiment using low- 
concentrations of indoleacetic acid, not inhibitory to the parasites, but

the possible significance of these observations was not realized until

Indoleacetic acid having been found to have the effects reported 
above on the growth of fungi, study was made of the effects of two other 
substances known to act as growth substance in higher plants* 


MATERIALS AND METHODS* 

Indolebutyric acid and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid were 
incorporated in solid media in the same manner previously described 
for indoleacetic acid, at the concentrations indicated in Table 26. 

RESULTS* 

Growth was measured as the diameter of the fungus colony and growth 
rates were actually determined, but for the sake of brevity only total 
growth is recorded in Table 26, estimated as per cent of the control. 

It appears from the results that 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid at 
the concentrations used does not appreciably inhibit the growth of any 
of the fungi. Indolebutyric acid does have some inhibitory action, 
particularly for the parasites, although the inhibition is not as strong 
as in the case of indoleacetic acid.

INVESTIGATION OF THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF INDOLEACETIC 
ACID ON FUNGI. 


To explain the difference in the response of the parasitic and 
saprophytic fungi to indoleacetic acid three suggestions may be made. 

1. Indoleacetic acid synthesis may occur in the parasitic fungi 
to a greater degree than in the saprophytes, resulting in an increased 
concentration of indoleacetic acid in the medium of the parasites, there 
being no true difference in susceptibility. 

2. The saprophytes may not absorb indoleacetic acid from the medium, 
the parasites may. 

3* Differences may occur in the ability of the two groups to destroy 
indoleacetic acid enzymatically. The saprophytes would be expected to 
have a greater ability to do this than the parasites. 

With regard to 1, the following observations make it unlikely. 

Indoleacetic acid inhibited the growth of 0. graminis and F. annosus 
completely at a concentration usually of 10 x 10~5 m for the former and 
1 x 10"^ M for the latter. The concentration required for complete 
inhibition of To viride and T. asperum was not determined, but was 
certainly in excess of 150 x lO"* 5 M in liquid media, and growth occurred 
at 500 x 10~ 5 M on solid media. Therefore if it is assumed that as high 
a concentration as 50 x 10~ p M indoleacetic acid is required to inhibit 
0. graminis and F« annosus and that T. viride and T. asperum are inhibited 
by as low a concentration as 150 x 10“5 M, which they are not, then if 
the difference in inhibition of the two groups is to be explained by a 
greater production of indoleacetic acid by the parasites, the latter

must be able to develop a concentration of at least 100 x 10~^ M 
indoleacetic acid in their culture medium. That this was not the case 
was demonstrated by the use of Salkowski reagent which indicated that the 
concentration, if any, of indoleacetic acid in the culture media which 
had supported the growth of these fungi was below that necessary to give 
a colour reaction, which is in the neighbourhood of 1 x 10“5 M. It 
should be pointed out that a concentration of 100 x 10~5 m indoleacetic 
acid lies above the usable part of the colour range of the Salkowski test* 
The question of differential absorption was not resolved, but the 
results of the experiments to be described below in support of the third 
hypothesis make it unlikely that this is the main factor operating* 

The third possibility was, therefore, studied experimentally* 

I'ETHOD OF DETERMINATION OF INDOLEACETIC ACID* 

Indoleacetic acid concentrations were determined colorimetrically 
by a modification (84) of the method described by Salkowski (178). The 
reagent consisted of 1 ml* 0*5 M ferric chloride added to 50 ml* 35 % 
perchloric acid. 2 ml. of this reagent were added to 1 ml. of sample 
to be tested and the optical density of the mixture was determined after 
25 minutes at a wavelength of 530 millimicrons, using a Bausch and Lomb 
colorimeter ( t 3pectronic 20* )• 

A standard curve of the optical density for a range of concentrations 
of indoleacetic acid in the basic medium was prepared and is reproduced 
as Figure 10*

BREAKDOWN OF INDOLEACETIC ACID BY MYCELIAL MATS. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS* 

The culture medium from beneath fungus mats in flask was removed 
and the under surface of the mat was washed by adding and removing 
successively three aliquots of sterile distilled water* One series of 
mats was then autoclaved for the purpose of providing a killed control* 
However, the effect on the mycelium was such that it could not be used 
in this way and so was omitted from the experiment* To a second series 
of mats (3 for each fungus) a 25 ml* aliquot of the sterilized basic 
medium containing indoleacetic acid at a concentration of 25 x 10“^ M was 
added* To a third series of mats the basic medium without indoleacetic 
acid was added* 1 ml* aliquots of medium were removed at intervals and 
the concentrations of indoleacetic acid determined as described. The 
mats were then dried and weighed* 

RESULTS* 

The results are given in Table 27, where the breakdown of indoleacetic 
acid has been determined from the standard curve* It can be seen that 
breakdown of indoleacetic acid occurred to a greater extent with the mats 
of F* annosus and 0. graminis than with T. viride or T* asperum * This 
was somewhat surprising as it had been anticipated that activity, if any, 
would be found among the saprophytes, explaining their greater resistance 


to indoleacetic acid,

BREAKDOWN OF INDOLEACETIC ACID BY MYCELIAL HOMOGENATES* 

It was of particular interest to determine whether indoleacetic acid 
breakdown could be brought about by homogenates of the type used for 
inoculation purposes in experiments where inhibition of 0* graminis and 
F* annosus had been demonstrated* Satisfactory demonstration of activity 
under the conditions used was obtained only for F* annosus but this 
confirmed the previous observations for mats, that parasitic fungi have 
the ability to break down indoleacetic acid* 

MATERIALS AND METHODS* 

The homogenate was prepared as already indicated, and the dry weight 
of a sample determined* 

The reaction mixtures and controls were; 

1* Basic medium with indoleacetic acid 20 x 10“' M 40 ml*, 
homogenate 10 ml.

2. Basic medium with indoleacetic acid 20 x 10“5 m 40 ml*,

10 ml. 

4* Basic medium with indoleacetic acid 20 x 10“5 m 40 ml., 
distilled water 10 ml* 

The experiment was carried out in 200 ml. flasks in triplicate. The 
flasks were shaken at room temperature. 

At 45 minute intervals 5 ml. samples of the mixtures were removed 
and placed in test tubes in a water bath at 100°C for 10 minutes. The 
samples were then centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m. for 15 minutes and the 
concentration of indoleacetic acid in the supernatant determined 
colorimetricallyo 

RESULTS. 

The mean values obtained for the destruction of indoleacetic acid 
by the homogenate are given in Table 28. 

These values were converted to the amount of breakdown per milligram 
dry homogenate and are recorded in Table 29 and Figure 11. 

It can be seen from Table 28 that the homogenate of F. annosus was 
highly active in destroying indoleacetic acid and as might be expected 
higher activity was found per milligram than in the case of the mats 
(Table 29)* No further studies on the enzymes involved or on the 
presence of similar enzymes in homogenates of the other fungi were carried 
out. The observations made here are considered sufficient to indicate 
that breakdown of indoleacetic acid occurred when a homogenate of

F. annosus was added to the basic medium containing indoleacetic acid. 

It should be emphasized that the conditions used were comparable to those 
used in the inoculation of flasks where inhibition of growth by indoleacetic 
acid was recorded.

The observations reported above suggest that if differences occur 
in the ability of the two saprophytes and the two parasites to absorb 
indoleacetic acid from the medium this is not the major cause of the 
differences in their tolerance to indoleacetic acid. The main cause of 
this difference would appear to lie in the ability of the parasites to

cause some breakdown of the indoleacetic acid molecule such that it can 
no longer be detected by the colour reaction used# If this is the case, 
and if the saprophytes differ in that they do not break down the 
indoleacetic acid molecule, then it might be expected that the products 
resulting from the activity of 0# graminis and F. annosus would inhibit 
growth of T. viride and T. asperum where indoleacetic acid would not# 

To test this hypothesis the following experiments were performed# 

MATERIALS AND METHODS# (a) 

Homogenates of all four fungi were prepared. To each of a series 
of flasks containing 20 ml# of the basic medium with various concentrations 
of indoleacetic acid 2 ml# of a homogenate of either T. viride or T# asperum 
was added. The flasks were then divided into three groups; to the 
flasks of one group 2 ml. of 0. graminis homogenate was added, to those 
of the second group 2 ml# of F. annosus homogenate was added, and the 
third was left as a control. The layout of the various treatments was 
as follows:

The flasks were then incubated at room temperature for seven days, 
after which observations were made and the dry weight of mycelium produced 
in certain treatments recorded* 

RESULTS* 

From a visual inspection no differences were detectable between the 
various treatments in the case of T. viride, but considerable differences 
were apparent in the case of T* asperum * The mycelium from flasks in 
which these differences occurred, together with that from the controls 
was harvested and the dry weight of the mycelium determined. These 
results are given in Table 30. 

It can be seen that the homogenates were without effect on the growth 
of T. asperum in the control, and indoleacetic acid had a comparatively 
small effect on the growth of T* asperum in the absence of an added 
homogenate. The combination of F. annosus homogenate and indoleacetic 
acid at 50 and 100 x 10 ^ M produced a very marked reduction in growth 
and likewise the 0. graminis homogenate produced a considerable decrease 
in the amount of growth at the higher concentrations* This is evidence 
in support of the hypothesis that the breakdown products of indoleacetic 
acid produced by 0. graminis and F. annosus are inhibitory to growth. 

A check on the concentration of indoleacetic acid remaining in the medium 
after 7 days growth also supported this conclusion, inhibition of growth 
being correlated with greatest indoleacetic acid breakdown^ the values 
are given in Table 31*

MATERIALS AND METHODS, (b) 

In general the methods were the same as in the previous experiment. 
However, only one concentration of indoleacetic acid was used, and in 
addition to the crude homogenates of 0 o graminis and F. annosus , cell 
free extracts and boiled controls were also used. The various treatments 
are indicated in Table 32. The cell free extract was obtained as the 
supernatant after centrifuging the crude homogenate for 30 minutes at 
5000 r.p.m. The homogenates and supernatants were boiled by autoclaving 
under standard conditions. Three flasks were used per treatment. The 
mycelium was harvested after 7 days growth. 

RESULTS. 

For T. viride there were again insufficient differences between the 
treatments for significance. In the case of T. asperum, F. annosus

homogenate caused a significant decrease in growth in 50 x 10“^ M 
indoleacetic acid compared with the control. The differences produced 
by the homogenate of 0. graminis and the supernatant of F. annosus were 
smaller but were significant at the 5% level of probability. The results 
are recorded in Table 32. 

Thus it may be concluded that 0. graminis and F. annosus are able to 
break down indoleacetic acid, while T. viride and T. asperum probably do 
so to a lesser degree. The products of this breakdown are toxic at 
least to T. asperum 0 


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS. 


The results reported above indicate that satisfactory growth of 
T. viride and T. asperum. occurred at concentrations of indoleacetic acid 
much above those at which growth of 0. graminis and F® annosus is stopped. 
Whether this is a characteristic difference between parasitic and 
saprophytic fungi in general can only be determined by repeated tests 
with other representative strains and species. Considerable differences 
commonly occur between strains of the same species with regard to many 
physiological characteristics. As all degrees of parasitism and 
*saprophytism* are known to exist among fungi, clear-cut distinctions 
are not to be expected. That a distinction was found between two 
parasites and two saprophytes is in itself of interest. 

Enzyme preparations from higher plants which destroy indoleacetic 
acid have recently been the subject of considerable study (ill, 131, 193, 
223, 224). These authors usually refer to the enzyme as indoleacetic 





















181 


acid oxidase, activity usually being followed manometrically by oxygen 
uptake# No direct evidence was obtained in the results reported here 
that oxidation of indoleacetic acid occurred, but the effect of 2,4-dichloro- 
phenol in promoting its inhibitory activity is suggestive, for the latter 
substance has been shown to be an activator of indoleacetic acid oxidase 
in peas (82)# 

Apart from the report of Sequeira and Steeves (181) attributing leaf 
drop caused by Omphalia flavida to auxin inactivation, indoleacetic acid 
oxidase activity does not appear to have been studied in fungi. It is 
reasonable to expect that the higher plant will provide an environment 
in which indoleacetic acid will occur more consistently than in the soil. 
Relatively greater ability on the part of parasites to metabolize this 
substance, therefore, would not be surprising. That self-inhibition is 
the result of this ability is, however, paradoxical. 

Although it is difficult to correlate concentrations of indoleacetic 
acid reported to be present in plant tissue with concentrations in liquid 
media, it is of interest that, calculated on a fresh weight basis, 
concentrations of indoleacetic acid of up to 100 milligrams per litre have 
been reported for plant tissues (120) and these concentrations would be 
inhibitory to 0. graminis and F. annosus. Such concentrations are, 
however, probably exceptional and parasitic fungi in nature are unlikely 
to meet with concentrations that are inhibitory to them. It must be 
assumed that the breakdown of lower concentrations of indoleacetic acid 
does not result in the accumulation of products in sufficient amount to 
inhibit growth. The nature of the breakdown products from the action 
of indoleacetic acid oxidase preparations from higher plants has not yet

been determined, although Stutz (193) has demonstrated chromatographically 
that several substances are produced. 

If high concentrations of indoleacetic acid are not commonly met with 
by parasitic fungi, their inhibition by these concentrations may have no 
significance for the parasitic mode of life. The ability to breakdown 
lower concentrations of indoleacetic acid, where inhibition does not 
develop, may be of some significance. 

Although no satisfactory explanation of the effects of indoleacetic 
acid in higher plants have been forthcoming, of late attention has been 
given to the effect of indoleacetic acid on the pectin constituents of 
the cell wall (31, 80, 81, 152). These reports do not appear to be in 
agreement as to what such effects are, but it is of interest to note that 
Ordin et al. (152) have found indoleacetic acid to promote methyl 
esterification of the pectin constituents in the cell wall. Jansen and 
MacDonnell (108) demonstrated that demethylation of pectin was an essential 
preliminary for optimal activity of polygalacturonase in pectin breakdown. 
If the breakdown of pectin is important in the invasion of cells by 
parasitic fungi, as has been suggested by the work of Brown (e.g. 30), 
then in living host cells inactivation of indoleacetic acid may be first 
necessary for satisfactory activity of the fungus enzymes involved in 
pectin degradation. Of interest in this connection is a recent study 
made by Shaw and Hawkins (182) of the levels of indoleacetic acid and 
indoleacetic acid oxidase activity in uninfected cereal leaves and in 
cereal leaves infected with rust or mildew. They found that the level 
of indoleacetic acid first declined and then increased in infected leaves, 
while indoleacetic acid oxidase activity showed a very marked increase 



183 


immediately following infection, followed by a decline which was rapid 
in susceptible hosts and slower in resistant hosts* It would certainly 
be of interest to determine if the oxidase activity was of host or 
parasite origin* If the oxidase activity proves to be of fungal origin 
then some support for the results reported here may be found* In apparent 
contradiction of these findings Pilet (159) concludes from studies of 
Uromyces pisi on Euphorbia cyparissias that an inhibitor of indoleacetic 
acid oxidase is produced by the fungus* 

It is certainly too early to attempt to formulate any theory 
incorporating the results of the investigations reported here* The 
contradictory nature of results obtained from studies of indoleacetic 
acid in higher plants alone would suggest that any explanation of these 
findings is likely to be complex*

CONCLUSIONS. 


The investigations reported here were initiated for the purpose of 
determining differences in the physiology of two parasitic and two 
saprophytic fungi. Three physiological aspects have been studied and 
the main conclusions to be drawn are as follows. 

In their response to various antibiotics the saprophytes appeared 
generally more tolerant than the parasites. This observation, accords 
well with the relatively greater ability of the saprophytes to live 
freely in the soil. As a generalization it should, however, be qualified® 
In some cases the parasites showed proportionately less inhibition than 
T* viride , (e.g. by griseofulvin), and frequently demonstrated considerable 
adaptation. This adaptation is of interest but its nature is not 
understood. It is not known, for example, whether enzymic breakdown of 
the antibiotic was involved with the synthesis of an adaptive enzyme as 
a preliminary. But these qualifications do indicate that possibly 
under certain conditions the presence of antibiotics might not in itself 
be sufficient to limit saprophytic growth by these fungi. 

It was also noted that the response of T. viride and T. asperum to 
antibiotics was not the same. T. viride tended to be inhibited to a 
greater extent than T. asperum , but when inhibited, frequently showed 
adaptation. T. asperum , on the other hand, was little influenced by 
the antibiotic concentrations used, but where it was inhibited gave 
little indication of adaptation. 


Considerable differences were found between the four fungi with 















185 


regard to their nutritional requirements. 

The growth rates of the two parasites were similar and lay in between 
those of the saprophytes. T. viride had a very rapid rate of spread on 
solid media, which together with its ready ability to sporulate, must 
confer a considerable advantage in colonizing fresh and possibly ephemeral 
substrates in the soil. T. asperuin . on the other hand, grew much more 
slowly than either of the parasites, but its growth was dense and produced 
a high mycelial weight on liquid cultures - both factors which indicate 
efficient use of food materials. Possibly the disadvantage which T. asperum 
has with regard to growth rate is somewhat compensated for by its greater 
tolerance to antibiotics. It should be noted, too, that T. asperum also 
produced an abundance of spores. 

The study of the influence of temperature and pH on growth of the 
fungi also revealed interesting differences. Thus the temperature and 
pH ranges of F. annosus were much more limited than those of the other 
fungi, and this is probably of no disadvantage to a fungus which resides 
for long periods in the woody tissues of tree roots and trunks where the 
environmental conditions remain relatively constant for long periods. 

The greater pH and temperature range of 0. graminis is, on the other hand, 
probably essential for its satisfactory development on and in the somewhat 
shorter lived roots of cereals. The observation that at lower 
temperatures it may grow better than T. viride . a potential soil 
antagonist, may be important in disease development in the field (Ludwig 
and Henry (129)). The tolerance of T. viride and T. asperum to reasonably 
wide temperature and pH ranges suggests that these fungi would show 
considerable adaptation to soil conditions varying in these characteristics.

Both of the parasitic fungi showed requirements for vitamins and 
preferences for complex nitrogen sources* Although these may not be 
exclusively characteristics of parasites, it is certainly true that such 
requirements are more likely to be met in the host plant than in the soil* 
The complementary observations that the saprophytes grew satisfactorily 
on simple synthetic media without supplements of this kind suggests that 
this is a difference of considerable importance* 

Under the conditions of adequate vitamin and nitrogen nutrition the 
parasites and the saprophytes made good growth on many of the carbohydrates 
studied* Many individual differences were apparent and it can be seen 
that together with certain combinations of some of the other factors 
studied, the availability of different carbohydrates in an environment 
could be a controlling influence in selection. Sucji differences in 
utilization could form the basis of some very interesting metabolic 
studies* Marked differences between the parasites and saprophytes as 
groups were not too evident, although the clear-cut distinction drawn by 
the ability of the parasites to make good growth on insoluble cellulose 
was certainly of interest. The importance of cellulose as a cell wall 
constituent in higher plants requires no emphasis, and its potential 
importance as a substrate for invading parasitic fungi is obvious* 

Striking differences were found in the response of the fungi studied 
to indoleacetic acid. That the level at which inhibition occurred was 
similar in 0. graminis and F. annosus and much lower than that for the 
saprophytes is felt to be of considerable interest. This inhibition 
was shown to be correlated with a relatively greater ability on the part 
of the parasites, and particularly F* annosus , to carry out an enzymic

breakdown of indoleacetic acid. The products of this enzyme reaction 
were found to be inhibitive at least to T. asperum . suggesting that the 
relative tolerance of the saprophytes to indoleacetic acid inhibition 
probably resides in their inability to convert this substance to some 
inhibitory breakdown product. A possible significance of these findings 
for the parasitic ability of 0. graminis and F. annosus has already been 
discussed, but it should be emphasized here that they were probably the 
clearest distinctions between the two pairs of fungi revealed in these 
inve stigation s• 

Further elaboration of the studies of indoleacetic acid breakdown 
would be of considerable value, especially as this activity does not 
appear to have been investigated in fungi. 

A completely satisfactory conclusion to these studies would be 
reached only when sufficient information was obtained to explain why one 
fungus must be a saprophyte and another a parasite. This ideal has 
most certainly not been attained here, but the findings do give some 
indication of the suitability of each fungus for the habitat in which 
it is found. Thus it is easy to appreciate why T. viride appears to 
be such an important soil saprophyte. Tolerance to antibiotics (and 
the ability to produce at least two such substances (23)); high growth 
rate; production of spores in abundance; wide pH range; ability to 
grow on simple nitrogenous compounds without an exogenous supply of 
vitamins; and ability to utilize a variety of carbohydrates; these are 
all characteristics which would be expected to make for saprophytic 
success. Most of these characteristics were exhibited also by T« asperum . 
Similarly, the results of these investigations indicate why 0. graminis 
















188 


and F. annosus are not likely to be successful soil inhabitants and are 
suggestive as to why the host plant is a more favourable habitat for these 
fungi. 

The value of further study can hardly be overstated, for it can only 
be from a thorough understanding of the environmental requirements of 
fungi that a knowledge of parasitism, and of saprophytism too, can be 
gained, and only then can a thoroughly intelligent approach to the 
control of disease be made.

SUMMARY. 


Studies were undertaken to compare certain aspects of the physiology 
of representative saprophytic and parasitic soil inhabiting fungi* Four 
fungi were studied in particular, two saprophytes, Trichoderma viride Pers. 
ex Fries, and Trichocladium asperum Harz, and two parasites, Ophiobolus 
graminis Sacc* and Fomes annosus Fries* 

Comparisons were made with regard to tolerance to antibiotics, 
nutritional behaviour, and response to plant growth substances* 

The effects of five antifungal antibiotics, namely, acti-dione, 
gliotoxin, griseofulvin, patulin and trichothecin, were studied* 

1* Acti-dione inhibited all four fungi to some extent* T* asperum was 
least affected; T. viride was initially strongly inhibited by concentrations 
of 10 p*p.m* and higher, but showed good adaptation. Both 0. graminis 
and F. annosus were very strongly inhibited by acti-dione. The former 
did not grow at 5 p.p.m. and the latter failed to grow above 10 p*p*m. 

2* Gliotoxin inhibited growth of F. annosus more strongly than that of 
the other fungi, which were fairly similar in their response to this 
antibiotic. 

3* T* viride appeared proportionately more susceptible to griseofulvin 
inhibition than any of the other three fungi. 0. graminis was fairly 
tolerant to this antibiotic and showed good adaptation. F. annosus was 
more tolerant than T* viride at the lower concentrations. 

4. Patulin, even at 100 p.p.m., reduced growth of T. asperum only slightly. 

Greater inhibition occurred with T. viride, while 0. graminis and F. annosus 














































190 


were strongly inhibited. The last two fungi, however, showed good 
adaptation at the lower concentrations* 

5* Trichothecin was initially quite inhibitory to T. viride . but good 
recovery occurred* The responses of T. asperum and 0. graminis were 
rather similar but F. annosus was strongly inhibited by this antibiotic 
even at 1 p.p.m* 

It was concluded from the study of antibotics that the saprophytes 
were generally more tolerant than the parasites* 

The various aspects of the nutrition of the four fungi studied 
included growth rates, temperature and pH responses, requirements for 
vitamins and nitrogenous compounds, and the utilization of various 
carbohydrates© 

6. T. viride was observed to have a very high growth rate while that of 
T. asperum was comparatively slow* The growth rates of 0* graminis and 
F. annosus were similar and lay between those of the two saprophytes* 

7. Growth of the four fungi was observed at 10°C., 15°C©, 20°C., 25°C., 

30°C* and 35°C* Only T* viride grew at 35°C. but here growth was soon 
arrested. The optimum for T. viride was 25-30°C.; it grew poorly at 
15°C* and 10°C. T. asperum grew very slightly at 30°C.; the optimum was 
20~25°C* and it grew comparatively well at 10°C. 0. graminis made a 

little growth at 30°C*; the optimum was 20-25°C. and comparatively good 
growth occurred at 10°C* The optimum temperature for F. annosus was 
25°C*; only a trace of growth occurred at 15°C* and 30°C. was the upper 
temperature limit. 

8. The two saprophytes appeared rather more tolerant of low pH than the 
parasites. 0* graminis , T. viride and T. asperum made good growth at 

























c * 












m 















191 


the higher pH values used, but growth of F. annosus was much reduced at 
pH 7*0. The optimum for F. annosus appeared to be pH 5*0* 

9« T* viride and T. asperum grew as well with potassium nitrate as sole 
nitrogen source as with other forms of nitrogen 0 This was not true of 
0* graminis and F. annosus which grew best on organic nitrogen. 

10. Neither T. viride nor T. asperum required an exogenous supply of 
vitamins. F. annosus required thiamine and 0. graminis required thiamine 
and biotin for growth on a synthetic medium containing either inorganic or 
organic nitrogen. 

11. The four fungi showed considerable differences in their ability to 
utilize representative pentose and hexose monosaccharides, disaccharides 
and polysaccharides. Compared with D-glucose the following were found 
to be poor carbon sources: for T. viride , D-galactose, L-arabinose, 
D-arabinose, maltose, sucrose, inulin, pectin and cellulose; for 

T f asperum , D-galactose, L-arabinose, D-arabinose, D-ribose, lactose, 
melibiose, pectin and cellulose; for 0. graminis , D-galactose, D-arabinose, 
D-ribose, melibiose, inulin and pectin; for F. annosus , D-galactose, 
L-arabinose, D-arabinose, D-ribose, cellobiose and inulin. 

The results of the nutritional studies indicated that the requirements 
of T. viride and T. asperum would probably be satisfied in the soil, while 
those of 0. graminis and F. -annosus would be fulfilled optimally in their 
hosts. 

The effects of indoleacetic acid, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 
indolebutyric acid, on the growth of the four fungi used, were studied. 

12. Indoleacetic acid inhibited 0„ graminis and F. annosus at low 
concentrations. T. viride and T. asperum were not appreciably inhibited 

to 100 x 10-5 m. No consistent stimulation of growth 


at concentrations up

was recorded. 

13. Additional fungi were also included in these studies and the response, 
to indoleacetic acid, of those which were saprophytes was generally 
similar to that of T. viride and T. asperunu 

14* The inhibition by indoleacetic acid was enhanced by 2,4-dichloro- 
phenol at 10“^ M. 

15* 2,4 -Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid had no appreciable effect on the 

growth of the fungi on solid media at concentrations up to 250 x 10~5 M. 
Indolebutyric acid inhibited the growth of 0. graminis and F. annosus at 
100 and 250 x 10~5 M to a greater extent than that of T. viride or 
To asperum . 

16. F. annosus was shown to be highly active in breaking down indoleacetic 
acid. 

17. The breakdown products produced by homogenates of 0. graminis and 
F. annosus were shown to be toxic to T. asperum . 

From the studies with indoleacetic acid it was concluded that the 
response of 0. graminis and F. annosus was fundamentally different from 
that of T. viride and T. asperum . It was considered that this difference 
might have some significance for the parasitic mode of life of the first 
two fungi.
