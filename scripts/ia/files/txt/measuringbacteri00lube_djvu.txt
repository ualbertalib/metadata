MEASURING BACTERIAL LIPASE 


INTRODUCTION 

GENERAL 


Of the types of spoilage occurring In dairy products one, 
resulting from enzyme action* is today receiving considerable 
attention. This type of spoilage, more commonly known as 
"rancidity’ 1 , has been observed in milk, cream, butter, raw 
milk Cheddar cheese, whole and skim milk powder and sweetened 
condensed milk. Rancid spoilage of cream during the winter 
months has been the cause of serious losses to the dairy 
industry in Alberta. 

Investigations Initiated at the University of Alberta In 
1943 by the Departments of Animal Science and Dairying have 
attempted to determine the causes of rancidity in milk and 
the various factors affecting rancidity, so that ultimately 
measures could be recommended for the control and prevention 
of this defect(Dunkley et. al. 1946). 

Prom the above investigations and those conducted else¬ 
where various facts are now available. It has been found, 
for Instance, that rancidity in milk is brought about by 
enzymes which hydrolyze butterfat releasing fatty acids which 
impart to the milk objectionable odors and flavors. In addition 
to factors now known to inhibit and activate this hydrolysis 
of the butterfat. Gastell (1942), it Is also known that milk 
may become rancid with no apparent correlation between the 
rancidity and the numbers of bacteria present(Lubert, 1946).

This substantiates the work of those such as Herrington and 
Krukovsky (1939) who claim that rancidity in milk may be caused 
by a lipase of animal origin, i.e., secreted with the milk. 

During the 1930 s s it was reported that butter manufactured 
from raw cream would become rancid if the cream contained suffi¬ 
cient numbers of certain microorganisms (Hammer and Collins, 

1934). The most important .organisms associated with such 
spoilage have been Pseudomonas fragi . Pseudomonas flucrescens 
and Achromobacter lipolyticum , all of which are lipolytic. 

These organisms have been isolated from air, water and improperly 
sterilized dairy plant equipment such as churns and pipelines. 

When pasteurization of cream for buttermaking became 
popular rancidity caused by bacteria was much less widespread. 
.Butter exhibiting the rancid defect when made from pasteurized 
cream has been so spoiled either by organisms surviving improper 
pasteurization or organisms gaining entrance to the butter 
during churning and subsequent handling of the butter. This 
holds true for butter made from cream not already exhibiting 
marked rancidity. 

As a result of improved methods of production, neutraliza¬ 
tion, pasteurization and sanitation, bacterially-induced ran¬ 
cidity, especially in butter, has been reduced very considerably. 

The incidence of hydrolytic rancidity in other dairy pro¬ 
ducts follows a similar trend. However the mechanism of ran¬ 
cidity brought about by bacteria, with particular regard to 
Cheddar cheese, is still not clearly understood. 

In order to study rancidity by bacterial agents it is

necessary to be able to measure the lipolytic activity of a 
bacterial culture♦ This, of course, arises from the fact that 
the ability of an organism to break down fat governs its 
effectiveness in inducing rancid spoilage* 

THE ACTION OF BACTERIA ON FAT 

According to Frazier (1935) f, The chief action of bacteria 
on fats is a hydrolytic cleavage by means of lipase, in which 
the fats are split into glycerine and fatty acids. Glycerine 
is readily acted on by a number of bacteria and is usually 
the first of the split products to be attacked. The course 
of the fermentation of glycerine will depend upon the organisms 
present and the general conditions but it is generally changed 
into lactic acid, volatile acids and aldehydes* The fatty 
acids which result from the hydrolysis of the fats or the 
fermentation of the glycerine are usually not attacked until 
the more available glycerine is destroyed. Then, however, 
these acids may be further split by some types of bacteria 
into simpler acids or to carbon-dioxide and water* The first 
part, then, of the action of bacteria on fat is usually hydrol¬ 
ysis and this is followed by oxidation processes. 11 

Observations by Gas tell and Garrard (1941 b) appear to 
bear out the foregoing. 


HISTORICAL 

Various methods for the detection of lipolytic micro¬ 
organisms and studying lipolytic activity have been proposed 
during the past half century. In one of the earliest, the

natural fat technique, lipolysi3 is detected by a change in 
the appearance of small globules of fat distributed through¬ 
out a solid medium. Collins and Hammer (1934 a) have reported 
that Sommaruga, a pioneer in this field, in 1894 studied the 
lipolytic ability of microorganisms by growing them on solid 
media in which was dispersed olive-oil or other fat. The 
disappearance of the fat globules surrounding the growth of 
the bacteria was accepted as evidence of hydrolysis. 

Eijkraan (1901) poured melted agar over a thin layer of 
tallow in the bottom of a petri dish and found that the fat 
under lipolytic colonies became changed in color and opacity. 

Anderson (1934) adapted the natural fat technique for use 
with a simple triglyceride. Adding neutral tributyrin to 
nutrient agar he used this turbid medium for the detection 
of lipolytic microorganisms. Conspicuous clear zones developed 
around lipolytic colonies. 

Long and Hammer (1937) also modified the natural fat 
technique and obtained a more uniform fat distribution by 
adding natural fat in the form of an emulsion (fat-agar) to 
beef infusion agar. They observed that around actively 
lipolytic colonies the fat globules became more opaque. With 
the higher melting point fats which are opaque at room tempera¬ 
ture they found it advantageous to warm the plates at 45°C 
prior to examination. 

Limitations of the natural fat technique are that it 
often does not detect weakly lipolytic colonies and does not 
lend itself to quantitative interpretation.

Interest was also shown at the turn of the century in 
compounds which would impart to fat a particular color and to 
fatty acids a different color. This has been the basis of 
another method for the detection of lipase-producing micro¬ 
organisms. This method gained popularity when Smith (1908) 
observed that an aqueous solution of nile blue sulphate, 
when shaken with olein, stained the fat red but, when shaken 
with oleic acid, the fatty acid became blue or purple. 

Turner (1929) added nile blue sulphate to an agar medium. 

To this, before solidification, he added a fat emulsion. 

A change in color of fat globules surrounding colonies from 
red to blue was taken as evidence of lipolysis. He observed 
that the dye was inhibitory to certain microorganisms. 

Collins and Hammer (1934 a) (1934 b) using Hussong’s (1932) 
modification of Turner’s technique studied not only the action 
of certain bacteria on some simple triglycerides and natural 
fats, but also the types of lipolysis brought about by bacteria. 

Stark and Scheib (1936) modified the nile blue sulphate 
technique by staining the fat and washing it free of excess 
dye before adding it to the agar. The inhibitory effect of 
the dye was therefore reduced. 

Rosenfeld (1946) found that anaerobic lipolytic colonies 
on lipid agar containing neutral red base, were surrounded 
by a red areola while colonies themselves were extremely dark 
red. Non-lipolytic bacteria did not produce the color change 
from amber to red.

Other investigators such as Demeter (1938), Castell and 
Bryant (1939), Castell and Garrard (1941 b), Starr (1941), 

Knaysi (1941) and Richards (1945) have reported on the use 
of indicators other than nile blue sulphate for the detection 
of lipolytic microorganisms. 

Castell and Bryant and Castell and Garrard (1941 a) 
substantiate the work of Jensen and Grettie (1937) by presenting 
evidence, resulting from the use of methylene blue and 
p-aminodimethyl aniline monohydrochloride, that bacteria may 
oxidize the fat in a medium. They concluded that the inter¬ 
pretation of color changes using nile blue sulphate was not 
a simple one. The presence of fat colored blue did not 
necessarily indicate hydrolysis alone. 

A method for detecting microbial lipase was originated 
by Carnot and Mauban (1918) and later worked with by Berry 
(1933). Streaked agar plates, following incubation, were 
flooded with a saturated aqueous solution of copper sulphate. 
Bluish-green streaks of insoluble copper soap were accepted 
as evidence of lipolytic activity. 

While the above methods are valuable for detecting lipo¬ 
lytic microorganisms they are of limited value for the quanti¬ 
tative determination of lipolysis. 

Among the first to use a quantitative method for esti¬ 
mating bacterial lipase were Wells and Corper (1912). They 
introduced a definite amount of killed bacteria into various 
esters and neutralized the resulting emulsion with 0.1 N NaOH

to the end point of pheno]plithalein. Further neutralizations 
were carried out at intervals during 14 days incubation. The 
final titration was made on an ether extract using alcoholic 
NaOH. Controls were heated prior to incubation and titration 
differences were used as measures of lipolysis. 

Turner (1929) mentioned that lipase might be demonstrated 
in 24 hour autolyzed yeast peptone water cultures by titration 
with sodium alcoholate, with thymol as an antiseptic and tri- 
butyrin as the substrate. 

The action of lipase was quantitatively measured by 
Truss ell and Weed (1937) in cultures grown in beef infusion 
broth containing a fat emulsion. The cultures were titrated 
with 0.1 N NaOH, brom thymol blue being the indicator. 

Castell and Garrard (1941 a) grew pure cultures of bacteria 
in a 50$ mixture of triolein and 1$ peptone solution for 17 
days. Samples were withdrawn and titrated with 0.1 N NaOH 
in a neutral solution of equal parts of ether and alcohol, 
with phenhfohthalein as the indicator. Distinct lipolytic 
action was concluded to be evident when the acidity ($ oleic 
acid) was above 0.11. 

Peters and Nelson (1947) (1948) added yeast in a buffered 
glucose broth to an emulsion of 5$ butterfat in 0.25$ agar 
(containing 1:1500 formaldehyde) and incubated the mixture 
for 48 hours. To an aliquot of the emulsion 25 ml of 95$ 
neutral ethyl alcohol and 25 ml of diethyl ether were added, 
and the mixture titrated with 0.05 N EOH in methyl alcohol, 
using phenolphthalein as indicator. Titration difference

between the culture and a similar amount of the culture, 
boiled to inactivate the enzyme, was considered to indicate 
lipase activity. 

In addition to the above procedures, Peterson, Johnson 
and Price (1943) have reported a method for the determination 
of milk lipase which is simple enough to be readily adapted 
to routine determinations. Skim milk was buffered at pH 8.5 
using sodium diethyl barbiturate, tributyrin was added as a 
substrate, and after shaking, the reaction mixture was in- 
cubated at 40°C. Hydrolysis of the tributyrin was measured 
by removing aliquot portions of the reaction mixture at the 
beginning and at the end of the incubation period (15-120 mins.) 
and titrating them in the presence of alcohol and ether to 
the end point of thymolphthalein. This technique, however, 
involves the titration of a solution which contains proteins 
and, being buffered at pH 8.5, it has appreciable buffer 
capacity at the titration end point (approximately pH 10.2) 
and so does not give a sharp color change. 

The necessity for titrating the liberated butyric acid 
in the presence of proteins and barbiturate buffer was eliminated 
in Dunkl©y 1 s modification by acidifying the reaction mixture 
with phosphoric acid, extracting it with ether and titrating 
an aliquot of the ether extract. 

PURPOSE 

The following investigations were designed to show:

by Smith (1949) could be applied to the determination of

METHOD 


Reagents 

Borate Buffer - containing 6.25 g boric acid and 42 ml 
of N NaOH per liter* 

Tributyrin - obtained from Eastman Kodak Company, 
Rochester, N.Y. 

M H PO 
3 4 

Ethyl Ether 

Titration Mixture - containing 1 liter of 95% ethyl 

alcohol, 1 liter distilled water and 
50 ml of 0.1% alcoholic Cresol Red. 

A few drops of 0.05 N NaOH are added 
to give the mixture a pH of 7.4. 

Standard 0.02 N NaOH 
Procedure 

The organism to be tested is inoculated by means of a 
loop from an actively growing 24 hour agar slant culture into 
10 ml of sterile skim milk and incubated at its optimum 

a 

growth temperature for 24 to 48 hours. (In preliminary work 
with this procedure larger amounts of medium were inoculated 
with smaller amounts of inoculum resulting in longer incubation 
times and lower titers.) Skim milk, unless otherwise noted, 
is skim milk which has been prepared from Bacto-Skim Milk 
(dehydrated). 

Two ml of the resulting culture are pipetted into a test 
tube containing 5 ml of 0.1 M borate buffer and adjusted, if 
necessary, to'pH 8.5 using M NaOH or M H 3 PO 4 . The buffered 
culture is placed in a water bath at 37°C and allowed to 
reach this temperature within 3 mins., 0.2 ml of tributyrin 
are added, a rubber stopper inserted in the tube and the

mixture shaken vigorously for 5 secs, to emulsify the tributyrin. 
The reaction mixture is returned to the water bath and is not 
agitated during the reaction period. At the end of the re¬ 
action period (30 mins, after the addition of tributyrin) 5 
ml of M H^PO^ are added (to stop lipolysis and permit the 
subsequent extraction of the liberated butyric acid) and the 
whole mixed by inverting twice® The mixture is transferred 
to another water bath at approximately 20°C. After allowing 
a few minutes for the mixture to reach this temperature 10 
ml of ether are added and the tube is shaken vigorously for 
5 secs. The ether usually separates rapidly after this 
extraction, but almost 5 mins, should be allowed to permit 
small water droplets to settle out of the ether layer. The 
rubber stopper is loosened and after 3 mins, a 5 ml aliquot 
of the clear ether layer is transferred by means of a pipette 
to a 50 ml erlenmeyer or beaker containing 10 ml of titration 
mixture and titrated with 0.02 N NaOH to a faint orange color. 

A blank or control determination is carried out in a 
similar manner except that the H^PO^ is added immediately 
after the mixture containing tributyrin has been shaken, 
i.e., the reaction period is omitted. 

Hydrolysis of the substrate, referred to in this paper 
as lipolysis, is expressed as the difference between ml of 
0.02 N NaOH required in the titration of the ether extract 
of the blank and the ml of 0.02 N NaOH required in the titration 
of the ether extract of the sample carried through the reaction 
period.

Titer, unless otherwise noted, is the average ml of 0*02 
N NaOH required in duplicate titrations. 

Titration differences (lipolysis) of less than 0.05 ml 
are arbitrarily interpreted as indicating no lipolysis, 0.05 - 
0.1 ml as questionable lipolysis, 0.1 - 1.0 ml as weak lipolysis, 
and over 1.0 ml as strong lipolysis. 


EXPERIMENTAL 

A. FACTORS AFFECTING THE RESULTS 

1. Extraction of Acids 

The method described involves the titration of an ether 
extract of the acidified reaction mixture. All acids soluble 
in ether, if present, would contribute to the acidity of the 
extract. To determine the extent to which some acids soluble 
in ether were extracted by this method, solutions of acetic, 
propionic, butyric and lactic acid were first prepared and 
standardized as follows. 


Acetic acid--—>--”-0.0192 N 

Propionic acid--0.0192 N 

Butyric acid-------0.0197 N 

Lactic acid---0.0152 N. 


Two ml of the acids were added to 7 ml of buffered fresh

skim milk in duplicate test tubes. In addition a 2.17 ml 
mixture of the 4 acids was added to a buffered sample of the 
skim milk. Tributyrin was added and, immediately after shaking, 
3.5 ml of 1.5 M H PO were added. The acidified reaction

mixtures were then extracted with 10 ml of ether and aliquots 
were titrated with 0.0197 N NaOH. 

Table 1 shows the percentage recovery of the various 
acids added to the buffered milk. Butyric acid was the most 
completely recovered, 90%, and lactic acid the least, 12%. 

The 46% recovery of the mixture of acids was in agreement 
with the theoretical 47% calculated from the percentage recovery 
of the individual acids. Duplicates checked within 2%.

2. Source of Acid 

(a) Acid Formation During the Reaction Period 

Sine© the method measured acids soluble in ether, it was 
necessary to know if such acids were formed by buffered cultures 
during the reaction period in the absence of a substrate. 

Cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Escherichia coli 
were prepared as heretofore described. A series of buffered 
samples in duplicate were made up from these cultures and 
uninoculated skim milk and held over the reaction period. 

The buffered samples of SU coll were adjusted to approximately 
pH 8.5 using 5 N NaOH. The series was divided and to one 
half tributyrin was added, the other half being held over the 
reaction period without added tributyrin. The blanks were 
similarly treated.

There was no increase in acidity of the ether extract of 
samples of unincculated skim milk, samples of P_»_ flucrescens , 
and samples of E_. coli during the reaction period when no 
tributyrin was added (Table 2). Tributyrin increased the 
blank titers by 0.03 ml but no breakdown of tributyrin during 
the reaction period was evident in the uninoculated milk 
samples. The lipolytic value for coli of 0.02 ml was not 
significant, being within the range of experimental error. 

Acid formed during the growth of coli was accounted for in 
the blank. The addition of tributyrin to the fluorescens 
sample resulted in a high lipolytic value indicating the 
tributyrin had been partly broken down releasing butyric acid. 

The above results seemed to justify the conclusion that 
an increase in titer at the end of the reaction period occurred 
only in the presence of tributyrin, providing the culture was 
capable of hydrolyzing the tributyrin. 

(b) Cell Increase 

Previously it was found that broth cultures of P. fluorescens 
grew well at 25°C but very slowly at 37°G. It was therefore 
assumed that there would be little increase in the number of 
cells during the reaction period. In support of this plate 
counts were carried out. 

Two ml of a 96 hour skim milk culture of P_. f luorescens 
(100 ml skim milk inoculated with 1 ml of a 48 hour skim milk 
culture and incubated at 25°C) were added to each of 6 sterile

test tubes• After the required amounts of borate buffer and 
tributyrin were added and the tubes shaken, 5 tubes were 
removed from the water bath. Two tubes were acidified, extracted 
and aliquots titrated. Dilutions of 1:100,000 and 1:1,000,000 
were prepared from the third tube and plates were poured with 
T.G.E.M. agar (Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy 
Products, 8th Edition, A.P.H.A. 1941). At the end of the 
reaction period the remaining 3 tubes were similarly treated. 

All plates were incubated at 25°C for 72 hours and counted. 

During the reaction period in which lipolysis took place 
to the extent of 0.33 ml no significant change in the number 
of cells was apparent (Table 3).

If a number of cultures of different organisms had been 
so examined greater significance might be accorded to the 
above study in regard to the application of the method to a 
variety of organisms. Despite this limitation it was felt 
tha.t, since there was no increase in the number of cells of 
P. fluorescens during the reaction period, change in the 
number of cells during the reaction period was eliminated as 
a possible source of ether-soluble acids. 

(c) Protein as Acid Source 

During the reaction period of the proposed method for 
the determination of lipolysis in skim milk cultures, the 
total acidity, in addition to the fatty acid produced, may be 
contributed to by amino acids resulting from increased protein 
breakdown. In studying this aspect of the problem changes in 
the amino N content during the reaction period were determined 
at the same time as the lipolysis was being measured. The 
amino N was measured using the Copper Method proposed by Albanese 
and Irby (1944). 

Three drops of a 48 hour skim milk culture of P_. fluorescens 
were used to inoculate an erlenmeyer flask containing 100 ml 
of sterile skim milk. The inoculated flask was incubated at 
25°C for 48 hours. 

Four 2 ml portions of the culture were aseptically trans¬ 
ferred to test tubes and lipolysis determined. At the same 
time 20 ml of culture and 50 ml of the borate buffer were 
added to each of two 125 ml erlenmeyer flasks. When these had

removed from the water bath and from it aliquot portions were 
taken for duplicate amino N determinations * The second flask 
was removed at the end of the reaction period and similar aliquots 
taken*

Lipolysis (Table 4) was observed to have taken place to 
the extent of 0.40 ml during the half-hour reaction period. 
During the same period, based on 2 ml of culture, an increase 
in amino N of 0.003 mg was noted. This increase was equivalent 
to 0.01 ml of 0.02 N NaOH. Subsequent observations on the 
increase in amino N during the reaction period have shown that 
it was approximately constant at 0.003 mg despite variations

in lipolysis. 

Protein as a source of ethe^-soluble acid, contributing 
significantly to the titration increase of samples of P♦ 
fluoresce ns, was therefore eliminated. 

( d) Lactose as Acid Source 

Lactose breakdown during the reaction period also might 
be a source of ether-soluble acids measured by the method. 
Therefore, in conjunction with the amino N determinations, 
further aliquot samples were removed from the erlenmeyer flasks 
and lactose was measured using the gravimetric lactose method 
(Methods of Analysis, 6th Edition, A.C.A.G. 1945). 

When lipolysis was 0.40 ml a decrease of 0.001 g of 
lactose occurred in the sample (Table 4). The 0.001 g of 
lactose, if converted completely to acids such as acetic and 
lactic, would contribute significantly to the value for lipolysis. 

At this time the accuracy of this method of determining 
lactose was questioned on the grounds that it is actually a 
measure of the reducing capacity of a solution and unsuitable 
for measuring very small quantities of lactose. 

In view of this and in view of the fact that previously 
E« coli , an organism capable of forming organic acids from 
lactose, did not produce an increase in acidity during the 
reaction period, it was assumed that lactose could be disre¬ 
garded as affecting the values for lipolysis. 

The conclusion that the increased titer obtained, at the 
end of the reaction period, with a sample of a culture of P.

fluorescens was due to acid released from tributyrin has been 
further substantiated by studies of other changes which might 
take place during the reaction period. Changes in number of 
cells, in the amino N and lactose content during the reaction 
period have been investigated and shown to be of little im¬ 
portance in affecting the results of lipolytic determinations. 

5. Buffering at Various pH*s 

The effect of buffering at pH 5.5, 7.0 and 8.5 was in¬ 
vestigated. 

A buffer, designed to give a buffered sample of culture 

at pH 5.5, was prepared by adding 17 ml of M H^PO^ to 233 ml 

of M/l5 HagHPO^,2HgO. A second buffer, designed to give a 
pH of 7.0, was prepared by adding 8.34 ml of 0.6 M H^BO^ and 

O. 25 ml of N NaOH to 41.41 ml of H^O. r ^ CLe re S u l ar borate 

buffer was used to give samples buffered at pH 8.5. 

Tubes of skim milk were inoculated in triplicate with 

P. fluorescens , S taphylococcus a lbus , E. coli , Bacillus 
s ubtilis and Alcaligenes faecalis ♦ The P\ fluorescens cul¬ 
tures were incubated at 21°C and the remaining cultures were 
incubated at 37°G for 72 hours. The 3 cultures of each 
organism provided samples for lipolytic measurements at pH 
5.5, 7.0 and 8.5. Three 2 ml samples of each organism were 
buffered at each pH by adding to them 5 ml of the appropriate 
buffer. One of the 3 samples acted as a blank in each instance. 
All buffered samples were checked on a Beckman potentiometer 
and adjusted to their proper pH ! s where necessary.

At the lowest pH it was observed that the samples tended 
to coagulate when the buffer was added. The coagulum, which 
broke up during shaking, clung to the sides of the tubes after 
shaking. This could be a limiting factor in the application 
of this method at a low pH since the sample and occluded 
substrate clinging to the sides of the test tube would be at 
a different temperature during the reaction period than the 
buffered sample and substrate in the lower part of the tube. 
However the amount of material clinging to the sides of the 
test tube was small and the error so introduced was arbitrarily 
concluded to be small.

lipolysis when buffered at pH 5*5 and 7.0, maximum lipclysis 
was obtained at pH 8.5. All other cultures were non-lipolytic 
at pH 5.5, E._ coli and faecalis were questionably lipolytic 
at pH 7.0 and S_. albus , B. subtilis and JU faecalis were 
questionably lipolytic at pH 8.5. 

The general effect of lowering the pH was one of inhibiting 
the lipolysis. 

4. Concentration of Substrate 

Smith in his investigations on milk lipase found that 
with highly lipolytic milks, using a 2 ml sample of milk, 

0.2 ml of tributyrin as substrate were insufficient for 
maximum hydrolysis during the reaction period. To determine 
the effect of concentration of substrate on the measument of 
lipclysis of a bacterial culture varying amounts of tributyrin 
were added to 2 cultures of fluorescens varying only in age. 

Two erlenmeyers, each containing 100 ml of skim milk, 
were inoculated with 2 loopfuls of a 24 hour agar slant culture 
of fluorescens . Both were incubated at 27°C, one for 30 
hours, the other for 48 hours. Subsequent treatment of each 
culture was identical. 

Forty ml of culture were buffered with 100 ml of borate 
buffer and 7 ml of the buffered sample were pipetted into 
test tubes. Varying amounts of tributyrin were added to each 
when it had reached the reaction temperature. The remainder 
of the procedure was carried out as usual except that 3.5 ml 
of 1.5 M H-^PO^ were used to stop lipolysis and 0.025 N NaOH was

The results obtained for the two cultures of P_* fluorescens 
are shown in Table 6. Curves A and B (Figure 1) represent the 
lipolytic activity of the 30 and 48 hour cultures respectively* 
Maximum lipolysis was obtained from the 30 hour culture when 
0.2 ml of tributyrin were used but this amount of tributyrin 
was inadequate for the highly lipolytic 48 hour culture.

For cultures with lipolysis over 1.25 ml the amount of 
tributyrin should be increased to 0.8 ml. It is believed that 
for the great majority of cultures lipolysis will not be sc 
high as to require an increase in the amount of tributyrin. 

Smith has recommended that in the case of highly lipolytic 
milks the sample size might be reduced to 1 ml.

culture of P_. f luorescens . The cultures were incubated at 
21°C for 36 hours when the lipase activity of each was measured. 
For each replicate one 2 ml sample served as a blank and two 
2 ml samples were held for the 30 min. reaction period. An 
uninoculated skim milk control was included in the series. 

Lipolytic values for the 10 replicate cultures are shown 
in Table 7. The mean lipolysis was 0.75 ml. The highest 
and lowest values were found to deviate from the mean by approxi 
mately ± 13%. This deviation could be expected from growth 
differences between replicates. 

6. Amount of Inoculum 

To determine if the inoculum caused considerable variation 
in subsequent lipolysis by cultures, tubes of skim milk were 
inoculated by two methods as follows, 

1. Three tubes were inoculated by a loop of an 18 hour agar 
slant culture of fluorescens . 

2. Varying amounts (0.01 to 0.5 ml) of a suspension of P. 
fluorescens in sterile water were added to 12 tubes. The 
suspension was prepared by scraping the growth from an 18 hour 
agar slant culture into 5 ml of sterile water and mixing well. 

All cultures were incubated at 21°C for 24 hours and 
lipolysis determined as usual except that one blank served for 
all tubes. 

The three cultures inoculated by means of a loop gave 
lipolysis values of 0.28, 0.29 and 0.38 ml (Table 8). The 
amount of suspension and subsequent lipolysis did not bear 
an interpretable relation to each other although the larger

amounts of suspension, 0.20 and 0.50 ml were associated with 
the higher lipolytic values of 0.58 and 0.56 ml. 

Since differences in lipolysis are likely to result from 
growth variations it is probable that loop inoculations are 
sufficiently accurate for most work with this method.

B. LIPOLYTIC ACTIVITY OF VARIOUS O RGANISMS 
The method as previously described was used to compare 
the lipolytic activity of 11 species of 7 bacterial genera, 
an unidentified yeast and an unidentified mold. Included in 
the bacteria was an unidentified bacterium, isolated from 
rancid butter, which gives the odor of freshly cut apples. 

Ten ml skim milk cultures were prepared and at the same 
time plates containing nile blue sulphate agar plus 0.5% tri- 
butyrin were inoculated with the bacteria with the exception 
of the yeast and the mold. All cultures were incubated for 
72 hours at 25°C. The skim milk cultures were tested in 
duplicate for lipolysis by the proposed method and the giant 
colonies on the plates were examined for lipolysis as shown 
by blue stained globules surrounding the colonies. 

Streptococcus laetis , Aerobacter aerogenes , Escherichia 
coll . Bacillus subtilis . Pseudomonas putrefaciens , Staphylococcus 
albus , unknown organism producing an apple odor, and a yeast 
proved to be non-lipolytic (Table 9). A lcaligenes faecalls , 

S. aureus and a mold were found to be questionably lipolytic 
and Mycobacterium smegmatls weakly lipolytic, while P. 
fluorescens exhibited strong lipolysis. 

The observations of the action of the organisms on nile 
blue sulphate agar, containing tributyrin as substrate, are, 
for the most part, in agreement with the titration results. 

The qualitative, but incomplete quantitative, parallelism be¬ 
tween the titration results and those of the nile blue tech¬ 
nique may be accounted for by the following two observations:-

1. The giant colonies on the nile blue sulphate agar were 
in contact with the substrate for a longer period than in the 
titration procedure and it was possible that oxidizing enzymes 
brought about changes which were interpreted as lipolysis.

2. The pH of the nile blue sulphate agar was approxi¬ 
mately 7.0 while the cultures were buffered at pH 8.5 in the 
titration procedure and it is known that an enzyme that is 
active at one pH is not necessarily active at another pH. 

Thornton, Shaw and Wood (1948) have shown that certain 
organisms are capable of producing a bitter defect in cream 
held at low temperatures. Six such organisms were supplied 
to the author. 

Skim milk cultures of these organisms, identified as 
Al, 2 and 3, and Bl, 2 and 3, were incubated at 27°C for 72 
hours and their lipolytic activity measured.

4 to pH 11 was obtained. Each buffer was 0.1 M with respect 
to boric acid. The composition of these buffers is given in 
Table 11. 

One hundred ml of sterile skim milk in an erlenmeyer flask 
were inoculated with 5 loopfuls of a 24 hour agar slant culture 
of fluorescens . The culture was incubated at 21°C for 48 

hours. 

Five ml of 12 buffers were pipetted into separate test 
tubes and 2 ml of the skim milk culture added to each. After 
warming to 30°C in a water bath and 0.2 ml of tributyrin had 
been mixed in each tube, the pH of each buffered sample was 
determined. A Beckman potentiometer, standardized at pH 8.60 
and checked at pH 7.00 was used. The electrodes were rinsed 
with distilled water at 30°C and dried with paper tissue after 
each determination. 

Lipase determinations were carried out as usual on dupli¬ 
cates of the above. Two blank determinations were carried out 
with culture buffered at pH 4.47 and 8.87. 

A second culture, inoculated by means of 3 loopfuls of 
P. fluorescens from a 24 hour agar slant culture and incubated 
at 21°C for only 24 hours, was similarly treated. An additional 
buffer, buffering the culture at pH 9.67, was included in the 
case of this culture. 

Table 12 and figures 2 and 3 show the results obtained 
for the 2 cultures of P^ fluorescens . Figure 2 shows that 
at the beginning of the reaction period the optimum pH for the

48 hour culture was 8.87. Figure 3 shows the optimum pH for 
the 24 hour culture to be 8.92. On the basis of these results 
it is believed that cultures of fluorescens ,• when buffered 
at approximately pH 8.90, will give maximum lipolysis.

was eliminated by Smith. 

It is interesting to note that this pH optimum for P_* . 
fluorescens is almost the same as the pH optimum, 8.75, 
reported for milk lipase by Smith. 

Quite apart from the effect of pH on hydrolysis it was 
found that culture buffered above pH 9.00 exhibited a marked 
greenish-yellow color. This would support the theory suggested 
by Young (1947) that pigment production is associated with 
alkalinity. Acid has been reported as destroying this color. 

In this study, when acid was added to old skim milk cultures 
of fluorescens showing strong greenish-yellow color, the 
color disappeared. 

2. Effect of pH During Growth 

Twenty-five ml of skim milk were placed in each of 12 large 
(20mm x 200mm) test tubes and sterilized. After cooling, 
varying amounts of sterile 5 M HgPO^ or sterile 5 N NaOH were 
added aseptically to the tubes and mixed well. Five ml of skim 
milk from each tube were removed aseptically and the pH determined 
at 22°C with a Beckman potentiometer previously standardized 
at pH 7.00 and checked at pH 4.00 and 8.60. Between each 
determination the electrodes were rinsed with distilled water 
and wiped dry with paper tissue. 

All tubes were inoculated by means of a loop with P. 
fluorescens from a 24 hour agar slant culture. The cultures 
were Incubated at 27°C for 24 hours. Following incubation 5 
ml of culture were aseptically removed from each tube and the 
pH determined as above.

Table 14 indicates the lipolysis obtained with P♦ 
fluorescens grown in skim milk adjusted to different pH 
values. P. flucrescens exhibited most lipolytic activity, 
2.00 ml, after growth in skim milk adjusted to pH 6.86. No 
lipolysis was evident when the organism was grown in skim 
milk at pH 3.91, 4.76 or 9.69. Growth of the organism was 
undoubtedly inhibited in such milks. Good lipolysis took

place at pH 6,0 to 9*0 and a secondary optimum was found to 
exist at pH 8.53 (Figure 4). 

There was little change in pH during the growth period 
when the organism was grown in skim milk adjusted to pH 6.86. 
The significance, however, of pH changes during the growth of 
P. fluorescens (Table 13) including the relation they may 
have to lipase production is not yet understood. 

Although no criterion of growth was included in the above 
experiment the opinion of the writer is that maximum lipase 
production by fluorescens is associated with maximum growth 
of this organism. 

In addition to pH observations it was noted that all 
samples which were lipolytic had an alkaloidal bitterness when 
tested organoleptically. This bitterness was most intense 
between pH 6.86 and 9.14. 

3. Effect of Temperature During Reaction Period 

Two ml samples of an 18 hair culture of P •_ fluorescens 
in skim milk were pipetted into a series of test tubes and 
buffered with 5 ml of the borate buffer. The buffered samples 
were then placed, in triplicate, in water baths adjusted to 
6°, 19°, 26°, 37.5°, 41.5°, 46.5°, and 52°C and allowed 3 mins, 
in which to reach the temperature of the bath. One tube from 
each triplicate set served as a blank and the remaining 2 were 
held for exactly 30 mins. Lipolysis was measured in the 
normal manner (Table 15 A). 

Subsequent to this an experiment of a similar nature was

With the highly lipolytic 24 hour culture (Curve B) the 
temperature of the reaction period was more critical than with 
the less lipolytic 18 hour culture (Curve A). 

During the reaction period heat has two effects on the 
lipolysis. Firstly, it supplies energy to the enzyme and below 
the optimum temperature this effect is dominant and the lipolysis 
is increased* Secondly, heat tends to denature the protein 
of the enzyme and above the optimum temperature and close to 
it this effect is dominant and the lipolysis is decreased* 

At the optimum temperature only a slight shift in conditions 
might be required to change the reaction over to one of inacti¬ 
vation* In view of this it was decided to retain a temperature 
of 37°C during the reaction period when measuring lipolysis 
by cultures of fluorescens * 

Tables 15 suggest that the lipase of P*_ f luorescens would 
be almost completely inactivated during pasteurization, (i.e. 

62°C for 30 mins*) 

4* Effect of Temperature During Growth 

Four skim milk cultures of fluorescens were prepared 
as usual and incubated at 4.5°, 21°, 2 t v° and 37°C for 48 hours* 
The lipase activity of each was then measured using 37°C as 
the temperature for the reaction period and 0*025 N NaOH for 
the titration of the liberated acid* 

Little or no lipase was produced when cultures of P * 
fluorescens were incubated for 48 hours at 4.5° and 37°C 
(Table 16). Optimum lipase production was obtained when the 
culture was incubated at 27°C.

It is believed that long incubation periods (several 
days) at 4«5°G would result in measurable amounts of lipase 
being produced by P^ fluorescens . However no experimental 
evidence is offered to substantiate this statement. 

5. Effect of Various Media 

Ten ml of nutrient broth, modified in various ways, and 
skim milk were inoculated with P_. fluorescens in the normal 
manner. The broth media were modified as follows: 

1. Broth + Oil -- 0.15% butter oil added to nutrient broth 

2. Broth + Agar - 0.05% agar ,f ff ” n 

5. Broth + Caseinate -- 0.05% sodium caseinate added to 

nutrient broth. 

4. Carbohydrate-free broth -- Nutrient broth Inoculated 

with E_. coli and incubated 
24 hours at 37°C. Culture

4. Continued -- filtered through a Berkefeld 

filter. Filtrate dispensed 
in 10 ml amounts and steri¬ 
lized in the autoclave. 

All cultures were incubated at 21°C for 24 hours and 
lipase determinations carried out with 1 sample of each culture 
as blank and 2 samples at the end of the reaction period. 
Buffered broth samples required adjustment with M H^PO^ to 
pH 8.5.

broth to which butter oil had been added (Table 17). 

Maximum lipase production took place when the organism was 
grown in nutrient broth containing sodium caseinate* 

The use of nutrient broth containing either agar or 
sodium caseinate, as the culture medium prior to the measure¬ 
ment of lipolysis, is considered to be limited* Cultures in 
such media have been observed to be susceptible to the 
formation of gels when ether is added to the acidified reaction 
mixture and shaken* Gel formation does not allow a 5 ml 
aliquot of the clear ether extract to be obtained. 

In preliminary investigations 0*7$ peptone solutions 
were unsatisfactory for promoting the production of lipase. 
Jamieson’s (1942) modification of ^Sullivan’s m K” Medium, 
asparagine in a buffered salt solution, was only slightly 
more effective than the peptone solutions* Fat-free skim 
milk (i.e* before reconstitution with water, the bacto skim 
milk was extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus for 24 
hours) was found to be equally as good a medium for lipase 
production as skim milk (I.e* Bacto skim milk without any 
special treatment). 

Supplementing the data appearing in Table 17 a comparison 
of the lipase activity of 24, 48 and 96 hour cultures of P * 
flucrespens in skim milk, nutrient broth and carbohydrate- 
free nutrient broth is made in Table 18. Forty-eight hour 
cultures of JL, flucressens in nutrient broth and carbohydrate-

free nutrient broth were more lipolytic than similar cultures 
in skim milk. It was felt that the tendency for gels to form 
with the former two media obviated their use in routine lipase 
determinations. The most reliable lipase results were obtained 
when the organism examined was incubated in skim milk despite 
the fact that various of the other culture media induced 
greater lipase production.

Since both agar and casein increase the lipolysis by P, 
fluorescens , it may be postulated that the colloidal state of 
the medium may be important in determining the amount of lipase 
produced. The presence of fat in the medium does not seem to 
be necessary for the production of this enzyme. 

Since carbohydrate-free broth cultures were the most lipo¬ 
lytic, added weight is given to the statement inferring that 
the breakdown of carbohydrate in skim milk to organic acids 
was not a source of the acids extracted and measured by this 


method

While the foregoing work with various media was being 
carried out, cultures of fluorescens in carbohydrate-free 

broth were observed to take on a marked green coloration. Such 
cultures when examined under ultra-violet light exhibited a 
pronounced light-green fluorescence. Nutrient broth and skim 
milk cultures of the same organism were only very slightly 
fluorescent. This particular property of carbohydrate-free 
broth was investigated further and is described under "Fluorescence” 

8. Fluorescence 

P. fluorescens was inoculated into ff K" medium and variously 
modified nutrient broth. All test tubes contained 10 ml of 
the particular medium. Following incubation at 21°C for 72 
hours the cultures were examined for extent of fluorescence 
by passing an ultra-violet light through the cultures. The 
examination for fluorescence took place in a dark room. 

The media were prepared and inoculated as follows:

,f K ft medium was the most fluorescent. The seventh medium, 
carbohydrate-free broth, exhibited good fluorescence. None 
of the several other modified broth cultures gave any evidence 
of increased fluorescence. 

It appears that only the combination of growing E. coli 
in nutrient broth, filtering the resulting culture and steri¬ 
lizing the filtrate in an autoclave resulted, in the above 
study, in a nutrient broth medium of increased fluorescence- 
producing properties for fluorescens . 

If asparagine is unavailable for the preparation of ,, K W 
medium, the above-mentioned carbohydrate-free broth may be used 
in the examination of flucrescans for fluorescence. 

Since cultures in f, K ft medium are poorly lipolytic it does 
not seem likely that lipolysis and fluorescence are related 
in any manner. 

7. Effect of Calcium Chloride 

It was found by Smith that 0.25 ml of 10% CaCl^ w ^ en 
to a 2 ml sample of milk increased hydrolysis as measured by 
the proposed method. The possibility that a similar effect 
might be obtained with cultures of P_. fluorescens was investi¬ 
gated. 

?♦ fluorescens was inoculated by means of a loop into 
50 ml of sterile skim milk and the culture was incubated at 
25°G for 72 hours. 

To 4 of 6 test tubes 0.25 ml of 10% CaClg was added. 
Buffer, culture and tributyrin were then added to the 6 tubes

in the normal manner. Two tubes were removed as blanks at the 
beginning of the reaction period. Lipolysis was measured with¬ 
out further deviation from the method as originally described. 

The addition of 0.25 ml of 10% CaClg to the reaction 
mixture to act as a lipase activator was not successful. The 
GaClg, as shown in Table 20, acted as a lipase inhibitor rather 
than an activator.

8. Action on Different Substrates 

Collins and Hammer (1934 a) have made th© statement that, 
"When an organism hydrolyzed one fat it also hydrolyzed most 
others." In support of this statement the enzyme activity of 
a 48 hour culture of ?_♦_ fluorescens In skim milk was determined 
using the proposed method with tributyrin, tricaproin and 
tricaprylin as substrates. The alkali used in the titrations 
was 0.025 N NaOH. 

Table 21 shows that although tributyrin was hydrolyzed 
to the greatest extent of the three triglycerides, tricaproin 
and tricaprylin were also hydrolyzed appreciably. These re-

This method of measuring lipase should be modified in 
some way to facilitate the addition of fats (as substrates) 
which are not in a liquid state* Fats composed of fatty acids 
insoluble in ether limit the usefulness of this method in 
carrying out investigations of the above nature* 

9* Nature of the lipase 

Growth of f luorescens on nile blue sulfate agar con¬ 

taining tributyrin is such that a clear halo appears surround¬ 
ing the colony and extending out from the colony approximately 
1 cm* In this clear area the globules of tributyrin have 
almost completely disappeared. It would appear that a fat- 
splitting enzyme capable of penetrating the medium for a con¬ 
siderable distance beyond the colony has been secreted by the 
organism* It is quite probable then, that a filtrate of a 
culture of this organism would possess some lipase activity*

A 48 hour litmus milk culture o f P, fluorescens was 
filtered through a Berkefeld filter* The filtration of this 
culture proved very difficult and only a small amount of 
filtrate was obtained before the filter became so clogged 
that further filtration was impossible. Lipase determinations 
were, however, carried out on the filtrate obtained and the 
lipolytic activity of the filtrate was compared with that of 
the original culture. 

The filtrate and original culture were lipolytic to the 
extent of 0.11 ml and 0.27 ml respectively. Because of the 
unsuitability of the filtration procedure little significance 
can be attached to these results. However they suggest that 
the filtrate possessed lipolytic properties and that the fat¬ 
splitting enzyme produced by__P. fluorescens is an extracellular 
enzyme. 

It is possible that with other methods of filtration more 
conclusive evidence might be obtained regarding the nature of 
the P._ fluorescens lipase. 

D. CHEESE LIPASE 

In recent years rancidity in cheese has been associated 
with the production of lower fatty acids such as butyric acid 
by the action of milk lipase on milk fat. Peterson, Johnson 
and Price (1948 b) are of the opinion that milk lipase is 
inactive at the pH of Cheddar cheese. Assuming this to be 
true, rancidity in cheese must be explained on the basis that 
other lipases are present in cheese. Peterson, Johnson and

Price believe that bacterial lipases are partially responsible 
for the more rapid flavor development in raw milk Cheddar 
cheese as compared to Cheddar cheese made from identical milk 
after pasteurization. 

In arriving at the conclusion that the milk lipase plays 
no part in the flavor development of Cheddar cheese these 
authors have used data concerning the lipase activity of milk 
and cheese. The method used for determining lipase in cheese 
was essentially the same as the Peterson, Johnson and Price 
method of determining milk lipase. 

A cheese extract was prepared first by mascerating 20 
g of cheese in 100 ml of water in a Waring Blendor, passing 
it through a hand homogenizer and centrifuging at 2000 r.p.m. 

A portion of the supernatant was buffered with 2 ml of 0.38 
M aniline buffer at pH 5.0 and diluted to 12 ml with water. 
Tributyrin (0.2 ml) was added and shaken. A 5 ml aliquot was 
removed immediately for titration while the remainder was 
incubated for 60 mins, at 40°C after which a further aliquot 
was removed and titrated. Titration differences between 
aliquots represented tributyrin hydrolysis. The titration 
was carried out by adding the aliquot to 5 ml of 0.02% 
alcoholic thymolphthalein. Two ml of ether were then added 
and the solution titrated to a definite blue with 0.1 N 
alcoholic NaOH. 

It was felt that confirmation of the results of Peterson, 
Johnson and Price and further information regarding cheese 
could be gained by applying the method of determining bacterial 
lipase, as herein proposed, to cheese extracts.

Extracts of 4 samples of commercial raw milk Cheddar 
cheese, varying from 15 days to 91 days old, were prepared 
according to the method cf Peterson, Johnson and Price, (1948 a) . 
Duplicate 2 ml portions of each extract were buffered with 5 
ml of a phosphate buffer (8.75 ml M H^PO^ and 1 ml M NaOH were 
added to 117 ml of M/15 NagHP0^.2Hg0) and adjusted to approxi¬ 
mately pH 5.0 with M H^PO^. The remainder of the procedure 
was carried out as usual except that a 45 min. reaction period 
was us ed.

No cheeses examined exhibited lipolysis (Table 22). 

An extract of a tf Blue M cheese at a later date also had no 
lipase activity at pH 5.0. 

These results could not b© reconciled with the fact 
that Peterson, Johnson and Price had stated that, "Most of 
the lipase active at pH 5.0 is set free between the fifth 
and hundredth day of ripening.” However, as the result of

a personal communication with Mr. M. H. Peterson it was 
learned that some commercial Cheddar cheeses exhibit no lipase 
activity at pH 5.0 at all and that some parts of a cheese 
may be entirely lacking in lipolytic activity. 

To counteract the latter, he recommends the use of 
extremely large samples or several small samples (20 g) with 
subsequent averaging of the lipolytic activities of these 
samples . 

If most Cheddar cheeses contain lipases active at pH 
5.0 it is difficult to understand why more of them do not 
become rancid. It may be that a lipase whose optimum activity 
is at an alkaline pH but having some activity at a low pH 
(e.g. P_. fluorescens lipase) is Important in causing cheese 


to become rancid

DISCUSSION 

The term lipase has been used exclusively in this paper 
although in most cases the activity being measured was that 
of a more specific enzyme, tributyrinase. Since the proposed 
method does, however, measure the activity of other triglyceride¬ 
splitting enzymes the use of the term lipase, referring to 
enzymes whose major specificity is toward glyceride substrates, 
was felt to be justified. 

It has been suggested that the first action of bacteria 
on fat is a hydrolytic cleavage by means of lipase into glycerol 
and fatty acids, this being followed by oxidative processes. 
Measurements of the lipolytic activity of bacteria, then, are 
actually concerned with the hydrolytic cleavage. If the 
oxidative processes are given time to act they will complicate 
the interpretation of lipolytic results. By allowing only a 
short time during which the bacterial enzymes may act on the 
fat the complicating oxidations may be materially reduced and 
possibly eliminated. The relatively short period (30 mins.), 
of the method heretofore described. In which the bacterial 
enzymes may act^ make it superior, in the opinion of the writer, 
to methods in which the bacteria are in contact with the fat 
for majiy hours. 

The 30 minute reaction period may, however, be criticized 
since weakly lipolytic cultures may not have sufficient time 
in which to produce a measurable effect on the fat. Longer 
incubation periods of such cultures prior to testing for 
lipolysis may prove advisable.

This may partially explain the results indicating that 
cultures of S taphylococcus were questionably or weakly lipolytic 
while Trussell and Weed have reported members of the genus 
Staphylococcus to be markedly lipolytic* 

Enzyme preparations used throughout this investigation 
have been crude and no attempt has been made to purify them* 

Such purification might obviate the routine use of the method* 
Indications are that the lipase of P*_ fluorescens will 
act in varying degrees on tributyrin when exposed to a variety 
of conditions* For example, fairly extreme conditions of pH 
and temperature are necessary to inactivate the lipase completely* 
While experimental evidence is lacking this may be pertinent 
to the rancid spoilage of dairy products. 

Although information regarding a greater diversity of 
microorganisms would materially augment this study it is 
believed that sufficient data have been presented to recommend 
the use of the method in the study of lipolysis of microorganisms. 
It is hoped that such studies will eventually aid in a better 
understanding of the significance of bacterial lipolysis in 
dairy products*

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

1. Another method of determining lipolysis by microorganisms 
has been presented. 

2. Experimental data have been offered to show that the 
method quantitatively measures the acid released from the 
substrate during the reaction period and that some other 
possible sources of acid, such as protein and lactose, do not 
affect the results. Although samples of a fluorescens cul¬ 
ture buffered at pH 7 s 7.0 and 8.5 gave higher results, lipolysis 
was also evident at pH 5.5. A substrate concentration of 0.2 
ml tributyrin was shown to be adequate when lipolysis was below 
1.0 ml. Variations in lipolysis between replicate samples of 

+ 13% of the mean were shown to exist and inoculation by means 
of a loop was concluded to be satisfactory for most work with 
this method. 

3. Measurements with the proposed method using an arbitrary 
criterion have shown cultures of S_ L l acLi s, A. aerogenes , E. 
coli , B. subtilis , P. putrefaciens , S. albus , an unknown 
organism producing an apple odor and a yeast to be non-lipolytic. 
A. faecalis , S. aureus and a mold were questionably lipolytic 
and smegatis weakly lioolytic while fluorescens exhibited 
strong lipolysis. Of 6 f? bitter ,f organisms similarly compared 

3 were weakly lipolytic and 3 were questionably lipolytic. 

4. The lipolysis of tributyrin by fluorescens has been 
studied and results indicate that:- 


A. Skim milk, as a culture medium, was the most reliable

for lipolysis determinations. Production of the enzyme was 
best when the organism was grown in skim milk adjusted to a 
pH nearly neutral and when the culture was incubated at 27°C® 

B. Good lipolysis occurred when the reaction mixture, 
i.e., the medium in which the substrate was dispersed, was 
buffered at a pH of approximately 8.90 and the reaction 
temperature was 37°C. 

C. Since tricaproin and tricaprylin were also broken 
down the lipase was not specific for tributyrin. 

D* The evidence that the fat-splitting enzyme produced 
by fluorescens is extracellular was indicative, but in¬ 
sufficiently strong to permit a definite conclusion. 

E. In the concentration used calcium chloride acted as 
an inhibitor to lipolysis® 

5. Good fluorescence was obtained when fluorescen s was 
grown in carbohydrate-free broth. 

6. Extracts of raw milk cheddar cheeses have been prepared 
and examined for lipolytic activity using the proposed method 
with a reaction period of 45 mins. None of the extracts so 
examined exhibited lipolysis®
