INTRODUCTION 


The physical equilibrium between coexisting liquid and 
gaseous phases has been the subject of much study for a number 
of years. Many simple systems of two components, and a smaller 
but growing number of complex systems have been investigated. 
The results of these experiments have been of theoretical and 
practical interest. The methods of thermodynamics have been 
of considerable assistance in prediction, correlation, and 
interpretation of the results. The v/ork to be described in 
what follows deals with the properties and behavior of gaseous 
hydrocarbon mixtures, and two phase, gas-liquid hydrocarbon 
systems of natural origin. The work is a continuation of a 
general project dealing with similar systems of both synthetic 
and natural origin. 

The determination of the P-V-T relationships of the gaseou 
state is a necessary preliminary procedure to study of the two 
phase gas-liquid systems. In addition, such information on the 
gaseous state is of theoretical and practical interest on its 
own account. The P-V-T relations of gases, whether expressed 
as empirical or theoretical equations of state, or in tabular 
or graphical form, throw light on the kinetic-molecular theory 
of matter and molecular forces, as well as provide data necess¬ 
ary to engineering calculations. Due to limitations of mathema 
tical analysis and precise knowledge of molecular behavior, 
exact equations of state exist only in differential form. 





2 


Recourse is made to measurement, either to determine the co¬ 
efficients of these equations as analytical expressions, or to 
devise empirical rules leading to expressions for P-V-T rela¬ 
tions, requiring a minimum of experiment. 

Only in the last decade have there been any extensive in¬ 
vestigations into the phase relationships of liquid-gas hydro¬ 
carbon systems over wide ranges of temperature and pressure. 
These studies have been stimulated by theoretical interest in 
the theory of solution, and by the need for precise data on 
such systems, over a wide range of temperature and pressure, 
in petroleum engineering. Under what might be called ordinary 
conditions of temperature and pressure far below critical con¬ 
ditions, ideal or limiting laws, such as that of Henry, are 
generally satisfactory. However, it has been long recognized 
that the ideal laws are of value as expressing qualitatively 
a theory, and in application are subject to error, an error 
increasingly great as the temperature and pressure increase. 

In modern technology, the use of high temperatures and pressures 
is becoming increasingly common, leading to a demand for more 
precise expression of the behavior of matter. 

The purpose of the current work in this laboratory is two¬ 
fold, It is hoped that the results will be useful in inter¬ 
pretation of the history of the Turner Valley oil field, and 
in providing data for proper operation with a vie?/ to optimum 
production. Second, the results do provide a means of examining 
and expanding the theoretical aspects of the subject.

The work was started in 1931 with studies of simple two 
component systems* These investigations could have "been extend¬ 
ed without limit, hut, when a method had been established, it 
was thought advisable to investigate complex polycomponent 
systems more nearly related to practise. Gillies and Hugill 
(6) investigated a complex system from a Turner Valley gas cap 
well, which may be described as limestone zone natural gas and 
naphtha. Davis and Boyer (1940) made preliminary studies using 
a Turner Valley limestone zone crude oil and Viking natural 
gas. 

The present work was carried out using the gas and crude 
oil from a well penetrating the Palaeozoic limestone in the 
Turner Valley Field. A new apparatus was devised for studying 
this equilibrium. Pressures, temperatures, and gas/oil ratios 
may be varied at will within wide limits. Samples of the 
liquid and gaseous phases in equilibrium may be taken for 
analysis. 

In addition, the P-V-T relationships of the natural gas 
were determined as information necessary to the main work des¬ 
cribed above. The fugacity, and thermodynamic properties of 
the gas at various pressures has been determined. Lewis 1 
fugacity rule (15) has been tested using the data obtained 
here, and also by other workers on other natural gases. 

Time did not permit a complete series of equilibrium 
measurements to be made on the two phase system. However, 
sufficient data were obtained to prove the method, and to 



4 


indicate the character of the results which may he obtained 
with the new apparatus. 

In appendix I, is described a new portable gas analysis 
apparatus ? embodying all the essential parts for the analysis 
of hydrocarbon gases.

LITERATURE 


During the past few years, a large bibliography on the 
equilibrium in hydrocarbon systems has been accumulated. 

•Johnson (9) and Piercey (19) have given a very comprehensive 
review of the literature on solubility in simple systems. 

Gillies and Hugill (6) have covered the literature concerning 
more complex hydrocarbon systems. In this report, it is pro¬ 
posed to refer to only those papers which have been published 
during the past year, or which have a direct bearing on the 
present work. 

Since the larger proportion of results in this project 
concern P-V-T relationships in the gaseous state, the literature 
on this subject will be considered first. The behavior of 
methane, and the computation of its thermodynamic properties 
has been given by Sage and Lacey (27), and by Evalnes and 
Gaddy (13). The data for ethane used in the present work is 
that due to Sage and Lacey (27), and for propane is due to 
Sage, Schaafsma and Lacey (23), and to Deschner and Brown (3). 
Sage et. al. have also provided data on butane (25), and on 
pentane (24). The data, given in these papers, have been 
chosen as the most reliable, and are used in this thesis in 
correlating the behavior of the natural gas used with composi¬ 
tion. In the application of Lewis’ fugacity rule to the natur¬ 
al gases, the fugacities of the components were computed from 
the data given in these references.

Robinson and Bliss (21) have derived equations for calcula¬ 
ting entropy, enthalpy, and energy changes in terms of volume 
from the equations of state of Van der Waal6 , Wohl, and Beattie- 
Bridgeman. These have been tested against published values 
determined graphically* The Beattie-Bridgeman equation is 
satisfactory to five to seven per cent for entropy, and twelve 
per cent for enthalpy determinations. The others are almost 
as good for entropy calculations but definitely inferior for 
enthalpy. 

Computation of the fugacity of the gases from P-V-T data 
followed the method of Lewis and Randall (15), based on 
"residual volumes" and graphical methods of integration. Ther¬ 
modynamic properties were computed by means of well known 
differential equations using both analytical and graphical pro¬ 
cedures. The methods, to be described more fully later, are 
well illustrated in general form by Edminster (4), and applied 
particularly to methane. 

While many papers have been published on simple two com¬ 
ponent hydrocarbon systems, few have been published on the 
system natural gas-crude oil. Miller (17) has pointed out the 
function of natural gas in the production of crude oil. It is 
necessary to have a complete picture of the phase relationships 
before an understanding of crude oil production is obtained. 
Lacey (14) showed that a hypothetical producing horizon, pro¬ 
ducing natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons with a normal boil¬ 
ing point of 200°C and higher, could, at a sufficiently high 




7 


pressure, contain only a single saturated gas phase. The fact, 
that increased pressure should vaporize and decreased pressure 
condense, is in contradistinction to normal behavior at near 
atmospheric pressure. The phenomenon is not new (9), and is 
exhibited by two phase, two component or polycomponent systems 
of either type gas-liquid or gas-solid. This phenomenon, 
known as retrograde condensation, plays an important part in 
crude oil production. This has been clearly expressed by 
many workers, and particularly by Katz and Kurata (11). 

Sage and Lacey (221 reported investigations on natural 
gas and crude oil from the California Dominguez field. Katz 
and Hachmuth (10) studied the equilibrium constants in a 
system of natural gas and crude oil, over a pressure range of 
one to two hundred atmospheres, and a temperature range of 
40° to 200° F. They show that the equilibrium constants for 
methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane and heptanes 
plus, converge towards one at the critical pressure of complete 
mutual solubility of both phases. 

Sage and Lacey (26) have attempted to correlate the equili¬ 
brium constant for methane in a variety of hydrocarbon systems, 
on the basis of the prevailing pressure, temperature, molecular 
weight, and chemical nature of the components other than methane 
in the system. Their results are applicable in predicting the 
behavior of methane in producing horizons. In this connection, 
Kederbragt (18) has pointed out that the equilibrium constants 
for methane should become higher if naphthenes and other aroma-

tics are present. Methane is less soluble in these than in 
members of the paraffin series. 


From his work on the systems ethane-normal butane, and 
ethane-normal heptane, Kay (12) concludes that qualitatively, 
the higher the'molecular weight, i.e. the higher the critical 
temperature of the solvent, the greater the temperature and 
pressure range over which the mixtures approximate perfect 
solutions. This has been shown clearly by Johnson (9), and in 
addition, that the critical pressure increases regularly with 
molecular weight and boiling point of the liquid component. 

Gilliland and Scheeline (7), from their work on two compon¬ 
ent hydrocarbon systems, conclude that the equilibrium constants 
for hydrocarbons are in considerable error around the critical 
region of the system. They suggest an empirical correlation 
for predicting phase equilibrium data in the critical region 
for two component hydrocarbon systems. For pressures below the 
critical, the expremental values are satisfactory. 

As pointed out by Ewell (5), verification of Lewis* fugacity 
rule would be very useful in calculating equilibrium constants 
used in considering chemical reactions at high temperatures 
and pressures. ¥o thorough test of Lewis* fugacity rule has 


been made however

THEORETICAL 


The study of the gaseous and liquid phases in physical 
equilibrium have given rise to many expressions relating the com¬ 
position of the phases* Probably the simplest quantitative re¬ 
lations applied to two component systems are Henry’s Law and 
Raoult* s Law. These are applicable only to ideal solutions and 
assume that the properties of the liquid are unchanged by pres¬ 
sure. They may only be applied to hydrocarbon systems at low 
pressures. 

Poynting (20) showed that the pressure on a liquid influenc¬ 
ed its vapor pressure according to the relation - 


Upg'T.X, 


VT # T.X. 


where Pp - vapor pressure of liquid 
P p s total pressure on liquid 
Yg - partial racial volume of liquid 
Vp - partial molal volume of vapor 


The equation is exact but describes only point conditions. In 
its application to the prediction of the behavior of the two 
phase system? integration Is required. Various integrations 
have been carried out under different assumptions? the princi¬ 
pal one being that the gas used to create pressure on the liquid 
is not soluble in the liquid. Obviously? this is not even appro¬ 
ximately true for the systems.dealt with here. In the present 
case? Integration requires a knowledge of Vp and Vg as functions 
of the pressure on the system and composition of both phases. 

In other words? an extensive series of measurements on the system 
is necessary.

A differential equation may be derived for eaah of the 
two phases in equilibrium. However, the practical application 
of these equations depends on the experimental evaluation of 
the coefficients. Boomer and Johnson (1) have pointed out that 
this presents considerable difficulty. 

P-Y-l Relationships 

As has been pointed out previously, exact mathematical 
expressions for the P-Y-T behavior of the gaseous state exist 
only in the differential form. A number of empirical equations 
of state for gases have been proposed, bht each is suitable only 
within the limits for which it was devised. While empirical 
equations of state are used to a large extent in engineering 
calculations, the fugacity, as proposed by Lewis and Randall 
(1.5) has probably a wider application. In the present work,, 
the fugacity was determined by evaluating the relation - 



RT Inf 
P 


where £ s fugacity 

a - ’’residual volume” 
~ RT - Y 
P 

P r pressure 
Y s volume 
T = degrees Kelvin 
R = gas constant 


The residual volume, a, is thus the difference between the 
actual volume and the ideal volume of a gas. The value of the 


integralj^ adP was obtained by graphical integration 


In considering the pressure of a gas mixture, Balton’s 
law applies only to mixtures that may be considered as ideal, 

















































11 


i.e. at low pressures. This law is of little value in the pre¬ 
sent work and recourse must he had to fugacity. Lewis (15) 
has proposed the following rule for the fugacity of a gaseous 
mixture - £= hi-fp 0 

- f t - f l% * f 2 l] 2 * ------ 

where £p z fugacity of a component in a 
gaseous mixture 

s mol fraction of the component 
in the mixture 

fl°- fugacity of the pure component 
at the same temperature and 
total pressure as the mixture 
= fugacity of the mixture 

Verification of this rule would enable the fugacity of the 
gas to he calculated from an analysis? given the fugacity - 
pressure relations for the pure components. These latter re¬ 
lations are known for many gases? and in particular for the 
paraffin gases. 

Solubility Measurements 

The Gibb's Phase Rule indicates that the simple two com¬ 
ponent? gas-liquid system is univariant. This system may be 
represented graphically on this basis. The representation of 
a polycomponent system? such as the present one? is more 
difficult. As has been pointed out above differential equa¬ 
tions may be derived for each phase? but the evaluation of the 
coefficients? from experiment is exceedingly difficult. 

Probably? the so-called equilibrium constants serve best 
to describe the systems. Furthermore? empirical rules describ¬ 
ing the variations in these constants should be simple. The 








12 


equilibrium constant may be defined in the ideal case as - 

K - Cp 1 

C 1 L 

G 

where G^ = concentration of the component 
in the gas phase, 
concentration of the component 
in the Liquid phase. 

True constants can be expected only if both the liquid 
and gaseous phases behave ideally; v/hich they do not do. 

Hence the true constants, determining the free energy of the 
components, can be found only from a knowledge of the activit¬ 
ies of the components. Expressions relating equilibrium con¬ 
stants to the properties of the components of the system, 
pressure and temperature, can be established only when the 
fugacities or activities of the components in each phase are 
known. 

While in the present report insufficient data have been 
collected for the establishment of empirical relations, the 
results of the experiments will be discussed qualitatively.

EXPERIMENTAL 


Materials 

A preliminary series of experiments were carried out, 
using samples of natural gas and crude oil from the Home- 
Millarville #3 well in Turner Valley. The gas mixing and 
storage system proved unsatisfactory, and was redesigned for 
the present v/ork. A second set of samples were obtained from 
Alberta Oil Incomes #2 well. 

In January, 1941, when the samples were taken, this well 
produced 45 barrels of crude oil daily, at a gas/oil ratio 
of 6C0 cu. ft. per barrel. The bottom hole pressure was 
2750 p.s.i. and the bottom hole temperature 198°J. This well 
was the farthest north producing well in the Turner Valley 
field, being located in the centre of LSI. 4, Section 4, 

Township 21, Range 3, ¥est 5th M. 

The gas sample was taken through a h inch va,lve on a 
3 inch fuel line from the separator- The oil sample was taken 
through the bottom valve on the oil level gage on the separator. 
Eight standard gas cylinders were used to collect the gas 
sample, while the liquid sample was taken in a liquid bomb. 

The bomb iras first filled with water and as the oil was collect¬ 
ed, the water Yras drawn from the bottom. About 1/8 of the 
water was displaced from the bomb, while one cylinder was 
filled with gas to a pressure of approximately 200 p.s.i.

Samples were taken slowly over half hour intervals of time. 

A total time of four hours was required in filling the eight 
cylinders. During this time? the well operated steadily at 
19 bbl./hr. and a gas/oil ratio of 700 cu. ft./bbl. Sampling 
was carried out by the field staff of the Petroleum and natural 
Gas Conservation Board, supervised by Mr. G.A. Connell. 

The samples were treated in the laboratory as follows - 

The gas sample was bubbled through 20^ potassium hydroxide 
solution in a glass tower, packed with short lengths of glass 
tubing, to remove hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans (19). The 
scrubbed gas was stored in the gas holder M (Figure 2). From 
the gasholder, the gas was pumped into the low pressure storage 
tanks A and B by compressor Pi It was dried over calcium 
chloride in F. Each cylinder of gas was transferred in this 
manner to low pressure storage. Because of minor variations 
in composition in different cylinders, it was necessary to 
mix the whole gas throughly. Three gasholders in parallel 
were used in mixing operations. Gas from A and B was expanded 
to the gasholders through valve 5, and compressed again by com¬ 
pressor P. Gage F indicated the pressure of the gas in the 
storage tanks. The gas was circulated until a constant analysis 
was obtained. 

The liquid sample was displaced from the bomb by water, 
and scrubbed with 20^ potassium hydroxide solution in the glass- 
packed tower. The gas, liberated from solution in the oil, was

collected in a gasholder, and pumped into the low pressure 
storage tanks A and B with the gas sample before mixing. The 
oil line was connected at stopcock 3 (Figure 3), and the oil 
collected over water in carboy A. 

The composition of the gas was determined by analysis 
with the low temperature fractional distillation apparatus (6) 
(See Appendix I). The average of nine analyses gave -

The density of the gas Yfas determined in the conventional 

manner, - by weighing a calibrated bulb, containing the gas 

at a measured temperature and pressure. The average of a 

large number of determinations gave the following result -

The average deviation from this mean, was five parts in a 
thousand. The reason for this large deviation could not be 
determined with certainty, but is probably connected with the 
pentane content of the gas. That the method was satisfa,ctory, 
was shown by duplication of results to 0.1$, using dry air.

Apparatus 

The experimental apparatus may be described conveniently 
under three headings - 

1. High pressure system and equilibrium cylinder 

2. Low pressure analytical system 

3. Crude oil storage and dispensing system 

The high pressure system is shown diagrammatically in 
Figure 6. It consists essentially of drier K, high pressure 
gas measuring pipette M, deadweight piston gage A, and .. 
equilibrium cylinder P. The natural gas from storage (Figure 2) 
is admitted to the system through the booster compressor D 
(Figure 6). It enters the drier K through valve 4, and is 
admitted to the pipette M through valve 5. The system may be 
opened to the atmosphere E, through valve 3. The drier K is 
filled with potassium hydroxide pellets and is surrounded by 
an air bath H. The temperature of the air bath is kept near 
60°C by means of a 450 watt heater. The Bourdon gage F in¬ 
dicates approximately the pressure In the drier or the pipette 
The measuring pipette is surrounded by a thermostatically con¬ 
trolled oil bath, whose temperature is maintained at 60°C ~ 

0.15°. Valve 6 connects the pipette to the piston gage and 
the equilibrium cylinder. The pipette is connected through 
valve 8 to a hydraulic pump fed by mercury. Mercury may be ' 
drained from the pipette through blow off valve 7. 












FIGUR E 6 - Diagram of the High Pressure System. 




























































































18 


Valve 1 connects the deadweight gage A to the system. A 
mercury IT-tube, B, is placed in the line. The gas leg of the 
U-tube is equipped with a blow off valve. An insulated lead 
terminates in a platinum point at the surface of the mercury. 

A galvanometer, dry cell, rheostat, and a lead grounded to the 
U-tube complete the circuit. The deflections on the galvano¬ 
meter, when the mercury contact is made or broken, indicate the 
level of the mercury. The 11-tube is necessary to prevent 
solution of the gas in the castor oil of the piston gage. 

The equilibrium cylinder P is immersed in a thermostati¬ 
cally controlled oil bath. The bath is heated by two 1500 
watt heaters Y, one of which is connected to the relay circuit. 
The cylinder is supported in the bath, on two metal cradles. 

It is raised from the bath by a screw jack and cable device.. 

Gas from the measuring pipette is admitted to the cylinder 
at R through the charging valve 10. T is a standard taper., 
steel, male connection, to which may be attached the liquid 
and. gas measuring device, operated at atmospheric pressure and 
to be de-scribed later. The bore of the connection is threaded 
and has an Internal seal, to fit a hardened steel closure plug. 
To the cylinder are connected a gas sample pipette V and a 
liquid sample pipette W. 

To eliminate the possibility of condensation of pentanes 
and butanes in the gases used, under the influence of the high 
pressures employed, provision is made to maintain all high

ing, are heated by a low voltage, high amperage current, obtain 1 
ed by means of a transformer fed by the laboratory supply at 
110 volts. The booster comp>ressor and oil trap are heated by 
wire type metallic resistors on 110 volts. The steel U-tube 
separating the gas from the piston gage is heated by a Ioyt 
voltage wire tyj3e resistor. The methods .of heating the high 
pressure drier and measuring pipette have been described. 

The equilibrium cylinder constructed of stainless steel, 
is 4” O.D., 3 1/1-6* r.D. and 12p n long. On each end is thread¬ 
ed a 2” steel collar 7” in diameter (Figure 8). The ends of 
the cylinder are constructed of stainless steel plates, 1 3/8” 
thick and 7” in diameter. These plates are attached to the 
cylinder by 8, 1” heat-treated steel bolts, 4j- w long, placed 
symmetrically around the steel collar (Figure 7j. Copper 
gaskets between the cylinder and end plates make the closure 
gas tight. 

The inner end of a bearing and packing gland carrier is 
screwed into the centre of one of the end plates, a tight 
steel to steel Joint being formed by a suitable seat in the 
end plate. The construction of this carrier and the drive 
shaft passing through it, is clearly shown in the scale dia¬ 
gram (Figure 8). The dotted lines represent alternate layers 
of plastic metallic packing and graphited asbestos packing. 

The packing is compressed by a gland follower on adjustment of

the packing nut as shown, Two steel pedestals mounted on the 
end plate carry a casting fitted with a hall thrust bearing, 
through which the drive shaft passes. On the outer end of the 
drive shaft is fitted a sprocket wheel to take the driving 
chain. 

Two 3/8" holes, -§- ,f deep are drilled and threaded on a 
vertical diameter, 1" above and 1” below the centre of the 
end plate from its inside face (Figure 8). From the bottom 
of these two holes are drilled two 1/8" holes to meet two 
3/16" holes drilled from the circumferential face of the end 
plate* At the top circumference face, the 3/16" hole becomes 
9/16” in diameter, threaded and seated to fit an adaioter, per¬ 
mitting connection with 1/16” x steel tubing by a standard 
joint used in this laboratory. The 3/16" hole to the bottom 
circumference face is expanded first into a -£ n hole x" deep 
which in turn becomes a 4 ,r hole threaded and seated to fit the 
connector on 1/8" x 5/16” copper tubing. 

This connector consists of a steel collar threaded and 
sweated on to the copper tube. The end of this collar is 
11/16" in diameter. The face is machined at an angle of 45° 
to the axis of the collar (Figure 8). The body of this collar 
is long and 13/32" in diameter. A follower, fitted with 
-J" threads, fitting over the body of the collar serves to seat 
the face of the collar as shown. A similar assembly is' attach¬ 
ed to the other end of the copper tubing.

All threaded parts are cut to standard S.A.E. specifications. 

The pump assembly is attached to the inside face of the 
end plate by two steel plugs, 3/8” in diameter by 5/8 M long 
screwed into the end plate. These plugs have a l/8 n flange at 
their outer end, 9/16 M in diameter, into which is cut a screw¬ 
driver slot. This flange holds the pump base plate to the 
end plate (Figure 8). A 1/8 11 hole to serve as a discharge 
conduit for the pumps is bored through the plugs. The pump 
base plate of thick brass plate is 3 M in diameter. A 5/8 M 
hole at its centre permits the passage of the main drive 
shaft into the cylinder. Two steel pedestals are mounted on 
the base plate, on a horizontal diameter and 1 M on each side, 
of the centre. They carry an upper and a lower brass bearing, 
the lower one for the shaft of the driving mitre gear* and the 
upper one for the shaft of the driven mitre gear. On the 
vertical, diameter of the base plate and 1 M on each side of the 
centre, two 9/16 M holes, 1/8 w deep, which decrease to 3/8 n 
holes for the remaining 1/8” of the plate^are cut. These holes 
take the two steel plugs which hold the base plate to the end 
plate. The cylinder heads are situated over these two holes 
and each is connected to the base plate by six 1/8” brass 
bolts, long. These bolts are countersunk in the underside 
of the base plate. 

The cylinders are constructed in one piece from 1 M hexa¬ 
gonal brass rod. Except for a 1/8 M base flange, and in the 





























V '*'■> 'i

case of the liquid pump over a i" length carrying the intake 
valve, the cylinders are machined to a cylindrical cross-section. 

The liquid cylinder of 5/8" outside diameter, except as 
noted above, and of 3/8" inside diameter is 3" long. A small 
cone shaped intake valve hacked by a light spring fits a valve 
seat screwed into the bottom side of the cylinder opposite to 
the end of the piston stroke. This type of intake valve per¬ 
forms satisfactorily in the liquid pump but cannot be used on 
the gas pump. The exhaust valve, a ball backed by a light 
spring is carried in a flanged tube 5/16" I.D. and 3/8" O.D. 
to fit the cylinder bore as shown. The piston for the liquid 
cylinder is a 3/8" steel rod, flanged at one end, terminating 
above the flange as a threaded bolt. 

The gas cylinder of 1" 0.1). and 3 1/16" long is bored to 
take a 11/16" diameter piston for a distance that leaves 1/16" 
clearance at the end of the pumping stroke. From this point 
to the flanged bottom, the cylinder is bored to 3/8" diameter 
to fit an exhaust valve identical with that on the liquid 
cylinder. The piston itself carries the intake valve in its 
hollow interior, gas being admitted through six 1/16" holes, 
bored through the flange at the outer end of the piston. The 
valve, of steel, is of the conical type with stem, backed by 
a light spring and fits a seat cut in the piston head. The 
hexagonal flange at the outer end of the piston, cut from a 
i" hexagonal bar, screws into the hollow piston and terminates 
at its outer end in a threaded bolt. 



23 


Identical U-shaped "brass guides are screwed to the piston 
ends* These guides are cut to have a 15/16” clearance between 
the inside of the arms of the U and fit cylindrical steel driv¬ 
ing cams, 7/8" in diameter. The construction of the driving 
mechanism is self explanatory from Figure 8. The brass sections 
represent the bearings and U-bars. The gears are 7/8" steel 
mitre gears. The driven gear carries a shaft terminating at 
each end in a driving cam. The centre line of the shaft is 
removed from the centre of the cams, thus producing on rotation 
a -J" stroke In the pumps. The driving gear is connected to 
a short driving shaft by a flexible, pinned joint. The other 
end of this shaft is connected to the end of the main drive 
shaft by a similar joint. This makes in effect a simple uni¬ 
versal joint necessary to absorb any small lateral displace¬ 
ment between the drive shaft and pumping mechanism. 

The end plate closing the other end of the cylinder is 
of relatively simple construction• It is the same size as 
the other plate, and is attached to the cylinder in the same 
manner (Figure 7). It is fitted with three holes, -§•" deep and 
threaded to 9/10" S.A.E. standard in order to take the standard 
tubing connectors used. Fluid passages, 1/8" in diameter, 
extend from the bottom of the holes through the end plate. 

Two holes are on the vertical centre line, and. the third is to 
one side on the horizontal centre line. An adapter of 1" 
round chrome molybdenum steel bar with 9/16" S.A.E. threads on 
one end fits the lower hole in the end plate. The adapter, 4^"

long, is fitted at its other end with a standard connector for 
the valve of the liquid sample vessel (Figure 7). 

The upper hole in the end plate is connected by steel 
tubing to the valve on the gas sample vessel with standard 
connectors. The third hole in the end plate is connected by 
l/16 n x steel tubing and standard connectors to the charg¬ 
ing valve as shown. 

The steel sample vessels or pipettes are connected as ill¬ 
ustrated in Figure 7. The gas sample pipette which is situated 
along the top of the equilibrium cylinder is constructed from 
a lx n hexagonal steel rod 7*’ long. A i M hole tapered at the 
bottom and 5-j§ n long is drilled in the rod. The open end is 
threaded with 1 M S.A.S. standard threads and carries a closure 
plug seating on a conical shoulder at the inner end of the 
threads. This plug is fitted with a. standard male tubing- 
connection at its outer end to fit a valve. A 1/8 H hole bored 
through the plug,serves as a gas passage. The closed end of 
the pipette is machined to a standard male tubing connection 
to fit a valve. A 1/8 n hole bored through this connection to 
the inside of the pipette serves as a gas passage. 

The position and design of this pipette has been shown 
by experience to be somewhat unsatisfactory by introducing 
ambiguity in the results. Another pipette of greater diameter 
and less length, and occupying a vertical posit ion,will be 
used in future Work. 




25 


The construction of the liquid pipette is like that of the 
gas pipette except in its dimensions and the upper valve. In 
this case, the valve is of a right angle type, while the others 
are of the straight through type. An adapter connects the valve 
at the "bottom ‘of the liquid pipette to the copper tube, connect¬ 
ing to the discharge from the liquid pump. A tin container 
soldered around the upper end of the liquid pipette (Figure 7) 
is used to hold a freezing mixture at one point in the proce¬ 
dure . 

The volumes of the gas and liquid sample pipettes were 
determined by weighing the amount of mercury required to fill 
them at 25°C. Computations showed that the variation in volume 
with pressure was insignificant, a result found experimentally 
in a similar case by Johnson (9). The variation in volume 
with temperature, computed from the coefficient of thermal ex¬ 
pansion of the steel used, is appreciable however. The follow¬ 
ing-volumes in'ccnwwere found: 

Temperature °C 25 60 98 

Liquid Sample Pipette 59.72 59.79 59.87 

Gas Sample Pipette 27.98 28.02 28.06 

The measured volumes at 25°C are correct to— 0.04% as 
shown by three separate measurements as described. 

The apparatus was designed to permit .the use of a wide 
range of gas/oil ratios. As described it can be used only for 
rather high ratios and provision was made for experiments at 
lower ratios. 

For the rjresent series of experiments, a steel plug 5 n 





FIG-DEES 9 - The Experimental Apparatus.

long and 2 15/16” in diameter was placed in the cylinder 
between the pumps and the opposite end plate* This plug not 
only reduced the quantitycf materials used in an experiment, 
an important consideration, but also permited the use of lower 
gas/oil ratios. A second plug, 5” long, but only a half cylinder 
of 2. 15/16” diameter in cross-section was also made. It may 
be fitted into the cylinder occupying gas phase space only and 
allowing still further reduced gas/oil ratios. 

The analytical system is similar to that used by Gillies 
and Hugill (6). It is proposed to detail only changes in the 
apparatus, which were found necessary for the present work. 

The apparatus is shown diagrammatically in Figure 11. It 
is composed of three parts, - the condenser train, the gas 
storage and measuring system, and the low temperature fraction¬ 
ation assembly. The apparatus is made of Pyrex glass through¬ 
out, except for special metal parts, and is designed for high 
vacuum work. The pumping system consists of a two stage mer¬ 
cury diffusion pump, backed by a Kyvac oil pump. A glass 
vacuum line is connected at suitable points, V, to the appara¬ 
tus. 

The gas sample and liquid sample pipettes are attached at 
connector P. To P is soldered a small bore, brass tube, coil¬ 
ed in a spiral, terminating in a standard taper, steel connection. 
To this connection, a ground glass joint is sealed, with seal¬ 
ing compound. Condenser A is connected to the apparatus by 
means of a ground glass joint. Trap X is necessary to prevent

liquid from condenser A being carried over mechanically into 
condenser B* Around condenser B is placed a Dewar flask con¬ 
taining a dry ice-acetone mixture* Condenser C is sealed in 
a short outer tube carrying a vacuum connection and terminat¬ 
ing in a ground joint which fits a ground joint inserted in 
the stopper of a Dewar flask. This Dewar flask is filled with 
dry ice-acetone mixture which under vacuum gives a temperature 
of -112°C. Condensers B and C are provided with double junc¬ 
tion copper-constantan thermocouples, IT. is a small tube of 
about 5 ccm. capacity, which is joined to the apparatus through 
a thin walled capillary tube. The fractions, condensed in 
condensers B and C, from the expansion of the gas phase sample, 
are distilled into IT at the temperature of liquid air. If is 
removed from the apparatus by sealing off the capillary with 
an oxygin^gas flame. 

The equilibrium cylinder may be connected to the vacuum 
linve V through stopcock 25 by means of the copper tube J and 
a standard connector. The copper tube is soldered into one 
end of a brass cylinder. The glass tube is fitted into the' 
other and, and sealed in place by means of sealing wax. 

The entire measuring system is calibrated, and consists 
of six one-litre flasks mounted within an air bath. The system 
is connected to the Toepler pump f and the constant volume 
manometer Mg. The manometer scale was compared with a precision 
cathetometer and found to be without significant error.

The low temperature fractionation assembly has been fully 
described by Gillies and Hugill (6), and will not be discuss¬ 
ed here. Description of a new portable gas analysis apparatus 
is given in Appendix I of this thesis. 

The crude oil used in this work is stored over water in 
and dispensed from carboy A (Figure 3). An oil sample may be 
withdrawn at D, by opening stopcock 2, and raising the water 
resevoir B. The oil is dried over anhydrous calcium chloride 
in C. Drier C is connected to the assembly by means of two 
ground glass joints, permitting easy removal of the calcium 
chloride. The crude oil sampler consists of a one litre flask 
F, and capillary tubing, as shown in the diagram. The ground 
glass joint E fits the standard taper male connection on the 
equilibrium cylinder charging valve. Connection from the gas 
measuring pipette is made at H. All stopcocks and ground glass 
connections in the oil dispensing system are lubricated by a 
gel of mannitol and glycerol* This lubricant is insoluble in 
hydrocarbon oils and behaves satisfactorily if renewed frequent¬ 


ly.

Procedure 


* P-V-'J- 1 Relationships 

The gas sample pipette V (Figure 6) was evacuated, and 
suspended in the large oil hath. Connection between valve 9 
and the gas measuring pipette M, was made by a length of steel 
tubing. The temperatures of the oil baths were adjusted to the 
desired values, and the high pressure gas handling system heat¬ 
ed to about 60°C as described previously. Valves 2, 4, 5, 6 
and 9 were opened, and gas from storage admitted to the booster 
compressor D, at C. The pressure in the system was raised to 
the desired level, as indicated by the Bourdon gage F. The 
booster compressor was turned off, and valves 2, 4 and 5 
closed. The deadweight piston gage A was opened to the pipettes, 
by opening valve 1. Fine adjustment of the pressure to the 
desired value was obtained by allowing gas to escape through 
valve 7, ox* by pumping mercury into the gas measuring pipette 
through valve 8. When the deadweight gage was balanced, valve 
9, and then valves 1 and 6 were closed. The pipette V was 
removed from the oil bath and connected at P (Figure 11). 

All necessary parts of the analytical and storage system 
were evacuated. The valve on the pipette was slightly opened 
and the gas allowed to expand through the Toepler pump T to 
the measuring flasks. The gas left in the pipette and condens¬ 
er train was transferred by neans of the Toepher pump to the 













30 


measuring system, until the residual pressure, as measured 
by McLeod gage Lp, was about 1 mm of mercury. The Toepler pump 
was then isolated, and the residual pressure measured exactly 
on the McLeod gage. The temperature of the storage bulbs was 
brought to constant value, by forced circulation of air in the 
cabinet. At this point, the pressure of the gas was measured 
on manometer Mg and the temperature of the bulbs noted. The 
temperature of the manometer was read. 

Duplicate density measurements were made on the gas, us¬ 
ing the calibrated density bulb attached at K. The technique 
used was that described by Gillies and Eugill (6). 

Sample Calculation 

The pressure-volume product of the compressed gas at 
pressure p and temperature T was calculated as follows:-

Solubility Measurements 

The equilibrium cylinder was set in place? as shown in 
Figure 6* Valves 9? 11? 12 and 13 were opened. The steel 
closure plug was remoTed from the standard, taper connection T? 
and. ground glass Joint E (Figure 3) fitted over the connection. 
Stopcock I [Figure 3) was closed, to the cylinder? and H connected 
to the gas measuring pipette at waive 6 [Figure 6) by means of 
rubber tubing. R Y/as connected to the vacuum line? V? by the 
copper connection J (Figure 11]. When the cylinder and. pipettes 
were evacuated valve 10 was closed. 






32. 


A sample of oil was drawn from storage into flask F 
(Figure 3), chilled in ice. The flask and the sample of oil 
were weighed, and flask F, put in place as shown in Figure 3. 
Stopcock I was opened, so that the oil from the flask entered 
the equilibrium cylinder at E. When nearly all the oil was 
drawn into the cylinder, stopcock I was turned so that H was 
connected to E. Valve 6 on the gas measuring pipette was opened, 
until the pressure in the equilibrium cylinder was atmospheric, 
as indicated by a manometer, connected at H (Figure 3). The 
amount of gas added was noted! The liquid sampler was disconnect¬ 
ed and the closure plug- screwed quickly into the taper connec¬ 
tion T. The flask and residual oil were weighed, and the 
weight and volume of oil added was determined. 

The volume of gas at 25°C and 1 atmosphere pressure, to give 
a desired gas/oil ratio was then calculated. From the PV vs p 
curves (Figure 12] this volume was converted to the volume of 
gas at 60°C, the temperature of the gas measuring pipette, and 
at a reference pressure usually 150G p.s.i. 

Connection between the gas measuring pipette and the 
equilibrium cylinder was made by a length of steel tubing. 

Valve 10 was closed and valVe 6 opened. Mercury in the gas 
measuring pipette was drained out through valve 7. The pressure 
of the gas in the pipette was raised to 1500 p.s.i., as measur¬ 
ed by the deadweight gage. Valve 5 was closed and valve 10 
opened and closed,. Mercury was pumped into the pipette until 
the pressure was again 1500 p.s.i. This procedure was repeated 






33 


until nearly all the gas in the neasuring pipette had been 
added. The actual volume of gas added at 6C°C and 1500 p.s.i. 
was determined by dravri.ng off the mercury through valve 7 and 
weighing it. This technique was repeated until the required 
volume of gas had been added. 

Valve 6 was then closed, and valves 1 and 10 opened. The 
drive mechanism of the pumx.)S was started and the temperature of 
the oil bath adjusted to the desired level. The pumps in the 
equilibrium cylinder were operated until a constant pressure 
as indicated by the deadweight gage was reached. Generally 
this took two hours. 

At this point, valves I and 10 were closed, and the drive 
mechanism of the pumps stopped. The equilibrium cylinder was 
raised rapidly from the oil bath, and valves 9, 11, 12 and 
13 closed. The pressure in the cylinder was released, and the 
gas pipette and the liquid pipette disconnected from the 
assembly. 

Expansion of Gas Phase Samp1e 

The gas pipette was attached at P (Figure 11), and all 
necessary parts of the analytical apparatus evacuated. Freez¬ 
ing mixtures of dry ice and acetone in Dewar flasks were 
placed around condensers B and C. The Dewar flask around 
condenser C was put on vacuum. When the temperatures of 
condensers B and C were -7Q°G and -112°C, respectively, the 
phase sample was expanded into the apparatus. The expansion

was carried out slowly so that pentanes and heavier fractions 
were trapped in condensers B and C. The "butanes and lighter 
left in the condenser train were pumped into the storage system 
"by means of the Toepler pump T. The pressure in the train was 
reduced to 0.1 mm "by surrounding condenser D with liquid air. 
This procedure resulted in complete removal of the "butanes and 
lighter gases from the condenser train with a minimum of pen¬ 
tanes and heavier hydrocarbons. Stopcock 4 was closed and 
the liquid air removed from condenser D. The gas produced ujjon 
evaporation of the liquid in condenser D was transferred com¬ 
pletely to the measuring system. The gas was circulated 
automatically for one hour "by means of a Maass control (16), 
connected to the Y/ater pump at ¥. The circulating system 
consisted of the measuring flasks and line to the manometer, 
Toepler pump, and the line from flask number I to the intake 
of the pump. The gas was measured, and duplicate density deter¬ 
minations were made. Duplicate samples were retained for 
analysis in the low temperature fractionation assembly. 

Liquid air was placed around tub.e TT, and the fractions 
from condensers B and. C distillled into it. The tube was re¬ 
moved, by sealing off the capillary with an oxygen-gas flame. 

The weight of the fraction^ and its refractive index were 


determined 



35 


Expansion of Liquid ir'ha s e Sample 

The expansion of the liquid phase sample was carried out 
in a similar manner* The greater portion of the oil was re¬ 
tained in condenser A, at room temperature. While the last 
of the butanes and lighter fractions were being removed from the 
condenser train, the oil in condenser A was agitated by a 
magnetic stirrer, operated from the outside by motion of a 
solenoid. The stirrer was constructed by sealing a piece of 
soft iron in a glas tube. This xjrevented the gas from being 
liberated in bursts from the oil with consequent movement to 
condenser B. The butanes and lighter fraction ?/ere treated 
as in the case of the gas phase sample. 

When the pressure in the condenser train was 0.1mm*, and 
with stopcock 4 closed, a freezing mixture of dry ice and 
acetone was placed in the cup sold.ered to the liquid sample 
pipette. The freezing mixtures were lowered from condensers 
B and C. and the light fractions therein distilled into the 
pipette. This procedure, rejjeated three to four tfcimes, serv¬ 
ed to wash down any oil residue left on the walls of the 
pipette. Finally, liquid air was placed around condenser A, 
and all the fractions distilled into it. Condenser A was 
removed and fitted with a cap, having a ground glass joint. 

The weight of the oil was determined and its density at 20°C 
measured. The mean molecular weight was determined, by the 
cryoscopic method described by Gillies and. Hugill (6). A

sample of the oil was fractionally distilled using the fraction¬ 
ation column shown in Figure 4. The refractive index of each 
fraction was determined with a pulfrich refractometer•

RESULTS AKD DISCUSUIOl 

The experimental results and their discussion will he 
presented in two principal parts* First will he given the 
P-V-T relationships of natural gas from Alherta Oil Incomes 
7/ell #2 (A.0*1* #2), plus a comparison with the behavior of 
somewhat similar gases (6) (22). Second, the behavior of the 
whole product of Alherta Oil Incomes Well #2 as a gas-liquid, 
two phase system in equilibrium will he presented* 

P-V-T Relationships of A.O.I. #2 Gas 

To obtain complete information as to the behavior of the 
natural gas used in this work, and. as a matter of interest to 
know the fugacity and other properties of the gas as a function 
of pressure, its P-V-T relationships were determined at three 
temperatures, 25°C, 60°C and 98°C, and at pressures up to 200 
atmospheres. (Table I). 

The experimental procedure followed in determining the 
values of PY/PpVp for pressures above one atmosphere has been 
described in detail previously* 

In all tabled values of this ratio, PpVp is the pressure 
volume product at one atmosphere and 25°C, i.e. 298.1°K, unless 
otherwise shoY/n by a subscript giving another temperature. In 
order to convert these ratios into specific values of PV 
applicable to a unit mass of gas, the density or molecular 
weight of the gas must be known for some particular conditions*

A large number of density determinations were carried out 
at or near 25°C and 60 cm. of mercury pressure, in the usual 
manner employing a half litre glass flask and similar counter¬ 
poise. The average value obtained from some fifty determina¬ 
tions was 6.535 x 10 “^ gr/ccrn at 25°C and 60 cm. of mercury 
pressure. The average deviation from the mean v/as 0.5/C, a 
deviation much greater than was expected. In spite of many 
efforts to find the trouble, the deviation is still inexpli¬ 
cable, and is attributed provisionally to small variations in 
the content of the higher hydrocarbons in the gas. 

The chemical composition of the gas, as determined by 
analysis, offers another means of obtaining a specific value 
of PV. The results of analysis of the A.O.I. #2 gas, using the 
fractional distillation method already described, (See Table 6} 
give a molecular weight of 20.33 grams. The quantities of 
each component in the gas were measured at relatively low pres¬ 
sures, 30 cm. of mercury or less, and may be assumed to give 
an ideal result. Hence 20.33 grams is the true molecular 
weight. The density value given above, on the assumption of 
an ideal gas, gives a molecular weight of 20.252 grans. 

However, no comparison can be made without first considering 
the deviation from ideality of the gas at pressures below one 
atmosphere. 

There are two methods applicable to determinations of 
deviations at low pressures. Hirst, a definite mass of gas 






39 


may "be expanded at constant temperature to a succession of 
larger volumes and lower pressures. This was carried out using 
the system of measuring flasks and the precision manometer 
(Figure 11). The results showed the pressure volume product 
to vary linearly with pressure, increasing as the pressure 
decreased. This is in agreement with the results of similar 
measurements hv XeSsen and Lightfoot (8). However, the slope 
of the line, measuring the deviation, was small and showed 
variations in successive experiments comparable in magnitude 
tc the effect sought. Without a much more complex and precise 
apparatus, the experiments only show that the gas departs 
significantly from ideal behavior, at pressures below one 
atmosphere * 

The second method makes use of the plot of FV/PpVp at 
pressures above one atmosphere. As is widely recognized for 
gases relatively far removed from their critical temperature, 
FV/PpYp varies linearly with pressure up to fairly high pres¬ 
sures, in this case to 40 atm. Extrapolation of the FV/PpYj 
curve from 40 atm. through 1 atm. to zero pressure gave results 
of more precision than was possible by means of low pressure 
expansions described. The value of FT per gram at 25°C and 
60 cm. of mercury pressure, computed from the density, was 
used a.s a reference point. From the slope of the FY/PpVp vs. 

P line through this point, the value of PpVp, i.e. the pressure 
volume product at 1 atm. and 25°C, was computed to be 1207.28 com.

atm. per gram. The deviation from ideality expressed as a 
residual volume is given by:- 

a = - CFV7 p X Vi) X Pl Vi 

p ' p ° 

The higher accuracy obtained with the method, using the slope 
of the high pressure PY/P-jV-^ line resulted from the different 
magnitudes of pressure range used in the two cases. In both 
cases, volumes were measured to an accuracy of 0.05 to G.ljf 
before and after expansions. However, the pressure change, 
appearing as the divisor in the expression for slope, was about 
Q. 5 atm* in the low pressure expansions and 40 atm. in the high 
pressure expansions. The former pressure difference was meas¬ 
ured to about 1 in 1500, and the latter to 1 in 6000. Evident¬ 
ly, on this basis alone, the slope as determined from high 
pressure expansions will be relatively much more accurate. 
Moreover, since the errors in pressure also appear in the PY 
products, whose difference appears as dividend, the relative 
accuracy of the high pressure expansions is further enhanced. 
The average relative error in the two methods will differ by 
a ratio of 15 or 20 to 1. 

Using the FY/PjYp vs. P line and extrapolating to zero 
pressure, a value of 1210.78 ccm. atnu/gr. is obtained for 
P 0 Y 0 25°C. This latter value gives an ideal molecular 
weight of 201215 grams, as compared to that of 20.35 computed 
from analysis. The discrepancy is greater than can be account- 








42 


ed for. As was pointed out before, the higher hydrocarbons 
may be the source of trouble in affecting either the density 
measurements, on which the value 20*215 is based, or the gas 
analysis. An error of 0.1 in the value for pentanes plus in 
the analysis will account for the difference. However, exper¬ 
ience has not shown errors greater than 0.03 in such measure¬ 
ments. 

For practical purposes, as in engineering applications, 
the discrepancy is of no account. For the purposes of this 
thesis, the density value will be used as reference. 

In what follows all PV/PpVp ratios will use the value for 
PpVp at 25°C, i.e. 1207.28 cem. atm./gr. as a reference. 

Ratios at other temperatures will be expressed as (PV)rp/CPp^p^s* 

Turning to the values of (PV}p/(PpVp)g 5 at 60°C and 98°G, 
it is necessary to determine the specific value of PV at 
some pressure and at these temperatures. Three methods are 
available. First, the variation of pressure with temperature 
for a definite mass of gas at constant volume may be determined, 
or second.? the value of P Q V 0 25°C may be converted by the 
ideal gas law to give P 0 V 0 . at 60°C and at 98°C. Third, the 
slope of the (PV)p/(PpVi )25 line may be used in conjunction 
with the accepted value of iPpVpJgs* 

Pressure-temperature measurements were made on about 500 
ccm of the gas at approximately 1 atm. pressure over the pange 
25 to 98°C. The relat ion between P and T was very nearly 
linear. In two experiments the following data were obtained:

The value of a may be compared with the ideal value at 
20°C of 0.0034118. 

The error in the'above measurements is not significant in 
relation to density measurements * and the results can be used 
to compute densities at 60°C and 98°C or at other temperatures 
in this range from the experimental value at 25°C. However, 
the data is not precise enough for the computation of the 
deviations of the gas from ideality at pressures below 1 atm. 
Here, as previously, recourse is had to the third method with 
the second method as a check. The deviations at 60°C and 
98°C were computed from the slope of the (PV)T/CPpYp )95 lines 
below 40 atm. pressure. 'The value of the ratio at zero pres¬ 
sure and the accepted value of (PpY -^)25 gave (P 0 Y Q )The 
slope of the line, expressed as a residual volume subtracted 
from (PoYqIt* gave The values of P 0 Y 0 at 60 and 98°C 

were calculated also from the value of P 0 Y 0 at 25°C and the 
ideal gas law. This is justified by the fundamental theorem, 
that Boyle's and Charles r laws apply exactly to gases at zero 

pressure. These values of P 0 Y 0 were compared to P 0 Y 0 values 
determined as above. The values of P Q Y 0 by the two methods 






44 


agreed to better than G.l/S. The results based upon the former 
calculation are:

The values for P Q Y 0 at 60°and 98°C using the ideal gas 
laws and lihe value at 25°C are 1352.93 and 1507.28 respectively. 
The more direct experimental values tabled will be used in this 
thesis. It is for this reason that the anomalous result, a 
variation in E, is obtained. The absolute values of P 0 Y Q and 
are certainly correct to 1 ccm., and probably better, an 
accuracy within experimental error. The relative values of 
P 0 Y 0 and PpYp at any temperature, as determined by the slope 
of the PV/PpVp vs. P line, are much more accurate and their 
difference, namely r a r , is probably correct to 0.01 ccm. 

The experimental values of (FT) *%/ (PpVp )25 as a function 
of x^ressure at three temperatures are given in Table 1. A 
large scale plot of these data, Figure 12, was made and the 
best curve dravm through the experimental points. Smoothed 
values taken from this curve are given i. Table 2. Data on 
Royalite $27 gas obtained by Gillies and Hugill ( 6 ) were re¬ 
calculated using improved values of constants, 


and the better 









45 


methods developed in the present work. These data were also 
plotted, and the smoothed values for two temperatures are 
given in Table 2. 

Evidently, both natural gases are similar in their behavior, 
A.O.I* #2 gas deviating slightly more from ideality than the 
Hoi/alite #27 gas. This could be predicted of course from the 
higher content of heavy hydrocarbons in the first gas* The 
deviation of a gas from ideality may be expressed by a devia¬ 
tion factor, according to the following relation: 

= 1 + X 

?lVl 

r 1 f b^\ P 

where - deviation factor 

b r deviation factor per cm* 

This relation is justified by the linear nature of the PVyppVp 
vs. P lines below 1 atm* pressure* The deviation factors for 
three gases at 25°C are given as follows:

The course of the PV/P-^V^ curves follows that predicted 
by van aer Waals f equation of state. It is evident that the 
pressure of minimum PV/PpVp ratio follows, with changing temp¬ 
erature, a parabolic path. 

The value of PY at any pressure and temperature within 
the range of the experiments may be obtained from la.rge scale 
plots* It is only necessary to estimate the (PV)^/(P-^V ^)25

ratio and multiply by (P^Vpjgs as given previously. The values 
of V, i.e. specific volume, or its reciprocal, density, may be 
obtained in turn by computation of (PVjrp/P. 

The P-V-T relationships of these gases may be used direct¬ 
ly in computing mechanical properties, and when expressed as 
equations of state, lead to information regarding molecular 
forces and sizes, and the behavior of gas mixtures. The data 
may also be used to compute the thermodynamic properties of the 
gases, but generally only with considerable inconvenience! Even 
with an ideal gas, computation of thermal properties, excepting 
only free energy or work content, involves knowledge of such 
coefficients as dV/dT and d^/dl'S. The slopes of the curves 
such as V vs. f are very slight and accurate determination of 
the coefficients is almost impossible. Commonly, recourse is 
had to the T well known device of using the variation of a resi¬ 
dual rather than the direct quantity itself. In dealing with 
the behavior of gases, the quantity used to express their 
deviation from the ideal state is commonly the residual volume. 

This is defined as:- a = KT - V 

P 

where E is the gas constant for 1 gram of gas. 

Physically, r a* is the difference per unit mass between 
the volume the gas would occupy if ideal at the pressure concern 
ed, and the volume actually occupied by the gas. The variation 
in *a f with pressure and temperature is very much greater than 
the variation of V. It becomes relatively simple to determine,

with Pressure and Temperature.

either analytically or graphically, integrals involving ’a* 
or differential coefficients in which ! a ! is a variable. 

In Table 3 are presented the residual volumes ’a* in ccra/gr. 
for three somewhat similar gases, A.O.I. #2, Royalite #27 and 
Dominguez (22). The residual volume for Royalite #27 are those 
calculated from the corrected compressibility data for the 
gas presented in Table 2* 

To determine PV at zero pressure for the Dominguez natural 
gas, It was assumed that the specific volumes reported (22) 
were obtained from measured densities and not calculated from 
the analyses* The value of PV at zero pressure for the 60°G 
line, obtained by extrapolation of the compressibility data, 
is 1383*40 ccm.atm./gr. This may be compared to 1417.08 ccm. 
atm/gr. derived from the composition of the gas. This discrep¬ 
ancy is equivalent to an error of 0.5 grams in the molecular 
weight of the gas. 

Molecular weight from analysis 19.291 gr. 

Molecular weight from P-V-T data 19.761 gr. 

These two values agree probably within the limit of error 
of the Podbelniak method of low temperature fractionation used 
to analyse the gas* The discrepancy is greater than that found 
In the present case of A.0*1. #2 gas discussed previously. 

The residual volumes for A.O.I. #2 gas at 25°C, 60°C and 
93°C,■as a function of pressure, are shown graphically in Figure 
13. Similar curves may be obtained by plotting T a f for Royalite 
#27 and Dominquez natural gas.

Inspection of the curves of 'a 1 vs. P for a particular temper¬ 
ature shows a trend from positive values through zero to nega¬ 
tive values. The value of ! a f will become zero at the pressure 
corresponding to IP 0 V 0 )t a (PV)t • 

The course of T a f with changing pressure can he predicted 
by inspection of a suitable equation of state embodying both 
factors leading to deviations from ideality. Van der Waals' 
equation, while not of great precision, is simple and of the 
correct theoretical form. It is: 

(P + A/V 2 } (V - B) = KT 

rearranging 

KT — V = 'a' = A/PV - AB/PV 2 - B 
P 

Both A and B are small quantities and assumed, in this equation, 
to be constant. At low pressures, V is large and the term 
AB/PV 2 may be neglected. Furthermore, at low pressures the 
change in PT with pressure is small. Hence r a T becomes equal 
to the quantity A/PV - B, that is almost constant, and as 
P approaches zero, approaches a finite constant value A/P 0 V 0 - 
B. This behavior is evident in Figure 13, where f a f is constant 
within experimental error at pressures below 40 atm. Actually, 
PV varies appreciably In this range, but then A and B are not 
constants but vary with P in such a manner that the slope of 
the Pv/PpV-^ line is a constant below 40 atm. The data on ’a,* 
may be used to evaluate the functions A and B at various temper¬ 
atures and pressures. Upon expressing A and B as functions 









49 . 


of T and P, a general., but highly complex equation of the Onnes 
type results * 

As the pressure increases, and ignoring variations in A 
and B, the value of f a f given by van der Waal®' equation will 
begin to decrease. The change in the second term, AB/FV 2 is 
much greater than that in A/PV or B and ultimately* the two 
negative terms predominate, * a* becoming negative. The value 
of ’a* becomes zero at the pressure fixed by the relation: 
a A/PV = AB/PV 2 + £ 

The effect of temperature on f a f may be predicted quali¬ 
tatively by replacing PV by RT as a first approximation in the 
expression for r a T . Evidently, as the temperature is increased, 
f a r will become less positive at low pressures and become 
negative at a lower pressure. Ultimately, at sufficiently hggh 
temperatures, will be negative at the lowest pressures and 

will become increasingly so as the pressure increases! The 
variation of r a T with temperature at constant pressure may be 
used on extrapolation to give an approxims.te value of the 
temperature at v/hich r a ! = 0 at P - 0, i.e., the Boyle Point. 

.On considering the expression of the deviation from ideal 
behavior shoY/n by a real gas, in general two methods are avail¬ 
able. It is always possible, as has been indicated, to express 
the P-V-T relationships analytically as an equation of state. 

For any wide pressure range such as that used in the present 
work, such equations are complex and their applicatioh in com¬ 
puting properties of the gas is difficult. Alternatively, the

familiar and simple expressions such as the ideal gas lav/s and 
derivatives therefrom may be retained, excex^t that, in place 
of pressures, a new variable is used that gives correct results. 
Such a variable is purely empirical in nature ana defined arbi¬ 
trarily. Its j'ustification lies only in its utility. 

The second method above was first clearly proposed and 
expressed quantitatively by Lewis (15). The free energy of 
matter may be considered as a measure of the "escaping tendency". 
If the free energy of a substance is greater in one part of 
a system than in another, the substance will migrate from the 
former to the latter region. Stated generally, the require¬ 
ment for equilibrium in a system is that the free energy i.e. 
the "escaping tendency" of a component is the same in all parts 
of a phase and in all phases. In the case of a gas, pressure 
is the direct measure of free energy in that it determines the 
work content and "escaping tendency" of the gas. If the gas 
obeys the ideal law, the relation between free energy and 
pressure takes the well known form: 

F r IS In p + F 0 

where F 0 is the free energy of the gas at zero pressure 
and is a function of temperature only. 

K is the gas constant, proportional to the mass of gas 
under consideration. Hov/ever, in the case where the gas is 
not ideal, no such simple expression is available. Lewis (15) 
introduced the quantity "fugacity" as a direct measure of escap¬ 
ing tendency by means of the definition: 




53 . • 


F r KT In f + F, 


Thus, a simple equation is retained. Between two isothermal 
states: 

4F = KT In f p/f 2 2 • 

For an ideal gas: 

f = p in the same units, and for a real gas: 
f —^ p as p —^ 0 3 . 

The relation of fugaeity to pressure may he derived as

The fugacities of the gases investigated in the present work 
were computed from'equation 4*; evaluation of the integral be¬ 
ing carried out graphically on a large scale plot of T a* vs. P 
at each temperature. The values of fugaeity for three gases 
are given as f-^ in table 4, and shown graphically for the case 
of A.O.I* #2 gas in Figure 14.

The difference between fugacity and pressure, or alter¬ 
natively, the ratio f/p (the activity coefficient), ch

equation, or from the variation of T a r with pressure. Up .to

equals zero 

An estimate of the pressure at which T a T ^ ‘o~ 1.0.1. ;"2 gas at 

25°C. is 350 atm. Beyond the pressure at which T a’ becomes 
negative, both quantities decrease until at some pressure, 
f = 1 and (p - f) = 0. At this pressure', beyond the rar/ 
of experiment here, the area enclosed by positive values of T a- t , 
(Figure 13), equals the area enclosed by negative values of’a’. 
Beyond this pressure, V /f is less than 1 and (p - f) is neg¬ 
ative, i.e. fugacity is greater than pressure. In this high 
pressure range, the physical interpretation compares the gas 
to a liquid; the mean free path has no meaning, the molecules 
are in contact, and the compressibilty is that of the molecules 
themselves. In terms of van der Waals T equation, the quantity B 


predominates. 

The gases investigated are all mixtures and it is of 
interest, both theoretically and practically, to examine the 
relation between composition and pressure or fugacity. Dalton T s 
law of partial pressures will not serve to compute the pressure 
of the mixture with any precision above a few atmospheres and 


needs no consideration. The discrepancies shown by Dalton T s 
law are the same in relative magnitude as the departure of 





53 


the ratio PV/PpV^ from a constant value. These have been dis¬ 
cussed and are evident in Figure 12. Of other means of relat¬ 
ing composition and pressure, the method known as "Lewis 1 Fugacity 
Rule" (15) only, will be examined. This rule, discussed pre¬ 
viously, requires for its application a knowledge of the fuga- 
city-resssure relationships for each of the components in the 
gas mixture. The fugacity data used were taken from the liter¬ 
ature and are shown, together with the sources, in Table 5. 

These data are considered the best available and are probably 
more accurate than Lewis* Rule. However, it must be borne in 
mind that errors in measurement, and possibly impurities in 
the gas may be present to limit the accuracy of the data. 

The fugacities calculated by Lewis 1 Rule for the gases 
under investigation are given as fg in Table 4 and may be com- • 
pared with the experimental values f^. The calculated values 
for A.O.I. §2 gas are also shown graphically in Figure 14. 

Evidently there is some merit in Lewis* Fugacity Rule. 

In most practical applications involving the use of the pro¬ 
perties of a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, the fugacity as 
calculated by the rule is sufficiently exact. The use of the 
rule requires of course a knowledge of the fugacity-pressure 
relationships for each component of the mixture. This is not 
a serious disadvantage today, since the body of such informa¬ 
tion on pure gases is large and increasing. It is also true 
that in many cases the fugacity-pressure relationships of a pure

substance may be predicted from a knowledge of the same re¬ 
lationships for similar or related compounds. 

The principal use made of the fugacity-pressure relation¬ 
ships or what in practise is the same thing, the 'a* - p re¬ 
lationships, is in the calculation of thermal properties such 
as heat capacity, enthalpy, free energy, entrox^y, and Joule- 
Thomson coefficients as functions of temperature and pressure. 

These computations involve the integration of well known 
differential equations of thermodynamics, and are generally 
carried out by graphical methods using large scale plots of T a ! , 
da/dT and d^a/dT^ (4]. Preliminary steps to this end have 
been taken in connection with the gases investigated but time 
has not permitted the completion of the multiplicity of

Rgujlibrium Measurements 


The direct experimental data is presented in table 7. 

The properties of the gas and liquid phases and of the system 
at equilibrium conditions are given in Table.8. 

In the four determinations, the equilibrium cylinder was 
charged with gas and crude oil at a gas/oil ratio of 900 cu.ft., 
measured at 25°C and 76 cm. of mercury 5 per barrel, in the manner 
previously described. This was take as a representative 
gas/oil ratio of the younger wells in the Turner Valley field. 

The gas referred to is A.0.1. #2 gas as treated and stored in 
the laboratory. In expressions for gas/oil ratios given in 
Table 8, the gas referred to is the mixture containing only 
butanes and lighter hydrocarbons. The charge of gas and crude 
oil was added with an error not greater than .1$. The deter¬ 
minations were carried out at only one temperature, 98°G, which 
is somewhat higher than the bottom hole temperature of the 
Alberta Oil Incomes #2 well, as of Dec. 28, 1940. 

The experimental conditions were carefully controlled, at 
all times. Temperatures were measured using calibrated ther¬ 
mometers. The experimental data of Run #1 show some variations 
from the trend of the others. These deviations can be attri¬ 
buted probably to inexperience in the experimental technique. 

In only one determination, Run $5, were the producing conditions 
of the well proximate!. 

The liquid separated from the liquid phase sample was 
weighed to 0.01 gms., and its density determined gmvimetrically. 







56 


The volume of the gas was measured in the analytical system, 
at 35 to 60 cm* of mercury pressure and 23 to 26°C. The volume 
was reduced to 25°C and 76 cm* of* mercury, using the deviation 
facuor determined in connection with measurements on the P-V-T 
behavior of A.O.I. #2 gas itself. The slight difference in 
composition between the gas from the equilibrium system and 
A.O.I. #2 gas is of no significance in the factor. The pre¬ 
cision of the gas density measurements ano. the gas analyses has 
been discussed previously. 

The weight of the light fraction condensed from the gas 
phase was determined using a sealed tube technique, which is 
much more accurate than the method used in a previous series 
of experiments (6). From its refractive index, the molecular 
weight and density of the light fraction were calculated using 
•refractive index-molecular weight-density relationships of 
Sterling Pacific naphtha. (19). This procedure introduces some 
uncertainty in these data. Until the molecular weight, den¬ 
sity and refractive index relationship is established for the 
A.O.I. #2 oil, the data will serve as an approximation at least. 
The corresponding light fraction in the liquid phase was de¬ 
termined by fractional distillation of the liquid separated. 

The volume which had the same refractive index as the light 
fraction of the gas phase was assumed to be light fraction. 

Approximately i. ccm. of a heavier fraction was condensed 
from the gas phase sample at room temperature. This quantity 
has not been considered in the calculations because its weight 




57 


was determined only in Runs #4 and #5, and further, its origin 
is somewhat obscure. An approximate 

on Run §5 showed that the difference between the weight of the 
liquid added and the weight of liquid at equilibrium conditions 
was 13 gms. Five grams of pentane and heavier, in excess of 
that added as gas, were found in the gas phase. This amounts 
to approximately 0.8 gm. in the gas phase sample. In Run #5, 

0.39 gm of heavier fraction were found, leaving a discrepancy 
of around 0.4 grams. This would indicate that the heavy fraction 
is present as vapor in the gas phase at equilibrium, and not 
due to a mechanical defect in the procedure or equilibrium 
cylinder, leading to the entry of liquid as such to the gas 
sample pipette. A definite statement cannot be made until 
further experiments are carried out. If this heavy fraction is 
real, then the calculations of the properties of the gas phase 
are in error by more than 10^. 

In previous work in this laboratory (19) (6), naphthas 
from the limestone zone gas cap were used. This naphtha, pre¬ 
sumably present in the gas cap as vapor, showed a boiling 
range up to 150°C at atmospheric pressure. In February, 1936, 
a temperature of 70 - 75°F for this zone 7/as recorded by the 
Petroleum and Fatural Gas Conservation Board. Therein the 
present instance at 98°C it is highly probable that even higher 
boiling fractions can exist as vapor in the gas phase. 

Knowing the volume of the equilibrium cylinder ana the 
molecular weights of the condensates, the total number of mols 








58 


in the system was calculated. From the gas analyses, which 
within experimental error gives mol per cent, the mol fractions 
of the lighter components were determined* These are present¬ 
ed in Table 8. The distribution of the lighter components is 
given by the equilibrium constants ICp - K c . The equilibrium 
constant is the ratio of the mol fraction of a component in the 
gas phase, to the mol fraction of the same component in the 
liquid phase. In the case of ideal gaseous and liquid solu¬ 
tions, these constants are independent of pressure and vary for 
a particular component with temperature only. In the case of 
methane plus nitrogen, and ethane, the equilibrium constants 
decrease with increase in pressure, as is customary in such 
systems. The change in the constant is explicable on con¬ 
sideration of the changing composition of the gas and the liquid 
phase with increasing pressure. 

The equilibrium constants Kg, K 4 and K c show no such re¬ 
gular trend, and are, within the limit of error, relatively 
much more constant. This suggests that in the pressure range 
used, the system goes through the region where the phenomenon 
of retrograde condensation becomes apparent for the lighter 
hydrocarbons * If this is so, a true picture of the phase 
equilibrium will not be obtained, until experiments at inter¬ 
mediate pressures have been carried out. 

From analysis of the phase samples, and determination of 
phase volumes, the phase densities and masses were calculated. 
Except for Run #1 the liquid phase density decreases with in-

creased pressure. This is due to solution of lighter compon¬ 
ents from the gas phase in the liquid phase, and transfer of 
pentanes and higher from the liquid phase to the gas phase as 
predicted "by Poynting T s equation. 

The increase in density of the gas phase with pressure is 
a combination of three factors. First, the normal increase 
in density of the gas with pressure. Second, the solution 
of butanes and propanes in the liquid phase, reducing the 
density, and third, the transfer of pentanes and higher hydro¬ 
carbons from the liquid phase to the gas phase. The first and 
third of these predominate. 

The increased transfer of pentanes and higher hydrocarbons 
to the gas phase with pressure is shown in the derived data 
for the gas phase in Table 8. The compressibility of the gas 
phase is given by the ratio Xp/(Vp)g i.e. the ratio of the 
volume of the expanded phase at 25°C and 1 atm., to the volume 
of the phase under equilibrium conditions. Per unit volume 
of gas phase space, the content of pentanes plus increases with 
pressure. This is shown by the vapor content expressed as 
mols or gallons of condensible liquid in the ratios ULO/ (Vp)g 
and GO/(.Fp]g. However, the reverse is true in the case of the 
expanded phase, i.e. the content of condensible liquid per 
unit volume of expanded gas decreases with increasing pressure. 
This is shown in the gallons of oil per 1000 cu.ft. of expanded 
phase at ordinary conditions given as GO/Xp in Table. 8. This 
is in contrast to the behavior of simple systems (9) and of

complex systems (6) using more volatile liquid materials. It 
may be concluded that the effect of pressure on the vapor 
pressures of the less volatile hydrocarbons in A.O.I. #2 oil 
is too small to produce the phenomenon of retrograde conden¬ 
sation at the pressures used here. 

The value of the data on the gas phase, in aj^plication 
to the field, lies principally in computation of the material 
content of any gas cap in the prod'; cing zone. The ratio, 
Xp/(Vpjg expresses the total quantity cl material as gas, 
measured at ordinary conditions, contained in unit volume 
of free space in the producing formation. Given the porosity 
of the formation, it is possible fro., such data to compute the 
displacement in a formation yielding only gas. It should be 
pointed out that this does not imply that there is gas phase 
in the limestone zone feeding A.O.I. #2 well. 

Turning to the data on the liquid phase, the results 
are Interesting in suggesting that the A.O.I. #2 well was fed, 
at the time of sampling, by materla.,1 substantially liquid. At 
a pressure of 158*6 atm. and at 98°C, the gas/oil ratio, 
Fg/bbl., was found in this work to be 595.3 cu.ft. of butanes 
and lighter gases at 20°G and 1 atm. per bbl. of oil. This 
ratio will increase, roughly, proportionally to the pressure. 
The well was operating at the time of sampling at a gas/oil 
ratio of 700 cu.ft./bbl, a value that will be reduced somewhat 
by taking into account the pentanes plus content of the gas. 
The last measurement of bottom hole temperature and pressure, 






61 . 


20 days previous to sampling, showed 92.2°C and' 188 atm. 

Under these conditions, assuming equilibrium, the experi¬ 
ments show beyond doubt that a single liquid phase, possibly 
unsaturated,can account for the performance of the well. 

Time has not permitted further experiments over a range 
of temperatures and other pressures* Until such work has been 
carried out, the conditions in the formation cannot be stated 
with certainty. Further, this additional information is necess 
ary before estimates of the material content of the formation 
can be made. The values of density and compositior given in 
Table 8 were obtained under conditions too far removed from 
actual well conditions to warrant extrapolation. 

Finally, the significance of the ratio, (Vp)g/(Vp)l, a 
property of the system as a whole, should be pointed out. 

This ratio, the volume of the gas phase/the volume of the 
liquid phase, in situ, decreases regularly with increasing- 
pressure. Though the gas/oil ratio of the system as a whole 
is constant, the total mass increases Virith pressure. As the 
pressure approaches the vaJLue at which the solubility of the ga 
in the oil becomes equal to 900 cu.ft./bbl. the ratio (Vp)g/ 
(Vpil approaches zero. In other words, no gas phase can exist 
in the equilibrium system. It is possible that, given suffi¬ 
cient data,at other temperatures and pressures, the variation 
of this ratio may be used to determine most directly the phase 
conditions in the producing formation. It appears probable 
that if the system were put together at a gas/oil ratio of 
700 cu.ft./bbl* and 92*2°C at a mass/volume ratio required

pipette would yield a liquid sample identical with the sample 
from the liquid phase pipette.

SUMA-lRY 

The P-V-T relationships of Alherta oil Incomes #2 gas 
have "been studied at three temperatures, 25°C, 60°C and 98°C, 
over a pressure range from 15 cm. of mercury to 3000 p.s.i. The 
residual volumes and fugacities for this gas, and for two other 
natural gases, have "been calculated. The fugacities of the 
three gases at 25°C and 60°C have been coniTjared with the fugaci¬ 
ties predicted Tiy Lewis r fugacity rule. 

A new apparatus for studying phase equilibrium in hydro¬ 
carbon systems has been described. The results of four equili- 
briurn determinations have been presented. Various properties 
of both the liquid and the gas phases have been derived from 
the experimental data, and the nature of future work has been 
indicated. 

A description of a portable apparatus for the analysis of 
hydrocarbon gases, has been given in Apendix I.

Appendix I 
Gas Analysis 

Introduction 

A new method of analysis of hydrocarbon gas mixtures, by 
fractional distillation at low temperatures, and low pressures,, 
has been fully, described by Gillies and Hugill (6). The method 
was throughly tested by them. The best operating conditions 
for the fractionation column, were determined by analysis of 
known mixtures of hydrocarbon gases. 

The analysis apparatus, as used by Gillies and Hugill, is 
a part of the main analytical apparatus, described previously 
in this thesis. Since this equipment embodies only one precision 
manometer and one Toepler pump, gas analyses, and pressure 
volume expansion measurements, may not be carried on at the 
same time. 

In this appendix, a new portable, gas analysis apparatus 
will be described. Because of its compactness, ana ease of 
operation, the new equipment presents a number of advantages, 
over the other apparatus. 

A complete review of the literature, concerning low 
temperature fractionation, has been given by Gillies and Hugill, 
together with theoretical considerations. Ho further comments 
will be added here.

in Figure 16* The whole assembly is mounted on a wooden plat¬ 
form on casters, which enables it to be moved to any part of 
the laboratory* The apparatus may be levelled as a unit, by 
means of long bolts, through the platform. 

The apparatus is essentially composed of two separate 
units, one for low temperature fractionations, and the other 
for combustion analyses. A sample of gas for combustion analy¬ 
sis may be taken directly from the Toepler pump to the com¬ 
bustion analysis burette. This is an advantage over the origin¬ 
al analysis apparatus. The Toepler pump is operated in a 
manner to keep vibration in the apparatus at a minimum. The 
mercury in the reservoir is displaced by water, under mains 
pressure. Combustion analyses were formerly carried out on 
a separate Improved Bureau of Mines Orsat Apparatus. 

Experience with the first fractionation column gave rise to 
improvements in the one made for the portable apparatus. The 
general design, as described by Gillies and Hugill, is unchang¬ 
ed. The column is about 1 inch shorter. Monel inlet and out¬ 
let tubes, are substituted for copper, to decrease the heat 
losses from the top of the column, to the atmosphere. It 
was found that only four thermocouples were necessary, to give 
a complete picture of the temperature gradient in the column. 

The middle thermocouple of the old column was dispensed with. 

The column is supported by means of the Monel tubes, from a 
circular top plate of tempered Masonite, on which is mounted 
a terminal plate for the thermo couple and heater leads.

Operation 

Preliminary to carrying out an analysis, the whole fraction 
at ion unit (Figure 16) was evacuated by means of the Toepler 
pump P and the mercury diffusion pump C. With stopcock 10 
closed, the gas was discharged to atmosphere through stopcocks 
5 and 9. The fractionation column A and trai) B were then 
isolated by closing stopcocks 1, 3, and 4. Liquid air in 
Dewar flasks was brought up around the column and the trap. 

The level of the liquid air in the Dewar flask surrounding the 
column was approximately that of the top of the lower column 
heater. With stopcock 8 closed, the gas sample from the sample 
pipette, D, was admitted to the calibrated sample burette G, 
through t£e Toepler pump, the diffusion pump, and stopcocks 
2, 5, 6 and 7. The mercury level in the sample burette was 
lowered to the calibration mark, by means of the levelling 
bulb. The pressure of the gas sample was measured by the 
constant volume manometer, E, and tap 7 was closed. By open¬ 
ing stopcocks 8 and 3, and reversing stopcock 5, the system 
was again evaluated. When the temperature gradient of the 
column had reached the required level, the gas was allowed to 
enter the column, slowly, from the sample burette. The gas 
bubbled through a small slug of mercury in the line, which 
indicated the rate qualitatively. Experience showed that the 
gas must be admitted slowly to procure good fractionation in 
the column. Trap B, was opened to the McLeod gage through 









67 


stopcock 4. Stopcock 1 was slightly opened to admit the- methane 
fraction to the trap B. The pressure was equalized by slight¬ 
ly opening stopcock 3 to the diffusion pump and the Toepler pump. 
Stopcocks 1 and 3 were then fully opened, and the methane 
fraction pumped over to the fraction receiver F through stop¬ 
cocks 5 and 6, until the pressure in the trap was 1 mm. The 
diffusion pump was operated, until the pressure remained 
steady at 0.25 mm. 

The amount of the methane fraction was measured by means 
of the constant volume manometer E. Stopcock 4 was then closed, 
and stopcock 5 opened, and the methane fraction pumped over to 
the burette of the combustion analysis apparatus through stop¬ 
cock 10. 

When the system was evacuated, stopcocks 3 and 8 were 
closed, and stopcock 5, reversed. The column was directly 
connected to the McLeod gage, by opening stopcock 4. Stop¬ 
cock 1 was opened. The temperature along the fractionation 
column A was adjusted for ethane, and the ethane fraction 
allowed to distil over into the trap B. When the McLeod gage 
showed a pressure of 0.1 mm. or less, for three successive 
readings with stopcock 1 closed, distillation was discontinued. 
Stopcock 4 was reversed, and stopcock 3 opened to the diffu¬ 
sion pump. The Dewar flask around the trap B was removed, and 
the ethane fraction pumped over to the fraction receiver F, and 
measured by the manometer E.

The same procedure was repeated for each of the other 
constituents of the gas with the correct temperature distri¬ 
bution in the column* To take off the last fraction, 
es the c 

The amount of nitrogen in the methane fraction, was deter¬ 
mined by the standard slow combustion method, using the com¬ 
bustion analysis unit* Oxygen from a cylinder was admitted . 
at ff. For the combustion analysis of the methane-nitrogen 
fraction from the older analytical apparatus, the sample was 
admitted at K from a sample tube D* 

liscu ssion 

The procedure described above, is essentially that used 
with the older analytical apparatus. The cutting temperatures 
aigd pressures are those which were used by Gillies and Hugill. 
Analyses were calculated on the basis of the sum of the volumes 
of all the fractions taken off. The volume per cent was obtain¬ 
ed by dividing the volume of each component by the sum of the 
separate volumes. 

With this new apparatus, gas analyses may be done, while 
pressure-volume v^rork is carried out. on the main apparatus. 

Since the new apparatus is portable, it may be set up conven¬ 
iently anywhere in the laboratory. 

Summarizing the performance of this new equipment, the 
time required for analysis is roughly 2i hours. The liquid 
air consumption is roughly 5 lbs. for each analysis. The 










































69 . 


accuracy of the results is very good, duplicate analyses 
agreeing to within 0.1# for the major constituents methane, 
ethane, and to 0.03# for propane, butane and pentane.
