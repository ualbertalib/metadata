ABSTRACT 


A project has been outlined in which bone 
marrow cultures are proposed as a biological assa}? - material 
for the detection of a possible circulating erythropoietic 
inhibitor produced by malignant cells© An erythropoietic 
inhibitor has been postulated as one of the causes of 
anemia frequently associated with cancer. 

A review of the incidence and causes of 
anemia in cancerous patients and in tumor-bearing 
animals has been presented. The various methods of bone 
marrow culture have also been reviewed. The technique 
of Osgood and Brownlee was chosen because of its relative 
simplicity and good physiological conditions. 

The present day concepts of erythropoiesis 
have been summarized© 

The technique of the above method as used and 
the results of 101 separate bone marrow cultures are 
presented. It is concluded that short term (6 hours) 
cultures are suitable for this project and that a culture 
medium of Gey’s fluid fortified with homologous serum 
offers satisfactory growth. 

Suggestions are offered for improving the 
growth responses in cultures, based upon experience 'and 
information obtained in the past year.

SECTION I 


INTRODUCTION 

Anemia has been widely recognized by 
clinicians as a frequent concomitant of malignancy. In 
some cases this anemia is readily accounted for by such 
obvious causes as blood loss, dietary deficiency, or 
replacement of hemopoietic bone marrow by metastases. 

In other cases where there is no explanation for the 
anemia, the presence of an erythropoietic inhibitor 
released by malignant cells has been postulated. 

The formation of such an inhibitor substance 
by malignant cells might be expected to result in its 
presence in the blood stream. It would thus have ready

. 





access to the bone marrow where it might exert its 
inhibitory influence which would then account for the 
anemia* Conversely, the development of anemia in 
experimental animals exposed to extracts of blood or 
urine (presuming that the inhibitor might be excreted 
in the urine) from cancerous patients would indicate 
the presence of such a substance* Alternatively, bone 
marrow cultures might be exposed to extracts of blood or 
urine from cancerous patients, and their hemopoietic 
influences compared with those of similar extracts from 
normal individuals* 

It is a primary purpose of this project 
to investigate by the simplest possible means the 
possibility of an erythropoietic inhibitor* The com¬ 
plexity of the field of hemopoiesis makes it essential 
that this study be purposefully restricted in its tech¬ 
nical scope. If a relatively simple and rapid method 
for the detection of an inhibitor could be developed, it 
would have immediate practical application in the diagnosis 
of malignancy, A complicated or prolonged procedure would 
make such application impracticable. Therefore even if 
an w in vivo” means should detect an inhibitor, the time 
lapse involved would reduce the practical value of the 
procedure as a diagnostic aid* The first plan mentioned 
above was therefore rejected. 

Even in considering the second alternative, 
that of bone marrow cultures, difficulties were foreseen.

There are many methods of bone marrow culture which could 
be used and each would have to be evaluated in order that 
the one most suitable for the problem would be chosen. 

The techniques and methods of culturing bone marrow cells 
are not widely used and delay would result in learning 
and standardizing the technique of the chosen method. 
Errors in the cell counts used to determine the amount 
of growth would have to be determined so that the reli¬ 
ability of the method as a whole could be known. However, 
once these preliminary problems had been solved, the 
cultures, because of their rapid growth, should provide 
a quick means of determining the presence of an inhibitor 
if they are sensitive enough. 

The project which was set up, therefore, 
proposed the use of bone marrow cultures as the biological 
assay method to attempt to prove the presence of an 
erythropoietic inhibitor released by malignant cells. 

The first phase of the project thus involved the deter¬ 
mination of the accuracy of the cell counts used in 
following the growth in the cultures. The second phase, 
and the one with which this thesis will be largely con¬ 
cerned, was the culturing of bone marrow cells themselves 
in order that the technique might be learned and standard¬ 
ized. The third phase of the project deals with the 
testing of various extracts of urine and serum from 
patients with malignant disease for their effect on 
these cultures.

SECTION II 


REVIEW OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE 

A. Anemia in Cancerous Patients 

1, Occurrence and Incidence of this Anemia 

For many years clinicians have reported 
a frequent association of anemia with malignancy* 

Ewing (52) referred to the work of Louis in I &46 as 
showing that there is a diminished quantity of blood in 
malignancy. In lg&6 Eichhorst (42) stated with respect 
to cancer of the stomach, "The blood is often very 
pale, almost serous, and poor in red blood-globules." 

In reference to cancer of the liver (43) he stated, 

"On examination of the blood, it is often found that 
the red blood-globules are scanty, very pale and present

striking variations in size and shape (poikilocytosis) 
Osier (9$), Gibson (57), and Allbutt (3) in their 
respective textbooks mentioned anemia as one of the 
signs of cancer of the stomach* Osier called it a pro¬ 
gressive anemia and while admitting that it sometimes 
resembles pernicious anemia he observed that it more 
frequently has the characteristics of a secondary anemia. 
Gibson (5&) noticed anemia in patients with pancreatic 
malignancy. In speaking of cancer of the esophagus 
Allbutt and Rolleston (4) stated that the apparent anemia 
seen in the patient is masked on examination of the blood 
by hemoconcentration. 

More recently, Ewing (51) found a deter¬ 
ioration in both quality and quantity of blood in the 
course of malignant disease. He also noticed that the 
reduction of hemoglobin exceeds the reduction in the 
number of cells. Haden (67) observed that malignant 
disease is almost constantly accompanied by anemia. 

Clark et al (29) referred to a statement of Krache in 
which he said that anemia could be produced by any 
type of malignancy. Many other authors refer to the 
association between anemia and cancer. Indeed it has 
been said that a diligent search for cancer should be 
made in any person of middle age who has an unexplained 
anemia (Schwertman, 114; Cecil, 2£; Brown et al, 20). 

In 192$ Eisen ( 46 ) made a review of 353 
cases of malignancy in many organs and found the red

cell count averaged 3,569,000, the hemoglobin 62%, and 
the color index 0.3&* Morrison in 1932 (79) reviewed 
100 cases of cancer in various organs and noted that 
43% had a hemoglobin of 50% or below, 25% had hemoglobins 
between 51% and 64 % and only 32% had hemoglobins of 65 % 
or above* In 13% of the cases the red count was below 
3,000,000, in 64% between 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 and 
in only 23% above 5,000,000* He concluded that in 
malignancy the reduction in erythrocytes is preceded by 
a reduction in the hemoglobin and depending on the 
balance of the two, the color index may be high or low* 

In 1947 Clark et al (29) analysed 3$ patients with 
malignant disease from the standpoint of blood volume 
and chronic shock* They concluded that the major factor 
responsible for the reduced blood volume associated 
with malignant disease is a deficiency of the total 
circulating cell mass and hemoglobin* Schwertman (114) 
examined 53 cases of carcinoma in 8 different organs 
in 1943 and found anemia, chiefly of the hypochromic 
type, bo be present in all. In contrast to this, 

Bateman (12) in 1951 found the blood volume in 33 patients 
with cancer to be variable in malignant disease but he 
did report an associated anemia. Shen and Homberger 
(115) in 1951 studied 193 cases of advanced cancer 
and found that 60.1% had a hemoglobin below £0%. 

Totterman (125) makes mention of 14 cases of cancer in 









- 7 - 


different sites uncomplicated by hemorrhage or infection 
in which the average hemoglobin was 70*4%. 

2. Degree of Anemia in Cancer in Different Locations 

Eisen (44) reported 16 cases of cancer in 
the oro-pharyngeal cavity in which the hemoglobin 
averaged 73$ and the red cells 3,331,000. In the same 
report he also lists 13 cases of cancer of the esophagus 
with an average hemoglobin of 61$ and average red cell 
count of 3,731,000. Master (77) reports a much higher 
average hemoglobin level and red cell count in 15 cases 
of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, namely, 

93$ and 5,040,000. However, in 3 cases of adenocarcinoma 
of the same organ he found the hemoglobin averaged 46 $ 
and the red cell count 4,095,000. 

There seems to be a good deal more in the 
literature dealing with anemia in association with 
gastric carcinoma than with its occurrence in cancer 
in any other site. Perhaps this is because of the 
relative frequency of gastric carcinoma, blaster (77) 
reported 26 cases of carcinoma of the stomach in which 
the average hemoglobin was 53$ and the average red cell 
count 3,370,000. Eisen (44) found that the hemoglobin 
averaged 50$ and the red cell count 3,179,000 in 79 
cases that he analyzed. Morrison observed (79) a 
lower hemoglobin in 22 cases, namely, an average of 33$. 

A much higher level, however, was found by Ariel (9) 
in a series of 79 cases. Here the hemoglobin averaged 





' 









. 








70 % and the red cells 3,500,000. Oppenheim ($7) reported 
122 cases and found that 64 % had an abnormally low con¬ 
centration of hemoglobin and low red cell counts. Clark 
et al ( 29 ) examined 10 patients with carcinoma of the 
stomach or lower portion of the esophagus from the 
standpoint of blood volume, finding the red cell mass 
averaged only 50% of normal and the hemoglobin mass 
45% of normal. 

Cancer of the colon is also associated 
with a severe degree of anemia. In his series of 1$7 
patients in 1927, Eisen (44) includes 12 cases of 
cancer of the intestine, caecum and colon, in which 
the hemoglobin averaged 56% and the red cells 3,259,000. 
In 12 cases of cancer of the sigmoid colon he found an 
average hemoglobin of 63% and average red cell count of 
3,&41,000. Average levels of hemoglobin of 66% and red 
cell counts of 3,715,000 were found in 37 cases of 
rectal carcinoma. Morrison (79) reports 15 cases of 
cancer in the colon with an average hemoglobin of 50%. 
Alvarez et al (6) found anemia to be more severe in 
cancer of the caecum and ascending colon than in the 
transverse, descending and pelvic portions which showed 
a progressively more mild anemia. In $1# cases of 
cancer of the colon as a whole he found an average 
hemoglobin of 67.3%. In 4 cases reported by Clark et 
al (29) the hemoglobin averaged 47% and the red cell

mass 51% of normal. Brown et al (20) found 79% of their 
60 cases of cancer of the colon had an anemia with less 
than 13 grams per cent of hemoglobin. Ten such cases 
are included in Schwertman’s series (114) and had an 
average hemoglobin level of 10.£ grams per cent and red 
cell count of 3 , 900 , 000 . 

In 1927 Eisen (44) reported 19 cases of cancer 
in the pancreas and biliary system with an average hemo¬ 
globin level of 5&% and a mean red cell count of 3,233,000. 

In 192& ( 46 ) he reported 14 cases of biliary tract cancer 
with an average red cell count of 3,236,000 and hemoglobin 
level of 5#%* Clark et al (29) reported 6 cases of pancreatic 
carcinoma in which the hemoglobin averaged 55% and the red 
cell mass 59% of normal. 

In breast cancer the anemia reported is not as 
severe as that of the gastro-intestinal tract. Eisen ( 46 ) 
reports 52 cases in which the hemoglobin averaged 64 % and 
the red cells 3,37$,000. In the 130 cases of Alvarez et 
al (6) the average values were 74*4% and 4,410,000. In 
Morrison’s (79) 8 cases the average hemoglobin was 69 %. 

Ten cases reported by bchwertman (114) averaged 12.2 grams 
per cent hemoglobin and the mean red cell count was 4,300,000. 

The degree of anemia in pulmonary cancer seems 
to be of about the same magnitude as that in breast cancer. 
Morrison (75) reports 15 cases with an average hemoglobin 
of 67%. An average of 74% hemoglobin with an average red 
cell count of 4,013,000 was found in 24 cases reported by 











■

Eisen (46). Clark et al (29) found the red cell mass to 
be, on the average, 70% of normal and the hemoglobin 65 % 
in ten cases of lung cancer. 

In malignant disease of the kidney the anemia 
is also quite severe. Twelve cases of Eisen f s ( 46 ) had an 
average hemoglobin of 64 % and a mean red cell count of 
3,730,000. In four cases reported by Schwertman (114), 
the average hemoglobin was found to be 11.7 grams per cent 
and the average red cell count to be 4,500,000. 

Of the above writers, Schwertman (114) is the 
only one reporting cases of bladder cancer. He found in 
five such cases that the average hemoglobin was 11.7 grams 
per cent and the red cells averaged 4,110,000. 

Commons and Strauss (31) reported three cases 
of prostatic carcinoma with associated skeletal metastases. 
The hemoglobin in these cases averaged 6.5 grams per cent 
and the red cells 2,400,000. Schwertman (114) reported 
ten cases and in these the values were 12,9 grams per cent 
and 4,390,000. 

Schwertman (114) observed a mean hemoglobin 
of 11.1 grams per cent and red cell count of 4,001,000 in 
four cases of malignant disease of the ovary. Eisen ( 46 ) 
found the values to be 69 % hemoglobin and 3,673,000 
respectively in 13 cases included in his series. 

Carcinoma of the uterus, cervix or body, is 
one of the commonest of malignancies seen, and here too, 
the associated anemia is quite severe. Eisen ( 46 )

reported 15 cases with a mean red cell count of 3,175,000 
and an average hemoglobin of 59 %• Schwertman (114) in 
eight cases of cancer of the body found these values to 
be 4,150,000 and 11.5 grams per cent respectively. Alvarez 
et al (6) divided his cases into four groups. Fifty-five 
cases of cancer of the fundus without hemorrhage averaged 
79 * 9 % hemoglobin and 27 cases with hemorrhage averaged 61.3%. 
In 26 cases of cervical cancer without hemorrhage the hemo¬ 
globin average was 79.2% and in 29 cases with hemorrhage 
it was reduced to 64 . 5 %. 


3. Causes of Anemia in Cancer 
a. Hemorrhage 

Hemorrhage is one of the most obvious factors 
in the production of anemia in cancer. Cecil (27) and 
Schwertman (114) named this as one of the causes of this 
secondary anemia. Eisen (41, 42, 43) showed that the most 
severe anemia is associated with cases of malignancy where 
hemorrhage is a prominent feature, such as in lesions of 
the gastro-intestinal tract. Isaacs (70) attributed the 
anemia that occurs with malignancy to bleeding before any 
other cause. Shen and Homburger (115) attributed the anemia 
in 23.5% of their 193 cases to blood loss alone. Alvarsez 
et al (6) found the hemoglobin levels to be the lowest with 
those malignant tumors which had a large ulcerated area 























- 12 


from which blood could ooze. In other words, he judged 
that hemorrhage was a significant cause of anemia in 
patients with cancer and he supported this view by 
comparing cancer in the right and left colons. He found 
the anemia to be more profound with cancers of the right 
colon which tend to bleed more because of the larger area 
of their tumors as compared with those in the left colon. 

He also compared 55 cases of cancer of the fundus uteri 
with hemorrhage to 27 similar cases but without hemorrhage. 
These two groups had average hemoglobin levels of 74*9% 
and 61 . 8 % respectively. In comparing 26 cases of cancer 
of the cervix uteri without hemorrhage to 20 such cases 
with hemorrhage the average hemoglobin levels were 79*2% 
and 64.5% respectively. 

In contrast to the above, Ariel et al (9) 
could find very little correlation in their series between 
hypoproteinemia and anemia and the incidence of dietary 
intake or chronic hemorrhage. 

Loss of blood could occur as chronic oozing 
from an ulcerated surface of a cancerous growth or it 
could take the form of an acute and perhaps massive 
hemorrhage as would occur in the erosion of an artery 
by a malignant process. But whichever form it takes, one 
would judge from the literature that it plays an important 
part in the production of this secondary anemia.

b. Bone marrow metastases 

Cancers of the prostate, kidney, breast, 
lung and thyroid have a propensity for metastasizing to 
the bone marrow* This replacement of the bone marrow 
(usually the hemopoietic part, Rundles and Jonsson, (112) ) 
has been given as one of the causes of anemia secondary 
to cancer* Isaacs (70), Haden (6&), and Rundles and 
Jonsson(112) were of the opinion that bone marrow metas¬ 
tases play an important part in making the cancerous 
patient anemic* Vaughan (126,127), Thompson and Xllyne 
(124), Mettier (7&), Commons and Strauss (31) and Pisciotta 
(102) all described an anemia associated with bone marrow 
metastases in which the prominent features are a decrease 
in the number of red cells and the appearance in the 
peripheral blood of a large number of immature forms, 
both of erythroid and myeloid series* This anemia which 
they described is most frequently called, among other 
names, myelophthisic or leuco-erythroblastic anemia and 
is most commonly associated with skeletal metastases in 
carcinoma of the prostate. 

In contrast to the above, Weisberger and 
Heinle (132) could find no correlation between the occurrence 
of anemia and the activity of the bone marrow. Morrison 
(79) found that the anemia in his series did not necessarily 
depend on metastases. Schwertman (114) states, w In some 
cases, even in the presence of metastases, anemia does not 







- 14 - 


occur. w Shen and Homburger (115) concluded that anemia 
associated with cancer is not usually due to bone marrow 
replacement by neoplastic tissue. Vaughan (126, 12$) 
observed that the anemia is not dependent upon mechanical 
blocking of the marrow but likens the anemia to pernicious 
anemia and suggests that it is caused by a deficiency of a 
factor or factors necessary for normal hemopoiesis. 

Although there is much disagreement in the 
observations of the above writers the weight of opinion 
seems to warrant the view that, when they occur, metastases 
to bone marrow do in many cases contribute to the anemia 
secondary to cancer. 


c. Dietary intake, digestion and absorption 

Cancerous patients are often apathetic and 
as a consequence do not eat properly. In these patients, 
the possibility of anemia as a result of malnutrition 
must not be overlooked. Bateman (12) includes this 
factor in the causes of anemia in three of his patients. 

To this cause Eisen (45) also attributes some of the anemia 
seen in his patients. 

Patients with malignant lesions of the oro¬ 
pharyngeal cavity or esophagus might suffer from anemia 
because of their discomfort in eating, and consequently 
an insufficient dietary intake.

Gastric achylia and obstruction in the 
gastro-intestinal tract are named by Eisen (44, 46} as 
two additional factors that must be considered. Gastric 
achylia would interfere with digestion, and obstruction 
would interfere with both digestion and absorption* 
However, Ariel (9) measured the nitrogen in the feces 
of 10 patients with gastric cancer and concluded that 
cancer did not interfere with digestion or absorption of 
proteins. 

Totterman (125) found a low serum iron in 
a number of cancerous patients investigated and listed 
it as an etiological factor in the associated anemia. 

This low serum iron presumably results from an intake 
which is insufficient to meet the demands. Ariel (9) 
however, found that the long continued administration of 
large amounts of ferrous salts and liver concentrates 
did not significantly alter the blood picture in patients 
with gastric cancer. 

d. Hepatic insufficiency and defective protein 
metabolism 

An adequately functioning liver is necessary 
for the fabrication of proteins used in the synthesis of 
hemoglobin. Therefore, hepatic insufficiency resulting 
from secondary growths in the liver or its depression as

a whole by toxic substances possibly produced by 
malignant cells could cause anemia. This factor has 
been mentioned by Oppenheim ($7) in his series of cases 
of carcinoma of the gastro-intestinal tract. However, 
it must be remembered that the liver has a great reserve 
and metastases in it have to be extensive before any 
insufficiency is manifested. Ariel (9) suggested that the 
hypoproteinemia and anemia in gastric cancer were caused 
by defective fabrication of proteins. 


e. Hemolysis 

Intravascular hemolysis as a result of the 
release of a hemolysin by malignant cells has been 
postulated as another mechanism in the production of anemia 
secondary to cancer. Stats et al (120) note that metas¬ 
tatic carcinoma can cause a hemolytic anemia and Isaacs 
(70) speaks of a hemolytic anemia classically found in 
cancer of the stomach and liver but doesn T t report any 
cases. Shen and Homberger (115) attribute to hemolysis 
the anemia seen in 2.6 % of their 193 cases of cancer 
in various organs. Waugh (131) reports 2 cases of hemo¬ 
lytic anemia associated with carcinoma. Singer and 
Dameshek (116) list carcinoma as a cause of hemolytic 
anemia and report one case of dermoid cyst of the ovary. 
Allibone and Collins (5) report one case in which the

hemolytic process was arrested following excision of 
a cystic teratoma of the right ovary. (Note: The 
spleen was not excised.) However, in this case they 
could not demonstrate any hemolysins or atypical 
agglutinins. 

Eisen ( 46 ) judged hemolysis as not being 
significant in the cases he reported. 

The above instances do not make up a large 
proportion of the malignancies encountered and it would 
seem that hemolysis is of little significance in the 
majority of malignant diseases. 


f. Intoxication from necrosis and infection of 
malignant neoplasms 

There is the possibility that degeneration 
or toxic products from necrotic or infected parts of 
neoplasms could cause anemia by a toxic effect on the 
liver (with the resultant defective fabrication of 
proteins as mentioned previously) or on erythropoietic 
tissue, as well as being the cause of intravascular 
hemolysis. Eisen (44, 46) observed that adenocarcinoma 
with its greater tendency to ulceration and infection 
was associated with a greater degree of anemia than 
scirrhous, colloid or simple carcinoma. Schwertman 
(114) too, noticed that anemia is more marked in cancer

of those organs which are more susceptible to ulceration 
and necrosis. Totterman (125) included secondary infection 
as one of the causes of anemia in cancer. In speaking of 
carcinomas of the colon, Alvarez et al (6) found a definite 
relation between the size of tumors removed at operation 
and the degree of anemia. Thus he concluded, "The essential 
factor in the production of the anemia seems to be in the 
presence of a large ulcerated area from which blood can 
ooze and through which bacteria can enter." Evidently, 
he was of the opinion that secondary infection contributed 
to the production of the anemia. 


g. Specific erythropoietic inhibitor produced by 
malignant cells 

An anemia frequently exists in conjunction 
with malignant disease which cannot be explained on the 
basis of any of the above causes. Eisen ( 46 ) makes the 
statement that sometimes the anemia seen in patients with 
malignant disease is out of proportion to the actual 
lesion. Totterman (126) makes mention of an anemia 
"caused by the malignant neoplasm as such » true cancer 
anemia." Many of the 130 cases of non-ulcerating cancer 
of the breast reported by Alvarez et al (6) would perhaps 
fall into this group as well as some of his cases of 
cancer of the fundus uteri and cervix uteri uncomplicated 
by hemorrhage.

Clark et al (29) speak of a fundamental 
disturbance in hemoglobin metabolism in malignancy. 

They also refer to a statement of Krache’s in which he 
suggests that the malignant process either elaborates 
a product capable of bone marrow inhibition or utilizes 
substances necessary for red cell production. Haden 
(65, 66) cites two case reports of gastric carcinoma in 
which he explains the associated anemia on the basis of 
a depression of the bone marrow in one case and of toxic 
interference with the synthesis of hemoglobin in the 
other. Morrison (79), Schwertman (114), and Shen and 
Homberger (115) have all postulated the production of 
a toxic substance by malignant cells which depresses the 
bone marrow. Morrison calls it a carcinomatoxin. Such 
a substance by inhibiting the bone marrow could explain 
the anemia seen in cancerous patients which cannot be 
accounted for by any of the above causes. 


B. Anemia and Lowered Liver Catalase in Experimental 
Animals with Tumors. 

1. Occurrence of Anemia 

Paralleling the occurrence of anemia in 
patients with cancer, workers with experimental animals 
have noticed the occurrence of anemia in those with 
tumors. It is realized that caution must be exercised

in the interpretation of results in experimental animals 
and in its application to humans, but it is felt that 
the results in experimental animals in this respect 
closely parallel the same phenomenon in humans and 
therefore should be noted* 

In a review article in 1943, Greenstein (62) 
noted that a decrease in the hemoglobin level was one 
of the marked systemic effects in animals of tumors in 
general. Dickinson and Begg (34) observed a significant 
degree of anemia in rats with benign tumors* They also 
observed (14) anemia in force-fed rats bearing tumors. 

An anemia in mice and rats bearing tumors was reported 
by Blumenthal (19)* However, he noticed that the anemia 
did not become pronounced until the tumors were large and 
the animals were markedly cachectic. Pearce and Casey 
(99) found a decreased red cell count and a lowered hemo¬ 
globin in rabbits when the tumor process became pronounced. 
In working with embryonic chicks inoculated with mammary 
mice carcinomas, Taylor, McAfee and Taylor (123) reported 
that hemoglobin levels were depressed by as much as 70$ 
by the eighteenth day. 

Taylor and Pollack (122) administered 
methylcholanthrene to mice and butter yellow to rats. 

They found that the hemoglobin was depressed in the 
resulting precancerous conditions and that it became more 










'• 




3 . 












































marked when tumors appeared* Somewhat related to this 
are the findings of Strong (121)* He reported an early 
precocious drop in the hemoglobin level in cancer-sus¬ 
ceptible strains of mice but clearly differentiates it 
from the anemia secondary to malignancy. Davis too (33), 
reported a lower hemoglobin, red cell count and red cell 
volume in tumor strain mice as compared to non-tumor 
strain mice* 

2* Mechanism of Production of the Anemia 

Cliffton and Wolstenholme (30), Sobel and 
Furth (119), Furth and Sobel (54), and Furth and Moshman 
(55) noted an overall increase in blood volume in their 
tumor-bearing mice* If the plasma volume increased more 
than the cell volume the anemia described above by 
various workers might only be apparent instead of real. 

On the other hand, Taylor, McAfee and Taylor 
(123) suggested that a substance might be produced by 
the tumor cells and when released into the blood stream 
would have some inhibiting influence on the concentration 
of hemoglobin in the blood. Armstrong and Ham (11) 
thought that the anemia may be due to some agent associated 
with the tumor rather than the production of some substance 
by the tumor cells themselves. 

Both of these last two postulates parallel 
closely the theory of an erythropoietic inhibitor produced 
by malignant cells described above in relation to anemia 
in cancerous patients and serve to reinforce it.

3* Association of Anemia and Lowered Liver Catalase 
Activity in Tumor-Bearing Animals 

Greenstein (62) noticed that the two most 
marked systemic reactions in tumor-bearing animals are 
a decrease in liver catalase activity and a decrease in 
the hemoglobin. These two substances are both conjugated 
proteins, and the hematoporphyrin prosthetic group is 
common to both. On the basis of this fact Greenstein 
reasoned that an interference with the synthesis of the 
hematoporphyrin group by some mechanism could explain 
both the anemia and the lowered liver catalase activity. 
Appleman et al (7, £), Bounce and Shanewise (36), Begg (13), 
and Greenstein et al (61) are among those who have observed 
this lowered liver catalase activity in tumor-bearing 
animals (rats). Begg and Dickinson (14) noticed that 
forced-feeding maintained the carcass weight but the loss 
of liver catalase activity was still present in the tumor¬ 
bearing rats. Dickinson and Begg (34) noticed a more 
pronounced fall of liver catalase activity with malignant 
tumors than with those which were benign. Adams (1) 
found that the injection of coarse homogenates of certain 
sarcomas depressed the liver catalase activity within 
4$ hours and maintained this depression for about two 
days. He also noted that injection of disintegrated 
material still had an effect even in the absence of 
observable tumor growth. Greenfield and Meister (60) 


00d 






- 23 ~ 


observed a depression in the liver catalase activity by 
more than 50 % within 24 hours following intra-peritoneal 
injection of ethanol fractions of C3HBA mammary tumor. 

They also found (59) that extracts of human cancers had 
the same effect. 

In contrast to the above, Klatt and Taylor 
(72), and Skavinski and Stein (117) found the total liver 
catalase activity to be unaffected or even higher in 
tumor-bearing mice (Klatt and Taylor) and in chick embryos 
with tumor implants (Skavinski and Stein). 

In order to explain the lowered liver catalase 
activity which they observed, Greenstein et al (6l), 
Greenfield and Meister (60), and Adams (2) have postulated 
the elaboration by the tumor of some toxic substance which 
acts directly or indirectly on the liver to produce the 
above effect. Appleman et al ( 8 ) suggested that there 
may be a competition between the liver and the tumor for 
some substance necessary in the formation of the catalase. 

This association between anemia and lowered 
liver catalase activity in tumor-bearing animals is 
evidently more than coincidental and it would seem reason¬ 
able to agree with Greenstein (62) that the tumor has 
some systemic effect on the animal which interferes with 
the synthesis of the hematoporphyrin group.

C. Review of Blood and Bone Marrow Culture Methods 
1* Cultures in Solid Media 

Downey (37) reported that Carrel and Burrows 
were the first to culture bone marrow. In 1910 they 
grew explants of bone marrow from the femur of a young 
cat, presumably in a plasma clot. Three years later Foot 
(53) became the next worker who successfully cultured 
bone marrow. He teased out bits of chicken bone marrow 
in lockers solution which he then placed in drops of 
plasma on sterile cover-slips. When the drops had clotted 
he inverted the cover-slips on hollow ground slides and 
sealed them with vaseline. During incubation he observed 
that different cells migrated out from the bone marrow 
particle and began multiplying in the surrounding medium. 
After a desired period of incubation the cultures could 
be examined microscopically by the usual histological 
techniques of fixing, sectioning and staining. Erdmann 
in 1917 (50) followed closely the method used by Foot 
and also employed chicken bone marrow. After various 
periods of incubation she removed the original explant 
of bone marrow and introduced it into a new drop of 
plasma. By making similar transfers at various intervals 
of time after the start of incubation she was able to 
study migrations of different cell forms from the same 
bone marrow particle until it was exhausted. Carrel and 
Ebeling in 1922 (26) reported observations on cultures 
of the coagulated buffy coat (leucocytes) of centrifuged 



































- 25 - 


peripheral blood from chickens. Using the above method 
they studied the effects of such media as plasma, plasma 
and Tyrode f s solution, plasma and chick embryo juice and 
Tyrode T s solution. Lewis (74) employed cultures of whole 
avian and mammalian blood in the above manner in 1925 to 
determine the changes which took place in the leucocytes 
and in 1926 Lewis and Lewis (75) studied the transformation 
of mononuclear blood-cells from lower vertebrates in 
hanging-drop cultures. This method was also used by Pierce 
in 1932 (100) in studying the buffy coat in leukemic blood. 
In his cultures he employed a medium of Tyrode f s solution, 
rabbit plasma and rabbit embryonic extract. In 1943 
Rachmilewitz and Rosin (110, 111) placed particles of bone 
marrow in test tubes in which there was a medium consisting 
of plasma, Tyrode*s solution and chick embryo juice. They 
closed the test tubes, and after a variable period of 
incubation, examined the cultures by the usual histological 
methods. 

Armbrust and Bett in 1946 (10) obtained 
satisfactory growth of bone marrow explants from guinea 
pigs using a medium of 3 % agar, Tyrode’s solution and 
sheep f s plasma. Pieces of bone marrow were planted in 
this medium just as it was beginning to coagulate. Cells 
migrated from the explants out into the medium and growth 
was measured by determining the increase in area of each 
explant.

2. Cultures ”in Vivo." 

Two methods of blood and bone marrow culture 
,f in vivo” have been described. The first is that of 
Pierce (101) in which he planted particles of the coagulated 
buffy coat of centrifuged leukemic blood on the exposed 
chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos. After the 
f plant’ had been made the window in the eggshell was 
covered with a cover-slip and sealed with paraffin. The 
eggs were incubated again thus permitting the growth of 
the leucocytes for a short time. Plum in 1950 (107) 
described the second method of culture ”in vivo.” In 
this method a suspension of bone marrow cells is injected 
into the anterior chamber of the eye of the white rat. 

After the desired length of time the contents of the 
anterior chamber are aspirated, smeared, stained and 
examined. Plum found this method to be advantageous in 
studying the differentiation of cells. 


3® Culture of Blood or Bone Marrow Cells in Suspension 
In 1936 Osgood and Muscovitz ( 88 ) devised 
an apparatus in which a liquid suspension of bone marrow 
cells was cultured. Osgood made this comment in describing 
his apparatus. ’’The apparatus supplies a lung, kidney, 
and circulation for the marrow, as it provides for the 
control of oxygen and carbon dioxide tension, of pH, and 
of the composition of the medium; for elimination of 
waste products, for supply of nutrients, for removal of

part or all of the culture for study, and for maintenance 
of sterility. n 

The essential feature of this apparatus was 
the semipermeable membrane in the form of a bag (parlodion) 
which contained the bone marrow and separated it from the 
surrounding medium. This medium outside of the parlodion 
bag containing the bone marrow was circulated continually, 
thus keeping the environment of the bone marrow suspension 
constant. Nutrient materials could diffuse through the 
membrane into the culture and as waste products accumulated, 
they could diffuse out of the culture and be carried away 
by the circulating medium. Gas of known composition was 
bubbled through the bone marrow suspension by means of a 
tube leading into the parlodion bag. This gas served both 
to aerate the culture and to keep the cells in the suspension 
from settling out. The part of the apparatus which con¬ 
tained the bone marrow was incubated at 37*5° C. 

Using this apparatus Osgood and Muscovitz were 
the first to culture human bone marrow. Bone marrow 
obtained by sternal puncture was diluted with a diluting 
fluid and then introduced into the parlodion bag along 
with some nutrient medium such as serum. Cell counts were 
performed on, and smears made of the suspension at this 
stage to be compared with those made after a certain perio^ 

of incubation at 37.5° C. Certain other determinations 
such as hemoglobin estimation and chemical analyses were 
also done at various intervals.

The above apparatus was expensive, difficult 
to build, and sterility was sometimes hard to maintain. 
Therefore, after a few months Osgood abandoned this method 
in favor of a simpler one (Osgood and Brownlee; #9, 90). 

In his second method 30 cc. vaccine vials, with rubber 
caps were used as the culture flasks. Media and cells 
were transferred using sterile syringes and needles. 

Marrow obtained by sternal puncture was 
placed immediately into a vial containing a sterile 
citrated physiological salt solution. After centrifuging 
this vial, the immature cells could be largely separated 
off from the red cells. These immature cells were then 
transferred to other vaccine vials and diluted to a desired 
concentration with a physiological salt solution and 
placental cord serum in the ratio of about 2:1. Cell 
counts and smears were made at this time and then the vials 
were incubated at 37«5° C. Serial counts and smears were 
made after various periods of incubation. About every 
forty-eight hours the medium in the vials was changed by 
centrifuging the vials and replacing the supernatant fluid 
with an equal quantity of fresh medium. The air in the 
vials was replaced about every four days. 

Using this method Osgood found that he could 
incubate a large number of cultures at one time with a 
minimum of work and expense. However, finding it desirable 
culture larger quantities of bone marrow at once, he (93) 
devised a third method in 193&. He claimed that this 


















- 29 - 


third method had all the advantages of his first method 
which had been partially sacrificed in the method 
employing vaccine vials, and yet was much simpler than 
the method originally devised. 

The bone marrow suspension in this method 
was contained in a large pyrex aspirator bottle. Fresh 
aerated fluid medium flowed into the culture bottle from 
the bottom and at the same time an equal volume of used 
medium was withdrawn from the top of the fluid level in 
the flask. In other words, new medium flowed in at the 
bottom and upwards through the suspension of cells to the 
upper levels of the fluid where it was withdrawn. Because 
the cells settled to the lower parts of the fluid in the 
culture bottle no cells were lost with the outgoing medium. 
When a sample of the culture was desired for various 
determinations, the culture flask was shaken in order to 
suspend evenly the cells in the fluid and thus to insure 
the withdrawal of a representative sample. 

In evaluating the above three methods of bone 
marrow culture which Osgood and his co-workers have devised 
it is of significance that in later work (22, 91, 92 , 94, 

95, 96) which was carried out on a number of problems the 
second method, that which employed vaccine vials, was favored. 

In 1946 Plum (103, 105) began culturing bone 
marrow in order to study, amongst other problems, reticulo¬ 
cyte ripening substances and erythropoiesis in general. He

judged that the method of Osgood and Muscovitz ($&) was 
the most physiological method that had been devised for 
the culture of bone marrow up to that time* He therefore 
built an apparatus similar to that described by Osgood 
and Muscovitz and used it with good success in culturing 
bone marrow cells* However, since this apparatus did not 
allow direct microscopic examination of the cells while 
they were in culture, he developed a method of his own 
(103, 105) in which this was possible and used it in 
conjunction with the above in his observations of erythro- 
poiesis* 

In Plum’s microscopic method (103, 105) a 
small quantity of bone marrow cells in suspension was 
contained in a small hole in a cover-glass, bounded on 
top by another cover-glass and underneath by a colloidion 
membrane* The colloidion membrane was supported under¬ 
neath by another cover-glass similar to the one containing 
the bone marrow suspension so that the hole in the lower 
cover-glass was directly under that of the one above* The 
lower cover-glass was cemented to a Burker-Turch counting 
chamber, through the gutters of which medium flowed in a 
continuous stream* In principle this method was the same 
as the macro method (Osgood and Muscovitz) in that the 
bone marrow suspension was separated by a semi-permeable 
membrane from a nutrient medium which was being replaced 
constantly* This whole apparatus could be placed under

a microscope thus allowing the cells to be viewed directly 
while they were in culture. A heating table under the 
microscope kept the temperature at the desired level. 

Plum found that the phase contrast microscope facilitated 
the observations which he made using this method. In 
addition to the above, Plum (107) also devised an "in vivo” 
method which has been described previously. Using the 
above methods, Plum (106) has successfully cultured bone 
marrow from rabbits, dogs, cats, and humans. 

A comparatively large number of workers ha s 
cultured bone marrow and blood using the method of Osgood 
and Brownlee or modifications thereof and found the method 
applicable to a number of research problems. In 1940 
Israels (71) found the method suitable for studying the 
development and morphologic changes of leucocytes from 
human bone marrow in culture. Hays (69) and Gunz (63, 64) 
have successfully used the method in the culture of perpherial 
blood cells. Hays in 1946 studied the effect of folic acid 
on red blood cells and in 194$ Gunz studied human leukemic 
cells in culture. In 1947 Rusznyak et al (113) studied the 
maturation of megaloblasts in cultures of bone marrow from 
patients with pernicious anemia. Norris and Majnarich 
($0, $1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6), and Bieselle and Berger (17) 
tested the effects of various substances on bone marrow 
cultures. They modified Osgood 1 s and Brownlee’s technique 
by placing glass beads in the vials and then placing the 




















* 










- 32 - 


vials in a rack in a Warburg bath so that the cultures 
were slowly agitated while they were being incubated* 

Norris and Majnarich ($0) were able to culture bone marrow 
of cattle, rabbits, sheep, rats and cats using this modifi¬ 
cation of Osgood’s and Brownlee’s method.

SECTION III 


SURVEY OF PRESENT CONCEPTS OF ERYTHROPOIESIS 

As this thesis deals largely with bone marrow 
cultures and especially the erythropoiesis in these cultures, 
it would seem imperative that a discussion of erythropoiesis 
in general should be included. However, it must be remembered 
that this project does not deal with erythropoiesis per se, 
but rather with the establishment of a biological assay 
method which may make the confirmation of the presence of 
an erythropoietic inhibitor in malignancy possible. Never¬ 
theless, it is felt that knowledge of erythropoiesis is 
needed as a background to the work.

When this project was begun it was generally 
accepted that red blood cells were produced in the bone 
marrow from the normoblasts found there. However, papers 
by two authors who disagree with this concept have been 
noted. In 1943 Duran-Jorda (3$) put forth a theory of 
erythropoiesis deviating widely from any proposed up to. 
that time. He regarded the red blood corpuscle as a 
product of cellular secretion and not as one of cellular 
evolution. In examination of embryo slides he noticed 
certain cells with cartlike nucleii whose cytoplasm 
contained bodies which appeared to be red blood corpuscles. 
He found that some of these cells had split into two 
portions. The one part contained the nucleus and looked 
like a plasma cell. The other part consisted of some of 
the spheroidal bodies which had become free. From these 
observations he concluded that the red blood corpuscle 
was a product of a unicellular gland system. In this 
system the plasma cell develops red blood corpuscles in 
its cytoplasm. When the cell reaches a certain size it 
breaks in two and thus liberates the red blood corpuscles. 
The part of the cell containing the nucleus looks like 
an erythroblast at this point. In its subsequent develop¬ 
ment Duran-Jorda visualized it as becoming a normoblast, 
then a lymphocyte, and finally a plasma cell, thus com¬ 
pleting its cycle and back to the stage once again where 
it could produce red blood corpuscles.

In two later papers (39, 40) he had modified 
the above conclusions. He suggested that the lymphocyte 
through the intermediate stage of the Paneth cell becomes 
the eosinophil cell which he found in the gastric and 
intestinal mucosae. These eosinophil polymorphs gained 
entrance to the blood and were carried to the hemopoietic 
organs. He looked upon the granules in the cytoplasm of 
the eosinophils as preformed red corpuscles which increased 
in size and with the rupture of the eosinophil were released 
into the circulation. The eosinophil then became a lympho¬ 
cyte once more and could therefore repeat the above process. 
In 1950 Duran-Jorda (41) reported that red blood corpuscles 
in the embryo were a product of normoblastic extrusion and 
that in the adult the normoblast secretes the reticulocyte 
in the bone marrow (cf. Plum, 10$). 

In 1947 Wajda (129, 130) proposed another 
concept of erythropoiesis. He made observations of the 
changes that take place in traumatized striated muscle 
fibers and reported that he saw red blood corpuscles arise 
from the degenerating muscle fibers. He supported his 
views with published photomicrographs which lend the 
support of direct observations. However, Le Gros Clark (73) 
challenged the above theory and stated that he was familiar 
with the changes in traumatized striated muscle and could 
not find any process even remotely similar to those observed 
by Wajda.

The above concepts are indeed startling and 
seem to be incompatible with the classical theory of red 
blood cell formation in the bone marrow from the cells of 
the reticulo-endothelial system. As this thesis does not 
deal primarily with erythropoiesis, no studies were made 
in order to confirm or disprove the above theories of red 
blood cell formation. Instead, the usual theory of erythro- 
poiesis has been accepted and used as a basis on which to 
work. 

Doan et al (35) attribute to Neumann the first 
description of erythrogenesis in bone marrow which he made 
in l£6£. Since then numerous workers have confirmed the 
normal production of red blood cells in adult life by the 
bone marrow. Cells from the reticulo-endothelial system 
(which arises from the mesodermal layer in the embryo) 
are the precursors of red blood cells. The first recog¬ 
nizable cell of the erythroid series of cells in the bone 
marrow is the pronormoblast (following the terminology 
which Wintrobe used in his textbook on hematology). This 
is a fairly large cell with a large, somewhat vesicular 
nucleus containing one or more nucleoli. Surrounding 
the nucleus is a thin band of basophilic cytoplasm. In 
the course of the cell’s development the nucleoli disappear 
and the chromatin in the nucleus takes on a coarser 

appearance, and may even arrange itself in a manner similar 
to that of the chromatin in a plasma cell. At this stage

the cell is called a basophilic normoblast. With the 
appearance of traces of hemoglobin in the cytoplasm, 
the cytoplasm takes on a polychromatic character and the 
cell is known as a polychromatic normoblast. The nucleus 
as well as the cell as a whole is smaller and the chromatin 
is more f clumped’ by this time. This cell becomes the 
orthochromatic normoblast when the cytoplasm becomes almost 
completely acidophilic, indicating that the cell has 
acquired almost its full complement of hemoglobin. At 
this point the nucleus becomes more and more compact until 
it finally becomes pycnotic and is lost. With the loss 
of the nucleus the cell becomes the adult red blood cell 
and is ready for its release into the circulatory system. 

Some remanents of the basophilic network of the cytoplasm 
of the early stages (such as the pronormoblast) may remain 
for a short while. As long as there is any of this baso¬ 
philic material left in the cytoplasm the red blood cell is 
known as a reticulocyte. 

All the cells in the above series up to the 
orthochromatic normoblast with the pycnotic nucleus are 
able to divide mitotically. Once the nucleus becomes 
pycnotic, however, the power of multiplication by mitosis 
is lost. 

There has been much controversy in the literature 
concerning the mechanism by which the nucleus of the normo¬ 
blast is lost. The two most prevalent concepts of the 
fate of this nucleus are: 



(1) That it dissolves or is broken up inside the 
orthochromatic normoblast by the process of karyolysis. 

(2) That it is extruded from the cell and is sub¬ 
sequently broken up outside of the cell* 

There is another theory as to the mechanism 
of production of erythrocytes from normoblasts, but which 
has received relatively little attention, and yet which 
seems plausible enough to receive serious consideration. 

In 1912 Emmel (47) made observations on the blood of 
pig-embryos which convinced him that normoblasts give 
rise to erythrocytes by a process of budding. In 1914 
(4$) he reported more evidence for this concept and in 
1924 (49) after further studies of the blood of amphibia 
as well as of embryos of mammals, he was convinced that 
erythrocytes did arise by budding or cytoplasmic segre¬ 
gation from the normoblasts. Plum (103, 106, 10$) studied 
this phenomenon using his micro-culture apparatus. He 
reported that he observed a spherical erythroblast assume 
an oval shape with the nucleus at one end and the bulk of 
the cytoplasm containing hemoglobin at the other end. After 
a short time a portion of this cytoplasm would become 
detached and in about an hour become a cell of normal size. 
In his macro apparatus he noted that the addition of col¬ 
chicine which completely inhibits mitosis had hardly any 
effect on the rate of red cell production. Also, on a 
theoretical basis he calculated that there were not enough 
mitotic figures relative to the total number of normoblasts

in the bone marrow to produce the required number of 
erythrocytes per day. From the above studies Plum 
concluded that erythrocytes are the product of cellular 
secretion by gemmation or budding and not of cellular 
evolution. 



SECTION IV 


CRITIQUE OF METHODS OF ERYTHROPOIETIC STUDIES 

A* "In Vivo" Methods Using Experimental Animals 

Presuming that an erythropoietic inhibitor 
is released into the blood stream by malignant cells, 
some means of its extraction from the blood and 
injection into experimental animals could be reasonably 
expected. If this substance was excreted by the 
kidneys of cancerous patients it may also be found in 
and extracted from the urine. The injection into 

experimental animals of such extracts might be expected 
to lead to anemia in them* 




■ .' . 
















..." 

, 






/fl 


Certain difficulties must be considered in 
the evaluation of the use of experimental animals in 
such a project. Firstly, a sufficiently large number 
of animals would have to be used in order that various 
extracts from a number of patients with cancer could 
be tested. Secondly, the best site of injection would 
have to be determined by comparing the results of tests 
on injections made intra-venously, intra-muscularily, 
intra-peritoneally, and sub-cutaneously. Thirdly, the 
extracts would have to be of such a nature that various 
injection reactions such as abscesses and allergic 
reactions would not result. Fourthly, and perhaps most 
important, would be the time lapse which may result 
before any anemia in these animals would show up after 
an injection* If the above reaction could be used in 
the diagnosis of malignant disease this time lapse may 
be of sufficient magnitude to markedly reduce the value 
of the reaction for clinical diagnosis of malignancy. 

For these as well as other reasons it was decided that 
the intact experimental animal might not be satisfactory 
biological material for the determination of an erythro¬ 
poietic inhibitor in malignancy, keeping in mind the 
possible clinical value of a quick method. 


B. "In Vitro" Methods (Bone Marrow Cultures) 

An erythropoietic inhibitor should logically 
be expected to exert its effect "in vitro" as well as 







' 


w 














lU 






"in vivo." In other words if it produces an anemia in 
cancerous patients by inhibiting the bone marrow it should 
by the same action depress the growth and multiplication 
of bone marrow cells in culture. Since the growth in 
these cultures can be determined at frequent intervals, 
any effect of extracts of blood on these cultures should 
be quickly determined. 

Of the many methods of marrow culture which 
have been developed, some are superior to others. 

Therefore it was expedient that each method be analyzed 
in the light of the problem being studied (anemia in 
cancerous persons) in order that the method most suited 
to the demands of the project be chosen and employed. 

These demands are as follows: 

(a) Simplicity. This would facilitate the adop¬ 
tion of the method as a whole should it become practical 
to use it as a diagnostic measure. 

(b) Optimal physiological conditions, in order to 
obtain the maximum growth and multiplication possible. 

(c) Rapid growth, which would give a greater 
sensitivity in detecting the presence of an inhibitor. 

(d) Ease and accuracy in determining growth. 

(e) Feasibility of incubation of multiple cultures 
so that there would be proper controls for each experiment, 
and so that many tests might be run simultaneously.

The bone marrow culture methods which have 
been included in the review of the literature will be 
compared under a number of headings in the light of the 
above criteria. 


1. Assessment of Growth 

Any of the methods employing bone marrow 
clots in solid media have the disadvantage that it is 
extremely difficult to assess accurately their growth. 
Multiplication is usually determined by noting the 
increase in area of the explanted bone marrow particles 
as did Armburst and Bett (10). It is obvious that such 
a method might be inaccurate because it does not consider 
any increase in thickness or in the concentration of 
cells in a given area. Enumeration of the nuclei or 
cells in such cultures is hardly feasible because of 
the thickness of the clot and the consequent super¬ 
imposition of the nuclei. 

Cultures of bone marrow cells in fluid 
suspension seem more amenable to accurate assessment 
of their growth. The production of red blood cells can 
be estimated from changes in their concentration from 
time to time. Three methods of calculating red cell 
counts are reviewed by Connolly in 1947 (32). The oldest 
and most widely known and used method is that employing

. 


■ 

. 

. 


a hemocytometer. The second that he reports is that 
of Phillips in which the number of red cells is estimated 
from the grams of hemoglobin as determined by their copper 
sulfate specific gravity method. The third method and 
the one which Connolly recommends is the photo-electric 
method introduced by Blum (l£) in which the red cell count 
is estimated from the turbidity of a diluted solution of 
red cells as measured by a photo-electric colorimeter. 
Increases in the number of nucleated cells can be estimated 
by determination of uptake rates of radioactive phosphorus 
in desoxyribose nucleic acid (Osgood, 97) or by repeated 
nucleated cell counts with a hemocytometer. Direct 
counts of cells in a hemocytometer is the only method 
of the above applicable to both red and nucleated cells 
and therefore is perhaps the most suitable method of 
estimating cell counts in fluid bone marrow cultures. 
Accordingly it was decided to use the standard methods of 
determining cell counts in this project and a discussion 
of the technique of such will be given later. 

Assessment of growth in the micro method of 
Plum would seem to be almost impossible. The sample is 
too small to allow any determinations such as cell counts 
by the usual methods or by colorimeteric determinations to 
be made. Even direct enumeration of the number of cells 
in the ’culture chamber’ is impossible because there is a 
certain amount of the initial sample that is squeezed out

between the two upper cover-glasses and between the 
cover-glass with the bone marrow suspension and the colloi 
dion membrane. There is a constant shifting of cells from 
the T hole f containing the bone marrow out to the space 
between the cover-glasses and back again. Such ’migration 
of these cells seriously handicaps an evaluation of the 
concentration of cells and consequently of the increase 
in the number of cells. 

The two ”in vivo” culture methods of Pierce 
(101) and Plum (107) are included in this discussion of 
”in vitro” culture methods simply because they are means 
of artificially growing bone marrow cells. The same 
difficulties in assessing growth are found in the Pierce 
method of culturing bits of bone marrow (or clotted 
leucocytes) on the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick 
embryo as are found in all the methods of culturing 
bone marrow in solid media as discussed above. In the 
Plum method in which suspensions of cells are cultured 
in the anterior chamber of the rat’s eye it is difficult 
to conceive a technique whereby one could withdraw a 
representative sample of the cell suspension. One could 
hardly insure an even suspension of cells in the anterior 
chamber by shaking. These two methods of bone marrow 
culture would be of value in studying the morphology of 
cells rather than their rate of multiplication.

2. Cell Counting Technique 

Before the technique of culturing bone raarrrow 
cells in suspension was begun the method of cell counting 
using a standard hemocytometer was chosen for determining 
the multiplication of cells in these cultures. The 
method is a modification of that used in making routine 
clinical red cell counts. The technique of making red 
cell counts will be reviewed first. 

The materials used for red cell counts are 
as follows: a lancet, a blood diluting pipette, a 
mechanical shaker, a hemocytometer, a microscope and a 
tally device. The lancet is used for making a small 
skin puncture to obtain a sample of capillary blood. 

The pipette allows the blood to be diluted 1:1000, 1:500, 
1:333.3, 1:250, 1:200, 1:166.6, 1:142.3, 1:125, 1:111.1 
or 1:100. One in two hundred is the dilution normally 
employed but 1:100 is recommended for making counts on 
blood in which the red cell concentration is markedly 
reduced. The mechanical shaker is not essential as the 
pipettes can be shaken by hand, but it insures a more 
even distribution of cells in the pipette and does the 
job more quickly and easily. The hemocytometer is a 
heavy glass slide with three shoulders running across 
it. The outer two shoulders support a glass coverslip 
1/10 millimeter above the center shoulder. This center 
shoulder is divided into two parts by a trough running 





















* 




















- 47 - 


parallel to the length of the slide• Each half of the 
center shoulder has a small grid inscribed on it. This 
grid is a square of 9 square millimeters in which the 
center square is divided into 25 small squares each of 
which is further divided into 16 more squares. The four 
square millimeters in the corners of the large square are 
divided into 16 squares each. The cells from a diluted 
sample of blood are counted in this hemocytometer under 
a microscope. A hand tally greatly facilitates the 
counting of the cells. 

A red cell count is done in this manner. 
Blood from a small puncture is drawn up to the 0.5 mark 
on the blood diluting pipette. Diluting fluid such as 
Hayem’s, Gower’s or Toisson’s is drawn up to the 101 
mark thus giving a dilution of 1:200. The pipette is 
shaken by hand for about three minutes or on a mechanical 
shaker for about thirty seconds. Three or four drops are 
then shaken out and discarded before the counting chamber 
or hemocytometer is filled or charged with a drop of 
diluted blood on each side. After the cells have been 
allowed to settle in the hemocytometer for about a 
minute the cells in five of the 1/25 of a square milli¬ 
meter squares in the center square are counted. These 
five squares are the four corner squares and the center 
one of the larger central square millimeter. In other 
words, the number of cells in $0 of the smaller squares 
in the central square millimeter are counted. This 
number multiplied by the dilution factor (200), the

. 




- 4$ - 


area factor (which is 5 because the cells over 5/25ths 
of a square millimeter were counted), and the volume 
factor (which is 10 because the chamber is only 1/10 
of a millimeter deep) gives the number of red blood cells 
in one cubic millimeter. 

In making white blood cell counts the same 
procedure is followed in principle except that only a 
1:20 dilution is made, the diluting fluid (such as 1 % 
acetic acid) used dissolves the red blood cells and the 
cells in the four corner square millimeters are counted. 
Because of the different dilution and different area 
involved the number of cells counted is multiplied by a 
different factor. 

Cell counts as performed by the standard 
method are liable to the following errors (21). 

(a) Sampling errors of which there are two; the 
first in taking the sample of blood for dilution and 

the second when the diluted blood is placed in the counting 
chamber. 

(b) Dilution error which can arise from an inaccurately 
calibrated pipette or from lack of experience on the part 

of the technician. 

(c) The chamber error of Berkson, Magath and Hurn 
(15, 16). This error consists of three ,T sub-errors. ,f 

i. Inconsistent filling of the counting chamber, 
ii. Random settling and distribution of cells 


within the chamber 




'

■ 








. 











- 49 - 


iii. Variations in dimensions of the chamber 
that arise from inaccurate calibration or improper 
assembly of the cover-glass and chamber after cleaning, 

(d) Actual errors in counting. 

Some of these errors are inherent in the 
technique but others are subject to a human factor, and 
will depend in some degree at least on skill of perform¬ 
ance. A clean puncture wound from which the blood flows 
freely will insure a more representative sample than one 
from which the blood has to be squeezed. Only pipettes 
and counting chambers approved by the United States 
Bureau of Standards should be used. Using these pipettes 
and after sufficient practice a high degree of skill can 
be attained in drawing the blood to the T mark T accurately 
and in making an accurate dilution of this blood by drawing 
diluting fluid to the second mark (the 101 mark which is 
situated above the bulb of such a pipette). With respect 
to diluting fluids Ying-Chang Ch f u and Forkner ( 134 ) 
found Gower’s solution to be superior to Hayem’s solution 
which often clumped the cells. The shaking of the pipette 
before the chamber is charged is very important. This is 
done best with a mechanical shaker specially designed for 
the job. With practice, however, one can learn the 
technique of shaking these pipettes by hand. The pipette 
must be shaken in a plane at right angles to the long axis 
of the pipette and for a period of about three minutes if 



- 50 - 


it is done by hand or about thirty seconds if a mechanical 
shaker is used. Immediately on completion of the shaking 
about three or four drops must be discarded from the 
pipette to avoid filling the chamber with fluid that was 
in the capillary part of the pipette and which is there¬ 
fore not a representative sample of the diluted blood. 

As the cells settle fairly rapidly after the shaking is 
completed only one side of the counting chamber should be 
charged before the pipette is shaken again and the second 
side charged. In charging (or filling) the chamber care 
must be taken neither to over-charge nor under-charge it 
as this may effect the distribution of the cells. Sufficient 
time must elapse before counting is started so that the 
cells can settle to the surface of the chamber before they 
are counted. In this way cells will not be missed through 
being out of focus. The random settling of the cells in 
the chamber is one factor largely out of control of the 
technician but a clean chamber and smooth 3 even filling 
of the chamber help to give an even distribution. Errors 
in the actual counting of the cells can be reduced or 
eliminated by care and practice. In the cleaning and 
reassembly of the counting chamber special precautions 
must be taken to clean off any lint or dirt which may be 
on the shoulders which support the cover-glass as such 
foreign material between the cover-glass and the shoulders 
would materially affect the depth of the chamber. Care 
should also be taken to orientate the cover-glass on the 








































. 




'

chamber each time so that if there is a bow in the cover- 
glass for example it will always be either up or down. 
Clips (133) which hold the cover-glass in place have been 
found to decrease the variations in the dimensions in the 
depth of the chamber from one assembly to the next. 


3 • Sterility 

Bone marrow cultures provide ideal conditions 
for the growth of many bacteria. The temperature is 
optimal for many of them and there is an excellent 
medium in which they can grow. Their presence is obviously 
undesirable and precautions have to be taken to keep the 
cultures free of contamination, or at least to keep the 
number of bacteria as low as possible. 

All equipment which comes in contact with 
the actual culture material has to be sterilized by auto¬ 
claving, dry heat, boiling or by chemical means. Conse¬ 
quently, a method of bone marrow culture in which the 
amount of equipment used is kept to a minimum will entail 
a proportionately smaller amount of time and work in the 
preparation of equipment for the experiments. The apparatus 
which Osgood ( 88 ) first designed was complicated and 
cumbersome and therefore difficult to sterilize. This 
was perhaps one of his reasons for the abandonment of 
this method in a few months in favor of a simpler one in 
spite of the fact that this was one of the best marrow

culture methods yet devised from the standpoint of 
physiological conditions. This second method which 
employed vaccine vials required less work in proportion 
to the number of cultures incubated in that there was 
less equipment to clean and sterilize. For the purposes 
of this project a method such as that of Osgood and 
Brownlee ($9, 90) in which the amount of equipment used 
is kept to a minimum is desirable in view of the possible 
practical application of the technique in the diagnosis 
of malignancy. 

Aseptic technique is of paramount importance 
in the maintenance of sterility in these cultures. Draft- 
free rooms, a minimum of activity while working with the 
cultures, care in keeping the culture rooms as dust-free 
as possible, flaming the mouths of culture flasks whenever 
they are opened, and bacteriological technique in general 
will greatly reduce the chances of contamination. However, 
in the event that a few bacteria do gain entrance to the 
cultures and the circumstances there are favorable for 
their growth, a certain interval of time is required 
before they can establish themselves and multiply suffi¬ 
ciently in number so that they interfere with the growth 
of the bone marrow cells. If this period of time in which 
the bacteria are establishing themselves (and in which 
they, presumably, are not interfering with erythropoiesis) 
is sufficiently long one may be able to study the erythro¬ 
poietic growth curve before the bacteria become established.

If this is true, time and effort may be saved in not 
employing strict aseptic technique, but instead using 
sufficiently good technique so that the number of the 
bacteria does not become overwhelming in the period in 
which the cells are cultured. Such a procedure would 
make the whole technique more practical. 

In 1940 Bullowa, Osgood, Bukantz and Brownlee 
(22), in the study of the effect of sulfapyridine on 
pneumococcus-infected marrow cultures found that in 
concentrations of about 10 milligrams per 100 milliliters, 
sulfapyridine did not appear to damage the marrow cells. 
Later, in 1951, Osgood was employing 100,000 units per 
liter of K salt penicillin G (97) in the nutrient medium 
to reduce the growth of possible contaminating bacteria. 

The sulfa and the antibiotic drugs may allow one to discard 
aseptic precautions almost completely in the culture of 
marrow cells, thus saving a great deal of time and labor. 

Bone marrow cultures contain a large propor¬ 
tion of macrophages, monocytes and polymorphonuclear 
leucocytes. These cells doubtless play a big part in 
controlling the numbers of bacteria in these cultures 
and thus make the culture of bone marrow cells as a whole 
that much simpler.

Two types of fluids are used in tissue 
culture; one type is the diluting fluid and the other

type is the nutrient fluid. Included in the diluting 
fluids which have been used in marrow cultures are 
Ringer’s solution, Locke’s solution, Tyrode’s solution, 
and Gey’s solution. Ringer’s solution is unsatisfactory 
for mammalian cells because it is not buffered. Locke’s 
solution contains no phosphates and therefore is limited 
in its buffering capacity. Tyrode’s solution has been 
used successfully as a diluting fluid in bone marrow 
cultures by a number of workers including Carrell and 
Ebeling (26), Pierce (100), Rachmilewitz and Rosin (110), 
Armburst and Bett (10), and Norris and Majnarich (SO). 
Gey’s solution is similar to Tyrode’s but has a higher 
potassium level, a lower calcium level and is not as 
highly buffered. The pH in this medium is controlled by 
equilibration with a five percent concentration of carbon 
dioxide in the atmosphere. Maintaining an atmosphere of 
five percent carbon dioxide involves replacing the air in 
the culture flask with a gaseous mixture containing five 
percent carbon dioxide. When one considers that this has 
to be done after every time that the culture flask is 
opened (such as after obtaining a sample for the counting 
of cells) it is readily seen that the extra work involved 
in using Gey’s solution is a significant amount. Osgood 
( 96 ) modified this medium by leaving out the bicarbonate 
and increasing the sodium chloride concentration to £.0 
grams per liter. In this way he was able to maintain a

pH suitable for the culture of marrow cells without 
having to replace the air above the fluid. However, 

Cameron (24) stated that NaHCO^ is an essential con¬ 
stituent of any medium because it is important in the 
glycolytic activity of the cells. Therefore it seems 
desirable to use the medium recommended by Gey and Gey 
(56) for work under ordinary atmospheric conditions. This 
medium is the same as the first one that they proposed 
except that the NaHCOj concentration is reduced to one 
tenth and the NaCl is increased to $.0 grams per liter. 

The compositions of all of the above media are given in 
Table I. 

Sterilization of any solution containing the 
HCO^ presents a problem because the HCO^ breaks down to 
CO 2 and is blown off when the solution is autoclaved or 
boiled. This loss of CC >2 makes the solution more alkaline. 
These solutions are therefore best sterilized by filtration 
but even then CO^ can be lost if the suction used, such 
as in Seitz filtration, is too great. They could also be 
prepared from sterile stock solutions by aseptic technique 
but this is perhaps somewhat hazardous. 


b. Nutrient fluids 

Plasma, reconstituted adult human plasma, 
serum, placental cord serum, embryo extract and liver

extract are among the various nutrient fluids that have 
been used in marrow cultures. Plasma has been used 
mainly in clot cultures and because of its fibrinogen 
content seems unsuitable for fluid cultures of marrow. 

Plum divided the serum which he used into two types. 

That serum which was from the same animal from which he 
obtained the bone marrow was celled ’native f serum and 
serum taken from another animal of the same species was 
termed ’foreign’ serum. Plum (104) found that on the 
average foreign serum gave about 15 % poorer growth than 
did native serum. Osgood ($9) used placental cord serum 
in many of his cultures as the nutrient medium. Cairns 
and Lajtha (23) used reconstituted dried plasma in the 
study of adhesion of leucocytes and obtained satisfactory 
growth with it. Carrel and Ebeling (26), Pierce (100), 
and Rachmilewitz and Rosin (110), used embryo extract in 
their bone marrow clot cultures and Gunz (63, 64 ) used 
it in his modification of Osgood and Brownlee’s technique. 
The use of embryo extract entails a great deal of work in 
its preparation and there is much biological variation 
from one preparation to the next. Liver extract was found 
by Plum (104) to give fairly good growth when added to a 
suspension of marrow cells in Locke’s solution. Thus it 
is seen that there are many nutrient fluids which could 
be used for marrow cultures but on the basis of the 
results of the above workers serum seems to give the 
greatest and most consistent growth.

5. Speed and Practicability 

Should this project prove the feasibility 
of determining an erythropoietic inhibitor specific to 
malignant disease in such a way that it could be used in 
a diagnostic manner, the speed and practicability of the 
test would be of paramount importance* Therefore an 
attempt has been made in this project to keep techniques 
as simple as possible* Osgood and Brownlee’s ($3, $9) 
method of bone marrow culture is one of the simplest 
and yet most physiological marrow culture methods yet 
devised, and therefore recommends itself for the purposes 
of this project* The amount of equipment which is used 
is kept to a minimum, the cells are in suspension and there¬ 
fore lend themselves readily to the addition of substances 
to be tested, the amount of growth can be determined fairly 
accurately, and bacterial contamination does not present 

a major problem* Therefore this method has been chosen, 
in principle, as the biological assay method whereby the 
presence of an erythropoietic inhibitor in malignancy can 
be tested.

B. Miscellaneous Expendable Material 

Various materials used in the course of 
these experiments are listed under Appendix I. 


C. Biological Material* 

1. Blood 

a. Rabbit - obtained by femoral or carotid 
arterial puncture. 

b. Rat - obtained by heart puncture or from cut 
end of tail. 

c. Human - obtained by venipuncture from Mr. 
McLuhan or Mr. Nelson. 

2. Bone Marrow

always contains a fairly large percentage of peripheral 
blood. 

b. Rat - obtained by aspiration of shafts of 
femurs or humeri. 

3. Bone Marrow Culture Stock.

in their final concentration of about 1000 - 3000 per 
cu. mm. before culturing begins. This solution is 
divided into 15 ml. culture volumes. 















4. Concentrated Bone Marrow Suspension 

The concentrated stock solution of the 
myeloid-erythroid layer of cells in the diluting fluid 
(with or without serum) on which the first nucleated 
count is made to determine the dilution necessary to 
give a concentration of nucleated cells between 1000 and 
3000 per cu. mm. 

5* Rats 

Adult white rats of either sex. 

6. Rabbits 

For the most part these were adult female, 
domestic white or brown rabbits which had been previously 
used by the Department of Pathology, Provincial Laboratory 
for Friedman pregnancy tests and which had been ovariecto- 
mized at least two weeks previous to the time that they 
were used as a source of blood and bone marrow. The 
occasional adult male rabbit was used as well. 

7. Serum

centrifuging of the blood 1500 - 2500 r.p.m. for 15 
minutes to separate the fibrin from the serum. 


D. Cleaning and Sterilization of Equipment 

All glassware, needles and instruments 
were rinsed in hot running tap water as soon as possible

after being used. The instruments were allowed to soak 
in calgonite solution for a few minutes, rinsed and dried 
with a towel. They were sterilized by dry heat (160° C. 
for 90 minutes) or in the electric boiling water sterilizer 
before the next operation. 

Syringes, needles, centrifuge tubes, glass 
rods, Wintrobe tubes and pipettes and homogenizer were 
soaked for a variable period in calgonite solution and 
then boiled in the same solution for 20 minutes. After 
being rinsed five to ten times in running hot tap water 
they were rinsed about five times in distilled water and 
then soaked for an hour or more in distilled water. They 
were then transferred to ethyl alcohol and allowed to 
stand in it for 3 hours or overnight after which they 
were rinsed five times with distilled water and allowed 
to dry at room temperature. Such glassware as Wintrobe 
tubes and pipettes were given a final acetone rinse in 
order to facilitate drying. When dry the syringes were 
wrapped (plunger and barrel separate) in brown wrapping 
paper, and the needles, glass rods, Wintrobe tubes and 
pipettes and homogenizer were placed in test tubes 
stoppered with cotton plugs. Because rubber is toxic 
to bone marrow cells (Gunz, 63 ) the plunger of the homo¬ 
genizer was dipped before autoclaving in melted paraffin 
about every second time it was used. 

The ungraduated pipettes, and the transferring, 
measuring and volumetric pipettes were not boiled in 
calgonite but otherwise were cleaned in the above manner.

The final rinse was made with acetone after which the 
pipettes were dried by sucking air through them. They 

were then wrapped in brown paper or placed in linen 

cloth bags before autoclaving. 

The blood diluting pipettes were placed in 
the pipette cleaner attached to a water vacuum pump, 
rinsed a couple of times in tap water, washed with 
calgonite solution, rinsed in tap water again then dis¬ 
tilled water, and finally acetone after which they were 
dried by sucking air through them. They were prepared 
for autoclaving by placing them in test tubes stoppered 
with cotton plugs. 

The culture bottles were first rinsed out 
with hot running tap water and then filled with calgonite 
and allowed to stand overnight. As a further precaution 
against the presence of organic material in these bottles 
it was felt that some mechanical cleaning of them was 
necessary and accordingly the power-driven nylon brush 
was used to brush them out thoroughly with calgonite 
solution after which they were rinsed ten times in hot run¬ 
ning tap water, five times with distilled water and then 
filled with 95 % alcohol and allowed to stand overnight. Again 
they were rinsed five times with distilled water and then 
soaked in distilled water for a variable period before 
autoclaving. Towards the end of the project some of the 
culture bottles were siliconed in an attempt to prevent

nucleated cells from sticking to the inside of the glass 
(Cairns and Lajtha (23) ). After the above cleaning they 
were rinsed with Dri-film and then distilled water. 

Excess Dri-film was wiped from the side of the culture 
bottles by winding cloth around the power-driven nylon 
brush and brushing the inside of the bottles. On com¬ 
pletion of this they were soaked in alcohol and rinsed 
with distilled water as above. 

If any of the above pipettes, centrifuge 
tubes or culture bottles contained excessive organic 
material which was not easily rinsed off they were soaked 
overnight in cleaning solution, rinsed well in hot running 
tap water and then cleaned in the manner described above. 

The rubber stoppers were soaked in tap water 
after use, boiled in distilled water for about an hour 
and then soaked in fresh distilled water until they were 
autoclaved. 

The centrifuge tubes were usually sterilized 
by dry heat (160° C. for 90 minutes) in the drying oven 
instead of being autoclaved. It was noticed that there 
was often some, condensation in them after autoclaving. 

The rest of the glassware and needles were sterilized by 
autoclaving at 20 pounds pressure for 20 to 30 minutes. 

The pressure was released slowly at the end of this time 
and the equipment was left in the autoclave with the door 
partially open until the autoclave had cooled down to

room temperature. The rubber stoppers and teflon caps 
for the centrifuge tubes were autoclaved and then placed 
in the necks of the centrifuge tubes (using aseptic 
technique) after they had been sterilized and had cooled 
down to room temperature. 


E. Preparation of Diluting Fluids 

Stock solutions of the various salts 
necessary for the preparation of the different diluting 
fluids were made up in distilled water in the concentra¬ 
tions given in Table II. These solutions were autoclaved, 
brought back to volume with sterile distilled water and 
stored in sterile stock bottles. 

During the first part of the project a Seitz 
filter was not on hand and accordingly the diluting fluids 
had to be sterilized by autoclaving. The Gey f s solution 
which is equilibrated with an atmosphere containing 5^ 
carbon dioxide was prepared in the following manner. The 
given amounts of the salt stock solutions were added to 
about 700 ml. of distilled water in a 1000 ml. volumetric 
flask with the exception of the calcium chloride. The 
solution was thoroughly shaken after the addition of each 
salt. The salt mixture, a separate quantity of calcium 
chloride stock solution and a few hundred milliliters of 
distilled water were autoclaved. The calcium chloride

solution was brought back to volume with the sterile 
distilled water and then the amount given in Table II 
was added to the salt mixture* 

It was found that the salt solution developed 
a fine white precipitate when calcium chloride was added 
to it before autoclaving. Dextrose is thought to carmelize 
during autoclaving and is therefore added afterwards. 

The given amounts of sterile dextrose powder 
and sodium bicarbonate were weighed out aseptically and 
added to the salt solution after which sterile distilled 
water was added to bring the volume to 1000 ml. After 
thorough shaking the solution was transferred to a sterile 
1000 ml. stock bottle. 

Osgood’s solution was prepared in the above 
manner according to Table III but no bicarbonate was 
added.

Table IV. Stock Solutions for Gey f s Solution 












~ 72 - 


Midway through the project new salt stock 
solutions were prepared using double distilled water* 

The concentrations of these are given in Table IV. At 
this time a Seitz filter was obtained allowing solutions 
containing the bicarbonate ion to be sterilized without 
it being lost in the form of carbon dioxide as happens 
when such solutions are autoclaved. Therefore from this 
time on the Gey’s solution suitable for use under atmos¬ 
pheric conditions was used. The salts and the dextrose 
were added to about 700 ml. of double distilled water 
in the amounts given in Table IV. After thorough mixing 
double distilled water was added to the 1000 ml. mark and 
the solution was filtered through a freshly autoclaved 
Seitz filter into a sterile receiving flask. The filtra¬ 
tion was done under reduced pressure in the receiving 
flask obtained with a water vacuum pump. If the suction 
in the receiving flask is too great there will be an 
excessive loss of 002* Therefore as little suction as 
possible was used in filtering this solution* A 0.1 u 
pore size filter disc was used and was thoroughly rinsed 
with distilled water after use. The salt mixture was 
transferred to and stored in a sterile 1000 ml. stock 
bottle. Two hundred thousand units of crystalline 
penicillin - G, potassium was mixed up in sterile double 
distilled water and added to the salt solution in order 
to inhibit growth of at least some of the bacteria which

may have gained entrance to the mixture. Towards the 
end of the project this salt solution was stored in the 
refrigerator to further reduce growth of possible 
contaminating bacteria or fungi. 

If the pH of any of the above balanced 
salt solutions was not within the range pH 7.2 - 7*5 
it was adjusted to that range with sterile decinormal 
NaOH or HC1. 


F. Technique of Obtaining and Culturing Bone Marrow Cells 
On the day that was set aside for culturing, 
work was begun about $:00 or $:30 A.M. A rabbit was 
weighed and placed on the operating table. A solution of 
nembutal was then mixed up by dissolving 200 mgm. (con¬ 
tained in a capsule) of nembutal powder in 4 ml. of 
distilled water. The dose was 30 mgm. per kilo given by 
ear vein using No. 26 needle. It was found that this 
procedure did not require placing the rabbit in an 
anesthesia box, nor was transillumination of the ear 
necessary to show up the marginal vein. This amount of 
nembutal markedly reduced the muscle tonus but breathing 
was maintained at an adequate level and the rabbit was 
still sensitive to pain. While the full effect of the 
nembutal was taking place the hair on the anterior 
aspect of the neck was clipped and the area was swabbed

with 70 % alcohol or zepherin chloride. A tray of sterile 
instruments, syringes, needles, centrifuge tubes and the 

portable power saw were arranged near the operating 
table in readiness for the operation. 

Open drop ether was administered until the 
respirations became deep and steady and the rabbit insen¬ 
sitive to pain. The operator scrubbed but did not use 
gloves. A midline incision 7 - 10 cm. long was made with 
sterile scissors over the anterior aspect of the neck. 

Then using a fresh set of sterile forceps and scissors 
the wound was extended more deeply by dissecting through 
the adipose tissue, fascia and muscles down to the trachea. 
Dissecting to the right or left of the trachea one of the 
carotid arteries was exposed and dissected free for a 
distance of about 3 - 5 cm. The anesthetist then clamped 
the artery with a hemostat distal to and a bulldog proximal 
to the site of puncture. Holding the artery steady with a 
sterile pair of forceps the artery was punctured between 
the hemostat and the bulldog using a sterile 30 cc. syringe 
and No. 1$ gauge needle. The needle was aimed proximally 
with the bevel up during this procedure. As soon as the 
needle had been inserted about 1 - 2 cm. along the lumen 
of the artery the bulldog was released and then clamped 
over the part of the needle that was in the artery as a 
precaution against its slipping out. After 30 - 33 cc. 
of blood had been withdrawn the artery was clamped with a 
hemostat by the anesthetist proximal to the puncture. The 
syringe was then quickly withdrawn and the blood run into 
two sterile, 15 ml. ungraduated centrifuge tubes from which

the anesthetist had just removed the caps. Replacing the 
caps the centrifuge tubes were balanced by adding water to 
the retaining cups, placed in the centrifuge and spun at 
2000 r.p.m. for 15 minutes. This separated the plasma from 
the red cells. However, by this time the plasma had clotted 
so that the fibrin had to be freed from the walls of the 
tube with a sterile glass rod. The tubes were then replaced 
in the centrifuge and spun for another 15 minutes at 2000 
r.p.m, to pack the fibrin on top of the red cells thus 
giving a clear layer of serum on top. 

During this time the operator had clipped the 
hair over the right thigh and sterilized this area with 
alcohol or zepherin chloride. The anesthetist (McLuhan) 
then became the operator and the former operator (Nelson) 
became his assistant. The operator made a lateral incision 
over the right thigh extending from the knee to above the 
greater trochanter. The femur was exposed by dissecting 
between the anterior and lateral vasti. The muscles attached 
to the greater trochanter were severed and the head of the 
femur severed from all its connections. Placing a pair of 
bone forceps on the greater trochanter and exerting an 
upward pull the femur was freed of all its surrounding 
muscle and tissue distal to the knee. The shaft of the 
femur was scraped free of all tissue using a fresh 
sterile scapel. Placing bone forceps on the distal and 
proximal ends of the femur to stabilize it the portable 
power sarw with a sterile saw blade was used to saw the 
femur in half. Two or three ml. of Gey T s solution were

drawn into a 30 cc. syringe from a 15 ml. quantity in 
a 15 ml. centrifuge tube. Then the bone marrow (which 
was very red in the shaft of the rabbit femur as opposed 
to the yellow marrow in those of larger animals) of both 
halfs of the femur was aspirated into the syringe using 
the aspirator needle. This material was placed in the 
homogenizer. The syringe was rinsed out once with about 
1 ml. of Gey f s solution which was then added to the 
homogenizer. 

By this time the rabbit 1 s blood volume had 
been partially restored by the transfer of extra-vascular 
fluid to the vascular tree. Consequently another arterial 
puncture yielding about 30 - 40 cc. of blood could be 
made again. Usuall}?- the other carotid artery was used 
for this puncture. The blood was treated in the same 
manner as the first sample in order to obtain the serum 
from it. 

After the second arterial puncture the bone 
marrow was homogenized. This was accomplished by inserting 
the plunger in the homogenizer (see figure II) and working 
it back and forth with a slow!, rotating movement. The 
lumps of cells were squeezed between the rubber washer 
and the inside of the test tube and this way separated 
into smaller clumps. This process was continued until 
the mixture took on a homogenious appearance. This 
material was then added to the quantity of Gey f s medium

left in the 15 ml. centrifuge tube above. Replacing 
the cap on the tube the bone marrow suspension was 
centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for 15 minutes. This sep¬ 
arated the contents of the centrifuge tube into three 
portions. Uppermost was the fatty layer, in the bottom 
were the cells and between these two layers was the dilu¬ 
ting fluid. The fatty layer was pipetted off and dis¬ 
carded as well as all of the supernatant except a quantity 
equal to the volume of the cells in the bottom of the 
tube. Using a Wintrobe pipette the cells were evenly 
suspended in the remaining diluting fluid by repeatedly 
sucking the cells and fluid up into the pipette and 
squirting them back into the tube. This material was 
transferred to a Wintrobe tube and the centrifuge tube 
and Wintrobe pipette were rinsed out with a small quantity 
of Gey T s solution which was added to the Wintrobe tube 
as well. The Wintrobe tubes were centrifuged at 500 
r.p.m. for about 5 minutes and then 1500 r.p.m. for 10 
minutes. The layers in the Wintrobe tube from above down¬ 
ward were (Limarzi, 76) yellow fat, red fat, diluting 
fluid, myeloid-erythroid layer and on the bottom the 
mature erythrocytes. The fat and most of the supernatant 
were pipetted off and discarded. The myeloid-erythroid layer 
was transferred to a second Wintrobe tube and centrifuged 
again to separate further the mature red blood cells and 
the myeloid-erythroid layer. In the latter part of the 
project, however, this second centrifuging was dispensed

with in order to save time. The myeloid-erythroid layer 
was placed in a 15 ml. centrifuge tube containing about 
5 ml. of Gey’s solution. Using a Wintrobe pipette and 
repeatedly sucking the cells and fluid up into the pipette 
and squirting them back into the centrifuge tube the cells 
were evenly suspended in this diluting fluid. 

Employing a sterile white blood cell diluting 
pipette a nucleated cell count was done using a 1:20 
dilution with Vfo acetic acid. In this way the number 
of cells per cubic mm. was determined and the dilution 
factor necessary to give a final concentration of 1500 - 
3000 nucleated cells per cubic mm. in the cultures was 
calculated. 

The culture medium was prepared by mixing one 
part serum (prepared previously as above) and two parts 
diluting fluid. About 75 ml. of medium was prepared if 
four cultures of 15 ml. each were to be incubated. Using 
the dilution factor calculated above a quantity of the 
concentrated bone marrow suspension was added to the 
medium. The resulting suspension was thoroughly mixed 
and transferred to four culture bottles in the following 
manner. The culture bottles were named A, B, C, and D. 
With a 5 ml. graduated pipette, 5 ml. aliquots were 
withdrawn (while shaking the bottles containing the 
suspension continuously) and transferred to the flasks 
in this order A, B, C, D, D, C, B, A, A, B, C and D.

It was found early in the project that 
dividing the bone marrow suspension into four cultures 
by merely pipetting out one quarter of the original 
volume into four successive culture bottles resulted 
in wide variations between the cultures in concentrations 
of the cells. The above procedure gave more equal cell 
concentrations in all the cultures. 

At this juncture the material to be tested 
was added to 2 of the cultures and the other two were 
used as controls. Aseptic technique was observed through¬ 
out the above. 

From each culture bottle a red cell blood 
diluting pipette-full of the culture material was withdrawn 
after swirling the bottle by hand for about one minute to 
insure even suspension of the cells. At the same time 
a quantity from each bottle was drawn up to the 1 mark 
in four white cell diluting pipettes. Each of these 
quantities was then diluted 1:20 with 1% acetic acid. 

The four cultures were suspended in the constant tempera¬ 
ture water bath and incubated at 37.5° C. During the 
next two hours counts were made on the undiluted material 
in the red cell pipettes and on the diluted material in the 
white cell pipettes by the usual method of counting cells 
in a hemocytometer discussed in a previous section. In 
this way total and nucleated cell counts were obtained on 
each culture at zero time. Total and nucleated cell

counts were also made at 2, 4 and 6 hours. The pipettes 
were filled from the cultures at the same time so that 
the culture bottles were out of the bath at the same time 
and for the same period (usually 10 - 15 minutes). The 
counts were calculated in terms of percentage (zero hours 
being 100%) and graphed. The difference between the 
total and nucleated cell counts is the non-nucleated or 
mature red cell count. This was also expressed as a 
percentage and graphed. 

One worker did all the counting one day while 
the other worker cleaned and prepared the equipment for 
the next series of cultures. On the morning following 
the day that the cultures had been incubated the contents 
of the red cell pipettes, which had been kept overnight 
in the refrigerator were emptied individually on a watch 
glass and transferred to Wintrobe tubes. These tubes 
were centrifuged at 1500 r.p.m. for about 15 minutes and 
all the supernatant except a quantity equal to the volume 
of cells in the bottom of the tubes was withdrawn and 
discarded. The cells were suspended in the remaining 
diluting fluid and a smear ms made of this on a clean glass 
slide. These slides were marked with the culture bottle 
numbers and the time of incubation and then stored away 
for future reference. Ideally, these smears should have 
been made immediately after the counts had been done. 
However, there was not adequate time to do this in between

successive counts* Therefore the above procedure was 
followed realizing that changes could take place in the 
cell picture in the time that the pipettes were in the 
refrigerator* In spite of this these smears will have 
some value should they be referred to in the future. 

In some of the experiments liver extract 
or some other fortifying substance was used in place of 
serum* In these cases the medium consisted of Gey T s or 
Osgood T s solution alone and the correct quantity of 
concentrated bone marrow suspension necessary to give a 
concentration of 1500 - 3000 nucleated cells per cubic 
millimeter was added to this medium. This master sus¬ 
pension was then divided into four cultures in the 
manner described above. The substance to be tested was 
added at this juncture and the rest of the procedure 
followed was as above. 

In other experiments where serum was added 
to some cultures and liver extract, Amigen or to 
others as in rabbit No. 2? the medium for each individual 
culture was prepared separately in the culture bottles 
so that there was the same total quantity of medium 
(including the substance to be tested) in each culture 
bottle. Then the same quantity of concentrated marrow 
cell suspension was added to each culture bottle to give 
a concentration of 1500 - 3000 nucleated cells per cubic 
millimeter.

At the beginning of the project a number 
of cultures was made in which Gey f s solution equilibrated 
with 5$ carbon dioxide was used. The medium was equili¬ 
brated with an atmosphere of 5$ carbon dioxide and 95$ 
oxygen (carbogen). The cells were added to the culture 
and the atmosphere in the bottles was replaced with 
carbogen again. This was accomplished by inserting 2 
sterile needles through the rubber cork on a culture 
bottle and allowing carbogen (which had been run through 
a sterile cotton filter) to replace the air in the bottle. 
This procedure had to be performed after each use of the 
culture bottle. 

This medium was replaced by Osgood 1 s and 
later by the Gey f s solution suitable for work at atmo¬ 
spheric conditions for two reasons. Firstly, replacing 
the air in the culture bottle with carbogen was time 
consuming and secondly it was thought that the high 
concentration of oxygen might have a depressing action on 
the bone marrow cells even if such is at variance with the 
results of Rosin and Rachmilewitz (111).

SECTION VI 


RESULTS 

The results of 101 bone marrow cultures 
are presented. Ninety-four of these cultures were of 
rabbit bone marrow and 7 were of rat bone marrow. 

The actual cell counts at various intervals 
made on these cultures are presented in table form in 
Appendix II. The results are presented in graphic form 
in Figures III to XXIII of all the cultures except those - 
of rat bone marrow and those in which the cultures were 
followed over a period of about 21+ hours. The percentage 
values based on 100% at zero hours of the total cell counts,

nucleated cell counts and non-nucleated cell counts 
(red cell counts) are given in these graphs* The non- 
nucleated cell count is the difference of the total and 
nucleated cell counts. 


A. Initial Series of Cultures 

A preliminary series of cultures was carried 
out to standardize the technique of the chosen method of 
bone marrow culture. Emphasis was not placed on obtaining 
results in these cultures and accordingly the results of 
this series are not included. 


B. Duration of Culture Period 

It was desirable to determine early in the 
project the period during which the most marked multiplication 
of cells took place. A series of 12 cultures (SA - 13B 
Appendix II) was followed over a period of about 24 hours 
with this end in view. The culture medium in these cultures 
was 67$ Osgood T s fluid and 33$ homologous serum. 

In cultures ^A and £Bthe total cell count 
rose to its highest level at the end of 7 hours. The 
nucleated cells gradually increased over the 24 hour period 
and had a higher relative increase than either total or 
non-nucleated cells. In cultures 9A and 9B the total and 
non-nucleated cells reached a peak at the end of 12 hours

after which they dropped off. The nucleated cells with 
some minor fluctuations above the 100% level fell off 
during the culture period. In cultures 10A and 10B 
there was an initial rise in the total cells in the first 
$ hours (more marked in 10A) which was maintained or 
slightly increased over the next 16 hours. The nucleated 
cells were maintained at a constant level in 10 A and 
increased markedly in 10B by the twentieth hour. The 
non-nucleated cells reacted in an opposite manner to that 
of the nucleated cells (i.e., an increase in 10A and 
relatively little change in 10B). Cultures 11 A, 11B, 12A 
and 12B show much the same changes; namely, an initial 
increase followed by a decrease in the total and non-nuc- 
leated cell counts and an initial decrease in the nucleated 
cells followed by a persistence at approximately this new 
level. The total cells in 13 A acted in an almost opposite 
manner to those in 13 B. The nucleated cell counts 
however showed an initial increase in the first 6 hours 
followed by a slight decline. 

The overall interpretation of these results 
was that the major increase in cells (usually non-nucleated 
cells), when it occurred came in the first few hours of 
incubation. Therefore it was decided for technical reasons 
to restrict the culture period in subsequent cultures to 
five or six hours since the purpose of this project was to 
obtain the greatest possible growth in a short period of 
time and not to follow the course of the cells over as 
long a period of time as possible. 







C. Effects of Osgood’s and Gey’s Fluids each Reinforced 
with Homologous Serum. 

Osgood ($9, 90) and Plum (104) both recommend 
diluted serum as a good if not the best nutrient material 
for bone marrow cultures. Accordingly it was decided to 
incubate a series of cultures first using homologous serum 
diluted with Osgood’s medium and then homologous serum 
diluted with Gey’s medium. Figures III - V give the 
results of cultures using Osgood’s fluid and serum and 
Figures XIV, XXI (Rabbit 36 ) and XXIII give the results of 
cultures in which Gey’s fluid fortified with serum was used. 


1. Cultures with Osgood’s Fluid and Serum 

With the exception of 16A and 16B the culture 
medium in all this series was composed of 67% Osgood’s 
fluid and 33 % homologous serum. In 16A and l6Bthe 
proportions were 90 % and 10 % respectively. 

Marked increases in the non-nucleated cells 
in 14B and 1$A, less marked increases in 14A, 13 B and 17A, 
small increases in l6A, l6B, 17 A and 19A, minor fluctuations 
from the 100% level in 15A and 19B and a definite decrease 
in 1$B were observed. The changes in the total cell counts 
were for the most part similar to the changes in the non- 
nucleated cell counts but to a lesser degree. The nucleated 
cells decreased in 14A, 15A, 15B, 16A, 1?A, 17 B and 1$A 
and possible increases in 14B, l6B, 1$B, 19 A and 19 B of 
the nucleated cells were observed. The high 2 hour 











- 37 - 


nucleated cell count in 19B is probably a counting error. 

The growth in 16A and 16B is not as marked 
as the growth in some of the other cultures. 

These results indicate that definite cell 
growth usually occurred in serum-fortified Osgood’s 
medium. This growth was made evident by the increase 
in total cell population. The reduction of nucleated 
forms which occurred, in the face of a total cell increase 
introduced the interesting phenomenon which was to be 
noted frequently; viz., the reciprocal changes that 
appeared to occur between nucleated and non-nucleated forms. 
This point is discussed later. 

The data from these experiments do not permit 
conclusions to be made concerning the relative merits of a 
10 % and 33 % serum concentration. 


2. Cultures with Gey’s Fluid and Serum 

Figures XI?, X?, XVII, XVIII, XIX, XX, XXI, 
XXII and XXIII illustrate cultures 23 A, 23 B, 23 C, 23 D, 

29 A, 29 C, 31 C, 31 D, 32 A, 32 C, 33 A, 33 B, 34 C, 34D, 

35 A, 35 B, 36 A, 36 B, 37 A, 37 B, 38 A and 38 B which 

were all cultured in a medium of 67 % Gey’s fluid and 33% 

homologous serum. 







- 









A very good increase in the number of 
non-nucleated cells was obtained in cultures 29A, 29 C, 

32C, 33 A, 36 A and 37B, a moderate increase was obtained 
in 2SB, 23 D, 31C, 32A, 33 B, 34C, 35A, 35B, 36 B, 33A and 
33 B, a very slight increase was observed in 23 C, 31D 
and 37A and a decline or doubtful increase was seen in 
2$A and 34 D. Thus there were only 2 cultures of these 22 
in which there was not an apparent increase in the number 
of red cells. 

The total cell counts corresponded very 
closely to the non-nucleated cell counts except that the 
changes seen in them (total cells) were not so marked as 
in the non-nucleated cells. 

Cultures 23 C, 310 and 33A are the only three 
cultures in this series Where a decrease in the nucleated 
cell count was not fairly definite. In the rest of the 
cultures there were fairly definite decreases of varying 
degrees in the nucleated cells over the 6 hour period. 

In the three cultures mentioned as well as 34D, 37A, 3$A 
and 3$B where the nucleated cell count does not diminish 
(or at least not very markedly) it is noted that there is not 
a large increase in the non-nucleated count. In all of 
the cultures in which there was a good increase in the 
non-nucleated cell count there was an accompanying 
definite decrease in the nucleated cell count. This point 
was also noted in the previous section.

In comparing the results of these cultures 
which employed Gey’s fluid in place of Osgood’s it is 
seen that while the increases in non-nucleated cells in 
cultures using Gey’s fluid were never of the order of 
those seen in 14B and l&A which were cultured in Osgood’s 
fluid nevertheless there was a greater degree of consistency 
of growth (and also of the decreases in the nucleated cells) 
in those cultures employing Gey’s fluid. 


D. Effect of Liver Extract as Compared with Effect of 
Osgood’s Fluid Alone. 

Figures VI, VII, VIII, IX and X illustrate 
cultures 20A, 20 B, 21 A, 21B, 22A, 22B, 23 A, 23 B, 24A 
and 24B which were performed in Osgood’s fluid alone. 
With the exception of 23 A, 23B and 24B there was a 
definite decrease in all the cells with the greatest 
relative decreases being in the nucleated cell counts 
and the smallest in the non-nucleated cell counts. All 
the cells in 24B decreased in concentration but here the 
nucleated cells did not decrease in number as quickly as 
the nan-nucleated cells. In 23 A there was a slight 
increase in the non-nucleated cells and a moderate drop 
in the nucleated count. In 23B there was a moderate 
increase in the non-nucleated cells and a marked fall 


in the nucleated cells

From these results it appears that 
unfortified Osgood’s fluid is a poor bone marrow culture 
medium. 

In cultures 20C and 20D where 0.067 U.S.P. 
units of liver extract per ml. of culture medium was 
added all the cells and especially the nucleated cells 
were maintained at higher levels than they were in the 
control cultures (i.e., without liver extract) 20A and 
20 B. In 21 C and 21D where the concentration of liver 
extract is ten times the above only the nucleated cells 
were maintained at a higher level than were those in the 
controls. In 22D where the concentration is only one 
tenth that of 20C and 20D the non-nucleated cells were 
perhaps maintained at a higher level than those in the 
controls. The nucleated cells perhaps dropped off 
slightly more in 22G and 22D than in the controls (i.e., 
without liver) but otherwise little difference was seen 
between these cultures. The concentration of liver 
extract in 22Cand 22D was O.OO67 U.S.P. units per ml. 
of culture medium or 1/10 of that in 20C and 20 D. In 
23G and 23D where there was 0.13 U.S.P. units of liver 
extract per ml. all the cells were maintained at a higher 
level than were those in the controls. Definite increases 
in the non-nucleated and total cell concentrations took 
place. However, in 24C and 24D where the same concentration 
of liver extract was used it appears that only 24C showed

better growth (in terms of non-nucleated cells) than 
that seen in the controls. The growth curves of the 
cells in 24Dare very little different from those of 
24 A and 24 B. 

A review of all the graphs comparing growth 
in Osgood f s medium alone, with growth in Osgood T s medium 
fortified with liver extract, indicates a definite and 
beneficial effect of the liver extract on the cultures. 
But it is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the 
optimum concentrations of liver extract. 


E. Effect of Amigen and Liver Extract 

Osgood T s fluid alone contains no protein 
or amino acids from which new cells can be made. Amino 
acids in the form of Amigen were used to fortify Osgood’s 
fluid in 25 B, 26 B and 27 B and the effect was compared 
with the response obtained in control cultures 25A, 26A 
and 27A in which the medium was 67/6 Osgood’s fluid and 
33% homologous serum. Figures XI, XII and XIII illustrate 
these results. 

In 25B where 0.067 ml. of Amigen per ml. of 
culture medium was added the nucleated cells fell off very 
little in number and compared favorably with the control 
culture (25A). The non-nucleated and total cells on the 
other hand fell off sharpl^r as compared to those in 25A. 



- 92 - 


The nucleated cells in 26B where 0.01 ml. Arnigen per ml. 
of culture medium was added decreased in number somewhat 
more rapidly than those in 26 A and similarly with the 
non-nucleated and total cells in 26A. The nucleated cells 
in 27B where the concentration of Arnigen was the same as 
that in 26B seemed to increase more than the nucleated 
cells in 27A while the non-nucleated and total cells 
followed roughly the same course in the 2 cultures; namely, 
a slight to moderate decrease. 

A comparison of the graphs showing the effect 
of Arnigen in comparison with control cultures in Osgood T s 
medium indicates a deleterious influence of the Arnigen. 

The effect of Arnigen and liver extract 
combined in Osgood f s fluid was also tested in this series; 
namely, in 25C, 26G and 27D. In 250 there was about the 
same decrease in nucleated cells as that observed in 25B 
(Arnigen and 0sgood T s). Here the 0.067 U.S.P. units of 
liver extract per ml. of culture medium was added to the 
same concentration of Arnigen as in 25 B. The decrease in 
the non-nucleated and total cells was not as great as in 
25 B but there was also no increase in them as was observed 
in 25 A. 

0.15 U.S.P. units of liver extract per ml. of 
culture medium was added to 26G and 27D where the Arnigen 
concentration was the same as in 26B and 27B. The total 
cell and non-nucleated cell increases in 26G were better 
than those in either 26A and 26B. However, in 27D they

♦ 








- 93 - 


were poorer than those of 27A and 27B. The nucleated 
cell decrease in 26C was less than that of the Amigen 
culture (26B) but more than that of the control culture 
(26A). In 27D it would appear that the opposite was 
true. 

In 27C where liver extract (0.15 U.S.P. 
units per ml. of culture medium) was added alone the 
nucleated cell response was better than in any of those 
in 27A, 27B or 27D while the changes in the total cell 
concentration were roughly the same as those in 27A, 27B 
and 27D and the non-nucleated cell decrease more. 

These results show that in the presence of 
liver extract the deleterious effect of Amigen is less 
marked bhan when Amigen alone is added. The combined 
influence of Amigen and liver extract produces a growth 
which does not appear to be significantly better than 
the fortification resulting from the use of added serum 
alone, and probably is not as good. In other words, the 
presence of synthetic amino acids appears to act adversely 
on the culture, and while this influence is lessened by 
the presence of liver extract, the use of Amigen appeared 
to be contraindicated. 

F. Effect of Homologous Serum and Liver Extract 

Since liver extract had a beneficial effect 
when added to Osgood’s fluid alone the possibility 
presented itself that it might augment growth in cultures 



















■ 







- 94 - 


where the culture medium contained homologous serum. 

Figures XV and XVII illustrate experiments in which this 
possibility was tested. 

In 29B and 29B 0.15 U.S.P. units of liver 
extract per ml. of culture medium were added to the 
serum-fortified Gey T s medium. In 29B the increase in 
non-nucleated and total cells while present was noticeably 
less than that in the controls 29A and 290 (described 
above in G) but in 29D the increase was approximately the 
same as that in 29 A and 29 B. On the other hand the decrease 
in nucleated cells was less in 29B and about the same in 
29D as that in the controls. 

The concentration of liver extract in 31A 
and 31Bwas 0.0015 U.S.P. units per ml. of culture 
medium. The response of all the cells in 31B was similar 
to those of the controls (310 and 31 D which are described 
above in G). In 31A the response of the nucleated cells 
was much better, of the non-nucleated cells poorer and of 
the total cells about the same as those of the controls. 

The results indicated that in the concen¬ 
trations used liver extract has a slight deleterious or 
no effect on bone marrow cells cultured in serum-fortified 
Gey f s medium.

G. Effect of Foreign Serum and Liver Extract 

While operating on rabbit 30 insufficient 
blood was aspirated from which to obtain homologous 
serum to reinforce the culture medium in which the bone 
marrow cells from this rabbit were to be cultured* There 
was on hand serum from another rabbit killed the day before 
and this was used in this experiment instead of homologous 
serum* The culture medium therefore consisted of 67$ 

Gey T s fluid and 33$ foreign serum* 0.0013 U.S.P. units 
of liver extract per ml. of culture medium were added 
to 30C and 30D, Figure XVI illustrates these results. 

There was a good increase in the non-nuc- 
leated cells in 30 Band a moderately good increase in 
30A, The total cells in 30A fell off slightly and in 
30B they remained at an almost constant level. The 
nucleated cells dropped off in number in both 30A and 
30Bbut slightly more in 30A. 

The liver extract cultures 30G and 30D 
showed somewhat better responses in all the cells than 
those of the controls (30A and 30B) with perhaps the 
exception of the nucleated cells in 30C which decreased 
about the same as those in 30B. 

The indications are that liver extract added 
to Gey f s fluid fortified with foreign serum increases 
the erythropoiesis to a slight degree. Gey T s fluid 
fortified with foreign serum appeared to give a good 











- 96 - 


increase of red cells in the one experiment of this type. 


H. Effect of Human Serum 

Figures XVIII and XX show the effect of 
replacing the homologous serum in the culture medium with 
human serum. The cultures 32A, 32C, 34Cand 340 are 
described above in G. Cultures 32B and 32 D were cultured 
in 67$ Gey T s fluid and 33$ human serum from C.L.N. 34A 
and 34B were cultured in human serum from W.J.M. 

The initial absolute numbers of total cells 
in 32B and 32 D were less than those of the controls and 
the absolute numbers of the non-nucleated cells were also 
moderately less than those of the controls. As shown in 
Figure XVIII the nucleated cells in both cultures dropped 
almost precipitously from the very start of the culture. 
The numbers of total cells in these cultures also dropped 
off markedly especially in 32D. The non-nucleated cells 
however in the two cultures do not seem to behave in 
the same way with respect to one another. They decreased 
very markedly in 32 D but in 32 B they increased very 
noticeably above the 100$ level between the second and' 
fourth hours after which they dropped off to slightly 
below the 100$ level at the end of 6 hours. 

In 34A and 34B the absolute number of total 
cells and non-nucleated cells at the zero hour was very 












- 97 - 


much less than those of the controls (34Cand 34D) * There 
were hardly any red cells in these two cultures at the 
beginning of the culture period. The nucleated cells were 
of about the same concentration at zero hours in the four 
cultures shown in Figure XX, The nucleated cells fell off 
markedly in 34A and 34B as they did in 32B and 32D, The 
total cells also fell off in number in 34A and 34B but 
showed termina.! rises. There was a very noticeable increase 
in the numbers of non-nucleated cells in both 34A and 34 B , 
These are not shown in the graphs since the initial concen¬ 
trations were so low that it was thought that expressing 
the growth in relative terms in this case would give a 
false picture. 

The appearance of clumps of cells in all 
the cultures containing human serum as well as the devel¬ 
opment of a Tf clarity Tf in culture medium was noted after 
a short time of incubation in these cultures. 

It is concluded that the human serum 
agglutinated and hemolyzed the rabbit bone marrow and red 
cells to a variable extent even before the cultures were 
incubated. However it would appear from 34 A and 34B 
that red cells were being produced after the initial 
agglutination and hemolysis had taken place or that they 
were being produced faster than they were being agglutin¬ 
ated or hemolyzed. In other words while on one hand the 
human serum was agglutinating and hemolyzing the cells 
it was supplying nutrient materials on the other hand for

i. 









the production of new red cells, and reducing the mature 
erythrocyte population. The significance of the latter 
will be discussed later. 


I. Effect of Vitamin B-^ 

Figures XIX, XX and XXI show the effects of 
a culture medium of 67$ Gey*s solution and 33 % homologous 
serum reinforced with 0.0015 mgm. of Vitamin per ml* 
of culture medium as compared to control cultures in 67$ 
Gey T s fluid and 33$ homologous serum (described above in 
C). 

The responses of the non-nucleated cells and 
total cells of 33 C and 33 D were very similar to one another 
and the increases in them were of a degree lying between 
those observed in the control cultures. In other words 
one of the controls showed a better increase and the other 
a poorer increase in the number of total and non-nucleated 
cells than did the cultures 33G and 33D (containing 
Vitamin Bj^ 2) • The nucleated cell decreases were very 
similar in the four cultures. 

Cultures 34E and 34F (containing Vitamin B-^) 
showed decreases (with a slight increase at 4 hours) in 
all the cells comparable to the control culture 34 D . The 
responses in total and non-nucleated cells in 34C was 
much better than that of those in 34 E and 34F as well as 
those of control culture 34D. 

The variability between the respective 







control cultures does not allow any conclusions to be 
drawn with respect to the effect of Vitamin in the 

concentrations used. 


J. Effect of Siliconed Flasks 

Figure XXII shows the effects of culturing 
bone marrow cells in siliconed flasks. 

The non-nucleated and total cell increases 
were very similar to those of the controls 35 A and 35B 
(described above in G). The nucleated cells however did 
not fall off quite as much in the cultures in siliconed 
flasks as did those of the controls. 

Indications are that siliconed flasks main¬ 
tain the nucleated cell concentration at a higher level 
but that this effect is not marked. 


K. Results of Rat Bone Marrow Cultures 

The results of the rat bone marrow cultures 
are given in Appendix II. Of the seven cultures slight 
increases in non-nucleated cell counts were obtained in 
only three. The nucleated and total cell counts decreased 
in nearly all the cultures. Difficulty was encountered 
in obtaining sufficient blood from the rats from which 
serum could be obtained. 
















100 - 


These results showing unsatisfactory growth 
in the cultures indicate that the technio x ue of the method 
as developed for culturing rabbit bone marrow is perhaps 
not satisfactory for rat bone marrow.

SECTION VII 


DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

Preliminary work on this project on the 
accuracy of red cell counts indicated that there was a 
possible error in these counts (i.e., the average of the 
counts of two chamberfuls) of about 10The possible 
error in the nucleated cell count is probably higher 
because of the difficulty in determining whether some 
^cells” are actual nucleated cells or just debris* The 
possible error in the non-nucleated cell count is the 
largest because it is calculated from the above two and 
may therefore show the combined error. However, trends 










- 


























, 

' • 

: • • . 






























102 - 


reinforce the accuracy of previous counts so that if there 
is a persistent upward or downward trend in the cell counts 
over the culture period a fairly good degree of accuracy 
in the counts is indicated. 

In the early work on counting technique an 
attempt was made to express the results of counting in 
statistical terms. Successive counts made on a given 
suspension showed a coefficient of variation of 4.5% for 
all errors. Since duplicate counts were made on each 
culture It. seems unlikely that an error exceeding 10% 
would occur. Further, as already noted the trend of a 
culture based on serial counts at intervals, reinforces 
the figures for a culture at any one time. Such trends 
are in the main evident upon inspection of the graphs. 

Consideration of the accuracy of counting 
methods is of course crucial in the scientific evaluation 
of the results. This is especially so where marked or 
obvious cell growth did not occur. It is however not a 
purpose of this thesis to decide the limits of accuracy 
of the counting methods, but rather to lay the groundwork 
for developing a method of culture which would be so 
positive as to leave no doubt when growth did occur. 

The thesis thus deals mainly with the factors which might 
be important in assuring the greatest growth using the 
simplest method.

A. Duration of Culture Period 

The results of twelve cultures in the early 
part of the project (discussed in part B of Results) 
indicated that the major part of red cell production in 
vitro took place in the first few hours (approximately 
6-£ hours). There are several explanations as to why 
this initial production of red cells was not maintained. 
Some or all of the nutrient materials in the culture 
medium may have been exhausted in this time, or the 
stimulus for red cell production (Plum, 104) may not 
have persisted. The by-products of cellular metabolism 
may have altered the medium with respect to pH and thus 
interfered with erythropoiesis. With the production of 
new red cells the mounting concentration of red cells may 
have been a factor itself in slowing the erythropoiesis. 
This point is discussed later. A certain amount of 
hemolysis may have taken place with the liberation of 
free hemoglobin which has been thought by some to inter¬ 
fere with erythropoiesis. The conditions of the culture 
may have been more suited to the production of red cells 
from normoblasts than the production of normoblasts from 
immature erythroid cells. In this case when the initial 
generation of normoblasts had been exhausted erythropoiesis 
would have to be slox^red down to correspond to the pace 
at which normoblasts could be produced. The possibility 
of bacterial contamination with the production of toxins 
which may depress erythropoiesis must not be lost sight 





























- 104 - 


of. However gross bacterial contamination was observed 
only in one culture in the preliminary series the results 
of which were not reported and this reason is not regarded 
as being of much significance. 


B. Decrease of Nucleated Cells 

In the majority of the cultures the nucleated 
cells decreased. Since this decrease was always marked 
when there was a marked production of red cells (although 
there were times when they decreased in number when red 
cell production was not marked) it is believed that many 
of the nucleated cells were used up in the formation of 
red cells and that for some reason the multiplication of 
the nucleated cells did not keep pace with their utili¬ 
zation in erythropoiesis. 

Cairns and Lajtha (23) noticed a decrease 
in the white cell population in their cultures which they 
showed was due to adhesion of the white cells to the 
surface of the glass culture flask. Since these are 
nucleated cells such a phenomenon could assist in explain¬ 
ing the nucleated cell count drop. Cairns and Lajtha 
overcame this difficulty by using siliconed flasks, to 
the surfaces of which white cells did not adhere. Results 
shown in Figure XXII indicate that siliconed flasks are 
of some assistance in maintaining the nucleated cell count 
but that they are not the complete answer.

Leucocytes do not have a very long life 
span (especially the polymorphs) and their mortality 
during the culture period would also assist in lowering 
the nucleated cell count* Since differential cell counts 
were not made on the smears of the cultures taken at 
various intervals the importance of this phenomenon cannot 
be evaluated accurately. 


C. Density of Red Cells as a Factor in Limiting 
Erythropoiesis. 

There must be some mechanism in the body 
which normally keeps the bone marrow from producing 
more cells than are necessary to maintain a peripheral 
concentration of about 5,000,000 red blood cells per 
cubic millimeter. The possibility of such a mechanism 
operating in vitro has already been referred to in A 
above in that it may explain why erythropoiesis was not 
maintained at the initial rate for a longer period* 

The data were examined with this end in view and it was 
seen that even in these cultures where the initial 
concentration of red blood cells was high there was 
often a good erythropoietic response. However it is 
extremely difficult to assess all the factors at work 
in these cultures. It may be that, in those cultures 
where the initial red cell concentration was high, a

large percentage of the myeloid-erythroid cells were 
erythroid and that this explains the good erythropoietic 
response in the face of a high red cell concentration. 
Differential counts were not made on the myeloid-erythroid 
cells to establish this explanation. 

However further work has been carried on 
which is not reported in this thesis but which was guided 
by the above concepts. Results thus far indicate the 
use of a phytoagglutinin obtained from crude extracts 
of beans has permitted the development of cultures showing 
more consistent and higher rates of growth than those 
reported in this thesis. The possibilit^r that this more 
recent improvement in technique is due to the preferential 
reduction by agglutination of mature erythrocyte population 
exists. It is also possible that the residue of bean 
extract in the solution after agglutination has occurred 
may provide some beneficial nutrient to the cultures. 


D. Osgood T s and Gey’s Fluids Compared 

The amount of red cell formation obtained 
with Gey’s fluid fortified with homologous serum was 
more consistent than that obtained with Osgood’s fluid 
fortified with homologous serum. Consistency of results 
is exceedingly important because unless control cultures

have a fair degree of consistency between them it is 
difficult to draw any conclusions concerning the test 
cultures* The major difference between Osgood T s and 
Gey’s fluids is the presence of the bicarbonate ion 
in Gey’s fluid. Cameron (24) has stated that the 
bicarbonate ion is necessary in any culture medium 
because it is important in the glycolytic activity of the 
cells. The bicarbonate ion is also of use in buffering 
pH changes in the medium. For these reasons Gey’s fluid 
would appear to be superior to Osgood’s fluid in bone 
marrow cultures as a culture medium. 


E. Homologous Serum as a Nutrient 

The growth response in cultures containing 
homologous serum in the culture medium was in most cases 
very much better than in those where the culture medium 
was Osgood’s fluid alone. The results obtained with 
serum-fortified culture medium were also better on the 
whole than those obtained using media fortified with 
liver extract, Amigen or human serum. The conclusion 
reached is that homologous serum is a better nutrient 
fluid than any of the above. This is in accordance 
with Plum’s results (104) from which he concluded that 
native (homologous) serum gave the best results.

The question arises of variability between 
sera of different rabbits being the cause of the variation 
in red cell production in cultures of bone marrow from 
different rabbits. If pooled serum was used these var¬ 
iations in response may be reduced. In this case however 
the problem of storing the pooled serum for a period of 
time without deterioration would arise. Plum (104) found 
that "foreign”* serum (and pooled serum would be similar) 
gave on the average 15 % less growth than cultures con¬ 
taining the same amount of native serum (homologous). 

This extra 15 % production of red cells would presumably 
be lost by using pooled serum. There was not time to run 
a series of experiments to check this point. In the one 
rabbit in which foreign serum was used there was growth 
comparable to that obtained with homologous serum. 

Because homologous serum was readily available from the 
rabbit supplying the culture, and also because of Plum T s 
reported findings, homologous serum was used. 


F. Foreign Serum as a Nutrient 

No conclusions ce!n be drawn from the results 
concerning the relative merits of foreign and native or 
homologous serum. As stated above Plum (104) found that 

* That is serum from an animal other than that which 
provided the marrow cells. 








- 109 - 


native serum gave a 15$ better response in erythropoiesis 
than did foreign serum. It is noted however that the 

foreign serum and added liver extract gave a better 
response than foreign serum alone. Since liver extract 
did not improve the growth obtained with homologous 
serum it is possible that when added to foreign serum 
it supplies whatever is lacking in foreign serum and is 
present in homologous 'serum to give a better response. 
More data would be necessary in order to clarify this 
point. 


G. Human Serum as a Nutrient 

The agglutination and hemolysis of the 
rabbit red blood cells when they are cultured in a 
medium containing human serum is a serious disadvantage 
in using human serum, as a nutrient fluid for these 
cultures. However, Cairns and Lajtha (23) found that 
heating serum to 56° C. for an hour inactivated the 
agglutinins. If this procedure proves to be effective 
in removing the agglutinins human serum may be used to 
fortify the medium for the culture of rabbit marrow. 
Large amounts of serum could then be prepared with 
relative ease. 

Further attempts to use human serum may 


permit the direct comparison of erythropoiesis resulting 




no - 


from serum of normal and cancerous patients. This 
is the ultimate aim of this project. The investigation 
of methods to eliminate the agglutinins present in 
human sera are therefore important. 


H. Effects of Liver Extract, Amigen and Vitamin B^2 

The beneficial effect of liver extract in 
increasing erythropoiesis in vitro is in agreement with 
Plum T s results (104)* It is noteworthy that this bene¬ 
ficial effect was not manifest when liver extract and 
homologous serum were combined to fortify the culture 
medium indicating that the substances present in liver 
extract which increase erythropoiesis are present in 
homologous serum. 

A series of experiments was performed in 
an attempt to provide the amino acids which are presumably 
necessary in the production of red cells. These amino 
acids were provided in the form of Amigen. The results 
from this series showed that Aniigen had a deleterious 
effect on the bone marrow cells in the concentrations 
used. Perhaps amino acids provided in some other form 
would give better results. 

It is interesting to note that the dele¬ 
terious effect of Amigen was largely overcome by liver 


extract 










' 





- Ill 


The information concerning the effect of 
Vitamin was too limited to draw any definite 
conclusions. However clinical experience indicates that 
Vitamin has a similar effect on erythropoiesis to 
that of liver extract* Since the effect of Vitamin B^ 
in the above experiments was observed in a medium already 
fortified with homologous serum it is possible that a 
beneficial effect of the B^ was masked by the known 
beneficial effect of the serum. 

Early in this work the decision of whether 
to fortify the media with liver extract or with Vitamin 
B ^2 had to be made. It was concluded that since B^^ 
was relatively new at the time it would be safer to use 
liver extract, the ”in vivo tT erythropoietic responses 
of which were well known. 


I. Conclusions 

1 # It would appear that a simple and short-time method 
has been developed for the ”in vitro” culture of bone 
marrow in which erythropoiesis can be studied. 

2, The major erythropoietic response occurs in the 
first few hours permitting satisfactory observations over 
a six-hour period.

3. The most satisfactory erythropoietic response 
was obtained with a culture medium of Gey T s or Osgood T s 
fluids fortified with homologous serum. 

4. Attempts to improve the growth above the levels 
obtained with added serum using liver extract, Amigen and 
Vitamin B-^ were unsuccessful. 

5* It was in consequence impossible to employ a 
completely synthetic culture medium in which optimum 
growth could be obtained. The presence of serum appears 
to provide essential substances for maximum growth. 

6. Leads for future experimentation were obtained.
