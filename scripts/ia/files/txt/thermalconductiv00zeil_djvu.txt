Introduction 

Thermal conductivity determinations of napalm- 
gasoline mixtures varying in percentage concentration 
of napalm by weight from 0 to 10$ are given over the 
temperature range from -50°C to +50°C. The napalm used 
in the determinations had an amorphous structure and 
may he described as a basic aluminum soap of naphthenic 
acid, oleic acid, and coconut oil fatty acids prepared 
by co-precipitation from aqueous solutions. The weight 
ratios of the components are 25$ naphthenic acid, 25$ 
oleic acid, and 50$ coconut oil fatty acids. Mixtures 
of napalm and a commercial grade of gasoline yield 
high viscosity homogeneous liquids. 

A*hot-wire 1 technique similar to that suggested 
by Hutchinson^ for liquids, was adopted for this work. 
It has marked advantages in that small quantities of 
liquids are required and measurements are simple and 
rapidly obtained in contrast to other methods, e.g., 
that of Bates and co-workers5 Experimental det¬ 
erminations of the thermal conductivity of napalm- 
gasoline mixtures by this method are reliable to about 
2 $.

1. Method and Procedure 

(a) Principle of the Method 

The conductivity tubes used in this work differed 

from that described by Hutchinson' 1 ' in the use of a more 

rugged filament and the position of one of the side arms. 

These changes were required by the necessity of filling 

the tubes with napalm-gasoline mixtures that could not 

be poured. The main features are shown in figure 1. Tubes 

all 

of various diameters were used (table 1) but^dimensions 
except diameter were kept approximately the same.

incandescent lamp (resistance at 25°C about 25 ohms) was 
spot welded at each end to #18 tungsten wires. These were 
sealed into selected pyrex tubing so that the filament 
was under slight tension and lay as nearly as possible 
along the tube axis. The tungsten leads were spot welded 
at their external ends to #18 copper wires C and C 1 , All 
external wires were coated with water resistant lacquer. 

The internal and external diameters of the pyrex tubing 
were determined on a comparator and formed the basis on 
which selection of tubing for symmetry was made. The 
diameter and length of the filament spiral were also meas¬ 
ured with a comparator, the former before and the latter 
after sealing into the tubes. Important dimensions of 
several of the tubes are given in table I, 

For conductivity determinations a tube was filled 
with the test liquid to a level above the upper end of 
the filament, and immersed vertically in a constant temper¬ 
ature bath. A small steady current was passed through the 
filament. The required thermal conductivity was calculated 
from a knowledge of the bath temperature, the temperature 
of the filament and the power dissipation in it on attain¬ 
ment of thermal equilibrium, and the appropriate tube 
dimensions •

(b) Heat Transfer Equations and their Application 

Some of the features of the heat transfer analysis 

have been sketched hy Hutchinson**- hut there are errors 

*- 

in his basic equations. In the following analysis, based 
on the conductivity tube described in the previous sec¬ 
tion, the main symbols used and their definitions are: 
k,k T : the thermal conductivity of the test liquid 

and of pyrex glass respectively (cal/sec/cm 

/PC) 

Q : the heat produced per second in the filament 

foal.) 

P : the power dissipated in the filament (watts);

Tf,,T 0 : the temperature of the filament, that at the 
liquid-pyrex interface, and that of the bath

see equation 7) 

If it is assumed: 

(a) that heat losses by conduction through the filament 
leads are negligibly small, 

(b) that convection currents are absent in the liquid, 

(c) that no temperature discontinuities occur at solid- 
liquid interfaces, and 

(d) that the conduction of heat through the liquid is 
entirely radial, then it follows that for a state of 
thermal equilibrium,

Determination of filament temperature in practice 
is conveniently made by resistance measurement* It is 
therefore desirable to replace temperature in equation 
(2) by the corresponding resistance function. Since the 
temperature differences involved are less than 5°C (see 
table YII, appendix IY) one may write to a high degree

Consequently the thermal conductivity k can he calculated 
from the determined values of P and Bp, and known values 
of B 0 ,od 0 ,G, and J, provided the initial assumptions are 
valid (appendix IY), 

In practice it is convenient to make the calcula¬ 
tions in a somewhat different way (see procedure) and 
for this purpose equation (5) may he rewritten, 

P = kG «B-p - kG .(6)

because of the temperature drop across the pyrex walls 
of the tube, and vanish if it is disregarded. It is 
apparent from equations ( 2) and (5) that, 



Tf - T 0 ; k’ .ln(r ± /v t ) 
k .in(r 0 /rj) 


Hence the ratio of the drop across the pyrex walls to 
the drop he tween the filament and the hath is indepen¬ 
dent of the power Input, hut does depend upon tube 
dimensions and upon the conductivity of the test liquid. 
Some examples of the temperature drops in the experiments 
are given in table YII, appendix IV. 

As will appear later (appendix IV), there is evi¬ 
dence that convection effects are present under certain 

conditions. The radial temperature gradient at a distance 
r from the tube axis is given by, 

= -— -J? — ..(10) 

dr 36 #30 hkr 

The gradient is a maximum at the filament spiral. One 
might expect the tendency to set up convection currents 
to be greatest with tubes having very small diameter 
filament spirals, using high filament power, and con¬ 
taining liquids of low thermal conductivities and vis¬ 


cosities

The tube constant J enters the calculation only 

through a small correction term, hut errors in G- cause 

similar errors in k. For this reason, in calculating J, 

the value 0,00261 cal/sec/cm/°C used for the thermal 

7 

conductivity of pyrex glass need not he known accurately. 
Since rj_ and enter logarithmically, errors introduced 
hy inaccuracies in aligning the filament spiral along 
the tube axis are a relatively minor matter except possib¬ 
ly with very small diameter tubes. The uncertainty in h 
is of more importance. Under tension the filament spiral 
is opened out for a short distance near each weld and 
one cannot say accurately what value should be used for 
the effective spiral length. Mainly because of this, the 
error in 0 may be as high as 4$, as calculated from tube 
geometry. Once the validity of the method is established 
however (appendix IY) , more accurate values of G- may be 
obtained by standardizing the tubes with known liquids, 
i.e, adjusting G to give the accepted conductivity value. 
For the work of this paper the conductivity tubes were 
standardized with glycerol at a temperature of 25°C to 
give Sates' value 2 of 0.000680 cal/sec/cm/°G (see section 
2 ).

(c) Apparatus 

The oonstruotion of the apparatus, used for main¬ 
taining temperature constant in the range from -50°0 to 
4*50°C, was as follows; 

In the temperature range from 0°0 to 50°C the con¬ 
ductivity tubes were immersed in a hath of water contained 
in a metal tank insulated from the surroundings by a wood¬ 
en box. The temperature points 25°C and 50°G were main¬ 
tained by means of an incandescent lamp, adjusted to 
dissipate about 120 watts of its 200 watt maximum, activ¬ 
ated by a mercury thermostat control (scale diagram fig,2) 
working against the tendency of the bath to lose heat to 
the surroundings. The bath was maintained at 0°C by ice 
placed directly into the water. The temperature of the 
bath was read to 0.01°C from a mercury thermometer that 
had been calibrated against a certified standard with due 
attention to stem correction. This value did not enter 
into the calculation of thermal conductivity except inso¬ 
far as it specified the temperature at which the determin¬ 
ation was made , 

For the low temperature (-25° and -50°C) ?/ork 
extensive modifications were necessary in the thermostat 
apparatus. Denatured alcohol, rather than water, was used 
as the bath liquid and was contained in a double-walled 
insulated tank of about 3 litres

eapaoity with a tightly fitting top. It was stirred "by a 
motor-driven paddle situated at one end. The hath was 
maintained at the desired temperature points hy means 
of a 45 ohm heating coil of § 27 B.& S. nichrome wire 
activated hy a toluene thermostat (fig.5) and working 
against the tendency of a 1 cooling-tube * device to 
lower the hath temperature. The coil was mounted near 
the bottom of the tank close to,the stirrer and in op¬ 
eration dissipated about 15 watts. The 1 cooling-tube', 
mounted near the other end of the tank and extending 
through the top, consisted of a metal cylinder of about 

6.5 cm diameter containing a second cylinder of about 

4.5 cm diameter. Both cylinders contained solid carbon 

dioxide in acetone, and their cooling effect on the bath 

was controlled by raising or lowering either with the 
' c 

aid of s^rew adjustments. See figure 4 for the disposi¬ 
tion of the components in the bath tank. The temperature 
of the bath was read to 0.01°G by means of a pentane 
thermometer and controlled to better than ±0,01°C by the 
toluene thermostat. The readings of the thermometer did 
not enter the calculation of thermal conductivity except 
insofar as it specified the temperature at which the 
determination was made. 

The specially designed and constructed thermostat 
control was mounted near the stirrer; it is shorn

diagrannuatically in figure 3, The main hulh (C), about 
80cc capacity, was built in the shape of a grid to 
minimize temperature lag in the control. The capillary 
tube (F), containing mercury to make electrical contacts, 
was 0.75 mm in diameter. The make-and-break contact (D) 
consisted of a § 58 B.& S. tungsten wire (E) that could 
be raised or lowered in relation to the mercury surface 
by means of a screw adjustment. The control Was set in 
operation by allowing it to come to equilibrium with 
the bath at the desired temperature and closing the stop 
cock to the toluene reservoir. The grid bulb of the 
thermostat was filled with toluene selected from a num¬ 
ber of low freezing point organic liquids because of its 
high thermal expansion and the fact that it had no 
tarnishing effect on a mercury surface. This latter 
effect was important since its presence on the surface 
of the mercury in the capillary reduced the sensitivity 
of the thermostat (in the case of a trial test with 
heptane in the grid bulb) to such a degree that the temp¬ 
erature control was reliable only to about ± 1°C. 

With the apparatus described above, no variation 
of the thermometer readings at the temperature points 
50°C, 25°C, 0°G, -25°C, and -50°C was detectable over a 
period of several hours and no evidence of fluctuation 
m hath temperature was detected in the electrical

measurements made. 

The actual circuit diagram of the electrical 
apparatus described below is shown in figure 6, The prin- 

meatureroeut 

ciple of the method of A filament resistance^and power 
dissipation may be seen from the simplified circuit of 
figure 5 below. The filament is represented by F. D rep¬ 
resents an accurately known slightly smaller resistance 
of negligible temperature coefficient, and AB is a suit¬ 
able bridge wire , The filament current was just that 
passing through D and AB, and was adjustable by means 
of a resistance C in series with a 6 volt storage bat¬ 
ter y. In practice only 4 volts was applied to the bridge 
circuit. On interchanging F and D, the bridge balance 

point was shifted by an 
amount n l” cm on the 
slide wire such that, 6

where a denotes the 
resistance per cm 
length of the bridge wire. This result is independent of 
any contact resistances or stray e.m.f.’s in the circuit 
provided that they remain constant during a test. The 
potentiometer circuit connected across D in the diagram 

provided a means for measuring the voltage drop across 

CVd) 





and also across F when the two were interchanged.

Measurements of and Yf were required for the determin¬ 
ation of filament power dissipation. A Leeds and Northrup 
Students Potentiometer with a certified standard cell was 
used, and the voltages were measured with a precision of 
0.05$ or letter. The galvanometer (0) had a sensitivity of 
about 1.3 uv/ram. S, Q, C, and D were resistance boxes with 
manganin coils. 

The bridge was specially designed and constructed 
for this type of work (Langstroth et al, unpublished). The 
bridge wire was 1 metre long and its resistance was deter¬ 
mined to be 0.005615 ohms/em. Consequently a shift of 1.00 
cm in the balance point on interchanging F and D was assoc¬ 
iated with a difference of 0.005615 ohms in their resist¬ 
ances. With the smallest filament currents used (about 
0.010 amperes) a galvanometer deflection of more than 1 mm j 
resulted from putting the bridge 1 mm off ba3.ance, and 
with higher currents the balancing sensitivity was greater. 

An important feature of the bridge was the mercury 
rocker switch used on interchanging F and D. It consisted 
of two roY/s of eight mercury cups each. A flick of the 
switch handle brought one row or the other into operation. 
The connections made by the switch in its two positions 
are indicated in figure 6. In the design care was taken 
to minimize any possible resistance changes that might

be introduced by the smtch itself on change in its 
position. Aside from the interchange of F and D and their 
leads, resistance change on changing switch position 
could not have been greater than 0.0004 ohms. The leads 
from the bridge to F and D differed in resistance by less 
than 0.00005 ohms. This factor was important since any 
difference in lead resistance was included in the meas¬ 
ured difference (Kf-Ra). 

Resistance box D was calibrated against standards 
using a potentiometer method. The precision was iO.OOOB 
ohms for the 1 ohm and smaller coils, and +0.001 ohms for 
the larger. The resistance per cm of the slide wire was 
determined by a standard bridge^ and by a potentiometer 
method; the precision was 0.05$. No variation in this 
resistance was detected when the bridge current was var¬ 
ied over the range used in the experiments. The bridge 
wire had been calibrated for uniformity along its length 
and appropriate corrections were made in subsequent 
re adings, 

id] Procedure 

The adjustment of the apparatus for maintaining 
the temperature constant and the procedure for determin¬ 
ing thermal conductivity were as follows*. 

In the temperature range from 0° to 50°C the points

25°C and 50°C were attained "by raising the temperature 
of the water hath with the aid of the 200 watt lamp and 
hot water# The desired temperature point was maintained 
hy placing the thermostat control (fig* 2) in operation 
"by allowing it to reach thermal equilibrium and shaking 
the excess mercury above the cap dliary into the reser- 
voir# The temperature point 0°0 was reached and main¬ 
tained by placing ice directly into the water bath. 

Tor the work at -25°0 and -50°C the temperature 
of the bath of denatured alcohol (fig. 4) was initially 
low red by filling the primary cooling cylinder (E) with 
solid carbon dioxide in acetone. In this manner the temp¬ 
erature points -25°C and -50°C were reached in about 25 
and 50 minutes respectively. When the desired temperature 
was reached the secondary cooling cylinder (D) was inser¬ 
ted and filled with a similar cooling mixture. The cool¬ 
ing cylinders were then adjusted to reduce the rate of 
cooling of the bath liquid to a small value (i.e. one 
that was easily offset by a power dissipation of about 
15 watts in the heating coil) when the heating coil (T) 
was inactive. At this stage the adjustable tungsten wire 
(T of fig. 3) of the toluene thermostat was lowered 
nntil it just made contact with the mercury in the cap¬ 
illary and the thermostat placed in operation by closing 

the stop cock to the toluene reservoir. 

Tilling the conductivity tubes with viscous liquids, 
such as napaim-gasoline mixtures, required care to avoid

"breaking the filament or including bubbles of gas. One 
method used was to immerse carefully the lower side arm 
of the tube in the liquid and to connect the upper arm 
through a T-joint to a vacuum pump. The third arm of the 
T-joint led through rubber tubing to the open air. By 
partially closing a pinchcock on the rubber tubing, the 
pressure in the conductivity tube was reduced under close 
control, and the liquid forced slowly up into the tube 
by the outside air. The tube was filled to a level of 
about 1 cm above the upper end of the filament. Another 
method, using a 10 cc hypodermic syringe, provided better 
control of the rate of filling the tube and thus avoided 
entirely the chance of a filament breakage. 

The tube with both side arras corked, was immersed 
vertically in the bath liquid at the desired constant 
temperature and its leads connected in the bridge circuit 
assuming the position F in fig.5, A current of about 
0.010 amperes was passed through the filament and thermal 
equilibrium was attained in 2-3 minutes as shorn by the 
constancy of filament resistance measurements with time. 
Four readings were made of the shift T, l” in balance point 
on interchanging F and D, and the voltage drops Vf and 
Vd across F and B were determined with the potentiometer. 
This procedure was repeated with three additional current

minations for one sample required 20-50 minutes* 

The ql I (Rf-Rd) value was calculated for each 
current from the mean of the "1 TT readings corrected for 
non-uniformity of the bridge wire* Since the balance 
shifts were in general 35 cm or greater, the ql values 
had a precision of 0*1$ or better* The power dissipation 
values were calculated from P I Yf*Yd/Rd with a preci¬ 
sion of 0*1$ or better* The following figures illustrate

g, Results 

A discussion of convection and the validity of 
the method and a consideration of heat loss hy conduc¬ 
tion through the leads are given in appendices IY and 
II respectively. As stated previously in section l.(b), 

G values calculated from equation (3) and tube dimensions 
may have rather large errors due to the uncertainty in 
the measured value of h. For the thermal conductivity 
determinations of napalm-gasoline mixtures the tubes 
were standardized with glycerol at B5°C assuming Bates* 

g 

value , Individual determinations of the thermal conduc¬ 
tivities of glycerol, using G values calculated from 
equation (3), are given in table II. The ql vs P plots 
shown in figure 7 are accurately linear in accordance 
with equation (6). 

Thermal conductivity measurements were made on 
freshly mixed and aged samples of napalm-gasoline mix¬ 
tures some of which were about four months old. Ho de¬ 
pendence of thermal conductivity on age was detected. 
Individual determinations for tubes 3 and 10 are given 
in table III together with the age of the mixture. The 
final averaged results are presented in table IY with¬ 
out distinction as to the age of the mixture. The latter 
values are presented graphically in figure 8 as plots of 
thermal conductivity vs napalm concentration at the

temperahure points 50°, 25°, 0°, -25°, and -50°C. The 
results for gasoline, obtained with a small diameter 
tube (#7 of table I), agree fairly well with the values 
found by extrapolation of the thermal conductivity vs 
concentration curves to zero concentration. They are 
shown in tables III and IV. 

Due to the low viscosity of gasoline the presence 
of convection in the tubes (appendix IV) causes an app¬ 
arent abnormal increase in the thermal conductivity coeff¬ 
icient as calculated from equation (8), except possib¬ 
ly for narrow diameter tubes such as tube 7 of table I. 

¥or this reason measurements on gasoline (i.e. napalm 
concentration zero) with tubes 7, 5, 10, and 3 in order 
of increasing diameter, were made at the temperatures 
0°, 25°, and 50°C in order to determine the variation 
of the apparent thermal conductivity coefficient with 
tube diameter and with temperature. Plots of ql vs p 
for gasoline at 2^0 shown in figure 9, yielded curves 
markedly concave upwards for the wider tubes and, as 
would be expected (appendix IV), yielded a straight 
line for the narrow diameter tube 7. The marked concav¬ 
ity upwards for the wider tubes and the resultant high 
values of the apparent thermal conductivity obtained 
must be attributed to the effects of convection (appen¬ 
dix IV)• Table V gives the thermal conductivity values

5. Discussion 


- 32 - 


The thermal conductivity measurements on gasoline 
at different temperatures and with various diameter tubes 
indicates that the method as used is not valid for low 
viscosity liquids, except possibly for small diameter 
tubes, in agreement with the work of previous investiga¬ 
tors (e.g. Langstroth et al, unpublished; see appendix 
IY), but contrary to the view originally expressed by 
Hutchinson 1 * A consideration of the heat loss by con¬ 
duction through the leads (see appendix II; method due 
to Gregory and Archer 8 ) indicated that less than 0*4$ 
of the total heat dissipated by the filament was so lost* 
The individual determinations of thermal conduct¬ 
ivity given in table III for the napalm-gasoline mixtures 
are reliable to about 2$. The averaged values (tablelY) 
for the temperature range from -50°C to +50°C and for the 
concentration range from 0 to 10$, are given with an 
accuracy of about 1$ by the relation, 

k x 10 5 z 29.7 - 0.068T + 0.11C *..**.(12) 

where T and C denote respectively the temperature (°C) 
and the concentration ($) of the napalm by weight. The 
extremely small dependence of k on C is noteworthy in 
view of the marked differences in some of the physical 
properties of the mixtures. Also of interest, is the 
fact that the thermal conductivity is independent of the 
age of the mixtures.

II* Heat Loss by Conduction through the Leads 

The following calculation of the heat loss by con- 

duction through the tungsten leads is based on a method 

8 

described by Gregory and Archer • It is assumed that 
convective heat loss is negligible (appendix IY) and that 
the adjacent coils of the tungsten spiral filament have 
no effect on each other due to the temperature gradient 
along the length of the filament* Since the heating 
currents used in the experiments were small it is likely 

the 

that the latter assumption holds and that^amount of heat 
passing directly; between adjacent coils is negligible in 
comparison to that conducted along the wire of which 
the filament spiral is composed* Then, insofar as the heat 
conduction along the filament is concerned, the problem 
may be considered by replacing the original coiled filamen

III, The Temperature Coefficient of Resistance of Tungster 

Filaments 

Thermal conductivities considerably higher than 

* 

the accepted values -were obtained for know liquids on 
using a temperature coefficient of resistance of tungsten 
(oL a , equation 8) of 0,004661 at 25°C 9 , Subsequent 

measurements, by the methods described below, of the 
coefficient for the spiral filaments (said by the makers 
to be tungsten) taken from new 40 watt Mazda and SoTex 
lamps, showed the X.C.T. values to be nearly 22$ too high. 
Method A ; Bridge measurements (equation 11) were made of 
the resistance of a filament covered with a thin coat of 
lacquer and immersed in the constant temperature water 
bath. The constancy of the determinations when the cur¬ 
rent was varied showed the filament to be closely at the 
bath temperature which was read to 0,01°0 from the bath 
thermometer# The resistance was again determined at a 
bath temperature 2 to 8°0 higher or lower. The coeffi¬ 
cient for a bath temperature T 0 within the range was 
calculated from, 

f*l - T 2 )R 0 

In this way the coefficients were calculated at 
0°, 25°, and 50°C, For the low temperatures (-25°C and

tance were made, In this case the temperature determina¬ 
tions were made hy means of a copper-constantan thermo¬ 
pile (3 couples of #28 B.& S, wire) calibrated at the 
solid carbon dioxide point and the ice point. 

Method B: values obtained by extrapolation of ql vs p 

curves of conductivity measurements at 50°, 25°, 0°, -25? 
and -50°C were plotted against the corresponding T 0 values 
These plots for tubes 3 and 10 are shown in figure 11 to 
approach linearity * This is verified by equation (13) 

| in which the coefficients of the higher powers of (T + 50) 
are small* The temperature coefficients of resistance were 
calculated from the slopes of the lines and known R 0 value;; 
at each temperature point. 

The temperature coefficient of resistance values 
determined from methods A and B are shorn in table YI and 
may be calculated in the temperature range from -50°C to

IV* The Validity of the Method 

The validity of the method has been investigated 
previously (Langstroth et al, unpublished)» If the assump 
tions of radial conduction and the absence of convection 
and temperature discontinuities are valid, then (a) the 
Rf vs P plots should be linear, and (b) the conductivitie 
determined from known liquids should agree with accepted 
values* Hutchinson^ reported that both criteria were 
fulfilled, but it was found that under some conditions 
they were not* Hutchinson's tube differed from those in 
this work in the use of a smaller filament spiral - a 
diameter of 0*008 cm as compared to 0*0200 cm - and in 
the placement of both side arms near the top of the tube* 
The evidence (Langstroth et al, unpublished) presented 
below shows that convection was present under some cir¬ 
cumstances in their experiments, but that otherwise the 
basic assumptions of the method are valid* 

A typical plot of ql vs P for acetone in a tube 
of about 1 cm diameter is shown in figure 12* The curve 
was not linear but was concave upwards* Furthermore f k 

values calculated for individual points by equation (5) 

s 

were higher than the accepted value* and exhibited an 
increase with increasing filament temperature and temp¬ 
erature gradients in the liquid* Such results strongly 
suggest the presence of convection*

Fig .12 : A plot of ql (i.e. Rf-R^) against power dissipa¬ 
tion for acetone at 24,87°C, The internal diameter of 
tube 2, with which the determinations were made, was 
1.266 cm (see table I). The determinations denoted by 
© and + are in close agreement, but the curve exhibits 
a marked concavity upwards.

In table YII are given typical apparent k values 
for liquids of various viscosities, with tubes of differ¬ 
ent diameters, and various power dissipations. These value* 
were calculated from individual determinations with the 
aid of equation (3). In figure 13 the data are presented 
graphically as apparent k vs P plots. The grade of the 
substances and some details are given in table Yin ( for 
gasoline and napalm-gasoline mixtures see section on 
introduction). 

The following points were clearly shown: 

(a) with viscous substances (glycerol and napalm-gasoline) 
the k values were independent of power dissipation and 
tube diameter, and for glycerol they agreed with the 
accepted thermal conductivity value. 

(b) with liquids of low viscosity (water, ethyl alcohol, 
acetone, and gasoline) the apparent k values with large 
tubes decreased with decreasing power input; this effect 
became steadily less as the tube diameter was decreased, 
until with the smallest tubes used it practically vanish¬ 
ed and the k value approached the accepted thermal con¬ 
ductivity. 

There was little doubt that: 

(1) this behavoir was caused by convection in the low 
viscosity liquids, 

(2) with viscous liquids or very small tube diameters

convection effects were negligible, and 

(5) the method was applicable with safety to mixtures of 
napalm-gasoline. 

Similar conclusions were drawn from the data 
presented in figure 14 in which the ratios of the apparent 
to the accepted conductivities were plotted against tube 
diameter* Unlike the data of table YII and fig* 13, they 
were based on values obtained from the slopes of "best 
lines" drawn through the points of ql vs P plots (cf* 
figure 7 and 12), and equation (8)* They were average 
values for several experiments* As in table YII data, the 
G values were f&und from equation (3)* It was seen that 
the percentage departure of the ratio from unity was 
greater for ethyl alcohol than for water, although the 
former had about twice the viscosity of the latter at 
25°0. The temperature gradients in alcohol were however, 
greater than those in water because of the low thermal 
conductivity, and this fact also played a part in det¬ 
ermining the tendency toward convection.

All k values -were calculated using a G value determined 
from equation (3) and for the reason pointed out in page 9 
some tubes may give consistently high values and some 
consistently low values.

was determined to be 1.357 gm/ml. From this figure and 
standard density data 10 it was concluded that the glycerol 
contained less than 2$ water. Bates 5 found that the therm¬ 
al conductivity of glycerol containing less than 5% water

glycerol is 0.00070. In standardization, the value 0.00068( 
was used. 

The viscosity of glycerol at 25°C is about 590 cent- 
ipoises. 

Water : The water used had been distilled in pyrex. Bates 
found the thermal conductivity at 25°C to be 0.00143 
cal/sec/cm/°C. The viscosity at 25°C is about 0.9 cp. 

Ethyl Alcohol : Ordinary laboratory grade ethyl alcohol 

4 

was used. Bates found the thermal conductivity of alcohol 
containing 0$ and 5 fo water to be respectively 0.00042 and 
0.00045 cal/sec/cm/°C at 25°C. No attempt was made to 
determine the water content of the alcohol. The viscosity 
of alcohol at25°C is about 1.7 cp. 

Acetone ; Ordinary laboratory grade acetone was used. The 

thermal conductivity as given by the International Critical 
11 

Tables is 0.00043 cal/sec/cm/°C at 25°C. The viscosity 
of acetone at this temperature is about 0.3 cp.
