Methods of Analysis for Solanine 
in Tubers of Solanum tuberosum 


(Abstract) 

The problem of bitterness in table potatoes 
caused by the glycoalkaloid solanine is causing some concern 
in the Province of Alberta* Before a comprehensive study 
of causal factors could be undertaken, it was essential to 
develop a relatively short method of quantitatively estimat¬ 
ing the solanine content of a sample of tubers* The inves¬ 
tigational work reported in this paper was carried out in 
an effort to obtain such a short analytical method* 

No pure solanine could be obtained through 
commercial channels, so it was necessary for the author to 
isolate and purify the compound as a prerequisite to the in¬ 
vestigation* 

An analytical procedure was evolved, by an 
amalgamation of two existing methods, which was used as a 
Standard Method in this study* An electrophotometer was 
available which made possible the use of the proven colori¬ 
metric method of solanine estimation from the potato extract* 

Unsuccessful attempts were made to estimate 
the solanine content of potatoes by: using qualitative re-

agents on fresh tuber slices; a simplification of the regular 
extraction procedure; measuring the fluorescent intensity 
of solanidine, a product of solanine acid-hydrolysis; and 
extraction from dried tuber material. 

Late in the present investigation, a shortened 
analytical technique for solanine determination in potato 
tubers was developed. Use of this method enables the inves¬ 
tigator to complete a duplicate analysis within 36 - 40 hours, 
which is about one-third as much time as that required by 
the older methods. Fresh tuber material was extracted in 
a Soxhlet extraction apparatus, using acidified 95 per cent 
ethyl alcohol as the solvent. The solanine content of this 
extract was estimated colorimetrically. Careful application 
of this procedure yields good results that are more consistent 
than those obtained using the Long Standard Method. 

Statistical analysis of duplicate solanine 
determinations gave a tf t tf value of only 0.03 for thirty de¬ 
grees of freedom. The standard error of the method 
® * 0.154 mg. of solanine per 100 gm. of fresh tuber tissue. 
These figures strongly indicate the reliability of the method. 

It is hoped that this shortened and simplified 
technique for solanine analysis of potato tubers will prove 
useful to other workers in this field.

INTRODUCTION AND LITERATURE REVIEW 

For various reasons, the variety Netted Gem 
is the most important potato variety grown commercially in 
the Province of Alberta. One of these reasons is that 
Alberta-grown "seed" of Registered and Certified Netted Gems 
commands a premium in Idaho, where this variety is very 
popular. Another reason for the popularity of this variety 
in Alberta is the fact that it is resistant to Common Scab 
and will normally produce a crop of clean, very attractive 
tubers. 


This potato variety is not without its short¬ 
comings. It is not the highest quality table potato that can 
be grown at this latitude, although its quality is rated as 
good. The reason that the author became particularly inter¬ 
ested in the Netted Gem variety was the fact that consumers 
often complained about the bitter flavor of Alberta potatoes 
purchased through regular channels. These complaints have 
resulted in sales losses and could easily result in serious 
acreage reductions, with attendant hardships to the potato 
grower. 

Experimental work to date has resulted in 
many statements that are often contradictory regarding causal 
factors. It has been quite generally agreed that the specific 
bitterness in question is caused by the glycoalkaloid

solanine. This complex is apparently present in all potato 
tubers, but normally comprises a very small proportion of 
the tuber. In some seasons, at least a portion of the crop 
will have a very acrid flavor, and upon analysis show a higher- 
than-average solanine content. 

From a critical study of solanine research 
already reported, it is apparent that this problem is rather 
complex. The first study that suggested itself was an ex¬ 
haustive attempt to abbreviate the long, tedious analytical 
methods in present use. It was almost essential to have at 
least a relatively short method of quantitative analysis be¬ 
fore a really comprehensive study of causal factors could be 
commenced. The two most important analytical methods in use 
to date require from three to five days in order to complete 
duplicate analyses. Also, so many individual steps are in¬ 
volved that the probability of errors is very great.

Chemical Nature of Solanine 

(a) Brief Description of Alkaloids - 

Gortner (15) says that, because of their 
physiological properties, alkaloids have, for ages past, 
interested mankind# He further states that it seems probable 
either that the nitrogen bases (which include the alkaloids) 
represent metabolic products formed by the breaking down of 
amino acids in the plant or animal organism, or that amino 
acids enter into the synthesis of these compounds# The 
nitrogen bases, therefore, may be looked upon as either amino 
acid decomposition products, or products which have been 
derived from amino acids through some vital process# 

It is only within the last few decades that 
the organic chemistry of certain of the alkaloids has been 
elucidated# Owing to the complex structure of the alkaloidal 
molecule (15), a study of the chemistry of the alkaloids is 
one of the most difficult fields of organic chemistry, and 
even today the structural formulae of several important drugs 
are uncertain# 


It is difficult to formulate an exact defini¬ 
tion of an alkaloid# The definition may be made so broad 
as to include all nitrogen-containing compounds, or so narrow 
as to leave out compounds with definite alkaloidal properties# 
Perhaps the following definition of Thompson, as quoted by

Gortner (15), is as satisfactory as any yet devised: fl An 
alkaloid is a relatively complex organic chemical entity con¬ 
taining nitrogen, whose free base is alkaline in reaction 
and capable of neutralizing acids to form salts, whose free 
base is much less soluble in water than its salts, whose free 
base is much more soluble in ether, chloroform, benzol, etc*, 
than its salts, and as a substance whose salts in solution 
release the free base upon the addition of alkalies. ft 

According to Gortner (15), the question of 
origin and purpose of such compounds as the alkaloids, in the 
economy of a plant, is a question which will probably always 
remain a subject of speculation. We have no evidence as to 
the real significance of the alkaloids in the organs or 
tissues of a plant. Inasmuch as they do not occur in all 
forms of plant life, it is obvious that they are not essential 
to the life process of a plant. The great variability in 
amount from season to season and from locality to locality 
also indicates that they may possibly be regarded as by-products 
of the synthetic and metabolic activities of the plant (15, 19). 
This is the view of Pictet, as reviewed by Gortner (15), who 
believes that the nitrogen residues from protein utilized by 
the plant in its metabolic processes are resynthesized into 
alkaloids (by certain plants which possess such synthetic 
power), because in this form the alkaloids are less harmful 
to the plant than the direct decomposition products of the 






proteins. It has also been suggested that alkaloids are a 
form of protection to the plant from marauding animals. In 
the opinion of the writer, it appears possible that the 
alkaloid content of certain plants may also form a means of 
protection from insect attack, with consequent survival of 
plant populations relatively high in a certain alkaloid. 

(b) Is Solanine an Alkaloid ? 

Gortner (15) terms solanine a compound which 
may be considered as intermediate between the true alkaloids 
and other compounds containing a basic nitrogen group. He 
calls it an alkaloidal glycoside. Wolf and Duggar (29) re¬ 
fer to solanine as a glycoalkaloid, and Henry (16) treats 
solanine in the chapter on Steroid Alkaloids. This material 
certainly has a physiological action which is a property char¬ 
acteristic of the alkaloids. 

(c) Suggested Structural Nature and 

Properties of Solanine - 

Solanine occurs in the potato ( Solanum 
tuberosum ), and on acid hydrolysis yields one molecule each 
of glucose, galactose, and rhamnose, and a base, solanidine 
(15, 16, 24, 29)o Various suggestions have been made as to 
the empirical formula of the compound. In 1937, Conner (6) 
concluded that the empirical formula of solanine was still 
a matter of disagreement, but that it was known to be a

tertiary base with a secondary alcohol group 


Soltys and Wallenfels ( 26 ) demonstrated by 
appropriate methods the presence of a sterol nucleus in 
solanidine which they suggested was similar to that of 
cholesterol. The more recent studies of Rochelmeyer, as 
reviewed by Wolf and Duggar (29), on the homocyclic portion 
of potato solanidine confirmed this view. 

The structure of the nitrogen-containing 
portion of the molecule, itfhich is still in doubt, was assumed 
by Soltys and Wallenfels ( 26 ) to form a lupinane structure 
(Fig. 1, A) because of its resistance to degradation, but 
Glemo, et al, (5) favor another structure (Fig. 1, B) in 
which a methyl pyrrolisidine is attached to the sterol nucleus 
at only one point, that is at C^. The structures suggested 
for solanidine are illustrated in Fig. 1.

Wolf and Duggar (29) state that in addition 
to solanine, the two derivatives, solanidine and solanthrene, 
have been reported in tissues* They say it is not clear 
that solanthrene occurs as such in tissues; in fact, this 
substance may be produced as the result of a side reaction 
by the dehydration of solanidine during the acid hydrolysis 
of solanine* 


Morgenstern (20) determined that 1$ table 
potato varieties averaged 0*0125 per cent solanine, while 
seven stock varieties averaged only 0*005$ per cent. Yellow 
potatoes contained less than red or blue varieties. Other 
workers (24, 29) reported varietal differences, and Lampitt 
found that solanidine, a basic component of solanine, occurred 
in free form in sprouts of some varieties but not in others. 
Gortner (15) states that potatoes normally have about 24 parts 
per million (0*0024 per cent) of solanine, while Burner and 
Mattis (3) give a normal range of 0.002 per cent to 0.00$9 
per cent solanine. The latter workers suggested that tubers 
with more than 0.020 per cent solanine were beyond the upper 
safety limit for food purposes. Lepper (1?) showed that 
even within a variety or a single lot of potatoes the solanine 
content can vary widely, and variation within the same lot 
of tubers sampled at different storage intervals has been 
shown by the same author.

Wolf and Duggar (29), and other workers 
(3, 19, 20), have noted an association of high solanine and 
greened tubers, and they conclude that solanine is found in 
greatest concentration in those organs and tissues where 
metabolic activity is greatest, such as tops, sprouts, near 
eyes on the tuber, and in the outer cortex of tubers generally 0 

The properties of solanine have been determined 
by several workers (6, 7, 24)* It is insoluble in pure water, 
or practically so. Wolf and Duggar (29) showed that above a 
pH of 9*3 solanine is quantitatively insoluble in water. It 
is very slightly soluble in cold ethyl alcohol; quite readily 
soluble in hot ethyl alcohol; insoluble in ether, chloroform, 
benzene and petroleum ether. Amyl and ethyl alcohols are 
used to extract solanine from its alkaline plant juice solu¬ 
tions. It is very weakly basic and does not reduce Fehling T s 
solution, but will reduce certain other copper compounds and 
sodium thiosulphate. Soltys and Wallenfels ( 26 ) reported a 
melting point of 2^5° C. Wolf and Duggar (29) reported that 
an aqueous 0.0379 molar solution of solanine, hydrolysed in 
four per cent hydrochloric acid, and containing a very slight 
excess of this acid, "produced a blue fluorescence excited 
by a considerable range of the ultra-violet region" of the 
spectrum. 


According to Davis and Stadtler (7), "solanine 
is bitter and pungent, leaving in the pharynx a persistent

acrid sensation." It is poisonous; one-quarter grain 
being strongly nauseating to a man. It is odorless when 
dry, but when moist it"exhaled an odor recalling that of 
cooking potatoes. Henry (16) describes the solanines as 
"protoplasmic poisons and potent hemolytics," and points out 
that symptoms of solanine poisoning from potatoes are head¬ 
ache, nausea, emesis and gastritis. 

Analytical Methods 

(a) Early Work 

The most important early work on solanine 
extraction from potato tubers was that of Morgenstern (20), 
published in 1907* He used a gravimetric method for the 
quantitative separation and estimation of solanine. 

In 1924* BSmer and Mattis (3) published re¬ 
sults of their work on the 1922 and 1923 potato crop in 
Germany. There had been numerous instances of poisoning 
from the 1922 potato crop in that country. They also used 
a gravimetric method of estimation of solanine content. 

These workers suggested that for very accurate results one 
should add to the weight of the solanine residue 2.75 mg. 
for every 100 ml. of liquid used in the precipitations, in 
order to compensate for the solubility of solanine in alkaline 
solution.

(b) Later Work 


The most important later workers on solanine 
analysis have been Conner (6), Pfankuch (21), Rooke, et al, 
(24), and Wolf and Duggar (29)* 

In 1937, Conner (6) suggested a volumetric 
method of analysis (based on the determination of the reducing 
sugars formed on hydrolysis of the complex molecule). This 
method determines solanine only; in other words, it does not 
determine any free solanidine which may be present♦ 

In the same year Pfankuch (21) developed a 
colorimetric method depending on the color produced by the 
reaction of solanine (and solanidine) with the sulphuric acid- 
formaldehyde reagent, Rooke (24) stated that Alberti, in 
1932, was the first to notice that when solanine was reacted 
with cone, and formaldehyde that a violet-red color was 

produced. However, Alberti failed to notice that the in¬ 
tensity of the color produced was directly proportional to 
the concentration of solanine present, 

Rooke, and co-workers (24), carried out some 
rather extensive studies of solanine and its problems for 
the British Ministry of Food in 1942 and 1943• They tested 
all the known methods of extraction and determination of 
solanine. They criticized the early work and said that 
such workers as BQmer and Mattis, and Morgenstern, applied 





/ 

l

11 


methods of extraction of solanine from potato tissue which 
were subject to error and used methods of determination 
which were unsatisfactory* All these workers had weighed 
the small amount of solanine obtained without particular 
knowledge of the purity of the substance. They also said 
that Burner and Mattis had applied too large a correction to 
their results. Rooke and co-workers obtained a solubility 
figure of only 0.2 mg. per 100 ml., as contrasted to 2.75 mg. 
per 100 ml. as given by the earlier workers. 

Rooke, et al, (24) said that the method of 
extraction of Bomer and Mattis, and also the modification 
of Conner, which necessitated the use of a large quantity 
of raw material, were found to give a sticky, semi-colloidal 
precipitate of solanine, difficult to filter and purify. 

They said that as a method of separation this technique was 
therefore considered to be both unsuitable and unreliable. 
Pfankuch T s method of extraction was found by these workers to 
be satisfactory, and his method was used in their work, with 
some modifications. Rooke, and co-workers, considered 
Pfankuch’s colorimetric method of determination and Conner T s 
volumetric method to be very suitable. 

They modified Pfankuch’s extraction technique 
somewhat. Instead of stirring the potato pulp (from 100 - 
150 gms. of tubers) in acidified alcohol for fifteen minutes 





12 


they allowed the material to steep for 1$ hours, with 
occasional stirring, and then instead of pressing out the 
juice in a hydraulic press they sucked it to dryness in a 
Buchner funnel* They used 150 ml. of 95% ethyl alcohol plus 
3 ml* of glacial acetic acid for the first extraction and 
150 ml* of 64 % ethyl alcohol for the second and third extrac¬ 
tions. The combined extracts were concentrated in vacuo to 
about 50 ml., 5 gm. of sodium sulphate added, and the mixture 
warmed in a water-bath for about one-half hour in order to 
flocculate the proteins. The mixture was then cooled, and, 
after the addition of 2 ml. of 20% sulphuric acid, was filtered 
on a Buchner funnel, the residue being washed with about 10 ml. 
of water. The filtrate (plus washings) was made alkaline 
with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, kept overnight at 4° 0, 
and filtered through quantitative filter paper. The precip¬ 
itate was washed with about 10 ml. of 2% ammonia, the volume 
of filtrate, plus washings, being noted. The precipitate 
was then dissolved in 15 ml. of 1% sulphuric acid and the 
solution diluted with water to 25 ml. Aliquots of this solu¬ 
tion were used for the colorimetric, as well as for the 
hydrolysis method of solanine determination. 

For the colorimetric determination of solanine 
plus solanidine (calculated as solanine), 2*5 ml. of the 
solanine solution was measured into a small, dry flask. 

This was cooled in ice, and then, with vigorous shaking, 5 ml.

of concentrated sulphuric acid were added dropwise from a 
burette. After 1 minute 2.5 ml. of ±% formaldehyde were 
similarly added, drop by drop. The solution was kept for 
90 minutes at room temperature, during which time a purplish- 
red color developed. The extinction coefficient of this solu¬ 
tion was then measured in a Zeiss photometer. The concentra¬ 
tion of solanine plus solanidine, expressed as solanine, was 
obtained by reference to a curve, previously constructed, re¬ 
lating concentration of solanine and optical density. The 
solanine plus solanidine content of the original was then 
calculated as solanine, due allowance being made for the solu¬ 
bility (0.2 mg. per 100 ml.) in the ammoniacal solution. 

These workers proved that the unpurified 
solanine isolated in the normal course of determination in 
potatoes gave a color with maximum absorption at the same 
wave-length as. did pure solanine and pure solanidine indicating 
that no interfering substance was present. It was found that 
matching could most easily be carried out at 5300A° and there¬ 
fore all subsequent extinction coefficients were determined 
at that wave-length, when a linear relationship was found to 
exist with the concentration of pure solanine. Rooke and co¬ 
workers were able to recover 95% of any pure solanine which 
they added to potato samples of known solanine concentration. 

Wolf and Duggar (29) were able to detect 
solanine more accurately than this by means of their method

of analysis, using the same colorimetric method. They were 
able to detect readily as small a quantity as 0.5 nig, of the 
glycoside in 100 ml, of solution. These workers used a 
modified Bomer and Mattis procedure for extracting the solanine 
from tubers. Duplicate samples of approximately 250 gm. of 
finely minced fresh tuber tissue were weighed out. Weighings 
were made to within 1 gm. About 250 ml. of 0.25 per cent 
acetic acid was added, and the mixture allowed to stand at 
room temperature with occasional stirring for about one hour, 
after which it was squeezed out through three thicknesses of 
cheesecloth in a l^draulic press at 5,000 pounds per square 
inch. The pad of ground tissue was extracted three more times 
in the same manner. The combined extracts were made slightly 
ammoniacal as soon as they were prepared, to prevent enzyme 
activity. Finally, 10 gm. of diatomaceous earth were added 
and the mixture was well stirred. 

The extract was then placed in an oven at 
about $5° C to evaporate. When only a small amount of the 
liquid remained, the sides of the container were washed down 
with a small quantity of 0.25 per cent acetic acid, a slight 
excess of ammonia was added, the mixture well stirred, and 
the remaining liquid evaporated off. The dry residue \ms 
scraped out of the container, ground in a mortar with a pestle, 
and extracted with 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in a Soxhlet 
extractor for approximately IS hours. The residue was then

o •:

15 


reground and extracted with 95 per cent alcohol for another 
period of 1& hours. 

The combined alcoholic extracts were evaporated 
to dryness and the residue taken up quantitatively with several 
25 ml. portions of 0.25 per cent acetic acid. These were 
filtered, and the combined filtrate was adjusted to a pH of 
10.0 to 10.4 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide. The 
solanine was precipitated from this alkaline solution by di¬ 
gesting over a boiling water bath for 20 to 30 minutes. The 
alkaloid was collected on a filter paper and purified by 
redissolving it with approximately 100 ml. of 0*25 per cent 
acetic acid, adjusting to pH 10.0 to 10.4, as before, with 
ammonia, and precipitating on the water bath. After three, 
or at the most, four, such purifications a perfectly white 
precipitate of solanine was obtained from a clear solution. 

This was collected on a tared filter paper, washed with three 
15 ml. portions of an approximately 2 per cent solution of 
ammonia, and weighed after being dried to constant weight at 
85° C. 


As indicated earlier, Wolf and Duggar (29) 
demonstrated that above a pH of 9#3 solanine was quantitatively 
insoluble in water. This was probably their most important 
contribution to the technique of solanine analysis. Thus, 
by carrying out the precipitation of solanine at a controlled 




16 


pH of 10.0 to 10*/+, it becomes unnecessary to apply a solubility 
correction* These men noted that the earlier workers were 
very inaccurate in their work when they added a solubility cor¬ 
rection to their results* They pointed out that this correction 
factor sometimes exceeded the total solanine actually recovered. 

(c) Qualitative Tests Specific for Solanine and Solanidine 

Several qualitative tests for the identifica¬ 
tion of small amounts of solanine and solanidine were used. 

The three tests (1$) most frequently used were: the Alberti 
reaction, the Brant reaction, and the Bach reaction. These 
tests are carried out as follows: 

(1) Alberti reaction for solanine and solanidine . 

Dissolve the alkaloidal residue in 1 drop glacial acetic acid, 
add 1-2 drops concentrated I^SO^ and then 1 drop 1$ formalde¬ 
hyde or 0.5$ A purple-red color is produced, which 

becomes more intense on standing. Saponins and most alkaloids 
do not give the reaction; morphine reacts with formaldehyde, 
but not with H 2 O 2 . Sensitiveness, 0.0025 mg. 

(2) Brant reaction for solanine and solanidine . 

The reagent is a mixture of 0.3 gm. sodium selenate in 8 c.c. 
water and 6 c.c. H2S0| f . Warm a little solanine or solanidine 
with the reagent until a reddish tint appears, then remove 
from the flame. The mixture gradually becomes raspberry- 

Sensitiveness, 0.025 nig. solanine or 0.01 mg. solanidine.

EXPERIMENTAL WORK 


- Procedures and Results 

For greater ease of presentation, the exper¬ 
imental work has been divided into its various phases* 

(a) Pure Solanine Production - 

A supply of pure solanine was essential in 
order that its properties could be studied and so that a cali¬ 
bration factor could be calculated for the particular colori¬ 
metric equipment being used. This could not be obtained from 
any North American or European source; hence it was necessary 
for the author to isolate and purify his own sample* This 
proved to be a very time-consuming task* It was found necessary 
to process a very large volume of potato sprouts in order to 
obtain a worthwhile yield of the pure alkaloid. During the 
course of building up the supply of the pure alkaloid, about 
eighty-five pounds of potato sprouts were processed* About 
six grams of the pure material were obtained. 

The potato sprouts were finely ground in a 
large food chopper* The resulting mash was placed in two- 
gallon crocks and enough 2 % acetic acid added to cover the 
material. This was allowed to steep 2-4 days, with 
occasional stirring. The mash was then pressed under high 
pressure and the resulting extract was filtered through a

Buchner funnel, using Celite to hasten the filtering process. 

This filtrate was then made strongly basic with concentrated 
NH^OH. The precipitate was digested on a water bath at about 
70°C for 20-30 minutes, and then centrifuged for 13-20 min¬ 
utes. The supernatant liquid was then easily poured off and 
discarded. The sludgy precipitate was dissolved in 2 % acetic acid 
and heated to 70° C. Some of the proteins were precipitated 
and were then filtered off. The filtrate was again made 
strongly basic with ammonium hydroxide and once more digested 
on the water bath. A large quantity of yellowish-grey pre¬ 
cipitate was obtained on Whatman 1 s #42 filter paper. This 
was dried and then refluxed with 95 % ethyl alcohol. The 
alcohol was filtered while very hot, and upon cooling, the 
solanine crystallized out in small, loose needles. This was 
filtered, refluxed and crystallized from alcohol twice more. 

The resulting crystals were then refluxed 
and filtered twice with diethyl ether to remove any traces 
of solanidine and solanthrene. The resulting solanine crys¬ 
tals were refluxed and crystallized twice more from 95%> ethyl 
alcohol. By now the material crystallized out in snow-white, 
very tiny needles and had a melting point of slightly over 
283° C. The highest recorded melting point for pure solanine 
is 235° G ( 26 ).

(b) Evolution of Standard Analytical Procedure - 

The most recent of the solanine analysis 
methods were studied in the laboratory* The standard analyt¬ 
ical procedure eventually used was an amalgamation of the 
method of Rooke, et al (24), and Wolf and Duggar (29). 

The extraction procedure of Rooke was used, 
and the solanine was precipitated from the acidic extract by 
adjusting to pH of 10*0 - 10.4 with concentrated ammonium 
hydroxide, as suggested by Wolf and Duggar. It was found 
that quantitative procedure was more easily followed when the 
extract was removed from the potato pulp by means of sucking 
it through a Buchner funnel than when a hydraulic press was 
used. Some of the extract was almost invariably lost when 
using a bulky press. The relatively large volume of solanine 
precipitate normally recovered in this investigation made it 
essential that this precipitate be dissolved from the filter 
paper with 75-^0 ml. of 0*5%> acetic acid. This extract was 
then diluted to 100 ml. This was in contrast to the pro¬ 
cedure of Rooke, et al (24) who diluted to a final volume of 
only 25 ml. 

The procedure that Wolf and Duggar (29) used 
with their solanine extracts from tissues other than tubers 
was followed when producing the violet-red color with con¬ 
centrated H 2 S0^ and one per cent formaldehyde. The same

proportions of solanine extract, concentrated HgSO/^ and one 
per cent formaldehyde were used as was suggested by Pfankuch 
(21) and Rooke, et al (24), but the volumes differed. The 
volumes, as used by Wolf and Duggar (29), and in the present 
investigation, were: 3 ml. of the solanine extract (a pre¬ 
cision pipette was used); 6 ml. of concentrated ^SO^; and 
3 ml. of 1% formaldehyde. Micro-burettes were used to 
measure accurately the I^SO^ and the formaldehyde. 

The technique of color formation was that 
mentioned earlier in this report. A fairly detailed study 
was carried out with the aim of determining how much time was 
required for the violet-red color to reach its maximum inten¬ 
sity. This maximum intensity was almost invariably reached 
between forty and fifty minutes after the last drop of formal¬ 
dehyde had been added. A typical graph is shown in Figure 2. 
It is of interest to note that Rooke and his co-workers (24) 
have stated that ninety minutes is -required for maximum color 
density to be reached, which contrasts sharply with the find¬ 
ings in the present work. After several tests, all of which 
conformed to the curve shown in Figure 2, the procedure fol¬ 
lowed was to estimate the optical density of the colored solu¬ 
tion with a Fisher Electrophotometer after forty-five minutes, 
using filter 525* Excellent results were obtained by taking 
the highest reading obtained during the 45-55 minute time- 
interval.

The method of solanine analysis used as the 
Standard Method in this study is as follows: 

1. To thoroughly minced samples (100 - 150 gms.) 
of fresh potato material add 150 ml. of 95% 
ethyl alcohol, followed by 3 ml. of glacial 
acetic acid. 

2. Stir well and keep 1$ hours with occasional 
stirring. 

3. Filter on a Buchner funnel (Whatman T s #4 
paper). 

4. A further two similar extractions of the 
residue are made with 150 ml. of 64 % etlwl 
alcohol (but no acetic acid)• 

5. Combined extracts are concentrated under 
reduced pressure to approximately 50 ml. 

6. 5 gm. of sodium sulphate are added and the 
mixture warmed in a water bath at 70° C for 
about one-half hour. A flocculent pre¬ 
cipitate (mostly protein) forms. 

7. The mixture is cooled, 2 ml. of 20% ^SO^ 
added, and is filtered on a Buchner with 
light suction (Whatman ! s #4 paper). The 
residue is washed with about 10 ml. of 
water. 

3. The filtrate, plus washings, is adjusted to 
a pH of 10.0 - 10.4 with concentrated NH^OH.

9. The solanine is precipitated by digesting 
in a water bath for 20 - 30 minutes at 
70° C; cool• 

10* Filter through Whatman’s $42 paper and wash 
the precipitate with about 10 ml. of 2$ 
ammonia. 

11. The precipitate is dissolved in three or 
four 20 ml. increments of 0.5$ acetic acid, 
and made carefully to volume in a 100 ml. 
volumetric flask. 

12. Prepare colored solution according to direc¬ 
tions outlined under ,f Analytical Methods, n 
except that 3 ml. of extract, 6 ml. of 
concentrated HgSO^ and 3 ml. of 1% formal¬ 
dehyde are used. 

13. Determine solanine content after 45 minutes 
with the Fisher Electrophotometer. 

This standard analytical method gave reason¬ 
ably good results, but its disadvantages were nearly as 
numerous as any of the methods in common use. Probably the 
greatest disadvantage was the long period of time required 
for completion of an analysis. With so much time required, 
it becomes almost impossible to analyze more than a relative¬ 
ly few samples of tubers. It is also very desirable to re¬ 
duce greatly the number of steps involved, if possible. When

material must be transferred from one container to another 
so often, the chances of error are greatly increased* 

The conversion of Electrophotometer readings 
to mg. solanine/100 gm. fresh tuber tissue is developed as 
follows: For a Scale A reading of 30.0 the extract recovered 
from 150 gm. fresh tuber material, and using the calibration 
factor of 0.4266 (determined for the specific instrument used 
by using pure solanine), the formula is 30 x 0.4266 x 100/150 
= £.53 nig. solanine/100 gm. fresh tuber. Scale A on the 
Fisher Electrophotometer is a most useful time-saver. It 
is a logarithmic scale incorporated into the machine. The 
logarithmic calculations are already taken care of, thus re¬ 
lieving the operator of this burden. 

Table I illustrates typical solanine readings 
in duplicate. As a matter of interest, brief biographical 
notes are given on the tuber material used. The relationship 
between tubers noted as tT bitter fT from cooking tests, and a 
high solanine content, may be observed.

(c) Simple Qualitative Tests on Fresh Tubers - 

It was thought that possibly one of the 
qualitative reagents might give at least a semi-quantitative, 
rapid test for solanine on fresh tuber slices. Such a rapid 
test would be most desirable as it could then be used as a 
quick means of roughly estimating the solanine content of a 
sample of tubers, either in the field, or immediately after 
harvest. A detailed analysis could be carried out later on 
tubers indicating a high alkaloid content. 

The Bach reagent was found to produce the 
best color reaction on thin slices of fresh tubers. It was 
found necessary to modify the Bach reagent somewhat. One 
volume of concentrated sulphuric acid to one volume of 95 per 
cent ethyl alcohol was found to be too harsh. The tuber 
slices were being charred before any appreciable color had 
formed. The modified reagent eventually used was: two vol¬ 
umes of concentrated sulphuric acid; one volume of distilled 
water; and three volumes of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. It 
was necessary to cool this mixture before the tuber slices 
were immersed in it. Also, this reagent must be used fresh; 
i.e*, reagent prepared one day would not produce a color re¬ 
action if not used until the following day. 

This reagent was placed in small porcelain 
evaporating dishes and one thin slice of tuber immersed in 







28 


each dish. After 25 - 30 minutes a rose-violet color was 
produced in the slices. 

Tests were carried out on slices from tubers 
of low, medium and high solanine content. The different color 
intensities produced in preliminary tests gave some reason 
for optimism, but when more extensive work had been completed 
on tubers of known solanine content, it was impossible to de¬ 
tect any definite trend. It was therefore decided that 
further work along this line would be a waste of time. 

(d) Simplification of Regular Extraction Procedure - 

An attempt was made to shorten the regular 
extraction procedure by reducing the steeping periods to 
something less than eighteen hours. Instead of allowing 
the potato material to merely steep in the alcohol, a variable- 
speed electrical stirrer was used. While some reduction in 
the extraction time was possible, it was felt that little, if 
any, advantage had been gained. It certainly was not the 
answer to the problem, because at least two days were still 
required for complete removal of the solanine, at which time 
there was still a large volume of extract to process. It 
seemed necessary to extract from a small volume of material, 
or to devise a simple and short method of estimating the 
solanine in the extract without the necessity of reduction 
in volume or of purification. 





29 


(e) Fluorescence Studies - 

The author was aware that Slatensek and 
Washburn (25) had devised a rapid fluororaetric method for 
the determination of coumarin in Sweet Glover* It was with 
considerable interest, therefore, that one particular state¬ 
ment of Wolf and Duggar (29) was noted* They stated that 
T, Solanidine and solanthrene were also prepared by hydrolysing 
solanine in four per cent hydrochloric acid, and separating 
and purifying the hydrochlorides of the two bases by appropri¬ 
ate means. 


n An aqueous, 0.0379 molar solution of 
solanine, prepared as indicated above, and containing a very 
slight excess of hydrochloric acid, produced a blue fluores¬ 
cence excited by a considerable range of the ultra-violet 
region. The maximum intensity was at about 300 to 350 milli¬ 
microns, and it disappeared at about 227 millimicrons. An 
alcoholic solution of solanidine, 0.0121 molar, behaved simi¬ 
larly, displaying the same maxima as an aqueous solution of 
solanine, so that the aglycone alone was responsible for the 
fluorescence 


It was hoped that perhaps a simple means of 
estimating the solanine content of a potato extract could be 
devised, somewhat similar to that used in estimating the 
coumarin content of a sample of sweet clover. A Coleman

Fluorophotometer was available in this laboratory, and a 
General Electric ultra-violet bulb was obtained, equipped 
with a violet filter passing light of about 365 millimicrons, 
or 3650A 0 . 

A solution of solanine of about 0.04 molar 
concentration, prepared as indicated by Wolf and Duggar, did 
give quite a brilliant blue fluorescence when viewed under 
the ultra-violet light. 

An experiment was set up which was designed 
to determine whether the fluorescence of solanine under ultra¬ 
violet light followed a linear pattern. Ten solutions of pure 
solanine, representing concentrations from 320 mg. to 0.675 
mg. per 100 gms. of fresh tissue were hydrolysed in 4 per cent 
hydrochloric acid. These solutions were cooled, and the 
intensity of fluorescence determined with the Coleman Fluoro¬ 
photometer, using filters B-l and PC-1. Each of the ten 
solutions gave a reading of 11 (with the sensitivity control 
set at maximum), which was the same reading given by a blank 
of 4 per cent hydrochloric acid. 

It had been proposed to use alcohol-extracted 
potato material (solanine-free) in preparing the blank solu¬ 
tion for calibration of the fluorophotometer. Seven samples 
of this finely pulverized solanine-free material, together 
with pure solanine, were prepared representing concentrations

from 10 mg. to l.$75 mg. per 100 gm. of fresh tuber tissue. 

An amount of 0.5000 gms. of each concentration was placed 
in a dry, 3/4x6 inch test-tube, marked for 15 ml. Four 
per cent hydrochloric acid was added to the 15 ml. mark. 

These were loosely stoppered and heated in an electric oven 
at 95° C for two hours. After cooling, the volume was re¬ 
stored to the 15 ml. mark if necessary, using 4 per cent 
hydrochloric acid. The tubes were well shaken, and the 
potato material allowed to settle. The degree of fluorescence, 
of the full-strength extract, was determined using the fluoro- 
photometer. All seven readings were essentially the same, 
and were very low. 

An attempt to determine approximate solanine 
content by visual means was made. For this trial, a home¬ 
made light-proof container for the General Electric ultra¬ 
violet bulb was set up. Thin slices of fresh tuber were 
heated for 30 minutes at 90° C, in four per cent hydrochloric 
acid, to hydrolyse the solanine present. These slices were 
then subjected to the 365 millimicron ultra-violet wave-length. 
Using tuber slices from potatoes of widely differing solanine 
content, it \ms not possible to estimate differences in in¬ 
tensity of fluorescence. 

As a point of interest, all tuber slices showed 
slight fluorescence, and it was observed that the area of 
maximum fluorescence was immediately beneath the tuber skin.

These disappointing and negative results 
forced the conclusion that the degree of fluorescence of 
solanine in ultra-violet light was not intense enough to be 
used as a means of solanine estimation from a potato extract* 

(f) Extraction from Dried Material - 

Many of the short, alkaloid estimation tech¬ 
niques use the dried leaf or root material (10, 23)* An 
attempt was made to devise a shortened method of solanine 
estimation patterned somewhat on these methods* 

The fresh potato tubers were sliced longitu¬ 
dinally down the centre* One-half was analyzed for solanine 
content, and the other half was sliced thinly and dried on 
a wire screen to constant weight at 65° C* The dried slices 
were finely pulverized with a mortar and pestle* This dried 
and pulverized material was used in an effort to extract 
solanine, using a Soxhlet type extractor. Two solvents were 
used: 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and 2 per cent hydrochloric 
acid. 

Ten grams of the dried tuber material were 
placed into a 30 x $0 mm* Soxhlet thimble, the apparatus 
assembled, and 125 ml* of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol used as 
the solvent. Various extraction periods, from five to fif¬ 
teen hours, were tried. In no instance could any definite 
test for solanine be obtained from the extract.

Two per cent hydrochloric acid was similarly 
used as a solvent. Solanine is very soluble in dilute acids, 
and also solanine is easily hydrolysed in hydrochloric acid 
to solanidine and its three sugars. It was hoped that by 
refluxing the dried and pulverized tuber material in the 
Soxhlet extractor that the solanine could be extracted by 
means of the fresh, hot solvent; and at the same time, the 
simmering extract in the distillation flask would become 
hydrolysed. Theoretically, the aglycone could then have 
been precipitated with ammonium hydroxide and taken up in an 
alkaloid solvent such as chloroform or diethyl ether. 

Only a trace of solanidine could be detected 
from any of the extracts; far below the amount known to have 
been present in ten grams of the dried tuber material. It 
was presumed that the solanine present must have been altered 
somewhat during the drying process, and also -some of the 
solanidine was probably destroyed during the HC1 extraction. 

At this point in the investigation, it appeared 
that it would be necessary to extract the solanine from fresh 
potato tissue. Actually, this was desirable, because the 
drying of the tubers necessitated another step, in the already 
involved technique. This line of thought led to the next 
phase of the investigation.

(g) Soxhlet Extraction of Fresh Material - 

The first extraction by this method was 
tried on a sample of 1950, University of Alberta grown, 

Netted Gems. They were finely macerated in a Waring 
Blendor, and a 25*0 gnu sample was carefully transferred to 
a 30 x BO mm. Soxhlet extraction thimble. About 150 ml* of 
95 per cent ethyl alcohol were added to the distillation 
flask, and five drops of glacial acetic acid were added. 

The apparatus was assembled and placed on an electric hot¬ 
plate. Extraction was continued for eight hours* 

The resulting extract was reduced in volume, 

partially purified and the solanine precipitated in a manner 

similar to the technique used in the Standard Method of 

extraction and estimation. The acetic acid solution of 

solanine was diluted to volume in a 25 nil* volumetric flask. 

The solanine content of this extract was estimated by measur- 
optical 

ing the/density of the violet-red color, produced by the 
sulphuric acid-formaldehyde reagent, in the Fisher Electro¬ 
photometer. 


A solanine concentration of 4#4& nig. per 
100 gms. of fresh tissue was indicated from this extract. 

The solanine content of a sample of these tubers taken from 
the same container (but not the same n mix ,f ), and determined 
by means of the Standard Extraction Method, was 9*51 mg. per 
100 gms.

A second Soxhlet extraction, similar to the 
first, and differing only in the extraction time, was 
carried out. This sample was extracted for fifteen hours. 

A solanine concentration of 11.30 mg. per 100 gms. was in¬ 
dicated. This was encouraging, as a higher solanine content 
was indicated than that which was obtained using the longer 
method. 

Several more single determinations were made, 
all with gratifying results. The technique was altered 
somewhat and improved. A series of duplicate determinations 
were then made, using two identical sets of Soxhlet apparatus 
Very good checks were obtained with the duplicate extractions 

A series of extractions were planned in an 
attempt to determine the minimum extraction period needed 
to remove completely the solanine from the potato sample. 
Tables II, III and IV contain the results of these extrac¬ 
tions, two colorimetric determinations having been made on 
each duplicate extract. Solanine contents indicated in all 
tables are mg. of solanine per 100 gms. of fresh tuber tissue 
The three sets of duplicate extractions in Tables II, III 
and IV were carried out on samples weighed from the same 
"mix" in the Waring Blendor. The solanine concentrations 
reported in Table II are for a different sample of tubers 
than those reported in Table III; and likewise for Table IV*

These figures indicate that 20 hours should 
be taken as the minimum extraction period, and 22 hours 
should be considered the maximum period* The loss of solanine 
in the 24-bour extraction period may possibly be due to a 
small amount of solanine breakdown because of an excessively 
long boiling period in the acidified alcohol*

These data indicate that the Soxhlet Method 
of extraction gives more consistent checks between duplicates, 


and usually indicates at least a slightly higher alkaloid 


content than does the old long method* In at least one in¬ 
stance the Soxhlet Method indicated approximately twice as 
much solanine as did the long method* No reason could be 
found for this evident failure of the long method to extract 
more than about half of the alkaloid which was present* An¬ 
other worker at the University of Alberta experienced this 
same inconsistency in results with the Long Standard Method 
of extraction and obtained very good results using the Short 
Soxhlet Method* 


Table VI contains the results of a series of 


duplicate Soxhlet extractions* Each figure is an average of 
two colorimetric determinations carried out on each extract*

Treating these solanine figures as "Paired 
Data" a non-significant "t” value of 0.03 is obtained. This 
indicates that the normal populations sampled have the same 
means and the same variances; or* in other words, the two 
samples are randomly drawn from the same normal population. 

It can therefore safely be said that any of the variations 
between the duplicate analyses are attributable to normal 
experimental error and not to errors inherent in the method 
itself. 

The standard error (standard deviation of 

means) of the method ( s ) = + 0.154 mg. of solanine per 

(v'n ) 

100 gm of fresh tuber tissue.

The Soxhlet extraction technique is as 

Tubers are washed, and allowed to dry. 

They may be coarsely ground in a food chopper 
or sliced thinly and then transferred to a 
Waring Blendor. Here the tuber material is 
very finely pulverized. 

Duplicate, 25*0 gnu samples are carefully 
weighed in 50 ml. beakers. 

The tuber material is transferred to a 
30 x $0 mm. Soxhlet thimble (the thimble 
being held in a second 50 ml. beaker) with 
a stirring rod equipped with a rubber police¬ 
man. 

The beaker is washed once with a few ml. of 
95 per cent ethyl alcohol, from a wash bottle 
This first washing is transferred to the 
Soxhlet thimble. 

The thimble is carefully lowered into the 
Soxhlet apparatus. 

Both beakers are thoroughly washed with 
several small increments of 95 per cent ethyl 
alcohol (25-30 ml. of alcohol are used in 
washing the two beakers). The washings 
are transferred to a 250 ml. distilling flask

(8) A further 100 ml* of 95 per cent ethyl 
alcohol is added to the flask, plus five 
drops of glacial acetic acid* 

(9) The Soxhlet apparatus is assembled and placed 
on a hot-plate to extract* The equipment 
used must be equipped with perfectly fitting 
ground-glass joints* 

(10) Extraction is continued for 20-22 hours* 

The hot-plate temperature should be adjusted 
so that the alcohol is just boiling. 

(11) The extract is reduced in volume to 10-15 ml., 
in vacuo, in the distilling flask* For this 
purpose a two-holed rubber stopper is fitted 
with an open glass rod and a fine capillary 
tube. The capillary tube is fitted with a 
short length of rubber tubing which can be 
clamped with a pinch-cock* In this manner, 

a very slow stream of tiny air bubbles is 
allowed to enter the distillate at the bottom 
of the flask* This serves to keep the ex¬ 
tract boiling without violent bumping. 

(12) 1*0 gm. of Na 2 S0^ is added to the distilling 
flask; it is swirled vigorously, and heated 
in a water-bath at 70° C for 20-30 minutes*

(13) The extract is cooled, 0.5 ml. of 20 per cent 
H^SO^ is added, and the extract filtered 
through a 9 cm. Whatman’s #4 paper. 10-15 ml. 
of 0.5 per cent acetic acid (from a wash- 
bottle ) are used to wash the distilling flask 
and the filter paper. 

(14) The filtrate is allowed to run into a 100 ml. 
beaker. The pH is adjusted to 10.0 - 10.4 
with concentrated NH^OH; a Beckman glass 
electrode, pH meter is used to measure the pH. 

(15) The precipitate is flocculated by heat at 
70° C in a water bath for 30 minutes and is 
then cooled. The precipitate can be filtered 
off at this stage, or it may be kept in a 
refrigerator over night before being filtered. 
Equal!}*- good results have been obtained using 
either of these two practices. 

(16) The solanine precipitate is filtered off 
through a 9 cm. Whatman 1 s #42 paper, using 

a small funnel. Precipitate is washed with 
about 10 ml. of 2 per cent NH^OH, preferably 
applied in two increments of 5 ml. each. 

(17) When no smell of ammonia remains on the 
filter paper, it is transferred to the same 
100 ml. beaker used earlier, and the solanine

is dissolved in several small increments 

of 0.5 per cent acetic acid. 

(l£) The acetic acid solution of solanine is 

filtered through a Whatman f s #12 folded 

filter paper into a 50 ml. volumetric flask. 

The paper is washed with 0.5 per cent acetic 

acid sprayed from a wash-bottle, and the 

volume is carefully made to the 50 ml. mark 

using 0.5 per cent acetic acid. 

(19) The solanine concentration is determined by 
optical 

reading the/density of the violet-red color, 
produced by the sulphuric acid-formaldehyde 
reaction, in the same manner as was done with 
the long Standard Method (see pages 12 and 20). 

It has been possible, using the above pro¬ 
cedure, to complete a duplicate analysis in just over a day 
and a half. This is allowing for the 20-hour extraction 
period, and also allows for an overnight delay at the pre- 
cipitated-sclanine stage. Most of the actual extraction 
takes place over-night, and at no time does the Soxhlet 
apparatus require more than just a cursory examination to 
see that the hot-plate is operating and to be certain that 
the cold water is flowing through the condensers. The small 
volume of extract (about 130 ml.) reduces to the required

volume quickly under a vacuum. The resulting very small 
volume of extract, plus washings, normally filters rapidly, 
so that very little time is wasted# It is only when tubers 
with a very high solanine, and protein, content are being 
analysed that the filtering process may be delayed somewhat. 

It was felt that 25 ml. of solvent was insufficient to remove 
completely the solanine from the filter paper, so 50 ml. was 
used. This added dilution of the extract is taken into account 
when the Electrophotometer readings are converted to mg. sola- 
nine. 

This analytical technique has made it possible 
to reduce the time factor to approximately one-third of that 
required by the old method. Also, the number of individual 
steps involved has been greatly reduced. Standard quantita¬ 
tive analytical procedure can easily be followed throughout 
the entire extraction and purification. It was felt that any 
precision lost because of reducing the weight of fresh tissue 
to 25.0 grns. was more than compensated for by the reduction 
in the number of individual steps and cumbersome transfers of 
large volumes of material. 

Wolf and Duggar (29) showed that the colored 
solution formed by solanine with concentrated sulphuric acid 
and one per cent formaldehyde exhibited very close agreement 
with Beer’s Law. This agreement was particularly close over

the range of 5-10 mg. per 100 ml 0 of solution* This range 
(5-10 mg. per 100 ml.) corresponds very closely to the most 
sensitive area of the Fisher Electrophotometer scale. There¬ 
fore, solanine solutions of higher concentration than this were 
diluted with 0.5 per cent acetic acid until their concentra¬ 
tions fell within this range. This colorimetric method of 
estimating the alkaloidal content of a potato extract deter¬ 
mines both solanine and solanidine. This combined solanine 
and solanidine content was, in each instance, reported as mg. 
solanine. 

A filter passing light of 5300A° was not avail¬ 
able for the electrophotometer used, so a 5250A° filter was 
employed. 


DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 


The data presented bear evidence that a new 
analytical technique, for the quantitative determination of 
solanine in potato tubers, has been devised. A method such 
as this has been urgently required, at this institution at 
least. This shorter, easier-to-handle, method should prove 
to be of considerable value to future workers in this field. 

It will be possible to analyse up to three times as many tuber 
samples in the same length of time as was possible with the 
older methods.

CONCLUSIONS 


The negative nature of most of the trials re¬ 
ported herein bears out the complexity of solanine analytical 
procedure indicated by previous workers. Detailed investiga¬ 
tion has shown several unsuccessful avenues of approach, which 
should constitute a record of value to further work. The 
much-shortened Soxhlet analytical method represents what is 
felt to be a very significant improvement in the procedure for 
quantitative determination of this poisonous and troublesome 
giycoalkaloid. If, as might be anticipated, irrigation and 
modern machine cultural methods of potato production encourage 
the setting of tubers near the ground surface, increases in 
tuber bitterness may result. A short analytical procedure 
may, therefore, contribute much to studies of causal factors 
and control measures.
