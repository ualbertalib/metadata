The Research Problem 


The investigation undertaken was an experimental 
study of the air blowing of vacuum reduced Redwater asphalt 
base stock with special reference to the use of phosphorus 
pentoxide as an addition agent. The specific objectives of 
the problem were: 

(1) To determine the changes in the properties of the 

asphalt base stock as it is air blown under various 

blowing temperatures and various air rates without 
phosphorus pentoxide. 

(2) To determine the changes in the properties of the 

asphalt base stock as it is air blow;n under various 

blowing temperatures and various air rates with 
phosphorus pentoxide. 

(3) To compare the results obtained with phosphorus 
pentoxide with those obtained without phosphorus 

pentoxide.

SUMMARY 


Redwater asphalt base stock was air blown in a conven¬ 
tional vertical cylindrical still approximately 10 inches in 
diameter and 30 inches in height. The base stock was initially 
blown without the use of phosphorus pent oxide at temperatures 
of 465 °F. and 525 °F., and air rates of 55 and 75 cubic feet 
per minute per ton of charge. In the next series of experiments 
the base stock was blown with the use of phosphorus pentoxide 
as a "catalyst". Three tests were made at a fixed air rate of 
55 cubic feet per minute per ton of charge and at a blowing 
temperature of 525 °F. with 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0 percent phosphorus 
pentoxide respectively. As with the straight air blown tests 
the effect of varying the operating conditions was investigated. 

At the end of a phosphorus pentoxide test, considerable residue 
was present in the bottom of the still. The effect of re-using 
the residue formed from a 0.50 percent pentoxide test was studied. 
Different methods of dispersing the phosphorus pentoxide were 
employed. With the operating conditions fixed at a blowing 
temperature of 525 °F. and at an air rate of 55 cubic feet per 
minute per ton of charge, 1.0 percent phosphorus pentoxide was 
dispersed into the asphalt by grinding in a mortar and pestle, 
by hand stirring, by use of carbon tetrachloride and finally 
by the use of a 100 mesh screen 2§ inches from the still bottom 
in addition to grinding in a mortar and pestle. 

It was found that by air blowing the Redwater asphalt

base stock, a very wide range of closely controlled products could 
be obtained. The chemical and physical changes which the base 
stock undergoes were not well understood but the product was 
harder (lower penetration), heavier, lower in ductility, and 
higher in softening point than before the blowing. The fraction¬ 
al composition was also found to change with air blowing, the 
resins decreasing and the asphaltenes increasing. The oily consti¬ 
tuents changed comparatively little. Furthermore, the mean mole¬ 
cular weights of the asphaltenes, resins and oily constituents 
were increased markedly by air blowing. 

The use of small amounts of phosphorus pentoxide as a 
"catalyst” showed to a great advantage in controlling the hardness 
of the blown asphalts. At a given softening point a pentoxide 
blown product could be prepared which had a higher penetration 
than a straight blown asphalt, under similar blowing conditions 
and with the same dispersion method* the penetration increase 
was dependent on the amount of pentoxide used, at least within 
the range of zero to one percent. The method of dispersing the 
phosphorus pentoxide was found to be comparable in importance 
to the amount of pentoxide used. With a better dispersion method, 
a greater increase in penetration (as referred to a given softening 
point) was obtained. It was also found that the same type of 
effect may be accomplished by the re-use of the residue formed 
from a pentoxide test.

In both the straight and "catalytic” air blowing 
the effect of different blowing temperatures and different 
air rates, while important as far as reaction rate is concerned, 
was very slight on the relationships between the properties 
of the blown asphalt and its softening point.

I. INTRODUCTION 


Asphalt has been known to man for some five or six 
thousand years. In the early periods, the asphalt used was 
native asphalt, formed by the natural distillation of oil. 

Today, although there are still large deposits of native asphalt, 
most of the asphalt is manufactured from crude oil refining. 

There are at present many uses of asphalt. It is used 
as paving material for highways and runways of airports, in 
roofing and waterproofing material, pipe linings and coatings, 
paints and varnishes, crack-filling materials, and for numerous 
other purposes. 

Because of the variety of uses of asphalt, it is neces¬ 
sary to prepare products which differ widely in certain important 
physical properties. One of the most important processes for 
preparing such products is by blowing air at elevated temperatures 
through residual oils. These air blown asphalts appear to 
acquire a certain amount of pliability, elasticity and resilience. 
They are less ductile at ordinary temperatures than residual 
asphalts of the same penetration, but are less susceptible to 
temperature changes and are consequently favored where wide 
temperature ranges have to be met. For equal softening points 
the penetration of blown asphalts is greater than that of residual 
asphalt. 

The degree of blowing depends upon the choice of feed¬ 
stock, and the extent of the "blown" characteristics of the

asphalt can be controlled but only within certain limits. It 
was reported (14) that the use of small amounts of phosphorus 
pentoxide as a "catalyst” would permit a further alteration 
of the "blown” characteristics. At a given softening point 
a "catalytic” product can be prepared which has a higher pene¬ 
tration than a straight blown asphalt; or at a given penetration 
the softening point can be increased. Thus residua which by 
ordinary air blowing yield products which fail to meet penetration 
specifications can successfully be manufactured with the aid 
of "catalysts”. Instead of blowing light residua to obtain 
products low in temperature susceptibility, heavier residua 
with higher flash point can be air blown with help of "catalysts" 
to the same softening point and penetration relationship. 

Asphalt from Redwater crude was selected as the most 
suitable asphaltic material to study for two reasons. First, 
high softening point grades of roofing asphalts cannot be 
manufactured from Redwater crude residua by straight air blowing 
because of failure to meet penetration specifications. Secondly, 
Redwater is one of the Alberta’s most prolific producers of 
mixed base crude generally suitable for asphalt production.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW 

In 1865 Gesner (12) reported that the properties of 
petroleum products changed when treated with oxidizing agents 
or air. However, it was Francis X. Byerley (6) who in 1894 
first manufactured blown asphalt on a commercial scale. He 
heated petroleum residuum in a closed shell still to about 
600 °F. and passed a small quantity of air through it. With 
this small amount of air this process was essentially a distil¬ 
lation process, with the air used principally for agitation 
and to accelerate the distillation. G. K. Culmer (9) later 

♦ 

described a process by which a large amount of air was forced 
through petroleum residuum at low temperatures. Comparatively 
small stills were used and the air was introduced into the heated 
residuum by a single perforated pipe laid along the bottom of 
the still. Because of the quality, character, and light gravity 
of the residuum used in these early experiments, and because 
of the poor distribution of air through the heated residuum, 
the time of blowing varied from 20 to 60 hours. The Culmer 
process was without doubt the forerunner of the present methods 
used in air blowing residua and asphalt products of various 
types. 

The use of addition agents to augment the air blowing 
process dates back to Jenny (19) in 1876. He patented the 
process of treating sludge oil with various compounds such as 
potassium permanganate, oxides of lead and manganese which

release oxygen and accelerate the air blowing process. Salathe ( 37 ) 
in 1896 described the use of various oxides or peroxides to 
accelerate the air blowing of asphalts to obtain a product with ' 
improved penetrating properties as a saturant for wood. Amongst 
other earlier investigators were De Smedt (10), Baillard (4), 

Busse (5), and Schreiber (38). A comprehensive general historical 
survey is given by Abraham (1). 

It was not until 1930 that Abson (2) pointed out that 
use of salts such as ferric chloride and zinc chloride in addition 
to accelerating the blowing process produced asphalts of low 
brittleness at low temperatures and more resistant, to flow at 
high temperatures. Abson was followed by a number of patentees 
who found various advantages in use of different agents or 
catalysts. Amongst these patentees, the most important is 
Hoiberg (14). He found that blown asphalt prepared by air 
blowing Smackover crude residua in the presence of red phosphorus 
or phosphorus containing catalyst such as PgOg, P 4 S 3 , 
and had a much higher penetration for a given softening 

point than if the crude were blown without "catalyst". The 
manufactured product was found suitable for protective coatings 
and roofing. 

Although blown asphalts are often referred to as 
oxidized asphalts, the essential process, as postulated by 
Morris Katz of the National Research Council of Canada, is (21) 
not oxidation but condensation followed by polymerization to

form products of higher molecular weight. It is believed that 
the small amount of hydrogen removed combines with the oxygen 
to form water. Ultimate analyses of the blown asphalts showed 
no appreciable fixation of oxygen. The oxygen probably acts 
as a catalyst. It is believed (8) that the sulphur also plays 
an important part in promoting the reactions. 

Asphalts have been separated by solvent extraction 
into different fractions. Le Bel (22) extracted bitumen with 
naphtha and then precipitated asphaltenes with amyl alcohol. 
Richardson (35) distinguished four components in asphalt - 
petrolenes, maltenes, asphaltenes and carbenes. Marcusson (25) 
modified the procedure extensively and his method is still widely 
used. He distinguished oily constituents, resins, asphaltenes, 
and asphaltic acids and their anhydrides in natural asphalts. 
Since acid constituents are either absent or present only in 
very small quantities in asphalts manufactured from petroleum 
products, most investigators usually speak only of asphaltenes, 
resins and oily constituents. Other components which are some¬ 
times determined are carbenes and carboids. Other methods 
for determining the components of the asphalt are described 
by Strieter (39), Hoiberg and Garris (16), Hubbard and Stanfield 
(18), Gattel, Shea et al (7). They are all, however, based 
on Marcusson’s procedure. It is important to remember that 
although the division of the constituents is used to a great 
extent, any slight variation in methods and reagents will give

different results. Also, the nature of asphaltenes, resins 
and oily constituents in different asphalts va r y considerably. 

Marcusson and Picard (26) found that the fractional 
composition changes with air blowing, the resins decreasing 
and the asphaltenes increasing. The oily constituents changed 
comparatively little. These same trends were also established 
by Morris Katz and later by Hoiberg (21, 13). Sachanen (36) 
stated that the oily constituents may be oxidized to resins, 
which in turn may be oxidized to asphaltenes. The properties 
of oily constituents, resins, and asphaltenes are discussed 
thoroughly by Mack (23), Murphy (27), luellensteyn (28, 29, 30), 
Swanson (40), Sachanen (36), Pfeiffer and Saal (33). Morris 
Katz ( 21) maintained that in addition to variation in the 
fractional composition on air blowing, the mean molecular weight 
of the fractions increased markedly. 

Such large changes in fractional composition are accom- 
panied by changes in colloidal nature. Nellensteyn (28) postulated 
that asphaltenes consisted of a carbon nucleus surrounded by 
protective bodies. Thus the asphaltic bitumen consisted of 
carbon surrounded by layers of hydrocarbons in which the ratio 
of carbon to hydrogen become progressively lower; the outermost 
layer of this disperse phase having a ratio the same as that 
of the oily medium. Mack (23) agreed with Nellensteyn that 
asphalts constitute a lyophilic sol and that the asphaltenes 
formed the dispersed phase and resins and oily constituents

formed the dispersion medium; but he disagreed with Nellensteyn's 
contention that asphaltenes were composed of free carbon plus 
protective bodies. Pfeiffer and Van Doormaal (33) stated, 
on the strength of ultra microscopic examination, that it was 
scarcely likely that the nucleus of the dispersed phase should 
consist of elementary carbon. More recently, Preckshot (34) 
and D. L. Katz (20) examined asphalt in thin films under the 
electron microscope and concluded that the asphaltene particles, 
if present, are less than 65 Angstroms in diameter. This 
further indicated that asphaltenes could not be composed of 
free carbon. Eilers (11) has described very recently the 
relationship of the colloidal structure to flow properties 
of asphalts. He classified asphalts into three types: Newtonian, 
sol and gel. 

Although "catalytic asphalt" is the term generally 
used to describe air blown asphalts obtained with the use of 
addition agents, the reaction is not strictly a catalytic one. 

The reaction rate may or may not be increased with the use 
of addition agents and in some cases it may even be decreased. 

In many reactions the addition agent is effective by forming 
complexes or intermediate products and hence cannot be recovered 
at the end of the reaction. 

Practically nothing is known about why certain addition 
agents produce a product with higher penetration for a given 
softening point. Hoiberg (15) analyzed Arkansas asphalts

blown with and without phosphorus pentoxide. Although the 
pentoxide blown asphalt showed a very much higher penetration 
for a given softening point than the straight blown asphalt, 
the fractional composition of the two asphalts appear to be 
almost identical. Hoiberg states that perhaps the increased 
penetrations are due to the formation of asphaltene molecules 
of higher molecular weight than produced by straight air blowing. 
Such fractions could be expected to be less susceptible to 
peptization by the resin fractions. Evidently any changes 
brought about by addition agents are primarily the result of 
changes in the colloidal nature of the asphalt. Chemical 
reaction may also be a factor.

III. INDUSTRIAL PRACTICE 

Blown asphalts are manufactured either by a batch or 
continuous process. In the batch process, two general types 
of stills are used, the horizontal and the vertical. The 
horizontal type is simply a large cylindrical vessel horizon¬ 
tally mounted, usually holding about 5000 gallons of charge. 

Heat is applied by direct fire and air is supplied by high 
capacity blowers. The vertical stills are cylindrical towers 
set upright having a capacity of from 6000 to 20000 gallons. 

Air is admitted through perforated pipes at the bottom of the 
still. Because the air is in contact with the charge for a 
longer period of time, vertical stills are more efficient. 
However, vertical stills require more complicated heating 
systems and a higher pressure air supply is needed due to 
the greater depth of asphalt. 

In batch air blowing the still is charged with a 
base stock at approximately 450 °F. and the charge is then blown 
for a period of five to fifteen hours at an air rate of 30 to 
75 cubic feet per minute per ton of asphalt. The air may be 
blown either through the still under pressure, or else drawn 
through the still by subjecting the contents of the still to 
partial vacuum up to 20 inches of mercury. The loss depends 
entirely upon the amount of volatile matter contained in the 
residual oil, and varies from practically 0 to 10 percent of 
the weight of the charge, depending upon the extent the charge

is blown. It is contended that vacuum process removes the oily 
and greasy materials from the residual oil and forms a brighter 
and cleaner looking blown asphalt. The more asphaltic the crude 
from which the residual oil is derived, the better will be the 
quality of the blown product, and the shorter the duration of 
the blowing process. Non-asphaltic petroleums will yield a 
good grade of blown asphalt if first subjected to a high temp¬ 
erature and pressure. The blowing reaction is exothermic and 
additional heating of the charge is not necessary once the air 
is admitted. Quite often the air rate needs to be reduced or 
the charge cooled by circulation through coils to prevent excess¬ 
ive temperature rise. The blowing can be carried out up to a 
temperature of about 600 °F., but often it is limited to lower 
temperatures because of the danger of cracking. Further, the 
blowing temperature should not be higher than the flash point 
of the charge, and preferably it should be 25 degrees lower. 

It can be seen that the temperature control and the effective 
use of air are very important considerations in the blowing 
process. Both of these considerations have been satisfactory 
dealt with in the continuous blowing processes now in operation. 
One type consists essentially of a vertical vessel with multiple 
air-jets passing through the base. The level of the asphalt 
is maintained constant, and the air supply is so regulated that 
the maximum use of the available oxygen is attained. With this 
type of plant, temperature control is greatly facilitated and

and uniform products are obtained. 

The method by which the catalyst is introduced depends 
on the nature of the particular compound. Gaseous or readily 
vaporized agents can, of course, be supplied with the air, 
soluble salts can be injected in solution into the charge, and 
metallic and nonmetallic powders can be mixed thoroughly with 
a portion of the charge and then pumped into the still.

IV. EXPERIMSNTAL PROGRAM 

A series of tests was planned to determine the nature 
of products obtainable by straight air blowing of Redwater 
asphalt base stock and to evaluate the effect of phosphorus 
pentoxide as a "catalyst? 1 . The first series of these tests 
j^tere designed to obtain basic data on the effect of air rate 
and blowing temperature upon straight air blowing, as well as 
to serve as a standard of comparison. It was decided to conduct 
tests at air rates of 55 and 75 cubic feet per minute per ton 
of charge and at temperatures of 465 and 525 °F. 

The second series of tests were intended to show the 
effect of using phosphorus pentoxide as a Catalyst" in the 
blowing of the asphalt base stock. These tests were planned 
to evaluate the effect of 0.25%, 0.50% and 1.0% phosphorus 
pentoxide at the same air rates and temperatures employed in 
the first series. A supplementary test was also planned to 
evaluate the possibility of re-use of the residue expected from 
"catalytic" tests. 

A third and final series of tests was planned to show 
whether different methods of dispersing the phosphorus pentoxide 
into the base stock would give different effects. The dispersing 
methods considered were mortar and pestle, mortar and pestle 
and the use of a 100 mesh screen as a suspending medium in 
the still, hand stirring, and use of a "dry" medium such as 
carbon tetrachloride.

V. EQjJIBtENT 

The pilot tests were conducted as a batch process 
in a conventional vertical cylindrical still as illustrated 
in Figures 1 and 2. The still proper was approximately 10 
inches in diameter and 30 inches in height, and was mounted 
on a support made of 1 inch angle iron and J inch diameter 
steel pipes. The charge was introduced at the top by removing 
the \ inch thick cover plate which was bolted to the still 
by four \ inch diameter bolts. Samples were withdrawn from 
one of the three sampling connections placed at different 
levels on the still. Attached to the bottom of the still 
was a fire box made of 16 gauge steel plate. Heat was applied 
directly by a 7 inch diameter ring type gas burner with auto¬ 
matic air control. Air was admitted into the charge through 
a spiral air coil set at the bottom of the still as shown in 
Figure 3. This air coil was made of \ inch o. d. mild carbon 
steel tubing, perforated with 7 holes 1/32 inch in diameter 
spaced 5 inches apart. These holes were all directed to the 
top of the still. A thermocouple well, also made of \ inch 
o. d. mild carbon steel tubing, was situated 4 inches from 
the bottom of the still. A J inch vent line was provided to 
conduct the fumes outside the building. In addition, a con¬ 
nection was supplied for introduction of steam as a fire pre¬ 
caution. -cor all lines and connections, standard J inch piping 
was used throughout.

Both the air rate and temperature of blowing were 
controlled, the former manually and the latter automatically. 

The flow was measured by a calibrated orifice, consisting of 
a l/32 inch thick brass plate with a 1/16 inch diameter hole, 
mounted on a J inch union. The temperature control was some¬ 
what more refined. Two thermocouples were used, an iron- 
const ant an thermocouple connected to a Leeds and Northrup 
portable potentiometer for actual temperature measurement, 
and a chrome1-alumel thermocouple connected to a Brown milli- 
voltmeter pyrometer controller for temperature control. The 
pyrometer actuated an on-off solenoid gas valve, thus controlling 
the rate of gas feed. The gas valve was on a by-pass of the 
main gas line, the latter providing the bulk of the gas required 
for heating the asphalt. The blowing temperature could be 
controlled within £3 °F.

VI. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 


For all the tests, approximately 30 pounds of asphalt 
base stock were weighed, heated until fluid and poured into 
the still. The cover plate of the still was replaced and the 
heating of the charge was continued in the still. 

The first series of tests dealt with the straight air 
blowing of the base stock. As soon as the charge reached the 
blowing temperature, the stop-dock was started and the needle 
valve turned open immediately to admit air into the charge 
through a spiral air coil. The needle valve was adjusted so 
that the desired air rate was indicated by the readings on 
the Crosby pressure gauge and on the mercury manometer. At 
regular time intervals, an approximately one pound sample was 
withdrawn for testing. The blowing was continued until an 
asphalt with at least a 220 °F.- softening point was obtained. 

At this point, the blowing was discontinued and the entire 
content of the still discharged. Before start of another test, 
the interior of the still was scraped free of any adhering 
asphalt and cleaned with varsol. 

The second series of tests was to show the effect of 
using phosphorus pentoxide as a "catalyst” in air blowing the 
base stock. The phosphorus pentoxide was thoroughly dispersed 
in the base stock by use of a mortar and pestle and the resulting 
mixture air blown. The procedures used are described in detail 
below. The amount of pentoxide employed was varied from zero

up to one percent. A residue was found to be present in the 
still at the end of the "catalytic" tests. The presence of 
this residue raised the question whether the residue could 
be re-used in place of the phosphorus pentoxide and give similar 
results. The residue from one of the pentoxide test was carefully 
collected. One-half of this residue was dispersed into the 
base stock with exactly the same procedure as followed in the 
tests using the mortar and pestle type dispersions. The other 
half of the residue was analyzed for the percent of phosphorus 
pentoxide expressed as phosphorus pentoxide. The analytical 
procedures employed are described in Appendix 1. 

The third series of tests was concerned with different 
methods of dispersing the phosphorus pentoxide into the base 
stock. In the dispersion by mortar and pestle, 10 percent of 
the charge to the still was withdrawn and heated to a temperature 
above 400°F. A weighed amount of phosphorus pentoxide was then 
added to the asphalt and ground in a mortar and pestle until a 
well dispersed paste was obtained. The air valve of the still 
was opened slightly to give the desired air rate and the dispersed 
paste added to the charge in the still; the charge in the still 
was already at its blowing temperature. The dispersion operation 
took approximately one-half hour and at no time was the mixture 
allowed to drop below 400°F. 

In the dispersion by hand stirring, a similar procedure 
as with mortar and pestle was followed, but the pentoxide and

asphalt were stirred and agitated vigorously for one-half 
hour with a stirring rod made from a J inch diameter steel 
rod. On appearance, the method did not produce as good a 
dispersion as by mortar and pestle. Many agglomerates of 
"catalyst" were visible after stirring. 

When dispersing the pent oxide by mortar and pestle 
or by hand stirring, it was found important to add the pentoxide 

in small portions. When large portions were added, the pentoxide 

* 

had a tendency to form large lumps, which could not be dispersed 
into the asphalt. 

Phosphorus pentoxide is highly hygroscopic and in the 
presence of air it will readily absorbed enough moisture to 
form at least a water film around each pentoxide particle. 

Since water and asphalt are immiscible, it was believed that 
with this water film the pentoxide particles may not react as 
readily with the asphalt and tend instead to agglomerate. 

For this reason, it was decided to investigate the possibility 
of first immersing the phosphorus pentoxide in carbon tetrachloride 
and then adding this mixture to the asphalt charge. The required 
amount of phosphorus pentoxide was weighed in a beaker and 
immediately covered by 300 ml of carbon tetrachloride. With 
the charge at the blowing temperature, the needle valve was 
opened to the desired air rate and the pentoxide"carbon tetra¬ 
chloride mixture was poured into the still slowly to prevent 
foaming as the carbon tetrachloride rapidly vaporized off.

As was stated earlier, a certain amount of residue 
was present in the still at the end of each pentoxide test. 

It was believed that since some of the larger particles of 
pentoxide may have settled out during the blowing, the contact 
surface area between the pentoxide and asphalt may have been 
reduced. Therefore, in the dispersion by mortar and pestle 
and screen, a 100 mesh brass screen was placed 2f inches from 
the still bottom to support any pentoxide particles that tended 
to settle out during the blowing. The actual dispersion procedure 
was the same as that for the mortar and pestle. 

The original base stock and samples from all tests 
were examined for the following properties: 

Softening point (Ring and Ball) 

Penetration at 32 °F., 200 grams, 60 seconds 
77 °F., 100 grams, 5 seconds 
100 °F. , 100 grams, 5 seconds 
115 °F., 50 grams, 5 seconds 
Saybolt Furol viscosity at 210 °F., 250 °F., 275 °F. 
Ductility at 77 °F. 

Specific gravity at 77 °F. 

Solubility in carbon tetrachloride 
Methods of the American Society of Testing Materials (3) were 
followed in making the tests. The designations are given 
in Appendix II. 

In addition to the above tests, samples of a straight 






























■ 














23 


blown and a pentoxide blown test covering the softening point 
range from 107 °F. to 210 °F. were analyzed for the percent 
asphaltenes, resins and oily constituents. The procedures 
employed for the analyses were essentially the method proposed 
by 0. G. Strieter (39). The slight modifications are presented 
in Appendix ill. The mean molecular weights of the three 
fractions were determined by a cryoscopic method using water- 
saturated benzene as the solvent. The procedure of Hoiberg, 
Hougen and Zapata (17) was employed. The details are presented 
in Appendix IV.

VII. ECTERB^ENTAL RESULTS 

The results of the examination of the Redwater asphalt 
base stock are presented in Table I. This table indicates 
that the base stock has a softening point of 107 °F. , a pene¬ 
tration of 148 at 77 °F. , a viscosity of 540 seconds at 210 °F. , 
and a flash point greater than 350 °F. Table II to XIII 
inclusive present the results of each pilot test. These tables 
are headed by the operating conditions of the test, such as 
weight of charge, air rate, blowing temperature, barometric 
pressure, the amount of phosphorus pentoxide and the method 
of dispersing it. The accumulative blowing time at the instant 
of sampling is shown in the first column. The sample number 
is in column two. The results of the tests of the samples 
for softening point, penetration, Saybolt Furol viscosity, 
ductility, specific gravity, solubility in carbon tetrachloride, 
and fractional composition follow in the remaining columns. 

Tables II to IV inclusive present the results of the 
straight blown tests conducted under different operating conditions. 
Tables V to IX inclusive offer the results of the tests with 
phosphorus pent oxide dispersed by mortar and pestle. The first 
three tables of pentoxlde blown tests show the effect of varying 
the percent of pentoxlde with the blowing temperature and air 
rate both constant, and the remaining two tables show the effect 
of using a different blowing temperature and a different air- 
rate with the percent of pentoxide constant. The results of

VIII. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 

By various air blowing procedures on Redwater asphalt 
base stock, a very wide range of closely controlled products 
may be obtained. Generally speaking, the blown product is 
harder (lower penetration), heavier, lower in ductility, higher 
in viscosity, and higher in softening point than before the 
blowing; the extent of the change in properties being dependent 
upon the reaction time (time of blowing), the temperature of 
blowing, the air rate, the use of "catalyst" (and presumably, 
the method of dispersing it). It is convenient to illustrate 
the effect of time, temperature and air rate on the physical 
properties by reference to the softening point which perhaps 
is the single most important physical property of an asphalt. 

For this reason, all test results are related to the softening 
point. 

Series 1 - Straight Air Blowing 
Effect of Temperature and Air Rate on Reaction Time 

In the case of the tests conducted without the use 
of phosphorus pentoxide, the effect of temperature and air 
rate on the reaction time is presented in Figure 5, the progress 
of the reaction being measured by the change in the softening 
point. The data indicate that increasing the blowing temperature 
from 465 °F. to 525 °F. reduces the time required to reach a 
220 °F. softening point asphalt to almost one-half. A similar 
effect occurs when the blowing temperature is fixed and the 
air rate increased.

Effect of Temperature and Air Rate on Penetration, Viscosity , 

Ductility, Softening Point Relationships 

Temperature and air rate have substantially the same 
effect upon the other physical properties of the asphalt. 

This is indicated by the fact that the relationships between 
the other properties and the softening point (chosen as the 
reference property) are changed very little by either temperature 
or air rate. Figures 6 to 11 inclusive indicate only a very 
slight effect of the blowing temperature, within the range of 
465 to 525°F., on the penetration-softening point, viscosity¬ 
softening point, and ductility-softening point relationships. 
Figure 7 shows the corresponding small effect of the air rate, 
within the range 55 to 75 cubic feet per minute per ton of 
charge, on the penetration-softening point relationship. It 
is concluded that increasing the blowing temperature or the 
air rate, or both, does not change the properties of the final 
asphalt with relation to a given softening point, but it does, 
however, decrease the reaction time markedly. 

Series 2 - Air Blowing 
with Phosphorus Pentoxide "Catalyst " 

Effect of Phosphorus Pentoxide on Reaction Time 

In the tests conducted with phosphorus pentoxide as 
an addition agent, the results indicate a retarding effect on 
reaction rate or an increase in the reaction time. The degree 
by which the reaction time is increased is dependent on the 










41 


amount of phosphorus pentoxide. This effect is illustrated 
in Figure 12. While it requires approximately 6 hours to 
produce a 230 °F. softening point asphalt with no "catalyst", 
more than 10 hours are necessary to produce the same softening 
point in the presence of 1.0 percent phosphorus pentoxide. 

From the industrial point of view, this increase in reaction 
time, while it would decrease capacity and increase air require¬ 
ments, is not entirely undesirable since it would allow better 
control and therefore permit a better product, it is also 
interesting to note that the phosphorus pentoxide has a retarding 
effect on the reaction rate only in the early stages of the 
blowing. In the later stages, the reaction rate appears to 
be nearly constant at a value (measured in terms of rate of 
change of softening point) of approximately 24 Fahrenheit degrees 
per hour. This value is. seen to be independent of the amount 
of phosphorus pentoxide employed, at least up to one percent. 

Effect of Temperature and Air Rate 

As with the tests conducted without phosphorus pentoxide, 
the increase in the blowing temperature and the air rate have 
substantially the same effect; that is, as illustrated in 
Figures 13 and 14, the reaction time is reduced but the penetration¬ 
softening point relationship remains unchanged. However, it 
is interesting to compare Figure 13 with Figure 5. It may be 
seen that the time required to reach a given softening point 
asphalt may be reduced either by increasing the blowing temperature

or by increasing the air rate. This degree of time reduction 
is different for the straight blown and pentoxide blown tests, 
although in both cases the operating variables are the same. 

If curve 2 is compared to curve 1 in the respective graphs, 
an increase in the blowing temperature in the pentoxide blown 
test produces a smaller decrease in reaction time than in the 
straight blown test. Similarly, comparing curve 3 to curve 2, 
an increase in the air rate in the pentoxide blown test gives 
a much greater decrease in reaction time than in the straight 
blown test. It may be observed that at the early stages of the 
blowing process, the reaction time curves for the pentoxide 
blown tests show a greater curvature than do tho'se for the 
tests conducted in the absence of "catalyst". 

Effect of Phosphorus Pentoxide on Penetration. Viscosity. 

Ductility, Softening Point Relationships 

With the addition of small amounts of phosphorus 
pentoxide, the relationships between the other physical properties 
of the blown asphalt and the softening point are changed sub¬ 
stantially. Figures 15 to 18 inclusive indicate that the 
penetration of the blown asphalt is increased appreciably 
for a given softening point. Under similar blowing conditions 
and with the same dispersion method, this penetration increase 

is approximately proportional to the amount of pentoxide added, 

in the 1.0 percent phosphorus pentoxid< 

at least up to one percent. As indicated in Figure 16, the 

increase is of the order of 10 penetration units at 77 °F.

for a 220 °F. softening point asnhalt. Based on the penetration 
of a straight blown product of the same softening point, this 
would represent approximately a 130 percent increase in pene¬ 
tration number. At lower softening points, this increase in 
penetration number is considerably less. 

Figure 19 shows the effect of phosphorus pentoxide 
on the viscosity-softening point relationship of the blown asphalt. 
For a given softening point, the viscosity is increased with 
increasing percentages of phosphorus pentoxide used. Because 
the viscosity apparatus was built to operate only at 210 °F. 
or lower, it was difficult to keep the temperature of the test 
samples constant at higher temperatures. Hence considerable 
trouble was encountered in determining viscosities at 250 °F. 
and 275 °F. Several trials had to be made on each sample before 
a suitable check could be obtained. It was intended initially 
to determine the viscosity at 325 °F. or at a sufficient high 
temperature to test 220 °F. softening point asphalt. However, 
due to the difficulty encountered at the lower temperatures, 
this was not possible. 

The pentoxide blown asphalts were tested for their 
ductilities at 77 °F. and the results are shown in Figure 20. 
Asphalts blown to a softening point less than 130 °F. with 
0.5 and 1.0 percent phosphorus pentoxide ^.o show a much lower 
ductility than those blown with 0.25 and zero percent phosphorus 
pentoxide. Blown asphalts with softening points between 130 




44 


and 140 °F. are in the "critical zone". The ductility changes 
in this zone from 80 to approximately 10 cms. Because of the 
nature of the test and insufficient test data, the curves in 
this zone are considered not too satisfactory. Blown asphalts 
with softening points greater than 140 °F. show approximately 
the same ductility whether they were blown with or without 
phosphorus pentoxide. 

For blown asphalts with softening points less than 
130 °F., the data are inconclusive, but seem to indicate a 
ductility decrease with increasing amounts of phosphorus 
pentoxide. It appears probable that the phosphorus pentoxide 
requires some time before it completely reacts with the asphalt 
and hence at the early stages of the blowing, the ductility 
may decrease due to the entrainment of unreacted pentoxide. 
Effect of the Pentoxide Residue 

As mentioned earlier, in air blowing the asphalt base 
stock in the presence of phosphorus pentoxide, a certain amount 
of residue was found present in the bottom of the still at the 
end of the test. This residue had the appearance od coke and 
did not dissolve readily in carbon tetrachloride or in benzene. 
This hard gritty residue may have been formed either by the 
oxidation of the asphalt by particles of phosphorus pentoxide 
or polymerizing reactions between the asphalt and the pentoxide. 
In the initial pentoxide tests, the appearance of this residue 
raised some doubts as to the reproducibility of the tests. 




















. 






















■ I 
































































■

45 


However, further tests with the same percentage of phosphorus 
pentoxide made under identical operating conditions yielded 
the same penetration-softening point relationship and removed 
these doubts. 

The presence of the residue also raised the question 
whether the residue could be re-used in place of phosphorus 
pentoxide to produce the same effect on the penetration-softening 
point relationship. If this residue could be re-used, it would 
mean a large saving in cost in commercial operations. 

From a 0.5 percent pentoxide test, 600 grams of the 
residue were recovered. This residue was analyzed and found 
to contain 8.59 percent phosphorus expressed as phosphorus 
pentoxide; the remainder was assumed to be carbonaceous material. 
Using a charge of 30.3 pounds or 13,800 grams, 69 grams of 
phosphorus pentoxide were dispersed into the base stock. 

From the residue, 51.6 grams of phosphorus pentoxide were 
accounted for. This meant that only 17.4 grams or 25.4 percent 
of the pentoxide added reacted with the asphalt, the remaining 
51.6 grams or 74.6 percent appeared in the residue. 

Three hundred grams of the recovered residue containing 
25.8 grams of phosphorus expressed as phosphorus pentoxide 
were dispersed into 29.3 pounds or 13,300 grams of base stock. 
Theoretically, this should be equivalent to an addition of 
0.19 percent phosphorus pentoxide. Some of the phosphorus 
may not have been present as phosphorus pentoxide and accordingly

- 46 


the value may be lower than 0.19 percent. Very little trouble 
was encountered in the dispersion. At the end of the test, 
only a small amount of residue was present in the still. 
Unfortunately, this residue was not recovered and hence it 
was not possible to analyze for phosphorus pentoxide. The 
results of this test on the re-use of the residue are presented 
in Figure 12, and Figures 15 to 20 inclusive along with those 
of the normal pentoxide blown tests. 

The effect of the residue on the reaction time is 
illustrated in Figure 12. The data indicate the pentoxide 
residue to be only 1/4 to 1/3 as effective in increasing the 
reaction time as phosphorus pentoxide. As with the pentoxide 
tests, the reaction time curve of the residue test exhibits 
a constant slope at the later stages of the blowing process. 

With the use of the pentoxide residue a favorable 
shift in the penetration-softening point relationship is 
indicated. As shown in Figures 15 to 18 inclusive, the 
penetration increase for a given softening point is about 
what would be expected with the same percentage of fresh phos¬ 
phorus pentoxide. It appears that the pentoxide residue 
is as effective as the phosphorus pentoxide itself. In fact, 
it seems that the use of the pentoxide residue has an advantage 
since the residue is non-hygroscopic and it does not show the 
same tendency to agglomerate during dispersion. The residue 
reduces the reaction time as compared to the phosphorus pentoxide, 



• 47 


and therefore it will increase capacity and decrease air 
requirements. In addition, only a small amount of residue was 
found present in the bottom of the still after the test. This 
means that the "catalyst” handling, dispersion, and cleaning 
problems will be greatly simplified and reduced. In commercial 
operations, these factors are very important. 

As illustrated in Figures 19 and 20, the use of the 
residue has the same effect as phosphorus pentoxide in the 
viscosity-softening point and ductility-softening point relation¬ 
ships. Comparing the residue curve to the zero percent pentoxide 
curve, the viscosity (referred to a given softening point; 
is increased and this increase approximates very closely the 
increase produced by 0.25 percent phosphorus pentoxide. However, 
the ductility curve of the residue is almost identical with 
the curve obtained with zero percent phosphorus pentoxide. 

Effect of Phosphorus Pentoxide on Asphaltenes, Resins and 

Oily Constituents 

In attempting to explain the changes which take place 
when the asphalt base stock was air blown, the fractional 
composition of the asphalt was considered. Samples of a straight 
blown and a pentoxide blown test covering the softening point 
range from 107 °F. to 210 °F. were analyzed and separated into 
the three major fractions: asphaltenes, resins and oily consti¬ 
tuents. It is well to remember, however, that although each 
fraction has general characteristics wliich are distinctive, 






. 


















































- 48 


its properties and yields vary with the source and 

method of analysis. For this reason, correlations of fractional 

composition with physical properties and service behavior which 

hold for asphalts from different crude oils are difficult to 

develop. 

Figure 21 shows the change in the fractional composition 
of the asphalt base stock as it is air blown with and without 
the use of phosphorus pentoxide. The air blowing increases the 
asphaltenes from about 20 to 40 percent and at the same time 
reduces the resins from approximately 45 to 25 percent. Only 
a slight change in the proportion of oily constituents occurs. 

The fractional compositions of the straight blown and the pentoxide 
blown asphalts are found to be almost identical, at least within 
two percent. This is consistent with Heiberg*s observations (15). 
Perhaps this two percent difference is sufficient to cause the 
difference in the physical properties of the straight blown 
and pentoxide blown asphalts. However, more data are needed on 
blown asphalts produced from different base stocks and with 
different addition agents before the behavior of the straight blown 
and pentoxide blown asphalts can be related to their fractional 
composition. 

The properties of the asphaltenes, resins and oily consti¬ 
tuents were examined and found to be consistent with those 
reported in the literature (23, 27, 28, 29, 33, 36, 40). 

The asphaltenes were dark brown to black powdery solids. 

Upon heating, they did not melt but sintered and fused and 









49 


finally decomposed into a compact, hard coke-like material. 

They were soluble in benzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 
and carbon disulphide, but insoluble in alcohol, ether, acetone, 
and petroleum naphtha. The asphaltenes were considered to be 
the substances that impart "body" and "hardness" to the asphalt. 

The resins were low melting point solids. They were 
reddish brown substances which were soluble in light petroleum 
naphtha, benzene, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon 
disulphide, but only sparingly soluble in hot or cold acetone. 

The resins gave the asphalt its ductility and tensile strength. 

The oily constituents at room temperature exhibited 
the properties of a viscous liquid. They were light yellow in 
color. They differed from resins in that they remained 
dissolved in light petroleum naphtha after treatment with anhy¬ 
drous alumina or adsorbent clay, whereas the resins were adsorbed. 
The oily constituents had the appearance of a heavy lubricating 
oil. The primary function of the oily constituents was to act 
as a dispersing medium for the asphaltenes and resins. As a 
general rule, the softer the asphalt, the higher will be its content 
of oily constituents. 

Besides examining the properties of the asphaltenes, 
resins and oil constituents and determining how the percent 
of each varied on air blowing, the mean molecular weights of 
the three fractions were determined. Figure 22 shows that the 
mean molecular weight of the fractions increases markedly 



.

50 


with air blowing. The mean molecular weight of the asphaltenes 
increases from about 1000 to 3000, the resins from approximately 
600 to 900, and the oily constituents from 500 to 700. Since 
the molecular weights were determined by a cryoscopic method, the 
accuracy of the results was dependent on the amount of the 
fraction used and the accuracy by which the temperature depression 
may be measured. The amount of the fraction was limited by 
the size of the Soxhlet extractor available for separating the 
asphalt into the various fractions. The molecular weights reported 
are considered accurate within -15 percent for the asphaltenes, 

-6 percent for the resins, and ±5 percent for the oily consti¬ 
tuents. Therefore referring to Figure 22, it can be stated that 
likely the pentoxide blowing forms asphaltenes with a lower mean 
molecular weight and oily constituents with a higher mean mole¬ 
cular weight than that produced by straight air blowing. The 
molecular weights of the resins are quite similar whether they 
are formed by straight air blowing or "catalytic j blowing. 

Hoiberg (15) stated that in the pentoxide tests, the increased 
penetrations may perhaps be due to the formation of asphaltenes of 
higher molecular weight than that produced by straight air blowing. 
However, he did not report any actual experimental data. As shorn 
in this investigation and illustrated in Figure 22, asphaltenes 
of lower mean molecular weight are produced by "catalytic 11 blowing 
than by straight air blowing.

Series 5 - Air Blowing with Phosphorus Pentoxide 
Dispersed by Different Methods 
Effect of Dispersion Method on Reaction Time 

The method of dispersing the phosphorus pentoxide 
in the asphalt was found to be comparable in importance to 
the amount of phosphorus pentoxide used. Figure 23 illustrates 
the effect of different dispersion methods on the reaction 
time. It seems that dispersion by use of carbon tetrachloride 
produces, except at the very early stages of blowing, a higher 
reaction rate compared with that of the straight blown test. 

That is, the use of carbon tetrachloride decreases the reaction 
time required to produce a given softening point asphalt. This 
is contrary to what is expected since the earlier investigations 
indicate that the pentoxide, when dispersed by mortar and pestle, 
increases the reaction time. This decrease is believed due to 
the action of the carbon tetrachloride. Although practically 
all the carbon tetrachloride is flashed off immediately, 
possibly the slightest amount remaining in solution is sufficient 
to speed up the reaction. It is also possible that this reaction 
rate increase may be due to the action of by-products formed 
from carbon tetrachloride. It is known that at high temperatures, 
carbon tetrachloride will form phosgene. While dispersing the 
phosphorus pentoxide into the asphalt by carbon tetrachloride, 

extreme precautions are required. When the pentoxide-carbon 
tetrachloride mixture is added to the hot asphalt in the still, 
excessive foaming takes place. The fumes that are given off 











52 


are very sharp, penetrating and extremely poisonous. 

Dispersion of phosphorous pentoxide by hand stirring, 
mortar, pestle and screen produce apparently similar effects 
on the reaction rate. The reaction rate is decreased and 
hence a longer reaction time is required to form a given 
softening point asphalt. The reaction time is greatest when 
the pentoxide is dispersed by hand stirring. As the method 
of dispersion is improved by use of a mortar and pestle and 
finally by use of a mortar, pestle and screen, the reaction 
time is decreased accordingly. This observation contradicts 
the observation that the increase in reaction time is due to 
the effect of the phosphorus pentoxide. If this were so, it 
might be expected that as the method of dispersion improved, 
the reaction time would increase since a better dispersion method 
would provide a greater reacting surface of phosphorus pentoxide - 
the equivalent of a greater amount. 

Although the experimental data indicate that what are 
considered to be better dispersion methods produce lower 
reaction times, the explanation of this phenomenon is apparent. 

A tentative interpretation of this phenomenon is as follows: 

It is assumed that the phosphorus pentoxide reacts readily 
with a certain fraction of the asphalt to form tT gritty 
particles”. Possibly this fraction is that which tends to 
polymerize most readily. This assumption is justified by the 



















.

53 


formation of numerous particles when the pentoxide is dispersed 
and by the appearance of a residue at the still bottom at the 
end of a pentoxide test. Hand stirring seems to produce more 
and larger particles than does mortar and pestle dispersion. 

It is also assumed that during blowing, the asphalt attacks 
and dissolves some of these gritty particles. The solution 
seems to take place only during the actual blowing since during 
the dispersion operation the gritty particles remain insoluble. 

It is believed that the gritty particles are a pentoxide-asphalt 
complex. Experimentally, it has been found that with a greater 
percent of phosphorus pentoxide, the time required to attain 
a given softening point was increased whereas with a better dis¬ 
persion method the reaction time was decreased. A tentative 
explanation is that a larger percent of phosphorus pentoxide 
forms a larger amount of gritty particles and hence, during 
blowing, a longer time is required for the asphalt to completely 
dissolve these gritty particles. A better dispersion method forms 
smaller gritty particles with a larger total surface area for 
reaction and therefore a shorter time is required for their 
solution. 

As illustrated in Figure 12 and Figure 23, the reaction 
rate varies only during the early stages of the blowing. In 
the later stages it reaches an almost constant value for all 
percentages of phosphorus pentoxide indicating the equivalent of 
a straight air blowing pro cess. This it is believed that 



54 


during blowing the gritty particles are gradually settling out 
and hence reaction between the asphalt and the gritty particles 
occurs mostly in the early stages of the blowing. Possibly 
this accounts for the reduction in the ductility of pentoxide 
blown asphalts with softening points less than 130 °F. At the 
higher softening points obtainable by longer blowing, the gritty 
particles have either reacted with the asphalt or have settled out. 

Effect of Dispersion Method on Penetration, Viscosity, Ductility , 
Softening Point Relationships 

Further evidences of the importance of the dispersion 
method is indicated by the fact that the penetration-softening 
point, viscosity-softening point, and ductility-softening point 
relationships are changed appreciably from those produced 
by the straight blown test. Figures £4 to 27 inclusive show 
the effect of the dispersion method on the penetration-softening 
point relationship. It is seen that dispersion by mortar and 
pestle or mortar, pestle and screen give almost identical 
results. These two methods produce the best penetration increase 
for a given softening point, and possibly this is the maximum 
effect that can be obtained with 1.0 percent phosphorus pentoxide. 
Dispersion of the pentoxide by hand stirring and by use of carbon 
tetrachloride produce an intermediate effect on the penetration- 
softening point relationship. In commercial operations, dispersion 
by mortar and pestle would not be practical. It is believed,

55 


however, that in cojnmercial operations the same degree of 
dispersion could be obtained in a ball mill. 

The effect of the dispersion method on the viscosity¬ 
softening point relationship is shown in Figure 28. As with 
the penetrations, dispersion by mortar and pestle or mortar, 
pestle and screen produce maximum viscosity increases for a 
given softening point. 

The results of the ductility test are illustrated in 
Figure 29. The same general type of ductility-softening point 
relationship as observed earlier is again obtained. Generally 
speaking, pentoxide blown asphalts with softening points of 
approximately 130°F. or lower show a much lower ductility than 
the straight blown asphalt. For higher softening point asphalts 
there seems to be no appreciable differences in the ductilities. 
Effect of straight and ^Catalytic TT Air blowing on onecific Gravity 
and Solubility in Carbon Tetrachloride 

For every pilot test, at least 4 samples with different 
softening points were tested for their specific gravity at 77 °F. 
and their solubility in carbon tetrachloride. As illustrated 
in Figure 50, as the softening point of the blown asphalt 
increases from 107 °F. to 235 °F., the specific gravity changes 
from, approximately 1.004 to about 1.026. There seems to be no 
appreciable difference in the measured specific gravity between 
the straight blown and pentoxide bloY/n asphalts. 

With the presence of a large residue in the still at

the end of the pentoxide teste, it was expected that the solubility 
of the pentoxide blown samples would be reduced markedly, especially 
when samples were all drawn from the lowest sampling connection 
flush with the still bottom. However, in all the samples the 
solubility was found to be greater than 99 percent. As indicated 
in Figure 31, on the average the straight blown samples show 
a solubility of 99.8 percent and the pentoxide blown samples 
a solubility of 99.6 percent, a difference of only 0.2 percent. 

This is believed barely significant.

IK. CONCLUSIONS 

This investigation of the air blowing of vacuum reduced 

Redwater asphalt base stock with special reference to the use 

of phosphorus pentoxide suggests the following conclusions: 

(1) The properties of the base stock are changed by air blowing. 

The product is harder (lower penetration), heavier, lower 

in ductility, higher in viscosity, and higher in softening 
point tjian before the blowing* 

(2) The fractional composition of the asphalt is changed with 

air blowing; the asphaltenes increasing, the resins decreasing 
and the oily constituents changing comparatively little. 

(.3) The mean molecular weights of the three fractions (asphaltenes, 
resins and oily constituents) are increased markedly on air 
blowing. 

(4) The effect of increasing the blowing temperature or the 
air rate, or both, does not change the properties of the 
final asphalt with relation to a given softening point, 
but does jignificantly decrease the reaction time. 

(5) With the addition of small amounts of phosphorus pentoxide, 
the reaction time, penetration, and Saybolt Furol viscosity 
of the blown asphalt are increased appreciably for a given 
softening point. With the same method of dispersing the 
phosphorus pentoxide, the increase is dependent on the 
quantity of phosphorus pentoxide, at least in the range 
from zero to one percent.

(6) With the same dispersing method for the phosphorus pentoxide, 
asphalts blown to softening point less than 130 °F. with 

0,5 and 1.0 percent pentoxide showed a much lower ductility 
than those blown with 0 and 0.25 percent pentoxide. kor 
higher softening point asphalts, there is no appreciable 
differences in the ductilities obtained. 

(7) The use of the residue formed from a phosphorus pentoxide 
test produced the same general effect on the reaction time 
curve, penetration-softening point, Saybolt Furol viscosity¬ 
softening point, and ductility-softening point relationships 
as obtained with the use of fresh phosphorus pentoxide. 

(8) The method of dispersing the phosphorus pentoxide in the 
asphalt base stock is comparable in importance to the amount 
of phosphorus pentoxide used. With a better method of 
dispersion, a greater increase in penetration and viscosity 
and a greater decrease in reaction time, as referred to 

a given softening point, are obtained. The decrease in 
reaction time appears almost contradictory to the increase 
in penetration. The phenomenon is not clearly understood.

APPENDIX I 

ANALYSIS uF THE RESIDUE 

•‘■he standard procedures of the Association of Official 
Agricultural Chemists (31) were used to determine the percent 
phosphorus pent oxide in the residue. A summary of the procedures 
is presented here. 

A representative sample of the residue is ashed at 
low temperature with sodium carbonate and sodium nitrate to 
volatilize off the carbonaceous material. The purpose of the 
sodium carbonate and sodium nitrate is to prevent loss of phos¬ 
phorus pentoxide during ashing, by converting it to sodium 
phosphate. The ash is dissolved in nitric acid and the phosphate 
in solution is precipitated as ammonium phosphomolybdate with 
ammonium molybdate. The precipitate is then dissolved with 
dilute ammonium hydroxide, and the phosphate reprecipitated 
as magnesium ammonium phosphate by the addition of magnesia 
reagent (magnesium chloride and ammonium chloride in ammoniacal 
solution). A double precipitation was necessary to obtain a 
precipitate entirely free from interfering substances. The 
precipitate is weighed and the percent phosphorus pentoxide 
calculated.

APPENDIX III 

DETERMINATION OF ASPHALTENES. RESINS AND OILY GQ^BTIITTENTS 

The procedure employed for the analyses follows the 
method proposed by 0. G. Strieter (39). A summary of the modified 
procedure is presented here. 

The asphalt is extracted with normal pentane to obtain 
soluble resins and oily constituents and insoluble asphaltenes. 

The resins and oily constituents are separated by dispersing 
them on anhydrous alumina. The unadsorbed oily constituents 
are recovered by extraction with normal pentane. The resins 
adsorbed on the alumina are recovered by eluting with benzene 
. and methanol. 

The details of the modifications are as follows: 

Instead of the 35 grams of Fuller r s earth as used in Strieter’s 
procedures, 100 grams of anhydrous alumina, technical grade, 
were used for adsorbing the resins. According to Mack (24), 
the resins undergo some changes in composition in the Fuller’s 
earth in which a material is recovered which behaves something 
like asphaltenes. It was found that after the alumina mixture 
was transferred to the Soxhlet thimble, 2 hours extraction with 
pentane was sufficient, ^he adsorbed resins were eluted in a 
600 ml beaker with four 50 ml portions of methyl alcohol-benzene 
solution (10ml of anhydrous methanol to 90 ml of c.p. benzene).

APPENDIX IV 

PROCEDURE FOR DETERMINING MOLECULAR HEIGHTS 

OF ASPHALTENES, RESINS AND OILY CONSTITUENTS 


Average molecular weights were obtained by a cryoscopic 
method using the depression of the freezing point of water- 
saturated benzene as the criterion. 

Freezing points were determined in a glass test tube 
one inch in diameter. This test tube was inserted in a larger 
test tube, lj inches in diameter, and the whole was immersed 
in an ice bath. The benzene solution in the inner test tube 
was agitated by a wire stirrer operated by a small motor. 

The freezing point depression of benzene solution is seriously 
affected by changes in moisture content due to changes in the 
humidity of the air. This source of error was avoided by first 
saturating the benzene with water. To a liter of benzene 15 ml 
of distilled water were added. The mixture was heated to 125 °F.; 
upon cooling, the solution became cloudy. The method of measuring 
the freezing point was as follows: 

About 25 to 30 grams of water-saturated benzene were 
weighed into the inner test tube, the apparatus assembled, and 
temperature readings with a Beckmann thermometer were taken 
at regular intervals. To prevent super-cooling of more than 
0.2 °C., the solution was seeded as it passed through the freezing 
temperature by inserting crystals of benzene into it by means 
of a fine wire passing through a glass capillary inserted into 
the inner tube. During cooling, readings were taken at regular

time intervals over a period of about 15 minutes. A typical 
freezing point curve was obtained which showed rapid initial 
cooling and supercooling, followed by a rapid rise in temperature 
when crystallization began, and which showed a nearly constant 
temperature decrease as crystallization proceeded. To get 
true freezing point from such a curve, the portion of the curve 
recording the last rate of cooling was extended back to intersect 
the initial rapid cooling portion of the curve. The temperature 
at this point of intersection was taken as the true freezing 
point of the benzene. 

Having determined the freezing point of the solvent 
accurately, add about 0.3 grams, accurately weighed, of the 
asphalt fraction into the water-saturated benzene and determine 
the freezing point of the solution in the same manner as above. 
Record the freezing point depression, substitute in the equation 
below and calculate molecular weight.
