THE ALBERTA DIVISIONAL SCHOOL TRUSTEE 


by J.D. McFetridge and M.T. Sillito 


A Questionnaire study of the Alberta Divisional 
trustee in an attempt to assess what the average trustee 
thinks about some common educational problems, and to 
secure, if possible, some notion of his philosophy of 
education. This study deals specifically with trustees 
in relation to school administration, relations with 
teachers, teacher«-*training, centralization of schools, 
and trustees 1 concepts of the aims of secondary education 
in Alberta. A statistical summary of the questionnaires 
was made and the resulting data, along with a compiled 
history of the ASTA, formed the basis of the thesis. 
Verbatim comments of trustees on the various areas under 
consideration are included as an Appendix*

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM 

Statement of the Problem , The field of local administ- 
ration in Alberta schools appears to be one in which little 
research has been done. Alberta h a s been on the frontier 
in several fields in education, and this, coupled with the 
province 1 s geographic diversity, has given local admlnistra- 
tors a great variety of experience. It seemed reasonable to 
suppose that information of value to education in this pro** 
vince could be gathered by tapping this reservoir of practi¬ 
cal experience. It was proposed, therefore, to make a sur¬ 
vey of the thinking of trustees on certain problems in edu¬ 
cation and to secure, if possible, some notion of their edu¬ 
cational philosophy. 

Importance of the Problem, In the business of running the 
schools of the province, the trustees have spent several 
millions of dollars each year. While it was recognized that 
the general direction of the spending of this money was 
determined by provincial regulation and policy, yet there w&s 
certainly enough latitude given trustees that a variety of 
quality in Alberta schools has resulted. This variety was 
probably not attributable to any one factor, but it seemed 
apparent that those who spent the money were important people 
in education. The power of the purse held by local trustees

was limited both by local pressures and government regula¬ 
tions. However, it seemed important to remember that these 
people were 11 in the thick of it M , that they were the ones who 
signed the cheque, that they were the ones who had to assess 
and respond to local opinion, that in essence they were the 
ones who had to translate regulations, opinions and money 
into the tangibles of education. What they were and what 
they bought was considered important to education. This 
thesis was designed to assess this trustee variable in edu¬ 
cation. 

TERMS 

Trustee - Except in the Chapter on the ASTA history, this 
word refers to the Divisional Trustee. In limiting the scope 
of this study it was decided that it would deal with Division¬ 
al trustees as they were considered to be a more homogeneous 
group than the entire trustee body of the province* The data 
used in the compilation of Chapter III were not limited in 
this way. 

Association - This refers to the Association of Trustees, 
by whatever official name it was called throughout its history. 
Ce ntralization - The practice of replacing several small 
school plants by a single larger one. 

Divisional System - This refers to the school system estab¬ 
lished by changes in the Alberta School Act brought about in 
1936.

A STATEMENT OF ORGANIZATION 

Chapter One serves as an introduction to the thesis 
and contains this statement of organization* Chapter Two is 
a record of methods of procedure and sources of data which 
were used* Chapter Three is a history of the ASTA. Chapter 
Four is a statistical summary of the data compiled from the 
questionnaires* Chapter Five is concerned with trustees as 
administrators. Chapter Six deals with trustee~teaeher re** 
lationships. Chapter Seven is concerned with trustees and 
teacher training. Chapter Eight deals with trustees and 
centralization. Chapter Nine deals with trustees and the 
aims of secondary education in Alberta* Chapter Ten contains 
a summary, conclusions and recommendations. Two appendices 
are included; the first contains copies of the questionnaires 
and form letters used in this study, the second consists of 
a selection of verbatim trustee comments on the various items 
in the trustees* questionnaire. 

The work of the thesis was divided between the two 
candidates as follows: The aollecting of data and Chapters

One, Two, Three, Four and Ten represent joint effort. In 
chapters Five to Nine inclusive, the portion dealing with 
the presentation and interpretation of data with a general 
note on each chapter was the work of Mr. McFetridge with the 
minor exception that the statement of the purpose of each 
item was done in collaboration. The portion of each of these 
chapters which discusses the philosophy of Trustees was the 
work of Mr, Sillito. A library study of similar investiga¬ 
tions revealed a dearth of material and the report of similar 
studies is, therefore, a null report.

CHAPTER II 


PROCEDURES AND SOURCES OF DATA * 

It was decided that for this survey a questionnaire 
covering the main fields of trustee activity was to be the 
major source of data* These data were to be corroborated by 
and correlated with information obatined from teachers and 
superintendents by means of a shorter questionnaire for each 
group. In all, 480 questionnaires were sent out; 280 to trustees, 
150 to teachers, and 50 to school superintendents. The trustees 1 
questionnaire was designed to give information concerning the 
opinions which presumably reveal the philosophy of the people 
on Divisional School Boards* The questionnaire to teachers 
was designed to indicate certain school board practices* The 
purpose of the questionnaire to superintendents was to obtain 
a comparative opinion on certain problems and to summarize 
some aspects of the existing educational establishment in 
Divisions. Further data on the subject were sought through a 
study of the official organization of trustees, the Alberta 
School Trustees* Association* This objective wag realized 
through a study of ASTA records, through attendance at the 
1949 convention at Calgary, and through interviews with long-* 
term officers of the Association*

STATEMENT OF DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED• 


In carrying out the above procedures certain dif¬ 
ficulties arose. The first request for data from trustees 
resulted in the return of thirty questionnaires. The cam¬ 
paign to increase this number involved a follow-up letter to 
all trustees not replying; personal letters to more than thirty 
truet*ec whose names were suggested by Mr# Andrews, ASTA 
Secretary; and a letter of appeal published in the ASTA 
magazine* These methods, along with personal requests to 
trustees known to the writers, resulted in a total of sixty- 
five completed questionnaires being returned. 

Questionnaires to teachers were distributed per¬ 
sonally to several of the Summer School classes* Eighty-one 
of these were returned. This method proved highly effective, 

Mr* W* Frame, Chief Superintendent of Schools, very 
kindly distributed questionnaires to the superintendents at 
their convention in Edmonton* Sixteen completed questionnaires 
were returned* The co-operation of Mr* Frame Immeasur¬ 
ably strengthened the appeal to this busy group of men* 

The chief difficulty of the ASTA study was that the 
data required for the writing of the history of the Association 
were widely scattered. Records of the very early organization 
of trustees into an association were very scarce*

LIMITA TIONS OF T HE STUDY 

Since this study represents a first exploration in 
a new field of educational research in Alberta, it was des~ 
igned to be general. As a result, major features of this 
field are revealed but detail is not always clarified. 

Questionnaire~type research is usually self~blaslng. 
People answering a questionnaire are usually those with strong- 
opinions. This bias factor is non~roeasurable,tending to 

invalidate the study from a. statistical viewpoint. In this 
questionnaire, which was necessarily wide in scope, (it 
called for 131 separate responses in 29 questions) the biased 
responses from any given trustee would probably be only a 
small proportion of the total number of responses in each 
questionnaire. Moreover, different trustees would have 
different biases so the overall picture on any given item 
might reasonably be expected to have a small bias factor. 

Where there was general bias in any given area, the accom*-* 
panying comments asked for could be expected to reveal it. 

Another limitation of this study hinges on the 
fact that if a person is asked what he is and what he thinks, 
his reply will probably be colored by what he thinks he 
should be and what he should think. For this reason, some 
indirection in the phrasing of questionnaire items was 
necessary. The questionnaire to trustees was designed to

serve a double purpose, that of getting trustee opinion as 
well as attempting to reveal the extent of trustee knowledge 
on certain matters through this expression of opinion. The 
number and variety of comments included in the returned 
questionnaires indicated that this indirection was more than 
moderately successful. For example, thirty-seven of the 65 
trustees who returned questionnaires commented on question 
#13. These comments ranged in length from a single sentence 
to an essay of over 500 words, and revealed much information 
concerning the trustees* grasp of the problem of centrali¬ 
zation.

CHAPTBJR III 


THE AL BERTA SCHOOL TRUSTEES 1 ASSOCI ATION 

Between the formation of the Province of Alberta 
and World War I, a trustees* organization came into being 
in Alberta, The province had inherited a curriculum which 
had been adopted in 1902 and used since then by the Terri** 
torlal G-overnment. When, in the course of time, this curri~ 
culum came up for revision, the Minister of Education 
desired to get an expression of opinion concerning vocational 
training in secondary schools. For this purpose he called 
together a number of trustees. This meeting was the beginning 
of the ASTA, 

It was felt that a study of this trustees* organ** 
ization from its inception to the present day was a very 
necessary part of this study. All trustees in the province 
are now obliged to be members of the ASTA and, as such, re~ 
celve the official publication of the organization, The Alberta 
School Trust ee, It seemed reasonable that attendance at the 
annual conventions of the Association, and the reading of the 
official magazine must, in a measure, color the thinking of 
members. Thus the following history Is included. 

The exact date of the beginning of the ASTA is 
left somewhat in doubt. The long term officers of the associ** 
ation who were interviewed placed it as about 1911* Information 










i 











contained In an unpublished pamphlet prepared by the 
Department of Education places the beginning In 1907* 

Two references from the records of Trustees* Convention 
place it earlier than 1911* One of these references spoke 
of the organization as being in existence in 1909> and the 
other as having begun in 190?. The weight of the evidence 
is in favor of the earlier date. 

In addition to the revision of the curriculum, 
the trustees* organization was concerned with keeping local 
taxes down and in procuring larger provincial grants. 

World War I disrupted the work of this association. 
When interest was revived after the war, the central theme 
of interest had been enlarged. In 1918 the Minister of 
Education, the Hon. George P. Smith, called a meeting of 
interested trustees in Edmonton to discuss the war«created 
problem of teachers 1 salaries and teachers* qualifications. 
The minimum teachers 1 salary had been set at |840 in 1916. 
This figure could be reduced in special cases at the disc** 
retion of the Minister. Members of the Alberta Teachers 1 
Alliance, notably Mr. Newlands, Mr. Shortliffe, and Mr. 
Stanley presented the case for higher salaries for teachers. 
When trustees countered with the Indictment that teacher 
quality was low, the matter of letters of authority entered 
the discussion.

One of the important results of this meeting was 
a decision by the trustees to hold an organization meeting 
in February of 1919 . For this purpose, Mr. W. Davidson was 
elected chairman, and Dr. G. Stanley was made secretary of 
an organization committee. 

The organization meeting was duly called. Those 
in charge of arrangements, anticipating the usual few hun- 
dred delegates, had planned on using a Calgary high school 
auditorium. Some two thousand delegates attended and the 
meeting had to be moved. It finally convened in the United 
Church Hall. If those in charge of arrangements were sur¬ 
prised at the number of delegates, they were even more 
astonished by the enthusiasm and temper of the meeting. 

In reminiscence, the meeting was described as S8 a real 
Donnybrook Fair 18 , Each trustee had evidently been sent 
to the convention with instructions to remove the abuses 
of bureaucracy as seen from the viewpoint of his own local 
school district. It appeared that most of them were very 
conscientious in attempting to carry out their Instructions. 
(These problems of a peculiarly local nature were to become 
a chronic burden to the available time of succeeding con¬ 
ventions.) Mr. W. Davidson had been elected to the chs.ir 
in 1913, but he had resigned prior to the 1919 meeting. The

exuberance of the delegates was too much for his substitute 
and Mr. William Rea of Edmonton took the chair. 

At this meeting Mrs. A.H. Rogers of Fort Saskatch¬ 
ewan was elected Secretary-Treasurer. Mrs. Rogers filled 
this position till December 21st, 19^2. Not only did Mrs. 
Rogers ably discharge her duties as Secretary-Treasurer for 
this long period, but she also assumed the duties of editor 
of the trustees 1 section of the ATA magazine and subsequently 
took over the editorship of the trustees 1 official magazine 
in March 1933* In her capacity as editor, Mrs. Rogers left 
a record, replete with human interest, of the activities, 
Interests and accomplishments of the organization which 
later came to be known as the Alberta School Trustees® Associ¬ 
ation. 


During the period of the 1920*s the Association 
was guided by two Presidents, Mr. William Rea of Edmonton, 
and Mr. T. 0. King of Raymond. Mr. Rea served as President 
until February of 1923• During this time a matter of prime 
concern appears to have been the shortage of money for edu¬ 
cation.

Speaking at a 1923 trustee convention, Mr* ^ea said,' 5 ' 

•'undoubtedly the financial problem is the most serious 

question before us today," 

The relationship between trustees and the Teachers* 

Alliance was dealt with by Mr, hea, when, in addressing the 

convention in 1922 he discussed teachers* contracts. 

After notice of termination is given, the teacher 
may ask for a meeting of the trustees to discuss 
with them the reason"for the termination of 
the contract •,« not only should the teacher be heard 
but his or her representative ,* * as well, and 
they made it very plain to us that the representative 
was to be a representative from the central body 
of the Alliance; this was the 1 2 3 recognition* asked 
for. We could not agree to that. 

The "County System" appears to have been under dis~ 

3 

cussion at the time, Mr, Rea said, 

I wish to deal with *,, the proposed abolition of 
the elected school boards that the control of 

education be placed under the Municipal councils, 
the council to appoint a committee ,•« to deal 
with educational matters, I have no hesitation 
in saying that if such a policy were adopted it 
would be disastrous for the cause of education 
in this province.

Relations with teachers appear to have been a 

source of concern in this period. The nature of this re- 

lationship may best be shown by quoting from the President 1 s 

address delivered by Mr. Rea to the convention in 1922. He 
4 

said. 

We have legislation on the statute books provid¬ 
ing for a conciliation board to settle certain 
disputes between the trustee and the teacher ... 
just see what happens if you could refer salary 
matters to a conciliation board in case of a 
dispute ... if the decision of the conciliation 
board is adverse to the trustees it ultimately 
breaks the. authority of the board of trustees. 

Interest on this subject was continuous through¬ 
out the following years. Again, regarding teachers 1 salaries 

I have read over all the resolutions that have been 
sent in by different school districts to date, and 
I notice that a large number of them deal with the 
salary question and suggest that reductions ... 

(in salaries) ... be made. 

Speaking of teachers 1 strikes, Mr. Rea sald,^ 

But while we must not consider lightly a teachers* 
strike, I want to say that I do not look on these 
matters with much alarm as far as the future is 
concerned. These movements are the result of ... 
imaginary grievances and bad leadership ... I 
feel certain that there will be no permanent 
cleavage between the trustees and the teaching 
body of the Province of Alberta.

Mr. T.O. King of Raymond succeeded Mr, Rea to 
the presidency In 1923* This change brought some shifts 
In the focus of interests of trustees, but the money prob- 
lem still remained. M We find at the present time,® said Mr. 
King in the Presidents address to the 1924 convention,^ 

"that one of the greatest problems in our way is that of 
finance ... I believe our Government made a mistake when 
they reduced school grants in this province. M 

Considering Mr. King*s usually restrained manner 
of speaking, this represents a rather strong statement of 
disapproval. It was made while the Province was going 
through the latter stages of a post-war slump, and general 
improvement in business levels was soon to decrease ASTA 
preoccupation with financial conditions affecting education. 
Apart from this question of finance, the emphasis did change. 

There seemed to be an increasing Interest in cur¬ 
riculum, Some dissatisfaction had been expressed about the 
curriculum being too heavy. Speaking in 192? at the annual 

Q 

convention, Mr. King said, 

I think there is one thing that I should mention 
and that is curriculum ... I hear considerable 
complaint that it does not seem to just satisfy 
all of us. I would plead with you to have a 
little patience with it. I can see splendid

good In it ... I would ask you instead of finding 
fault with the work to try to get the best results. 
Do not discourage your boys and girls ... if we 
have a little patience the problem will be 
straightened out. 


Another change concerned a widening of trustee 
interest to include trustee organization outside the pro¬ 
vince. Mr. King became one of the vice-chairmen of the 
Canadian School Trustees 1 Association in 1927. This gave 
the Alberta trustee a place in the World Conference on 
Education. In November 1926, Mr. King, representing 
Alberta, went to a British Columbia Trustees* convention, 
and reported that he was impressed with the amount of 
financial assistance given to school districts in that 
province by their Provincial Government. 


The Association concerne# Itself with local 
organization and considered the problem of ratepayer edu¬ 
cation regarding educational problems. Mr. King said at 
the 1924 convention,^ 

I believe that our executive, through Prov¬ 
incial Inspectors, should try to form local 
organizations ... In my opinion many of our 
difficulties could be overcome this way ... 
the ratepayers as well as the trustees 
should be brought together ...

Again in 1925, Mr. King said, 10 

I believe that if we as trustees would gather 
In the ratepayers and consult with them ... 
over the problems we have as trustees, they might 
probably help us to solve them. Sometimes they 
seem to think a trustee*s duty is to be a sort 
of bank, to get money, to sign things and carry 
burdens and they will pay the taxes when they are 
ready, but get them together and have them share 
the responsibility. 

In the Presidential address in 192? j Mr. King , s 
humanistic child~centered philosophy which made him the 
popular choice for the president for 14 years, Is illus-* 
trated, 11 


The trustees are really the fathers of the 
children who come under their Jurisdiction, 
and merely hiring the teacher and caring for 
the building and equipping of the school is 
not sufficient ... personal petty things should 
pass away ... look at it from a broad sense ... 
feel that we are interested in every child that 
comes to our school, irrespective of their high 
standing or low standing .,. then we are doing 
our duties as trustees. 

Finally, the trustees 1 concern with the organic 

zation of large units was not dead, but their opposition 

12 

to it was changing somewhat. 

The Minister of Education ham evolved a plan 
of Township Board ... the trustees as a whole, 
from what I can read and learn, are opposed to 
some extent to these Township Boards. They feel

that Is taking away the trust placed in them and 
feel it will not be a good thing on the whole, 
but they have gone so far as to say that if it 
were made optional they would support it ... I 
think this is one of the problems we will have 
to meet in the near future in this Province. 

These things spread. It is starting in the East 
and coming this way. 

Mr. King, in the above speech, pointed out the 

need for reorganization of school administration. ”We have... 
13 

he said, ”a condition which is rather awkward in regard 
to taxation ... part of the taxation is collected by the 
municipality and part ... by the school board ... and it 
has been confusion from start to finish.” 

The so-called ’’Baker Bill”, which proposed the 
introduction of larger administrative units, was presented 
in 1929« This bill was put before a crowded convention of 
trustees whose energetic disapproval rendered the meeting 
memorable. Trustees of long standing recalled this occas- 
ion with a smile after twenty years. 

Throughout the •twenties 1 , Mrs. A.H. Rogers of 
Fort Saskatchewan, served as Secretary-Treasurer of the 
Association. This decade saw the following vice-presidents: 
T.O. King of Raymond, M.E. Sly of Strathmore and F.H. Herbert 
of Strathcona. The Hon. G-eorge P» Smith and the Hon, Perren 
Baker, both Ministers of Education, served as Honorary 
Presidents of the Trustees* Association, as did Mr. W. Rea

of Edmonton. Other vice-presidents were Dr. J.E. Lovering 
of Lethbridge and H.C. Wingate of Calgary, 


Two presidents, Mr. T.O. King of Raymond and Dr. 

C.A. Staples of Stettler, directed the Association^ affairs 

throughout the difficult 1 thirties*. Mr. King closed 14 

years of service to the Association in February, 1937> 

having served as President through the boom of the late 

* twenties 1 and the depression of the early 1 thirties*, 

In the initial years of the financial recovery, trustees 

were hard pressed to keep their schools in operation. 

Pressure was put upon the Government to have the statutory 

minimum salary of teachers removed when the Convention 

passed a resolution to this effect in 1932. Subsequent 

conventions asked for a lowering of the minimum salary, 

but the Hon. Mr. Baker set the policy of the Government 

14 

when he stated in the 1933 convention, 

There were just three possible lines of action; 
to remove the minimum; to reduce the minimum; 
or to leave the law as it was, and attempt to 
meet the situation through the exercise of the 
power by which the Minister may authorize 
payment at a lower rate if the inspector certi¬ 
fies that it would be a hardship on any district 
to pay the minimum. The later course was the 
one decided upon ...

This policy was carried out until Improved 
financial conditions rendered the problem of no immediate 
concern to trustees* 


The Association began to publish its own period¬ 
ical in 1933* The first issue, 16 pages in length, appeared 
in March, 1933> with Mrs. Rogers as editor* By 1950 the 
publication was nearly quadrupled in size. In the second 
issue, Mr. King expressed the need for a separate magazine^ 

For the past two years the Trustees 1 Association 
has been publishing their magazine co-jointly 
with the ATA. This amalgamation has not proved 
successful financially, because we failed to get 
the necessary number of subscribers and as a 
result a large deficit has fallen each year on 
the central organization. 


The attitude to teachers was becoming more liberal, 
as shown by the following quotation from the discussion of 
a resolution before the 1933 convention in which the 
question of paying teachers for days spent at their con¬ 
ventions was being debated, 

Some trustees were of the opinion that (Teachers 1 
Conventions) ... were in the interest of the 
Teachers 1 Alliance only, and that the teachers

met to plot against the school boatrds... A 
large number of trustees, however, declared 
that they had attended these conventions 
themselves, and were delighted with the sort 
of work that was carried on there..." 

The ever-present and contentious problem of 
continuous contracts for teachers was up for discussion 
in this period. In the 1935 Convention a resolution was 
passed demanding an amendment to Section 160 of the School 
Act whereby a teacher could be dismissed in the months of 
July or August without the possibility of the Board of 
Reference being called into the matter. Despite this and 
other similar efforts, the trustees as a group had to 
yield continually on this point. 

The depression and subsequent unemployment ended 
the shortage of teachers which had existed in the late 
twenties 1 . The problem was to recur again by 1938. 

During the 1935 Convention a plea was made for an increase 
in membership. In 1938, a near^record crowd did attend 
the annual convention to hear the Minister of Education, 
the Hon. William Aberhart, outline his proposals for 
introducing the system of School Divisions. After the 

Minister had presented his plan a discussion followed,

Q. If the convention goes on record that they 
desire to stay in the same system as today 
will the Government go ahead with the pro¬ 
posed plan they have in view now? 

A. We might. We do not feel you fellows should 
have all the say. 

Q. As we have got along for so many years, would 
it not be possible to do so for another year 
and not rush the proposed legislation through 
at this session of the Legislature? 

A. I do not feel we are rushing anything. You 
have been talking about this thing for seven 
or eight years now. 

Q. Oh, so it is the Baker Bill? 

Q U What will be done with regard to opening 

schools heavily in debt and forced to close 
down by order of the Minister of Education? 

A. We are trying to make arrangements so that 
all schools can be opened, but as you see 
there Is a rather severe opposition to any 
attempt to help you. This is not the Baker 
Bill. It is a new bill to meet what you 
asked for, that you should have control of 
your own district. 


The vote on a resolution favoring the introduct¬ 
ion of the Divisional System showed that there were six 
trustees in the whole convention in favor of the plan. 

During the following session of the Legislature, 
the amendments to the School Act were passed, obviously 
without the blessing of the ASTA. 

Although the •thirties 1 witnessed the period of 
the highest and most general interest on school adminis¬ 
tration due to the proposed changes in the Divisional 
System, the ASTA faced a grave crisis In membership for 
the same reason. Three thousand school districts became

some 44 Divisions (which process was largely completed by 
1938) and the resulting reduced numbers of active trustees 
seriously limited the financial and personal support of 
the Association. Particularly hard hit was the Association's 
publication, The Alberta School Trustee, The circulation 
was reduced not only because there were fewer available 
trustees to subscribe, but also because many of this 
reduced number did not subscribe to the magazine. It is 
presumed that the failure of the Association to stop the 
Legislation to incorporate the Divisional System resulted 
in loss of interest in the organization. The problems 
arising from this loss of membership were partially solved 
during the presidency of Dr. C.A. Staples. In 1939 & 
government ordinance, requested and originated by the 
Legislative Committee of the ASTA, was passed. This made 
every trustee a member of the ASTA, With compulsory 
membership and payment of trustees 1 fees from public money 
the crisis was safely passed. 

The rather vexing problem of how to decrease the 
inroads on convention time made by delegates presenting 
purely local problems, was solved. The trustees 1 executive 
arranged to have various experts of the Department of 
Education present at each convention. These people were 
able to give the delegates informed advice and the time 
saved for matters of general concern was considerable.

Serving as vice-presidents in the 1 thirties 1 
were Dr. Lovering, Dr. C.A, Staples, Mr. M.R. Holder of 
Stettler, and Mr. A.E. Ottewell of Edmonton. Honorary 
presidents in this period were the Hon. Perren Baker, The 
Hon. Win. Aberhart, and Mr. T.O. King* 


By the decade of the * forties* one major 

financial accomplishment had been made. The School Board 

Fire Insurance, a co-operative effort on the part of 

trustees throughout the prairie provinces, had been active 

for about eleven years. This Board obtained group fire 

insurance rates which resulted in a considerable saving 

of money. A quotation from the School Fire Insurance 

Committee 1 s Report contained in the Alberta School Trustee, 

18 

January 19 43, page 24, follows: 

It is now twelve years since a Committee 
representing the school trustees of the 
three provinces worked out with these 
Companies, a plan of school fire insurance 
that would give adequate protection to 
schools against fire loss at a minimum 
cost. The Plan has now been in operation 
since May 1st, 1930. About five thousand 
school boards carry their fire insurance 
under it having a total volume of nearly 
$12,000,000. The committee carry on a 
continuous campaign of fire prevention. 

The Companies provide fire extinguishers 
to the schools free of charge. Every school 
board is urged to make a personal inspection 
of its school property every year and to send 
a detailed report to the Committee Secretary ...

The Committee discovered that adequate ... 
records of school fire losses have not been 
kept by any of the three Provincial Govern** 
ments. The Committee next reviewed insurance 
rates on schools ... the new rates place the 
cost of insuring a rural frame school or a 
village frame school of less than three class*- 
rooms at .70^ per $100. of insurance for three 
years. For town schools with more than two 
classrooms the rates range from .60# to $1.10 
per $100. ... according to the type of building .. 

The above rates are nearly 30% lower than 
previously in effect ... it is interesting to 
note that when the committee went into operation 
in 1930 the prevailing rate of fire insurance 
on rural schools ... was $1.50 ... or over 
twice as much as today. 


During the first half of the 1940*s the over« 

shadowing conflict, World War II, was being waged and ASTA 

activities and problems were colored by that fact. As 

early as the fall If 1938 there was a serious teacher 
19 

shortage and with the advent of the war the shortage 
became distressingly acute. 

In 1942 trustees advocated reduced fees as well 
as loans from the Provincial Government to teacher trainees. 
Bursaries were requested from the Government in 1945. In 


a resolution discussed at the 194? convention the shortage 
of teachers was cited as evidence that the profession was 
underpaid. This resolution contained the proposal that the

minimum salary be raised to $1400. Mr. Hennig in his presl« 

20 

dential address to the 1949 Convention stated, 

The teacher supply is better. The outlook for 
next year is promising due mostly to the scheme 
of bursaries initiated by the Department of 
Education and participated in by most ... 
Divisions. This will assure more teachers for 
next year than would otherwise be the case. 


In 1950 the teacher shortage was still a trustee 


problem. 


The progress of centralization was accelerated 
in the 1 forties 1 by the teacher shortage; other problems 
arose in the process. In 1942 the question of replacement 
and maintenance of school vans was serious enough to elicit 
a resolution directed toward the Provincial Government 
requesting special help and consideration. The problem of 
suitable roads for vans grew with the extension of central¬ 
ized districts to such an extent that In 1950 it was listed 
by trustees as the most significant factor hindering 
centralization. The building of dormitories Incidental 
to the centralization program presented the problem of 
adequate supervision and selection of suitable material. 

This matter was studied at some length by the Association 
which set up a special dormitory committee for this purpose.

The building program entailed in centralization accentuated 
the difficulties of trustees in obtaining building materials 
during the war-born shortage* 

Interest in the subject of a provincial salary 

schedule for teachers persisted throughout this decade* 

A. joint ASTA - ATA committee was formed to study this 

problem. Trustees still felt through this period that 

they should have the same rights in terminating contracts 

as those held by the teachers* In 1945 the Convention 

21 

passed the following resolution, 

That the legislature be requested to forthwith 
amend the School Act by abolishing the con- 
tinuous contract, and extending to school boards 
the same annual right to terminate as is accorded 
to the teacher and that the Board of Reference be 
abolished. 

This is typical of severs,! resolutions through¬ 
out the period of the 1 forties 1 * 

The pressure for an increase in Provincial grants 
to education was a result of the rising costs of education. 
The Judge Report, stating that municipal taxes were near 
a maximum, added impetus to a movement to secure increased 
grants* Speaking to the convention of 1946, the ASTA

president, Mr. H.E. Spencer, made the following statement, 


22 


... in January ... a Joint committee of the ASTA 
and the ATA invited representatives from fifteen 
Provincial-wide organizations to attend a confer¬ 
ence in support of larger school grants ... ... 

A brief on the subject of our present educational 
situation had been prepared and was presented to 
the conference. This was unanimously accepted 
in principle. The next day a delegation of 
twenty-three waited on the Cabinet and requested 
that fifty percent of the costs of primary and 
secondary education be met from general Provincial 
funds. 


From this united effort grew the Alberta Educat¬ 
ional Council, consisting in 194? of thirty-one interested 
organizations. Mr. Spencer reported to the convention in 
1947 , “that ... the largest increased grant on record was 
paid this year by the province can be traced to the demand 
of the public that more recognition be given to education 
by the Government ... H 

Presidents in the 1940* & were Mr. A.E. Ottewell 
of Edmonton, Mr. H. E. Spencer of Edgerton and Mr. R. Hennig 
of Fort Saskatchewan. Vice-presidents were Mr. R. Hennig, 
Mr. H.E. Spencer, Mr. L.C. Halmrast of Foremost and Mr. J.M. 
Griffiths of Foremost. Honorary presidents were The Hon. 

Mr. Aberhart, Dr. Staples, the Hon. Solon E, Low, the Hon. 
R.E. Ansley, the Hon. Ivan Casey and Mr. H.E. Spencer.

In December 1942, Mr. A. G-. Andrews succeeded 
Mrs. A.H. Rogers as Secretary-Treasurer of the Association 
and editor of the trustees 1 magazine. Mr. Andrews, a 
former M.L.A. and long time trustee, has ably carried 
on this work. 


The Association suffered the loss of two past 
presidents in the deaths of Mr. King and Mr. Ottewell in 
this period. The In Memo r iam of the 1946 Convention 

2 ? 

Handbook mentioned the contribution of these two men. " 

... Mr. King was one of the pioneer presidents 
of the organisation being very active during the 
earlier years, and in large measure responsible 
for the success the Association received from 
1909 to 1937 *.. His chief interest was always 
the education of the rural child, and ... 
putting technical training within reach of 
all children so inclined. 

... Mr. Ottewell was in large measure responsible 
for the revival and success of the Canadian 
School Trustees 1 Association. 


The accomplishments of the ASTA were summarized 

by long standing members of the executive as follows; 

1. The organization, with its annual convention, 
served as a sounding board for delegates with 
grievances. 

2. The School Act became better known to the trustees 
through attending conventions.

3. Trouble experienced by trustees in interpreting 
the School Act resulted in the Governments 
simplifying and clarifying the Act* 

4. The Association acted as a slight brake on 
hasty Government legislation. 

5. The Association was able to secure cheap 
insurance for school property. Incidentally, 
the need for accident insurance was stressed* 

6* The Association 1 s conventions served to 

educate trustees in proper and efficient 
methods of carrying out public business, 
and made them aware of their administrative 
rights and privileges as trustees. 

7* The conventions helped to make New Canadian 

trustees familiar with Alberta, educational 
practices and procedures* 

8. The Association was careful to maintain unity 

among Provincial Trustees. City, town, rural, 
majority and minority trustee groups were all 
held within the framework of the ASTA with but 
one voice among them* 

Since its inception the Alberta School Trustees 1 

Association grew from a few members to its present status

which includes all trustees; its budget grew from $2,287. 
in 1922 to nearly $28,000. in 1949; the scope of trustee 
interest widened from a concern with curriculum to problems 
of Provincial and even National and International concern.

Council was evidence that the Trustees* Association had 
grown with education in Alberta, and possessed the required 
virility to meet the challenge of a new and unusual educat¬ 
ional need.

A SUMMARY UP STATISTICAL DATA 

IiVl'KObUCTUKI 1MU1 'h 

In order that the information contained in the 
returned questionnaires could be summarized, some 
elementary statistical procedures were applied. This 
chapter presents a summary of the data thus obtained, 
with no attempt at explanation. From this unorganized 
material the succeeding chapters were written. Dis-^ 
cussion and interpretation of the raw material presented 
here is found in the succeeding chapters. 

Some broad definitibns of the statistical terms 
used was thought necessary. The mean referred to is 
the arithmetical mean, or average. As might be ex« 
pected, tne average was used to reveal what was hoped to 
be a central position in the extremes of the trustee 
opinion represented, 

N is the size of the sample, or, more specifically, 
the number of trustees replying to any given item. 

Sigma represents standard deviation, which gives 
a measure of central tendency. Mean, or average, gave 
the mld~point of opinion on any given item, sigma gave the 
M scatter* 4 of opinion aoout the mean. A relatively small

sigma indicated a homogeneity of opinion on the part of 
trustees, while a large sigma indicated the opposite case® 

The range is the limits of the variable, thus, 
in the summary of question 3> the range is said to be 
from 30 years to 77 years. This means that the youngest 
trustee completing a questionnaire was 30 years of age, 
while the oldest was 77 years of age. 

The limits put upon the mean and sigma are the 

limits of probability at the level, as are all other 
limits unless otherwise specified. Taking the summary 
of item 22 as an example of this procedure, we find that 
15*4& of trustees answered M yes M to the question. To 
find how reliable this figure was, statistical procedures 
were applied. These revealed that at the 5% level of 
probability 8.^ to 22,^ was as close as the figure 
could be assumed*

CHAPTER V 


TRUSTE ES AND SOME COMMO N A DMINISTRATIVE PROBLEM S 

It was deemed within the scope of this study to 
attempt to get data on trustees as administrators in the 
fields of: The School Act, the Grants System, teachers* 
housing problems, school plants and the expenditures of 
public money for teachers* services* Items 19» 22, 23, 

24, 25, 27 and 28 on the questionnaire were designed for 
this purpose. 

Item 19 asked trustees to rate the relative 
difficulty of three teaching positions, namely, teaching 
in a rural school, teaching in a single room with two or 
three grades, and teaching in a single room with a single 
grade. Forty~five out of fifty^three trustees ranked them 
In the order they were given, which is in agreement with 
teachers* opinions (the rural school job being the most 
difficult). This would indicate that trustees were 
familiar with school room problems. Some trustees 
indicated further their appreciation of the relative 
difficulties involved in the comments they made. For 
example, 

W I feel that first year teachers should have 
the junior rooms in a graded school with a 
principal and others to he!p. H

,5 The most difficult Job usually comes to the 
less able (inexperienced) teacher, 15 

Item 22 asked trustees whether, considering 
teacher incentives to improve their qualifications, an 
older teacher should get more for an additional year of 
training than a younger teacher. The point of the question 
was ~ could the trustees put themselves in the teachers 1 
place, and if so, would they recognize that the older teacher 
had a shorter time to realize a fair return on his invest-* 
ment than had a younger teacher? 

The answer was an overwhelming NO , Eighty 
percent said no, 15 $ said yes, and did not answer* 

There were 20 trustees who commented on this item; none 
of these indicated that he had viewed the matter from 
an actuarial basis; a number were somewhat severe 
with the hypothetical teacher for not having taken the 
training earlier. For example, one trustee said, M No, he 
has not so many years of usefulness to his employers 
ahead of him, 15 On the other hand, some trustees took a 
favorable attitude toward the proposition. One ,s Yes 8t 
response said, ,J When a teacher forty-five years of age re¬ 
turns to University it definitely shows that he is very much 
interested In improving his teaching methods • •, 59 

The point was also suggested that the older 
teacher would be more sincere, and with his background

of experience, he would learn more from an additional 
year of training than would an inexperienced teacher. 

These comments are typical of the “yes“ responses, which 
were largely based on a generous attitude to the problems 
of an older teacher. The “no“ comments were partly 
Indifferent, with the attitude “what has age to do with 
it?“; and partly biased against older teachers. In one 
of the more extremely biased comments, older teachers 
were referred to as “just a bunch of old goats“. The 
number of violently biased comments was small. 

Item 23 asked trustees if a flag and a flag 
pole were necessary for each school. The School Act 
(126 n) lists provision of flag and flag pole to be a 
duty of Boards. The question was designed to assess 
trustee familiarity with the School Act, and to get an 
expression of opinion on patriotic exercises in generals 

Sixty^five percent of the trustees said “yes“, 

29 % said “no“. Six percent failed to score this question. 
Forty-two out of the sixty-*!'ive questionnaires carried 
comments on this item. In these comments there was no 
indication that anyone was conscious of this regulation 
in the School Act. The 29% of “no“ answers is not to be 
interpreted as indicating that this number of trustees

were antl~patriotic. This group, where comment reveals 
their reasons, said "no" for one of 3 reasons; (a) that 
installation and maintenance were too bothersome, (b) that 
the display of the flag did not teach the real essentials 
of patriotism, and (c) that though a flag was desirable, 
it was not a necessity. 

Item 24 asked trustees for their estimate of a 
fair increment for a. teacher for a year*s training. This 
was designed to see if trustees had evolved a reasonable 
basis for estimating the expenditure of public money on 
teachers 1 salaries# 

The mean of the figures quoted was $244.33* The 
figures ranged from $100. to $ 500 . The sigma was $92.00. 

If the hypothetical teacher was getting say, $1800 and 
had five years to go to the maximum salary, his investment 
would be one year 1 s salary lost, totalling $1800. Present 
worth of five Increments at, say $100., totalling $460 at 
tuition and other expenses peculiar to university 
training totalling $200 , making a grand total of $2460 
in all. It would take him fifteen years to realize 5 % on 
his investment at an increment of $245 ^ the mean increment 
suggested by trustees. It has been assumed that teachers 
should receive a rate of returns which is common in invest** 
ments in real estate. The teacher 1 s investment Is not 
liquid, a further disadvantage over investment in real

estate* On the other hand, the additional year of training 
places the teacher in a better bargaining position for 
procuring a teaching position, increases the likelihood of 
getting a better-paying administrative post, and involves 
a good deal of personal satisfaction to the teacher* Never- 
theless, at the mean figure quoted by trustees, the invest- 
ment, on an actuarial basis, seemed a poor one for a 
teacher* The higher the salary that the teacher foregoes, 
the poorer the investment becomes* The general conclusion 
from this item in the questionnaire seemed to be that 
trustees had not viewed the matter of teachers* increments 
from a strict investment viewpoint* 

Item 2,5 asked trustees if they thought that 
provision of teacher housing was a moral obligation on 
the Board. Fifty-four percent said 8J yes 1 ’, 11$ gave a 
qualified M yes M , said ,f no“, and 1$ of the questionnaires 

were unscored. The majority thought that teacher housing 
was a Board responsibility. Of the affirmatives, some 
thought it to be not a moral but a practical obligation - 
something that must be done to get teachers for the staff. 

Of those who expressed a qualified opinion, some thought 
that housing should be supplied for rural teachers only, 
while others thought that the Board should be concerned 
only over low-paid teachers. The negative comments were

of the general opinion that M teachers should stand on their 
own feet* 1 , or, “why should Boards worry about housing when 
no other employer does?** • The item was designed to survey 
trustee opinion on this vexing problem, and. perhaps to 
reveal trustee attitude toward their employees 1 problems,, 

It seemed fairly successful in attaining both these ob¬ 
jectives. Forty-eight trustees commented on this question, 
the highest number of comments on any item in the question¬ 
naire * 

In I tem 27 trustees were asked to indicate what 
share of the costs of Home Economics and Industrial Arts 
they considered should be borne by the Government. The 
question was framed with the object of getting a province-* 
wide opinion on this matter and of revealing the extent of 
the trustees* knowledge of the financial assistance the 
Provincial Government was actually giving. The range was 
from 0 to 100$. Fewer than 10$ of the trustees quoted a 
figure significantly below that figure actually in effect. 
The mean of the percentages quoted was 60$. One trustee 
indicated, through his comments, that he was familiar with 
what is actually being done. Typical of the average or 
higher^than-average group were these comments l 

...there remains the cost of building and it 

would seem to me that the province should carry 

25 or 30 $ of this capital outlay.

Divisions which are trying to centralize are hard- 
pressed financially on building and transportation 
funds. Therefore, have little funds left for . 
(Household Economics or Industrial Arts). 

Generally speaking, trustees Indicated that they 
felt that the Provincial Government should contribute more 
to Industrial Arts, and Home Economics training. 

Item 28 . Trustees were requested to pass an 

opinion on a one-room school. A floor plan and other data 
were given and trustees were asked if the plan was adequate 
in floor space, window space, safety, heating and air space. 
Inadvertently, the ceiling height was omitted and trustees 
were quick to point this out. The omission of this inform¬ 
ation invalidated that ■part of the question. The purpose 
of the question was to determine whether trustees were 
conversant with school building standards. In the matter 
of floor space, said ”yes% 39% said H no* 5 and 2.J% 

expressed tt no opinion 1 ’. According to accepted building 
standards the floor space is adequate. The high percentage 
of “no opinion 1 * is worthy of note. Forty-three percent 
rated the building as having adequate window space, 35% 
said it was inadequate and. 22% had no opinion on the matter. 
Building standards indicate that the window space is 
adequate.

In the matter of safety, the school was satis-* 
factory to 15$ of the trustees, and J2% had no opinion. 

The plan was of a school-room actually in operation as 
part of a centralized plant in Aioerta, Shortly after the 
questionnaire was sent out, this room was visited by a 
Provincial Government Fire Inspector who indicated that 
no changes were needed. The principal of this centralized 
school had considered the room to be unsafe and had requested 
the inspection. Fifty-four percent of the trustees agreed 
with the principal. 

In the matter of heating, 2J% said it was satisfact¬ 
ory, 51$ said it was not so, and 2b% had no opinion. 

The principal of this school reported that, with the heater 
In the basement keeping the floor warst, the building was 
comfortable at all times. It should be noted that no 
specifications as to the condition of the building, 
amount of insulation carried out, and other heat control 
procedures,were given a.nd that this lack of information 
did not call forth any trustee comment. 

Some general conclusions may oe drawn from the 
analysis of the six questions grouped under the heading 
of “Trustees and Some Administrative Problems, 11 Trustees 
did not appear to be actuarially minded in the matter of 
teachers* increments, at least, as far as this study is

concerned. Trustees did not appear to be School-Act 
conscious, Judging by the item regarding the necessity 
of a flag and flag pole for each school. An interesting 
sidelight of this question was the evident concern of 
trustees (as shown by the great number of comments) in 
this matter of patriotism and loyalty to one*s country. 

The majority of trustees thought that the School Board 
should provide housing for teachers, but it should be 
noted that the large part of the minority who were of the 
opposite opinion showed strong anti*~teacher bias in 
supporting their opinion. In the matter of Government 
grants in aid of technical electives, the majority of 
trustees were of the opinion that the amount of money the 
Government is contributing at present Is its fair share 
of the cost, although only one trustee Indicated that he 
knew the percentage the Government was contributing. 

The salient fact emerging from the question concerning 
building standards for schools seemed to be that a rather 
high percentage of trustees were not acquainted with some 
of the more elementary and commonly used, standards. 

One practical consideration should be kept in 
mind in dealing with trustees in relation to administrative 
problems. The time that trustees give to board meetings 
is contributed time « time ai^ray from their vocation. It is 
not to be expected that trustees will be particularly

concerned with the minute points of the School Act, the 
School 0rant9 Act, and the minutiae of administration in 
general. This is left to the professionally trained 
Superintendent and to the Board's secretary. This study 
attempts to report facts, it does not set standards for 
trustees. 


SOME ELEMENTS OF TRUSTEE PHILOSOPHY 

IN THE ADMINISTRATION FIELD 

Trustees a nd Pa triotism 

Trustees 1 philosophy on patriotism was an 
unexpected windfall. Item 23, which concerned the flag 
and flag pole, was so thoroughly commented upon that the 
trustee attitude toward patriotism was clearly evident. 

As an indicator of trustee opinion, the bare statistics 
are misleading. There was no case of comment adverse to 
patriotic exercise and patriotic teaching. In those 
questionnaires where a negative answer was accompanied by 
a comment, the comment invariably was to the effect that 
although patriotic exercises ifere desirable, they were not 
a necessity. There was no evidence that any trustee 
answering thought we should not display our flag on some 
occasions. 


To Alberta trustees, Canada is a. land of many 
and diverse peoples. These peoples must be knit together 
so that Canadian citizens may be real citizens of a growing

country with a worth-while heritage: “This is a land of 

many nationalities and we should convey to newcomers that 

we are proud of our country even though we do not say 
1 

much'*« Our flag is a symbol of the equality that exists 
in Canada for every Canadian irrespective of race or 
creed; “With so many racial stocks in our population it 
is necessary to hs.ve a symbol which stands for equality 
of all people under it“» They felt that this flag and 
what it symbolizes should become a binding force to tie 
our peoples into a natlon a This is shown by the comments, 
“Foreign elements should be taught to respect the flag”, 
and 

“In a country such as ours, with many people 
from foreign lands and many viewpoints, little 
or no knowledge of Canadian laws and customs, 
it is necessary to have something that will 
bind them together and help them to become 
real citizens. 18 

Trustees seemed to be of the opinion that 
Canada should be a nation and that its people should 
become citizens in every sense of the word. Trustees 
would direct the youth toward a growing pride in their 
country and an expanded sense of their responsibility 
as Canadian citizens.

It 18 to be observed also that the horizons of 


some extended beyond the limits of nationalism* The 

following are the pertinent comments, 

“In my opinion it is as important to see 
that patriotism or national consciousness 
is not overdone as it is to teach it in 
the first place . . • 11 

“Please remember that intense nationalism 
is akin to feudalism and the mother of some 
six thousand years of intermittent warfare. 11 

Also, 2 


"Just as the citizen in the local community 
must forego the ancient right of private 
vengeance ... so the nations of the world 
must yield some of their prerogatives so 
that their best interests may be protected." 


Trustees appeared to think that the building 
of a Canadian nation and the fostering of a Canadian 
citizenship was a nearer goal, and one more Important, 
than the goal of world citizenship. This was shown by 
their rating, in Item 29, of the ideal of world citizen^ 
ship as unimportant among the aims of secondary education 
in Alberta. The prevalent opinion seemed to be that if 
Canada was to become an Individual nation of consequence 
in the congress of nations, she must first become an 
individual nation of consequence. It seems within the 
realm of possibility that these two ideas (the building

of a Canadian citizenship, and the development of world 
citizens) do represent two distinct stages in trustee 
thinking in this area. 

Inherent in trustee philosophy is the belief 
that efficiency in education is a function of the plant 
at which children are to be trained. There was much 
concern over the buildings and the organization of the 
educational program. Dormitories were built and studied 
and modified. Trustees appeared to be aware of the 
principles of heating and interior decoration. Lighting 
and types of exposure were considered and evaluated. 
Through all this, education is Improved « such seems to 
be trustee opinion. 

To some trustees, teachers seemed to be a 
commodity. To others they were people. Just as the 
most expensive furnace was not necessarily the best for 
a given job, so the teacher with prolonged training 
(which makes him, under present salary schedules, also 
the more expensive) was not necessarily the better 
teacher for a given position. Stoves could give too 
much heat and teachers could have too much training.^

Teacher training is dealt with in another chapter.

The feeling that “teachers are a commodity, *' 
seemed to be in evidence in the fact that some trustees 
felt that teacher housing should be supplied not as a 
moral obligation on Boards, but for the very practical 
reason that housing attracts teachers. Further evidence 
to this point could be in trustees 1 belief that there 
was a limit to the amount of training desirable for 
teaching. Part of the prDecentralization attitude arose 
from this notion that there was a direct relationship 
between material quality of plant, and excellence of 
education. Some trustee literature contained, comment 
to the effect that when small rural schools could be 
grouped into larger units, education would be better 
served. There was indication that this bettering of 
education might be a result of the concomitants of 
centralization, such as the possibility of hiring more 
expert teachers for a larger centre, as distinct from the 
other facts of centralization. But, there was evidence 
that trustees held a belief that the better plant was in 
itself a gain. Speaking of the Red Deer Composite School, 
one trustee said, H I consider this s et -up a big step 
forward in education (italics added), “It seems 

to me, H another trustee commented, “that the cost of 
centralization is higher than some smaller schools could

operate with, but on the other hand the same advantages 
cannot be supplied, B (italics added). 

Trustees were aware that they are spending 
public money. The ASTA literature studied was replete 
with statements to this effect. This awareness may be 
due to two things : 1. Trustees were under immediate 

local pressure from taxpayers to keep the mill rate 
down, 2, Trustees had an attitude of civic respons¬ 
ibility. Whether one or both of these causes was the 
effective one was not immediately apparent. Perhaps 
this was unimportant. At any rate, the facts are 
consistent with either one or the other of these 
postulated causes. Trustee concern with larger grants 
from the provincial G-overnment, and their oft-repeated 
plea that the property tax had reached a limit, are 
explicable on either basis. 

The principle of equality of opportunity in 
education seemed basic to their administrative philos¬ 
ophy, This principle is idealistic, but was explicit 
in both the questionnaire data and ASTA records. That 
this ideal has been changed in practice to 1 the best 
over-all educational service that can be provided for 
the money 1 , was evidence that the ideal was being worked

at, rather than that it was being allowed to stagnate. 
The conflict between the ideal and actual practice wax 
expressed by one trustee when he commented, “Under the 
present road conditions, we cannot pick up ...(in vans) 
... all children at their door, and some people seem 
tc think that we should pick them all up at their door 
or none.* 


Between the ideal and practice lies a conflict; 
a conflict between the notion that the components of 
education are all as purchasable as are the particulars 
of a wardrobe, and the repudiation of this notion. 

This conflict explains the contradictory attitudes ex*- 
hlbited by trustees in administration. The tendency to 
treat teachers as a commodity, the “practical* component 
of the attitude toward, centralization, and the concern 
over increased revenue, could all be evidence that a con~ 
cern with “dollars and cents* was accepted as of major 
importance by some of the trustees. The dual attitude 
toward the teacher, the reluctance of parents to surrender 
their children to the system, 4 attest the fact that a 
philosophy of education dominated by financial considerations 
was neither unanimously nor overwhelmingly accepted.

“Parents also protest when high school students are 
removed from their farm responsibilities. Many feel 
that ... the practical training given at home ... 
together with the family group is more important

CHAPTER VI 


TRUSTEE-TEACHER RELATIONS HIP S 

Another phase of this study concerned the 
relationships existing between trustees and teachers. 

In an attempt to bring out the pertinent facts the 
following items were employed: Items 21 (H, K and N) 

22, 24 and 25 of the trustees* Questionnaire; and Item 
2 of the superintendents 1 questionnaire. 

Items 21 (H, K and N) listed three supposed 
factors in the teacher shortage. Trustees choosing these 
three factors as relevent to the teacher shortage could 
fairly be considered to be expressing some anti*-*teacher 
bias. These items were: 

(h) Teachers over-rate quality of work done 
in relation to salary. 

(k) Teachers dissatisfied with salary despite 
short working hours. 

(n) Teachers expect too much money for the 
length of the training period they 
undergo. 

Significant bias was shown. Sub-section (h) 
was scored by 42$ of the trustees as a factor in the 
teacher shortage, while sub-section (k) was scored by

23% of trustees. Item (n) was scored by 37% of trustees. 
There was a tendency noted for trustees, if they scored 
one of these items, to score more than one, indicating 
that these items might all measure the same thing. 

Twenty-Height of the questionnaires scored none of these 
sub-sections, 16 had one scored, and 21 had more than one 
of these subjections scored. 

It was assumed that if a. trustee scored one or 
more of these items, he was expressing bias. On the other 
hand, it was possible that trustees might have read the 
separate subjections out of context with the general theme 
of Item 21, 

One trustee scored only these three sub-sections 
out of the fifteen in the item, and no others. Six scored 
all three of these sub-sections, as well as others. This 
might have been evidence that some few trustees were ex¬ 
tremely biased against teachers. On the other hand, many 
trustees showed a very sympathetic attitude toward teachers 
and their problems through comments on this and other items. 
Comments typical of these two extremes were l 

“Teachers run down conditions to keep the 
(teacher) shortage for their own ends.* 1

"The ATA endeavoring to maintain a. teacher 
shortage. The poor teacher most dissatis¬ 
fied with salaries." 

"Some ... (teachers) are real good." (comment 
on Item 14.)" 

"A teacher ... is very much a human being of 
considerable value, and should be appreciated 
as such. G-ive him or her the best your 
pocket-book can afford in salary, housing, 
social life, and the teacher shortage In time 
will disappear." (comment on Item 25.) 


Item 22, which called for opinion on whether or 
not an older teacher should get a higher Increment for an 
added year of training was dealt with in a previous 
chapter. Trustees generally did not place themselves in 
the teachers 1 position in the matter of increments for 
older teachers. 


The following comments showed trustee extremes 
in attitude toward teachers: 

"He has not so ma.ny years of usefulness to his 
employers ahead of him," 

"You can*t show an old person (a) new trick." 

"Surely the teacher who has taught twenty-five 
years would be able to derive more benefit 
from an added year of training," 

"It definitely shows that he is very much 
interested in improving his teaching methods." 


Eighty percent of the trustees were not in favor 
of giving the older teacher a higher increment, 15 $ were in

favor and 5% did not answer the question 


Item 24 attempted to find whether trustees 
were business-like in their attitude toward teachers by 
asking the former to give their opinion of a fair in¬ 
crement for one year of training. This item was dealt 
with in the last chapter, and the general attitude as 
revealed there was that trustees had not put this aspect 
of teacher relations on a strict business basis. Some 
comments are revealing: 

■’Too much money for very doubtful help...*’ 

,j . . . should do better Jobs to advantage of 
future pupils. M 

This item proved to be more useful in evalu¬ 
ation of trustee attitude to teacher training, than 
attitude to teachers themselves. 

Item 25 which called for trustee opinion on 
their responsibility in providing teacher housing, 
elicited copious comments, Thirty-four percent thought 
that housing for teachers was not a Board obligation. 

The noteworthy point about this group 1 s comments was 
the attitude toward teachers which they took. For 
example: 

”... why should School Boards be required 
to build homes for transient labor?”

exemplifies rather extreme anti-teacher bias, while, 

“... many of our teacherages are now empty... 
When teachers 1 salaries were low, teacher- 
ages were always used.” 

exemplifies a group of the “no^" with moderate opinions 
about the matter. 

Item 2 on the Teachers 1 Questionnaire asked 
teachers if they were consulted in their Division on 
matters of teacher housing. Ten per cent said that they 
were, 59% reported that they sometimes were consulted, 
and 5% said they were never consulted. This study does 
not necessarily propose that teachers should be consulted 
in matters of teacherage rental, disposal, repair, and 
design, it merely reports as to whether or not this is 
being done. The above figures, in relation to the quest¬ 
ion of trustee-teacher relations, might suggest that 
trustees are not vitally concerned with consulting with 
teachers in the matter of teacher housing. Whether or 
not this is a function of trustee bias against teachers 1 
judgment in these matters is not revealed by the figures. 
Certainly this is a vital field of interest to both 
parties, and one might expect a greater degree of co¬ 
operation in its solution than appears to exist. 

Item 3 of the Teachers 1 Questionnaire asked if 
teachers were consulted by their Board in the matter of

placement of teachers in the various schools of the 
Division. Two percent reported that this was done 
regularly, 71$ said "never", 14$ were unanswered. 

Once again, here appeared to be a problem of import** 
ance to both trustee and teacher which was not being- 
solved by mutual agreement. This may be due to the 
fact that it was only recently the Boards were given 
the power to shift their teaching personnel about from 
one position to the other. Perhaps the idea of a mutual 
trustee-teacher decision in these matters will emerge 
as time goes by. 

Item 1 of the Superintendents questionnaire 
asked what percentage of administrative positions were 
generally filled from the existing Divisional staff, 
rather than from "outsiders, M The mean figure arrived 
at was 42.9$ • This figure is presented for what it is 
worth in this discussion of trustee«teacher relationships* 

The general conclusion that seems to emerge 
from a study of this matter of trustee bias regarding 
teachers, seemed to be that trustees exhibited extremes 
of opinion regarding teachers, that is, they seemed, to 
be either strongly "for" or strongly "against" teachers. 

If a distribution of trustees were to be taken on the 
variable of teacher bias, the distribution would probably

be bl~raodal with relatively few trustees occupying the 
middle, neutral ground. Neutrality of bias here might 
represent an attitude of indifference to personal con¬ 
siderations regarding teachers, and a tendency to judge 
teachers on grounds of ability. 

The other general conclusion seemed to be 
that trustees and teachers are not consulting each other 
on two mutually important matters - that of teacher 
placement and that of teacher housing. The reason was 
not apparent. 


TRUSTEE-TEACHER RELATIONS HIPS 

This section was not concerned with a study 
of what standards were desirable for trustee-teacher 
relations but was concerned with attempting faithfully 
to organize the data which had been gathered. 

The data (Teachers* Questionnaire #2, #3>) 
indicated that tes.chers did not have representation on 
the body which made decisions on teacherages and on 
teacher placement. Whether this was a result of teacher 
disinterest or trustee policy was not revealed. Some 
few Boards customarily invited teachers to state their 
preference regarding placement and some had a systematic

procedure for collecting community opinion on the matter 
of placement. No doubt these data were used in making 
decisions. Very few boards had adopted the policy of 
having teachers represented on matters of direct concern 
to teachers. 

The data gathered from Items 22 and 24 revealed 
that trustees, as a whole, when considering teachers* 
problems, did. not put themselves in the place of the 
teachers. Whether or not this state was unfortunate is 
of no concern to this study. The fact is reported for 
what it is worth In a discussion of trustee~teacher re*-* 
lationships. The large majority answered the question 
from their role as trustee and were not guided by the 
restrictive phrase, M considering teachers 1 incentives 
to improve their qualifications.. . • 

As has been reported, replies to Item 25 re« 
vealed a diversity of opinion. Feeling ranged from 
acceptance of the responsibility because the best is 
not too good for teachers, through the neutral ground 
of acceptance as a practical necessity, to the negative 
attitude that teachers should have no special privileges 
as compared with other types of employees.

it was also observed that the * bias’® components 
of item 21 were relatively heavily scored. In addition 
there appeared to be a marked tendency for those who 
scored any one of these Items, lh, k, n,) to score more than 
one of them. A core of anti-teacher bias, which was 
extreme in some few cases, was inferred. About as many 
trustees were as strongly pro-teacher. The large increment 
suggested by some trustees, coupled with numerous 
comments throughout the questionnaire, showed that trustees 
were approximately evenly split on their pro and. con teacher 
bias. 


In attempting to discover the philosophical basis 
for this apparent division of attitude toward teachers (i.e. 
that teachers were people, as opposed, to the teacher-commodity 
concept,) the ASTA history was found helpful. 

During the depression of the l '30 t s, acute lack 
of money was the major problem and perhaps the only real 
problem. Materials could be had for the buying at very 
reasonable prices, and teachers were cheap. A good teacher 
cost $700* a year, or less. The recovery and the war 
conspired to solve the trusteed problem of money, and to 
present him with another and more vexatious problem - that 
of finding enough teachers to fill his schools. Teachers 1

salaries went up and trustee choice in selecting teachers 
decreased to zero. These people who had been happy at 
$700 now demanded twice that, and insisted &n rendering 
if not less, at least no more,service. The surplus of teachers 
decreased to zero and became a shortage. The palliative 
of Letters of Authority eased the situation for a 
while and then the expedient of hiring correspondence 
supervisors was resorted to. These supervisors who ran 
the schools were not teachers; they could be changed at 
will. Their salary was not M according to schedule, 58 and 
they were paid on the basis of ten months. The actual 
directing force, in the educational sense, the Correspondence 
School Branch of the Department of Education, was 
not always apparent. Some good work came from these 
correspondence centres and Superintendents and trustees, 
began to compare these 81 sitters’* with teachers (perhaps 
specific teacher,) In many cases the comparison may have been 
unfavorable to the teacher who was the higher paid em« 
ployee. The teachers* association insisted upon teachers 
being given preference over the correspondence super** 
visors. The trustee remembered the advantages of the 
supervisor system, and his memories may have colored his 
attitude to teachers. 

The above analysis of facts is probably far from 
being complete. The problem of finance was not entirely 
solved. Higher prices for materials as well as increased

teachers 1 salaries combined to render the increased 
revenue inadequate. The problem of hiring teachers 
was complicated by the necessity for making some of the 
contracts temporary as required by War Veteran 
reinstatement. Some of the correspondence supervisors were 
undoubtedly unfortunate choices and probably there are 
other factors which make the story more complex. The 
story, however, if accepted, does clarify trustee 
attitude to teachers. The plenty of the r 30 l s (of 
teachers) resulted in an Impersonal attitude towards 
teachers; the memory of $700,00 as a top salary did 
nothing to soften this attitude, and the experience of 
hiring, even during the worst shortage, people to take 
charge of schools who were cheaper, and sometimes 
'•better 1 *, than teachers made the matter worse. Present 
salaries were not set without some acrimony, and other 
teacher complaints would certainly have been aired during 
the shortage. It was not surprising, therefore, to find 
evidence of bias, A policy which would render extinct the 
“sitter 9 directed some animosity to the ATA ,as did 
the practice of caricaturing various M teacher 9 attributes 
and ridiculing certain conditions in educational adminis¬ 
tration through cartoons in the ATA magazine. History 
thus served to show the basis for the attitude, but did

show the reason for the deep concern of trustees with the 
personal attributes of the teachers they hirbd. Evidence 
of such concern may be found in Appendix II, page II, 

(L.5 ff); page V, (L.3), (L.13); page VI page IX 

(L.18); page XV, (L.29); and etc. 

Was the very natural concern for the child* s 
welfare responsible for the varied and strong feelings 
expressed toward teachers? There was evidence to support 
this concept. Trustees have strongly resisted any move*-* 
ment leading to teacher independence from local control. 
This was one of the issues in the trustee stand against 
the Divisional system. Trustees resisted the continuous 
contract and the security of tenure sections of the Act. 
Control over the teacher became a necessity if the child*s 
best educational interests were not to be threatened. 
Trustees were bitter in 1936 when this local control was 
removed. The records of ASTA Conventions revealed a 
continuous struggle against loss of local control over 
the teacher. In the returned questionnaires, trustees, 
almost without exception, indicated that they would, 
curcumstances permitting, be very generous toward the 
teacher they considered *good*. Perhaps, l good for my 
child* is what they meant. Perhaps the l good l teacher 
referred to was a happy combination of the desirable 


97 



attributes the parent (trustee) thinks of himself as 
possessing, and so the ‘good 1 teacher was resented for 
this very excellence. Whatever the cause, a strong, 
personalized feeling was latent in trustee comment 
regarding teachers. 

The l no good' teacher, on the other hand, 
was suggested as possessing some or all of the undeslid¬ 
able traits of humans and was undervalued accordingly. 

A bivalent attitude concerning the sharing of the 
parent-child relationship might possibly be one of the 
casual factors in the strong and somewhat illogical 
attitude toward teachers. It appeared reasonable to 
suppose that trustee attitude toward teachers was 
dictated by an anxious, end quite natural, concern over 
the school children and that this concern might be 
motivated by the dilemma of the necessity for sharing 
the relationship (parent-child) with teachers, and yet 
fearing to do so.

CHAPTER VTI 


TRUSTEES AND TEACHER-TRAININC 

Item 14 This question which asks trustees to 
express an opinion on the one year training program for 
teachers under the groupings, psychology, academic back** 
ground and administrative ability, was designed to assess 
trustee opinion on the suitability of the teacher-training 
program. The first four items which dealt with teacher¬ 
training in psychology revealed that trustees were only 
moderately satisfied with the program in this respect. 
Twelve of the 65 said that teachers 1 understanding of 
children was very good, 3^ described teachers 1 ability 
here as passable, and 3 voted it as poor. The ratings 
were very nearly the same for sub-section (b), (getting 
children to do work) while (c), (stimulating interest) 
is just a little better. Subjection (d), (putting across 
what they taught) was rated somewhat less satisfactorily. 
The total rating on this problem which would make a scale 
from plus 4 to minus 4, as described in Chapter IV, gives 
an average rating on the four sub-sections just above 
zero, which is little better than a M passable“ rating. 

The Sigma indicated that trustees were in agreement for the 
central tendency was good.

Subjections (e), (f) and (g) related to teachers* 
academic background. Less than half of the trustees said 
that teachers knew enough of what they were to teach in 
Division One, while one-quarter of the trustees said that 
they did not have sufficient background. Seventeen 
trustees expressed *110 opinion 1 . The rating on background 
in Division Two (subjection (f)) was somewhat lower, and 
teachers* background in Division Three work was given a 
poor rating with 22 voting it adequate, 20 as inadequate. 
The overall assessment was just barely above zero on a 
plus 3 to minus 3 rating. A central tendency was lacking, 
indicating that trustees disagreed considerably on this 
point. 

The remaining four subjections in the item were 
designed to deal with the teachers* administrative ability, 
after one year of training. Subjection (h) showed that 
trustees did not think that young teachers were not 
adequately trained in maintaining discipline; 23 scored 
the f, yes H column, and 30 the H no M column. 

The teachers* ability to complete the necessary 
forms, (i), was rated somewhat better. Twentyjix rated 
it as good, while 22 rated it as poor. Subjection (j), 
which rated teachers* ability to organize extra-curricular 
activities, was scored, with 28 trustees expressing approval 
and 24 expressing disapproval of teachers* ability here.

On the question of teachers* ability to organize a good 
timetable (k), trustees rated as follows: 21 rated teachers 
as good, 13 rated teachers* ability as inadequate, and 
a relatively large proportion (29 out of 65) indicated 
that they had no opinion. The average rating on these 
last four sub-sections, based on an 8-point range of from 
plus 4 to minus 4, showed a mean Just under zero, indicating 
that teachers are, in trustee opinion, somewhat less than 
'•passable*' in administrative training. Disagreement here 
was again very evident. 

This item drew forth 29 comments. Generally, 
trustees seemed to feel that teachers* training was very 
average in the field.s brought under inspection. Some 
comment was directed at the Faculty of Education, 

"Teachers say they do not learn much at Normal,." 

and, 

"... not taught that maintaining discipline is 
important..." 

Speaking of training in psychology, one trustee said, 

"Discipline with little tots is a ticklish thing. 
They should be taught; the teachers, I mean, 
more the workings of a young child*s mind." 

The lack of in-service thinking was scored by a trustee 

who said, 

"Too much academic, not enough practical 
training." 

Some favorable comments were,

"The majority of our beginning teachers do very 
satisfactory work and they are very enthusiasm 
tic..." 

"I believe they have a better understanding how 
to teach present curriculum, and (are) more 
modern in methods." 

The theme "experience is the best teacher", occurs 
repeatedly in the comments on this and other items. 

Item 15 asked for opinion on the appropriateness 
of the present length of the training program for the 
Junior Diploma* The question was designed to test trustee 
knowledge of the length of the program, as well as to get 
a concensus of opinion on the matter. The first of these 
aims was not realized to any extent. Trustees appeared to 
be of the opinion that the existing length of the program 
was satisfactory. The distribution of trustee opinion was 
normal with very few expressions of opinion for a shorter 
or longer period, and the bulk of opinion expressing 
approbation of the present training period. Typical of 
the comments on the question were these: 

"Depends ... on the pupil." 

"Not well enough informed to say." 

Item 1 6 asked trustees to state the teaching 
qualifications they felt were necessary for different 
teaching positions, ranging from teaching elementary 
school to teaching high school and serving as vocational

counsellor. The object of the item was to get a general 
opinion on this matter, as well as to find if trustees 
were aware of the purpose of the various qualifications* 

In order that a comparative opinion might be obtained, 
this item was placed on the Superintendents® Questionnaire, 
On the first two subjections, trustees revealed that 
they did not know, in come cases, that the Junior Diploma 
was a high school certificate. On subjection (a), 11 
trustees made Inappropriate selections, and on (b) 16 of 
the trustees did the same. There was apparent difference 
of opinion between trustees and superintendents on this 
item, indicated by significant differences in the means 
and sigmas of (a) when it was scored as outlined In 
Chapter IV, It was decided, however, that this apparent 
difference was explained by the fact that trustees 
apparently did not recognize lower limitations on high 
school diplomas, whereas superintendents did. If the 
scoring, as in Chapter IV, is valid, this item indicates 
that trustees would like to have a two and one-half year 
training program for the elementary teacher, and a three 
year period for the intermediate teacher. On item (d), 
(teaching Grade XII), while the means do not differ, 
superintendents show a central tendency which is signif¬ 
icantly more marked than that of the trustees (this is the 
one-half of 1 % level of probability). This indicates that

trustee opinion was not as well crystallized in this 
matter as was that of superintendents. 

On the items (e), (f) and (g) there is no 
significant difference which indicated that trustees 
as a group were as capable of selecting teachers for 
these positions, (as regards training) as were super¬ 
intendents. 

There was a noticeable shying-away from the M. Ed. 
column in this item on the part of the trustee. They 
seemed to prefer two degrees (i.e., B. Ed.-B.A.) to the 
Master of Education degree, even in those positions 
requiring administrative and psychological training. 

Item 18 This item was designed to reveal trustee 
knowledge of the content of the various degree programs 
as well as to gather trustee opinion. It was found that 
22% favored the B. E&. - M. Ed. course, 17% favored the 
B. Ed. - B.A. course, and 2b% favored the B. Ed. - B.Sc. 
course. Thirty-five percent did not record, an opinion. 
Comments accompanying this item revealed that trustees 
were not familiar with the difference in the training 
given in these various courses. On the surface it appeared 
that trustees considered knowledge of the arts and sciences 
was more important than a knowledge of psychology and 
administrative practices. This is an alternative inter-

pretatlon to the impression given from the comments that 
trustees were not too clear as to how these various courses 
differed. Typical comments were: 

“Any one appears satisfactory. 1 ’ 

“While I am not acquainted with the training 
involved in the B.Ed* - M.Ed. it certainly 
should Involve more administrative training.” 

“The more education, the better.” 

In this item, as in item 19, there was a noticeable 
shying~away from the Education degrees. Here again, the 
theme “Experience is the best teacher” recurred* Although 
the point was not appreciated at the time the questionnaire 
was prepared, a comparative opinion from superintendents 
on this item might have been useful. 

Item 19 This item was designed to reveal whether 
trustees thought the Junior Elementary and Intermediate 
Certificate was sufficient training for teaching in 
various positions. Forty^five percent thought it good 
enough for teaching in a rural school, 33%> said it was not. 
For teaching in a single room of two or three grades in a 
graded school, the training was rated adequate by 52 ;% and 
inadequate by 2 $%, For the single room of one grade, the 
figures were b0% and 17%, Trustees were only moderately 
satisfied that the Junior Elementary and Intermediate 
program was adequate*

Comraent8 illustrative of trustees*viewpoints were, 

“ •.. much depends on the Individual ... 11 

"Experience under good guidance I think is more 
helpful than additional training." 

"... It is hardly to be expected that teachers 
can reach professional status with one year*s 
training. Speaking as a trustee, I 4 d say that 
we couldn*t afford to hire the kind of teacher 
we would like to have." 


Generally speaking, the dominant themes running 
through trustee thinking on this matter of teacher-training 
seem to be,* first, that experience is the best training for 
teachers; second, that the quality of teachers* work is 
largely a. product of the Individual*s personality; and 
third, that this matter was left largely to the superin¬ 
tendent. 


TRUST EE PHILOSOPHY ON TEACHER TRAIN ING 

Much of what has been said in Chapter VI on the 
philosophy of trustees relating to trustee-teacher 
relationship, is pertinent to this section. 

Trustees were divided in their opinion on teacher¬ 
training. Not only were they doubtful about the advisability 
of extended teacher-training, they were unsure of what 
constituted good teacher-training. It appeared to be a 
common opinion that trained teachers were both good and 
not good.

This express opinion probably represented the 
actual experience of trustees. It is simply an obser~ 
vatlon of fact. However, their constant reiteration 
that there was not a direct relationship between the 
amount of training and th- quality of teachers, coupled 
with the repeated, and rather extreme view that teachers 
were born and not made, were considered significant 
evidence of a trustee philosophy. This, again, was an 
indication of the deep concern with which teachers are 
regarded. Some of the comments were obviously a reaction 
to the veneer of learning which many teachers evidently 

wore with an exaggerated air of solid worth. Some trustees 
were no doubt commenting from an unhappy experience. 

Trustee reaction to the subject of teacher tra.in« 
ing seemed to be much the same as the reaction of the gen~ 
eral public to this topic. Trustees did not seem to have 
developed a unique viewpoint on this matter even though they 
are directly concerned with it. The large number of comments 
recorded on this matter throughout the whole questionnaire 
suggested that trustees, generally speaking, lacked perspective 
on the purposes served by teacher~trainlng programs. The 
cause of this apparent lack of perspective was assumed to 
be trustees 1 natural concern about the nature of the people 
who taught their children. This suggestion seemed congruent

with the facte and ideas presented in the preceding 
chapter, and with the conclusions outlined there. This 
concern for their children has been assumed as a basic 
in trustee philosophy on teacher training. 

Another possible cause of trustee uneasiness 
about teacher training might be their feeling that the 
educational system as a whole does not suit the needs of 
individual pupils as well as it might# This will be dis¬ 
cussed in Chapter IX #

CHAPTER VTII 


TRUSTEES AND CENTRALIZATION 

Another important field of this study was deemed 
to be the problem of centralization of school services, 
a problem which trustees are now trying to solve. Items 
in the questionnaire directed toward a survey of this 
field are dealt with below. 

Item 13. This item of the Trustees* Questionnaire 
was included for two purposes ~ to assess trustee opinion 
regarding the factors which are hindering centralization, 
and to attempt to assess whether or not trustees have a 
grasp of this problem. To attain the second objective, 
this item was placed in the Superintendents* Questionnaire 
so that their opinion in this matter could be compared 
with that of the trustees, and thus could be used as a 
measure of the latter*s comprehension of the problem. 

In this item, trustees were asked to rate a given 
list of possible factors, which might hinder centralization, 
under the headings, “G-reatly”, Somewhat”, or “Little.” 

Further to this they were then asked to state what, in their 
opinion, were the four most important factors hindering centra^ 
lization. Trustees and superintendents fihowed a high degree of 
unanimity In their ratings on the weighted scale as described

In Chapter IV. Condition of roads received strong support 
as choice for the primary factor among those listed. 

Sixteen out of 17 superintendents, and 50 out of 63 trustees 
made this selection. Increased initial capital expense 
involved in centralization was named the next most important 
factor, followed by out~of~proportion building costs, 
public opinion, and added operating expenses, in that order 
of importance. At this point the two groups of opinions 
diverged, the trustee naming miscellaneous transportation 
problems, vehicle shortage, and the teacher shortage as 
the next most important factors, while the superintendents 
named lack of qualified teachers, the teacher shortage and 
the shortage of building materials in that order. 

Trustees commented heavily on this problem, and 
the comments seemed to support the ratings which were 
procured from the weighted score of Chapter IV, Most 
heavily commented on was the matter of roads. Lack of 
all-weather roads was heavily emphasized, 

”... the lack of adequate roads necessitating 
the curtailment of proper van services 
constitutes the greatest hindrance to 
centralization of schools.” 

And again, 

“G-ravel roads are needed and more money for 
snow-plowing in the winter,”

In the matter of increased initial capital expense 
one trustee said, 

”Our greatest problem is obtaining money to provide 
school buildings and to provide proper busses...” 

The matter of Public Opinion, (which was rated 
fourth by both groups) drew a great deal of comment despite 
its relatively low rating on the weighted scale. Some 
aspects of public opinion which may be hindering centrali¬ 
zation are illustrated by the following comments, 

”... (parents) feel that large centralized high 
schools ... are not to be tolerated as only ... 

(a few) students go on to University and the 
practical training given at home on the farm, 
with its work and responsibilities, together 
with the family group is more important than 
the added cultural value of the central high 
school even with good technical and business 
courses offered.” 

”(opposition) arises mainly from parents* fear 
of children waiting at bus stops when the bus 
might be delayed in very cold weather.” 

”It t s hard to get public opinion in favor of 
centralization of schools due to (the) safety 
problem in connection with drivers and 
especially roads change-over means expense, 
and people are just about taxed to the limit 
now. ” 

”(Farmers) still cling to the idea of a local 
community.” 

“Antagonism between hamlets makes it hard to 
organize public opinion favoring centralization.” 

And so the comments went, indicating hindrances 
all the way from parents* concern for the safety and 
comfort of their children, down to petty local jealousies.

After all the comments on the Public Opinion Sub-Section 
were read, it was thought that there could possibly be 
some connection, however slight, between the two facts 
that van roads are generally poor, and that public opinion 
is still strong against centralization. In our democratic 
system of local self-government, it seemed entirely 
possible that resistance on the part of the general 
public to the idea of centralization could be reflected 
on the inability or unwillingness of local government 
to provide adequate van roads for a centralized school 
system. 

Two trustees, in their comments, revealed that 
they had confused centralization with the formation of 
the Divisional system. Trustees generally, revealed 
themselves as being in favor of centralization, and 
apparently had a good grasp of the problems connected 
with it. 

Item 20 of the trustees* Questionnaire was 
also concerned with centralization. Trustees were asked 
to indicate the time at which they felt the children of 
their district should have a composite high school to 
attend. Thirty-nine percent thought it should be in the 
near future, 3^ thought ”eventually”, and ±5% thought

“not at all". In their comments, trustees indicated 
reasons for their choices. One trustee said, 

“There is too much effort among parents to 
make their children white collar workers 
instead of men among men." 

Those trustees who scored the “eventually" 
column were largely concerned with the matter of the 
necessary finance required. Thus, 

“I think the method of financing will have to 
be considerably revised..." 

A trustee in favor of the scheme said as follows, 

"As we tend more and more to specialization 
a composite high school is inevitable but 
the public must be educated to this 
necessity first," 

Generally speaking, trustees seem to be in favor 
of the composite high school, 

A summary of the data collected on the problem of 
centralization seems to indicate, (a) the trustees on the 

whole are in favor of this movement that roads are 

the chief factor holding back centralization and (c) that 
the general public may not yet be fully convinced that 
centralization is a desirable thing because of the cost, 
and the fact that children are taken from the home to a 
greater extent under such a system.

TRUSTEE PHILOSOPHY ON CENTRALIZATION 


The copious comments registered on the items 
dealing with centralization, indicated that trustees 
are deeply concerned with this problem. They appear 
to have accepted the necessity for centralization, and 
were busy working out the details. The great majority 
were obviously in favor of the movement. It became 
evident that the Province as a wliole was proceeding 
with centralization as fast as was practicable. 

There were relatively few opponents of the trend, 
and those who did oppose it, did so for various reasons. 
An attitude to centralization seemed to have appeared on 
the Alberta educational scene similar to one in the more 
densely settled districts of the United States (such as 
New York State). This attitude was that the loss of 
close contact with home and community affairs which is 
involved in centralization cancelled any advantage that 
it had to offer. 

Another group based its opposition to centralis 
zation on two things; first, the fear that guardis.ns have 
of trusting their children to the System, e.g., physical 
dangers of busses, and moral d_angers of dormitory life; 
and second, local jealousies and intercommunity rivalry.

On the whole, however, trustees thought that 
centralization offered some very desirable benefits; 

“ •.. the average child ... will make a better- 
citizen with an education where academic and 
technical courses are more evenly balanced.* 1 

“One only needs to consider the great drop in 
high school attendance where only academic 
subjects are taught to realize the need to 
give instruction in the business of using- 
one 1 s hands. M 

“Usually operating costs are less in centrali¬ 
zation. “ 

The comments and statistics indicated that the 
majority of trustees were strongly in favor of this 
movement• 

The attempt to discover the philosophical back¬ 
ground of trustee thinking led to a study of the history 
of the movement toward centralization. The earliest 
activity along these lines was the consolidation of 
several rural districts into the consolidated district. 
Conditions favoring consolidation (all-weather roads, 
speedy transportation, concentration of population) were 
comparatively rare, and consequently only a small number 
of consolidations were successful. In the next stage, 
centralization was known by the name of Rural Secondary 
Education. By the late 1920*s the boom period had resulted 
in the overcrowding of town and village high schools.

During this period there was a concerted effort to establish 
rural high schools throughout the Province, Many were 
established by the time the depression struck, and in a 
number of cases, they had to be closed down for lack of 
financial support. People had had some experience with 
rural secondary education, and when the service was lost, 
they became keenly aware of the advantages they were 
missing. The opportunity for establishing secondary 
education in rural areas was again presented with the 
establishment of the Divisional system in the late ’thirties 1 . 
At this stage the movement included centralization of both 
primary and secondary schools. The term, “centralization”, 
became the accepted name for the trend which was one of 
the outcomes of the Divisional system. Due to their ex¬ 
perience in rural secondary education, the people of the 
Province were already largely in favor of centralization. 

The Department of Education, which had sponsored the 
centralization of school administration, was no doubt 
pleased at this favorable result of the Divisional system. 

It is also possible that the novelty of pioneering in 
education appealed to some of the Alberta trustees. 

This review of the growth of the idea of centrali¬ 
zation, together with the data presented, indicated that

the basic philosophy of trustees was a combination of the 
practical and the humanistic,^* 

11 ... the greatest asset this Province has ig the 
ability people have to work. This ability is 
most certainly increased through proper edu¬ 
cation and by cutting down the facilities for 
getting this education, are we not really 
reducing our potential wealth?" 

The Department of Education felt that the follow¬ 
ing quotation contained the basic philosophy behind 
centralization,^ 

"... each youth possesses certain abilities 
which he needs to be helped to discover and 
be inspired to develop and use to the utmost. 
This latent ability of youth is a. nation 1 s 
primary resource, and on its development 
national welfare rests. It therefore becomes 
a primary function of the state and nation, 
in the interests of its own welfare, to 
establish the agencies for discovering 
abilities; for providing means for the 
development of abilities, whatever kind 
they be; and for stimulating youth to 
develop them." 


These quotations suggest the very practical 
core of thought that has been postulated. It appeared 
that education was considered to be a. means of increas¬ 
ing the wealth of the community by increasing the ability

of the individual to work. The context of both the 
quotations did not permit the extreme interpretation 
that the sole purpose of education was to build up the 
state, or even that such a. purpose was the only major 
one. However, it appeared that the statements indicated 
a primarily practical philosophy. 

A large number of trustees, in their comments on 
this problem, were concerned with children as individuals. 
The majority of comments, both for and against central!" 
zation, were apparently based on a humanistic ideology. 

The comments quoted in the first section of this chapter 
supported this interpretation, and the same attitude was 
observed throughout the comments cn the whole trustees 1 
questionnaire. It was noted that those who thought their 
Division should have a composite school 1 in the near future 1 
indicated by their comments that they were concerned v/ith 
the problem in its relation to their current crop of 
students. This seems to be a humanistic viewpoint, a 
concern for the individual “now”, a3 contrasted to a 
long~term practical outlook which might deny the individual 
the service of a composite school until practical con" 
siderations made it feasible.

On the whole, the majority of trustees seemed 
to lean in the direction of a "humanistic 11 philosophy 
rather than toward a more or less "materialistic" outlook 
in the matter of centralization. This evaluation of 
trustee motives appeared to be an adequate explanation 
of trustee activities in this field.

CHAPTER IX 


TRUSTEES AND THE AIMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 

Trustee opinion on the aims of secondary education 
in Alberta was surveyed by means of item 29 1 on the 
trustee questionnaire. 

Item 29 Trustees were asked to classify a given 
list of educational objectives as being "Primary* 1 , 
"Secondary" or "minor". They were then requested to rank 
the aims which they had classified as "Primary" in their 
order of importance. Some of the aims were classified as 
primary more frequently than others. The following sum¬ 
mary deals with this classification. 

First, trustees indicated that they considered 
the prime aim of secondary education to be, "Training 
(including a fair amount of time and labor) to produce 
sould character, i.e., reliability, honesty, punctuality, 
unselfishness, etc." Eighty-eight percent of the trustees 
considered this a primary aim. 

In the second place, with 77^> of the trustees 
selecting it as a primary aim, was "To become one*s own 

This item was originally a complete questionnaire on 
the aims of secondary education, and was borrowed from 
the personal library of Dr. H.E, Smith, University of 
Alberta.

teacher. To be ready and keen to continue learning when 
school days are over. Learning how to think.” 

’’Method, neatness, good handwriting and spelling. 
Polished work and a high standard of finish 1 in everything,“, 
was rated third, with 64$ of trusteeB classifying it as a 
primary aim* 

Fourth. Trustees felt that, "Initiative and 
self-confidence, .... giving wide and important responsi¬ 
bilities in school life", was a primary aim. Some of 
trustees placed this among the primary aims. 

Fifth. There were three objectives grouped in 
this place. About 45 $ of the trustees classed these as 
primary aims. These objectives were; "Academic training 
by means of civics, economics, etc. for citizenship.", 
"Sociability, societies, clubs, teaching of good manners 
and good speech, ... perhaps some form of self government." 
and "Vocational training, special courses for careers, 
typing, shorthand, engineering, etc." 

Sixth, "Cultivation of a high standard of 
academic work. Necessarily restricted in range. High 
examination results", was classified as primary by 43$ of 
Trustees. 

Seventh. Forty-one percent of the trustees thought 
that "Physical fitness and sports?nanship, sports, gymnastics, 


121 










( 





' 




u' CT'" V f) c: 






School and inter-school games, Idea of a Sportsm an and a 
Gentleman 11 was a primary aim of secondary education. 

The remaining subjections of item 29 were classed 
as “Primary* 1 by few trustees. “Cultivation of a wide, if 
rather superficial, range of subjects academically. Exam¬ 
ination results unimportant.“, received the lowest percent¬ 
age in this classification. 

The chief secondary aim was “Manual dexterity, wood 
and metal work, Arts, Crafts, Practical Science, Gardening, 
etc.* 1 : Heading the list of minor aims was, “Sense of world 
brotherhood, vivsits to foreign lands, ... world history, etc,* 1 

The primary aims were rated in order of importance 
by only 30$ of the trustees. Although ?0$ of the question¬ 
naires were not accurate enough to be useful in this respect, 
yet a summary of this part of the item was made. A comparison 
of the 30$ group 1 s questionnaires with those of the total 
group responding to this item was made, and no significant 
difference was found. It was concluded that the 30$ group 
was entirely representative of the larger group. The 
weighted score method of analyzing the opinions of the 30 $ 
group resulted in the following: 

In this method of ranking, training to produce sound 
character placed first on the list, while training children 


122 













■$ ; 






to become their own teachers placed second, as they had 
done in the first classification. Cultivation of a high 
standard of academic work, which had placed sixth, was 
now third. In fourth place was the objective dealing with 
the development of a keen sense of religion and spiritual 
values, which was in eighth place previously. In all, 

72 $ of the returned questionnaires were useful in sum¬ 
marizing item 29 . 

TRUSTEE PHILOSOPHY ON THE AIMS OF SECONDARY EDUCATION 

The aims selected by trustees as major were those 
which appear to be basic to the development of character 
and individuality. "Sound character,** and "learning how 
to think*,* were rated as the two most important items. 

In both methods of scoring these two items were first and 
second, and so it was assumed that this represented the 
overwhelming opinion of trustees, "Academic training", 
was rated third according to one method of scoring, and 
sixth by the other. It was noticed that those who rated 
this item as a major aim tended to give it a high ranking. 
The same was true in the case of "religious training". 

The opposite tendency was noted in the cases of the sub¬ 
sections concerning good craftsmanship, initiative and 
self-confidence, academic training for good citizenship, 
teaching of good manners, and vocational training. Trustees

tended to classify these items as major aims hut rated them 
as the less important in the group. 

Additional data weie derived from a review of the 

history of curriculum in Alberta, The ASTA came into being 

as a result of trustee interest in curriculum. The general 

nature of this problem concerned vocational training, but 

details are lacking. In 1921 concern with curriculum 

centred on the question of whether training should lead 
2 

to, “mental training and mental discipline 11 or whether 

the training should be extensive. In a 1924 statement by 

the Minister of Education, Hen, Perren Baker, the emphasis 

was on the development of the individual, Mr. Baker said, 

education is the unfolding of the man 
himself*” 

During 1925 three committees were set up to make 

any necessa.ry revision of the Alberta curriculum. After 

their work had been done, Mr, Baker reported on the 
4 

outcome,

H ••• as for the supposed 1 frills and fancies 1 , 
with the solitary exception of physiology and 
hygiene, there is not a single subject that 
has not been here for years ... The idea of 
the committee was to simplify the course, and 
to a considerable degree, they have succeeded." 

Continuous revision of the curriculum was carried 
on, and some broad changes of content were introduced. 

In the 1 thirties' technical electives were put into the 
school curriculum, and these courses began to appear on 
timetables of town and village schools throughout the 
Province. The introduction of practical agricultural 
courses followed. 

Two generalizations about trustees* thinking on 
curriculum emerged from a study cf the history and the 
relevant data: First, some trustees seemed to have s 
bias concerning the matters of religious instructions 
and strict academic training. Second, the expansion of 
the curriculum to include more and more vocational train** 
ing did not conceal the fact that trustees were still 
strongly humanistic in their philosophy. 

The tendency to rate strict academic training 
and religious instruction high among primary aims by 
those who classified them as a primary aim, indicated 
that convictions were strong on this matter. This was 
probably due to a not unusual element of conservatism. 

It has been noted since the beginning of history that

one generation soon begins to look with question on the 
training of the next. Some trustees complained that the 
three '’R 1 © 1 ’ were not adequately learned, and still others 
termed the changes in curriculum as ‘^frills”. In the 
matter of religious instruction, bias is not unusual. 

From the fact that trustees tended to class the relevant 
subjections as major aims, but ranked them low in import*-* 
ance among the major aims, it seemed obvious that vocat~ 
ional training, as an aim in education, was gaining ground. 

Thus, it appeared obvious that although trustees 
were concerned with training of their children to make a 
living, yet the stronger trend appeared to be humanistic. 
The two major basic aims were those which concern the 
development of the individual as such. It appeared that 
trustees were more concerned with training their children 
to live than with training them to earn a living.

CHAPTER X 


A SU MMARY 

THE H A V ERAGE» TRUST EE 

A composite picture suffers from the same defects 
as an analogy, but may sometimes serve as a useful method 
of summarizing data. Some idea of what the average school 
trustee was like in 1950 may t> e gained from a study of the 
statistics which have been accumulated. The average trustee 
was 55 years of age, married, and had four children. He 
had lived in Alberta for nearly 39 years, and had spent 
nearly 5 years as a chairman of a School Board. He also 
had been secretary of a Board for nearly four years, and 
had taught school for nearly a year. He had served for 
nearly a year on the executive of a Home and School associ¬ 
ation. Two of his four children were in school. He spent 
about twelve hours a month at Board meetings as well as 
giving some eighteen hours a month to school business. 
Seventy-one percent of his remaining time was spent in 
farming, twelve percent in running a business, six percent 
in professional activities. Three percent of his time was 
taken up with housework. He had attended four annual 
conventions of the ASTA. He had ten years of formal school¬ 
ing.

Hie philosophy wae colored by the fact that he was 
a parent* He had built up hie school under the belief 
that a better school plant made better education for his 
children. He had never been entirely satisfied with the 
curriculum, and had concerned himself with improving it. 

He had. always been Interested in the calibre of the people 
who taught his school because they dealt with the character 
training of his children. Consequently, his relations 
with tne teacher were not always comfortable. He very seldom 
showed extreme bias on any subject, though his opinions 
on educational matters generally were well crystalized. 

This, with its limitations, might be a composite pic¬ 
ture of the Alberta Divisional Trustee in 1950* 

CONOLUaiOMS AND KEGQMMEftiDAT1UNS 

This thesis was so planned that a summary of each 
major topic is to be found at the end of the chapter deal¬ 
ing i^ith that topic* The findings in Chapters Three, Five, 
Six, Seven, Eight and Nine are summarized in the work of 
Mr Sillito in these chapters. There seems little merit in 
repeating this work at this time. There are some major areas, 
however, itfhich require further discussion. 

An area of unrest was revealed in the matter of 
trustee-teacher relationships, A great deal of careful

research needs to be done here before accuracy of opinion 
can be obtained. A glance through Appendix II will reveal 
a strain not usually found in the relations between the 
ordinary employer and hie employees. It was felt that 
conclusions noted in Chapter Six were clouded by personal 
bias, and it was hoped that the limited conclusions of this 
thesis will stimulate further research in this area, 

In the matter of curriculum, trustee opinion 
appeared to be in a state of flux. This was not a new 
situation, and will probably not be resolved in the 
immediate future. The conflict in trustee thinking seemed 
to lie between two schools of thought ~ that of training 
the child to live, as opposed to that which places the 
emphasis on teaching him to earn a living . 

A large proportion of trustees seemed to rely 
heavily on the superintendent in questions of administration, 
particularly with regard to the technicalities of the 
School Act, the grants system, and teacher training and 
qualification* It is entirely possible that trustees 
know all they need to know in this respect. As mentioned 
previously, this thesis does not attempt to set standards 
for trustees, but it does seem logical that further research 
in this area might reveal whether or not this condition 
is a healthy one*

Trustees revealed that they are keenly aware of 
the problems Incident to the centralization of schools, and 
that they are busy working upon these problems. 

Trustees seemed of the opinion that the one-year 
program of teacher training is inadequate. They favored 
two or more years, with the emphasis on in-service training. 
Trustees seemed to be generally unacquainted with the com¬ 
ponents of the teacher training program, and a direct 
effort to give them further information on this topic 
might have the effect of crystalizing their opinion. 

For the purposes of this study, a short ASTA 
history proved adequate. It is suggested that a more 
extended history, with particular reference to growth and 
changes in curriculum, and to chronic educational problems, 
would be useful. 

In conclusion, it is hoped that a merit of this 
thesis may possibly lie in the fact that it has raised 
questions in a field of research relatively unexplored to 
date. If this work has such merit, the writers are sat¬ 
isfied that it has made a contribution to Education in 
Alberta.

APPENDIX 1 


QUESTIONNAIRES AND FORM LETTERS USED. 





{ 




Form letter sent with each questionnaire 


Consort, Alberta, 
Feb. 2, 1950. 


TO: All Divisional Trustees. 
Dear Trustee, 


The undersigned candidates for the M.Ed degree. University of 
Alberta, are undertaking a thesis dealing with the Divisional school trustee 
in Alberta. We recognize that the educational philosophy of the trustee is an 
extremely important factor in the school system of our province. In the 
business of running our schools, the trustees spend several millions of dollars 
each year. The things this money buys comprise the education of the children 
in the province. It is an undoubted fact that the educational philosophy of the 
trustee is a vital factor in education. 

For the purpose of surveying this factor, the accompanying question- 
naire was prepared, and it is being sent out to every Divisional school trustee 
in Alberta. The accuracy of the results will be largely determined by the 
number of completed questionnaires returned. We realize that trustees are busy 
people, but we feel that education cannot grow to fit our changing requirements 
without research into its vital components. We, therefore, request your help 
in completing this survey* 

We want your opinions. We realize that questions cannot always be 
adequately phrased to bring out opinions unless a comment on the question is 
recorded. We invite you to comment freely in the space provided in the question¬ 
naire as well as on the back of the pages if you should need more space. 

The committee which is supervising this survey is composed of the 
following - W. Frame, M.A., Chief Supt. of Schools, Department of Education; 

H.E. Smith, Ph.D., Faculty of Education; F 0 Baker, Ph.D., Faculty of Education; 
H.T. Coutts, M.A., Faculty of Education. 

We invite the trustees to add their many contributions to 
education by completing and returning this questionnaire. 


Sincerely yours, 

J.D. McFetriage, 7011-109 St., Edmonton. 
M.T. Sillito, Consort, Alberta. 

(Please mail completed questionnaires to Mr. Sillito.)

Form letter as follow-up to those trustees who had not completed questionnaire - 


Consort, Alberta, 
March 30, 1950. 


Dear Divisional Trustee, 

Some time ago you received a questionnaire designed to survey the 
opinion of the Alberta School Trustee on educational matters. 

The replies so far have been very informative, but unfortunately, 
enough replies have not been received to give a clear picture of the education¬ 
al philosophy of the School Trustee. 

We earnestly request you to complete and return the questionnaire 
by the end of April. If you have mislaid your copy, or did not receive one, 
a post card sent to the address below will bring you a copy of the questionnaire 
by return Bail. 

In the interests of broader understanding in education, we ask 
your contribution to the philosophy of the Divisional Trustee. 


Sincerely yours, 

M.T. Siilito, B.Ed., 
Consort, Alberta*

APPENDIX II 


COMMENTS OF TRUSTEES (VERBATIM) 


Comments on Question Thirteen 


‘•This area being pretty well in the foothills make centralization a 
tough problem as roads are poor and are impassable many weeks at a time* 1 ' 

“Taking it all through, except for capital expenditure, there is 
practically nothing to hinder centralization* In fact the Board and 85 % of 
the ratepayers are for it*” 

“Parents also protest when high school students are removed from their 
farm responsibilities* Many feel that large centralized High Schools, entailing 
dormotories are not to be tolerated as only part (small) of students go on to 
University and the practical training given at home on the farm, with its work 
and responsibility, together with the family group is more important than the 
added cultural value of a central High School even with good technical and 
business courses offered." 

“People living away from Main highways and Van routes see other children 
served and insist on like service* The Department's insistence on standardized 
vehicles and the law enforcement drive are beyond reason and control and cause' 
cause costs to mount♦“ 

“Usually operating costs are less in centralization, therefore an incen¬ 
tive." 


“I would estimate that cost per capita of education in adequate new 
modern buildings and with new curriculum and optional courses and reasonably 
well qualified teachers had almost doubled the cost of the one room school* 
(including vanning costs)•“ 

“People in this Div. are asking for centralization - yes insisting on 
it, where it is next to impossible to provide, owing to lack of gravelled roads 
and accomodation at Village centers. Only in rare cases is there any opposition 
and that arises mainly from parents fear of children waiting at Bus stops when 
Bus might be delayed in very cold weather*“ 

“Loss of equalization Grant with reduced number of operating schools 
and increased operating expense due to van costs * . •“

Comments on Question Thirteen continued 


"••• more co-operation between council and school boards*" 

"In some respects centralization has been for the better, mainly the 
training of Shop and nome Ec, Typing etc. As for being able to obtain better 
qualified teachers for centralized teaching. NO. Since I have been on the 
Board I have noticed something that I don't like. We have had teachers with 
degrees, and while I am unable to exactly explain the reasons, I do believe 
that many humans should never go beyond a certain point in advanced education. 
It has been said that enough is enough of anything. If they are unable to put 
it across without a tempermental reaction then it is useless if it affects 
them to the extent that they continually let you know how superior they are 
to their fellow man, then they are both a newsance to themselves as well as 
society." 

"Our building costs are too high. Architects fees (are) out of all 
porportion to what they do. We will build 3-4 roomed school this summer at 
an estimated cost of $62,000 each using the same set of plans in each case 
and we as a board must pay 5 % on the contract price of all three buildings 
to the architect." 

"Its hard to get public opion in favor of centralization of school du© 
to safety problem, in connections with drivers and especially roads condition 
of roads year around is big problem then of course there is the problem of 
expense and change over means expense and people are just about taxed to limit 
now." 


"Centralization came into effect after a series of bad years for farmers. 
They still cling to the idea of a local community. Costs of improvements, in¬ 
cluding "teachers qualifications" is out of proportion with our ability to pay". 

"In a visit to the Red Deer school last year I consider this set up a 
big step forward in education, the fact that pupils from all over Alberta 
attend this school they must be giving pupils what they want, a number of 
pupils attend from this division ..." 


"People are very much opposed to the Dormitory system. Pupils of higher 
grades are so far from any one centre that it is impossible to offer anytning 
outside ordinary studies plus elementary shop. Roads are far behind and will 
be more than five years before they are really in shape for present van service."

r, (b) and (i) Teacher shortage has accelerated centralization in our 
division* 

(g) Public opinion cannot hinder centralization for it was forced on 
the people without a plebiscite. There is still a lot of opposition to the 
scheme. In our div. the school bus runs by the door of some parents wuo 
refuse to use it because of road hazard. These parents supply norses." 

"••.but there are still a number of people who say "we were forced in¬ 
to it against our will**. It seems to me that the cost of centralization is 
higher than* some smaller schools could operate with but on the other hand the 
same advantages cannot be supplied. Capital expense it seems must be sup¬ 
plemented from some other source.' 1 

"Centralization in thickly-settled districts close to town is not too 
much of a problem but in sparsely-settled ranching country is desirable but 
almost impossible mainly because of the bad roads and long distances between 
ranches." 

"...parents prefer having their children at home to assist in doing 
chores. We are building quite a large School at ••*. and have had no serious 
shortage of building materials. It is the parents who need to be educated re¬ 
garding any change in Education." 

"In my opinion the lack of adequate roads necessitating the curtailment 
of proper van services constitutes the greatest hinderance to the successful 
centralization of schools. This factor alone is is largely responsible for 
any adverse public opinion which exists* The high cost of building material and 
labor limits the majority of school boards to the erection of makeshift school 
centers, lacking proper sanitation, class room facilities, etc. all necessary 
to obtain the proper advantages of centralization." 

"Antagonism between hamlets makes it hard to organize public opinion 
favouring centralization." 

"In this area, question of control amongst three divisions rates No.l 
in hindrance towards centralization." 

"Centralization usually in a Town or village is eagerly supported by 
residents of each places, as it tends to aid in their development* Rural 
residents who produce the means to make centralization possible resent the 
fact that the rural areas are supposedly not worth development. To reverse the 
issue and say "Let us educate children among clean wholesome surroundings" 
would bring a great wave of protest from the present supporters."

“Under the present road conditions we can not pick up all children 
at there door, and some people seem to think that we should pick them all 
up at there door or none* hVen if we should have to travel four extra miles 
for one child.” 

“Out greatest problem is obtaining money to provide school buildings 
and to provide proper busses* Gravel roads are needed and more money for 
snow plowing in the winter*” 

“Many ratepayers think it will raise the cost, many have a number of 
1/4 sections and family has grown up and all they can see is the taxes they 
are paying these and the Bachelors are the worst#“ 


Comments on Question Fourteen 

“Teachers say they do not learn much at Normal experience is the best 
teacher#“ 

“.•.not taught that maintaining discipline is important”# 

“Some people never learn others improve with experience, which is(the) 
best teacher*” 

“The only excuse for 1 yr*s training must be “shortage of teachers”. 

On no other term is so short a term justified*” 

“All permanent teachers need more than one year of professional training.” 

“Personally I can’t answer these questions by yes and no as we get some 
very good teachers under the one year training. One year is not enough and 
many of the teachers are too young to cope with all the problems they face 
but I would say most the answers to the above depends on the individual#” 

“Not obtained by theory but by experience. Many from families where they 
have younger brothers and sisters have that experience. I believe their dif¬ 
ficulty lies not in not knowing but lack of ability to impart it to pupils. 
...but some have it naturally and some never have it or get it, regardless 
of training#” 

“The average teacher will prove quite capable in grades 1 to 5 after 
that if they are not able to keep disipline they should not teach school 
degrees and all the rest of it are useless#”

"Discipline with little tots is a ticklish thing, they should be taught; 
the teachers I mean more the workings of a young childs mind* ***Hospital warns 
against the employing of highly intelligent, nervous teachers in primary 
rooms#" 

"Average teacher just out of school are representative of the type of 
schooling we have been giving them"* 

"Teachers just beginning do not get enough help from inspectors or 
their assistants." 

"In view of the fact that tne life of the one year trainee as a teacher 
is only about five years I tnink that one years training is plenty*" 

"To much acedemic not enough practical training." 

"The majority of our beginning teachers do very satisfactory work and 
they are enthusiastic* Of course there are some misfits. Personal conduct 
is often deplorable (public drunks,petting etc.)." 

"Some do but others do notj* 

"I feel incapable if expressing my opinion as to the degree of book 
learning and training deemed necessary to the teaching of any grade of pupils. 

I realize that the accumulation of the facts of science and arts are necessary 
before they can be impacted. But question if this makes a teacher. I have seen 
teachers of limited learning and training doing a far better job of imparting 
knowledge than others of higher academic standing. Some in the profession 
appear to be in possession of that talent which enables them to lead a child 
to the threshold of his own mind far more than others and if tnis be missing 
any degree is largely nullified for the purpose of imparting knowledge." 

"As these questions apply more to the work of the Supt. trustee comment 
is difficult." 

"I believe they have a better understanding of how to teach present 
coriculum and more modern in methods." 

"Some are real good."

but I firmly believe it is the most important of all and regardless 
of cost should have the best trained teacher for beginners possible so as 
to ensure pupils proper grounding and proper attitude towards work. As 
small pupils are great imatators, their teachers should be especially 
good in manners and English. 

I realize that my opinion on above questions as indicated by check¬ 
marks re 16 may be far from the best. School boards I believe usually 
rely on superintendants advise as it is hard for the average trustee 
to keep in touch with what the different courses and degrees fit the 
teacher for. 

My observation leads me to definitely believe that many teachers are 
taking degrees not so much to improve their worth as teachers, as to get 
into the higher brackets in the Sal. Sched."

"Not well enough informed to say." 


Comments on Question Sixteen 

"I do not feel capable of giving an intelligent answer to the majority 
of the above questions so will not attempt an answer or opinion on any of 
them. " 

"These questions cannot be condensed into a strict formulae. The set-up 
of our present of Education is satisfactory to me. Teachers are born, not 
made. I've had old timers not worth their Board; Supervisors that "put it 
across" better than qualified teachers. Personality quite often is more 
successful than routine and dogmatized teaching." 

"I have known many teachers, without any University education, who were 
better teachers than many teachers with two degrees. This includes all high 
school grades as well as other grades. A University degree should make a 
good teacher better, however, no amount of education will make some people 
good teachers." 

"I feel that the answers to this question, and probably #14, should 
come from those, who have had experience in the class-room, which I have not

had, that is, in the role of teacher* Teaching our children, is in ray 
opinion, the most responsible position in the world to-day - consequently 
who can say how much minimum training or qualification a teacher should 
have.? As far as grading them professionally, I have marked my answers, 
but my real answer is "no teacner can have too much training - a minimum 
of training will, exceptions excepted, produce minimum results." 

" I am firmly convinced teachers should be paid on teaching ability 
not only on academic standing*" 

"It would seem to me that an Arts Degree would be best for a Voca¬ 
tional Councallor ane be a mature person who had some knowledge of 
Economics, Commerce, and Agriculture coupled with knowledge gained by 
travel. One should have enough "horse sense" to be able to see and point 
out potential demand for creative work*" 

“Nearly all teachers are lacking in organizing extra curricular 
activities* If a teacher takes semi part in a district in extra curricular 
activities she or he seems to get better co operation from pupils and parents." 

"This should also be answered by Superintendents. Having these diploma's 
doesn't mean anything when it comes to meeting public, imparting knowledge 
to children and maintaining proper discipline." 

"Best teaching results are not always obtained by a teachers degree 
standing but on the average it is a great help to them especially from 
grade 9 to 12*" 


Comments on Question Eighteen 

"None of these degrees courses offer any training for principals in 
Alberta* Try some of the U.S* Universities ('and I'm a Canadian') any degree 
and experience under a good principal*" 

"While I am not acquainted with the training involved in a BED and 
M.ED it certainly should be designed to provide more administrative 
training."

Comments on Question Nineteen 

"I believe the rural school with all grades from I to VIII and often 
IX is a very difficult task for any teacher and feel that first year 
teachers should have the junior rooms in a graded school with principal 
and others to help." 

"I do not t ink the question on sufficient training can be answered 
by a definite yes or no for too much depends on the individual taking the 
instruction, the same class may have both poor and good teachers." 

"Two grades to a room are a Imost ideal more lead to neglected 
students and poor schoolroom habits in pupils." 

"Experience under good guidance I tuink is more helpful than additional 
training." 

"The most difficult job (above) usually comes to the less able teacher, 
at a lower salaryl in Alberta*. Centralization seems to be the only satis¬ 
factory answer." 

•*When we have nothing but supervisors in our rural schools for many 
years its only natural that any kind of a teacher looks good to us* It is 
hardly to be expected that teachers can reach professional status with one 
years training. Speaking as a trustee I'd say we couldn't afford to hire 
the kind of teachers we would like to have."

•’Would say no if we could afford to pay the difference for a degree

“These teachers are taught Ancient History where they should know 
methods of teaching and child psychology.” 

"First you have to have people to love teaching and that training 
starts when they start school we must get teachers to teach teachers.” 

“The above cannot be answered by yes or no or 1,2,3 a teacher must 
have experience to find out which class room is most suitable.” 

“The average rural school demands a versatile teacher one of excep¬ 
tional teaching ability, “Just a rural teacher” to many has a stigmatizing 
sound while the word graded carries a recommendation in itself. Rural 
teachers have been the means of turning out more good Canadians than other 
one factor.” 

“Most teachers make teaching a steping stone to something alse a 
little longer training course would eleminate a lot dead wood.” 

M I believe the rural School Teacher should have the best training 
possible for school work, plus a course in diplomacy and first aid." 

“I consider the professional training, attitudes, personality, etc. 
much more important than academic training.” 

“The rural ungraded school is a great problem in organization and 
discipline and burden of work of many grades. The rural school teacher is 
on her own unable to get much supervision or advice.” 

“ “Teachers are bom not made”. We have had very hignly educated 
teachers who were almost a complete failure and Supervisors who made a 
success teaching. Some teachers should never teach or rather “keep school”.” 

"I believe a teacher with limited training is just as good (in many 
cases) as one with more training." 

“In most cases young teachers comming out of the Faculy are neither 
trained right or enough to handle a rural school. But do an excellent job 
in graded school with 1 or 2 grades.” 

"Many excellent teachers have low rated certificates. Some very poor 
teachers have high rated certificates. The natural ability and desire is 
very important; But is not classified.”

"My opinion is there should be only four or five composite High 
Schools in the Province large enough to accomadate all pupils." 

I think the average child who does not expect to enter the pro¬ 
fessions will make a better citizen with an education where acadamic 
and technical courses are fairly evenly balanced." 

"There is too much effort on part of parents to make children 
white collar men instead of men among men. Option of student on a 
course of his choice would be better." 

"My answer "eventually" a but I think the method of financing will 
have to be considerably revised - in order to pay for, and operate 
such schools for all 0 

While these schools have still to prove themselves, I believe they 
are a step in the right direction - I cannot support the idea of smaller 
hi-schools, say 2-4 rooms, which, from my experience in this Division, 
are favored by the public. In such sc ools, it is not economic to offer 
more than a few of the optional subjects - these are costly from the fin¬ 
ancial point-cf-view in the way of equipment, and only partly fill the 
needs of the various students. The composite Hi-school is the only other 
alternative to the small Hi-school referred to above except the smaller 
Hi-school, which I regret to say is still in some favor, by parents, wao 
argue (1) We want our Hi-school in our own toen, if there are only (say) 

6-12 students in attendance - give them a skeleton curriculum, provided 
they can get Gr. XII diploma, rather than send them elsewhere. (2) Small¬ 
town pride, - why build up the next small-Town’s school. 

Conclusion* the Composite di-school, in theory at any rate, seems to 
be the answer." 

"With our Public and High Schools in the division, and the Agriculture, 
Technical schools, and University in the Province, I don‘t think a Composite 
high school needed in smaller divisions. But would be good in a larger 
area." 

"I’m not convinced. The whole system seems to be too easy and disciplined 
tninking has suffered in order to provide a lot of practical frills that do 
not retain the substenance of a fundamental Schl. ideal program." 

"There is not enough hours in the school life of the pupils to absorb 
more than they are now getting. Let them go onto Prov. School of Agriculture 
or Technical School as they choose."

it takes to large an area, distances for students to be conveyed is to 
great a hazzard on highways where every thing imagineable is being trans¬ 
ported, to great a distance is bad anyway.“ 

“One only needs uo consider the great drop in H.S. attendance where 
only acedemic subjects are taught to realize the need to give instruction 
in the business of using ones hands♦“ 

"As we tend more and more to specialization a composite u.S. is 
inevitable but the public most be educated to this necessity first." 

"Lack of policy in the dept of education is hindering this." 

“Regardless of finances the rural children should have these courses 
now. Why not teach them mechanics etc. rather than have them learn it 
the hard way." 

"Cost of present education as born by taxes are at too high a level 
if market prices slump." 

“Higher provincial grants for capitol expenditures would help a 
great deal." 

"...I do think they are fin&, but only one for every 3 or 4 Divisions 
other wise they will be to expensive." 

"The composite high school should be available to any child in the 
division who wishes to attend." 

"In a division such as this, the cost of a composite high school is 
much too high under the present method of school financing. High School 
population too small."

"In a new country such as Alberta I believe that there are 30 many 
more opportunities in private enterprise that civil service in spite of 
its permanency and pensions does not appeal as much as a chance to be 
one's own boss and a chance to strike it rich in a hurry* 

As the majority of teachers are women marriage the main objective 
in most womens lives a continual drain on the profession is unavoidable 
and until the profession becomes more stabilized with men holding most of 
jobs, it seems that a large turnover in personnel is certain especially 
in boom periods." 

"The A*T*A. endeavoring to maintain a teacher shortage. The poor 
teacher's most dissatisfied with salary." 

"The general attitude of the public towards teachers, for instance 
hardly any one wants to be "bothered" with boarding a teacher has some¬ 
thing to do in creating a teacher shortage." 

"Teachers is a title given to all persons who preside in a classroom 
after short training period regardless of qualifications re their ability 
£0 teach." 

"Too much adverse propaganda by A.T.A. and some teachers. Superintendents 
and Officials of Dept, of Education snould have higher salaries. Higher 
salaries should be paid to teachers who are outstanding in their work and 
results - the same as people in other professions. Get away from insisting 
that all teachers - good, bad and indifferent be paid the same." 

"The professional ranks are always starved during war-time - lots of jobs, 
in towns, where the standard of living is higher, plenty of social life, 
wit 14 plenty of money to indulge in it freely - in short the easiest way 
of getting through life - why bother with study, long and expensive training 
with no returns while training. 

This trend towards easy living is carried over into the post-war period, 
and only necessity or education will change it. Why should this shortage 
continue?. I have marked 4 reasons in your question - but they are only a 
small part of the cause behind this shortage - the real reason, to my mind 
is to be found in the small numbers of young people, who today look upon 
life as anything other than having a good time* Such an outlook will not 
send tne numbers, that we need, into the teaching profession (e.g.)- 

The only way to stop this trend is through education, and example, 
a rather slow process, but now is the earliest time that we can start.

So let us reconsider as to what our aims in education should be. 

I think (for what it is worth) that we should back off somewhat from the 
line we have been following of late, which has been too much along the 
idea of training for a specific job, from which to make a living, coupled 
with too great an effort to develope each individual personality to make 
such a personality attractive and popular - rather should we mot first 
make sure that our young people have a solid grounding in the basic truths 
that have come to us from the past. Such as service, and satisfaction 
from service, and jobs well-done etc. - then I think the teacher shortage 
will take care of itself - for what greater satisfaction can anyone desire 
than the task of starting the next generation off on the right foot along 
the road of service to others, which alone in the end merits and gains 
the respect of our own and succeeding generations. The necessity of a 
job may give us teachers; education alone will give us the kind of teachers 
which we require. We still meet some of them, but not enough. 11 

”No doubt salaries were too low but teachers organization advertised 
so many abuses to their profession that many young people were convinced 
it must be bad, rather than put emphasis on the challenge of the profes- 
sion. M 


”Re (o) This is where Hi-school principals could do good service in 
providing good prospects but, I wonder if they want the supply kept up 
to the point where teacher shortage will vanish.” 

"I believe our teacherage shortage is about over." 

“This was caused by war conditions and will soon again be normal.” 

”When the department first proposed a two year course for normalites 
they stopped hundreds of girls from training. We are just recovering now 
and my guess is we are heading for a surplus.” 

“Not if the A.T.A. Magazine is a type of advertising.” 

‘•Many reasons have been put forth for the teacher shortage but none 
of them in my opinion were responsible. First and foremost is the one put 
forth by the Teaching Profession that sslaries are to low in comparison 
to that paid to other professions. They put themselves in the same catagory 
as doctors etc. There is no comparison in the time and cost before one can 
enter his profession and begin to earn one ! s livelihood. Under our present 
system of training teachers, which I consider quite satisfactory, a student 
after receiving eight months normal training can enter his profession and 
thereby earn sufficient money to continue his training either by attending

Summer School or by getting a leave of absence and taking it a year at 
a time* This is the only worth while profession that I know of in 
which this can be done. 

CLAUSE B. is also given as a reason. It is true that the rural 
areas are without teachers, but this is because there simply is not 
enough teachers to go around. 

CLAUSE L used to be one of the main reasons for teachers dropping 
out of the profession but it is not so any longer. Young married teachers 
continue in their profession and usually because their husbands are not 
earning sufficient to provide them with apparel equal to their profes¬ 
sion. 


CLAUSE M has been, is any always will be and I for one would not 
have it otherwise. Were it otherwise many other worth while professions 
like the medical profession would suffer to a greater extent than the 
Teaching Profession. It is quite essential it remain a stepping stone 
whereby energetic young men and can find a way to help themselves climb 
the ladder of success." 

'‘Higher salarys and better living conditions in rural arieas 
would attract more to proffesion.” 

'‘Teaching profession isn't shown in proper light. Why aren't pupils 
in Grades X XI XII properly screened and advised towards future employment?.” 

"Teachers should go into profession because they love teaching." 

"We have no serious teacher shortage, we pay good salaries. Our schools 
are well equipped and are kept bright and clean. Teacherages are quite warm, 
convenient and well furnished. We try to be courteous and agreeable with 
thegi.” 

"Present salary rates will soon see an end to the shortage.” 

"Parents criticism and interferrence. "Tounge wagging.” " 

"Teachers run down the conditions to keep the shortage for their own 
ends." 

”1 think that one of the greatest reasons for our teacher shortage is 
the fact that our present teachers claim that they are not treated fairly 
and do very little to encourage our high school students to go into the 
profession.”

Comments on Question Twenty-four continued 


"This is difficult to decide. Vxe have had teachers with some Univer¬ 
sity training, some with two degrees, who were not good teachers - it is 
quite probable that some of them were not worth any more to us teachers 
than they were before they took this training. These are exceptions of 
course.” 

"toith a 200.00 incree^se in the basic a teacher would get an extra 
lOOoCO in the increment which would equal 300.C0 for a year experience." 

"I don't feel that school boards can pay more under present govt 
regulations and tax receipts with basic maximums as high. More screening 
would have to be done to take the risk of over encouraging University 
training." 

"I believe that most schedules now provide reasonably good increments 
and in many case much fairer to teacher than to many taxpayers." 

"Any further increase would tend to have the teachers take the year 
of training for the sole purpose of raise in salary." 

"There is a direct ratio between per capita income, per capita retail 
sales and the employment of University trained teacners. The better trained 
teachers a community employees the higher is the income and retail sales in 
that community." 

"I consider that #200 sufficient increment for an additional year 
of university training for the reason that the one so doing is providing 
himself with insurance against the time when training is going to be the 
deciding factor in the retension of his services. Also it is an invest¬ 
ment which will pay substancial cash dividends." 

"I would pay this high increment provided the teacher has proved 
himself or herself." 

"It takes more than additional schooling to make a better teacher. 
Perhaps teachers are born and not made." 

"hot knowing average length of teaching years this is only a guess. 

At $200 over a period of sixteen years could figure on 12 ^% on invest¬ 
ment. " 

"Pay the increments when a degree is obtained only." 

"More could be added for experience which is just as valuable as 
added training,"

"Too much money for very doubtful help to young teacher with what 
she or he usually has to teach, unless some special course has been 
taken for the infants classes 1-2-3." 

"Only when the teacher applies that training in most cases they 
do not work longer nours." 


Comments on Question Twenty-five 

"As Trustee and parent of young teacher am well aware of conditions 
under which many teachers are forced to live, and feel it is the duty of 
all boards to provide its staff with adequate living facilities." 

"Opinion expressed above - A teacher is not only a means to the 
end, but very much a human being of considerable value and should be 
appreciated as such. Give him or her the best your pocket book can afford 
in salary, housing, social life and the teacher's shortage in time, will 
disappear." 

"Teachers are such rugged individualists that they hate to live 
with other teachers, want privacy from shop talk and if it is provided 
think it should be better and free, lyhy should the teaching profession 
be singled out to have special concessions? If its a problem - yess. If 
obtainable in town, village or district let them be independent and get 
out of the ivory tower." 

if a man teacher can not go to a strange town and find a 
place to live, is he able to teach students how to look out for themselves." 

"... the present race of people are losing their sense of personal 
responsibility." 

"(No) But we do so to get teachers." 

"Yes, in rural schools only. In urban scnools housing accomodation 
is usually found without much difficulty." 

"Just a practical obligation. If housing not available, a district 
doesn’t have as much choice."

"Teacherages should be provided* The teachers should of course 
pay rent sufficient to meet costs and upkeep, the costs being spread 
say over a period of say ten to fifteen years, M 

"Yes, if no other accomidation is available." 

"Give us permanent teachers and we should give them permanent 
housing*" 

"A teacher has every right to expect a home in every sense of the 
word, in any community comparable to the best* This should include all 
the comforts and conveniences common to that community*" 

"I consider it the Board’s responsibility to provide adequate 
housing in the rural areas only. My reason for this is that should a 
teacher be force to build his own residence and then for some reason 
be forced to leave the district there would be little opportunity 
to sell the property; whereas in the urban areas houses are always 
in demand and tne chance of selling at a profit is always good*" 

"If I were a teacher I would not live in some of the teacherages 
we have in our division* If I were a A.T.A. official I would put good 
living conditions ahead of large salaries. As a trustee I am trying to 
improve living conditions." 

"I believe a teacher should be free to choose his own home and 
build to suit his own taste. He should be an individual to stand on his 
own feet and not administered for by a paternal Board* Give him adequate 
salary and security of tenure* Incidentally, our Board does supply 
nousing (ranging from $1000. to $6000. ) but I do not consider it a 
"moral obligation’**" 

"Employers don’t build homes for stenogs’ clerks etcl so why should 
School Boards be required to build homes for transient labor*" 

"In rural districts a teacher especially a young girl should not 
be expected to board in a cold uncomfortable place, with uncongenial 
people*" 

"All country schools should have adequate living accomodation for 
teachers, and modern conveniences if possible (or at least the same 
accomodation that the rest of the Community have in the district she or 
he has to teach in) In Cities and Towns housing accomodation should be 
supplied if conditions are such t at housing (citizen) are s..ort,"

areas, it is more necessary*' 1 

"Only for rural schools and in small villages. Teachers are get¬ 
ting enough to arrange for own houses in Towns and Cities*" 

"Very desirable but impossible." 

"In periods of serious housing shortage - yes! Teacherages should 
be built only in cases of necessity e.g. rural areas. Teachers should be 
paid high enough to build or rent as they please." 

"See no reason for preferential treatment*" 

"But for Principals and Higher paid teachers no tney should own there 
own home and live as any other citizen." 

"i would like to answer yes to the above question, but find from 
our experience here, that many our teacherages are now empty - teachers. 
in nearly all cases prefer to pay for their board. When teacher's salaries 
were low, teacherages were always used."

dull and uninteresting. In my own opinion the children who have had the

Comments on Question Twenty-seven 

"it seems natural for young people to get out and see the world, 
therefore very few remain in the district where trained, therefore results 
of training benefit prov. as whole so should pay." 

"How can one but any percentage here for the Province. Every child 
should have an opportunity to take such courses if he wants to and is capable 
of benefiting by them. Divisions are far from being equal in their ability 
to provide such services." 

"Divisions which are trying to centralize are hard pressed financial¬ 
ly on building and transportation funds, therefore have little funds left 
for above." 

"I don't believe in giving everybody everything. Although my figure 
is a guess I would suggest tuition should cover part of the expense." 

"The Prov. Schools of Agriculture plan for above seems to be satis¬ 
factory."

"This they do at present as to tools and teachers salaries and 
that seems fair to me, however there remains the cost of building and 
it would seem to me that the Province should carry 25 or 30 $ of this 
capital outlay#" 

"These are special branches and the costs should be borne by the 
individual#" 

"These are really Recreation for these pupils and although profit¬ 
able to the students are not education in the strict sense, but very 
profitable to the Province and to the parents#" 

"I think home Economics and Industrial Arts are very, very important#" 

"Equalization grants which actually equalize should be paid by

so."

"Overhead lighting on newer types should lessen eye strain." 

"#*.sand table too close to stove, boys cloak room too small, should 
be an outside door in girls cloak room, passage between teachers desk and 
sand table is shown to narrower than a pupils desk which is too small# 
Boys cloak room has no direct outside lighting and with a door in each 
wall creates what may be termed cross traffic in four directions, tending 
towards confusion#"

“Put heater in basement and connect to pipeless furnace. Put cloak

white and pastel paint.” 

“Why not use black shalk and white board in all rural schools where 
there is no artificial lighting. It could also be used in most other 
schools After all, you write on wnite paper not on black. Why don't 
people realize that a blackboard makes a room dark? Who would have one 
black wall in a room in his home?.” 

"Can be correctly calculated - I doh't know.” 

"Boys cloak room too small and apt to be dangerously crowded 
at top of basement stairway.” 

"Stove located near stair and hall bad for safety.” 

"Room perhaps too dark.” 

"The cloak rooms should have a hall between so girls do not have 
to go through boys cloak room.” 

"There should be more than one exit.” 

"In connection with this item I might say I wish that that all 
our school buildings compared favorably with this one. There might be 
some roon for criticism; first. The interior decorating scheme is a 
little depressing 2nd, Fire hazard depends on whether the heating 
system is in the basement.” 

"Every school should have an office or some such with couch and easy 
chair for pupils who take ill in school especially where vans are used." 

"...only one exit in case of fire and right tnrough main danger zone." 

"Windows preferably on east side." 

”1 do not like oiled floors in time they get soaked with oil and if 
a child falls down or sits on the floor its cloths get very dirty. And the 
trimmings might nave been of a lighter shade.”

Comments on Question Twenty-nine 

“This matter should be discussed by tue Board. There's much room 
for improvement." 

"Tf one were to cnoose the most important T would still cnoose (d) 
yet some others are very important too, and co-related, as E,H and N, if 
one is taught then all three should be of equal importance or nearly so. 

M is very important too, and the 0 is commendable it is so easily over¬ 
done. We see all around us so many with little experience that are just 
a little too sure of themselves. I is very important too, but whether 
it should be placed before or just after certain others of importance 
is difficult to say, if we take the view that education without health 
has but little value tnen it will come near the top. The last eight 
words of L are properly more the work of the school but the preceding is more 
the duty of the home and church. I would delete" means of many clubs" in G 
as it would have a tendency to counteract “Sense of World Brotherhood" in K." 

"Questionaires usually can be answered in different ways." 

""Teach him while your lessons last. To judge the present by the past" 
Rokeby-Scott." 

"This academic standing is stressed too high. I think the high school 
now learn smattering of things, they never need. I marked the ones with an 
X that I consider should be the aim of education, spelling, arithmetic 
and reading are not nearly as well done as in the past." 

"Course should be flexable. High school pupils should get something on 
the social responsibilities they should have. How to be a good mother or 
a good father would not be out of place judging by the broken homes we have 
in this day and age."

future training according to their ability and wishes* Govt* to build and 
maintain necessary schools; and where necessary profive funds for child 
to attend. At present we loose at least 50# of high School pupils be¬ 
cause we have nothing to offer that shows any hope for future and many 
of those who go ahead enter positions that are not suitable*" 

"The last No* 29 depends somewhat on what we wish to do in life or 
what our vocation might be, but some are important in all vocations such 
as for instance (E) (I) (L) (D) etc. after all if we can be educated
