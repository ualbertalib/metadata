CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of this investigation is to determine if there is 
a selective principle in our so-called universal secondary education. 
The major problems involved are the following: 

1) Prom what occupational groups do high school students come 
and how does the proportion vary from occupation to occupation? 

11) What electives do children from the different occupational 
groups choose? 

Ill) Is a pupil's choice of subjects determined by the A, R or 
C standing obtained in Grade IX? Does the economic status of the par¬ 
ents influence a pupil's choice of electives? 

IV) How many pupils from the different occupational groups 
stated their intentions of going to University? Of attending Normal 
School? 

V) In what occupational groups did students answering the 
questionnaire state that they hoped to go to Normal? Prom which groups 
do we expect to find, in the next four years, the future teachers of 
Alberta? 

The answers to these problems will be found in the following 

chapters. 

First, it is pertinent to deal briefly with the nature of the 
courses offered in the Alberta high schools. 

The Secondary School Curriculum 

The second revision of the secondary-school curriculum for the 
Province of Alberta was completed in 1939. This revised program of 
studies for the high school includes a greater diversity of curricular

opportunity and is designed to meet the needs of all adolescent hoys 
and girls, who "vary greatly in capacity, aptitudes and interests." 

The program does "not require all students to take the same 
subjects of instruction or to attain the same standards of achieve¬ 
ment." In the first year there are only three compulsory subjects; 
namely, English, Social Studies, and Health and Physical Education. 

In the second and third years there are only two compulsory subjects, 
English and Social Studies. The student is therefore free to choose 
in any school from all of the subjects of instruction which are avail¬ 
able. There is no mark of prestige attached to any particular selec¬ 
tion of subjects. All students who complete the program are entitled 
to the same High School Diploma. 

Departmental examinations are given only at the conclusion 
of the students’ high school program and then only in the compulsory 
subjects, English and Social Studies, and in certain other subjects 
which are required for admission to the University. 

Many types of activity which formerly were considered as 
extra-curricular are now incorporated in the classroom program; for 
example, activities in Dramatics, Music, Journalism and Physical Edu¬ 
cation. 

High school entrance: Students who proceed to Grade X work 
are required to have complete Grade IX standing, and to have been pro¬ 
moted to Grade X by the High School Entrance Examination Board. The 
Grade IX Diploma (Grade A, B, or C) is evidence of such promotion.^ 

The following schedule governs promotion from Grade IX to the 
high school: 

Grade A: 60 $ or over; unconditioned promotion.

Grade B: 45$ - 60$; restricted promotion. Pupils may not elect more 
than two subjects from (l) Algebra or Geometry; (2) Physics 
or Chemistry; (3) Latin, French or German. 

Grade C; 30$ - 45$; conditional promotion. Pupils may not take any 
of the following: Algebra, Geometry, Physics, French or 
German. 

Grade D: Under 30$; failure. Pupils must repeat Grade IX course. 

After the successful completion of .three years of the new 
revised program for high schools in Alberta, the student receives a 
High School Diploma. This diploma is a complete record of the student’s 
work: a complete list of all subjects taken, with the number of cre¬ 
dits and the letter grading obtained in each subject. One hundred 
high school credits are the minimum requirement for the High School 
Diploma and must include the following: 

n (l) 33 credits for the compulsory subjects: English 1, 2,3, 
Social Studies 1, 2, 3, and Health and Physical Education 1. 

(II) At least 14 credits for subjects of the third year, with 
credits for English 3 and Social Studies 3 included. 

(ill) At least 50 credits, with 14 abovementioned included, for 
subjects of second and third years. 

(IV) At least 12 credits for Commercial, Technical and General 
electives of the first and second years. 

To be accepted by the Alberta Normal Schools, the High School 
Diploma must include at least 100 credits, with credits for General 
Mathematics 1 and General Science 1 excluded and with r, B M standing at 
least in the following subjects:

The above subjects are listed as they were at the date of October 31, 

1941, the date on which this investigation was started. 

The general requirements for Matriculation, as of October 31, 

1941, were as follows; 

(I) English 3 (IV) Algebra 2 

(II) Social Studies 3 (V) Geometry 2 and Trigonometry 

(III) A third unit of a foreign language (VI) Physics 2 

(French, Latin or German) (VII) Chemistry 2 

Different faculties of the University of Alberta make slightly different 
Matriculation demands. 

It is interesting to see how students coming from the various 
occupational groups react to this new revised program. 

A child's choice of options is limited by - 

i) his individual preference 

ii) standing obtained in Grade IX 

iii) 105 credits necessary to obtain Grade XII diploma 

iv) availability of options in the high schools. 

The schools in Edmonton may be classified as follows; 

1. Academic high schools, where only the general options are taught; 


Victoria High School 


Eastwood High School 


Strathcona High School 


Westglen High School

2. Composite high school, where general and commercial options are 

taught: Strathcona Composite High School 

3. Technical High School, where all the technical options are taught. 

4. McDougall Commercial High School, where all the commercial options 
are taught. 

There are three reasons why all these options are not available 
in all the high schools;in Edmonton; 

1. The teachers are not qualified to teach these options. 

2. School buildings are not properly equipped for the teaching of them. 

3. There is not sufficient money available to provide for them. 

Data with respect to the occupational groups were acquired from 
questionnaires sent to the Edmonton high schools, October 31, 1941. A 
notice of the investigation, accompanied by a questionnaire and a letter 
of explanation, was sent to each high school teacher in Edmonton, be¬ 
fore October 31, 1941. The children were not required to give their 
names, in order to avoid any embarrassment concerning home conditions 
and economic status. A copy of the questionnaire and instructions to 
the teachers is included at the end of this chapter. Figures taken 
from the Dominion Census, 1936, corroborate the findings in this report. 

In the classification of occupations in the questionnaire, 
twenty occupations were included. These twenty occupations have 
been reorganized into ten occupational groupings. 

Occupational Group Numbers 
1 and 3; Managers and Proprietors 

(Numbers 1, Proprietors, and 3, Managers, were combined 
into one occupational group.) 

2: Professional men 

4 and 5; Clerical and Commercial Service

(The following numbers were combined: 7, Artisan-Proprie¬

trades in manufacturing and mechanical industries.) 
Transportation Service 
Public and Personal Service 
Miners, fishermen, loggers 
Laborers 

Unclassified (retired, deceased, questions unanswered) 


Gainful Occupation 

In the Dominion Census, 1936, gainful occupation is defined 
as follows: 

"In census usage, a gainful occupation is one by which the person 
who pursues it earns money or in which he assists in the production 
of marketable goods. Persons unemployed at the census date who have 
previously been gainfully employed are included among the population 
with gainful occupation, if they are seeking employment on that date." 

Therefore in our estimates the numbers on relief in each occupational 

group have been included with the number gainfully employed. 

Occupational vs. Industrial Classification 
In the tables classifying the gainfully occupied by (a) oc¬ 
cupation and (t) industry, the terminology used to describe the groups 
of divisions into which the occupations or industries have been ar¬ 
ranged is much the same, although the meaning is somewhat different. 

The group "Manufacturing* 1 , for example, in an occupation table includes 
all persons following so-called "processing*’ occupations (that is, 
directly engaged in the process of manufacture and repair), irrespective

of whether they are employed by manufacturing firms or by mining, con¬ 
struction, transportation, etc. industries. On the other hand, in sin 
industry table, the group "Manufacturing” includes only such persons 
in processing occupations as are employed by manufacturing firms. It 
also contains, however, all persons in commercial, transportation, 
clerical and other occupations that are found in the manufacturing 
industries. A distribution of the gainfully occupied by occupations 
is given in Table I, page/£,.

CHAPTER II 

PARENTAL OCCUPATION AND TOTAL ENROLMENT 
The writer has attempted to determine whether equal educational 
opportunities are available to all children of high school age in Edmonton. 
Problem 1: From each occupational group, what -percentage of children of 
high school age attends hi^h school in Edmonton ? 

The data relating to Problem I are found in Table I. 

The occupation of the father does influence a child's chance of 
going to high school in Edmonton. Children of professional men have a 
much greater chance of attending high school than have the children of 


unskilled laborers.

Figure 1.- Showing the pupils of high school age, and the pupils of high 
school age in high school in Edmonton, hy occupational 
groups. 

Thus, the children whose fathers are in Group 4 and 5 (Clerical 
and Commercial Service) have an 87* chance of attending high school; 
children of men in Group 7-11 (Trade and Industry) have an 82# chance; 
children of Group 12 (Transportation Service) have a 77c chance; children 
of Group 13 - 14 (Public and Personal Service) have an 81% chance; 
children of Group 15 (Miners) have an 80 r 4 chance; children of Group 16

(unskilled laborers) have a 21$ chance. 

The percentages of children of high school age in high school in 
Edmonton from each occupational group show that children of parents in 
the unskilled occupations do not have educational opportunities equal to 
those of children of parents in other groups. 

Problem 2: How is each occupational group represented in the total 

high school population ? 

The data relating to Problem 2 are in Table II.

* The number of children in high school in Edmonton as 
of October 31, 1941. 

15.8$ of our high school population comes from group number 4 
and 5 (Commercial and Clerical Service). Group 7-11 (Skilled trades¬ 
men) has the next largest representation in high school with 15.5$. 
Group 16 (laborers) has the lowest representation, with 2.9$. It is 
obvious that there is a close relation between parental occupation and 
the privileges of secondary education.

CHAPTER III 

PARENTAL OCCUPATION AND THE COURSE OF STUDY 
The Alberta high schools offer a large number of options from 
which a student may select his course. All students are required to take 
English 1, 2 and 3, Social Studies 1, 2 and 3, and Physical Education 1. 
These three subjects comprise about 33# of the total high school pro¬ 
gram completed by any one student. The remaining 67# may be chosen from 
a list of approximately SO courses in Music, Art, Dramatics, Stenography, 
Woodwork, Mathematics, Science, Foreign Languages find other subjects. 
Problem 3; What is the selection of options by pupils from the various 
occupational groups in Edmonton ? 

Data relating to Problem 3 are to be found in Table III. Of the options 
chosen, 39.9# are academic, 20.6# are general, 8.3# are commercial, 2.10# 
are technical and 1.3# are home economic.

The remaining 1.3$ consists of home economic subjects. 

The student's choice of subjects is influenced by the following 
considerations: 

1) Preference of the individual; 

2) Standing of student in Grade IX; 

3) Curriculum requirements (100 credits are necessary to complete 
high school); 

4) Availability of the courses in the Edmonton high schools (Cf. Page 4.). 

The percentages show that 46.7$ of the subjects taken by children of 
professional men, 42.6$ of the subjects taken by the children of business 
managers and proprietors, 40.4$ of those taken by farmers' children and 
30.4$ of the subjects taken by laborers' children are academic. These 
figures show that except for children of laborers, children of the occupa¬ 
tional groups still chose the greater percentage of their electives from 
the academic subjects. 

Children of laborers chose 19.3$ of their subjects from commercial, 
technical and home economic options, a much lower percentage than to be 
expected. The children from Croup 7-11, skilled tradesmen, chose 14.6$ 
from these options, children of men employed in public and personal ser¬ 
vice chose 13.8$ and children of profess! onal men chose 7.3$. 

No matter how the 67 units of credit are chosen from the optional 
subjects they lead to the same certificate, the High School Diploma. 

There are no special certificates in commercial subjects, in technical sub¬ 
jects or in matriculation subjects. All students who obtain 100 credits 
qualify for the same High School Diploma. But pupils still chose the 
academic subjects in preference to the new electives offered. 

The occupation of the father does influence a pupil's choice of 
subjects. Children of highly trained men take most of their options from

the academic electives and children of unskilled laborers take less op¬

'The standing of a pupil does determine his choice of electives. 
The pupils that were graded "A” chose more academic electives than the 
pupils of lower grades. The pupils with standing lower than ”A" chose 
fewer academic electives and more commercial, technical and home economic 
options than those with “A" standing. The lower the standing, the 

v 

greater the probability that the pupil will choose a more practical cur¬ 
riculum, a curriculum that will serve as a ’’terminal point” in his educa¬ 
tion and prepare him for wage earning.

61.0% of the children of professional men in high schools are 
"A” students, 29.8% are "B" students, 8.3% are "C” students and 0.9% 
did not state their grading. Of the children of business managers 
and proprietors, 54.6% are "A" students, 32.6% are "B" students and 
11.0% are ”0” students. 1.8% did not state their standing. Of the 
children af unskilled laborers, 34.0% are "A" students, 37.5% are 
"B" students and 28.4% are "C" students. 

Conclusion: The social inheritance of a child influences his progress 
in school and the children of unskilled and untrained men have either 
less ability or less ambition than the children of parents who have 
taken advantage of an education.

CHAPTER IV 

PARENTAL OCCUPATION AND EXPECTATIONS FOLLOWING GRADUATION 

Does a relationship exist between the occupation of a father 
and his child’s prospects for the future. 

Problem 6: Is there a relation between parental occupation and a pupil*g 
prospects following graduation from high school? 

Data concerning this question follow in Table X. They were obtained from 
questions (9) and (10) in the ijuestionnaire. (Question (9): Do you ex¬ 
pect to go to University?” Question (10): To Normal School?”)

Of the 931 students stating their intentions of attending iniver-

154, or 16.6$, are the children of professional men, 71, or 7.5$, are the 
children of farmers, and 15, or 1.6$, are the children of common laborers. 

The probable significance of these findings is as follows: 

Children in the higher income brackets know that their parents can pay for 
their university education for them. Men in Croup 1 and 3 may not have had 
a university education and probably want their children to have a better 
education thanthey have had. Children of men in Group 16, on the other 
hand, know that they cannot expect any financial aid from their parents.

Unless, then, the latter are possessed of an urgent personal ambition, 
they will take it for granted that it will not be possible for them to 
attend university.

244 students in the Edmonton high schools stated their intentions 
of attending normal school. Of these — 

87, or 35.6$, are the children of farmers, 

29, or 11.9$, are the children of skilled tradesmen, 

14, or 5.7$, are the children of professional men, 

8, or 3.2$, are the children of unskilled laborers. 

A probable reason for the preponderance of farmers’ children is 
that farmers want their children to obtain the type of education which will 
be most remunerative. Another reason for this figure's being somefchat out of 


line is that 287 children of farmers come from out of town to attend high school.

Data concerning this problem follow, in Tables XIII, XIV, and XV. The 
higher the standing of a pupil in Grade IX, the more optimistic he is con¬ 
cerning his chances of attending university. 

42.8$ of the "A" students plan to go to university, 6.8i to 
normal school. 22.1$ of the "B" students plan to go to university and 
9.9$ plan to go to normal school. Of the "C" students, 9.6$ plan to

Of the 70 children of farmers planning to attend university, 44 
are M A" students, 24 are «B M students, 2 are M C" students. The number 
of farmers' children planning to attend university is large because it 
includes the children of farmers living outside Edmonton.

CHAPTER V 

A COMPARISON WITH A PARALLEL SURVEY MADE IN THE 
CARDSTON INSPECTORATE 

In November, 1941, a parallel Investigation was undertaken in 
the CardBton inspectorate by A. B. Evenson. 

Three of his tables including his conclusions, follow. 

ECONOMIC STATUS OF PARENTS AND ITS INFLUENCE ON POST¬ 
GRADUATION PLANS OF STUDENTS 

Part I : Economic status of parents, based on ownership of business and 
home, and its influence on post-graduation plans of students.^

The above table is a complete summary. All students from Grades 
IX, X, XI, and XII are included. From the information given we can draw 
the following conclusions: 

1. The higher the economic status of parents, the greater is the 
percentage of students going to university. 

2. The higher the economic status of parents the greater is the 
percentage of students going to normal school. 

3. As the economic status of the parents decreases, the percentage

of students not going to either university or normal school increases. 
Part II : Economic status of parents, based on Inco.e Tax. life insurance 
and ownership of motor car, and its influence upon the students 
post-graduation plans. 1

There are at least two definite conclusions that we might draw 
from Table XVI: 

1. The higher the economic status of parents, the greater is the 
percentage of students going to university. 

2. As the economic status of parents decreases, the percentage of 
students not going to either university or normal school increases 

Part III : Economic status of narents, based on the number of convenience 

found in the home, and its influence on post-graduation plans

of the students.

After an examination of Table XVIII, we might conclude as follows: 

1. The higher the economic status of parents, the greater is the ner- 
centage of students going to university. 

2. As the economic status of parents decreases, the percentage of students 
not going to either university or normal school increases. 


I should like to compare Mr. Evanson's conclusions with the 
parallel findings in this investigation: 

Mr. Svenson* s conclusions Results from the survey in Edmonton 


1. The greater proportion of all stu- 1. 
dents (about 63%) in Grades IX, X, 

XI, XII in the Cardston Inspectorate 
have parents or guardians that belong 
to the Agricultural Service. 

2. The vocational group that has he 2. 

greatest percentage of students- 

elect to attend university is the 
professional group. 


3. Normal school training is about 3. 

40& less popular than university 
training for the students in this 

area. 


10.W of the high school students in 
Edmonton have parents that belong to 
occupational group 6,or farmers (cf. 
page \? ). 

The occupational group that has the great¬ 
est percentage of its students plan to at¬ 
tend university is group 1 and 3 (business 
managers and proprietors). 24.9^ of the 
children planning to attend university are 
from this group (cf. page ). 

Normal school is 22.5$ less popular than 
university training (cf. nage34 ).

Mr. Even8on t 8 conclusions 

4. Most of the students who elect normal 4. 
school training come from the Agricul¬ 
tural group. However, this report 

shows the Labor Group to have the 
greatest percentage of its students 
elect this type of training. Only 
a slight difference exists, however, 
over certain other groups. 

5. The higher the economic status of the 5. 
parents, the greater is the tendency 

for students to plan on education above 
the secondary level. 

6. Also, the higher the standing obtained 6. 
on the Grade IX examinations, the 
greater is the tendency for students 

to elect university training rather 
than normal school training. 


Results from the survey in Ed mon ton 

35.6$ of the pupils planning to attend 
normal school come from Group 6; i.e. 
farmers, (cf. page 3*-). 


The higher the economic status of the 
parents, the greater is the tendency for 
students to plan to go to university 
rather than to normal school (cf. Figure 

page^f ). 

Of the "A” students in the Edmonton high 
schools, 42.8$ plan to attend university 
and 6.8$ plan to attend normal school. 
The tendency is for students of greater 
ability to plan to go to university.

CHAPTER VI 

CONCLUSIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS 

There is a selective principle in secondary education today. 

There are equal educational opportunities only for those students who 
can afford to take advantage of them. 

1. Parental occupation does determine a child's cr.ance of going 
to high school (cf. page25*). The child of a laborer has less chance of 
going to high school than the child of a professional man. 

2. The representation from the occupational group in thfe high 
school population of Edmonton is as follows: 

46.6$ of our high school population comes from Croup 1 and 3, 
"business managers and proprietors; Croup 4 and 5, clerical and comnercial 
service; and Group 7-11, trade and industry. 2.9$ comes from Croup 16, 
laborers. 

3. Parental occupation does influence a child's choice of subjects 
(cf. Table II, page i 5" ). 

Children of professional men chose 46.7$ of their subjects from 
the academic electives, and 7.3$ from commercial, technical and home 
economic electives. Children of laborers chose 30.4$ of their subjects 
from academic electives and 19.3$ from commercial, technical and home 
economic electives. 

4. The standing a student obtains from Grade IX does determine 
his choice of options (cf. page 2 . 0 , Table V).

5. There is a close relationship existing between the occupation 
of a father and the child's standing obtained in Grade IX (cf. Table VII 
page XX ). 

61.0$ of the children of professional men are "A" students, 

29.8$ are "B" students, 8.3$ are "C" students. 

34.0$ of the children of laborers are "A" students, 37.5$ are 
"B" students, 28.4$ are "C" students.

CHAPTER VII 
COMMENTS 

There is a selective principle in our secondary educational system 
in Alberta, Children of poor parents in Edmonton need financial aid in 
order to go to high school. 

1. 1. In this democratic country, all children of ability and initiative 

should have the opportunity of taking advantage of at least a Grade XI r 
education. Therefore there is need for a scholarship system to help 
deserving, capable students to attend and finish high school. 

2. 'There are still too many children taking academic options and too 
few taking advantage of the general, commercial, technical and home eco¬ 
nomic options. Te must educate the public to the fact that there is not 
a stigma attached to the general, commercial, technical or home economic 
options, and that a pupil taking academic options is not necessarily edu¬ 
cated or of superior intelligence. The second revised curriculum of high 
schools in Alberta has made the High School Diploma for Trade XII the same 
for all pupils regardless of the options selected. In September, 1942, 
the University of Alberta will accept a Grade XII Diploma as matriculation 
requirement. It is hoped this will influence pupils to elect more of the 
general, commercial, technical and home economic bptions. 

3. If the parents realized that a Grade XII education does increase a 
child's ability to earn a living, they would be more interested in the 
matter of where their taxes go, and the appropriations made by the Govern¬ 
ment for education. 

4. Relatively few children of parents with a low economic status have 
plans for attending university or normal school, whereas children of parents 
with a high economic status usually plan to go to university. Has the 
child of inferior ability whose parents have a high economic status greater

educational opportunities than the child of superior ability whose parents 
are poor and needy? If this is the situation, it may be we are shutting out 
the more able students. Are we maintaining for the children of the more 
favored classes a public institution at the tax-payers expense? 

To insure more reliability in information and more accurate data 
from future questionnaires — 

i) The wording of the questions should be clear, direct, and simple, and 
require definite answers. 

ii) To insure full cooperation of teachers and pupils, notices, instruc¬ 
tions and questionnaires should be sent in advance of the date set 
for the answering of the questionnaires, 

iii) If the cooperation of the parents could be enlisted, it would be 

preferable to have the questionnaires taken home and where necessary 
filled in by parents. 

iv) By not asking for names on the questionnaires it is believed embar¬ 
rassment for either children or parents is avoided, and it is believed 
that parents may be more willing to give accurate information, 

v) The logical time to undertake an investigation where figures from the 
densus are required is directly after the Federal Census has been 
published. Then the figures from the census should corroborate the 
findings of the investigation more accurately.
