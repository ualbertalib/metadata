CHAPTER I 


I TRuDUCTIQli. 


Three causes led to the writing of a thesis on 
the above topic. The first is a l^ng-standing personal 
conviction that the average high school graduate has 
a very meag e coneoption of th correct use o~ his 
native language. How are his fellow-citizens to 
recognize an "educated” man by more or less casual 
contact if his speech and writing reflect little 
formal training in the niceties of speech? Business 
and professional people base first impressions 
largely on hew a man loons and whai he says— 
impressions which may have far-reaching effects 
on his future. 

The above-mentioned conviction that s.me- 
thing should be done about the indifferent knowledge 
of English among our students was strengthened by the 
moans of many High School teachers. On all sides a- 
rose the cry: "But how bn earth can we teach them 
any other language when they s.empty do not know their 
own?" Admittedly, tne student must often fail to under¬ 
stand an intiicte point .^.n a foreign language lessen, 
because he cannot grasp the meanings o. th terms 
used,—and the teacher mistakes the look of blank in- 
comprehe sion for one of rapt attention! 

Thirdly, the writer has been in a position to hear 
the comments of the average business man on the spell¬ 
ing, grammar, etc. of most new would-be secretaries.

Without subscribing to the popular conception of the 
"dumb stenographer," one is forced to admit that the 
girl who can type a letter without introducing origin¬ 
al (rather than conventional) grammar, spelling and 
punctuation, is a pearl beyond price in an office. 

We quote from a letter written by the manager 
of a large city office to the principal of the local 
high school: 

"Mr. M#... requested that I write you suggest¬ 
ing the qualifications that are required in a 
stenographer or secretary. 

"First of all-—general intelligence and ability 
to spell, which I might say has come to my 
notice as a frequent failing on the part of 
those coming fresh from school and business 
college. 

"Secondly-—a good knowledge of grammar and 
correct punctuation is necessary. Quite 
frequently those dictating lack adequate 
knowledge of this themselves and therefore 
have to be tactfully corrected by the man¬ 
ner in which the letter is written. 
"Interruptions are often numerous in dic¬ 
tating and without realizing it one will re¬ 
peat a word two and sometimes three times in 
one paragraph, fhe transcriber should skil¬ 
fully avoid this, or at least draw the wri¬ 
ter^ attention to it." 

Having, then, a personal feeling in the matter, 
reinforced by the opinions of those who have the present

•training of our youth and those who will have to do 
with them in future, the writer needed only the 
following incident to launch her enthusiastically upon 
the consideration of an admittedly controversial sub¬ 
ject. After what had apparently been, if not an in¬ 
spired, at least a satisfactory lesson on a French 
verb, the teacher was approached by an earnest but 
bewildered boy. "I can get the French, all right," 
he said, "if I knew that grammar stuff. When did 
you learn all that about *1 walk, thou walkest, he 
walks 1 ? I never heard of it. It had been taken for 
granted that most people knew that sort of thing by 
Grade VIII, but apparently this was not the case. The 
boy was of average intelligence, but completely be¬ 
wildered by terminology, for, after a quick survey of 
Fes on. Number, Tense, etc., he inquired hopefully, 
"Well, is that verb what you call a Superlative*?" 

It was almost, but not quite, as disconcerting 
as an incident in which a bookkeeping pupil insisted 
that she understood all about journalizing and posting, 
but couldn*t see "where all the figures came from"! 


Stenography and French II classes were chosen 
for this investigation because they were the only ones 
available (except for Stenography I and Typing I-- 
inly "skill" subjects) ana because they- night illus¬ 
trate the need for a better understanding of English 
among the students of two classes—those who undertake

the study of foreign language and those who aspire 
to a business career. 

The trend today is away from formal grammar 
towards functional English. This is, of course, a 
reaction against the old-fashioned method of requir¬ 
ing long-suffering pupils to dissect sentences twelve 
lines long, written by Victorian essayists who had 
time to write them for Victorian men and women who 
had tiine to read them. No-one questions the ne¬ 
cessity to break av/ay from dry-as-dust grammar texts 
with lengthy definitions and innumerable examples of 
strange and wonderful constructions. However, is 
there not the danger that education in English may 
become not merely painless but ineffective? The 
modern text-book is a joy and a delight, with its ' 
illustrations from everyday life and speech, but its 
danger may lie in the casualness of its approach. It 
is all very well to correct a young child every time 
he says, "Him and me did it," or "He gave it to she 
and I," but it is not possible, orally or in any text¬ 
book, to present all possible examples of such errors. 
Nor could the mind grasp them if it ?^ere possible. 

The logical student would infinitely prefer to be told 
’"He 1 is nominative case--to be used as a subject; 

1 him* is objective—to be used as object of a verb or 
preposition," and so on. But such rules must be 
taught so thoroughly that the student not only under¬ 
stands but renencers them, and can use them to deter¬ 


mine the usage in all similar cases.

We shall, then, devote some .pages to a con¬ 
sideration of what grammatical training the modern 
pupil has received up to the end of G-rade IX; then con¬ 
sider the two above-mentioned High School courses in 
their relation to the subject of English; and finally 
offer a mere outline of what further grammar might, 
with profit, be presented to the students, and when. 

CHAPTER II 

FO IftAL GRAMMAR BXEORE GRADE IX 
Each teacher will, of course, present the 
Elementary and Junior High School English courses in 
his or her own way. Many teachers consulted (particu¬ 
larly about the Grade VIII level) stated that they 
used their own texts and taught considerably more 
formal grammar than was suggested in the outline. 

The following summary, then, is intended to show, not 
what grammar any individual pupil may expect to have 
been taught in the first eight grades, but the mini¬ 
mum definitely presented in the Programme of Studies 
and texts. 


(A) 

"PROGRAMMA OP STUDIES POR TiiE ^LU: EUTART SCilOOL, 

<£Ui)-g 1 10 6" (1915T 

Throughout, various suggestions such as Compre¬ 
hension Tests offer excellent material for teaching and 
checking upon the primary child l s comprehension of a 
complete thought. However, the fact that many students 
have still failed to grasp this simple concept, by the 
time they are in High School, is shown (below) by the

analysis of errors made by the Stenography £ class. 

Examples of good ideas such as the above are: 
p. 175 Choose the right words to finish these sen¬ 
tences: 

1. First, the miller and his son met 

a group of men 

a group of women 

some women and children. 

£. When they met the group of men, these men 
scolded because 

the boy was riding the donkey 

the boy was walking 

the old man was riding the donkey. 

(From: The Miller, His Son and Their Donkey, Book III, 

p.7) 

A somewhat similar example is the following: 

Find the right words to finish the sentences: 

1. An Indian came to the settler*s cabin.... 

£. When the settler spoke rudely to him, the 
Indian turned away and walked.... 

3. When the settler was lost in the forest, he 
was delighted to come upon.... 

(The Golden Rule, Book III, p. 186) 

In these early grades, it would, of course, be 
useless to attempt to make the children understand the 
functions of the different words; this work is merely 
an attempt to introduce to the child the idea of a 
complete thought. Having thus early been encouraged 
to get the ff feeling ,f of a sentence, the child is pre¬ 
pared for the formal, logical explanation of the ,r why ,f 
of the structure. 

The Comprehension Tests suggested (e. g., 
p. 191) continue the training in thought in whole units

1. Peter Johnson lived in (England, Canada, 
Sweden, Germany, Alaska). 

2. When Peter started out for the city he took 
(four horses, two dollars, seven hens,ten 
silver coins, five pigs). 

3. When Peter traded hoots the first time he 
gave the other man his boots and (five cats, 
a dollar, a belt, a pair of socks, three 
dollars)• 

A little further along in the Programme (p. 197) 
a statement is made which is worthy of comment: ’’Teach 
the pupils to use the rhythmic stress in reciting; 
that is, while keeping the time, to place the stress on 
the word which the thought indicates, running lightly 
over the words which are unimportant in thought. This 
fills the recitation with little runs and trills as in 
music, and makes it much prettier than if the metric 
stress is used.” It also makes the work much more com¬ 
prehensible to the pupil, and gives him some insight 
into the fact that there are some words which give the 
thought, and others which are less important to the 
meaning. 


Since we have taken the liberty of including 

Spelling under the general term of "English” we quote 

the following groups of words which are suggested as 

basic material for spelling (p. 220): 

Child*s name 
Yes—no 
Numbers 1-10 

Names of colours—red, blue, white, black, etc. 

Names of common animals—dog, cat 

Names of common objects at school—a book, the 

chair 

Names of common objects at home—milk, car, etc. 
Names of common objects in nature—tree, sky, etc. 
Adjectives—big, little, good, bad, best, dear, 
cross, long, nice, tall, fat, this, new, old, etc. 
Adverbs—away, back, now, never, soon, early, then, 
etc. 

Phrasal subjects—my mother, our baby, your desk.

their chairs, his pencil, her hook, the old 
man, a little hoy, Mr. Smith, Miss Bell, etc. 
Prepositions in phrases—in the room, on the 
chair, with a hook, into the hox, of the house, 
from the window, hy the chair, up the hill, 
down the hill, etc. 

Sentence beginnings— 

1. With pronouns and verbs "to be” and "to 
have"—I shall, he is, she was, he 
will, I have, it has, we have, you 
are, we were, they have, etc. 

8. With introductory forms— 

There is, there are, there was, there 
were, here is, that is, this is, there 
are, etc. 

3. With verb forms— 

I see, he saw, she went, we came, they 
gave, they went, ran, etc. 

This wall he sufficient to•show that a definite and 


logical programme of spelling is planned for the 
primary student, a suspicion that these forms take 
on groupings, not entirely hy chance, may even he ab¬ 
sorbed at this point. Gates* list (highly scientific, 
based on frequencies) is recommended for other suitable 
material. 


On page ££1 we find, at the end of the discussion 
on Division X, the following Standard of Attainment in 
Language Resulting from Its Use in the Social Activities: 
"Written. 

1. The ability to write correctly from two to four 
sentences, previously spoken about a topic; and a friend¬ 
ly letter in simple but correct form. 

£. The ability to use the correct end marks in written 
sentences: a period, a question mark. 

3. The ability to use capital letters, for names of. 
people; names of places; beginning of sentences;, 
beginning of a line of poetry; names of days of week 
and months, if needed. 

4. The ability to write correctly the most frequently 
occurring words in pupils’ written expression of thought.

The words and phrases included under "Word Study" above 
are considered necessary for written work." 

Sections 2 and 3 above illustrate how early the 
student’s life the concepts of complete sentences, 
periods, question marks and capital letters are intro¬ 
duced. Unfortunately, it would appear that this study 
is abandoned too early, for, although doubtless the 
pupil should be able to retain and adapt his early 
training, the study of errors by students of Stenography 
2 will illustrate that the above standard of attainment 
has not been achieved well on into High School. 

Under the organization of Division II, "A” 

Year, we find an outline of what is planned. Some 
experts, which apply particularly to the subject under 
discussion, are quoted: 

"Oral:* 


The Sentence—Right expression for assertive, 
interrogative, imperative, exclamatory;; use of complete 
sentence when speaking in a meeting, and in answering 
and asking questions. 

The Paragraph—Definition and form; use in giving talks 
and in telling stories. 

Written: 

The Sentence—Forms of the four kinds; use of sub¬ 
ject and predicate to strengthen pupil’s feeling for 
completeness in a sentence. 

Equipment 


Vocabulary—Nouns, common and proper; Christian names 
and surnames; days of week, months; verbs which give 
power and interest to the sentence; number words, 
gender words. 

Mechanics 

Spelling—Teach the technique of learning to spell a 
word; test on the hundred spelling errors, and teach 
words mis-spelled; common nouns; proper nouns; verb 
forms; abbreviations; days, months; Mr. and Mrs .\ 
street, avenue, company; etc.

Capitals—beginning of sentence, lines of verse, proper 
names; titles of stories, books, etc.; names of days, 
months; names of the Deity; pronoun "I". 

Punctuation Marks—Period, interrogation and exclamation 
marks and the punctuation as required for the letter. ,f 

Highly similar outlines are given for the "B" 
and "C" Years of the Division. Many points emerge. It 
is to be noted that practically all punctuation marks 
have been covered, at least to a limited extent, but 
they are far from being mastered. Capitalization is 
stressed (also in the outlines of years "B" and "C" 
not quoted above), but practically all commercial stu¬ 
dents have been found to be deficient in knowledge of 
the rules. 

The parts of speech have been gradually presented, 
as the students approached the age when they could under¬ 
stand their use. However, as an example of the fact 
that the very names are too soon forgotten, the writer 
cites the Grade IX class which, when asked what part 
of speech "between" is, enthusiastically echoed the 
voice which finally responded "Verb.” 

The g expression of assertive, interrogative, 
imperative and exclamatory sentences is stressed as 
early as the "A” year of Division II. However, it has 
been found that .French 2 classes always have to be taught 
and retaught the different moods, and still persist in 
confusing them with tenses, voices, etc. 

With regard to Spelling, an interesting comment 
is made on page 226: "All spelling should be studied 
by the pupil rather than taught by the teacher. Give 
the group a suitable number of instruction lessons on

them to learn the spellings Tor themselves." 

At risk 01 being accused of reactionary tenden¬ 
cies, the writer has a feeling that anything "studied 
by the pupil rather than taught by the teacher’ 1 is 
likely to be neither studied nor taught, human nature 
being what it is. To be sure, the old system of forcing 
every student, good speller or bad, to spend the same 
number of hours on similar lists, regardless of in¬ 
dividual differences, was decidedly not economical. 

A strong feeling exists that it is useless to waste 
the time of High School students on such ,T sissy stuff" 
as spelling, when their maturing intelligences are 
capable of grasping relatively high mathematics, etc. 
Granted—if only they could, or would, spell correctly— 
but they can't, won't or, in any case, don't. 

Among the forms to be taught in Division II 
are given the one hundred words in the spelling of 
which errors are most frequent. Undoubtedly most 
students could spell most of these words by the later 
years of High School, but the forms listed below these 
words are quoted here as an example of what it is hoped 
a student might know by the end of Division II and 
which it would be much appreciated if he knew by the end 
of Grade H: 


"Common nouns to be written with small letters. 

Proper nouns to be written with capitals. 

Verb forms in sets of three: give, gave, given; 
go, went, gone; lie, lay, lain; drive,

(Note: while on the subject of ,f an undue number of mis¬ 
takes” it might be permissible to state that, in 
a very short, very simple letter, given to a com¬ 
mercial class, after a great deal of drill, the 
following points were evident: 

The abbreviation "Messrs.” in six-inch 

letters on the blackboard, was outside 
of the scope of half the class; 

The spelling of "piece” had never been mastered; 

"Superintendent" was too long and too hard a 
word; 

"Principal" and "principle" were confused. 

Is it a case of insufficient training or just plain 
lazinessi)

" JUNIOR ^vS-LISi: ^CIIViTIES ." Book I, by Hatfield, Lewis, 
Thomas, and tfoody, is a fascinating text. Each unit in¬ 
troduces at least one interesting aspect of a student*s 
life—home, school, play, etc. Examples are interesting 
and true to life—by no means pedantic. There are also 
many sections (at the end of each unit) entitled "Review, 
Test and Practice." Of these, the Preface (page vii) says: 
"When a pupil is engrossed in a certain form of language 
expression, such as writing speeches for a dramatization, 
he should not be interrupted by a drill on capitalization or 
punctuation. Such tools of expression are largely individ¬ 
ual matters (Comment: from "individual use of capitals and 
punctuation,'may we be delivered!). They are to be studied 
when the pupil sees a real purpose for their use. There¬ 
fore the mechanics or tools of expression are separated 
from the expressional activities. They are placed in a 
separate section of the ’Review, Test and Practice* division 
at the end of the unit." 

B e low v/e have given the titles only of most of 
the expressional material, and an outline of all the formal 
grammar which appears in the book. This is fine "Review, 
Test and Practice," but there are two points to be noted. 

In the first place, while there'appears to be a great 
deal of grammar when it is listed as below, it actually 
takes up a very small part of the book, 7/hich is devoted

In large part to the lighter and definitely more charm¬ 
ing expressional work. Secondly, the pupils have not the 
background necessary to grasp the points of grammar im¬ 
mediately they are presented; and the teachers simply 
must sacrifice (as many do) some other part of the course 
if they are to explain fully all that underlies these 
grammar reviews. As one teacher consulted remarked: "It's 
just fine to warn the pupils to avoid dangling participles, 
but you have to go back and teach them what a participle 
is—and there*s a third of a period gone.”

It was felt to be worth while studying the "PRO¬ 
GRAMS OP STUDIES FOR THE INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 11 with a view 
to discovering in what direction the study of grammar and 
other aspects of English had been pursued in Grades 7, 8 
and 9. The underlying philosophy will be found in the 
following quotations: 

"Every teacher will therefore be a teacher of Eng¬ 
lish. Neither Literature nor Language can now be regarded 
as compartments that are separate from other parts of the 
programme." (p. 17) 

"The time allotment for English has been reduced to 
the level prevailing for the other major subjects.... 

The burden of proof rests on those who maintain that 
this excess in time allotment for English was Justified 
by results. A large amount of the purely formal class 
instruction was undoubtedly wasted effort. English in 
the new programme will be interwoven with other subjects. 
There will be less time for the formal teaching of Liter¬ 
ature and for formal exercises in Language. There will be 
more time for the expression of the living thought that 
springs from experiences of daily life." (p. 18) 

While being heartily in agreement with the state¬ 
ment that much of the exaggeratedly formal instruction 
in grammar was wasted effort, the writer is still of 
the opinion that, if results justified it, the "over¬ 
learning" of grammar, spelling, etc. would still be 
profitable. In'the field of mathematics, nothing but 
constant drill, drill, drill on the elementary processes 
seems sufficient to produce results. It is not sufficient

to say: "We have taught the pupil to add, subtract, multi¬ 
ply and divide, and shall now insist that he carry this skill 
into all the branches of his life." It is necessary to teach 
the fundamentals over and over again—and even at that the 
students become careless and the cry arises from teachers, 
"They don*t even know how to add two figures." 

In the field of English, of course, the situation 
is somewhat different. The use of the language is a daily, 
fairly continous occurrence, and ample opportunity should 
arise for the perfecting of the forms. But it is probably 
no exaggeration to say that in the vast majority of Wes¬ 
tern Canadian homes the grammar used (especially in the 
matter of agreement of subject and verb, use of nominative 
and objective forms of pronouns, irregular past participles, 
etc.) is most inaccurate. With this bad example behind him, 
the student is forced to look to the school for correction, 
and practically every teacher will agree that, outside of 
English periods, she simply has not time to do more than 
correct (with possibly a word of explanation) the individ¬ 
ual errors made. The student, full of enthusiasm, inquires 
"Can I use this here typewriter?" The harassed teacher 
replies: "You mean, * May I use this typewriter? 1 " The 

pupil willingly acquiesces, and the incident is closed. 

Such correction on the spot is needed, of course, but 
unless it is reinforced by a more thorough grounding in the 
"Y/hy?" of it all, is likely to be ineffectual. 

From page 17 of the Programme of Studies we quote 
again: "The course in English for the Intermediate School

An outline of the grammar content of Book II, " JUNIOR 

PPGLISn .vJlI/xi'IiL.S ," similar to the analysis of Book I, is 

now given. As before, it will be noted that the formal 

English listed seems quite comprehensive, but again it 

must be remarked that it represents a very small part of 

an average-sized book# Also, the remainder of the book is 

most fascinating, and likely to lead the reader astray from 

the paths of grammatical research. (That, in fact, is the 

effect it has on the present writer.)

Part of the Introduction to " AN ENGLISH GRAMMAR 

EOK PUBLIC SJiiQGLS (ALBERTA EDITION ) " by Cowperthwaite # 

Marshall, and Sullivan, is quoted herewith: 

"Tiie notion that grammar can be set aside for 
loose and untechnical ‘language lessons 1 has 
been shortlived. The newer and sounder doctrine 
is that a thorough course in grammar is, after 
all, indispensable to an elementary education. 
Practice in speaking and writing English correct¬ 
ly is, of course, an absolute necessity. Much 
reading of good literature too, is essential. 

But high school teachers, as well as business 
men, insist that students of the ’teen age 
know at least the rudiments of technical 
English grammar. 

"The avoidance of needless particularities and 
of technical puzzles, and the constant approach 
to grammatical formulae by way of concrete 
examples, make this text-book, we believe, an 
effective aid both to the teacher who purposes 
to impart the essentials of grammar intelligent¬ 
ly and successfully and to the student who 
desires to know- something of his Mother tongue." 

With the above statements, especially the one 

about "high school teachers, as well as business men," 

the writer is entirely in accord.

on formal grammar is given below:

CHAPTER III 
STENOGRAPHY II 


This course, following a year's training in the writ¬ 
ing of shorthand outlines, consists largely of the taking of 
letters in shorthand and transcribing them on the typewriter. 
An investigation was necessary into the knowledge of grammar 
possessed by this class. The Pribble McRory test was con¬ 
sidered suitable for such an inquiry, and the students were 
given parts of the test, on entering school in the fall. 

Prom observation and office experience, the writer 
felt that Parts I, II, V, VI and VII (Verbs, Pronouns, Mis¬ 
cellaneous Constructions, Sentence Recognition and Redundancy) 
would test the most frequent errors made by stenographers 
Accordingly, these were the sections on which the Stenography 
II class was tested. 

The results of these tests, together with the marks 
of the students in Stenography II, are given on the following 
pages. An analysis of the errors in the individual items on 
the test was also made, and is presented herewith, only those 
items being included in which several students made errors.

both the Stenography 2 and French 2 classes, a slightly 
more detailed analysis is given in the latter case.)

19 

9 

Subjunctive after a verb of wishing. 

20 

9 

"Lay" vs. "lie." 


Part VI—Sentence Recognition 

9 14 Some discussion arose as to whether the follow¬ 
ing sentence should be considered as 
clear and correct, or should be written 
as two or more separate sentences: 

"Take the street at your right, go three 
blocks, turn again to your right, and then 
stop at the second house." 

The writer is of the opinion that, although 
the directions are clear, the sentence is 
too involved for immediate comprehension. 

15 10 Ambiguous relationship of "seen from a car 
window," due to position of the phrase. 

Part VII—REDUNDANCY 

2 7 "This sort of a" ? instead of "this sort of." 

6 7 "Where we were at." 







46 


The detailed analysis of errors in transcription would serve 
to illustrate perhaps more fully the weaknesses illustrated 
in the last two sections. The writer has found that many 
stenographers, unable to distinguish between a sentence and 
a subordinate clause, begin a new sentence at a point where 
the dictator paused to indicate merely a comma. 

With regard to redundancy, perhaps the most common 
errors (which the employer perpetrates but which the steno¬ 
grapher should correct) are the expression "this here" and 
a sentence such as the following: 

"We find that, taking into consideration all the 
facts which have been put before us, that such a course 
would be eminently suitable."

Correlation between scores in Pribble-MeRory Test 

and Stenography 2—.285 
However, the Pribble-McRory Test was given at least six 
weeks before the above Stenography 2 marks were available. 
The mark in grammar (part of the total English mark) was 
obtained from the English teacher, and correlated with 
the Stenography 2 marks given at the same time. The 
resulting correlation was . 717 .

A thorough investigation was made into the causes 
of loss of narks in transcription. Harks lost, of course, 
correspond to imperfections in typed letters--imperfections 
which are inexcusable in a business office. The following 
pages show the results of the analysis of errors in letters 
used to determine marks throughout the year. The columns 
on the first pages of each individual analysis designate 
the errors which might, with a broad definition of the 
word, come .aider the terra "English." The first three 
columns (Verbs, Pronouns and Sentence Structure) include 
those strictly grammatical errors which seem to abound in 
letters. In a few cases (to be discussed later), de¬ 
liberate errors were introduced, and the students were 
warned to be on the look-out for and to correct them; but 
in most cases the student heard imperfectly or could not 
interpret exactly her shorthand outline, and typed in the 
grammatical construction she, herself, would have used. 

The nexr six columns (Punctuation, Spelling, Apostrophes, 
Abbreviations, Hyphens and Capitals) are covered by 
"English” in the broader sense. "Punctuation," of course, 
excludes those marks. Apostrophes and Hyphens, to which 
individual columns were assigned. 

The columns on the remaining pages of each student’s 
record cover mechanical errors. "Set-up" refers to the 
position of the letter on the page and of the component parts 
with reference to one another. "Typing" includes strike- 
overs (cardinal sins in the typing world), imperfect 
erasures, letters interchanged in a word when the error

is obviously not one of spelling, etc. "Miscellaneous" 
errors may be caused by the student*s falling behind in 
her shorthand notes, interpreting them incorrectly, and so 
on. "Words Missing" and "Words Added" are self—explanatory. 

Following the analysis of errors, a personal data sheet 
for each student is included. The pupil*s own estimate of 
his ability under the various headings has little signifi¬ 
cance from the point of view of actual measurement, but 
is included from the point of view of interest, when compared 
with the student*s actual record.

The official markin . scheme Tor Pitman shorthand tes s 
is shown on the precedin p£ . he underlined items on 
the lower half of the page indicate how important correct 
English is in the transcribing of letters. .hen it is 
realized that a mark of 90 is required for passing (and 
this standard is none coo higi , to insure '’mailable 1 ' 
letters), the tremendous importance of a knowledge of 
formal English may be seen.

Of course, these totals are not comparable, as 
many opportunities for one type of error might occur 
in the letters and very few for another. 

Let us, however, consider those items in which 
many errors were made. "Typing" and "Miscellaneous” 
would both naturally be responsible for a large 
number of mistakes, as they more or less reflect the 
students 1 proficiency in Typing and Shorthand res¬ 
pectively. Actually, they should cause practically 
all the errors. "Words Missing" represents a type 
of error closely allied to the above-mentioned, 
and its large total is partly explained by the 
fact that student Number 3 omitted about half a 
letter on one occasion. 


Particularly significant is the largest total 
of all in our list—"Punctuation." This aggregate

of 233 does not result from insisting upon exact 
conformity with the original copy. In fact, if a 
student had commas, for example, logically placed, 
considerable freedom was allowed. This total re¬ 
sulted from the fact that the students inserted 
commas with more enthusiasm than common sense, 
failed to realize when they had reached the end 
of a sentence, forgot to close quotations, etc. 
This is a. very serious situation . 

"Spelling," too, accounted for the colossal 
total of 168 errors—and this in spite of two 
factors. First, an error was not listed as 
"Spelling" unless it was evidently so, not a 
typing slip. Second, a good dictionary was 
available at all times in both the stenography 
and typing rooms, and the students were advised 
of this fact and encouraged always to look up 
any word of which they were not certain. Proper 
names were carefully spelled out, and their 
dictation did not take up part of the time allowed 
for dictating the letter. (See Pitman rules.) 

We come, then, to this tremendously important 
conclusion: Punctuation and Spelling account for 
a seriously disproportionate number of errors made 
by stenographers; and those items which have been 
classified as "English" accounted for 600 errors 
as opposed to 641 for the items which should, 
strictly speaking, cover practically all of the 
errors made, (and of the 641, 35 were words missing 
from one letter typed fcy one student).

ERRORS DELIBERATELY DICTATED 
In this part of the investigation, the students were 
warned that, for the next week (or possibly two) errors 
in grammar would be dictated, and should be corrected in 
transcription. An attempt was thus made to dictate under 
conditions frequently found in offices,—the employer mak¬ 
ing grammatical errors and counting on the secretary to 
correct them. Great care had to.be exercised, however, 
as part of the training of a stenographer is the exact 
transcribing of her notes, under ordinary circumstances, 
and such an investigation as the one described below 
might tend to encourage the taking of unwarranted lib¬ 
erties with wording. 

The name of the addressee is given in the case of 
each letter; an indication of the type of error; and 
the numbers of the students who failed to correct it. 

Jacobs —letter ending with incomplete sentence: "With 
kindest regards." The modern ruling is that 
"With kindest regards, we remain..." is accept¬ 
able, though not good usage. 

Students failing 

to perceive error: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 (14) 

Strong —" return it to you again " 

12 A5A789 A 11 A A (7) 

Foley —"we would appreciate" 

2 A 4 5 A 7 8 9 A 11 12 13 14 (10) 

Young —"a week T s time" (Note: this could not, of 

course, be actually dictated incorrectly, but 
was considered a sufficiently frequent error 
to merit a place here.)

The number of students who made each individual 
error is given in brackets at the right hand margin of 
the two preceding pages. 

There is no reason to believe that, had this in¬ 
vestigation been carried out over a wider field, the per¬ 
centage of errors would have been any smaller. The in¬ 
tention was to show that common errors, when introduced 
into the body of a letter by the dictator, are faithfully 
reproduced by the average student. The effect on the 
receiver of the letter, who may be no better versed in 
grammar than the writer thereof, but whose personal 
errors are probably different ones, is to give him the 
impression that he is corresponding with a decidedly 
second-rate firm.

It was not possible to treat this subject in the same 
en as II. analysis of errors in tests 

was attempted, but abandc , as it was impossible to tell, 
for ex: , : ' t uch a sentence as W I1 me 

I’ai 1 whether he made the error because he didn’t 

realize the difference between the first person singular 
and the third person singular, in any language, or because 
he didn’t know the French verb "to have." 

The teaching of French had made it abundantly clear to 
the writer that a tremendous amount of grammar is involved. 
Whether it would be better to introduce the subject less 
formally, ir the manner in which a child is taught to speak 
English, at an early age (a plan which is followed in Eng¬ 
land— and the students certainly do know Frenchl) is a moot 
point. The fact remains that the teacher of French (a d 
other foreign languages) is severely handicapped in her 
presentation of parts of speech and especially verbs, with 
their tenses, moods and othe:^ variations, by the colossal 
ignorance of many pupils as to the significance of the 
terms used. Is it the fault of the students that they don’t 
know these things, or were the - expected to "absorb" grammar 
instead of having it "pounded" into them? 

To illustrate the vital necessity for pupils to know at 
the very least the me aniens of grammatical expressions, the 
French II course has been analysed, lesson by lesson, v.ith

As the analysis of the French II course (q. v.) showed 
that very considerable weight was given to verbs and pro¬ 
nouns, these two parts of the test were given to the 
French classes, plus ten Miscellaneous Constructions from 
Part V. 

The results of this test, together with the grammar 
rating given by the teacher of English, and the various 
marks in French II, are given on a following page. Also, 
an analysis of the various items is given. If fewer than 
five students in the class made an error in any particular 
item, it was fairly evident that the problem v/as individual

The correlation between the narks on the Pribble 
L'cBory Grammar Test and the marks in French II on 
October 15 (approximately the seme date as that on 
which the grammar test was *jiven) was .5801. 

One important factor which would tend to make the 
French marks at this time unreliable was that most of 
the boys were absent for a considerable period during 
September, at uilitary camp. This absence would affect 
their French marks (though an attempt at fairness was 


made) -.ore than it would their marks in general grammar 
test, as gr£ mar is a subjec ley nad learne to a 















167. 


The scores in English Grammar, as provided by 
the teacher of English, were correlated with the 
scores in French II, date (December 31), 

as shown on the previous page* The correlation 

obtained . ; s _. Le tests in the two 

subjects were' not parallel, a somewhat similar 

it the school, and this 
result vould probably show some relation between 
student scores in the two subjects.

An experiment with the French II classes was attempted, 
but proved by no means conclusive, for various reasons outlined 
below. Two classes were taught during the year, a morning and an 
afternoon class. As the latter were given a period five minutes 
longer than the former, it was decided to devote this time to 
English grammar and investigate the effect of this extra training 
on the progress of the students in French. Accordingly, an out¬ 
line of a few aspects of verbs and pronouns, with direct reference 
to the French 11 course, was prepared, as shown on the following 
pages, and presented to the afternoon class only. On the basis 
of the October results (made up, for fairness, of the marks in sever¬ 
al small tests) a student of the morning class was selected whose 
mark corresponded almost exactly with that of each student in the 
afternoon class. At Christmas, the marks of these two groups 
of students were compared, in the hope that the extra grammatical 
training might show some significant results, other factors having 
been kept as constant as possible. 

The results, as shown, are not by any means conclusive. In 
the first place, it was not possible to give as much grammar 
training in the odd five minutes as had been hoped. Outside 
events frequently shortened the afternoon period • Also, for 
purposes of the present study, the investigation had to be con¬ 
cluded about the end of January, and most of the intricate French 
grammar, which might have been affected by the teaching of 
similar constructions in English, had not yet been studied. 
Furthermore, more than half of the morning class had to be 
eliminated from the investigation, to keep the numbers parallel

with the afternoon class; and some students moved from one 
class to the other, thus being ineligible for consideration 
in either. The morning class consisted largely of girls and 
the afternoon class was evenly divided; and, finally, those 
studying JTrench during the last period of the afternoon were 
naturally not nearly as fresh and enthusiastic as those whose 
class took place in the middle of the morning. 

However, the results of the investigation are herewith 
presented.

the verb "to be" for all forms such as 
"Am I walking,") 

Future: It is correct in English to use

encounter the word "will," to determine if it 
is used to denote simple futurity or 
determination. 

e.g., "I will go"— 

1. May be grammatically wrong, and mean 
"I shall go," or 

2. May be an expression of desire or 
determination, requiring the verb phrase 
"vouloir aller" in French. 

3. Past Definite (introduced here because encountered 

in almost all translation) 

This tense is reserved for formal and 
literary work. It is used to translate all 
ordinary English past tenses in a story, 
except for conversation. 

4. Imperfect--cf. English past progressive. (Dis¬ 

cussion on need to consider logical meaning 
of English words, rather than the actual 
tense form.) 

5. Past Indefinite—I have walked 

(Discussion of auxiliaries and past 
participles.) 


6. There are two tenses in French which correspond 
to the English tense showing what had happened 
in past time (not merely vfo at happened, was 
happening or has happened): 

A. The pluperfect—made up of an auxiliary in 
the imperfect and the past participle of the 
verb itself, e.g., J’avais marchg. 

B. The past anterior—consisting of an auxiliary 
in the past definite and a past participle 
e.g. J'eus march6. 

The past anterior logically means the same as the 
pluperfect, but is used after certain expressions 
(listed).

RAYMOND INVESTIGATION 

The teacher of French II at Raymond was kind enough to 
make it possible to obtain the scores of her students on the 
same diagnostic grammar test as was given to the writer 1 s 
own classes. The scores obtained, together with each student’s 
I. Q., his score in the Otis Form B self-Administering Test 
for Intermediate and High Schools, (October 7, 1940), and his 
rating in French II, are given below:

It was impossible to obtain a correlation between 
French and grammar scores for the Raymond students, as the 
former were given by letter and the latter obtained by 
number. However, the grammar scores were converted into 
ratings by letter, according to the same system as that 
used for the French, with the following results:

A correlation between the French II and Grammar marks 
as listed on the preceding page gave the insignificant 
result of .22. The students were, of course, too few 
in number for a satisfactory calculation. Also, their 
opportunities for learning English grammar at home were 
not parallel, as student 4 is Dutch and students 6, 7, 

8 and 9 are Danish.

WETASKIWIN INVESTIGATION 


Through the kindness of the teacher of the High School French 
at Wetaskiwin, it v/as possible to compare the marks of some of 
the students in French II and English grammar--again through 
the medium of the Fribble McRory diagnostic test. The scores 
are shown on a following page. As with the other investigations, 
the items on the Pribble McRory test in which a significant

CHAPTER V 

•hat Further Formal English Training the Students Under 
Consideration seem to require, and ./hen It Should Be Given 


The object of this section of the study will be to 
consider, one by one, the different subheadings of formal 
grammar, and accept or reject them as candidates for a 
place in a suggested course. With regard to some of the 
topics included, it may be objected, with reference to Part 
I of this investigation, that the students have already re¬ 
ceived such instruction. In answer, two points must be 
demonstrated: First, that the knowledge is essential; second, 
that it has, perhaps, been presented to the student, but not 
mastered by him. A similar analogy is that of the student 
who attacks higher mathematics with an imperfect knowledge 
of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. if 
he does not possess the knowledge, he must obtain it somehow. 

When is the best time to introduce such a course? Grade 
IA is suggested as a suitable point. The student has not yet 
attempted the detailed study of foreign languages, his future 
course is about to be mapped out, and, whatever direction it 
takes, a thorough grounding in grammar would appear to be 
essential. Ke has passed through several years of informal 
grammatical training, and such might well be consolidated into 
a practical, eminently logical body of knowledge, presented 
and received in an almost -scientific manner. 

It would have to be a compulsory subject, as it would 
be presented, not with the idea of investigating the pupils’ 
abilities and inclinations, but with the intent to give them

useful general knowledge. If feasible, it might be a half- 
year course, five periods a week rather than a three-period, 
full-year course, which might not be taken sufficiently 
seriously by the students. 

Three viewpoints will be considered: that of the student 
who wishes to talk and write like an eduoeted person; that 
of the foreign-language student (with special reference to 
French, though an almost exactly parallel case might be made 
out for Latin); and that of the student planning to enter 
the commercial world. Something of a conversational tone 
will be adopted as each topic comes under consideration.

(#) Reference should be made here to the use of "shall" 
and "should" with the pronouns "I" and "we". The 
attention of the students should be called to the 
fact that, while educated people still adopt this 
usage, it is popularly disregarded. Their interest 
should be enlisted as to whether, within a few 
years, the distinction will be dropped. Commercial 
students will find that most employers dictate "We 
will." The question arises as to whether the corr¬ 
ection should be made. In the writer's opinion, a

tactfully, without arousing comment,—and if the

Throughout the above, stress should be laid upon the 
logical meaning 01 each tense, tbt names being learned only 
as convenient means of referring to the various forms.(.'/) 


2. P erson and Number . This section will be largely 

a review, although stuuents are to be found in 
High School upon whom these two concepts have 
made no visible impression whatever. If tbe 
students are reminded that "person” refers to 
the person speaking, spoken to or spoken of, 
and "number" refex^s to the nu mber of people 
concerned, they may retain the knowledge, {'ft) 

It is important that, the pupils should realize 
that while "thou" is frequently cited as the 
correct subject for a verb in the second person, 
singular number, "you" is in almost universal 
usage. An almost parallel case will be found 
in French, with the exception that in English 
"thou" is restricted to Biblical language, 
while in French "tu" has four or five very specific 
uses. 

3. Voi ce. Active 

Passive (with definitions) 

This will entail ah explanation of "transitive" 
and "intransitive" verbs. The teacher of French 
will be not ungrateful if this be well and truly 
done • 

The students should be shown that each form in 
part 1 (Tenses) may be made Passive, while 
retaining its original tense. 


4. : cod. 

Indicative , declarative, assertive 

Imp e ra t iv e - - exp r e s s ing a command., wish or request. 

The students should j_ote the similarity 
between this mood and the indicative, in form, 
except that the imperative drops the pronoun subject 

A problem which frequently arises in commercial 
correspondence is whether such a sentence as:

is a request or an inquiry. Students would be 
well advised to adopt the usage preferred br¬ 
each employer, or indicated by the tone of his voice• 

Subjunctive —expressing doubt, condition, wish or 
supposition. There seems little need 
to stress this mood, as it is (fortunately) fast 
disappearing from the language. However, students 
should recognize its use in formal statements such 
as resolutions and after certain conjunctions. 

The following rule should cover most cases: 

Use the subjunctive in the past tense of the vero 
"to be 11 in the first and third persons singular, 
after "as if" and usually after "if, though, although, 
uniess and lest."

SPELLING 


In the survey of errors made in transcription, by 
Stenography 2 students, the problem of spelling loomed 
large. This factor accounted for an average of 12 
errors per student (Total, 168), in 31 letters. The 
figure is exceedingly high considering the fact that 
some students contributed very few errors. This bears 
out the testimony of the many business men who have 
complained of the unorthodox’spelling used by most 
stenographers. It has been the writer’s experience that 
students will merrily rhyme off the words ”’i’ before 
’e’ except after ’o’” and use the rule—but it is the 
only rule they have been offered. Possibly, if they 
were offered a number of purely mechanical rules to 
learn, instead of being subjected to the deadly mon¬ 
otony of lists of spelling words, there might be 
some challenge to their intelligence. 

Dickinson’s ’’Vocational Speller,” formerly used in 

the commercial course, has been consulted, and a few 

of the more useful rules are quoted below. 

”1” before ”e” 

Except after ”c,” 

Or when sounded like ”a,” 

As in "neighbour” or ’’neigh.” 

Except ’’seize” and "seizure,” 

And also "leisure,” 

’’Weird,” "height" and ’’either,” 

"Forefeit” and ’’neither.” 

A mute final "e” is dropped before a suffix be¬ 
ginning with a vowel unless by so doing the soft sound 
of "c” or ”g” is lost in the pronunciation of the 
new word.

When a suffix commencing with a vowel is added to a 
word ending in a single consonant, the final consonant 
is doubled: 

(a) If the word is a monosyllable: swimming 

(b) If the last syllable of the word is accented: 

forgetting 

One word only, "supersede,’ 1 ends in "seae." 

Three others, ’’exceed," "proceed," and "succeed" 
end in "ceed." 

All others end in "cede." 

"If you wish to succeed in learning to spell, 
Proceed to exceea even those who do well." 


The learning of rules can, of course, be overemphasized, 
but from the fact that so many students depend upon the 
one simple rule they do know, it would seem that they app¬ 
reciate having something definite upon which to lean when 
in doubt. 

An article upon lines similar to the above has been taken 
from the "Pitmanite" (a quarterly magazine published by 
Sir Isaac Pitman and Sons (Canada) Limited), and is 
appended hereto.

A more simplified method of learning to spell was recent¬ 
ly explained in an address delivered by James F. Pirie, Prin¬ 
cipal of The Success Business College, Truro, N. S. A con¬ 
densed version of part of his address follows: 

It is a source of gratification to me to find that "the 
powers that be" are giving some attention to the fact that 
there are a number of rules for spelling, and have incorporated 
some of them in the new Speller issued to Grades 1 to 6 in 
the local schools. 

The silent "e" drops out when adding a suffix beginning 
with a vowel, and remains in when adding a suffix beginning 
with a consonant. 

If the noun form ends in "sion," "tion," or "xion" the 
adjective will end in "ible," but if the noun form ends in 
"ation" the adjective will end in "able." .... 

When the first part of the word is a word in itself, 

"able" is the ending; and when the first part is no word in 
itself, the ending will be "ible." .... 

There is only one word in the English language that has 
the "sede" syllable, and that is "supersede." Then we have only 
three words with the syllable "ceed"—"proceed," "exceed" and 
"succeed," with, of course, their past tenses and participles. 
And all the others are spelled with "cede".... 

When the "c" has the soft sound of "s" it is followed 
by an "e"; and when it has the hard sound of "k" it is followed 
by an "a." . 















. 0 c. 


{) 



i%0 'i 











'.Then the first part of the word is a word i itself, use the 
ending TT ize n --and when the first part of the word is no word 
use !T ise TT .... 

When the accent falls on the back of the word, and the 
suffix begins with a vowel, double the consonant. But when the 
accent falls on the beginning of the word, don’t double the con¬ 
sonant.

PUNCTUATION 


Carelessness would doubtless account for many of the errors 
in punctuation found in the transcription survey. However, 
the students need to be made aware of the necessity to use 
punctuation with a specific purpose rather than as trimming. 
The total number of errors in punctuation was 233 (!) — 
higher by 44 than the number caused by any other factor. 

1. The Comma ( 'f) 

Students were inclined to use this mark indiscriminate¬ 
ly, some inserting too many, some too few. There had 
apparently been little attempt to discern the difference, 
in function, of such modifying clauses as tnose in the 

sentences: The boy, who could shoot well, took aim. 

The boy v/ho on the prize obtained ninety percent. 


2. The Period 

There is no need for a period at the end of a heading— 
when you come to the end, you have to stop. 

Abbreviations require a period; contractions require 
an apostrophe where parts of words are missing. 

An abbreviation occurring at the end of a sentence 
requires only one period. 

Too many abbreviations in a letter are a subtle in¬ 
sult to the addressee T s importance.

6. rackets 

The writer’s main complaint here is that 
many people enthusiastically start to enclose some 
material in parentheses and forget the closing 
bracket. This, of course, is pure carelessness. 


Specia1 Note, 

The following rules for punctuation in 
typewritten work should be engraved on the cover 
of every typewriter and on the memory of everyone 
who ever attempts to type, especially by what is 
known as the "hunt and hope" method: 

1. Th re are always two spaces at the 
end of a sentence. 

2. There are two spaces after a colon, 

except in special cases such as "4:30 p. m." 

3. There is one space after a period 
used to indicate an abbreviation; 
a serai-colon; a comma. 

4. At the end of a quotation: 

Periods and commas always go inside the 
quotation marks; 

Colons and semi-colons always go outside; 

Question marks and exclamation marks go 
inside or outside, depending on 
whether they refer to the quotation 
only or to the whole sentence.

7. The Hyphen 

This should include the whole s Dudy of syllabication. 
It is amazing how many students insist on dividing a word 
like "through" at the end of a line. (X) 

A few simple rules such as the following ^re necessary: 

1. Never divide a word except at the end of a 
syllable. 

2. Divide between pairs of similar letters, unless 
they belong in a root word. 

at-tention, stop-ping; but; pass-ing 

3. Usually divide prefixes and suffixes from the 
root word. 

4. Never leave one letter and a hyphen at the end 
of a line. 

(Note: If errors in hyphenating occur in this thesis, 

they are purely typographical, many different 
secretaries having been employed.) 

8. The Apostrophe 

Students should learn to distinguish between 
abbreviations and contractions and never to perpetrate 
a combination of two such as: cont T d. 

The apostrophe to show the possessive is simple but 
necessary study. (#) 


(#) Apostrophes accounted for 19 errors in the transcription 
test—not a particularly large number, buf still too large 
for accuracy.

CAP IXLJll.TICN (X) 

The main problem here appears to be one of 
uniformity* Students will, in one letter, capitalize 
"Construction Department,” fail to capitalize 
"Stores Department,” and type the first example 
again, this time . ithout the capitals. 

It was noted with satisfaction that there were 
relatively few such errors—possibly because, the 
teacher wa: supposed to (and did) indicate, when 
dictating, what words .ere to be capitalized.

In a few words, we may express our conclusions 
as follows: 

that the analysis of English texts showed that 
considerable formal grammar had been presented 
to the students up to the end of Grade IX, but 

that the Pribble T'cRory Diagnostic Test showed 
a very imperfect mastery of this grammar; 

that the major weaknesses in the work of our 
future stenographers and secretaries (the dis¬ 
tinction being very subtle but most important 
socially and economically) are Spelling and 
Punctuation; 

that grammatical errors on the part of employers 
are unhesitatingly copied by stenographers; 

tha.t the High School French course involves 
(and ‘ presupposses a knowledge of) a very great 
deal of English grammar; 

that even a small amount of special coaching 
in English grammar seemed to be of advantage 
in a French II class; and, specifically, 

that Stenography II and French II students 
are greatly handicapped by the fact that 
THEY - HAVE HOT MASTERED FORMAL ENGLISH GRAMMAR. 


"If you wish to express yourselves well (first of all 
clearly; and secondly, neatly and vigorously or even 
beautifully) you will find that rules of grammar help you 
to do so. But it is not enough to learn the rules: it 
is necessary to understand these rules—to see jusi what 
they mean, and to discover why they were made. There is 
an excellent reason for every rule: and generally it is a 
veiy interesting reason. There is much fun to be had 
from grammar if you tackle it in th£ right spirit and 
in the right way."
