INTRODUCTION 


The streams of the East Slope of the Rocky 
Mountains provide one of the few remaining regions 
where trout may live naturally• Cool, unpolluted 
water, absolutely necessary for trout, is becoming 
a scarcity'in North America* These east slope 
streams, therefore, are of unusual interest to the 
student of fish, as here trout may be studied under 
circumstances practically unchanged from those that 
prevailed before this country was settled. 

Only one species of true trout is native to 
these streams. It is the cutthroat trout, Salmo 
clarkii (Richardson ). Rainbow trout, native to the 
western slopes of the Rockies, and brown trout, from 
Europe, have been introduced during the last thirty 
years. The influence that these "foreigners" may 
have on the native trout can only be guessed. But 
their introduction makes it important that the 
habits and nature of the native trout be determined 
before they are too much affected. 

A region of the east slope where the introduced 
trout have made little headway is the upper part of 
the Sheep River drainage (see map 1). A preliminary

Scale: 1 inch = 1 mile

study has shown that Gorge Creek, part of this 
region, appears to be a typical cutthroat trout 
stream. Consequently, Gorge Creek was selected for 
a study of the abundance, growth rate, feeding 
habits and seasonal movements of the cutthroat trout. 
Portions of the main Sheep River and neighbouring 
tributaries. Blue Rock Creek, Coal Creek, Junction 
Creek and Dyson Creek were also studied to provide 
comparisons. 

In addition to this general study of the biology 
of the cutthroat trout, a taxonomic study was made. 
The trout fishermen are largely unfamiliar with the 
methods of distinguishing cutthroat and rainbow 
trout. Most anglers report their catches as rain¬ 
bows although provincial surveys have shown that 
mostly cutthroats are being caught. Therefore it 
is necessary to formulate a clear cut description 
of the native trout. There is involved here the 
practical matter of the fish hatchery. The anglers, 
who believe they are catching rainbow trout, demand 
that this species be reared and distributed in the 
streams. It seems probable, however, that these 
streams are really cutthroat streams and the rainbows 
may have deleterious effects.

Although the prime purpose of the investigation 
was a study of the biology of the cutthroat trout, 
it was also necessary to make a study of the effects 
of various environmental factors. Therefore, the 
investigation included an estimate of the biotic 
potential of the East Slope streams, using the 
Sheep River drainage in general and Gorge Greek in 
particular as the experimental area* 

In the account which follows, Gorge Creek and 
the other streams studied are first described. Then 
the taxonomic status and biology of the cutthroat 
trout is discussed. 


DESCRIPTION OF GORGE CREEK 


General Description 

Gorge Creek arises in two main branches, South 
Fork and North Fork. The South Fork begins on the 
northwest slope of Blue Rock Mountain at a height 
of 6,000 feet. The North Fork rises at the same 
altitude on the northeast slopes of Ware Mountain. 






■

- 4 - 


Each of the forks of Gorge Creek runs about four 
water miles to the point where they unite to form 
the main creek. From this junction, the creek con¬ 
tinues another four miles to join the Sheep River. 

The average drop in level is about 150 feet per 
mile. In May, when water is plentiful, this gradi¬ 
ent produces a water velocity of approximately seven 
miles per hour. By mid-summer, the rate of flow has 
diminished to one and one-half to two miles per hour. 

The South Fork of Gorge Creek is fairly shallow 
with small rapids, but it also contains some beauti¬ 
ful pools. At places, the stream narrows down to 
four feet and the water becomes torrential. The 

cover of the stream up to this point is good, with 

\ 

willow, black birch and the occasional evergreen. 

However, though the cover is good, the tribu¬ 
taries of the head waters become muddy after only 
two hours of rain. The cause of this is that water 
is shed from the steep shale sides of Ware Mountain. 
The water becomes less opaque within a few hours of 
the time it stops raining. The main Gorge Creek 
gets very muddy if the rain is the full length of 
the creek. This may be accounted for by the steep 











- !•' -

shale banks in its last four miles (from the junction 
of the South and North Forks) to within 250 yards of 
where it empties into the Sheep River. 

The North Fork of Gorge Creek arises in a ter¬ 
rain that has been burnt over but is now recovering 
with a pine reproduction six feet fall. This 
stream, in its lower reaches, is covered mainly with 
willow and winds gently through meadows. Mien it 
rains this stream never gets as turbid as does the 
South Fork. It joins the South Fork as indicated on 
map 2 at point Fj_. This is a two-tiered falls, 
which is discussed in greater detail in a later 
section. 

The main Gorge Creek winds through a rocky bed 
which is enveloped on either side by steep, shale 
banks which, on the average, are from thirty to fifty 
feet in height. These abrupt banks keep the sun* s 
rays from striking the major portion of the stream 
in midday, so even though vegetation is practically 
non-existent, there is a certain amount of shade. 

The creek bed itself is very rocky, with some beds 
of gravel, sand and rubble.

The stream runs through a narrow gorge, in 
places only six feet wide, with numerous small falls, 
none of which appears to be impassable. The average 
width of the creek is ten to fifteen feet. From 
map 3 it can be seen that there are eighteen pools 
in the first mile of stream. Many large boulders 
augment these pools as rest havens behind which 
trout can rest. 

Tributaries of Gorge Creek 

The tributaries of the headwaters of the South 
Gorge Creek vary from three to eight feet in width 
and the depth varies from a few inches to pools that 
are two feet deep. The pools are not too frequent, 
usually occurring at bends in the stream where the 
banks are undercut. The cover, which is good, is 
mainly fir near the mountain itself and shrub 
willow and black birch further from the steep slopes. 
The banks themselves are covered with moss, and the 
greater part of the terrain from the mountain to 
the main channel of the gorge is grassy meadow with 
overhanging shrubs. Fish were found in all tribu¬ 
taries of the headwaters. 



























- 7 - 


Below the falls, marked F-j_ on map 2, there are 
five tributaries which enter main Gorge Creek. Four 
enter from the north, arising from the slopes of 
Missing LihK Mountain, and winding through meadows 
before joining the main stream. There is only one 
tributary from the south which arises in meadows and 
is a gentle stream throughout its course. No fish 
were found in the tributaries below the falls. 

Physical and Chemical Features 
Temperatures ; 

In Gorge Creek the temperature varied from 
*+0° F. in May to a high of 67° F. in July. 

The last week in May the temperature fluctuated 
between 40° F. and 5*+° F. This is a daily fluctua¬ 
tion of 14° F. The maximum temperature is reached 
between k:00 P.M. and 5*00 P.M. while the minimum 
is reached after midnight and remains at a minimum 
till 8s00 A.M. the next morning. 

Chemical Factors ; 

The pH of Gorge Creek, as measured with a Hellige 
pocket comparator, is 8.1. The pH of the South Fork 
is 8.2 while that of North Fork is 7.8.

Bottom Fauna of Gorge Creek 

As Gorge Creek was the main stream under 
observation, fifty bottom simples were taken during 
the course of the three month period. Samples were 
obtained from the North and South Forks and the 
main creek at the localities marked on map 4. The 
samples were taken with a standard stream bottom 
sampler, (Davis, 1938). The findings are summarized 
in Tables 2 to 7,

The volume of samples from North Gorge Creek 
varied from 0.30 cc. per square foot to 0.70 cc. 
per square foot. The average volume v/as 0.49 cc. 
per square foot. Mayfly nymphs were the most 
numerous, and of these, Baetis was most abundant. 
The average volume of the bottom samples from North 
Gorge is four times that of the headwaters of South 
Gorge and about two-fifths greater than that of the 
lower waters of South Gorge. The absence of crane- 
fly larvae from the lower waters of South Gorge 
probably accounts for part of the difference.

The volume of separate bottom samples varies 
from 0.02 cc. to 1.60 cc. which is a very wide 
fluctuation. The 0.02 cc, sample was taken on a

In these lower reaches of the Gorge, bottom 
samples varied in volume from 0.10 cc. per square 
foot to 0.70 cc. per sqiiare foot of bottom. The 
average volume is 0.37 cc. per square foot. The 
total volume was made up largely of mayfly nymphs, 
stonefly nymphs and, to a lesser extent, by caddis 
fly larvae. 

In general, the samples reveal a rather meagre 
bottom fauna, at least as judged by the standards 
set up by Davis (1938) for the U. S. Biological 
Survey, According to these standards, all streams 
having less than 1 cc. of fauna per square foot are 
poor. The average fauna of Gorge Creek is 0.35 cc. 
per square foot. 

Samples from the headwaters showed the least 
fauna, probably because of lower temperatures. Vari¬ 
ations in quantity below the headwaters seem too 
small to be significant. 

DESCRIPTION OF OTHER AREAS STUDIED 

Sheen River 


The Sheep River rises west of Cougar Mountain 






























- 16 - 


at an elevation of 7,000 feet. It runs approxi¬ 
mately seventy water miles eastward to enter the 
Highwood River at an elevation of 3*000 feet. This 
is an average fall of seventy-five feet per mile. 

Half of the total descent occurs in the first twelve 
miles where the gradient is one hundred and sixty- 
seven feet per mile. This is a steep river gradient, 
almost torrential. Considerable stretches of the 
upper Sheep run through narrow gorges; this, com¬ 
bined with stream gradient, makes reaches of very 
fast water. 

The river was examined in the vicinity of Junc¬ 
tion Creek, at intervals between Junction and Gorge 
Creeks, in the vicinity of Gorge Creek, and in the 
vicinity of Coal Creek, 

Upper Sheep ; 

At Junction Creek the Sheep River is flowing 
at approximately four miles per hour - very swift. 

It is also cold - 47° F., and completely lacking in 
pools or cover. The bottom is a uniform depth of 
three to four feet and composed of coarse rubble. 

Just above the mouth of Junction Creek a low dam 


blocks the channel 



















17 


About one and one-half miles below Junction 
Creek, the current is still four miles per hour. 

The channel is one hundred feet wide with a few 
large and several small pools. 

In the vicinity of Gorge Creek the stream is 
braided in channels eighty to ninety feet wide which 
unite at Gorge Creek to one channel about one hundred 
and twenty feet wide. At this point the bottom is 
rubble without pools or bank cover. 

From Gorge Creek to Coal Creek the river runs 
through a deep gorge for about five miles. It is 
swift, braided and exposed. Pools occur only at 
turns in the channel, about every two hundred yards. 
The next mile and a half to Coal Creek sees the 
Sheep come out of the gorge, widen and become shal¬ 
lower. There are no pools or bank cover. Here the 
bottom is gravel. 

No work was done below the point of entry of 
Coal Creek into Sheep River. 

The average drop in level is about one hundred 
and fifty feet per mile. In May, when water is 




















- 18 - 


plentiful from the spring runoff, the water level 
of the Sheep River is at least six feet higher than 
its normal level. The rate of flow varied from 
four and one-half miles per hour in July to three 
and four-tenths miles per hour in August. 

The upper Sheep as a whole is very poorly pro¬ 
vided with vegetation. Its headwaters have good 
evergreen growth on either side, but the channel is 
so deep that shade to the stream is non-existent. 
Below Junction Creek, vegetation on its banks is 
negligible. 

Temperature varied from 40° to 50° F. through¬ 
out the summer. 

The pH of Sheep River is 8.1 which is exactly 
the same as that of Gorge Creek. 

Bottom Fauna 

Seven bottom samples were taken, two from above 
Junction Creek and five from below Gorge Creek. The 
analyses of these is shown in Tables 8 and 9*

Sample 1 was taken in late July and 2 in mid- 
August. The presence of blackfly larvae in the later 
sample probably accounts for the difference in volume 
of the two samples. The mayfly nymphs were three 
times as numerous as stonefly nymphs.

These samples were taken in mid-July from 
varying bottoms - rock, rubble, gravel and sand, 
and at different depths. Mayfly nymphs seemed to 
predominate, while the midge larvae were present 
in greater abundance than the stonefly nymphs. 

In general, the samples reveal a meagre bottom 
fauna as compared to Davis 1 standards. 

In 19 1 + r7 the average volume of a bottom sample 
from Sheep River was 0.5 cc. per square foot near 
Junction and 0.3 cc. per square foot near Coal 
Creek. (Miller, 1947) 






































21 


The present survey shows that in the upper 
reaches of the Sheep River the average volume of 
bottom samples was 0*2? cc. per square foot and 
0.15 cc. per square foot below Gorge Creek. The 
upper Sheep River is about half as productive of 
bottom fauna as Gorge Creek. 

Junction Creek 

This stream which is about six water miles long 
rises from the slopes of the Highwood Range and west 
slope of Pyriform Mountain, and enters the Sheep 
River approximately twelve miles below the source of 
the Sheep. 

During its course it drops from 7,500 feet to 
5,200 feet, about three hundred and eighty feet per 
mile. In spite of this very steep gradient, it is 
rather a gentle stream, as the descent takes place 
over a series of high falls. In the early spring 
this is a "wild” creek, with waters rising to six 
feet above the normal summer level. In mid-summer, 
the rate of flow varied from two to two and one-half 
miles per hour. 


The upper reaches of the creek are, at places, 

















22 


thirty feet wide, with numerous rapids and a fair 
number of pools; these are from one to two feet deep. 
Where the channel narrows to ten or fifteen feet with 
rocky sides the creek becomes a gorge. Just below 
these rocky gorges, pools which are crystal clear 
and over ten feet in depth are formed. 

In the upper three miles of this stream there is 
a series of falls varying in height from five to 
fifteen feet, numbering about five per mile. In the 
lower two miles what were formerly falls have been 
covered over and built up with logs to make the 
stream suitable for floating logs. These structures 
have been in place about thirty years. They appear 
to make a thoroughly effective barrier to upstream 
fish migration, although it has been reported fish 
were seen in the upper parts. In these lower two 
miles, pools are quite numerous (fifteen per mile). 
They are deep and clear. Vegetation along the banks 
is good, but the banks are far from the summer river- 
bed. The early spring floods are torrential enough 
to remove all vegetation, so the banks may lie as 
far as thirty feet away from the actual water*s edge. 
However, the banks are undercut at the turns and huge 
boulders offer rest havens for fish. 





- 23 - 


During the rainy season (June), Junction Creek 
remained quite clear as compared to Gorge and Sheep 
Creeks, 

The temperature varied from 42° F, to 49° F. 
during the summer months. 

The pH of Junction Creek is 8,05 which is nearly 
the same as the Sheep and the Gorge, 

A series of ten bottom samples were taken in 
Junction Creek. The results are shown in Tables 
10 and 11.

from the mouth of Junction Creek. Each 
sample was taken from one square foot of 
stream bottom.

The average of these bottom samples is 0.18 cc. 
per square foot of bottom which is much lower than 
that recorded in this area in 194?. (Miller, 194?), 
(0.^0 cc. per square foot). However, the relative 
abundance of the different forms is the same as before 
with the mayfly nymphs having by far the greatest 
numbers.

The first two samples were taken in early June 
when the temperature was 4?° F. maximum. An 
interesting point is that there were no Nemoura 


present at that date, but they were present in large 






































- 2? - 


numbers about mid-August when the next five samples 
were taken. An average sample amounted to 0.29 cc. 
per square foot, which indicates that the fauna is 
more plentiful higher upstream. The food per square 
foot of bottom is less than that of Gorge Creek and 
more than that of the Sheep River. 

Blue Rock Creek 

Blue Rock is a small creek, six miles long, 
which -rises at a height of 6,000 feet and enters 
the Sheep River at 5*000 feet, about one mile below 
Junction Creek. The average gradient is one hundred 
and seventy feet per mile. 

The upper stretches have a gentle gradient. 

There the stream is three to eight feet wide and 
flows through a wide valley covered with tall spruce. 
Numerous springs enter here. 

About two and one-half miles above the mouth, 
the stream enters a gravel bed approximately two 
hundred yards long. It disappears under this gravel 
and reappears downstream. In the spring the creek 
rushes over this gravel. 


Below this gravel bed, the stream enters a 
















- 26 - 


gorge. Pools are few and there is no bank cover of 
vegetation. 

The lower reaches are a succession of falls, 
the last being approximately three hundred yards 
above the mouth. No fish have been caught or seen 
above this falls. Between the falls are relatively 
quiet stretches (flow of one to one and one-half 
miles per hour) with numerous pools two to four 
feet deep. 

Near the mouth, the stream is ten to twelve 
feet wide; the banks are high and there is no shade 
the nearest vegetation is on the crest of the banks 

From a series of readings taken during the 
summer, the temperature varied from 40° F. in May 
to 53° F. in August. 

The pH of Blue Rock Creek was 8.1, which is 
identical to the pH of Gorge and Sheep Rivers. 

Eight bottom samples were taken. The analysis 
of these is shown in Table 12.

The first five bottom samples were taken nearer 
the mouth and they averaged 0.10 cc. per square foot 
with mayfly nymphs predominating, especially 
Rithrogena . The last three averaged 0.07 cc. per 
square foot and were taken higher upstream. Again, 
mayfly nymphs were dominant in numbers. Blue Rock 
has a more meagre food supply than any other stream 


examined

Dyson Creek 

Dyson Creek, about five miles long, enters the 
Sheep River one and one-half miles below Gorge Creek. 
It descends from 6,000 to 4,700 feet, an average 
drop of two hundred and sixty feet per mile. Like 
Junction Creek, most of the descent is in the form 
of abrupt falls and the average stream velocity of 
one to one and one-half miles per hour is not great. 

Dyson Creek above the saw mill (two and one-half 
miles above its mouth) divides into two branches - 
the North Fork coming from Junction Mountain, and the 
South Fork from Pyriform Mountain. Most of this 
stream runs through green timber, and, consequently, 
the banks are well covered with vegetation. There 
are numerous small falls and rapids with a few good 
pools. 

Below the saw mill the creek runs through a 
rocky gorge, but some places have sloping banks with 
willow cover. The pools are numerous, but lack cover 
and are polluted with sawdust from the mill. The 
sawdust was found in pools one mile below the mill’s 
sawdust pile which is on the stream bank. Falls 












- 29 - 


about a quarter mile below the mill are jammed with 
logs and slabs, and may prevent fish movement. 

Another fall which is just above the mill's sawdust 
pile is a vertical fifteen foot falls which appears 
to be a barrier to upstream movement. Fish were 
seen leaping down these falls. These may have been 
eastern brook trout since these were planted above 
the falls and were in quite good numbers in the pool 
below the falls (marked F on map 5). 

At least two permanent springs enter the creek 
in its lower reaches. 

The temperature fluctuates between 40° F. and 
?“+° F. 

The pH of Dyson Creek was 8.1, which is the same 
as all other streams of the Sheep drainage. 

Ten bottom samples were taken in Dyson Creek. 

The analyses of these are shown in Table 13.

The average of these bottom samples IS 0.49 cc. 
per square foot which is the highest average of any 
stream in the Sheep drainage. Mayfly nymphs were 
present in greatest amount. 


From the 1947 survey (Miller, 1947 ), bottom 
samples varied from 1.7 to 0.4 cc. per square foot. 
These yields are quite rich for streams in this 
region. 





























- 31 - 


Coal Creek 

Coal Creek rises at 5,500 feet and descends to 
the Sheep River at 4,600 feet, an average gradient 
of one hundred feet per mile. The North and South 
branches are each about three miles long and the 
main branch about six miles. Coal Creek enters the 
Sheep River approximately five miles below Dyson 
Creek, and directly across the Sheep from Camp Sandy 
Me Nab, 

South Branch ; 

This rises in the rocks of Pyriform Mountain and 
then flows in a bfcd with good bank cover of willow 
and spruce. The bottom is of small stones. The 
stream itself is about fifteen feet wide and flows 
rather gently at one and one-half miles per hour. 

The stream is well supplied with cutthroat 
trout 5 most of them were near eight inches in length. 

One mile from the junction of the North and 
South branches are some beaver dams, with an active 
beaver population. No fish were seen or caught in 
these dams. 

Temperature was 53° F. 





















- 32 - 


North Branch: 

The North branch flows through a muskeg, then 
through an area of evergreen, and, finally, willow, 
which covers the banks well. The stream flows in a 
broad valley which narrows down to a canyon at the 
junction of the branches. 

The North branch is ten feet wide, well pro¬ 
vided with pools and dense bank cover. The flow is 
about one mile per hour. 

One mile from the junction are six abandoned 
beaver dams, now filling with mud. 

There were numerous fish in the pools and 
riffles, the average size was well over eight inches. 
The' fish were all beautifully coloured. 

The temperature was 50° F. 

Main Branch ; 

This was examined near the junction of the North 
and South branches and near the Sheep River. It 
ranges in width from twenty feet at the junction to 
forty feet at the mouth. The first three-quarters 
of a mile run through a narrow gorge. The rest is 
open (map 6). 














Map 6.

Tributaries of Coal 












- 33 - 


Good bank cover is present, consisting of alder 
trees and willow. There are about fifteen pools per 
mile, four to five feet deep, and ten to fifteen 
feet long. The bottom is made up mostly of small 
stones. 

Rate of flow is one and one-half miles per hour. 

The temperature was 52° F. 

The pH of Coal Creek was 8.15 which is the same 
as the other tributaries of the Sheep River. 

Ten bottom samples were taken in Coal Creek. 

The analyses of these is shown in Table 14.

These samples were taken in the latter part of 
August. Sample number 8 was taken from a clay and 
sand bar, and consequently is unproductive. The 
first five samples we.re taken from rock and gravel 
bottoms and the average volume here amounts to G.72 
cc. per square foot. 

The over-all average is much lower than this 
figure (0.48 cc. per square foot). Coal Creek is a 
poor food stream according to Davis* standards.

THE CUTTHROAT TROUT 


Planting; Records 

A brief history of the fish planted in the ex¬ 
perimental area helps to give a clearer picture of 
the trout situation. 

All the streams with which this report is con¬ 
cerned were at one time or another planted with small 
rainbow trout, in varying numbers. 

The record of the plantings is as follows

In addition, ten thousand cutthroat were planted 
in 1941 in Junction Creek. 

The introduced rainbow trout do not seem to 
have become strongly established in these streams. 














- 36 - 


This is probably because of unsuccessful competition 
for food and spawning grounds with the native cut¬ 
throat trout; also, the streams have summer maximum 
temperature lower than that in ideal rainbow streams 
The present picture is one of a predominantly cut¬ 
throat population with a small mixture of rainbows 
and possibly a hybrid between the two. 

Recognition of Cutthroat Trout 

It is difficult to distinguish the cutthroat 
and rainbow; the characters used for the purpose are 

Rainbow - no red slash in crease below each side of 
lower jaw, 

- no hyoid teeth in throat, 

- scales of lateral line number about one 
hundred and thirty-five, 

- mainly black-spotted, but some red spots 
present. 

Cutthroat - red slash in crease below each side of 
lower jaw. 

- hyoid teeth in throat. 

- scales of lateral line number around one 


hundred and fifty 




























- 37 - 


- entirely black-spotted - no red spots* 

The favorite feature, the rainbow stripe, is 
not listed. This rosy band, which extends along 
each side of the body from cheek to tail, is present 
as often on cutthroat trout as it is on rainbow. 

A colour study was made of one hundred specimens 
taken from Gorge Creek. 'Cutthroat* markings and the 
colouration were carefully noted for each fish. The 
findings are tabulated as follows: 

'Cut' Mark 



Bright 

Faint 

Absent 

No. of fish 

69 

16 

15 


All these fish had a rosy band along each side. 

Taxonomic Measurements 

Since the 'cut* mark is the most characteristic 
recognition feature of the species, it was used to 
divide the fish into the three groups - bright, faint 
and absent 'cut* mark. On each of these fish a 
complete series of twenty-six taxonomic measurements 




























- 38 - 


was taken, (See Table 24 in appendix). Then each 
measurement was changed to percent of standard 
length. (See Table 25 in appendix). The propor¬ 
tionate measurements have been averaged for each of 
the three groups, bright ’cut* mark, faint 1 cut 1

and longest fins. 

These fish are thus 

of an intermediate character 


in several respects, but larger than either type in 















- 4l - 


others. The intermediate characters (particularly 
scale count) suggest that these fish are rainbow x 
cutthroat hybrids; it is known that cutthroat and 
rainbow are so closely related that they can actually 
interbreed successfully. The longer heads and fins 
could possibly be the result of hybrid vigor. 

It is tentatively concluded here that: 

(1) The measurements given for these fish with 
strong cutthroat markings define the original native 
cutthroat, Salmo clarkii (Richardson ). It remains 
for some student of taxonomy to decide to what 
geographical race these fish will be assigned. 

(2) The measurements of the fish lacking a 
cutthroat mark define the east slope rainbow trout, 
an introduced variety of Salmo gairdnerii (Richard ¬ 
son ) of unknown origin. 

(3) The measurements of the fish with a faint 
cutthroat mark define what is probably a rainbow x 
cutthroat hybrid, which has arisen as a result of 
the introduction of the rainbow trout. 
















Spawning; 


Earliest observations began on May 25th when 
fish were caught and their sexual condition deter¬ 
mined. On this date, when the water was still turbid 
fish were caught with a seine. An 8 -g— inch male was 
found to be ripe, i.e. in breeding condition. Milt 
flowed freely when the thunb was run down its 
abdomen. Further observations were made as follows: 

June 1st - 8 - 2 — and 8 -inch males - latter filled 
with milt. 

June 2nd - Two 7-^— inch females with ripe ovaries 
Eggs in the fish were not yet all of 
uniform size. Therefore it may be 
concluded that spawning would be 
later for these fish. 

June 6 th - 8 -f-inch female - ovaries to mature in 

19^9. 

inch male - milt flowed freely, 
June 12th - 19.6-inch trout, female - full of 
eggs. 

9.5-inch female trout - full of eggs. 
June 18th - 7 - 4 -inch female - extruded eggs while 
being fin-clipped. 





















- 









- 43 - 


June 27th - 17-inch female - just finished 
spawning. 

June 25th - Many fish extruded eggs while being 
marked. One 8^—inch female had only 
fifty eggs left in her, so she must 
have been just in the act of spawning. 

July ?th - Eighteen males inspected - all had 
milt; twelve females - some had 
spawned, others with a few eggs left. 

July 8th - Females - only the odd egg left in 
them. 

July 12th - 7-inch female full of eggs - yet to 
spawn; male still full of milt. 

At no time was the actual spawning act observed, 
but from these data, it would appear that the spawn¬ 
ing season is from June 1st until mid-July. 

On August 20th, numerous fry with yolk sac ab¬ 
sorbed were noted; these must have been at least a 
week or ten days old. Since it takes from thirty- 
three to forty-four days for eggs to hatch, depend¬ 
ing on temperature, (Needham, 1940) it can be assumed 
that the eggs from which these hatched were laid near 
the beginning of June. 


































- 44 - 


The fry were abundant along the entire length 
of Gorge Greek. They occurred in the shallow, quiet 
waters along the banks. There can be no doubt that 
the numerous gravel beds which occur throughout the 
stream were all utilized for spawning. There was 
no concentration of fry at the headwaters to suggest 
a spawning migration had taken place. From these 
observations, it is reasonable to conclude that, in 
Gorge Creek, the cutthroat trout make no spawning 
migration. 

An accurate account of the actual spawning act 
and location chosen in which to spawn is given by 
Smith (1941). He had facilities for placing sexually 
mature fish into closed portions of a stream. From 
these sections the fish could not escape, so a con¬ 
stant vigil could be kept over them. In addition, 
gravel was added to a few portions of the enclosed 
area, to provide more natural spawning beds. His 
observations in the main were: 

. (1) The female would not begin to dig a nest 

until a male was present. 

The female chose the location - over a 
gravel bed with swiftly running water 


(2) 







- 45 - 


passing directly over it. 

(3) The female did all the digging (two to 
seven hours per nest) with her tail, while 
the male courted her by nudging with his 
nose or vibrating his body near hers. 

(4) The male kept other males away by chasing 
them. 

(5) When the nest was deep enough, five to six 
inches, the female would arch herself into 
the nest with head and tail curved upwards. 
The male would come beside her so that their 
vents would be in close proximity. Both 
would strain at the same time, eggs and 
milt would be extruded simultaneously, and 
the eggs would drop into the nest and ad¬ 
here to the rocks immediately. Only four 

or five eggs are lost due to water current. 

(6) After the. eggs are laid, the female covers 
the eggs by digging above the nest. The 
current carries gravel and sand to fill 
the nest. Often a mound is left above the 
filled nest. 

The female builds numerous nests and lays 
her eggs in bunches. It takes from two to 


(7) 















- 46 - 


three days for a female to spawn com¬ 
pletely. After she has spawned, only three 
or four eggs remain in the ovary. 

(8) Spawning occurs both day and night. 

(9) Mature males (of same species) are not 
interested in eating eggs at the time of 
mating - all try to get in on the act. 

(10) ’Redds 8 (name given to spawning beds) may 
be laid in by more than one female. This 
overlapping causes little loss of eggs of 
previous layings unless the focal points 
of nest (deepest portions) coincide. 

Cramer (1939) states that 92.5 - 98.6$ of the 
eggs of Salmo clarkii clarkii are fertilized. 

Gorge Creek, with its ample gravel and rock 
bottoms, its maximum temperature of 67° F. and good 
water supply, is an ideal spawning stream for cut¬ 
throat trout. 


Seasonal Movements 

The present regulations governing angling for 
trout in our east slope streams are based on the 
assumption that the trout winter in the main rivers, 












- 47 - 


ascend the tributaries in the spring to spawn, re¬ 
main there during the summer, and drop down to the 
main rivers again in the fall. Most of the tributary- 
streams are kept closed in the belief that this pro¬ 
tects the spawning populations which will then keep 
the main rivers populated for anglers. 

During the .summer of 19 i + r? 9 Miller ( 1947 ) esti¬ 
mated the rate of growth of cutthroat trout in 
different tributaries of the Sheep and Highwood 
Rivers. Each tributary tended to have a differently 
growing population of trout. This suggests that the 
trout remain in the tributaries. 

During the winter of 1947-48, Mr, W. MacDonald 
of Provincial Fisheries re-examined some of these 
streams and found trout in the tributaries. 

Ranchers who live along the streams report 
having seen trout in the tributaries during the 
winter. 

However, the theory that the trout do not winter 
in the tributaries is so firmly fixed in the popular 
mind that additional evidence on the question is 
highly desirable. In the present investigation, 
some evidence has been gathered. 





- 48 - 


(1) In May, during the height of the spring 
run-off, cutthroat trout were seined out of Gorge 
Creek. It seems absurd to imagine that these fish 
were ascending from the main river at a time when 
the tributaries were filled with dirt and flood 
waters. 

(2) Out of fifty-three fish tagged in Gorge 
Creek in 1947 (Miller, 1947) ? one was recovered in 
1948 (June 27, 1948). It seems probable that this 
fish had remained in Gorge Creek. 

(3) A trap net was operated almost continuously 
from June 1st, 1948, to November 16th, 1948, (freeze- 
up) at the mouth of Gorge Creek. Part of the time 
the trap was arranged to take fish which might be 
ascending Gorge Creek from Sheep River. The rest of 
the time it was set to capture fish moving in the 
other direction. The trap formed a complete barrier 
from June 21st on; i.e. fish could not bypass it. 

The records from this trap are given in Tables 16 


and 17

During June, the flood waters of Gorge Creek 
gradually subsided and the water became clear. This 
is the period when trout might be expected to return 
to the tributaries if they had wintered in the main 
rivers. However, during June and early July the trap 
took only seven cutthroat trout. During the same 
period, trout were taken by angling in Gorge Creek 
above the trap. These fish must have been up the 
stream all winter. The catching of seventeen Rocky 
Mountain whitefish moving upstream confirms the 
well-known migrating habits of the species. The 
movements of dolly varden ( Salvelinus malma (Walbaum )) 
are, as yet, unstudied. 






















- 51 - 


During late summer and fall, up to winter and 
freeze-up, the trap took only four cutthroat trout 
going downstream. There is obviously no migration 
out of Gorge Creek in the fall. Two further obser¬ 
vations confirm the trap net records. One is that 
during this period, hundreds of trout were caught 
by angling in Gorge Creek; i.e. the trout were 
definitely still in the stream. The other is that 
of the fifty-eight trout marked in South Gorge Creek, 
not a single specimen was recaptured in Main Gorge 
(i.e. downstream of point of marking) out of four 
hundred and three fish caught. In fact, it was 
noticed that recaptures of marked fish were made 
in the vicinity where the fish had been marked. 

Winter observations made by Mr. W. MacDonald 
have revealed that Gorge Creek freezes to the bottom 
in its shallower stretches. Thus trout cannot mi¬ 
grate out of the tributaries in winter. The conclu¬ 
sion is obvious: the native cutthroat trout must 
remain in the tributaries winter and summer. 

Population Density 


A few hours of angling is usually enough to 























- 52 - 


inform an experienced fisherman of the abundance of 
trout in a stream. But angling or observation of 
the stream can only give relative ideas of popula¬ 
tion densities. It is desirable to learn, if possible, 
the actual number of fish present. In Gorge Creek, 
an effort was made to estimate the population of 
cutthroat trout by a marking experiment. 

The marking technique of Petersen ( 1896 ) was 
employed. Trout were secured by angling, from each 
a fin was removed with tin snips and the fish returned 
to the water. The number of marked fish recaptured 
in subsequent angling enables a rough population 
estimate. Thus, if N fish are marked and R marked 
fish are recaptured in a total catch of H fish, then 
P (the population) is given by the formulas 

P = WH (Ricker, 1948) 

R 

It is assumed that the marked fish suffer no 
greater mortality than the unmarked, that they remain 
in the stream and that they are as vulnerable to 
capture as unmarked fish. It is believed that in 
the area studied, these assumptions are justifiable.

Marking was done in main Gorge Creek, largely 
in the section below the junction of North and South 
Forks, and in South Gorge. The right pectoral fin 
was removed in the former area, the right pelvic in 
the latter. Thus, if the fish moved around much from 
headwaters to lower waters or vice versa, such move¬ 
ments could be detected. 

The totals of the fish marked on various dates 
and the cumulative totals of marked fish at large for 
the upper section of the Gorge Creek are shown in 
Table 18.

From the formula given previously, it would be 
possible to make population estimates each time fish 
were recaptured. Because of the small number of 
recaptures, however, these would be too inaccurate 
to be of value. Accordingly, a Schnable-type esti¬ 
mate has been used (Schnable, 1938), employing 
Ricker’s (1948) modified formula. This is: 

P » £ (AB) , where, 

CC 

P is the total population, 

A is each day* s catch, 

B is the total marked fish at large, 

C is the marked fish caught each day. 

Picking from Table 18 the data which show re¬ 
turns of marked fish and using them in this formula, 
the population estimate for Gorge Creek from the 
falls to switchback is:

This portion of Gorge Creek is 1.12 miles long. 

The population estimate becomes, therefore, 1,206 
fish per mile. 

In that part of Gorge Creek below the switch- 
back and downstream to its mouth, eleven fish were 
marked in 1948. A total of one hundred and fourteen 
fish were caught. The details are shown in Table 19 .

Treating these data in the same way as those 
of Table 18, a population estimate of 25? fish is 
reached. Due to the small numbers of marked fish and 
recaptures, this estimate is not reliable. 























- 56 - 


In South Gorge Creek a total of fifty-eight fish 
were marked, but in subsequent angling, although one 
hundred and two fish were caught, no recaptures were 
made. No population estimate is possible. The 
population must have been fairly large, however, as, 
on one occasion, a single pool, fifty by fifteen 
feet, yielded twenty-seven fish with an average length 
of 8.16 inches. 

Miller, 19^7, using the same technique and 
formula (on North Fork of the Sheep River) found the 
population to be approximately four hundred fish per 
mile. 

It appears from the 19 *+7 and 19*+8 estimates that 

the trout population of Gorge Creek lies between 

faevinilt# 

eight hundred and sixteen hundred^, with one thousand 
two hundred fish per mile seeming to^a good average. 

Sc hue k (19*+1) states that three hundred and 
ninety-six legal-sized brook trout per mile (seven 
inches tail length) would provide suitable angling 
for twenty-one days with angling pressure of eleven 
and four-tenths hours per day and would give at 
least one fish per angler per hour of fishing. 





















, 











- 57 - 


Shetter & Leonard (1940) state that the complete 
population of five hundred eighty and one-half feet 
of Hunt Creek, Michigan, was six hundred and five 
brook trout or five thousand, four hundred and forty- 
five fish per mile; in addition there were one hundred 
and eighty-eight muddlers per five hundred eighty and 
.one-half feet or one thousand, six hundred and ninety- 
two muddlers per mile. 

In Table 20 the percentages of fish over seven 
inches and over eight inches in tail length caught 
in four of the cutthroat streams are listed.

From this table we can see that from random 
angling in the above streams, at least 77% of all 
the fish are seven inches long or over, while as 
few as 35 % reach eight inches. 


















Gorge Creek is the stream with the lowest per¬ 
centage of eight-inch fish. This means that two out 
of every three fish must be thrown back by the Alberta 
angler. Since Gorge Creek has been closed to sports¬ 
men for a good many years, the high percentage of 
small fish is not the result of fishing, but must be 
a natural phenomenon due to high mortality rate. In 
numbers of seven-inch trout per mile, Gorge Creek 
compares very favorably with Schuck*s standard of 
three hundred and ninety-six per mile required to 
produce suitable angling. 

Growth in Different Streams 

One hundred and thirty-four cutthroat trout 
from Gorge Creek were measured, weighed and scale 
samples were taken from each. Each scale sample was 
cleaned and mounted on a glass slide in glycerine 
jelly. From a microscopic study of markings, an 
estimate of the age of each fish was made. This is 
a somewhat uncertain task as trout scales are very 
difficult to interpret. Next, the average length 
and weight of each age group was calculated. 


Six fish from Dyson Creek and thirty fish from 








- 59 - 


the North Coal were treated in the same way. In 
addition, twenty-two fish from Sheep Creek above the 
Ranger Station and eighteen fish from South Coal 
Creek were also measured and scale samples mounted, 
but weights were not recorded. 

The results of the scale studies of these fish 
are shown in Table 21.

As rather small samples were studied in some 
streams, the findings cannot he regarded as fully 
trustworthy. 

A study of Table 21 shows a remarkable variation 
in the sizes of fish of the same age from different 
streams. For example, average length of a two-year- 
old from Sheep River is ten and six-tenths inches, 
whereas an average two-year-old in Gorge is only 
seven and sixty-one one-hundreths inches. The 
explanation of the wide variation in growth in dif¬ 
ferent streams must lie in the character of the 
streams. 

In Table 22 the four streams are arranged in 
the order of the growth rate of their cutthroat 
trout. Various environmental factors of each stream 
are listed (data from Tables 1-11, 13 and 14).

The fastest growing cutthroat were taken from 
Sheep River. From Table 22 it may be seen that this 
river differs from the other streams in being larger 
and swifter. It is probably the size which is signi¬ 
ficant as it is well-known that the size of the 
container conditions the growth of aquarium fishes. 
Also the population density is undoubtedly much less 
than in the tributaries so that, although the total 
food supply is less, there would be more food per 
fish. 

Of the three small streams. Coal and Dyson show 
no significant differences in the rate of growth of 
their cutthroat trout. Table 22 shows that this 
might be expected; the streams are very nearly iden¬ 
tical in food supply, pH, temperature range, size, 














- 63 - 


pools, velocity and cover. The Gorge Creek trout 
grow significantly more slowly. Table 22 shows that 
Gorge Creek has a poorer food supply than Coal or 
Dyson and also poorer pools and cover. It is pos¬ 
sible, therefore, to associate good growth with 
food, pools and cover. 

Miller (19^ 7 ) examined a number of streams of 
the Sheep and Highwood and found that where signifi¬ 
cant differences occurred, the growth rate was faster 
in the warmer streams. The streams of Table 22 do 
not show very large temperature differences. How¬ 
ever, Junction and Blue Rock Creeks, where cutthroat 
do not occur, are significantly colder. It is 
possible that the low temperatures of these streams 
determine the absence of trout in them. 

Age at Maturity and Mortality 

Table 23 shows the distribution of mature and 
immature fish from Gorge Creek.

and immature trout from Gorge Creek.

From Table 23 it is apparent that the cutthroat 
mature during, the second or third year. Very few 
fish much beyond the age of maturity were found. 

From Table 21 it is evident that only 6% of the fish 
were four years or older. Miller ( 1947 ) in a survey 
of the Sheep, Highwood and Jumping Pound streams 
also found a high percentage of young trout. Shetter 
& Leonard (1940) found that the percentage of brook 
trout of each age in a stream decreases from year 
to year as follows: 

Group 0 - less than one year - 46.7$ 

Group I - less than two years - 30.8% 

Group II - less than three years - 19*8% 

Group III - less than four years - 2.7% 

These data suggest a rather high rate of mortal¬ 
ity. The age composition for Gorge Creek in 1948 















- 65 - 


also suggest a high mortality. There were seventy- 
six two-year-olds, forty-two three-year-olds and 
seven four-year-olds caught. This suggests a mortal¬ 
ity of nearly 50 % from age two to age three and about 
8 5 % from age three to age four (assuming each age 
group was of the same abundance when hatched). 
Further, out of fifty-three fish marked by Miller 
in Gorge Creek in 19^+7* only one was recovered in 
19^8. This also suggests a rather high mortality. 


DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

One of the principal contributions of this 
study has been to establish a large series of mea¬ 
surements of fresh cutthroat trout, taken in a situa¬ 
tion where there has been a minimum of interference 
by the introduction of exotic species. These mea¬ 
surements establish the characteristics of the native 
trout and will facilitate subsequent separation of 
native trout in areas where considerable interbreeding 
with introduced forms may have taken place. The 
measurements also suggest that some mingling of 







- 66 - 


native and foreign stocks has already occurred; they 
offer a clue to the kind of variations that may be 
anticipated where considerable hybridization has 
occurred, for example, in the Bow River, Complete 
records of the absolute measurements of the fish 
are included in the appendix so that, if a taxonomic 
study of the native trout is undertaken, it will be 
possible to describe its original characteristics 
with considerable accuracy. 

This study also throws some light on the prob¬ 
lem of cutthroat movements. A combination of marking 
experiments, trap netting and winter observations 
strongly suggest that these trout remain in the tri¬ 
butary streams and perform no extensive seasonal 
migrations. This conclusion has an important bearing 
on the management of east slope streams. The present 
policy of keeping tributaries closed as "feeder” 
streams is based on a misconception. The fish thus 
protected are not contributing to the main stream 
populations but, instead, die of natural causes and 
contribute nothing to the angler. These streams 
should be open to fishing. This conclusion is streng¬ 
thened by the data on winter mortality. The age 
composition of the cutthroat indicate that few live 







- 67 - 


beyond an age of three years. It would be more 
economical to allow some of these fish to be caught 
by anglers. 

The findings on population density will be of 
considerable value for assessing the effects of 
fishing if these tributaries are opened to anglers. 
The estimates of the number of cutthroat in Gorge 
Greek provide a standard for an unfished stream. 
Estimates made from fished streams may be compared 
with the Gorge Creek figures to give an idea of the 
effect of fishing on the population. 

Another contribution of this study has been to 
estimate the growth rates of fish from different 
streams. These estimates show that fish in differ¬ 
ent streams grow at different rates. This 
strengthens the conclusion that all fish do not drop 
into the main tributary to winter. Another aspect 
of growth rate study is that in some streams fish 
are mature and spawning at the age of two and three, 
but are still not in the legal catch size limit of 
eight inches. In view of the heavy natural mortal¬ 
ity, it may be advisable to lower the size limit to 
seven inches for some time, at least in the South 
Sheep River drainage.

The study of environmental factors may be co¬ 
related to some extent with the study of the trout. 
Thus, of the six streams studied, two contain no 
cutthroat trout. These are Blue Rock and Junction 
Creeks. In food supply, these do not appear to 
differ enough from trout-containing streams to pre¬ 
vent trout growth. But in lack of cover, cold water 
and high falls near the mouth, they differ from the 
other streams. Probably the high falls alone are 
enough to explain the absence of trout. Some in¬ 
formation on falls constituting a barrier to trout 
movement is provided by the falls on North Gorge 
Creek at its junction with South Gorge. These falls 
are in two steps, each a rise of 13*8 feet in one 
hundred feet; the lower is forty-seven feet long 
and the upper one hundred and ei^ity. Fish were 
observed climbing the forty-seven foot slope, but 
not the one hundred and eighty foot slope. 

In the four streams which contained cutthroat 
trout, the best growth was observed in the main 
Sheep River. This is probably due to a sparse popu¬ 
lation living in a large area, so that food supply 
per fish is quite good. In the three small

trout-containing tributaries, better growth is defin¬ 
itely associated with more food, more pools and 
better cover. 

In general, the growth rates of the cutthroat 
trout in all streams are poor. The explanation un¬ 
doubtedly lies in the low food supply, which does 
not exceed 0.5 cc. per square foot. Davis (1938) 
classifies streams with less than 1 cc. per square 
foot of bottom food as poor. 


SUMMARY 

This paper presents data on cutthroat trout, 
environmental factors, biology of the trout and its 
relationship to its environment which were secured 
during a summer survey of parts of the Sheep River 
drainage in 1948. 

Cutthroat, the native trout, provide almost 
all the angling in this drainage. An account of 
their taxonomic characters and colour characters is 
presented. These taxonomic measurements distin¬ 
guish the cutthroat from the exotic species of rain-

bow that has been introduced at intervals since 1941. 
Hybrids may have resulted from this operation. 

The growth rate of the cutthroat in four streams 
is given and an attempt is made to correlate the 
growth with stream conditions. 

Observations on age (from scale readings) and 
size show that the present legal limit may be 
slightly high for fish of the South Sheep drainage, 
in that many fish die before reaching the legal 
length. 

Studies of population densities in Gorge Creek 
are outlined. 

A discussion of seasonal movements of cutthroat 
trout is presented. 

An account of rates of flow, cover, temperatures, 
pH and bottom faunas of the streams examined is pre¬ 
sented. Two of these streams were without cutthroat 
trout and their absence is tentatively associated 
with low temperatures and high falls <>
