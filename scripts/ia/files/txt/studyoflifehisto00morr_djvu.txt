A STUDY OF THE LIFE HISTORY AND CONTROL OF 

'//IREWOHv!S, 


ABSTRACT 

An investigation was conducted into the habits 
hudius aeripeyis destru ctor . Brown, during the 
various stages of S-evelopment, with a view to proving 
or disproving the value of present recoimnended methods 
for control* Eggs placed above a depth of one inch 
below the surface of the soil suffered a heavy mortal¬ 
ity; Beetles laid freely in moist soil at constant 
temperatures between fifteen and thirty degrees Cent¬ 
igrade. Both sexes moved freely for limited distances 
on the surface of the soil. Normally females ovipos¬ 
ited at depths between two and four inches below the 
soil surface but they did not penetrate soil which 
offered a resistance of three pounds to the tester 
used. Any form of cultivation involving plowing rend¬ 
ered Edmonton sandy loams easily accessible to female 
beetles to a depth of greater than three inches. 

Neither the three mercuric dusts nor the ^lulligan Exter¬ 
minator, used as seed treatments, gave any protection 
against damage by wireworms. Extreme soil moisture 
conditions in the spring of the year were not one hund¬ 
red percent lethal to hibernating larvae. Fifty per¬ 
cent of the newly formed adult beetles survived the 
winter under summerfallow conditions even though they 
had been disturbed the previous fall. The extent of 
damage resulting to a crop from a given population 
of larvae is greatly dependent on the depth of loose 
soil, temperature at the surface, moisture conteht of 
soil, and the rate of germination of the crop.

TJCFE HISTORY AJ^JB CONTROL OF WIRSWOmiS 

Beetles ¥;rould require a separate paper in itself. The 
bibliography at the end of this thesis, which is itself 
far from complete, will convey sort© idea of number of 
investigators who have already worked in this field 
at least in America. The history of these investig^ 
ations is in general a discouraging story, a tale of 
one investigational difficulty after another^ Among 
the first wireworm studies made were those of Curtis 
#{25) and I)i*ummond (26) in 1845 and althouc^ that is 
over ninety years ago now little if any invcstigetion 
into the habits of the species considered here had 

been carried out previous to that commenced by Prof¬ 
essor Strickland, at this university in 1925 and cont¬ 
inued during the summers of 1926, 1927, 1928, 1929, 
and 1930. The results of these investigations were 
made available through publications (155,156,157,158, 
159.) and the unpublished records of the yearly invest¬ 
igations (160,161,162)• More recently extensive 
work has been done at the Dominion i2ntomological Lab;^ 
oratory at Saskatoon, under the supervision of Kenneth 

# Numbers refer to the bibliography at the end of 
this thesis.

The major object of th© present investigator was 
to secure definite information on the effect of envir¬ 
onmental conditions on th© density of larval population 
and the extent of larval feeding. Incidentally work 
was don© on certain seed treatments as methods of 
control. 

I . 

The north bank of the Saskatchewan River, between 

f 

the golf links and the railroad grade, west of the 
high level bridge, in Edmonton, had served as a source 
of adult beetles for previous experimental work. Bet¬ 
ween April 30 and May 12, 1936, this area was carefully 
searched and again in the spring of 1937. With th© 
assistance of Professor Strickland every stick, ston© 
and other loose object on this side hill was turned 
over and under a number of these were found from one 
to three adult beetles. Between two and three hundred 
beetles were collected in the spring of 1930 while in 
1937, although twenty-five were taken in one afternoon, 
only seventy beetles were taken altogether. It woiild 
appear that warm and unusually dry soil conditions 
early in the year caused a migration as no further

specimans could be found although the area was searched 
intensively on several occasions* Two different pairs 
were found laating under stones in 1936* This Is 
the first record of mting having been observed in the 
field^ (between May 2 and May 10, 1936.). 

Iismediately upon returning to the laboratory the 
beetles were separated according to sex* This was the 
procedure followed both years* Sexing was accoiaplished 
by the method earlier devised by Strickland (156). 

I2ach beetle was held in turn under the binoculars 
between the finger end thumb of the left hand and the 
last sternite depressed with the end of a blunt dissect¬ 
ing needle held in the right hand thus exposing the 
genitalia* By a glance at the last segment (the tnvag- 
inated tenth abdominal), now exposed, the sexes were 
easily separated without injury to the beetles. ®ie 
tenth sternite of the female is wide while that of the 
male is narrow and strap like (Plate II)* Itie method 
would se^m to the author more accurate and generally 
superior to the method of anaesthetizing the specimens 
used elsewhere, which must weaken the beetles. 

The different sexes were placed in separate glass

rearing jars (Plate VI,a) and fed on carrots which they 
ate readily* A little moist soil was added to the top 
of the plaster«of-Paris on May E6, 1956. Air temper¬ 
ature rose unusually high during the next few days 
reaching a high of 94 degrees Fahrenheit* On May 29 
the soil from the jar containing the female beetles 
was examined and found to contain many eggs* The 
female beetle population was then divided into two series 
and one stored at eight degrees Centigrade and the other 
at fifty-five degrees Fahr* The latter series contin¬ 
ued to lay eggs freely. 

Ihe determination of the presence of eggs in the 
soil was accoiJipilshed by washing the soil through a 
very fine screen wire by means of a stream of water 
and a camel hair brush* The eggs, which did not pass 
through the screen,, were then washed into a watch 
glass which was set on a piece of white paper and 
examined through the binoculars* vldien it was desired 
to count the number of eggs present the watch glass 
was marked off like a target and the eggs counted in 
each ring (156) (Plate 1,4; Plate III,a)* This proced¬ 
ure was made necessary because the soil particles

adhere to the Tisoous eurtae© of the newly laid eggB 
and mice them indiatimiulaliatol© from the soil itself.

work had indleated .that if there were many particles 
of silica preecrit in the soil they coaid only be cliat-

nesa of each with the end of a cliseecting neeclle, a

Note: It has been pointed out that the disappearance 
of the beetles from the collecting grounds 
early in the spring of 1937 was probably due 
to the heat having drivesn them down into the 
soil rather than away from the side of the 
hill and thifts the ^migspation of beetles^’ 
referred to at th© bottom of page three may 
be misleading*

THE EFFECT OF DEPOT OF 0VIP03ITI0B ECO 

HATCHING. 

Since the basis for some of the present recomm¬ 
endations for decreasing wireworm infestations is based 
on a more or less upproved assumption that the delic¬ 
ate eggs of this species cannot withstand dessication 
and extreme temperatures such as they would be subjected 
to if placed near the surface of the ground, it was dec¬ 
ided %o secure definite information on this point. A 
previous experiment (161) had been conducted by placing 
eggs in screen wire cages at various depths. The diff¬ 
iculty experienced in recovering larvae and eggs had made 
results uncertain but indications had been that eggs 
would hatch successfully at depths of greater than 
one inch below the surface of the soil at Sdmonton. 
Controlled laboratory experiments carried out previously 
had indicated that eggs exposed fqr more than one 
twelve hour period to temperatures of 102 degrees Fahr¬ 
enheit, at high humidity, do not hatch. A new technique 
was decided upon. Small one quarter inch glass tubing 
was cut into two inch lengths^ which served as cages. 

One end was plugged with plaster-of-Paris^ some ovip-

position soil was added, moistened, and twenty ©ggs 
introduced by means of a glass pipette drawn out to 
a fine point so that one egg at a time might be con¬ 
veniently handled (Plate III). More soil was added 
and the open end plugged with plaster-of-Paris. The 

eggs used had all been deposited in moist soil in 
glass breeding jars between nine A.M. May 31, and 
nine A.M. June 1. Duplicate series of these glass 

vials were placed at half inch intervals from one half 
inch to four inches deep in summerfallow in the insect- 
ory^ There was no vegetation in the area where these 
cages were set out the soil having beerx spaded to 
a depth of about nine inches some weeks before. A 
trench seven inches deep was dug with one vertical wall 
and the vials pushed horizontally into the vertical 
wall at carefully measured intervals. The soil was 

moist practically to the surface. Maximum recording 
thermometers were placed at the surface and at one , 

two and three Inches deep. Later more were added to 
secure records at four, five §nd six inches deep. 

These were read at eight thirty A.M. every morlking. 
These records appear in Table 1,B.

and the glass broken over a fine screen onto v/iiich 
the contents were shaken. This v/as sifted and examined 
dry then washed carefully and reexamined. Each egg 
was picked up irith a pipette when counted. It proved 
extremely difficult to distinguish unhatched eggs 
from egg shells. The number of each recovered is 
recorded in Table 2 along with some of the results 
previously secured* 

Ihe indications are that under the conditions 
of soil temperature and moisture which existed at 
Edmonton during 1936 and 1937, which conditions 
would appear to be fairly typical of the location, the 
eggs of this beetle hatch satisfactorily at depths 
of one inch or more below the surface of summerfall-* 
owed soil. Above one inch hatching would appear very 
uncertain. The maximum temperatures at these depths 
agree very well with those indicated to be satisfact¬ 
ory and those indicated to be lethal in eatlier 
controlled exj^eriments, (160).

one temperature might adhere with some soil to the 
body of the beetle and be recorded at the wrong temper-^ 
ature, 'fashing the beetles, however, proved to be 
an impossible amount of work so allowance for such err¬ 
ors must be raade in interpreting the results and not 
too much stress placed upon the occurrence of one or 
two eggs in any one vial* Records viere kept of the 
eggs laid at each temperature and of the performonce 
of individual beetles and are given in Table 3, 

This experiment yielded limited but fairly defin¬ 
ite information* Temperatures above thirty-five deg¬ 
rees Centigrade for periods of twenty-four hours under 
the humidity conditions which prevailed in these vials 
were fatal to egg laying fem^iles. Below fifteen deg¬ 
rees the beetles became sluggish and inactive and laid 
very few eggs* The greatest impetus to egg laying was 
offered by temperatures fifteen to twenty-five degrees 
inclusive. A well fed female beetle laid between 
one hundred and five hundred eggs* (In 1937 some 

females used in the oviposition experiments laid over 
nine hundred eggs*)

The activity of beetles placed outside under approx¬

in the insectory appeared inactive at fifty-two degrees 
Fahrenheit but became active when disturbed. A light 
rain had just begun to fall and the surface of the 
ground was damp and at a temperature of about fifty- 
four degrees on June 5, 1936, when this experiment 
began. Two female beetles were pieced under the shelt¬ 
er of a piece of plaster-of-Paris on the ground out¬ 
side* This artificial ^^rock^’ shelter was placed in¬ 
side the rim of a sunken metal cylinder sixteen inches 
in diameter and projecting two inches above the ground, 
(Plate VII,a). The beetles settled down and remained 
quiet. After five minutes a carabid beiitile had also 
found the shelter. 

Two male beetles treated similarly attached 
themselves upsidedown, to the under side of the shelter. 

Ten minutes later one female came out on top of 
the protection, rested, then travelled southeast on the

soil surface to the edge of the cylinder and tried to 
climb out. The second female moved about freely under 
the protection. The males moved less freely, vihile 
one female continued to move about on the soil the 
other tunnelled under the surface of the soil just 
beneath the protection but was on the surface again in 
a few minutes. 'The two females had disappeared by 
eleven A.M. and a robin was seen searching the area | 

for food. Ex8imination in the evening showed both males 
present under their shelter and one female under the 
other shelter. This beetle had probably been below 
the soil surface during the afternoon.

this stool rod would not drop freely were discarded- or 
remade. These field cages were then plugged and grad¬

The Cage was then held upright on a fim bench and a 
two pound steel rod, one inch in diameter, allowed to 
drop once through a distance of one inch onto the sur¬ 
face of the contained soil# The cage was then filled to 
two and one half inches and the process repeated, then 
to throe and one half inches and the weiglit again 
dropped# Loos© soil was added on top of the consolid¬ 
ated to raise the soil level to S,5’%4#5”6,5^ 
respectively according as the cage was to belong to 
series A, B, C, or D# consolidation forraula was 

adopted after much preliminary experimentation to 
secure one that would give a satisfactory gradient of 
consolidation and sufficient unifoirolty in the differ¬ 
ent cages#) The degree of consolidation of the soil ' 
secured was tested by means of the tester earlier devis¬ 
ed by Stricklaud. Consolidation was thus tested by the 
depth to which a sharp point would penetrate into the 
soil when driven by a known weigiit placed on the coll¬ 
ar of a free sliding rod (Plates 7 and TIII,b)# This ' 
mechanism is without doubt far superior to the type of 
which depends on a spring to register resistance.

were irianufactured and set out between June 7 and 10, 
1936. Twelve of each series were placed in the insect- 
ory (typical of sunoraerfallow), twelve in heavy couch 
grass sodj and tv/elve among the head rows of a fall 
rye plot. Later it was felt that the dry hot soil sur¬ 
face without the normal protection offered by rooks, 
sticks, etc^ might have something to do with the few 
poor results previously obtained. An attempt was 
made to ascertain whether or not this assumption was 
correct. More cages of each series were manufactured 
and three of each series set in each 3ocation with the 
surface of their contents one inch below the surface 
of the surrounding soil. (All cages were set out by 
first making a hole in the soil to the required depth 
with an auger and then inserting the cage but all 
cages set out previously had been placed with the 
surface of their contents flush with the surface of the 
surrounding soil.) 

Still another attempt to get at this problem was 
made by moans of an apparatus, devised with the assist/ 
ance of Profes or Strickland, which allowed a measure of 
control of the moisture, temperature, and consolidation

gradients* The apparatus consisted of two sheet metal^ 
cylindrical tanks^ three feet deep by sixteen inches in 
diameter* These tanks were supplied with plaster-of« 
Paris bottoms to allow moisture to move upward, holes 
were bored at one inch intervals from the top to a depth 
of twelve inches to allow for the lateral insertion of 
thermometers and the both tanks were set into a sheet 
metel trough fourteen inches deep and divided into two 
compartments, one for aacn tank* Over one cylindrical 
tanlc was suspended an electric heating elemfant surroun¬ 
ded by an asbestos cone and mounted on an adjustable 
pulley so that the heiglit might be regulated. The eyl« 
inders were then filled with sifted Edmonton soil end 
the outside rectangular tank partially filled with 
water^ (Plate VII,a)» This apparatus was fitted up in 
the horticultural root cellar where the teranerature 
was fairly constant. Preliminary detersiinations of 
the temperature and moisture gradients available by 
the use of this apparatus were made and the results are 
given in Table 6 along with those actually secured 
during the experiment®. Ik>th teraperature and moisture 
gradients were secured and as the season was progressing

r^pidlj^' it waa decided to proceed vdth the experiments 
at once* On June IVj 1936j the distance from the water 
level in the trough to the soil surface in the tanlcs 
was adjusted to tvwnty inches, the height of the lamp 
was fixed and Falireheit themoaeters introduced at 
one two and four inches below the surface# On June 18, 
the water level was raised two inches and six of series 
A, B, G, and D field cages were introduced# It iras 
considered that moisture and temperature coiiditioas 
were stebilis^ed by June SS and on that day five cages 
of each series ?fere stocked with one female beetle each. 
Moisture determinations and egg records ?/ere made after 
the cages were removed on June 30# On July 4, 1936, 
five more cages of each series were set in each tcnk and 
five six and one half Inch cages containing loose soil 
on top of a hard plug mere also added. Two cages of 
each series were stocked on July 6 and tlse teiriperature 
at the surface lowered to prevent casual ities if possible. 
These were exarninad July 20. The five booties which 
remained alive ifere placed in loos© soil cages in the 
tanks and left until August 4. Ill© three beetles placed 
in the heated tank died. The remaining two be ties 
were returned to the uhheated tank, one died, one

escaped and one remined alive on September 30. 

It was June 22 before the weather conditions in 
1936 appeared sufficiently settled to make it wise to 
stock the field cages which had been placed outside. 

At that time, a clear^ windy, warn day, one fem.le 
beetle was placed in each of six cages of each series 
in each location (fallow, sod, gro?ring crop) and In 
one of each series in each location of the cages 
sunken with the surface of their contents below that 
df the surrounding soil, fhe beetles were taken from 
the storage refrigerator which had been running at 
eiglit degrees Centigrade. (After a beetle was introd"* 
uced into a cage, the cage was. covered with a piece of 
cotton held on by an elastic band, Plate ¥11,b.) 

The second spring, 1937, t?/enty cages of each 
series were placed in the insectory on May 21 together 
with ten cages containing six inches of loose soil on 

top of a hard plug and labelled Series B. All cages 
were set in '^sui-omerfalloW*' and in view of the results 
of the previous year all were sunken with the surface of 
their contents below that of the surrounding soil, six 
cages of each series were stocked with beetles on June 8

and examined on June 29. 

?/hen each series of cages was manufactured five 
or more extra cages were made and selected at random 
to be tested and serve as checks on the uniformity 
of consolidation being secured* The results of these 
tests are set out in Table 4 along with the results 
of similar tests run after each series had become stab¬ 
ilised with the moisture of the soil, results of tests 
run after rainsto3?ms, results of tests run just before 
cages were stocked with beetles, and results of tests 
run just before the beetles were removed from the cages. 
The number of beetles used in each experiment, 
the depth at ?/hich eggs were laid, the period of the 
experiment, and notes on conditions at the time are 
all given in Table 5 > The results of soma previous 
experiments! v/ork along the same line are also included 
for comparison. 

A glance at the tables Indicates tlB t at no time 
during these experiraents did any beetle burrow down 

into soil which offered a resistance of three pounds 
or more to the tester used* It ims felt that in 1936 
this may been due to the very hi{^h temperatures

oviposition soil' whiob shO"ed its f/ater hold¬ 
ing capacity to be between 42«2 and 44.9 per¬ 
cent of its oven dry weiglit; the moisture 
content of air dry samples to be betfieea 1,45 
and 1*36 percent of its oven dry weight; and 
the moisture content of .aiAXture used in the 
cages (?;hich was stored in sealed mason Jars) 
to be 10*3 percent of the oven dry weight. 


On ^une 18 after three days of shower and rain two 
cages ware tested in the fiild -for consolidation. 

As had been the case during previous work the isoist** 
lire had temporarily destroyed the consolidation.

cut and the soil core carefully sectioned into 
one half to one inch sections which were either 
washed and examined at once for eggs or stored 
in salve tins and examined later.j

out on June 8, six cages of each series stocked 
with one female beetle each on June 2£, and 
reexamined on June 24, after the temperature on 
the surface of the soil had risen to 140 degrees

(Loose strings allowing plugs to di*op out accounts 
for losses of samples of some depths* This also 
allowed dust from the surface to sift down 
between the soil core and the wire and may have 
let soae eggs pass down also. To facilitate 
sampling to definite depths cages ??ere rolled in 
damp cloth to moisten the soil core and make it 
easier to section. Otherwise the soil which v/as 
very dry crmabled when the strings were cut.)

may hazard a gtiess that this was due to the unusu'-'lly

dry oonclitlona durini'i the ax arimenta having destr¬ 
oyed the normal moisture o: the soil and 

thua romovod the liicentive for going deeper* ?-i8VBr-

It Is si£iilfleant that in 1956 oiglit out of 
twelve boetlo® deposited eggs in cages with the surface 
of their contents set below that of the surrounding 
soil while only nim out of aavonty-two did so in 
the '-.'ther ongoa and that in 1957, when the "sunken 
cage" technique was used exclusively t?/enty-four out 
of twenty-nine females laid eggs. This would appear 
to be due to the longer life of the beetles concerned 
which may in turn be accounted for by tiie reduction

LIFIU HISTORY AND CONTROL OF WIRdlWORMS 

In the tendency of beetles to crawl up the sides of 
the cages off the l:zt surface of the soil and rest on 
the under sides of the cage covers ?fhere they were 
killed by the heat. 

The effect of standard G\: 2 ltural practices on the 
consolidation gradient of soil in the field next 
investigated. It was hopee that this might serve to 
correlate the work on depth of oviposltion with pract¬ 
ical control measures. Fields with Icnown cultural 
histories were selectad and the consolidation of the 
soil tested with the taster pravlou^l^y used in the 
laboratory. The first fields tested were iinlvarsity 
of Albertaj field Crops Plots, These had ell been 
under cultivation for the last fifteen years and were 
typical Edmonton sandy loams. The tests were made on 
June £9 5 1936, following a prolonged dry spell, 

Tho first field tested (in block 23} had been 
seedeu to west^ini ry© grass during 1953 and 1934j 
fallowed in 1933 ^ and Wi: s sewded to wheat at the time 
of tes ing. The crop had shown slieght damge earlier 
in the season presuraably due to wireworms. The soil

was badly cracked from the prolonged dry spell and 
proved very lacking in uniformity. Results of the 
tests are given in Table 7,A . 

The second field (block 1,D) was plowed October 4, 
1935 after the wheat crop, ?/hich had been froaen, was 
cut. It was seeded to wheat and oats. Results appear 
in Table 7,B.

The cracked condition of the soil made the console 
idation so variable in different places that no further 
work was done on these fields at this time. Unfortun¬ 
ately no fields were available on which shallow cultiv¬ 
ation machinery such as the rod ?^eeder had been used. 

On the first day of July similar tests were con¬ 
ducted at the Lacombe Experimental Station. "Bie fields 
tested had been under the follofiTing rotation since 
1911: potatoes, wheat, oats, fallow, wheat, hay, hay. 

The first field tested was fallow. It had been 
plowed June 18, 1936 and harrowed June £0. It was 
badly cracked, ( Table ?,G ) 

The second field was in oats and had been spring 
plowed five Inches deep on May 8, disced and harrowed

on May 16, and seeded on May 26, ( Table 7>D .}. 

The third field was in riotatoes. It had been 
plowed five inches deep on August 24, 1955: disced 
August 26, 1955: plowed six inches deep May 19, 1936; 
seeded May 22, 1936; harrowed June 11, 1936; and 
scuffled June 20, 1936. The first six tests were made 
between the rows of potatoes and the last nine in the 
actual rows betxwen the plants. (T able 

The prolonged dry spell had so affected the soil 
at both Mmonton and Lacombi that it was dif ioult 
to secure the desired information. It would appear 
that under the weather conditions this year any type 
of cultivation involving plowing renders these soils 
easily accessible to gravid females of this genus 
to depths at which eggs are relatively safe from 
damage. The Mmonton field broken from sod the pr@v-» 
ious year would alone offer any effective resistance. 

The heaviest rainfall of the 1936 season 
occurred on August 14. Follo?dng this rain tests 

were run on pupation tanks in the insectory which 
were being used in another experiment and the results 
did not seem to warrant any extensive field tests at

this time. Preliminary tests were, however, run on 
the suinrrierfallow soil in the inseotory, and the tests 
repeated aftor a week of dry weather. 'These results 
ar3 given, in Table 7,F. These preliminary t^sts 
serve to indicate txhat heavy rains seriously affect 
the ease of penetration'of the soil for short periods. 
The extent and duration of this effect may be of 
great importance in regulating the depth at which 
be ties may oviposit. Certainly this softening of the 
soil by rain must be considered in any cultural 
program designed to produce consolidation of the soil 
with the object of confining the oviposition of these 
beetles to depths which more or less ensure high 
mortality.

SEED TREATMENTS. 

Althou^^h very extensive work had be^n done else¬ 
where on the use of various poisons as treotmen s for 
seed grain to protect it ogalnst wireworms (54,160, 

171,17S) only one investigator had previously worked 
with organic mercury dusts (3) and since that time 
(1930) several new and improved dusts had been placed 
on the market as fungicides. An investigation of 
their possible value as ireworm poisons or repellants 
seemed timely. Thre comnercial mercuric dusts, Cer- 
esan, Leytosan, and Leytosanp, were selected for 
trial along with a material known as Mulligan’s Exterm¬ 
inator, some time ago patented by a Peace River farm¬ 
er but now barred froip sale. 

Plot tests v;ere conducted by the use of two sheet 
metal rectangles, 24’’ x 9” x 6”, set four inches deep 
in the soil in the insectory, (Plate VIII,c). The 
soil in the bottom of the rectluigle was leveled and 
tramped hard. Hows were then marked two inches apart 
commencing one inch from one end of the rectangle. 

Ten plump kernei-s of Red Bobs 222, wheat, were placed

in each row. In the first experiment the rows were 
alternated; i.e. one of the rows bein^ seeded with 
tre ted seed and the other with untreated. It would, 
it wos felt, be easier to determine any repellant 
effect by this method. 4 number of larvae were then 
placed in each rectangle. The larvae were secured 
from Bsaverlodge, where they had be n collected in 
Brome Grass fields and were kept stored here ot eight 
degrees Centigrade. Rows of tre ted and untreated 
seed were planted elsewhere at the same time to 
check on the effect of the treatments on gerraination. 

New Improved Ceresan was used in the first exner- 
iment at the recommended rate of one half ounze to 
one bushel of seed. Hedtangles were seeded June 17 
and t\v 0 nty larvae added to each. The exeminstiGH 
was made on July 5 and records of germination, extent 
of damage and type of damage were made. These 
numerical results are set out in Table 8 ,a . 

The second e -perlmont set out on July 3 and 
examined July 13 repeated the f ■ rst except that the 
rectangles were kept soaked to induce feeding ne? r 
the surface. Tiiose re ults an- ear in Table 8_,^ .

Experiment number three again repeated the same 
te&t using thirty larvae in each rectan^’le. This 
experiment was set out on July 14 and examined July 
24 to 27. The data on the resulting damagt are con¬ 
tained in table 8,0 . 

Mulligan’s Exterminator was tested next. A 
copy of the original instructions for use of this 
material was secured through the courtesy of Mr. 
Albright, farm manager, Dominion Experimental Sub- 
Station, Beaverlodre, Alberta. A copy of the same 
is attached to this thesis as Appendix I. ^ package 
of the Exterminator was on hand in the laborc.tory. 
Process number one of the instructions was followed 
in the first tost. The a^Jtual procedure follow d was 
to dissolve one tenth of a gram of i^xterrainator in 
one cubic centimeter of cold tap water. This was 
then placed in a corked container and allowed to stand 
in the laboratory for twenty-four hours. A sixty 
gram wheat sample {Red Bobs 222) was then carefully 

moistened with ta i irater and allowed to drain on a 
small piece of fine sore n wire# Over this sample 
the Exterminator solution previously prepared was

carefully poured and all was mixed. The comparatively 
vary small amount of liquid made it very difficult to 
secure ■ n even distribution of this material. The pile 
of grain was then covered with a cloth and all allowed 
to stand for ^wonty-four hours. Two rectangles were 
seeded the following d y, August 21. One was seeded 
with treated seed only and the other with untreated 
seed. Twelve rows of ten sedds each were used as before 
in each rectangle. The seed was carefully placed two 
and one half inches deep and the surface of thefioil 
in the rectangles floated by dragging over it a weighted 
piece of board set at an angle. The results appeared 
identical with floating in the field. Twenty-five larvae 
were added to each rectangle. A heavy rain fell 
shortly after the seeding. Table 8,D lists the results. 

Process number two of the instruction sheet was 
tried next. This was a dry treatment and proved a much 
surerior way of getting an even distribution of iSxterm- 
inator. Fifteen grams of wheatj which had been moist- 

enea tiventy-four hours previously, were dusted with 

0.05 grams of ISxterminator. The dusting was done 
through a fine sereen. The rectangles were seeded and

trauted as before. 'Pwenty-five larvae were added to 
each. The some soil Y/as used in the rectangles as had 
been used for the previous experiment. This soil was 
saved at the time of the previous exrmin tion in view 
of the fact that I/ir. Mulligan had stated that it req- 
uir€id the residual effect over a period of two years 
to secure one hundred percent control with Extermin¬ 
ator. iilmergence counts and checks on damage are 
listed in Table 8.H . 

Field experimenting ?/as necessarily limited be¬ 
cause of the length of the season and the limited plot 
space available but those field tests i?ere 3UX)plemen- 
ted by extensive laboratory experiments. ^3alve tins 
were used for this purpose. Fifteen groins of treated 
wheat were placed with moist soil and five larvae in a 
salve tin. Every five or six days a check was made 
on the extent of feeding and larval mortality. The 
grain was renewed at each exeraination. The same soil 
was returned to each can each time to conserve any 
residual effect of the treatmimts. The closed salve 
tins prevented serious loss of volatile constituents 
of materials used. On July 17 two tins were stocked

Semesan, and Semesan Junior c-sme to the same conslus-

Copper sulphate 20>p, Copper carbonate SO'i'i) also proved 
ineffective as either a poison or a repeilant. 

Wirewomxs feed on grain kernels by first biting 
through the bran layer and then gouging out the endo- 
derm. I’his very fact makes it unlikely that any 
treatment applied to th© outside of the seed and weak 
enough Hot to enter the seed will have any effect on 
these larvae. Such has proved to be the case in all 
th© extensive work done on this phase of control poss¬ 
ibilities.

the depth at which larvae may have bean '-laced at 
the beginninc^, of tht» experiment has no effoot on the sub-

each traiap. Best results were secured by pouring?: it in 
li^^htly and distributing it evenly throughout the area 
with a circular, swishing motion of the fingers. Other 
wise, if thrown in on one side with force or not care¬ 
fully distributed some compacting of the soil took 
place and hard spots resulted. It was also thought 
wise to drop the tamping weight an equal number of 
times from standing positions on opposite sides of the 
cylinder. The follo?/ing tamping formula was adopted: 

1* Add V* of soil — drop post through 6’’ six times. 

2. Add 1*^ of soil — drop post through 6*’ six times. 

3. Add 1” Of soil — drop post thx^ough 6” four times. 

4. Add 1^’ of soil — drop post through 6^^ four times. 

5. Add 1^’ of soil — drop post through 6” four times. 

6. Add 1” of soil drop post through 6" four times. 

7. Add 1”, E”, 3”, or 4'V of soil as desired. 

On July 26, 1936, one such cylinder was thus 
tamped and eiglit larvae placed on top of the fourth 
tamp. Two inches of loose soil were added. Consolid¬ 
ation tests are given in Table 10» 

The larvae appeared to have no difficulty in bury 
ing themselves under the surface of the firmly packed 
fourth tamp. After two days this tank was tested and 
the consolidation found unchanged. ]:)epths at which 
larvae oocurrea are given in Table 11. All larvae

iSdmonton black soil had been used in this cylinder 
and was used throughout these orperinents. It was 
surface soil from the insectory, screened through 
window screen and moistened. When the cylinder was 
examined the surface whs moist from a shower during 
the night . All the soil in the cylinder was definitely 
moist. 

Larvae which were twenty-*two millimeters or more 
in length were selected on ^uly 17 and 10. Bight such 
larvae were placed in each of ten cylinders. On© inch 
of loose soil was used on top of # 1 and # 2; two inches

LIFE HISTORY AND CONTROL OF WIREW0RI;I3 

A new supply of larvae arrived from Beaverlodge 
on July 21* Specimens over twenty-two millimeters long 
were selected from these for a similar experiment. Cyl¬ 
inders for this test were arranged as follows: 

I 11 and y 12 — one inch of loose soil on top. 

f IL e^nd § 14 — two inches of loose soil on top. 

§ 15 and f-- 16 — three inches of soil on top. 

§ 17 and i 18 — four inches of soil on top. 

§ 19 and # 20 — nine inches of loose soil on top. 

Eight larvae were used in each cylinder. Throe cylind¬ 
ers prepared as § 15 and // 16 were set out as consolid¬ 
ation checks. Larvae were placed on top of the^ fourth 
tamped layer in each case except in § 19 and 20 in 
which they were placed four inches from the bottoms. 

On exaraination only two pupae were found in the ent 
ire first set and both occurred in the some series^ 

# 5 and § 6 containing two and one half Inches of 
loose soil, and were found betfjeen two and one half 
and three inches deep in the loose soil on the surface 
of the consolidated soil. No pupae were found in the 
second set. Depths at which larvae were recovered 
are given in Table 12 for comparison with the experi¬ 
ments on depth of feeding.

The use of undisturbed adults as checks was imposs¬ 
ible because the cages had to be raised and opened to 
determine whether or not the larv' e had pupated. There¬ 
fore little can be said in conclusion except that some 
disturbed adults viill survive the winter in fallow land 
even under e comparatively light snow covering.

An explanation wf s being sought for the popul.' tion 
of wireworks found in the prairie regions of Alberta 
being larger than that found in the central uarhlaYid 
district* The presence of an island of dense populat¬ 
ion on the prairle-lik© north bank of the Saskatchewan 
river in Edmonton, where the beetles wore collected 
each^spring, suggested the. effect of soil drainage and 
topography® One would expect this to be most effective 
in the early spring when it would affect the ?/inter 
mortality of hibernating adults* The following exper¬ 
iment was devised to test tliis effect on larvae and it 
was hoped that at least a few of the laiv e selected 
would pupate and give some data on the survival of 
adults* 

On July 22, 1936 thirty wire guaze cages nine to 
nine and one half inches long were made and fastened 
with wire* Edmonton top soil was screened through 
window screen, dampened as in the larval activity exp¬ 
eriment, and used for these cages* They were consol¬ 
idated as oeries D cages in the oviposition experiment*

A larva ever t. onty-two milliniGtors long was selected 
and added to each cage on top of the last consolidation 

A. Ten such cages were sunken in the sum .erfaljow 
in the insectory« Five were placed in soil more or 
less permeated with tne ro^ts of Coiich Grass and five 
were placeu la more typical fallow lande 

B. Ten were placed in the native poplar bush south 
of Professor Haroourt’s residence* 

C*. Ten were placed in the steep west slope just 
west of the drive behind the student’'s residence kitchen. 

A new series of siBiilai* cages was stocked from the 
second shipment of larvae and ten out of the series set 

in each location as before, on July 31* Rach set of 

/ 

cages was 'given a rough test for uniformity of consolid¬ 
ation which provea satisfactory* 

None of the larvae pupated so any information 
secured was solely on larval survival, forty to fifty 
percent of the larvae survived the winter regardless 
of the location® Larval mortality does not appear to 
account for the differenced} in larvcil populiition noted 
in the different locations*

This investigation was suggested by the depths at' 
which larvae were discovered in the pupal survival exp¬ 
eriment. The apparatus designed for controlled exper¬ 
iments on depth of oviposition proved suitable for this 
purpose. Experiments were conducted as follows. 

Experiment 1 . The lamp was turned on on August 3, 
and til© asbestos cone set with its base touvhing the 
surface of the soil. Four field cages of each series, 

A, B, Cs D, and a series filled with six inches of loose 
soil 5 series were placed in the two tanks. One larva 
had been added to each cage two and one half Inches from 
the bottom and five grains of wheat added one inch from 
the surface. These cages were examined on August 12 
and the depths of larval recoveries and the extent of 
feeding recorded. TeBii>eratur© records were kept throu¬ 
ghout the experiment. ( Table 13 ). 

Expe riment 2 . A second ejsperiraent x^as comnenced 
August 18, when eighteen cages of each series as above 
were added to each tank. One larva had been placed 
in each cage on top of the last tamped layer (except

Results indicate that the larvae have no difliculty 
in piercing hard soil. In fact specimens kept in the 
insectory in rearing cages with plaster-of-Paris bottoms 
Invariably bored through these bottoms into the sand 
beneath and moved freely up and do\?n through these 
burrows as the conditions became favourable above or 
below. More in^ortant in its practical implications 
is the indication that when larvae are confined in a 
limited space beti?een the soil surface and a hard lay¬ 
er of soil, unless conditions are decidedly unfavourable 
they tend to remain in the loose soil and if the grain 
has been seeded into that soil the damage is relatively 
great because of that confinement. (Series H heated 
tank.) 

It would appear too that grain is readily attacked 
even when moisture is insufficient to bring about germ¬ 
ination. (Series B heated tank.) When moisture was 
so scarce, however, as to entirely prevent germination 
and 'eit the same time the depth of the loose soil was 
very limited the larval mortality was high, (^ries A

heated tank}* 

Under cool moist conditions larvae may often 
travel on the surface of the ground. This is suggest¬ 
ed by the number of escapes from c^ges in the unheoted 
tank A7hen no evidanoe of breaks in the plug was to 
be seen and is in keeping with tha observations of 
larvae on the sufface of the insectory plots after 
these had been watered and of escapes on the surface 
of the Insectory soil on two occasions in the morning 
after rain. 

These experiments suggest but do not settle a 
question as to the value of keeping a field heavily 
infested with wlrewoms shallowly cultivated and thus 
confi-ing the larvae in a small space between the surf- 
face of the, soil and the shallow plow bottom, in which 
space the seeded grain is easily available. Might not 
this practice anliance the damage which a given populat¬ 
ion of larvae might do?«

2. Continuous temperatures of forty decrees Cent¬

8 . Any form of cultivation involving plowing renders 
Edmonton soils freely accessible to fomale beetles 
to a depth of over two inches 5 at least during 
the current year. 

9. The mercuric dusts, Hew Improved Ceresan, T 4 eytos- 
an, and Loytoaan P, and ©le ?,?ulligan Exterminator 
used as seed treatments, have no poisonous or 
repellent effect on wireworms. 

10. Length of larvae is no criterion of maturity. 

11. A percentage of newly formed adults survive the 
winter under a light snow cover even though dist¬ 
urbed the previous fall. 

12. Drainage of the soil appears to affect larval 
survival in the spring very little if-at a.ll. 

13. Grain is attacked by these larvae oven under very 
dry conditions but excessive drought coupled with 
heat and a shallow hard-^pan increases larval mort¬ 
ality. 

14. Larvae tend to work in the looser soil and when 
confined between a shallow "hardpan” and the 
surface do relatively greater damage.
