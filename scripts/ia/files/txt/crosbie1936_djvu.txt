THE EDMONTON MARKETING SHED, 


DEMAND, SUPPLY AND PRICE 

















PRODUCTION AND MARKETING- Off FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN 

THE EDMONTON MARKETING SHED 

INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of this study has been to assemble information 
concerning the production of fruits and vegetables in the Edmonton 
district, and to analyse the marketing of these products from local, 
domestic and foreign sources. 

Method of Study and Presentation of Material 

The method of study has been, by preliminary surveys, to obtain 
data from representative producers and distributors, and interviews 
with marketing men or those in anyway assisting in the marketing 
process. 

The first survey was made in September 1934 when data con¬ 
cerning the production and marketing of fruits and vegetables 
obtained from fourteen representative producers operating stalls 
on the Edmonton public market; eleven specialist market gardeners; 
one broker; five wholesale houses; forty-two retail stores of 
various classes; and eleven Edmonton hucksters peddling from house 
to house. The records taken in September 1934 were to cover the 
marketing of the 1933 crop or, for business firms, the 1933 business 
year. This survey was not considered complete, or the information 
always accurate, as the person answering the questionnaire was 
asked to give estimates when the exact datanot at hand. The 
small number of representatives in each group from whom records 
were obtained made the danger quite large that averages from the 
individual estimates would be unrepresentative if there were large 
errors in the estimates. Also it is doubtful whether the number 











.

of representatives selected at random for each group was sufficient 
to be representative of the whole. The records however have 
assisted materially to illustrate statements made in the body of 
this thesis. The data from the surveys have been compiled into 
tables which wilj. be referred to throughout. 

In January, 1935, additional information was obtained from 
eight operators selling vegetables on the Edmonton public market. 

At this time data were collected on the trend of prices since 1933, 
changes taking place in production, unmarketed surplus in 1934, 
and the probable surplus in 1935- The operators were also asked 
to give opinions on the movement of prices over a number c£ years, 
and what influence prices would have on the acreage to be planted in 
the spring of 1935 * 

In May, 1935, a second survey, to obtain additional data, was 
made of eight Edmonton wholesale houses selling fruits and vege¬ 
tables. At this time, also, a trucking survey was conducted to 
obtain information on the transportation of these and other com¬ 
modities by truck. 

Information has also been obtained by personal interviews from 
time to time with men engaged in various phases of marketing. 

These are listed below:- 

1. Dominion Government Fruit and Vegetable Inspector; 

2. Edmonton fruit and vegetable broker; 

3. Various fruit and vegetable buyers for wholesale firms; 

4. Fruit and vegetable buyers for two large Edmonton departmental 

stores; 

5 . President, Edmonton Market Gardeners Association; 

6 . Freight Agent, Canadian Pacific Railway; 

7. Dominion Government Customs Officer;

8 . Secretary, Edmonton Chamber of Commerce; 

9. Superintendent, Edmonton Public Market; 

10. Officials of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and of 
the Statistics Branch; 

11. Officials of the City Licence Department. 

A survey of literature has also been made for information on 
production and marketing, and for statistical data. 

It has been the policy throughout the study to obtain factual 
material insofar as possible, and where this was not possible 
estimates have been obtained from several sources in order to have 
various viewpoints on which to base any conclusions that have been 
made. It has been necessary throughout to check certain informa™ 
tion from one source with that from other sources, as it is often 
difficult in a study of this nature to get disinterested opinions. 

It was not possible to obtain complete records from some of 
the men questioned in the surveys. It has therefore been necessary 
to estimate from other data given some of the data shown in the 
tables. When this has been done and there was doubt as to the 
reliability of the final estimate this has been indicated. Where 
it has been considered necessary to describe the method of obtain¬ 
ing certain data this has been done in the appendix. 

In order to economise on space and typing the verbal references 
have been listed by numbers in the back section of the thesis, and 
these numbers placed in brackets to indicate each reference or 
references. The literature references have been placed at the 
foot of the page on which the reference is made. 

The tables have been numbered consecutively and placed at the 
end of the chapter to which they relate.

CHAPTER I 

THE EDMONTON - HARKETING SHED 

The term "marketing shed" is herein to mean the area served 
by Edmonton marketing institutions in the distribution and 
assembling of fruits and vegetables* It will thus include the 
city of Edmonton and all the rural centres which obtain their 
supplies from Edmonton* The marketing centre not only distributes 
supplies, but is the assembling point of its surrounding country* 

The Edmonton marketing shed may be broadly classified into 
city, town, and country* The term town is here to mean any rural 
market centre* 

Location and Extent of Area 

"Edmonton is In the heart of possibly the largest agricultural 
region that surrounds any city in Canada"^*. It is the capital city 
of Alberta, located at about the centre of the province, and is 
built on the banks of the north Saskatchewan River* When the 
location of the city is considered in relation to the agricultural 
area, it is in the north west fringe of the main farming territory 
of the province, it must not be overlooked that it serves at 
present as the only distributing and assembling centre for the 
35,963 people of the Peace River country of Alberta and British 
Columbia, it is also the "Gateway to the North , wherein is the

mining, trapping, fishing and lumbering country extending to the 
Arctic Circle© This is unimportant as yet, as very little fresh 
fruit or vegetables are distributed beyond the end of the railways© 
The farming territory served by Edmonton may be roughly 
estimated at forty-six million acres, which would lie within an 
area about 100 miles south, 160 miles west, 100 miles north, and 
east about 200 miles to the Sashkatchewan boundary* This area is 
by no means all under cultivation or suitable for cultivation, but 
farming is practised over this area* the density of settlement 
varying with the district# This estimate does not include the 
Peace River country, which commences about 300 miles to the 
northwest of Edmonton# The intervening territory is mostly of low 
agricultural value, but contains some settlement adjacent to the 
railway# The greatest part of the Edmonton marketing territory 
would lie between townships 39 and 70# 

Topography and Plant population 

The description of the entire area would be -that it is gently 
undulating# Certain districts are distinctly hilly and other parts 
flat to slightly undulating# In general, the territory rises in 
altitude from 2,200 feet at Lloydminster and Edmonton to 3,000 feet 
at Edson# These points are on the east fringe, centre and west 
fringe of the shed# The land in the main is fairly well drained by 
£he Saskatchewan River, creeks and lakes# part of the territory 
to the west and north of Edmonton is swampy and at present very 
unsuitable for cultivation# It has been the history of considerable 
land in the northern parts of the prairie provinces to remain 
swampy until the bush is removed and drainage improved* A great

deal of territory considered at one time unsuitable for farming has 
later been turning into good farming country# Part of this swamp 
land will no doubt be used for farming, as the population increases 
or agricultural prices rise relative to other prices® Considerable 
of the territory, particularly to the west and north of Edmonton, 
is likely to remain permanently, or far many years, unsuitable for 
farming, because of its severely cut up condition by hills and 
muskeg. The soil of these areas is also inferior, due to severe 
leaching. These soils are classified as "white podsol" or "white 
wooded”* 

The plant population is varied over the territory. This is to 

be expected, because of its extent and varying soil and climate® 

Practically the entire territory served by Edmonton has been, or 

still is, covered by scattered or continuous bluffs of trees and 

bushes. In general, the country may be classified as belonging 

to the high upland plains of the park belt. The tree population 

is fairly sparse in the south eastern area, but increases over the 

area as it progresses north and west. To the east and south of 
the 

Ednont on/tree population is mostly poplar and willow, but to the 
west and north these are mixed with conifers. The land to the 
west and north, because of the heavier tree population and more 
swampy condition, will require more time and expense to bring into 
cultivation than have the older settled districts to the south and 
east of Edmonton. 

The grasses and small flora of the territory vary to some 
extent in variety and in the number of varieties. A study of the 
adaptation of these would indicate that the territory is suitable

to a wide variety of plant life. 

Agriculture 

The agriculture of the Edmonton marketing shed is naturally 
varied he cause of the extent of the area* In general, it may he 
described as ’’mixed farming”* The largest portion of the cash 
return comes from grain, mostly wheat, and various classes of 
livestock contribute a smaller portion* Livestock contribute more 
toward family living expenses, leaving less for cash sale* The 
proportion of farm income from livestock and from grain varies over 
the marketing area, depending on soil, pasture, water supply, 
proximity to market, rent of land, personal preference of farmer, 
climate, and other factors* 

It is safe to assume that practically every farm house in the 
territory under study will have a family garden. In this will be 
grown the common vegetables, such as turnips, potatoes, carrots, 
beets, parsnips, cabbages, onions, and summer green vegetables, such 
as peas, beans, lettuce, corn, etc* Some farm gardens include 
small fruits, such as strawberries, raspberries, currants and 
gooseberries* Hhubarb is found in practically every garden* The 
above outline gives a general idea of what is produced principally 
for home consumption* 

The type of farms surrounding Edmonton and the larger towns 
in the marketing territory are more varied in that some of these 
specialize in producing commodities particularly for sale to urban 
dwellers* Fruits and vegetables, in particular, are grown for sale 
by many farmers within a convenient marketing distance* These are 
produced in addition to other farm crops* In a closer area, about

five or six miles from the city or larger towns, specialist market 
gardeners produce vegetables for urban sale* 

Population 

The population of the Edmonton marketing shed may be broadly 
classified into rural and urban* This is an important distinction, 
as it divides to some extent producers and consumers* The majority 
of those classified as rural are self-sufficient, at least in 
vegetables, and many produce these for sale* The urban population 
can be divided into city, town, and village dwellers* 

Tables I, II, III and IY have been compiled in order to better 
understand the population of the Edmonton territory and the 
significance of this to production and marketing* 

Table I classifies the population of Alberta numerically and 
in percentage as to urban and rural for four census years* This gives 
the distribution for the province as a whole, but it may be assumed 
that it is fairly representative for the Edmonton territory* The 
table shows that the distribution between urban and rural has 
changed only slightly since 1911# This would indicate that it is 
likely to remain so for some time* In most cases the country towns 
and villages have grown up to serve the agricultural population 
surrounding them* They tend to increase in population only as the 
farming population increases* It is likely that the population, or 
at least the business population, of country towns will grow less 
rapidly than the farm population, because transportation facilities 
continue to improve, resulting in more business being done In the 
city by country and town people* It is also likely that many 
businesses in small towns are not operated to their maximum

capacity, which means that they can handle for some time increased 
business arising from expansion in farming* If this analysis is true, 
then it would seem that the greatest increase in population is likely 
to be in the cities and on the farms* This would mean the greatest 
increase in consumption of fruits and vegetables, with the increase 
in population, is likely to be in the cities* 

Table I also shows the percentage increase in population between 
census years* This shows a progressive decrease in the rate of 
growth* Unless there is a marked increase in agricultural prices 
it is unlikely that farm population will grow at any greater rate* 

Table II is included to show the percentage and numbers over 
ten years of age engaged in various classes of occupation* This is 
shown for both Alberta and Edmonton* The distribution of gainfully 
employed is given for the province, as no figures were obtained to 
show this for the Edmonton marketing territory. There would likely 
be some difference in distribution if these figures were known for 
the specific territory* The figures give some idea of the probable 
income groups* Those engaged in agriculture as producers comprised 
50*9 per cent of the total* Those engaged in various classes of 
service made up the next largest group of 16.7 per cent. On the 
basis of occupation, the probable fixed income groups did not comprise 
much more than 10 per cent* 

Considering the population of the city, the table shows that 
4.3 per cent were employed at agriculture. It is likely that some 
of these were gardeners operating within the city* It is also 
likely that some included in this are operating farms but living in 
the city. At least £5 per cent of those gainfully employed in the

city were relatively fixed income receivers# They would he those 
in transportation, and communication, finance (as employees), and 
public administration* The incomes of these are not absolutely 
fixed, but have been generally more stable than most other 
groupso 

Table III again is for the entire province and shows the 
relative number in each type of faming# It may be seen that the 
number engaged in straight fruit farming is very small* Those 
engaged in gardening and truck faming, of which there were 802, 
would be located in the majority close to the cities and towns* 

The population of the cities of Edmonton and Calgary comprised 
about 83 per cent of the total for seven Alberta cities* On this 
basis, as Calgary and Edmonton had practically the same populations, 
about 330 would be engaged in gardening and truck farming serving 
each of these cities* This is not likely to be a safe assumption, 
as some truck farmers, and particularly gardeners, will operate 
near towns and villages* In the summer over 100 market gardeners 
have been selling in one day on the Edmonton public market* The 
above number is likely to include hired assistants and other 
members of the family, so that it does not supply an index to the 
number of holdings* 

Table IV gives the population for cities, towns, villages and 
rural* An attempt was made to estimate from the population of each 
census division the total in the Edmonton marketing shed * 

A distinction between city, town and village population is 
made in the tables, because a larger proportional number of town

and village dwellers are more able t o be self sufficient in 
vegetables than city people* Land is usually cheap in these 
plaoes, and for this and other reasons more families proportionally 
will have a garden* 

On the basis of the estimates made in fable IV about 65 per 
cent of the population in the Edmonton marketing shed are rural, 
which means mostly farm dwellers, and 35 per cent are urban* The 
estimated total population of the marketing shed would he roughly 
400,000, of which approximately 140,000 may be classed as urban, 
ana 260,000 as rural.

CHAPTER II 

THE DEMAND FOR FRUITS M3 VEaSTABLES 

In the preceding chapter a description of the marketing shed 
was given in order to show the present extent of agriculture and of 
industry, of division of population between rural and urban, and the 
nature of the soil and climate, in order that these factors may be 
related to present and potential demand for fruits and vegetables* 

It is not possible to make reliable predictions regarding future 
trends in population or division of population between occupations* 
Whatever proportional changes or increases take place will cause 
changes in the amount of fruits and vegetables consumed* Rumours 
are current, as in the past, that we may soon expect a large 
increase in industrial activity in the province because of the 
explored and unexplored mineral and other resources lying mostly 
to the north and west of Edmonton* At this stage an increase in 
industrial population is not apparent, and agriculture does not 
show signs of expansion* In this discussion of demand the existing 
population and division between occupations only will be considered, 
but, it should be kept in mind that this is a relatively new 
country, and economic activity is subject to change, which in this 
case is likely to be extension rather than contraction* It may be 
assumed that an increase in the total quantity of food consumed 

will take place with increase of population* 

at length 

It is not at present possible to write/anything specific on 
the nature of demand for fruits and vegetables in the Edmonton 
marketing shed* To date this side of marketing is uninvestigated

in this province* Alberta, however, is not alone in this respect. 

A survey of literature indicates that demand is as yet relatively 
unexplored in the realm of economic research* Some valuable 
studies, a few of which will he referred to later, have been 
made by a number of workers in the United States and other countries, 
on the nature of demand for particular commodities* It would 
appear in general that demand has been assumed in the many publicat¬ 
ions on marketing. This would seem to be an important omission, 
for it is important to know the characteristics of the consumer, 
as measured by demand preferences, demand schedules, consumption 
indexes, relation of price to demand, etc,, in order to develop 
efficient systems of production and marketing, 1 

In this chapter an attempt will be made to set down some 
general notes gathered in interviews with market-men performing 
various marketing services in Edmonton. These notes will be 
followed by a brief discussion on demand in general for agricultural 
products, and this to be followed by a short review of published 
literature, which has been available on demand, for fruits and 
vegetables. 

Observations on Demand in the Edmonton ICarket 

A number of questions concerning demand were asked wholesalers 
and others. It was noticed that in conversation very few used 
the term in the schedule sense, but rather spoke of total demand, 
not demand at a price. Because of this concept of demand there 
1 See Appendix Z for statements on demand.

seemed to be a lack of awareness of elasticity of demand. It was 
not possible to obtain any figures from wholesale firms or other 
sources,which would indicate the nature of demand for any particular 
commodity or group of commodities© 

Wholesalers (1) and buyers (2) indicated that "no two years are 
alike in this business”• This was explained to mean that in certain 
years there may be an abundance of certain kinds of fruit or 
vegetables, and another year the offerings of these may be nomal 
or subnormal. Also, the quality may vary from year to year, in 
years of abundance it was intimated that price is low, and this 
stimulates increased demand* The demand, however, was said to 
vary for other reasons than influence of price. Public fancy is an 
important factor, between years, and particularly between seasons, 
and even between days. 1 

1. ”The storekeeper may buy a case of berries in anticipation 
of a brisk demand, and may then find that his customers have lost 
their inclination to buy on account of some event as commonplace as 
an ordinary rain storm.” J. M. Cassela* Pruit distribution in the 
Canadian West. Jour. Pol. Scon. 37* 1929. 

During certain years there is a strong demand for particular 
commodities, while in other years the movement of these is quite 
sluggish. Ho evidence was given to substantiate these gen eralizati on § 
except that they came from men with a practical knowledge of the 
market. The intimation was that the public showed a preference for 
one commodity in certain years, whereas in other years it might be 
something else. Ho explanation was given for this except that it 
usually coincided with a favourable year for the particular 
commodity. The particular preference, therefore, might be due to a

number of factors, or the absence of suitable substitutes® 

It was indicated that there is a definite difference in 
demand between seasons® However, it would seem that demand was 
not being regarded in the schedule sense* The question would be 
whether, if price remained the same, there would be any change in 
the amount purchased between seasons* It is likely that there 
would be, because of natural inclinations to tire of particular 
foods and desire for something else* It is also likely that it 
would depend on whether the commodity was normally used every day 
in the diet, or whether it was a luxury or occasional food* 

There is, however, one important seasonal event which 
influences the amount of goods purchased in Edmonton* This is the 
movement of many families during the holiday season of July and 
August from the city to summer resorts® These are located from 
25 to 100 miles from the city, so that they are beyond the normal 
range of Edmonton retail stores or market gardeners* There may 
really be no change in demand, but rather a shift from one supply 
centre to others* Farmers and market gardeners, located close to 
the resorts, supply most of the demand while people are on holiday* 
This will be referred to again in a later chapter* 

It was also learned in interviews that weather is important 
in determining where the public will buy, and what they buy* When 
weather is suitable, many consumers go to the public market and 
select commodities* During cold or stormy weather customers 
remain at home and prefer to ? phone their orders to retail stores* 
which have a delivery service* This means there is a shift from 
one seller to another* It was also stated that weather has a 

definite influence on quantity and variety of fruits and 


vegetables

purchased. When the weather is fine customers go through the 
stores and by seeing commodities on display, they are tempted to 
purchase. This is particularly true of luxury commodities. 
Observing the goods creates a desire and also the salesman may 
influence the customer to buy. 1 

It was stressed in interviews that substitutes are important 
in determining the demand for individual commodities. A small 
change in price may cause a customer to buy a substitute for 
which there is an almost equal desire. It Y/ould seem, therefore, 
that there may be an inelastic demand for agricultural commodities 

2 

as a whole, but between any two or more the choice may be elastic. 
Edmonton Consumer Demand for Particular Commoaities 

Evidence was obtained that there is a demand in Edmonton for 
white potatoes in preference to red, ana, of the white varieties, a 
demand preference for Netted Gem. This is a particular variety 
of smooth, oval shape, particularly suited to baking. Other 
advantages are the small wastage in peeling and its superior keeping 
quality. There is sufficient preference for this variety to induce 
the consumer to pay a premium of about 10°/ o (2) in price above other 
varieties. It was stated by one vegetable buyer for a large retail 


1 See also Wilbert C. Hopper, Consumption of certain perishable 
farm products in Albany, New York. Cornell Bui. 586, for influ¬ 
ence of distance, income, etc., on distribution of purchases 
between sellers. 

2 “With reference to any particular article of food in the con¬ 
sumption of which there is no fixed custom or habit, there may be 
a considerable measure of elasticity of demand, because of the 
possibility of substitution of one article of food for another. 1 '

store that there is a 75 fo preference for Netted (Jem potatoes, but 
the demand in the price sense is somewhat less than this# 

There is a definite prejudice against red potatoes by Edmonton 
consumers. Hed potatoes mil only sell when new, early in the 
season. One firm, it was stated, did not sell more than 5 f 0 of red 
potatoes to the total quantity sold. It was expressed by one 
buyer that the prejudice was confined to consumers who were un¬ 
familiar with potato varieties. Those buyers who !f really knew 
potatoes" recognized that the quality of suitable red varieties 
was equal to the white. Very-few consumers were said to be in this 
class (£). 

Market-men expressed the opinion that there has been an 
increase in demand for certain products in the last few years* 

It was not stated whether more was being purchased at the same 
price or whether a decline in price has increased the amount 
consumed. One of these products is head lettuce. There is practic¬ 
ally no call for leaf lettuce. Other products for which there has 
been an increased consumption were said to be oranges and other 
breakfast fruits* This change has not been recent, but has been 
continuous for about 15 to £0 years. Modem advertising and appeals 
to health have been the chief reasons* It was also stated that 
there has been a tendency in the last few years to shift the demand 
for fresh grapefruit and other fresh breakfast fruits to canned 
pineapple, tomato and other juices. No figures were obtained to 
substantiate these statements.^ 

1. "The consumption demand for many consumption goods is 
affected by such factors as fads, whims, health doctrines, weather and 
custom. There has been, for example, a marked increase in the per 
capita consumption of vegetables, fruits and dairy products

in the United States in the last few years, and a decrease in the 
per capita consumption of bread and meat* Thus, while the total 
amount of food consumed probably does not vary greatly, there 
may be important changes in demand for one product to another, and 
hence great fluctuations in demand for any particular variety* rT 
Clark and weld. Marketing Agricultural Products, p. 508* 


Quality is an important factor in stimulating demand for 
particular foods. In addition to quality the method of packing is 
important* A comparative discrepancy in quality and method of 
packing was given as the chief reason Eastern Canadian fruits are 
less popular than those from British Columbia or the United States* 
This will be referred to in more detail in a later chapter. The 
demand is for apples in boxes, whereas eastern shippers pack in 
barrels. (1) 

Character of the Demand for Agricultural Products 

It is now generally recognized that the demand for agricultural 
products, as a whole, is inelastic. Thompson^" in 1916 concluded, 
"the demand for agricultural products is, generally speaking, 
inelastic in character, and that for non-agricultural products 
elastic in character." (See also appendix g.) 

"With reference to food supplies as a vdiole* it is very 
evident that demand is relatively inelastic. Food up to a rather 
rigid limit is wanted imperiously, and then any further supply for 
present consumption would be even objectionable.” 

The consequence of inelastic demand is T, a laGk of sensitiveness 

to price changed • This means that it requires a relatively large

change in price to alter the amount purchased, whereas with an 

elastic demand there is a relatively quick response to price in 

the quantity purchased* It is likely that various types of 

fruits and vegetables vary in elasticity between commodities, 

between nationalities, consumers, seasons, markets, etc* 

1 2 

Thompson and Marshall state that elasticity of demand 

characterizes, in the main, those goods which we recognize as 

comforts and luxuries, while inelastic demand characterizes those 

classes of goods recognized as necessities* From these statements 

it may be concluded that the more a certain fruit or vegetable is 

considered as a necessity the more inelastic the demand is likely 

to be. Potatoes may be considered as an example of a food that is 

regarded almost as a necessity* Schultz found that the demand 

for potatoes was inelastic* There is a wide variation in the 

degree to which particular fruits or vegetables are regarded as 

necessities or luxuries, which would lead to the conclusion that 

there will be a difference in the elasticity of demand in any market 

for each commodity in the fruit or vegetable class# The degree of 

elasticity will also vary between consumers, income groups, seasons, 

4 

years, markets, price, etc. it would seem safe to conclude that 

among the various vegetable or fruit classes there will be sane for 

and others 

which the total demand is elastic / inelastic; the luxury goods

would be the more elastic, while those regarded as necessities 
would be relatively less elastic, or inelastic* It must not, 
however, be assumed that elasticity of demand for any commodity 
is constant, for it will depend on conditions, some of which 
have been listed. 

Demand Studies 

It has not been possible to obtain the results, except short 
abstracts in most cases, of studies made of demand for fruits and 
vegetables. More studies have apparently been made of other 
agricultural commodities, but, as outlined in the preceding 
section, it is not safe to apply conclusions from these to 
another group of commodities. For the same reason, unless the 
conditions are similar, care should be taken in applying results 
of studies of demand for fruits or vegetables in particular 
markets to other markets. 

1 

It has already been mentioned that Schultz , Bean and other 

United States workers have found the demand for potatoes inelastic, 

!, or a large crop is worth less than a small one”* Schultz concluded 

from a study of shifting demand for selected agricultural 

commodities, which included com, hay, wheat, sugar, potatoes, 

oats, barley, rye, and buckwheat, that the demand had ceased to 

shift upward or begun to shift down. "The only upward shift in 

demand to be expected in the near future is that due to the normal

commodities. Jour. Farm Scon. April, 1932. 















24 


increase in population.” It should not be concluded from this 

that demand for fruits and vegetables in general has ceased to 

shift upward, or has ceased to do so in the Edmonton market® 

Reference to only two specific studies on demand for fruits or 

vegetables were available, and these in abstract® 

Mallory, Smith and Shearfound the elasticity of demand for 

three classes of California fresh grapes from 1921 - 1929 to be 

-0*8 to -0*7 for table grapes, between -0*8 to ~*Q*9 for black juice 

grapes, and between -2*0 and -1*4 for white juice grapes* 

2 

Shear and Howe derived a domestic demand for California 
raisins of -0*3 to -0*4. 

The results of both of these studies indicate an inelastic 
demand for at least fruits of this class, for the markets studiedo 
Some valuable information was obtained by Hopper in a study 
of consumption of perishable farm products in Albany, New York* In 
this study data were obtained from 1020 families concerning their 
consumption of fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, and other perishables* 
Some of the important conclusions are valuable in that they indicate 
the importance of size of ineane, size of family, etc., to the 
amount spent for fruits and vegetables* The following extracts are 
quoted from the published data:

"The amount of income received by the family had a more 
pronounced influence on the amount spent by Albany householders 
for fresh vegetables than any other factor* Families with incomes 
of less than $1000 a year spent about $66 per family for fresh 
vegetables,,. ..♦*, $116 where the average income was $2500* With 
incanes of $10,000 or more, the expenditure per family was $192 a 
year* " 

"The per-capita expenditure for vegetables increased from $18, 
where the family income was less than $1000, to §48 for families 
whose incanes were $10,000'or more* Families with larger incomes 
showed a tendency to spend a more uniform amount per family for 
fresh vegetables than families with smaller incomes." 

"In all income groups, the per-capita outlay for fresh 
vegetables was consistently higher in families without children* 

The per-capita expenditure declined from $46 fop families with 
two individuals to $14 for families of nine or more persons*" 

"About half of the retail value of fresh fruits was spent for 
bananas and citrus fruits, and half for other fresh fruits. The 
annual outlay per family was $47 for bananas and citrus, and $45 for 
other fresh fruits* The per-capita expenditure was $12 for bananas 
and citrus fruits, and $11*50 for other fresh fruits." 

"Expenditure per family and per-capita for all lands of fruits 
varied directly with family income* There were greater variations 
in the amounts spent for fruit in the low-income families than in 
the high-income families." 

"Families with children spent less for fresh fruits,per-capita, 
than did families without children, which indicates adults consume 












m 


more fruit than children*" 

"The average expenditures for "bananas and citrus fruits as 
well as for other fresh fruits were enlarged as the size of the 
family increased # " 

Other parts of the study indicated that American families 
spent more, for fresh fruit, than other nationalities® 

"About 52$ of the householders interviewed stated that their 
consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables was increasing*" About 
32$ said the increase in consumption was due to increase in the 
size of the family, and 43$ said the increase was because they were 
more healthful than other foods® 

These quotations illustrate the necessity of a knowledge of 
the characteristics of the consumers in order to understand the 
demand and expenditure pattern* This will, therefore, vary in every 
market according to income groups, nationality and other factors* 

Demand Stimulation 

It would appear from the quotations from Hopper that probably 
the most important factor to increase demand for fruits and 
vegetables would be an increase in family income® It was found that 
expenditure per family and per capita increased continuously as the 
income increased* The study did not indicate whether more was spent 
with increased income on all classes of fresh vegetables and fruits, 
or on the more expensive* It is likely that highf'grades of each 
commodity, and a larger variety of fruits are used as income 
increases* 

consumed 

The second most important factor to increase quantity/would 











likely be decreased price* There is a minimum price, below which 
demand would not be increased*. Even when demand is inelastic there 
is some response to price* The question would be whether the price 
should be at the place to bring the maximum revenue to the producer, 
or market men, or, at the point where the largest quantity could 
be sold* 

The experience of advertising seems to indicate that this 
pays in certain eases* It is questionable whether it would pay 
local growers to advertise the sale of vegetables, particularly 
in the summer* It is likely, however, that individuals,by growing 
special varieties or preparing special graces, could increase their 
sales by using some method of informing the public* 

Wholesalers in questionnaires (3) stated that they do not 
advertise extensively, but leave it to the large growers and 
packer organizations* It is possible that these have less appeal 
to local consumers than would advertising by local firms* By more 
advertising it might be possible to arouse more fruit consciousness 
among the public. This might be most effective in increasing 
demand for fruits and vegetables in ,T off seasons”• Part of the 
increased demand in certain seasons may be because the public are 
thinking about particular foods* 

It is likely that a great deal of advertising merely changes 
demand from one class of food to another, and in the end does not 
increase total consumption. 

It should be emphasized that high quality and attractiveness 
of display are important factors in selling any commodity* It is 
equally important, if not most important, that sellers maintain 
















28. 


the confidence of the customer by reliable representation of 
grades, brands, etc. The public come to know what to expect 
when they order a certain grade or brand, and if these vary, parti™ 
cularly if the quality is inferior in certain orders, it may 
decrease the demand.

CHAPTER III 

PRODUCTION OP ERLTITS AND VEGETABLES 

IN THE EDMONTON SHED. 

It is the purpose of this chapter to discuss the production 
of fruits and vegetables in Alberta and to attempt to show the 
extent to which these supply the Edmonton marketing shed. 

There are important limiting factors which determine whether 
certain kinds of crops can be, or are, produced in particular areas 
The factors most important in determining the quantity and kinds 
of commodities grown are climate, soil, cost, and price received. 
The first mentioned is the important limiting factor in so far as^ 
adaptability of particular plants to certain areas is concerned. 
Providing particular crops can be grown under normal prevailing 
climatic conditions natural variations from year to year will influ 
ence the quantity and quality harvested. Ever a period of years 
growers have come to know what fruits and vegetables can.be satis¬ 
factorily produced. 

Cli m ate of the Edmonton Mark eti ng She d. 

The extent of the territory included in the Edmonton marketing 
shed makes it obvious that there will be considerable variation in 
climate between different areas. The average annual precipitation 
changes from about 15" on the east fringe to about 19" on the west 
side of the marketing shed, 1

The following quotation is taken as a good description of the 
Edmonton climate. This refers to an area commencing about twenty 
miles west of Edmonton, but it is generally typical of the whole 
district. ’’The climate ....... is fairly typical of the climate 

of the high plains region of Western Canada. It is characterized 
by long, bright, moderately warm summer days, and bright, cold, 
dry winter weather. High winds, such as occur occasionally in 
the southern and south eastern plains region, are very rare, and 
the crops are seldom affected by hot, dry winds, such as sometimes 
injure the treeless plain region, to the south. The ’’Chinooks”, 
which bring about occasional thaws during the winter in the southern 
plains region, seldom reach Edmonton, the winter weather is conse¬ 
quently steadier, and a snow covering is more apt to be maintained 
throughout the winter months than in the plains region. The 
climate is characterized by a high proportional amount of sunshine. 
The Dominion Meteorological Records state that the average of many 
years was 2,£04 hours of sunshine per year, whereas the average at 
several other points in Canada were as follows: Winnipeg 1,988; 
Guelph, 1,885; and Ottawa, 2,019 hours respectively. 1 

The average precipitation at Edmonton for 43 years, 1885-1927, 
as shown by the Dominion Meteorological Records, was 17.64 ins. 

For this period about 53 $ of the average annual precipitation fell 
within the growing season. ’’The important growth months of May, 
June, July and August received over 63f§ of the yearly precipitation 

and approximately 8 0 % fell during the months April to October 
2 

inclusive.”

A second important factor in considering the marketing or 
producing value of an agricultural area is the length of the frost 
free period* Its significance from a study considering the pro¬ 
duction and marketing of fruits and vegetables is that it gives 
some idea of the products that may be successfully grown over a 
period of years* This must not be taken to mean they can be 
economically produced and marketed; this may or may not be so* 

The following quotation discusses the frost free period. "The 
average length of the frost free period for the twelve years from 
191J? - 1926 inclusive was 89 days at Edmonton, 93 days at Calgary, 
and I30 days at Medicine Hat* The shortest frost free period in 
any one year, at any one of the three places, was 32 days; this 
short period occurred at Edmonton in 1918. The shortest frost 
free period at Calgary was 34 days and at Medicine Hat 98 days. 

The longest frost free period at Edmonton was 123 days, at Calgary 
119 days and at Medicine Hat 148 days. 

“It should be noted, however, that the frost free period is 
seldom as long as the growing season for wheat or other commonly 
grown crops* As a rule the early fall frosts are too light to 
injure the ripening wheat and oats, and the late spring frosts 
seldom affect these grains seriously. The average length of 
period in which the lowest temperature was 6° of frost, for the 
eleven years from 1916 to 1926 (inclusive) was 146 days at Edmonton, 
144 days at Calgary, and 168 days at Medicine Hat. The shortest 
period during these years was 118 days at Edmonton, 103 days at 
Calgary, and 209 days at Medicine Hat. 11 1

It will he noted that this quotation has particular 
reference to grain production but it can apply when discussing 
the production of fruits and vegetables* Certain small fruits 
and vegetables may not survive the late spring and early fall 
frosts whioh are likely to result in loss to the producers* 

These may occur too often to make production profitable over 
the long run* It may be seen that other Alberta areas, 
because of the frost factor, are more suitable to the production 
of certain fruits and vegetables than the Edmonton district* 

Corn and certain small fruits are examples. 

Soil * 

There is considerable variation in the soil type in the 
Edmonton marketing shed. However the broad classification 
places this territory in the “black soil belt”. Many classes 
of soil will be found as the type often varies within a few 
miles. The predominating soil is a “black loam”. “The 
black soil belt has its greatest development in the south 
central part of the province* Its widest east and west 
development is to be found in the neighborhood of Edmonton, 
extending east along the south side of the North Saskatchewan 
river to the Saskatchewan boundary and west to Stony Plain. ... 

. This belt becomes very narrow as it extends southward. 

The greatest north and south dimension is about 200 miles.” ^ 

To the west and north of this area is the wooded soil belt. 
Considerable of the soil in this area is classified as “grey

transitional”and "grey wooded”. These soils are of lower grade 
than the black, but as they are confined mostly to the outer 
fringe of the Edmonton marketing shed, the main portion of the 
shed falls within the black soil belt* This is important as 
this is rated as being the highest grade producing soil of the 
western plains. 

Edmonton is the most important single centre of production 

of fruits and vegetables in the shed. The majority of producers 

are found within 20 miles of the city. All the soil in this 

1 

radius is shown by soil maps to be in the black soil belt. 

Edmonton District Production .

Extent of Production . 

It has not beeapossible to obtain quantitative date on the 
production of fruits or vegetables or the numbers of operators 
engaged in producing these for sale. In general there are two 
classes of operators, (1) farmers who produce a few varieties of 
vegetables for sale as a side line to other farm operations and, 
(2), the specialist market gardeners. The majority of the former 
operate within a radius of approximately 20 miles fromthe city, 
while the market gardeners are mostly within a radius of 7 miles. 
The development of road facilities and the use of trucks has 
expanded both areas. One market gardener who sold every Saturday 
for several years during the summer and fall on the Edmonton

publio market is known to have his faim 40 miles by highway from 
Edmonton* This operator, however, was not typical* Some farmers 
beyond the twenty mile radius, particularly in the last 5 years, 
have brought occasional loads of vegetables to Edmonton for sale 
on the city market, to retailers, or for peddling. The number 
of farmers growing vegetables has increased materially since 1929 * 
The reason for this increase seems to have been the general low 
price of other farm commodities which forced them to attempt new 
enterprises* 

In addition to many farmers turning to vegetable production, 
there has been since the depression a great increase in the number 
of temporary market gardeners* These have been mostly unemployed 
single and married men. Gity lots have been rented and additional 
land in the immediate area surrounding Edmonton put to producing 
vegetables. Gardening has been the easiest occupation for the 
unemployed to enter as the city has rented lots at a low price 
and very little equipment is needed. It was reported that the 
city has supplied seed to many of these producers. 

It would be of considerable value to know the total number 
of producers of fruit or vegetables for sale and the number who 
produce sufficient for home consumption. If the numbers of 
each and the quantity normally produced were known, some pre¬ 
diction of market trends with changes in production could be 
made. 1 

1 An attempt to determine the number of producers of fruit or 
vegetables was made by interviewing several marketmen and pro¬ 
ducers. The president of the Edmonton Market Gardeners AssocQ 
in an interview could not give this number as the organization 
had less than 20 members. This man was also unable to give the 
average size of holding for market gardeners. The superintendent

of the Edmonton public market gave information that on a Saturday 
in October 1935 there were 240 farmers ana market gardeners selling 
on the public market. About 100 of these were market gardeners. 

Specialization of Production ." 

The two main classes of producers of fruits and vegetables 
may be broadly classified as farmers and specialist market gardeners. 
There is no distinct demarkation between the two groups. The 
distinction might rest on whether the operator devotes more time 
to, or receives more income from, grain and livestock or truck 
crops. Operators 1 enterprises range from complete specialization 
in production of truck crops to general mixed farming where only 
one or two vegetables are produced for sale. 

In general farmers who produce truck crops for sale grow 
only a few types of vegetables that may be handled with ordinary 
farm equipment and that fit in with other farm operations. The 
vegetables most suitable are potatoes, carrots, cabbage and turnips. 
It was emphasized in interviews that the number of farmers producing 
these for sale has materially increased since 1929* For the 
farmer, growing of vegetables is incidental to other operations 
and has been resorted to merely as an effort to find new sources 
of income. This is not true to the same extent for potatoes as 
for the other vegetables. Potatoes fit into the rotation and can 
be handled in large quantities by machinery, whereas other vegetables 
require more hand labor. It is likely that many farmers will 
discontinue producing vegetables for sale, with the exception of

potatoes, if prices of other farm commodities rise relative to 
truck crops. 

The specialist market gardeners devote all their time to 
producing fruits or vegetables. It has not been possible to 
determine the number who produce fruits but it is much smaller 
than those specializing in vegetables. The only fruits produced 
in any quantity, and this is a very small part of the total sold 
in Edmonton, are small fruits such as strawberries, raspberries, 
gooseberries, currants and blueberries. In some instances it is 
known that the production of these is the main business of some 
operators, but in general where they are produced, the amount sold 
is incidental to vegetables. 

The majority of market gardeners specialize in vegetable pro¬ 
duction. Practically all the common vegetables adaptable to the 
climate are grown by each producer. The proportion of quantity 

of each vegetable to the total varies between gardeners according 
to individual preference, suitability of location, estimate of demand, 
etc. The growers in the main produce those commoaities that can 
be handled with the same equipment. Commodities that require 
special outlays of capital are grown by less operators. Producers 
of such commodities usually make these their main enterprise. 

Hot house tomatoes are an example, as they require a heavy outlay 
of capital for greenhouses. Vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, 
turnips, beets, etc. which are the easiest to grow are produced 
by practically all operators, while those that require more skill, 
investment, and involve more risk are grown by relatively fewer. 
Examples of these are tomatoes, celery, and table corn.

It was indicated in interviews that more market gardeners 
have in the last few years installed green houses* These are 
being used to grow bedding out plants, which are sold to city 
residents who keep a small back garden. When the seasonal sale 
of bedding plants is finished, the green houses are used to grow 
tomatoes. The green house operators in most cases are within 
the city limits, as it is necessary to have water facilities* 

It is also important for those who sell tomatoes (hot house) to 
be close to the market, as these have to be sold as they ripen* 

Seasonal Movements of Supply. 1 

The marketing season for summer vegetables produced in the 
Edmonton district is from about July 1 to the end of September. 

Some vegetables, such as lettuce and radishes, are on sale at earlier 
dates but the majority of summer vegetables are not normally ready 
before this* Variations in the length of the season occur from 
year to year, depending on climatic conditions in the spring and 
the date of the first killing frost in the fall. The heaviest 
volume of produce is offered in August and Sept ember. 

The first supplies are mostly sold by the producers on the 
public market. As the supply increases and the demand is not 

strong enough to take all that is offered at the price, growers 
canvass the retail stores or peddle on the streets. When this 
demand becomes saturated stocks are offered to the wholesalers. 

The wholesalers thus do not start to handle the locally produced

garden stuff until it has been on sale for several weeks. The 
volume of produce commences to decline throughout September as 
the summer vegetables, such as peas, beans, asparagus, lettuce, 
radishes, cucumbers, etc. go off the market. From aboutOctober 
1 st until the beginning of the next season storage vegetables 
and tomatoes ©re the only local grown vegetables offered. Certain 
local grown storage vegetables normally fill the entire demand, 
while others last only part of the season. 

The flow of Edmonton grown truck crops to market increases 
in volume from about July 1 to the middle of August to September 1, 
from which time it decreases steadily until the first frost. If 
this is a killing frost it causes a heavy decrease in the variety 
and volume of goods offered but if the frost is slight, or only 
partially killing, the change is less marked. After the first 
killing frost the volume and variety of vegetables continues to 
decrease throughout the season. The decrease is not always steady 
or continuous, due to weather factors. When the weather is such 
that growers can bring commodities to market, the flow is fairly 
constant, but if severe cold or stormy weather intervenes, the 
flow is spasmodic. Stormy ?/eather often makes it impossible for 
growers to get their produce to market. Practically all store 
vegetables produced locally are stored in farm root houses. When 
the temperature falls below zero growers are afraid to open their 
root houses for fear of frost injury. Many growers who do not 
have an inside entry do not open their root houses after the tempera¬ 
ture declines to about zero until the following March, when higher 
temperatures are fairly constant. This locking up of supply is

jytp pl y .i a often sudden. When the temperature moderates there is 
often a rush of produce to the market. There are thus two types 
of interruptions to the normally steady but gradually decreasing 
flow of commodities to market. These are: l) changes in weather 
which influences the amount offered daily or weekly by those 
producers able to keep their storage open all winter, and 2) the 
low temperature period which forces some growers to keep their 
stock off the market until frost danger passes. 

It was pointed out by producers and market men that since 
1929 many of those who have gone into the vegetable business 
have no storage equipment, which necessitates marketing all their 
storage vegetables before final freeze-up* This has therefore 
caused a heavier than nomal volume of storage vegetables on the 
market at harvest time* 

Annual Yariationa in Praduatian . 

There are two main reasons for variations in the volume of 
production of truck crops. These may be listed as 1) involun¬ 
tary fluctuations due to uncontrollable factors and 2) voluntary 
changes due mainly to price. These will be discussed separately. 

Involuntary Changes In Annual Production. 

The changes which occur from year to year in the quantity of 
certain crops harvested, when the same acreage has been planted 
and similar care given, are largely due to weather, insects, disease, 
or other causes to a large extent beyond man's control. To some 
extent it is possible to control insects and disease, but this is 
often more costly than prices warrant. In a district such as

Edmonton, where there is danger from spring and fall frosts, the 
quantity of tender crops is often uncertain. The extent and 
time of the rainfall is a very important factor here, as there 
is no irrigation. Difference in the prevailing climate over 
the growing season is the main involuntary cause of changes in 
volume of production between years. A frost in August may 
entirely destroy the corn crop (as in 1935), or a late May frost 
injure the seedling plants or small fruit blossoms. In addi¬ 
tion to changes in quantity there are variations in quality of 
commodities for the same reasons. A dry summer, or unfavorable 
spring growing conditions, may cause a decrease in the volume 
produced of all commodities, whereas frost, wind, temperature, 
disease, insects, etc. may change the quantity and quality of 
only certain crops. There was evidence that the volume of all 
commodities was decreased by weather in 1929* 

The effect of weather in one season is often carried into 
the next year or several years. A dry summer depletes storage 
moisture which it may take several years to restore. A heavy 
winter snowfall helps to compensate a preceding dry summer, but 
because of the frozen condition of the soil much of the moisture 
from this is lost as run-off. In the case of perennial plants, 
injury in one season may decrease production for several years. 

A second factor, also mainly a climatic causation, is spoilage 
in storage, which changes the annual volume for sale. Widely 
fluctuating temperatures which are common in the winter in this 
district cause heavy storage risk.* 1 * Changes in external tempera-

ture cause changes in storage temperature which induces deterior¬ 
ation. A particularly severe winter with a long period of sub¬ 
zero temperatures often results in frost injury to storage vege¬ 
tables. This fear was heard expressed by producers during the 
continuous cold weather of January and February 193 6 .

Voluntary changes in annual production come from a determined 

policy of the producer* A producer may decide to reduce the 

amount planted but this does not necessarily mean that the quantity 

harvested will be decreased. This will be true for the individual 

producer, if the decrease in the amount planted is not offset by 

the involuntary factors. Unless all producers decide on a similar 

policy of increasing or decreasing the amount planted, there may 

be no change in the total quantity harvested. The voluntary 

changes in production are caused in the main by changes in price. 1 

Low prices, or prices for a particular commodity relatively low to 

other prices, may induce growers to vary the proportional amount 

of each commodity grown. A decline in price normally causes the 

marginal producers to drop out in succeeding years. This would 

depend to some extent on whether the low supply price is caused 

by a volume of produce above normal. If the low price is caused 

by yields above normal producers may consider it unwise to reduce

of production on the other.” Geoffery S. Shepherd, Jour, of Farm

the acreage the following year* 

There is, of course, a long run relationship between cost 
of production and the price received. Many factors influence 
cost of production. The most important are capital outlay, labor, 
rent, transportation to market, and risk. Changes in any number 
of these cost items influence differently individual costs of 
producers. A change in costs may therefore cause individual, or 
all, producers to alter the volume of particular commodities pro¬ 
duced. It is however very difficult, because of joint costs, to 
discover the cost of producing each commodity. Growers may there¬ 
fore continue to produce for some time certain commodities at a 
loss. In the long run price must cover cost of production, but 
it is difficult to say what is the long run. 1 

Presuming producers know what commodities realize a profit, 
they will attempt to adjust production of particular commodities 
so that the sale revenue will be maximized. Because of involuntary 
seasonal changes in production and prices this adjustment may only 
be approximated in the long run. 

There is a tendency among some producers to be unstable in the 
amount of particular commodities they produce from year to year. 

A favorable price one year may induce an expansion the following 
year. This expansion by a large portion of producers may result 
in a marked decrease in price, making it unprofitable for all 
producers. The wise producer usually tries to analyse market 
trends and adjust his production to long run changes in demand 
and supply.

Recent Production Tendencies . 1 

The production of truck crops has been very unstable in the 
Edmonton district since 1929, and depression conditions. In 192? 
and 1930 crops of vegetables were light and prices strong. This 
indueea many new market gardeners and farmers to enter the vegetable 
business. In addition to this many unemployed turned to gardening. 
This was encouraged by the city, which rented them land at a very 
low rate. In many cases seed was supplied the renter ( 6 )(7)* 

The result of this increase in production was a heavy surplus by 
1935. In "two surveys (4) (3) this was found to be 23f. to 60f o of 
the produce of each grower. The heaviest surplus was of storage 
vegetables, which were produced by farmers as well as specialist 
gardeners. A survey ( 8 ) of eight producers selling vegetables 
on the Edmonton public market in January 1933 revealed they would 
have no surplus in 1933* Two out of eight operators indicated 
they had decreased the acreage planted in 1934 compared with 1933» 
the other six had planted the same area. The general opinion was 
that yields had been somewhat lighter in 1934 than in 1933* Three 
out of eight planned to decrease the acreage planted in 1933 , four 
expected to plant the same, and one operator expected to increase, 
as he contemplated feeding the surplus, if any, to hogs. 

Production in 1933 was materially reduced by a frost in 
August, which destroyed many tender vegetables and reduced the 
yields of others. This was particularly true of potatoes. 

It was pointed out in interviews (61(7) with producers and

marketmen that normal economic forces of price have not been 
allowed to operate to reduce production. Many unemployed producers 
are on relief and in addition are given land cheap and free seed, 
which means their costs are nil or very low. Low prices have 
therefore not influenced the quantity produced by these operators. 

It would appear that the regular producers have a just grievance 
when they have to meet unfair competition of this nature. 

The absence of other occupations or crops returning greater 
revenue has prevented any real decrease in production. Reductions 
in volume of produce have been mostly from the involuntary causes.. 

It is unlikely there will be a decrease in the number of producers 
until there is an increase in employment in other fields, 

Evidence was found that local production of certain vegetables, 
particularly lettuce and celery, has increased very greatly since 
increased tariff^protection was given in 1930 and again in 1932 
by the Dominion Government. It was estimated that the local 
production of celery has increased 100% (6) and production of 
lettuce by 200% (6). "Previous to this period there was little 
attempt by local producers to grow head lettuce". (6) 


Increase in 1930 of the general tariff against United States 
vegetables and implementing in 1932 of seasonal duties in addition 
to the general tariff. The seasonal duties were applied when 
domestic vegetables ana fruits were ready for market and removed 
when these were exhausted.

CHAPTER I?. 

COMMOD ITIES PRODUCED IM THE EDMONTON DISTRICT 1 
FOR CITY SALE 

In this section principal fruits and vegetables produced and 
marketed in the Edmonton district will be discussed individually. 
The absence of statistical data of production will limit the dis¬ 
cussion as very little can be stated on the quantity produced of 
each commodity. 

Potatoes . 

Ex t . a at. of & . Q .to P t.i. Q ^« 

Potatoes are likely grown for market on more farms than any 
other vegetable. The climate is well suited to this crop, it 
fits into general farm rotations, requires the minimum of extra 
equipment, and, if prices are too low for profitable marketing, 
the crops may be fed to livestock. For these reasons this 
vegetable is regularly grown by farmers and specialist market 
gardeners. 

The normal fringe of production is about 20 miles from 
Edmonton, but many farmers bring potatoes to the city from beyond 

2 

this distance. The average distance from market of 11 operators

(6), (7). These will be referred to specifically throughout this 
section. 

Tables V, VI, and VII at the end of this chapter summarize the 
data obtained in two surveys. 

2 The operators included in a survey in September 1934 were from 
a representative group selling on the Edmonton public market. In 
the group were operators selling dairy products only, truck crops 
only, or mixed farm products, etc. The range in the size of their 
holdings was from 0.3 to 160 acres; and 8 out of 14 operators had

15 or less acres, 2 had 80 aores, and 2 operated 160 acres. This 
would indicate that the survey included the specialist and non¬ 
specialist vegetable producer. A summarized description of the 
operator's business is given in Table V. 


included in a survey (5) who were selling vegetables on the 
Edmonton public market was 6.6 miles. This is shown in Table Y. 
The range in distance was from 1 to 25 miles. 

Table VI lists the vegetables produced and the number of 
operators included in the survey who were producing each. Ten out 
of 14 operators were producing potatoes for sale. The average 
acres grown per operator was 2.8; the range of acreage planted per 
operator was from 0.5 to 8.0 acres. It may be safely stated that 
the range wouldbe greater than this if more operators had been 
included in the survey. 1 

In a second survey 2 (4) it was found that 11 out of 11 opera¬ 
tors grew potatoes for sale. The average for 10 growers was 4.5 
acres and the average production was 174.5 bushels per acre. See 
Table VII. The year 1935 was a normal production year so that 


1 The author has for eight summers inspected for the Dominion Depart¬ 
ment of Agriculture fields of certified seed potatoes. A personal 
knowledge of potato growing would allow one to agree that an 
average of 2.8 acres might be representative of the amount grown 

by specialist market gardeners but not by farmers. Many farmers 
in this district regularly plant from 20 to 40 or more acres of 
potatoes. 

2 This survey, conducted in September 1934? was made at the 
holdings of 11 Edmonton market gardeners. The data is summarized 

in Table VII.

this is likely to be a fairly close figure of the general average 
yield per acre. 

Spg.o i ja. l .i zat ,i, o , n . 

So far as is known there are no growers who specialize only 
in potato production. Certain growers however specialize in 
certain varieties and supply these to particular trades. Practi¬ 
cally all growers plant at least two varieties, an early and a 
late. The early variety is harvested for summer sale and the 
late is stored for winter sale. 

It was learned (6) that a local grower commenced in the spring 
of 1935 to produce extra early new potatoes by planting sprouted 
sets. This made it possible for him to have new potatoes ready 
for sale several weeks before other producers and to compete on 
the market with British Columbia new potatoes which arrive about 
June 1. The date that this grower started marketing was not 
obtained, but the nature of our climate under normal conditions 
makes it not likely to mature potatoes for profitable sale before 
July 1. This grower operated on sufficient scale “to force down 
the price of new potatoes from British Columbia. 11 It is likely 
that other growers will adopt the same practice in order to compete 
for earlier sale. The practicability of the method can only be 
estimated after several years 1 test. 

Seasonal Movement of Potatoes to Market . 

New, local grown potatoes normally arrive on the market from 
July 1 to July lj>. The date depends on growing conditions and 
the date of spring planting. Some growers, because of more favor-

able soil, are able to market earlier than others. The volume 
of movement of new potatoes increases from about July 1 and con¬ 
tinues until price falls to the point where growers prefer to 
leave the crop to harvest for storage. A more detailed discussion 
on potatoes will be given in a later section on price. 

Annual Va_riatiQii s -in Production . 

Annual variations in production occur for the two reasons 
discussed in the preceding section; namely voluntary and involun¬ 
tary. Both of these factors have acted in this district but no 
statistics can be presented to show the changes. 

A study of wholesale price records 1 showed that for 2 of the 
6 years from 1929 to 1939 old potatoes were shipped to Edmonton; 
for 3 years out of 6 Edmonton grown were quoted for 12 months each 
year; and for 3 years out of 6 they were quoted for 11 months each 
year. It is safe to assume under normal conditions that Edmonton 
grown potatoes are available for 12 months each year. Wholesale 
price records indicate that Edmonton imports new potatoes during 
June and July. 

Voluntary and Involuntary Changes in Production . 

No comparative figures of actual changes in acreage planted 
can be given but it was generally admitted by men interviewed that 
there have been annual changes. In 1929 there was a general short-

ment Fruit and Vegetable Inspector. Any mention in this chapter 
of wholesale records, unless otherwise indicated, refers to these.

age, which resulted in a strong price throughout the season. 

This led to an increase in acreage in 1930* The fall in the 
price of other agricultural commodities caused farmers to grow 
more potatoes in response to the comparatively higher prices for 

this product. The increased acreage and heavier yields caused 

production 

a heavy surplus/of potatoes in 1933* There has been a decline 
in production since that time but it was not determined whether 
this was caused by a decrease in planting or yields. There was 
a heavy decrease in yields in 1933 , caused mainly by a severe 
frost in the third week of August. 

Lg R g J&P -Tg nA e pc j. o f J ftftflUQtiqn . 

It may be assumed that Edmonton is normally self-supporting 
in potatoes. The quantity shipped from the district is relatively 
small, as markets are very uncertain and casual. A few carloads 
may be shipped each year to places where there is a shortage. 

So far as could be determined no quantity of importance is shipped 
from this district to outside the province. The absence of an 
outside market has prevented production expanding beyond the need 
of Edmonton or other urban centres in the marketing shed. 

Type and duality of Potatoes Grown . 

various 

The three main types grown are 7 white and red varieties, and 
the Netted Gem. This latter is a variety of smooth oval shape 
particularly suited to baking. It is very popular as a late 
variety because of its unsurpassed keeping quality. The production 
in the past few years was definitely increased in response to

a price premium offered by consumers (2)* The Edmonton climate 
is somewhat uncertain for this variety because of its lateness. 

Dry conditions in August or an early frost may reduce the yields 
and the size of the tubers. Most growers now plant several 
varieties which include Netted Gem. In Southern Alberta, where 
irrigation is the general practice, it is grown almost exclusively* 
Two market-men (2) interviewed stated their firms were now able 
to buy sufficient high quality Netted Gem potatoes because of 
expansion in production. No Netted Gem potatoes are imported to 
Edmonton. 

The quality of local potatoes was stated to be good. All 
potatoes sold have to be graded and are subject to inspection (6). 
This and severe competition keeps the quality high. 

There is one important improvement in potato production that 
could be made; this is, a decrease in the number of varieties 
grown. At present each grower has a variety preference which 
is often based on prejudice. Because of the many varieties ,f it 
is difficult to obtain a carload of one variety 11 (6). 

The Edmonton potato producers could improve production by 
deciding to grow only two or three varieties most suited to the 
soil and climate and the market demand. It would then be easier 
to offer bulk shipments of one variety when an outside market 
was available. 


Cabbage .

therefore produced for sale by practically all market gardeners 
and many farmers. The farmer type producer has gone into this 
vegetable mostly since 1929 and 1950 when comparatively high 
prices prevailed. The production fringe is about 20 miles from 
Edmonton. (4), (5), (6 ). 

Table VI shows that 10 operators out of 14 questioned on the 
Edmonton public market sold cabbages in 1935 and 1934. The average 
acreage grown was 1 and the average yield per acre was 4 tons. 

The average amount produced per operator was 3.2 tons. 

Data from the second survey (4) showed 11 out of 11 operators 
questioned produced cabbage for sale. The average production 
of these operators was 8 tons; the average yield 1.4 tons; and the 
average production per acre in 1933 was 4.3 tons. See Table VIX» 

Specialization of. Proauction . 

So far as was determined no operators specialize only in 
cabbage production. It is normally grown in addition to other 
crops by both farmers and market gardeners. 

S e ^^o n .al, M o x ^mts. P XJI &k b. a ,g&. 

Wholesale price records show local cabbage to have been on 
sale in Edmonton practically 12 months for each of the years 1932 
to 1934 inclusive. For the six years 1929-1935 local cabbage 
was on sale for 6 to 12 months each year. Edmonton grown new 
cabbage normally commences sale about July 13 and continues until 
the following May. Some growers have a supply after this, but 
the quantity of satisfactory quality is limited. The movement

of cabbage to the market is fairly constant except when interrupted 
by stormy or low temperature weather in the winter* It was learned 
(6) that growers are inclined to become panicky for various 
reasons about selling their stock of store vegetables and will 
often suddenly increase their supply offerings. 

In the last few years farmers and unemployed producers who 
have no storage facilities are reported (6) to have increased the 
supply offered in the fall months. 

ArattftLXQJ Ci . a . t Ao n i .n ^P y o d ^t i o& . 

A study of wholesale prices and the length of time cabbage was 
on sale indicates that production in the Edmonton district was 
light in 1929 and 1950 but has since been sufficient to supply the 
complete demand for store cabbage. No annual comparison of yields 
or amount planted can be given but sufficient evidence (6) (7) was 
obtained to conclude that the number of producers has increased 
since 1929* This was induced by comparatively high prices at that 
time. 

The volume for sale may vary each year due to growing conditions* 
insect injury, and storage depreciation. Fluctuating storage 
temperatures induce severe deterioration of storage cabbage. Fear 
of deterioration is one of the chief reasons for growers becoming 
panicky at intervals (6).

There is no certain outside market for local grown cabbage 
and therefore it is unlikely that there will be any definite 
change in the quantity produced. The past tendency has been to

quality. 

The quality of local grown cabbage was reported to be very 
good. Local grown new cabbage is superior to imported because 
the latter under-goes some depreciation in transit and in storage. 
There is normally a gradual depreciation in the quality of stored 
cabbage. 

"The grade of local grown cabbage is equal to that from other 
sources". ( 6 ), ( 2 ).

With the exception of turnips and carrots, these vegetables 
are grown mostly by gardeners, as they are more difficult to handle 
and therefore require more specialized care. Turnips and carrots 
are extensively grown by gardeners and farmers. Table VI shows 
that 10 out of 14 operators grev/ carrots; the average amount pro¬ 
duced was 5.8 tons. The average planted was 0.8 acres and the 
average yield in 1933 was 1 .Z tons per acre. In the second survey, 
(see Table VII at end of chapter) 11 out of 11 operators reported 
on carrots. The average acreage planted by six operators was 1.0 
and the average yield was 6.3 tons per acre. The average amount 

produced by ten operators was 6.3 tons. Seven out of 11 growers

questioned grew beets; the average amount grown by 6 operators 
was tons. Table VII. 

Insufficient data was obtained to give this information for 
the other vegetables. 

The fringe of production of turnips and carrots is about 
20 miles whereas beets and parsnips, which are generally produced 
only by specialist gardeners are grown mostly within about seven 
miles radius. (6), (5)* 

Edmonton soil ana climate is well suited to these vegetables. 

Wholesale records show that British Columbia store carrots 
were sold in Edmonton through the market season of 1929 - 30 . No 
records of sale of imported stored vegetables in this group was 
found after 1?2?. 

Seasonal Movements to Market . 1 

Local carrots start to arrive on the market about June 1J? and 
remain on sale until June and July of the following year. The 
dates vary with spring growing conditions, and storage temperatures 
over winter. 

New beets are offered by Edmonton growers about June lj> to 
July 1 and are usually exhausted by June 1 of the following year. 

New turnips are first sold about July 1 to July lj? and remain 
on sale until the following June. 

New carrots, turnips, and beets are sold first in bunches with 
the tops attached. Later in the season when more mature the tops

are removed and they are sold in a measured quantity, (6), (7). 

Parsnips are somewhat different in seasonal movement from the 
other vegetables. They are a fall and winter vegetable and are 
therefore not popular as a fresh vegetable (6). The first sales 
start about August but they are not sold extensively until about 
September. Parsnips are difficult to keep because they dry and 
shrivel easily in storage. Because of rapid deterioration the 
length of the marketing season varies with storage conditions, but 
it generally does not last beyond January. 

Local grown are practically the only parsnips sold in Eamonton 

( 6 ). 

Annual Variations in Production 

No data were obtained to show changes in annual production, 
but it is safe t.o say the quantity varies. There was a general 
shortage of local grown vegetables in 1929 and the high prices 
caused expansion of production(6). There was a heavy surplus of 
the 1935 crop unmarketed by the spring of 1934, (4), (5)* It 
was learned in a survey (8) to estimate available stock of vege¬ 
tables in January 1935? that the majority of growers did not expect 
a surplus in 1935* Prices were reported to be sLightly advanced 
over 1933-34, which would indicate that the volume produced in 
1934 had decreased from 1935* It cannot be stated here whether 
this was from a decrease in planting or in yields or to both 
factors. 

Production of carrots, turnips, parsnips and beets has evi¬ 
dently expanded with the increase in consumption requirements of

the district. Edmonton producers do not generally expect to sell 
in markets outside the shed hut due to dry conditions the provincial 
government has purchased some vegetables in the last few years for 
outside sale. These shipments were only casual and the price 
received was comparatively low, therefore Edmonton growers are not 
likely to produce more than is normally needed for local require¬ 
ments. 

. toa lity. 

The quality of carrots, turnips, beets and parsnips grown in 
the Edmonton district was reported to be high (6). Severe compe¬ 
tition insures the grade normally offered to be high. There is 
generally a gradual depreciation in storage throughout the winter, 
and a relatively rapid depreciation when spring temperatures raise 
the storage temperatures. The degree of winter depreciation varies 
according to the fluctuation of external temperatures about the 
root house. "Because our winter temperatures vary greatly, the 
grower is unable to estimate accurately how much of the amount put 
into the cellar he will be able to preserve for sale", (7)*

remains on the market until about Christmas.' 1 ' Because of severe 
storage depreciation it will not generally keep beyond this date 
( 6 ). 

Practically all the local grown cauliflower is sold by the 
growers at the Edmonton public market or direct to the retailers. 
“The local wholesalers do not handle 1/5 of the local cauliflower” 
( 6 ). 

Aaaaai .laxiaiisaa Ja 

A study of the dates on which local grown cauliflower are last 
quoted each year in wholesale price records would indicate that 
there is a yearly variation in the amount offered for sale. The 
following are the dates of the last wholesale quotations of 
Edmonton produced cauliflower:- October 1, 1929; October 18, 1930; 
December 26, 1931; October 29, 1932; and November 18, 1933. These 
figures would indicate that the local supply is unstable, but in¬ 
sufficient infomation was obtained to give the causes. Two 
important reasons would be weather conditions in the late summer, 
and storage temperatures influencing depreciation.

There are two classes of tomatoes produced in/ Edmonton district 
these are field, which are marketed green, and hot-house, which are 
usually sold when ripe or at the ripening stage. The climate 
here is normally unsuitable for ripening tomatoes in the field. 

Field tomatoes are therefore sold principally for pickling

purposes (6),(2). 

Field tomatoes are grown in addition to other crops almost 
exclusively by specialized gardeners. No figures were obtained 
of the extent of production. It was estimated that there are 
approximately 20 t^ 0 operators of green-houses who are offering 
hot-house tomatoes to Edmonton stores, (2). 

It is estimated that British Columbia supplies 95*}, of the 
fresh tomatoes sold in Edmonton (6). This would indicate local 
production is quite limited. 

Seasonal Movements of Tomatoes . 1, 

Field tomatoes are sold by local growers in August and early 
September. The length of the season depends on the first date of 
a killing fall frost. 

Hot-house tomatoes are sold at two periods. Most green¬ 
houses are closed when winter temperatures commence and are not 
opened until late February or March. Seedlings are planted at 
this time to mature ripe tomatoes for sale in May, June and July. 
When the crop is removed at this time new seedlings are planted 
to produce fruit for sale in September and November. 

Annual Variations in Production . 

The quantity of field tomatoes varies very greatly with 
seasonal growing conditions. This is a delicate plant and there¬ 
fore highly subject to frost injury. 

Insufficient information was available to give any statis¬ 
tical data on annual changes in production of field or hot-house 
tomatoes.

It was pointed out by market men that there has been an increase 
in tomato production in this district during the last five years. 

The greatest increase has been since the 1930 tariff change. There 
has been a tendency in the last 4 to 3 years for market gardeners 
to construct more green-houses. These are used for growing bedding 
plants and when these are removed the green-house is used for tomato 
culture. 

The local producer does not have an exclusive market at any 
period from British Columbia or foreign tomatoes. The tariff 
on foreign tomatoes has been lowered after about November 1 until 
local and British Columbia grown are again ready for market in May 
or June (6). It would appear that some local growers have been 
able to compete with British Columbia producers during May, June 
and July. This was evidently because of freight rates, tariff 
protection given to British Columbia producers, and quality of the 
local product. 

downward 

There has been a/change in tariff policy in 193&, so it is 
not possible to comment here on what this will do to the recent 
tendency of increased tomato production in this district. 

The quality of local hot-house tomatoes is reported to be 
superior to either British Columbia field or hot-house (2). This 
is because both kinds have to be shipped green and ripened in 
storage at Edmonton. Local hot-house tomatoes are ripened on the 
vine, which results in a superior quality. A second reason local 
hot-house tomatoes are favored is that a portion of the peduncle

may be left attached, which gives a more attractive appearance 
and assists in selling. The quality is sufficiently superior 
to induce local consumers to pay a premium.

The production of onions is quite limited as the local grown 
are only suitable for summer sale. Onions are a very difficult 
vegetable to store unless brought to the proper stage of maturity. 
Apparently our season is too short to develop them to the stage 
where they can be dry cured for winter storage. It is also 
difficult to store them in local root houses as these are too damp. 
Conditions suitable to other vegetables are unsuitable for storing 
onions. A few local growers have, during the last few years, cured 
a small quantity which they sell on the city public market. n How¬ 

ever, the quantity is too insignificant to be of any importance 
to the market. Edmonton wholesalers have never bought a sack of 
local grown dried onions’ 1 , (6). 

Some onions are grown for summer sale but do not have an 
exclusive market. British Columbia onions were quoted on Edmonton 
wholesale price records for out of 52 weeks, and foreign grown 
for 50 out of J?2 weeks of the year.

vidually but they are of less importance to the market. Those 
considered comprise most of the storage vegetables. Such vegetables 
as green peas, beans, corn, cucumbers, radishes, spinach etc. are 
ordinarily sold by market gardeners during the summer months. 

Some of the more delicate of these are rather uncertain because of 
early frosts or other unfavorable weather. The supply offered 
may be abundant one year and relatively scarce the next. Corn and 
beans are definitely in this class. 

The volume of all vegetables produced varies very greatly 
from year to year, depending chiefly on growing conditions. Because 
of the increase in the number of producers during the last four 
years the supply offered of summer vegetables has been very heavy, 

(6), (7). 

Quality . 

In general practically all Edmonton grown fresh vegetables are 
superior to imported, as they can be sold directly from the field, 
and thus the natural freshness is preserved. The severity of 
competition forces all producers to offer generally a high grade 
product. 


Small Fruits . 

The follov/ing small fruits are produced in a small quantity 
and sold in Edmonton:- strawberries, raspberries, gooseberries, 
blueberries, plums and crabapples, (2). The supply is very small 
and uncertain. In 1933 the average proportion that was locally

grown was less than 4^ of the total small fruit sold by Edmonton 
retail stores. Cranberries and blueberries are the only small 
fruits that have an exclusive market, while they are available. 
Local grown strawberries are offered during July, August and part 
of September. The quality of these is somewhat lower than British 
Columbia berries, but they have an advantage in freshness. 

The supply of local grown berries varies mostly from changes 
in growing conditions between years. These are mostly from 
perennial plants and therefore the acreage grown does not vaiy 
muoh from one year to the next, but may change over several years. 

The uncertainty of local growing conditions when the plants 
are in bloom or the fruit is setting makes the supply unstable (2), 
(6). Practically all small fruits are grown in abundance in 
British Columbia and sell very cheap on the Edmonton market (6). 
Because of the uncertainty of local conditions and British Columbia 
competition, local production is likely to continue to be minor. 

Edmonton Supplies from Districts in .Alberta 

Other Than Edmonton. 2 

It has not beenpossible to determine quantitatively what fruits 
and vegetables produced in other Alberta districts are sold in 
Edmonton. No other records are kept except the car-load arrivals 
of fruits and vegetables which are reported to the Dominion 
Government Fruit and Vegetable Inspector. This record therefore

does not include all that is imported as commodities arrive by- 
truck, express, and with other freight shipments. 

It was reported (6) that some hot-house tomatoes and com on 
the cob, grown in the Medicine Hat ana Lethbridge districts, have 
been sold in Edmonton in the last few years* Records'*’ also show 
a few oarloads of onions from these districts. 

The irrigated districts of southernAlberta have in the last 
ten years produced more summer green and storage vegetables. This 
expansion of production has continued until supplies from the 
irrigated districts in particular have largely displaced British 
Columbia products on the Lethbridge, Calgary and Medicine Hat 
markets. It is practically as easy for supplies to reach Edmonton 
from British Columbia as it is from the south of the province, so 
that the expansion, as yet, has not affected the Edmonton market. 

There are no other districts in Alberta, other than the 
irrigated areas in the south, that produce fruits or vegetables in 
any quantity. There are a few nurseries, located at various points 
in the province, which sell fruit bushes and landscape plants. 

These nurseries sell some ripe fruit to the adjacent small centres 
but, so far as was determined, do not ship to any extent to the 
cities. 

It would seem unlikely there will be any significant increase 
in the importation of supplies from other districts in Alberta to 
the Edmonton market as "Edmonton is the largest vegetable producing 
centre in Alberta", (6). British Columbia growers are generally 
able to get their new vegetables on the market at least two weeks

to a month before any Alberta district. Trade connections are 
well established with British Columbia shippers who offer a high 
grade product suitable to Edmonton consumers. Local supplies 
displace these as the growing season advances. It would therefore 
appear that the same sources will continue to supply the market 
except in abnormal years.

CHAPTER V. 

DOMESTIC. aND FOREIGN*SOURCES OF SUPPLY 

m u 1 

go urog , §M . Quantity . 

British Columbia is the most important domestic source of 
supply for the Edmonton market. This is shown in Table VIII. 

The carload arrivals of fruit and vegetables from British Columbia 
since 1930 have been more than the total from all other sources; 
in 1933 and 1934 they were about double <> The arrivals from this 
source increased after 1930 and during the same period, 1930 - 1934 , 
there has been a decrease in the number of cars imported from 
foreign countries. The implementing of increased tariffs in 1930 
was likely partially responsible. 

Table IX shows that Edmonton imports from British Columbia 
include practically all classes of fruits and vegetables. Other 
kinds not listed may be included in the carloads of mixed produce. 

Edmonton imports from Canadian provinces other than British 
Columbia are only occasional. Table VIII shows that 8 l carloads 
of potatoes came from Eastern Canada in 1929. This was because 


^Domestic supplies mean any part of Canada with the exception 
of Alberta. Foreign means any foreign country. In most 
cases it may be assumed it means the United States, as only 
a relatively small quantity of fruit or vegetables is purchased 
from any other foreign country. 

^ The information for this chapter was obtained from records kept 
by the Dominion Government Fruit and Vegetable Inspector and 
verbal information given by the Inspector.

of a partial crop failure in the Edmonton district. Under normal 
conditions practically no vegetables, except an occasional shipment 
of storage cabbage from Manitoba or Ontario, come to Edmonton from 
Canadian sources other than British Columbia. 

Considering fruit, grapes are the principal imports from 
Eastern Canada; these coming mostly from Ontario. There were, 
from 1927 to 1932 no carload arrivals of grapes from British 
Columbia, although these may have come by express or in carloads 
of mixed fruit. Other fruits received from Ontario in small 
quantities are apples, blueberries, cherries, plums, and a few 
others. The arrivals of these are very small in volume compared 
with those from British Columbia. 

The third important source of supply of fruits and vegetables 
is the United States. The largest quantity of these from a 
foreign source come from California. 1 In 1934, of the 371 carloads 
imported from foreign countries 233 came from California. (See 
Table IX for other comparisons.) The most important single 
commodity from California was oranges, which comprised 91 of the 
233 carloads. This was apparently the only source of oranges in 
1934 except for 1 carload from Australia and 28 carloads from Japan. 

Mexico is the most important foreign source of tomatoes. 

Field tomatoes from this source are followed by supplies from 


1 ”In the Pacific fruit belt, stretching from the famous Imperial 
Valley in Southern California to the Okanagan in British Columbia, 
almost every conceivable fruit is produced. From this prolific 
belt of fruitlands the consumers of the prairies obtain seven- 
eighths of their requirements.” J.M. Cassels - ”Fruit Distribu¬ 
tion in Western Canada”. Jour, of Pol. Ec. Vol. 37, 1929*

California and Mississippi. There are no hot-house tomatoes 
reported from a foreign country. 

In 1934 twelve states are listed as having shipped fruits or 
vegetables to Edmonton. With the exception of three, all of these 
are coastal states and extend from Washington, contiguous to British 
Columbia on the west coast, to Massachusetts, one of the northern 
states on the east coast. The three inland states were Arizona, 
Tennessee and Arkansas. These supplied, respectively, lettuce, 
sweet potatoes, and strawberries. The far eastern state of 
Massachusetts in 1934 supplied three carloads of cranberries. 
Cranberries and strawberries are now the only small fruits imported 
in quantity from a foreign source (1),(6). Since 1931 British 
Columbia has supplied the largest amount of small fruit whereas 
from 1927 to 1931 the U.S.A. supplied more carloads. See Table VIII. 

The foreign countries, other than the United States of America, 
shipping fruit or vegetables to Edmonton in 1934 were Spain, 1 car¬ 
load of onions; Australia, 4 carloads of onions and 1 carload of 
oranges; and Japan, 28 carloads of Japanese oranges. The latter 
are a particular grade of orange. 

The quantity and the class of commodities from each source, 
domestic and foreign, varies each year, due to several factors, the 
most important of which are relative prices and amount of supply. 

Seasonal Movement of Supplies . 

Supplies from each source, sold on the Edmonton market, follow 
each other in a natural order according to the seasonality of 
production. If the calendar year is used, the order of sources

supplying the market would be foreign, domestic, and local. This 
order applies only to commodities produced by the three sources 
and which come into competition as the season advances. Certain 
commodities are supplied entirely by local growers, others by local 
and British Columbia producers, a few fruits by the United states 
or Foreign countries only, and the majority of vegetables, at least, 
by all three sources. The length and dates of supply period there- 
fore varies from each source according to the class of commodity. 

Commodities of one sort or other from British Columbia are on 
sale in Edmonton throughout the year. Apples are the most import¬ 
ant single item on sale continuously. 

The first small fruits sold are strawberries, which arrive 
from the southern States about March. These continue on sal© in 
small quantities until the British Columbia strawberries arrive 
about June. 

New fresh vegetables from the United States commence sale in 
Edmonton about January ana continue until they are displaced by 
British Columbia vegetables which commence sale about April. Most 
summer vegetables from British Columbia do not arrive until June. 
Practically all classes of new vegetables from British Columbia and 
certain classes from the United States are sold to Edmonton consumers 
several weeks to several months before local produce is ready. 

There is usually a short period of overlapping when foreign supplies 
and British Columbia are on sale at the same time, and the same 
before British Columbia are displaced by local grown. The length 
of the overlapping varies between years and between different com¬ 
modities. Fresh vegetables from foreign or domestic producers

compete from about January with local storage vegetables. The 
customer thus has the choice of purchasing new or storage vegetables 
such as turnips, carrots, beets, cabbage, and potatoes. 

The date of the first and last quotations of new vegetables 
from a foreign or domestic source varies somewhat each year depending 
on prices, demand, the extent of local supply of old vegetables, 
and on the date the supplying districts have produce ready for 
sale. 1 

The seasons when foreign and domestic producers supply tomatoes 
are somewhat different from those of other vegetables because of 
the two classes, namely, hot-house and field. No hot-house toma¬ 
toes are brought from foreign sources. The first foreign field 
tomatoes come about November 1 from Mexico. Supplies from this 
source therefore replace British Columbia hot-house tomatoes which 
are on sale during October and part of November. Tomatoes from 
Mexieo are followed by supplies from California and Mississippi. 

These continue on sale until replaced in May and June by local and 
British Columbia hot-house tomatoes. British Columbia hot-house 
are displaced by field tomatoes from this source during July, 

August and September. 

The months of heaviest importations of fruit to Edmonton are 
usually August, September and October. This is illustrated in 
Table X which shows the monthly arrivals for 1933 which was arbit¬ 
rarily used as an example year. In 1933 the monthly arrivals of

fruit during the three months mentioned more than doubled other 
months. This is to be expected because these are the harvest 
months for most British Columbia fruits. Many fruits have to be 
marketed immediately because of unsuitability to storage. This 
is also the home canning season. 

Table X shows that in 1933 the smallest receipts of vegetables 
were in November, December, January and February. This is the 
season when new vegetables are most difficult to obtain and are 
at the highest price. Local storage vegetables fill most of the 
demand in these months. 

Stability of Domestic and Foreign Supplies. 1 

In general it is possible to obtain supplies each succeeding 
year from the same source. Variations in the supply offered 
(schedule sense) vary from year to year, but sufficient may be 
obtained if a satisfactory price is offered. Each source usually 
offers supplies at the same period each succeeding year. It is 
only in exceptional years that it is necessary to find supplies 
from a new source. Yfholesalers seemed to be quite emphatic that 
there is generally stability in the domestic and foreign supplies 
offered.

duality of Domestic and Foreign Su-polies .

and severe seller competition, insures the consumer of a high grade

product. Because of long established grade standards there is not 
much variation in quality from year to year. This is generally 
true, but for certain commodities and certain shipments there may be 
a variation in quality. This may be due to variation in grading, 
stage of maturity of produce when shipped, origin of shipment, 
growing conditions, depreciation in transit or storage, etc. There 
is often depreciation and shrinkage of goods which are shipped too 
immature. Improper packing of freight cars may also cause depre¬ 
ciation, but railways, producers, and distributors are usually very 
particular about this. Moaern refrigeration for summer shipments 
and control of car temperatures in the winter have vastly improved 
in the last decade so that now "vegetables will arrive as fresh as 
when taken from the field" (6). 

The quality of products usually varies directly with the 
distance transported. Usually the goods that have the farthest 
to come spend the most time in transit and therefore suffer the 
most depreciation. The stage of maturity when packed for shipment 
is important in determining what the conditions will be on arrival. 
The more immature the greater the depreciation that takes place 
in transit. Fruit has to be shipped green to arrive in proper 
condition for sale. Unless it is at the correct stage when 
packed the grade may have seriously depreciated by the time it 
arrives or before it can be sold. Occasionally a delay in transit 

gives rise to lower grades for these shipments. Marketing faci¬ 
lities and organizations have become very specialized and in spite 
of from £00 to several thousand miles shipments ordinarily arrive 
in good condition. Because of variations in the stage of maturity

when shipped it does not always hold that quality varies with 
distance. 

Comparison of duality from Different Sources . 

Market men (1) were asked to compare the quality of foreign 
fruit and vegetables with the same commodities from domestic 
sources. Men interviewed expressed the opinion that commodities 
from the United States were superior to domestic. This was said 
to apply to practically all imports except apples. British 
Columbia apples were said to be better than apples from any other 
source. 

The chief reason given for the superiority of American products 
was that it was due to better packing and grading. Severe compe¬ 
tition and rigid grading forces shippers to grade closely and pack 
in containers suitable to the Edmonton or other trade. Another 
reason given for the superiority of United States produce was the 
more mature stage when shipped. British Columbia shippers were 
said to attempt to get their produce on the market too early and in 
order to do so ship immature stock which is relatively lower in 
quality. 

These statements do not seem to be in entire agreement with an 
earlier study. 1 A British Columbia Marketing Act passed in 1927 
allowed for the setting up of a Committee of Direction. One of 
the functions of the committee was to regulate the quality of ship¬ 
ments. "The committee forbade the shipment of fruit until it was 
properly mature on the trees. It insisted upon good weight in

every package and at no time did it allow the small sizes to be 
put on the market. 11 ^ 

An attempt was made to determine from market-men (1) why more 
fruit from the eastern provinces of Canada was not sold in Edmonton. 
The men agreed that distance, because of time in transit and cost 
of transport, was an important limiting factor. A more important 
reason expressed was that the eastern shippers do not cater to the 
Edmonton trade in grade offered or method of packing. The method 
of packing and the grade were said to be inferior to British 
Columbia or United States products. When it was suggested that 
the difference in distance between British Columbia and the eastern 
provinces of Canada lowered the grade in transit the buyers stated 
they considered the quality offered from the point of shipment 
inferior. 

It was the opinion that the eastern trade had failed to 
modernize its methods of grading, packing and preserving, and for 
this reason was unable to compete. ?^hen it was suggested that 
the western demand was insufficient to warrant the cost of adopting 
methods suitable for the trade the answer received was that "The 
demand existed if changes were made".

CHAPTER VI. 

PRICES OP FRUIT AND VEGETABLES . 


This chapter will discuss a study made of the price trends 
of four vegetables sold on the Edmonton market from April 192? 
to April 1935 and, from this and other information, set forth some 
general comments on the prices of fruits and vegetables. 

In order to obtain some statistical data on prices of vegetables 
over a period of years, price records were taken from the Dominion 
Government record of prices from April 1?29 to April I 935. 1 It 
was decided to use the prices of four comparatively stable food 
vegetables that would be fairly typical of general market price 
trends. For this reason cabbage, celery, head lettuce and potatoes 
were selected. These four vegetables are grown by local, domestic 
and foreign producers, all of whom supply the Edmonton market during 
particular periods of the year. There is usually some overlapping 
as the supply changes from one source to another. At certain 
periods supplies from the three sources are on sale at the same 
time. Also fresh vegetables during certain periods are on sale 
in competition with storage vegetables. To some extent the influ- 

1 The record of prices kept by the Dominion Government Fruit and 
Vegetable Inspector consists of the daily high and low wholesale 
and retail prices for commodities on sale each day. The whole¬ 
salers forward to the inspector’s office a list of commodities 
with the prices at which they have been sold. The retail prices 
are less accurate as they are the general going price, rather 
than actual prices received. The government record was the only 
price data for Edmonton that could be obtained. None of the 
wholesale or retail stores, so far as could be determined, keep 
on hand a record of prices or volume of sales.

enoe on price of supplies from nev; sources and the effect of new 
and old vegetables in competition may be seen from the price curves 
shown on plates I, II, III and IV at the end of this chapter. 

It is necessary to point out, before discussing them, reasons 
for serious defects in these price curves. The prices used were 
the high daily wholesale and retail quotations for the 1st and ljjth 
of each month. When these dates were on a Sunday or holiday the 
prices for the Saturday or day previous were used. It was con¬ 
sidered that the high quotations if used throughout would be more 
representative than an average of the high and low. These prices 
however may have been those received for particular sales of a 
special grade and therefore not representative of other sales. 

Also no data on the volume of sales at each price were given, and 
therefore the prices could not be weighted. Price curves construc¬ 
ted from such data are moreover unsatisfactory in judging actual 
market trends in that they do not show the quantity sold. 

The curves show the spread between the high retail and high 
wholesale price. However, it is not safe to conclude that this 
is representative of the actual spread because of the lack of data on 
quantity sold at the high retail and high wholesale price. A 
greater quantity may have been sold at lower prices when the spread 
may have been less. 

There have been many factors which have acted on the prices 
of the vegetables used in this study, so it therefore cannot be 
assumed that they are entirely typical of the trend of vegetable 
prices, but merely an indication. The supply of local, domestic 
and foreign offerings varies from year to year. The demand may

also vary from year to year* Again the demand curve, if it were 
known, for any one of these vegetables, potatoes, carrots, cabbage 
and celery, might have peculiarities not typical of other vegetables. 
The general decline of all prices with the depression has influenced 
the prices of these vegetables as have also changes in consumers 1 
demand due to decline in income and other reasons. Tariffs also 
have influenced the prices of all vegetables. 

The curves show when the commodities were listed in wholesale 
and retail reports but they do not indicate the complete time local 
vegetables were on sale. This is because local wholesalers do note 
start to handle the local grown vegetables until they have been on 
sale for several weeks. The first sales are made direct by the 
grower to the consumer at the public market, by house canvass, or 
by direct orders from the consumers. When sales by these methods 
become sluggish the retailer is canvassed and later the wholesaler. 

No quotations were given when the wholesaler was not handling a 
commodity. 

The limitations just outlined of the data should be kept in 
mind when studying the charts and in reading the discussion on the 
prices of each vegetable.^

to April 1933 of old (storage) ana new potatoes from local, domestic 
and foreign sources,' 1 ' The chart is in two sections; the upper 
section shows the prices of local grown potatoes and the lower 
section shows the prices of domestic ana foreign potatoes* The 
chart shows the dates when each class of potato, from the three 
sources, was being sold by Edmonton wholesalers and retailers. 

The retailers actually sold for longer periods than the wholesalers, 
but price quotations were not available after the wholesale stopped. 

In April, May and June of 1929 chart I shows local ana domestic 
old potatoes, and foreign new, to have been on the market in compe¬ 
tition. The retail price for local and domestic old was practically 
the same. There was some difference at this period between the 
wholesale price of the local and domestic old, but the price of both 
rose at the same time. 

The market recoras showed in many instances that the retail 
price for Grades No. 1 and No. 2 was the same. An explanation 
obtained for this is that the retailer often has to grade No. 2 up 
to No. 1 when selling in small lots to the consumer. Often the 
consumers select for themselves, and in doing so choose the best, 

p 

making the grade purchasea equal to No. 1. This may be a partial 
explanation of the closer similarity of retail prices of domestic 
and local grown potatoes when there was a discrepancy between 
wholesale prices. Again the retail quotations were not always 
prices for the same goods as the wholesale quotations on the same 
day. 

1 Local refers to Edmonton marketing district; Domestic is any place 
in Canada; Foreign is any foreign country, but in the case of the 
four vegetables used it was the United States only.

The price was generally the highest when new vegetables first 
entered the market. The spread between wholesale and retail price 
also was usually greatest at this time. The wholesale price of 
foreign potatoes on April 1, 1929 , was $8.oo and the retail price 
at the same time was $15.00, or a spread of $7*00. On April 15, 

1929 the wholesale price for foreign new was still at $ 8 . 00 , but 
the retail price had declined to $ 12 . 50 , or, a spread of $ 4 . 50 . 

These prices continued for two months, except for a 50# decline 
in the wholesale price for May 15 , 192?, which rose again to $8.00 
for foreign new potatoes on June 1, 1929* On June 15, 1929, foreign 
and domestic new potatoes were both quoted at the same price. The 
chart shows that the change from foreign to domestic supplies took 
place at about this time as this was the last quotation in 1929 for 
foreign new potatoes. There was a sharp drop in the wholesale price 
of domestic new potatoes from $8.00 on June 15, 1929 to $4.50 on July 
1 , 1929 * The retail price fell at the same time from $ 12.00 to 
$8.00 per cwt. The spread between wholesale and retail prices 
generally tended to narrow as the price fell. 

The chart shows that local and domestic new potatoes were both 
quoted on August 1, 1929 at $4.50 wholesale. The two continued in 
competition for two weeks with the price declining. The domestic 
were off the market by September 1, and the price of local new had 
dropped to $5*50. While the domestic and local new potatoes were 
in competition the retail price for the two was the same and declined 
at the same rate. This was generally true for the 6 years studied. 

September 15 was taken as the arbitrary date each year to 
change from quoting the price of local new potatoes to old or storage.

The retail price for local grown potatoes from August 1929 
to September 1933 tended to be more erratic than the wholesale. 

This may have been exaggerated by using the high weekly prices. 
From September 1933 to April 1933 the wholesale price of local 
potatoes remained fairly steady between $0.60 and $1.00, and the 
retail price between f0.73 and $1.50. The spread between the 
two prices was more constant than during the earlier period. 

The chart showed that with the exception of two periods, June 
1 1929 and June 13, 1332, foreign grown new potatoes were at no 

time on actual sale in competition with domestic on the Edmonton 
market. On the first of these dates the foreign ana domestic 
retail quotations were the same. On the second date the foreign 
price was quoted $1.00 higher on the wholesale market than for 
domestic potatoes. No retail quotations were given on June 19, 
1932, therefore no comparison can be made. 

The chart indicates that foreign new potatoes are sold for 
only a short period each year. Table VIII, pages 77"78, shows 
the car arrivals to be very small. However, this is not a true 
representation of the quantity, as they also ccme in carloads of 
mixed vegetables. The retail and wholesale prices for foreign 
new potatoes ranged much higher than either domestic or local grown 
new potatoes. It may be concluded that the price descends from the 
first quotation for foreign new potatoes to the low when old local 
potatoes supply the market. 

The chart shows that from 1930 to April 1933 there were no 
quotations for domestic old potatoes. The local supply has 
apparently been adequate during the permod. Local grown old

potatoes were quoteu for 3 years out of 6 up to the time of the first 
wholesale quotations for new local potatoes. In the other three 
years the local grown old potatoes were off the market for one month 
before wholesale quotations were given for local new. During the 
intervening period domestic new potatoes were on sale, and it is 
likely local new were being sold at the public market. 

The price of potatoes was generally downward from April 1929 
to August 1932* The lowest prices for the six years were, accord¬ 
ing to records, from February 1932 to August 1932. Growers com¬ 
plained that 1933 was the worst year, but the chart would not indi¬ 
cate this. Tfeking the high quotations, however, may not represent 
the actual facts. 

The chart would indicate that there is a general tendency for 
the price of local potatoes to decline from the time the ne?/ crop 
is first quoted until the supply is exhausted and the new crop 
again commences sale, the following season. This was fairly 

definite for the first three years, April 1929 to July 1932, but 
was less definite for the latter period. When the price was low, 
it is difficult to notice from the chart a small change in price. 

In percentage of former price this may have been fairly great. 

During the period August 1932 to March 15, 1933 > the prices ranged 
lower throughout each year, and the wholesale-retail spread was 
narrower than during the preceding period. The prices of domestic 
and foreign potatoes did not show this decline and, in general, from 
1930 to 1935 maintained the same price level, varying to some extent 
each year, but not generally downward.

Cabbage from three sources is sold on the Edmonton market. 
These are local, domestic and foreign. Chart II shows the trend 
of the high bi-monthly wholesale and retail prices of cabbage from 
the three sources for the period April 1, 192? to April 1933* 

Local cabbage was the most important in supplying the demand 
as it was quoted from 7 to 11 months each year. The chart and 
Table VIII, pages 77-78, show that the car arrivals of cabbage 
decreased during the last four years studied. The car arrivals 
are not entirely reliable indications, as they are for cauliflower 
and cabbage and, in any case, do not include all the cabbage 
imported as it comes also in cars of mixed vegetables. The chart 
shows that foreign and domestic cabbage were quoted for shorter 
periods during the 3 years April 1932 to April 1933 than during 
the three years April 1929 to April 1932. 

In general domestic and foreign cabbage were in actual sale 
competition only for short periods. This was for about a month 
for each of 3 years out of 6, and for the other 3 years the foreign 
was off the market before the domestic was quoted. When they were 
on sale at the same time the prices were practically the same, but 
the price of domestic usually decreased in about two weeks to a 
month. It would seem that the decline in price with the entrance 
of domestic new cabbage forced the foreign off the market. 

In the same way that foreign cabbage was forced off the market 
by domestic cabbage, the latter gave place to lower priced local 
new cabbage. The first quotation for local cabbage was usually

the same as, or within $0.30 difference of the domestic. The 
price tended to descend progressively from the first quotation, at 
about February or March, for foreign new, to the fall quotations 
for local grown. The decline was usually in stages. 

There seemed to be a tendency for the price of local store 
cabbage to rise at about the same time as the higher priced foreign 
new came on sale. This higher price was maintained until the 
supply of old local grown was exhausted or consumers turned exclu¬ 
sively to the fresh supplies. The price rise was likely due to 
the decrease of local stocks and the high price of foreign new 
cabbage. The rise seemed to be in stages. Aftei? the first rise 
of |0.£0, which was maintained for two weeks to a month, there was 
a second rise of fO.30, This final price, which was about |1.00 
higher than the prevailing prices before the rise started, was 
maintained until the supply of old local cabbage was exhausted. 

The retail and wholesale price curves tended to follow each 
other consistently, but with slight erratic changes in one curve 
or the other at particular instances. These irregular fluctuations 
may have been particular sales as these were the daily high quo¬ 
tations, or interruptions in the regularity of volume of supply 
or demand may be the explanation (see chapter 4 page 52). No 
general change in the spread between wholesale and retail prices 
was noticed over the period studied. 

The price trend for local cabbage was generally downward over 
the period April 1929 to April 1935, but the greatest decline for 
local cabbage was from 1929 to 1931. The price curve remained 
fairly level after 1931 except for a I 0.30 decline in 1933 and 1934.

The increase in production of cabbage by farmers and unemployed 
is not apparent in the price chart, except that the marketing season 
was longer for local cabbage and the price was lower throughout 
the year than before 1931. The chart does show, however, that 
there was a slight tendency for the price of local cabbage to drop 
temporarily at about October and November for the years 1932 to 
1934 inclusive♦ This may have been because of increased offering 
by unemployed and farmers who had no storage (See chap. Ill, page 39) 
Two explanations for the relatively minor decline in price in the 
fall months when offerings were heaviest will be given later* 

Celery Prices. 1 

Chart III shows that local grown celery was sold by wholesalers 
for about five to six months each year. This may not be the com- 
plete time it was sold (see page 84). Retailers may have sold it 
for longer than the wholesalers, but retail prices were not quoted 
until the supplies of local celery were received from the whole¬ 
salers. 

The chart indicates that domestic and foreign celery sold for 
longer periods each year than local grown. This does not necessari¬ 
ly mean that more of what was consumed was from these sources. 

This could only be determined by a demand study or knowledge of 
the quantity consumed from each source. 

At no time was foreign new celery in direct sale competition 
with domestic or local celery. Foreign ana domestic celery each

had a distinct period when they were on sale. The foreign supply 
was replaced by domestic which was first quoted wholesale at a 
lower price than foreign for three' years out of six. For the other 
three years the first quotations for domestic were the same prices 
as the last quotations for foreign celery. These prices were 
maintained for a few reeks and then declined. The decline was not 
permanent, as the price of domestic usually rose again before it 
went off the market. The rise in most cases was not equal to the 
total decline. 

Local and domestic uelery were usually in active sale compe¬ 
tition for at least part of the time each was on the market. When 
the two were in actual sale competition the wholesale and retail 
quotations of both were identical. This would indicate that the 
consumer had no preference between the two , or that the supply 
prices were equal. The price of local celery continued to decline 
3 out of 6 years from the time it was first quoted until the supply 
was exhausted. 

There appeared to be no appreciable decline in celery prices 
over the six years, but there were variations between years. There 
was, i.e., a decline of $1.00 in the Y/holesale price of local new 
celery from 1929 to 1930* The retail prices between the same 
periods were from equal to $5*00 higher, the average retail price 
being about $2.30 higher in 1930. It appeared that the local crop 
was short in 1929, as it was only quoted for about 3 months, com¬ 
pared with 3 months in 1930. No explanation was found for the 
increase in the retail price of local celery in 1930 compared with 
1929. There was no increase in the retail price of domestic or

foreign for the same period. 

The price of local new celery was the same in 1931 as in 1930 
but stored celery went lower. The retail price was more erratic 
in 1931 than in 1930 and in one instance dropped below the whole¬ 
sale price. This may not have been representative of all retail 
prices of celery. 

The wholesale price of new local celery started $1.00 lower 
in 1932 than in 1931* Retail prices were practically the same but 
were not as erratic in 1932. The price of local new celery remained 
practically the same during 1932, 1933 snd 1934. 

The price of local celery declined from the first quotation, 
which was the seasontehigh, to the last quotation which was the 
season 1 s low, 3 years out of 6. The season’s decline for each of 

the six year periods was from about $1.00 to $4.30 per cwt. and 
the average decline was about $2.00. The highest wholesale quo¬ 
tation for local new celery was $ 8.00 in 1929 , and the lowest was 
$ 3.30 per cwt. in 1934. 

The wholesale price curves for the 6 year period appeared to 
have been more stable, but with a general decline in each season, 
than the retail prices curve. In a number of instances there were 
fluctuations in the retail prices contrary to wholesale prices 
(see i.e. domestic curves, 1929, 1931 and local 1931 ) • 

The price of domestic celery showed some decline over the 6 
years. The lowest price ranges were in 1932 and 1933* 

The price for new domestic celery decreased each year from 
the first quotations, which were the season’s high, to the lowest 
quotations, which occurred 3 years out of 6 just before it went

off the market. In 3 years out of the 6 there was an increase in 
price from the season's low just before it was replaced on the 
market by foreign celery at a higher price. The first quotation 
for foreign celery for 3 years out of 6 was higher than the last 
domestic wholesale price. 

In the case of local and domestic celery the highest wholesale 
price for the season was the first quotation when it came on the 
market. This price was usually maintained for two weeks to a 
month. In the case of foreign celery the curve shewed the highest 
seasonal quotation to have been on the date of the first quotation 
for only 2 years out of 6. The price tenaed to rise after it had 
been on sale for some time. 

The lowest price period of the year for celery in most cases 
was when local and domestic producers were supplying the market. 

This was usually from August to December or January. 

The price of foreign celery showed no definite trend over each 
season, but was generally unstable. In general there was no de¬ 
cline in the wholesale or retail price of foreign celery during the 
six years, April 1929 to April 1933. Prices for the months April 
to July of the years 1929 to 1950 were lower than prices for the 
same months in the four succeeding years. Ho evidence was obtained 
to show whether prices 2br foreign and domestic celery increased over 
the years previous to 1929 and 1950 . 

No definite evidence was found to explain why celery prices did 

not decrease with other vegetable prices after 1950. A partial 

explanation might be found from a study of demand curves for celery. 

It is likely that tariff increases in 193 oi and 1952 2 prevented to 

Increase in the general tariff on vegetables entering Canada 
from the united States.

some extent at least, a deoline in celery prices. It is estimated 
that local celery production has increased 100f o (6) since these 
duties became effective. The chart however shows that local celery 
is not on sale at the same period as foreign and storage depreci¬ 
ation is too great to extend the marketing perioa for local celery. 
It would seem that more is being consumed during the period local 
oelery is on sale. The absence of a decline in foreign and domes¬ 
tic celery prices would indicate that tariffs and possi. bly an in¬ 
crease in demand have kept domestic and local prices from falling. 
Table VIII, pages 77~78> shows that there was a decrease in the car 
arrivals of foreign and domestic celery from 1^32 to 1^34 inclusive. 

It was estimated that local wholesalers handle only 10f* to 20f o 
(6) of local grown celery and therefore the prices shown on Qhart III 
may not be a truerepresentation of those paid for local celery. 

Head Lettuce Prices ^ 

Chart IV. 

The wholesale price curves for local head lettuce are not 
considered very satisfactory because of difficulty in deriving a 
price unit, and only about lOf* (6) is sold through local wholesale 

p 

houses. 

The price of local head lettuce was the highest in 1?2? and 


when Canadian vegetables were available.

1930- The prices quoted showed a slight decline in the four 
succeeding years. It is not considered safe to make conclusions 
on the trend of local wholesale prices of lettuce, where records 
were available for only a minor amount sold. 

Lettuce prices decreased from the relatively higher prices for 

foreign grown to lower average prices fordomestic and from these to 

'I 

the lower ranges for locally produced. The first quotations each 
year for foreign lettuce were not the highest. Foreign lettuce 
usually came on sale in November and remained on the market until 
the following July. The highest prices for this were usually about 
April, May and, June. In most years foreign lettuce was in active 
sale competition with domestic for a few days to a month. In all 
cases when there was sale competition the wholesale price of domes¬ 
tic was less than the foreign. In some cases the retail prices 
of domestic and foreign lettuce were the same but in most cases, 
when the two were quoted at the same time, there was a difference. 

In the longer periods when the two were quoted at the same time, 
retail prices were identical. (See 193° and 1932.) 

The price of domestic lettuce usually declined continuously 
while it was on sale. 

The wholesale price of foreign lettuce did not appear to follow 
any particular trend each year, but was quite unstable. In three 
years out of six the price tended to rise over the period it was 
on sale and for the other three years it showed no general trend 
but was unstable. For two years out of six the first quotations 
for foreign lettuce were the low or practically the low for the 
season. (See 1931 and 1932.) It would seem that the price of

foreign lettuce was held down during October and November, either 
by competition with local or domestic or because supplies were more 
plentiful. 

The retail price of lettuce tended to follow the wholesale 
curve, but this was not consistent throughout. This was most 
noticeable for foreign lettuce. A small change in wholesale price 
would cause a relatively greater change in the retail price (See 
1930 and 1934). 

The chart would indicate that there was no perceptible change 
upward or downward in the long run price curve for foreign and 
domestic lettuce between the years 1929 to 1933 • 

General Conclusions from Price Study of Four Tegetables : 

1. Prices of local potatoes and cabbage declined after 193° and 
1931. The decline in local potato prices started in 1930 and con¬ 
tinued until the low in 1932 ,after which there was a slight rise. 

2. Prices of local lettuce and celery did not decline to the same 
extent as potato and cabbage prices, 

* 

3 . Price ranges of new domestic potatoes did not change after 

1930. 

4. - Very few prices for new foreign potatoes were quoted after 1929 
but for those sold there was no decrease in the price. 

3 . Price ranges for domestic and foreign cabbage did not change 
after lower price ranges started in 193 ^* 

6 . The price of local cabbage declined in 193 1 but changed very 
little from the lower level reached at that time. 

7. When prices were low, i.e, $1.00, a small rise in price was 
not easily perceptible on the chart. If the rise were expressed

in percentage of previous price it might he fairly high. 

8. There was some decline in the modal price for foreign lettuce 
in 1 933 > 1934 and 1933> compared with the three previous years. 

9 . A trend line would show some decline in domestic celery prices 
after 1931* 

10. There was no apparent decline in foreign celery prices for the 
six year period. 

11. Prices of celery and lettuce were much more unstable than 
cabbage and potato prices. 

12. The price of the four vegetables decreased as the supply changed 
from foreign to domestic to local. 

13. The wholesale and retail prices of local vegetables seemed to 
be more stable than foreign or domestic. 

Some

Local producers have been very dissatisfied with prices for 
vegetables since 1930* It is alleged that severe and abnormal 
competition has kept prices very low. The heavy marketing period 
is during the summer, at which time prices for summer vegetables go 
very low as the volume offered increases. The unfair competition 
was alleged to have come from temporary producers such as farmers 
and unemployed married and single men who have acquired a small

piece of land. These men were inexpert in marketing and in order 
to dispose of their produce would offer it at a very low price. 

It was heard that some of these producers were on relief and were 
thus not dependent for a living on the price received for their 
produce. They would offer at any price in order to make a sale. 
The extra volume produced by these men in addition to the normal 
offerings by specialized market gardeners was said to have forced 
prices very low. It would be necessary to investigate further 
into prevailing prices succeeding and preceding 1929 in order to 
confirm these statements. From the weight of evidence it would 
seem safe to conclude that this competition has existed to some 
extent. 

In an interview (8) in January 1935 eight operators were 
asked their opinions on vegetable prices for the marketing periods 
1934-5.5 and 1933*34. Seven operators stated there had been no 
increase in prices in the two years, and one stated prices were 
higher in 1934-35 than in 1933*34. All operators stated they were 
having difficulty in selling at what they considered satisfactory 
prices. The opinion among them was that production had decreased 
slightly in 1934 compared with the heavy production in 1933* An 
earlier survey (4) showed growers to have had from to 60$, sur¬ 
plus of winter vegetables unmarketed in the spring of 1934. (See 
Table VII, page 6?.) The growers interviewed in January 1935 
expected no surplus in the spring of 1935* Two indicated they had 
decreased their acreage in 1934 compared to 1933> the other six 
planted the same area. Three out of eight planned to decrease 
the acreage planted in 1935 > four would plant the same, and one 
expected to increase. Production in 1935 was materially reduced

by a heavy frost in August which destroyed many tender vegetables 
and reduced the yield of others. From this brief survay of market 
conditions and in interviews with growers at various times during 
1933 and- 1*936 it would seem safe to conclude that the market for 
local grown produce has been more stable for the last two years. 
Growers however are still complaining about prices and a movement 
was reported to be starting among them to code producers to prevent 
price cutting.^ 

It is considered that prices would have been lower in the fall 
and winter of 1933, 1-934 and 1933 had not a considerable quantity 
of vegetables been shipped from the immediate Edmonton district by 
the provincial government to crop failure areas. This removed 
part of the surplus that would have been dumped on the market by 
farmers and gardeners who had no storage. (See Table XI at the 
end of this chapter for quantity shipped.) 

It was pointed out by several producers (7)* (9)> that the 
public demand for fresh vegetables is partly satiated by the time 
the local are ready for market. Hew vegetables from foreign or 
domestic sources are sold from about January until the local are 
ready. Prices are high during the winter and thus appeal to 
comparatively few consumers. British Columbia products arrive in 
heavy quantities in May and June. The prices at this time are 
lower than winter prices, people become tired of old store vegetables 
and will thus buy in considerable quantity new British Columbia 
vegetables. The price therefore is usually falling for summer

vegetables by the time the local are ready for market. 

Growers and otheis claimed that there is usually a glut of 
summer vegetables, with accompanying low prices, during July and 
August. Two main reasons were given: 1) production is the heaviest 
at this time, and 2) many consumers move out of the city to summer 
resorts. Market gardeners operating near the camps supply their 
needs. 

The charts I, II, III, IV and other evidence heard give con¬ 
clusive proof that the producers who are able to get their produce 
on the market first receive the highest prices. This is not always 
true, if it is considered how much more is necessary, when the plants 
are small, to make up a given weight. It may pay to wait until 

the crop is more mature and take a lower price. 

There is usually a gradual depreciation of storage vegetables 

as the storage period increases. Growers were asked (7), (9), if 

prices decreased with the normal depreciation. The opinion was 

that it did not if the quantity was marketed at a uniform rate. 

The decrease in quality was apparently offset by a decrease in supply. 

foreign 

The presence of new/vegetables, i.e. new carrots, cabbage, 
beets, etc., on the market was claimed (7) not to change the price 
of local stored vegetables. It was considered that they prevented 
the price of storage vegetables from rising. 

There is a tendency for market gardeners to become panicky at 
different times during the winter if they think that they will not 
clear their stock. One, or a number of growers, may start price 
cutting which causes other growers to do the same (6). The panic 
is often temporary, but tends to cause instability of prices. It

was stated (10) that this is most noticeable on the city public 
market. In the summer and fall producers may be unable to sell 
all their produce brought to the public market and, in preference 
to taking a complete loss, will peddle it at whatever price is 
offered. This was most common among producers living outside the 
normal production area who sell only occasionally in the city. 

In general it may be concluded that supply seemed to be the 
most important price regulating factor. In years when there was 
a decrease in production prices rose, but when the supply exceeded 

the demand at a particular price then prices were lowered. The 

many 

inelastic demand for/ agricultural products makes it necessary to 
reduce prices to very low levels in order to attract customers when 
production exceeds the amount normally consumed by a given population. 

£ftPj P JTA. J n fl^ Pr ices 

A local broker and two wholesalers in February 193 & were asked 
a number of questions 1 pertaining to prices. The following con¬ 
clusions were obtained from the answers. 

There is often considerable variation from year to year in 
wholesale prices. This is due’ 1 almost entirely to supply and demand". 
A heavy crop in a foreign supply country is reflected by a lower 
price. The same applies to prices for domestic and local produce. 

There is not much price cutting between foreign competitive 
producing districts as most imports come from the United States 
where market organizations and producers are well organized and 
are thus able to limit price cutting.

There has been no dumping of foreign commodities on the 
Edmonton market since 19JQ when dump duties were increased. It 
was stated that there has been dumping since this date on some of 
the larger Canadian city markets. 

Local wholesalers, so far as was determined, keep no record 
of prices except what is forwarded to the head office in the case 
of branch companies. It was not possible to find any fruit or 
vegetable seller who kept a charted or other record of fruit or 
vegetable prices. No consumption schedules were available. It 
seemed that the policy is to price commodities at the highest price 
at which they will move at sufficient rate to remove stocks. It 
was heard among sellers that managers do not all agree on pricing. 
Some believe in low prices and quick turnover, while others believe 
in keeping prices higher. 

The policy among wholesalers is 11 to work on a 15% spread over 
cost price**. Prices are set in order to recover this amount. It 
was stated that this was in the nature of f? an unwritten law”. 

Wholesalers meet once or several times a week to talk over 
stocks, prices, and other matters pertaining to their business. 

This will be considered in a later section. 

To questions on tariff the wholesalers and brokers were unable 
to say how much prices were increased by these. So many other 
factors have influenced prices that it was considered impossible 
to attribute the amount to each cause. 

The men questioned were certain that tariffs had caused prices 
to be higher than they would otherwise have been if tariffs had not

CHAPTER VII. 

THE INFLUENCE 01' TARIFF ON 
THE MARKETING OE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

It has not been possible, due to lack of statistical material, 
to present any specific evidence of the result of tariffs on the 
marketing of fruit and vegetables in the Edmonton marketing district. 
Some of the results may be stated in general terms from the opinions 
given by men engaged in marketing (1), (6), and transporting these 
commodities (12). An explanation of important tariff changes 
affecting fruits and vegetables in the last five years was obtained 
from a Dominion Government customs official (11) at Edmonton. 

This official was unable to give any figures showing quantitative 
changes in imports with changes in the tariff. Price and quanti¬ 
tative records are taken, but these are forwarded to Ottawa. Even 
if these figures were available it would be difficult to determine 
to what extent changes in imports were due to tariff changes or 
to changes in foreign, domestic, ana local prices. Another very 

important factor causing changes in imports has been the general 
decline in consumers 1 incomes, which has reduced the amount spent 
for fruits and vegetables (1). This is particularly true when 
considering the amount spent on fresh fruits and vegetables imported 
at higher prices during winter and spring months. These and other 
factors have influenced imports. The decline is shown in table 
VIII, pages 77-78. 

Three important changes in tariff on fruits and vegetables

imported from the Uni tea States have been maae in the last five 
years, (11). In 193° there was an increase in the tariff which 
set the rate at 30% on vegetables and 20% on fruit. Also at this 

time a minimum prioe was set for duty of so much per pound or other 

unit of measurement. If the invoice price at the point of export 
was less than this then the price was increased to the minimum 
and a percentage rate of tariff was charged on this. If the value 
was above the minimum price stipulatea by the customs the percentage 
rate was taken on this. The United States was given a general 
tariff by Canada. This was the highest given to any country. 

Also, under the 1930 tariff schedule a minimum tariff was set on 

each commodity, i.e. 20 per pound, 30 per pound, etc., and if the 

percentage of value was less than this minimum stipulated then the 
latter was used; thus the one giving the highest charge was applied. 
This schedule was applicable all year. 

In 1932 the tariff on fruits and vegetables was changed to 
seasonal duties in addition to ad valorem rates. These were appli¬ 
cable when Canadian produced fruits or vegetables were in competi¬ 
tion with American. This was determined by checking the Canadian 
supplies. The seasonal duty was applied when Canadian stocks 
were ready for market and removed when these were exhausted. The 
1932 tariff regulations also stipulated that the invoice price of 
exports could not be less than the prevailing price for the same 
goods in the country of export. This was to prevent dumping of 
foreign products on Canadian markets. The seasonal duties were 
so much per pound in addition to the general tariff of 30 % 
vegetables and 20% for fruit.

marketing, who were questioned, agreed that tariffs have decreased 
imports from the United States, since 1930. The greatest decrease 
has been since 1932 when seasonal duties were applied. When 
these were in force it was unanimously agreed that practically no 
supplies were imported from the United States. It was stated in 
September 1934 by an Edmonton broker that the seasonal and dump 
duties had practically excluded seasonal importations of commodities 
such as plums, pears, peaches and prunes, formerly imported from 
the state of Washington. British Columbia supplies were said to 
have displaced these almost entirely. 

Some indication of the cost of tariff to the consumer may be 
taken from the calculations made by Cassels 1 in 1929* “In a sin^e 
year, March 1927 to March 1928, the consumers of the prairie paid 
1333>432 to the customs department” for fruits from the United 
States. “The tariff on fruits was designed to give protection to 
the native industry in British Columbia.” Cassels considers the 
additional costs to the consumer on preserving fruits. Washington 
ana British Columbia peaches were on sale at the same time in 
September, 1928 . “The delivered costs from both sources must be 
approximately equal” or the jobber will not handle them. 

“On September 3 , 1928 , No. 1 Elberta peaches from these two 
sources were selling in Edmonton at $1.23 a crate to the consumer. 

The wholesale price was $1.13, end the cost to the jobber was $1.10. 
The packing and selling charges in Yfashington may be taken as practi¬ 
cally the same as those in British Columbia, in this instance,

The transportation charges from Washington are considerably higher.. 
(Due to distance...) Finally, in addition to these extra railway 
charges, there is the item of 220 for duty, which did not enter the 
delivered costs on the British Columbia products. 

”The result was that the American grower received about 120 
a case for his peaches and the British Columbia grower 440. The 
520 of difference was divided between the Canadian government and 
the railway companies; 220 to the former and 120 to the latter.” 

Similar calculations were made for prunes and pears; the duty 
on the former was 110 a case which left the Washington producer 110 
and the British Columbia 270* The duty on pears was 25 cents and 
the returns to the growers of Washington and British Columbia were 
65 cents and $1.57 respectively. 

After a study of costs entering the distribution of fruit in 
Western Canada, Cassels concluded: ”... We are bound on purely econo 
mic grounds to recognize that a removal of the tariff barriers 
against American fruit would enable the Canadian consumers to bene¬ 
fit from the superior natural advantages enjoyed by producers in 
Washington and California.”

CHAPTER VIII. 

SI'AHDARDIZATIQN.

The fruit branch of the Dominion Department, of Agriculture 
is the most important institution in Canada regulating the sale 
of fruits and vegetables. This department is concerned with the 
general promotion of the industry and with the administration of 
the “Fruit, Vegetable and Honey Act“. To insure that the pro¬ 
visions of this act are carried out the Dominion Government has 
established a system of inspection at each of the principal whole¬ 
sale centres. Inspectors appointed by the Dominion Government 
are stationed at these principal producing and distributing centres. 
The Fruit Branch is responsible for bringing together the interests 
of the producers and the cons oners to promote the industry in the 
best interests of all parties . 

The Fruit. Vegetable and Honev Act 

This Act is drawn up by the Dominion Government and is subject 
to amendment from time to time by the same body. It sets forth 
the regulations which govern the fruit and vegetable industry in 
the Dominion of Canada as a whole and in the respective provinces. 
The Act covers inspection, grading, packing, marking, standardizati¬ 
on of weights and measures, import and ezport regulations, penalties, 
definitions and other matters relating to the industry. 

The provisions of the Act are set forth in a publication 1 

1 Publication 476. “Acts, Orders and Regulations No. 35 “ Published 
by direction of Ministry of Agriculture, Ottawa.

issued and revised from time to time by the Dominion Government, 
G-xadijyS 

Grading in Canada is not compulsary on all fruits and vegetables 
sold except as provided in the Act . 1 The way the Act now reads 


1 Clause 15 of the Act states ?, no person shall (a) transport, pack, 
advertise, display or offer for sale, sell or have in his possession 
for sale any produce which has not been graded and inspecteu and, 
if in packages, packed and marked in accordance with the provisions 
of this Act and the regulations thereunder, the onus of proof of 
compliance with such provisions being upon the person charged;” 

Pub. 476, page 3. 

This clause was discussed with the district Fruit and Vegetable 
inspector. There is apparently some doubt as to the constitution¬ 
ality of this clause as it now stands in the Act, and it is being 
examined by the Supreme Court of Canada. At present this clause 
is not enforced to the letter. 

Clause 13, Inspection, Pub. 476, page 16 , stipulates: in¬ 

spection shall be compulsory on honey produced in and intended for 
shipment out of Canaaa and on straight or mixed carload, cargo or 
truck shipments of: 

(a) "apples, plums, pears, peaches, potatoes, onions and turnips 
or rutabagas grown in and intended for shipment out of Canada; 

(b) "fruit and vegetables grown in British Columbia or Quebec 
and moving to any other province; 

(c) "grapes grown in Ontario and moving to any other province; 

(d) "apples grown in Nova Scotia and moving to any other province; 

(e) "potatoes and turnips or rutabagas grown in Ontario or 
Prince Edward Island and moving to any other province; 

(f) "potatoes grown in New Brunswick and moving to any other 
province;" 

14 . "These regulations with the exception of the next preceding 
clause (number 13) shall also apply to produce grown in a regulated 
area defined by a Local Board under the Natural Products Marketing 
Act and moving from, through or to any point named by such Local 
Board as an inspection point for such kind of produce. 

13 . "These regulations shall not apply to gift shipments of 
five packages or less or experimental or exhibition shipments or 
such shipments as may be authorized by the Minister." (Minister 
of Agriculture.

it is necessary to grade all produce sold but not all produce, or 
produce from all areas, need be inspected except as provided in the 
Act. It is left to the shipper to provide a suitable grade and 
if the consignee is not satisfied he may appeal for inspection. 

The Act provides that “fruits or vegetables grown in British 
Columbia 1 * and“moving to any other province'* have to be graded and 
inspected. This means that practically all domestic imports of 
fruit and vegetables to Edmonton are inspected and graded. United 
States products sold in Canada are also graded or must conform to 
Canadian graae standards. The Canadian Fruit, Vegetable and Honey 
Act (Chapter 62 of the Statutes of Canada of 1935) enables producers 
in any area to organize under the Natural Products Marketing Act to 
have compulsory grading and inspection of produce of a stipulated 
nature, sold from a defined area. 

Grading 

The grade standards are defined in the Act and all fruits 
“when packed in closed packages**^ must conform to grade standards 
and the grade must be marked on the container. The Act omits the 
phrase “when packed in closed packages** in specifying grades of 
vegetables. The grade and a description of the product must be 
attached to all containers or bulk shipments of vegetables. 

In so far as the Act could be interpreted, potatoes are the 
only commodity specified that do not have a standard grade every¬ 
where in Canada. Provision is made for some modification of potato

grades between Eastern Canada and “Manitoba and west thereof”.

The standard grading system insures for unifoimity within the 
limits of human ability to distinguish between grades, i.e. one 
inspector may designate a borderline consignment as a particular 
grade, the consignee may object to the grade and call for re-inspec¬ 
tion with the result that a second inspector may designate it a 
grade lower* 

Grading is done either by the producers or marketing agencies. 
The principal grades of Canadian fruit are:- Extra fancy; 
fancy; and C grade; or, Grades 1, 2, and 3, and others. The 
principal vegetable grades are designated as Canada No. 1, Canada 
No. 2, Canada No. 3, and others. 

Grading Not Applicable 1 

It is only neeessary to stipulate the grade on packed commodi¬ 
ties held for sale. As soon as goods are placed on the display 
counter the public can observe what is being bought. Grading is 
thus not enforced on commodities sold on the city public market. 

The Act would read as if all commodities sold have to be graded 
(see foot-note page 114). Actually it is not enforced in this 
manner. Local grown produce sold direct to wholesalers, retailers 
or consumers may be or may not be graded, because the purchaser 
can see what is being purchased. It is illegal, however, to 
misrepresent a particular grade; thus, when the grade is specified, 
it must confoxm to the designated standard. 

Inspection 

Inspection is made by inspectors only where the Act stipulates 

^ Information from Mr. Andrews, Dominion Government Fruit and 
Vegetable Inspector.

this is required. The Dominion Government inspectors however may¬ 
be called upon by any party to inspect a commodity. The inspector’s 
job is to interpret the Act and act as arbitrator between contracting 
parties. It is only necessary to inspect arrivals of fruit or 
vegetables if either the consignor or consignee calls for it. When 
this is done by either party the inspector makes an examination of 
the goods to decide on any point at issue. This may be a disagree¬ 
ment over grade, shrinkage beyona the maximum allowed in the contract, 
spoilage, misrepresentation, etc. There is an inspection fee 
charged according to the provisions laid down in the Act for each 
inspection. The Minimum fee is $2.00 per carload and the maximum 
$6.00 per carload for re-inspection, which fee may be refunded if 
there is a change from the original inspection report. 

The inspector has the power to enter any building, freight car, 
or other enclosure to examine goods. He may at any time detain for 
inspection any goods specified in the Act. In addition to inspect¬ 
ing the officer has to collect reports of prices, consignments, and 
market conditions, and keep a general surveillance over the industry 
to see that provisions of the Act are carried out. The inspector 
is also the contact man through whom the Dominion Fruit Branch is 
able to promote the industry in the best interest of producers, 
market organizations and consumers. 

PuyqhQsifig by. G^adg, 

All fruits and vegetables, either foreign or domestic, imported 
to Edmonton are purchased on grade (1)• Standardization thus 
greatly facilitates sales by providing a common language by which 
buyers and sellers can designate their demand and supply.

Grading of Local Vegetables 

At present it is left to the seller to decide whether to 
•offer a graded or non-graded product to local buyers. Shipments 
from the district, however, have to be graded but not inspected. 

The shipper grades the product according to what he considers as 
the proper grade standard. In doing this he may obtain advice 
from the district inspector and also refer to the designated 
standard in the Act. The commodity is thus sold as being of a 
certain grade but this may be challenged, by the purchaser. If 
the buyer and seller do not come to an agreement the government 
inspector may be called in to decide whether the grade is as 
represented. Shippers may, by paying an inspection fee, have the 
grade inspected before shipment. 

The question of the advisability of more rigid grading and 
inspection of local vegetables was discussed with the government 
inspector. At present we have no certain outside market and it is 
unlikely that more rigid grading would be of benefit. Keen seller 
competition forces most shippers to observe grade standards. If 
we were selling on a regular outside market more supervision would 
no doubt be of assistance. 

The question of closer supervision of grades offered by local 
producers at the public market, to wholesalers, retailers, etc. 
was also discussed. The statement is oTten heard that the produ¬ 
cer with a poor product has to offer at a low price and by so doing 
forces the price aown for all producers. The truth of the argument 
cannot be answered here. It may be stated that the poor producer 
has very little chance and is soon forced out of business. In

most years competition is sufficiently keen to force the majority 
of sellers to offer a good quality. Some purchasers may consider 
they are getting a bargain by buying low grade products cheap. 

The majority of buyers demand quality and are willing to pay extra 
for it. It was the opinion of the local inspector that the grades 
offered in this district were adequate to suit the demand. It 
is very questionable whether there would be sufficient increased 
returns to producers to justify the expense of closer supervision 
of grading.

SECTION 2 


EDMONTON ASSEMBLING AND DISTRIBUTING AGENCIES 













121. 


iMRQmmm 

Section 2 will set forth information gathered concerning the 
principal marketing agencies assembling and distributing fruit and 
vegetables in the Edmonton marketing shed. The order of present¬ 
ing the chapters concerning each marketing agency will be the same 
as that taken in turn by each in the assembling and distributing 
process. The following will be considered:- transportation 
agencies, Edmonton brokers, wholesalers, various classes of retail 
stores, city public market, hucksters and others performing some 
marketing service. 

The material for chapters in this section was obtained by 
interviews or by taking statistical records from each of the above 
listed marketing agencies. Most of the records were obtained in 
September 1934, but a further survey of Edmonton fruit and vegetable 
wholesale houses was made in May 1955* Other interviews with 
market-men have been made at various times in to obtain 

additional information.^ 

The surveys were limited in scope due to the limited funds 
available. An attempt was made to obtain statistical data from 
representative groups in order to have a fair sample from each 
marketing function. 

The assumptions which may be drawn from the compiled data 
are limited by the extent of the accuracy of the original data.

The surveys were maae during the time the Price Spreads Commission 
was conducting its investigation and businessmen in general were 
reluctant about divulging information. Where it was not possible 
to obtain information or it was felt data given unsatisfactory, 
they hire not been included in the tables of compiled data. Practi¬ 
cally all the data used in compiling the tables considered in each 
chapter were estimates. In a relatively few instances figures 
were taken from account books by the men questioned. In most 
cases the answers were based on memory or general knowledge of 
the business. The small number of firms used also materially 
reduced the accuracy of the data. 

In each interview the person questioned was asked to make 
any comments relevant to his business or to marketing in general 
that would be of interest in a study of this kind. Much valuable 
information, explaining how each marketing agency operates, was 
obtained in this way. Opinions expressed by various market-men 
will be referred to throughout the chapters to follow. 

The data that will be set forth should not be considered as 
final but merely the results of a limited preliminary research 
study. It would be necessary to supplement most of the data with 
additional information before making final conclusions.

CHAPTER IX. 

TRANSPORTATION. 

It will not be possible to develop this chapter in any detail 
due to a lack of time to investigate this phase of marketing. 
Transportation is however one of the most important steps in market¬ 
ing, and without adequate transportation facilities there could be 
no extensive system of marketing. It may be stated that it is upon 
continuous service rendered by the various modes of transportation 
that the whole marketing process depends. 

Transportation Facilities Serving the Edmonton Shed . 

Edmonton is provided with a system of railways, highways and 
trunk roads radiating in all directions. The main transcontinental 
line of the Canadian National Railways connects the city with the 
Pacific Ocean at Vancouver and Prince Rupert, and with the Atlantic 
seaports of the Maritime provinces and the ports on the Great Lakes. 
A line of the Canadian Pacific Railways also connects Edmonton with 
both oceans. Edmonton is thus served by two transcontinental 
railways giving daily service in freight, passenger and express 
transport. Both railway systems have express and freight terminals 
at Edmonton. The Canadian National system also operates the 
Northern Alberta Railways, which connect Edmonton with the Peace 
River districts of Alberta and British Columbia, which as yet have 
no direct outlet to the Pacific. This line also has a branch 
running from Edmonton to Eort McMurray, some three hundred miles 
north. In all there are twelve main and branch lines radiating

from Edmonton which serve practically all the settled territory in 
the shed. Situated at about 10 miles along these lines there are, 
in all, over towns or villages. 

In addition to the railways, highways or dirt roads extend 
into most districts. A gravel highway runs from Edmonton via 
Calgary and Lethbridge to the United States boundary. This highway 
also extends about 100 miles north of Edmonton. A gravel highway 
also connects Edmonton with Jasper, some 2j?Q miles west, and with 
Saskatchewan, 200 miles east. There are in all three gravel 
highways radiating east and southeast from Edmonton to Saskatchewan. 
The highways follow the railways, so that practically all the towns 
on main railway lines are served by both rail and motor transport, 
as the main highways are now kept open most of the year. The 
trucks are usually stopped for a few weeks during each spring thaw 
and occasionally for a few days after a heavy snowfall in the winter. 
Dirt roads, as yet not built up to the all-weather stage, extend 
to practically all towns on branch lines. 

The railway and road facilities thus provide for two types 
of carriers transporting fruits and vegetables, namely, motor trucks, 
and freight and express railway cars. 

Rail Carrier SarviO-S 1 

The largest quantity of fruit and vegetables imported to 
Edmonton is carried in freight cars. The cars are loaded at the 
source of supply and are shipped direct to Edmonton. The time in 
transit varies with distance and in this respect British Columbia 
shippers have a great advantage over United States competitors.

It takes approximately eight aays for a freight shipment to leach 
Edmonton from California, and about three days from the Okanagon 
Valley of British Columbia. (12) The quantity of goods brought 
to the wholesale centre in express cars is relatively small compared 
with freight and is confined mostly to small fruits. These are 
shipped in both types of rail carriers. 

Freight cars may be loaded with one commodity or carry a 
load of mixed fruits or vegetables, or both. The majority of 
cars are filled to capacity, but some L.C.L. shipments are received. 
Cassels 1 in 192? showed that an arrangement between a number of 
wholesale houses to divide among them part of the contents of cars 
of perishables received in slack seasons facilitates the movement 
of full cars. This practice is still followed (6). 

Railways are equipped for handling incoming freight in all 
weather. They will not, however, carry small quantities of freight 
to country points when there is danger of freezing. Freight cars 
cannot be heated for small shipments (12). During winter periods, 
when there is danger of freezing , shipments from the wholesale 
centre to country points have to go by express or heated trucks 
(6), (12). During the seasons when it is necessary to use refri- 

p 

geration the railways provide car equipped for this. 


x J.M. Cassels "Fruit Distribution in Western Canada”. lour, of 
Pol. Econ. page 101, vol. 37* 1929* 

2 Many improved methods of refrigeration have been effected in the 
last few years. A very successful method now used is to blow by 
machinery very finely flaked ice into the car to surround the fresh 
vegetables as they are packed. This method preserves fresh vege¬ 
tables "to arrive as fresh as when packed” (6). About 50% to 60% 
of the cars are packed by the shippers, and the balance by the 
railways. (12)

Comparative Rates, and Costs of Refrigeration, and Heating. 

The average freight charge is about ^6 cents per cwt. for 
vegetables, and $ 1.79 per cwt. for fruit from British Columbia to 
Edmonton. The charge however varies with distance, and the class 
of commodity; the freight charge, i.e. on apples, is 95 cents when 
boxed, whereas when these were shipped in bulk the charge was about 
54 cents a cwt. 1 

The average freight charge on vegetables from California to 
Edmonton is about $1.85 per cwt. and on fruit it is about $ 1.95 

per cwt. These charges also vary with distance and the class of 

2 

commodity. 

When a refrigeration car is used for transporting vegetables 
from 500 to 7^0 miles there is a charge of $6.00 per car (12). 

The charge varies with distance.^ If it is a car of mixed fruit 
and vegetables ana the vegetables comprise less than 10,000 pounds 
there is no charge for refrigeration. Carloads of straight 
vegetables or ewer 10,000 pounds of vegetables in a car of fruit 
and vegetables, have to pay for refrigeration. There is no extra 
charge for refrigeration on cars of fruit or vegetables shipped 
from the Pacific States of the U.S.A. The shippers may choose 
whatever type of car is preferred. In the summer practically all 
perishables from British Columbia are shipped in standard refriger¬ 
ation cars. (12) 

^ See appendix 6a for discussion on apple rates. 

2 See appendix 6b for discussion on water transportation.

The charge for standard heated freight oars from Ashcroft, 
B.C. to Edmonton is § 8*35 per oar. On standard heated cars 
originating in Oregon the charge for heating is five cents a ewt. 
to the Canadian border (Kingsgate), and from the point of entry 
to Edmonton it is one and a half cents a mile. 

The shipper may, or the railways may insist in the case of 
certain commodities, obtain Carriage Protective Service, for which 
there is a charge of $15.00 per car (12). The railway on all 
shipments assumes losses or damage attributable to negligence on 
the part of the railway. 

The charge for refrigeration or heating service on shipments 
of perishables from Edmonton to country points is an increase of 
10 % in the freight charge (12). 

The above outline of the costs of transporting fruits and 
vegetables is too sketohy to be of value in determining the pro¬ 
portion of the cost of perishables to the consumers that is attri¬ 
butable to transportation. It may be concluded that, in general, 
the greater the distance goods move the greater the proportion 
of cost elements in the price paid by the consumer that are attri¬ 
butable to transportation charges. 1 

All fruits and vegetables, of either foreign or domestic 
origin, move on commodity rates to the wholesale centre. Fifhen 


1 0n 9,476 cars of mixed fruit and vegetables shipped an average 
of 1,400 miles from the production point to eastern United States 
cities the shippers received practically G 0 % of the total sales 
and the transportation charge was a little more than J> 0 % of the 
total sales. This included regular freight rate, refrigeration 
and heating costs etc. The percentage of total sales going to 
shippers on 2,022 oarloads of apples moving approximately 400 miles 
was about 80 % and the percentage of total sales to transportation 
charges was about 12%. Both of these figures were

moving from tile wholesale centre to country points they take class 
rates. The rate varies according to the commodity. The follow¬ 
ing list of commodities with the rates taken serve as illustration:- 
oranges and lemons, L.C.L., 1st olass; boxed apples, 3rd class; 
orated apples, 2nd class; storage vegetables with the exception 
of potatoes, 3rd class; potatoes, 4th class; ordinary fruit and 
spring vegetables (tops on), 1st class. The freight charge from 
Edmonton to country points increases with the distance shipped, 
and also the higher the class which the commodity takes the greater 
the freight cost (12). 

Truck Transportation 1 

Trucks in the last ten years have become an important means 
of transporting fruits and vegetables from the wholesale centre to 
country distributors. This mode of transportation has increased 
in importance as roads have improved in the province. In practi¬ 
cally all towns and villages within a trucking range of the whole¬ 
sale centre there are several trucks which do a regular carrying 
business to and from the city. Usually two or more (the number 

from 1920-21 costs but they serve to illustrate the significance 
of distance in transportation costs. 

Figures from W.T. Jackman. "Economics of Transportation" 
pages 386-7. 

^ Statements in this section are based on:- 

(a) Survey in May 193.5 of a representative group of truck 
operators transporting to and from Edmonton.

fruits and vegetables. See verbal references (3) ®ad (6).

depending on the size of the town or village) reliable truck 
operators get practically all the trucking business for grocery 
and confectionary stores. In addition to the regular operators 
there are many others(in some cases a dozen in d district) 

who make irregular trips when they can get a load. However only 

the regular truckers, except for occasional small orders to other 
drivers, carry fruit or vegetables or other groceries. Fruit 
and vegetables are easily injured and therefore the store operator 
is usually particular to whom he gives the order. 

The truckers go to the country store-keepers and receive 
instructions to pick up orders at certain wholesale houses. The 
orders may have been made by telephone, taken by salesmen, or the 
truck driver may give the order. Within a range of about 100 
miles from the city many drivers make daily trips. Beyond this 
distance they usually drive to the city one day and return the 
next. The frequency of the trips in both cases depends on the 
amount of business. 

There is very little trucking of fruits and vegetables to the 
wholesale centres except what is brought in by farmers or market 
gardeners,. Trucks occasionally move supplies from Calgary to 
Edmonton wholesale houses if any of the local houses are short on 
certain commodities. It was reported that a few truck loads of 
fr^sh vegetables occasionally reach Edmonton from Medicine Hat 
and Brooks, but these are incidental (6). 

Many of the larger enclosed trucks have heating equipment 
and are thus able to carry fruit and vegetables in all seasons (6).

Truck Rates 

It is not possible to state truck rates as these were found 
to he quite unstable and depend to a considerable extent on compe¬ 
tition. The survey indicated that when one or two regular truckers 
served a town the rates were about the same as rail rates or equal 
to the rail rates plus the cost of draying from the station to the 
store. When competition between drivers is more severe the rates 
were said to be lower than the rail. The regular truokers usually 
have a set rate schedule, but the occasional operator will bargain 
for business. The former usually carries a load both directions, 
whereas the latter usually only has a pay load to the city. 1 Any 
freight they are able to carry from the city is considered as extra 
revenue. In order to get return loads they often bargain for 
rates and will carry for sufficient to cover out of pocket expenses. 
In the case of the regular operators rates on return loads were 
found to be equal to incoming whereas the irregular truckers 
charged less on return cargo. 

In general it may be concluded that truck rates are from equal 
to less than rail rates. As the irregular truckers are not equip¬ 
ped for carrying fruit or vegetables the small quantity carried by 
them is of minor importance. 

It was learned that some country store operators do their own 
trucking to and from the city. When this is done they make a 
charge on their books for transportation equivalent to the mil 
rates. No figures can be given to show the extent of this. 

These operators carried mostly live-stock.

Transportation from Edmonton to Country Point s ^- 

In Table XII it is shown that the average rail shipments of 
seven Edmonton fruit and vegetable wholesale houses to country 
points are divided J? 1 . 4 f 0 as express and 48 . 6 f<> as freight. The 
table gives the estimated percentage express and freight shipments 
for each firm. There was considerable variation between answers; 
two firms considered they shipped 5®% by express and 50% by freight, 
two firms estimated 25f« express and 75°/> freight, and three firms 
considered they shipped G 5 % or over as express. No reason was 
obtained for this variation between firms in the proportion of 
express and freight shipments. 

The average shipments to country points of eight wholesale 
houses, as shown in Table XIII was 44.1f<> by truck and 55 * 9 % by 
rail. 

Table XI 7 arranges the firms according to the percentages 
shipped by truck. Three firms estimated trucks carried 30-40f o 
of their shipments, four estimated from 5®% 60%, an< ^ one 

estimated 70°/> to went by truck. In each case the balance 
was shipped by rail.

directions, except south, the average trucking distance is less 
than rail. This is to be expected because the truck is naturally 
better suited to short than long hauls. The rail shipments cover 
the entire normal marketing shed. The average distance is not the 
same in each direction but this is because Edmonton is not in the 
centre of the shed. The south distance for both truck and rail 
shipments is less than the other directions because beyond 100 
miles south supplies are received from Galgary. There is some 
overlapping in supplying the territory intermediate between the 
two cities. 

Table XVIshows the maximum distance in each direction perish¬ 
ables are carried by truck and by rail. The maximum rail distances 
are as follows:- North 300 miles, east 23 Q miles, south 23 O miles 
and west 33 Q miles. The maximum trucking distances were 23 O miles 
for north, east and south, and JQQ miles west. Not all firms 
were sending goods to these distances, for example, the maximum 
distance south for seven firms was 130 miles. The distances in 
Table XVIare classified into 30 mile groups, the total range being 
from 0 to 300 miles in each direction. Opposite each distance 
class and in the direction columns, are given the number of lirms 
which gave the miles in the class as the maximum distance they 
shipped by rail and by truck. It may be assumed that a firm 
shipped to all distances up to its maximum. As the distance 
increased the number of firms decreased. The average distance 
and the maximum distance perishables were transported by truck 
indicate that the normal trucking fringe is from about 130 to 
200 miles from the city. The differences in the average trucking

distance in each direction may be partly explained by the varying 
condition of roads and partly by the extent of the marketing area. 

Factors Favoring Truck or Rail Transport .^* 

It may be stated that trucks are now of equal importance to 
the railways in moving perishables. All the wholesale firms 
interviewed were shipping by both. The railways have felt the 
competition of trucks and have lowered their rates to meet the 
competition. The express companies have also suffered from the 
competition and now give a special rate on perishables known as 
"freight express" which is the same as ordinary freight rates. 

The situation today is that railways, express companies and 
truckers are competing for the business and are charging approxi¬ 
mately the same rates. The competition is now mainly in service. 
In this respect the trucks have considerable advantage, particu¬ 
larly in the short hauls. They are able to give the country 
store operator a daily service in most cases. If the regular 
trucker does not provide a daily service there are always several 
other truckers from the community anxious to pick up an urgent 
order. The railways are at a disadvantage in frequency of service, 
particularly on branch lines. Towns on main lines can usually 
get a daily express service but not always daily freight. 

The trucks are able to deliver direct to the store door, 
whereas rail shipments have to be drayed from the railway. 

Because of more frequent service country store-keepers do not 
have to keep as large a supply of perishables on hand, v/hich re¬ 
duces risk. It is very convenient to telephone to the wholesale

house Saturday morning asking them to forward with a particular 
driver an order of fruit for the weekend sale. When weather 
conditions are uncertain the store-keeper may not know until 
Saturday what this trade is likely to be and an order received 
by freight on Thursday or Friday may go unsold, resulting in a 
loss. The customer also benefits by receiving fresher quality. 

The factors outlined have tended to show considerable advan¬ 
tage for trucking. This is not as apparent when the disadvantages 
are considered. 

Practically all truck drivers carry a mixed cargo. This 
means that perishables such as fruit or tender vegetables are 
packed in with other commodities. Unless they are very carefully 
packed and held firmly in place severe bruising and other damage 
is likely to take place. The majority of wholesalers expressed 
the opinion that trucks were not satisfactory for carrying berries 
and other soft fruit or tender vegetables. Berries will not 
stand jolting and the bruising of all fruit is almost inevitable 
on all Alberta roads. 

It was found that the majority of wholesalers tended to be 
antagonistic towards transportation of perishables by trucks. The 
bruising and other injury in transit seriously sjpoils the quality 
of the product received by the country merchant,. The truck driver 
uses the excuse that the goods were in poor condition when they 
were loaded. He is able to talk directly to the store-keeper, 
whereas the wholesaler cannot defend himself. The result is the 
wholesaler may lose some business due to injury for which he is 
not to blame. There is no way of getting compensation for damage

from the trucker because in most oases no insurance is carried and 
even if it were there is no easy way of determining the extent 
of the damage. The railways in this respect offer an advantage, 
for they will make allowance for injury due to their negligenoe 
and it is also possible to insure rail shipments. 

A seoond reason wholesalers are opposed to trucking is the 
unreliability of many drivers. Because of this they do not- know 
whether the goods will be left exposed in the sun, suffer from rain 
or dust, or when the delivery mgy be made. The majority of drivers 
know very little about the proper way to handle perishables with 
the result that there is often unnecessary spoilage. The railways, 
because of specialized equipment and long experience, are able to 
reduce damage to the minimum. 

A third reason given for the unpopularity of trucking is that 
it upsets the orderliness of conducting the wholesale business. 

When shipments are to go by train the wholesaler knows what time 
the order has to be ready and arranges accordingly for shipments. 

The truck drivers call at all hours of the day. Often the 
greatest rush is just before closing time, when several truckers 
will be scrambling to get a load. Some drivers make a habit of 
spending considerable time in beer halls with the result that they 
are in no condition to pack a load or handle an injurable cargo. 

In conclusion it may be stated that trucking certainly has 
taken a place in the movement of fruits and vegetables. There 
is by no means universal approval of this method of transport. 

It would appear that the country merchant is more in favor of it 
than the wholesaler. Thequicker and more frequent service is the

chief reason. Also in many oases the driver has an account with 
the store for gasoline or family expenses which induoes the store¬ 
keeper to give him the business. 

The wholesalers were asked to state what they considered 
trucking had done to extend their business. This was difficult 
to answer but the majority of wholesalers considered trucking might 
have expanded their business by making it possible to get fresh 
supplies more frequently and by forcing down railway charges, 
allowing for lower prices.

CHAPTER X 

BB Q K BPAQfi 1 

The representative of an Edmonton fruit and vegetable 
brokerage, interviewed in September 19J4, assisted by giving 
the information which has been used in preparing this chapter. 

Function of a Broker 

The function of a brokerage was defined to be a marketing 
agency which consistently analyses markets daily with respect 
to all commodities handled by the fruit and vegetable wholesale 
trade. The broker is constantly in communication with sellers 
end buyers. He assembles information on production, on prices, 
on the condition of all markets within his range of operation, 
and on other matters affecting the movement of goods between 
producers or other primary sellers and the wholesalers or jobbers. 
The broker receives orders from the wholesalers or jobbers and fincfc 
sellers to fill these orders. Likewise he locates buyers for 
supplies offered. A broker may act for any number of sellers 
or buyers. 

Method and Scone of Business 2 

The Edmonton film under discussion conducted 95fo of its 
business by wire. 


1 There are two brokerage firms operating continuously in Edmonton

The largest account of this firm was with the Cooperative 
Selling Agency in British Columbia which was stated to handle 
approximately 4000 carloads of fruit and vegetables a year. The 
Edmonton firm did 6£f 0 to 7£^ of its business by selling Canadian 
products, the bulk of which were from British Columbia. The 
balance of the business was done by handling foreign fruits and 
vegetables. All of the fruit and practically all of the vege¬ 
tables sold came from outside Alberta. 

The firm was handling on the average 20 carloads of fruit 
and vegetables a week. One hundred percent of the produce sold 
went to wholesalers. 

The approximate total value of produce sold by the film v/as 
$1,000,000 a year. The average value of a car of produce was 
about $1000, and about 1000 carloads were sold a year. 

The value of commodities sold in four seasons was approximate 
ly as follows 

Season Value 

November to April (£ months) $2£0,000 

April to July (£ months) 270,000 

July to September (2 months) 2£Q,00Q 

September to November (2 mos.) 2£Q,000 

This table shows that the value of the monthly business 
varied very greatly between seasons. The average monthly value 
for the five months, November to April, would be $£0,000; the 
average for the three months April to July would be $90,000; 

July and August would be $11£,000 a month, and September and

October, $12^,000. It was illustrated in Table X, page 8l, that 
August, September and October are the months of heaviest importa¬ 
tions* However, it is likely that these are two months when 
prices are the lowest because supply is the heaviest at this time* 

Brokerage Fees 

The firm investigated acted on the basis of a variable 
brokerage fee per car* The charge was said to be set by agree¬ 
ment between the broker and the seller before the car was sold 
by the broker. The commission charged varied for different 
commodities, but on the average it was estimated that it amounted 
to $20.00 per carload of commodities valued at approximately 
$ 1 , 000 .

CHAPTER XI 

THE EDMONTON FRUIT AMD VEGETABLE WHOLESALE TRADE 1 


Type of Business 

This study will include information concerning five fruit 
and vegetable wholesale firms investigated in September 1934, 

and eight included in the May 1933 survey. The majority of 

2 

the first group were included in the second survey. 

All of the firms were carrying a full stock of fruits and 

vegetables in season. Some of the firms carried general 

groceries and confectionary lines, others only confectionary 

goods, in addition to fruits and vegetables. The business in 

grocery or confectionary lines was not considered, nor was a 

record made in the surveys of the number of firms which were 

carrying these. It is likely some of the firms do the largest 

part of their business in groceries but for the majority of 

those investigated fruits and vegetables seemed to be the main 

business. The fruit and vegetable business is highly seasonal, 

and by carrying other lines it is possible to some extent to 

3 

stabilize the volume of business between seasons. 

The majority of firms were buying supplies through brokers. 


See appendix 8a for discussion by Gassels on the business 
organization of fruit and vegetable wholesale firms. 

2 Data obtained is contained in tables at the end of the chapter.

Table XVIII shows that only two out of five films did part of their 
business on commission. One of these firms did 95 % of its busi¬ 
ness on commission and the second did only If.. The firm which did 
95% of its business on commission did not buy through brokers, but 
obtained its supplies direct from growers. Table XVIII shows 
that three out of four firms purchased through brokers; two received 
100 % of supplies in this way, and a third 90 %. 

Four out of the five operators questioned in 1934 stated they 
acted on both a wholesale and jobbing basis, and one was wholesale 
only. 

.Bjancfa .AgSAPieg 

One out of eight firms investigated had branch agencies a£ 
the Edmonton firm. This firm had branches at Peace River and 
Grande Prairie, Alta. Practically all the firms were themselves 
actually branch agencies of national or international firms. 1 The 
Edmonton firm with the branches supplied these from Edmonton. 
Approximately 10% of the total business of the Edmonton firm was 
conducted through the two branch agencies. 

Number of years in Business . 

In order to deteimine whether the number of wholesale firms 
had increased in the last few years operators were asked to state 
how long they had been in business. However, the information 
was not very satisfactory due to the ambiguity of the question. 

Table XVIII shows the answers from five firms were that they had 
been in business from three to fifty-one years, and the average

The distance fruits and vegetables were shipped in each 
direction by the Edmonton wholesale firms investigated is shown 
in Table XIX. The table classifies the distances into ^0-mile 
groups, with a total range from 0 to A99 miles. It is shown 
that as the distance increased the number of firms shipping in 
each direction decreased. The table shows the distance varied 
in each direction which may be partly explained by the natural 
limits of the Edmonton marketing shed. Another factor is that 
business decreased directly with distance because of sparsity 
of settlement or competition with supplies from other wholesale 
centres. The north direction, which includes north and north¬ 
west, had the greatest distances, whioh were up to j>G0 miles. 

This was because Edmonton is the wholesale centre for the Peace 
River country to the north-west, and for the territory at least 
as far as McMurray, sane 3^0 miles north of Edmonton . In the 
east, south and west directions supplies from Edmonton meet those 
from other wholesale centres, thus the normal distance in these 

^ It is possible that some of the Edmonton managers construed 
the question to mean how long had the parent firm been in operation 
and not the time the Edmonton branch had operated. It was also 
learned that several changes in ownership have taken place in the 
last few years, in which case the person ansv/ering may have given 
the years the present owners had operated and not the time the 
warehouse had operated. The question should have asked ’’how long 
has this warehouse operated, under this or other management?".

directions was about 200 miles to 2^0 miles. There is some over¬ 
lapping in serving the intermediate territory lying about half way 
between two wholesale supply centres. 1 Table XX shows the average 
distance served in each direction. 

Number of Stores Supplied . 

Edmonton wholesale firms sold to city and country retail stores. 
The estimated number of city and country stores supplied by each 
firm is given in Table XXI. The table shows that the country 
stores, in all cases except one, exceeded the city stores. The 
average number of country stores supplied by eight firms was 405.6 
and the average number of city stores was 112#5, or approximately 
one fourth of the number of country stores. The average total 
stores served by eight firms was 518.1. The table shows that there 
was considerable difference between firms in the number of stores 
served, which would indicate a difference in the size of their 
business in fruit and vegetables. Table XXI also shows the total 
stores served by eight wholesale distributors to have been 4145, 
but this does not mean there were this number in the Edmonton 
marketing shed. A store may receive supplies from one or any 
number of wholesalers. 

^ It is difficult to explain why all the firms were not sending 
supplies in each direction. It is possible that insufficient care 
was used in taking the records to get the miles in each direction, 
as it was not directly asked of each firm whether it was distribu¬ 
ting goods in each direction. A number of wholesale firms operated 
under different names when they actually belonged to the same 
organization. (See appendix 8a). It is possible that these firms 
zoned the territory served by each subsidiary. This would decrease 
overlapping and likely lower distribution costs. No evidence was 
heard that this was done.

The percentage of fruits and vegetables sold between city 
and country stores is given for five firms in Table XXII. This 
shows that the estimated proportion of business between city and 
country varied considerably for different distributors. Some 
estimated the percentage greater to country that to city stores, 
and others the reverse. The average for the five operators was 
4670 to the city and ^4f 0 to the country stores. It is presumed 
that thesefigures were on the basis of value, but this was not 
specified in the schedule.^ 

Class of Purchasers from Wholesalers 

In the 1934 survey five wholesalers were asked if they sold 
to chain stores, fruit stores, unit grocery stores (independent 
groceries), restaurants,hotels, and wagon hucksters. One firm 
sold to all of these, one sold to all but hucksters, two sold to 
fruit stores and grocery stores only, and one sold to the three 
classes of stores. The information is summarized in Table XXIII. 


It would appear on this basis, as there were approximately four 
times as many country as city stores supplied (Table XXI) that the 
former purchased less fruits and vegetables than city stores. It 
would have been useful as an index of consumption of rural and urban 
populations if the wholesaler had been asked to state the propcation 
of eachof fruit and vegetables sold between the country and the city. 

2 The answers given to the question were unsatisfactory in that they 
were not uniform, some estimaged the percentage to each purchaser, 
while others gave a negative or affirmative answer. The question¬ 
naire should have asked the firms to indicate other customers, if 
any. It is likely that hospitals, colleges and other large con¬ 
suming institutions buy direct from wholesalers.

In this survey only one wholesaler indicated sales to hucksters, 
whereas in the May 1933 survey it was learned that eight firms 
sold to hucksters. The percentage of total sales is classified, 
with the numbers of firms in each class, in Table XXIV. Three 
wholesalers estimated less than 1% sold to hucksters, two esti¬ 
mated from 1% to 5 %, one from 5% to 10%, and two from 10% to 19%. 

The inconsistency in answers obtained in the two surveys cannot 
be explained. 

Purchase and Sale Value of Fruits and Vegetables Handled 

The estimated purchase and sale value of fruits and vegetables 
handled by five wholesale firms in 1933 is shown in Table XXV. The 
representatives questioned were usually reluctant about divulging 
information concerning volume of business. Two out of five 
operators gave the amounts paid for fruit and for vegetables, two 
gave the amount received from sale, and one gave neither figures. 

The estimated spread between purchase and sale value was obtained 
for the five firms. In preparing the table estimates were made 
of the purchase value of the fruits and vegetables for the two 
firms which gave the sale value by reducing this by the amount of 
their average spread. The sales value of fruits and vegetables 
for the two firms for which only purchase value was given was 
estimated by increasing the purchase value by the average spread. 
Because of the limited original information ana the crude method 
used to estimate values, this is of little significance* It 
does indicate that the value of fruit bought and sold by wholesalers

is approximately double that of vegetables. 1 
Sales Spread 

live wholesalers gave the range of the average spread they 
received. The percentage figures for each firm and the average 
for five firms is shown in Table XXV. The range in sales spread 
was from 0 to 2 Of.. The average for the five was from 6.4% to 
14.4f 0 . 

Additional information on sales spread was obtained (1) in 
January 19J6, when it was learned that wholesalers try to obtain 
l^fo increase over cost price. The spread was said to vary for 
different commodities, and also between different qualities of 
the same commodities. On some commodities the spread received was 
said to be less than Ijjf. and on others it was more. It was stated 
that it is a general policy among wholesalers to attempt to obtain 
on the average 1^% over cost price. The men who gave this in¬ 
formation stated that there was no set rule or code among whole¬ 
salers but that the policy was ‘’in the nature of an unwritten rule”. 

Local wholesalers make a practice of meeting at least once 
or twice a week to discuss prices, stocks of goods, and other 
problems related to their business. The frequency of the meetings 

p 

varies with the amount of business and the condition of markets. 

^ This is partly because practically all fruit goes from the whole¬ 
salers to the retailers, whereas vegetables are purchased from 
several sources. The majority of local grown summer and winter 
vegetables are not sold to wholesalers but are sold direct by the 
producers to retailers or consumers. It should therefore not 
be inferred from Table XXV that the public spend more on fruits 
than on vegetables. This cannot be stated definitely until an 
expenditure study is made.

In the survey statements were heard such as "Chiseling whole¬ 
salers out prices";"competition is more severe in Edmonton than 
any other city," In May it was learned that eleven wholesale 

firms had operated during the year. This would indicate that the 
stock held in the city must have been quite large and because of 
its perishability would allow little opportunity to control prices. 

Operators of small firms claimed that pressure from large 
firms made business very difficult. 

It may be stated that although eleven firms may have seemingly 
been in operation, actually there were less than this because 
some of the firms were branches of the same company but operating 
under different names. 1 ” 

Source of Supplies 

The question of supplies has been discussed in chapters III 

and IV, and will not be repeated here except to emphasize that the 

wholesalers obtain practically all their supplies from domestic 

2 

and foreign sources. 

It may be stated that no local grown fruit is sold to whole¬ 
salers and Table XXVI illustrates the small proportion of total 
vegetables bought which are local grown. Three out of five 
wholesale operators stated they bought seme local vegetables and 
two bought none. Table XXVI shows that the average purchases of 
vegetables by four firms were 3.7°/, from local and 96.5% from 
domestic and foreign producers. 

1 See appendix 8 a. 

2 Table VIII, pages 77—78, shows the ear arrivals of foreign and 
domestic fruit and vegetables to Edmonton Wholesalers.

The vegetables sold by wholesalers are mostly fresh vegetables 
which either cannot be grown locally or are sold when the local 
are out of season* 

The main reason wholesalers do not sell more local vegetables 
is that these are sold through more direct channels. The whole¬ 
saler ordinarily has to offer a lower price than the retailer or 
ultimate consumers. It is necessary to keep in mind that a profit 
has to be made, storage risk taken, and often a period of waiting 
for an uncertain market* 

There has been some increased purchasing of local storage 
vegetables in the last two or three years. This has been chiefly 
because wholesalers have adopted a policy of washing storage 
vegetables by large machine equipment. The washed vegetables 
when placed on the retail show counters are more attractive and 
better able to compete with fresh vegetables. The washing policy 
has thus tended to increase and prolong the sale of local storage 
vegetables to consumers who would otherwise have purchased fresh 
vegetables (6). 

Storing of Stock 

Five wholesale firms were questioned on the capacity and 
adequacy of their storage facilities* The answers are summarized 
in Table XXVII. The common and cold storage capacity of five 
firms varied from five to twenty carloads. The average capacity 
of five firms was 11.6 carloads. Four films stated that their 
common and cold storage facilities were adequate and no answer on 
this was obtained for the fifth firm. 

The five firms questioned had rail facilities direct to the

warehouse door. This is a great advantage in that supplies 
can be removed directly from refrigeration cars to warehouse 
cold storage which reduces the time of exposure to higher tempera¬ 
tures to the minimum. 

It was learned that all the larger or permanent wholesalers 
have artificial freezing equipment for cold storage rooms (6). 

Percentage. of.J^factivjgL Goods Received 

The wholesalers v/ere asked to estimate the percentage of 
fruits and vegetables which were defective on arrival. The 
estimates by five operators varied considerably. These are shown 
in Table XXVIII to range from less than 1% to 15°/ 0 . Estimates 
for two firms were or less, and for three firms 10f o or more. 

The average of the estimated percentages of fruits and vegetables 
defective was 8f 0 for five firms. 

The chief causes of defect were stated to be rot, over-heating, 
shipping too ripe, and weathering. 

Method of Selling 

Eight wholesalers were questioned in May 1935 on 'tk© methods 
they were using to sell fruits and vegetables. The answers are 
summarized in Tables XXIX, XXX and XXXI. The two important methods 
were by salesmen and direct orders, but seme firms used circulars 
for country sales. Table XX,IX shows the percentage sold by each 
firm by the three methods. 1 The percentage sold by each method 

1 In the survey a salesman order was explained to mean any order 
completed by a salesman when soliciting outside of the warehouse. A 
direct order was to mean one received by 1 phone, wire, letter, or by 
the customer entering the wholesale premises to place an order. 

It was found that some wholesale firms use circulars to take orders 
It was not explained exactly what constituted a circular. Certain

varied considerably between firms. 

In Table XXIX the percentages sold by each method are grouped 
into classes, and opposite each percentage class is shown the 
number of firms in the class. This shows that eight firms sold 
from 40% to 100% of their city sales by salesmen and from 0% to 54% 
by direct order. One wholesaler attributed all city sales to 
salesmen. It is likely this operator considered as salesmen 
orders the sales made by employees in the warehouses. Six firms 
used salesmen for taking country orders and sold from 25 % to 100% 
by this method. Two firms made from 85% to 95 % of their country 
sales by salesmen and two operators attributed 100% of their country 
sales to salesmen. Three firms made no sales in the country by 
direct order, two firms sold 10% to 24% in this way, one from 40% to 
54%, and two firms made 100% of country sales by direct order. 

The representative of one firm estimated that 70% to 80% of its 
country sales were made through circulars. Representatives of 
only two firms mentioned circulars as a method of sale and one of 
these considered circular sales unimportant. Apparently circulars 
are employed by fev/ firms and when used are for country orders only. 


firms send out price lists and other advertising matter which might 
be classed as circulars. Presumably a circular evidently is in the 
nature of a mail order. 

It was very difficult for firms to distinguish between a salesman 
order and a direct order because there is no clear distinction. It 
was also difficult to distinguish the difference in the quantity 
sold by salesmen on the street or in the country and by salesmen in 
the warehouse. 

A salesman may interview a retail manager and not succeed in 
closing a sale. A few days later the same retail manager may send 
an order by T phone, telegram, or letter, requesting the delivery 
of certain goods. The difficulty was to distinguish whether to class 
an order of this type as a salesman or direct order. Because of 
this difficulty it is likely that operators varied in making the 
distinction. 

It was equally difficult to distinguish between a sale by circular 
and a direct order.

The average percentage of sales in the city by eight firms 
was 24f 0 by direct order and 76% by salesmen. The average for 
country sales was by direct order, 58 % by salesmen ana 9% 
by circulars. These figures are showrjin Table XXX. 

Table XXXI shows the number of firms using salesmen and direct 
orders in the city and country. Eight out of eight firms used 
salesmen in the city and six sold by salesmen in the country. 

Seven firms sold by direct order in the city and five by this 
method in the country. One firm sold by salesmen only in the 
city and two firms by salesmen only in the country. No firms 
used direct orders only in the city but three firms used this 
method entirely for country sales. 

Spread to Cover Sales Cost 

The firms were asked in May 1935 estimate what was the 
necessary spread over purchase price of goods to cover the costs 
of selling. Sales costs were to include salaries and expenses of 
salesmen, advertising and other circulars, telegram and telephone 
charges, and other costs arising out of selling. 

This was a difficult question because of joint costs and the 
difficulty in determining what costs to attribute to selling only. 
The answers obtained from six operators varied considerably* and 
ranged from if. to 8.9%. The spreads with the number of firms are 
classified into groups in Table XXXII. Only one firm was in the 
group over 

An important item that might be included in city selling costs 
was the cost of operating trucks. All firms were operating their 
own trucks to make city deliveries, and made no direct charge for

this service. Occasionally in rushed seasons commercial truckers 
are hired. 

Financing of Purchases 

Fight wholesalers were asked to state how the purchasing of 
supplies was financed and what percentage was bought for cash and 
what percentage on time. The answers were rather indefinite as 
the wholesalers considered 7 to 13 days before settlement being 
equivalent to cash. Most of the men questioned stated that cash 
was paid for foreign goods as these were bought on a sight draft. 
Domestic shippers usually allowed from 7 to 1.5 days for settlement, 
but some shipments were purchased on a 15 day draft. A sight draft 
was considered as cash. The limit of credit time given to whole¬ 
salers on the purchases of fruits and vegetables was 15 days. In 
general they make payments on sight or within 15 days. 

Table XXXIII summarizes the answers received on cash and credit 
purchases. 

The wholesalers were also asked whether they were using bank 
credit to finance purchases. The firms that were branches of a 
central organization indicated that credit arrangements were made 
through the head office. In some cases it was inferred that most 
payments for supplies were made through the head office. Y/here 
additional funds were needed for purchases by branch firms these 
were generally obtained from the head office instead oi local 
banks. It was indicated that the head office had to borrow from 
banks or obtain funds from some other source. 

Managers of independent firms indicated that they maintained 
a line of credit with local banks. Managers of both independent

and branch firms were reluctant to discuss borrowing and financing, 
and answers obtained were vague. Apparently the amount of credit 
used varied between the firms. The interest charged on loans 
was stated to vary according to arrangement between the wholesaler 
and the banker and the credit standing of the firm. 

Cash and Credit Sales. ^ 

The average percentage of cash and credit, sales by seven 
wholesale operators is shown in Table XXXIV. The average cash 
sales by seven firms was 16.4 % and the average credit sales was 

83 . 6 %. 

The general length of time given on credit sales was 13 to 
30 days, but the length of time varied for different purchasers. 

Some of the wholesalers stated it was often necessary to extend 
time beyond this in order to get the business. Ko?/ever, because 
of many outstanding accounts it was stated that it has been neces¬ 
sary in the past three or four years to curtail the length of time 
and the amount of credit given. 

A representative of one firm stated that 7j?f<> of its city 
sales were for cash and 2 . 5 % on 13 days (usually) credit, and 100f o 
of the country sales were sold on 13 to days credit. It was 
learned that limited credit was usually given to "approved" customers* 
In general no interest was charged on 13 to JO day accounts. 

On accounts running over this time 7f° was usually charged. On 
short credit no interest was charged "in order to maintain the 
goodwill of the customer 11 . Interest is charged on overdue accounts

in order to encourage settlement and because wholesalers have to 
borrow at interest in order to carry the creditor. 

It would seem that there is no set policy regarding credit 
given by the wholesalers. The arrangements apparently vary between 
different wholesalers and between different customers. It is 
necessary, if one extends credit, for the others to do the same. 

In general wholesalers give limited time to steady and reliable 
customers and no interest is charged on 15 to 30 days credit. 

Where the ability to pay is uncertain no time is allowed or, if 
given, interest is charged. 

Advertising Policy 

In May 1935 opinions on advertising and the amount of 
advertising by each of seven firms were obtained. Four out of 
seven firms did no advertising. One firm did a small amount in 
country magazines and used neon signs to a limited extent in the 
city. A second firm did a small amount of advertising and a third 
circulated monthly price lists which were occasionally supplemented 
by weekly lists. 

It would appear that the majority of wholesalers consider 

1 

local advertising of minor value. 

Trend of Wholesale Business 

The wholesalers were asked in May 1935 what they considered 
had been the decline in prices and volume of business after 1929* 

The answers were quite variable. It would seem from the answers 
that certain firms had expanded during the interval while others

had declined. Each wholesaler thus gave an answer based on his 
own business rather than on the total sale volume of fruits and 
vegetables. Four out of six wholesalers who gave answers to these 
questions considered that the volume of business had increased. 

One considered the volume of fruit sold had increased by 10f o . A 
second gave the volume of business done in 1930 as $627,784 and 
in 1934 as $617,000. The same wholesaler considered that prices 
had dropped so that the decline of approximately $11,000 would 
not necessarily mean less goods were sold, as in fact he stated 
that the volume had increased, but could not give the amount. A 
fifth operator considered that there had been no decline in volume 
of business after 1929 , but did not think there had been any in¬ 
crease. Only one firm out of six considered there had been a 
decline in volume of business, and placed this at 20f o . Four out 
of six stated prices had declined after 1929* 

The operators who stated business had increased were asked to 
give the reasons. Three out of four ventured answers. Two of 
these considered it was due mainly to the decline in prices after 
192 ?, and a third considered it was because of a more vigorous 
sales policy. 

In the light of certain evidence one is inclined to aoubt that 
there was an increase in business from 192 ? to 1935* Tile record 1 
of importations of fruits and vegetables showed the 1929 importations 
to Edmonton to have been 1729 carloads and in 1930 to have been 
1239 carloads. This last quantity was ®roximately representative 
of the number imported each year from 1930 to 1934 inclusive.

Some of the wholesalers were selling confectionary and 
general grocery lines which included canned and boxed (dried fruit) 
fruit and vegetables. There has been an increase during the 
last decade in consumption of canned fruits and vegetables. 1 It 
is possible there has been an increase in the sale of these in 
Edmonton and in answering the questions on volume of business 
operators were considering their business as a whole. 

Summary and General Conclusions 

Some Edmonton fruit and vegetable wholesalers sell confection¬ 
ary and general grocery lines. 

Practically all firms purchase supplies through brokers. Some 
small firms operate partly on a commission basis. 

Only one out of eight firms had Alberta branches. The major¬ 
ity of firms were themselves branches. 

Edmonton wholesalers send supplies about 500 miles northwest, 
and about 200 to 300 miles in other directions. 

Eight firms served on the average 405 .6 country retail stores, 
and 112.5 oity stores. The average of total business attributed 
to country sales was 54f« and to city sales 46%• 

The value of fruit handled by five wholesalers in 1933 was 


"The improved methods of preserving the freshness of preserved 
fruits and vegetables has greatly increased the demand for processed 
products. During the period 1923-1930 the volume of vegetable pre¬ 
parations produced increased 149fo* This growth is indeed remarkable 
as it represents a corresponding increase in the domestic demand for 
these products, the foreign trade being relatively small as compared 
with domestic production. 11

approximately double the value ofvegetables. 

The average sales spread reported by wholesalers was 6.4$, to 
14.4/!,. Wholesalers attempt to get 13$, above cost price. At 
least some of the managers meet at least once a week to discuss 
prices and stocks, etc. 

Edmonton wholesale firms ob-tain practically their complete 
supply of fruits and vegetables from domestic or foreign sources. 
It was estimated that only 3 . 7 $, of all vegetables were purchased 
from local growers. 

The average common and cold storage capacity of five firms 
was 11.6 carloads. Rail facilities to the warehouse door are 
provided. 

It was estimated that 8 $, of goods received are defective. 

The two important methods of selling are by salesmen and by 
direct order. The average percentage of sales in the city was 
24$, by direct order and 76$> by salesmen; in the country it was 33 $, 
by direct order, and 38 $, by salesmen, and 9 % by circulars. 

Gash is paid on sight for supplies from foreign sources. 
Settlement for domestic purchases is usually made in 7 to 13 days. 

The average cash sales by seven firms was 16.4$,, and the 
average credit sales was 83 • 6 $,. Credit sales usually run for 

13 to 30 days. Interest is usually charged on accounts over 
30 days due. Credit is usually extended to "approved" customers. 

The majority of wholesalers questioned considered there had 
been no decline in the volume of business after 1929 but this is 
contrary to the record of carload arrivals.

CHAPTER XII 

I BM .EDMONTON RETAIL TRADE 

■IN-J.RUITS AND VEGETABLES 


Information concerning the retailing of fruits and vegetables 
by various classes of Edmonton stores was obtained in a survey 
conducted in September 1934. The main object of the survey was 
to determine the types of retail stores selling fruits and vege¬ 
tables, the proportion of stores selling these, the quantity, and 
classes sold, the source of supply, and other information con¬ 
cerning the retail trade. 

The data obtained in the survey has been compiled into tables^ 
which will be discussed throughout this chapter. 

Tyne of Retail Stores and Number Selling Fruit and Vegetables 

The numbers of various types of retail stores included in 
the survey are given in Table XXXV. The Table shows that there 

p 

were thirty-two independent^ grocery stores, four departmental 
two chain stores, 

stores,/two confectionaries, and two fruit stands, making a total 
of forty-two stores. All of the stores sold fruit, and forty 
out of forty-two sold vegetables. The two not selling vegetables 
were an independent grocery and one of the two fruit stands. 

Location of Stores 

The independent groceries, chain stores and confectionaries, 
were selected at random in various sections of the city in order 
to get a representation of stores catering to all income groups 

^ Tables to be referred to are at the end of the chapter. 

2 Independent stores were those operated as a private business. The 
average number of employees was two. Usually the ov/ner & his wife, 
or other member or members of the family, did all the work. 













172. 


and classes of people. The departmental stores were located in 
the main business section of the city and thus served a cosmopo¬ 
litan population. 

Radius Served 

The area served by each of twenty-eight independent groceries 
ranged from two to twenty-eight blocks. The number of stores 
serving to various distances is show in Table XXXVI. The most 
common distance was between four and six blocks; thirteen out of 
twenty-eight independent grocery operators gave this range as the 
normal territory served* Twenty-four out of twenty-eight inde¬ 
pendent stores were serving between two and ten blocks. One of 
the larger independent groceries sent goods all over the city. 

Four independent store operators did not give the distance served. 

The average distance served by each independent grocery, with 
the exception of one serving all sections of the city, was approxi¬ 
mately 6*7 blocks. 

The departmental stores sold to customers from all sections 
of the city and delivered orders to all sections of the city. 

One chain store sent goods to all sections of the city and 
one served from eight to ten blocks. 

One fruit stand and one confectionary sold to all sections 
of the city, and two stores gave no answers. 

A number of the independent groceries on the outskirts of 
the city sold to people living several miles in the country. One 
departmental store representative stated goods were often delivered 

several miles into the country.^ It is ^i^ e ^y # "kk&t^all^the. 

i it is likely that other departmental stores also delivered to a 
few miles in the country but did not indicate it to the enumerator.

departmental stores and many of the other stores located on main 
business sections sell fruits and vegetables to many country 
customers shopping in the city. 

It should not be concluded that only one store was selling 
within the range indicated for each store, as several stores may 
have been located in the same area. Also stores which sell goods 
•to all sections of the city would compete and customers may shop 
anywhere. 

When a comparison was made between the size of the store, 
measured by turnover on all commodities, the area served did not 
appear to increase with increase in turnover. 

Income and Occupational Groups Patronizing Retail Stores 1 

In order to learn something about the income and occupation 
of patrons of each store the operator was asked to state whether 
the majority were low, medium, or high income receivers, and whether 
they were laboring or of mixed occupations, or business and pro¬ 
fessional. The nature and number of answers for each class of 
store is shown in Table 2X&VII. 

Twenty-four out of thirty-two independent retail stores catered 
mainly to medium income receivers, seven reported mostly low in¬ 
come patrons, and one store had mostly high income patrons. Actu¬ 
ally all income receivers patronize the stores, but the above 
answers show that the medium income receivers predominated. The 
store with the majority of high income receivers was in a business 


1 See appendix 9a for discussion on the schedule question to 
determine income and occupational groups.

and professional residential section of the city. 

The departmental stores catered to all income groups. The 
two chain and confectionary stores served mainly medium income 
receivers. One fruit stand served mainly low income receivers 
and one had mostly medium income patrons. 

Twenty-nine out of forty-two retail stores of all types 
studied served mainly medium income receivers. 

The predominating occupation of patrons was laboring for all 
types of stores except the departmental, which served customers 
of all occupations. Out of thirty-two independent groceries 
twenty-five catered mainly to laboring, three to mixed, and four 
to business and professional patrons. Thirty out of forty-two 
stores served mostly laboring groups and eight catered to mixed 
occupations. Only four independent groceries out of forty-two 
stores of all types had mainly business and professional patrons. 

Turnover on All Commodities Sold bv Independent Groceries 

In Table XOTIII the turnover for the year ± 933 , for the 
independent grocery stores is grouped into nine classes of 
varying turnover on all commodities, including mainly groceries, 
fruits and vegetables. Turnover was considered as the total 
gross receipts from sales. 

The total range of turnove^for twenty-four stores for 
which this information was given was from $2,000 to over $^0,000. 


^ The turnover estimates on all commodities are considered as 
fairly reliable as some of the operators referred to their boohs, 
and the majority would likely have known this fairly accurately 
from memory.

The table shows the number of stores in each class or range of 
turnover. The largest group, or 26% of the stores, had a turn¬ 
over of $8,000 to $12,000. The two next largest groups were 
from $12,000 to $20,000 and from $20,000 to $30,000. Each of 
these groups contained 17% of 24 stores. Approximately 6o?„ 
of the independent groceries had a range of turnover from $8,000 
to $ 30 , 000 . 

Table XXXVIII shows that the stores varied very greatly in 
turnover. There did not seem to be any size of turnover which 
was the most common. 

The average turnover for twenty-four independent groceries 
was $19,34-8* 

Classification of Independent Groceries on Basis of 

TurnoveT^oiTi^uifs and Vegetables. 

The stores were classified as shown in Table XXXIX on the 
basis of total turnover on fruits and vegetables. Nine ranges 
of turnover are shown with a total range of 0 to $ 13,000 and 
over. .The number and percentage of stores in each range is 
shown. Thirty-five percent of the stores had a turnover on 
fruits and vegetables from $4,000 to $6,000, and 19fo had a turn¬ 
over between $2,000 and $4,000. Thirty-one percent were in the 
ranges below $2,000 and 13 % had a turnover from $8,000 to $ 13,000 
and over. Only two stores out of thirty-two had a turnover on 
fruits and vegetables over $13,000. The maximum turnover was 
$26,000 and the lowest $ 300 . 


"^See appendix 9b for discussion on estimating turnover on 
fruits and vegetables. 













176 . 


The turnover on fruits and vegetables to total turnover on 
all oonmiodities sold by twenty-four independent groceries was 
estimated to be 26 . 3 fo* Only twenty-four operators of independent 
groceries gave the turnover on all commodities for 1933 so that 
the turnover on fruits and vegetables for the same stores was 
used to derive the 26.3f<>. 

Turnover on Fruits and Vegetables bv Departmental Stores 

One departmental store had a turnover on fruits and vegetables 
between $2.5,000 and $30,000, two had turnovers between $30,000 and 
$33,000, and one had a turnover between $30,000 and $100,000. 

These figures are shown in Table XL. 

Total Value 1 of Fruit and Vegetables Bought, 1933 . 

Table XL I shows the value of fruit and vegetables bought 
by forty-one retail stores. The table also shows the value 
bought by stores of each type. 

The total value of fruit bought by forty-one stores was 
estimated to be $269,203, and the estimated value of vegetables 
was $32,693. The four departmental stores purchased about 
$20,000 worth of fruit more than thirty-two independent retail 
stores. The thirty-two independent stores purchased $ 1,300 
worth of vegetables more than the four departmental stores. 

For these two classes of stores the value of fruit bought was 
approximately five times that of vegetables. In the case of 

the two chain stores the value of fruit and vegetables^was. 

^ *Value'means*the*amount paid by the retailer. In some cases the 
operators gave the annual value of purchases of both fruits & vege¬ 
tables and in some cases the average weekly pur-chases only were 
given whichhedto be used to estimate the annual value. Because or 
the necessity of estimating the values the figures are not very re¬ 
liable. See appendix 9 b for discussion. 











177 . 


practically the same. Hov/ever, the proportion might have changed 
had more chain stores been included. It was found in all cases 
of the independent groceries and the departmental stores that the 
value of fruit handled always exceeded the value of vegetables. 

The fruit stand and the confectionary gave a low valuation 
for vegetables, which is to be expected as these do not fit into 
these businesses. 

It should not be concluded that the bulk or quantity of 
vegetables sold was less than fruit on the basis that the money 
value, was less in the cases shown. In proportion of total diet 
it might be shown that more vegetables were sold than fruit. No 
information was obtained on the relative weights or bulk sold of 
the two classes of food. 

Average Value of Fruit and Vegetables Bought 

The average value of fruits and of vegetables bought by 
forty-one retail stores of various types is shov/n in Table XLII. 
The average value of fruit bought by thirty-two independent 
groceries was 13,376, the average value of vegetables was $781, 
and the average value of both was $4,136. The average value 
of fruit was approximately five times the value of vegetables. 

The average value of fruit bought by four departmental 
stores was $32,013, the value of vegetables was $3,863, ana the 
value of both was $37,876. The average value of fruit was 
approximately five times the value of vegetables. 

The two chain stores handled practically the same value of 
vegetables as the independent stores but only about one fourth

They are generally similar in stock carried to other groceries. 

It is not however safe to make conclusions derived from a study 
of only two stores. 

The average value of fruit purchased by forty-one retail 
stores of the five types was #6,34-6, of vegetables $1,283, and 
of both it was $7,632. It is shown here also that the value of 
fruit was approximately five times the value of vegetables. 

The percentage value of vegetables to fruit is shown in Table 
XLIII to be 23?o for thirty-two independent grocery stores. 

Average Value ^of Vegetables Bought Weekly f 1955 . 

The average value of vegetables bought weekly during different 
seasons by five types of retail and. all stores studied is shown 
in Table XLIV. 

The average value of vegetables bought per week by thirty-two 
independent groceries was the greatest during the weeks of July 
and August when the average weekly value was $19.00. This was 
$3.00 greater than the next highest weekly value, occurring during 
the weeks of September to November, and $ 3*00 higher than the 
lowest period which was November to April 1 st. 

The highest weekly average value occurring during July and 
August corresponds with the months when local production of summer 
vegetables is usually the greatest. Also during this time the 
price of these is usually lower than during the weeks April to July 
when supplies are mostly from British Columbia. Because of lower 


^Value here means the total amount paid out for all vegetables.

prices of vegetables during July and August it would appear, on 
the basis of 1933 valuations of weekly purchases, that retail 
stores sell a larger volume of vegetables during these months. 

The highest average value of weekly purchases of vegetables 
for the four departmental stores was from April 1 st to July, when 
it was $ 131.00 The next highest period was from July 1 st to 
September, when the weekly purchases averaged $ 119 . 00 , or a decline 
of $ 12 . 00 , or about 9 % from the preceding period. The period 
of lowest average weekly value of vegetables purchased by the 
departmental stores was during September to November, when the 
average was $81.00, or a decline of $38.00 or 32% from the immedi¬ 
ately preceding eight weeks. The total decline was 38% from the 
highest weekly value period (April 1 - July). The average weekly 
value rose during the period November to April (3 months) to 
$ 113 . 00 , or a rise of from the low of $ 81.00 in September 
and October. 

No explanation was found for the average weekly purchases 
of departmental stores being the lowest during September and 
October, or why it was the highest during April to July. The 
last-mentioned period was the second lowest for the independent 
grocery stores. It would be expected that the period of highest 
value of weekly purchases would come at the same time for these 
two types of stores. 

A possible explanation for the low valuation of weekly 
purchases during September and October is that local storage 
vegetables are usually at their lowest prices for the year. 

This is usually explained by heavy offerings. Also at this 
time there is a lighter sale of summer vegetables, as the local

are out of season and imports have not started. Another reason 
for the low valuation might be that the demand was light because 
of home garden supplies which often last for a few weeks after 
harvest. On the basis of these explanations, however, one would 
expect that the average weekly purchases of independent stores 
would also have been lowest during September and October, whereas 
they were the second highest. In studying these figures it is 
also important to keep in giind the possibility of errors in esti¬ 
mates. It is likely, however, that most operators would know the 
periods when their average weekly purchases were the highest or 
lowest. 

The conclusion should not be made that September and October 
are always the months of lowest weekly value of purchases by 
departmental stores, or for that matter that the relative seasonal 
valuations are the same each year for any of the stores, as the 
figures shown are for one year only, and will have been influenced 
by prevailing prices. 

The operators of the confectionary and two fruit stands gave 
the same weekly value of purchases for all periods. This likely 
is representative, as these stores deal mostly in luxury or special 
vegetables. 

The period of the highest average weekly value of purchases 
of vegetables for the forty-one stores was July 1 st to September, 
when the average value was § 28 . 00 . For the weeks during April 
to July it was § 27 . 00 , and for the fall and winter months it was 
approximately §23*00* 

The highest value of weekly purchases was therefore during

the summer months. This is the period that summer vegetable 
prices are the lowest and therefore the figures cited illustrate 
that the largest volume is sold during these months. 

Average Value of Fruit Bought Weekly. 1955 . 

The average value of fruit purchased weekly by each type of 
store and for the total stores is shown in Table XLV. The period 

of highest purchases by practically all stores surveyed was July 
and August. For the departmental stores it was the same from 
July 1 st to November. The fruit stand operators gave September 
and October as the months of highest value of fruit bought, when 
it averaged $237*00 as compared with $212.00 during the weeks of 
July and August. The average weekly value of fruit bought by 
the fruit stands from November 1 st to April was $ 136 . 00 , or approxi 
mately 6 3 e /<> of the value during the highest value period. The 
22 weeks from November 1 st to April were the period of lowest 
average value of fruit bought each week for all the forty-one 
stores. 

The average values of fruit bought per week during the four 
periods for forty-one stores of all types, were as follows:- 
November 1 st to April, $ 100 ; April 1 st to July, $ 109 » 1 st 

to September, $ 161 ; and September 1 st to November, $ 133 * 

The average weekly value per store for the year was 47 ^ for 
thirty-two independent groceries, $613 for four departmental stores 
$16 for two chain stores, $35 for one confectionary, and $190 for 
two fruit stands. 

Considering the independent groceries, there was a decline in 
the value of weekly purchases during winter and spring from the

In the case of depart- 


summer and fall purchases by about 28°/,. 
mental stores, the decline when comparing the same periods was 
approximately 

Fruits usually are at higher prices during winter and spring 
than during the summer and fall, therefore from the above figures, 
to the extent to which these are representative of other years, 
one may conclude that a greater quantity of fruit is sold in the 
summer and fall than during the winter and spring* This is to 
be expected because many fruits that cannot be stored are only 
consumed fresh during the growing season and also home canning 
is done in the summer and fall. 

Classification of Fruit .Bought. 

The fruit commonly on sale in Edmonton was divided in the 
survey schedule into the four following classes: 1) citrous, 2) 
apples, pears, peaches, etc., p)canteloupes, watermelons, etc., 
and 4 ) small fruits. The store operators were asked to state 
what percentage the fruit in each of these groups normally com¬ 
prised of all the fruit. The averages of the percentages given 
by the operators are shown in Table XLVI. The averages for 
independent grocery, departmental, chain and confectionary stores 
were from 33% to 33% for the citrous group; from 36% to 45 f, for 
the apple, etc. group; for the canteloupe etc. group 15 % to 20%; 
and for small fruits from 7% ?%• The Percentages were also 

quite close between individual operators of the four types of 
stores. 

In the case of the one fruit stand studied, the percentages 
were 15% to the citrous group; 35 % apples, pears, etc.; 35 % cante-

loupes etc.; and 13 % to small fruit. The fruit stand therefore, 
compared with the other stores, carried a smaller proportion of 
citrous fruits and a larger proportion of the centeloupes, water¬ 
melons group, and also double the percentagescf small fruits. 

It is presumed that the store operators gave these answers 
on the basis of value but this cannot be stated definitely, as 
this was not stipulated in the schedule. It is possible that 
some of the operators may have based their estimates on bulk. 

Assuming that the percentages were on the basis of value 
and that the selling price of all fruit was increased over cost 
by the same margin or spread, the figures are likely a fairly 
close approximation of proportional amount spent by consumers 
for each class of fruit. It is unlikely, however, that margins 
would be the same at any one period because of annual variations 
in supply. Even if the above figures are approximately representa¬ 
tive of the proportional amount spent for each class of fruit, they 
do not give a clue as to what percentage each group comprises of 
total fruit consumed. In order to determine this, prices would 
have to be compared. 

Type and Origin of Vegetables 

In order to determine where retail stores were purchasing 
supplies, and what proportion of the total was local grown, vege¬ 
tables were divided into two groups on the basis of storage or 
bunch vegetables and summer vegetables. The first group will be 
referred to for simplification as Group A, and comprised such 
vegetables as potatoes, cabbage, carrots, turnips, beets and pars¬ 
nips. Local grown vegetables of Group A are on sale in Edmonton

either fresh or from storage practically the entire year. Fresh 
imported vegetables of this type are also sold in Edmonton from 
Christmas to July. 1 2 Information concerning Group A is summarized 
in Table XLVII. 

The second group, to be referred to as Group B, comprised 
such vegetables as tomatoes, lettuce, celery, cucumbers, onions 
and. other incidental vegetables. The majority of these are sold 
by local growers during the summer and fall months and from other 
sources during winter and spring. 

Information on the percentage of vegetables imported and of 
local origin was not obtained from all operators, therefore figures 
may not be representative of all stores surveyed. 

The average of the percentages given by eleven out of thirty- 
two operators was that 13 % of Group A vegetables were imported, 
and 87% were local grown. Representatives of two departmental 
stores, two confectionary, one chain store and one fruit stand, 

2 

stated that 100 % of Group A vegetables purchased were local grown. 

The percentage imported for stores of all types was 8% and 
local grown was 92%. 

Group A. vegetables comprised 38% of all vegetables purchased 
by 32 independent groceries, 68% of those bought by four departmen- 

1 See chapters III, IV & V, on production and source of supply. 

2 It is not likely these figures are representative because conver¬ 
sations with buyers and inspection of vegetables on show counters 
indicated that these stores sell fresh imported vegetables of 
Group A before local fresh are ready. It is likely that there 
was some misunderstanding of the question on the schedule.

tal stores, 33% of vegetables bought by two chain stores, and 43% 
to 30% bought by the two confectionaries and one fruit stand. For 
the forty-one stores they comprised 43%. It is, presumed that these 
estimates were on the basis of value. These figures would indicate 
that the departmental stores handle a higher proportion of Group A 
vegetables than other stores. Their average estimate was 30 % higher 
than the average of 38% for the independent groceries. The averages 
for the other stores ?/ere between the groceries and the departmental 
stores. 

The information concerning Group B. vegetables is summarized 
in Table SLVIII. The averages for ten groceries and two departmen¬ 
tal stores were that approximately 75% of vegetables in this group 
were imported and 23% purchased were Edmonton grown. One chain 

store operator gave the percentages as 60 % imported and 40 % local 
grown. The operators of a fruit stand and a confectionary gave 
estimates of from 80% to 90% imported and from 10% to 20% local. 

For fifteen stores of all types the average was 75 % imported and 
25% local origin. 

The average percentage Group B. comprised of the value of all 
vegetables was 62% for thirty-two independent groceries; 32% for 
the four departmental stores; and for the two chain stores, two 
confectionaries, and one fruit stand the percentages averaged 
between 43% and 33%. For the forty-two stores, Group B. vegetables 
averaged 37% of the value of all vegetables. 

The percentage of total value of all vegetables bought attri¬ 
buted to Group A. and to Group B. is summarized in Table XLIX. 

On the basis of percentage of all vegetables it would seem

that the departmental stores carry a larger proportion of Group 

A. to total vegetables than do the other retail stores. The most 
important source of supply for group A. vegetables is the Edmonton 
district. It would therefore seem safe to conclude that the 
departmental stores handle a greater proportion of local vegetables 
compared with imported vegetables than do the other retail stores. 
The answers to this question were to indicate the normal, ana not 
any particular year. 

Table XLVII shows the average for seventeen stores was 8f 0 
of Group A. vegetables were imported and 92 fo were local grown. 

Table XLVII I shows the average for fifteen stores was 15 % Group 

B. were imported and 25 % were Edmonton produced. These figures 
were presumed to represent percentages of total value. It should 
not be concluded that they are also representative of bulk because 
imported vegetables generally have considerably higher unit values 
than local vegetables of the same hind. On the basis of bulk, 
therefore, the percentage imported would be less than when based 
on value. 

Source of Vegetables for Retail Stores. 

The retailers were asked if they were buying vegetables from 
the following sellers: local growers at public market; local growers 
at farms; local growers selling at the store door; dealers selling 
local produce; wholesalers; or whether they were importing directly. 
The number of operators indicating each of these sources is shown 
in Table L. 

The two main sources were local growers at the store door, and 
the wholesale houses. Twenty-six out of thirty-two independent

retailers, four out of four departmental stores, both chain stores, 
the two confectionaries and one fruit stand, bought from growers 
canvassing at the store. All the stores except two independent 
retail and one departmental store bought from Edmonton wholesalers. 
Only three independent grocery stores purchased from growers at 
their farms. This question asked whether the store operator went 
to the farm to buy supplies. There was just one store which 
obtained part of its supplies from dealers handling local vegetables. 
It would appear that dealers are unimportant distributors in 
Edmonton. 

One departmental store only was importing vegetables direct 
and not buying from Edmonton wholesalers. 

None of the forty-two stores purchased from producers selling 
at the public market. 

The store operators were also asked to estimate the percen¬ 
tages of total vegetables that were obtained from each of the 
previously listed sources of supply. The average percentage 
from each source is shown in Table LI. 

In percentage of total supply the two sources supplying the 

largest percentage were growers canvassing the stores, and the 

the wholesalers. The average percentage for forty-two stores 

was 481 from the growers and 49 % from the wholesalers. The 
1 classes of 

percentage purchased from other sources by any of the/stores 
was 3 fo or less. For all the stores growers selling at the store, 
and wholesalers, accounted for 97 % of "kko supply. One may con¬ 
clude that for practically all retail stores, growers canvassing 
the store and the wholesalers each supply 50 c ] o of the vegetables 





188. 


handled. It is presumed that the percentages were given on the 
basis of value. It was shown in Table XXVI, page 166 , that 
Edmonton wholesalers import 96 . 3 %-of their supply of vegetables. 

This means that practically all of the vegetables obtained by 
retailers from the wholesalers were imported. On basis of value, 
therefore, Edmonton producers supply practically 30 c / o of the vege¬ 
tables handled by Edmonton retailers. On the basis of bulk this 
would be greater because of higher unit value of imported vegetables. 

The departmental stores obtained 38% of vegetable supplies 

from local growers and the retail stores 42 °/ 0 . This verifies the 

statement made previously that the departmental stores apparently 

handle a higher proportion of Edmonton produced vegetables than 

do the independent retail stores. The one departmental store 

and 95% 

which did its own importing obtained 5% in this way/from local 
producers. 

Source of Eruit Handled by Retail Stores 

It was assumed that retail stores obtain practically all 
fruit except a small amount of small fruit from wholesalers, as 
practically all fruit is imported. The retailers were therefore 
asked to estimate the percentage small fruit comprised of total 
fruit handled and what percentage of small fruit was purchased 
from local producers. The average percentages are shown in 
Table LII. Eor all stores except one fruit stand, small fruits 
comprised from 7 to % of all fruit. However only the independent 
groceries, departmental and chain stores purchased from local 
growers. The average amount of small fruit from local producers 
was 4 . 4 % for the independent stores, 2.3% for departmental stores,

and 0.2,5'/, for two chain stores. This information verifies the 
statement made in the section on production, that small fruit 
growing is unimportant in the Edmonton district. 

Margln 1 between Retail Cost and selling Price . 

The retail store operators were asked "on what basis do you 
determine your sales spread?" The question was ambiguous, which 

resulted in variable answers. Some of the operators gave answers 

such as the following: " 25 % to break even"; " 30 °/ o to break even"; 

" 3 Ofo necessary"; "to cover expenses and risk"; "prices set according 
to downtown stores to keep customers"; "competition"; "competition 
with chain stores"; etc* Fifteen out of thirty-two of the opera¬ 
tors of independent groceries gave estimates of the percentage 
spread which averaged approximately 23 %. Two departmental store 
operators gave the percentage between 20f 0 and 23 %. A third stated 
that seasonal demand was the basis of spread. One fruit stand 
operator gave lQf. to as the basis and the second stated that 
the price was set at whatever could be obtained. Two chain store 
operators gave 13f* ^ 6 basis of spread. Eleven operators of 

independent retail stores stated that price was set by competition 

2 

with chain stores. 

Table LIII has been constructed out of this variation of 
answers. The table is arranged with the spread divided into 

1 Margin is considered as synonymous with "spread". The latter. 
term was used in the schedule and so will be used in the discussion. 

2 It will be noted that the question did not ask what spread was . 
received or what was necessary. The above type of answers would in¬ 
dicate that both interpretations were taken by different operators. 
It cannot be stated in most cases whether the percentage answers 
were the actual spread received or what the operator considered 
necessary.

nine classes with a total range from 10% to 50 % and over. The 
width of the class range is 5%* The distribution and percentage 
distribution of the total of 26 independent retail stores is given 
for each class. The twenty-six stores were the fifteen for which 
a percentage spread was given and eleven stores whose operators 
gave "competition with chain stores" as the basis of spread. The 
two chain stores gave lj>% as the basis therefore the eleven stores 
were arbitrarily given 15 % spread and have been included in the 
table in the 15% to 20% class . 1 No stores were in the 10% to 15% 
class, 18 stores or 69 % were in the 15 % to 20 % class, 7 stores or 
27% were in the four classes from 20 °% to 40%. 

The variable interpretations that could be given the majority 
of answers, used to construct the table make it of doubtful signi¬ 
ficance. 

Throughout the survey protests were heard that competition 
resulted in considerable price cutting and resulting business 
losses. Competition as the determiner of retail prices was the 
key-note throughout. Considerable criticism was heard against 
price cutting by chain stores and against departmental stores for 
using fruits and vegetables as leaders. No proof was given of 
price cutting by any stores. These two classes of stores seemed 
to cause the strongest competition. Stores away from the main 
business section, i.e. in residential districts, indicated that 
their prices were regulated by prices set by chain stores and stores 
operated in the main business section. These were referred to 

1 It would seem reasonable to suppose that independent groceries & 
chain stores would have to pay approximately the same price for 
supplies of the same quality and type and, if in competition, sell 
at approximately the same price.

The Relation of Spread to Turnover 

It was not possible to correlate spread against volume of 
business and make any satisfactory conclusion, because of uncertain¬ 
ty of the nature of the answers. Tables LIV, LV and LVI, however, 
were constructed in order to see if there was any noticeable 
change in spread with the various turnovers. 

Table LIV has the twenty-six independent retail stores 
arranged in increasing order of turnover on fruits and vegetables. 
The basis of spread in percentage for each store is also shown. 
Distinction is made in the table between the stores which gave 
a percentage ana the stores which gave competition and which were 
given an arbitrary spread of l*>f«. From this arrangement it was 
not possible to recognise any change in the basis of spread as the 
turnover increased or decreased. 

The turnover on all commodities handled is included in order 
to show that this turnover does not consistently increase with 
turnover on fruits and vegetables, although it tended to do so. 

In Table LV the independent grocery stores are classified 
according to various ranges of turnover on fruits and vegetables. 

The average basis of spread for the stores included in each range 
is shown. The first range is $400 to $1000 and includes four 
stores with an average percentage spread of l^f®. The next range 
is from $1^00 to I2200 1 and in this were four stores with an 

^ There is a break in the continuity of the turnover ranges, i.e. 
from ilOOO, the endpoint for the first rangeland $1500, the begin¬ 
ning point of the second range. This break in continuity is made 
between the ranges in both Tables LY and LVI as there were no stores 
in the intervals.

average spread of 20.5f 0 

These two tables, LY and LYI, show that the percentage spread 
tended to increase as the turnover increased. This is more clear 
in Table LVI, which correlates spread and turnover on all commodi¬ 
ties. In Table LYI the average for three stores is being com¬ 
pared with the average for nine stores and it is therefore not 
safe to draw conclusions when the average is basea on so few stores. 
Table LIV will show that the average for the stores with the high 
turnover is heavily weighted by one store which gave j?0f o as the 
necessary basis of spread. It is probable that if a different 
grouping had been made different average percentages might have 
been found. Table LYI has less stores than the other two tables 
as only nineteen stores gave their total turnover on all commodi¬ 
ties in 1955. The average spreads include the l^f 0 arbitrary 
spread given to certain stores, which may have influenced the 
averages more than if the actual spread of these stores were known. 

In accepting the figures in these tables it should be kept 
in mind that operators were not asked what spread they received 
but what was their basis of spread. They may have tried to get 
the spread they gave in the answers, butno proof can be given of 
what spread was received. 

The spread will ordinarily vary on different commodities and 
at different times on the same commodity, i.e. the spread is usually 
the greatest between the wholesale and retail prices when vege¬ 
tables first enter the market at the beginning of the season., 

It is also likely that the necessary spread varies between stores. 1

193- 


Tr^n<L._in_BjiMness 19.29. - 1914 . 

In order to learn something of the trend in the retail 
business after 1929 the operators were asked to give their 1929 
and 1933 turnovers. Turnovers for the two years were obtained 
from fifteen independent retail operators. The average turnover 
during the two years for the fifteen stores is given in Table LVII. 
The average turnover on all commodities in 1929 was $28,933 and 
in 1933 it was $19,803, a decline of $8,730? or 30.7f°. This does 
not mean that the volume of goods sold declined to the same extent 
as the price per unit decreased in the period. It should be 
remembered also that the figures are not proof that the business 
in fruits and vegetables corresponded to all commodities. 1 


Summary and Gene-ralJLojac lusi on.s 

The study was based on the 1933 business year for fortytwo 
retail stores of various types. All the stores sold fruit and 
forty out of forty-two sold vegetables. 

The stores were selected at random to represent all sections 
of the city. 

The departmental and a few other stores so].d to customers 
in all sections of the city. The average distance served by 
independent retail stores was 6.7 blocks. Independent groceries 
with large turnovers did not seem to serve larger areas than those 
with a small turnover. 

Twenty-nine out of forty-two stores served mainly patrons 


1 Index figures of Canadian retail prices of food give 1926 as 100, 

1929: 101.0, 1930: 98.6, 1931: 77.3, 1932: 64.3 and 1933 63-4. 

These figures would indicate a drop of 37-6 in 'the index between 
1929 and 1933. (Index figures from Dominion Bureau of Statistics, 
cited in Financial Post Year Book, 1934, page 117•)

of medium income. 

The predominating occupation of patrons was laboring, for the 
independent groceries and chain stores. Departmental stores 
catered to all income and occupational groups. 

The independent groceries ranged in size of turnover on all 
commodities from $2,000 to $. 50 , 000 ; 60% had turnovers between 
$8,000 and $30,000. The average turnover on all commodities 
handled by the independent groceries was $19,348. 

The turnover on fruits and vegetables sold by independent 
groceries ranged from $300 to $26,000, but for thirty out of 
thirty-two it was under $13,000. The turnover on fruits and 
vegetables was approximately 26.3°/ 0 of the total turnover. 

Four departmental stores had turnovers on fruits and vege¬ 
tables from $ 23,000 to $100,000. 

The value of vegetables handled was approximately one fifth 
the value of fruit. 

The value of average weekly purchases of vegetables by 
independent groceries was highest in July and August when it 
was $19. It was lowest from November 1st to April, when it 
was $14. 

The value of average weekly purchases of vegetables by 
the departmental stores was highest from April 1st to July, when 
it was $131. It was lowest during September and October when 
it was $8l. 

The confectionaries and fruit stands gave the same weekly 
value for all seasons. 

The average for all stores studied showed the highest weekly 
value of vegetables to be in the summer months.

The weekly value of fruit bought was highest for practically 
all stores in July and August, The weekly value of fruit bought 
by the fruit stand was highest in September and October, when it 
was $2^7, and the lowest period was November 1st to April, when 
it was 11 ^ 6 , or a decline of 35 %. 

The value of average weekly purchases of fruit for the year 
was |71 for thirty-two independent groceries, $615 for four 
departmental stores, and $190 for two fruit stands. 

Storage or bunch vegetables comprised 43% of all vegetables 
bought by forty-one stores and summer vegetables comprised 51%. 
The proportion varied for different types of stores* 

The average percentage of storage or bunch vegetables im¬ 
ported was 8 %, and JZ% Edmonton grown. The average percentage 
of summer vegetables imported was 15%, and 2 5 % Edmonton grown. 

The study indicated that departmental stores carry a higher pro¬ 
portion of local vegetables compared with imported than do other 
retail stores. 

The two main sources of supply of vegetables for retail 
stores were growers canvassing at the store, and the wholesale 
houses. The growers supplied 48°/* and the wholesalers 49°/>. 

Edmonton growers supply in value about 50% of the vegetables 
carried by retail stores. 

The answers to questions on spread were unsatisfactory, but 
indicated that competition with chain and departmental stores 
regulated the spread. The majority of stores seemed to operate 
on a spread from 15% to 2.5%* 

The figures were insufficient to deteimine whether spread 
was greater for stores with a large or small turnover. A study

of the total turnover for each independent grocery showed no 
definite change of spread with turnover. When the turnovers 
were grouped and the spread averaged for each store in the group, 
the average spread seemed to increase as the turnover increased. 
The figures on spread are not considered reliable. 

The average decline in turnover far fifteen independent 
groceries on all commodities from 1929 to 1933 inclusive was 

30.7^.

CHAPTER XIII. 

THE EDMONTON PUBLIC MARKET 

The Edmonton Public Market is owned and controlled by the 
city of Edmonton, and is an important marketing medium for selling 
Edmonton produced farm products direct to consumers. Its import¬ 
ance in assisting in the distribution of vegetables may be re¬ 
cognized from the fact that there are more stalls selling vege¬ 
tables than any other agricultural product (10). This was also 
demonstrated in a count made on September 8th, 1934, when 104 
stalls were displaying hot-house and field vegetables out of 207 
selling farm produce. 

Location of Public Market 

The Edmonton public market is located on Rice Street, about 
two blocks from the central business section and about in the 
centre of the city. The market space has wide paved streets 
on all sides and is one block from street car service. 

Facilities 

The market space occupies three quarters of a city block. 

An enclosed building which is 300 feet by 90 feet is provided 
Por indoor selling in all weather. There is space within the 
market building to accommodate over 300 farmers 1 or gardeners' 
stalls, and an indefinite number of stalls may be conducted 
outside (10). The stalls are arranged along both walls and 
in the centre, allowing two passage ways, with goods displayed 












220. 


on the stalls on both sides. In addition to the inside accom¬ 
modation, ample space is provided for outside selling. A twenty- 
three ton scale is also provided on the grounds. This is operated 

by an offioial scale man, who makes a charge of for each 
weighing. 

The wide thoroughfares surrounding the market space provide 
convenient free parking along the curbs. The market space is 
large enough to allow sellers to keep their vehicles on the grounds. 

a t alLJifiat do) 

The stalls except those operated by retailers, are rented 
by the day. The rent charged varies quite widely due to several 
factors, the most important of which are the following:- size and 
location of stall, classification of seller, type of commodities 
sold, the day of the week and time of the year, and the demand for 
space. 

The four principal types of operators selling fruits and 
vegetables at the public market are retailers, market gardeners, 
farmers and dealers. Each of these pays a different rental. 

The highest rent is paid by the retailers who have permanent 
space near the front entrance of the market building. The 
operators classed as farmers pay a lower daily rent than those 
classed as market gardeners. Also the farmer operators pay the 
same rent throughout the year, whereas the rent charged market 
gardeners from May 1st to September is double the amount paid 
from September to May. Dealers who buy for re-sale have to pay 
a higher rent than producers. 

The rent for all operators, except the retailers, is approxi-

mately double on Saturdays what is charged on week days. This 
is apparently the result of increased demand for space on Saturdays. 
In order to obtain space in the heavy marketing periods, sellers 
often offer a higher rent than the regular charge (10). During 
the summer the rent for the best located producers 1 stalls is 
from §l.j?0 to $2.00 per day. The best stalls are usually located 
along the side walls, close to a main entrance, and are so situ¬ 
ated that goods may be conveniently and attractively displayed. 

The rent is based on a definite space and doubles if the space 
doubles. Stalls which are less favorably located than the above 
have rents from upward, the amount depending on the location. 
Stalls in the centre of the building, because of more difficulty 
in displaying produce, pay a lower rent than those along the 
sides. Stalls inside the building have higher rents than those 
outside. For outside stalls the charge, except for dealers, is 
usually 2^£ for three feet. 

A number of market gardeners and others operate the same 
stalls continuously but there is no change in rent, except for 
the seasonal change, by the operator maintaining it permanently. 
Apparently all operators, except the retailers, pay a daily rent 
whenever the stall is operated. 

In Table LVIII is shown the monthly loads brought to the 
market by various operators who were selling vegetables and pay¬ 
ing different rents. It may be seen that the loads of vegetables 
sold in outside stalls at 25* were greater for the year than 
any other group. However, the winter of 1955 was abnormally 
mild and it was possible to sell outside during all months. It 
should therefore not be concluded that outside stalls at 2j?* are

the most popular or frequently used. 

Types of Operators and Variety of Fruits and Vegetables Sold 

The four principal types of operators selling fruit and 
vegetables on the public market are classified as retailers, 
market gardeners, farmers, and dealers. 

There are six permanent retail stands whose operators sell 
fruits and vegetables continuously throughout the year. These 
stands are operated under an ordinary retail license and carry the 
regular retail lines of fruits and vegetables. The operators of 
these are practically the only sellers on the public market who 
offer fruit in any quantity. A few of the market gardeners sell 
small fruits in season but the market period is short, the quantity 
relatively small, and the annual supply unstable. 

The farmer type operators generally sell mixed farm products, 
including vegetables, which are mostly of the bunch or storage 
type, such as carrots, turnips, beets, potatoes, and cabbages. 

Some of the operators classed as farmers sell on Saturdays practi¬ 
cally all year, a few on both weekdays and Saturdays, but the 

and on Saturdays only. 

majority sell for only part of the year/ There are others of 
the farmer classification who bring vegetables to market only 
occasionally but usually do this when offerings of summer vege¬ 
tables are at the maximum the market will stand to maintain a 
satisfactory price for the majority of producers, and again in 
the fall when the market is already heavily crowded with storage 
vegetables. It is this occasional type of seller who tries to 
crowd his produce onto the market in addition to the offerings 
of the permanent operators, who is mainly responsible for gluts.

223 • 


The relatively permanent type of farmer operator who sells a few 
vegetables in addition to other farm products generally knows 
what the market will absorb and regulates his supply accordingly. 

The operators classified as market gardeners may operate 
stalls all year or only during the summer and fall. They usually 
sell only vegetables and other garden crops, and, unlike the 
farmer operators, they offer all classes of vegetables which can 
be grown in the Edmonton district. They are the principal 
sellers of vegetables requiring specialized production and summer 
vegetables such as lettuce, peas, beans, corn, radish, etc. and 
of the bunch type such as carrots, beets, turnips, etc. Market 
gardeners are also the heaviest sellers throughout the year of 
the common storage vegetables such as carrots, turnips, cabbages, 
potatoes and beets. These are sold on the market continuously 
while the local supply lasts, which is usually for about 10 to 11 
months. 

There are a few dealers selling vegetables, who buy from 
producers for resale, but this type of seller is relatively un¬ 
important , 

In September 1934 a brief survey was made of representative 
stall operators selling agricultural products. The survey in¬ 
cluded 14 operators, among whom were farmers selling no fruits 
or vegetables, farmers selling fruits, vegetables, or both, and 
market gardeners. Each operator was asked to give a record of 
each fruit or vegetable sold by him in 1933 > but, because the 
records were taken during business hours it is not considered

that they were complete or accurate 1 . The data obtained have 
been averaged and summarized in Tables LIX, hJC and LXIlf and are 
of some value in illustrating marketing in 1953 . The data, how- 
ever, should not be considered as representative of all years be¬ 
cause there was an unusually heavy crop in 1933 , prices were 
lower than normal (6), (7), and producers ended the year (spring 
1934) with a heavy surplus.^ 

The principal value of Table LIX is that it shows that rela¬ 
tively more operators sold bunch and storage vegetables than 
summer vegetables or small fruits. It also shows the average 
number of months each commodity was sold. 

The stalls selling local vegetables and small fruits are 
mostly operated by the producer, his wife, or both, or other 
member or members of his family. Table LX shows the average 
attendants per stall for the fourteen studied was 1.8. 

Daily and Seasonal Activity 

There is considerable variation in the activity of the Edmonton 
public market between days of the week, seasons of the year, and 
even between years. 

1 Very few operators keep records, therefore the data had to be 
given from memory or general knowledge of the market. Very few 
operators gave complete records, therefore it was necessary to 
estimate part of the data from such information as was given. 

2 See also Tables V and VI, pages 65 and 66, for summary of other 
information concerning the operators. 

2 See also Table VII, page 67 , for figures on surplus.

Operators can commence selling at 8 a.m. and must close at 
6 p.m. The average hours operated per day for the 14 stalls 
studied were 10.7 hours (Table EX). 

Saturday is the businest day of the week when practically 
all operators who use the market during all or particular seasons 
have their stalls open. The number who sell on Saturdays varies 
for different seasons, but in all seasons the largest number sell 
on Saturdays. Occasionally after a storm which prevented sellers 
from getting to market, or preceding a holiday there may be more 
sellers on other week days, but this is not usual. 

In order to obtain some idea of the activity of the Edmonton 
public market the number of people entering and leaving the 
market building was counted during definite intervals of time on 
Saturday, September 8th, 1954. The points of time between which 
the counts were made, the number of people entering and leaving 
the market building during the time intervals, and the number of 
people in the market building at two particular points of time, 
are given in Table EXI. Saturday, September 8th, 1954, was an 
ordinary September day, and not stormy. In the fifteen minutes 
from 10.45 a.m. to 11.00 a.m. the total people entering the 
building was 549 and the total leaving was 5691 A second count 
was made between 12.00 noon and 12.15 P»m* which showed that 428 
people entered and 472 left the building. The peak shopping 
hours are usually between 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. and about 5 P« m * (10)* 

Estimates made of the number of people (exclusive of operators) 

in the building at two points of time on Saturday, September 8th, 

1954, were 298 at 10.40 a.m. and 267 at 12.07 4909 . 

^ The figures were obtained by stationing a man at each entrance to 
the building to count the number entering and leaving. The numbers 
given are the summation of the individual counts.

These figures illustrate that the public market is a very 
important marketing institution. On the basis of these figures, 
in four peak hours, i.e. 10 a.m. to 12 noon, and from 2 p.m. to 
4 p.m., approximately 8,000 people would enter and leave the 
market on a Saturday. However, the number would vary greatly 
between different seasons and between different Saturdays, depend¬ 
ing on prevailing weather, etc. 

There is considerable variation in the number of sellers 
offering vegetables on week days and on Saturdays at different 
seasons of the year. The period when the supply offered is 
greatest is during July and August, when summer vegetables are 
on sale. The period when the supply normally is the smallest 
is from January to March (10). During the first period the 
number of sellers and the quantity and variety of garden produce 
is the greatest for any time cf the year. During the latter 
period only the specialized market gardeners and farmers with 
storage facilities have vegetables for sale. During the heavy 
marketing period of the summer and early fall many producers have 
their stalls open all week but during the winter ana spring only 
a relatively few sell every day. Figures obtained from market 
records 1 illustrate the number of operators selling at various 
seasons of the year and days of the week. During the summer 
about 20 to 40 operators have their stalls open for selling vege¬ 
tables every day. During the winter or from Christmas until 
spring about 7 producers and 6 retailers sell vegetables every 

1 The superintendent of the market referred to his records to give 
comparative figures. Also quantities in Table LVIII are from 
official market records.

day. On Tuesday, February 25 th, at 2 . 3 O p.m. eight producers 
were observed offering vegetables. At the time this count was 
made the temperature outside was considerably below zero and no 
customers were in the building. 

There are approximately 80 to market gardeners who ordinari 
ly operate permanent stalls every week. During the summer these 
operators may sell every day when the demand for summer vegetables 
is the greatest and the quantity for sale is at the maximum. As 
the season for summer vegetables passes the number of days in the 
week each operator sells decreases until harvest is completed and 
from this time until spring the majority open their stalls only 
on Saturdays. 

In addition to the market gardeners with permanent stalls 
there are others of this classification who maintain these for 
only part of the year. It is not known whether all the Edmonton 
market gardeners sell at the Edmonton public market but it is 
likely that the majority sell at least part of their produce in 
this way. 

The number of operators of all types is thus at the maximum 
during July and August, commences to decrease in September and 
October and continues to do so throughout the winter as supplies 
are depleted. When the quantity of storage vegetables held by 
each seller becomes scarce he may offer his supply only occasion¬ 
ally, the frequency depending on prices. 

The decrease in the number of sellers between two periods is 
illustrated by official records which showed 240 market gardeners 
and farmers were registered as selling vegetables on Saturday,

October l^th, 1935 , and during February 193 & only about 60 stalls 
were operating on Saturdays. This is also illustrated in Table 
LVIII which shows that the number of loads of vegetables and a few 
other farm products was the greatest during September and October, 
and lowest during February, March and April, in 1933 * The farmer 
operators usually discontinue selling about Christmas, as roads 
become blocked and it is more difficult to get supplies to the 
market. 1 

Weather is a very important factor in determining the number 

of operators selling at a particular time or between periods of 

time. Stormy weather during the summer often keeps a number 

of sellers off the market. In the winter storms may block roads 

2 

or prevent producers from opening their root houses. Because 
of changes in weather the number of sellers thus fluctuates con¬ 
stantly. This is particularly true during the winter. 

It is likely that weather preventing some sellers from getting 
to market has a stabilizing influence because weather at the same 
time often prevents buyers from getting to market. Y/hen the day 
is stormy, and particularly when it is cold in the winter, the 
housewife prefers to telephone her orders to retail stores which 
have a delivery service. 

Preparation of Produce 

There is a great difference between operators in the care 

1 The farmer type operators come to the market from a radius of 
20 miles, whereas market gardeners are mostly within a 7 mile 
radius. (10) (j?) .

taken to prepare produce for sale and in arranging it on display 
in the stalls. A partial explanation for this is the natural 
difference in native ability, but often differences in knowledge 
of the market or in alertness to self interest are the reasons. 

It usually requires most of the day previous to that on which 
fruits or vegetables are to be sold to prepare them for market 
(7)« This is taken up in the summer by gathering green vegetables 
and washing and tying bunch vegetables. In the winter the day 
previous is spent in grading and washing the vegetables to be sold. 
Practically all operators are forced by custom, competition and 
demand, to wash vegetables. This is often a laborious and diffi¬ 
cult undertaking for sellers who have no running water at their 
farms* For sanitary reasons no washing is allowed at the public 
ma rket. 

Vegetables sold at the market are graded by the producers but, 
except for potatoes, do not have to conform to any grade standards 
unless the grade is specified. There is thus considerable vari¬ 
ation in the quality of products offered by different sellers. 

Part of the variation is due to differences in the quality of the 
crop harvested, but in the main it is explainable by differences 
in grading. Other reasons for variations in grades are the 
amount of supply, and the importance the seller finds that quality 
is to price. Because of these and other reasons one may see 
froducts from very high to very low quality offered on the same 
day by different sellers. Usually each grower offers several 
grades of the same product. In the main it may be stated that 
keen competition forces the majority of sellers to offer carefully 
graded, high quality produce. Those who neglect these essentials

are usually intermittent sellers. 

Prices 

It is not the intention here to discuss vegetable prices, 
as this has been done in chapter Vl\ but merely to indicate 
some of the factors affecting prices which are peculiar to the 
public market. 

It may be safely stated that supply is the principal deter¬ 
miner at any one time and between different periods of time. By 
supply, in this case, is meant the total supply of vegetables on 
sale in Edmonton, and not that offered at the public market in 
particular. Actually the supply offered within the public market 
acts on prices, and these are influenced by supply offered by 
other types of distributors. 

In the September 1934 survey, 14 operators were asked, to 
state the average prices they received for the time each commodity 
was sold. An average of these is shown in Table LIX. The main 
value of the stuay was that it indicated considerable difference 
in the average price received between different operators. There 
are several reasons for this among which would be the following:- 
1 ) error in estimating the average; 2) differences in quality; 

3 ) time over which the vegetable was sold, and the amount sold at 
particular prices; and 4) the ability of the salesman. 

There is no set price for fruits or vegetables sold at the 
public market by producers, but there is usually a general pre¬ 
vailing price about which prices asked or received for individual

sales, may fluctuate. A seller may start out in the day to ask 
a certain price but if the produce is not, being cleared at the 
rate considered necessary to sell all that has been prepared for 
sale, the operator may continue to lower the price throughout the 
day. It is often necessary to offer bargain prices in order to 
clear a surplus or picked over stock. When there are many sellers 
under one roof the customer has an opportunity to bargain for 
price, thus they may go to several sellers comparing prices. 

Many commodities, such as cabbage, turnips, cauliflowers, etc. 
sell at variable individual prices depending on the size and 
quality, which makes for price differences between sellers. 

A very important factor causing differences in prices received 
is variability between sellers in salesmanship. This does not 
mean in ability to bargain with the customer, although this may 
also be a factor, but in such things as friendliness, reliability, 
service, knowledge of the customer’s particular likes or dislikes, 
knowledge of the best qualities to produce and grades to prepare, 
and many other factors which go to make for successful salesman¬ 
ship. Operators who combine these essential factors in their 
business are able to get better average prices than the inferior 
salesman. Many of the better operators have regular customers 
who go to them on certain days of the week, and because they know 
the seller will charge reasonable prices they do not hunt bargains. 
The operator who acquires a reliable reputation and. attracts 
regular customers is able to shelter himself to some extent xrom 
price cutting and market gluts. He is better able to regulate 
his supply as to quantity, quality, and variety, to the needs 
of his regular customers.

In general, it may be stated from conversations with pro¬ 
ducers ( 3 ), ( 7 ), (8), ( 9 ), and market men ( 6 ), ( 11 ), that prices 
of vegetables sold at the public market are very unstable, but 
generally lower than retail prices for similar goods. This is 
true even considering that commodities may be bought fresher at 
the public market. The instability in prices is mostly related 
to supply, particularly in the short run, as this fluctuates 
more than demand. Competition among sellers is very keen, and 
has been abnormally so for the last four years, to a large extent 
intensified by producers forced into gardening by the depression. 

The producers in the main complain constantly of unsatisfactory 
prices and have made several attempts at organization with price 
regulation and coding as the objectives. 

Licensing and Regulations 

The regulations governing operators on the public market 
were not investigated in detail, but a few which were mentioned 
in interviews are important. 

The only sellers who have to be licensed are the retailers 
and dealers. Primary producers may sell their own products without 
a licence, but they cannot buy for resale. They are given some 
latitude in this by being allowed to buy from other producers if 
their own supply is insufficient to fill orders. 

All commodities offered are constantly inspected by city 
public health officials who keep a close surveillance over the 
public market to insure that sanitation is properly observed. 

Operators must use regulation scales and these are officially 
inspected from time to 'time.

Averages are based on the numbers of operators 
supplying the information. It is considered 
that the number of operators selling each vege¬ 
table is not exact because of difficulty in 
taking the record during business hours, which 
may have caused operators to leave out certain 
items. The estimates of average gross receipts 
include some operators who did not give total 
receipts but only average weekly sales and months 
sold.

CHAPTER XIV. 


There is still at least one type of distributor that has 
not been considered. The one in particular of sufficient import 
ance to be recognized as a distributor is the huckster or peddler 
who goes about the streets, usually from house to house, offering 
his wares for sale. The city licence department issues from 
twenty to twenty-five licences a year to hucksters selling fruits 
and vegetables in Edmonton.^ The number would indicate that 
hucksters are performing a definite marketing service,but-the 
relative importance of this is very difficult to estimate. Com¬ 
pared with the number of retailers or the number of sellers at 
the Edmonton public market it would seem to be minor. 

In order to gain some knowledge of huckstering, fourteen 
hucksters selling fruit and vegetables, or either, on Edmonton 
streets, were included in the September 1934 marketing survey. 
Considerable handicap was encountered in obtaining information 
because of the difficulty of finding peddlers, but more particu¬ 
larly due to language differences, as most of the peddlers were 
Orientals or foreign, whites. It was also not easy to convince 
them that the questionsire was disinterested and not an investi¬ 
gation designed to interfere.with their business. Because of 
these difficulties the data obtained was sparse and could not be

considered entirely reliable. The discussions to follow will 
be based mainly on data from the survey which have been averaged 
and summarized in the tables at the end of this chapter. 

T_yne of Operator 

The fourteen hucksters questioned were doing.an independent 
business and the majority were selling their own produce. Seven 
out of fourteen were Orientals and seven were whites, at least 
three of whom spoke only broken English. 

Twelve out of fourteen used a horse drawn rig and two used 
a truck. 

The number of years they had been in business ranged from 

1 to 20 years, and the average was 3.3 years. It was learned 

in the survey that temporary peddlers, such as farmers, frequently 
sell occasional loads of vegetables and other faim produce by 
house to house canvass; peddlers of this type are particularly 
common during the summer and fall. 

Territory Served 

The operators were canvassing over a route requiring from 

2 to 20 miles travelling in a day. The average length of the 
route was 8 miles. Nine peddlers stated they sold in definite 
areas and five indicated they canvassed anywhere in the city. 

The operators were not asked if they made regular calls, so this 
cannot be stated. 

Seasons Operated 

The survey indicated that there is a difference in the 
number selling at different times of the year. Table UCIII

shows that twelve operated in the spring and summer, fourteen in 
the fall, and ten in the winter. Ten out of fourteen peddled 
at all seasons of the year. It is unlikely, however, that the 
ten could operate all winter as perishable commodities are easily 
injured by frost and the open rigs used by the majority would 
provide little protection. It is probable that certain winter 
days would be suitable for outdoor selling and the ten who indi¬ 
cated this likely had such days in mind. 

The fall was the busiest time of the year. Table LXIV shows 
that the average number of times a week eleven peddlers were 
selling was 2.6 days during the spring, 2.6 during the summer, 

4.2 during the fall, and 1.2 during the winter months. One of 
the operators questioned stated that he peadled in the city only 
three or four times in a season. This operator was not included 
in the average as it was considered he was not typical of licensed 
peddlers. 

Commodities Offered, and Amount of Business^__li^ . 

The average number of commodities sold per operator was nine. 
Practically all the peddlers were selling the common local summer 
and winter vegetables. As none of the operators reported pur¬ 
chases of vegetables from wholesalers, it may be assumed that 
only local vegetables were sold. Only three were selling fruit, 
and one of these sold only local small fruits. 

The hucksters were asked in the survey to give an itemized 
account of the annual gross receipts from the sale of each 
commodity. It was very difficult for them to do this as they 
had no records to which to refer and in any case were reluctant

about giving information. For these reasons it is not considered 
that the itemized account of each operator’s sales was complete 
or estimates entirely accurate. In addition to the itemized 
gross receipts they were asked to give their total annual gross 
turnover. The average gross receipts per operator from itemized 
sales, as shown in Table W was $480, and the average of the 
estimated total turnover was $695. It is likely the latter 
estimate was the more correct. 

The hucksters were asked to estimate the number of daily 
customers. Some of them did this and others estimated the 
number of daily calls. By using these two figures and the number 
of times on the market per week during the four seasons the average 
value of sales per call was estimated to be 17 cents and the 
value per customer was estimated to be 32 cents. The average 
value for all calls - that is, sales and non-sales calls - was 
estimated to be 46 cents. These estimates are shown in Table 
IXV but they are considered to be very rough. They may, however, 
throw some light on the importance of huckstering. 

The hucksters were asked to estimate the average weight and 
value of their loads of truck which were peddled. The average 
of the estimates as shown in Table LXVI was 355 pounds per load, 
and the average value of the load was |9,00. The range in the 
estimates of the average weight per load was from 200 to 1,000 
pounds. The estimated value of the loads was from $1.50 to 
155.00. 

The average number of loads peddled per day for the number 
of days of peddling in each season was estimated to be one for

each huckster. During the seasons of heavy production and market¬ 
ing the peddler indicated that more than one load per day was sold. 

Credit 

The operators were asked to state whether they were giving 
their customers any credit and what sales on oredit were uncollected. 
Nine out of fourteen stated they had no money outstanding. One 

had $4.00, one had $100, and a third had $300 uncollected. One 

stated that $ 2.00 from each day*s sales remained uncollected, but 
presumably this was collected on succeeding calls. One operator 
estimated that 3 % of the revenue due from sales went uncollected. 

Source of Sunniv 

The source of supply for the hucksters questioned is given 
in Table LXVII. This shows that, on the average, 8 ?% of what 
was peddled was produced by the hucksters. Twelve out of fourteen 
reported that from 60 % to 100 % of what they sold was grown by 
themselves. 

Two hucksters reported that 40% to 30 % of their supply was 
purchased from Edmonton producers and two reported that from 1 % 
to 30 % was secured from wholesalers. 

The average amount from the three sources of supply for all 
peddlers was 83 % produced by themselves, 7% from Edmonton producers, 
and 4% from wholesalers.^ The produce purchased from the whole- 

1 The estimated percentage sold to hucksters by eight Edmonton 
wholesalers is given in Table XXIV, page I 63 . In a questionnaire 
previous to the one on which the estimates in Table XXIV were ob¬ 
tained, five wholesalers stated they sold no supplies to hucksters.

salers was mostly fruit. Only one huckster stated that all of 
his supply was purchased from local producers or wholesalers. 

IJAfiagJl q pL a M -^^Eu i at ious 1 

The hucksters are all supposed to carry a city licence, but 
in the survey it was found that some of the temporary operators 
did not have a licence. The licence costs are $10 for a rig 
drawn by one horse, $20 for a rig drawn by two horses and $30 
for a car or truck conveyance. 1 The licence would appear to 
be quite high for the peddler who sells only a few loads a year, 
anu it is likely that this would explain why a number sell without 
a licence. 

Licensed hucksters are permitted to sell on any city street 
not classified as a business street. There is apparently no 
regulation governing their hours of business. 

It is necessary, before a peddler may secure a licence, to 
have his vehicle pass inspection by an official inspector of the 
City Public Health Department. Also all food offered for sale 
must conform to public health regulations and it is subject to 
inspection at any time.

GENERAL SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 


The following is a very brief summary of the subjects covered 
by this thesis, and a few of the more important conclusions. 

Towards the end of the chapter a few minor recommendations will 
be disoussed. 

This study has been divided into two parts; the first section 
considered the Edmonton marketing shed as a producing and consuming 
area, and the second section the important marketing agencies. 

-It was estimated that the population of the shed was approxi¬ 
mately 400,000, of which about 6^fo were classed as rural and 357° 
as urban. The urban population is the largest purchaser of 
vegetables, as it is less self sufficient than the rural. The 
division of population between urban and rural has been practically 
constant since 1911- 

In the discussion on demand, it was concluded that the demand 
was inelastic for certain fruits or vegetables regarded as necessi¬ 
ties, v/hereas for those regarded as luxuries, or of easy substi¬ 
tution, the demand was likely to be elastic. The common storage 
vegetables normally included in the diet are likely to have in¬ 
elastic demands, which means that there has to be considerable 
change in price, particularly downward, to alter the amount pur¬ 
chased. This is important in that it means that a local crop 
of such vegetables as potatoes, carrots, cabbage, turnips, etc., 
greater than what is normally consumed, can only be completely 
marketed by greatly reducing prices. Marketing of fruits and

vegetables with an elastic demand is particularly uncertain, 
because of substitites, weather, change in fancy, etc. These 
factors increase the risk and indirectly the cost of handling 
perishable commodities. 

A study of production indicated that Edmonton normally pro¬ 
duces sufficient storage vegetables to supply the local demand. 
Indications were that the production of both summer and storage 
vegetables has been abnormally heavy in the last four or five 
years. This has been mainly because of the entrance of temporary 
producers, such as farmers, and unemployed men who have acquired 
a small piece of land. The inorease in production above the 
normal has caused a flooded market during July and August, and 
again at harvest time because of inadequate storage. The result 
of heavy production has been generally low prices, unsatisfactory 
to the majority of producers. 

New vegetables from local, domestic and foreign sources, supply 
the Edmonton market at different seasons. The foreign are im¬ 
ported from about Christmas until May, when they are displaced by 
supplies from British Columbia, and the latter are displaced by 
local vegetables early in July. 

The only fruits produced in the Edmonton district are a minor 
quantity of small fruits. Practically all fruit comes from 
British Columbia or the United States. The indications were 
that tariffs, since 1930, have decreased the amount of fruit and 
vegetables imported from the United States. 

The price of new vegetables decreases as the supply changes 
from foreign to domestic to local. The quantity produced, parti¬ 
cularly the local quantity,seemed to be the most important factor

in determining the price of vegetables. 

In the chapter on standardization, evidence was given that 
domestio and foreign fruits and vegetables are bought on grade, 
and supplies from British Columbia are now inspected by government 
inspectors before shipment. 

The second section of the study considered the important 
marketing agencies in the order in which each carries out its 
function of assembling and distributing. These included trans¬ 
portation, brokerage, wholesale and retail marketing agencies, and, 
in addition, the marketing of fruits and vegetables by stall opera¬ 
tors at the Edmonton public market and by street peddlers or huck¬ 
sters was discussed, 

Edmonton wholesalers expressed the opinion that there has been 
considerable change in the last few years in the transportation 
rates on fruits and vegetables, which has been caused mainly by 
competition between freight, express, and truck transports. 

Freight rates have been adjusted to meet truck competition, and 
the express companies now provide a ”freight express” rate to 
meet both competitors. Trucks have reduced the delivery time 
to small towns and provide a continuous service for most of the 
year. This has decreased the risk to the small country store¬ 
keeper, and has provided fresher supplies to country consumers. 
However, there is considerable dissatisfaction among wholesalers 
against trucking, because of frequent cargo injury and the in¬ 
convenience of loading many small orders onto trucks. 

Edmonton wholesalers receive practically their entire supply 
from domestic and foreign sources, mostly British Columbia and

the Unitea States. Five wholesalers purchased less than of 
their total supply of vegetables from local producers. All the 
large wholesale houses buy through brokers. 

About 54 c /o business done by Edmonton wholesale firms was 

with country stores, and 46% with city stores. The average number 
of stores supplied per wholesaler was 406 in the country and 113 
in the city. 

Practically all the fruit and about 30f o of the vegetables 
sold by the retail stores surveyed was obtainea from wholesalers, 
and 30 °/ o of the vegetables was bought from local producers delivering 
to the store. 

Sale by producers on the Edmonton public market is an important 
method of marketing local vegetables. Peddling of fruits and 
vegetables is practised to some extent, but would seem to be of 
minor importance. 

It would seem that there are no other important methods of 
selling fruits or vegetables. There is no fruit auction in 
Edmonton, and no evidence was heard of road-side marketing, although 
farmers living beside highways advertise fresh vegetables for sale. 
Indications were that very little is sold at the farms, although 
producers frequently receive orders at their fanrsto deliver 
vegetables to retailers or direct to consumers. The producers 
prefer, when possible without too much loss of time, to sell direct 
to consumers. 

The weight of eviaence heard indicated that competition was 
very keen among all types of distributors. The managers of the 
larger wholesale houses meet at least once a week to discuss the 
prices they will ask between meeting periods, but it was stated

that the agreements were seldom kept. This would seem to be an 

acceptable conclusion, when one considers the large number of 

wholesale houses, and the necessity of keeping prices where supplies 

will move. Although a number of the wholesale films appear to 

other of 

be independent, they are actually branches of one or/two firms. 

It is likely that where there are agreements, even if not entirely 
kept, these tend to stabilize prices and possibly keep them higher 
than if competition were entirely free. 

There would seem to be considerable economic waste, because 
of the duplication in the perfoimance of the wholesale function. 

The consumers or producers, in the long run, have to pay for in¬ 
efficiency arising out of duplication. 

Insufficient evidence was obtained to determine the most 
economical type of retail store for distributing fruits and 
vegetables; however, the evidence seemed to indicate that chain 
and departmental stores establish the maximum prices asked by 
all stores. 

Verbal evidence indicated that vegetable prices have been 
quite unsatisfactory, during the last four years, for the majority 
of specialized market-gardeners. This has been caused mainly 

by the entrance of new producers, such asfermers ana unemployed. 

It was claimed that the latter producers have received assistance 
by way of relief, cheap land, and often free seed. These pro¬ 
ducers were said to have offerea at prices lower than the specialized 
producers could afford, in order to attract customers. 

It is difficult to suggest a means to al^viate this situation. 

It is likely that natural economic forces will eliminate the 
temporary producers as the depression disappears. In the mean

time, however, it would seem that those who grant the relief and 
other assistance to these producers should purchase their supply 
rather than allow it to injure other producers. It is probable 
that relief departments could distribute this supply to other 
necessitous cases. 

There is periodically a movement to establish codes regulating 
the local production and marketing of fruits and vegetables. 
Presumably the object would be to raise average prices received 
by producers. It is unlikely that coding would be beneficial, 
because there would be no means of getting ail producers to observe 
the codes; the vagaries of weather make it impossible to regulate 
the amount produced; perishable products can only be held off the 
market for a very short time; and the majority of producers usually 
prefer to sell all their crop at a low price rather than part of 
it at a higher price. Other factors are the uncertainty of demand 
and the difficulty in determining a long run price sufficient to 
enable enough producers to remain in the business. 

The periods of the year when the supplies offered are parti¬ 
cularly large ana prices low are during July and August, and again 
at harvest time. It is the supply offered in excess of that 
which brings a satisfactory price, whatever this may be, that 
forces down the price for the main part of the crop. This con¬ 
dition might be relieved if there were some means of removing the 
surplus to markets outside the area supplying Edmonton. There 
is often a shortage of fresh and storage vegetables in many 
districts naturally unsuitable to production, or where there has 
been a crop failure. The difficulty is to find someone willing 
to find outside markets and accept the risk of assembling and

selling shipments. It would seem that a producers* organization 
might be able to assist its members by undertaking this duty. It 
might be necessary to sell at prices which merely covered costs, 
but by removing part of the local supply the revenue received for 
the total crop might be increased. 

It would seem that producers of all farm commodities could 
be assisted by some disinterested person, presumably a government 
employee, who would act as a marketing expert, to obtain production 
estimates, quantity to be marketed, prices to be expected, etc. 

A person performing this function could go to producers selling 
vegetables at the Edmonton public market and obtain estimates of 
the amount planted, the probable size of the crop to be harvested, 
and, as the crop was being marketed, the amount unsold at different 
periods. The information could be assembled and the conclusions 
published periodically, which would form fairly reliable informa¬ 
tion on which sellers and buyers could base their policies. 

It is unlikely that the public gain would be sufficient to 
warrant the cost of this service for vegetable marketing only, but 
this might be done in conjunction with other duties. In the 
absence of a public official performing this service, an official 
of a producers ! organization might be able to assist the members 
by compiling the data suggested. 

The suggestion is often made that Edmonton could support a 
canning factory. This is doubtful, as previous attempts by 
private companies have failed, mainly because of the uncertainty 
of the local supply of canning vegetables, and the shortness of 
the canning season.

system, and to develop public confidence.

APPENDIX 


APPENDIX 1. 

Method of Estimating the Population of 
the Edmonton Marketing Shed 

To obtain the total population for the Edmonton marketing 
shed the populations of each census district falling within the 
area were added. 

This did not give the rural and urban populations, therefore 
a different method had to be used. The Edmonton marketing 
district extends approximately to Bed Deer. A line drawn across 
the map of Alberta through this point divides the settled farming 
area of the province approximately in half. It was assumed 
for the estimate that approximately half of the population of 
the province living in towns or villages or in the country was 
north of Bed Deer. When this was done it was found that the 
total for country, town and village population was less by 48,099 
than the census total for the same area. 

It is possible that this may be explained by inaccuracy in 
estimating the total population from the census districts. This, 

however, is less likely to be in error than the totals for towns, 

halving 

villages and rural population obtained by/the total for the 
province. 

It may be seen from Table IV that the total for the Edmonton 
marketing area is more than half of the total population of the 
province. If this is true then it is likely that more than

half of the rural, town and village population of the province 
should he included in the Edmonton marketing area. It is likely 
that by taking a higher figure than half for the province, or 
using the percentage that the Edmonton marketing district is of 
the total for the province, there would not be a deficiency of 
48,099.

APPENDIX 2. 

2a. Demand for Fruits and Vegetables 


In a discussion on consumption Waite, in 1929, stated: 

,r Some knowledge of the demand for agricultural products 
as a whole would be useful. We could then analyse the effects 
of large and of small total production of agricultural products 
on the incomes of agriculture and of industry. Curves of 
domestic and of foreign demand are also needed for many purposes. 
The much discussed problem of the agricultural surplus turns 
principally on the demand curves for the various products.”

for Research. 1 * Jour, of Farm Econ. 1929* 


2b. 


Working made the following statement in 1932: 

"Two types of studies have been carried on in the Bureau 
of Agricultural Economics which provide indications of changes in 
demand for agricultural products. One of these types consists 
of our price analysis. Since more studies have been made of 
factors"affecting price than of factors affecting consumption, the 
bulk of the evidence which we have of changes in demand is to be 
gained from the price analysis studies. All of these studies 
give interesting and valuable evidence concerning changes in demand 
for the products with which they deal. Unfortunately few of them 
have been published.’*

"A powerful factor tending to depress the prices of farm

O f Brien, after a discussion of the nature of demand for 
agricultural products, states: 

"The conclusions arrived at are, (1) that the demand for 
agricultural products is inelastic, ( 2 ) that such inelasticity 
operating upon a variable supply causes wide fluctuations in 
price, and ( 3 ) that the extent of these fluctuations varies 
inversely with the width of the market."

pages 21 - 29 . 




Waite, in a paper delivered in 1929, stated: 

"The study of the consumption of agricultural products has 
generally not proceeded beyond the simple computation of per 
capita consumption in the United States. We cannot get very 
far towards a comprehensive grasp of the problem without refining 
and classifying data a great deal more than this. The classifi¬ 
cations which promise to be the most useful are those with respect 
to the consumption in particular places or areas with respect to 
different uses of the product, with respect to qualities of the 
product, and with respect to certain characteristics of the con¬ 
sumers."

for Research in Agricultural Economics." Jour, of Farm Econ. (11)

In a discussion.on the-above paper Kneeland emphasized that: 




"The income of the family, sources of income, the amount 
and character of savings, and the history of the family" 

should be included in consumption or demand studies, as these in¬ 
fluence the expenditure pattern.

i§.* Black Soil 

"A typical profile of the black soil belt of central Alberta 
is characterized for the most part by a dark colored surface 
horizon. This horizon has an average thickness of eight to twelve 
inches. It is a heav}^ black loam, rich in organic matter, with 
no pronounced structure, and contains 0 . 33 f o of nitrogen, and is 
about neutral in reaction."

St. Anne Sheet." Bui. No. 20, University of Alberta. 


3b-.. Cost of Production and Potato Production in U.S.A. 

"The facts are that when the total potato crop in the United 
States was 33$ million bushels or larger, the entire money received 
by the producer was less than the cost of seed, planting, cultiva¬ 
tion and harvesting with nothing left for rent, water, labor or 
cost of living. 

"In five of the last ten years, the crop was greater than 338 
million bushels and the producer received less than the out of 
pocket costs. In three of the remaining five years, the crop was 
small enough to warrant fair prices but adverse economic conditions 
prevented a living price to the producer. In the other two years, 
or two out of ten, the price of potatoes was high enough to make 
a profit for most producers but not enough to produce a favorable 
average over the entire period." 

ZUCKERMAN, H.G. , Berkley College. Paper read to the Potato 
Association of America, Dec. 28 , 1334. American Potato Journal, 
July 1333* 

The same writer considers the situation in the Aroostook 
County of Maine, which is the best potato growing area of the 
United States because of the soil, climate, and proximity to

•'large concentrated consumption markets’ 1 . He states: 

"Seven out of the last ten years show the Maine potato pro¬ 
ducer with a loss of out-of-pocket money. Three of the ten have 
been profitable." 

The author of this quotation does not state how this infor¬ 
mation was obtained, but presuming the statements are reliable, it 
shows that ten years were insufficient time to cause farmers to 
discontinue production of potatoes at a loss. From a production 
standpoint one may conclude that profit to the producer may not be 
the limiting factor in determining quantity of any crop produced.

APPENDIX 5• Prices of Perishable and Other Agricultural Products 

5a. Method of Adjustment of Wholesale Prices 

In plotting the price curves it was necessary to put all 
prices on a comparable basis. This involved changing the price 
from per pound to per cwt. or per bushel, or to per crate for 
lettuce. In some cases it was not possible to give a retail price 
for cabbage when this was quoted as so much per head and the whole¬ 
sale was by the cwt. This occurred only in a few instances. The 
same difficulty occurred when celery retail price was quoted by the 
bunch, which is not a standard weight. 


5b. Lettuce Prices 

The retail and wholesale prices are not considered very 
reliable as the two prices were quoted in the records in different 
units. The wholesale price was given by the crate and the retail 
by the head. The latter was therefore multiplied by 60 in each 
case to get a price for a five dozen crate. The wholesale price 
for a crate was for four, five, or six dozen heads, but the number 
was not always stated. The prices for crates of four and six 
dozen heads, when the size was specified, were adjusted to the 
basis of five dozen. The number of heads was not always stated, 
and it was therefore necessary to assume in these cases that it was 
a five-dozen crate, as these were "the most common size shipped" 
( 6 ). 

It will be noted that local lettuce appeared to go off the 
market in some cases in August. This was not true, as the market 
was usually flooded with local lettuce at that time (6). When

the price became too low and the demand uncertain wholesalers did 
not handle it. When demand became more active they commenced 
buying again. Usually the supply of local head lettuce from 
July until freeze-up is very plentiful and the price very low ( 6 ).

The following questions were asked a fruit and vegetable 
broker and buyers for two Edmonton wholesale houses. 

1. Is there very much variation in the prices paid from year 
to year for domestic and foreign fruits and vegetables? 

2. What are the chief reasons for changes in price? 

3 . Is the supply stable from year to year? 

4. Is there much price cutting between competitive producing

From an investigation of the factors affecting the price of 
grapes, Mallory, Smith and Shear concluded: 

"For table grapes the important price determinant is the 
supply." 

These men obtained elasticities of demand for grapes of three 
classes, as follows: table grapes -0.8 and -0.7; black juice grapes, 
between -0.8 to -0.9; and between -2.0 and -1.4 for white juice 
grapes.

Shear and Howe, from a study of California raisin sales and 
prices concluded supply was the most important determining factor 
of prices between 1921-29. The elasticity of domestic demand 
for raisins was estimated to be -0.3 to -0.4.

In a discussion of the nature of the demand for agricultural 
products Thompson, after concluding that the demand is generally 
inelastic, stated: 

“Price fluctuation is likely to be relatively wide in the 
case of a commodity with an inelastic demand and relatively narrow 

in the case of a commodity with an elastic demand.Relatively 

small surpluses and deficits in farm products - not to speak of 
large surpluses and deficits - have a relatively large effect on 
the price.’ 1 

THOMPSON, John G., "The Nature of the Demand for Agricultural 

Products.” Jour, of Pol. Econ. 1^24. 


The following statement by Ezekiel on price forecasting for 
agricultural products seems to be particularly applicable where 
the supply of commodities such as fruits and vegetables is fixed 
in any particular year: 

“For a commodity with a definite sales period within which the 
supply is fixed, the price for that period may be estimated as soon 
as the supply is known, from the observed relation of supply to 
price in earlier periods. Annual crops such as cotton fulfill 
this condition. The change in the value of money and trends in 
demand may need to be included in the analysis. Once the fore¬ 
casted average price for the season has been determined, the seasonal 
price movements may be forecasted on the basis of average seasonal 
movements in previous years of similar characteristics. Thus the 
seasonal movement of potato prices differs in years of small, medium 
and large crops.” 

EZEKIEL, M. Rep. 26, Agric. Econ. Bibliog. No. 48. 


The above extracts indicate that supply was the principal 
determinant of price. A further study of economic research data 
also shows that supply of agricultural commodities is directly 
influenced by price. The following extracts from the work of 
Bean and others in the United States are quoted to exemplify this. 
Bean studied the harvested acreage relationships to price of potatoes

in three states and for the United States, of sweet potatoes, 
cabbage, strawberries, watermelons, flax, rye and cotton, for the 
period 1921-28. The results are illustrated in a curve which 
Bean says "represents the net relation of that price to the acreage 
changes for the period 1921-28." The results were also summarized 
mathematically. The following extract illustrates the conclusion:- 

"This high degree of relationship between prices received 
and subsequent acreage changes ... is expressed mathematically in 
Table I in the form of indexes of correlation." 

It will be noted that out of a gross correlation index of 
1.00, the range of the indexes for 12 cases is from O .967 to O .997 
and even when these are corrected for the sma}.l number of obser¬ 
vations and the relatively large number of constants involved, the 
range of indexes of correlation for all but potatoes and sweet 
potatoes is from 0.901 to 0 . 977 •

Bean makes the following summary of "facts revealed in these

1. "There appears to be a general type of production response

2. "In each case the price received for the production of the 

preceding season is the dominant factor in the change in production 
in any given year. In most cases the price received during the 
season two years preceding is also an important factor, particularly 
if the price has been low. 

5. "Although there is a general similarity in the nature of the 
response of production to the price one year preceding, the extent 
of that response for different prices differs by regions and by 
commodities, some showing a greater response to high prices; others 
to low. 

4. "The response to price two preceding years does not follow 

a general type, but differs markedly for several of the commodities. 

5. "For each commodity the analysis reveals that there is under 
ordinary conditions a definite national average price which tends 
to maintain acreage unchanged from that of the preceding year. 

For any one commodity there are different regional prices which 
tend to maintain acreage unchanged in the different areas. Where 
competing crops are involved, these equilibrium prices tend to 
vary with the prices of the competing crops. 

£. "Prices only moderately above or below this equilibrium price 
(4* or - 10%) tend to be followed by about the same percentage 
increase or decrease in acreage, but very high prices bring forth 
no materially greater increase in acreage than do moderately high 
prices. 

7. "In some cases the effect of high prices on subsequent pro¬ 
duction lasts only one season, in others at least two seasons. 

The effect of low prices in most cases extends over at least two 
seasons."

Econ. (11) 1929.

Transportation 


Freight Rates for Annies 
Several years ago apples were shipped in bulk from British 
Columbia to the prairies, at $4 cents a cwt. to Edmonton. This 
was a special rate allowed by the Board of Railway Commissioners 
on apples shipped to factories for canning purposes. However, 
wholesalers made use of the rate until it was stopped by the Board

of Railway Commissioners. The two main reasons for this were 
that 1) the rate was not meant for shipments to wholesalers, and 
2) the British Columbia shippers considered they did not have 

V 

sufficient control of the grade that was being taken from the car 
and boxed for sale to retailers (6), (12). 


6 b• Transportation of Fruits and Vegetables by Water 

A number of Edmonton market men (1) were questioned on the 
use of ocean transport for fruits and vegetables from the U.S.A. 

So far as was known by a wholesaler and a broker no shipments of 
fruit or vegetables from the United States are made by water. 

The chief reason is because of freight rates. It will be recalled 
that 9 of the 12 states from which fruit or vegetables were im¬ 
port ea were on the U.S. coast. This would mean that commodities 
could move by water or by rail. However, rail transportation is 
likely more convenient because commodities can be packed in American 
cars at the point of shipment and billed direct to their destination. 
It takes eight days for a car to reach Edmonton from California. 

Ship transportation would be slower and less convenient, 
commodities have to be moved to the sea port by truck or railway, 
loaded onto vessels, and upon reaching the Canadian port of entry 
either stored or loaded onto Canadian railway cars and moved to 
their destination. This causes a delay in time but, more important, 
necessitates several handlings. The quality of tender iruits or 
vegetables is likely to depreciate considerably with increased 

time in transit and numerous handlings. 

It was the opinion of the men interviewed that certain products

could be satisfactorily moved by boat from American states if it 
were not for prohibitive rail freight rates. The rail rate from 
California to Edmonton is $1.94 a owt. for fruits and $ 1.85 a cwt. 
for vegetables. The freight cost on foreign vegetables and fruit 
from Vancouver to Edmonton is $1.66 a cwt. (1) If the boat trans¬ 
portation cost were added to the rate from Vancouver to Edmonton 
the two costs would be greater than the rail cost direct from 
California to Edmonton. 

The freight rate on domestic fruit, which travels on a fifth 
class commodity rate, from Vancouver to Edmonton, varies with the 
fruit. The rate on vegetables which move on 8 th class commodity 
rates is 59# per cwt. from Vancouver to Edmonton. This means 
that the freight cost of moving vegetables of foreign origin from 
Vancouver to Edmonton is $1.07 per cwt. more than the cost for the 
same weight over the same distance for carrying domestic vegetables. 
Erom these figures it is seen that the extra cost of shipping 
vegetables direct from California to Edmonton is only 29# per cwt. 
greater than from Vancouver to Edmonton. Unless the total cost 
of moving vegetables from California to Vancouver by boat were iess 
than 29 £, and the depreciation were no greater, it would seem un¬ 
likely that this means of transport could be used. 

The interest in this phase of marketing was an attempt to find 
out relative costs of fruits and vegetables from various sources 
of supply. 

Freight costs from other U.S.A. points than California were 
not obtained. 

Commodities obtained from other countries than the U.S.A.,

such as the West Indies, South America, Spain and Australia, are 
transported by water and arrive in good condition. 


APPENDIX 7 • The Brokers 

The following statements are repeated after Cassels, 1929. 

’•There are two brokerage companies operating on the prairies. 
Each of these has five offices (1929), one in each of the large 
distributing centres, Winnipeg, Saskatoon, Regina, Calgary and 
Edmonton. It is through them that the jobbers are brought in 
touch with the selling agencies and the shippers. The brokers 
are the agents of the shipper, soliciting orders from the whole¬ 
salers and telegraphing them in through the selling agencies." 

'• It is their business (the brokers) to direct the purchases 
of the wholesalers to those particular points, whether in Canada 
or elsewhere, from which the supplies may be obtained most economic 

ally.” 


••This is true of both brokers in spite of the fact that one 
of them, the Canadian Fruit Distributors, is an organization owned 
entirely by the Associated Growers of British Columbia.’ 1 

Cassels further stated that there were two main selling organi 
sations in British Columbia, namely the Associated Growers who 
sold through its own brokers, the Canadian Fruit Distributors, and 
the second selling agency known as the Sales Service, which sold 
through the independent brokers known as the C.H. Robinson Co. Ltd. 
These two groups 

"the co-operative growers with their own packing-houses 
selling through their own agencies, the Associated Growers, and 
the Canadian Fruit Distributors, are continually in direct and 
bitter competition with the rival faction of non-co-operators 
who ship through the commercial packers, the Sales Service, and 
the C.H. Robinson Co. Ltd." 1

APPENDIX 8. Edmonton Fruit and Vegetable Wholesale Market 


8a. Business Organization of Wholesalers 

In ±929 Cassels 1 stated: 

“Two of the largest wholesale organizations are the Nash 
Symington Company and the Consolidated Fruit Co., Ltd., both 
of which have numerous branches scattered over the prairies. 

Out of a total of one hundred wholesale houses located in the 
prairie provinces, exactly fifty belong to one or other of these 
two firms.As the Nash is a Canadian organization and the Consoli¬ 
dated an American, the competition between the two is particularly 
keen.” 


"An important feature in the organization of these large 
concerns is their practice of putting duplicate houses in all the 
important distributing centres.... Where we would expect to find 
one of their branches, we find two or three, all operating under 
different names and competing with each other to all intents and 
purposes. For example, in Edmonton, the Nash Symington Co. has 
two branches." 


8b. "Seasonal fluctuations are, of course, particularly 

characteristic of the wholesale trade.... Some attempt is made 
to offset these irregularities (seasonal) in the fruit business 
by carrying lines of confectionary. In recent years the whole¬ 
sale groceries have been venturing further and further into the 
field of fruit jobbers and one of their advantages has been that 
their overhead has been carried very largely by the more stable 
commodities." 

CASSELS, J.M. "Fruit Distribution in the Canadian West." 

Jour. Pol. Econ. 57 - 1?2?. 


8c. Wholesalers T Meetings & Price,Arra ngements 

Wholesalers arrange to bring in pool cars of vegetables 
during the winter and divide these among, them. The same is done 
for certain fruits when the demand is limited. 

"These pools are usually composed of only five of the well

268 . 


established jobbers and it is part of their general policy to 
shut out the grocery houses,&the small jobbers who are trying 

to break into the business.Having experienced the advantages 

of price agreements in connection with these deals, it would be 
strange if they did not attempt to extend the practices to other 
phases of there business...• The result is that, although a list 
of prices is nominally agreed to each week at the jobbers’ meeting, 
it is by no means strictly adhered to in practice." 

"Some markets are more thoroughly organized than others. In 
Edmonton the presence of a couple of strong independent firms has 
prevented any very effective understanding. In the city itself 
and in the towns along the C.P.R. main line there is no pretence 
whatever at price fixing. In the outlying districts where the 
independents have less influence, the "Big Five" have their private 
understandings." 

CASSELS, J.M. "Bruit Distribution in the Canadian West." 
lour. Pol. Econ. 37 - 1929* 


8d. Credit bv Wholesalers 

"Wholesalers play an important part in the process of dis¬ 
tributing fruits..... Not only do they take the responsibility of 
bringing in and delivering fruit..... but it is also through them 
that many of the country stores obtain the credit they require for 
handling it. It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that their 
function partakes of the nature of credit as well as of merchandi¬ 
sing. 11 

This is explained because of the inability of farmers to pay cash 
until after harvest, which results in stores having to ask whole¬ 
salers for credit. 

"In many cases the jobbers carry certain retailers on their 
books throughout the season and get no more tnan fracuional pay 
ments until after the harvest."

low, medium or high income receivers, ana whether their occupations 
were mainly laboring, mixed, or business and professional. The 
question was rather unsatisfactory because no standard of income 
was set to constitute either low, medium, or high. The division 
was thus very arbitrary. It is unlikely that all operators have 
the same opinion as to what is a low, medium or high income. 

The same criticism can apply to the division of occupation, 
but this is likely less arbitrary than the income question. There 
are certain occupations that are definitely laboring, but many that 
may be arbitrarily placed in either of the three groups accoraing 
to personal opinions. 

To the extent to which operators would vary in the arbitrary 
classification, the data may have been in error from a standara 
unit, if it had been used. However, the classification is likely 
close enough to illustrate the predominant incomes and occupations. 

♦ t • t 

9b• Method of Estimating Turnover on Fruits and Vegetables 

Some of the operators were able to give their 1933 turnover 
on fruits and vegetables, but others could not. The operators 
were also asked to state the average value of their weekly purchases 
of fruits and of vegetables and also the total value of these. 

When the turnover was given this figure was considered the more 
accurate, but when it was not given the purchase value of both 
fruits ana vegetables was arbitrarily increased by 20in order 
to get an estimated turnover. Where the annual value of fruits 
and vegetables was given this was considered more reliable than 
the annual value computed from the average value of weekly purchases.

270. 


In each case the figure considered more reliable was used. Twenty 
percent was selected because this was approximately the average 
spread operators attempted to obtain over cost price. However, 
using this spread assumes that this was actually obtained, for 
which no assurance can be given. 

Because of the necessity of estimating the turnover for many 
of the independent groceries, the figures on value of and turnover 
on fruits and vegetables are not considered very reliable. 

It is necessary to emphasize that in taking records concerning 
value of daily, weekly, monthly, etc., purchases, the total value 
for the year should be obtained, if possible. This makes it possible 
to observe whether the short period valuation has been over or under 
estimated. The accuracy of information can also be increased by 
making a few calculations with the operator, i.e. the average weekly 
estimates multiplied by j?2, to see whether they come to more than 
the total annual value. In a number of cases in the records used 
in this study, it was found that the total value for average weekly 
purchases was more than the total value of annual purchases when 
both figures were given. 

• o •' ... ... 

9c. 

In a discussion on retailing of fruit Cassels points out 
the following points in favor of large stores. He states 

"In handling fruit the large stores have an immense advantage. 
The corner grocer in the city, or the general store in the small 
town, runs far greater risk of loss than does a large establishment.' 

Factors enumerated for the disadvantage of small stores are:- 

**uncertainty of dealings" "uncertainty of demand" and "un¬ 
certainty of supply".

271. 


The greater risk small stores have to assume because of these 
factors makes them less suitable and more costly for distributing 
fruit than large stores. The large stores in the city have several 
advantages, such as, they can employ a specialized buyer; purchase 
in large quantities and so obtain the best prices; because of 
rapid turnover stocks are fresher; in busy seasons they can buy in 
carload lots and so save on wholesale costs. Because of reduceu 
risks and quicker turnover, costs are less for the large stores. 

"As far as the retailers are concerned, the economic advantages 
of large-scale dealers seem to be clearly established. The growth 
of the large grocetarias, the spread of chain stores, and the 
association of the small merchants into groups for cooperative 
buying may be confidently expected to lower the costs of retail 
distribution."
