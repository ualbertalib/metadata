SYNOPSIS 


The primary purpose of this investigation was to de¬ 
termine the status of arithmetical achievement of the Grade 
Sight pupils in Alberta schools. In addition, the relation¬ 
ship of intelligence and sex to this achievement was also 
studied. Samples were selected randomly from four types of 
Alberta schools — urban, town, graded rural and ungraded 
rural. The Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills, 
Advanced, Form 0, and the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability 
Test, Beta, Form CM, were administered. 

Statistical comparisons were made to determine the 
effect of intelligence, sex, and environment on arithmetical 
achievement. The relationship existing between intelligence 
and environment were studied by comparing the mean intelli¬ 
gence scores of the four Alberta samples. Correlation co¬ 
efficients were found to discover the relationship existing 
between intelligence and arithmetic. Sex differences in 
mental ability and achievement in arithmetic were studied 
to find relationships existing first, between sex and intel¬ 
ligence, then between sex and arithmetical achievement. Also 
comparisons were made between the urban, town, graded rural, 
and ungraded rural schools to find the effect of environment 
on arithmetical achievement. Finally, the medians of the

four types of schools were compared with the medians of the 
arithmetic test norms to determine significant differences 
existing between Alberta children and the American children 
on which the test norms were based. 

This study produced evidence to show that the graded 
schools of Alberta were providing instruction much superior 
to the ungraded schools. In general, the Alberta children 
were slightly below the norms of the Iowa Every Pupil Test 
of Basic Arithmetic Skills; however, no ungraded rural 
schools were included when the test norms were established* 
It was found that a strong relationship exists between in¬ 
telligence and arithmetic* Since environment influenced 
the mental ability scores it was not possible to determine 
the extent to which each influenced the achievement in 
arithmetic. Sex differences were slight but what differ¬ 
ences did exist favored the boys in arithmetic and the girls 
in mental ability as measured respectively by the Iowa and 
Otis tests. Of the three factors (intelligence, sex, and 
environment) environment appeared to have the greatest 
single effect on arithmetical achievement.

CHAPTER I 


PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 

The needs of our children in the complex changing 
society of today necessitate a constant and vigilant evalu¬ 
ation of all aspects of our educational program. In Alberta 
arithmetic is an integral part of our curriculum. The four 
general objects of education in Alberta ~ personal develop¬ 
ment , growth in family living, growth toward competence in 
citizenship, and occupational preparation 1 are believed to 
be aided by the teaching of mathematics. As our understand¬ 
ing of the educational progress is increased by research, 
only then may our pedagogical procedures keep pace with the 
educational needs of our children. 

The recent emphasis on meaningful arithmetic and 
understanding has caused modern educators to search for 
new ways to present the basic concepts. These concepts 
were often only partially understood. 

Brownell suggests that the arithmetic program of the 

past twenty-five years has been inadequate in that: 

first, these programs have given children little 
chance to use ideas and skills already learned in 
solving their own personal problems; second, these

arithmetic programs have neglected the meaning and 
rational principles which make arithmetic a phase 
of mathematics*2 

The importance of research in arithmetic has been 

stressed by Glennon and Hunnicutt when they report that “in 

almost no other subject matter has research contributed as 

much knowledge about improved ways of teaching as has the 

3 

research that has been done in the field of arithmetic.”^ 

The need for a thorough investigation of the status 
of arithmetic achievement in the Province of Alberta has 
existed for some time. In May 1953, an extensive survey 
was conducted by Dr. R. E. Rees and Dr. G. M. Dunlop in read¬ 
ing and language in Alberta schools. A similar program in 
arithmetic was launched in April, 1955 by the Faculty of 
Education with the assistance of the Alberta Research Com¬ 
mittee. This investigation has been divided into two sec¬ 
tions. Mr. R. 0. Pritchard is making a detailed analysis of 
the results obtained from the Grade V group and the writer 
is more directly concerned with the results of the Grade 
VIII group. It is hoped that further studies may be made 
by other investigators from the results of this project.

The writer’s purpose is not to change radically our 
present curriculum, but to determine how well our course of 
studies is meeting the needs of our youth in view of the 
recent emphasis in arithmetic* The arithmetic test used in 
the study lends itself applicably to this purpose* More 
will be said later about the testing instrument. 

More specifically some of the questions the writer 
hopes will be answered, at least in part, are these: 

1* Which type of school is providing the most effec¬ 
tive educational program in arithmetic? 

2. What phases of our arithmetic program are being 
adequately taught? 

3* What deficiencies are apparent, if any? 

4. To what extent does the intelligence factor affect 
achievement in arithmetic? 

5. Is there any significant difference in achievement 
between boys and girls? 

6* Are Alberta pupils making normal progress in 
arithmetic? 

7* To what degree does environment influence achieve¬ 
ment in arithmetic? 

8. How does arithmetic achievement of Alberta children 
compare with that of American children on the Iowa 
Every Pupil Test of Basic Skills in Arithmetic? 

In addition, it is hoped the results of the study

may be useful in helping teachers, principals, and other 
educational leaders in making useful comparisons between 
their areas of interest and the achievement of the pupils 
tested. Data provided by this standardized instrument 
enable the comparing of mean scores between different types 
of organizations and the norms of the group on which the 
test was standardized* Comparisons thus made would afford 
a means of determining strengths and weaknesses and ulti¬ 
mately the improving of instruction.

CHAPTER II 


THE RESEARCH DESIGN 

Several problems inherent in an experimental study 
which are basic and vital are: the sources of the data, the 
method of procedure, the testing instruments, and the treat¬ 
ment of the findings* Misuse of any of these aspects of 
research would invalidate the findings and waste the time 
and effort of the investigator. Consequently, careful ex¬ 
planation will be given to each of these topics as related 
to this project. 

I. SOURCES 05' THE DATA 

Statistics based on normal curve distributions and 

reliability formulas assume random samples. In order to 

4 

satisfy the criterion of randomness Garrett states that 
this is met when every person in the population from which 
the sample has been drawn has an equal chance of being 
chosen. Since this was an administrative impossibility, 
criteria governing randomness within certain limits had to 
be established. 

The sample chosen for this investigation involved

four different types of Alberta schools — urban, town, 

graded rural, and ungraded rural. The places considered as 

cities were those which had received provincial status as 

recognized by the Department of Municipal Affairs, Province 

of Alberta. The towns considered were those with a minimum 

enrolment of two hundred pupils as recorded in the Annual 

5 

Report of the Department of Education. The graded rural 
groups were chosen from divisions and counties which were 
reported as having at least three hundred conveyed pupils 
within their jurisdiction.^ The ungraded rural sample was 
selected from one room schools in various divisions and 
counties. 

Other limitations placed on the groups for sampling 
and administrative purposes were: 

(a) Only classrooms in the cities where one grade 
was being taught were chosen. 

(b) Classrooms in towns and graded rural schools 
were not to contain more than two grades. 

(c) All Grade Till pupils in the classroom of the 
graded rural school were to be tested. It was felt that 
the few village or town pupils who would be included in the 
graded rural sample would have sufficient rural background

that the results obtained would not be greatly affected* 
Omission of these pupils from the test would have created 
a classroom administrative problem* 

II. METHOD OF PROCEDURE 

The actual selection of a classroom varied according 

to the area considered. In the city sample one number was 

assigned for every thousand pupils enrolled* For example, 

Edmonton, with an enrolment of 24,015 pupils, was assigned 

twenty-four numbers, and Drumheller, with an enrolment of 

1,174 pupils, was assigned one number. Every time a number 

7 

was selected, using Lindquist tables of random numbers, one 
classroom was required from that city. The superintendent 
concerned was given instruction in randomizing methods and 
informed of the number of Grade VIII classes required from 
his city. In the town sample one number was assigned for 
each two hundred pupils enrolled in a town school. In the 
graded rural one number was assigned to every division and 
county for every three hundred pupils conveyed, and in the 
ungraded rural one number was assigned for every one hundred 
pupils enrolled in ungraded rural schools. Every time a 
random number was chosen for the ungraded schools, ten pupils, 
rather than a classroom, were required from the division or

county chosen* Copies of the detailed instructions given 
on the randomization of the classes and the administration 
of the test for the superintendents, principals, and teachers 
involved are found in the appendix* This, it was thought, 
would provide for greater uniformity in the selection of 
classrooms and comparable conditions in the administration 
of the tests* 

The samples and numbers of pupils tested are recorded 
in Table I* It will be noted that the urban sample chosen is

considerably larger than any of the other samples. This was 
desirable for two reasons. First, the urban population is 
considerably larger than the other three populations tested 
and consequently, the larger N would give it greater reliability.

Secondly, whereas the number of pupils per classroom is 
greater in the city, a larger N was required to obtain a 
better distribution of classrooms. 

The map of Alberta, Figure I, shows the locations 
of the cities, towns, and divisions selected for the four 
samples. The cities chosen are marked with asterisks, the 
towns with circles. The shaded green areas represent the 
divisions or counties chosen for the graded rural sample and 
the shaded red areas the divisions or counties chosen for 
the ungraded rural sample. Alternate green and red stripes 
indicate that the division was chosen for both the graded 
and ungraded rural samples. A careful analysis of the map 
would support the randomness of the sampling procedures as 
the number of pupils in ungraded rural schools is greater 
in Central and Northern Alberta than in Southern Alberta. 
Furthermore, the number of conveyed pupils is greater in 
Central and Southern Alberta than in Northern Alberta. 

III. THE TESTING- INSTRUMENTS 

The value of a test in any particular situation is 
determined by the purpose of the testing program, that is, 
the specific facts or information desired. Other considera¬ 
tions applicable to this study were the cost of the test, 
the ease of administration, the usefulness of the results, 
diagnostic value, and machine scoring. Careful consideration

also has been given the opinions of unbiased reviewers con¬ 
cerning the relative merits of various tests* When these 
factors had been proportionately weighed, the Iowa Every 
Pupil Test of Basic Skills in Arithmetic, Test D — Ad¬ 
vanced, was chosen to measure arithmetic achievement and 
the Beta Test: Form CM of the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental 
Ability Tests as a measure of intelligence. 

The Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Skills in Arith¬ 
metic, Advanced, Form 0, is divided into three parts. Part 
I consists of forty multiple choice items designed to measure 
vocabulary and fundamental knowledge. Part II tests computa¬ 
tional skills in the four fundamental processes. The thirty- 
three questions are divided into two sections, Section A — 
whole numbers and fractions, Section B, percentage and 
decimals. Part III contains thirty-one problems, many of 
which are related. In addition, the test yields a total 
score involving the sum of the three parts. Since the an¬ 
swer sheet may be machine scored all questions of necessity 
are of the multiple choice variety. 

Brownell states that, 

The items intended to test vocabulary and fundamental 
knowledge are well selected. The examples of Part II 
seem to agree with current school practices for the 
grades ¥ to IX. And the verbal problems Part III 
relate to common social applications.^

This statement by Brownell appears to be in agreement with 
the test constructors who devote a special section in the 
test manual to the need for better understanding of arith¬ 
metic processes. “Children taught by methods which develop 
meaning and understanding will be superior.”^ 

Ayer suggests that the test should prove an excel¬ 
lent instrument in schools where the basic skills are taught 
as tools to better learning and not geared to intensive sub¬ 
ject matter material* He does not recommend the test for 
traditional schools because “they measure skills, not know¬ 
ledge, “ 10 but he does recommend the test to administrators 
who are interested in determining the comparative profici¬ 
ency of their schools in the basic skills. 

A statement appearing in the article by Bryan further 
substantiates the former remarks when she states that “the 
skills in each of these areas have been expertly analyzed 
and those that are crucial to total educational growth quite 
thoroughly sampled*

Some criticism has been made of the ’’none” response 
which is one of the alternative answers to most of the ques¬ 
tions. Bryan 12 points out that the validity of this type of 
response when there is one indisputably correct answer to the 

question ashed, has been well established. Probably the 

13 

most valid criticism of the test was made by Schnell when 
he suggests that the Advanced Battery should be extended in 
scope to sample more of the work in the upper grades. 

The test manual lacks the customary data on relia- 

14 

bility and validity. However, Spitzer reported reliabili¬ 
ties from a seventh-grade sample drawn from fifteen represen¬ 
tative schools. The reliabilities for vocabulary and funda¬ 
mental knowledge, computational skills, problem solving and 
total arithmetic for the Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic 
Arithmetic Skills, Form 0, were respectively .83, .88, .68, 
and .90. He also reported the average reliability for a 
single seventh-grade class in a single school. These reli¬ 
abilities, given in the same order, were .73, *87, *63, and 
.88. Probably one of the best reports which substantiates 
both the reliability and validity of the test is reported by

Tait. The coefficient of correlation (after being correc¬ 
ted for attenuation), between the California Progressive 
Intermediate Arithmetic Test and the Iowa Every Pupil Test 
of Basic Skills in Arithmetic, Advanced Battery, at the 
Grade VIII level was found to be *90• 

In view of one of the purposes of this study, namely, 
to determine the degree to which arithmetic in Alberta is 
being taught with understanding and meaning, it would appear 
that the test chosen for this study provided an adequate 
testing instrument. 

Another purpose of this study is to determine the 
degree to which intelligence is a factor in arithmetic 
achievement. To measure this factor the Otis Quick-Scoring 
Mental Ability Test, Beta, Form CM, was used. Unlike several 
other tests of mental ability, the Otis test provides only 
one score which is suggested as an equivalent score to the 
intelligence quotient of other tests. 

The author of the test, Arthur S. Otis, states that 
the purpose of the Beta Test **is most generally that of 
finding the degree of brightness of a pupil; that is, ob¬ 
taining some measure (such as the I.Q.) that indicates the 
probable rate of progress the pupil will make in .school. 11 ^

Concerning the nature of the test, Kuhlmann states 
that "the choice of the different test items Is ingenious 
and exceptionally well done, though lacking in variety, 
resulting in the reduction of the number of abilities 
measured by the batteryFrom an examination of the 
test it would appear that an attempt was made to arrange 
the test questions in order of difficulty.

forms of the test is.96* If the grade levels are taken

appears to be most accurate in achieving this objective. 

Other factors considered in choosing this instrument 
were the time factor, cost, the ease of administration, and 
the machine scoring answer sheets. Thirty minutes are per¬ 
mitted the pupils for answering the test. The careful in¬ 
structions given concerning administration tend to increase 
uniformity in this respect. In addition, the Otis Tests of 
Mental Ability, Beta, have proven themselves one of the best 
mental ability tests for the prediction of achievement in 
school subjects. For these various reasons it was chosen 
as the other testing instrument. 

IV. TREATMENT OF THE FINDINGS 

After the tests had been administered they were re¬ 
turned to the Faculty of Education, University of Alberta. 
Since machine scored answer sheets were used the tests were 
quickly and accurately scored. The data received were com¬ 
piled on specially prepared assembly sheets, which assisted in 
construction of frequency distributions. From these distribu¬ 
tions means, medians, standard deviations, and in addition the 
standard error of the means, medians, and standard deviations 
were calculated. Skewness, kurtosis, and standard error of 
the measure of skewness and kurtosis also were found. 


A test of the significant difference of means was

rejected. 

Ylhen comparisons were made between scores of the 
Alberta samples and the test norms of the Iowa Every Pupil 
Test of Basic Skills in Arithmetic, it was decided to com¬ 
pare the difference between medians instead of means, as no 
means were established for the test norms, but the test did 
provide percentile tables from which the median or fiftieth 
percentile score could be obtained. Assuming the standard 
error of the median of the established norms was nil in com¬ 
parison to the standard error of the median of the sample 

compared, the standard error of the difference between un-

correlated medians,

dard error of median of the test norms. This would appear 
to be a valid assumption for when an approximate value of 
the standard deviation of the test norm is found, (from the

percentile norms) and an N of approximately 8,860 is con¬ 
sidered, the value of the standard error of the difference 
between uncorrelated medians (to the nearest hundredths) is 
changed little, if any, when these approximate values are 
applied to the original formula. To assume that the median 
of the Iowa Test is the same as the mean would not be valid 
because in Part Two of the test the distribution was signi¬ 
ficantly and negatively skewed. This would affect the com¬ 
parisons, not only in Part Two, but also in the total arith¬ 
metic scores. 

In order to determine the degrees of relationship 

between intelligence and achievement in arithmetic, product- 

moment coefficients of correlation were calculated. A test 

of reliability of the correlation coefficient against the 

null hypothesis was applied using Garrett’s formula fifty-

three. ° A check of the obtained ”t H value was made at the 
.01 level of significance. 

Skewness and kurtosis of the distributions were 
determined by Garrett’s formulas, nineteen and forty .^ In

nificant departure from the normal distribution the standard

errors of skewness and kurtosis were calculated. The criti¬ 
cal ratio was found and the usual f, t'* test of significance 
was applied. 

It should be noted that throughout this study statis¬ 
tical comparisons were made on the basis of obtained raw 
scores. Transmuted scores were used only to determine the 

equivalent raw score that pupils in Grade VIII could be ex- 

28 

pected to attain as supplied by the Examiner f s Manual, 
Therefore, conclusions were based on the differences and 
significance of differences that were obtained between 
uncorrelated data.

CHAPTER III 


RELATED STUDIES 

Research in arithmetic is not new. Many studies have 
reported valid results, not only in factors relating to 
arithmetical achievement, but also in procedures affecting 
teaching methods. Most research in arithmetic has some re¬ 
lation to this present survey; however, the studies reviewed 
are those which were thought to have a more direct implica¬ 
tion on the results. 


I. THE EIRST TESTS 


The first of the tests in arithmetic was made by 
29 

Rice in 1902 when he published a report of extensive 

measurements in arithmetic. The results of testing six 

thousand children in arithmetic showed wide variation from 

school to school and low correlation between results secured 

30 

and amount of time devoted to instruction. Stone," stimu¬ 
lated by the work of Rice, carried on an extensive study of

sixth-grade children in V )08 using a series of tests in funda¬ 
mentals and reasoning processes. The following year Courtis 
published a series of articles "which marked the beginning of 
the movement toward the standardization of arithmetic,"^ 1 
Since these first published results of arithmetic testing, 
which motivated the movement of standardized tests in arith¬ 
metic, many have been constructed. 

II. INTELLIGENCE 

Intelligence is often considered a prime factor in 

predicting success or failure In arithmetic. A group of 

children with high I.Q,. f s should achieve better grades than 

32 

one with low I.Q,. T s. In a study made by Cruickshanlr to 
determine the ability of retarded children to differenti¬ 
ate extraneous materials from needed arithmetic facts, he 
found that normal children ?*ere more adept in differenti¬ 
ating unneeded material from extraneous material than were 
the mentally retarded group. In relation to this study, 
the next important question might be — "What difference, 
if any, is there in intelligence between urban and rural 
children?”

An investigation was conducted by Hinds in order 
to compare the relative intelligence of country and city high 
school children. The Otis Group Test, Form A, was used as 
the testing instrument. Groups were chosen from a city sys¬ 
tem, six large towns, two small towns of about 1,000 inhabi¬ 
tants, and four rural schools some distance from the railway. 
The results of Table II would seem to infer that the environ¬ 
mental factor has a strong influence in determining I.Q,. 1 s.

However, he believed there were factors in general mentality 
that were not measured by that particular test. 

In a survey conducted in Utah in 1526, comparison 
was made in intelligence between the urban and rural chil¬ 
dren* The mean intelligence quotients, as found by the 
National Intelligence Test are shown in Table III* In

This indicated that the two tests measured largely the same 
general abilities of the pupils. The results of the mean 
accomplishment ratios, that is, the educational quotient 
divided by the intelligence quotient, indicated that the 
rural children were making more satisfactory progress than 
were the urban children. 

Another study of environmental influence on intel- 

36 

lectual development is reported by Shepard. The Otis 
Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test and several non verbal 
tests were administered to a group of rural children in 
two small cities of Chanute (9,78?) and Independence 
(12,211), Kansas, and the urban group was chosen from a 
representative public school in New York City. Chanute and 
Independence were considered rural communities because of 
their locations in the center of a rural area* He found 
that the urban children were significantly superior to the 
rural in verbal ability as measured by the Otis Test of 
Mental Ability. From the results of some of the non verbal 
tests he found the rural group superior. Consequently, his 
findings supported previous investigation in reporting the 
urban children*s superiority in verbal tests, but he con¬ 
cluded that the total results indicated that such differen¬ 
ces were probably due to environmental demand and practice.

children of Alberta scored substantially higher than the 
children from rural schools. 

Louttit states that the disability in arithmetic !, may 
be attributed to one of three main causes: (l) lack of intel¬ 
ligence, (2) poor computational habits at earlier levels, or 
(9) inefficient methods in doing the operations.Probably 
all three causes are responsible for this particular educa¬ 


tional inability in many cases. Numerous studies have re¬ 
ported coefficients of correlations between intelligence and 
arithmetic achievement. He reports that of thirty-four co¬ 
efficients the range is from .29 to .92 with the mean and 
median both .99• 

A study by Lewerenz 40 of five different intelligence 
tests administered to 284 Twelfth Grade students at the South 
Gate High School in Los Angeles is of special interest. He 
reports the coefficient of correlation between the Otis Self 


Administering Test and the Progressive Achievement Tests in 
Arithmetic to be .66 for arithmetical reasoning and .91 for 
arithmetical fundamentals. Of the five mental tests studied 
he found that the Otis Test had the highest correlations with 
mathematical achievement. A recent study by Gavinchuk 41 of

one hundred pupils from Grande Prairie Junior High School, 
using the same tests, reports coefficients of .26 and *30 in 
arithmetical reasoning and arithmetical fundamentals respec¬ 
tively. 

The Otis Q,uick-Scoring Mental Ability Test and the 
Stanford Achievement Test were administered to Grade V and 
Grade VIII pupils and correlations were made to discover the 
relationship between performance on the Otis Test and school 
achievement. The results obtained are found in Table V. At

A survey of the studies reporting relationship be¬ 
tween intelligence and achievement appears to indicate a 
significant positive correlation. However, it must be re¬ 
membered for purposes of this study that this relationship 
was maintained regardless of the geographic area considered. 

III. SEX DIFFERENCES 

A question which many educational leaders have asked 
is: to what extent is sex a factor in arithmetic achievement? 
One of the earlier studies In this respect was an experiment 
carried out by Phillip. * * * 4 ^ He recorded differences between 
sex which occurred in a class drill covering a period of 
eight weeks. The results indicated that the girls did bet¬ 
ter than the boys in the tests in fundamentals and the boys 

44 

did better them the girls in reasoning ability. Thorndike 
reported a study of the sex differences in arithmetic of 
4,j?00 pupils from Grades VI, VII, VIII, and IX. He concluded 
that sex difference was small in comparison with individual 
differences. In the six studies reviewed by Buswell and Judd 
they concluded "that sex differences in arithmetic ability 
are small but that those which do exist are in favor of the 
boys." 4 ^

Ells and Eox 4 ^ reported the results of a study of 
differences in mathematical achievement of the two sexes for 
over 6,000 students in California Junior Colleges. Compari¬ 
son was made of gross scores for the entire group of low 
freshmen on the mathematics section of the Iowa test. The 
difference in means of 9.34 in favor of the male students 
was highly significant, being over forty times the probable 
error. 


In Alberta the results of a study of the relation 
between problem solving ability and sex by Tanner 4 ^ of 211 
boys and 221 girls in Grade V in Edmonton schools found that 
the boys scored relatively higher than the girls. 

Sansom 4 ^ studied the results of sex differences from 
those obtained on the five-year testing program between 1945 
and 1948 for pupils entering Grade X. He concluded from this 
phase of his study that the boys showed only a trifling 
superiority. However, this superiority was lost entirely in 
1?48. However, from an earlier study of problem solving in 
arithmetic, he stated that the boys were markedly superior

difficulty of the problem. 

In 1953, the Department of Education administered 
the standardized British Columbia Arithmetic Test to Grade

this program was extended to include Grades VI, VII and VIII 
and in 1?40 to include Grades III, IV, and V. Since one of 
the tests used was the Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arith¬ 
metic Skills, the results were drawn by selecting the papers 
of every tenth pupil from alphabetical tests separately pre¬ 
pared for each grade within each school. The Elementary 
Battery was administered to Grades III to V and the Advanced 
Battery to Grades VI to VIII. The results obtained in 
arithmetic are recorded in Table VII. The minus sign was 
used arbitrarily to signify a difference in favor of girls.

The boys maintained an insignificant difference over the 
girls except in Grade IV, It should be noted, for the pur¬ 
pose of the present study, that the critical ratio value at 
the Grade VIII level approached the "t significance 
ratio of 1,96. They further state that the sex superiority 
of the boys in geometry is maintained at the high school 
level, but in algebra, in two of the three cases, the girls 
showed an insignificant superiority over the boys. 

A summary of these studies in sex differences in 
arithmetical achievement would appear to agree with Olson 
when he states n that boys tend to show a superiority to the 

girls in arithmetic in the elementary grades. This superior- 

31 

ity appears to be maintained in the high schools. 11 However, 
it should be noted that in many studies this superiority is 
statistically insignificant and in a few cases favors the 
girls. 

IV. ENVTROWEN 1 !AL IHTLTIENCE 

The question regarding the influence of environment 
on achievement in arithmetic has been prominently in the 
minds of many educators. White found a 11 statistically 
reliable relationship between experience and the ability

to solve verbal problems•” If we assumed that all other 
factors were equal, then differences in achievement between 
urban and rural areas would be due to different environmen¬ 
tal conditions* 

The Courtis test in arithmetic was given to pupils 
in Grades III to VIII in a number of rural schools in a 
county in Illinois* Scores obtained by these pupils were 
compared with published norms of the test. The tables pub¬ 
lished by Courtis were based on 7,008 children who were 
nearly all in city schools. Taylor^ found that the city 
children were superior to the country children and recom¬ 
mended that more attention given to drill would probably 
increase the efficiency of the work of the rural children. 

Buswell and Judd-' reported briefly the results of 
three other similar studies in which comparisons were made 
between urban and rural areas. A study in the Miami Valley 
was made using the Cleveland Survey Tests in Arithmetic. 

It was found that pupils from rural districts did not do as 
well as the town pupils. A study in the Santa Clara County

compared achievement between city and rural children and 
found that the city children were better trained in arith¬ 
metic, Another study in the same county made comparison 
with the means of the Courtis test. The conclusion reached 
was that little attention is given in rural schools to indi¬ 
vidual differences. In summarizing the results of studies 
they stated that the universal result shows that rural 
children obtain the lower average scores. 

In 1947, the Alberta Department of Education carried 
out an extensive survey in which the arithmetical achievement 
of Grade VI pupils was compared. The Oviat Arithmetic Tests 
were given to city, town, village, rural, and correspondence 
students. A comparison of percentile ranking of the pupils 
according to schools placed them in the same order. The city 
students received a percentile ranking of 63*0 and the cor¬ 
respondence students 31.0. The conclusion reached was that 
the difference between each group was definitely significant 
when considered on this basis. Again in 1953, a similar 
study was made using the same test. In selecting the samples 
it was decided to choose approximately 2,000 pupils. Factors 
considered were: approximately equal distribution between 
urban and rural population, geographic distribution, and in¬ 
clusion of areas in which a language other than English was 
widely used. It reported the results as in Table VIII. 

Again it was found the urban children did better than the

children from the divisions in both arithmetical problems and 
accuracy, A second part of the 1933 testing program cited 
earlier in this chapter involved the use of the British 
Columbia Arithmetic Test, This test is of special signifi¬ 
cance to the Alberta program since it is based upon the "Study 
Arithmetic Series, 11 which has been the basic arithmetic series 
for Alberta since 1947. Again comparisons were made between 
city and divisional pupils* A critical ratio value of 7*343 
was found when the mean scores were compared. This would in¬ 
dicate that city pupils are significantly superior to those 
of the divisions in achievement in arithmetic as measured by 
this test* When consideration is given to these findings 
there seems little reason to doubt the "universal result,"

Y. STATUS OF ARITHMETIC 

During the past few years considerable criticism has 
been levelled at education regarding the standards of our 
schools. Like many other criticisms of this kind, it is 
based largely on public opinion, not facts. Probably one of 
the most unique comparisons between past and present was made 
by Caldwell and Courtis^ when they compared the performance 
of tests given in 134,5 with equivalent tests in 1919* The 
authors compared the selected best of 184.5 and the lower 
forty per cent of the 1919 pupils. Nevertheless, the median 
score of 27«3 in 1843 was far below the 4j?..5 recorded for 
the children in 1919. 

In 1922, Kolstad^ reported the results of a study 
of the arithmetic ability of men in the a my and of children 
in the public schools. He compared the Alpha Scales in 
Arithmetic of the army with school results. He found that 
the average literate man had an ability for solving problems 
equivalent to the seventh-grade children.

Probably one of the most extensive surveys conducted 
to determine the status of education was conducted by Tiegs. 
The survey included 230,000 cases, 140,000 of which were from 
California. The Progressive Achievement and Stanford Achieve¬ 
ment Tests were administered. In arithmetic there was "an 
over all gain of 1.4 months in arithmetic fundamentals and 

58 

1*8 months in arithmetic reasoning." 

The purpose of the five year testing program from 
which Sansom obtained his results was "to determine whether 
the grounding of high school pupils tn the lower grades is 
improving or declining.The plan was to give identical 
tests for at least five years and to examine results for 
indication of trends® A large sampling of Crade iC students 
were given the tests each year in every type of school in 
which this grade was taught® Sansom stated that the most 
impressive fact that emerges from all the statistics was the 
steadiness of elementary education in Alberta® The arith¬ 
metic results showed an improvement when compared with the 
1943 results but not with each succeeding year between 1543 
and 1548. This finding appears to agree with the result of 
the Department of Education survey in arithmetic. When com¬ 
parison of the mean scores was made between the 154? and 1555

results, based on the Oviat Test, an insignificant decline 
in achievement in arithmetic was noted. 

Two studies have been made recently which compare 
the means of Alberta children with equivalent Grade Scores 
based on the test norms. Peta^ 0 studying the results of 
Lethbridge pupils in Grades VII, VIII, and IX, compared them 
with the norms of the test. He reports that the Alberta 
pupils are significantly above those pupils on which the 
norms of Schorling’s Hundred Problem Test were based. The 
1933 Department of Education survey results compared with 
the norms obtained from the British Columbia Arithmetic Test 
also were favorable to Alberta children. Table IX shows the 
equivalent grade scores of the Grade VI students tested on 
April 1, 1933 * 

The most logical conclusion in these findings appears 
to be that there has been considerable improvement in the 
status of arithmetic in the last thirty or forty years, but 
in the last ten years, little if any, noticeable changes 
have occurred. However, grade score comparisons with the 
norms of standardized tests report favorable standing for 
Alberta pupils. The results of the present study should 
give some insight into the total picture when comparisons 
are made with the test norms.

CHAPTER IV 


RELATION OF INTELLIGMCE AND SEX 
TO ARITHMETICAL ACHIEVEMENT 

The main purpose of this survey launched by the 
Faculty of Education, University of Alberta, was to deter¬ 
mine the status of arithmetical achievement of Grade VIII 
pupils in Alberta, From the results found it was hoped 
some recommendations might be forth coming which would assist 
in the direction of future policy. Some factor s affecting 
or influencing education may be statistically measured while 
others may not. The purpose of this chapter is to study two 
of these factors to determine the effect, if any, they may 
have on achievement in this particular subject. Findings 
discovered should assist in interpreting the results of the 
following chapters. 


I. DATA ON INTELLIGENCE 

All teachers realize that intelligence has some re¬ 
lationship to achievement. "Intelligence, as measured by 

intelligence tests, is closely associated with scholastic 
6 2 

success." This appears to agree with the definition of 
intelligence cited earlier from the manual of the mental

ability test used. If such is the case, then we would ex¬ 
pect that differences found in mental abilities of the four 
types of schools tested would rank in the same order as the 
results obtained from the Iowa Every Pupil lest of Basic 
Arithmetic Skills. Also, correlations made between the 
mental ability scores and arithmetic scores should show a 
reasonable consistency. However, it must be remembered, 
that affirmation of these two assumptions, would not neces¬ 
sarily mean that intelligence is the only criterion for 
success in arithmetic. 

Comnarison of Mean Mental Ability Scores . The Otis 
Quick-Scoring Mental Ability lest, form CM, provides only 
one score which Is considered equivalent to the intelli¬ 
gence quotient of other tests of mental ability. The four 
types of schools tested were, urban, town, graded rural, 
and ungraded rural. The corresponding H f s (the number of 
pupils from each type of school), along with the obtained 
means, and standard deviations are shown in Table X. 
Probably the most noticeable finding is the wide varia¬ 
tion in the mean scores of the urban and ungraded rural 
children. Another interesting, although somewhat unexpec¬ 
ted result, is the graded rural T s comparatively good show¬ 
ing. The mean of the graded rural exceeds the mean of the 
town. This finding reverses the order of these schools as

reported by Reid.^ A further comparison of these means is 
given in Figure II when compared with the Otis mean of one 
hundred. Three of the groups have mean scores above that 
of the norm of the standardized test, whereas the ungraded 
rural is considerably below. The standard deviations ap¬ 
pear remarkably uniform, which suggests that the variability 
within each sample is almost equivalent* The slight varia¬ 
tions that do exist suggest the greatest variability in in¬ 
telligence is in the ungraded rural group, while the least 
is found in the graded rural.

the critical ratio values of 1.91 and Z.59 or greater were 
considered significant at the *05 and *01 levels of signi¬ 
ficance respectively* 

The most obvious result is the relatively poor 
showing of the ungraded rural group* In less than once in 
a hundred would a difference of means as indicated result 
from the sampling technique* In all cases the ungraded 
rural mean is significantly below the level of the other 
groups* The urban group, which had the highest mean, 
statistically is superior to the other groups in intelli¬ 
gence as measured by the Otis test* These two results 

64 

would support the findings of Hinds* The apparent superi¬ 
ority of the graded rural over the town was statistically 
insignificant. These two groups have similar environmental 
experiences; thus, this result would appear normal. Since 
the testing instrument used in making these comparisons is 
essentially a verbal test, the superiority of the urban 
group, followed by the graded rural and town, and lastly 
the ungraded rural, was to be expected; that is, If the 
results of early findings are to be considered. Probably 
the environmental influence and the nature of the test are 
the two most important factors for the relative showings as

indicated. Sherman and Key’s conclusion that 

the expression of intelligence, as measured by 
standardized tests, depends in a large measure 
upon the opportunities to gather information and 
upon the requirements made upon the individual by 

his environment®^ 

appears quite applicable. 

There seems little reason to doubt the reliability 
of the means as considered in this part of the report. 

Their reliability is contingent upon two factors: the size 
of the sample and the distribution of the individual scores 
around the mean. Tests made for homogeneity of variance 
proved that no significant difference occurred in the vari¬ 
ability of the samples. Consequently, the only other fac¬ 
tor which may have affected the reliability of the sample is 
the N. The size of the samples reported would suggest no 
reasons for doubting the reliability. However, it must be 
remembered that the pupils were selected by classrooms, not 
individuals. In the town sample only eight classrooms were 

selected. If bilingualism is a factor which influences in- 

66 

telligence quotients as suggested by Reid, then there 
seems to be some reason to doubt the town mean as reported.

A check on the number of bilingual students in each sample 
indicated that there were approximately twice as many bi¬ 
lingual students in the town sample as in each of the other 
three groups. Such a variation is likely the result of 
classroom sampling. Further investigation would be recom¬ 
mended. However, this appears to have affected very little 
the total study. 

Correlation Between Mental Ability and Arithmetical 
Achievement . Numerous studies have reported correlations 
between intelligence and achievement in arithmetic* These 
all show a positive correlation depending largely on the two 
tests being correlated. However, some variations have been 
noted which were dependent upon the environmental influences 
of the pupils tested. Gray^ states that the relation of 
achievement in arithmetic to mental ability does not depend 
as much on the level of intelligence as on the level in the 
group receiving instruction. This probably accounts for the 
wide disparity that exists in the reported correlations. If 
this were true, then we would expect the highest correlations 
to exist in the localities where both the intelligence and 
arithmetical achievement are the highest. The results of 
this study would support this view though the obtained dif¬ 
ferences do not appear to be statistically significant.

The average of coefficients of correlations with 
wide variations is not a correct procedure since the coeffi- 
cients do not vary along a linear scale; however, Garrett 
suggests that averaging relatively close positive correla¬

difference between correlation coefficients is made in this 
study this method appears acceptable. 

Probably the most interesting fact from an analysis 
of this table is that the highest correlation coefficients 
were obtained from the total arithmetic scores. In three of 
the cases it was higher than all three subtests and equal to 
the highest subtest in the fourth sample. This would suggest 
that a child T s total achievement in arithmetic is more closely 
related to intelligence than any one phase of arithmetic. 

When comparison is made between the relative standing of coef¬ 
ficients of correlation for total arithmetic and means in the 
mean ability test it should be noted that they ranked in the 
same order, except for the town and graded rural samples. 

The coefficients of *64 for these two samples were equal. 

This latter finding is conceivable as there was no signifi¬ 
cant difference between their two mental ability means. 

Another interesting comparison is the apparent rela¬ 
tionship between intelligence and each of the three subtests. 
In every case mental ability was found to correlate the 
highest with vocabulary and fundamental knowledge. The lowest 
correlation coefficients were with computational skills, ex¬ 
cept in the ease of the city sample. The low correlation co¬ 
efficients between mental ability and computational skill 
were probably the result of two factors which in turn are 
closely related. First, many of the Grade Till pupils

received perfect scores in the computational skills’ subtest. 
Second, many teachers place considerable stress on drill or 
practice of the computational skills. The fact that vocabu¬ 
lary and fundamental knowledge surpassed problem solving in 
correlation with the intelligence test is rather difficult 
to explain. The apparent consistency in each of the four 
samples and the large N’s leave little reason to doubt the 
reliability of this finding. Normally on© would expect 
problem solving to have the higher correlation with mental 
ability since both are presumably based on the child’s rea¬ 
soning capabilities* Since Part III of the Iowa Every Pupil 
Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills, form 0, has many related 
problems based on two diagram constructions, a misinterpre¬ 
tation of one or both of these diagrams could result in 
relatively low scores on this part of the test, for example, 
a child of average mental ability with some experience in 
carpentry work could quit© conceivably do better in questions 
98 to 104 than a child of high mental ability with no experi¬ 
ence in carpentry work. A more careful detailed analysis of 
the problem section of this test with the pupils obtained 
results would be essential to validate this conclusion. 

In order to determine if the obtained reliability 
coefficients were a significant departure from zero the null 
hypothesis theory was applied and the corresponding "t” 
values as recorded in Table XIII were found by the formula

Referring to Garrett’s Table Zy 7 it was found that 
at *01 level of significance the corresponding u t" value 
with two hundred degrees of freedom is £*6Q» Consequently, 
we may conclude that the obtained r, t ,f values are highly 
significant* Therefore we reject the null hypothesis theory 
and conclude with confidence that intelligence is a definite 
factor in determining arithmetical achievement.

All the coefficients of correlation found ranged from 
*40 to *70. Garrett^ 0 reports that workers with psychological 
and educational tests are fairly well agreed that coefficients 
of this magnitude denote substantial or marked relationship. 
Thus a valid conclusion from this section of the study would 
be: that when comparisons are made of the relative achieve¬ 
ment in arithmetic of Alberta school children, the intelli¬ 
gence factor (as measured by the Otis test) is important in 
determining the comparative strengths and weaknesses. 

II* DATA ON SEX DIFFERENCES 

Differences that exist between the sexes in relation 
to intelligence and achievement in arithmetic are usually 
small and generally considered insignificant* Both heredity 
and environment are factors which many psychologists believe 
affect intelligence and achievement. The results of this 
study add support to this general belief. 

Intelligence . The previous section of this chapter 
confirms the importance of intelligence in arithmetical 
achievement. Consequently, before comparisons of sex dif¬ 
ferences in arithmetic were made it was thought advisable to 
discover the difference, if any, in intelligence between the 
sexes of Alberta children as measured by the Otis Quick-Scoring 
Mental Ability Test.

Alberta children were made by comparing the obtained means of 
all the boys and girls tested in this survey, For the purpose 
of gaining further insight into the differences which may ex¬ 
ist in arithmetical achievement between boys and girls in the 
four Alberta samples, comparisons are also made between the 
boys and girls in these four areas with respect to intelli¬ 
gence, Table XIV gives the comparison of means and standard 
deviations in mental ability between the sexes,

From Table XIV two characteristics are quite apparent 
First, in each of the four areas tested the girls secured 
higher mean I.Q,. scores than the boys* Second, the degree 
of variability between the sexes in each of the samples ap¬ 
pears quite uniform. In order to determine if any signifi¬ 
cant difference occurs in both of these, the usual procedures 
were applied* 

Table XV reports the obtained results of the signifi¬ 
cant differences between the means. The negative sign in the 
mean difference column indicates the superiority of the girls 
Critical ratios which did not reach the .05 level of signifi¬ 
cance were considered nil; that is, the possibility of ob¬ 
taining differences in the means as found in the urban, town, 
and ungraded rural could occur at least five times in a hun¬ 
dred and therefore were statistically insignificant at both 
the • 0.5 and .01 levels of significance. 

The superiority of the girls in the four areas tested 
would infer that they do better than the boys on the verbal 
type tests of mental ability. However, in only the graded 
rural did this difference reach the significance level. A 
mean difference of 4.82 seems rather dubious when compared 
with the other three groups tested. Although statistically 
significant there seems some reason to doubt this finding. 

In view of the size of the N f s and the results of the other 
three findings, this apparent discrepancy appears to be the

The total girls'superiority over the total boys was 
significant at the .Oj? level. This is the result of two 
factors. The first was the situation previously discussed. 
The second, and equally as important, is the consideration 
of the reliability of the means. The reliability of the mean 
is dependent upon the variability of the sample and the size 
of the N. If the variabilities of the samples are relatively 
constant, as indicated by the uniformity of the standard 
deviations in Table XIV, and if the obtained difference of 
the means are consistently greater than one, as shown in

Table XV, then if the size of the N is increased, a differ¬ 
ence of one which is insignificant in small samples will 
become significant with a much larger sample. This second 
factor is apparent in the results found in Tables XIV and 
XV. However, it should also be noted that the largest 
sample also had the least difference between the means. 

Difference in intelligence between the two sexes 
is usually considered nil by most psychologists, as their 
heredity and environmental influences are similar. That 
marked differences do occur in individual families is a well 
known fact, but these differences are not considered to favor 
either sex* The findings of Rusk^ 1 on a study of intelli¬ 
gence of Scottish children and those of Reid^ 2 on a group of 
Alberta children support this statement. When consideration 
is given to the present findings in view of previous studies 
it wouM appear that the slight superiority of girls on the 
Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test was a result of the 
verbal nature of the test, and not due to any significant 
differences in intellectual capacity.

the variabilities between boys and girls in mental ability,

comparisons were made on the basis of the significance of 
difference in the obtained standard deviations. The negative

In no case did the degree of variability between the sexes 
reach the *05 level of significance* Consequently, it may 
be concluded that there is no significant difference in the 
variability of intelligence between the boys and girls as 
measured by the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test. 

Arithmetical Achievement . The various studies that 
have been made with respect to differences in arithmetical 
achievement between boys and girls suggests that such

differences do exist. These differences are often statis¬ 
tically insignificant but there is a general tendency for 
the boys to be superior to the girls. Gray supports this 
view when he states that, H boys make somewhat better scores 
than girls, on the average, throughout the elementary school. 

After the age of 16 the superiority of boys and men to girls 

73 

and women becomes greater." The results of this study add 
support to previous investigations in this field. 

The statistics comparing the means and variability 
of sex differences in arithmetical achievement are reported 
in Table XVII. For convenience and ease of interpretation 
the table has been divided into four sections; vocabulary 
and fundauental knowledge, computational skills, problem 
solving, and total arithmetic. Comparisons were made be¬ 
tween the boys and girls in each of the four Alberta samples 
chosen in this survey. In addition, the results of the com¬ 
bined boys' and combined girls T scores were compared. To 
assist further in making these comparisons, the results of 
the means in total arithmetic are graphically illustrated in 
Figure III. No consideration will be given in this chapter 
to the relative achievement of the four types of Alberta 
schools since this will be fully dealt with in the next chap¬ 
ter. From the mean and standard deviation scores several 
facts are revealed.

Boys and Girls of the Four Alberta Samples on the 
Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills.

1* The boys* superiority was, with one exception, main¬ 
tained throughout in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge, 
problem solving and total arithmetic. The exception was 
where the town girls did better than the town boys in total 
arithmetic. 

2* The girls were superior to the boys in computational 
skills except in the urban samples where the boys surpassed 
the girls. 

3. The greatest difference in mean scores between the 
boys and girls was found in the urban group in vocabulary 
and fundamental knowledge, problem solving and total arith¬ 
metic. In the computational skills the greatest mean dif¬ 
ference occurred in the graded rural sample. 

4. The degree of variability of the scores about the 
mean appears quite uniform in both the total arithmetic and 
subtest scores. The noticeable exceptions occur in graded 
rural and ungraded rural schools. It would- appear that the 
variability of the boys 1 scores are greater in the ungraded 
rural school in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge, the 
graded rural school in computational skills, and in both 
these types of schools in total arithmetic. 

Before the mean scores were tested for statistical 
significance the influence of perfect scores on the obtained 
means had to be considered. In Part II of the test; that is, 
computational skills, many of the students received perfect

scores. In the other two subtests only one girl received a 
perfect score in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge and 
no student received a perfect score in problem solving. 

When the number of perfect scores in the computational skills 
of the boys and girls was studied, it was found that in every 
case, but one, the distributions with the highest mean scores 
also had the greatest percentage of perfect scores. The lone 
exception occurred in a graded rural school where five boys 
and five girls recorded perfect scores. Consequently, any 
of the statistically obtained significances in Table XVIII 
appear valid. When the critical ratio values in both the 
computational skills and total arithmetic were considered 
along with the number of perfect scores, in no case did it 
appear that the obtained significance of difference would 
be affected by the perfect scores. 

Probably the most significant finding of Table XVIII 
is that when the differences in scores for total boys and 
total girls were considered, the boys were found to be 
superior to the girls in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge, 
problem solving, and total arithmetic; whereas, in the com¬ 
putational skills the superiority of the girls was found. 
However, some reservation must be placed on this finding for 
in none of the areas were there significant differences re¬ 
corded throughout* The two most noticeable exceptions were 
found in computational skills (where the urban boys exceeded

number of pupils in the four types of schools and the strati¬ 
fied sample formulas applied to determine the significant 
difference of the obtained means. 

An analysis of the results in each area as discovered 
by this survey suggests that: 

(a) the urban boys are significantly superior to the 
urban girls in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge, problem 
solving, and total arithmetic. 

(b) the town boys are significantly superior to the town 
girls in problem solving but the reverse is true in computa¬ 
tional skills. 

(c) the graded rural girls were significantly superior 
to the graded rural boys in the computational skills. 

(d) the ungraded rural girls are significantly superior 
to the ungraded rural boys in the computational skills. 

(e) in all other results there is no significant dif¬ 
ference. Thus, the obtained differences could occur in more 
than five times out of one hundred. 

A summary of these findings would support Blair T s 

statement that ,f boys show a superiority in arithmetic 
74 

achievement. 11 However, this superiority was not signifi¬ 

cant in the town, graded rural, and ungraded rural samples 
as found by this investigation. It should also be noted

that the significant superiority of the graded rural girls 
in intelligence, as measured by the Otis test, was not suf¬ 
ficient to give them a superiority in arithmetic, as measured 
by the Iowa test. 

In order to discover the difference in variability 
that may exist between boys and girls in arithmetical achieve¬ 
ment the significant differences of the obtained standard de¬ 
viations were found. Since this difference was statistically 
significant in only two cases the table was not recorded in 
this study. The graded rural boys showed a variability signi¬ 
ficantly greater than the graded rural girls in the computa¬ 
tional skills. Also, the variability of the total boys was 
significantly greater than the total girls in problem solv¬ 
ing. The variability between the graded rural boys and the 
graded rural girls in computational skills may be partially a 
result of the difference in their respective mental ability. 

III. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. The mental ability of the ungraded rural group, 
as measured by the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test, 
was significantly below the level of the city, town, and 
graded rural samples. In addition, the urban group obtained 
the highest mean which was significantly superior to the 
other three samples. These findings are in agreement with 
other similar studies.

2. There was no significant difference in the 
variability of the four samples in mental ability. 

3. The average correlation coefficients between the 
Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test and the Iowa Every 
Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills was .63. When com¬ 
parisons of the coefficients were made between total arith¬ 
metic and the subtests, the highest coefficients of corre¬ 
lation were found in total arithmetic. Of the subtests, 
vocabulary and fundamental knowledge rani© d first, followed 
by problem solving, and finally computational skills. 

4. When tested against the null hypothesis theory, 
all the coefficients of correlation were found to be a sig¬ 
nificant departure from z ero as shown in Table XIII. 

3. When sex differences were compared it was found 
that the girls obtained the higher mean scores in mental 
ability in each of the four types of schools tested. These 
differences were statistically significant in the graded 
rural and total group samples. When tested for homogeneity 
of variance no significant difference was found. 

6. Comparison of sex difference in arithmetic, as 
measured by the Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic 
Skills, showed the superiority of the boys in total arith¬ 
metic, vocabulary and fundamental knowledge, and problem 
solving. The girls were superior to the boys in the compu¬ 
tational skills except in the urban sample.

7. When comparison of the significant differences 
of the means was made it was found that: the urban boys were 
significantly superior to the girls in total arithmetic, 
vocabulary and fundamental knowledge, and problem solving; 
the town boys were significantly superior to the town girls 

in problem solving, but the reverse was found in computational 
skills; and the ungraded rural girls showed the same signifi¬ 
cant superiority to the ungraded rural boys as did the graded 
rural girls to the graded rural boys, 

8. Significant differences in the variability of 
the boys and girls were found in only two of the twenty rela¬ 
tionships studied. These existed in the graded rural and 
the total group samples. The graded rural boys showed a sig¬ 
nificantly greater variability to the graded rural girls in 
computational skills and the total boys were significantly 
more variable to the total girls in problem solving.

CHAPTER V 


COMPARISON OP ARITHMETICAL ACHIEVEMENT 

The main purpose of this arithmetic survey was to 
determine the status of arithmetical achievement of the 
Grade VIII pupils in Alberta schools. Learning is not 
static, neither are methods of teaching. In view of these 
changing conditions two questions were of prime interest. 
Eirst, which type of school is providing the most effective 
educational program in arithmetic? Second, how does arith¬ 
metical achievement of Alberta children compare with that 
of American children? In order to find an answer to the 
first question, comparisons were made between the mean 
scores obtained in the urban, town, graded rural, and un¬ 
graded rural schools. To study the second question compari¬ 
sons were made between the median scores of the four types 
of Alberta schools and the American children on which the 
norms of the Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basie Arithmetic 
Skills were based. 

I. COMPARISON OE ARITHMETICAL 
ACHIEVEMENT IN THE POUR ALBERTA SAMPLES 

Previous studies made comparing urban and rural 
children all suggest the superiority of the urban pupils in 
arithmetical achievement. The environmental influence has

always been considered a strong factor in the development of 
the child* Development in the arithmetical field would ap¬ 
pear to be no exception. Chapter IV studied the relationship 
of intelligence and sex to achievement in arithmetic* Since 
mental ability was found to be a strong factor in determin¬ 
ing success in arithmetic, the rural children could not be 
ejected to achieve results equal to those obtained by the 
urban children. Blair states that many investigations 
"have clearly shown the remarkable way that mental growth 
may be facilitated or retarded by factors present in the 
environment. w ^ The result of the findings in intelligence 
in the previous chapter would support Blair f s statement. 

ITrom the comparison of arithmetical achievement recorded 
in this chapter it would appear that the child 1 s environ¬ 
ment as well as his intelligence influenced the results. 

In this study it was impossible to determine the degree to 
which mental ability and environment predicted achievement 
in arithmetic as achievement quotient tables were not pro¬ 
vided. Sex differences had little influence in determining 
differences in achievement in the four types of -Alberta 
schools, since the number of boys and girls in each area 
were approximately in equal proportions.

the obtained distributions was essential since nearly half 
of the distributions were significantly skewed. This marked 
skewness was caused by a large number of perfect scores in 
Part II (computational skills). The significance of skew¬ 
ness and the number of perfect scores are shown in Table XIX.

To assist further in the analysis of these distributions, 
comparative frequency curves are illustrated in Figures IV

as suggested by Garrett. The percentage of perfect scores 
in Part II, the computational skills, of each of the four 
samples was: urban 7*37, town —* 4#33; graded rural — 
4*63, and ungraded rural — 4*48. 

An analysis of these findings suggests several 
important considerations which are necessary when interpre¬ 
ting significance of difference of the means* In all four 
Alberta samples Part II distributions were significantly and 
negatively skewed# In the urban and town samples this aided 
in significantly skewing the total arithmetic results# In 
all the other cases the skewness was not significant. It 
should be noted the degree of significance of skewness as 
indicated by the critical ratio values in computational 
skills ranks the distribution as follows: urban, town,

graded rural, and ungraded rural. These are in the same 
order as the percentage of perfect scores stated previously. 
These facts are in agreement with the graphical representa¬ 
tion shown in Figure IV. Thus, if the obtained means in the 
distributions rank the four samples in the same order it is 
reasonable to assume that any significant differences in the 
obtained means would be valid. The limitation of this method 
of comparison is that it is possible that some significant 
differences may exist which would not be indicated. 

When consideration was given to the kurtosis of the 
sixteen distributions only one showed a significant depar¬ 
ture from the normal. In vocabulary and fundamental know¬ 
ledge a leptokurtic distribution was obtained with the urban 
group. This suggests that the variability of the urban 
group in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge is distinctly 
different from what could normally be expected providing 
this trait is normally distributed. Since the obtained dis¬ 
tributions in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge in the 
other three samples were slightly platykurtic we may safely 
conclude that this variation in the urban sample was a result 
of some other factor apart from sampling. Extensive practice 
or drill may have been a possible factor. 

Comparison of the Means and Variabilities . Comparison 
of the means and significance of means of urban, town, graded 
rural, and ungraded rural schools in Alberta provided a few

is the same order that Carmichael ' * 1 found when comparing 
these four types of schools in reading. The same general 
ranking existed in each of the subtests. The two exceptions 
were in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge (where the mean 
of the town exceeded that of the urban) and in problem solv¬ 
ing (where the mean of the graded rural exceeded that of the 
town). 

The differences in the obtained means of the urban, 
town, and graded rural schools were small as compared to the 
differences found when comparing the ungraded rural means 
with the other three samples. This wide variation existed 
not only in the total arithmetic means but also in each of 
the subtests. 

When comparison was made between the variabilities 
of the four Alberta samples it was found that, in general, 
the rural schools showed greater variability than the urban 
and town schools. The only exception occurred in vocabulary 
and fundamental knowledge where the reverse was true. 

In order to determine the significant difference 
between the obtained means, the reliability of each mean 
was calculated and the standard error of the difference of 
means was found. The critical ratio, that is, the differ¬ 
ence between the two means divided by the standard error of

the difference of the two means, was then compared with 

78 

Garrett's H t w table to find the level of significance. 

These statistics are found in Table XXI. The negative sign 
in each section of the table indicates the superiority of 
the last group mentioned. The comparisons made in each sec¬ 
tion are in vocabulary and fundamental knowledge (Part I), 
computational skills (Part II), problem solving (Part III), 
and total arithmetic (Total). 

A study of the significance of differences between 
the means of the four types of Alberta schools revealed the 
following facts. 

1. In total arithmetic and in each of the subtests the 
urban, town, and graded rural schools were significantly 
superior to the ungraded rural schools as measured by the 
Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic skills. This is 
in agreement with other related studies. In the previous 
chapter of this study the ungraded rural pupils were reported 
as being significantly inferior in mental ability as measured 
by the Otis test. Consequently, we may conclude that this 
difference in arithmetical achievement is the result of intel¬ 
lectual as well as environmental conditions. Since environ¬ 
ment is considered to have a direct influence in mental growth 
as measured by tests of intelligence it would appear that the 
environmental conditions were the most influential cause of 
this difference in achievement in arithmetic.

graded rural pupil suggests that the superiority of the 
graded rural children to the ungraded rural children was 
largely a result of differences in school environment, since 
the heme environment of the graded rural and ungraded rural 
pupils is similar. 

when differences in the mean scores of the town 
pupils and graded rural pupils were compared, in none of the 
cases was the difference statistically significant. In the 
computational skills the critical ratio value of l.?2 ap¬ 
proached the .03 level of significance. However, in problem 
solving the graded rural children showed an insignificant 
superiority to the town children. 

Irom these findings it is apparent that the town 
and graded rural schools are obtaining standards in arith¬ 
metical achievement which are favorable in view of the urban 
standards. Their only lack appears to be in computational 
skills. The ungraded rural children, however, are consider¬ 
ably lower in attainment in arithmetic as found by this 


survey.

when the variability of the four Alberta samples was 
analyzed it was found that the only distributions which 
showed significant difference in variability were those com¬ 
paring computational skills. All variations which existed 
in the other distributions were non significant, fable XXII

It should be noted that the increasing variability 
of the samples ascends in the order: urban, town, graded 
rural, and ungraded rural. This is the reverse order to 
which the means and percentage of perfect scores ranked. 

The study of the skewness of these distributions showed 
that they were all significantly and negatively skewed. 

Figure IV graphically illustrated these features. These 
factors all suggest that the significant differences in the 
standard deviations were the result of the computational 
problems of the test being too easy to adequately test the 
Grade VIII students. Consequently, it is quite possible 
that, in reality, there is no significant differences in the 
variability of the four Alberta samples with respect to com¬ 
putational skills. Since this seems to be the most likely 
solution for the differences exhibited in Table 2X11 it 
would be unreasonable to attempt to explain these differences 
in variability in any other way. These findings, in relation 
to Part II (computational skills) of this arithmetic test, do 
not invalidate the findings with respect to significant dif¬ 
ferences which existed between the means, but rather may 
limit the number which actually exist.

achievement with standardized test norms. Erom the infor¬ 
mation this writer has received concerning comparisons that 
have been made, the -Alberta children have always achieved 
favorable results. This does not appear to be substantiated 
by the present study. 

It would be inconsistent to make comparisons with 
the norms of the standardized test used without first con¬ 
sidering the basis of the norms. Tait gives a fairly com¬ 
plete summary of the procedure that was used in determining 
the Iowa Battery norms. 

The norms of the Iowa Every-Pupil Test of Basic 
Skills were derived from the Iowa Every Pupil 
Testing Programs for 1?40, 1^41, 1?42, and 1?43. 

Prom the participants in each of these programs, 
approximately 30,000 pupils were selected as a 
sample for the establishment of norms. The norms 
reported are based upon a combination of four such 
samples or a total of 136,831 pupils. The pupils 
were located in more than 330 different school 
systems distributed in Grades III - VIII. 

The schools involved in the Iowa program are 
located in communities that range in population 
from a few hundred to more than 200,000, the 
majority numbering between 1,000 and 30,000. All 
are graded public schools; no one-room rural schools 
are Included. The majority are Iowa schools; 60,600 
pupils were tested in schools located in Illinois, 
Missouri, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, 
Arizona, New York, New Mexico, Montana, and the 
Dakotas.79 

Since most of the pupils came from communities with popula¬ 
tions ranging from 1,000 to 30,000, this would be comparable 
to the towns and cities of Alberta. 

None of the pupils came from one-room rural schools. 
In view of previous findings, the ungraded rural Alberta

pupils could not be expected to achieve results equal to 
those of the test norms# 

Comparison of the Medians . Originally it was 
planned to compare the means of the Alberta samples with 
the means of the standardized test, however, when the Grade 
VIII percentile norms of the Iowa livery Pupil Test of Basic 
Arithmetic Skills were tested for skewness, their distribu¬ 
tions were found to be skewed as greatly as those of the 
Alberta samples. Consequently, the means and the medians 
were not the same# However, the J?0th percentile is the 
median, thus this appeared to be the most valid method of 
comparing the Alberta samples with the norms of the Iowa 
test# When making these comparisons the standard error of 
the difference of the medians was considered to be equal to 
the standard error of the Alberta sample median# This was 
acceptable since the established norms based on a large N 
were very reliable# For a further discussion of this pro¬ 
cedure see Chapter II, pages 17 - 19* 

Since most of the Alberta pupils were tested during 
the latter part of April they had an equivalent grade level 
of the eighth grade and the eighth month. From the grade 
equivalent tables, corresponding raw scores were obtained# 
Table XXIII compares the corresponding medians obtained by 
the urban, town, graded rural, and ungraded rural schools 
of Alberta with the expected medians as supplied by the

Several interesting, though somewhat disturbing, 
results were found. In all cases, except two, the medians 
of the Alberta sample were lower than the medians of the test 
norms* These two exceptions were the superior showing of the 
town pupils in problem solving, and the equal showing of the 
urban pupils in computational skills* The best results of 
the Alberta pupils as a group were found in problem solving; 
whereas, the poorest results appeared to be in vocabulary

deviation of the Alberta sample medians from the medians of

analyzing these results the significant departures of the

shown in Table XXIV. The negative sign indicates the supe¬

Several factors are apparent from Table XXIV. The 
graded rural and the ungraded rural pupils were significantly 
below the test norms in total arithmetic and most of the sub¬ 
tests. Only in problem solving was the difference between 
the medians insignificant for the graded rural pupils. The 
urban children were significantly below the test medians in 
vocabulary and fundamental knowledge. In the other three 
parts of the test the differences were insignificant. In 
no case was the town children’s median significantly below 
that of the test norms; in fact, in problem solving they 
were insignificantly superior to that of the test norm. 

The total results of these comparisons with the 
norms of the Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic 
Skills would suggest that some improvement on the part of 
the Alberta children in Grade VIII would be desirable. Al¬ 
though the town and urban children compared satisfactorily 
in most of the areas tested, there appears to be a definite 
deficiency in arithmetical achievement of the rural pupils. 
This is particularly true of the ungraded rural children. 
However, it must be remembered that no one-room schools were 
included when the norms were established. 

Since the Iowa test places considerable emphasis on 

go 

meaning and understanding as suggested by Ayers, there

seems some reason to believe that not enough stress has been 
placed on this phase of teaching in Alberta schools. The 
favorable showing that Alberta children have made on other 
standardized tests, which presumably do not stress these 
characteristics to the same extent, adds support to the 
opinion that not enough emphasis is being placed on meaning¬ 
ful arithmetic. 

If the assumption were made that Alberta children 
twelve to fifteen years ago were equal in achievement in 
arithmetic to those in the United States on which the norms 
of the test were based, then we could conclude that no im¬ 
provement in arithmetic has taken place in the last twelve 
years in Alberta. In fact, the results of this study would 
show a slight, but probably insignificant deterioration. 

Since no validity can be given for the assumption, the con¬ 
clusion could not be accepted as authentic. 

The environmental and intellectual factors again 
appear to play a prominent part in the achievement of the 
Alberta children. The ungraded one-room rural school pupils 
were considerably lower than the test norms, whereas the 
town and urban pupils were only slightly below. The greatest 
single factor causing this wide difference in achievement 
appears to be the school environment or lack of it. Charac¬ 
teristics of the ungraded rural school such as the multipli¬ 
city of grades, lack of adequate time for instruction in each

grade, lack of facilities, inexperienced teachers, length of 
teacher service, and limited supervision results in the lower 
attainment of the ungraded rural pupils. Furthermore the 
school attendance of rural children often is more irregular 
than that of urban children as a result of the distance from 
school, weather and road conditions, and farm labor require¬ 
ments. Improved classroom accommodation and more congenial 
teaching conditions of the centralized schools were reported 

8l 

by the superintendents to reflect in the quality and re¬ 
sults of instruction. Intelligence and interest also play a 
prominent part in the ultimate success or failure of children. 

III. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS 

1. The distributions of the scores in the computa¬ 
tional skills were all significantly and negatively skewed. 
This was caused by the fact that many of the pupils received 
perfect scores. The most significant skewness occurred in 
the urban sample, followed in order by the town, graded 
rural, and ungraded rural. 

2. In total arithmetic the urban pupils obtained the 
highest mean scores whereas the ungraded rural the lowest. 

The general order of achievement in both total arithmetic and 
subtests was: urban, town, graded rural and ungraded rural.

The differences in the means of the urban, town, and graded 
rural schools were small in comparison to differences exist¬ 
ing between ungraded rural and each of the other three types 
of schools. 

3. The mean differences in the computational skills 
between urban and graded rural pupils and in all mean 
comparisons involving the ungraded rural school were sta¬ 
tistically significant. The other mean comparisons were 
insignificant. 

4. In general, the rural schools showed greater 
variability than the urban and town schools. However, this 
greater variability was statistically insignificant. 

3. Comparisons between the medians of the four 
Alberta samples and the norms of the Iowa Every Pupil Test 
of Basic Arithmetic Skills stress the superiority of the 
American children on which the test norms were based. Only 
in one case, where the town pupils were above the test norms 
in problem solving, did the Alberta pupils do better. The 
best results of the Alberta children were found in problem 
solving; whereas the poorest results were in vocabulary and 
fundamental knowledge. 

6. The graded rural pupils (except in problem 
solving) and the ungraded rural pupils were significantly 
below the medians of the test norms. The medians of the 
town and urban pupils were not a significant departure

CHAPTER VI 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION^ 

The main purpose of this investigation was to deter¬ 
mine, as reliably as possible, the status of arithmetical 
achievement of the Grade VIII pupils in the Province of 
Alberta. To assist in this study some knowledge of the men¬ 
tal abilities of the students tested was desirable. To 
measure these two aspects of education the Iowa Every Pupil 
Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills and the Otis Q,uick-Scoring 
Mental Ability Test were used. 

Conclusions . The conclusions based on the data ac¬ 
cumulated from four types of Alberta schools may be summarized 
as follows : 

1. On verbal tests of mental ability the urban chil¬ 
dren demonstrate a superiority to children from town, graded 
rural, and ungraded rural schools. The greatest differences 
among the four groups exist when comparisons are made between 
the ungraded rural children and children from the other three 
types of schools. The relatively good attainment of the 
graded rural pupils suggests that the school environment was 
largely responsible for the differences that occur. The fami¬ 
liarity of the pupils with tests of mental ability also ap¬ 
pears to influence the results. 

2. The Alberta school children compare favorably

with the norms of the mental ability test. The results ob¬ 
tained by ungraded rural children are not too alarming from 
the mental ability viewpoint. 

3. The average correlation coefficient of .63 
between the Otis Quick-Scoring Mental Ability Test and the 
Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills suggests 
that there is a strong definite relationship between intel¬ 
ligence and arithmetical achievement. However, it was found 
that this correlation is not as significant when compared 
with the individual subtests. 

4. On the Otis Quick-Scoring Test of Mental Ability 
the girls demonstrate a superiority over the boys; however, 
this superiority was not significant in three of the four 
types of schools tested. The verbal nature of the test ap¬ 
pears to be the prime factor in this consistent result. 

3. The boys show a general superiority over the 
girls in arithmetic, although in many cases it is not sig¬ 
nificant. However, in the computational skills the girls 
appear more efficient. The superiority of the girls in the 
computational skills does not appear to exist in urban 
schools. 

6. The Iowa Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic 
Skills does not adequately measure the superior Grade VIII 
students in the computational skills. When used as a survey 
test it has some limitations: however, for normal classroom

use and individual diagnosis it appears quite reliable. 

7. The urban schools appear to provide the most 
efficient type of arithmetical instruction, but this supe¬ 
riority appears to be significant only when compared with 
the ungraded rural schools. The results suggest that the 
ungraded rural schools are also significantly below the 
standards of the town and graded rural schools. 

8. The standardization group of the Iowa Every 
Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic Skills appears superior to 
the Alberta children in arithmetic. In only one of the 
sixteen cases did the Alberta group exceed the median of 
the standardization group. However, this difference was 
not statistically significant in every case. The town and 
urban pupils do not appear to be significantly below the 
test norms. The very poor attainment of the ungraded rural 
pupils suggests some cause for concern. 

?. Of the three subtests the Alberta children ap¬ 
pear to be the most efficient in problem solving; their 
lowest scores being obtained in vocabulary and fundamental 
knowledge. If the Iowa test tests meaningful arithmetic 
then the results suggest that more stress should be placed 
on understanding and meaning in the Alberta schools, par¬ 
ticularly in fundamental knowledge. 

Recoinmendations . From the conclusions derived the 
following recommendations are suggested:

1. That every effort be made by persons responsible 
to encourage experienced and qualified teachers to teach in 
the ungraded rural schools. 

2. That, other factors being equal, the organizing 
of graded rural schools be encouraged. This should result 
in improved achievement of ungraded rural pupils. 

3# That further testing programs be considered to 
evaluate periodically Alberta standards and to provide un¬ 
biased information concerning Alberta schools. 

4. That Alberta norms be established for the Iowa 
Every Pupil Test of Basic Arithmetic skills so that the 
classroom teacher may better evaluate his class by comparing 
them with Alberta standards. 

3. That, in Alberta, teachers be encouraged to place 
more stress on understanding and meaning in arithmetic.

FACULTY OF EDUCATION 



EDMONTON, ALBERTA 
CANADA

March 18, 1955 


The Faculty of Education and the Alberta Advisory 
Committee on Educational Research are sponsoring research 
in the arithmetic field and wish to secure Alberta data 
based on a sampling of urban, town, village and ungraded 
schools, We hope to have Iowa Every-Pupil Tests of 
achievement in Arithmetic and the Otis-Quick Scoring Mental 
Ability Test administered in March or early April to Grade V 
and Grade VIII pupils of representative schools and are 
asking for your cooperation. 

You will note that your area has been selected 
for testing purposes as part of a representative sample of 
the schools of the Province. The Department of Education 
is particularly interested in the project and has assured' 
us of its wholehearted cooperation. 

It will require approximately two hours to administer 
the tests. In return we will mark all tests and supply you 
with a statement of results for your school records. We hope 
that you and your Board will cooperate with us in this project. 

In order to get the study under way would you please 
complete and return the enclosed questionnaire? If your 
answer is favorable we will forward testing materials and 
instructions in the near future. 

Hoping for your cooperation, I am 

Yours sincerely.

Edmonton, Alberta 
April 2, 1955 


To Cooperating Principals, Superintendents and Teachers: 

It has been most gratifying to receive a constant stream 
of letters offering willing cooperation in the University 
sponsored arithmetic research project. 

The study is designed to gather an authoritative body of 
information concerning achievement in arithmetic in Alberta. 
The sample of 2000 is large enough to justify confidence in 
the results. It is distributed throughout four groups: 

Urban, the Town, the Graded Rural, and the Ungraded Rural 
sections of the school population. The sample is randomized 
in such a manner as to insure that the results will reflect 
accurately provincial achievement in arithmetic. 

This is the second major study of its kind in Alberta, 
and we are delighted that you have agreed to cooperate toward 
its completion. We hope that the results will constitute a 
contribution to education in the province. The plan is to 
complete the marking early in May, the statistical analysis 
early in 1956, and then to make the final reports widely 
available. 


Yours sincerely, 




Velma I. Miller

NORMATIVE SURVEY of achievement in arithmetic 


106 


GRADES V & VIII IN AIBERTA SCHOOLS 


I* Introduction - A comparative study of arithmetic achievement 
as measured by the Iowa Every Pupil Test in 
Arithmetic (5-9)* of a random sampling of 
approximately one thousand Grade V pupils and 
one thousand Grade VIII pupils in four types 
of Alberta schools. 


II. Objectives 


III. Method 


- 1. To determine the status of arithmetic 

achievement in Alberta schools. 

2. To correlate intelligence* measured by the 
Otis Quick-Scoring Test* with arithmetic 
achievement in subtest and total scores in 
the four types of schools. 

3. To determine whether sex is a factor in 
arithmetic achievement by comparing the means 
of girls* and boys* subtest and total scores. 

- 1. A sample of 2000 pupils - 1000 in Grade V* 1000 

in Grade VIII drawn randomly so as' to reflect 
accurately provincial achievement in arithmetic. 

2. The tests used will be the Iowa Every Pupil 
Tests in Arithmetic, 


3. A one-page questionnaire will be filled in by 
each pupil. 

b. The random sample chosen is as follows: 

(a) Calgary - 300 - Grade V-150* Grade VIII-150 

(b) Edmonton - 180 - Grade V- 90* Grade VIII- 90 

(c) Camrose - 60 - Grade V-30* Grade VIII-30 

(d) Red Deer - 60 - Grade V-30* Grade VIII-30 

(e) Calgary Separate - 60 - Grade V-30* Grade VIII-30 

(f) Edmonton Sep. - 60 - Grade V-30* Grade VIII-30 

(g) Town group - bOO - Grade V-200* Grade VIII-200 
Randomly selected by classroom from towns 
having 200 pupils enrolled* all resident in the 
town. 

(h) Graded Rural - bOO - Grade V-200* Grade VIII-200 
Randomly selected from divisions which had 

a minimum of 300 pupils conveyed, 

(i) Ungraded rural - b.00 - Grade V-200* Grade VIII-200 
Randomly selected from randomly chosen 
superintendencies drawn from the entire province. 

IV. Administration of Tests - Last part of March or early part of April. 

















107 


SUGGESTIONS TO CITY SUPERINTENDENTS 


1, Rooms should be randomly selected. 

2, Every pupil in the rooms chosen should be 
tested. 

3« Rooms with only one grade be ehosen, ' 

Principals of cooperating schools be given 
the enclosed questionnaires for completion. 

This will speed up the operation. 

5. In the case of your city ( ) 

you will note that we will require approximately 
Grade V pupils 
Grade VIII pupils. 





lo8 


SUGGESTIONS FOR RANDOMIZING GRADED RURAL 


1. In the case of your division or county we 

will ask you to choose approximately 
grade V pupils and grade VIII pupils. 

2. For this group our concern is with the 
centralized school. We are anxious to 
get a sample from those pupils who are 
conveyed and thus hope you may randomize 
rooms from your larger centralizations. 

3. We request that rooms with not more than 
two grades be chosen. 

U. Every grade V or grade VIII pupil in the 
room selected should be tested. (We 
realize that this will include some pupils 
who are not conveyed), 

5>. We would ask that principals of cooperating 
schools be given the enclosed questionnaire. 
This will speed up the study.

Reference; Ari thme tic Research Project 


To: Rural Teachers Taking Part in the Study; 

It occurs to us that teachers may be apprehensive concerning 
the use of the results of the arithmetic study. Certainly you 
are entitled to know how the results will be used. Let us say 4 
right now, that our treatment of the data will not permit 
invidious comparisons of individual teachers or schools. 

The rural school, with small numbers in each of the grades 
tested, may have very high or very low scores, as a single 
brilliant or poor pupil, or a pupil with a language handicap,' 
will exert an extraordinary influence on the average of a par¬ 
ticular school. We realize, also, that some rural schools have 
privileged populations of high socio-economic status, while 
others lie in marginal areas where poverty and a low standard 
of living are present. Too, there is the influence of racial 
origin and language spoken in the home. All such factors may 
affect the standing of pupils in a rural school favorably or 
adversely. 

Everyone concerned with the studv realizes that such ex¬ 
treme differences exist, and is fully aware that such differences 
in achievement as are revealed by the study are the result of 
economic, social, linguistic and cultural factors, and are in 
no way attributable to the present teacher. 

We wish to recommend that you read carefully the instructions 
concerning pupils to be tested, and methods of administration of 
tests, and that you follow the instructions with meticulous care, 
in order that the results will present an accurate picture of the 
situation. 

In return we pledge ourselves to make our analyses of the 
resulting data only in large groups or samples in which the iden¬ 
tity of the individual schools is completely lost. No statistics 
will be computed in t erm s of individual schools . 

A final word. The excellent cooperation we have received 
assures us that our study is going to be a marked success. We 
could not ask for better support. We sincerely hope that every 
one of the cooperating teachers is going to share our pride in 
the study, inarmed by the realization that together we are making 
a significant contribution to educational research in Alberta. 


Yours sincerely,

Cm 


This is a test to see how well you can think. It contains questions of different kinds. Here are three 
sample questions. Five answers are given under each question. Read each question and decide which 
of the five answers below it is the right answer. 

Sample a: Which one of the five things below is soft ? 1 2 3 4 6 

® glass @ stone ® cotton ® iron © ice. I 

The right answer, of course, is cotton; so the word cotton is underlined. And the 
word cotton is No. 3; so a heavy mark has been put in the space under the 3 at th v , 
right. This is the way you are to answer the questions. 

Try the next sample question yourself. Do not write the answer; just draw a line 
under it and then put a heavy mark in the space under the right number. 

Sample b: A robin is a kind of— 6 7 8 9 10 

© plant © bird © worm ® fish © flower.... I! II 

The answer is bird; so you should have drawn a line under the word bird, and bird is 
No. 7; so you should have put a heavy mark in the space under the 7. Try this one: 

Sample c: Which one of the five numbers below is larger than 55 ? 11 12 13 14 16 

©53 © 48 © 29 © 67 © 16.I! II II II II 

The answer, of course, is 57; so you should have drawn a line under 57, and that 
is No. 14; so you should have put a heavy mark in the space under the 14. 

The test contains 80 questions. You are not expected to be able to answer all of them, but do the best 
you can. You will be allowed half an hour after the examiner tells you to begin. Try to get as many 
right as possible. Be careful not to go so fast that you make mistakes. Do not spend too much time 
on any one question. No questions about the test will be answered by the examiner after the test begins. 
Lay your Dencil down. 

Do not turn this booklet until you are told to begin.

IOWA EVERY-PUPIL TESTS OF BASIC SKILLS 

New Edition 

TEST D: BASIC ARITHMETIC SKILLS —FORM O 

ADVANCED BATTERY— GRADES 5-6-7-8-9 

By 

H. F. Spitzer, in collaboration with Ernest Horn, Maude McBroom, H. A. Greene, and E. F. Lindquist (General Editor), all of the 
College of Education, State University of Iowa, with the Assistance of the Faculty of the University Experimental Schools. 


Directions : The other side of this page is an answer sheet on which you will mark your answers to all of the questions in this 
test. To use this answer sheet, you will have to tear it off. Do this now, tearing very carefully along the perforation at the 
left-hand side of this page. 


Each question in Part I of the test is followed by four possible answers, only one of which is correct or definitely bettei 
than any of the others. To answer a question, first decide which is the best answer, then look at the rows of boxes under 
Part I on the answer sheet and find the row of boxes numbered the same as the question . Then place an X in one of these 
four boxes, as follows: 

If you think the first answer is best, mark the first box in the row. 

If you think the second answer is best, mark the second box in the row. 

If you think the third answer is best, mark the third box in the row. 

If you think the fourth answer is best, mark the fourth box in the row. 

Mark only one box in each row. If you change your mind about an answer, erase your first mark very thoroughly. 

Directions for Parts II and III of the Test will be given to you after you finish Part I. 

Answer the questions in all parts of the test in the order in which they are given, but do not linger too long over difficult 
questions or problems. Skip them, and return to them later if time permits. If you do skip any questions, be sure to skip 
the corresponding boxes on the answer sheet also. 

Do not begin work until you are told to do so.

rections : In this section are a number of examples which you are to solve. On the answer sheet, after the num- 
r of each example, you will find three possible answers and an N. The N means that the correct answer for the 
imple is not given on the answer sheet. 

Tou are to do your work right on this page. First solve the example. Then turn to the answer sheet and find 
i number of that example. Compare your answer with those given on the answer sheet. If one of the three 
swers given is exactly like your own, place an X in the box in front of it. If none of the three answers given is 
e yours, place an X in the box in front of the N. Do not rework a problem simply because your answer is not 
e any of those given on the answer sheet. Instead, mark the box in front of the N and go on to^the next ex- 
ipie. 

Reduce all fractions to simplest form. 

The two sample items have been marked correctly on the answer sheet.
