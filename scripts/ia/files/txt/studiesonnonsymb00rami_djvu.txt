ABSTRACT 


The nitrogen-fixing powers of virgin and cultivated 
soils from the grassland region of Saskatchewan were studied 
in laboratory cultures. There was little difference in the 
nitrogen-fixing activity of virgin and cultivated soils inocula¬ 
ted into sand cultures. Aerobic conditions in sand cultures 
favored nitrogen fixation, indicating the importance of the 
aerobic non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing microflora. Soil con¬ 
ditions, such as high nitrate content and acid reaction, 
influenced unfavorably the presence and activities of the 
nitrogen-fixing flora of some soils. Some soils were more 
efficient than others in utilizing available energy.

INTRODUCTION 


The assimilation of atmospheric nitrogen by soil 
microorganisms, working independently of legumes, is often 
disregarded when calculating the nitrogen balance of the 
soil# However, it is the opinion of many investigators that 
this form of bacterial activity plays an important part in 
maintaining soil productivity# 

In 1885, Berthelot demonstrated that soil organisms 
could assimilate gaseous nitrogen# Winogradsky in 1893 
finally isolated an anaerobic form which he called Clostriduim 
pastorianum # Two aerobic forms were isolated in 1901 by 
Beijerinck, to which he gave the generic name Azotobacter # 

Up to the present time, the aerobic non-symbiotic 
nitrogen-fixing organisms have received most attention and 
are often considered to be the more important# Because of the 
economic importance of nitrogen fixation in the maintenance 
of soil fertility, keen interest has been taken in the study 
of these organisms, 'The literature is filled with reports 
concerning the occurrence of these bacteria and factors 
affecting their distribution and activities# 

To the writer’s knowledge, there has been very 
little, if any experimental work on the non-symbiotic nitro¬ 
gen-fixing processes in Saskatchewan * soils• Being the largest

grain producing province in Canada, Saskatchewan embodies a 
wide range of soil and climatic conditions® 

This report is the result of preliminary studies on 
the nitrogen fixing flora of some Saskatchewan soils® The 
three grassland soil zones, brown, dark brown and black, 
comprise the main farming area® The investigation reported 
here is concerned with the soils from this grassland region® 

Of the total calculated area of the Saskatchewan 
grassland region of 37o5 million acres, 30*5 million acres 
are shown by Mitchell et al® (62) to be arable® The non¬ 
arable lands are mainly grazing areas® 

Nitrogen is not generally a limiting factor in crop 
production as shown by fertilizer trials in these zones® 

What part then does atmospheric nitrogen-fixation by non- 
symbiotic soil bacteria play? It is well known that cropping 
removes considerable nitrogen in grain and straw® A classical 
figure often used is 60 pounds of nitrogen removed by a 30 
bushel wheat crop® 

Legumes are not responsible for returning very much 
nitrogen to the soil in this region because of the dry condi¬ 
tions which limit their use® 

Inasmuch as maintenance of a proper forage cover on 
the grazing lands is of importance to the stockman, virgin 
soils as well as cultivated soils were sampled in the study 
reported here® 

It was considered probable that climatic and other 
conditions might have exerted an influence on the microflora

of these regions# One would expect in these grasslands, that 
an equilibrium has been reached between the soil, climate, 
soil organisms and higher plant life# This probably would be 
even more evident in the semi-arid region where vegetation is 
of a climax type. 

It is very difficult to determine the amount of nitro¬ 
gen fixed by non-symbiotic bacteria in the soil under field 
conditions# Various workers have estimated the amount of 
nitrogen fixed at from pounds per acre per year. If the 

organisms responsible were inactive in Saskatchewan grassland 
soils, it would be of importance to determine what factors are 
detrimental to their growth. 

If was hoped in this investigation to determine the 
presence and activity of the aerobic, non-symbiotic, nitrogen¬ 
fixing flora under laboratory conditions. When mentioning 
nitrogen fixation in this report, unless otherwise noted, the 
aerobic non-symbiotic form of nitrogen fixation is referred to. 


REVIEW OF LITERATURE 

The literature on non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixation in 
the last 30 years has been abundant and it would be impossible 
in this thesis to cover more than a small portion. A fairly 
complete review of the subject would be desirable, however, in 
order to better interpret results of this investigation.

Distribution of Nitrogen-Fixing Organisms 

The presence of soil microorganisms capable of fixing 
atmospheric nitrogen non-symbiotically, has been reported 
from many parts of the world, comprising a wide range of 
soil and climatic conditions* Gainey (29) estimates that 
half of all soils examined in Kansas contained azotobacter® 
Martin (5$) surveying reports from workers all over the world 
found that, of 6,257 soils examined, 3,022 or lj.8% contained 
azotobacter. In a general survey of Szechuei province, China, 
Gaw (32) found the aerobic nitrogen-fixing organisms were 
present in 78 percent of all soils examined® 

In a review of the subject. Smith (73) reports Chang 
as having isolated azotobacter from practically all soils of 
Manchoukuo province in China. Sushkina of Russia was reported 
by Smith (73) as unable to isolate the organism from virgin 
soils of the arid regions; but after irrigation of these soils, 
azotobacter appeared® Smith (73) found that Finland was the 
only country reporting which had not been able to isolate 
azotobacter* 

Ziemiecka (91) found the nitrogen-fixing organism in 
most soils of Poland* In his comprehensive review, Waksman (85) 
stated that the organism had been isolated from soils of 
Egypt, Africa, Italy, Australia and many other countries® 
Nitrogen fixers were reported by Ohmasa (66) to be present 
in 8 out of 29 soils from the forests of Tokyo University in 
Japan® Altson (ij.) found strains of the organism present in

certain Malayan soils where the pH was above 6©0® 

The foregoing review has indicated a wide distribution 
of the azotobacter regardless of climatic and soil variations® 

Numbers and Activity in Different Soils 

While the azotobacter organisms are widespread, their 
numbers and nitrogen-fixing powers in various soils are not 
always similar. A number of workers have compared virgin 
and cultivated soils in this respect® 

Greaves (37) examined hundreds of soils from Utah® 

He found that numbers and fixing powers of the bacteria were 
twice as high in cultivated soils as in virgin soils® In a 
study of western Kansas soils, Gainey ( 29 ) found azotobacter 
were seldom present in virgin, but abundant in culvitaved 
soils® Joffe ( 48 ) states that the virgin soils of Crimea 
showed little azotobacter activity, while those present in 
cultivated soils were quite active in fixing free nitrogen® 

He considers that failure of these soils to respond to nitrogen 
fertilizers is due to this active nitrogen-fixation® 

Martin (58) reported that of 9 ^ cultivated samples 
from Arizona, 82 contained the Azotobacter® Of 119 virgin 
soil samples from the same area, only 27 contained these 
microorganisms. In laboratory culture studies he found 19*6 
milligrams of nitrogen fixed per gram of cultivated soil and 
only 5°3 milligrams of nitrogen fixed per gram of virgin soil® 
Martin and Ayers (59)* also working with Arizona soils in the

laboratory, found that: (1) 67 out of 76 cultivated soils 
contained the azotobacter organisms; the other nine soils 
were high in salt; (2) those cultivated soils containing 
azotobacter, fixed 22 milligrams of nitrogen per gram of soil; 
(3) only 6 out of 23 virgin soils contained azotobacter and 
these showed an average fixation of 0.3 milligrams nitrogen 
per gram of soil. 

Greaves and Bracken (37) inoculated soils from Juab 
and Cache counties into synthetic culture media. Cache county 
soil fixed more nitrogen, they indicated, because of the higher 
content of carbonaceous material, and also a higher initial 
azotobacter population. 

The nitrogen content of virgin semi-arid soils of 
Kansas is quite low, according to Gainey (28). He considers 
this due to inactivity of the nitrogen-fixing flora. The 
nitrogen level decreases upon cultivation until a level of 
about Ool percent is reached. He suggests that increased 
activity of free living nitrogen fixers after cultivation 
prevents the nitrogen from being depleted entirely. 

Vandecaveye and Hoodie (83) working with eastern 
Washington soils, observed that: (1) there was no difference 
in the azotobacter population of virgin and cultivated soils 
in non-irrigated areas; (2) azotobacter were present in 
abundance in the irrigated soils of the 10 inch rainfall belt; 
(3) they were frequently present in the non-irrigated soils 
of the 15-20 inch rainfall belt; (If) they were rarely present 
in the non-irrigated soils of the two low rainfall belts, 
that is, where rainfall was less than 15 inches.

Other Nitrogen Fixing Processes 

Not all aerobic nitrogen fixation reported is due 
to azotobacter. It might be well to mention briefly a few 
claims for aerobic nitrogen fixation attributed to other 
organisms and phenomena© 

Green algae were at one time credited with fixing 
nitrogen in the soil, but Allison and Morris (2) found that 
this was not the case; neither could they demonstrate any 
symbiotic relationship beti^een the azotobacter and green 
algae. They did show fixation by Anabaena and Nostoc , two 
genera of the blue-green algae. Stokes (77) could not obtain 
nitrogen fixation by using mixed cultures of azotobacter and 
green algae. The algae, he said, did not secrete enough 
energy to promote nitrogen fixation by the azotobacter. 

Fungi and bacteria have also been credited with fix¬ 
ing some nitrogen. Carter and Greaves (15) found that the 
nitrogen fixing azotobacter were present in most Utah soils 
and fixed atmospheric nitrogen. However, they found one 
soil on the Nephi experiment station which contained no azoto¬ 
bacter, but fixed nitrogen actively® They isolated 27 organ¬ 
isms, 26 of which fixed nitrogen. Present were 10 actinomyces, 
8 bacilli, 8 microcci, and 1 penicilluirio 

Krishna (50)reported fixation of nitrogen by fungi. 
Lipman (53) obtained fixation of nitrogen by yeasts and fungi. 
Stoklasa, whose work is reviewed by Greaves (36), found that 
azotobacter were especially abundant where blue-green algae 
were present in the soil® He did not elaborate®

A few investigators have suggested that nitrogen in¬ 
creases have come about by other than microbiological activities. 

Ingham O 4 . 6 ) discounts nitrogen-fixation by non-symbiotic 
organisms. His reasoning is that: (1) combined nitrogen is 
present and evidence indicates that 10 parts per million 
nitrate or ammonia nitrogen inhibits fixation, ( 2 ) large 
amounts of energy are required (100 pounds of organic matter 
for every pound of nitrogen fixed) and this would not be 
available in the soil* He found that cellulose filter paper 
absorbed atmospheric ammonia and says that cellulose in the 
colloidal complex is responsible for soil nitrogen increases. 

He says that artificial fertilizers are still necessary to 
supplement the soil nitrogen supply* 

A number of agricultural workers in India have attri¬ 
buted nitrogen gains to photochemical fixation. Dhar et_ al. 

( 19 ) reported extraordinary gains due to the effects of light. 
They reported that: (1) soils rich in energy fixed more 
nitrogen when exposed to light than in the dark, (2) there 
i*ere less azotobacter present in cultures kept exposed to^ 
light., Fitrogen fixation was considered as due to solar light* 

Factors Influencing Nitrogen Fixation 

In this review, we will discuss factors which iaay have 
influenced the nitrogen fixing flora in soils of the region 
sampled for this project*

(l) Effect of Reaction 

There is a fair amount of agreement evident in the 
literature on this phase of the subjecto 

Fred and Davenport (2l\.) found the azotobacter to be 
much more sensitive to changes in reaction than the legume 
bacteriao They used a nitrogen-free solution and found the 
critical acid value for these organisms to be pH 6*5 and the 
alkaline value pH 8© 6© The critical acid value was found 
by G-ainey (27) to be pH 6*0© This agrees with most findings 
as to the lower pH limit at which the bacteria are active© 

Burk e_t al* (lif) showed that nitrogen fixation ceased 
at a pH below 6*0© However, when combined nitrogen was present 
in the medium, the organism could survive a pH as low as !j-©0, 
by using this form of nitrogen* 

Altson (I}.) isolated a few strains of azotobacter 
from Malayan tropical soils which tolerated reactions as low 
as pH 3<>6 o The strains were not active, however, when inoculated 
into suitable media© 

In soils of Japan, Ohmasa (66) found azotobacter . 
where the pH was higher than 6*0 but not within the pH range 
of 5° Martin (56) could not isolate the nitrogen-fixing 

organisms from mountain-meadow soils of Arizona, where the 
pH range was ij.®9-6*2* Starkey and De (75) isolated a new 
species which they named Azotobacter indicum * It was capable 
of fixing atmospheric nitrogen at reactions ranging from pH 
3*0-pH 9*0.

fixing organisms has been shown by Martin (58) to be between 
pH 8*8-9*2. Burke and Lineweaver (14)> also reviewed by 
Stephenson (76), carried on respirometer studies with pure 
cultures of azotobacter organisms. Their studies indicated 
optimum growth at pH 7.6-7*8 with both free and combined 
nitrogen. 

A few observations should be made regarding the above 

review. 

1. Some of the work was with laboratory solution 
cultures and often pure cultures of the organisms were used, 
thus differing from field conditions. 

2. Measurements made on solutions, or on ration of 
1:5 of soil to water give pH readings about 1.5 pH units 
higher than when pH measurements are made at the moisture 
equivalent moisture condition according to McGeorge (6l). 

It is conceivable then that reaction limits, found 
in present day studies by soil paste pH measurements, may 
vary from those reported in earlier literature. 

(2) Effect of Individual Ions . 

Considerable research has been reported regarding 
the part played by various elements in fixation of nitrogen 
by azotobacter. 

Some workers have shown these organisms to be sensitive 
to deficiencies in soil phosphorus and calcium. The well-known 
azotobacter (plaque) test for phosphate deficiency is dependent 
on the sensitivity of azotobacter to deficiencies in phosphorus.

Greene (L[JL) concludes that the test is useful only where 
soil is extremely deficient in phosphorus# He also reasons 
that since organisms can adapt themselves to such differences 
as high temperatures, etc#, they can probably do likewise 
with low concentrations of nutrients. He cites Stoklasa*s 
research, which indicates that milligrams of nitrogen 

are fixed for every gram of phosphorus used# The minimum 
required was found to be 2 # 1|.6 milligrams of phosphorus per 
gram of glucose consumed# Greene (Ip.) observed from his own 
results that there was: ( 1 ) nitrogen fixation when 1-2 
milligrams phosphorus were present per 100 ml# of solution, 

( 2 ) maximum fixation when 1 # 75 > milligrams were present per 
100 ml# of solution# 

Ziemiecka (91) in Poland, suggested that nan-symbiotic 
nitrogen fixing powers of soils were an index of pH and lack 
of soluble phosphate# It was shown that; (1) lack of soluble 
phosphate prevented fixation of nitrogen but the organisms 
were present, (2) the organisms were inactive in the range 
0-10 parts per million of soluble phosphate, (3) phosphate 
additions increased the activity of the azotobacter in the 
above soils# 

In Indiana, Roberts and Olson (70) applied phosphatic 
and potassium fertilizers and obtained increased yields# When 
inoculated into mannite solutions, the fertilized plot soils 
failed to show increased flora or activity over similarly 
inoculated cultures from check plot soils# Katznelson ( 1 |_ 9 )

inoculated azotobacter into variously treated soils* Phos¬ 
phate fertilization of soils tended to enhance ability of the soil 
to support the organisms. Martin (58) found that phosphate con¬ 
tents of Arizona soil samples were not correlated with the 
activity of azotobacter even when the available phosphorus 
content was as low as 1 part per million* This substantiates 
findings of Vandeaaveye and Anderson (82) who found phosphorus 
additions non-stimulating to the azotobacter in Iowa and 
Washington soils, when applied even in large quantities* 

Burk and Lineweaver (12) in pure culture work also showed 
phosphorus to be required in only minute quantities* 

It would appear that phosphorus deficiency can be a 
limiting factor for azotobacter activity in some soils. This 
would possibly be true in areas of highly alkaline calcareous 
soils, where phosphates are often unavailable to plants* 

Most artificial media for study of azotobacter organ¬ 
isms include calcium carbonate* Gainey (2?) has shown that 
liming acid soils to a pH above 6.0 will transform them into 
suitable habitats for the organism* In further work (31 )% he 
introduced a calcium clay into regular Ashby 1 s medium, at 
two buffered pH levels. He found that azotobacter were active 
above pH 6*0 but not below pH 6*0 where calcium was available 
from the colloidal clay* He concluded that lack of calcium 
was not the factor responsible for failure of azotobacter to 
fix nitrogen below pH 6*0* 

Burk and Lineweaver (13) using the Warburg respirometer 


technique, showed that calcium or strontium is essential to

nitrogen fixation in pure cultures* The bacteria could grow 
without calcium, however, with combined nitrogen present in 
the medium, if magnesium or barium were also present* 

Martin (58) showed by statistical treatment of his 
analysis, that: (1) the water soluble sodium and calcium 
contents of the soil were closely related to azotobacter 
activity, (2) there was little correlation with soluble 
magnesium and phosphate contents of the samples, (3) chloride 
and sulfate were correlated only by reason of their relation¬ 
ship to calcium and sodium, (ip) the maximum limit for fixation 
in presence of sodium and calcium was around 3#000 parts per 
million* 

(3) Effect of Alkali Salts 

This phase of the literature is possibly the most 
controversial of all* While alkali is not a serious problem 
in the areas sampled in this project, increased irrigation 
may produce such problems in some areas of Saskatchewan* 

Greaves and Lund (39) consider that toxic effects 
of soluble salts on bacteria and plants are due mainly to 
osmotic effects on the cell. Greaves (38) found that: (1) 
most salts toxic to plants are also toxic to bacteria and at 
lower concentrations, (2) the same order of toxicity of 
various salts obtained, (3) smaller amounts of salts stimulated 
nitrogen-fixation, (Ip) nitrogen-fixing organisms remained 
active at higher salt concentrations than other groups, such 
as nitrifying and ammonifying bacteria.

Burgess (11) found active nitrogen fixation up to 
3.0% concentrations of salts in soil and solution cultureso 
Martin (58) reviewed the early work of Lipman and Sharp, who 
found the following as maximum concentrations in the soil 
solution for azotobacter activity: (a) sodium chloride - 0*5%, 

(b) sodium sulfate - 1 * 25 ^, (c) sodium carbonate - Q*i\% percent* 

Lipman and Burgess ( 55 ) showed that: (l) marked 
differences were obtained when calcium carbonate and magnesium 
carbonate were applied in large quantities, (2) calcium carbon¬ 
ate was stimulating, never toxic, up to 2 percent, (3) mag¬ 
nesium carbonate was toxic above 0*l-0*2 percent, (4.) in 
mixtures they were less toxic since the calcium carbonate 
was considered to exert a protective action in both soil and 
solution cultures against the toxicity of the magnesium# 

Nitrogen Relationships 

The nitrogen present in the soil in various forms 
exerts a profound effect on the nitrogen-fixing process* 

The nitrate form of available nitrogen is usually present in fallow 
soils under favorable moisture conditions* 

Winters (90) found with soil cultures in the labora¬ 
tory that: (1) nitrogen fixation was stimulated by-adding 
50-100 parts per million sodium nitrate *,or calcium nitrate, 

(2) 500 parts per million sodium nitrate decreased nitrogen 
fixation, (3) rapid nitrogen fixation was at first shown to 
reduce the nitrate content of soil, indicating that the organ¬ 
ism assimilated some of it#

Gainey (30) found that: (l) relatively high concentra¬ 
tions of sodium nitrate (such as is often found in fertile 
soils) tended to depress nitrogen fixation and azotobacter 
population, (2) the decrease varied with different soils, 

(3) the sensitivity is due to the nitrate ion and not the 
sodium or calcium, (1|_) when urea was added, nitrogen fixation 
was depressed only after nitrification of the urea took place* 

Aso et al. (5) studied the effects of different forms 
of nitrogen on azotobacter activity* Using Ashby 1 s (3) culture 
solution, with added sodium nitrate, a trace of nitrite and 
ammonia was found in solution* They concluded that azotobacter 
use nitrate or nitrite nitrogen only after conversion to 
ammonia* 

Seasonal variations in nitrate content of the soil 
have been reported by many workers. Roberts and Olson (?0) 
found that the high concentrations coincided with lowered 
nitrogen fixation® Zoond, as reviewed by Thompson (?8)> 
found that concentrations over 30 p*p*m. of nitrate nitrogen, 
amino nitrogen, or peptone in mannitol solution, depressed 
nitrogen fixation. 

Fuller and Rettger (26) tested effects of various 
nitrogen compounds and found that non-toxic materials did 
not influence nitrogen fixation appreciably* Horner and 
Allison (ijij.) agreed with the above as regards most soils that 
they studied* 

Thompson (?Q) inoculated different soils with azoto-

bacter and found low fixation where the nitrate nitrogen 
content was high. 

Wilson and Burris (88) working with pure Azotobacter 
chroococcum cultures, and isotopic nitrogen (N^) found that: 

(1) ammonia was readily accepted as a source of nitrogen to 
the exclusion of atmospheric nitrogen, (2) nitrate or nitrite 
nitrogen did not inhibit atmospheric fixation until converted 
to ammonia, (3) this required a period of adaptation in culture 
and it is suggested that the bacteria produce enzymes which 
convert the nitrate nitrogen to ammonia nitrogen. 

Combined nitrogen in the medium was shown by Burk 
et al . (12) to contribute to survival of the organism under 
adverse conditions. If the pH is low, for example ip* 0 * the 
organism uses the nitrogen in the medium for cell growth. 

Efficiency of nitrogen fixation was shown by Hills (lp3) 
to decrease upon adding available combined nitrogen. Numbers 
of azotobacter increased but amount of nitrogen fixed did 
not increase proportionately. 

Burk et al . (12) working with pur© cultures in solution 
found that: (1) concentrations of $0 p.p.m. combined nitrogen 
retarded nitrogen fixation, (2) the nitrogen composition of 
the dried cells remained at 2% regardless of the source of 
nitrogen. 

It would appear from the above review that the azoto¬ 
bacter are not unlike many other organisms in that they choose 
the line of least resistance in obtaining their food 0

Seasonal Effects 

Using laboratory cultures, Batchelor and Curie (6) 
noted a gain in nitrogen, then a loss and another gain, when 
cultures were analyzed periodically* They concluded that a 
single incubation period does not give a true picture* Using 
silica-gel plates, Vandecaveye (8l) made periodic counts of 
azotobacter on field samples for seven years. He found: 

(l) a marked seasonal fluctuation, and (2) a gradual disappear¬ 
ance of the organism from some soils. Roberts and Olson (70) 
noted seasonal effects on numbers and nitrogen fixing powers 0 
Bortels (8) stated that immediate weather conditions, such 
as barometric pressure, moisture, temperature and light, in¬ 
fluenced nitrogen fixation. He claimed that the higher 
pressures cause the formation of condensation products which 
inhibit nitrogen fixation. 

Temperature and humidity have been indicated as being 
important to azotobacter growth. Ashby (3) in his early work, 
noted that: (l) nitrogen fixers are confined to the upper 
few inches of soil in humid regions, (2) they are quite active 
to a depth of 3-4 feet in arid soils. Aeration and temperature 
effects are probably responsible for these differences. 

Burgess (11) working with desert soils of Arizona found 
that: (1) aerobic nitrogen fixation is active below moisture 

contents optimum for plants, (2) it is especially rapid upon 
alternate wetting and drying of the soil, (3) favorable tempera¬ 
ture to the microflara was 30-4-0°C*

Energy Relationships 

A large number of energy materials may be utilized 
by the azotobacter, but they vary markedly in their ability 
to promote the nitrogen fixing process* 

Fedorov (23) found that additions of straw in the 
presence of 0 * 5 $ calcium carbonate: ( 1 ) decreased yields in 
the first year, ( 2 ) increased yields in the second year by 
273%, ( 3 ) increased yields in the third year by 1L\0%, and 
the nitrogen balance was not lower in the third year than 
it was in the control* He concludes that straw induced 
nitrogen fixation rather than denitrification* 

Winters ( 90 ) found that manures were most valuable 
in promoting fixation* The soils used were low in pH, so 
that improved soil reactions possibly were partly responsible# 
Materials such as green manures and crop residues, 
Greaves (35>)* cellulose, Krishna (5l)* sugars. Smith (73) 9 
organic acids, Reuszer ( 69 ) and a host of other energy materials 
have been used to promote nitrogen fixation* Many of these 
are not practical under field conditions* 

Brown and Allison (10) found that the C:N ratios were 
of no value in indicating the effects of organic materials on 
the nitrogen fixing process* Martin e_t al* ( 60 ) found the 
activity of azotobacter in some Iowa soils to be closely de¬ 
pendent upon organic matter content, other factors being 
favorable# 

Winogradsky ( 89 ) concludes that the only nutrients 


available for the use of azotobacter in its natural soil

environment are the waste products of organic matter decomposi¬ 
tion, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, organic acids 
and alcohols* 

Association with Other Microorganisms 

The preceding review brings up the important question 
of the effects of other soil microorganisms on the azotobacter 
population* Many organisms break down organic matter and also 
use soil nutrients* It seems logical, then, that they would 
compete ;>rith the nitrogen fixers for available nutrients and 
energy material* 

Katznelson (lj-9) wondered about the small population 
or absence of azotobacter in some soils* By inoculating the 
organism into variously treated soils he found that: (1) there 
was an increase in number, only when a readily available source 
of energy was added, (2) under^favorable conditions, failure 
of azotobacter to increase was due to (a) unfavorable competi¬ 
tion with other microorganisms, (b) the presence of toxic 
substances, and (c) absence of nutrients such as phosphates* 

Vandecaveye and Villaneuva (8i|_), using soil cultures 
with available nitrogen present, noted that: (1) the fungi and 
bacteria were first to use the available organic material 
originally present or added, (2) activity of the azotobacter 
population became more intensive after the available supply 
of organic material was used up. Ihis indicated that the

nitrogen fixers used the by-products of other bacteria and fungi 
as energy, and agrees with Winogradsky’s ( 89 ) conclusions as 
noted earlier in this review. 

Lind and Wilson’s (5>2) results showed that azotobacter 
fixed more nitrogen when cultured with other microorganisms, 
than when in pure culture. Possible reasons suggested are: 

(1) liberation by the microorganisms of essential elements such 
as iron and molybdenum, (2) the production of superior sources 
of carbon, alcohols, fatty acids, etc., (3) assimilation of 
ammonia which, if present, retards nitrogen fixation. It is 
suggested that azotobacter supplies accessory growth factors 
to other organisms. 

Jensen (lj-7) showed that nitrogen fixation took place 
in cultures of azotobacter associated with cellulose decompos¬ 
ing organisms. This was not the case where actinomycetes were 
associated with azotobacter. The cellulose by-products apparent¬ 
ly serve as energy for the nitrogen fixers© 

Not all associations with other microorganisms are 
heneficial. Nickell and Burkholder ( 64 ) used a culture medium 
containing soil, fertilizers, and organic matter© They found 
by culturing azotobacter and actinomyces on this medium that: 

(1) there was inhibition of nitrogen fixation by azotobacter, 
due to substances produced by the actinomyces, (2) azotobacter 
numbers were reduced or the organisms completely disappeared©

roots has received some study in recent years* ^ince we are also 
studying virgin soils in this project, it would be desirable to 
review this subject briefly* 

Lochhead (56) found bacteria much more active physiologic¬ 
ally in the rhizosphere and suggested that roots may excrete biotin, 
thiamin, etc., which are beneficial* Allison (l) gives an excellent 
review of investigations carried out in Russia by inoculating azoto- 
bacter into the soil* Claims of larger crop yields have been re¬ 
ported, but most work since has not substantiated these claims* 

He concludes that: (l) there is no proof that azotobacter thrives 
in the rhizosphere, (2) there is no evidence that root excretions 
provide energy for much fixation, (3) where residues are present, 
energy must first be made available by other microorganisms that 
use considerable for their own activities* 

Allison (l) states that plant growth is not increased by 
azotobacter in the rhizosphere. He indicates the possibility 
£hat growth-promoting substances produced by azotobacter may be 
responsible for the increased yields that have been reported in 
Russia. 

Reuszer (68) says that nitrates are generally low in pasture 
soils but fluctuate in cultivated soils* This is apparently due to 
assimilation of nitrates by the plants and the loiter moisture con¬ 
ditions which reduce nitrification* 

Newton et al * (63) made extensive studies on nitrification 
under and after various grasses. They found that the nitrate content 
of grass and alfalfa plot soils was generally lower than that

of the wheat plots, especially in drier seasons® 

Hall ([j.2) found that South African virgin grassland 
soils never contained more than 3o0 p*p®m® of nitrate nitrogen 
at any time during the year. Eighteen days after plowing 
virgin soils, they contained as high as 0 p®p.m. of nitrate 
nitrogen. A low nitrate habitat should be favorable to nitrogen 
fixation, other factors being suitable. Reuszer (68) obtained 
no significant differences in total numbers of bacteria between 
virgin and cultivated soils using the plate count method of 
determination. 

Laboratory Studies 

Most studies on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen 
have been carried on in the laboratory® Naturally one must 
use caution in interpreting these results in terms of field 
conditions; nevertheless, these methods have an application 
in the study of nitrogen fixation. 

Turk (80) used soil cultures, solution cultures, agar 
and silica-gel plate methods for studying various soils, and 
the effects of plot treatments in the field. He founds (l) a 
correlation between soil treatments, when compared in solution 
and soil cultures, (2) that amounts fixed were of a different 
order, (3) that there was no correlation between numbers of 
colonies on plates and nitrogen fixation, ( 4 ) there was no 
relation between numbers of colonies produced on the two 
different types of plates® 

Greaves ( 36 ) noted: (1) that fixation was greater

where the culture medium was soil than where solution , 

(2) that there was no correlation of results between the two 
methods and different soil samples. Greaves and Pulley (lj.0) 
added a soil extract to the usual Ashby*s medium, fixation 
was always greater where soil extract was present, indicating 
some substance in the soil favoring growth of the organisms. 

Because liquid and agar media differ considerably from 
soil media, Madhok (57) developed a new one by adding a colloid. 
He claims that inorganic and organic colloids will carry the 
essential elements. Soil after sterilization was unsuitable, 
he says, as a culture medium. He used a mixture of sand 97*0$, 
bentonite 2.5$ and humus 0.5 percent. He also used sand alone, 
and sand 97*5$ plus bentonite 2.5 percent. The sand-bentonite 
mixture was found most suitable for most microbial processes. 
Prolonged sterilization of the sand-bentonite mixture caused 
reduced numbers and nitrogen fixation was lowered. Sand alone 
produced as high fixation as the other mixtures, but in these 
experiments the incubation time was 5 weeks, which may mask 
indications of rates of fixation. All of the above had nutri¬ 
ents added. 

Conn (l6) found that changes in the colloids of soils 
when air-dried made them unsuitable as culture media for about 
two weeks after being moistened. Conn, H.J., and Conn, J.E. (1?) 
searched for a synthetic medium to replace soil. They decided 
on a mixture of sand 9*5 gms., colloids 0.5 gms., glucose 1% 
plus water, in test tubes.

They obtained higher counts in this mixture than in 
soil, and nitrogen fixation was also higher in the mixture© 
Sterilizing for more than an hour caused lower counts in the 
sand-bentonite mixture* 

Curie (18) compared a few laboratory methods for study¬ 
ing nitrogen fixation and pointed out their limitations as 
follows: 

(1) Soil tumbler method: This was unsuitable because of 
low amounts fixed and available methods are not suitable for 
measuring small amounts of nitrogen© 

(2) Solution methods: (a) aerobic conditions are found 
only at the surface; (b) butyric acid is frequently found, which 
limits azotobacter growth© 

(3) Plate method: (a) there is variation in moisture content 
on the surface of plates, (b) silica-gel plates are hard to 
prepare* He did find that numbers of colonies growing on 
nitrogen-free plates were a function of the nitrogen fixed 

per plate* 

Gainey (28) presents data showing that when soil is 
inoculated onto agar plates: (1) the rate of nitrogen fixation 
is proportional to the number of colonies, (2) the quantity of 
nitrogen fixed (with ample incubation) is independent of the 
number of colonies of azotobacter growing© 

Hunter (45) bubbled sterile air through the culture 
media© He found: (1) that fixation was speeded up by aeration, 
(2) also that calcium carbonate was not essential to pure cultures 
undergoing vigorous aeration, (3) a close correlation between

dextrose consumed and nitrogen fixed® 

Waksman and Starkey (86) reported Lipman's work, 
which showed that azotobacter uses mannite more efficiently 
when in smaller concentrations* This indicates that nitrogen 
fixation should be highly efficient under field conditions* 
Turk's (80) results show that the rate of fixation is a function 
of number of organisms, but quantity fixed is ultimately 
dependent on available energy, excluding variations due to 
differences in microflora, toxic effects, etc® 

Greaves (33) said that quantities of nitrogen fixed in 
culture medium vary with the’number of organisms inoculated 
into it* 

Anaerobic Nitrogen Fixation 

The reader will have noted that the aerobic nitrogen¬ 
fixing process was stressed above* It has not been intended 
to suggest that the aerobic process is all important to the 
exclusion of the anaerobic one* Many workers have considered 
the anaerobic nitrogen-fixing process as the more important 
of the two in the soils which they studied® 

As noted earlier Winogradsky isolated Clostridium 
pastorianum , one of the organisms of the Clostridium genus 
which fix atmospheric nitrogen anaerobically® Waksman (85) 
in reviewing Winogradsky's work, shows that anaerobic nitrogen 
fixing organisms have similar basic requirements to azotobacter. 
These are: (1) presence of suitable energy, (2) a source of 
atmospheric nitrogen* They are both limited in fixation by

combined nitrogen, and presence of calcium carbonate favors 
their growth* The Clostridium pastorianum has an optimum pH 
range of 6*9-7»3 but is active at pH 5*7« The organism has 
been reported from soils all over the world* Rather interesting 
and possibly significant is the fact that the Clostridia are 
obligate anaerobes, but will survive under certain conditions 
where aerobic bacteria are present* For this reason, a symbiotic 
association of azotobacter and Clostridia in the soil has been 
suggested by Lind and Wilson (52)* The azotobacter, using 
oxygen, tend to produce anaerobic conditions for the Clostridia, 
which by their growth would produce organic acids, etc., as 
energy for the azotobacter* 

In laboratory studies with Michigan soils, Turk (80) 
concluded that the anaerobic nitrogen-fixing process was more 
important than the aerobic one. He reached this conclusion 
because the anaerobic organisms were more widespread in Michigan 
soils* Azotobacter when present, however, fixed more nitrogen 
than the anaerobic clostridia. Burgess (ll) using irrigated 
arid soils, found in the laboratory that the Clostridia were 
present and quite active. He obtained fixation of from l*ij-i].*3 
milligrams of nitrogen per gram of mannite consumed* 

It is evident from the above that the anaerobic organisms 
can be important contributors of soil nitrogen where present 
and active in the soil* The aerobic type of fixation has been 
stressed in this review, because conditions were made more suit¬ 
able for aerobic growth in the project reported here*

It is evident that little if any work has been carried 
out on the non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing process as applied 
to Canadian prairie soils. Claims for nitrogen fixation as 
reported in this review, must always be tempered by a considera¬ 
tion of the methods used and existing soil conditions. 

Laboratory methods do, however, provide a means of 
showing the presence or absence of the organisms responsible, 
and the relative activity of the nitrogen fixing flora found 
in different soils. 

OUTLINE OP INVESTIGATION 


The present work was undertaken to determine the 
distribution and activity of the non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing 
bacteria in some soils of the Saskatchewan grassland region. 

It was considered that laboratory controlled experiments would 
indicate the relative activity of the microflora thus showing 
how these organisms have adapted themselves to the soils of this 
region. Since the characteristics of the soil habitat may 
influence the microflora present, some chemical analyses were 
carried out on each soil in order to relate these to the 
nitrogen-fixing activities found. 

It is considered advisable to briefly describe the 
region from which samples were taken for this project.

Description of Region 

As mentioned earlier, the grassland region of Saskat¬ 
chewan was selected for this preliminary study* The brown, 
dark brown and black soil zones comprise the main portion of 
this region. The grassland formation extends from the south¬ 
west corner of the province to the edge of the forest or 
wooded region to the north and north east* 

Vegetation 

The region is divided into the short-grass prairie, 
the mixed prairie and the aspen-grove or parkland area. These 
divisions of vegetation correspond to broad variations in 
climate and soil moisture efficiency. They are also related 
to the major soil zones* 

Climate 

The natural vegetation and soil weathering processes 
have been affected by climate. The climate changes from a 
semi-arid condition in the southwest to a sub-humid climate in 
the northerly and easterly sections of the grassland region. 
Precipitation varies from 11 inches per year in the southwest 
to 18 inches in some areas of the black soil zone. Some parts 
of the more humid sections do not have much more precipitation 
than the southerly regions but, the evaporation rate being less, 
more efficient use can be made of the moisture present. The 
Cypress Hills area in the southwest, because of its altitude. 


has a higher precipitation than the surrounding prairie, making 
the vegetation comparable to the sub-humid section of the province

Soil Zones 

The brown soil zone in the southwest comprises the 
short-grass and part of the mixed prairie region* The dry 
climate of this area is reflected in the sparser vegetation. 

In the dark broiwn soil zone, slightly better moisture conditions 
prevail, '■This area comprises most of the mixed prairie type 
of vegetation. In the black soil zone, better moisture condi¬ 
tions are reflected in a heavier vegetation. This zone corres¬ 
ponds to the parkland vegetation region. 

There is a general increase in nitrogen, and organic 
matter of these soils as one moves in a northerly and north¬ 
easterly direction. Reactions of the well-drained soils range 
from about pE 6.0 - pH 8 o 0. The different zones also vary in 
their fertilizer requirements where moisture is not such a 
sharply limiting factor. 

Further information concerning the soils and agricultural 
practices in this region may be obtained from Mitchell e_fc al . (62) 
or the excellent ”Guide to Farm Practice in Saskatchewan. n 

Plan of Sxperiment 

The initial investigation was started in the summer of 
19 ^ 4 - 7 ^ and soil samples were obtained from three areas close to 
Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Soil from plots which had been 
seeded down to Crested Wheat Grass for six years and adjacent 
virgin and cultivated soils were sampled. Composite samples 
were from the 0-6 u layer, taken with sterilized equipment. 

These soils were air-dried in the laboratory and precautions

taken to prevent contamination. 

The above soils were inoculated into suitable nitrogen 
free media in the laboratory, using replicates and sterilized 
controls. Total nitrogen was determined after incubation of 
such cultures. Soils were inoculated onto nitrogen free agar 
media in further studies. Solution cultures were examined for 
films, odors and pH values. Microscopic examination was made 
to determine presence of azotobacter cells and by inoculation 
onto suitable agar media. 

In September 1947 * some 68 soil samples were taken 
from the grassland region of Saskatchewan for nitrogen-fixation 
studies in the laboratory. Considerable experimental work 
was carried out to determine the most suitable methods for cul¬ 
turing these soils in the laboratory. 

Work reported in this thesis on the above samples 
represents only the experiments conducted during the winter 
of 1950-51 when forty of the soil samples were studied. 
Locations 1-17 represent virgin and the adjacent eultivated 
soil from the three soil zones 9 Different soil textures and 
soil associations were represented. Location 18 represents 
virgin soil samples from the Cypress Hills. One sample is from 
the Lodgepole area and one from the golf course plain. Four 
soil samples were taken from a special area of the Indian Head 
Forest Nursery station. Difficulty had been experienced in 
obtaining stands of seedling trees in some parts of this area. 
Examination of these soils in the laboratory had revealed a

high content of nitrate where growth had been most seriously 
affected. 

For the major portion of this project, white quartz 
sand was used as a base for culturing the soil inoculum. It 
was considered that sand would furnish aerobic conditions and 
facilitate distribution of the soil inoculum throughout the 
culture medium. 

Some of the soils were inoculated into nitrogen-free 
solution cultures for comparison with the soil cultures, using 
various concentrations of sugar. 

Activities of both nitrogen-fixing bacteria and other 
bacterial flora were studied in a few soil and sand cultures. 
This phase of study was carried out on a limited scale merely 
to compare conditions prevailing in artificial cultures and 
■under natural soil conditions. Attempts were made to count 
numbers of azotobacter from the different cultures and, failing 
this, to at least determine if viable cells were present. 


MATERIALS AND METHODS 


Sampling 

In all locations samples were taken at a depth of 
0-6 inches* Previously sterilized quart jars were used for 
collecting the samples. Each sample represents a composite 
of four samplings from the immediate area. It was not possible 
at all times to use freshly sterilized tools (trowels) and in

these cases the tools were washed, then thoroughly scoured with 
the soil being sampled, before each sample was taken* 

The above sealed samples were air-dried in sterilized 
pans in the greenhouse at the Soil Research Laboratory, Swift 
Current. Care was taken to prevent contamination between soils 
or from other sources. Samples were then returned to their 
original jars. 

Grinding was accomplished in a hand grinder, steamed 
and dried between samples. Smaller samples were ground finely by 
mortar and pestle, sterilized between samples with %% mercuric 
chloride® It is realized that perfectly aseptic conditions 
are difficult to maintain because of air contamination, but 
every precaution was taken to keep this at a minimum* All 
samples were tightly sealed and stored for future use. 

Sand Cultures 

Thoroughly washed, white sand, obtained from Ottawa, 
Illinois, was used in the main project, as a base for the cul¬ 
ture medium. Fifty grams of the sand, in 300 ml. erlenmeyer 
flasks, stoppered with cotton, were used. Flask and contents 
were autoclaved at l£ pounds steam pressure for thirty minutes. 

Each flask of sand was inoculated with 0.1 gram of soil 
and well distributed by gentle agitation. Freshly sterilized 
spatulas and weighing dishes were used between samples. By 
aseptic technique, 10 ml. of a sterile nitrogen-free solution 
was added to each flask. 


Samples from one location, a virgin and a cultivated soil.

were set up in each case and incubated together* Twenty flasks 
were used for each soil, permitting four separate inoculation 
periods of 7> 1-4-> 28 and i^9 days* There were therefore five 
cultures for each incubation time, and two of these were immedi¬ 
ately sterilized to be used as controls* An culture flasks 
were incubated in closed cupboards where the temperature range 
was from 23-2&°C* during the experiment* 

Flask weights were checked at intervals and it was 
found that there was a loss of about four grams by evaporation, 
after four weeks 1 incubation. Consequently all flasks were 
brought up to their original weights by adding sterile distilled 
water* 

The solution medium used in the sand cultures is that 
described by Fred and Waksman (2£), modified to contain the 
following constituents: 

Mannite C 5 H 3 (OH )5 -- 20*0 grams 

Magnesium sulfate MgSO[j_* 7 H 20 ---- 0*2 11 

Dipotassium phosphate K 2 HP 0 [j_ -— 0*2 n 

Sodium chloride NaCl ---- 0*2 ” 

Calcium sulfate CaS 0 [|_ 2 H 20 -------- o*l 11 

Calcium carbonate CaC 03 --- 5*0 11 

Distilled water ---- 1000*0 n 

As 10 milliliters of the above solution were inoculated 
into each sand culture, 0*2 grams of mannite would be present 
in each flask*

Solution Cultures 

A. Virgin, Crested Wheat Grass and Cultivated Soils 

In this experiment, 100 ml* of the nitrogen-free 
solution described on the preceding page was sterilized in 
each cotton-stoppered 500 ml. erlenmeyer flask. Four of these 
flasks were inoculated with 5 grams of each soil by aseptic 
methods. Two of the flasks were then sterilized by adding 20 
ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. All flasks were incubated at 
30 °C. for 28 days and contents then transferred to Kjeldahl flasks 
for the nitrogen determination. 

B. Soils from Locations 1 to 1? and Indian Head 

A few of the soils used in the sand culture experiment 
were inoculated into solution cultures. The mannite content of 
the solution was adjusted so that 0.2 grams was present in each 
100 milliliters of solution in 500 milliliter erlenmeyer flasks; 

0.1 grams of soil was inoculated into each flask by aseptic methods* 
Replication and incubation were the same as with the sand cul¬ 
tures. Nitrogen determinations were made after suitable incuba¬ 
tion. 

Because of the low nitrogen fixation found in the above 
experiment, further work was begun using 50 milliliters of solu¬ 
tion containing 0.2 grams of mannite or a 0*ij.$ concentration. A 
few of the soils were also inoculated into culture solution con¬ 
taining 1 gram of mannite or 2.0$ and flasks incubated for five 
weeks* 

After 3 weeks’ incubation there was no indication of 
nitrogen fixation in the flasks containing 0*2 grams mannite. It

was considered that the mannite concentration was too low and 
this was increased so that flasks now contained 1 gram or a 2.0/& 
concentration. Flasks were incubated a further two weeks and 
contents of all transferred to Kjeldahl flasks for the nitrogen 
det ermination• 

Bacteriological Examination 

Attempts were made to determine numbers of azotobacter 
or at least isolate them, on nitrogen free agar. The above 
solution plus 1.5$ agar was used as agar media. 

Counts of total bacteria other than nitrogen fixing organ¬ 
isms were made from the various cultures, using sodium caseinate 
agar as described by Fred and Waksman (25)* 

In some cases, typical azotobacter colonies did not grow 
on the N-free agar plates. Solution cultures, which had been set 
up for all soils, were examined by microscopic methods for presence 
of the organism and agar streaks were made. 

Analytical Methods 

Total nitrogen was determined by the modified Gunning- 
Hibbard method, A.O.A.C. (65) making use of selenium as a 
catalyst. Sulfuric acid C.P. was used in the digestion and 
distilled water in the distillation to reduce errors from nitro¬ 
gen impurities. The boric acid method of Scales and Harrison (71) 
was used for the recovery of ammonia in distillation. Boric 
acid i\.% was used in the distillation and titrations made with 
N/50 sulfuric acid. For the nitrogen determinations on the 
original samples, N/lij. sulfuric acid was used. 


Total carbon determinations were made by the rapid

RESULTS 


In these experiments, a small amount of soil was inoculated 
into a medium containing other essentials for growth of nitrogen 
fixing bacteria* The soil would supply any trace elements necess¬ 
ary, but mainly it can only be considered as an inoculum contain¬ 
ing the soil microflorao The nitrogen fixing ability of such an 
inoculum when placed under suitable conditions for growth, should 
reflect the suitability of such soil as a habitat for the nitroge- 
fixing microorganisms* 

In Tables I and II some laboratory analyses of the 
original soils used in this project are presented* It is not a 
complete analysis, but covers a few soil constituents and prop¬ 
erties shown by previous workers to effect the nitrogen-fixing 
microflora of the soil* 

Soils from locations 1-17 in -fable I show a pH range of 
6»0-8*2 with an average of 7*3 for virgin soil and 7*6 for 
cultivated soils* The majority of these soils fall well within 
the range of pH 6*5-8 *6 given by Fred and Davenport (2 14 .) as 
optimum for aerobic nitrogen fixing bacteria* Easily soluble 
phosphorus is present in all soils as shown by the method used 
for analysis, with little difference in the average content for 
virgin and cultivated soils* 

The carbon content is about 23$ higher on the average 
for the virgin than for the cultivated soils* A similar differ¬ 
ence exists with nitrogen content, which averages 28$ higher

The average results of analyses for each zone are 
shown at the bottom of Table I* Not enough soils, however, 
are represented in each zone to make significant comparisons 
possible* These results indicate greatest nitrogen and carbon 
losses by cultivation in soils of the dark brown zone* Brown ( 9 )

three zones show that the greatest darbon and nitrogen changes 
by cultivation took place in the black zone* 

Carbon-nitrogen ratios are lower generally than those 
reported by Brown ( 9 ) and by Mitchell et al* (62) for soils 
of this region* Differences in analytical methods used would 
likely account for this discrepancy* 

Table II contains similar analytical data on soils 
from location 18 and four soils from the Indian Head Forest 
Nursery Station. Location 18 was in the Cypress Hills Park, 
one virgin soil being sampled in the lodgepole pine area and 
the other was from the golf course plain. The more humid con¬ 
ditions of this region are reflected in the lower pH, 5*0 and 
5o6, of these soils. The easily soluble phosphorus content 
is quite Ioxnt in these soils. The carbon and nitrogen contents 
of these soils are relatively higher than those of most soils 
sampled for this investigation. 

The cultivated soils of the Forest Nursery Station are 
listed as (a), (b), (c) and (d) in Table II. Some differences

are noted in the pH; soil (c) is better drained and has a 
more favorable reaction than the others. Soil (a) has the 
poorest drainage of this sampling area. The nitrate nitrogen 
content is quite high (353 p.p.m.) as compared to soils (b), 

(c) and (d)<> Soil (a) also has the most acid reaction (pH 5*8) 
of this area. Difficulty had been experienced in obtaining 
seedling stands in the immediate area from which soil (a) 
was sampled. In earlier analyses at the Soil Research Labors.- 
tory, Swift Current, the author had found soils of this particular 
location to contain 800 p.p.m. of nitrate nitrogen® 

Table III contains results of the initial studies made 
at Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Soil samples were from three 
locations where virgin, crested wheat grass, and cultivated 
soils were sampled. After incubating in tumblers for two 
weeks with and without 2.0% mannite at optimum moisture, 5 
grams of each soil \vere inoculated into sterile solution cul¬ 
tures. The 100 ml* of solution in 500 ml. erlenmeyer flasks 
contained 2.0 grams of mannite (2 o 0 % concentration). After 
incubation for 28 days and analysis for nitrogen, there are 
no consistent differences in amount of nitrogen fixed between 
virgin, crested wheat grass and cultivated soils from the 
three locations. More nitrogen was fixed in cultures by 
inoculating soils previously incubated with mannite.

In Table IV results are presented for sand culture 
experiments conducted during the winter of 195 > 0 - 5 l on soils 
from Locations 1-17* Sand was used as a base in order to 
supply aerobic conditions somextfhat similar to those obtain¬ 
ing in the field* 

Triplicate results are given in order to show the 
degree of variation evident between cultures* Lach figure 
represents the amount of nitrogen fixed per flask after deduct 
ing the amount present in the sterilized controls. Results 
are reasonably consistent considering that figures represent 
a measurement of biological activities* 

The greatest variation between replicates exists where 
there has been lower fixation and some of this variation must 
be attributed to experimental error* 

The amounts of nitrogen fixed vary from 0*0 to 11*5 
milligrams per gram of mannite. In most cases there was no 
significant increase in nitrogen fixed after four weeks incuba 
tion* As shown by average figures at the bottom of Table IV, 
cultivated soils showed a slightly higher rate of nitrogen 
fixation in cultures and the final amount fixed in seven weeks 
is also a little higher, but these differences may not be 
significant®

Table V contains results of sand culture studies on 
soils from Location 18 in Cypress Hills Park and soils from 
the Indian Head Nursery Station* The two soils from location 
18 fixed very little nitrogen in sand cultures up to seven 
weeks of incubation. Amounts shown would likely be within 
the experimental error of the method, since losses of nitrogen 
are recorded in some of the replicates* 

Very little nitrogen fixation took place in sand 
cultures inoculated with soil (a)* Soils (b), (c) and (d) 
fixed about the same amount of nitrogen after seven weeks 
incubation* In all soils but (d) there was a higher fixation 
after seven weeks than after four weeks incubation* The 
total amount fixed is approximately the same as the average 
recorded for soils of locations 1-17 to Table IV*

Results of inoculating some of the soils, used in experi 
ments reported above, into solution cultures are given in Table 
VI. As with sand cultures 0*1 grams of soil were inoculated 
into each 5>00 ml. flask containing 100 ml# of sterile nitrogen- 
free mannite solution# Each flask contained 0#2 grams as did 
sand culture flasks. Very little fixation took place in such 
cultures after incubating up to seven weeks. No characteristic 
films or odors were noticeable in any of the flasks after seven 
weeks. 

An experiment was begun later using ml* of sterile 
nitrogen-free mannite solution in 300 ml. flasks. The same 
amount of soil (0.1 grams) was inoculated into each flask which 
contained 0.2 grams of mannite at a concentration of 0.1| percent 
It was intended to keep the amount in each flask the same but 
to double the concentration. Similar flasks, but containing 
1 gram of mannite or 2.0$ concentration, were also inoculated 
with a few of the same soils. 

Flasks containing 0.1].$ concentration of mannite failed 
to shoxsigns of nitrogen fixation by film formation or odors 
after 3 weeks. It was concluded that no fixation was taking 
place 0 Mannite was then added to bring the concentration up to 
2.0$ and flasks were incubated a further two weeks.

Results in Table VII, with the exception of the Leduc 
soil, are calculated on the basis of 1 gram of mannite being 
present per flask* Direct comparison can only be made by 
assuming that there was no appreciable fixation for 3 weeks 
while only 0 m l±% concentration was present* The two series can 
then be compared on the basis of the amount fixed for 2 weeks 
and 5 weeks with 2*0% mannite present* 

It can be seen that amounts fixed per gram of mannite 
were lower in the solution cultures than in the sand cultures 
inoculated with the same soils* It was noted that where 2*0% 
mannite was present, film and odors were present in flasks 
after 2 weeks incubation* 

The Leduc soil used for comparative purposes, fixed 
more nitrogen than the other soils used in solution cultures* 
More nitrogen was fixed per gram of mannite in flasks having a 
concentration of 0*4$> mannite than in flasks with 2*0%> mannite 
incubated for the same time*

. The activity of bacterial microflora other than that 

of nitrogen-fixing bacteria was studied briefly in this project. 
Table VIII compares the amount of nitrogen fixed in sand 
cultures after four and seven weeks with total numbers of 
bacteria in similar cultures and in natural soil incubated 
at optimum moisture# 

There was very little increase in nitrogen fixation 
in sand cultures after four weeks incubation. In similar 
cultures of the same soils, it was found that the numbers 
of bacteria that would grow on sodium caseinate agar were 
less at ? weeks in all cases but one than at I 4 . weeks# The 
numbers of bacteria in sand cultures were higher generally 
than in natural soils incubated for the same length of time# 
Differences are not consistent, however# 

Plate counts to determine total numbers of bacteria 
were made on a few soils that had shown differences in 
nitrogen fixation in cultures# Results of such counts are 
shown in Table IX® The soils had previously been incubated 
in tumblers with 2#0% mannite for four weeks# Attempts were 
also made to count numbers of azotobacter on nitrogen free 
agar, from the various cultures. Results obtained were not 
considered reproducible and were not recorded. It was, however, 
possible to isolate azotobacter from cultures of all soils 
except two from location 18# It will be recalled that these 
soils had reactions of pH 5*0 and 5*6®

discussion 


The analytical data recorded in Table I would indicate 
that conditions prevailing in most of the soils studied here are 
suitable for a nitrogen fixing microflora. The presence of easily 
soluble phosphorus and the suitable reaction (pH on the 
average) would favor nitrogen fixing activity if the organisms 
are present,. 

It would be difficult to say how much mf any of the easily 
soluble phosphorus recorded here is available to the microflora 
of these soils. Methods used by different workers for determin¬ 
ing easily soluble phosphorus vary considerably. Ziemiecka (91) 
found nitrogen fixing organisms inactive where soluble phosphorus 
content was below 10 parts per million. The limiting concentra¬ 
tions given by various workers vary considerably. The main 
difference between the virgin and cultivated soils is in the carton and 
nitrogen content. These elements are lower in the cultivated 
than In the virgin soils. 

Tn Table III no significant differences were noted 
between amounts of nitrogen fixed in solution cultures inoculated 
with crested wheat grass, virgin and cultivated soils. However, 
soils previously Incubated with 2 9 0 % mannite fixed more nitro¬ 
gen than soils incubated in their natural state before being 
inoculated Into solution cultures. This would indicate that 
a larger population of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms was 
present in such soils. It was possible to isolate azotobacter

from all cultures and there was film formation. After 28 days 
incubation the pH was down to 6*0 in most cultures indicating 
anaerobic bacterial activity also* It is difficult to say how 
much fixation in solution cultures is by anaerobic and how much 
by aerobic microorganisms* 

Soils from locations 1-17 fixed different amounts of 
nitrogen in sand cultures* It was not possible to relate amounts 
fixed to the composition of the original soils. Very little 
difference on the average is noted between the virgin and 
cultivated soils in fixation of nitrogen. A slightly higher rate 
and amount of fixation by cultivated is indicated, but probably 
could not be considered as significant* Viable azotobacter 
organisms were isolated from all the soils from locations 1-17* 

These results are not In agreement with results obtained 
by Martin (58) and by Greaves (36) &ho found that very few 
virgin soils studied contained azotobacter and fixation by such 
soils was much lower than by cultivated soils* Ho consistent 
relation between differences in fixation and easily soluble 
phosphorus, or pH, can be seen in these soils. However, in 
location 18 where the pH was and 5*6, azotobacter were 

absent and no fixation took place in solution or sand cultures* 

More nitrogen was fixed in sand cultures than in solu¬ 
tion cultures when inoculated with the same soil, even where the 
same concentration of mannite was present* Soils showing little 
fixation in sand cultures fixed even less in solution cultures® 

In Table V a high nitrate content (353 p®p*m.) in soil 
(a) appears to have been toxic to the nitrogen fixing flora of

the soil® There was little fixation by this soil in either sand 
or solution cultures. Tn nearby soils (b), (c) and (d) the 
nitrate content was low and there was a fair amount of fixation 
of nitrogen in sand cultures. Gainey (30) found that concentra¬ 
tions of nitrate much less than present in soil (a) were toxic 
to aerobic nitrogen fixing microorganisms. The fact that this 
concentration had been toxic to seedling trees, would substanti¬ 
ate this conclusion. It was possible to detect typical azoto- 
bacter cells by microscopic examination of cultures of this 
soil. 

It would appear from Table VII that concentration of 
mannite in solution cultures has an effect on nitrogen fixation 
by the Saskatchewan soils studied. The Leduc soil, on the 
other hand, must have a very active nitrogen fixing flora or 
species more suitable to such cultures. There was consider¬ 
ably more fixation in solution by this soil. More nitrogen was 
fixed per gram of mannite where the concentration was 0*4$ than 
where it was 2*0% in the solutions. This agrees with Waksman 
and Starkey (86), page 109* where they show that azotobacter fix 
more nitrogen per gram of mannite when lower concentrations are 
present® 

Sand culture conditions of this experiment would also 
appear to be suitable to bacterial activity other than non-sym- 
biotic nitrogen fixing organisms. Table VIII shows that larger 
numbers of bacteria were present in sand cultures generally, than 
in natural soil incubated for the same length of time at optimum 


moisture

Numbers of bacteria growing on sodium caseinate agar 
did not increase after l\. weeks in sand cultures nor was there 
an increase in nitrogen fixed. This would indicate a possible 
relation between nitrogen fixation activity and activity of 
other bacteria. Winogradsky ( 89 ) suggested that the nigrogen 
fixing microorganisms use only the by-products of other micro¬ 
bial activity for their energy. Such a relationship may obtain 
in these cultures. 

In sand cultures, it was noticed that very little 
nitrogen was fixed after four weeks’ incubation. This would 
indicate that most of the mannite had been used up at this 
time. The fact that differences in final amount fixed exist, 
suggests that the microflora of the various soils differ in 
efficiency and numbers. Such differences in microflora are 
likely to be a reflection of the suitability of the natural 
soil habitat for supporting the nitrogen fixing flora. 

Sand vs<» Solution Cultures 

Results from this investigation have indicated that 
sand cultures are more suitable than solution cultures for study¬ 
ing the nitrogen-fixing flora of the Saskatchewan grassland 
soils. Results between replicate flasks were more uniform in 
sand cultures than in solution cultures. Sand cultures were 
much easier to transfer and to handle generally. 

In general, the greater fixation in sand cultures where 
conditions are relatively aerobic would indicate that the aerobic 
forms of nitrogen fixers are more active in these soils than the 


anaerobic

The surface area exposed to the atmosphere in sand 
cultures is considerably higher than when solution cultures are 
used* 

It would be erroneous to conclude that all fixation in 
sand cultures is by aerobic microorganisms, without further 
investigation* Possibly a symbiotic relation existed as suggested 
by Winogradsky, and quoted by Lind and Wilson (52)* The anaerobic 
nitrogen fixers are able to grow because aerobic microorganisms 
make conditions somewhat anaerobic in parts of the culture* 

Measurement of nitrogen fixation after several different 
incubation periods would seem advisable in both sand and solution 
culture studies* In this way rate of fixation as well as total 
amount of fixation would be measured* In further studies it 
would also be advisable to measure the amount of energy consumed 
after different incubation periods, in order to better determine 
the efficiency of the nitrogen-fixing rorgahisms. of the soil* 

Practical considerations 

It is possible that nitrogen-fixing flora of natural soils 
may not react favorably when inoculated into artificial culture 
media* Considerable experimental work would be required to deter¬ 
mine how the various nitrogen fixing microorganisms respond to 
particular conditions of the experiment* 

It is extremely difficult to obtain evidence showing 
how much nitrogen is fixed in natural soils by the free-living 
nitrogen-fixing organisms* The evidence from these experiments

shows that the aerobic nitrogen-fixing bacteria are more important 
than the anaerobic form in soils of the grassland region of 
Saskatchewan. While it is not possible to state from these 
experiments just how much nitrogen is added to the soil each 
year under field conditions, one can say that such microflora 
are present and active under the conditions of this experiment* 

Any farm management practices which tend to favor the 
above conditions should increase the amount of nitrogen added 
to the soil by aerobic nitrogen fixing microorganisms.

SUMMJ&RY 


1* The nitrogen-fixing powers of virgin and cultivated soils 

from the grassland region of Saskatchewan have been investi¬ 
gated in the laboratory* 

2* Sand cultures were found to be more suitable than solution 
cultures for studying the nitrogen-fixing flora of these 
soils* 

3a The fact that aerobic conditions existing in sand cultures 
favored nitrogen fixation, indicates the importance of the 
aerobic non-symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organisms in these 
soils* 

Ip* Viable azotobacter were isolated from all but two soils* 

These were acid soils of pH 5*6 and 5*0* 

5>* Hate and amount of nitrogen fixed was similar in sand cultures 
inoculated with cultivated and virgin soils* 

6o Soil containing a high nitrate content (353 p*p*ma) fixed 

very little nitrogen in sand or solution cultures indicating 
a toxic effect on the nitrogen-fixing flora* 

7* Some soils appeared to be more efficient than others in 
utilization of the energy present in cultures*
