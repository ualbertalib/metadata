An abstract of 

A STUDY OF THE METHODS USED IN CANADIAN URBAN 
SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICIENCY OF 
ELEMENTARY TEACHERS EMPLOYED IN THESE SYSTEMS 

a thesis of 251 pages 

by 

Loran Nichols 

The purpose of this study was to provide factual information 
concerning the methods and techniques that are used in Canadian 
urban school systems for measuring the effectiveness of teachers. 

As a preparatory step in the development of improvements in the 
procedures for appraising the competency of teachers it seemed 
reasonable that a survey of present conditions in Canada with respect 
to evaluating teacher competency be made. A sound basis for 
strengthening teacher-appraisal methods should begin with a care¬ 
ful, critical analysis and interpretation of the current applica¬ 
tions in Canada of such methods. It was assumed that such an 
analysis would aid in clarifying our current needs and in suggesting 
additional, and possibly more profitable, lines of attack in the 
search for better measures of evaluating teachers and their work® 

The data for the study were gathered by means of a 
questionnaire which was divided into two parts. Part A gave a 
brief description of ten major methods of evaluating teacher com¬ 
petence. Respondents were requested to indicate which methods were 
“Most-Used”, “Second” and “Third” in extent of use in evaluating 
the efficiency of teachers.

questions that related to each of the ten major methods• Respondents 
were asked to answer the questions relating to the three methods 
they had indicated previously in Part A of the questionnaire* 

One hundred and eighty-five chief school administrators of 
urban school systems in Canada received questionnaires* These 
administrators represented all the urban school systems of Canada 
with populations larger than eight thousand* 

The resulting data were analyzed, producing two sets of 
findings, the general and the specific* The general findings con¬ 
tain information concerning the extent to which each of the ten 
major evaluative methods are employed in Canadian urban school 
systems* One hundred and twenty tables, placed in the appendix,

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM 


1. Development of the Problem 

The problem originated as a result of the writer’s interest 
in the subject of the evaluation of teacher efficiency. During the 
past twenty years the changes in the methods of evaluating teachers 
have been noted by the writer. He has also studied the reasons for 
these changes which have been analyzed in the writings of some of 
the educational authorities. The writer’s perusal of much of the 
recent educational literature on the subject of teacher efficiency 
was a major factor in the formulation of the problem. The develop- 
ment of the problem can be traced within the several pertinent 
discussions that follow® 

The Importance of Evaluation 

Moore and Walters^ have outlined three purposes that are 
served by an evaluation of the effectiveness of the personnel. 

These are: 

1, A reasonable community desire to reward effective 
employees and thereby retain their services as long 
as possible, 

2, A normal community desire to be rid of incompetents 
and those working at the lowest possible level of 
acceptable effort® 

3® A basis for the limits of the in-service training 
program that must be provided for all personnel*

With reference to evaluation in education, Maurice E. 

Troyer^ has stated that: 

The basic purpose of evaluation in education should be to 
help individuals understand and accept themselves for what 
they are—-their abilities, patterns of interests, emotional 
make-up and background preparations 3 and having done this, 
to set realistic goals for themselves and to accept rewards 
appropriate to these goals* 

Achieving these goals is not an easy task and is a good test 
of one's ability to make democracy work with some of the most 
difficult problems in human relations*- One of these problems which 
seems most frequently and persistently to plague educational 
administrators is that of judging the competence of the teacher* 

The purpose of appraising teacher effectiveness involves 
the supervisory aspects as well as the administrative aspects of 
the problem* The supervisory aspects of appraising or recognizing 
teaching efficiency are concerned especially with the evaluation of 
the supervisory program itself, or with the improvement of teaching* 
Many educators, Yeager^ among them, believe that this improvement 
can be accomplished through better measures adapted to an analysis of 
teachers 1 traits, teaching procedures, and desirable outcomes* 

Mot only can the evaluation of teacher competency strengthen 
the instructional program, but it can also serve as a desirable

administrative device. The administrative aspects of appraising 
teacher effectiveness are those having to do with selection, 
promotion, transfer, retirement or dismissal of the educational 
staff, the adjustments of salaries, the keeping of records, the 
appraisal of teaching as a part of the general operation of the 
school system, and similar purposes that pertain to the management 
and direction of the school system. 


The Need for Greater Emphasis on the Evaluation of Teaching 


While general impressions of teachers have long been in 
common use, it is the belief of some educators that abilities and 
accomplishments should be more specific.^ These educators claim 
that some definite type of evaluation should be established in 
order to judge the effectiveness of the teaching process.^ 

Patrick? claims that more emphasis on the evaluation of the work 
of the individual teacher would be beneficial to the total school 
program. The educational psychologists insist that there is little 
or no learning without some knowledge of progress, that interest 
and enthusiasm wane if there is no clear goal, and if there are not 
frequent estimates of progress toward that goal.

There is a need to carry further a thorough study of 
reporting upon the work of teachers, with attention 
directed toward a supervising program which de-emphasizes 
the inspectional implications of supervision and 
emphasizes self-evaluation and professional growth* 

A study9 in the schools of the North Central Association 

of Colleges and Secondary Schools indicated that while a majority 

of the teachers questioned desired a type of supervision which 

included personal constructive criticism, they felt that this was 

lacking* Teachers have frequently reported keen disappointment over 

the fact that no attempt is made by principals and supervisors to 

evaluate their work* Webber^"® reported a recent study by Shawinsky 

who found that 8 ? of 173 teachers he polled in graduate classes 

in summer session at the University of Connecticut expressed concern 

about the fact that no one ever visited their classes for the 

purpose of giving an evaluation of their work* These same teachers 

unanimously reported that they believed supervisors should visit 

classes for the purpose of evaluating instruction. It would seem 

that, if appropriate rapport has been established, teachers welcome 

evaluation by supervisory officers provided the evaluation is not 

superficial* 

Hugget and Stinnett‘S reported a study conducted by the 
Research Division of the National Education Association* Teacbsrs 
were asked to indicate their opinion concerning the advisability of

giving efficiency ratings to teachers* The replies are shown in 

Table I, page ?• Based on the replies to the questions it was 

established that a majority of the teachers favored a scheme in 

which each teacher was given a rating at least once a year* 

Most teachers desire to achieve that feeling of satisfaction 

that comes from knowing that they are making progress, are succeeding 

on the job, and are being rewarded for their successful efforts* 

Teachers need and want better, more frequent, more specific, 

cooperative evaluations of their work by respected professional 

leaders, so that they will have a sounder basis for determining 

their success as teachers and for achieving that feeling of 

12 

satisfaction accompanying a task recognized as well done* 


The Need for Improving the Evaluation of Teacher Effectiveness 


In spite of the progress that has been made in developing 
and administering acceptable plans of teacher evaluation, serious 
objections have been offered by both teachers and administrators* 
Aurand's list as recorded by Yeager^ gives an analysis of 
objections. These are: 

1. Lack of objectivity, due largely to presence of human 
judgment* 

2. Lack of provision for recognizing the compensating 
variables, such as time, personal factors, influence, 
and change. 

3. Lack of statistical accuracy. 

k» Lack of agreement in meaning of terms. 

5. Lack of evidence that traits usually considered in 
rating plans bear any significant relationship to 
teaching success. Most significant ones appear to be

intelligence, interest in teaching, knowledge of subject 
matter, and scholastic success. 

6. Lack of control over influencing environmental factors. 

7. Lack of support for scientific approach, especially those 
who believe that good teaching partakes more of the 
artistic than scientific. 

8. Lack of adaptability of rating results to purposes for 
which rating is imposed, including acceptance of 
teachers* results for purposes used. 

9. Objections based on mechanical features. 

10. Objections based on teacher reactions. 

Yeager 1 ^ also reported that Rast revealed thirty-four different 

types of objections expressed by school administrators who are 

using some form of rating. In general these objections centred 

around the validity of the process and the form in use, the 

mechanical features, use of terms, difficulty of administration or 

application of data, and reactions of teachers, school and community, 

resulting in low morale, rivalries and jealousies. 

Objections such as those just mentioned do not obscure the 

fact that the general principle of appraising and evaluating the 

work of teachers is universally accepted.^ That judgment of the 

quality of service of teachers is an inescapable responsibility 

there would seem to be no doubt.Some evaluation of the teaching 

process is present regardless of the degree of planning for it by 

the school administration. Without direction such evaluation may 

be based upon inadequate or incorrect information. Random, 

spontaneous evaluation is usually subjective and may become quite

arbitrary. Likes and dislikes, biases and prejudices, are likely to 
enter. Such evaluations may be wholly unreliable and may, therefore, 
become a liability rather than an asset. Hence, some educators say 
that, since we will have teacher evaluation whether or not all agree 
to it, we should direct that evaluation so that it may be an asset 
to the school program.^ 

Much harm has been done through the naive use of inadequate 
data-gathering devices.^ Many authorities have made reference to 
the impediments to and fallacies in evaluation of the individual 
teacher by a presumably "omniscient" and "superior" school official* *^ 
Shane and Yauch,2° in their Creative School Administration , stress 
the lack of consistency between this "superior" attitude and the 
cooperative group-leadership approach which creatively-minded 
administrators frequently attempt to develop. The authors2-*- state 
that: 


It is a travesty on intellectual honesty to insist, on 
the one hand, that the leader is anxious to have teachers 
cooperate in the formulation of group policies, and, on 
the other, to make arbitrary, subjective judgments of 
their work. The former implies respect for the individual 
and his ability, the latter is redolent of distrust. 

If this inconsistency, expressed above, exists, intelligent teachers 

can hardly be expected to assume responsibility in cooperative 

program improvement when the realities of a situation indicate that 

their competence must be rated on the basis of formal, fragmentary 

administrative opinion*

Teachers, perhaps above all other professional groups, are 
subject to constant subjective appraisals and ratings, which may, 
in large part, determine their effectiveness as teachers. Such 
appraisals based on general impressions, quite often a single 
impression, become the basis for selection, retention, promotion, 
transfer and even dismissal.22 jf subjective appraisal and rating 
as an approach to gauging teacher competency is lacking in soundness, 
more promising procedures must be found. 

Barr^ in his 191*8 summary of investigations in the field 
of teacher efficiency, offered little specific help with reference 
to methods that are "better than rating". Later, in 1952, Barr‘S, 
in reviewing the research necessary in a consideration of teacher 
efficiency, stated that: 

1. No one appears to have developed a satisfactory working 
plan or system that can be used by personnel officers 
who must make judgments about teacher effectiveness. 

2. Little has been done in evaluating the nonclassroom 
responsibility of the teacher--his activities as a friend 
and counselor of pupils, his activities as a member of a 
school staff, his activities as a member of a school 
community, and his activities as a member of the pro¬ 
fession. 

3. Very little has been done in differential measurement and 
prediction. Concern seems to have been chiefly with the 
general merit of teachers. Administrators often need 
teachers with special abilities. 

k» Teaching effectiveness generally has been treated apart 
from the situations giving rise to it. More needs to be 
known about the situational determiners of effective 
teaching. 

5* Much of the research on teacher effectiveness seems to 
proceed as if the qualities in question resided entirely

in the teacher 8 This may or may not be true. Teacher 
effectiveness may be essentially a relationship between 
teachers, pupils, and the other persons concerned with 
the educational undertaking, all affected by limiting 
and facilitating aspects of the immediatesituation. 

This review points to the necessity of increasing our efforts to 

improve evaluative methods. 

Efforts are being made to encourage a more general realiza¬ 
tion of the utility of evaluation and to improve evaluative methods. 
At each of the last three Canadian Education Association—University 
of Alberta Short Courses^ one study-group concentrated specifically 
on the question of evaluating teachers. The central topic of Quebec 
alJAffiche26 was appraising and reporting the work of teachers and 
pupils. 

As the problem of school support has become a public concern, 
because of an increased school population, teacher shortages, and 
inflationary conditions, public demands for improving the evaluation 
of teacher effectiveness have been increasing. ^7 Such demands have 
been reflected in legislation, and in expressions of such public 
bodies as survey commissions and citizens* committees. 

There is a notion among many people that the educators 
are laelding in appropriate action and that the public will have to 
take steps to rescue the schools from the influence of the educa¬ 
tors.^®

This critical attitude of the people should put educators on their 
mettle and cause them to examine their thinking, their basic 
commitments, their methods, and their programs for the evaluation 
of the services of teachers. 

Although there is a desire on the part of many citizens to pay 
the capable teacher more, they do not wish to pay the poor teacher 
more. In fact, the public wants the poor teacher eliminated from the 
system.^ They seem to think that this can be accomplished through 
better evaluation. The public claim that since poor ratings in 
themselves rarely bring about dismissals, disagreeable situations 
arise as a result of poor ratings. Many citizens believe that self- 
elimination of the unfit is a desirable goal to achieve, especially 
where public opinion and social pressure can be brought into 
action. 3® it is the opinion of many citizens that measures 
applied to determine incompetency which may lead to dismissal for 
cause are significant. The public believes that while justice 
must be done to the teacher at all times, it is of far greater 
importance that justice be done to the pupils and the public ^ 

Though methods and channels for use by teachers who feel that their 
talents are underestimated are rather common, the public is of the 
opinion that no one has devised an acceptable procedure by which 
weaknesses overlooked by administrators but known to colleagues 
can be included in an appraisal. In other words, many citizens

claim that the profession has been able to correct injustices and so 


to protect competent teachers but not to protect pupils from 
inferior teachers,^ 2 According to public opinion the situation 
calls for appraisal plans to be more fairly administered and more 
reliably determined® 


Merit Rating 


Closely related to the desire for improved evaluation of 
teacher efficiency is the increasing interest in higher salaries 
for superior teachers. People in school and community are talking 
about the need for more adequate remuneration for the better 
teachers, Beach-^ states that among school superintendents in 
Michigan there appears to be a growing conviction that we are 
fast approaching a time when teachers may be rated for purposes of 
salary increases. Certainly we are hearing about it, Vander Werf-^ 
claims that when merit systems are on the decrease, demands for 
them are increasing. 

Over the years the National Education Association Research 
Division^ analyzed salary schedules in school districts over 
30,000 in population. One hundred and fifty-one of these districts 
reported a superior-service maximum salary at some time during the 
19 years that ended with 1956-57.

In 1956-57, 25 cities of 30,000 population of those report¬ 
ing to the division, had superior-service maximums in their salary 
schedules* This means that 126 of the 151 districts had abandoned 
such a plan within the prededing two decades* 

Table II, page 15, indicates that merit schedules that 
include superior-service maximums are less prevalent in these 
leading cities now than they were 20 years ago, but there has been 
a slight increase since 1953* 

In 1956-57, the National Education Association looked for 
merit-schedule provisions in urban school districts of all sizes. 

Of the 2287 schedules examined only 6*9 per cent authorized higher 
maximum salaries for superior teachers. 

In both the 1955-56 and 1956-57 surveys it was found that 
about half of the districts that have these superior-service 
provisions do not use them. Considering information from all sizes 
of school districts in 1956-57, less than Ij. per cent were actually 
paying superior-service maximums, although 6.9 per cent authorized 
such salaries* The National Education Association concluded from 
these surveys that the discussion of merit schedules deals more with 
theory than actual practice* The National Education Association 
vigorously condemns plans which tie teachers 5 salaries to subjective 
ratings.^6

interest in merit salary programs, with 73 districts reporting success 
with merit plans. That there is considerable interest as reported 
by the Utah group is evident from the frequency of mention in the 
literature available, 

A survey-^ in Michigan completed in April 1956 indicates at 
least a hundred per cent increase in the number of school systems 
planning to introduce a merit factor in their salary schedules within 
a year or two. The survey revealed that thirty-six districts present¬ 
ly have some kind of merit rating. Another sixty-one districts,

according to superintendents 1 replies to the questionnaire, "definite- 
1y plan" to introduce merit rating. Still another fifty-four dis¬ 
tricts replied that they were studying, considering, or discussing 
merit rating. Translated into percentages, this means that 7*h5 per 
cent of Michigan 1 s school districts (excluding rural) presently 
have some form of merit rating; 12*6 per cent more plan to have it; 
another 11.18 per cent are studying it. 

It would seem that forceful agitation is continuing for the 
development of some kind of merit schedules for teachers to provide 
remuneration on the basis of the quality of service performed. This 
agitation, according to Davis-^ is most pronounced among lay groups, 
especially school boards. 

Beachr^ claims that during the next decade there will be 

increasing effort to place teachers under some merit rating plans. 

Many others agree with the theory of merit rating and may hope that 

some day the competence to put such a plan in operation will be 

acquired. Engleman^, for example, says: 

Certainly, if a system can be devised which does not 
violate sound principles of human relations, elevates the 
profession, and improves services to children, it should 
be seized upon. Educators have no interest in opposing 
any valid system of identifying quality performance. 

At present, however, such an evaluation does not exist, and 

it would be a questionable procedure to introduce merit rating of

teachers before the validity of the evaluating methods used in such 
ratings is demonstrated. Campbell and Flesher^ claim that although 
most school systems are not ready to administer a merit provision 
salary program, these school systems should be taking steps leading 
to such readiness. 

Engleman^ suggests that educators postpone further debate 
until they have studied the purposes that merit rating might or 
might not serve, together with the underlying assumptions and the 
mechanics proposed. Advocates of merit rating plans, according to 
Beach^, need to demonstrate mastery of the difficulties of measuring 
teacher competence before they seriously propose replacing present 
schedules. Beach^ claims that until this ability has been clearly 
demonstrated classroom teachers will resist, and if any such plan 
is introduced over their protests, it could result in a serious 
lowering of teacher morale* 

Vander Werf^ states that neither aggressive action against 
all proposals of merit rating nor a complete indifference to them 
would seem like mature approaches in discovering better methods of 
the evaluation of teacher competence. Vander Werf^ suggests that 
since some teachers are requesting merit increments if attainable 
maximums are conjoined, a much more defensible attitude is to accept

the necessity of a thorough s tudy of the possibilities in particular 
localities for specific school staffs. 

To enable educators more effectively to meet this responsi¬ 
bility, the National Education Association^ 8 calls for continued 
research to discover means of objective evaluation of teaching 
performance for the purpose of improving instruction. Davis^ 
states that since the merit salary would seem to be a professional 
matter, the profession should take the lead in vigorous scientific 
experimentation to get at the truth, to ascertain whether it is pay 
incentives or something else that tends to bring about maximum 
teaching effectiveness; to determine whether there are other factors 
which affect performance more significantly. The teaching profes¬ 
sion must continuously seek the better way, the better technique. 

The whole professional team should wholeheartedly undertake 
a study of all factors—including merit rating—that may 
result in improvement of instruction® 50 

Existing Problems in Merit Rating Proposals 


The problems presented by the proposals and counter-proposals 
in the merit-rating issue will be difficult to solve. Most 
businessmen regard promotion by merit as an essential part of a 
system of free enterprise; and, according to McNaughton^l, they may 
even go so far as to suggest that it is implicit in the concept of

democracy* Many businessmen claim that some school systems have 
successfully incorporated merit provisions into their salary pro¬ 
grams with the cooperation and support of the teachers* In such 
instances, state Campbell and Flesher^, maximum salaries seem to 
be substantially higher than those found in school systems with no 
merit provisions* According to Issacs^, the current "successful" 
merit rating plans are commonly found in small cities or suburbs 
with relatively homogeneous populations of high economic, social, 
and educational level* No large cities reported success, and small 
towns are not interested, presumably because they do not hold good 
teachers long enough. 

Teacher-union leaders discount the value of all merit 

rating plans, Megel^ statess 

There is the attempt to reinstate the misnamed and dis¬ 
credited merit-rating system of pay which currently is 
being used as a club over teacher unions to try to force 
them to abandon requests for higher single-salary schedules* 

Teachers in general tend to react strongly against merit 
rating. They justify their stand by referring to the inability of 
experts to produce a completely satisfactory rating scale and 
defensible procedure. They hold that initial selection should per¬ 
mit only highly qualified people to become teachers, that judgment 
of merit is at best a questionable procedure, and that merit ratings 
inevitably result in poor morale.

The long list of arguments about merit rating can be dis¬ 
tilled into what appear to be the three basic questions 

1. Can an instrument be devised that will measure the 
quality of teacher performance? 

2. What factors would it include? 

3. How and by whom should merit rating measures be 
administered? 

Much of our confusion and error on the issue of merit 
rating may have arisen because even though teaching has become in 
recent years more truly professional, the concept still persists, 
even within the profession, that teaching is a simple routine 
task* Engleman^ suggests that there is urgently needed a con¬ 
centrated program of education for the public generally* He 
believes that people need to be informed of the true professional 
character of the teacher’s work and the prodigious task imposed 
on those called upon to administer a merit system* Such education, 

tn 

states Engleman, is required despite the fact that laymen who cry 
loudest for merit ratings are often the most sincere in their de¬ 
sire to improve education and to help the good teacher. On the 
other hand, Engleman claims that there is the difficult problem of 
educating teachers everywhere so that they will insist that their 
colleagues rise to the level of high professional competence. If 
such an education could be accomplished, Engleman believes that 
merit rating would either fall into the limbo of obsolete practice, 
or would become a truly professional instrument which would improve 

teaching and dignify those who teach*

Laymen generally have little conception of the complexity of 
(a) providing adequate staff, (b) establishing valid procedures 0 
If learning is as complex as most psychologists seem to say it is, 
then teaching, too, is one of the most complicated of functions, 
and measuring it in more than a superficial manner becomes a task 
for people who know their business. 

In the Encyclopedia of Educational Research, after summariz¬ 
ing the research on the topic, A. S. Barr^S points out that: 

As noted in the beginning, we do not yet have an adequate 
definition of teaching efficiency and consequently no 
satisfactory means of measuring this variable * 

Assuming that effective teaching could be defined in operational 

terms, that adequate evidence (i.e., valid and reliable evidence) 

could be garnered, and that who is to evaluate it is satisfactorily 

clarified, another problem would still remain: which ’’recognition 

for merit” can be effectively used, how and in which amounts and 

combinations?^ As with the preceding steps, this too must be 

empirically demonstrated in the field. Essentially it requires a 

pragmatic study* 

Selecting criteria for an evaluation instrument is one of 
the most difficult tasks facing merit rating supporters. The great 
difficulty is illustrated by McCall 1 s^ attempt to find an objective 
and definitive basis for merit rating of teachers. In a state-wide

study, he attempted to find in teachers factors which would correlate 
with the amount of progress children made under their direction. His 
conclusion is revealing: 

All things considered, this research failed to find any 
system of measuring teacher merit which the writer is 
willing to recommend be adopted as a basis for paying 
the salaries of all teachers. 

McCall's study attempted to find relationships between pupil 
progress and such factors as amount of training, amount of experience, 
rating of principals, rating by peers, and the teacher's rating of 
himself. Even such factors as age, salary, sex, marital status, and 
race were investigated. In every case. Dr. McCall found the 
correlations so low as to be statistically insignificant. 

The findings presented above document the existence of a 
particularly "sharp-horned dilemma". Many educators readily agree 
to the importance of identifying both good and poor teachers and to 
the importance of recognizing merit in matters relating to pro¬ 
motions and even to salary increases. They also admit the neces¬ 
sity of protecting children from the incompetent. Yet no one to 
date has come forward with a completely feasible plan which will 
avoid the serious limitations in personal judgments as exercised 
by administrators.'' 

Existing problems in Measuring Teacher Efficiency 

For more than four decades vigorous attempts have been made 

to determine and apply with more objectivity measures of teaching 

62 

efficiency. The literature abounds with hundreds of studies and

descriptive reports of attempts to arrive at a reliable method of 
measuring teacher efficiency. This research in the field of 
measurement of teacher effectiveness has doubtless added much to our 
general understanding of desirable teacher abilities, traits, and 
competencies, but the professional researchers warn us that, as yet, 
no satisfactory means of identification or definition of teaching 
competencies has been devised. 1 *^ To date, then, it would seem that 
we are not at all sure of what we expect and require of teachers. 


Teaching is a very complex activity involving the use of 
many abilities, combined in ways not yet very well understood. 04 


There is the problem of discovering how these abilities function 
to produce the different levels of competency expected of teachers. 
The layman’s and the scientist’s questions regarding these abilities, 
as well as the questions of the practitioner and the theorist 
involve eventually the question of criteria of teacher effective¬ 
ness, for these criteria define what we are seeking to understand, 
predict and control. v Until they have been established we do not 
even know for what we are searching. Selecting the criteria for 
evaluation is probably the most difficult and the most important 
task in the development of the evaluation program.^ 0 

Investigators must first make a choice between a concern with 
conceptual formulations of criteria as against operational

definitions* Ryans 0 ^ stated that his committee had made an unfortun¬ 
ate choice when it decided to define teaching effectiveness in 
conceptual terms rather than in operational terms, A conclusion 
reached in the Ryans experiment was that there may be no conceptual 
framework which is equally suitable for describing good teaching 
under any system of values* 

Another difficulty encountered in using the ultimate 
criterion for evaluation of teaching effectiveness is centred in 
the fact that educational outcomes measurable in terms of pupil 
growth or behavior change cannot be attributed to a given teacher, 
since many outcomes are attributable to other elements in the 

s o 

pupil’s past and present school, home and community environment* 0 
Teaching takes place in a particular environment. 
Educationists state that it must be recognised that the environment 
becomes a factor in the activity* The nature and the extent of the 
effect the environment has on the teaching process have not yet 
been accurately determined. This represents an example of 
intangible factors that enter into the evaluation process.^9 if 
.just one intangible factor were involved in the process of apprais¬ 
ing the teacher’s effectiveness, the results would probably not be 
affected greatly. However, in one discussion of evaluation a list

of ten of these intangible factors is given* ^0 The factors listed 
range from the general mental ability of the pupils taught to the 
general quality of teaching the pupils may be receiving from other 
teachers during the same time span. Also involved are the inherent 
growth potentials of the individual pupils of the class. 

In discussing the question relating to the criterion of 
teaching efficiency Barr?-*- emphasizes several problems relevant to 
the criterion of pupil growth and achievement. There is the problem 
of determining what sorts of pupils* adults* and social order we 
desire. Deciding if the outcomes sought for different pupils* adults* 
and groups are sufficiently similar to expect a single criterion 
to prove adequate* or if we should expect many different criteria* 
presents another problem. There is also the difficulty in deter¬ 
mining whether or not educational goals can be more precisely 
defined in a manner to facilitate accurate measurement of outcomes. 

In relation to the criterion of teacher traits and qualities 
Barr stresses the importance of efforts to solve certain questions. 
There is need to ascertain what qualities characterize the good 
teacher. There is the problem of determining if we should expect 
these qualities to be the same for all teachers* pupils* and 
conditions. It has yet to be established that the several traits 
and qualities possess an internal consistency and cohesion such as to 
make their use in the measurement and evaluation of teaching efficiency 
feasible.

With regard to the criterion of teacher performance, Barr 
stipulates that it is necessary to determine if there are certain 
activities that characterize good teaching independent of purpose, 
persons, and conditions. If such activities exist, there is need 
to know if it is sufficient to indicate these by name or if they 
must be further characterized and defined. 

There exists the problem of determining what knowledges, 
special skills, attitudes, interests, and ideals characterize the 
good teacher. Consideration must also be given to the essential 
of assigning weights to derived criteria. It is necessary to 
determine the amount of agreement that can be expected among the 
several criteria. 

As ways for testing the validity of the various criteria 
become more adequate, a more exact definition of teaching will 
develop, Remmers72 states that such a definition will certainly 
pertain to that group of school activities which are meant to stimu- 
late pupil growth. 

Three approaches have been made to the evaluation of teach¬ 
ing efficiency. The first of these is evaluation arising from the 
study of pupil-community changes (results). Problems arising in 
this regard are concerned with the measurement of the less tangible 
outcomes of education, the evaluation of the growth and achievement 
of pupils of varying abilities working under different conditions, 
and the appraisal of contributions of various factors to pupil growth 
and achievement, including the teacher and the inter-relationships 
among all factors.

One writer has gone so far as to say that judging teaching 
by its product is unquestionably as valid a measure of pupil growth 
as can be developed. 73 Pupil testing having reached a high level of 
development, some very good tests of pupil achievement are available. 
Yet it must be recognized that certain differences continue to exist 
and that, when judging the quality of teaching by the achievement of 
the pupil, due allowances must be made for the extraneous factors 
that affect teaching. 7h Making proper allowance for these factors 
will always present a problem. 

The second approach is the evaluation arising from the study 
of qualities of the person (traits). This plan involves the process 
of adequately describing, measuring, and assessing the several traits 
and qualities ; and the relative contributions of the different traits 
and qualities*75 

The third approach is the evaluation arising from the study 
of teacher-pupil activities (performances), ordinarily divorced from 
results. In this case there is the problem of adequately assessing 
the skill with which acts are performed, and the relative contri¬ 
bution of various activities to efficiency.7° Considering acts in 
relation to goals and concrete aspects of the situation as well as 
principles is important in this approach to the evaluation of teach¬ 
ing efficiency.77

The American Education Research Association Committee agreed 
that effectiveness on the part of the teacher is reflected in 
effects on pupils, effects on school operation, and effects on 
school-community relations* Yet each of these has many facets 
which are difficult to evaluate.7° 

2. Definitions of Terms Used 

As the problem developed it became imperative that certain 
terms be defined. These definitions were necessary in order that a 
clear interpretation of the problem, the investigation, and the 
findings of the investigation could be made. The terms are defined 
below. 

Appraisal * Appraisal means to estimate worth (officially). In 
this study the connotations of the term involve both subjective 
and objective estimates* Appraisal is usually thought of in terms 
of specific phases, with instruments designed to appraise component 
parts. In this regard it may differ markedly from evaluation, which 
seeks to integrate and interpret various indices'of behavior into a 
pattern. 

Evaluation . Evaluation designates a comprehensive concept of the 

function under investigation* It presupposes a definition of goals 

to be attained. It judges the degree to which predetermined goals 

are attained in terms of standards. Evaluation includes attitudes,

interests, ideals, ways of thinking, work habits, and personal and 
social adaptability, in which determined values may depend to some 
extent on subjective methods of appraisal* Evaluation differs from 
appraisal in that the former is a more inclusive term, its values 


On 

have a wider range, and its findings are determined more objectively. cu 


Teacher Rating . Rating has been defined as an estimate made accord¬ 
ing to some systematized procedure, of the degree to which an 


individual or thing possesses any given trait or traits.^ In this 


study rating has the comotation of a procedure by means of which 
judgments are passed in terms of certain specifics by means of an 
instrument designed to measure traits or characteristics. It 
becomes a series of estimates arrived at quantitatively or quali¬ 
tatively, in terms of judgments placed upon a scale or other device. 

Merit Rating . Merit rating implies the use of rating for the purpose 
of determining degrees of worth. In this thesis, merit rating is 
limited to implying determination of worth for salary increments. 

Criterion. A criterion is a standard against which a measurement is 

ftp 

made in estimating the validity of the measurement* * A criterion 
is always concerned with one or more specified dimensions of what¬ 
ever is being measured. 

Effectiveness . Effectiveness is the degree to which an agent 
produces effects.

3. The Problem 


Statement of the Problem 

The purpose of this study was to provi.de factual information 
concerning the methods and techniques that are used in Canadian urban 
school systems for measuring the effectiveness of teachers. As a 
preparatory step in the development of improvements in the procedures 
for appraising the competency of teachers it seemed reasonable that 
a survey of present conditions in Canada with respect to evaluating 
teacher competency be made. A sound basis for strengthening teacher- 
appraisal methods should begin with a careful, critical analysis and 
interpretation of the current application in Canada of such methods. 
It was assumed that such an analysis would aid in clarifying our 
current needs and in suggesting additional, and possibly more 
profitable, lines of attack in the search for better measures of 
evaluating teachers and their work. 

The purpose of this study might be more clearly expressed 
by means of the following statements and questions: 

1. In this day of definite salary schedules, promotion policies 
and tenure provisions, it becomes desirable to identify teachers 
according to the quality of work being done # 1 3 

How is the appraisal of elementary teachers’ competency 
accomplished in urban school districts of Canada? 

2. The rating of teachers has been referred to as a persistent 
dilemma. For a number of years considerable contention has 
existed among teachers, school administrators, board members, and 

83

laymen concerning this perennial question.Even in cases where 
there has been an acceptance of teacher rating, there has continued 
to be considerable difference of opinion concerning the nature of 
the rating instrument and who should administer it.^ 

How prevalent are formal rating plans in Canadian city school 
systems? 

What is the nature of the various rating schemes in use in Canada? 

3. With the very recently accelerated trend toward uniform teacher 
salary schedules, based upon a much higher level of pay, the 
number of school administrative units employing teacher rating is 
likely to increase appreciably. A more adequate teacher supply 
would tend to accelerate the increase .^ 

There is the view that the existence of larger school systems 
today encourages school administrators to fall back on some type 
of rating device, since in many of these larger systems it is 
impossible for one administrative employee to know personally 
all of the teachers and to be familiar with the work of each. 

To what extent do administrators of large Canadian school 
systems use rating devices to evaluate teacher efficiency? 

1*. The superintendent who has permanently solved all problems of 
staff evaluation through the use of procedures that need no 
change is headed for a staff explosion. The reason is simple.

of development and revision, -with wide staff participation, has 
proved far more contributive to staff morale and to effective 
evaluation than any ’ideal* formula frozen into district policy 
for all time 

How prevalent is the idea among school administrators in Canada 
that evaluation policies need to be revised continually with the 
changing needs of society? 

5. A joint committee of the Ontario School Trustees’ Council and 
the Ontario Teachers' Federation reported on its study of the 
subject: ’’Merit Rating, Pay and Tenure of Teachers.This 
committee found it was impossible to secure any agreement on 
merit plans directly related to salary schedules. Accordingly, 
it was agreed to drop this approach and to consider the advisa¬ 
bility of instituting merit plans not related to salaries® In 
this area a wider measure of general agreement was reached 
culminating in the adoption of several recommendations relative 
to the appraising of teacher competency. 

To what extent do conditions embodied in the above-mentioned 
committee’s recommendations with respect to methods for apprais¬ 
ing teacher effectiveness hold at the present time in Canadian 
urban school systems? 

Do elementary teachers in Canada receive salary increases accord¬ 
ing to some kind of merit rating plan? 

6. Probably the most useful and valid evaluation of teachers is that 
given by students themselves. But not many teachers at the moment

are eager or overly willing to encourage student participation 
in the evaluation of teaching.^ 

What part do students take in current methods of evaluating 
teaching in elementary schools of Canada? 

7. Since the causal relationships between certain personal 

qualifications possessed by a teacher and the effectiveness of the 
teacher in the classroom have not been adequately determined, 
direct evaluation does have this definite weakness. Hence in¬ 
direct (tests on pupils) evaluation of teachers may have as 

90 

scientific a basis for teacher rating as does the direct plan. 

Perhaps the most effective use of indirect teacher rating 
should be in connection with, and as a check on, direct teacher 
appraisal. In cases where a positive correlation is lacking 
between pupil achievement and the appraisal scores of the teaching 
personnel, it may properly be assumed that there is a definite 
weakness in the teaching methods and in the instruments used in 
teacher-appraisal. 

It is difficult to determine the teachers 1 effects on 
objectively observed pupils 1 achievement. This difficulty is 
reflected in the relative scarcity of studies in which this 
criterion has been used. Of the 1006 items in the Domas- 
Tiedeman bibliography only 36 or 3.6 per cent were reports on 
the use of this difficult approach.^ Very little objective

evidence is available at present to support indirect rating ! s 
validity and its use has declined.^ This would indicate that 
the indirect rating of teachers should be approached with full 
information and caution. 

To what extent are elementary teachers in Canada evaluated for 
efficiency by the use of the indirect (pupil achievement) 
approach? 

8 0 One of the chief reasons for the absence of self-evaluative 

procedures in our schools is the appalling ignorance of 
teachers concerning construction of evaluative instruments, 
tests and measurement, theory of error, and statistics 
essential to handling data.93 

How extensive is the use of self-evaluative procedures in 

Canadian urban school systems? 

Importance of the Study 

It was expected that the study would provide basic informa¬ 
tion that would assist Canadian urban school administrators to: 

(1) compare the particular methods of evaluating teachers in one 
school system with the methods used in other urban school 
systems in Canada; 

(2) compare the trends in the processes of appraising teacher 
competency in Canada with the development of the particular 
procedures in any one school system; 

(3) reassess the efficiency and limitations of their methods in the 
light of the analysis of the data obtained in the study;

CHAPTER II 


RELATED STUDIES 

Having set the problem, the writer was advised to investigate 
the avaliable literature on the subject of the evaluation of teacher 
efficiency* It was thought that a perusal of the pertinent educa¬ 
tional material would reveal knowledge and information which would 
relate to the problem, and which would be of aid in the investigation 
of the problem* 

1. Studies Prior to 1950 

In 19li3 Reavis^* of the University of Chicago made a study 
of the plans used in city school systems in evaluating the merit of 
teachers* This investigator requested information from, four 
hundred and eighty-eight cities. Forms or instructions were 
received from one hundred and four cities in thirty states and the 
District of Columbia. In classifying the rating forms the 
investigator found that these devices presented a number of patterns. 

Furthermore, a small number of cities used methods other 
than ratings either to supplement evidence from rating or, in one 
case, to take the place of rating. The classification which was 
formulated is presented in Table III, page 37. In this classifi¬ 
cation, the designation “rating devices” was given to methods of 
evaluation wherein one person expressed a judgment about the

teacher without particular reference to supporting evidence other 
than his own observations• 

The forms of rating devices were classified under five 
headings* Most frequently rating judgments were sought by means of 
a "check scale” which listed for evaluation several attributes of 
the teacher and his work. A second type of rating device -which was 
designated the "guided-comment report” asked the rater to write 
out his comments on a number of leading questions or suggested 
topics. A third type of rating system, called a ”characterization 
report”, simply requested the rater to characterize his total 
impression of the teacher's merit with a single descriptive adjec¬ 
tive or letter (e.g.. A, B, C$ or "superior”, or "average”). 
Sometimes these characterization reports required the rater to 
justify his mark by explanatory statements but generally no ad¬ 
ditional statements were desired. Six schools made use of a 
"descriptive report” type of rating. Raters using this system 
were required to write a paragraph or two describing the merit of 
the teacher. One evaluation system was classified as depending on a 
"ranking report”• This type required the rater to list the teachers 
of a school in order of excellence, placing the best teacher at the 
top of the list and continuing until all teachers were included. 

The study by Reavis^ revealed that all but one of the one 
hundred and four city school systems relied on some form of rating 
system for part or all of its evaluations* 

Reavis tabulated the number of cities relying exclusively 
on each type of rating and those using certain combinations of

types. These findings are presented in Table IV, page 1*0. The 
combinations are combinations in the sense that different forms of 
rating are applied to different teachers, perhaps at different times. 

From the study of Tables III and IV it was evident that, 
although all cities but one made use of rating devices, several other 
types of evidence regarding teachers were also collected. Eleven 
types of special material used to supplement ratings were enumerated 
in Table III. No one city, however, made use of many of these sources 
of information about teachers. In fact, the data revealed that most 
of the supplementary materials were used very infrequently. The 
extent to which cities drew on more than one type of material Is 
shown in Table V, page 1*1. In the preparation of the table Reavis 
counted all kinds of ratings as a single type of information. Few 
cities based their evaluations of teachers on extensive collection 
of evidence. 

A report-^ of the Research Division of the National Education 
Association issued in 191*2 indicated that the use of teacher rating 
(one means of evaluation) as an administrative device seemed to be 
declining rather than growing. The data also showed that the pre¬ 
valence of rating tended to increase as the size of cities increased. 
This situation is shown in Table VI, page 1*2. "While forty per cent 
of all cities practiced rating in 191*0-1*1, sixty-seven per cent of 
the cities with populations of more than 100,000 and only thirty-five 
per cent of the cities with populations of 2,500 to 5*000 used rating 

shhemes of some kind.

hh 


In a survey of practices in ten southeastern states, 
McCartha^ found that only one hundred and seventy or 21.9 per cent 
of the seven hundred and seventy-eight administrative units that 
responded to his inquiry used formal evaluative plans at all. 

In a more detailed study of the one hundred and seventy 
units using evaluation devices, only twenty schools of the one 
hundred and eleven systems that supplied additional information 
used evaluation for purposes of salary adjustment; sixty-one systems 
used the reports as a basis for determining reappointment. Hence, 
it appears that less than five per cent of all school systems 
reporting used evaluation to determine salary level. 


2. Later Related Studies 


Moore and Walters^ reviewed the data gathered by the 
Research Division of the National Education Association 0 concerning 
practices in techniques for appraising teachers. Table VIII, page 
1*5, shows that in 1951-52 about forty-four per cent of the cities 
of the United States gave annual ratings to classroom teachers, and 
a like percentage gave no rating at all. The other cities rate only 
the probationary teachers, or teachers believed to be failing, or 
both. It was reported that there was a slight decrease.in the number

of cities giving ratings as compared with 1931, but a slight increase 
as compared with 19l[l. In cities of over 500,000 population the 
practice of teacher rating was more prevalent than in smaller cities. 

The most frequently used rating form was one on which several 
qualities are evaluated, but no composite, comparative score is shown. 
The trend toward the use of this type of rating form has been sub¬ 
stantial in the last ten years, according to Moore and Walters' 1 
review# In 19tl the use of a comparative scale in which several 
levels of efficiency were used was predominant. 

In 1951-52 less than half of the school systems made the 
ratings available to the teachers concerned. Since 19l|l there has 
been an increase in the number of systems making ratings available 
to the teachers concerned. 

One of the interesting facts dram from Table VIII, as 

Q 

noted by Moore and Walters, was that the use aspect was not as 
extensively reported as was the extent of rating. This was con¬ 
sistent with the belief of many authorities that rating plans in 
many situations have not been made functional. Tradition in many 
instances caused the continued use of certain rating plans, regard¬ 
less of the use to which they will be put. 

Associated with the above study was the National Education 
Association study on promotion procedures affecting classroom 
teachers. This study was reviewed by Moore and Walters^ as well 
as by Hugget and Stinnett.^ Table VIII shows that many uses are

made of teacher ratings. Sixty-four per cent of the cities giving 
ratings used them in deciding reappointmentsof teachers not on 
tenure; 61 per cent used them to decide what to do about a teacher 
whose success was in doubt; and $1 per cent used them in recommend¬ 
ing probationary teachers for tenure. Other uses were; selection 
for promotion; awarding regular increments in the salary schedule, 
awarding supermaximum salaries, and fixing the size of the salary 
increments. 

Moore and Walters-^ pointed out that although the study was 
inconclusive, it was found that only 16 per cent of the cities 
reporting used a systematic procedure, whereas Table VIII (page ii5) 
showed that 32 per cent of the cities reporting used the service 
rating in selecting teachers for promotion. It was the opinion of 
Moore and Walters that the inconclusiveness of the data in the 
National Education Association study further emphasized the import¬ 
ance of establishing policy and purpose where appraisal methods 
are involved. 

The informality of personnel procedures is revealed in 
Table VIII. In making selections among candidates for promotion, 

81; per cent of the reporting cities have no standard or formal 
procedure, according to Table VIII. Sixteen per cent of the cities 
follow a definite plan. The extent (62 per cent of the systems) 
to which teachers in service are given preference in promotions to 
higher paid positions is significant. The fact that in 21 per cent 
of the systems only those who voluntarily make their wants known in

respect to promotion are considered, prompted Moore and Walters^ 
to suggest that there was need for carefully developed personnel 
policy. 

In the fall of 1952 Shane^ completed a survey of 35 
elementary school districts in various parts of the United States, 
These districts were recognized for their good educational programs. 
The purppse of the survey was to ascertain procedures in appraising 
the efficiency of teachers. 

It was determined that each school made use of one or more 
evaluation procedures or techniques. On tabulation of the superin¬ 
tendents' responses it was learned that seven types of appraisal 
were most widely used. It also was evident from the number of 
responses (70) that at least two different means of appraisal, on 
the average, were utilized by each school system. 

Figure 1, page 50, suggests that, among the schools surveyed, 
a substantial minority made use of flexible teacher-evaluation 
procedures. For example, fifteen had no 'formal 1 rating plan. 

The respondents apparently considered group, self and verbal 
appraisals as 'informal' since a number who replied that they 
had 'no formal rating plan' also checked 'group 1 , 'self* or 'verbal' 
as plans in use. The superintendents of the schools surveyed 
indicated their lack of confidence in mechanical appraisal devices, 
such as rating scales. The majority also believed that merit rating

should not play a major part in determining the teacher’s salary. 
However* one-third of the superintendents indicated on the survey 
questionnaire that they used teachers’ ratings in part as a basis 
for salary increases. 

It was Shane’s opinion that in the United States as a 
whole self-appraisal and group appraisal approaches were the least 
common among the seven approaches that could be identified in the 
systems studied. In one of the ten schools using self-appraisal 
techniques* the teachers filled out evaluation forms for themselves. 
Teachers then discussed these personal analyses with the principal 
who reported the nature and outcome of the decisions to the super¬ 
intendent. The group evaluations were made in each individual 
school building* In all instances except one* printed forms for 
the evaluations were not used. 

Shane’s study revealed the fact that in 85 per cent of the 
schools the principal had complete or partial responsibility for 
appraisal. The principal was the official most frequently called 
upon to evaluate teachers. Fewer than 50 per cent of the super¬ 
intendents and 30 per cent of the supervisors made any kind of 
rating. 

Even though most of the administrators who were sampled felt 
that teachers should not be merit-rated tc determine their rate of 
progress up the salary schedule* 83 per cent of the superintendents 
were of the opinion that teachers should be dismissed when they 
were evaluated or rated and found tc be seriously deficient in 
ability or personality. This apparent paradox might be explained 
on the assumption that administrators feel that it is difficult to 
judge the degree of a capable teacher’s excellence but believe that

they can determine when a teacher is incompetent. Professor Shane 
considered this to be a common-sense attitude rather than an 
inconsistency. It was Shane’s opinion that it was absolutely 
necessary in the interests of children for the administrators to 
discharge persons who are ineffectual in the classroom. On the 
other hand, he noted that it was not necessary to establish degrees 
of excellence among capable teachers, 

When asked to indicate the frequency of visits to teachers 
for the purpose of appraising the nature and quality of their work, 
the superintendents surveyed indicated that from two to twenty 
observations of instruction each academic year were made in their 
systems. This was interpreted to mean that the range was from an 
average of two visits per teacher in one district to an average 
of twenty in the district which had the closest supervision. In 
the typical school in the sample of 35, the modal (most frequent) 
number of planned observations of each teacher’s work (as distinct 
from casual visits) was seven per year. This figure included 
visitations by all administrative personnel, 

Shane’s survey findings suggested that there was a whole¬ 
some desire to devise broad and imaginative means of appraising 
the quality of instruction. At the same time there was a clear’ 
recognition of the need to protect children from any incompetent 
teacher. The sustained lack of achievement by children as shown 
on standard tests was generally accepted by the superintendents 
questioned as a sufficient basis for discharging staff members not 


on tenure

It was Shane’s opinion that the retreat from arbitrary 

rating scales (used in less than 25 per cent of the districts) was 

sound, but that it was reasonable to conclude that no agreement had 

been reached as to a completely acceptable objective substitute 

for check lists or scales, Shane believed that: 

We must clarify our values regarding what constitutes 
good teaching and sharpen our knowledge of human behavior 
before an adequate approach can be made to the problem 
of how to evaluate teaching, 

3• Summary of Related Studies 

. 

In reviewing the related studies to the problem, of deter- 
mining the methods used to evaluate the competence of Canadian urban 
teachers, the writer considered the following points to be important. 

1, The Reavis^ study in 19U3 revealed that most city school systems 
in the United States relied on some form of rating system for 
part or all of its evaluations. The study also indicated that 
few cities based their evaluations of teachers on extensive 
collections of evidence, 

2, A report^ of the Research Division of the National Education 
Association in 19^2 indicated that the use of teacher rating 
(one means of evaluation) seemed to be declining, 

3, Shane 1 s'^ study in 1952 indicated a retreat from arbitrary 
rating scales. Less than 25 per cent of the districts surveyed 
used rating as an evaluative device.

iu The McCartha 1 ^ survey in 19U7 showed that one-fifth of school 
administrative units used formal evaluative plans* 

?. In 1950 the Research Division of the National Education Associa¬ 
tion 1 ^ reported that less than one-half of the cities of the 
United States gave annual ratings to teachers, and also that 
l*li per cent of the cities gave no rating* 

6. The Reavis 20 and the National Education Association report 21 
of 1951 indicated that the prevalence of rating tended to 
increase as the size of the cities increased. 

7. All related studies as reported in Chapter II seemed to 
emphasize the importance of establishing policy and purpose where 
appraisal methods are involved.

CHAPTER III 


THE PROCEDURE 

The procedural techniques used by the investigators of the 
related studies discussed in Chapter II were noted and assessed* 

It was agreed to proceed with the study of the problem by using a 
questionnaire as a data-gathering instrument,, 

1. The Construction of the Questionnaire 
Part A of the Questionnaire 1 

The related studies had indicated that school systems 
frequently use more than one method to appraise the effectiveness 
of elementary school teachers. Part A of the questionnaire was 
constructed in a manner that would enable each chief school 
administrator of urban Canada to indicate which methods were used 
most frequently in his particular school system* A compilation of 
the methods used in the particular school systems would give an 
over-all picture of the methods used most frequently in urban 
Canada as a whole* 

Part A of the questionnaire consisted of a brief descrip¬ 
tion of the ten methods of evaluating teacher competency* Each- 
description was numbered* The number eleven was provided in the 
event that some school system was using a method which was not 
included in the preceding descriptions* 

In a column adjacent to the numbered descriptions of the 
appraisal methods, three rectangular spaces were placed* The

instructions carried a request to each chief administrator of an 
urban school system in Canada that he write in the first space the 
number of the method which is "most used" in his system. In the 
second and third spaces provided the administrator was requested to 
place the numbers of the methods which rank second and third in 
extent of use in his school system. 

Part B of the Questionnaire 

part B of the questionnaire was composed of detailed 
questions concerning each method previously described in Part A 
of the questionnaire. In the main, these questions provided for a 
"Yes-No" type of response. 

The Order of the Methods in the Questionnaire 

It was first intended to place the methods in order of the 
degree of subjectivity involved in the use of each method. The 
procedure that required the greatest degree of subjective appraisal 
was to be placed first; and the method considered most objective 
was to be placed last* The problem of space and variation in the 
length and number of questions under each method altered this first 
intention. 

If the above-mentioned classification relative to the degree 
of subjectivity of the method had been followed, Self-Evaluation 
would have been placed near the Joint Evaluation Method in the 
questionnaire. In the final draft of the questionnaire, however, 
Self-Evaluation was placed as Method 2 of the questionnaire.

Formulation of the Methods and Questions for the .uestionnaire 

It was not the purpose of the study to ascertain and catalogue 

the advantages and disadvantages that the different methods of 

evaluating teachers might possess* The undertaking of such a purpose 

was considered outside the limits of this study* Hence the 

questionnaire was not formulated to determine administrators’ 

opinions concerning defects in the methods of appraising the 

effectiveness of teachers* 

According to Rose^ the formal methods of appraising 

teachers can be classified in three groups* The first of these is 

appraisal by ratings* Ratings can be subdivided into two forms— 

rating by direct comparison and rating through the use of scales. 

Method 1 of the questionnaire—Ranking Teachers—was derived 

through the study of rating bjr direct comparison. 

Method 3 * A Single Mark for Each Teacher* and Method k > 

Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of Teaching* were formed 

for the questionnaire after consideration and study of rating 

systems that employ the use of scales* 

The Almy-Sorenson rating scale for teachers (H* C* Alitor 

and Herbert Sorenson* Bloomington* Illinois. Public School 

Publishing Company, 1930) as described by Chandler^ is an example 

of an objective type of rating instrument. In this instrument the 

teacher is the centre of focus for the rating. Some of the other

rating plans bring the teacher-environment into the plan more 
prominently. 

A variation from the type of the Almy-Sorenson rating 
scale is exemplified in an instrument devised by Higgins^. Several 
writers indicated that this instrument is objective and provides a 
scale of ratings for each factor. This scale is representative 
of those that focus attention more directly upon the total-teacher¬ 
learning situation rather than solely upon the teacher. 

Another rating instrument studied was the Morris Trait 
Index L., described by Chandler^. This instrument represents an 
indirect approach in that the teacher is asked to react to certain 
statements, and the rating is derived from his checked reaction. 

The instrument attempts to rate teachers in accordance with areas 
of indicated strengths and weaknesses. 

The second group of methods used to evaluate teachers is 
the “statements'* group. This group has two divisions—Comments 
and Specific Statements. Comments may be the unguided, free form, 
essay type or the guided, structured, precategorized type in which 
the areas of comment are specified. 

Specific statements which are checked by the appraiser as 
being true or untrue are of two forms. These are the Forced-Choice 
and the Yes-No simple response method.

The questions asked in Method 5 of the questionnaire. 
Statements about Each Teacher, were formed to determine the use by- 
Canadian urban school systems of features included in both the 
Comments and Specific Statements divisions of the Statemehts Method. 

The third group of methods for appraising the efficiency 
of teachers is classified under the term. Performance Records. 

There are three subdivisions of this group. These divisions are 
known as Anecdotal Records, Rating Records, and Continuous, Complete 
Records. The last-mentioned type of record involves the coding of 
observed behavior. 

The Anecdotal Record methods may follow the guided or the 
unguided type of procedure. In the guided type the items are 
predetermined and within these the observer writes descriptions of 
behavior as he sees it. A well-known example of this type of 
method is The Ohio Teaching Record. ^ It includes eight sections 
containing fifty-eight observation guide items. Beecher’s Teaching 
Evaluation Record*^ is a recent example of the Rating Record type 
of Performance Records. Beecher’s Record contains a predetermined 
list of behavioral items that the observer looks for and rates as 
occurring consistently or seldom, and involving most of the pupils 
in the total pattern of teaching which he is observing. Questions 
appearing under Method 9 of the questionnaire were patterned on the 
above two examples*

The classification of types of items on which a person 
can be rated by a scale method as described above is a general 
differentiation which can be used with other methods of appraisal. 

It makes clear the place of focus of the appraisal; the person, 
his performance, or the results. In practice, many appraisal 
methods combine or mix up these elements. The Cumulative Person¬ 
nel Record system, often developed in large schools or districts, 
is a combination of such elements which the local group has 
decided are important. Method 7 of the questionnaire. Judgments 
Based on Cumulative Professional Record of the Teacher, combines 
features of Scale Ratings with those of Performance Records. 

The questions included in Method 6 of the questionnaire 
were formed after studying descriptions of procedures followed in 
appraising teachers by means of an Evaluation Board. The plan 
outlined in Better Than Rating ® and the plan described by Koopman^ 
proved valuable in the construction of Method 6 of the question¬ 
naire. Koopman suggested that the merit of the teacher be deter¬ 
mined by a Board composed of both his peers and of administrative 
personnel, selected cooperatively by the teacher and the adminis¬ 
trator. Decisions concerning what constitutes merit, according to 
Koopman, would be determined by the reviewing Board. 

Preparatory to the formation of questions pertaining to 
questionnaire Method 2 and Method 8, which relate to self-evaluation

and joint evaluation, the descriptions of various instruments were 
studied. Chandler^ described the Purdue Teachers* Examination: 

How I Teach, This inventory was developed by I, B, Kelley and J. K, 
Perkins, In this instrument the teacher and the pupil are both 
considered, 

WeberU concluded that the greatest value of The National 
Teacher Examinations was likely to be to the individual teacher 
in self-appraisal of basic understandings of the job to be done. 
Schooner and Horrocks-^ gave a description of a self¬ 
appraisal questionnaire for teachers-in-service. The instrument 
provides the teacher with an analysis of himself in seven areas. 

The Cincinnati instrument as described by Fosdick-^ has 
met the teachers* complaints of self-evaluation. The teacher 
checks only those qualities and skills which he considers his 
strongest points, and those which he considers his weakest and on 
which he would like help. 

Chandler^ outlined the use of one of the most satisfactory 
of the self-evaluation forms now in use* It was contained in 
Evaluation Criteria, published by the American Council on Education 
in 1950.

A study of the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory developed 
by W. W. Cook, C. H. Leeds, and Robert Callis and described by 
Weberwould indicate that the instrument has been very useful in 
cooperative efforts at evaluation of teaching services. The 
inventory was developed for the purpose of measuring teacher-pupil 
rapport• 

Most self and joint evaluation plans have been devised 
using the idea that the basic purpose of appraisal is the improve¬ 
ment of the individual. These plans are actually more supervisory 
than administrative in nature. Questions relating to the Self and 
Joint Evaluation Methods of the questionnaire. Method 2 and Method 8 , 
were formed after careful consideration and study of the various 
plans and the ideas involved in the development of these plans* 

The majority of writers in recent discussions concerning 
the problem of evaluating the services of teachers have stressed 
the importance of the democratic participation of the staff in 
solving the problems of the school. It is claimed that wide parti¬ 
cipation and group action will result eventually in better coopera¬ 
tion, better understanding, and more growth on the part of the 

teacher.16 

In this cooperative approach the evaluation of the individual 
teacher becomes a part of a larger plan for evaluation which may 
include the whole educational program. Under such a plan it is 

^Weber, op* cit. , p. 113*

difficult to justify the evaluation of any teacher on the basis of 

his individual characteristics considered ajjart from the larger 

17 

tasks to be accomplished* ' Proponents of the cooperative plan 
claim that where evaluation is accepted as a mutual problem of 
all concerned, benefits comparable to those under a rating plan 
may be realized, and at the same time much self-improvement may be 
experienced by the teachers. 

A consideration of the above philosophy aided the formation 
of the questions contained in Method 10 of the questionnaire. 

2. Distribut io n of the Questionnaire 

On November 27, 1957* a total of one hundred and eighty-five 
questionnaires were sent to the chief administrators of all urban 
school systems in Canadian cities with populations larger than 8000. 
Fifty of these questionnaires, printed in the French language, were 
sent to the urban school centres of the province of Quebec* Forty 
questionnaires were sent to officials of school systems in cities 
with populations larger than fifty thousand. One hundred and nine 
questionnaires were sent tc cities with populations between ten 
thousand and fifty thousand.* Thirty-six were sent to smaller 
Canadian urban centres with populations between eight and ten 
thousand. 

Populations of Canadian cities used in this study were based 

l8 

on the 19?1 Census as recorded in the Canada Tear Book, 1955. ~~

A letter printed in both the English and French languages, and 

written by Dr. H. T. Coutts, Dean of the Faculty of Education, 

University of Alberta, explained the nature and the importance of 

19 

the study. A copy of this letter ^ was enclosed with each question¬ 
naire that was sent. An addressed envelope for making returns was 
also enclosed with each questionnaire. 

Names and addresses of chief school administrators were 
obtained from the Directory of Administrative Officials in 
Education.Questionnaires were sent to these officials. The 
remaining questionnaires were addressed to the Superintendent, 
the Inspector, or the Director of Studies of the school system in 
the particular province concerned. 

3. Questionnaire Returns 

Ninety-eight replies to the questionna?lres were received by 
January 3? 1958. On January 6, 1958, eighty-three follow-up letters 
were mailed to the administrators who had not replied to the question¬ 
naire. Six questionnaires were mailed to officials who, in replying 
to the follow-up letters, indicated that they had not received a 
questionnaire. Twenty-five replies were received after the follow¬ 
up letters had been sent, increasing the returns to a total of one 
hundred and twenty-three. Two questionnaire replies were received 
in March, 1958. These arrived too late to be included in the analysis.

Table IX, page 65, includes a percentage distribution of 
the returns. Sixty-seven per cent of the questionnaires were 
returned. Seventy-five per cent of the large school systems in 
Canada replied to the questionnaire. Returns were received from 
sixty-five per cent of the school systems in centres with popula¬ 
tions between ten thousand and fifty thousand. Sixty-one per cent 
of the school systems in the smaller cities of populations between 
eight thousand and ten thousand replied to the questionnaire* 

Twenty-two letters concerning the survey were received. 

Some of these explained the administrator’s reasons for not 
replying to the questionnaire or for giving partial answers. A 
large majority of the letters expressed the administrator’s 
interest in the study and his desire to receive a copy of the 
summary report. 

Twenty-seven of the officials of the city school systems 
returning questionnaires enclosed copies of appraisal and evaluation 
forms used in their systems to assess the competency of teachers. 
These forms constituted a vital instrument in obtaining information 
which supplemented the data gathered through the medium of the 
questionnaire. 

A large number of the returns contained comments and explana¬ 
tions. These were invaluable to the investigator. An analysis of 
the comments and explanations of the respondents increased the 
validity of the methods and techniques used to appraise the question¬ 
naire data in picturing the effectiveness of teachers and teaching 
in the urban elementary schools of Canada. Comments on the question¬ 
naires are recorded in Appendix F.

By the same token a lack of wide acceptance may not 
condemn a practice as being unsound*♦•It is usually 
safe, however, to assume that any practice having a 
wide usage must have some feature to commend it* 

By this reasoning. Method 5 of the questionnaire (Quali¬ 
tative Statements About Each Teacher), which is used more than any 
other method in Canadian urban school centres, can be considered to 
contain some commendable features in its plan for appraising the 
efficiency of teachers and their work* On the other hand. Methods 
1 and 2 (Ranking and Self-Evaluation) should not be considered 
unsound in practice simply because they are used to a small extent 
in Canadian urban school districts* (See Figures 2, 3* ii and 0.) 

Method k (Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of 
Teaching) is second to Method 0 in extent of use in Canadian cities* 
(See Table X, Appendix E.) Method k leads all procedures as a 
"Second" method in extent of use in urban areas of Canada* This 
is shown in Table XI, Appendix E, and in Figure 2, page 68. 

Method 7 on the questionnaire (Judgments Based on the 
Cumulative Professional Record of the Teacher) is used more than 
any other procedure as a "Third" method in extent of use by Canadian 
urban school administrators. (See Table XII, Appendix E, and 
Figure 2, page 68.) 

Two per cent of the respondents did not record a reply to 
a request that they indicate a "Most-Used" Method. Eleven per 
cent of the respondents failed to denote a "Second" method in 
extent of use. Twenty-six per cent of the respondents recorded no 
"Third" method* This information is shown in Figure 2, page 68, 
and Tables X, XI and XII, Appendix E. The writer assumed that these 
respective percentages of omissions represent the urban school 
administrators who do not employ a "Most-Used" or a "Second" or a

"Third" method for measuring the competency of their teachers. 

After having indicated their first three methods in extent 
of use in the rectangles provided on the questionnaire, twenty-seven 
respondents partially answered questions on methods other than 
their first three. This is assumed to be an indication that 
features of several methods are employed in the localities of the 
above-mentioned twenty-seven respondents for appraising teacher 
efficiency. Questions in Methods 7 and 10 were answered by eleven 
of these twenty-seven administrators. Methods 1 and 3 were answered 
partially by ten of the twenty-seven respondents concerned. Method 2 
was answered partially by four of these respondents; and Methods 1*, 

5, 8 and 9 were each answered partially by two of the twenty-seven 
school districts concerned. 

The writer®s interpretation of these partially answered 
methods is that Methods 1, 3s 7 and 10 would rank high among the 
ten methods on the questionnaire as a "Fourth" method in extent of 
use. The questionnaire did not request respondents to indicate a 
"Fourth” method. 

2. Summary of General Findings from the Questionnaire 

The following list indicates the extent of use by Canadian 
urban school systems of the questionnaire methods which are employed 
as a "Most-Used”, "Second", or "Third" procedure for evaluating 
the competence of teachers. (See Figure 2, page 68.) 

50 systems or 1*0 per cent use Method 5 as a "Most-Used" method. 

27 systems or 22 per cent use Method ^ as a "Most-Used" method. 

11 systems or 9 per cent use Method 3 as a "Most-Used" method.

Thus, speaking in general terms, it is clear that Method 5 
is the most commonly used procedure, with Method k ranking next. 
Methods 3* 7 and 9 follow with approximately equal frequencies# 


3# Specific Findings Related to Ten Major 
Methods of Evaluating Teacher Competence 


Ranking 

In only Ij. per cent of the school districts in Canada is 
ranking employed as a "Most-Used" method# Four Quebec centres with 
populations between 10,000 and 50,000 and one Ontario centre 
reported the use of ranking as the "Most-Used" method. (Table XVI, 
Appendix E.) Ranking is used less frequently as a "Second" method- 
in 2 per cent of Canadian centres. As a iB, Third" method, ranking 
is carried on in 5 per cent of Canadian urban centres replying to 
the questionnaire. (Figure 2, page 68.) Little formal ranking is 
done in districts where the population is under 10,000 since the 
number of teachers in any one centre of such a district is usually 
small. (Figure 5, page 71.)

It is seen from Table XXII, Appendix E, that a few negative 
answers have been given to Question a. Method 1 of the question¬ 
naire,^ although the respondents use ranking as a method. The 
reason for this is that there are variations in the procedure of 
the ranking process, and as a result, not all ranking falls within 
the scope of the "all-round teaching effectiveness” of the question. 

It should be noted that in Table XXII, the total replies to 
the question exceed the total replies designating the method of 
ranking as a '‘Most-Used”, or as a "Second”, or as a "Third” 
method. (Tables X, XI and XII in Appendix E.) The explanation 
lies in the fact that all answers were tabulated and that many 
respondents answered questions on methods other than the three 
they had indicated in the rectangles as being their "Most-Used”, 
"Second", or "Third” methods. This same "discrepancy” in totals 
occurs in many of the tables that follow, and for the same reason 
given above. 

In 50 per cent of the cases (Table XXV, Appendix E), the 
Provincial Inspector is the official who does the ranking. This 
is understandable when it is noted that three-questers of the rank¬ 
ing is done in centres where the population does not warrant the 
appointment of a local superintendent. 

In all large urban centres where ranking of teachers is 
carried on, the official doing the ranking is required to submit 
individual reports on all teachers. (Table XXVI, Appendix E). 

This is not the case in districts with populations between 10,000

and ^0,000 where slightly more than half of the districts required 
reports to be submitted on all teachers• 

It is not often that a teacher 1 s salary is affected by 
ranking. (Table XXVIII, Appendix E.) The comments of the respondents 
(See Appendix F) point to rare occasions when salary increments are 
withheld or when teachers are dismissed* The "Yes" answers in 
Table XXVIII refer to the possibility that a teacher's salary could 
be affected by "adverse" ranking. 

Approximately S>0 per cent of urban centres make the ranking 
lists known to teachers. (Table XXIX, Appendix E.) 

Se If -Evaluati on 

Of all the rating, appraisal, and evaluative techniques 
employed to measure the competence of teachers in urban centres of 
Canada, the self-evaluation method is used least often. (Figure 2, 
page 68.) None of the school systems surveyed employs self- 
evaluation as a "Most-Used" method. Four per cent of the districts 
in Canada use it as a "Second" method.(Table XI, Appendix E.) 
Self-evaluation has its greatest use in centres of population 
10,000 to 50,000 where it is used as a "Third" method in 8 per cent 
of the centres of this size. (Figure k, page 70.) 

The comments of the respondents (See Appendix F) indicate 
that, in centres where self-evaluation is carried on, the procedure 
consists of supplying various self-evaluation charts and rating 
scales to the teachers who may use them in a manner of their own 
choosing and on a voluntary basis. It was stated that this pro¬ 
cedure serves as an incentive to teachers to improve themselves.

The method is also considered a means of placing emphasis on teaching 
environment, attitude, and procedures. 

In centres where a self-evaluation scale is used the number 
of points on the scale varies from five to two hundred® 

Well over 50 per cent of the systems using self-evaluation 
encouraged the teachers to answer questions comprising the lists of 
traits without actually rating themselves® Two-thirds of these 
school centres use self-evaluation forms in conjunction with some 
kind of in-service program® 

Seventy-one per cent of the districts using self-evaluation 
employ forms that describe or characterize desirable practice. 

This is significant. A Commission on Teacher Evaluation^ states 
that much of the improvement factor is lost in cases where desirable 
practice is not described® 

Single Mark for each Teacher 

The Single-Mark-for-Each-Teacher method is a "Most-Used" 
procedure in 9 per cent of the urban centres of Canada. (See 
Figure 2, page 68, and Table X, Appendix E.) Its use as a "Second” 
or "Third" method takes place in no more than k per cent of the 
school systems in urban Canada (Tables XI and XIX* Appendix E.) 
large urban centres employ the Single-Mark method to a very small 
extent. Only 3 per cent of the centres with populations over 50,000 
use the method in appraising teacher efficiency. (Table XIII, 
Appendix E.) Eight centres in Quebec and four in Ontario make use 
of the Single-Mark method*

In more than 50 per cent of the centres where the Single¬ 


mark method is employed the Provincial Inspector gives the mark. 
(Table XXXVI, Appendix E.) The Superintendent or Director of 
Studies gives the mark in 23 per cent of the cases, these being in 
the larger centres between 10,000 and 50,000 population. 

Approximately half of the centres employing the Single-mark 
method use a scale in the rating process. The number of points on 
the scale most frequently used is five. 

The Commission on Teacher Evaluation^ stated that the 
validity of the Single-mark method is increased if the percentage 
of teachers who may be placed in each category is not fixed or 
prescribed, and if the rater is required to submit evidence or give 
reasons why he regards the teacher’s work as of a certain quality. 

In reference to these two factors the replies to questions (f) 
and (g) in Method 3 of the questionnaire gave a 91 per cent negative 
answer to the former question and a 7ii per cent affirmative reply 
to the latter. (Tables XXXVIII, XXXIX, Appendix E.) 

The bases for rating the teacher are defined in the plan in 
60 per cent of the centres using the Single-mark method. Nearly 
80 per cent of these places require the rater to submit a special 
report for any teacher rated as unsatisfactory. 

When teachers are marked unsatisfactory 50 per cent of the 
school organizations using the Single-mark method either place or 
continue the teacher on probation and single her out for special 
help. In 19 per cent of the cases a teacher marked unsatisfactoiy

will be transferred* In approximately 14 per cent of the cases an 
unsatisfactory teacher will be denied salary increments or 
dismissed. (Table XLII, Appendix E.) 

More than 50 per cent of the respondents to the Single-mark 
method indicated that the rating is a factor in considering a teacher 
for promotion* 

Although 60 per cent of the replies Stated that the teacher 
is informed of the mark she is assigned, the comments indicated 
that this information is given informally and only in general terms 
in discussion with the teacher. It is also in discussion in 
conference with the teacher following inspection that the teacher 
is given an opportunity to defend or justify her work with superiors. 
This opportunity is given in 93 per cent of the centres employing 
the Single-mark method. (Table XLV, Appendix E.) 

There was a 100 per cent affirmative answer to the question: 
Do teachers have an opportunity to overcome the difficulties 
giving rise to a low rating? (Table XLVI, Appendix E.) Several 
respondents commented that many of the deficiencies are pointed 
out early in the school year to the teacher during the Single-mark 
rating procedure. (See Appendix F.) 

Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of Teaching 

Method Number 4 (Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of 
Teaching) ranks second as a 'Most-Used” method for measuring the 
competence of teachers in the urban schools of Canada* Twenty-two 
per cent of the districts use it as their most frequently used 
method. Of the ten methods outlined in the questionnaire the 
Marks-on-a-Series-of-Traits method ranks first as a "Second” method

in extent of use in Canadian centres of population greater than 
8,000. (Figures 2, 3, and 5, pages 68, 69, 70 and 71.) It is 
used as a "Second” method in 19 per cent of the urban centres» 

Its use as a "Third" method decreases to 6 per cent in urban 
areas. 

Thirty-four per cent of the administrative units in Canadian 
centres of population greater than 50,000 employ the Marks-on-a- 
Series-of-Traits as their "Most-Used" method. The percentage of 
smaller cities using the Marks-on-a-Series-of-Traits procedure 
decreases to 20 per cent for places between 10,000 and 50,000 
population, and to 13 per cent for centres of population between 
8,000 and 10,000. (Tables XLVI and XIX, Appendix E.) 

Three-tenths of the respondents gave a negative reply to 
the questionj Are teachers given marks on a series of traits or 
aspects of teaching? Since these same respondents indicated Method 
k as one that they used, it is reasonable to assume that all the 
respondents concerned with Method [j. should have answered the question 
in the affirmative. One explanation could be in the interpretation 
of the word "marks" used in the question. 

More than three-quarters of the school systems using the 
Marks-on-a-Series-of-Traits method have formulated a scale that 
lists various factors assumed to be important as a basis for 
evaluating teacher efficiency. The number of factors included 
in the lists ranged from three to sixty-two in the various centres. 
When traits are grouped into major categories, the number of the

latter is no greater than ten. Not all centres using Method 1|, 
however, employ a plan that involves a formal list of traits. This 
fact is inferred from the questionnaire returns when it was noted 
that 50 per cent of the respondents concerned omitted a reply to 
questions "c", "d" and f, e M of Method k on the questionnaire© 

In over 80 per cent of the Marks-on-a-Series-of-Traits plans 
the rating marks are given in qualitative words. (Table XLIX, 

Appendix E.) 

Twenty-eight per cent of the plans call for the marking of 
competency in each trait to be recorded by means of a numerical 
scale. A five-point scale is most frequently used. let 62 per cent 
of the plans use no scale. 

Three-eighths of the plans provide for the scale to define 
each mark in terms of the particular trait listed^ and in a like 
fraction of the plans the scale provides for weighting the items. 

Forty per cent of the systems using the Marks-on-a-Series- 
of-Traits method require that an over-all score be given to the 
teachers as a summary of the ratings on individual traits. (Table LIII, 
Appendix E.) 

The Provincial Inspector determines the teacher's mark in 
36 per cent of the centres using Method ii. The Superintendent 
and the Principal give the mark in 25 per cent of the places where 
the Marks-on-a-Series-of-Traits plan operates. 

Sixty per cent of the plans call for a recommendation by 
the rater as to whether a teacher should be retained, transferred, 
or dismissed. (Table LV, Appendix E.) In a like percentage of 
centres the rating is made known to the teacher. (Table LVI, 

Appendix E.) Nine per cent of the replies (Table LVTI, Appendix E)

indicated that it is possible that a teacher f s salary could be 
affected by the ratings. The comments (See Appendix F) explain 
that this feature can result if a poorly-rated temporary teacher 
is dismissed, or if the rater recommends that the salary increment 
of a teacher on the permanent staff be withheld. The questionnaire 
replies and comments indicate that features of a "merit" salary 
plan do not exist in any Canadian urban centres. 

Qualitative Statements About Each Teacher 

Qualitative Statements About Each Teacher, Method 5 of 
the questionnaire, is the most widely used method in urban school 
districts of Canada. Forty per cent of the centres use the 
Qualitative-statements method as their "Most-Used" measuring 
instrument in appraising teacher competence. As a "Second" and 
"Third" method the Qualitative-statements procedure is employed 
in 13 per cent of all Canadian urban centres surveyed. (Tables X, 

XI and XII, Appendix E.) 

In smaller cities between 8,000 and 10,000 population the 
use of qualitative statements as a "Most-Used" method rises to 
50 per cent of the centres of this size. (Figure 5, page 71.) 

As a "Most-Used" method the Qualitative-statements plan is 
carried on in over 50 per cent of the urban centres in Ontario, 
Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan. In the last-mentioned 
province 71 per cent of the urban school areas use Method 5 as a 
"Most-Used" instrument. 

Ninety-three per cent of the respondents to the question 
which inquired if written statements about the work of each teacher 
were submitted gave a "yes" reply. Many of the respondents.

however, made qualifying comments .(See Appendix F.) Some respondents 
stated that the word "mdde" described their plan better than the 
word "submitted". In many cases the wish of the school administra¬ 
tive officials is to submit a written report on each teacher, but 
the time factor allows for statements to be submitted on only the 
new teachers and those on probation. 

The Provincial Inspector writes the qualitative statements 
in nearly 50 per cent of the school systems using this method. The 
principal writes the statements in 25 per cent of the urban centres 
where Method 5 is used. In the centres of population under 50,000 
in British Columbia the Principal of larger schools (10 teachers or 
more) are required to submit to the Inspector written yearly reports 
on each teacher. These reports are in triplicate, copies going to 
the Inspector, the Teacher and the Principal. The School Boards 
by resolution may ask to see this report. (See Appendix F.) 

Fifty-five per cent of the statement-reports are submitted to a 
School Board, a School Commission, or a locally appointed Super¬ 
intendent. (Table LX, Appendix E.) 

Eighty-txfo per cent of the respondents concerned with this 
method replied that a general statement representing the writer's 
judgment of the work of the teacher is required by the plan in force 
in their districts. (Table LXI, Appendix E.) In nearly all cases 
where Method 5 is applied, the "rater" is free to form his judgments 
on the basis of whatever evidence he wishes to consider, and he is 
free to weigh this evidence in any manner he deems desirable* 

(Table LXII, Appendix E.) When these features in the plan exist, 
critics of the Qualitative-statements method claim that it is too 
subjective and becomes less valid as a means for measuring teacher

effectiveness since "judgment is rendered in terms of the personal 
philosophy of the rater#" ^ 

A form for the guidance of the rater in making his comments 
is set forth in forty-two per cent of the places using Qualitative 
Statement plans. (Table LXIII, Appendix E.) In many cases the 
rater makes his own form. In two-thirds of the centres a personal 
letter may be used in lieu of the form# (Table LXIV, Appendix E#) 
Comments on specific areas or aspects of teaching are required in 
slightly over half of the plans# (Table LXV, Appendix E.) 

Nearly all the "Statement" procedures provide that the rater 
may make whatever comments he wishes for each of the aspects of the 
teacher ’ s work and growth. However, in this connection, 38 per cent 
of the plans list items under each specific area to suggest things 
on which the rater may wish to comment. (Table LXVII, Appendix E.) 

In only 3 per cent of the urban school centres using the Qualita¬ 
tive-statements method are the raters required to comment on every 
item listed. (Table LXVIII, Appendix E.) 

Eighty-nine per cent of the "Statement" plans contain no 
quantitative score in conjunction with the statements. (Table LXVIII, 
Appendix E.) 

The statement is made known to the teacher in eighty-three 
per cent of the school systems using the process of Method 
(Table LXX, Appendix E.) This is generally done informally and 
orallyj the actual wording is usually not recorded. (See Appendix F) 
The teacher is rarely informed officially or formally that state¬ 
ments concerning her are being written, but 92 per cent of the 
respondents to this Method £ answered that the teachers know that

these statements are being written* (Table LXXI, Appendix E.) 

A majority of the centres reported that specific evidence of 
unsatisfactory work is not required in case an unsatisfactory report 
is made, but this evidence is usually given. (Table LXXII, Appendix E) 

Eleven per cent of the respondents whose cities use the 
"Statements” plan replied that it is possible for a teacher’s salary 
to be affected by the report. (Table LXXIII, Appendix E.) The 
comments given state that it is possible to withhold increments for 
unsatisfactory work. It is claimed that this step has not been 
taken often. Permanent contracts have been deferred and teachers 
on probation who did not improve have resigned or have been dismissed. 

Appraisal by an Evaluation Board 

Method 6 of the questionnaire. Appraisal by an Evaluation 
Board, is used to a small extent in Canadian urban school systems. 

Its total use as a "Most-Used", as a "Second", and as a "Third" 
method amounts to only 12 per cent of the centres of urban popula¬ 
tion. (Figures 2, 3, li, and 5, pages 68, 69, 70, and 71| and Tables 
X, Xi, XII, Appendix E.) This percentage is approximately one-sixth 
of the 67 per cent of Canadian centres which use Method 5, Qualita¬ 
tive Statements on the Work of Each Teacher, as a "Most-Used", 
"Second", or "Third" method. 

Cities greater than 50,000 population use the Evaluation- 
board method more extensively than do the smaller centres. In the 
larger cities Method 6 is used: 

(1) as a "Most-Used" procedure in 7 per cent of the cities, 

(2) as a "Second" procedure in 17 per cent of the cities, and 

(3) as a "Third" procedure in 3 per cent of the cities.

Eighty-six per cent of the respondents on Question a. 

Method 6, state than an evaluation board is in operation in their 
school systems, (Table LXXIV, Appendix E,) However, the comments 
of the respondents (See Appendix F) indicate that these boards, in 
the main, are composed of school officials who review applications 
for administrative positions. 

The questionnaire returns give no evidence that evaluation 
boards such as outlined by Koopman^ exist in urban areas of Canada, 
Koopman’s plan calls for one or two classroom teachers to act as 
members of a board that is evaluating a teacher. An essential 
feature in Koopman’s plan is that a teacher 1 s advancement in salary 
to the highest level is made on the basis of selection by a group 
partly consisting of one’s own peers. 

Replies to Question b. Method 6, of the questionnaire 
indicated that the number of members on Canadian urban evaluation 
boards is usually,three, four, or five. 

Seventy-two per cent (Table LXXV, Appendix E.) of the 
respondents to Question c. Method 6, of the questionnaire advised 
that the evaluation boards select, recommend, or reject teachers 
for advancement to a higher career-status or career-teacher rank. 
However, the comments (See Appendix F) implied that career-status or 
career-teacher rank could be defined as administrative positions 
such as those of principal and supervisor. Questionnaire replies 
gave no evidence that evaluation boards in Canada select teachers 
for career-status in which the teacher continues teaching but at a 
higher salary due to her elevation to career-teacher rank.

Seventy-one per cent of the respondents to Method 6 of 
the questionnaire (Table LXXVII, Appendix E.) indicated that a 
teacher need not have served a specified number of years before he 
becomes eligible to be considered by the evaluation board. It is 
understandable then that 80 per cent of respondents to Method 6 
did not reply to Question (e) which asked for the specified number 
of years a teacher must serve before he or she becomes eligible for 
consideration by an evaluation board. Affirmative answers to 
Question (e) gave three to five, six to ten, and seven as the 
usual number of required years. 

Only one respondent replied that a different evaluation 
board is assembled for each teacher under consideration. Ninety- 
two per cent of the respondents gave a negative reply to Question 

(f) . Method 6. (Table LXXVTI1, Appendix E.) It is assumed that the 
expense involved in providing an evaluation board for each teacher 
to be judged is prohibitive. The expense factor and the time 
element required for gathering and evaluating evidence by the board 
are two criticisms of the Koopman plan. 

Seven of the fifteen administrators who replied to Question 

(g) stated that a teacher f s advancement in salary or career-status 
is possible only on the basis of selection by the evaluation board. 
The comments (See Appendix F) to question (g) suggest that these 
affirmative replies were made with only the career-status part of 
the question in mind since some of the respondents stated that 
salary schedules were in effect, and that teachers automatically 
moved according to experience and qualifications.

Eighty-seven per cent of evaluation boards in urban centres 
of Canada are appointed by local authorities. Officials who are 
most often members of an evaluation board are the Superintendent or 
Director of Studies, the Inspector, and the Principal. (Table LXXX, 
Appendix E. ) 

Teachers who fail to be recommended by an evaluation board 
may resubmit their applications for consideration in eighty-three 
per cent of the centres using Method 6* One year was given as the 
time required to elapse before applications would be reconsidered. 
However, nine of the respondents or eighty-four per cent of the 
centres using the Evaluation-boardmethod did not reply to Question 

oo. 

Ninety-two per cent of the ’’Yes” replies to Question (1), 
(Table LXXXII, Appendix E.) and eighty-nine per cent of negative 
replies to Question (m), (Table LXXXIII, Appendix E.) indicate 
that in a large majority of urban centres of Canada salary advance¬ 
ment for teachers is automatic, especially for members of the 
permanent staff. The comments of the respondents also indicate 
that promotions authorized by an evaluation board permit teachers 
involved to benefit by an increase in salary and to reach a higher 
maximum* 

Judgments Based on Cumulative Record of the Teacher 

This particular process of teacher appraisal, derived 
through judgments based on the cumulative professional record of 
the teacher, is used most extensively as a n Third 15 method* Method 
7 is employed as a •’Third” method in 21 per cent of all Canadian 
urban school systems replying to the questionnaire. No other

procedure ranks higher in point of use as a "Third” method than the 
technique used to appraise teacher competence through judgments 
on the cumulative record* Thirty-five per cent of the Canadian 
cities use this Method 7 as a "Third" appraisal process* Thirty 
cities in Ontario use the Judgments-on-Cumnlative-Record as a 
"Third" method. 

Twelve per cent of the centres use this Judgments-on- 
Cumulative-Record process as a "Second" method^ 7 per cent of the 
urban school systems use it as a tf Most-Used" method. 

Eighty-eight per cent of the respondents to Question (a), 
Method 7, which asked if an extensive cumulative personnel record 
or personnel file on teacher competency is maintained for each 
teacher, replied in the affirmative. (Table LXXXIV, Appendix E.) 

The comments which were added, however, contain remarks such ass 
#Dfot extensive", "Very brief", and "Fairly extensive". (See 
Appendix F.) 

In a large majority of the urban centres (91 per cent) 
evaluation based on the cumulative record of the teacher is used 
to select teachers for advancement to a higher positional status. 
Eighty-eight per cent of respondents whose systems use Method 7 
replied that the evaluation based on the cumulative record of the 
teacher is not used to select teachers for advancement to a higher 
salary bracket. The comments (See Appendix F) indicated that 
salary increase in most Canadian urban school centres is based 
on the years of service and training as determined by an approved 
salary schedule. 

In cities larger than 50,000 population, the Superintendent 
and an Administrative Committee are most frequently the agents for

determining and gathering the types of evidence, information, and 
standards to be obtained for filing in the teacher*s personnel 
record. In cities between 10,000 and 50,000 population this duty- 
most often falls to the Inspector, Superintendent and Principal. 
(Table LXXXVII, Appendix E.) In smaller cities the Inspector 
determines the evidence, information, and standards in 70 per cent 
of the centres of 8,000 to 10,000 population. The Inspector 
obtains the evidence in 6k per cent of these smaller cities. (Table 
LXXXVIII, Appendix E.) 

Four of the fifty-five respondents to Question (f). 

Method 7> stated that in their systems selective promotions occur 
at the end of a specified number of years of service for each 
teacher. Two respondents replied that eight years, and three or 
more years is the usual number of specified years. 

Ninety-eight per cent of respondents to Question (h). 

Method 7 * indicated that no specified percentage of teachers is 
required to be promoted. One respondent gave two per cent as the 
specified percentage of teachers required to be promoted. 

Joint Evaluation 

Joint Evaluation is closely related to Self Evaluation. 

Since the latter method is used the least of all methods in 
appraising teacher competence, it would seem logical to assume 
that Joint Evaluation is also used to a slight extent. The 
questionnaire survey showed that only one per cent of Canadian urban 
school systems use Joint Evaluation as their f, Most-Used n method. 
(Table X, Appendix E.) Eight per cent of the cities use Joint

Evaluation as a ‘'Second” method; and six per cent of the centres 
use it as a '‘Third” technique to appraise teachers. (Tables XI and 
XII, Appendix E.) 

Of the eighteen respondents to Question (a). Method 8 of 
the questionnaire, one replied that his system did. not use a 
Joint Evaluation procedure in which the teacher and superior 
officer both evaluate the teacher's work. (Table XCI, Appendix E.) 
This respondent commented that the procedure used in his school 
system is more informal than that indicated in Question (a). 

Method 8, of the questionnaire* 

The Provincial Inspector and the Principal are the officers 
who most frequently conduct joint evaluation procedures with the 
teachers. (Table XCII, Appendix E.) Sixty per cent of all senior 
officials conducting joint evaluation with teachers are appointed 
by local authorities* 

Twenty-eight per cent of the urban centres where Joint 
Evaluation is carried on use a check-list form of evaluation. 

(Table XGIII, Appendix E.) More than half of the systems applying 
Joint Evaluation measures have the evaluation in the form of 
written statements for each area to be evaluated. (Table XCIY, 
Appendix E.) Supporting evidence is given for the statements 
made in thirteen of the fifteen centres using Joint Evaluation. 
(Table XCV, Appendix E.) 

Fifty-six per cent of the Joint Evaluation plans in use in 
urban Canada do not have the evaluation form divided formally into 
areas for evaluation with a number of traits or qualities listed 
for each area. Yet a higher percentage (63 per cent) of the Joint

Evaluation districts replied that good practice in each characteristic 

o 

is not defined or described* The Commission on Teacher Evaluation 0 
stated that when each characteristic is defined and described, the 
Joint Evaluation procedure becomes more valid as an appraisal 
technique since the teacher then has some guide as to what the 
school system considers to be good teaching. 

No score is given in the evaluation plans of eighty-nine 
per cent of the centres using Joint Evaluation. (Table XCVIII, 

Appendix E.) This fact would seem to substantiate the implication 
in the comments that Joint Evaluation plans used in Canadian centres 
are informal, and mainly oral in nature. 

In three of the eighteen plans reported, the teacher and 
the superior officer exchange copies of the form on which each 
has made his evaluation. (Table XCIX, Appendix E.) A feature of 
most of the plans (81 per cent) is the conference in which the 
results of the evaluation are discussed. (Table C, Appendix E.) 

More than half of the plans note differences of opinion 
on a form. (Table Cl, Appendix E.) The evaluation form is signed 
by the teacher and the superior officer in thirty-eight per cent 
of the centres using Joint Evaluation. (CII, Appendix E.) Sup¬ 
plementary comments are made on the form by the superior officer 
in more than half the plans in use in urban Canada. (Table CHI, 
Appendix E.) The form becomes part of the teacher’s permanent file 
in more than fifty per cent of the plans. (Table CIV, Appendix E.) 

Table CV, Appendix E and the comments (See Appendix F) of 
the respondents indicate that in three-quarters of the centres the

teacher is shown the superior officer's evaluation. Several 
respondents qualified their answer with the comment, "When re¬ 
quested." 

Nearly all administrators of Joint Evaluation procedures in 
Canadian urban school systems replied that their plans are based 
on educational goals that are developed cooperatively by teacher(s) 
and superior officer(s). (Table CVI, Appendix E.) 

In no Canadian city school system replying to the question¬ 
naire is the teacher's salary affected by Joint Evaluation. (Table 
CVII, Appendix E.) 

The Anecdotal Record 

The Anecdotal Record procedure for appraising the efficiency 
of elementary school teachers is used as a "Most-Used" method in 
seven per cent of the urban centres of Canada, (Figures 2, 3, b and 
5, pages 68, 69, 70 and 71j and Tables X, XI and XII, Appendix E.) 

As a "Second" and "Third" method the Anecdotal-record process is 
employed respectively in ll* per cent and 1* per cent of Canadian 
urban school systems. 

Seventeen of the twenty-nine respondents replying to 
Question (a). Method 9, indicated that their systems provide a form 
for the collection of extensive evidence on teaching practices 
within broad areas. (Table CVIII, Appendix E.) The respondents 
whose systems use a form indicated that the number of broad areas 
on the form usually ranges from five to eleven. Seventy-four 
per cent of the replies also indicated that the form is arranged 
so that an anecdotal record of observations of teaching may be 
entered. (Table CIX, Appendix E.)

Ninety-two per cent of the systems using anecdotal 
observations use the record as a basis for later formulation of 
judgments and evaluations. (Table CX, Appendix E.) These evaluations 
are made in terras of certain concepts or aspects of teaching in 
ninety-three per cent of the centres using anecdotal procedures. 
(Table CXI, Appendix E.) These aspects of teaching are further 
subdivided into characteristics of good teaching in sixty per cent 
of the anecdotal plans in use in Canada. (Table CXII, Appendix E.) 
More than half of the plans do not describe these characteristics 
in a sentence or paragraph. (Table CXIII, Appendix E.) One 
respondent commented that these characteristics "should be" 
described in a sentence or paragraph. This observation expresses 
the opinion of some educational authorities who claim that appraisal 
methods which include a description of what the femulators of the 
plan consider good teaching are more valid procedures than the 
appraisal plans containing no descriptions of good teaching 
practices. 

In a large majority (86 per cent) of anecdotal plans the 
evaluations are judgment statements. Eighty-five per cent of the 
urban centres using anecdotal procedures assign no score. In only 
eleven per cent of the plans does the teacher himself use the book¬ 
let or form for recording evidence of his own teaching practices. 
(Table CXIV, Appendix E.) 

Two of the twenty-five respondents to Question (k). 

Method 9, of the questionnaire indicated that the teacher’s salary 
is affected by the evaluations of the anecdotal record. (Table CXVII , 
Appendix E.) The comments (See Appendix F.) indicated that salary 
could be affected if salary increments are withheld, or if the

teacher is dismissed. The comments do not indicate that an 
evaluation could cause a teacher’s salary to be increased by more 
than the increment provided in an approval salary schedule. 

Cooperative Evaluation 

As a ”Most-Used", or as a ’’Second”, or as a ’’Third” method 
of evaluating teacher efficiency, the so-called Cooperative 
Evaluation is practiced in no more than six per cent of the urban 
school centres of Canada. Figures 2, 3* b and 5, pages 68, 69 > 70 
and 71$ and Tables X, XI and XII, Appendix E.) Cooperative 
Evaluation is used as a “Second” method in fourteen per cent of 
urban centres larger than $0,000 population. Twenty per cent of 
Alberta urban centres use Cooperative Evaluation as a “Most-Used” 
method in evaluating teacher competence. 

Of the twenty-nine replies to Question (a). Method 10, 
of the questionnaire, twenty-eight stated that the determination 
of teacher-pupil learning objectives and of the means for obtain¬ 
ing them is voluntarily assumed as a cooperative responsibility 
of the teaching staff and the administration. (Table CXVIII, 
Appendix E.) One respondent stated that the teaching staff may 
be unaware of the purpose or the incentive for assuming this 
responsibility. 

All the replies to Question (b). Method 10, agreed that 
members of the school staffs practicing Cooperative Evaluation are 
free to plan and work together cooperatively, utilizing their best 
insight, for an improved program of education. (Table CXIX, 
Appendix E.)

Eighty-eight per cent of the respondents to this Method 10 
indicated that the evaluation plan is developed as an integral part 
of the teacher-pupil learning situation. (Table CXX, Appendix E.) 
Ninety-two per cent of the plans impose a cooperative responsibility 
of all persons affected by the process. (Table CXXI, Appendix E.) 

Eighty-one per cent of the Cooperative Evaluation plan 
users stated that the plan is initiated by a key person. (Table 
CXXII, Appendix E.) This key person is most frequently the 
Principal of the school. (Table CXXIII, Appendix E.) 

The opportunity for participation on the part of the 
teacher is not limited in twenty of the twenty-nine cooperative 
plans in use in Canadian cities. (Table CXXIV, Appendix E.) In 
all of the cooperative plans except one* voluntary interaction 
between senior official and teacher is encouraged. (Table CXXV, 
Appendix E.) 

Although seventy-nine per cent of the respondents replied 
that the behavioral change and the direction of the change is 
cooperatively evolved by the group being evaluated, some of these 
respondents qualified their answer with comments such as: "On an 
observation basis only 11 , "By discussion", "Not always consciously". 
The direction of change is cooperatively altered, and redirected by 
the group that is evaluating its own efforts towards satisfying 
common needs in eighty-seven per cent of Canadian urban localities 
using Cooperative Evaluation. (Table CXXVII, Appendix E.) 

In seventy-two per cent of the plans various types of 
appraisal techniques and devices are used experimentally. (Table 
CXXVIII, Appendix E. ) 

Workshop opportunities are found in the school system as 
a whole in ninety-three per cent of urban centres using Cooperative

Evaluation* (Table CXXIX, Appendix E.) Seventy-seven per cent of 
school centres practicing cooperative evaluation procedures have 
workshop opportunities in each individual school. (Table CXXX, 
Appendix E„) Local conferences are employed to bring out the 
results of teacher planning and teacher initiative in twenty-eight 
of the thirty Canadian urban school localities applying Cooperative 
Evaluation measures* 

I*. Summary of the Specific Findings 
Related" to Ten Major Methods 

ofllCvaluating Teacher""Competence 

In only four per cent of the urban school districts in 
Canada is ranking employed as a M Most-Used ri method. In fifty per 
cent of the cases the Provincial Inspector is the official who does 
the ranking. The ranking lists are made known to teachers In 
approximately one-half of the urban centres which use ranking* 

Of all the evaluative techniques employed to measure the 
competence of teachers in urban centres of Canada the self- 
evaluative method is used least often. 

The Single-Mark-for-Each-Teacher (Method 3 of the question¬ 
naire) is a H Most-Used” procedure in nine per cent of the Canadian 
urban school systems. Three-fifths of the respondents indicated 
that the teacher is informed of the mark she has been assigned. 

Marks-on-a-Series-of-Traits-or-Aspects-of-Teaching 
(Method k of the questionnaire) ranks second as a tt Most-Used n method 
for measuring the competence of teachers in the urban centres of 
Canada. As in Method 3 above, three-fifths of the centres make 
known the mark to the teacher. In most of the plans the rating 
marks are given in qualitative words.

Qualitative Statements About Each Teacher, Method 5 of the 
questionnaire, is the most widely used method in urban school 
districts of Canada. Forty per cent of the centres use the 
Qualitative-statements method as their ’’Most-Used” measuring 
instrument in appraising teacher competence. Nearly all the 
M Statements 11 procedures provide that the rater may make whatever 
comments he wishes for each of the aspects of the teacher*s work 
and growth. In most of the plans the statements are made known to 
the teacher. This Information Is generally given informally and 
orally. 

Method 6 of the questionnaire. Appraisal by an Evaluation 
Board, is used to a small extent in Canadian urban school systems. 

Judgments Based on Cumulative Record of the Teacher, Method 
7 of the questionnaire, is employed as a ’’Third” method in twenty-one 
per cent of all Canadian urban school systems ih ich replied to the 
questionnaire. In the larger cities of Canada the Superintendent 
and an Administrative Committee are most frequently the agents for 
determining and gathering the types of evidence, information and 
standards to be obtained for filing in the teacher’s personnel 
record. 

The questionnaire survey showed that only one per cent of 
Canadian urban school systems use Joint Evaluation as their 
’’Most-Used” method for evaluating teacher efficiency. Joint 
Evaluation plans used in Canadian centres are mainly informal and 
oral in nature. 

The Anecdotal Record procedure for appraising the competence 
of elementary school teachers is used as a ’’Most-Used” method in 
seven per cent of the urban centres of Canada. Most of the systems

using anecdotal observations use the record as a basis for later 
formulation of judgments and evaluations. The evaluations are 
generally judgment statements* 

So-called Cooperative Evaluation is practiced in no more 
than six per cent of the urban centres of Canada. Most of the 
Cooperative Evaluation plans are initiated by a key person who is 
most frequently the principal* 

The foregoing was a presentation of the general and the 
specific findings which are related to ten major methods of 
evaluating teacher competence* The findings that resulted from 
the analysis of the questionnaire returns have led to the forma¬ 
tion of several conclusions and recommendations* These conclusions 
and recommendations are discussed in the following chapter,.

CHAPTER V 


SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. Summary 

The problem developed as a result of the writer's reading 
in the field of teacher-competence evaluation. A review of the 
available literature produced several studies that were related 
to the problem of determining how teacher competence is evaluated 
in Canadian urban school systems. 

It was decided to study the problem by using a questionnaire 
as a data-gathering instrument. The questionnaire-*- was divided 
into two parts. Part A gave a brief description of ten major methods 
of evaluating teacher competence. Respondents were requested to 
indicate which methods were "Most-Used", "Second" and "Third" in 
extent of use in evaluating the efficiency of teachers. Part B 
of the questionnaire contained questions that related to each of 
the ten major methods. Respondents were asked to answer the 
questions that were contained in the three methods that the 
respondents had indicated previously in Part A of the questionnaire. 

The questionnaire was sent to one hundred and eighty-five 
chief school administrators of urban school systems in Canada. 

These administrators represented all the urban school systems of 
Canada with populations larger than eight thousand. One hundred 
and twenty-five answered questionnaires were returned. Two of 
these questionnaires were not included in the data as they arrived 
after an analysis of the data had been commenced.

Forty per cent of the urban school systems in Canada which 
answered the questionnaire use Qualitative Statements about Each 
Teacher (Method 5 of the questionnaire) as a "Most-Used” method* 

No other method ranked higher as a "Most-Used” procedure* Twenty- 
two per cent of the school systems surveyed use Method 1| as a 
"Most-Used” process of evaluating teacher competence, the procedure 
which ranks second as a "Most-Used” method* 

2. Conclusions 

Answered questionnaires were received from sixty-seven 
per cent of the one hundred and eighty-five administrators to 
whom the booklet form had been sent* (Table IX, Appendix E*) 

Eighteen satellite communities of the Montreal and Quebec 
City Metropolitan Areas did not return the questionnaires. Several 
school secretaries of these communities wrote letters explaining 
that they were unable to complete the questionnaire since their 
schools were administered by the School Commissions of Montreal 
and Quebec City* From this information it could be concluded 
that the total number of questionnaires distributed might well 
have been reduced by eighteen. 

This reduction could reasonably be increased to twenty- 
four by considering as non-existent the two questionnaires which 
arrived too late for analysis and the four questionnaires which 
were sent to administrators who wrote letters indicating that, 
for various reasons, they were unable to answer the questionnaires. 
Thus, from one point of view, one hundred and sixty-one could be 
considered as the total number of questionnaires distributed. This

considered reduction in total questionnaires would result in 
increasing the percentage of questionnaire returns to seventy-six* 
Although an actual thirty-three per cent of the question¬ 
naires were not returned, urban school centres of all the provinces 
except Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland were well represented 
in the collected data and in its analysis. A consideration of the 
above percentages aided the establishment of a basis for the 
formation of conclusions that resulted from the study of the 
problem. The conclusions are as follows: 

1. Formal rating plans for evaluating teacher competence are 

used extensively in Canadian urban elementary school systems. 

The methods of Ranking, A Single Mark for Each Teacher, and 
Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of Teaching (Methods 1, 

3 and ij. of the questionnaire) represent various forms of 
formal rating schemes. Statements About the Work of Each 
Teacher (Method 5 of the questionnaire) is less formal than 
Methods 1, 3 or of the questionnaire. Statements-About- 
the-Work-of-Each-Teacher method is comparable to the ”Des~ 
criptive Report” rating plan of the 19lt0*s. 

Seventy-five per cent of Canadian urban school systems use 
one of Methods 1, 3* it or 5, which were mentioned in the 
preceding paragraph, as a n Most-Used l} method for evaluating 
the effectiveness of teachers. Thirty-nine per cent of the 
school systems use these four formal rating plans (Methods 1, 

3, h and 5 of the questionnaire) as a ^Second” evaluative 
procedure. In Canadian centres of population larger than 
50,000 eighty per cent of the school systems employ some formal 
plan as a ”Most-Used” method*

Some of the features of the Statements-About-the-Wcrk-of- 
Each-Teacher procedure (Method 5 of the questionnaire) repre¬ 
sent a tendency to retreat from formal rating scales. Method 5> 
cannot be said to be entirely informal in nature. Nevertheless* 
the wide use of Method $ in Canadian urban schools* as well as a 
consideration of the respondents 1 comments (Appendix F), suggest 
a trend to depart from the more rigid rating-scale procedures 
for evaluating the competence of teachers. 

The Marks-on-a«Series-of-Traits-or-Aspects-of-Teaching 
procedure (Method k of the questionnaire)* which ranks second 
in extent of use in Canada as a 'Most-Used” method* can be 
classified as a formal rating device. 

It can be concluded that although types of rating devices 
such as Methods 3 and k of the questionnaire are frequently 
used for evaluating teacher competence in Canadian elementary 
schools* there has been a substantial departure from the 
rigidity of arbitrary rating forms. This departure is charac¬ 
terised in the frequent use of Method 5 of the questionnaire. 

There is very little use made of self-appraisal and group- 
appraisal methods in city school systems of Canada. These two 
approaches are the least common of the different procedures for 
evaluating teacher efficiency. No urban school system surveyed 
uses self-evaluation as a ’Most-Used 1 ’ method. Five school 
systems use seIf-evaluation procedures as a ’’Second” method. 

Eight urban systems use self-evaluation as a ’’Third” method. The 
use of self-evaluation in the larger cities of Canada is almost 
negligible. Only one large city system included in the survey 
returns uses the procedure as a ’’Third” method®

Cooperative evaluation is not carried on in Canadian urban 
schools to any large extent. Less than twenty per cent of the 
school systerns surveyed employ it as a definitely planned pro¬ 
cedure# 

The writer found no evidence in the replies or in the comments 
of the respondents that plans which use pupil opinion and reaction 
in evaluating the efficiency of elementary teachers exist in 
Canadian urban school centres# 

Since only three respondents commented that their school 
systems use the indirect (tests on pupils) approach to evaluate 
the effectiveness of elementary teachers, the writer concluded 
that relatively few Canadian urban school systems employ this 
method# 

Replies and comments of the respondents to the questionnaire 
gave evidence that administrators who are responsible for 
appraising the efficiency of the elementary teachers in the 
urban schools of Canada allocate much of the supervisory time to 
determining the competence of the probationary teachers# 

The analysis of the respondents 1 comments indicated that 
formal techniques for evaluating teacher competence are not 
applied to any large extent to permanent members of the teaching 
staffs of schools in large Canadian cities# 

In a large majority of urban school centres of Canada salary 
advancement for teachers is automatic, especially for members 
of the permanent staff. Many Canadian urban school districts 
pa}r teachers according to approved salary schedules# On the basis 
of the evidence obtained in the study, merit rating of elementary 
teachers for salary purposes is not practiced extensively in urban 
school systems of Canada.

10. The use of probationary teacher contracts by Canadian urban 
school boards is extensive* Some agreements between school 
boards and teachers have a clause giving power to withhold 
increments for incompetence* These powers are used sparingly 
because school boards, inspectors, and superintendents find them 
difficult to administer* 

11. Few city school systems require the principals of the 
schools to submit formal evaluations of elementary teachers* 

12. The comments of many of the administrators replying to the 
questionnaire indicated that the paramount objective in apprais¬ 
ing the competence of teachers and their work is to help teachers 
to improve* From the analysis of the data it is apparent that 
this improvement concept is well established in many of the 
evaluative and appraisal policies of Canadian school adminis¬ 
trative units* 

13. Some of the respondents 1 comments and letters gave evidence 
that many urban school systems have lately instituted or are 
planning to institute more comprehensive and directive policies 
for appraising the effectiveness of teachers. 

Canadian school administrators are aware of the necessity 
for continued study which may produce an understanding of the 
inadequacies of current methods for appraising teacher competence* 
Administrators realize that through the process of directed study 
remedies are more likely to be determined* 

3. Recommendations 

The conclusions stated above have given rise to certain 

recommendations. These recommendations are as follows:

106 


1. It is recommended that the reasons for the wide use in 
Canadian urban schools of the Statements-About-the-Work-of-Each- 
Teacher method (Method 5 of the questionnaire) be determined* 
Such reasons may be of aid to school administrators and teachers 
in guiding the improvement of appraisal methods relating to 
teacher competence* 

2. It is recommended that an investigation into the factors 
that influence the policies and plans for evaluating teacher 
competence be undertaken* This investigation should include 
the influences which have been caused by the teacher shortage 
of the past few years and the wide acceptance of negotiated 
teacher salary schedules* 

3* Since some of the respondents' comments indicated an 

inadequacy in the number of administrative officers assigned 
to appraise and evaluate the competence of teachers in Canadian 
city schools, it is recommended that steps be taken to improve 
such a condition. 

It. It is recommended that school principals be given greater 

responsibility in the establishment and execution of plans for 
evaluating the efficiency of teachers. 

5. It is recommended that steps be taken in an effort to 

bring teachers together for the purpose of having them become 
fully aware of the need for improving the evaluation of the 


services of teachers

INSTRUCTIONS 


by number various types of methods known to me that are used to 
of elementary school teachers. 


In the first block provided below write the number of the method which 
is used most in your school system. 

In the second block write the number of the method which ranks second 
in extent of use. 

In the third block write the number of the method which ranks third in 
extent of use. 


Methods of Appraising the Efficiency of Elementary School Teachers 

1. Ranking Teachers —Teachers are listed from the highest to the 
lowest on the basis of teaching effectiveness. 

2. Self Evaluation —Teachers appraise themselves with the help of 
scales or guides which usually list a set of teaching characteristics. 

3. Single Mark for Each Teacher —The mark given may be a number, 
a letter, or a qualitative word. A scale is used frequently. Generally 
no bases or criteria for rating the teacher are defined for the person 
doing the rating. 

4. Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of Teaching — Marks are 
usually qualitative words, such as, “superior”, “average”. Some¬ 
times marks are numerical. Teaching traits are generally listed and 
grouped in categories. 

5. Qualitative Statements about Each Teacher — Written statements 
about the work of a teacher are submitted. 

6. Appraisal by an Evaluation Board —Persons constituting a ‘Board’ 
evaluate the work of one or more teachers. 

7. Judgments Based on Cumulative professional Record of the Teacher— 

Evidence and information filed in teacher’s personnel record or file 
form the bases of judgments of teacher’s competency. 

8. Joint Evaluation —The teacher and a superior officer both evaluate 
the teacher’s work. 

9. The Anecdotal Record —A record of observations of a teacher and 
his work are entered on a form. This record is later used as a basis 
for the formulation of judgments and evaluations of a teacher’s work. 

10. Cooperative Evaluation— The teaching staff as a whole or committees 
formed of staff members formulate purposes in teacher-learning 
situations. The staff committees then work out plans to realize these 
purposes. 

11. Other: Please describe it on the last page of this questionnaire.

APPENDIX F 


REHIESENTATIVE COMMENTS 
OF 


RESPONDENTS TO THE QUESTIONNAIRE 








2hl 


a, General Comments of Respondents to the Questionnaire 


1. Since the position of Elementary Supervisor is a new one, 
evaluation methods are in an experimental stage. Up until 
last year, teachers had had very little classroom supervision 
or in-service training. Because this presented a "delicate 
situation" psychologically, I have made progress slowly, allow¬ 
ing the teachers full participation in arriving at methods 

for improvement. For my own satisfaction I devised a form as 
described in Number £ of the questionnaire. In order that 
teachers not be put on the defensive, they have not been told 
about this. Until we have achieved a mature and objective 
attitude toward self-evaluation, we shall continue in this 
manner, 

2, Our methods of teacher evaluation have always been very informal 
and based upon observing class-room performance. We do most 

of our rating before the teacher is appointed to our staff— 
by careful checking of records previous to appointment. Our 
problems arising from poor quality of teachers are thus very, 
very few. The use of rigid forms and marks in teacher evalua¬ 
tion seem to us to give only an appearance of objectivity 
in a field where real objectivity is very difficult to prac¬ 
tice or record, 

3* No progressive evaluation is in use. Administrator and "board" 
plus inspector use class results, records and other personal 
qualities at contract time, except in unusual cases. 

li. We use Numbers 2, 5, 7, 8, conjointly, rather than any single 
one method. 

5. Teachers who have been on the staff over five years and doing 
good work are not reported on other than to intimate that 
they continue to give good to excellent service. New teachers 
are reported on each year. Any whose report was not good on 
previous reports are again included in the reports. 

6. The Principal and Inspector cooperate in an endeavor to get a 
weak teacher to develop into a strong teacher. This happens 
quite frequently. We try to get the teacher to feel that she 
has friends who care about his or her success and get him or 
her seeking help. This is very effective when the teacher 
has a potential for good work. In a few cases little results. 

7. Teaching is a subjective something. How can it be designated by 
a mark? One knows whether or not the teaching is getting the 
desired results so I feel that rating should be limited to: 

(a) Doing excellent work (b) Doing good work (c) Doing average 
work (d) Doing only fair work (e) Doing poor work, 

8. The work of each teacher is discussed with his or her principal 
who may be called upon by the board for a separate report on 
the work of any teacher on his staff. If his report is adverse, 
he must show his report to the teacher concerned before it is 
submitted to the school board, (This is a Federation regulation.)

9 . In practice—Too much ranking and appraisal is dangerous# 
Teachers generally re-act unfavourably# Encouragement and 
appreciation do wonders and pave the way for effective sugges¬ 
tions. I am more interested in being of help to teachers than 
in scoring them. The impossible ones are soon detected and 
eliminated# 

10. Transition taking place from method 5 to 8 and 10. 

11. Attached is a rating scale issued by the provincial authority 
which may be used if the superintendent so desires. I do not 
think it is widely used. 

We do not consider teacher rating to be of prime importance. 
It is more important to assist teachers to improve their work. 

12. It appears to me that, in this School District, we do not use 
any one method fully. We use a great many features from most 
methods, but the most comprehensive is Method 7s Judgments 
Based On Cumulative Professional Record of the Teacher. We use 
this before and after teachers are employed by this School 
Board. Marks on a Series of Traits or Aspects of Teaching 
(No# 1;) is also a method used extensively. 

13• (a) The regular card rating system of teachers is not used in 

these schools because there are only about fifty elementary 
teachers which makes it possible for the Assistant 
Supervisor of Schools to have close contact with each 
teacher# 

(b) The Provincial Department of Education never asks for nor 
keeps a rating on the teachers. 

(c) There are very few chances of promotion (only for a 
principalship when such opens). 

(d) Salaries are paid according to a scale—no extras are paid 
for anything to any classroom teacher. 

(e) The belief of the Supervisor of Schools that the best 
evaluation comes from the personal contact (observation in 
the classroom, personal teacher interviews, the in-service 
training program, apparent attitude shown by the teacher, 
her handling of discipline, her co-operation, her education¬ 
al philosophy, etc.) that is possible in a small urban 
school system. 

(f) When a teacher proves to be unsatisfactory after close 
work with her, an explained request for her resignation 
will generally solve the situation# 

(g) If a teacher is not satisfactory to us, it does not neces¬ 
sarily mean she will be a failure under a different type 
of school organization (e.g#, some teachers are more suc¬ 
cessful in a rural school than in an urban school)# 
Therefore, a card system could be unfair to many teachers. 

llw The following might be noted: 

(a) Teachers holding permanent diplomas and teaching (city 
over 50,000) are not regularly visited by inspectors of 
the Department of Education#

(b) All teachers holding interim certificates or other pro¬ 
bationary certification are visited by Inspectors of the 
Department of Education who, alone, recommend permanent 
certification. 

(c) All teachers in schools outside of (city over £0,000) under 
the control of the Department of Education (Protestant) 
are visited at least once yearly by an Inspector of the 
Department of Education. 

15* The School Commission engages its personnel and controls its 
services by the Inspector of Schools or Superintendent; the 
latter nevertheless is appointed and paid by the Deparlanent 
of Education. 

A larger School Commission usually engages a Director 
of Studies who plays a part analogous to that of the Inspector 
(Superintendent) but who is responsible to the School Commis¬ 
sion itself. Then a cumulative file functions (Method 7)« 

Such is not the case here (ll*,000 population). 


b. Comments of Respondents Regarding Specific Methods 


Comments Regarding Method 1, Ranking Teachers 

1. Any ranking done is on the basis of general efficiency of the 
teacher with consideration for the type of pupil taught. 

2. inspectors are required to submit a list of all teachers, at 
the end of the school year, with 1 to 5 ratings. If a report 
is written on a teacher that teacher gets a copy. It is 
impossible to submit reports on all teachers in this district, 
(over 600 teachers.) 

3. This type of record is kept by Registrar, Department of 
Education, and is based on Inspectors* ratings for each year 
of teacher’s service. 

ii. We do not rank our teachers formally but we do have our opinions 
as to the relative efficiency of each. Teachers are engaged 
upon a probationary contract for one year. If after one year, 
the teacher is recommended for a permanent contract, we direct 
our efforts toward improving his or her teaching effectiveness. 

Comments Regarding Method 2, Self Evaluation 

1. This method has been used slightly, but only by the teachers 
for their own improvement. Their evaluations are not given 
to the administration. 

2. Teachers have been supplied with "Self-Evaluation Chart" 
but its use has been entirely personal except where, in some 
cases, inspector and teacher have reviewed contents jointly. 

3. Self-evaluation left largely to the teachers is not of much use. 
All teachers think themselves good.

li. Various self-evaluation rating scales are mimeographed for 
distribution* Teacher participation is entirely voluntary. 

The main purpose is not evaluation but to place emphasis on 
teaching environment, attitude, and procedures. 

5>. Used frequently by Principals. 

6. Some use has been made of this method. 

7. Some done at Junior High level in Home Economics and Industrial 
Art classes. 

Comments Regarding Method 3> A Single Mark for Each Teacher 

1. Teachers are rated as a result of tests put on in September 
and May. Final results on the tests and the year’s improvement 
are taken into account compared with all classes in the system 
in the particular grade involved. These results are weighted 
for the different subjects, reading being given most weight 

in the lower grades. The results are considered in conjunc¬ 
tion with the I.Q.'s and ages of the pupils. Other factors 
such as discipline, etc. are taken into account to some slight 
extent in cases that are near the line between two categories— 
A, B, C, D, E. 

Inspections of classwork of teacher are made from time to 
time but not much weight is given to these findings—they are 
mainly supervisory. No competent trained educationist thinks 
he can judge a teacher’s efficiency in a half day’s visit. 
Efficiency should be evaluated by results not by observations 
of teaching methods about which no one knows much and which may 
or may not indicate what the results will be. Inspector’s 
reports are of some value but not very much. 

2. ’’Mark” is contained in summary of report and indicated by 
Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Fair, Poor. 

3. Rating of each teacher is made in a summary form for the 
Department of Education of the Province annually. 

iu Sometimes used by Inspectors of Special Subjects. 

5. As Director of Studies I make a report which is more oral than 
written. It is less compromising and it gives the same result. 
It is to be noted that the School Inspector makes his report 
independently of mine. The Inspector is under the Provincial 
Government while I am appointed by Local Authorities. 

Comments R eg arding Method It, Marks on a Series of Traits or 

Aspects of Teaching 

1. Before giving a rating, a principal and a supervisor has 
observed a teacher usually about three times and have noted 
practices and offered certain suggestions. These cards are 
shown to the teacher although the final evaluation is not. 

Reports are tabulated on the Teacher’s Permanent Record 
Card as a means of off-setting any hasty judgments by either 
teachers or officials.

2. Supervisor and Inspector work together on doubtful cases. 

3* Specific observations are recorded on visits; teacher's work 
is discussed with the principal; report of inspection of school 
is submitted to board and a copy sent to the principal who 
shows each teacher the part applicable to her. At the time of 
visit the work is discussed with the teacher. A teacher's 
increment could be withheld but rarely is in practice. However 
on rare occasions a teacher is asked to resign. 

iu Both superintendent and assistant superintendent observe 

teachers at work. Each gives an independent evaluation. These 
are placed in the teacher's file. As a result of these and 
other information, the teacher is rated as Superior, Good, 

Fair, etc. 

This is semi-confidential. The Boards do not ask for a 
written report, but if there is a request for a report on a 
teacher, it is given verbally. 

Where a teacher requires a written report to the Depart¬ 
ment of Education for certification purposes, a copy of the 
report is mailed to the teacher, and a copy is retained on her 
file in my office. 

Reports or comments by principal on a teacher's work, 
attitude, co-operation, etc. are also placed in her file. 

Since the passing of the tenure act, the dismissal of a 
teacher is rather difficult. Therefore, we have to be careful 
in our selection and observe their work quite carefully during 
the two-year probationary period. 

Before a teacher is dismissed, her work will be observed 
on many occasions, by the assistant superintendent, the 
superintendent, the supervisors, and the principal. The 
recommendation for dismissal is the responsibility of the 
superintendent after consultation with the above. 

We do all we can to help a teacher before considering 
dismissal—and will give her every chance to improve. Her 
weak points will be discussed with her. 

In rating a teacher there are other things we take into 
consideration: (a) Cooperation with the principal (b) Co¬ 
operation with other staff marabers (c) Ability to get along 
with people (d) Interest in school activities outside of the 
classroom. 

Some of these are difficult to measure, but over the 
years they can be observed and one who is satisfactory in the 
above is more valuable to the school. 

5. Our form is patterned on an "Efficiency Report of the San 

Francisco Public Schools". At one time this report was filed 
for each teacher. Of late years it has been felt that the use 
of method 5 is more efficacious. The tendency for free 
comparisons amongst teachers of ratings from this form 
(Method 1*) seemed to stir up senseless animosities and seemed 
somewhat ineffective in achieving its major purpose, i.e. 
encouragement to increase efficiency and effectiveness.

The use of this form is now reserved for cases of inefficiency 
or to protect effective teachers when under fire from outside 
sources or when their effectiveness has been brought into ques¬ 
tion in any way. 

6. This table must be filled in every month by the director of 
each school and returned to the Director of Studies. 

7. The teachers are given a copy of the forms used by the principal 
for judging their work. (Forms enclosed). 

8. A general report on each school and its teaching staff is 
presented to the Board annually by the Public School Inspector, 
who is appointed by the provincial authorities* 

Comments Regarding Method 5, Qualitative Statements About Each Teacher 

1. These are informal written reports based upon visits by an 
inspection officer and the principal. The principal also bases 
judgments on day-to-day contacts with the teacher. 

2. Most principals use this check list or a similar one when 
supervising. As you can see, all items cannot be checked on 
one visit. New teachers coming into the system are given one of 
these forms by most principals and after one visit the two 

of them sit down and discuss the points (or some of them) listed 
here • 

3© As superintendent I am not required in practice to report on 
teachers to anyone. Informal notes are taken during class 
observation concerning physical conditions, personality and 
appearance of teacher, teaching methods, etc. These are sub¬ 
mitted to the teacher only . I do not keep any copy. The notes 
are discussed with the teacher privately after school. 

ii. Inspector visits all teachers and reports to the superintendent 
on the work of all -teachers. Self-evaluation sheets are used 
as a basis of discussion. Principals submit written reports 
on all new teachers. A copy of the report is given to the 
teacher• 

5. These questions deal with concepts of evaluation that are much 
more formal than is the practice in this school system. 

Evaluations are available to the employing Board on request 
theoretically for individual instances or for all employees. 

In practice one or several years may elapse without any such 
request. In most instances the evaluation is in the form of an 
informal discussion with the fields selected by both Super¬ 
intendent and Teacher as the circumstances arise or are 
indicated. Comments are noted at the time, a copy of which is 
retained by each. 

6. Most of my statements are made directly to the teacher as a guide 
to or commendation of good work. When work is entirely unsatis¬ 
factory, the teacher is advised to resign and the trustees ad¬ 
vised to request such action. Generally the teacher makes the 
move.

7. Each inspector, after a class inspection, gives the teacher a 
written report pointing out commendation on certain points, 
offering suggestions for improvement, etc. This is discussed 
with the teacher and always after an inspectional visit, the 
inspector and teacher have a conference. 

8. Our supervisors do make brief written statements concerning 
each teacher’s progress, strengths and weaknesses. The 
substance of their comments is recorded on a form in each 
teacher*s file. 

9* A qualitative report is submitted on each teacher. This report 
on the part of the inspector is ordinarily very short; it 
appears often in the teacher pedagogical notes to which he 
adds a short notation. 

A longer account is not used except one covering the 
whole school or in isolated cases (teachers) whose local 
authority must recognize. 

10. The main basis of our evaluation is the written report of the 
Inspector, supplemented by the report of the principal. In 
this system the number of teachers tends to limit the reporting 
to teachers on probationary appointments. The principals report 
on the full staff each year. Principal submits his report to 
the Inspector. Teachers receive copies. As a rule this is not 
a lengthy report, but at the same time it tries to evaluate 

the learning situation in the terms listed below—Excellent, 

Good, Satisfactory, Fair, Poor. 

11. Reports submitted by the superintendent are not used as a 
means of rating. They are summaries of his observations about 
the effectiveness of the teacher’s work. 

12. In general, this method is used only when a teacher is being 
considered for appointment to an administrative position. 

13* Find enclosed: 

a. Record card used by Superintendent and Assistant Superintendent. 

b. Report form used in April each year. Reports are usually 
required only on teachers during first two years on our 
staff. The Assistant Superintendent or Superintendent 
fills in the bottom half of this sheet. 

Co Reports sent to the Department of Education. 

liu While the Department of Education calls for an annual rating 
based on a five point scale, we are not concerned locally to 
any marked degree with rating as such. Principals submit 
subjective reports and where indicated the inspector submits 
more objective reports. There is little evidence to indicate 
that ’’rating” as such, does much to improve teaching. 

15. Principal reports on all teachers to Inspector (Copy to 
teacher only.) 

Inspector reports on (l) all teachers new to the district, 

(2) all teachers about to receive a higher certificate, 

(3) all teachers for whom a report is requested by the School 
Board, (ii) any others he feels require it.

Report goes to Provincial Department, copies to School Board, 
teacher and principal* 

16* Each report is concluded with a rating on the general learning 
situation as Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Fair or poor* 

17* Classrooms are visited frequently by the inspector and the 

superintendent. The work of the teacher is observed. Examina¬ 
tion is made of the progress and standard of work of the pupils. 
During each visit a form (copy enclosed) is completed by the 
inspector or superintendent. The completed report is shown 
to the teacher and the whole report discussed with him. 

The inspecting officer leaves this form with the principal 
of the school for a few days. The principal studies the con¬ 
tents and discussed the report with the teacher. He then returns 
it to the Superintendent for filing. 

Each year the Board of Education requires the Super¬ 
intendent to comment briefly on all members of the elementary 
school staff to the Public School Management Committee, The 
report to the Committee is very general. It may rate a teacher 
as superior—better than average—average—below average—poor— 
stress strengths and/or weaknesses. The Superintendent may 
recommend (i) dismissal (ii) holding up of salary increment 
(iii) extension of probation—if a probationer (iv) placement 
on permanent staff. 

Our policy is to discuss with teachers concerned our 
recommendations (if any) prior to the meeting with the Com¬ 
mittee. 

18. As a rule this is not a lengthy report, but at some point it 
tries to evaluate the learning situation in the terms listed 
below. 

Comments Regarding Method 6, Appraisal by an Evaluation Board 


1. The method here is that teachers are hired subject to experience 
and qualifications (no scale) assessed by the Board and Principal 
with concurrence of the inspector when necessary, and subsequent 
annual engagements follow if work is satisfactory to the above. 
Needless to say, when there is no scale or grading system of 
qualification (is it possible?), there is no set system of 
evaluation. 

2. Essentially our "evaluation board" is a committee of the local 
school board which has a free hand in the engaging, classifica¬ 
tion, and dismissal of teachers. In the spring, it reviews the 
record of each teacher, recommending re-engagement usually; but 
occasionally advising a teacher that her services will not be 
required the following year. The board (committee) also reviews 
applications from new teachers seeking employment. 

3. We don’t rate teachers on a scale. If promotion is to be 
considered, all assets are considered by a board. 

it. This evaluation board is not officially established as such. It 
operates as a meeting of Chief Inspector and the four inspectors 
when considering (a) appointment of principal, vice-principal.

5* No. 6 in your questionnaire is mainly limited as far as we are 
concerned to the evaluation of personnel who are applying for 
administrative or other special positions. The members of this 
group normally consist of the six top administrative officers. 
Each official makes his appraisal independently but all meet 
together to arrive at a final decision. 

Comments Regarding Method 7, Judgments Based on Cumulative Profes ¬ 

sional Record of the Teacher 

1. Teacher*s history of employment is recorded on a Provincial 

form card which goes from Inq> ector to Inspector as the teacher 

moves from position to position. This information guides us 
in advising Boards to employ, or not to employ new applicants 
for vacancies. It also colors recommendations re promotion 

to Principalship, etc. 

2. This method is used to little extent. 

3. This form of evaluation is used in our system for advancement 

to higher posts within the system. To this point the system 

has been relatively small making it unnecessary to maintain 
cards or records. When necessary the information is garnered 
from various records in our offices. 

iu The School Commission uses the report of the Inspector to base 
its evaluation and appraisal of the teaching personnel. 

Comments Regarding Method 8, Joint Evaluation 

1. Used by principals. 

2. The enclosed self-evaluation form is often used as a basis 
for discussion. These discussions are of an informal nature— 
whether principal-teacher or inspector-teacher. 

3# At the end of formal infection, or as occasion makes it 

advisable, principal and injector discuss teacher’s work and 
decide on suggestions and help to be offered; demonstration 
lessons taught for information of teacher. 

li. Used rarely. 

5. ’’Joint evaluation** procedure used for all teachers inspected 
but written evaluation given only where situation is unsatis¬ 
factory. In other cases evaluation is done by means of oral 
discussion. 

6. The Assistant Supervisor works directly with all elementary 
teachers (50 in number) with curriculum, methods, classroom 
organization, testing program (achievement and remedial). 
Discussions are held by Assistant Supervisor and individual 
teachers regularly, and in particular after each set of tests.

The Assistant Supervisor will discuss individual teachers 
in turn with the Supervisor of Schools* 

Since there are no promotions nor salary increases 
dependent upon ratings, no formal cards are made out. This 
system is small enough so officials have very close contact 
with each teacher. 

In addition monthly meetings are held when classroom 
and educational matters are discussed with teachers acting as 
leaders, 

7. Our joint evaluation procedure consists of a discussion between 
teacher and Inspector regarding the subjects or techniques 
where the work of the classroom can be improved. 

8 . An oral evaluation, 

9. No printed forms used—but many of these points would be 
answered "yes" if asked from a "verbal” rating point of view. 

Comments Regarding Method 9> The Anecdotal Record 


1, The inspector writes down the strengths and weaknesses of the 
teacher observed during the period of inspection. He leaves 
this with the teacher for reference and keeps the carbon copy 
for his file and future reference. 

2. Used by inspectors. 

3* This report is shown to the teacher who signs it before it is 
forwarded to the superintendent. 

I 4 . Notes made during the inspection, critical and commendatory, 
are left with each teacher at the close of my visit. Before 
the next inspection, and before recommendations for up-grading 
certificate, or giving an evaluation to another board, these 
notes are reviewed (i,e, my carbon copies) as basis for the 
next inspection, or an appraisal of teaching ability, to any 
board asking opinion. 

5. Our records are principally background—school records, training, 
special qualifications, hobbies, experience, etc. It includes 

a space for annual rating of a teacher’s work—A, B, C, D, 

6 . The above anecdotal record has been constructed for personal 
use. It has no official status. 

7. A copy of the form used for reporting is attached. 

Comments Regarding Method 10, Cooperative Evaluation 

1. Used by all staff—teacher to superintendent, 

2. Usually based upon needs as teachers see them. 

3. This process has only been in operation for a year and so far 
has only been applied to health and physical education.

lu Staffs are free to discuss changes in organization of curricu¬ 
lum; these are consolidated by the whole public school staff, 
then presented to the inspector and the board for approval* 
Where such re-organization affects the upper grades, the 
secondary school is invited to participate* 

5. Principals and teachers are free to initiate plans aimed at 
raising the standard of teaching, which is another way of 
planning for better learning situations in a classroom* 

Projects re—writing, spelling, mechanical arithmetic 
are common. 

In my opinion, more could be done tc get teachers working 
on behalf of (a) the slow learner (b) the bright child* 

6. We wish to be co-operative but have some misgivings re a flat 
yes or no to many questions of this kind as the nature of the 
problem does not lend itself to an "arithmetical” approach 
and conclusions* 

7* Cooperative Evaluation is not completely established. It 
appears tc work best with talented teachers who are working 
out new aims, objectives and teaching methods* 

8. Curriculum planning and in-service training programmes are 
co-operative ventures and work is done in committees and 
teacher-organized groups. 

9* It should be noted that while evaluation of personnel and 
individual growth are concomitant outcomes of cooperative 
activity, these outcomes are not the primary purposes for which 
curriculum activity is practised here. When groups are brought 
together in our system their activity is primarily for the 
purpose of producing materials they need or to gain better 
control over techniques. To emphasize any other purpose 
would be to endanger the good spirit which now obtains. 

10. The Department of Education provides Courses of Study for 

all grades in the elementary school. Topics listed are sug¬ 
gestive only, however. 

Municipalities are encouraged to set up local curriculum 
committees composed of administrators, principals and teachers 
to develop local courses of study. We have over the years 
many such committees working especially in the Grade 7 to 10 
division. 

In our city we have an extensive in-service training 
programme for teachers conducted as a part of our Adult 
Education programme. Our teachers are encouraged, though 
not required, to take some of these courses. In Art and 
Social Studies the workshop technique is used.
