This study was mad a possible through the 
University of Alberta Research Fund and the Government 
of Alberta, The former provided scholarship money and 
the latter supplied the writer with maintenance at the 
Provincial Mental Hospital, where the work was carried 
on. 

The writer wishes to take this opportunity 
of thanking the Eugenics Board for permitting the use 
of their files, Prof. John Macdonald of the Department 
of Philosophy, and Prof, S.S. Keeping of the Depart¬ 
ment of Mathematics for the constructive criticism 
which they offered throughout the work. In addition 
the writer is deeply grateful to the members of the 
staff throughout the Mental Hygiene Division of the 
Department of Health, and particularly to Dr. R. R. 
MacLean, Medical Superintendent of the Provincial 
Mental Hospital, who assisted in every way possible 
to make each stage of the project less arduous.

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM OF EtJGENICS 

Man has always been interested in improving man, both for 
self-betterment and for race betterment. As his knowledge of physical 
phenomena increased, so also did this interest, until today there are 
numerous branches of science devoted solely to the improvement of man. 

To one of these branches has been applied the term "Eugenics* 1 • It in¬ 
cludes the study of conditions that may improve the physical, mental 
and moral qualities of future generations. In concerning itself with 
the innate physical and mental qualities of mankind and how they are in¬ 
herited applied eugenics is making a conscious effort to produce some 
improvement in the human race. 

This comparatively new science, gaining its initial impetus 
through the discovery of the Mendelian laws of heredity, might be con¬ 
sidered the intellectual approach to the problem of the survival of the 
fittest. Not only has medical science prolonged the life of the caco- 
genic people who would otherwise not have reached the reproductive 
period, but birth control measures, which are now nearing perfection, 
are being adopted by those of superior stock, while those of inferior 
stock are unable to procure the necessary information or to apply it. 

In addition, wars no longer result in the elimination of the weak but 
require the sacrificing of the best human male stock. Together, these 
tendencies have resulted in a differential birthrate which throws an 
alarming imbalance in favor of the inferior group. (1,2) Thus definite

and conscious measures to offset these influences have become im¬ 
perative, (5) 

Methods to achieve race betterment may be either positive 
in direction, seeking to increase the propagation of superior stock, 
or they may be negative, endeavouring to reduce the fecundity of those 
with inferior endowment. Ten such measures have been put forth with 
varying degrees of success and practicability. (4) They include five 
of a positive nature: eugenic education, general environmental improve¬ 
ment, laissez-faire, systems of mating designed to conceal defective 
strains, and scientific breeding; and five of a negative nature: neo- 
malthusianism, restrictive marriage laws and customs, institutionaliza¬ 
tion or segregation, euthanasia and sterilization. 

Laissez-faire, based on the premise that the struggle for 
existence will, of itself, result in a natural selection of the best 
■fcyp e s> and neo-malthusianism, theoretically one of the most acceptable 
and effective methods, have both shown themselves in practice to work 
in the opposite direction to that intended by the eugenicists. (1,2,3) 
The two systematic positive theories, are, as yet, too foreign to the 
current concepts of individual and family rights to be acceptable in 
actual practice in this country at least. Euthanasia likewise, has 
never gained public favor, although it has been practised in isolated 
instances from early times to the present. (It is reported that Ger¬ 
many, of late, has adopted these methods as state policies. (5)) 

This, then, leaves two positive methods and three negative 
that the state might adopt in a eugenics policy. Both the dissemination

of literature on eugenics and the improvement of general living conditions 
have increased as educational facilities have been extended; but their 
eugenical results are haphazard in that they depend to a great extent 
upon individual application. Well functioning marriage laws and customs 
can do much to' safeguard the well-being of future generations by pro¬ 
hibiting consanguineous marriages and the self-perpetuation of defects 
that results from such inbreeding. In addition, by barring the mating 
of individuals afflicted with certain infectious diseases or marked 
mental defect, similarly afflicted offspring might be prevented. 

To date this method has been universally used on a more or less limited 
basis, (3) Segregation is, indeed, effective in those cases directly 
concerned, but it cannot hope to include all cacogenic people. In 
doing so it would be an unnecessary expense to the state not only in¬ 
volving the cost of permanent care for these individuals but also pre¬ 
venting the gainful employment of those who might otherwise become 
partially useful members of society, (3,6) The last method, that of 
human sterilization, has enjoyed varying degrees of acceptance among 
different peoples. With little physical risk to the individual, it 
makes procreation impossible and consequently the transmission of de¬ 
fects to future generations - yet in no way need it impair the social 
or sexual life of the individual, (7) However, sterilization is limited 
in its application and since its results are irrevocable, it requires 
close supervision. 

It is with this method as it has been applied in the Province 
of Alberta that this study is concerned. Its supervision has been a

function of the state as a policy in the best interests of its people* 
However, it should be remembered that, in a full program of eugenics, 
sterilization should be considered only as a supplementary measure to the 
others given above, and not as a panacea in itself.

CHAPTER II 


THE HISTORY OF HUMAN STERILIZATION 


The practice of human sterilization has had a long history, 
varying in its purpose from that of inflicting punishment to that of 
producing eugenic and therapeutic results, and in its methods from those 
of crude, barbarian customs to those of aseptic surgical techniques• 

There seems to be no period during the history of man when asexualiza¬ 
tion has not been resorted to for one reason or another. Nevertheless 
human sterilization as a means of bettering the race is of recent origin. 

Switzerland is reputed to be the first country in which a move¬ 
ment for eugenical sterilization was started, - and that in 1883. (l) 
However, as far as is known, the practice was first legalized in 1907 by 
the State of Indiana, where the then new method of vasectomy had systemat¬ 
ically been performed on boys in the State Reformatory since 1899. (2) 

Up to 1941, twenty-nine states had passed eugenic sterilization laws. (3) 
These laws all vary. Some require the written consent of all proposed 
for the operation; others make the operation compulsory for certain types 
of cases. Some limit access to the operation to those in whom the defect 
has been proven to be hereditary, whereas others make provisions for those 
incapable of adequately bringing up children even though the defect may 
not be transmitted. Again, some states allow only the simple operation, 
which results solely in a permanent inability to beget children, while 
others permit complete asexualization in certain cases. Generally, how¬ 
ever, the methods of administering the laws are similar, inasmuch as It

is customary for a group of physicians, including one or more psychia¬ 
trists, to recommend cases to a committee specially appointed for the 
purpose of studying each case to determine its suitability for the 
operation, and the committee thereupon to direct an independent surgeon 
to perform the necessary operations. 

As far as the other countries of the world are concerned the 
history of the movement presents somewhat the same picture, with some 
nations sanctioning the practice and others remaining aloof. Acceptance, 
too,, has been as varying in degree as among the United States. The 
totalitarian states have probably adopted the measure in its most extreme 
form: Germany, since 1933, has had laws making compulsory the steriliza¬ 
tion of the f, insane, feebleminded, epileptics, criminals, syphilitics, 
sex perverts, and those afflicted with incurable hereditary ailments". 

(4,2) England represents the other extreme: having admitted numerous ad¬ 
vantages which probably would result from such legislation, she has 
failed to enact any such. (4,5) 

In this checkered history, Alberta finds herself the first 
place in the British Commonwealth of Nations to have adopted any Steriliza¬ 
tion Act. Her initial legislation in this field was in 1928, to which an 
amendment was made in 1937. British Columbia remains the only other 
Canadian province with provision for sexual sterilization on eugenic 
grounds, but her law has been comparatively inactive. (6) 

As far as can be ascertained under present war-time conditions, 
the most comprehensive studies of the results of any of these laws have 
been made in the States of California and South Dakota. These investiga-

tions, however, reveal sufficient irrefutable conclusions to form a 
standard for programs in other centres* Indeed, so conclusive are 
some of their results, that should other communities find themselves 
with less beneficial results from their own Acts, it would be well for 
them to examine their whole eugenics program before denouncing any 
particular procedure! With this in mind frequent reference is made 
later in this study to the report by the Human Betterment Foundation 
of California* (7)

THE ALBERTA ACT: ITS PROVISIONS AHD ADMINISTRATION 


Before the drafting of the Alberta Act, legal opinion was ob¬ 
tained as to the constitutionality of such an Act by a provincial legis¬ 
lature. This opinion being favorable, as was also the medical opinion 
of leading psychiatrists, as to the advisability of such a eugenical 
measure, numerous lay organizations brought pressure to bear on the 
legislature, (l) The whole question was discussed thoroughly by that 
body at its session in 1927, and in 1928 a Bill was brought before the 
house which led to the passing of The Sexual Sterilization Act in March 
of that year. 

The provisions of this Act were brief and simple, laying a 
sound basis for further legislation and education in this field. (2) In 
essence these provisions are: * 

That a Board of four persons be appointed to supervise the 

Act | 

That the medical-officer-in-charge might present to the Board 
for examination, any patient about to be discharged from a Mental 
Hospital; 

That the Board might direct surgical operation for sexual 
sterilization on those cases they unanimously agreed would otherwise 
probably incur the risk of transmitting the disability to their pro¬ 
geny were they discharged. 

That the consent of the patient, (or, failing him because of 
incompetency, his guardian or next-of-kin) be required before the per¬ 
formance of the operation; 

That a competent surgeon be appointed by the Board to perform 
the operations it directs; 

That such a surgeon should not be liable to any civil action 
by reason of such operation.

The Board appointed by the Act, was the sole authority vested with the 
power to sanction operations for eugenical sexual sterilization within 
this Province. It must always be composed of two medical practitioners 
nominated by the Senate of the University of Alberta and the Council 
of the College of Physicians respectively, and two persons, other than 
medical practitioners, well-known and of high repute. Although pro¬ 
vision was made for the appointment of successors by the Lieutenant- 
Governor-in-Council, nevertheless the terms of office of the original 
members were not specified. 

At an early meeting, the Board selected its own chairman and 
honorary secretary from its own membership. It has been known as the 
Eugenics Board for the Province of Alberta since 1929. Meetings have 
been held quarterly, at one or more of the mental institutions in the 
Province. The personnel of the Board has remained constant with the 
exception of two very brief periods: one In 1930 when a member was 
absent from the Province for one meeting; the second, in 1937 and 1938 
when another was ill. From 1938 on, the Chief Social Worker to the 
Mental Hygiene Clinics has acted as Honorary Secretary to the Board 
following the resignation of that office by the former member-secretary. 
There has been an honorarium associated with membership since the Board’s 
inception, but it was not until 1942 that any remuneration was accorded 
to the secretary as such. 

All operations were performed in approved hospitals, specifically 
designated by the Board for each case, until September, 1933, at which time 
a surgical unit was equipped at the Provincial Mental Hospital, Ponoka.

Since that time, this unit has been used, at public expense, for all the 
eugenic operations, except in rare instances when requests have been 
made by the patients in favor of some other approved hospital. In such 
cases, the patient himself bears the cost. The surgeons have at all 
times been specialists, and since 1955, have been those appointed as 
surgeons to the Provincial Mental Hospital itself, and have received 
honorariums as such. The type of operation to be performed was not 
specified by the Act. With few exceptions however, these have been 
either vasectomy in the case of the male, or salpingectomy in the female. 
The former operation is a simple one with little risk, and need not in¬ 
capacitate the patient at all. (5,4) However, as a precautionary measure, 
it has been the custom to keep these patients in bed for a few days. The 
female operation is somewhat more serious as it necessitates a laparotomy. 
Nevertheless, it incurs no more risk than that of child-birth itself, and 
where the physical condition of the patient is good, seldom requires a 
convalescence of more than two weeks. (5,4) Both these operations in¬ 
volve the severing of the ducts leading from the gonads, and have no mu¬ 
tilating or inhibiting effect. There have been a few cases, however, in 
which the libido of the patient has been excessive, and the Board has 
directed the castration of them, by means of an orchidectomy (male) or an 
oophorectomy (female). While more radical in their results, these opera¬ 
tions too incur but little risk. 

By various Orders-in-Council the meaning of "Mental Hospitals" 
referred to in the Act came to include the various psychopathic wards which 
have from time to time been operating in Edmonton, Calgary and Lethbridge,

along with the Provincial Training School and certain training homes* 

This enabled the presentation of cases coming within the meaning of the law, 
but not actually residing within a mental hospital according to its former 
meaning. 

The classes of persons coming within the scope of this act 

were: (5) 

"Patients who are convalescent from a psychosis. 

"Patients sufficiently improved from a psychosis to justify 
discharge with or without supervision. 

"Patients who, though unimproved, might be cared for outside 
an institution. 

"Mental defectives of all grades whose discharge from in¬ 
stitutional care might be reasonably considered, were the 
danger of reproduction removed." 

The psychiatrists have made it their policy to exercise the utmost care in 
selecting suitable cases for presentation. It would seem largely due to 
this fact that the administration of the Act has been so smooth to date. 
However, in those cases where some aspect has been somewhat obscure in its 
interpretation, legal rulings have been obtained from the Department of 
the Attorney-General before proceeding with the examination. In this way 
certain precedents have been established. 

In 1934, Dr. G. A. Baragar, Commissioner of Mental Institutions 
and Director of Mental Health for Alberta, along with other members of his 
staff, prepared a report of the work of the Board to that date. (5) A re¬ 
view 7 of this will show that up to that time the Mental Hygiene Clinics 
(now Guidance Clinics) were able to keep in touch with the majority of the 
discharged patients, and the results of sterilization were found to be 
similar to those in California with regard to the moral adjustment of the

post-operative eases, (5) Since that time, however, the work of the 
Clinics has steadily increased, so that the pressure of their own current 
work precludes the supervision of Eugenics Board cases other than those 
who come within their own clientele. This lack of supervising personnel 
in the provincial eugenics program would seem to limit the effectiveness 
of the Sterilization Act very definitely (5), as well as to hinder the 
securing of accurate data for the further study of the problem. This 
latter condition will be mentioned in the following chapter. 

Following the publication of Dr, Baragar* s report, further in¬ 
terest in this field became apparent along with the need of certain reforms 
to the Act, As a consequence, the Legislative Assembly passed an amendment 
in 1957, (6) **In the original Act the danger of the transmission of the 
’defect 1 was the criterion® In view of the amendments, however, cases 
where procreation might be attended with ’mental injury to the patient’ 
may also be recommended for sterilization, — It is (also) no longer neces¬ 
sary that this (possibility of discharge) be taken into consideration, and 
certain cases may be sterilized in which there is no likelihood of discharge 
from the hospital In the ordinary way,” (7) Further, the amendment dif¬ 
ferentiates between the status of the mentally defective group and that of 
the psychotic: it is no longer necessary to have the consent of the former 
before directing the operation to be performed. It also made possible the 
presentation of cases directly from the Mental Hygiene Clinics when the 
Medical-Officer-in-Charge considered it advisable. In addition, civil 
action against any of the individuals concerned with the administration of 
the Act, was made impossible. Together, these amendments constituted a

considerable step forward towards a full eugenics program. 

In 1942, on the suggestion of the Eugenics Board, an addi¬ 
tional Amendment was passed extending the availability of eugenical 
sterilization to include such non-psychotic individuals, who are not 
mentally defective, as express their own willingness for the operation 
and are suffering from any of a certain group of hereditary diseases 
which usually lead to marked mental and physical deterioration. (8) 

The presentation to, and the examination by, the Eugenics 
Board has followed a rigid routine. The recommendation of two psy¬ 
chiatrists has been required, along with a concise but full history of 
the family, and of the personal development of the patient. These 
have been prepared by either the psychiatrists or the social workers, 
and have been summarized by the secretary according to a given outline. 
All procedures and directions have been made in writing on forms approved 
by the Department of the Attorney General. These forms have gone through 
numerous revisions since 1929, and there are appended to this chapter, 
copies of those currently in use (1941). The first is a copy of the 
formal recommendation of the psychiatrists; the next, the decision of 
the Board; then the direction of the Board to the surgeon; followed by 
the report of the operation; and lastly, a copy of the consent form. 

These forms are preceded by a sample summary sheet, and are followed 
by copies of the Act and its Amendments.

1928 

CHAPTER 37. 

The Sexual Sterilization Act 


(Assented to March 21, 1928.) 


HIS MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Legislative Assembly of the Province of Alberta, enacts 
as follows: 

1. This Act may be cited as " The Sexual Sterilization Act ." 

2. . In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires - 

(a) "Mental Hospital" shall mean a hospital within the 
meaning of The Mental Diseases Act: 

(b) "Minister" shall mean the Minister of Health. 

3. (1) For the purpose of this Act, a Board is hereby 
created, which shall consist of the following four per¬ 
sons: 

Dr. E. Pope, Edmonton. 

Dr. E. G. Mason, Calgary. 

Dr. J. M. McEachran, Edmonton. 

Mrs. Jean H. Field, Kinuso. 

(2) The successors of the said members of the Board shall 
from time to time, be appointed by the Lieutenant Governor 
in Council, but two of the said Board shall be medical prac¬ 
titioners nominated by the Senate of the University of 
Alberta and the Council of the College of Physicians respec¬ 
tively, and two shall be persons other than medical practi¬ 
tioners, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council. 

4. When it is proposed to discharge any inmate of a mental 
hospital, the Medical Superintendent or other officer in 
charge thereof may cause such inmate to be examined by or 
in the presence of the board of examiners. 

5. If upon such examination, the board is unanimously of 
opinion that the patient might safely be discharged if the 
danger of procreation with its attendant risk of multipli¬ 
cation of the evil by transmission of the disability to 
progeny were eliminated, the board may direct in writing 
such surgical operation for sexual sterilization of the 
inmate as may be specified in the written direction and 
shall appoint some competent surgeon to perform the opera¬ 
tion. 

6. Such operation shall not be performed unless the in¬ 
mate, if in the opinion of the board, he is capable of 
giving consent, has consented thereto, or where the 
board is of opinion that the inmate is not capable of

CHAPTER IV 

THE PRESENT STUDY : ITS PURPOSE. SCOPE ABD METHODS 

From the present study it is hoped that a clear and concise 
summary of the work done by the Eugenics Board for the Province of 
Alberta, will be made available so that, should future studies be made 
in this field, there will be little or no laborious groundwork to cover 
before an analysis can be attempted. The number of cases examined by 
the Board had become so great that ready comprehension of the raw mater¬ 
ial accumulated on the files was no longer possible. It seemed expedient 
that a summary be made before the second decade of the operation of the 
Act got too far under way. 

At 'the outset of the project a summary sheet was drafted and 
printed so that it would contain all the pertinent iformation concerning 
the cases, without being too large for ready use. The filling in of this 
sheet proved to be the most arduous and time-consuming part of the. work. 
The basic information was not always included in the Eugenics Board 
files themselves and it was often necessary to refer back to the ori¬ 
ginal file of the patient. These files are housed at either the Pro¬ 
vincial Mental Hospital, the Provincial Training School, the Provincial 
Mental Institute, or at one of the Guidance Clinics operating through¬ 
out the Province. This incomplete transference of file records from one 
office to another would seem to be the direct result of the insufficient 
personnel that has been associated with the Eugenics Board work, (There 
has been only the one honorary secretary, with the aid of one steno¬ 
grapher part of the time, to be responsible for the clerical work.)

The sheet, a copy of which follows on the next page, was 
found to be satisfactory on the whole, but had some limitations* The 
column which has been of least value is that concerned with the re¬ 
sidence of the patient prior to institutionalization* The original 
records varied a good deal in their methods of recording this, in some 
instances giving the residence of the parents, in others, the tempor¬ 
ary abode of a transient* It was impossible to differentiate these 
methods and the column was not used* 

The column headed "Nationality” also caused considerable 
difficulty as it was felt that the data on the records were not very 
dependable* It seemed that "nationality” varied according to the status 
of that nation in current public opinion* This was brought out in 
several families in which the various members gave their nationalities 
as "Canadian”, "Ukrainian”, and "Polish"* It was, therefore, considered 
more accurate and of more significance to tabulate the birthplaces of the 
fathers of all those bom in Alberta* Vs'hile this has the same disadvan¬ 
tage as "Nationality", along with the additional one that certain European 
territories are continually changing their status, nevertheless it gives 
a better picture of the areas of the world from which these patients, or 
their parents, have come. The results might then be of some definite aid 
in evaluating the existing immigration laws of this country* 

The "Convalescent Period" column was also found to be without 
the possibilities of this study: it would have necessitated the expenditure ^ 
of considerable time in searching the records at the approved hospitals 
utilized prior to 1935, as well as those of the surgical vrard at the Pro¬ 
vincial Mental Hospital. Miile such information would be of prime i.m-

portance for a medical or economic review of the work, the gathering of 
it was not felt justified at present, because of the time involved in 
travelling. 

The data concerning the periods of residence in institutions 
are also considered inaccurate, and no summarizing work has been done 
with it. It is known that the police and gaol records of some of the 
cases have not been fully given for one reason or another. Again, it 
might be pointed out, that lack of personnel in the whole Mental Hygiene 
Division has limited the sources of information to the patients them¬ 
selves in the majority of cases, and the obtaining of pertinent facts 
from field investigations has been possible only in the minimum of ur¬ 
gent eases. 

The information concerning the male eases was at all times 
kept separate from that of the female cases. It was then tabulated ac¬ 
cording to various classifications, and the distributions were arranged 
according to the different characteristics. The smoothing method used 
in the Age Distribution was that of a running average over three-year 
groups. This simplified the graphs without sacrificing too much detail. 
Where possible comparisons were made between the male and fema,le groups, 
and significant differences computed when it was considered necessary. 
'The means and standard deviations are given for some of the curves, but 
where percentages seemed of more significance these were found. 


(All tabulations were done on large sheets with differential diagnoses 
included, so that the data of future years may be quickly inserted. 

The same scheme was used for the computations. The tables and results 
which follow are a condensation of these, the originals remaining on 
file at the Provincial Mental Hospital.)

CHAPTER V 


THE PRESENT STUDY: THE SUMMARY OF THE CASES 


Tables I and II 

Graphs I 

These first two tables are self-explanatory as to their 
content. However it should be noted that Table II is the only 
one in this summary in which the operations are recorded accord¬ 
ing to the year in which they were performed. In all the succeed¬ 
ing tables the year given indicates the year in which the case was 
actually presented to the Board and passed by it regardless of when 
the operation was carried out. 

In examining the curves it will be seen that there is a 
sharp increase in the number of cases presented, and in the opera¬ 
tions performed, during the year 1934, Without drawing any definite 
conclusions it might be pointed out that this year coincides with the 
first intensive review of the work of the Board, the results of which 
indicated the beneficial effects the Act already had had. This was 
also the first full year that the surgical unit at the Provincial 
Mental Hospital was in operation. In addition it was about this time 
that further agitation for amendments to the Act w as started, and 
it might have been that the Board consciously endeavored to determine 
approximately, how many cases might justly come within the scope of 


the Act at that time

Tables HI, IV, V, and VI 
Graphs II and III 

This set of tables and graphs further describes the work of 
the Board year by year. It will be seen from them that the rapid in¬ 
crease in presentations during 1934 and 1935, which was revealed in the 
preceding tables, was due primarily to the increase in the number of 
psychotic patients presented. The number of mentally defective male 
cases also increased at this time, but the number of mentally defective 
female cases remained fairly constant. It is interesting to note that 
the curves for the eases suffering from both psychosis and mental de¬ 
ficiency have certain characteristics in common with each of these 
other curves. 

It will be noticed that the percentages of male cases under¬ 
going operation in each of the diagnostic groups have been less on the 
whole than those of female cases in the corresponding groups. However, 
in both sexes there has been a distinct drop in the percentage of psy¬ 
chotic patients operated upon as the years have gone by. Among the 
males, there was a sudden temporary decrease in the rate during 1955. 
Again, the rates for the psychotic-mental-defective groups lie between 
those of the other types. 

As far as these graphs show, the amendment to the Act in 1937 
had little effect upon the proportion of operations among the mentally 
defective groups. However, this is not actually the case for at least 
two reasons: There are some 12 male cases, and 10 female cases who were 
first presented before 1957 and have retained their original number and

date although the operation was performed subsequent to representation 
after the amendment was passed* Secondly, the operation will yet be 
performed on some individuals presented in the last few years* (One 
such operation has already been performed in 1942* This circumstance 
must also be taken into consideration when examination is made of the 
other groups*) 

In addition, this statement must also be considered unfair 
without an examination of the admission records at the Provincial 
Mental Hospital where it is thought that, because of policy changes, 
fewer of this group have been institutionalized there, even though 
there has not been a corresponding increase at the Provincial Training 
School. This change might quite possibly have decreased the number of 
mentally defective individuals coming to the attention of the psychiatrists, 
and also have limited them to the type who had previously expressed un¬ 
willingness to be sterilized* 

It must also be remembered that, since 1939, the depletion of 
staff as members have joined the armed services has decreased the time 
per patient of the remaining staff, and this will have an effect on the 
functioning of the Act. 


Throughout this summary little will be said concerning the "Other Condi¬ 
tions" groups apart from acknowledging their existence. It represents 
only a few cases, and such fluctuations as might be sho?/n on a graph 
would, therefore, probably be more apparent than real. 

The differences between the groups of cases with the same diagnosis but 
of different sex will be brought out more clearly in subsequent tables.

The age of the male and female eases presented and passed 
were tabulated separately and their distributions compared by 
"Student*s** method, with the following results: 


Male Cases Passed 

Mean age, 28.17 years,

This gives the probability of these two distributions being samples of the 
same parent population as very close to zero, and might be considered as 


evidence that there is a significant difference between the average ages 
of the male and female cases presented to the Board. 

Further evidence on this circumstance comes as a result of an 


examination of later tables

In an effort to discover why there should be a sex dif¬ 
ference in the ages of the cases at presentation, tabulations were 
made according to diagnosis as well as according to age and sex. 
Again four major classes were taken for the diagnostic grouping: 
those suffering from a psychosis, those who were mentally defective, 
those suffering from a combination of these, and those listed as

From these measures of probability it would seem that the only 
diagnostic group in which there is a significant difference between the 
mean ages of the two sexes* is the psychotic one. The difference among 
the mentally defective appears to lie only in the number from each sex 
presented to the Board. Little sex difference is shown in the other two 
groups. 

In order to determine whether the differences in the psychotic 
groups could be resolved down to differences in emphases on types selected, 
the two largest sub-groups were compared, i.e. the schizophrenic and the 
manic-depressive psychoses. The age distributions for these are given in 


Tables IXa and Xa,

The results of this comparison are: 

Mean age, schizophrenic male cases passed, 30.19 years. 

Mean age, schizophrenic female cases passed, 27.98 years. 

Standard deviation, schiz. male cases passed, 7.4 years. 

Standard deviation, schiz. female cases passed, 6.5 years.

Mean age, man.-dep. female cases passed, 38.75 years. 

Standard deviation, man.-dep. male cases passed, 7.3 years. 

Standard deviation, man.-dep. female cases passed, 7.0 years 

t = 1.15 

Degrees of freedom = 136 
0.2<P < 0.3 

This leads one to the conclusion that there are significant 
differences in the age distributions of some of the psychotic groups 
presented to the Board, and all sex differences are not due to dif¬ 
ferences in emphases alone, although such do exist. 

On the whole, then, such sex differences as do exist among 
the different diagnostic groups presented to the Board, appear to be 
of the following nature: 

1. Approximately one and two-thirds as many mentally defec¬ 
tive female persons have been presented to the Board as male, but the 
ages of the two sexes have been about the same. (This age is consider¬ 
ably lower than the age at presentation of the psychotic patients as 

a whole. Consequently, the greater relative number of female defective 
eases explains in a large measure the lower average age of all female 
X cases than that of all male cases.) 

2. The most significant sex differences, both in age and 
number, appear to be among the psychotic groups. Twice as many female

manic-depressive cases have been presented as male cases, but their 
ages have been similar. The schizophrenic males outnumber the females 
in a similar ratio, and are two years older on the whole. 

These sex differences may be the result of any of three 
factors: differences in availability for presentation of individuals 
suffering from the various conditions, actual differences in distribu¬ 
tion of mental disorders among the general population, or differences 
in the policy adopted in selecting cases from the two sexes. Nothing con¬ 
clusive can be stated on this matter without a further study of the ad¬ 
mission records of the various institutions as well as a study of the 
population as a whole, but there are certain possible conditions which 
would suggest that such influences are operating, both together and in 
opposition to each other. 

The general public recognizes the presence of mental deficiency 
earlier in life than it does a psychotic condition, and the individuals 
so afflicted are brought to the attention of the psychiatrists at a cor¬ 
respondingly earlier age. In addition, the parents or guardians of fe¬ 
male mentally defective persons more frequently acknowledge the dangers 
and disadvantages attendant to procreation among them, than do the parents 
of similarly afflicted male persons. Upon developing a psychosis, a man 
not only loses his economic value, but is feared by the community to a 
greater degree than the psychotic woman. For these reasons he is in¬ 
stitutionalized more often, while the woman is tolerated in the home. 

These are the circumstances which operate from the outside to cause dif¬ 
ferences in the availability of the two sex groups. 

It is the contention of some psychiatrists that women are more 

prone to develop psychoses than are men because of the more dramatic

physical changes in their lives, and that such psychoses follow 
different pattern groups in the two sexes* 

In selecting cases suitable for presentation the psychiatrists 
take into consideration the possibility of discharge of the patient. In 
the schizophrenic group, when once his propensities are known and the 
subsequent fear of what his actions might be alleviated, the male 
patient is more easily rehabilitated outside at some farm laboring job 
than is the female schizophrenic patient for^there is usually no option 
but to be returned to the responsibilities of the care of the home she 
has left. This decreases her possibility of discharge. In the manic- 
depressive group, where the rate of discharge is higher for both male 
and female, another factor becomes more evident: child-birth and fear 
of pregnancy may both act to precipitate future attacks, and the de¬ 
sirability of eliminating these makes the presentation of the female 
cases in this group more imperative. 

Thus we must look to social conditions, inherent differences 
and psychiatric prognoses to explain the differences in the types of 
cases presented to the Board®

Table XI and XII 
Graph VII 


In discussing the operations that have been performed at the 
direction of the Eugenics Board, it was felt that the relative frequency 
with which each type of case had undergone such operation was of more 
significance than the absolute number. For this reason, the number of 
operations were shown on the graph as percentages of the cases passed 
at that year level* (These percentages were calculated from the three- 
year running averages.) 

The percentage of operations performed at each year level is 
less for the males than the females. If the end ages are excluded, 
where there are only a few cases, the graph shows the percentages to 
decrease gradually for the female cases as their ages at presentation 
increase. The decrease comes a little more suddenly for the men and 
then remains fairly constant after 25 years. The percentage of all 
the male cases who have undergone operation, is thirty-six; that of 
the females, fifty-nine. 

Of these 805 operations, 298 have been vasectomies and 
seventeen orchidectomies, 480 salpingectomies and ten oophorectomies. 
Three of the women died immediately following operation; two of 
bronchopneumonia, both epileptics one with mental deficiency and the 
other with psychotic episodes; the third from acute' bronchitis, with 
mongolism as a remote cause, A defective male with a deformed chest 
also died having developed bronchopneumonia following the operation. 

One man impregnated his wife a year after the operation, and he under¬ 
went a second operation. One of the female cases was delivered of a 
female child three years following operation. One male case, who has 
since been deported, was found to have been previously sterilized in 


the United States.

Just as breaking down the whole groups of presented cases 
into their diagnostic groups gives explanations for certain character¬ 
istics of the original curves, so by studying the relative frequency 
according to the diagnosis of the cases concerned, explanations be¬ 
come apparent for the two major characteristics of the preceding curves. 
The female groups all show percentages running higher than the male 
percentages on the whole. The female mental defective group maintains 
a higher and steadier proportion of operations at all ages than does 
any other group, the percentage of all such cases undergoing opera¬ 
tion being ninety-two. The percentage of all similar male cases un¬ 
dergoing operation is eighty, there being a tendency to a steady de¬ 
crease as the age level increases, provided the end ages are excluded 
from consideration because of the small number. However, a rather 
marked minimum point appears at the twenty-four year level. The 
psychotic groups for both sexes show the lowest percentages of all, with 
a slight tendency to increase with age on the part of the males, and 
a slight tendency to decrease with age on the part of the females. 

The percentages for cases suffering from both these conditions lie 
generally between those for the first two groups, with considerably 
more fluctuation. 

In accounting for the main sex difference in the proportion 
of operations performed, the old attitude towards castration and its 
influence persisting in present day attitudes, must be kept in mind, 
as well as the influence of the less apparent desirability of steriliz-

ation in the man. Inasmuch as consents are necessary before the per¬ 
formance of the operation upon psychotic individuals, the lower per¬ 
centage of operations among them than among the mentally defective is 
not surprising. But it is somewhat obscure as to why the proportions 
among the psychosis-with-mental-deficiency group should range between 
the two rather than maintain a level approximating that for the mental 
defective group, when both classes come within the scope of the amend¬ 
ment. It might be that the presence of the psychosis influences the 
attitude of the patient and'where' marked antagonism is manifested the 
operation is deferred for psychiatric reasons. In addition there is 
a difference in discharge rates which would have some bearing on this 
phase of the work, (see Tables XXI & XXII)

These tables are self-explanatory and require little comment 
by way of interpretation. The accuracy of the data might be questioned 
to a degree, particularly in Table XVI, where the information pertaining 
to illegitimacy comes chiefly from the patients themselves, who, for 
obvious reasons, are loathe to divulge it.

elucidation.)

Tables XVII, XVIII, XIX & XX 
Maps I, II, III & IV 

The tables showing the nativity of the cases presented to 
the Board, and of the fathers of those born in Alberta, are of con¬ 
siderable general interest. That over one-half of the male cases, 
and nearly two-thirds of the female cases were born in Alberta is not 
surprising in view of the age distribution. However, that twice as 
many men, and nearly as many women, have come from Central European 
states, as from the British Empire, - exclusive of .Canada, suggests the 
possible existence of four conditions: that there are a greater number 
of Central European immigrants settling in this province than Britisher 
that the worst stock of the Central European immigrants settle in this 
province in greater proportions than do British degenerate stock, that 
Central Europeans are not examined as rigorously for inherent mental 
weakenss as are the Britishers, and/or that the Central Europeans are 
less able to adjust in this province. In order to evaluate these 
suggestion^ comparisons would have to be based on a. knowledge of the 
immigration trends for the past one hundred years, as well as a know¬ 
ledge of the population trends within Canada itself. Nevertheless it 
should be pointed out that had adequate psychometric examinations been 
made at the port of entry, there might have been twenty-four per cent 
fewer mental defective of both sexes, presented to the Eugenics Board 
from 1929 to 1941. 

When the nativity tables of the.fathers of Alberta-born cases 
are examined, a somewhat similar distribution is found, Central Europe

having provided an almost equal member of fathers of male cases, and 
one-half as many of female cases, as the British Empire* Looking at 
the situation from another angle: while three-quarters of the male 
cases, and four-fifths of the female cases were born in English speak¬ 
ing countries, only two-thirds of the Alberta-born males and four- 
fifths the Alberta-born females, had fathers born in English speaking 
countries, (This, of course, includes those born in the United States 
and does not necessarily imply that English was the mother tongue.)

Tables XXI & XXII 

These tables show the disposition as of December 31, 1941, of 
the cases presented to the Board from 1929 to that time. In doing so, 
they reflect the adequacy of the administration of the Sterilization 
Act as it now stands, and offer explanations for certain features 
which were pointed out in previous tables. 

Of the cases who have undergone operation, only among the 
male cases suffering from a psychosis and those afflicted with a 
psychosis and mental deficiency, are the number still institutionaliz¬ 
ed in excess of the number discharged. On the other hand, of those not 
sterilized, the number of discharges are greater than the number still 
institutionalized among both the male and female mental defectives and 
those suffering from '’other conditions" as well as among the female 
psychotic group. Of the 1692 cases presented and passed by the Board 
in this period, 344, or twenty per cent have been out of institutions 
all or part of the time without being operated upon. Of the thirty- 
seven mentally defective individuals who go to make up this group, 
fifteen males and thirteen females were presented before the first 
amendment to the Act was passed; two males eloped soon after pre¬ 
sentation before arrangements were completed for their operations, 
two females were considered physically unfit and the remaining two 
men and three women "refused". There is reason to believe that of 
those still in institutions a number will be operated upon before 


being discharged.

Family Charts A, B, C, & D 


The family charts which follow were chosen arbit¬ 
rarily from those histories that gave the most information 
concerning the relatives of patients sterilized. It is not 

suggested that they might represent a fair sample of the cases 

, * 

undergoing operation, but that they do illustrate the fact 
that cacogenic lines are being established in Alberta. 

Family Chart A is, perhaps, the most nearly complete 
of all the histories on file. This is probably due to the 
fact that 11-15 of that family was one of the first cases to 
have been presented to the Board and there has been more time 
for information on his family to have accumulated. At the 
time of his presentation, little more was known than that his 
father, mother and wife were inmates of the Provincial Mental 
Hospital, and his daughter an inmate of the Provincial Train¬ 
ing School. This family illustrates the association which 
has often been suggested to exist, between the presence of 
mental deficiency and mental disease in the same family. 

Family Chart B shows a regular recurrence of men¬ 
tal abnormalities through four generation 33 

Family Charts C & D are suggestive of a relation¬ 
ship between the presence of mental deficiency and illegita- 
macy and promiscuity.

CHAPTER VI 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

From the foregoing study a number of interesting facts stand 
out. The Province of Alberta was the first part of the British Empire 
to adopt a Sterilization Act, and to appoint a special Board to be in 
charge of its administration. The functioning of this Board has been 
smooth, and there has been the utmost of cooperation from the institu¬ 
tions concerned. 

To the end of 1941 there were passed by this body, 868 men 
and 824 women as being suitable for sterilization on eugenics grounds. 
Of these, 315 men and 490 women have actually been sterilized. The 
ages of these persons are distributed throughout the. reproductive 
period with the mean ages for men and women being 28 years and 25 
years respectively. The proportion of operations performed decreases 
in general as the age at presentation increases. There are some sex 
differences as a result of several external and internal influences. 

The most noteworthy of these differences are the higher proportion 
of female defective patients passed than male defectives, the higher 
proportion of psychotic males than females, and the higher percen¬ 
tages of operations among the women. The ’’mental deficiency”, ’’psy¬ 
chosis with mental deficiency”, and "psychosis” diagnostic groups 
show relative frequency of operation decreasing in that order. A 
large number of these persons were born outside of Canada, and of 
those born in Alberta a similarly large number had fathers coming

from other parts of the world. The family charts show that eaco- 
genie lines are being established in this Province and that the 
need for a eugenics program does exist. 

There are a number of factors operating in the admini¬ 
stration of the Alberta Sterilization Act which would be of value 
in any eugenics program. From the first drafting of the Act it 
has differentiated between the different types of mental aberra¬ 
tions, In so doing it has permitted modification, with the mini¬ 
mum of difficulty, of procedures according to the findings for 
the various categories. The Eugenics Board, from time to time, 
has interpreted these findings to the Legislature, and the Legis¬ 
lature in turn has acted without bias upon its recommendations, 
but before doing so, has secured competent legal advice in order 
to ensure the safe operation of the Act, 

Just as the legal administration of the Act has been 
safeguarded, so also have the personal interests of the patients 
themselves been protected. The confidential information, which 
is necessary in the study of these cases, has at all times been 
treated as such. From the first only specialized and skilled 
surgeons have been authorized to perform the directed operations, 
and these operations have been conducted only in approved hospitals. 

On the other hand this study indicates that there are 
a number of points where the present eugenics program falls short. 
The public might well have expected more to have been done in 
this field from a positive pointcf view through present educational

facilities or other agencies. This angle of the problem seems to have 
been given less and less consideration. 

Another weak point arises from the Act designating a 
specific Board whose terms of office were not defined. While the 
Board has been composed of capable and thinking men, it would seem in 
its own best interests as well as those of the public, to have member¬ 
ship terms of, say, five years, staggered so that only one member 
changed in one year. Such a system would not only retain the benefits 
normally associated with a permanent administraive body of this kind, 
-but would also allow a natural infiltration of new ideas from equally 
competent persons, and would give to more persons a first hand know¬ 
ledge of this sociological problem which confronts us today* 

Inasmuch as any studies which have been made of the 
Eugenics Board work to date have not been the result of efforts of 
persons specifically charged with this work, but rather, the result of 
the interest of individuals associated with other tranches of the Mental 
Hygiene Division, any or all of three conclusions might be suggested: 
the Eugenics Board has not been sufficiently interested to press for 
such Sfedies under its own supervision, the public has not been suf¬ 
ficiently interested to ask for the results of such studies, or the 
Eugenics Board has not been provided with adequate facilities and 
staff for the carrying out of such studies. 

In compiling the material for the family charts, it was 
found that only in a few cases was there very much information on 
record regarding the relatives of the patients examined, and that this 
information had been obtained incidentally and at intervals, a good

deal by chance. Even where the histories suggested the presence of mental 
disorders in other members of the family, no definite policy had been 
followed to investigate and report on the condition. Furthermore, the 
supervision of the patients themselves after undergoing the operation 
has been left to other members of the Mental Hygiene staff whose time is 
already well filled by their other duties. This indicates the urgent need 
of a larger staff to carry out the administrative and clerical work of the 
Eugenics Board. (As pointed out elsewhere, to the end of 1941 there was, 
in addition to the four members of the Board and the surgeons, only a 
part-time stenographer remunerated specifically for services rendered to 
the Board.) 

Apart from the humanitarian side of the picture, which in itself 
might be considered sufficient to warrant the expenditure of ample funds 
to ensure the efficient operation of this Act, a brief and purely economic 
survey is sufficient to demonstrate how penny-saving is false economy 
in this field. 

Let us suppose that by sterilizing only those mental defectives 
who have subsequently been out of institutions for some part of their 
lives, there has been prevented from being born to each just one additional 
child. Now let us suppose that each of these children would have drawn 
from public funds the equivalent of just one year ! s institutional care. 

Then we haves

Cost of one year’s institutional care (approx.).f 295 

Total savings to Province... $93810 

Average savings per year.$ 7216 


Cost of operation of Eugenics Board per year (approx).f 6075 

(The cost of one year’s institutional care is based on the figures submitted 
to the writer by the Bursar of the Provincial Training School, and the cost 
of operation of the Eugenics Board per year on the estimates submitted to the 
Provincial Treasurer for the year 1941-42.) 

On this basis alone, then, a saving is effected sufficient not only to 
meet the expenses of the Board as it functions at present but also to 
cover the basic salary of an additional social worker. 

Now let us consider this angle of the question along another 
line of reasoning. Turning to Family Chart A, it is seen that the siblings 
of 11-15 who have reached adulthood have averaged nearly three children 
each. It might reasonably be assumed, therefore, that patient 11-15 would 
have had three children too. It is also reasonable to assume that these 
two additional children of 11-15 would have required the same type of in¬ 
stitutional care as has their sister IXI-18, and that this type of care 
would be necessary for at least fifteen years of their lives. Now using 
the same amount as given above for the approximate cost of one year’s in¬ 
stitutional care, the amount saved on the above assumptions by the sterili¬ 
zation of this man is approximately $8850. In other words, the sterilization 
each year of only one case with similar potentialities would effect a. saving 
sufficient to cover the present expenses of the Eugenics Board as well as 
the salary and travelling expenses of an additional full-time social worker.

These two examples of reasoning are indicative enough of 
how great the probable savings must beI 

This study points to two others which might well be made. 

The first would endeavor to estimate the social adjustments of both 
the operative and non-operative cases since discharge from institu¬ 
tions, and to compare them with each other as well as with the ad¬ 
justments which had been made prior to presentation to the Eugenics 
Board. (The present study limits its measure of adjustment to the 
ability of the individual to remain out of institutions*) 

The second study would concern itself with the problem of 
immigration in the whole of Canada, a problem which is timely in view 
of present conditions and the extreme probability of the formation of 
new immigration policies following the war. Sufficient evidence is 
given here of the need for better methods of selecting immigrants so 
as to eliminate at least those likely to manifest mental weaknesses 
in the first generation. 

In any study such as the present one, the investigator finds 
that the original information is of necessity scattered among many 
offices. For this reason, not only have the raw data used in this 
study been filed at the Provincial Mental Hospital along with the in¬ 
termediate steps in their assimilation, but also a list of the offices 
that house the original information along with the probable sources 
of further information. This material will, therefore, be readily 
accessible for future reference.

In conclusion it might be said, firstly, that Alberta has 
a Sterilization Act, the operation of which has shown itself to be 
in the best interests of the public both from a eugenic point of view 
and from an economic point of view; secondly, that there has been a 
well chosen Board administering this Act in a scientific and intelli¬ 
gent manner; but, thirdly, that the staff entrusted solely with this 
work has not been sufficiently large to ensure the obtaining of the 
greatest possible benefit from the operation of the Act.
