INTRODUCTION 

The accuracy of spectrographic analyses is 
largely determined by the constancy of the relation 
between the relative intensities of spectrum lines 
radiated by the source and the amounts of the corre¬ 
sponding elements present in the sample. It is well 
known (3, 4, 6, 8, 13, 14) that even where the relative 
amounts of two elements in the sample remain constant, 
the intensity ratios of chosen line pairs arising from 
them may vary widely with changes in the amounts of 
other elements present. Langstroth and his co-workers 
have conducted investigations of the mechanisms op¬ 
erating in spark sources and the factors responsible 
for their variability in operation. They have shown 
the excitation to be predominantly thermal in character 

(11) and that changes in the transport phenomena accom¬ 
pany alteration of the general composition of a sample 

(12) . Experiments involving additions of various sub¬ 
stances to standard samples (14) revealed no obvious 
correlations between observed variations in intensity 
ratios and any of such factors as the excitation

potentials of the initial levelvS of the line pairs, 
the ionization potentials, atomic masses, or other 
physical properties of any of the elements involved* 
Addition to the samples of a large amount of a foreign 
substance (i.e. a buffer) does not always eliminate 
the variations, though in some instances it may min*- 
imize them (14). 

In all of these studies the measurements made 
were for light gathered from a number of complete 
sparks, and often from several regions of the source. 

It has been pointed out (9, 14) that even for a single 
spark the observed intensities are summed values for 
many oscillatory discharges. Botating-mirror photo¬ 
graphs of single sparks (12) have shown that the radi¬ 
ation conditions change progressively over the suc¬ 
cessive discharges, and that these conditions differ 
from region to region in the source* Studies of the 
patterns left by single sparks on loaded plane elec¬ 
trodes (15) showed that the separate discharges may 
encounter widely differing conditions for the release 
of material from the electrode, the variability being 





















- 3 - 

largely determined by the composition of the load# 
These studies indicate the desirability of obtaining 
information on the spectral intensities radiated from 
separate regions of single sparks during several in¬ 
tervals within their lifetimes. A technique allowing 
both time and space changes in the radiation to be 
followed for each wavelength would considerably en¬ 
large the field of available information on spark 
source mechanisms. 

This thesis is concerned with the develop¬ 
ment of a method for carrying out the studies pro¬ 
posed in the preceding paragraph and with a few pre¬ 
liminary results obtained thereby. The method in¬ 
volved the excitation of samples by a series of single 
sparks, and photography of the spectrum radiated, 
using a suitably controlled shutter of the electro- 
optical (Kerr Cell) type before the spectrograph slit. 
A sequence of exposures was taken, each identical with 
the others except that the shutter passed contrib¬ 
utions of light from only the first ”n ,f half¬ 
oscillations of each spark in the first exposure, the 
first 2n in the second exposure, and so on. The image 








- 4 - 

of the spark gap was focussed on the spectrograph slit 
so that the intensity variation along the length of a 
spectrum line had a point-to-point correspondence with 
intensity variation along the discharge axis. Spec¬ 
trograms obtained in this way yielded information on 
the time changes in intensity at any point on the dis¬ 
charge axis for all wavelengths in the sp ectrum. 
Moreover the values obtained represented the mean be¬ 
haviour for the number of sparks contributing to the 
exposure; the effects of unavoidable fluctuations in 
the source conditions were thus averaged out. 

A few experiments of a very preliminary 
nature were carried out to determine the extent to 
which new information was made available by the method. 
Additions of boric acid were made to standard samples, 
both unbuffered and buffered with potassium acetate. 

The standard sample was composed of nickel, tin, and 
magnesium chlorides. Dilute solutions of each com¬ 
position were loaded onto the plane electrode of 
copper point-plane pairs, and excited according to the 
procedure described. 









- 5 - 

The spectra obtained indicated that the in¬ 
tensities of spectrum lines change with time over the 
life of each single spark in a manner which depends 
upon the line studied and the general composition of 
the sample. The distribution of intensity along the 
discharge axis for any line also varies with time in a 
manner dependent on the sample composition. While 
portions of the data could be related in a general way 
to the mechanisms operating in the source, sufficient 
information for interpretation on this basis was not 
obtained. It is felt that the method provides a means 
for greatly extending the range of information avail¬ 
able on the behaviour of spark sources.

APPARATUS 

To make possible the photography of the 
spectra radiated from selected portions of the life¬ 
times of single sparks, it was necessary to design an 
apparatus capable of controlled, reliable, and repro¬ 
ducible operation within times of the order of the 
period of oscillation of the sparks. This time is 
commonly 10 seconds or less. The succeeding para¬ 
graphs describe the essential features of an arrange¬ 
ment satisfying these requirements. 

The Optical Shutter 

The unsuitability of mechanical shutters at 
times of the order of 10 seconds led to the adoption 
of the electro-optical or Kerr Cell shutter (1, 2, 7). 
The cell, illustrated in Plate I, had a body con¬ 
structed of Pyrex tubing, 12.5 cm. in length and 2.5 cm. 
internal diameter. The parallel-plate electrodes were 
of brass, i/n• inch in thickness, 12.0 cm. long, and 
2.0 cm. wide, with all edges smoothed and rounded. 

They were supported in position by thin brass rods

extending out of the cell through sidearms to provide 
electrical terminals. A third sidearm was provided 
for filling the cell. When the plate separation had 
been adjusted to 0.5 cm. these rods were cemented into 
the sidearms with plugs of porcelain cement. The cell 
windows were thin plates of fused quartz selected for 
freedom from strain patterns, and affixed to the ends 
of the cell with a commercial china cement (Sheffield 
China Cement)* The cements mentioned T were chosen for 
resistance to the cell liquid (chloroform), and to min¬ 
imize strain on the cell windows occasioned in setting. 
Both were unsatisfactory over long periods, tending to 
shrink and crack, occasioning leaks in the cell. 

The cell was placed between crossed polarizers 

o 

(Foucault prisms) whose optic axes were oriented at 45 
to the electric field direction between the plates; this 
arrangement constitutes the optical shutter. The closing 
action of such shutters upon removal of the field is 
extremely rapid (7). 

Neglecting absorption and reflection losses, 








the intensity I passing the shutter when intensity 1 4 
passes the first polarizer is given by 

I = I 0 sin' 2 (frbLE 2 ) 

where S e.s.u./cm. is the applied field, L cm. is the 
Effective* length of the plates, and b is the Kerr con¬ 
stant of the liquid used (10). It can be seen that 
high transmission is obtained with short cells and low 
field strengths only where a liquid of large Kerr con¬ 
stant is available. Nitrobenzene, with the largest 
known Kerr constant, is the most commonly used liquid 
in the visible wavelength region. The majority of the 
persistent lines used in analysis, however, lie in the 
region from 2,500 A to 4,000 A, where nitrobenzene is 
optically opaque (1, 10). A limited search for a cell 
liquid suitable for the present work led to the choice 
of chloroform. Graphs are presented in Figure 1 for 
the calculated transmission of chloroform shutters as 
determined by cell length and field strength. The Kerr 
constant used has been estimated at 3,000 A from data 
(18) on its variation with wavelength. It is obvious 
that high field strengths are necessary with this

liquid, a condition which greatly restricts the design 
of the shutter closing mechanism. An operating voltage 
of 18 KV. v/as chosen, giving roughly 20 % transmission 
for the cell used. 

The conductivity of the cell must be kept 
extremely small, since convection currents will destroy 
the image quality; cleanliness in the cell and purity of 
the cell liquid are therefore important (7, 17). The 
electrodes were cleaned in nitric acid, thoroughly 
washed and dried. After assembly the cell was repeat¬ 
edly filled with chloroform and allowed to stand for 
periods up to 48 hours. The chloroform used was of 
analytical grade, and was twice distilled in air, the 
middle half of the distillate being retained each time. 
The final filling was by a third distillation directly 
into the cell. The conduetivit}r of this cell was quite 
appreciable, but no obvious distortion due to convection 
was present. 

The voltage supply to the cell was from a 
resistance-capacitance filtered half-wave rectifier 
having a maximum output of 20,000 d.c. volts. A 







10 - 


glycerine resistor in series with the power supply 
allowed the cell to recharge completely within 3 to 4 
seconds after each discharge# This procedure was en¬ 
forced by the leakage, corona, and conductivity losses 
of the cell, which were sufficient to effectively close 
the shutter within six seconds after the cell had been 
charged and isolated. Some lowering of the voltage 
drop across the cell was thereb 5 ^ incurred. 

For the present work, the shutter was required 
to remain open until light from the first r, n n oscill¬ 
atory discharges of the spark had passed, then close 
within a time short with respect to the period of os- 
dilation, whichms of the order of 10 sec. In view 
of other variations to be expected in the v/ork, repro- 
ducibility to within about 2 x 10 sec. was considered 
sufficient. The operation to be performed under these 
time specifications was that of reducing the cell po¬ 
tential from 18 10/ to something less than 5 KV', at which 
potential the shutter is effectively closed (7). 

An extended search was carried out for a 
method of discharging the cell in the required manner.

Gas-filled (i.e. nitrogen, commercial neon) discharge 
tubes triggered into breakdown by high-frequency elec¬ 
trodeless discharge were shown to be suitable within a 
narrow range of pressures. The difficulties of con¬ 
structing a stable model with the gases and equipment 
available caused this method to be discarded in favor 
of the arrangement illustrated by Figure 3. 

A sphere gap (nickel-plated brass spheres of 
2 cm. diameter) connected across the charged cell was 
triggered into breakdown by a high overvoltage pulse to 
a third electrode (nickel-plated brass point). This 
arrangement is reliable and free from appreciable time 
lags where overvoltages in excess of 100% are used for 
the trigger pulse, and where all electrodes are kept 
polished (5, 16). Preliminary oscillograph tests with 
low overvoltage indicated a time lag between the applic¬ 
ation of the trigger pulse and the discharge of the cell 
averaging less than O.S x 10^ sec., never exceeding 
2 x 10 -5 " sec. A condenser (.0007^f) in parallel with 
the cell capacity and the sphere gap gave better repro¬ 
ducibility and completeness of discharge without de¬ 
tec tible alteration in the discharging time.

Time Control and Associated Circuits 

It was necessary to have the pulse which in¬ 
itiated the closing process occur at an accurately con¬ 
trolled interval after the breakdown of the light source 
: gap. To this end the circuits illustrated in Figure 4 
were employed. 

On the breakdown of the light source spark, a 
tickler coil in the vicinity of the spark circuit in¬ 
ductance supplied a pulse to trip an 884 thyratron, 
whose function was to trigger the subsequent circuits, 
then shield them from the effects of further oscill¬ 
ations in the spark circuit. The breakdown of this 
thyratron initiated the action of a "one-shot oscill¬ 
ator". The operation of this circuit involved exchange 
of conduction current between two 6AC7 pentodes when an 
input pulse was received, and subsequent re-exchange at 
a time determined by the circuit constants and C T 
only. The increase of the anode potential of the second 
pentode on the re-exchange constitutes the output pulse, 
which, after suitable amplification, triggers the sphere 
gap across the cell.

The amplification involved an 884 thyratron 
stage which provided the energy to trip a 4C35 hydrogen 
pulse thyratron operated at zero grid bias and 6,000 
volts plate potential. The energy released by the 4C35 
breakdown fed the primary of a 1 to 4 ratio pulse trans¬ 
former, whose secondary delivered a pulse in excess of 
20,000 volts peak to the trigger electrode of the sphere 
gap. To minimize other operational time lags, the grids 
of all tubes were heavily overdriven. 

Control of the time for which the shutter re¬ 
mained open consisted of selecting appropriate values of 
the time constant C T . The calibration of these values 
is described in a later section. 

The Spark Source Unit 

It was desirable that each spark contributing 
lig;ht to an exposure should take place under conditions 
identical with those for all other sparks in the series. 
At the same time, local irregularities in the electrode 
deposit should be averaged out by statistical sampling 
of the whole electrode area. For these reasons the 












14 - 


spark source unit was provided with a high series re¬ 
sistor and switch to control the passage of single 
sparks, and electrodes of the point and movable-plane 
type (13) permitted each spark to strike a fresh sur¬ 
face of the plane electrode• 

The spark circuit (Figure 2) contained an 0.4 
microfarad capacity, and an 0.35 millihenry inductance 
of negligible resistance. These values gave about 
7*5 x 10"* 5 " seconds as the estimated period of electrical 
oscillation. Oscillograph traces of the current wave 
confirmed this estimate, and indicated roughly linear 
damping, with an effective spark lifetime of about 16 
half-periods* 

The voltage was variable between zero and 
10,000 d.c. volts, supplied from an inductance-capac¬ 
itance filtered bridge rectifier of one kilowatt capacity. 

Optical System and Spectrograph 

The optical system and its relation to the cell 
discharge mechanism are shown in Plates I and II. All 
elements, including the spark stand were rigidly clamped 












15 - 


to an optical bench. The quartz-fluorite achromat L, 
(focal length 25 cm. speed f/5) sent light from the spark 
in a nearly parallel beam through the quartz Foucault 
prisms and the cell. The quartz lens L z (focal length 
15 cm., speed f/5) focussed an image of the spark gap on 
the spectrograph slit. The rotating sector was used only 
for placing intensity calibration marks on each plate. 

The spectrograph was a medium quartz instrument 
manufactured by Adam Hilger Ltd.

CALIBRATION 

In the calibration of the time-control circuit, 
a rotating mirror was placed in front of the spectro¬ 
graph, and a film holder was placed to one side to re¬ 
ceive the reflected image of the spark gap* The speed of 
the mirror was adjusted to give resolution on the film of 
the light pulses emitted at each half oscillation of the 
spark* The low intensity passed by the shutter neces¬ 
sitated use of high speed (Eastman Tri-Pan) film, and re¬ 
duction of the image magnification to about one-fifth* 
With a given adjustment of the circuit constants of the 
time-control network, thirty sparks 'were passed at ran¬ 
dom. On the average, three to four of these recorded 
themselves on the film. A series of exposures taken in 
this way enabled selection of the constants required to 
effect closing of the shutter after any desired number 
of half-periods. Plate III is a reproduction of an ex¬ 
posure obtained in this manner, showing transmission of 
light from 3, 6, and 9 half oscillations. The trace for 
the full spark is shown for comparison. 







17 - 


Several such exposures were taken for each 
setting, and in no instance was any variability de¬ 
tected in the closing of the shutter. Exposures taken 6 
with no time delay introduced except those delays in¬ 
herent in the functioning of the various circuit elements 
showed closing of the shutter prior to the passage of any 
light recordable by the film. It can thus be stated that 
the lag in the closing process is of the order of a few 
microseconds at most.

EXPERIMEMTAL 

— 

Samples Studied 

The materials for study were chosen from those 
included in the work of Langstroth and Andrychuk (14) in 
case a comparison should prove desirable with data from 
studies in which the intensities were both time- and Space- 
integrated over the whole of the spark* Table I lists the 
elements involved, their atomic masses and ionization pot¬ 
entials, the salt form in which each was originally intro¬ 
duced, the concentration of each salt in the sample sol¬ 
utions, and the mass of each salt per unit area loaded onto 
the electrodes. The last mentioned information is given on 
the assumption that the salt forms appearing on the elec¬ 
trode were those originally put into solution. This as¬ 
sumption is probably not true; the figures therefore in¬ 
dicate only relative amounts of each element present on the 
electrode. Information on the spectrum lines investigated 
is given in Table II. 

Four solutions were prepared. Two consisted of 
the standard sample with no buffer, while two were 
buffered with potassium acetate. One solution of each 
type carried boric acid as an extraneous addition.

Preparation of Electrodes 

The solutions were loaded onto plane copper 
electrodes 1.5 cm. x 1.5 cm. with an 0.10 cc pipette 
calibrated to 2 percent. The electrodes were cleaned 
by dipping briefly in concentrated nitric acid, washing 
in running water, and rinsing in distilled water. The 
electrodes were loaded while a visible film of moisture 
still covered the surface, since this gave better depos¬ 
ition than where flame- or air-dried electrodes were 
used. The tendency of the salts to form a heavy outer 
ring on evaporation gave some difficulty. Small additions 
of gelatine yielded very uniform coatings, but their high 
dielectric strength rendered them unsuitable for 
sparking. Reasonably good deposits were obtained by in¬ 
termittent evaporation under reduced pressure, the re¬ 
maining liquid being redistributed over the Y/hole elec¬ 
trode surface at each stage by gentle blowing through a 
pipette (14). 

More electrodes of each kind were prepared than 
were needed, to allow a selection for uniformity of 









20 - 


deposit. Electrodes of the same loading were found to 
exhibit differences in the color and texture of the 
layer, even where the coatings appeared to have uniform 
thickness (see Plate TV). 

Exposures 


The spark gap was set at a separation of 4 mm. 
and its image formed on the spectrograph slit at a mag¬ 
nification of one-half. An auxiliary lens formed an 
image of the electrodes on a screen behind the spark, to 
facilitate their accurate replacement after each exposura 
The spark was operated at minimum breakdown potential, as 
judged by the occurence of a detectible lag between the 
closing of the switch and the passage of the spark. 
Variability was noted in the lag for individual sparks on 
the same electrode, and in the breakdown potentials for 
electrodes of the same loading as well as for those of 
different loading. 

The procedure for a single exposure was as 
follows. An electrode was placed in position and 300 
single sparks were allowed to pass, with the shutter con¬ 
trols set to transmit light from the desired number of 







21 - 


half oscillations in each. The sparks were spaced at 
intervals of from four to five seconds to allow full re¬ 
opening of the shutter, and the plane electrode was 
moved horizontally so that each spark might strilce a 
fresh surface of the deposit. The performance of the 
shutter on each spark was established by observation of 
the discharge gap across the cell. It was found that 
this gap failed to fire occasionally unless the elec¬ 
trodes were polished after every 150 sparks. 

Sixteen such exposures were recorded on each of 
two Eastman 40 plates. The spectra radiated during the 
first three, six, and nine half-oscillations and during 
the complete spark were obtained for each of the four 
sample compositions. A slit width of 50 microns was used 
throughout. Each exposure for a given sample composition 
required a fresh plane electrode and a clean point; the 
results are therefore conditioned by the reproducibility 
of the electrode loading. 

Intensity calibration marks were placed on each 
plate with a brass arc and step-sector. The arc was 
placed on the spectrograph axis 125 cm. from the slit, 











22 


and operated at 3.8 amps, with a 2 mm. electrode sep¬ 
aration. An exposure of 3 seconds was taken with the 
sector turning at about 25 r.p.s. 

Processing: 

Each plate was developed ten minutes in fresh 
D-61A developer, rinsed one minute in water, fixed thirty 
minutes in acid-harding fixer F-5, washed one hour in 
running water and dried. The temperature of all baths, 
including the wash, was kept within half a degree of 
24° C entigrade. 

Determination of Intensity 

The intensities were determined by the stan¬ 
dard method (19) using a microphotometer constructed at 
the University of Alberta. 

As general precautions the microphotometer was 
allowed a twenty minute warm-up period, and zero and 
clear plate deflections were checked after every twelfth 
reading. The dimensions of the photometer beam in the 
plane of the plate were set to thirty-five microns width 
and 0.33 mm. length. This allowed each line to be

photometered at three places corresponding to regions of 
the gap just above the plane electrode, at the middle, 
and just below the point electrode# The photometered 
length at any place was closely one-sixth of the total 
length. Two readings were obtained for each of the three 
regions and the background of each line photometered. 

Several calibration curves were obtained for 
each plate to cover wavelength range of the lines under 
investigation, since the slopes of these curves are in 
general different for different wavelengths. It was not 
necessary to know the relative intensities of the brass 
arc lines in terms of which the intensities of the in¬ 
vestigated lines are given since only changes in inten¬ 
sity ratios were of interest in the study, and each plate 
carries a complete set of data. 

Terminology 

Interpretation of the data required consider¬ 
ation of the terms to be used in its description. Suppose 
that i A represents the instantaneous value at time t of 
the intensity radiated at wavelength a . The photo¬ 
graphic plate cannot record this value i A , but only the

total exposure in the time interval zero to t, , which 
can be represented as 

E CAj£j - ^ i A • dt, where in general i A 

o 

is a function of time. 


Comparison of exposures taken over the same time inter¬ 
val is equivalent to comparing the average intensities 
I A radiated over that interval as defined by 


E 


(x,/,) 


x, 


t, 


etc. 


The term "intensity ratio” as commonly used in spectro- 
graphic analysis refers to the quantity /I Xi as just 
given. In the present work consideration has been given 
to intensities averaged over differing periods. More¬ 
over, it has been necessary to refer to instantaneous 
as well as average values. The terms "intensity” and 
"intensity ratio" have therefore been restricted to apply 
to instantaneous values only. The quantities actually 
determined from the photographic plates are exposures in 
the sense defined above and have been referred to as such.

The terra ”exposure ratio” obviously has the significance 
1^ /I * wherever the ratio has been taken for two ex¬ 
posures of the same time duration, but not otherwise.

RESULTS 

The results are presented graphically in 
Figures 5 to 8 inclusive. Each figure gives the com¬ 
plete data pertaining to a given sample composition. 

For all points the abscissa gives the number of half¬ 
periods for which each of three hundred sparks contrib¬ 
uted light to the exposure. 

The ordinates of the graphs designated (a), (b) 
and (c) on each figure are the exposures of the invest¬ 
igated lines expressed as percentages of arbitrary values. 
These arbitrary numbers for each line were chosen to min¬ 
imize the average deviation between the results for a 
given sample composition from the two plates. This pro¬ 
cedure was permissible since only exposure changes were 
of interest. 

The ordinates of the graphs designated (d) to 
(1) inclusive in each figure are the exposure ratios of 
the line pairs, expressed as percentages of arbitrary 
values. These arbitrary numbers were chosen to minimize 
the average deviation between the results for the two 








- 27 - 


plates. This procedure was permissible since only 
changes in the ratios were of interest. It should be 
noted that the data for a given ratio remain directly 
comparable over all sample compositions; this is only 
approximately true for the line exposure data above.

DISCUSSION 

Performance of the Apparatus 

The evidence obtained in the calibration pro¬ 
cedure (page 16) establishes the ability of the method 
to control the time for which single sparks may con¬ 
tribute light to an exposure. Specifically, the 
apparatus employed was free from unreliability where 
proper precautions (page 21) were observed, and gave 
sufficient reproducibility for the study of intervals as 
short as 10*"*" seconds. In its present form, its use is 
restricted to the study of intervals which include the 
beginning of each spark. Electronic tubes are now 
available which permit the generation of square-wave 
pulses at amplitudes upwards of 12 kilovolts (20); the 
application of these tubes with a closed-to-open-to- 
closed shutter operation (1) would permit intervals to 
be selected for study from any desired portion of the 
spark lifetime. Adaptation to the study of the A.C. 
spark should offer few problems.

Interpretation of the Results - General Features 

The results presented in the graphs of the 
previous section are of a very preliminary nature, 
serving only to indicate the type of information made 
available by the method, and to suggest promising areas 
for further investigation. The chief feature of the 
data concerns the ability to compare exposures re¬ 
sulting from complete spark processes with exposures in 
which these processes are in different stages of devel¬ 
opment* Since the time rate of change of exposure is 
the average intensity radiated over the interval, the 
slopes at any time of the curves in row A of Figures 5 
to 8 inclusive should be proportional to the absolute 
intensities being radiated at that time, averaged over 
the three hundred sparks concerned. Thus observed 
changes in the exposure ratio of a line pair can be re¬ 
lated to the changes in line intensities which gave 
rise to them. A second feature is the ability to con¬ 
trast exposure distributions along the discharge axis 
at one stage of the spark with those existing at other 
stages, and to correlate these with the exposure ratios 
at various regions of the gap. 













' 





30 - 


While it is felt that these features provide 
important avenues to information on source mechanisms 
no extended analysis of the present data from this view¬ 
point has been possible. The accuracy of the data was 
not sufficiently high to allow quantitative estimates of 
relative intensity to be made from the exposure curves. 
The determinations of exposures from the two plates 
taken deviated from their mean values by roughly 10% on 
the average; thus the least change in an exposure whie h 
was considered significant was 20%. While the exposure 
ratios are subject to errors from both lines, the 
average deviation was again just less than 10%. Thus 
20% has been taken as the least significant change in an 
exposure ratio. Further limitation is placed on the 
interpretation on two accounts. One concerns contam¬ 
ination of the point electrode by material carried over 
from the plane by previous sparks in a series. The 
second arises from the observation (12) that the total 
radiation in any half-oscillation is generally greatest 
near the cathode; comparison of exposures involving odd 
and even numbers of half-oscillations may be influenced

by this effect. Both factors tend to prejudice the 
axial exposure distributions. Despite these limit¬ 
ations, the results clearly establish certain features 
of spark behaviour not previously open to investigation. 
These features are discussed in the paragraphs which 
follow. 

Discussion of the Hesults 

Marked differences were observed between the 
behaviour of individual lines over the time intervals 
studied. Moreover, changes in sample composition had 
important effects on this behaviour. For example, the 
two nickel lines in Figure 5-A developed steadily over 
the v/hole spark lifetime, indicating approximately con¬ 
stant intensities after the third half-period. The ex¬ 
posure ratio Hi 3566/M 3415 therefore showed no sig¬ 
nificant variation over the spark lifetime. In sharp 
contrast, the exposure ratios M 3415/Sn 3262 and 
M 3566/Sn 3262 showed definite increases at all regions 
of the gap at times later than the sixth half-period. 
These effects resulted from the failure of the 3h 3262 
exposure to increase after this time. The major portion 




i 










32 - 


of the tin radiation occurred, therefore, prior to the 
third half-oscillation. This and other cases to be noted 
suggest the desirability of extending the studies to 
earlier times. While it was not possible to assign this 
behaviour to the effect of any single source mechanism, 
the release of material from the electrode was most 
strongly suggested, in that tin atoms must have been 
almost absent from the discharge sifter the earliest times. 

When boric acid was added to the standard sample, 
the behaviour of the tin line was not much altered, 
although Figure 6-A indicates that the disappearance of 
the tin line occurs at progressively later times at regions 
out from the plane. The nickel lin<g, however, were rad¬ 
ically changed in behaviour, particularly in the region 
of the plane electrode. The radiation of all three lines 
in this region took place almost entirely prior to the 
sixth half-period. In consequence the ratios in Figure 5 
(d), (g) and (j) remained sensibly unchanged after this 
time. 

When the standard sample was buffered with 
potassium acetate, neither of the marked effects 







33 


described for unbuffered samples was observed. Ir¬ 
respective of whether boric acid was (Figure 8) or was 
not (Figure 7) present, all lines were sustained through 
out the spark lifetime, and none of the ratios showed 
any pronounced variation with time. This is obviously 
a desirable aspect from the standpoint of the choice of 
buffer substances. 

Evidence was obtained that conditions in the 
source may change with time in such a way as to alter 
the relationship between lines arising from the sate 
element. The spectra for the unbuffered sample (Figure 
5) showed closely parallel development of both nickel 
lines. The addition of boric acid caused the ratio 
Hi 3566/Hi 3415 to be higher near the plane than near 
the point at all times (Figure 6-A). The ratio 
Hi 3566/Sn 3262 showed little change along the axis, 
while Hi 3415/Sn 3262 increased towards the point; thus 
the excitation conditions along the gap were more favor¬ 
able to Hi 3415 near the plane than near the point, 
while Hi 3566 was sensibly constant along the axis at 
all times. The presence of the potassium acetate buffer 
largely eliminated this effect (Figure 8). 









34 - 


The exposure distribution of a line along the 
discharge axis was observed to shift with time under 
some conditions. For example, in Figure 5-A, the ex¬ 
posures of the nickel lines over the first three half¬ 
periods are highest near the plane. Over nine-half¬ 
periods the exposure distributions are uniform along the 
axis, while for the full spark the region of maximum 
exposure is near the centre of the gap. Corresponding 
shifts occur in the axial distribution of the exposure 
ratios. The presence of additions alters this behaviour. 
The buffered sample maintains the region of maximum ex¬ 
posure near the plane for all lines at all times. The 
addition of boric acid to the unbuffered sample leaves 
no clearly established trend for Hi 3566, while upward 
shifts near the point occur with increasing time for 
Ni 3415 and Sn 3262. The addition of boric acid to the 
buffered sample gave distributions initially higher near 
the point for all lines, the region of maximum exposure 
shifting towards the centre of the gap with increasing 
time. 

The general levels of intensity were greatly 
altered by the additions. The intensities of all lines 





35 


in the spectrum, relative to those observed when the 
standard sample alone was sparked, were reduced by the 
addition of boric acid, and very greatly enhanced by 
the addition of the buffer* However, the weakest spectra 
were obtained when boric acid was added to the buffered 
sample* The cause of these alterations was not under¬ 
stood* it was noted on page 20 that the average minimum 
breakdown potential for a given electrode loading de¬ 
pended upon the composition of the load. The behaviour 
described above for the tin line Sn 3262 in unbuffered 
samples, and for the nickel lines in the unbuffered 
sample containing boric acid further indicated the im¬ 
portance of the release mechanism in spark sources. 
Additional evidence is given by the appearance of the 
electrode surfaces before and after sparking. Plate IV 
is a photograph of some of the electrodes used in this 
work, chosen to illustrate variability in the character 
of the electrode deposits, and differences in the action 
of the spark on the electrode surfaces* The observable 
differences between electrodes of the same load both 
before and after sparking emphasize an important cause 
of irreproducibility in experiments of this nature*

36 - 


The more striking features concern the differences in 
sparking behaviour of different loads. For example, 
electrodes "buffered” with potassium acetate addition 
showed well defined "hot-spots" much fewer in number 
than the three hundred sparks which created them, while 
the electrodes carrying standard sample plus boric acid 
showed widely variable behaviour, the separate discharges 
within a single spark often striking to different spots 
on the electrode. These observations are notable only 
in that they call further attention to the role of the 
release mechanism in the source, and to the dependence 
of this mechanism on the character of the electrode 
surface. 


Apart from these very general statements, no 
attempt was made to interpret the data in terms of 
source mechanisms. An extended program of experiments 
of higher accuracy is prerequisite to any such attempt. 
The comparison suggested on page 18 with the work of 
Langstroth and Andrychuk (loc. sit.) yielded no very 
significant conclusions. The average values of the full 
spark exposure ratios in this study are not comparable

to exposures integrated over the whole of the spark as 
in their work. However, general agreement was obtained 
for the order of size of the indicated changes in nickel- 
tin exposure ratios due to boric acid additions.

CONCLUSIONS 

The following conclusions are presented on the 

basis of the work outlined in this report. 

1. A method has been outlined for obtaining 
photographs of spectra radiated from known inter¬ 
vals within the lifetimes of single sparks, em¬ 
ploying a shutter of the Eerr Cell type. 

2. A first model of the working arrangement 
has been described. Where proper precautions are 
observed its reliability and reproducibility have 
been shown to be adequate for the study of sparks 
of periods as short as 10~ r seconds. 

3. Intensities of spectrum lines radiated from 
any region of the source change with time over the 
life of each single spark. The manner in which 
changes occur depends upon the individual line 
studied and upon the composition of the sample 
excited. 

4. The distribution of intensity along the dis¬ 
charge axis for any line may change with time over 














■ 












. 
















39 - 


the life of each single spark. The manner in 
which charges occur depends upon the individual 
line studied and upon the composition of the 
sample excited. 

5. The intensity ratio of a line pair at any 
region of the source and its distribution along 
the discharge axis may vary over the spark life¬ 
time in a manner dependent on the general sample 
composition, whether the lines arise from the same 
or from different elements. 

6. While certain portions of the data could be 
related in a general way to such factors as release 
of material from the electrode and excitation con¬ 
ditions in the discharge, the information obtained 
was insufficient to permit any interpretation in 
terms of source mechanisms. 

7. Extended experiments of higher accuracy are 
needed before the various source mechanisms can be 
effectively studied. It is felt that refinements 
in the method described will allow such studies to 
be accomplished.
