SYNOPSIS 


The main purpose of this study was to examine the 
results obtained on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for 
Children by a group of mentally superior subjects* The 
test was administered to a number of Admonbon public 
school students who had previously obtained high scores 
on various other mental tests, and to a few of the 
brighter children attending school in the village of 
Car stairs, Alberta* Only those subjects who rated a 
WISC Pull Scale I.Q. of at least 120 were included in 
the study. 

Analyses included examination of the magnitude and 
significance of rank correlation coefficients of the 
eleven subtest scores with the Pull Scale score, and of 
the Verbal and Performance sub test scores with the Verbal 
and Performance total scores respectively. The signifi¬ 
cance of Hie differences existing among the means of the 
eleven subtest scores was computed. Attention was given 
to the means of the Verbal and Performance Intelligence 
Quotients obtained by the group, while an ancillary 
study was undertaken to determine the nature of the dis¬ 
tribution of discrepancies occurring between Verbal and 
Performance Intelligence Quotients. Haw scores obtained 
by the subjects were examined in an effort to determine 
which, if any, of the WISC subtests are of insufficient 
difficulty to measure adequately the intelligence of

superior children. 

The investigation revealed that in most cases the 
rank correlation coefficients of the subtest scores with 
the Full Scale score were quite low, often failing to be 
significantly different from zero. Correlation coeffi¬ 
cients of the Verbal subtests with total Verbal score, 
and of the Performance subtests with total Performance 
score were somewhat higher, but no coefficient approached 
the Pear son f s r values published by Wechsler for his 
standardization sample. 

There was a rather pronounced tendency for these 
superior children to obtain significantly higher weighted 
scores on the Verbal subtests than on the Performance sub- 
tests. As a result, the mean Verbal I.Q. of the group was 
found to be substantially greater than the mean Performance 
I.Q,* The ancillary study dealing with the deviations of 
Verbal from Performance Intelligence Quotients tended to 
bear out this latter finding, as the distribution of dis¬ 
crepancy scores indicated that Verbal Intelligence Quo¬ 
tients were commonly greater than Performance Intelligence 
Quotients. 

Haw scores obtained by many of the subjects point to 
the likelihood that several of the WISC subtests do not 
possess sufficiently high ceilings to measure fully the 
mental abilities of certain superior adolescents. In 
addition, it was felt that Wechsler T s procedure of limiting

' 


the magnitude of scaled scores to a maximum of twenty 
points tended to hinder accurate measurement of indivi¬ 
dual differences in cases where especially high raw 
scores were obtained. 




CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

Interest in the measurement of human characteristics 
dates back to the early years of the nineteenth century. 
Groups working in the fields of physiology, anthropology, 
and psychology gradually became more conscious of indivi¬ 
dual differences and began to search for methods that 
would enable them to measure the extent and nature of 
these differences. Darwin, Galton, Wundt, Cattail, 

Wissler, and Kraeplin were outstanding among those who 
laid the foundations of this movement, and their testing 
procedures, although often crude and inaccurate, gave 
later scientists something on which to build. 

Toward the end of the nineteenth century a French 
psychologist, Alfred Binet, began experimenting with tests 
which would measure such mental functions as memory, rea¬ 
soning, and attention. From the time of his first test 
series in 1896, he insisted that mental tests should be 
designed to measure a variety of higher processes, and 
should not emphasize sensory discrimination and reaction. 1 
His early emphasis upon tests of memory and imagery suggest 
that these mental functions were regarded as close simula- 

p 

tors of intelligence. Successively as his work progressed

2 


he devised tests of attention, adaptation, judgment, direc- 

3 

tion, auto-criticism, comprehension, and invention. In 

his tireless efforts to discover the nature of intelligence, 

Binet did not allow himself to be too greatly bound by his 

earlier theories, and he showed considerable willingness to 

cast aside any view that did not test out well* In the end, 

after trying vainly to disentangle the various intellective 

functions, he decided to test their combined functional 

capacity without any pretense of measuring the exact con- 

4 

tribution of each to the total product. 

The school officials of Paris had been watching Binet 1 s 
work with interest. In 1904 they asked him to assemble a 
battery of tests that would assist them in differentiating 
between the genuinely dull pupils and those who were capable 
of absorbing regular classroom instruction. With the assis¬ 
tance of Theodore Simon, Binet published his first scale of 
general intelligence in 1903* This battery consisted of a 
list of thirty tasks to be performed by the child, and was 
constructed with the primary object of affording a method 
by which mentally deficient students could be objectively 
and accurately selected. Further research led to the 1908 
and 1911 revisions of the original scale, in which Binet 
introduced^ and perfected the method of grouping the test 
items by age.^ 

The prestige of these intelligence scales increased

steadily as foreign psychologists came to realize their 
value. After some six years of research, Lewis Terman 
published in 1916 the Stanford Revision of the Binet Scale. 
Additional items in this revised battery supplemented 
Binet f s original tests to the extent that it was now pos¬ 
sible to measure adequately the intellectual capacities of 
normal and superior children of widely varying ages. The 
Stanford Revision had immediate popularity, and became for 
the next twenty years the yardstick by which other tests 
were judged. In 1937 Terman and Merrill introduced the 
Revised Stanford-Binet Seale, which is today the most widely 
used test of general intelligence on the market. 

Like the earlier Binet Scales, the present scale is 
strongly weighted with verbal items, and has been found to 
be discriminatory in cases where there is evidence of poor 
schooling, linguistic handicap, or reading disability.^ 
Because of these and other weaknesses discovered in the 
general design of the Revised Stanford-Binet Scale, David 
Weehsier, clinical psychologist at New York's Bellevue 
Hospital, constructed a test more appropriate to his needs. 
The Weehsier-Bellevue Scale, as it was called, provided 
some means of revealing more about the pattern of an indi¬ 
vidual's mental functioning. With verbal and performance 
abilities weighted equally, it was now possible to calcu¬ 
late a Verbal, a Performance, and a Pull Scale I.Q,. for

each subject. In 1?46, seven years after the appearance 
of the first edition, Wechsler published Form II of the 
test. This new form is essentially the same in design as 
the original, but it has different test items, and thus 
affords a reliable means of retesting the individual. 

The Adult Seales earned such favorable publicity that 
the author decided to construct a similar test for use with 
younger subjects. This new battery, the Wechsler Intelli¬ 
gence Scale for Children, is made up largely of items taken 
from Form II of the earlier scales. The main additions are 
new items at the easier end of each subtest to permit exami¬ 
nation of children as young as five years of age. Wechsler 
contrasts the Bellevue Scales and the WISC as follows: 

Sven though the materials overlap, the 1ISC 
is a distinct test from the Wechsler-Bellevue 
Seales, and is independently standardized. The 
directions for presenting and the standards for 
scoring and assignment of weights and bonuses 
are quits different. 0 

The WISC is composed of 12 subtests, of which 6 are 
classified as Verbal, and 6 as Performance. The Verbal 
Scale includes tests of Information, Comprehension, Arith¬ 
metic, Similarities, Vocabulary, and Digit Span, while the 
Performance subtests are known as Picture Completion, 

Picture Arrangement, Block Design, Object Assembly, Coding, 
and Mazes. Ordinarily only 5 Verbal and j? Performance 
tests are administered to the subject, and the intelligence 
















'

5 


quotients are calculated on this basis. Digit Span and 
Mazes are usually omitted because of their low correlations 
with the other tests of the scale. While it is permissible 
to give all tests, the total weighted scores obtained re¬ 
quire prorating before the Intelligence Quotients may be 
computed from the tables. 

According to Wechsler, general intelligence is not a 
unitary trait or ability, but is part of personality itself. 
It is something more than mental energy or the power to 
educe relations: it is the ability to utilize this mental 
energy or to exercise this power in contextual situations.^ 
He argues that tests of verbal ability, abstract reasoning 
and the like, when used alone in a general intelligence 
examination, have been found to give an incomplete picture 
of the individuals capacity for effective adjustment and 
achievement. As a consequence, he has made a deliberate 
attempt in the construction of the WISG to take into ac¬ 
count certain non-intellective factors of the personality 
such as persistence and desire to succeed. These factors, 
he contends, contribute to the total effective intelligence 
of the individual, and are objectively appraisable in the 
various performance tests. 10

CHAPTER II 


PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION 


There is abundant evidence to indicate that psychologi¬ 
cal and educational authorities are neglecting the child 
with superior intelligence. The amount of research conduc¬ 
ted with normal and subnormal children has far outweighed 
the studies directed toward the understanding of the gifted. 

The American Association for Gifted Children 
is conducting a wide range of activities designed 
to meet some of the outstanding needs of this 
group. Among the most urgent needs are: a more 
widespread understanding of the nature of gifted 
children and youth, more efficient teachers, im¬ 
proved working relationships between parents and 
teachers, more varied and more stimulating curri¬ 
cula in our school system, and more research on 
the gifted. 11 

A glance at indices of newspapers, periodicals, and 
even professional journals reveals the fact that references 
to the gifted child are very few. 

A graduate student at Northwestern University re¬ 
cently consulted the Educational Index to discover the 
number of articles on gifted children listed for the 
years 1929-48. She found that the peak of interest in 
gifted children as reflected in the number of articles 
published was during the years 1959-42. Interest 
lagged throughout the period of World War II and a 
rather consistent average was reached in the years 
directly following. 12 

The space allotted to the gifted in educational and 
psychological publications offers another indication of the 
small amount of attention that has been given to this group.

For example, in the volume on Special Education, "The 
Handicapped and the Gifted", more than 515 pages were de¬ 
voted to the handicapped, while only 15 pages were given 

13 

over to the gifted pupils* ' 

In the provision of special classes for abnormal 
groups, the trend is again very much in the same direction* 

Compared with the number of classes organ¬ 
ized for the subnormal child, special class work 
for the superior is woefully lacking. Healihy 
reported only 2,842 children attending special 
classes for the superior in 1958, as contrasted 
to about 126,000 subnormals for whom special edu¬ 
cational provisions had been made.3-4 

The table of statistics for 1947-48 furnished 
by the United States Office of Education ... shows 
that fewer than 21,000 gifted children are enrolled 
in special classes in the elementary and the secon¬ 
dary schools. 3-^ 

The history of intelligence testing reflects once 
again the apparent tendency to overlook the superior indivi¬ 
dual, and to concentrate chiefly on the abilities of the 
normal and subnormal groups. 

Binet held that the most important application 
of the tests of intelligence was to persons of in¬ 
ferior intelligence. He did not recognize explicitly 
the great value of testing for superior intelligence 
and for outlining for super-normal children an educa¬ 
tion according to their abilities ...3-6 

For leehsler, as for Binet, the principal 
interest was in studying the average and below- 
average groups; no particular effort was made to 
measure precisely the higher levels of adult men¬ 
tal ability. 3-7

Scale is that It Is not sufficiently difficult for measure- 
ment of superior subjects. ° Has this weakness been reme¬ 
died in the newer children’s scale by the addition of items 
of appropriate complexity at the upper end of each test? 

The instructor of mathematics may be inclined at first 
glance to doubt whether the Arithmetic subtest is composed 
of problems that will tax the mental agility of more capa¬ 
ble adolescents. A number of the writer’s professional 
colleagues felt, upon examining the WISC for the first time, 
that the most difficult items on the Similarities, Compre¬ 
hension, and Picture Completion subtests were not of a 
quality that would challenge the intelligence of certain 
exceptional children of their acquaintance. 

It was disclosed about eighteen months ago that a num¬ 
ber of superior children tested at the University of Alber¬ 
ta’s Psychological Clinic had obtained noticeably deviant 
scaled scores on the various WISC subtests. One testee, 
for example, had secured the maximum scaled score of 20 
points on the Similarities subtest but had fallen to 8 on 
Coding, while another had scored 1? on Comprehension and 
only 10 on the Block Design and Coding subtests. Were 
widely varying scores such as these to be regarded as the 
normal achievement of mentally alert children? The more 
recent psychological journals were consulted at that time 
to determine what findings had been made regarding this

phenomenon* The search revealed that while a number of 
studies of normal and feeble-minded groups involving the 
V/echsler-Bellevue scales and the WISC had been undertaken, 
none was on record that was primarily concerned with the 
attainments of superior subjects on these scales* This 
disclosure aroused sufficient interest and curiosity to 
warrant a fuller inquiry into the matter* 

The present investigation was undertaken, therefore, 
in an effort to assemble information concerning the 
achievements of mentally superior children on the WISC, 
and to compare the results with those obtained by Wechsler 
from his standardization sample* It was conducted with 
the desire to fill a gap in the body of research findings 
on the new scale, and perhaps make some contribution to 
the understanding and interpretation of the W3BC at the 
upper levels of intelligence.

CHAPTER III 


RELATED STUDIES 

The dearth of published articles dealing with the 
achievements of superior children on the WISC is not sur¬ 
prising when one realizes that this test has been on the 
market for a comparatively short period of time. Again, 
as mentioned in a previous chapter, there is evidence to 
indicate that the feeble-minded child has been subject to 
closer scrutiny than has the gifted child. This situation 
is due perhaps to the assumption on the part of educators 
and test administrators that the individual who possesses 
superior intelligence requires less assistance and atten¬ 
tion than the mentally inferior person. It is felt by the 
writer that the combination of these two factors explains 
in part the relative paucity of published findings related 
to this investigation. 

I. RELEVANT CONCLUSIONS DRAM BY WECHSLER 

Upon analyzing the test profiles obtained in the 
Wechsler-Bellevue standardization study, leehsler was able 
to diraw a number of conclusions regarding the achievement 
of deviant groups. He found, for instance, that subjects 
with superior intelligence generally did better on the

11 


verbal subtests, while mentally inferior individuals 
tended to obtain their highest scores on the performance 
section of the examination. In addition, he confirmed the 
findings of previous studies which indicated that Jewish 
children did better on verbal tests, and Italian children 
on performance tests. 1 ^ 

II, INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS OP SUPERIOR SUBJECTS 
IN THE WISC STANDARDIZATION SAMPLE 

The superiority of Verbal I.Q. to Performance I*Q. 
among gifted subjects was substantiated in the process of 
standardizing the WISC, Of the 2200 cases included in the 
sample, 2*1?> were found to possess a Verbal I,Q. of 130 
points or more, whereas the corresponding percentage on 
the Performance Scale was only 1*1%* The number of chil¬ 
dren who tested over 120 I.Q, on the three scales is indi¬ 
cated in Table I* 

It may be noted that the Verbal Seale cumulative fre¬ 
quencies exceed those of the Performance Scale at all of 
the seven levels of superiority listed in Table I* One 
would gather from this that Verbal Intelligence Quotients 
tend to be greater in magnitude than Performance Intelli¬ 
gence Quotients among superior children. This tendency 
appears to be especially marked where the Intelligence 
Quotients exceed 130.

III. DISCREPANCY SCORES OF SUBJECTS CONSTITUTING 
THE WISC STANDARDIZATION SAMPLE 


Seashore has carried out considerable research on the 

WISC f s standardization sample, and recently analyzed the 

size and direction of discrepancies between the Verbal and 

Performance Intelligence Quotients of the 2200 subjects 
21 

tested* He defined the term discrepancy score* as the 
numerical difference between a child*s two Intelligence 
Quotients, with Performance I*Q. always being subtracted 
from Verbal I*Q* Both positive and negative discrepancy 
scores are thus obtainable* Seashore found that the means 
of the discrepancy scores at each age level from 5 - 15 
years were all essentially zero, with the standard devia- 













15 


tions of all distributions being about 12 or 13 I.Q. units. 
This indicated that approximately one-third of the discre¬ 
pancies between Verbal and Performance Intelligence Quo¬ 
tients were greater than 12 - 15 points of I.Q., while in 
about two-thirds of the cases the differences ranged from 
zero to 12 - 13 points. Some of the 2200 discrepancy 
scores were quite large, ranging to extreme values of ap¬ 
proximately -35 and +35* 

There appeared to be a slight tendency for urban 
children to have positive discrepancy scores, and for 
rural subjects to possess relatively higher Performance 
Intelligence Quotients than Verbal Intelligence Quotients. 
It was further found that children with professional and 
semi-professional backgrounds tended to form the most 
verbal-minded group, although once again the trend was 
not too marked. The 35 subjects in the sample’s subnormal 
group obtained a mean discrepancy score of -2. This devi¬ 
ation from zero, however, was not considered to be great 
enough to be of clinical importance. No reference was 
made to the nature of the discrepancies between Verbal and 
Performance Intelligence Quotients among the highly intel¬ 
ligent children in the sample. 

IV. DISCREPANCY SCORES OF YOUNGER SUBJECTS IN THE 
WECHSLER- BELLEVUE STANDARDI2*ATI ON SAMPLE 


Wechsler was well aware that fairly large discrepancies

existed between the Verbal and Performance Intelligence 
Quotients of the subjects composing the Wechsler-Bellevue 
standardization sample. The observed differences for the 
.520 subjects in the 10 - 16 age group were analyzed frcan 
the standpoint of absolute magnitude and the median dis¬ 
crepancy score regardless of sign was found to be 9.1 
22 

points of I.Q. Forty-one subjects in this group possessed 

Full Scale Intelligence Quotients which exceeded 120. The 

median absolute difference between these 41 pairs of Verbal 

and Performance Intelligence Quotients was found to be 14.9 
23 

points of I.Q. Table II indicates the percent of cases 
in which Verbal and Performance Intelligence Quotients either 
outweighed each other or were identical in magnitude.

quencies is due to the fact that the I.Q. categories 80 - 
90 and 111 - 119 are not included in the table. 

An inspection of the percentage frequencies within 
the three I.Q,. categories in Table II would lead one to 
conclude that the proportion of positive Bellevue discre¬ 
pancy scores varies directly as the Full Scale I.Q. level 
of a homogeneous group of subjects. 

V. STUDIES INVOLVING THE WISG AND 
MENTALLY DEFICIENT CHILDREN 

A correlational analysis of the scores of 70 subnormal 
subjects on the Revised Stanford-Binet Scale and the WISG 
was reported by Stacey and Levin.The children were divi¬ 
ded into two groups, one composed of 44 morons and the other 
of 26 borderline cases. In the moron group a coefficient of 
.21 was found when Verbal subtest totals were correlated 
with Performance totals, while the corresponding coefficient 
for the borderline group was -.$1. 

In Taylor f s study of 74 feeble-minded children conduc¬ 
ted at the same time as the present investigation, the 
following coefficients of rank correlation were obtained: °

The correlational results obtained in these two in¬ 
vestigations of feeble-minded subjects have been included 
in the present list of related studies merely to suggest 
that there may be a lesser degree of correlation between 
the various combinations of WISC scores in intellectually 
homogeneous groups than Weehsler has indicated for his 
standardisation sample. 









CHAPTER IV 


POPULAR CLASSIFICATIONS OF SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE 

Those persons and groups who have taken upon themselves 
the task of constructing intelligence scales have commonly 
agreed that the concept of intelligence levels has proven 
very convenient in the classification of mental ability. 
Unfortunately, however, little harmony has existed either 
in nomenclature or definition of the various levels of in¬ 
telligence. 

Of current test-makers, none is more aware of these 
inconsistencies than Wechsler, who disapproves of the arbi¬ 
trary bases on which Terman, Kuhlmann, and others have 
classified their Intelligence Quotients.He questions 
the wide acceptance of the Terman classificatory scheme, 
not only for ratings obtained on the Stanford-Binet, but 
for Intelligence Quotients derived from any number of other 
tests. Furthermore, he condemns as unsound the practice of 
reporting equivalent Binet I.Q. ratings for nearly every 
intelligence scale currently in use, as this procedure en¬ 
tails the blind assumption that these tests are measuring 
the same factor or factors as the Binet. 

Wechsler wished to construct a classificatory scheme 
in which the definition of intelligence levels was in terms 




18 


of statistical frequencies. Realizing the popularity of 
ferman f s system, he attempted to retain as much of it as 
possible while at the same time introducing the statistical 
quantity f Probable Error* into the determination of class 
limits. 2 ^ He argued that an average person was generally 
considered to be one who fell within the middle 30 percent 
of the group, a range which was defined on the normal curve 
baseline by the interval -1 P.E. to *1 P.E. Concluding that 
an I.Q. of 90 was interpreted in the case of most intelli¬ 
gence scales as the lowest limit of average or normal in- 
telligenee, he equated the P.E. value of -1 with 90." This 
meant that if the mean intelligence quotient were set at the 
traditionally accepted value of 100, a distance of 1 P.E. on 
the normal curve baseline would then correspond to 10 points 
of I«Q. 

As a means of ascertaining the validity of the proposed 
scheme, Wechsler set the lower limit of borderline deficiency 
at -3 P.E., a point which corresponded to the value adopted 
by Terman, viz. 70 I.Q,. A mental defective would then be a 
person falling at a distance greater than 3 P.E. *s from the 
mean. An ordinate erected at -3 P.E. was found to cut off 
the lower 2.2% of the area under a normal curve, indicating 
that this percentage of a normal population would be classi¬ 
fied as mentally deficient under the proposed scheme. With

1? 


the knowledge that various estimates of the probable inci¬ 
dence of mental deficiency in America gave a mean figure 
approximating 3°/® of the total population, Wechsler was ap¬ 
parently satisfied that this classificatory procedure was 
reasonably valid.21 As a result, WISC I.Q. tables have 
been constructed in such a manner as to provide, for a 
large randomly-selected group, a normal distribution of 
quotients having a mean of 100 and a standard deviation 
of 1.5, which is to say a P.E. of 10. 

Wechsler 1 s recently revised classification of intel¬ 
ligence is presented in Table III. For the purpose of 
comparison, Terman's classification is shown in Table IV.

(.Taken from Terman.^) 


Consideration of Tables III and IV indicates that 
Terman and Wechsler have agreed quite closely in their 
classifications of intelligence at the subnormal and 
normal levels. A marked difference is apparent, however, 
in the two methods of classifying the mentally superior. 
At least one writer has drawn attention to certain pos¬ 
sible misunderstandings that may arise from these dissi¬ 
milar classifications of above average intelligence.^ 

Recent studies have indicated that there is probably 
even greater discrepancy at the upper levels than Tables 
III and IV would suggest. The results obtained in one 
investigation disclosed that the mean score of subjects 
who rated more than 130 I.Q,. on the Revised Stanford- 
Binet was nearly 20 points in excess of that obtained by 
the same group on the WISC Full Scale .^ j n a somewhat 
similar study, a trio of investigators constructed a table 
























- 

■ 

- 








. 














. 

. 
















21 


of equivalent Stanford-Binet and WISC Intelligence Quo¬ 
tients. This table indicates that WISC Full Scale Intel¬ 
ligence Quotients of 120 and 130 are respectively equiva¬ 
lent to Revised Stanford-Binet Intelligence Quotients of 
128 and 140.? 8 

Whatever the true discrepancies may be between the 
I.Q. scores on the two scales at the upper levels of in¬ 
telligence, there is apparently a very good chance that 
a Bright Normal child of WISC I.Q. 113 may obtain a gra¬ 
ding of Very Superior when tested and classified on the 
Revised Stanford-Binet Seale. The only conclusion to be 
drawn is that these classifieatory schemes differ markedly 
at the higher levels of intelligence.

CHAPTER V 


RESEARCH PROCEDURES 

I. THE SELECTION OF SUBJECTS 

Since the purpose of this investigation was to 
examine the nature of the results obtained on the YfISC by 
a group of mentally superior children, the decision was 
made to abide by Wechsler’s classificatory scheme, and to 
accept 120 I.ft* on the Full Scale as the lower limit of 
the superior group. The upper limit was left undefined 
inasmuch as both superior and very superior children were 
under consideration. Since the 103 . C is an individual test 
of intelligence that requires approximately eighty minutes 
for proper administration and scoring, it was deemed neces¬ 
sary at the outset to adopt some method of screening those 
subjects who were not likely to obtain quotients of suffi¬ 
cient magnitude to be of use in the investigation. 

Two group intelligence tests, namely the Detroit Be¬ 
ginning First-Grade and the Laycock Mental Ability scales, 
are administered annually to pupils entering grades I and 
V respectively in the Edmonton Public School system. The 
writer had access to a number of these scores, and found 
them of considerable value in eliminating children who 
possessed less than superior intelligence. Upon careful 















i 

■ 


t 
















examination of these group scores and after conferring with 
many of the room teachers involved, it was decided to test 
only those students who had obtained I.Q. ratings of at 
least 12j? on either or both of these scales* In a few out¬ 
side cases, however, the WISC was administered where it was 
felt that the Detroit or Laycock score had underestimated 
the true mental ability of the child. The screening meas¬ 
ures proved quite successful on the whole, with only 9 of 
66 testees failing to obtain the minimum standard of 120 
I.Q. on the Full Scale. 

It was felt that this method of elimination had the 
effect of somewhat diminishing the randomness of the sample 
chosen, since many subjects who might have scored just over 
120 I.Q. were not included in the survey. However, the only 
means of securing a truly random sample would have necessi¬ 
tated testing a very large number of children and then dis¬ 
carding all cases that fell below 120 I.Q. This procedure 
was not attempted because of the exhorbitant consumption of 
time entailed. 

II. DISTRIBUTION OF INTELLIGENCE 
QUOTIENTS IN THE SAMPLE

scores are grouped in intervals of 5 I.Q. points and com¬ 
pared in Table V with the corresponding frequencies rea¬ 
lized in the present study* 

Percentage frequencies were calculated for the two 
distributions of superior I.Q. scores, and these are 
compared in Table VI with expected values derived from a 
table of P.E. 

III. COMPUTING THE THEORETICAL DISTRIBUTION 
OF SUPERIOR INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS 

As mentioned in a previous chapter, in the construc¬ 
tion of his classificatory scheme, Wechsler made the 
assumption that intelligence was a trait normally distri¬ 
buted about the traditionally accepted mean of 100 I.Q. 

He then chose to equate 10 points of I.Q. to a distance of 
1 P.E. along the baseline of a normal probability curve. 
Persons of average intelligence were considered to be those 
whose Intelligence Quotients fell within the middle 50% of 
a distribution of scores obtained from a large, randomly 
selected sample of subjects, a range defined on the normal 
curve baseline by the distance -1 P.E. to *1 P.E. Succes¬ 
sive points were then laid off on the baseline in units of 
P.E., following which a categorical title was assigned to 
each of these intervening distances.

indicated diagrammatically in Figure 1. 

From a table of P.E., it may be seen that 8.877. of 
cases in a normal distribution lie above *2 P.E., while 
4.28> fall within the distance +2 P.E. to 4-2.5 P.E. 40 
Accordingly, 428/887 or 48.57* of the cases lying above 
+2 P.E. are located within the range +2 P.E. to *2.5 P.E. 
Translated into Wechsler’s classificatory scheme of intel¬ 
ligence, this suggests that 48.51* of a large, randomly 
selected group of Superior and Very Superior subjects should 
fall within the interval 120-124.? I.ft., while 51.77* of 
these subjects should attain Intelligence Quotients of 125 
or more. By means of similar arguments it may be shown 
that 27.57* of all Superior and Very Superior children should 
score between 125 and 12?.? I.Q. on the WISG Full Seale, 

14.0> should obtain from 150 to 154.? I.Q., 6.57* from 155 

to 15?.? I.Q., 2.6^ from 140 to 144.? I.Q., 0.?> from 145 

to 14?.? I.Q., Q.5> from 150 to 154.? I.Q., and ©.!> from 

15.5 I.Q. up. These are the percentage frequencies that 
appear in the 'Based on P.E. Values' column of Table VI. 

IV. CRITICISM OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF INTELLIGENCE 
QUOTIENTS IN THE CURRENT SAMPLE 

An examination of the percentage frequencies appearing 
in the three columns of Table VI will bring to light certain 
flaws in the distributions of Intelligence Quotients in both 





t 






« 












, 












28 


Wechsler’s and the current samples. The standardization 
sample had apparently too few cases at the 150-154 I.Q,* 
level, and too many within the 120-124 I.Q. interval. The 
current sample on the other hand is substantially too large 
at the 125-12^ I.Q,. level, while a considerable deficiency 
is evident in the number of cases within the interval 120- 
124 I.Q.

VI. CALCULATION OF MEAN SCORES AND 
STANDARD DEVIATIONS 

Means of subtest, total Verbal, total Performance, and 
Full Scale weighted scores, and of Verbal, Performance, and 
Full Scale Intelligence Quotients were determined by applica¬ 
tion of the formula 41 

M = A.M. + (^Tp , / ) 1 

In all cases N was 57, with the exception of the Digit Span 
subtest, in which instance N was 52. This subtest was ad¬ 
ministered in addition to the 10 regular subtests to 52 of 
the 57 subjects merely for the purpose of obtaining inform a-

tion regarding its adequacy at the upper levels of intel¬ 
ligence, Digit Span weighted scores played no part in the 
determination of either the Verbal or the Pull Scale Intel¬ 
ligence Quotients. 

Standard deviations of the various distributions of 
subtest weighted scores and of Intelligence Quotients were 
computed by the so-called short method. This involved the 
grouping of scores into frequency distributions, the calcu¬ 
lation of deviations from assumed means, and the application 

ao 

of formula 



VII. CALCULATION OP THE COEFFICIENTS OF G0HBEL4TI0N 

According to Wechsler, only 8.9% of a large, randomly 
selected population may be expected to possess Superior or 


Very Superior intelligence. 4 ^ With over 91% of cases ex¬ 


cluded at the outset of this investigation, the assumption 
could not be made that this sample represented a normally 
distributed parent population. This realization rendered 
inappropriate the use of the product-moment method of cor¬ 
relating subtest scores with Verbal, Performance, and Full 
Scale scores. The Spearman and the Kendall methods of 
rank correlation were considered, inasmuch as neither 
stipulated the assumption of normality in the parent popu-

lation. Kendall’s method appeared to cover the treatment 
of tied ranks more fully than Spearman’s, especially from 
the standpoint of testing the significance of coefficients* 
As a consequence, the Kendall method of rank correlation 
was applied throughout. 

VIII* KENDALL’S METHOD OF HANK CORRELATION 

When a number of individuals are arranged in order 
according to some quality which they all possess to a 
varying degree, they are said to be ranked* The arrange¬ 
ment as a whole is called a ranking in which each member 
has a rank. 44 

Of value in this investigation was the fact that 
Kendall has considered rank correlations in their own 
right, irrespective of the nature of the parent popula¬ 
tion. 4 ^ His coefficient of rank correlation is denoted 
by the Greek letter 't to distinguish it from Spearman’s 
p, which is derived by an altogether different method, 
and from Pearson’s product-moment coefficient f r f . Kendall 
has organized the mathematical procedures underlying the 
determination of ’tau’ in such a manner that the coeffi¬ 
cient increases in magnitude from -1 to *1 as agreement be¬ 
tween the ranks increases. Following convention, the mag¬ 
nitude of tau is -1 when the two quantities being considered

22 

are in perfect disagreement, and +1 where perfect agree¬ 
ment exists between the two rankings. For intermediate 

degrees of correspondence, tau l s magnitude falls between 

46 

these limiting values. 

Kendall's rank correlation coefficient is defined 
by 

tau a " Jn(n-l) 

where S is a score whose magnitude is determined by the 
amount of agreement between 2 rankings of n numbers. Where 
tied ranks exist, an alternative form of the coefficient is 
given by 4 ^ 

__ S 

tau b = yi n U-l) - ■£ yin(n-l) - U 

in which ease T is the correction for ties in one ranking, 
and U for ties in the other. 

Since numerous tied ranks existed in all subtest and 
total scores obtained in this investigation, tau^ was deter¬ 
mined in each of the 23 instances where the rank correlation 
coefficient was desired. For the convenience of the reader, 
a sample calculation of tau^ is included in Appendix C. 

IX. CALCULATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TAU'S 

Kendall has determined tests of significance of the two 
coefficients tau a and tau b , or rather of the values of S from 
which tau a and tau^ are derived.

A test of tau is equivalent to a test of 
the corresponding value of S, one being a multiple 
of the other, and we shall find it arithmetically 
more convenient to deal with S. 4 / 

With ties involved in neither ranking, he has defined the 

2 50 

variance of S (i.e. ) by 

Var S * 1/18 n(n-l)(2n+5) 

where n is the number of ranked scores. If there are ties 
of extent t in one ranking and u in the other, then the 
variance of the distribution obtained by correlating one 
ranking with all n possible arrangements of the other is 
given by^ 1 

Var S = l/l8[n(n-l)(2n+5) - £ t t(t-l)(2t*5) 

- £ u u(u-1)(2u-5)] + 

[£ u u(u-l)(u-2)J + i^n-i)[2 t t(t-l)][ £ u u(u-l)J 

(f Q is found by taking the square root of the calculated 
Var S. The probability that a given multiple of will be 
attained or exceeded is then read from a table prepared by 
Kendall for the purpose.^ 2 

Calculation of the significance of one of the tau T s 
obtained in this study has been carried out in Appendix G.

X. ELIMINATION OF THE SPURIOUS ELEMENT PRESENT 
IN PART-WHOLE CORRELATION 

Spurious correlation arises when a total score is 

correlated with a subscore which is a part of the total 

score* When calculating the correlation coefficients of 

WISC subscores with Verbal, Performance, and Full Scale 

scores, Wechsler eliminated spurious results by employing 

33 

McNemar’s corrective formula. This formula, however, was 

not deemed applicable in the present survey, since tau T s 

- 54 

were being considered rather than r’s. An alternate pro¬ 
cedure for eliminating spuriousness was adopted by correla¬ 
ting each subtest weighted score with the total weighted 
score minus the subtest involved* Thus Verbal and Perfor¬ 
mance subtests were correlated with the total of the four 
other Verbal and Performance subtests respectively, while 
all subtests were correlated with the total of the nine 
other subtests* Digit Span scores, not being integral 
parts of total Verbal nor Full Scale scores, were correla¬ 
ted directly with the totals of the five Verbal and of the 
ten regular subtest scores, with no correction being re¬ 
quired for spuriousness* 

This method of eliminating spuriousness, incidentally, 
was the one employed by Wechsler in the calculation of cor¬ 
relations for the Bellevue Seales. It is probable that McNemar 
had not yet developed his corrective formula at the time*

XI. RELATIONSHIPS EXISTING AMONG KENDALL f S, SPEARMAN f S, 
AND PEARSON 1 S COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 


Since all correlation coefficients in this study have 
of necessity been computed by Kendall f s method of rank cor¬ 
relation, a problem arises as to the comparison of the tau 
values with the r f s commonly obtained in psychological in¬ 
vestigations of this type. It may be stated at the outset 
that a correlation coefficient, whether it be r, tau, or 
rho, is merely a measure of the correspondence between two 
quantities, and as such, is affected by sampling fluctu¬ 
ation. The value of each coefficient is -1 where the two 
quantities are in perfect disagreement, and 4-1 in cases 
where there is perfect agreement. For intermediate degrees 
of correspondence, the three coefficients lie between these 
limiting values. A number of studies have been conducted 
in an effort to determine the relationship that might exist 
between any two of the coefficients. 

Pearson has shown that if the universe is normal, the 
grade correlation p and the ordinary correlation r are 

^ 5 A 

related by the equation^ 


= 2 sin 


m 


Since ranks and grades are connected by a simple relation, 
it follows that the correlation between ranks is the same 
as the correlation between grades. Yule and Kendall state,

% 


however, that since ranking often involves ties, and is in 
practice applied to ccmparatively small samples from uni¬ 
verses of doubtful normality, the use of the above formula 

57 

should be made with the utmost reserve* 1 They advise, 

furthermore, that it would probably be better to avoid the 

formula altogether, and to rely on the rank correlation 
58 

coefficient. 

For the purpose of measuring correlation between ranks, 

59 

tau appears to compare favorably with rho. Different as 
they might seem to be from consideration of their methods 
of calculation, they are frequently found in practice to 
give numerical values which are remarkably close, even for 
low values of n.^° By an empirical argument, Kendall and 
associates showed it to be likely that the product-moment 
correlation nr between tau and rho is 

2(n+l) 

\ ? = V 2n(2n +• J) 
for all values of the sample size n.^ 

To the knowledge of the writer, no procedure has as 
yet been developed whereby a tau calculated for a sample 
from a non-normal parent population may be translated di¬ 
rectly into an r which assumes sampling from a normal or 
near-normal universe# There is reason to believe, however, 
that the degree of correspondence between r f s and tau’s of 
from near-zero to medium magnitude is rather high.

XII. COMPARISON OP THE MAGNITUDES OP 
TWO COEFFICIENTS COMPUTED 
BY DIFFERENT METHODS 


37 


The view is expressed in some mathematical circles 
that investigators have often employed the product-moment 
method of correlation in instances where the requirements 
for normality in the universe were not assured. It is 
likely that while research workers are generally aware of 
the availability of correlation methods other than Pearson's, 
some may consciously shun the application of rank correla¬ 
tion procedures in favor of the more widely accepted product- 
moment approach, regardless of the stipulation involving 
normality. 

Whatever the actual situation may be, the writer could 
locate no related studies presenting correlational findings 
in terms of tau or rho. It was felt that at least one 
product-moment correlation should be computed in the present 
study merely to provide a basis for comparison with the cor¬ 
responding tau value obtained. Total Verbal vs. total Per¬ 
formance scores had produced a tau of only -0.15, not sig¬ 
nificant at the *10 level of confidence* Pearson's method 
was applied on the identical data, resulting in a product- 
moment coefficient of -0*16. Once again the coefficient 
was not significantly different from zero. This finding 
tended to add weight to the previously adopted conclusion 



. - .

. , „ .. . .. . 1 i: -•>. . ; . v.:

that no correlation existed between total Verbal and total 
Performance scores for the current sample of superior sub¬ 
jects. 

The computation of the product-moment coefficient is 
shown in Appendix C. 

XLII. TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MEAN DIFFERENCES 

The 13 distributions of subtest, total Verbal, and 
total Performance scores could not justifiably be regarded 
as normal in the parent populations, nor could it be assumed 
that these distributions possessed a common variance. Con¬ 
sequently, a problem arose as to the choice of the most 
appropriate procedure to be adopted in testing the signifi¬ 
cance of the differences between various pairs of sample 
means. 

The mean scores being compared were not independent 
or uneorrelated, inasmuch as they were obtained from a 

G 2 

single group of subjects rather than from different groups. 
Furthermore, none of Garrett f s formulas for computing the 
standard error of the difference between correlated means 
applied in a situation where functionally equivalent tests 
rather than a single test were administered to the same 
group.^5 

The procedure of comparison in pairs advanced by 
GAr 

Brookes and Dick was recommended by members of the De-

partment of Mathematics, University of Alberta, as an ap¬ 
propriate test of the significance of mean differences 
established in the present study. This test involved 
pairing scores obtained by the 57 subjects on any two sub¬ 
tests, finding the difference between each pair of scores, 
and computing the deviations of the 57 individual differ¬ 
ences from the corresponding mean difference. The stan¬ 
dard errors of the mean differences and subsequently the 
critical ratios of these differences to their standard 
errors were then calculated. 

The Brookes and Biek formula employed in the compu¬ 
tation of the various critical ratios or t’s is stated 
as follows 


t = 


M. d=Il 2 

V n(n-l) 


where d is the observed difference between two means, 


Z(d-d) 2 

and / —the standard error of d.

sion and Vocabulary mean scores is determined in Table

tables were constructed to render a mean I.Q,. of 100 and a 
standard deviation of 15 at each age level.^ Thus for any 
randomly selected group the mean discrepancy between Verbal 
and Performance Intelligence Quotients should be near zero. 
Upon analysis of Wechsler's standardization sample, Seashore 
found that at all age levels (V - P) discrepancy scores ap¬ 
peared to be normally distributed about means that approxi¬ 
mated zero.^ 

The discrepancy scores of the 57 superior children 
tested in the present study were calculated, grouped in 
intervals of 9, and compared with those obtained by Seashore 
from the standardization sample, and by Taylor from a sample 
of 74 mentally deficient children. In order to simplify the 
comparison of these three distributions of discrepancy 
scores, a percentage frequency polygon was constructed for 
each distribution. These frequency polygons erected on a 
single set of axes constitute Pigure 5, which may be found 
in Chapter VIII.

CHAPTER VI 


RANK CORRELATION DATA 

I. INTRODUCTION 

In determining the correlation of the twelve WISC 
subtests with the Verbal Score, Performance Score, and 
Pull Scale Score, Wechsler employed the produet-mement 
method of correlation, and corrected his obtained r's 
for spuri ousness by applying the formula recommended by 
McNemar,^ In the present study, however, the non¬ 
normal nature of the parent population rendered invalid 
the application not only of product-moment correlation, 
but of MeNemar f s corrective formula as well. In coping 
with these difficulties, two alternate procedures were 
undertaken, Pirst, correlation of subtest scores with 
Verbal, Performance, and Pull Scale scores was accom¬ 
plished by the employment of Kendall 1 s method of rank 
correlation. In the second place, the computation of 
spuriously high tan f s was prevented by correlating each 
subtest weighted score with the total score minus the 
subtest involved, rather them with the unaltered total 
score. 

Each of the 51 superior subjects under consideration 
in this investigation was administered the ten regular 




42 


WISG subtests* As a result, the following 1 5 scaled or 
weighted scores were determined for each subject: (a) 5 
Verbal subtest scores; (b) 5 Performance subtest scores; 

(c) a total Verbal score; (d) a total Performance score; 

(e) a Pull Scale score. Total Verbal, total Performance, 
and Full Scale scores were then converted into Verbal, 
Performance, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotients 
respectively by reference to Table XI in the WISC manual. 
For the reader’s information, the 13 weighted scores and 
the 3 Intelligence Quotients obtained for each of the 57 
subjects are presented in Tables XXVI and XXVII, Appendix 
A. 

The first step in the calculation of the rank corre¬ 
lation coefficients was the determination of the ranks of 
the 57 scaled scores for each of the 10 subtests. The 
method of ranking adopted was that of assigning to the 
highest of the 57 scores the rank of one, and to the 
lowest, the rank of 57* Where two or more individuals 
obtained the same weighted score, each was allotted the 
mean rank of the tied scores. The method of ranking the 
57 Vocabulary weighted scores is indicated in Table XXVIII, 
Appendix B, while the ranks assigned to the 57 subjects on 
each of the subtests, and on total Verbal and total Per¬ 
formance, are furnished In Table XXIX, Appendix B. 





42 


The next procedure was that of subtracting in turn 
each of the 10 regular subtest scores from the total score 
obtained by a subject* This rendered 10 ’partial totals 1 
constituting the various combinations of 9 subtest scores. 
Each of the 10 groups of 27 scores obtained in this manner 
was then ranked following the aforementioned method. The 
resulting ranks allotted to the 57 subjects are to be found 
in Table 2XX, Appendix B. 

The total Verbal score of an individual was now dimi¬ 
nished by each of his 5 Verbal subtest scores in turn* 

This gave scores which were designated as 1 total Verbal 
minus Information 1 , 1 total Verbal minus Comprehension 1 , 
f tctal Verbal minus Arithmetic 1 , * total Verbal minus Simi¬ 
larities 1 , and ’total Verbal minus Vocabulary 1 . The 57 
subjects were then ranked according to the magnitude of 
these 1 partial totals 1 . The 5 rankings are shown in 
Table 22X1, Appendix B. 

Similar Performance ’partial totals 1 were determined, 
rendering scores labelled as ’total Performance minus Pic¬ 
ture Completion*, ’total Performance minus Picture Arrange¬ 
ment 1 , ’total Performance minus Block Design 1 , ’total Per¬ 
formance minus Object Assembly 1 , and ’total Performance 
minus Coding 1 . The ranks assigned to the 57 subjects on 
the basis of these 5 combinations of Performance subtest 
scores are to be found in Table 2XXII, Appendix B.

After the ranking of the subjects had been completed, 
the actual calculation of the rank correlation coefficients 
was carried out. This involved the calculation of a score 
*S T whose magnitude was determined by the amount of agree¬ 
ment between a given pair of rankings of 37 subjects. The 

rank correlation coefficient f tau 1 was then computed by 

69 b 

applying the formula 7 

_ S _ 

tau b " V^n(n-l) - T ^/J-nCn-l) - U 

in which case n was 37, and T and U the corrections for 
ties in the two rankings. The computation of the rank 
correlation of the Vocabulary weighted scores with the 
sums of the 4 other Verbal weighted scores is carried out 
in detail in Appendix C. The procedure followed in testing 
the level of significance of the f tau f just obtained is 
also illustrated in Appendix G. 

II. RESULTS GE THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS 

The obtained correlation of each of the ten subtest 
weighted scores with the total of the nine other subtest 
weighted scores is given in Table IX. 

The coefficients of rank correlation of the 3 Verbal 
subtests with the total Verbal score, and of the 3 Perfor¬ 
mance subtests with the total Performance score are indi¬ 
cated, along with the levels of significance of these co-

The totals of the 3 Verbal subtest scores were cor¬ 
related with those of the 3 Performance subtest scores, 
resulting in a coefficient of rank correlation of -0.13. 
This coefficient was not significantly different from 
zero, however, at even the *10 level of confidence* For 
the purpose of comparing the magnitudes of two coeffi¬ 
cients computed by altogether different methods, the 
product-moment correlation was now determined from the 
same data, and found to b© -0.16. Once again the coef¬ 
ficient was not significantly different from zero, bearing 
out the fact that no relationship existed between total 
Verbal and total Performance scores for this sanpie of 
superior subjects. 

The weighted seores obtained by 32 subjects on the 
Digit Span subtest were ranked, as were the 32 correspon¬ 
ding total Verbal and Full Scale scores. These three 






























































47 


rankings are presented in Table XXXIII, Appendix B. Since 
the Digit Span scores affected the calculation of neither 
the Verbal nor the Full Scale Intelligence Quotients of 
the 32 subjects, no correction for spuriousness was required 
in the computation of rank correlation coefficients invol¬ 
ving Digit Span results* Consequently, the tau's were cal¬ 
culated directly between the Digit Span weighted scores and 
the totals of the 3 regular Verbal scores in one case, and 
the totals of the 10 subtest scores in the other* The co¬ 
efficients of mnk correlation of the Digit Span subtest 
with the total Verbal and with the Full Seale are to be 
found in Table XII#

III. DISCUSSION 

Table IX indicates that the correlation between scores 
on each of the 10 subtests and the Full Scale was extremely 
low in all cases, ranging from 0.24 to -0.20. Only 2 of the 





















48 


10 correlations were significantly different from zero at 
the .0j> level, those of Block Design with Full Scale, and 
Coding with Full Scale. Of special note was the fact that 
there was a significant negative correlation between the 
Coding subtest scores and the Full Scale scores. This 
would suggest that in the present sample of Superior chil¬ 
dren there was a slight but significant tendency for the 
Coding scores to be low when the sum of the other subtest 
scores was high, and vice versa. The Block Design sub test 
score was evidently the best single predictor of the Full 
Scale score since this subtest correlated to a greater 
degree than any of the others with the sum of the 5 other 
subtest scores. 

It may be seen in Table X that all of the 5 Verbal 
subtests with the single exception of Arithmetic correlated 
significantly with the sum of the 4 remaining Verbal sub¬ 
tests at the .05 level. The Information subtest, correla¬ 
ting .52 with the other Verbal subtests, was evidently the 
best predictor of the total Verbal score for this sample of 
Superior subjects. 

On the whole, there was a lower degree of correlation 
between Performance sub test scores and total Performance 
than between Verbal subtest scores and total Verbal. Only 
5 of the 5 Performance subtest scores, namely those of

4? 

Picture Arrangement, Block Design, and Object Assembly, 
correlated significantly with the sum of the 4 other Per¬ 
formance scores at the ,0j> level* 

There was no signif icant relationship between total 
Verbal and total Performance scores in this sample, whereas 

in Wechsler’s standardization group a correlation of about 

. 70 

♦ 60 was found to exist between these two sets of scores. 

The lack of correlation of Verbal with Performance scores 
in the present sample may be partially explained by the 
fact that the range of Verbal and Performance Intelligence 
Quotients was only about 40 I.Q. points, while the ITSC 
was standardized on a group that varied nearly 110 points 
in both Verbal and Performance Intelligence Quotients, 
Narrowing the I.Q. range in this manner and increasing 
the homogeneity of the group would logically tend to dimi¬ 
nish the degree of relationship between any two sets of 
scores, whether they be total Verbal and total Performance, 

Verbal subtest and total Verbal, or Performance subtest and 
71 

Full Seale, 

A comparison of the inter cor relation coefficients ob¬ 
tained in the present study with those determined by 
Weehsler at the 13s year level revealed a number of simi¬ 
larities in the order of magnitude of the coefficients.^ 2 
It was noted, for example, that in both the standardization

and the current semples: (a) of the 6 Verbal subtests, 
Information correlated highest with total Verbal; (b) the 
Digit Span and Arithmetic sub tests showed the least cor¬ 
relation with total Verbal; (c) the correlations of the 
Block Design and Object Assembly subtests with total Per¬ 
formance were of greatest magnitude in the Performance 
area; (d) the positive relationship between Coding and 
total Performance was relatively weak; (e) the Informa¬ 
tion subtest correlated to a considerably greater degree 
with the Pull Scale than did the Digit Span subtest; 

(f) of the 3 Performance subtests, Block Design showed 
the greatest eorrelation with t he full Scale. 

Stacey and Levin found that total Verbal and total 
Performance correlated *21 and -.31 in samples of 44 
morons and 26 borderline cases respectively^^, while 
Taylor obtained a rank correlation coefficient of .21 in 
a study involving 74 feeble-minded subjects.^ 4 The corres¬ 
ponding rank correlation coefficient obtained in the present 
investigation was not significantly different from zero, and 
appeared to compare more favorably with those derived in the 
Stacey and Levin and the Taylor studies than it did with 

Wechsler T s product-moment coefficients of .36, . 60 , and .68 

73 

at three age levels of the standardization sample.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 

1. A considerably lower degree of correlation between 
WISC subtest scores and total Verbal, total Performance, 
and Full Scale scores was found in this sample of 57 Supe¬ 
rior children than had previously been obtained for the 
WISC standardization sample of 2200 randomly chosen chil¬ 
dren. 

2* Judging from the results obtained in this investi¬ 
gation and in those conducted by Stacey and Levin, and by 
Taylor, the degree of correspondence between total Verbal 
and total Performance scores obtained from intellectually 
homogeneous samples is very slight. 

3# Block Design is possibly the strongest of the 11 
subtests as a predictor of the Full Scale score of a supe¬ 
rior child. 

4. The sealed score obtained by a superior subject 
on Information likely affords the best means of predicting 
his total Verbal score. 

5* Block Design appears to be a better measure than 
any other subtest of the abilities appraised on the Per¬ 


formance Scale

CHAPTER VII 


MEANS AND MEAN DIFFERENCES 

I. THE MEANS 

The subtest scaled scores obtained by the 57 superior 
subjects tested on the WISC are presented in Table XXVI, 
Appendix A. After grouping the scores on the II subtests 
into frequency distributions and choosing assumed means, 
the true means were computed by application of the formula*^ 


M = A.M. + (£ fxVlOi 


The variability of these scores about their means was found 
by calculating the standard deviations of the 11 distribu¬ 
tions. This, was accomplished by the ^aort method, the for¬ 


mula for which 1$^ 



The range, mean, and S.D. of each of the 11 distributions 
of subtest scaled scores are shown in Table XIII. 

The Verbal and Performance subtest scaled scores are 
totalled in columns (1) and (2) of Table XXVII, Appendix 
A, while Full Scale scores obtained by the 5 7 subjects 
appear in column ( 5 )* The ranges and means of these 5 



















distributions of scaled score totals are presented in 
Table XIV.

II. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEANS 

In the measurement of intelligence, certain assumptions 
are necessary for the mlidation of the many mathematical 
procedures employed by those who construct the tests. Ac¬ 
cording to Wech&Ler, one of the greatest contributions of 
Binet was his intuitive assumption that in the selection of 
the tests, it made little difference what tasks were used, 
provided that in some way they measured the child f s general 
intelligence.^® 

This method of combining a variety of tests into a 




















single measure of intelligence presupposes a certain func¬ 
tional unity or equivalence between the tests. 

The functional equivalence of the test items, 
an assumption implicit not only in the Binet Scale 
but in any scale which is composed of a variety or 
pool of intellectual tasks, is absolutely necessary 
for the validation of the arithmetic employed in 
arriving at a final measure of intelligence. This 
arithmetic consists, first, of assigning some nume¬ 
rical value to every correct response; secondly, of 
adding the partial credits so obtained into a simple 
sum; and, thirdly, of treating equal sums as equi¬ 
valent, irrespective of the nature of the test items 
which contribute to the total.7° 

The WISC scaled scores have been so derived as to 

provide, at each age and for each of the separate tests, 

Bn 

a mean scaled score of 10 and a standard deviation of 3. 
The Verbal and Performance Intelligence Quotients are de¬ 
pendent upon the sums of Verbal and 5 Performance sub¬ 
test scaled scores respectively. The Full Seale I .Q. is 
derived by adding the totals of the Verbal and the Perfor¬ 
mance scaled scores to obtain a Full Scale score, and then 

by referring to a table ishich converts these Full Seale 

81 

scores into Full Scale Intelligence Quotients. Thus 
each WISC subtest may be considered to contribute an equal 
amount to the determination of the Full Scale I.Q. 

The means of the 10 subtest scaled scores obtained 
from a large, randomly-chosen sample should theoretically 
all have the value of 10, rendering total Verbal and total 
Performance mean scores of .50, a Full Scale mean score of

$(> 


100, and mean Verbal, Performance and Full Scale Intelli¬ 
gence Quotients of 100* Differences occurring in the 
various subtest means, and in the means of the Verbal and 
Performance Intelligence Quotients should be small if they 
exist at all, and should be attributable only to errors in 
sampling. 

In practice, it has been found that in samples of 
intellectually atypical subjects, such is rarely the case. 
These more homogeneous groups appear to do considerably 
better on certain of the subtests than on others, and mean 
scores may vary to the degree that one cannot attribute 
their differences solely to sampling errors. In order to 
test the hypothesis that certain of the 1ISC subtests 
offer less difficulty than others at the superior level, 
a statistical analysis of the differences between mean 
subtest scores was undertaken. 

The significance of the difference between any pair 
of subtest scaled score means was determined by calcula¬ 
ting the T t T or critical ratio associated with the dif¬ 
ference, and by then referring to a t-table for the pur¬ 
pose of testing the magnitude of the calculated critical 
ratio. It was felt by members of the Department of Mathe¬ 
matics, University of Alberta, that the commonly employed 
t-formulas should not be applied with the current data, 
inasmuch as the use of these statistical methods presup-

posed certain conditions of normality, independence of 
means, and canmon variance that could not be assumed to 
exist. An alternate procedure, that of computing t*s by 
comparison of scores in pairs, was suggested as the most 
appropriate. Accordingly, all critical ratios were cal¬ 
culated by applying the formula^ 2

Table XVI(a) indicates the levels of significance 
of the differences between subtest mean sealed scores ob¬ 
tained in this study. Table XVI(b) is of a similar nature, 
but involves the Digit Span subtest, with M of 5Z rather 
than of 37* 

The difference between the mean Verbal and the mean 
Performance Intelligence Quotients obtained in this 
investigation was tested for significance by the employ¬ 
ment of the Brookes and Dick formula. The actual differ¬ 
ence of 6.33 1*0,* points was found to be significant at 
the .01 level. 


III. Discussion 


The magnitude of the obtained subtest weighted or 
scaled scores varied from 6 up to the ceiling of 20, with 
the range in all cases being about 10 scaled score units.

Subtest means ranged from 12,70 to 13.33, indicating that 
the group’s achievement was above average on all of the 
eleven WISC subtests. Highest mean scores were obtained 
in Comprehension and Arithmetic, while the Picture Arrange¬ 
ment and Coding tests apparently offered the greatest dif¬ 
ficulty, since their mean scores were the lowest of the 
eleven. 

The standard deviations of the subtest weighted scores 
were commonly between 2,1 and 2,3 score units, with extreme 
values of 1.8 and 2.9 occurring in the Vocabulary and Pic¬ 
ture Completion distributions respectively. Standard devi¬ 
ations of the subtest score distributions were on the whole 
rather less than those obtained in the standardization re¬ 
search, where sigma values of 2,6 to 3.2 were common .$3 
The fact that the variability of scores in the present 
sample is not as great as it was in Weehsler f s is not sur¬ 
prising, since a more homogeneous group is being examined. 

The range of both Verbal and Performance Intelligence 
Quotients obtained in the study was just over 40 points of 
I.Q., with the Verbal upper and lower limits being about 9 
points higher than the corresponding Performance limits. 

The mean Verbal I.Q. of the 37 subjects closely approxi¬ 
mated their mean lull Scale I.Q., while both of these means 
exceeded the average of the Performance Intelligence Quo¬ 
tients by nearly 6J- points. This finding is in agreement

with one reported by V/echsler. 

It should be noted that although individual Verbal 
and Performance Intelligence Quotients were as low as 10? 
and ?? respectively, the least Pull scale I.Q. was never¬ 
theless 12 0. This peculiarity is explained by the fact 
that positive and negative discrepancy scores between Ver¬ 
bal and Performance Intelligence Quotients were quite 
large in several instances. To cite an example, the sub¬ 
ject who scored 10? I.Q. on the Verbal Scale obtained a 
Performance quotient of 140, resulting in a Pull Scale I. 

Q. of 126. It will be recalled that all subjects consi¬ 
dered in this investigation attained or exceeded a Pull 
Scale I.Q. of 120, regardless of their achievement on the 
Verbal and Performance Scales separately. 

The standard deviations of both the Verbal and Per¬ 
formance I.Q. distributions were considerably less than 

those obtained in Wechsler’s research, being only about ? 

85 

as compared with 1? I.Q. points. This diminished vari¬ 
ability of I.Q. is understandable, inasmuch as only supe¬ 
rior subjects were considered in the current study. 

Many of the observed means were found to be signifi¬ 
cantly different at the .01 level of confidence. The 
writer was interested in knowing the probability that given 
differences or greater positive ones might have arisen from 
sampling errors when the true differences were zero. Where

two means were significantly different at the .02 level, 
the probability that the smaller mean was equal to or 
exceeded the larger in the universe was one-half of *02, 
or .01, since a one-tail rather than a two-tail test was 

< i * 86 

involved. 

Accordingly, a number of conclusions were drawn re¬ 
garding the differing magnitudes of the subtest means ob¬ 
tained in this study. These findings are listed below. 

1. The mean scores obtained by the superior sub¬ 
jects on Comprehension and Arithmetic were significantly 
greater at the .01 level than their mean scores on Vocabu¬ 
lary, Digit Span, Picture Completion, Picture Arrangement, 
Object Assembly, and Coding. The Comprehension mean, in 
addition, was found to be greater than the Information 
and Similarities means at this level of confidence. 

2. The mean scores obtained on Information and Simi¬ 
larities were significantly greater at the .01 level than 
the mean scores on Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, 
and Coding. The Information mean also exceeded those of 
Vocabulary and Picture Completion at this level. 

3* The mean score obtained on Block Design was sig¬ 
nificantly greater at the .01 level than the mean scores 
computed for all of the remaining Performance subtests. 

4. No Verbal subtest mean score was significantly 
greater at the .01 level than that obtained on Block

Design. 

3* Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, and Coding 
means were each exceeded by the means of at least five 
other subtests at the .01 level of confidence. 

6. The Digit Span mean score was not significantly 
greater at the .01 level than the mean scores obtained on 
any of the five Performance subtests. 

IV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

On the assumption that the WISC subtests are func¬ 
tionally equivalent, and that all contribute by equal 
amounts to a measure of the global capacity of a child, 
a statistical analysis was undertaken in an effort to 
determine whether or not certain of the subtests offer 
less difficulty than others for superior subjects. The 
conclusions to be drawn are as follows: 

1. For this sample of 37 superior children, the 
Comprehension and Arithmetic subtests were less difficult 
than the majority of the remaining WISC subtests; 

2. The Information, Similarities, and Block Design 
subtests offered less challenge than three of the Perfor¬ 
mance subtests: Picture Arrangement, Object Assembly, and 
Coding; 

3. The Block Design subtest was found by the group 
to be less complex than any of the other Performance sub-

CHAPTER VIII 


THE DISCREPANCY SCORE SURVEY 

Seashore has defined a WISC "discrepancy score" as 
the numerical difference between a subject's Verbal I.Q. 
and his Performance I.Q. ^7 In the calculation of these 
scores, Performance I.Q. is always subtracted from Ver¬ 
bal I.Q., making possible both positive and negative 
88 

discrepancies. Thus if Subject A has a Verbal I.Q. of 
13 and a Performance I.Q. of 112, his discrepancy score 
is f23. On the other hand, Subject B with a Verbal I.Q. 
of 119 and a Performance I.Q. of 127 has a discrepancy 
score of -8. 

The writer wished to compare the discrepancy scores 

obtained in the present investigation with those found 

89 

both in Taylor's sample of 74 feeble-minded subjects, / 
and in the standardization study. The object of this 
survey was to determine whether or not a definite trend 
exists in the nature of the distributions of discrepancy 
scores obtained in samples of atypical subjects. 

The discrepancy scores obtained in the standardiza¬ 
tion study have been estimated by considering alternately 
Figure 1 and Table III included in Seashore's publication

the various levels of discrepancy with perfect accuracy 
due to the lack of precise data presented in the article, 
nevertheless it was felt that the frequencies arrived at

4*1.3 may be estimated from the polygon to be slightly more 
than 220. Table XVII discloses that the number of subjects 
obtaining absolute discrepancy scores of 0 and 1 was actu¬ 
ally 86 plus 140, i.e. 226. This frequency of 226 has been 
placed in its appropriate position In Table XVIII, and the 
remainder of this table was drawn up by working alternately 
from Figure 2 to Table XVII in the manner indicated. The

and these constitute Figure 

DISCUSSION 

Table XIX reveals that the frequency of the discrepan¬ 
cy scores is greatest in the central interval of each of 
the three distributions under consideration. These central 
intervals have midpoints of zero, suggesting that discre¬ 
pancy scores tend to assume a value near zero regardless 
of whether the sample has been randomly chosen, or has been 
composed only of intellectually atypical subjects. It 
should be noted, however, that the frequencies in column 
(2) of Table XIX are far more symmetrically distributed 
about the central interval than are the frequencies in 
either of columns (1) or (3)« Positive discrepancy scores 
for the subnormal group tend to diminish in frequency more 
rapidly as magnitude increases than do the corresponding 
negative scores. This trend is quite the opposite in the 
superior group, for the number of positive scores greatly 
outweighs the number of negative scores. In the third 
group, viz. the standardization sample, the rate of de¬ 
crease in frequency with increasing absolute magnitude is 
practically identical for both positive and negative dis¬ 
crepancies. 

Table XX bears out these findings. The percentage of 















■ 




■ 



. 

c 














































. 






. 

























72 


the frequencies within the central interval is practically 
constant for the three samples, varying only from values 
of 28% to 51%• However, whereas 44% of the discrepancy 
scores are less than -4.5 for the mentally deficient group, 
the proportion decreases to 56% for the randomly-selected 
group, and to only 19% for the sample of superior subjects. 
On the other hand, the percentage of the discrepancy scores 
which are greater than 4.5 increases from 24% for the sub¬ 
normal group to 56% for the standardization sample and to 
52% for the superior group. Thus there Is apparently a 
tendency for the percentage of positive discrepancy scores 
to vary directly with the mean WISC Full Scale I. ft. of the 
sample. 

The unsmoothed frequency polygons in Figure 5 indicate 
this tendency pictorially. The polygon representing the 
distribution of the subnormal group T s discrepancy scores 
is shewed positively or to the right, while that of the 
superior group is skewed negatively. The distribution of 
discrepancy scores for the standardization sample differs 
from the two other distributions in that it is very nearly 
symmetric in form. 

The aforementioned findings are in harmony with those 
reported by Wechsler for the Bellevue Scale standardization 
sample.He found that of the 41 subjects in the 10 - 16

age group who attained I.Q. scores of more than 120 on the 
Wechsler-Bellevue, 82. 97 . had greater Verbal Intelligence 
Quotients than Performance Intelligence Quotients. The 
proportion of cases obtaining positive discrepancy scores 
decreased to 4?.9% in the average group, and to 2j>.0% in 
the subnormal group, strongly indicating the same trend 
found in the present study. 

CONCLUSIONS 

1. The nature of the distribution of discrepancy 
scores obtained by a group of children tested on the WISO 
appears to depend upon the level of mental ability of the 
group. A highly intelligent group apparently tends to 
obtain a greater proportion of positive than of negative 
discrepancy scores, while the reverse tendency seems to be 
indicated for a mentally inferior group. 

2. Although the standardization procedures for the 
WISC were designed to result in a difference of zero points 
of I.Q. between the averages of Verbal and Performance in¬ 
telligence quotients, the mean I.Q. of a group appears to 
determine whether or not this desired difference of zero 
points will be obtained. It seems likely that the more the 
mean Pull Scale I.Q. of an intellectually homogeneous group 
deviates from 100, the greater will be the difference between 
the means of the Verbal and the Performance Intelligence 
Quotients of the group.

CHAPTER IX 


ADEQUACY OE SUBTEST CEILINGS 

One of the chief criticisms of the Wechsler-Bellevue 
Scale is that it does not measure effectively the degree 
of superiority of gifted subjects.^ 4 Wechsler is well 
aware of this criticism and has responded by stating that 
it is not possible to measure general intelligence beyond 
a certain level. 

IQ T s above 130, whether on the Bellevue or 
any other tests, do not represent superiority 
in intelligence level, but special aptitude in 
intellectual ability. 95 

At the same time, however, he has attempted to pacify 
the critics by extending the range of the Verbal part of 
the Wechsler-Bellevue Scale at the upper levels, and by 
extending the maximum score possible on them from 1? to 
18 . This move was designed to furnish more discriminating 
scores for Intelligence Quotients above 120.^ 

Little has been published to date on the adequacy of 
the WISC as a measure of the degree of intellectual supe¬ 
riority among children. The question apparently remains 
unanswered as to whether or not this more recent test of 
Wechsler 1 s has eliminated the aforementioned basis on 
which the Bellevue Scale was criticized. In this light, 
consequently, the writer analyzed the scores obtained by

the 66 subjects of potentially superior intelligence who 
were tested in the present investigation. 

Fifty-seven of these 66 testees earned the superior 
grading defined by Wechsler, 120 I.Q. on the Full Scale. 

Of the no less than 11 obtained perfect raw scores on 
at least one subtest, while 2 achieved maximum allowable 
scores on 2 of the subtests. Of the ? subjects who failed 
to score 120 I.Q. on the Full Scale, one obtained perfect 
raw scores on 2 subtests, and at the same time earned the 
maximum scaled or weighted rating of 20 points on a third 
subtest. 

Perfect raw scores were obtained on 4 of the 11 WISC 
subtests administered in the investigation. Table XXI 
offers information as to the number, sex, and range in 
chronological age of the testees who supplied correct res¬ 
ponses to all of the items, and who in addition earned the 
maximum time bonuses allowed, on the 4 subtests involved.

scores on both the Arithmetic and Digit Span subtests. 

This subject had a chronological age of 14-2, and Verbal, 
Performance, and Full Scale Intelligence Quotients of 126, 
99 , and llj? respectively.

Table XXIY has been designed to indicate the maximum 
raw scores obtained by the 57 subjects at different age 
levels. Although the data include the scores of only one 
testee in each of age groups 7, 8, 10, and 15, the frequen¬ 
cies are greater at the remaining age levels, and a trend 
toward higher scores with increasing age is noticeable. 

The lone seven-year-old was not administered the Digit 
Span subtest, and the Coding A test result which he obtained 
was not comparable to the Coding B raw scores obtained by 
the testees of eight years and over. 

Further analysis of the subtest results indicated that 
6 subjects obtained raw scores sufficiently high to entitle 
them to subtest scaled scores of 20. A description of the

It may be pointed out here that Subject (6) in Table 
XX! V failed to fulfill the requirements for the Superior 
grading as his lull Scale I.Q. was found to be only 115. 
He is the testee, incidentally, to whom reference has 
already been made. 


DISCUSSION 

Table SXE furnishes evidence to the effect that seve¬ 
ral of the WISC subtests are not supplied with material 
difficult enough to tax the mental potentialities of a 
substantial proportion of either Superior or Bright Normal 
subjects. One can hardly dispute the fact that a testee 
who has earned a perfect score on any of the 11 subtests 
may well have been capable of supplying correct responses 
to more difficult test items. 

The Arithmetic subtest appears to be weakest in this 
respect since 9 of 57 subjects, or approximately 15 % of 
the sample, were able to supply correct solutions to all 
of the 16 problems. The youngest testee who was capable 
of earning a perfect score in Arithmetic was just over 12 
years of age, indicating that even Problem 16 is not too 
challenging for children who experience little difficulty 
in mathematics. 

The writer feels that the Arithmetic and Digit Span 
subtests in particular will not necessarily assist in dif-

ferentiating between the mental abilities of two subjects 
who possess superior intelligence. To a lesser degree, 
the Object Assembly and Block Design subtests are subject 
to the same criticism. 

An examination of Table XXI leads to the hypothesis 
that only six of the WISC subtests, viz. Information, 
Comprehension, Similarities, Vocabulary, Picture Arrange¬ 
ment, and Coding, have ceilings of sufficient height to 
allow for the complete testing of the Bright Formal or 
Superior subject. While not one of the current testees 
was able to achieve a perfect raw score of 20 on Picture 
Completion, the score of 19 obtained by a 13 year-old 
occasions some wonder in the mind of the writer that this 
subtest has not been completely mastered by older subjects. 

The entries in Table XXIII imply that subjects who 
have realized perfect raw scores on any subtest possess 
somewhat higher Verbal and lull Beale Intelligence Quo¬ 
tients than subjects who have not been able to secure a 
maximum allowable score. The frequencies, however, are 
not large, and the finding is probably inconclusive. 

Wechsler’s method of equating all raw scores exceeding 
a certain value to the maximum scaled score of 20 appears 
to be open to criticism. This scheme does not allow for 
differentiation between the abilities of two subjects who 
have done especially well on certain of the subtests. To 


-

cite an example, Subject Two described in Table XXV ob¬ 
tained the amazingly high raw score of 20 on the similari¬ 
ties subtest at the age of only 7 years, 10 months. The 
conversion table on page 35 of the WISG manual discloses 
that this subject has earned the maximum scaled score of 
20. This is also the scaled score which he would have 
obtained had his raw score been as low as 13 or as high 
as 28 . 

Although Wechsler in his WISG conversion tables has 
provided for those subjects who earn average or below 
average raw scores, it appears that he has not concentra¬ 
ted too much attention on the potential accomplishments 
of superior children. In the present instance, the writer 
feels that Subject Two has earned a scaled score of possi¬ 
bly 22 to 24 points rather than the score of 20 which must 
be assigned to him. In a similar manner, Subject One in 
Table XXII seems to be somewhat hindered by the fact that 
he can earn no more than 20 points for his efforts on the 
Coding subtest. 

Wechsler was aware that this type of weakness existed 
in the parent Wechsler-Bellevue Scale, and remedied the 
situation by raising the maximum scaled scores from 1? to 
18.^ He may feel the need in a future revision of the 
WISC to make some alteration of a similar nature.

CONCLUSIONS 

1# There is concrete evidence to indicate that 
several of the WISC subtests do not possess sufficiently 
high ceilings to measure fully the mental abilities of 
certain gifted adolescents# The Arithmetic and Digit 
Span subtests appear to be weakest in this respect, since 
in the current study perfect raw scores were obtained 
most frequently on these tests# It was found that sub¬ 
jects were also capable of completely mastering the Object 
Assembly and Block Design subtests# 

2# Only six of the WISC subtests, namely Information, 
Comprehension, Similarities, Vocabulary, Picture Arrange¬ 
ment, and Coding appear to have adequate ceilings. The 
Maze test was not administered in this study. 

5. On certain of the subtests, the maximum scaled 
score of 20 appears to hinder the measurement of differ¬ 
ences between the mental abilities of a few superior 
subjects# In the present investigation it was felt that 
the respective ranges of the raw scores assigned to scaled 
scores of 20 for the Coding and Similarities subtests were 
too broad, and that scaled scores above 20 should right¬ 
fully be introduced in these instances. 









CHAPTER X 


CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

I. CONCLUSIONS 

This study was undertaken in an effort to gather 
information concerning the achievement of mentally 
superior children on a relatively new intelligence 
scale, the WISC* The scores of subjects who attained 
or exceeded a Full Scale I.Q* of 120 were examined indi¬ 
vidually and collectively for the purpose of ascertaining 
their exact nature♦ 

A summary of the conclusions drawn from this inves¬ 
tigation follows: 

1. It is evidently not possible to predict with 
accuracy the WISC Full Scale I.Q. of a mentally superior 
subject by reference to his achievement on any one of the 
subtests; 

2. Decreasing the intellectual heterogeneity of a 
group of subjects to be tested on the WISC will likely 
result in a material lowering of all part-whole correla¬ 
tions associated with this scale; 

3. Superior subjects have a tendency to obtain 
higher Verbal Intelligence Quotients than Performance 
Intelligence Quotients on the WISC; 


































. . 










. 


























84 


4. Highly intelligent children tend to obtain above- 
average scaled scores on every WISG subtest; 

5>. Subjects of superior intelligence tend to experi¬ 
ence less difficulty on the Comprehension and Arithmetic 
subtests than on the majority of the remaining subtests; 

6. There is an apparent tendency for the percentage 
of positive discrepancy scores to vary directly as the 
mean WISC Full Scale I.Q,. of an intellectually homogeneous 
group; 

7. It appears that of the 11 WISG subtests adminis¬ 
tered in this investigation, only Information, Comprehension, 
Similarities, Vocabulary, Picture Arrangement, and Coding 
have ceilings of sufficient height to permit the complete 
testing of certain superior subjects; 

8. The procedure adopted by Weehsler of equating 
numerous raw scores to an uppermost scaled score of 20 
appears to be open to criticism inasmuch as it occasion¬ 
ally hinders the precise measurement of individual dif¬ 
ferences. 

II. RFCOMMHFDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR 
FUTURE STUDIES 

1. The number of studies conducted with mentally 
superior subjects is not great. Much has yet to be ac¬ 
complished in this field.

2. The writer feels that the present investigation 
is one of the first of its kind. Some of the results ob¬ 
tained for this sample of 57 subjects are novel and unex¬ 
pected. Future studies may either bear out these findings 
or disprove them. 

5. A distribution of superior Intelligence Quotients 
is undeniably non-normal, a fact which renders invalid the 
use of Pearson f s f r l . The Kendall method of rank correla¬ 
tion employed in this study was found to be somewhat cum¬ 
bers cme for N as large as 57, chiefly because of the in¬ 
fluence of the numerous tied ranks on the complexity of 
the mathematical procedures involved. 

4. It is felt that a statistical analysis should be 
made in the near future of the results obtained by the 
179 superior subjects who constituted the upper section 
of the standardization sample for the W3B0.

Kendall dealt with the problem of tied ranks by em¬ 
ploying what he called the T mid-rank method*. 

When there is nothing to choose between indi¬ 
viduals, we must clearly rank them all alike if we 
rank them at all; and our method has the advantage 
that the sum of the ranks for all members remains 
the same as for an untied ranking. 

In the current situation, 4 subjects obtained weighted 
or scaled scores of 17 points on the Vocabulary subtest* The 
rank of 3*5 assigned to each of these subjects was computed 
by adding the ranks of 2, 3, 4 and 3 which would have been 
allotted had the scores been distinguishable, and dividing 
the sum by 4. 

Again, 4 subjects obtained scaled scores of 16 on the 
subtest. Each was assigned the rank i(6-^7 +3*9) - 7ib 
By a similar method, tied ranks were computed for subjects 
who obtained scores of 13, 14, 13, 12 and 11.

STEPS IN THE CALCULATION OP T S f FOR VOCABULARY 
VS. SUM OF FOUR REMAINING VERBAL SCALED SCORES 


1. Ranks obtained on the Vocabulary subtest (see 
column headed Vocabulary T , Table XXIX) were arranged in 
order of magnitude, beginning with the uppermost rank of 
one, obtained by subject 47, and ending with the lowest 
rank of 37, obtained by subject 51* The rearranged Voca¬ 
bulary ranking is to be found in column (2), Table XXXIV. 

2. The rank of each subject based on the sum of his 
scaled scores on the four remaining Verbal subtests (see 
appc opriate column, Table XXXI) was then paired with his 
rank obtained on Vocabulary. This ranking appears in 
column (3), Table XXXIV. 

3. Subject 47 T s contribution to T S T was now deter¬ 
mined. This involved counting the number of times his 
rank of 1.3 in column (3) exceeded the ranks of other sub¬ 
jects below him in the same column. It may be seen that 
he was tied in rank only by subject 3, while his rank of 
1.3 exceeded those of 33 other subjects. His contribution 
to T S f , accordingly, was set at 4*33* This value appears 
as the first entry in column (4), Table XXXIV. 

4* Subjects 24, 31, 44 and 48 were each allotted a 
rank of 3*3 on Vocabulary. As a result, the contribution 
to T S f by each of these subjects is computed only from 
ranks which fall below the dotted line located under the 
entries for subject 48. 

3o Subject 24 obtained the rank of 6 on the remaining 
Verbal subtests. This rank exceeds those of 43 of the 32 
subjects below the dotted line following subject 48 T s en¬ 
tries. Only subjects 3, 36 and 22, with ranks of 1.3, 3 
and 4 respectively, exceeded subject 24 on the combined 
tests. Accordingly, subject 24 f s contribution to T S r was 
found to be (43-3) or *46. This value constitutes the 
second entry in column (4). 

6 . The remaining 33 entries in column (4) were deter¬ 
mined in the manner just described. A negative contribu¬ 
tion to T S 1 resulted where a subjects rank in column (3) 
exceeded the ranks below it on fewer occasions than these 
ranks in turn exceeded the rank of the subject. 

7. T S r was computed by adding the values of the 37 
entries in column (4).

COMPUTATION OF THE RANK CORRELATION COEFFICIENT 
T TAU r FOR VOCABULARY VS. FOUR REMAINING VERBAL 

SUBTESTS 


113 


Where tied ranks exist in both rankings, Kendall 
defines his coefficient of rank correlation as 


_S__ 

taU " -/§-n(n-l) - 0? /l-n(n-l) - U 

In the present instance, S = +476 (calculated in Table 
XJOCIV), £n(n-l) = H57)(56) = 1596, T = 227, and U = 65 . 
T and U are correction terms whose magnitudes are deter¬ 
mined by the number of ties in the two rankings. 


In the ranking of Vocabulary scores presented in col¬ 
umn (2) of Table XXXIV, there are seen to be seven sets 
of ties: one set composed of three ties, two sets of four 
apiece, one of nine, two of eleven, and one of twelve. 

The correction for ties in the first of a pair of 
rankings is given by Kendall as 

T = |Z t t(U) 

Here, the values of *t f to be substituted in the formula 
were in turn 3, 4, 4* 9, 11, 11, and 12. T then became 
!Lp)(2) * (4)05) - (4)0) * (95(8) * ( 11 )( 10 ) * ( 11 )( 10 ) 
v (12)(11)J = 227. 


U was obtained by applying the correction formula for 
ties in the second of a pair of rankings being correlated. 
This formula is 


u =~£2 u (u-i) 


In the second ranking being considered (column 3, Table 
XXXIV), there are seven sets of two ties, three sets of 
three ties, four sets of four, one of five, and one of 
six. The values of f u f to be substituted in the formula 
were then 2, 2, 2, 2^ 2, 2 ? 2 ? 3, ^3, ^4, 4, 4, 4, 5, and 

6 . Hence U became i 

(1)00(4) * (1)0000 


p (2 & 5 


(? 5 ( 35(25 +’( 45 ( 45(35 


Tau was found by substituting the calculated values 
of S, §n(n-l), T, and U in the formula for rank correlation. 


Accordingly, 
tau = 


_ *476 

^ 1596-227 ^ 1596-65 


+476 

1448 


+0.329 













114 

TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OBSERVED RANH 

CORRELATION COEFFICIENT T TAU f FOR VOCABULARY 

VS. FOUR REMAINING VERBAL SUBTESTS 

The question arose as to whether or not the obtained 
tau value of +0.329 for Vocabulary vs. the remaining four 
Verbal subtests indicated that a correlation actually ex¬ 
ists in the population from which the sample of 37 was 
chosen. According to Kendall, a test of tau is equivalent 
to a test of the corresponding value of S, in this case, 
+4?6. 

The variance of S was computed by applying the formula 
Var S = l/l8[n(n-l)(2n+5) - - 

2 u u(u-l)(2ut5j]» k t t(t-l)(t-2)] 

[ 2 u u(u-l)(u- 2 )] * SuTjJ [X t t(t-l)JZ u u(u-l)] 

In the present instance, there were ties of extent 
t = 3, 4, 4, 9, 11, 11, and 12 in the first ranking, and 
of extent u = 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 

3, and 6 in the second ranking. 

As a result of these ties, 



11802 

^u(u-l)(2u+5) = 

1758 

£ t t(t-l)(t- 2 ) = 

3858 

£ u u(u-1)(u-2) =

Since the value of n was 57 


115 


n(n-l)(2n+5) = 375848 
9n(n-l)(n-2) = 1580040 
2n(n-l) = 6384 


On substituting these computed values, the variance of S 
reduced to 

Tar S = 1/18[37?848 - (11802 + 1758}) 

, (5858)(294) (454)(150) 

1580040 6384 

Var S =■ 20359.2

S - 1 _ 475 


<T s 


With a correction for continuity, 


<fs 


142.7 


3*33 


Therefore, S (corrected) = 2*33 

From Kendall’s Appendix Table 2 it may be seen that 
the probability of a deviation less than 2*23 is about 
0.99931* The probability that 2*33 is obtained or ex¬ 
ceeded in absolute value is thus about 2(l - 0.99991) 

= 0.0008. This is less than 0.001, and it may be conclu¬ 
ded that the observed value of S, and consequently that 
of Tau, is highly significant, and is not different from 
zero due to accidents of sampling.

From a table of t for % degrees of freedom, one finds 
the entries 2.59 and 2.6? at the .02 and .01 levels res¬ 
pectively. Hence the mean difference of +1.544 is sig¬ 
nificant at the *005 level, and there is reason to be¬ 
lieve that superior subjects find the Comprehension sub¬ 
test less difficult than the Vocabulary subtest.
