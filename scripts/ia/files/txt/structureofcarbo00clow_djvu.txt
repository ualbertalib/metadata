CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

Location, Boundaries and Access 

The map-area herein designated as the Carbondale area 
lies in the foothill and mountainous district of southwestern 
Alberta, It is located seven miles south of Blairmore, which is 
an important coal mining centre in the Crowsnest Pass, and about 
fifteen miles west of the town of Pincher Creek, The map-areas 
adjoining are Blairmore (Leach, Rose, 1920) on the north, and 
Beaver Mines (Hage, ipliG) on the east. Excepting for ten and one- 
half square miles in the northeast comer, the map-area is within 
the Rocky Mountains Forest Preserve, The portion south of the 
Carbondale river lies within a game preserve. The Carbondale River 
map-area lies wholly within the territory drained by the Castle 
and Carbondale rivers, both of which are tributary to the Oldman 
river. 

The northern boundary of the Carbondale River map-area 
is h9° 30 s north latitude and the eastern boundary is 111]° 15 1 west 
longitude. The area is confined on the west by the British 
Golumbia-Alberta boundary. The southern boundary is the northern 
limit of the Precambrian overthrust, which traces a sinuous path 
through the northern portion of township k and the southern part 
of township 5*

Three main roads serve the area. One branches from the 
Crowsnest highway at Bellevue, another forks south from the same 
highway at Burmis post office and a third travels west from Pincher 
Creek. The first mentioned is for the greater part a private road. 
This route passes through Hillcrest and follows along the valley 
of Byron creek and past the Adanac coal mine to the summit. From 
thence it follows the valley of Webb creek to the Carbondale river, 
descending 1300 feet in so doing. It proceeds up the Carbondale 
valley and branches out to the various lumber camps on 0 ! Hagen and 
Gardiner creeks and the Carbondale river. This road is kept in 
good condition and is passable even under severe conditions of rain 
or snow. The road branching from Burmis proceeds south to the 
Castle river, follows up the Castle to its confluence with the 
Carbondale river and at this point forks. One fork joins with the 
first mentioned road while the other fork follows up the Castle 
river to the Castiemount ranger station where It trifurcates, two 
branches continuing along either side of the south fork of Castle 
river and the other following the west branch. The main road from 
Burmis is usually rough but was passable at all times. The third 
road, which is from Pincher Creek, follows along Beaver Mines 
creek to about three miles southwest of Beaver Mines post office. 

At this point the road bifurcates, the right branch passing over 
a low summit to join the Burmis road at the Castiemount ranger 
station. Many smaller roads, some of which are still passable.

have been built for lumbering operations. 

Pack trails, in the northern part of the area, follow 
along the main creeks. This portion is not accessible by road. 
There are trails along Lynx creek and its branches, along Lost 
creek, and along Carbondale river. This last one commences at 
the termination of the road at the Burmis Lumber Company camp and 
continues west along Carbondale river to its headwaters, then 
through North Kootenay Pass into British Columbia and to the Flat- 
head valley* These pack trails have not been kept in repair, it 
being necessary on all of them to cut out windfall and detour 
slideouts and marshes that had been corduroyed many years before. 

A pack train, was used for hi days, during which time 
approximately one third of the area was covered. In surveying the 
remainder an automobile was used. 

Previous Work in the Region 

The first records of the geology' of the southwestern 
part of Alberta were made by Dr. J. Hector (Hector, 1863) who did 
the geological mapping for Captain J. Palliser’s expedition. 

Hector did not visit the mapped area, but Palliser and his 
secretary journeyed through North Kootenay Pass on returning to 
Edmonton from British Columbia territory. G. M. Dawson (Dawson, 
1885, 1886) made a preliminary survey in the area. He traversed 
the area from the east side of the present map-area to the summit

- h - 


of North Kootenay Pass. His observations include a description of 
coal seams, volcanics and a summary of the structure of the region. 
R. C. McConnell did work in the region, particularly that of divid¬ 
ing the rocks into formations (McConnell, 1887). D. B. Dowling 
worked in the Cascade coal basin (Dowling, 19u3, 1901|) and also 
made a compilation of the coal reserves of Western Canada. R. A. 
Daly (Daly, 1912) surveyed and described the formations and struc¬ 
ture along the forty-ninth parallel. 

The area immediately adjoining the Garbondale area to 
the north, due to its importance as a coal field, has been 
thoroughly investigated. W. W. Leach (Leach, 1905) was one of the 
first to examine it. Leach surveyed the coal field in 1911 and 
1912 and published stratigraphic and structural reports together 
with a preliminary map (Leach, 1911). The Flathead coal field, 
lying in British Columbia, immediately west of the Flathead and 
Clarke ranges, was surveyed by J. D* MacKenzie in 1912. In the 
same year he made a preliminary survey of the present area which 
at that time was known as the South Fork area (MacKenzie, 1912). 
Leach’s work in Alberta was continued by B. Rose, (Rose, 191$), 
who published a detailed geological map of the Blairmore map-area. 
This was followed in 1916 by a report on the stratigraphy and 
structure. In 1915 F. H. McLeam investigated and~wrete-~-an 
accountr-of the Jurassic and Cretaceous of the Crowsnest Pass 
(McLearn, 1915). He later published a bulletin describing the 







- 5 » 


Mesozoic paleontology of the region (McLearn, 1929). 

Later G. S. Hume, B. R. MacKay, Pierre de Bethune and 
Robin Willis contributed reports on the areal and regional geology. 
Hume has contributed particularly to our knowledge of the structure 
of the area by his observations in the North Kootenay Pass (Hume, 
1932). MacKay worked in the Crowsnest Pass area from 1930 to 1932, 
and has described in some detail the stratigraphy and structure 
with special attention being given to the coal measures and coal 
mines. Pierre de Bethune, geologist with West Canadian Collieries, 
described the structure of the Rocky Mountain ranges adjacent to 
the Flathead and Elk River valleys (Bethune, 1936). R. Willis and 
B. R. Hake working for private interests compiled a map of the 
region. 

P. S. Warren has described the rock sequence in the 
Crowsnest Pass (Warren, 1933) , and has also surveyed and described 
the Fernie formation in the region, particularly in the Fernie 
basin (Warren, 1931* 1932, 1931;). In 191*8 M. B. B. Crockford spent 
several days in the area making reconnaissance surveys, preparatory 
to detailed surveys which ?;ere being considered for 191*9. 

Present Work 

Survey of the Garbondale River area was planned and 
carried out during the 19L9 summer season. This area was chosen 
because of the possibilities of economic recovery of coal from

the Kootenay strata, because Kootenay coal seams which extend into 
the area are mined economically in the north* 

Monuments and survey lines, established by the Dominion 
Government early in the century, were used to some extent to es¬ 
tablish horizontal control, although most of the cut lines have 
been obliterated by forest fire and regrowth of timber* Further 
horizontal control was obtained by the use of aerial photographs 
and reference to timber maps of the Burmis Lumber Company. 

Topographic control was obtained from the Department of 
Interior maps of the Crowsnest Forest and Waterton Lake Park, sheet 
3 and It. 

The amount of stratigraphic information obtained by the 
survey was disappointing* This was due in part to the wide extent 
of the glacial mantle, the density of forest cover, and also to the 
tremendous amount of earth movement to which the strata had been 
subjected* During these movements the rock formations were faulted 
and folded so many’' times that sections of more than a few hundred 
feet are rare. On the other hand the area offers a wealth of 
material for structural studies. 

Stratigraphic sections vrere measured by steel tape, 
step method and plane table. With the exception of the Crowsnest, 
Kootenay, Blackstone and Carhium it was not possible, due to the 
faulting and scarcity of outcrop, to obtain any complete section 
of a particular formation.

CHAPTER II 


GENERAL CHARACTER OF THE REGION 


Topography 

The Flathead range, the southern portion of the front 
Rocky Mountain ranges lies on the west of the area. It has a 
north-south trend which is also the regional trend of the Rocky 
Mountain ranges. Peaks of the Flathead range are the highest of 
the areas and one of them, Mt. Darrah, is 9038 feet high (Figure 1). 

Clarke range to the southwest of the area has a regional 
and local southeast trend. Syncline Mountain in this range has 
an elevation of 8008 feet. 

The ridges formed by the upheaval and subsequent erosion 
of the Mesozoic rocks strike In a northwesterly direction within 
the area. Those ridges north of the Carbondale river have a trend 
20 degrees west of north; whereas south of the Carbondale river the 
general strike changes to about 55 degrees west of north. Erosion- 
al processes have caused the ridges to become very irregular in 
shape. Some portions are eroded to near valley level while in 
other places they rise to become prominent hills. The highest of 
these hills are Prospect hill, elevation 6 I 4 OO feet; Cherry hill, 
elevation 6300 feet; Carbondale hill, elevation 5921 feet and 
Backus mountain, elevation 592ii feet. These elevations are approx¬ 
imately 900 to 1000 feet above the general level of the terrain.

Broad valleys lie between the ridges or are normal to 
them. These valleys have been formed by stream and ice action. 

That main stream valleys have been heavily glaciated, is exhibited 
by their U-shape and the large amount of glacial debris found in 
them. Moreover, more than one stage in the ice advance is shown 
along the valleys, especially those of lynx creek and Garbondale 
river. Three main terraces were observed in each of these valleys. 
These terraces suggest damming of the ice causing the accumulation 
of sediments. The three main levels are evidence for three dif¬ 
ferent lake levels and thus three different periods of damming. 

The valleys lying between the ridges and having the same trend as 
the ridges are largely the result of differential erosion of the 
inclined strata by subsequent streams. 

Drainage 

The drainage of the Carbondale area is tributary to 
the Oldman river. The two main streams are the Castle and the 
Carbondale, the latter being tributary to the Castle and flowing 
into it in the northeast corner of the mapped area. Early geo¬ 
graphical accounts called the Carbondale river the South fork and 
the Castle river the Little fork. The whole area was referred 
to as the South Fork country. 

The Carbondale river has its source in two small tandem 
lakes about a half mile from the summit of North Kootenay Pass. It 
















- 























; . 


















- 11 - 


flows in an easterly direction to its confluence with the Castle. 
Four large creeks, Gardiner, Lost, Lynx and 0*.Hagen are tributary 
to it. These creeks, with the exception of O’Hagen, have their 
sources in cirques of the Flathead and Clarke ranges. Lost creek 
has at its headwaters four large cirques, and lynx creek three at 
the source of its west branch. 0 ! Hagen creek rises from small 
tributary streams which drain the rolling tract between Gardiner 
creek and the Castle river. Castle river rises in the Clarke 
range some distance south of the map-area. The west and south 
branches of Castle river join at the site of the Castlemount ranger 
station. The main river flows from this point through the map-area 
in a northwesterly direction. These streams and their tributaries 
provide the drainage for the southeasterly portion of the territory. 

All of the streams mentioned in the above description 
are antecedent for the major part of their courses. Occasionally 
they become subsequent if they pass from resistant to weak strata. 
This is illustrated on George and Lynx creeks where the creeks are 
incised in the soft arenaceous shales of the Blackstone formation, 
which lies adjacent to the more consolidated Crowsnest volcanics. 
Moreover, many of the smaller tributary streams follow the trend 
of the ridges to their confluence with the creeks. George creek, 
a tributary of lynx creek, follows the Blackstone-Crowsnest contact 
for the larger part of its course. 

No difficulty is encountered in crossing these streams

during the summer months, it being unnecessary at any time to wade 
over knee depth. It is possible in many cases to cross them on 
fallen timber* 

Culture 

The map-area does not support any community centres. 

The lumber operators have established semi-permanent camps which 
are moved from time to time, their site being dependent upon the 
operational area. The largest of these camps is that of the Burmis 
Lumber Company, and is located In section 28, township 5, range I 4 ., 
west of the fifth meridian. This camp has several temporary family 
dwellings, a school and a commissary. There is a ranger station 
at the forks of the Castle river and another at the junction of 
Lynx creek and Carbondale river. A fire lookout is situated on 
Garbondale hill. There are several small ranches in the north¬ 
eastern and the eastern portion of the map-area. 

Two cabins, one on the north branch of Lost creek and 
the other just east of the junction of the west and north branches 
of Lynx creek, are used by trappers and hunters. 

A strip coal mine owned by West Canadian Collieries is 
in operation on the ridge lying between George and Webb creeks, 
(Figure 2).

a game preserve and the northern portion is fairly inaccessible 
to hunters, wild life is not abundant. Black and grizzly bears are 
present but not in great numbers. Only a few moose, elk, deer 
and mountain goats were observed, and it is concluded that the 
animals do not inhabit the area in large numbers. Of the smaller 
animals Columbian ground squirrels and coyotes are the most abundant, 
while red squirrels, chipmunks, conies, beavers, porcupines and 
weasels occur in lesser numbers. The streams offer very good 
trout fishing. Grouse are plentiful throughout the southern part 
of the area. 

Forest growth is in parts quite dense. The entire map- 
area with the exception of the hills adjacent to the lower part of 
the Carbondale and Castle rivers and the river valleys of this same 
section which is grassland, are or have been heavily wooded. That 
sector lying between Castle and Carbondale rivers and west of 
Carbondale hill was swept by a forest fire in 1936, and consequent¬ 
ly is covered with dead timber. A tree regrowth of a height of six 
to eight feet is beginning to appear. The fallen timber and re¬ 
growth make traverse very difficult. That part north of the Carbon¬ 
dale river and west of George creek excepting for a few of the 
ridges is very heavily wooded. The principle trees are spruce, 
balsam and pine. Poplar occurs but is usually of a scrubby nature. 
Douglas fir is present in scattered clumps. The undergrowth is 
very thick, especially on the north and east slopes of hills and

ridges. Red cedar was found growing in clumps on the ridges between 
Lost creek and West lynx creek. A varied alpine flora was observed^ 
the flowering plants being very abundant both above and below tree 
line. Tree line is 6500 to 7000 feet above sea level. 

Small muskegs occur infrequently in the map-area. They 
are confined to those sections of the river valley which are broad 
and flat. The upper valleys of lynx and Lost creeks have many 
small muskegs.

CHAPTER III 


STRATIGRAPHY 


General Statement 

The rocks of the Carbondale map-area range in age from 
Proterozoic to Recent. 

The Proterozoic rocks include partially metamorphosed 
sediments and volcanics of late PreCambrian age. Lying conformably 
on the Precambrian formations is a quartzitic formation which is 
placed in the Cambrian (Hage, 19l|0). The quartzitic rock is over- 
lain by shales, dolomite and limestone of the Devonian system, and 
these are succeeded by Carboniferous limestones and shales. 

The oldest Mesozoic strata are those that belong to the 
Jurassic system. The Lower Cretaceous, conformable with the Jurassic, 
is represented by the Kootenay, Blairmore and Crowsnest formations. 

'This last formation is volcanic in origin, and is one of the few 
occurrences of rocks of this type in Alberta. The Upper Cretaceous 
formations are a series of marine shales and sandstones which have 
been divided into the Blackstone, Bighorn and Wapiabi formations, 
and a succession of fresh water and brackish water strata called 
Allison formation. The thicknesses of Tertiary rocks In ad¬ 
jacent territories to the east would indicate that strata of this 
age were at one time present in the map-area, but have been removed 
by erosional processes. Pleistocene and Recent deposits of gravel, 
sand, clay, a fairly well consolidated conglomerate and a thin soil

mantle are very prominent. 

No difficulty was encountered in the determination of 
boundaries of formations because the lithological breaks are quite 
pronounced. However, the faulting and folding within formations 
and the thrusting of older formations over younger strata have made 
difficult the measurement of formational thicknesses. 

PRECAMBRIAN FORMATIONS 

The survey did not concern itself with details of the 
PreCambrian, and Paleozoic formations. Casual observation of the 
Precambrian rocks led to the conclusion that the oldest rocks pre¬ 
sent are those of t the Siyeh formation, which is represented in the 
area by thin bedded argillaceous limestone, cryptozoan limestone, 
and a sill of basic igneous rock identified by Hage (Hage, I 9 I 4 O) as 
a diorite. Overlying the limestones is a massive bed of amygd&loidal 
basalt, which has in it a basic layer of rock containing numerous 
laths of feldspars. The feldspar crystals show very distinct zoning. 
The remainder of the strata lying between the above mentioned 
igneous bed and the Cambrian is largely red argillite with a sill 
of basic rock near the Precambrian-Cambrian contact and are consid¬ 
ered to belong to the SHEPPARD and KINTLA formations. 

The total estimated thickness of the formations in the 
vicinity of North Kootenay Pass is 2000 feet. The peaks of the 
Clarke range are, within the map-area, composed of Precambrian

strata. Too, the Precambrian formations underlie the Paleozoics 
of the Flathead range. 


PALEOZOIC FORMATIONS 

The Paleozoic rocks of the area lie in the Flathead range 
and Turtle Mountain anticline. Overlying Precambrian rocks and 
apparently conformable with them is a SO-foot bed of pinkish quart¬ 
zite which Hage (Hage, 19L0) assigns to the Cambrian. A discon- 
formity occurs between the Cambrian and Devonian and rocks of 
Silurian and Ordovician age are not present. Devonian shale, dolo¬ 
mite and limestone of the Fairholme and Palliser formations overlie 
the Cambrian. P. S. Warren has identified fossil corals, trilobite 
fragments, conodonts and brachiopods collected from the Devonian 
strata and has placed them in the Upper Devonian (Warren, 19l*9)* 

The Exshaw shale, lying at the top of the Devonian, is twenty feet 
thick. Rocks of Carboniferous age occur above the Exshaw shale. 

The Banff shales were recognized and it is thought that some of the 
precipitous peaks are formed from Randle limestone. 

Rocks of Carboniferous age form Turtle Mountain anti¬ 
cline and lie disconformably below the Jurassic rocks (Figure 3).

Name, Distribution, Age and Correlation 

In 1902 W. W. Leach (Leach, 1902) referred to the dark 
shales underlying the Kootenay coal measures as Fernie shales and 
in 1911 he formally applied this name to the same shales to which 
he assigned a Jurassic age. 

In the Garbondale River map-area the Fernie formation 
occurs along the limbs of the northeastward striking Turtle Mountain 
anticline. It plunges out with this anticline in the valley of 
the Carbondale river. Two slices of the formation occur. One was 
observed at the headwaters of Lynx creek and the other on the Upper 
Carbondale. 

Fossils collected from the Fernie strata are Bntollum 
leachi McLearn, Pleuronwa summissiomata McLeam, Gryphaea

- Protocardia schucherti McLearn, Thracia canadensis McLeam, Pleur- 
onrya obtusiprorata McLearn, Thesis sp., Lima albertensis McLeam, 
Gadoceras sp., and ELccocephalites concinnus (Buckman). This 
fauna is assigned to the Gallovian (Upper Jurassic) age by Buckman 
(Buchman, 1929)• 

The zones in the Fernie formation of the Carbondale area 
do not wholly correspond to those more northerly sections seen in 
the Highwood-Elbow (Allan and Carr, 1947)* Ribbon Creek (Crockford, 
1949) and Mountain Park areas, in that the lower fauna of the 
Rock Creek member is absent.

Lithology and Thickness 

The Feraie formation lies disconformably on the paleozoic 
formations of the Turtle Mountain anticline. 

The Fernie succession is largely one of a series of 
marine shales. The basal shale overlying the phosphatic sandstone 
is slightly sandy and has a very platy habit. Freshly exposed sur¬ 
faces reveal plates of l/8 inch to 1/b inch In thickness. The dark 
shale overlying this is very fissile, and at this locality gave 
indications of flowage due to pressures exerted upon it presumably 
during the orogenic movements of the Pocky Mountain uplift. The 
thick brown shales, which overlie, succeeding the black, are a phase 
of the Fernie not previously observed (Warren, ±9b9)» These shales 
weather to a characteristic crumbly surface. In fresh exposures 
the shale has a somewhat blocky habit. Nodules which occur through¬ 
out the bed were found to be hollow in the centre, and as they are 
of a very porous nature it is presumed that the interior has been 
removed by leaching. Near the top of the brown shale zone a 
fossiliferous horizon of arenaceous limestone occurs. This is 
followed by more brown shales and then green sands. The green 
sands were observed also along Carbondale river, and in the slice 
at the headwaters of lynx creek. Microscopic examination of the 
sand shows it to be composed largely of glauconite. The upper 
portion of the formation is a series of shale and interbedded sand¬ 
stone layers commonly referred to as "the ribbon sands". The sand-

stone bands are two to four inches in thickness and occur at in¬ 
tervals of approximately 1 to b feet. The shale is black, fissile 
and silty. Near the top of the shale and sandstone sequence, the 
sandstone beds become progressively thicker and the shale bands 
thinner until the shale disappears. This gradual change in sequence 
indicates continuous deposition. 

Deposition of the Femie strata terminated in a massive 
sandstone member. Lithologically this sandstone varies, in that it 
is fine- to medium-grained near the base, and has a rhythmical 
banding, whereas the upper part is fairly coarse-grained and with¬ 
out any banding. Moreover, the lower beds are more calcareous. 

The contact between the Fernie and Kootenay formations is chosen 
as being within this sandstone member at a point where the dif¬ 
ference in lithology occurs. No unconformity is visible. Similar 
conditions were observed in the Ribbon Creek area, and a more de¬ 
tailed study resulted in this same conclusion (Crockford, 19k 9). 

As a result of detailed investigations of the Fernie-Kootenay con¬ 
tact in the Fernie area, C. Newmarch (Newmarch, 19^9) has concluded 
that the contact is gradational, and that if any time break occurs 
at the contact, it must be slight. 

The measured thickness of the section given is 1035.1 
feet. This is thicker than the section at Fernie which was given 
by Warren (Warren, 193b) as 8(X) feet. The difference in thickness 
may be due to minor faulting and folding in the shale members.

CRETACEOUS 
Lower Cretaceous 

Kootenay Formation 

Name, Distribution, Age and Correlation 

The Kootenay formation was named by C-. M. Dawson (1886) 
and on the basis of fossil plants was given a Lower Cretaceous age/ 

W. W. Leach (1912) and B. Rose defined the lower and upper boundaries 
of the formation. 

In the Carbondale map-area seven bands of Kootenay are 
faulted to the surface. The most westerly band lies under the 
main overthrust fault of the PreCambrian and Paleozoic rocks. A 
slice of the formation occurs a mile and a half east of the main 
thrust in the Carbondale area and a third follows along Yifilloughby 
Ridge (Figure R). Two bands occur on the west limb of Turtle 
Mountain anticline and one on the east limb. These three join to 
form one band south of the Carbondale river. The seventh band is 
observed in the northeast corner of the area. 

Within Carbondale area fossil evidence was not collected 
from the Kootenay formation. However, due to the stratigrapnic 
position and lithological character of the rocks observed, it is 
correlated with the rocks of the Kootenay formation of the areas

north of Carbondale River area and also with the Likinassin of 
the more northerly areas. The formation is, on the basis of fossil 
evidence, assigned to the European Neocomian-Barremian (Bell, 1 9hh, 
191 * 6 ). 

Lithology and Thickness 

The basal bed of the Kootenay formation is a massive 
sandstone. The contact between the Kootenay and Fernie is chosen 
where the sedimentation in this massive sandstone changes from 
fine to massive bedding. At the top of the massive bedded sand¬ 
stone an unconformity exists and a coal seam lies on sandstone 
without any gradational beds (Figure 5). From here to the top of 
the formation the succession is largely one of shale and coal with 
occasional sandstone bands. The thickest coal seam is the lU-foot 
seam being mined at the Adanac strip. 

The formation has a measured thickness of 280 feet. 

Blairmore Formation 

Name and Distribution 

The Blairmore formation was named by Leach in 1911 
(Leach, 1912). He had previously recognized it as a lithological 
unit in 1902 (Leach, 1902). 

Blairmore rocks and rocks of equivalent age outcrop 
throughout the full extent of the Rocky Mountains and foothills of 
Alberta. The formation is composed of hard sandstones and softer

shales* Resistance of the sandstones often produces ridges. 

Blairmore strata have a wide distribution in the Carbon- 
dale area, since they have been faulted to the surface in a number 
of places. They are bedrock in the major portion of the north¬ 
eastern part of the map-area. 

Thickness and Lithology 

The Blairmore rocks are a succession of greenish shales 
and sandstones. The proportion of shale to sandstone is greater 
in the middle of the formation. The shales are largely green in 
color, blocky in habit and unfossiliferous. Occasional beds of 
maroon shale occur. One 12-foot bed of fresh water limestone was 
observed. 

Two large conglomerates occur in the Blairmore formation. 
The basal conglomerate is 20 to 30 feet thick. Pebbles of chert 
and quartzite are very firmly cemented in a fine-grained matrix. 
Lenses of igneous pebble conglomerate occur about seven hundred 
feet above the base of the formation. These lenses are as thick 
as seventy feet and are believed to be bars of shore line deposi¬ 
tion. Massive, well indurated bands of sandstone occur near the 
base and at the top of the Blairmore formation. 

The formation is 1680 feet thick in the area. Thickness¬ 
es of 2300 feet and 2150 feet have been given by MacKay, (1932), in 


the Blairmore area, 




- 27 - 


Age and Correlation 

Bell (Bell, 19L6) placed the age of the Blairmore strata 
in the Lower Cretaceous on the basis of fossil plant evidence. 
Within the map-area typical Lower Cretaceous fauna was collected. 
These specimens include, Auceila sp., Unio hamili, Unio douglassi 
and Sphaerium onestae . 

Crowsnest Formation 

Name, Distribution and Thickness 

G, M, Dawson first recorded the Crowsnest formation in 
l88l. Descriptions of the volcanics of this formation have been 
given by W. W, Leach, (1902), C. W, Knight, (190$) and J, D, Mac¬ 
kenzie (191h). 

The Crowsnest formation is confined to the Crowsnest 
Pass area. The southeastward extension of these rocks enters the 
Carbondale area and has been faulted to the surface in a number of 
places. 

In the Crowsnest Pass the formation has a thickness of 
1100 feet. The thickness in the Carbondale area is $00 feet. 

Lithology and Age 

J, D. Mackenzie (1911;) describes the Crowsnest volcanics 
as consisting of stratified pyroclastic rocks which exhibit several 
primary types occurring as fragments. These are, in order of 
abundance, trachytes, blaimorites and latites. These rocks are

often interbedded with tuffaceous maroon, and in some instances, 
green shales. The volcanics are quite frequently reworked, by 
water, resulting in beds composed mostly of Yirater rounded phenocrysts<> 
Because of the gradational contact at the base of the volcanics 
and the unconformity at the top of the Crowsnest formation, it is 
placed in the upper Lower Cretaceous. 

Upper Cretaceous 

General Statement 

Previous reports of the Crowsnest Pass region have used 
the name Benton to designate the sediments of Colorado age. In this 
report the divisions of Blackstone, Bighorn and Wapiabi are used 
in place of Benton. Rocks of Colorado age outcrop In the Alberta 
foothills from the li9th parallel to the British Golumbia-Alberta 
boundaiy in the Peace River territory. Moreover, drilling has re¬ 
vealed that Colorado sediments underlie the Alberta plains. 

G. S. Malloch (Malloch, 1911) divided the Colorado shales 
in the Bighorn basin Into the Blackstone, Bighorn and Wapiabi and 
gave them local names which have been carried into other areas. 

Blackstone formation 

Lithology, Thickness and Age 

The Blackstone strata are a series of finely bedded, 
silty, fissile marine shales. They are In some place nodular and 
may have a thin layer of siltstone. The basal bed of this formation

in the Carbondale area is a chert pebble conglomerate which is 
overlain by a sandstone band. The conglomerate and sandstone to¬ 
gether are 5*5 feet in thickness (Figure 6). 

The formation is, in the Carbondale map-area, 325 feet 
thick. This is 75 feet less than the thickness given by C. 0. 

Hage (19k0) in the Beaver Mines area and only a third of the thick¬ 
ness given by Allan and Carr in the Highwood-Elbow area. 

Fossils found in the formation are Exogyra laeviuscula^ 
Inoceramus sp., latinoceras sp. and Dunveganoceras sp. The presence 
of this fauna indicates Upper Cenomanian and Lower Turonian age for 
the formation. 

Bighorn Formation 

Marne, Distribution and Thickness 

G. S. Malloch, (1911), first applied this name to a 390 
foot series of siliceous shaJ.es, shaly sandstones and conglomerate 
bands occurring in the Bighorn Coal Basin. The formation has the 
same distribution within the foothills as the Blackstone and 
lapiabi shales. Areally the formation is faulted to the surface 
in many places. However, the formation is only 10U feet thick so 
it is not bedrock in a large percentage of the map-area. 

Lithology and Age 

The bottom of the formation is a light grey quartzitic 
sandstone with a thickness of 30 feet (Figure 7). This is overlain 
















- 30 - 


by shales which much resemble those of the underlying Blackstone 
but are probably more sandy. The top of the upper band of sandstone 
is taken as the top of the Bighorn formation. Its thickness is 
from 12 feet to 20 feet. It consists of dark grey, very fine-grained 
quartzitic sandstone. Pyrite is scattered throughout the band. 

Fossils found in the Bighorn formation are Exogyra 
laeviuscula Roemer, Prionocyclus Wyomingens is Meek. These fossils 
are not diagnostic so the formation is placed as Bighorn because of 
its lithological character and stratigraphic position. 

Wapiabi Formation 

Name, Distribution and Thickness 

Malloch, (1911), gave this name to the shale succession 
overlying the Bighorn in, the Bighorn Goal Basin. It retains much 
of the same character from the type locality, south eastwards through 
the foothills to the Carbondale River area. 

Within the area it outcrops in several broad bands but 
in no place is it exposed from the bottom to the top of the forma¬ 
tion so true thickness could not be measured. However, the calculated 
thickness of the formation is liiOO feet which compares with Rage's 
figure of 1600 feet in the Beaver Mines area. 

Lithology and Age 

The Wapiabi formation is a series of dark grey marine 
shales with thin sandstone bands. Near the top of the formation

the sandstone layers become more frequent until it grades into the 
Allison sandstone. 

Marine fossils found in the formation include Inoceramus 
exogyroides , Scaphites ventricosus , Baculites codyensis , ustrea (?) 
sp., and Q^ytoma sp. The Scaphites vercnifomis and Baculites occur 
in recognized zones throughout the foothills and so the formation 
may be correlated with the Wapiabi formation. 

Allison Formation 
Distribution 

The Allison strata occurs in one continuous band from 
the northwest portion of the map sheet, along the mountain fronts 
to the southeast comer. Elsewhere within Alberta, strata of 
Allison age occur both as surface rock and at depth. The most 
extensive outcrops are those of the southeastern portion of the 
province. 

Thickness and Lithology 

Tftc Calculated thickness of the Allison is U300 feet. Of 
this thickness the only continuous outcrop in the area measured 
878.3 feet. 

The strata exposed consist of grey to grey-green sand¬ 
stone and green shale. The sandstone beds may be friable or well 
indurated and are commonly cross-bedded. The shales are green in 
color, sandy and usually of a black nature.

Age and Correlation 

Fossils obtained from Allison strata are Unio minimus 
Warren, Unio cf. primaevus , Unio sp., Viviparus leai Meek and Hayden, 
Corbicula occidentails Meek and Hayden, Qorbicula cytheriformis , 
Anodonta sp., Ostrea glabra Meek and Hayden, Corbicula srbtrigonalis 
Meek and Hayden, and Melania Wyomingensis Meek. The first four 
specimens named are of fresh water origin whereas the latter group 
is brackish water. These fossils are also found in the Foremost 
and Oldman formations of the southern plains of Alberta. 

Bearpaw Formation 

One outcrop of Bearpaw strata was observed. This occurs 
on the second creek east of the west branch of Castle river and 
south of Beaver lake. The exposures consisted of dark grey shales, 
carbonaceous layers and probably a biostrome. This strata appears 
to be the Bearpaw equivalent but faunal evidence does not definitely 
identify it. Corbicula cytheriformis is possibly of Bearpaw age. 

pleistocene and Recent 

Cirques along the fronts of the Flathead and Clarke 
ranges, abundance of glacial till and erratics and topographic 
features indicate extensive glaciation in the area. The valleys 
of Carbondale river, Castle river. Lynx creek and Lost creek have 
been glaciated. Erratics are found on hills 800 feet above valley 
level. Most of these hills have rounded contours and resemble

rocihe moutonnee* Higher hills of the area and some of the mountain 
spurs were nunataks during the Pleistocene glacial epoch. South 
of North Kootenay Pass the ice has crossed a col at an elevation of 
7100 feet. Warren, (1 9b9)> believes that the ice which crossed here 
was an overflow from the ice sheet which covered Brutish Columbia. 

Many terraces of the area are thought to be of glacial 
origin (Figure 8). During the glacial epoch the valley of Castle 
river was probably dammed below its junction with the Carbondale. 
This damming produced a glacial^in which were deposited sediments 
to a great depth. When the ice dam melted, the lake was drained 
and the bottoms remained as a flat. The varying levels of terraces 
are attributed to the downward and sideways cutting of the Castle 
and Carbondale rivers. 

Gravels in the river beds are probably largely of glacial 
and recent origin. At several points on the Castle river and at 
one point on Lost creek a well consolidated recent conglomerate was 
noted (Figure 9)* This conglomerate includes pebbles of Mesozoic 
and Precambrian origin. It has been cemented by circulation of 
limy waters. 

Competency of Formations in the Carbondale Liver Area 

Definition 

Competency is a relative property. A competent formation 
is strong and can transmit the compressive force much farther

than a weak incompetent formation (Billings, p. 88). 
precambrian and Paleozoics 

The Precambrian strata of the Clarke and Flathead ranges, 
although composed of argillite, and fairly thin bedded limestone, 
seems to be quite competent as a unit. They have withstood and 
transmitted the tremendous mountain building forces without abnormal 
deformation. The preponderance of massive limestone and dolomite 
in the Paleozoics gives these formations great competency. 

Mesozoics 

Jurassic 

The Femie formation is composed of fissile marine 
shales which, when subjected to compressive stresses, will readily 
fault, fold or act as a slippage zone. They are, therefore, con¬ 
sidered to be very incompetent. 

Lower Cretaceous 

The Kootenay strata includes shale horizons and coal 
seams. These serve as lubricants for faulting, so often the 
Kootenay occurs along a fault line. The heavy basal band of the 
Kootenay formation is, due to its massiveness and well indurated 
character quite competent. 

The basal Blairmore conglomerate is a very competent 
band. This thick band is well cemented and a massive unit and

therefore has transmitted the faulting forces in many places. Also 
in the Blairmore formation a massive sandstone at the base and a 
series of massive sandstone near the top of the formation are able 
to withstand the compressive forces without great distortion. 

Shales of the Blairmore formation are sandy and are of the blocky 
rather than fissile character. The formation, as a unit, is one 
of the most competent Mesozoic formations of the map-area. 

The Crowsnest formation composed of massive rocks of 
volcanic origin with interbedded tuffaceous shales forms a competent 
unit, which due to its position adjacent to the Blairmore, has 
acted with it, in transmitting the compressive forces. 

Upper Cretaceous 

Two formations of the Upper Cretaceous, the Allison and 
the Bighorn, are competent. The Bighorn has two massive sandstone 
bands, which, for so thin a formation, have withstood the mountain 
building stresses most remarkably. The fissile shales lying above 
and below the Bighorn have probably absorbed much of the stresses 
which otherwise would have faulted and folded the formation. The 
Bighorn sandstones then have frequently faulted to the surface and 
due to their resistance to weathering, as compared to the surround¬ 
ing shales, are often expressed topographically as waterfalls and 
ridges. The sandstones and shales of the Allison formation are 
very similar to the Blairmore formation and rank with it in com¬ 


petency

Shales of the Wapiabi and Blackstone formation are very 
fissile and yield easily to compressive forces. They are a good 
slippage zone and have acted as such during Rocky Mountain tectonic 
movements. _ 



CHAPTER IV 


REGIONAL R Q C K Y M u U IT T A I H S T R U C I U R E 

General Statement 

Sub-parallel fault blocks composed of Paleozoic and Pre- 
cambrian rocks make up the Rocky Mountain ranges. The faults under¬ 
lying these blocks are usually westward or southwestward dipping 
but eastward dipping faults do occur. 

Forces from the west and southwest acting in an east and 
northeast direction* have caused these great thrust blocks to 
override the plains 0 

Displacement of the faults is variable. The throw may 
be as much as U0,000 feet as in the case of the Lewis and Clarke 
range. Net slip far exceeds this figure and cannot be accurately 
determined but in northern Montana it has been estimated as being 
at least twelve miles. 

The foothills are usually formed from rocks of Mesozoic 
age. They are folded and faulted in accordance with the forces 
exerted upon them during the upheaval of the mountains* so they 
mirror the trends of the adjacent mountain fronts. The faults 
in the foothills are usually westward dipping. Both thrust and 
normal faulting occur. 

Transverse faulting is not the rule in either the foot- 
hils or the mountain ranges* however, transverse faults are not

uncommon* 

Warren (1938) has dated the main uplift of the Rocky 
at the beginning of Oligocene time. The uplift was followed by an 
erosional epoch during which time peneplanation took place. During 
Pliocene time the continent rose and another erosional cycle began. 
From this last erosional period has resulted our present mountains. 

Below is given a more detailed description of the Rocky 
Mountain structure north and south of the Garbondale River map-area. 


Rocky Mountain Structure of Montana 

Structural interpretations of the front ranges of the 
Rocky Mountains of northern Montana were made by G. R. Glapp (Clapp* 
1932). He interprets the major structure along the Montana- 
Canadian border as a broad synclinorium with faults and folds oc¬ 
curring on both the eastern and western limbs. The eastern limb 
is narrower* steeper and more intensely folded than the Yfestern 
limb. The western limb is broken by four or five longitudinal 
faults. (Figure 11* Gross section 1). 

Faults in the western limb bow out to the southwest 
and dip to the northeast at angles of 60 to 80 degrees* easterly 
faults bow out to the northeast and dip southwest at angles of 
55 to 75 degrees. Therefore* two sets of faults bound on the east 
and west great downward tapering wedges. The throw of the faults

is 10,000 to 30,(JU0 feet. The western faults have been named from 
the mountain ranges which they uplift. Of the eastern faults only 
the Le?d.s and Clarke fault, which follows the Lewis and Clarke 
range has been named. This fault with a throw of L0,U0U feet 
brings southwestward dipping Beltian rocks over southwestward dip¬ 
ping Palaeozoic rocks. East of the Lems thrust smaller thrust 
faults occur in the Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata. 

The Lewis and Clarke thrust fault in the Montana area 
has 28 degrees west strike and an average dip of 30 degrees. It has 
a maximum vertical displacement of [ 1 0,000 feet and a maximum net 
slip of 12 miles. In some places the fault consists of a series of 
parallel faults $ in others it is one simple fracture with little 
disturbance of the rocks on either side. At the international 
boundary the fault has a dip of about 7 degrees and the fault sur¬ 
face either has been warped or was uneven when formed. Chief and 
Divide mountains are T, klippes ,! composed of Belt series rocks lying 
on Mesozoic strata. 

South of Glacier Park the Lewis and Clarke fault steepens 
to 30 degrees. Two hundred and ten miles south of the international 
boundary the fault has a northeast trend with a dip of L0 degrees 
to the northwest and is known as the Lombard fault. 

Glapp attributes the deformation, along the main thrust 
lines, to forces which acted from the southwest in a northeasterly 


direction

Structure of the Flathead valley 

The Flathead valley is one of the longitudinal troughs or 
trenches of the Rocky Mountain system. Because of oil seepages in 
the Precambrian rocks of this valley and the adjacent Clarke range 
its structural features have been studied in some detail. No de¬ 
finite interpretation of the Structure has been given but three 
explanations have been postulated. Each of these is inconclusive, 
in that, much of the evidence is concealed by Tertiary and Recent 
deposits. 

Daly (1912), Willis (1902) and MacKenzie (1922) explain 
the Flathead structure by the fault graben theory. This would 
necessitate, according to these authors, a normal tension fault 
along the west side of the Clarke range. Drilling has revealed 
that this fault, commonly termed the Flathead fault, does not dip 
westward but is an eastward dipping fault. It is noted that the 
authors here in describing a graben use the keystone theory. Holmes 
in his text on physical geology points out that fault graben could 
be due to compressional forces which cause a downward widening wedge 
to be forced down. The fault graben theory for the Flathead might 
better be explained in this manner. 

Daly (1912) thought it possible that the whole Flathead 
valley is a window. This would require a very low angle and 
possibly warped Lewis thrust fault. This explanation does not meet 
with mechanical difficulties. Precambrian strata on the west side

of the valley lie upon rocks of Devono-Carboniferous age. On the 
east side the Precambrian rocks overlie the Mesozoics. It is possible 
then that at one time a great mass of Precambrian rocks overrode the 
younger Paleozoic and Mesozoic formations. This idea is quite 
acceptable and may be correct but this cannot be definitely proven 
because the Flathead fault is not exposed. 

Private investigations of the Flathead valley adjacent 
to and south of North Kootenay Pass have led to evidence which shows 
that the movement of the Precambrian rocks with respect to the under¬ 
lying formations has been eastward. This would seem to indicate 
that the window theory is the logical explanation. 

T. A. Link (1932), has suggested a "ramp" or Inverted 
wedge theory. A ramp is interpreted as being a keystone wedge such 
as would result from a pair of over and underthrust faults. In the 
case of the Flathead valley, the west is the overthrust side and 
the east the underthrust side. Link ! s suggested interpretation is 
shown in Figure 11, Gross section 2. It is noted that the under¬ 
thrust fault dies out at depth and does not preclude the possibility 
of a low angle Lewis overthrust fault. 

Pierre de Bethune (1936) has studied the structure of 
the Flathead basin in the vicinity of Flathead townsite and North 
Kootenay Pass, His cross section, which is taken just north of 
North Kootenay Pass is shown in Figure 11, Cross section 3. Bethune 
terminates the Flathead fault in the area of the townsite. He

suggests that it merges -with one of the faults continuing northward. 
The difficulty arises here in that the northern faults have a west¬ 
ward dip while there is fairly conclusive evidence that the Flathead 
fault dips eastward. One of the northern faults cuts directly 
through the Paleozoics of the Flathead range and merges with the 
main overthrust fault a few miles north of North Kootenay Pass. 
Bethune favors the window theory for an explanation of the Flathead 
trough. 

Structure of Crowsnest Pass area 

The regional structure of the Crowsnest Pass area is com¬ 
paratively simple (Figure 11, Cross section h). MacKay (1932) has 
shown that the Paleozoics of the Crovrsnest range dip under the 
Mesozoic sediments of Fernie basin. On the east side of Crowsnest 
range the Paleozic rocks have faulted over the Mesozoics at a low 
angle. Warren (Warren, 1933) estimates that because of the position 
and altitude of the fault plain underlying Crowsnest Lake mountain, 
a klippe, that the angle of thrust cannot exceed 1 $ degrees. East 
of Crowsnest range two other Paleozoic blocks have been faulted up, 
namely, the Blairmore Range and Livingstone Range the latter being 
actually two ranges brought up en echelon. The Livingstone Range 
is bounded by a thrust fault which carries on into the Mesozoic 
sediments to the south of the range. Several faults and folds occur 
in the Mesozoic strata, the most important feature of these being 
the faults that have brought Kootenay coal seams to or near the

surface. West of the Crowsnest range the Mesozoics are folded into 
a broad basin which is bounded on the west by the complex anticlinal 
structure of Erickson ridge. 

GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE WITHIN CAHBONDALE RIVER AREA 

Introductory Statement 

To the west and southwest of the Carbondale River map-area 
the Paleozoics and PreCambrian are thrust over Mesozoic strata. 

The latter have been faulted and folded due to the forces exerted 
upon them during the overthrusting of the Paleozoic-Precambrian fault 
block. The folded and faulted blocks, since their upheaval, have 
been eroded and glaciated. The resultant ridges and valleys have, 
in the northern portion of the area, a north twenty degrees west 
trend| those in the southern parts have a north 55 degrees west 
trend. Most of the faults are of the longitudinal type but trans¬ 
verse faults occur along the upper Carbondale river and in the 
locality of Byron hill. Minor faulting is very abundant throughout 
the area and in the less competent shale horizons and coal seams 
much of the movement has been accomplished by slippage. 

Structure of the Upper Carbondale River area 

This portion of the map-area has been observed by many 
expeditions from Palliser ! s time to the present. Hume on his journey 
through North Kootenay Pass noted and made reference to the anti¬ 
clinal nature of the Lewis thrust at this point (Hume, 1932). Other 













.

observers did not make any particular reference to the structure 
of the rocks. 

Kootenay strata underlie the overthrust in this locality. 
The Kootenay is faulted over the Blairmore and the Blairmore is 
faulted over the Wapiabi. The Kootenay and Blairmore strata are 
intensely faulted and minor folds occur in them. The average dip 
of the bands is U5 degrees but dips as low as 7 degrees and as great 
as 68 degrees were recorded. The Kootenay is a slice brought up 
over the Blairmore band on a low angle thrust fault which at depth 
is believed to join with the main overthrust. The fault underlying 
the Blairmore is an imbricate and longitudinal fault. The greater 
part of the slippage has been in the plane or nearly in the plane 
of the dip of the strata. 

Lying east of this imbricate fault is a faulted and eroded 
anticline. In cross section C-D this anticline begins with the 
most westerly band of Wapiabi formation. Eastward the Wapiabi band 
is succeeded by Bighorn (at depth). Blackstone, Growsnest Volcanics, 
Blairmore, Growsnest Volcanics, Blackstone, Bighorn and Wapiabi 
which is faulted over the younger Allison strata. Faulting occurs 
on both limbs of the anticline and in the centre. On the west limb 
the Wapiabi formation is faulted, the apparent displacement being 
greater to the north where the Wapiabi contacts the Growsnest forma¬ 
tion rather than the Bighorn. On the eastern limb the Crowsnest 
formation is faulted over the Wapiabi shales. The fault in the

central part of the anticline may have quite a large displacement. 

A well indurated Blairmore sandstone which overlies forty feet of 
the basal Blairmore conglomerate is present on the first ridge west 
of Prospect hill. It is lying above the conglomerate, as is the 
normal sequence, but the usual shale parting between the sandstone 
and conglomerate is missing. This and the slickensiding observed de¬ 
notes faulting. If this faulting were of a minor displacement, 
Kootenay strata would appear in the Carbondale river, thirteen 
hundred feet lower than the ridge. Kootenay strata was not recognized 
in this sequence, in the valley of the Carbondale, so the fault must 
have a displacement of at least thirteen hundred feet. The faults 
on the east and west limbs do not have a displacement of more than 
four hundred feet. 

It is not definitely knoYrn that the anticlinal structure 
ends with the faulting of the Wapiabi over the Allison. It is 
felt rather that east limb of the anticline includes some of the 
Allison formation. This would then account for the abnormal cal¬ 
culated thickness of 6000 feet for the Allison formation. 

Along the Upper Carbondale a transverse fault has been 
drawn. This fault was not actually observed and probably does not 
exist as a fault. It might better be referred to as a fault zone. 

It is impossible to reconcile the north 80 degrees west strike of 
the strata north of the Carbondale river without faulting. Evidence 
of this faulting is present in many outcrops one of which is shown 





in Figure 10. The photograph shows Blairmore strata faulted over 
Blairmore strata. The incompetent shales and coal of the Blairmore 
and Kootenay formation have absorbed much of the faulting and have 
therefore reduced the apparent displacement. This faulted zone will 
be discussed further in the description of the overthrust fault. 

South of the river three peculiarities, in the strata 
underlying the overthrust, are noted. The nose of Precambrian rock, 
jutting out between Macdonald creek and Carbondale river ? faults out 
the Kootenay strata leaving the Blairmore formation underlying the 
overthrust. Secondly, on the northwest side of this ridge a narrow 
slice of Fernie is brought up with the Kootenay strata. This slice 
is the finely banded sandstone of the upper Fernie so it is not 
displaced a great deal further than the Kootenay underlying it. 

Lastly, on the north slope of Mount McCarty and underlying it an 
additional band of Blairmore and Kootenay has been exposed. The 
strata underlying the thrust in this latter locality is a slice of 
Kootenay strata. This is faulted over Blairmore which in turn 
overlies Kootenay. This latter contact is not exposed so it is 
assumed to be normal. The next Kootenay band overlying the Blair¬ 
more is faulted and overturned. This is probably a portion of the 
east limb of the anticline described above. The Kootenay coal measures 
overlie the basal Blairmore conglomerate which is at this point 
fifty feet thick. 

The band of Blairmore underlying the conglomerate is, of 
course, overturned. It is faulted over the underlying volcanics

which in turn is faulted over the Blackstone, 


Structure at the Headwaters of Lynx and Lost Creeks 

The structure on the north branch of Lost creek and the 
west branches of Lynx creek is a continuation of the Carbondale 
structure. Here Kootenay strata underlies the overthrust Precarnbrian 
rocks and is faulted over the Blairmore (Figure 12). However, this 
band of Blairmore is not the one underlying the overthrust in the 
Carbondale district, but is the east arm of the anticline -which has 
plunged northward from Prospect hill and partially disappeared under 
the main overthrust fault. 

A slice composed of Upper Fernie and basal Kootenay strata 
has been brought along the thrust fault and is exposed on the ridge 
lying between Lynx and Lost creeks. 

The Allison strata is included in the east limb of 
the anticline, then faulted along the axis of the adjoining syncline 
and folded into another broad anticline and syncline. This inter¬ 
pretation is based on both topographic expression of the formation 
and the dips obtained. A northwestward trending ridge is located in 
the northern portion of section 18, township 6, range iu Eastward 
dips occur along the top and east side of this ridge which indicates 
the trough shown in section A-B. 








Structure of the Mesozoics south of Garbondale river and 
under the main overthrust 

It has been noted that the strike of the main overthrust 
fault changes south of the Garbondale river* This change of strike 
results in a gradual advance of the thrust fault over the Kootenay 
to Wapiabi sequence of strata until finally at the south fork of 
Castle river the thrust fault overlies Allison strata. 

On upper Gardiner creek a thin band of Kootenay underlies 
the main thrust. The Kootenay strata is underlain by strata of the 
Blairmore* Crowsnest Volcanics* Blackstone, Bighorn and ¥apiabi. 

This is the east arm of the Prospect Hill anticline. Here it is not 
plunging out as north of the Garbondale* but is being faulted out 
by the overthrusting Precambrian rocks. 

Southeastward to 0*Hagen creek the Blackstone is faulted 
out by the more competent volcanics being thrust over it and the 
Precambrian overrides the Kootenay wedge. Finally between the two 
branches of the Castle river the Precambrian lies directly on the 
Allison. This condition persists eastward throughout the remain¬ 
der of the map-area. 

Willoughby Badge and Cherry Hill 

Willoughby Ridge enters the map-area in section 27* 
township 6* range lu Formations of the ridge are from west to east 
Growsnest Volcanics* Blairmore and Kootenay. The Kootenay formation 
is faulted over the 7/apiabi. This ridge continues in the map-area 








i

with a general trend of north 25 degrees west until it reaches 
Lynx creek south of which it terminates in Cherry hill. The ridge 
throughout its length has a double crest, one formed by the, Crowsnest 
Volcanics on the west and the second formed by the basal Blairmore 
and Kootenay sandstone. Forces exerted upon the ridge have caused 
the strata to be squeezed and pushed so that proceeding south the 
distance between crests narrows and the Kootenay strata on the 
eastern side is almost completely faulted out. 

Cherry hill offers a complicated structural condition. 
North of Cherry hill the bands of strata are, from west to east, 
Crowsnest Volcanics, Blairmore, Kootenay, Blairmore, Crowsnest 
Volcanics, T Wapiabi, Bighorn, Blackstone, Crowsnest Volcanics, Blair¬ 
more and Wapiabi. Relations of the formations and faulting is 
shown in the accompanying map (Figure 13)* These formations are ex¬ 
posed in almost continuous outcrop along lynx creek. However, on 
the south side from west to east along Carbondale river, which too 
offers continuous outcrop, the succession of bands from west to east 
is Blairmore Wapiabi, Bighorn Blackstone, Bighorn and Wapiabi. The 
upper portion of Cherry hill is a broad block of Blairmore strata 
which is anticlinal on the west and synclinal on the east. Both 
of these structures have a l5 degree plunge southward. 

Cross section B-C shows that anticlinal synclinal feature 
observed on the surface of Cherry hill also occurs at depth. The 
two outcrops of Bighorn strata on Carbondale river indicate that

this formation too is anticlinal. It is therefore concluded that 
this local folding of the strata has carried to some depth. The 
stratal bands north of Cherry hill then have been folded and have 
plunged out beneath Cherry hill. 

Maverick Hill and Maverick Hill Fault 

Maverick hill lies on the east side of Turtle Mountain 
anticline and is a portion of the east arm of that structure. Its 
structure is of interest not only from a scientific view point 
but also from the economic because the Kootenay band which is mined 
at Adanac in the Blairmore area continues southward into Maverick 
hill. 

The major part of the disturbance in Maverick hill has 
centered around a north-south striking fault with an easterly dip. 

It was not possible to see exactly where this fault began on the 
north portion of the hill but a mile south of the northern boundary 
of the map area the fault is very pronounced, fhen first observed 
the fault has an eastward dip and centres about strata at the Kootenay- 
Blairmore contact. As the fault continues southward the'dip becomes 
vertical and then dips slightly westward. 

The strata on the west side of Maverick hill and about 
half way down is eastward dipping and the Kootenay strike lies in 
a normal manner on the Fernie. About two thirds of the way up the 
hill on the same side the faulting begins and stratal dips are

- 51 - 

much steeper but still eastward. On top of the hill the strata is 
badly faulted and folded but in general it is upright. This does 
not apply to the broad band of sandstone which is faulted into a 
horizontal attitude along the southern summit of the hill. Down 
the east side of the hill the dip becomes westward and the Blairmore 
strata is overturned. From north to south then on Maverick hill 
there is a change from normal lying strata to upright strata, to 
overturned strata. Figure 1U shows the beginning of the faulting 
and a portion of the basal Blairmore strata, with an attitude of 
north 9 degrees west, 68 degrees east. 

Goal seams and shale horizons have here, as in many cases 
throughout the area, served as a lubricant for faulting. Outcrop of 
coal on the surface is only in small showings, the bulk of the seams 
having been faulted out by more competent strata. It is thought 
that by careful plotting of the attitude of horizons adjacent to 
the coal and correlating these with horizons at Adanac Mine the 
positions of coal seams at depth could be accurately determined. 

For instance, it was noted that the unconformity which is described 
in the discussion on Blairmore strata lies about three hundred 
feet above the Blairaore-Kootenay contact above Adanac Mine. On 
the southeastern portion of Maverick hill this unconformity is 
overturned and lies 300 feet below the main fault line. 

Strata of the hill have been subjected to more than one 
eompressional force. A heavy basal band of Blairmore sandstone 



- 52 - 

observed on the south end has been pushed from the south as well as 
the east. Looking north from the valley of the Carbondale river 
this band which is thirty feet thick has been folded and faulted 
into the shape of an S. 

Carbondale Hill Structure 

Carbondale hill lies south of Maverick hill. It includes 
strata from the volcanic band lying east of George and Lynx creeks 
to the Kootenay of Maverick hill. 

The southwest peak which is also the highest point of 
Carbondale hill is formed by a ridge composed of Crowsnest Volcanics. 
This ridge is a continuation of the volcanics lying east of George 
creek and the strike having changed from north 25 degrees Y/est to 
north SO degrees west. These volcanics are a part of the west am 
of the Turtle Mountain anticline. East of the volcanic ridge the 
dip of the Blairmore strata changes from west to east. This is 
the southernmost expression of Turtle Mountain anticline. 

The anticlinal attitude of the strata may be observed 
from Carbondale river to the crown of the hill. In the heart of 
the anticline the Jurassic strata, occurs with both east and west 
dips in accordance with the limb it is on. This is overlain by 
Kootenay which is overlain by Blairmore. 

As in the case of Maverick hill, the strata of the east 
arm of the anticline on Carbondale hill Is much distorted. From

the point where the eastward dips begins, to the eastern side of 
the hill, the Blairmore is folded and faulted, the axes of the folds 
and the trends of the faults being in a north 10 degrees west 
direction. This folding is illustrated by the sketches shown below'-. 

The first sketch shows basal conglomerate of the Blairmore formation 
folded along the east limb of the anticline. The second sketch 
gives the attitude of Blairmore ridges along the north crest of 
Carbondale hill and also on the east arm of the anticline. 

It would appear from the above attitudes that the formation- 
al forces on Carbondale hill were from the west acting east. However, 
there is along the north side and adjacent to the Carbondale river 
a fault with a southwest trend. The fault line may be observed 
along the river bed. Movement along this fault line has been north 
and eastward and has brought the Blairmore and Kootenay strata of 
Carbondale hill over the north to south folds of Blairmore, Crowsnest 
Yolcanics, Bighorn and Blackstone formations north of the Carbondale 
river. This may best be observed in the north half of section 9> 
township 6, range 3« Here the Kootenay strata has a general east-” 
west strike and the underlying formations over which it is thrust 
strike in a general north-south direction. 

Evidence of this northward component of thrusting is seen 
on the southern flank of Carbondale hill. Here both transverse 
and longitudinal faulting of the anticline occurs. This transverse 
faulting and the transverse faulting east of this is the result of

a thrust component acting in a N-S direction. The transverse 
faulting may continue northward through Carbondale hill and across 
the Carbondale river but present evidence does not warrant extending 
it that far. 

Carbondale hill is then the southward expression of the 
plunging Turtle Mountain anticline with the east limb faulted and 
folded. Also in its strata, a northward component of force has 
expressed itself by both transverse faulting and thrust faulting 
the latter having a fault plane with an east-west strike. 

Anticlinal Structure of Ginger Hill 

Ginger hill is located north of the junction of the Car¬ 
bondale and Castle rivers. It is structurally an anticline with a 
southeastward plunge. The anticlinal condition is not so apparent 
on the top of the hill because erosion has removed much of the east 
arm and vegetation has covered the outcrop® Too, a fault occurs 
along the east arm of the anticline® This fault brings the igneous 
pebble conglomerate which is seven hundred feet above the ba.se of 
the Blairmore to the surface. However, the rock exposed on the hill¬ 
top is two hundred feet higher stratigraphically than the conglomerate 
so the displacement has not been very great. The fault varies in 
attitude from slightly eastward dipping to vertical and strikes in 
the same direction as the anticline. 


The southward extension of the anticline is exposed both

on the Garbondale river and Castle river. Both of these streams 
are antecedent to the anticline and therefore expose a cross section 
of it. This cross section is best observed on the south bank of 
Castle river just above its junction with the Carbondale. Here the 
Blairmore forms the centre of the anticline (Figure l£). Then 
progressing up or down the stream the strata exposed is Crowsnest 
Volcanics* Blackstone and Bighorn. 

The fault in the east limb is transverse to the strata of 
that limb. On the top of Cherry hill it is exposed in Blairmore 
strata* on the Carbondale river it is seen in the Crowsnest Volcanics 
and along the Castle river it has faulted into Bighorn, and Wapiabi 
strata. 

It is not possible to identify horizons accurately enough 
or to get a true dip to determine the exact plunge of this anticline 
but by estimating the stratigraphic position of the Blairmore rocks 
exposed on Ginger hill it Is calculated that the plunge is 5 degrees. 

Backus Mountain Thrust 

The name Backus Mountain Thrust is given to denote a 
main thrust line of Mesozoic strata over Mesozoic strata. This 
thrust begins in the vicinity of Carbondale hill and has been des¬ 
cribed there as Kootenay strata thrust over north and south folds. 

At the east end of Carbondale hill the fault trace changes direction 
90 degrees. From here the direction of the trace is north h$ degrees

west. The dip of the fault plane is 25 degrees. 

This fault throughout its course in the map-area and in 
the Beaver Mines map-area to the east is different from the usual 
type of fault for the area in that it does not follow the regional 
trend. It is a thrust fault and not a transverse fault because it 
follows along the front of the Blairmore and rides over the areal 
structures and strata rather than faulting through them. 

The direction of the force causing this thrust must have 
been in a different direction from that which produced the north- 
south folds of the area. This then is another expression of the 
northward acting component of force. 

In the eastern portion of the map-area and both north and 
south of the Backus Mountain thrust, slice faulting occurs. The 
slicing is caused by the northward component. In mapping the slices 
an attempt has been made to show how they arrived in their present 
position. The faults involved in the slicing are not exposed. 

Turtle Mountain Anticline 

The southern extension of the Turtle Mountain structure 
which here is described as the Turtle Mountain anticline enters the 
Carbondale map-area at section 2l+, township 6, range 3. The western 
limb of the anticline is not exposed but that of the eastern limb is. 
The Paleozoic strata of the eastern limb as it enters the map-area 
strikes north 5 degrees east, and dips 6u degrees east. 






- 57 - 


The anticline is plunging south 20 degrees east at an 
angle of 6 degrees. Paleozoic rocks disappear under Fernie strata 
in the middle of the east boundary of section 21*, township 6, 
range 3« From here, south to O'Hagen creek, Fernie strata occupy 
the centre of the anticline, then Kootenay and finally Blairmore. 

Both the west and east arm of the anticline are faulted 
and folded. Faulting on the west am is imbricate. The faulting 
of this arm may be said to extend as far as Lynx creek. However, 
adjacent to the axis the main fault is one which brings the Kootenay 
strata over Blairmore strata, the Kootenay coal having again acted 
as the lubricant for faulting. This fault extends south to the 
Carbondale river. Faulting of the east arm has been dealt with in 
the discussion of Maverick hill. 

The upheaval of this anticline of Paleozoics is considered 
to be contemporaneous with the Rocky Mountain uplift. 

The Main Thrust Fault 
Areal Description 

The main thrust fault of the PreCambrian and Paleozoic 
rocks over rocks of Mesozoic age lies to the south, southwest and 
west of the map-area. Within the area the trend of surface trace 
of the fault changes from a north-south direction in the north to 
a southeasterly direction in the south. Glacial material and talus 
cover the point of contact over most of the area but it was observed

on the ridges at the headwaters of Lynx creek, section 13, township 
6, range 5, west of the fifth meridian; on the southeast slope of 
Kootenay North; and on the northern slope of Table mountain, section 
2, township 5, range 3 , west of the fifth meridian. At the first 
outcrop mentioned, on upper Lynx creek, the Precambrian limestones 
are thrust over the coal bearing Kootenay strata. Much of the move¬ 
ment has been absorbed by the Kootenay coal seams so very little 
gouge appears. The Kootenay strata has an attitude of north 20 
degrees west, fifty degrees west. No accurate attitude could be 
obtained for the Precambrian strata because of its being intensely 
folded and faulted. The exposure of the contact at Kootenay North 
revealed Precambrian overlying Kootenay sandstone but in this instance 
there is six inches of black gouge. The gouge is very fine-grained 
and contains pulverized carbonaceous matter. The attitude of the 
fault plane at this and the first location is north 15 degrees 
west 20 degrees west. The exposure on Table mountain shews Pre- 
cambrian strata overlying that of the Belly River formation. The 
Precambrian is faulted and folded very intensely (Figure 16). The 
gouge is eleven inches thick and lies between a black argillite 
on top and green Belly River sandstone below (Figure 17). The fault 
plane at this point strikes north 85 degrees west and dips 21 
degrees south. 

Strata above and below the thrust was observed at a num¬ 
ber of places where the actual contact is not exposed. However, it

was possible from these outcrops and the exposed contact to determine 
the strike and dip of the fault. 

The dip of the fault plane within the Carbondale map-area 
is 20 degrees. The strike varies. The measured strike on Table 
mountain is north 85 degrees west* on the mountain front between 
the branches of Castle river it is north 70 degrees west: in Gardiner 
Creek valley it is north 80 degrees west and along the north of 
Mount McCarty it strikes north 80 degrees west. On North Kootenay 
the strike has changed to north 20 degrees west which is the attitude 
that persists to the northern boundary of the map-area. 

It was noted as Hume (1932.) described that along the major 
portion of the thrust Kootenay strata has been associated with the 
thrusting. Hume points out that not only are coal beds less competent 
but they seem to act as a lubricant. Coal seams underlying the 
overthrust were noted on upper Lynx creek (Figure 12), Kootenay North, 
the upper Carbondale river and Mount McCarty. Hume too notes that 
slices of Paleozoic rocks are brought up along the thrust on Mount 
McCarty. These slices were not observed or if observed were not 
recognized as such. 

The Lewis Thrust 

The Lewis thrust has been studied in some detail in 
Montana. Here the thrust has a northwest trend and dips southwest 
at 3 to 7 3A degrees.(Willis, 1902). Willis also noted that the 
fault plane was warped. Marland Billings (1938) does not agree 






- 60 - 


ivith Willis’s interpretation of the Lewis thrust as an ”erosion 
thrust”• He says that the absence of overridden talus and gravels 
along the thrust plane indicates that the Lewis overthrust is not 
an erosion thrust but is a subsurface fault* Also Billings agrees 
with Daly in a Laramide age for the thrusting* Hume (1932) in 
commenting on the structure in North Kootenay Pass area notes that 
the attitude of the fault changes from south 80 degrees west with 
a southerly dip of lU degrees to an attitude on Kootenay North of 
north 20 degrees west and dipping 20 degrees west. He suggests that 
this may be due to warping of the fault plane subsequent to faulting. 
The main overthrust fault in the Crowsnest Pass has been referred to 
as the Lewis thrust. 

In the foregoing pages on the discussion of structure it 
•was noted in several instances that the forces acting upon the strata 
were not always in the same direction. Attention is drawn to the 
following cases. The regional trend of the ridges changes within 
the area to a more northerly direction, the difference of strike 
being as much as 25 to 30 degrees. The strata on the south end of 
Maverick hill has been subjected to a north-south stress which has 
folded into an S-shape. Also the Backus Mountain thrust fault is 
thrust in such a direction that a northward component on thrust is 
necessary to explain it. Moreover, this thrust has overthrust strata 
and structure with a north-south strike. In the Carbondale River 
valley north of Mount McCarty the faulting becomes more intense than 


.

elsewhere observed and the slickensiding observed on the fault block 
denotes movement to the northeast. 

However, north of the general line of the Carbondale river 
this northward component of force seems to disappear entirely and 
the only force acting was acting from the west or slightly south of 
west. It would appear then that a definite change of direction of 
force occurs in North Kootenay Pass area. 

.We have noted in discussion of Clapp's work in Montana 
(Clapp, 1932) that the forces causing uplift were acting from the 
southwest. Also when the direction of force changes in the south 
the main overthrust fault name is changed from Lewis to Lombard. 

It would appear then that the Lewis thrust fault begins 
in the south where faulting is caused by a southwesterly to north¬ 
easterly force and it is here suggested that the use of the name 
Lewis should be discontinued where the northwesterly force discon¬ 
tinues, that is, in the vicinity of, or at North Kootenay Pass. 

It is not suggested that the actual fault has discontinued 
but it has been, noted that the discontinuance is in a fault zone. 
Change of direction of force has been brought about both by faulting 
and warping of the strata. Probably no one major fault exists but 
closer investigation may reveal a fault zone through the Clarke 
range to the Flathead valley. This idea is substantiated by Bethune's 
description of an east-west striking, southward dipping fault zone 


at Flathead towns!te 








- 62 - 


It is conceivable that the Lems thrust is the result of 
two forces which are not contemporaneous. It is noted that the 
north-south trending structure is overridden by the Backus Mountain 
thrust both in the vicinity of Backus Mountain and also north of 
Garbondale hill. It is obvious then that the northward thrusting 
was of a later date than that of the eastward thrusting and so the 
Lewis thrust as here defined Is In part a younger thrust than the 
thrust lying north of North Kootenay Pass. 






CHAPTER V 


SUMMARY AMD CONCLUSIONS 

The Carbondale River area lies in the southwestern part 
of Alberta, seven miles south of Blairmore and fifteen miles west 
of Pincher Creek. The area is accessible by automobile from Bellevue 
Burmis or Pincher Creek. 

The area includes both mountainous and foothill terrain. 
The Clarke and Flathead ranges lie to the southwest and west of 
the map-area. The Castle river and its tributary the Carbondale are 
the main drainage arteries. Streams draining into these rivers are 
of both the subsequent and antecedent type. 

Settlement within the area is very sparse. Most of the 
people within the area are employed in the lumbering industry. 

Forest growth is very abundant in the western portion of the map-area 

Rocks of the area range in age from the Precambrian to 
the Recent. Precambrian rocks form the Clarke range, and Paleozoic 
and Precambrian rocks form the Flathead range. The foothills are 
composed of Mesozoic rocks of Jurassic and Cretaceous age, and 
Tertiary rocks of Pleistocene and Recent age. The Mesozoic and 
Tertiary rocks are, with the exception of the Crowsnest formation, 
shales and sandstones of marine, brackish and fresh water origin. 

The Crowsnest formation is composed of igneous extrusives and 
pyroelastics. Pleistocene rocks are both of glacial and recent

origin. The glaciers deposited till and erratics as they moved 
down from the large mountain cirques.. The rivers have, since 
glacial times, deposited gravel, sand and silt along their courses. 

Structurally the area might be described as containing 
the convergence of three phases of regional structure. Due south 
of the map-area lies the Waterton region. Except for local warping, 
rocks and faults of the Waterton area dip to the southwest and strike 
northwest. The Lems thrust is low-angled and probably warped. On 
the north of the Garbondale River area, in the Crowsnest Pass region, 
the strata dips westward and strikes a few degrees west of north. 

The main overthrust fault in Crowsnest region is steeper than it is 
in the Waterton area. To the west of the map-area lies the Flathead 
valley and its complex structure. It is known of the Flathead that 
it is bounded on the west by a westward dipping fault, on the east 
by by an eastward dipping fault and on the north in the vicinity of 
the locality of Flathead townsite by a fault zone some elements of 
which are south and southwestward dipping* 

The structure of the Carbondale river expresses all three 
of these structural conditions. The strata of the northern portion 
strike and dip in general conformity with those of the Crowsnest 
region; that of the southern portion follows the general trend of the 
northern portion of the Waterton areal structure. The east-west 
fault zone in the Flathead townsite vicinity is probably the same 
fault zone that extends along the upper Carbondale river. Too,

the synclinal structure of the Clarke range does not extend further 
than North Kootenay Pass, 

The foothill structure of the map-area expresses two 
definite directions of the force which caused the faulting and 
folding. The force acting from almost due west was the first force 
which folded and faulted the strata. This was followed by a north¬ 
eastward acting force which caused the north-south structure to be 
partially overridden. The most northerly expression of this north¬ 
ward component is along the upper Carbondale river. 

Because the Lewis thrust is attributed to a northeastward 
acting force in the Montana region and is also partially the result 
of a northeastward force in the Carbondale area, it is suggested 
that the name Lewis be applied to the main thrust fault only as 
far northward as North Kootenay Pass, north of which the results of 
the northeastward component of force are not observed.
