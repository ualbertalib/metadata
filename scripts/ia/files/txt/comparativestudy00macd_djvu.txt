Chapter I 
Introduction 

General Statement 

Two complete and one incomplete salt well cores from 
the salt wells at McMurray and Waterways were examined in 
detail. There cores are; from; 

1. The Alberta Government Salt Well No. 1, 

McMurray, Alberta. 

2. The Industrial Minerals Limited Cottee Well 
No* 1, Waterways, Alberta* 

3* The incomplete core of the Industrial Minerals 
Limited No. 3, Waterways, Alberta. 

The purpose was to determine the kind of sediments 

■ 

and their age. 

This study was restricted to the Paleozoics. In the 
McMurray area this consisted of the sediments from the 
PreCambrian up to and including the Upper Devonian 'Water¬ 
ways formation® 

Widespread correlations were used only for the 
purpose of strengthening age assignments given.

Location and Accessibility 

The McMurray Area, Alberta, is the one under con¬ 
sideration. The specific area is at the confluence of 
the Athabaska and Clearwater Rivers. Map 2 shows the 
location of the salt wells in this area. Both McMurray 
and Waterways lie within township 89, range 9, west of 
the 4th meridian, latitude 56. McMurray is about 240

miles northeast of Edmonton, Alberta, by air route. The 
end of the steel of the Northern Alberta Railway is at 
Waterways, a distance of 304 miles from Edmonton. Water¬ 
ways is 3 miles up the Clearwater River from its junction 
with the Athabaska River. Canadian Pacific Airlines have 
an airfield at Waterways, and a sea base at McMurray. 
Canadian Pacific Airlines provide mail and passenger 
service from Edmonton to Waterways. During the summer 
season the Hudson Bay Transport does a freighting business 
downstream from McMurray to Aklavik on the Mackenzie River 
delta. 

Salt Industry at McMurray and Waterways 

Attempts to establish a salt industry go back to 1907 f 
while salt has been produced commercially since 1936. The 
latest salt well development took place in 1939 at Water¬ 
ways. This operation was carried out by Industrial 
Minerals Limited. Industrial Minerals Limited Salt Well 
Mo. 3 is located about 500 feet southwest from the salt 
plant at Waterways (see Map 2). Surface elevation at this 
well is 853 Feet above sea level. 

Cottee No. 1 Well was drilled by Industrial Minerals 
Limited in 1936. It is located 589 feet southwest of 
Waterways station (see Map 2).

A No. 2 and a No. 4 well also have been drilled by 
this company. 

In 1919 the Alberta Government Salt Well No. 1 was 
started on Lot No. 8 of the McMurray townsite (see Map 2). 
Three years later the Alberta Government drilled No. 2 
Well on the N.W. i, Sec. 52, Tp. 88, R. 8, West of the 4th 
Meridian. This is near Draper at the confluence of Deep 
Creek and Clearwater River. (See Map 2). 

Still earlier the Northern Alberta Exploration 
Company drilled two wells at the mouth of Horse River. 

The first well was drilled in 1907 and the second in 1912. 

In 1924 a grain©r plant was built by the Alberta Salt 
Company Limited to manufacture salt from brine. This 
venture proved unsuccessful. 

History and Previous Work Done 

The history of the McMurray area commenced feetek in 
1778 when Peter Pond reached the Athabaska River byway of 
Methys Portage and the Clearwater River. He was followed 
by Phillip Turner who surveyed the Athabaska River below 
the mouth of the Clearwater during the years 1790-92*(14) 

In 1793 Sir Alexander Mackenzie passed through the 
McMurray area on his way up the Peace River.

During the years 1799-1805 David Thompson surveyed 
the Athabaska River System from Lesser Slave Lake to the 
Clearwater Forks (74). In 1819 Franklin described the 
area between the Clearwater Forks and the Lake Athabaska 
(30). W. D. Harmon (5) in his T, A Journal of Voyages and 
Travels in the Interior of North America”, 1820, reported 
on the physical features of the McMurray area. Richardson 
(58), Back (8), and Simpson (65) described this region* 

They passed through on the way to the Arctic* Dr. Selwyn 
(63), Director of the Geological Survey, mapped and 
reported on the Upper Peace River in 1875, while his 
assistant, Professor Macoun, returned to the east by way of 
the Athabaska and Clearwater Rivers.(46) 

In 1882 Dr. R. Bell made a geological survey of the 
Athabaska River below the mouth of Lac La Biche River to 
the Clearwater River (12). William Ogilvie carried out a 
micrometer survey of the Lower Athabaska River in 1884 
(54). R. G. McConnell (1887) gave the most complete 
report on the McMurray region to this time. Camsell (17) 
(1902) also reported on the area. Wyatt Malcolm (1913) 

(47) summarized the work done by earlier men in this area. 
S. C, Ills (28) carried on extensive work in the McMurray 
area with bituminous sands from 1913-1925. MeLearn (1916) 

(49) described sections along the Athabasca River near

McMurray. In 1919 Dr. J. A. Allan (1) did field work 
in the McMurray area and recommended that the Provincial 
Government drill in the vicinity of McMurray. This was 
done. Allan also located the Alberta Government No. 2 
Salt Well near Draper in 1921,(2). 

McMurray Salt was described by Allan in 1929 (3) 
and by Cole in 1930 (22). Warren (1933) examined and 
determined the age of fossils collected by Dr. J. A. Allan 
and Dr. K. A. Clark from limestone outcrops along the 
Athabaska and Clearwater Hivers. He gave the name Water¬ 
ways formation to this Upper Devonian limestone which 
carried a Portage fauna. 

Many oil geologists have investigated the bituminous 
sands. Among them were Hume, Sproule, Bell, Slipper, 

Dowling, Moore, Clark, Blair and Russel, (see bibliography). 














Chapter II 


Summary and Conclusions 

(1) The Me^urray area as shown on the key map 

(Map 2) is underlain by Preeambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, 
beds, while a mantle of unconsolidated deposits (River 
gravels, sands, silts, etc,, in the Clearwater Valley)' 
and glacial deposits on the uplands) of Recent age form 
the surface. 

(2) The writer believes that the lowermost 14 feet 
of the industrial Minerals Limited Salt Y/ell No. 3 is 
Upper Ordovician. Fauna, lithology, and the paleogeog- 
raphic trend of the Upper Ordovician S&a is given as 
evidence even though the amount of core samples available 
was small for such a determination. 

(3) The age of the salt is somewhere between Upper 
Ordovician and Middle Silurian. 

(4) A 3 to 5-foot bed of Middle Silurian occurs in 
the salt wells at McMurray and Waterways, Alberta. 

Evidence is the lack of lithological relationship to the 
sediments above and below, the lithological similarity to 
Middle Silurian beds in Lake Athabaska to Great Slave Lake 
region, and the discovery of a Guelph (Middle Silurian

fauna on the Clearwater River east of McMurray, Alberta. 

(5) No Lower or Middle Devonian was found at Water¬ 
ways and McMurray. 

(6) The Waterways formation is Upper Devonian and 
Portage-Naples in age. 

(7) As-far as the writer could discern great time 
breaks show no expected erosional features. It may be 
that no deposition and no erosion took place. One 
exception is thought to be the Middle Silurian-Rock Gypsum 
contact. 

(8) There is apparently no porosity in the Waterways 
formation at Waterways and McMurray, Alberta. This lime¬ 
stone is dense. The writer could find no indications that 
would suggest porosity in adjacent areas. 

(9) No primary gypsum could be found at Waterways and 
McMurray. It occurs as altered anhydrite or as satin spar 
veins and interbeds. This altered anhydrite or rock 
gypsum is limited to the uppermost 3-5 feet of the 
evaporite series. There is evidence to indicate that this 
rock gypsum was a cap rock and probably an erosional 
surface. No lower horizons of rock gypsum were found.

series could not be proved. 


(11) The source of the iron in the dolomitic red 
beds could not be determined. 

(12) Secondary anhydrite veining occurs. 

(13) Epithermal calcite and marcasite veining occur. 

(14) Marcasite was formed subsequent to deposition 
of the limestone and calcareous shale. 

(15) The nodules examined were contemporaneous with 
deposition* 








Chapter III 


TEE TECHNIQUE AND EXAMINATION 

Oj WELL SAMPLES 

I. General statement 

The purpose is to give a brief outline of 
possible methods and those used In the identification of 
the sedimentary rocks and their mineral constituents with 
respect to the following salt wells cores: 

1. The Alberta Government Salt Well No. 1, 

McMurray, Alberta. 

2. The Industrial Minerals Limited Salt Well, 

No. 1, Waterways, Alberta. 

3. The Industrial minerals Limited Salt Well, 

No. 3, 'Waterways, Alberta. 

The first two well cores were fairly complete, 

while only intermittent sections of core were available 

for No * 3. 

II. Methods of Drilling Wells 

The following three methods are common: 

1. Diamond core drilling. 

2. Percussion drilling. 

3. Rotary drilling. 

Of these three, the diamond core drilling is the 
best for preserving good rock specimens. It produces a 
solid cylinder of rock, preserving bedding and other 













i 



IH 







■ Ur' 











11 


features of the section. Complete or fairly complete 
macrofossils can be obtained from a core. 

• The second, percussion drilling, produces rock 
fragments or bit fragments. These are satisfactory for 
the examination of mineral and microfossil content. This 
method destroys macrofossils, bedding planes, and other 
features. 

The third method, rotary drilling, yields bit 
cuttings or rock fragments. Drilling mud carries or 
floats these cuttings to the surface where they must be 
washed before examination. This is the poorest method of 
obtaining good samples. 

The writer was fortunate to have diamond drill cores 
of the sediments from Waterways and MeMurray salt wells. 
Such features as the kind of bedding, the facies changes, 
the fossil horizons, veining and so on, could be deter¬ 
mined. 

Illo Collection and Labelling of Samples 

Samples were collected from every facies change 
observed in the three well cores. These samples were 
placed in metal-capped glass vials Sir" X 3/4” in size. 
Labels giving data as to the particular well, the depth, 













12 


and the kind of sedminetary rock were glued upon these 
vials. This data was written on the labels with an 
indelible pencil. Within the vials are typewritten slips 
giving the depth from which the sample was taken. 

Fossil samples from the various fossil horizons in 
these cores were placed in trays and labelled as to the 
depth from which they came. These fossil specimens were 
identified and the specimens were discarded except for a 
few specimens such as the conodants, fish jaws and 
Trochiliscids. 

IV. Disintegration of Samples 
1. General statement 

Disruption to preserve grain size was un¬ 
necessary since the sediments in the samples were non- 
clastic. However, several methods of disruption were 
attempted in order to separate fossils from mottled 
limestone and argillaceous limestone matrix# 

2 # Methods of Disruption 

The following methods were tried: 

(1) the use of such tools as the rock splitter, 
the geological hammer, the nippers, a sharp small stylus 
for finer work# 

(2) heating the limestone to a dull redness and 









13 


then plunging it into cold water. 

(3) the saturation of the limestone with 
sodium carbonate solution and then plunging it into acid. 
The theory was that the pressure of the evolving carbon 
dioxide gas would aid in freeing the fossils from the 
limestone. 

(4) The use of NaOH and KOH to digest arg¬ 
illaceous material in the limestone and thereby assist 
in the separation of the fossils from the limestone 

matrix. 

- 

(5) The use of ammonium nitrate saturated 
solution (44). A cold solution will dissolve 117 grams 
of ammonium nitrate per liter. A solution brought to a 
boil will take in 1100 grams of ammonium nitrate per 
liter. If a fossiliferous limestone sample were boiled 
for five minutes in such a saturated solution, it was 
thought that the solution would penetrate the limestone 
especially along the fossil outlines. ^uick cooling v^ould 
cause the excess ammonium nitrate to crystallize out. In 
doing this it would separate the fossils from the lime¬ 
stone . 

3* Conclusion 

With the exception of the rock splitter, the 
geological hammer, the nippers, and the stylus, these 









14 


methods of disintegration were found impracticable for 
limestone. Saturation of the limestone by solutions 
could not be achieved within 5 or 10 minutes. Most of 
these solutions required hours in order to penetrate any 
depth into the sample. 

V. Methods of mineral Isolation 

The general procedure is to take the whole 
sample, crush it, fraction it into quarters, then take 
opposite quarters, mix them, fraction them once again, 
and so on, until a desired fraction of sample is obtained. 
This is the correct procedure for clastic sediments. 

But since the sediments worked with were non-clastic, only 
small chips or fragments 'were taken, crushed, and mineral 
isolation attempted by the following methods: 

1. Acids accompanied by decantation. 

2. Horseshoe magnet. 

5. Heavy liquids. 

1 * Acid and Decantation Separation 
Hydrochloric acid was used to remove the lime- 
stone from calcareous shale and argillaceous limestone. 
These, the acid and the limy sample, were placed in a 
tall measuring cylinder. When the reaction was complete 
the residue was washed several times with water. The

r 

water was then decanted off as well as some of the finer 
clay minerals. The residue was fried and examined by 
optical means. 


2 . Horseshoe magnet 

A horseshoe magnet was passed over the clay 
mineral residue which had either been placed on a watch 
glass for this test. No minerals were attracted to the 
magnet. This magnet was also passed over imersion 
mounts of these clay residues to see if any magnetic 
minerals were present. 


3* Heavy liquids 

These were discarded because it was found that 
immersion mounts of crushed samples were more satisfactory 
for mineral determinations. 


VI, Identification of Minerals 


The following methods of mineral identification 
were used: 

1. The optical method by means of a petrographic 
microscope. 

E. Acids (Hydrochloric and Nitric). 

3. Ether, 


4, Potassium ferrocyanide. 

5. Blowpipe method. 


















- 16 


6. Closed tube method. 

7. Staining. 

1. The Optical method 

This method was the most reliable. The index 
of the mineral and the angle of extinction were sufficient 
to determine most minerals. 

(1) Gypsum and anhydrite 

Gypsum was determined on the basis of color, 
low positive index and angle of extinction. Anhydrite, 
on the other hand, was determined by rectilinear cleavage 
flakes, index from 1.57 to 1.61, and parallel extinctions. 

(2) Galclte and Dolomite 

These two are the most difficult to determine. 
Their indices are relatively near each other, namely, 
calcite w - 1.658 . e = 1.486 
dolomite w » 1.68z . e s 1.503 
Both blink upon rotation of the stage. Both have high 
order interference colors. 

However, the writer believed that these minerals 
could be distinguished on the basis of habit. Dolomite 
appeared as a microcyrstalline aggregate with definite 
rhombohedral habit. Grain size was approximately 1/200 
mm. Calcite did not express this rhombohedral habit nor 

did it aggregate. Lammelar effect was noticeable 











17 


especially in vein calcite. a mosaic pattern was a 
common feature of. most of the limestone. 

(3) Salt 

The salt index was about the same as Canada 
balsam immersion liquid. Only a faint yellow-orange 
border was observable about the square salt grains. 

Under crossed nicol the salt was extinct. 

(4) Marcasite 

This mineral was generally determined with the 
use of binoculars. It expressed either arrowhead twinn¬ 
ing or a twinned aggregate. 

2. Acids 

Hydrochloric acid was used to assist in deter¬ 
mining limestone, dolomite and anhydrite, ^itric acid 
was used to test marcasite 

(1) Limestone and Uplomite 

Limestone and calcite effervescent freely in 
dilute cold hydrochloric acid while the microcrystalline 
dolomite effervesced slowly. Crystalline replacement 
dolomite required heat to cause effervescence. Dolomitic 
limestone showed moderate vigor. 

(2) Anhydrite 

Anhydrite produced no reaction in cold or 
















- 18 


heated dilute hydrochloric acid, however, when anhydrite 
was immersed in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, the 
reaction was vigorous. 

(3) hareasite 

A 15/^ solution of Nitric acid caused marcasite 

to react. 


3. Ether 

Ether was used to identify bitumin. A crushed 
sample of bituminous limestone was washed about in ether 
on a watch glass upon the complete evaporation of the 
ether, a slight oil ring was on the watch glass, 

4. Potassium Ferrocyanide (31 ) 

The immersion of maroon and green-grey dilute 
acid potassium ferrocyanide gave a light bluish-white 
precipitate. This proved the presence of ferrous iron 
and accounts for the maroon splotched dolomite. 

5. Blow Pipe Method 

The blow pipe was used to determine if side rite 
was matrix of nodules found in the well cores. No iron 
test resulted and it was concluded that the matrix was 
limestone. 

6. The Closed Tube Method

t'he closed tube was employed to determine the 
presence of gypsum. Heat was applied to a tube containing 
sampled thought to contain gypsum. If water condensed in 
the upper part of the tube, then gypsum was present. 

7. Staining 

Several methods of staining have been advanced 
for the differentiation of dolomite from limestone. 

Among these are- the following: 

(1) Silver nitrate-potassium chromate solution. 

(2) Ferric chloride“ammonium sulphide solution. 

(3) Lemberg’s solution. 

(4) Fairbanks Modified Lemberg’s solution. 

(5) The 10 per cent Ferric chloride solution. 

(6) The Titan yellow solution. 

Otto ( 44) who had investigated all the known 
methods of staining, concluded that the silver nitrate- 
potassium chromate was the best. 

(1) The Silver Nitrate-Potassium Chromate Method 

This method required a 10 per cent solution of 
silver nitrate 9 Powdered or broken surfaced calcite or 
dolomite was immersed for 2-5. minutes. It was then 
washed thoroughly with distilled water to remove the 
excess silver nitrate. This water was decanted off. A 

neutral solution of potassium chromate was prepared and 







20 


poured upon the sample. After one minute the sample 
was again washed in distilled water. Calcite stained 
brown, white crystalline dolomite remained colorless. 

Microcrystalline dolomite stained a somewhat lighter brown 
than the calcite. 

(2) Ferric chloride - Ammonium Sulphide Solution 

Steidtttiann ( 72 } discovered that if a fresh 
broken or ground surface of calcite or dolomite was 
first wetted with water and then immersed in a 2j per cent 
solution of Ferric chloride for 10-15 seconds, the excess 
washed off, then immersed in ammonium sulphide for 10-15 
seconds and the excess washed off, the calcite would stain 
black and the dolomite would not stain. 

(3 } Lemberg’s Staining method 

Lemberg’s ( 29 ) staining method was used with 

variable results. It was prepared by boiling the 

following constituents for 25 minutes; 

6 parts logwood chips 
4 parts aluminium chloride 
60 parts water. 

Too many variable factors make this solution 
unsatisfactory. Time, concentration and variable amounts 
of haematoxylin obtained from the logwood are among these 
factors. 












21 


(4) Fairbanks * Modified Lemberg Solution ( 29) 

Fairbanks 1 solution is as follows: 

0.24 grams haematoxylin 
1.6 grams aluminum chloride 
24 grams water 

This solution was brought to a boil and then 
cooled, a small amount of hydrogen peroxide was used to 
oxidize the haematoxylin to hematein. 

Galcite and dolomite are immersed in the cold 
staining solution for 5 minutes. The solution is washed 
off. As a result, calcite is stained, while, dolomite 
is not. 

(5) The 10 per cent Ferric Chloride Solution 

Douglas, king and Misick (25 ) found that a 10 

. 

per cent solution of ferric chloride by weight was useful 

! 

in dolomite and calcite determinations. The solution is 

’ 

applied for 1 minute or so. Limestone effervesced slowly 
and the surface encrusted. When the specimen was washed 
off the limestone showed a brown stain. Dolomite showed 
no stain. 

( 6 ) The Ti tan Ye 11 ow ‘ Lie thod. 

■ Douglas, King and Mi sick ( 25) found that Titan 
yellow could be used successfully in the laboratory. The 
mineral is first powdered, then placed in a test tube 











22 


with 5 c.c. of distilled water. To this is added 3 c.c. 
of 0.1 per cent hy weight titan yellow solution. The 
mixture is well shaken. Added to this is 2 -3 c.c. of 
0.1 N. of potassium hydroxide solution. This is boiled, 
cooled and the residue examined for change of color, if 
the residue turned red, then magnesium is present. The 
degree of -color then would indicate the amount of lime¬ 
stone and dolomite present. 

( 7 ) Staining methods .riprlied 

The Writer used the following staining methods: 

(1) Silver nitrate-potassium chromate 

(2) Ferric chloride-ammonium sulphide 

(3) The 10 per cent Ferric chloride solution. 

The others were not used. With the exception 
of Titan yellow, the principles involved in the others 
were the same as those used. Lack of time also prevented 
further experimentation. 

(8) Conclusions Regarding Staining 

The writer found the following evidence with 
regard to staining: 

(1) Crushed limestone stained as expected. 

(2) Chips of argillaceous limestone sometimes 
stained in splotches. The application of acid to both 
stained and unstained seemed to have equal effervescence. 

(3) Crystalline dolomite when tested remained 


















23 


unstained except along fractures. 

(4) The microcrystalline dolomite, the charact¬ 
eristic jjype of dolomite, in the Waterways salt wells 
stained almost as deeply as limestone. This may be due 
to the stain filling in and about the aggregate micro¬ 
crystalline mass of dolomite. 

Staining methods were therefore unreliable. 

VII. General Conclusion 

As a result of this study it was found that the 
most reliable method so far discovered is the optical 
method.

IV The Precambrian 

In the Alberta Government salt Well No* 2, which is 
located near the junction of Deep Creek and the Clearwater 
River, PreCambrian grey granite was struck at 785 feet, 
and was penetrated to a depth of 4 feet* The total 
depth of the well is 789 feet. 

Overlaying this granite is a 4“foot zone of breccia* 
The makeup of this breccia is a s follows; 

Breccia pebbles - quartz, feldspar and anhydrite. 
Matrix - dolomite and some gypsum* 

Minor grains - pyrite, garnet and biotite. 

PreCambrian (?) rocks have been reported in place within 
a triangle formed by the Muskeg River and the Athabasca 
River in Twp. 94, R* 10, W. of 4th Meridian,(88) 

Other knobs of Precambrian appear in Twp. 100 and 
Ranges 4 and 5, and in the junction between the two 
branches of Reed Creek* On Marguerite River, Twp. 101, 

R. 4 and 5, outliers of the main Precambrian are present. 
Pleistocene and Recent deposits cover most of the Pre¬ 
cambrian in the area to the east and southeast.

Fourteen feet from the bottom of the Industrial 
Minerals Ltd*, No. 3, at 938 to 952 feet a lithological 
change occurs. These sediments are buff-brown to dark 
brown mottled limestone and dolomite limestones. Porosity 
seems mainly due to fossil cavities. Black bituminous 
limestone interbeds are present and the one at 952 feet 
contains Tentaculites quite unlike Tentaculi tes macken« 
zdensis Kindle of the Waterways formation» 

An examination of the limestones and dolomitic lime¬ 
stones reveals a dwarf fauna as follows: 

Brachiopod - Rhynehotrema (?) nearest capax type 
Gastropods - Hormotoma gracilis Hall ? 

Setomarla pagoda (Salter)? 

Loxonema murrayanum Salter? 

Ostracod - Aparchites whiteavesi Jones 

probably 

This fauna is^ Richmond in age (Upper Ordovician). 

2. Industrial Minerals Ltd. Well No. 1 (Log in back 

pocket) 

In the Cottee No. 1 well at Waterways, a lithological 
|change occurs at 897 feet. This is one foot above the 
I bottom of the well. This limestone is identieal with that 
of No. 3, Well at Waterways which has just been des¬ 
cribed. Therefore, it also is considered upper 
Ordovician in age.

3. Further Evidence to Support Richmond Age 

(1) Verbata No. 2, Unity, Saskatchewan 
Both a Richmond fauna and a lithology similar to that 
at Waterways was found at Verhata Well No, 2. (L.S. 7, 

Sec. 24, Tp. 41, R. 24, W. 5 Met .) 


(3) Vermilion Consolidated Oils Ltd. No. 15, 

Vermilion,' Alberta, L.S.D. 6, Sec.“T2T~Tp. 49, 

R7Trwrtrrr ~ —.—™ 

A series of buff-brown porous limestones and dolomites 
below the salt are considered Gambro-Ordovieian in age. 

(92) 


(4) Red River Formation, Southern Manitoba 
Lithologically the beds of upper Ordovician exposed 
in the Lake Winnipeg area (61) are similar to those at 
Waterways. The Stony Mountain in particular is described 
as grey to yellowish, subcrystalline limestone, with 
layers and mottled areas of yellowish brown dolomite. 


The same fauna is found in the Stony i^ountain, namely: 

Rhynchotrema eapax 
Hormotoma cf gracilis 
Aparchites whiteaTesi

(5 ) The Hudson Bay Region 

Savage and Van Tuyl (61) consider the Shammattawa 
limestone correlative with the Stony Mountain of Manitoba 
both from the standpoint of lithology and faunal bases* 
They correlate the fauna of these beds with the upper 
fauna of the Bighorn dolomite in Wyoming. 

(6 ) The North Arm of Great Slave Lake 

Hume (32) and Foerste (29a) have described small 
collections of fossils of Urper Ordovician age at Red Rock 
point on the North Arm of Great Slave Lake. Here massive 
red dolomitic fossiliferous limestone grades to buff dol- 
omitic limestone to the north. At Gypsum Point farther 
to the south gypsum occurs bedded and veined with the red 


( 6 a) Snare River and Ing ra.y Lake. N.jjy.f . 

Lord(94) describes a Richmond (Upper Ordovician) 

fauna in dolomite and sandy dolomite overlying the 
PreCambrian II miles from the mouth of the La Martre 
River. The Silurian-Ordovician-Precambrian relation¬ 
ship at Waterways is remarkably similiar to LordTs 
description at La Martre River.

(7) Lake Nicholson, N.W.T, 

This lake is located about 200 miles east of ^reat 
Slave Lake and just to the south of Lake Dubawnt. Tyrrell 
(1897, p. 54f)(52) collected Upper Ordovician fossils that 
correlate with the Bighorn fauna.

Upper Ordovician fauna has been found Seward 
Peninsula, White Mountains, Porcupine and Yukon Rivers

(9) McKenzie Mountains 

Upper Ordovician is also believed to be present in 
the McKenzie Mountains ( 85 )•

age in the Tigonankweine Range which is west-central from 
the McKenzie Mountains, N. W* T. 

(11) Beaverfoot-Brisco Range of Southeast British 

Columbia. 

Walker's (75) Beaverfoot Formation contains an Upper 
Ordovician fauna which correlates with the Bighorn of 
Wyoming. A fauna, Beaverfoot in age, is also present in 
Kananaskis, Palliser map area, Alberta (90). 

(12) Commonwealth Milk River Well, Northeast of 
MilkHRTver, Alberta 

The ostracod Aparchites is found below the Devonian 
in sediments lithologically similar to the Bighorn lime¬

Coleman gastropods and orthoceras were found by Allan (6) 
Conclusion 

The evidence presented indicates the possibility of 
Upper Ordovician at the base of Industrial Minerals 
Limited No. 3 Salt Well at Waterways* Alberta. Lithology, 
fauna, and the apparent widespread nature of the Richmond 
Sea strongly indicate Upper Ordovician. The westward 
trend of Upper Ordovician north of Lake Winnipeg, its 
presence at Unity and Provost, as well as the north south 
trend of the Ordovician on the North Am of Great Slave 
Lake suggests that the Richmond seaway passed Waterways, 
Alberta. 

VI Pre-Middle Silurian or Middle Silurian ? 

—- ' ' 1 1 " & 

1* Definition 

These beds may be defined as the dolomite, dolomitic 
anhydrite, salt and gypsum beds that overlie the porous 
buff to buff“brown mottled limestone and dolomitic lime* 
stone of the Upper Ordovician age. The upper limit is the 
brown crystalline rock gypsum and powdery white gypsum. 
Overlying the gypsum anhydrite dolomite salt are thin- 
bedded, platy, creamy to dark brown, fractured, and 
calcite veined limestone and dolomitic limestone of Middle 
Silurian age.

is Upper Ordovician, Lower Silurian, or Middle Silurian 
in age is unknown. Consequently it is assigned Pre-Middle 
Silurian or Middle Silurian in age. The writer is 
inclined to believe that the evidence indicates either 
Upper Ordovician or Lower Silurian or both* 

2« Local Relationships of the Pre-Middle Silurian 

or Middle Silurian (?) in the^SfeHirray ^rea 

In the Alberta Government No. 2 this series overling 
a 4-foot breccia zone of granite pebbles, quartz and 
anhydrite in a matrix of dolomite and some gypsum. Under¬ 
lying this zone is the PreCambrian grey granite. 

In the Industrial Minerals Ltd. No. 1 and No. 5 the 
Pre-Middle Silurian series overlies upper Ordovician. 

The Alberta Government No. 1 does not penetrate 
-through the anhydrite-dolomite salt-gypsum series. 

. 

In each case this series is overlain by Middle 
Silurian*

(1) Fort McKay Well (3) 

This well, located on the west bank of the 
Athabaska River, 1 mile north of Fort McKay, penetrated 
ao rock salt, but struck a strong flow of salt brine. 

(2) Athabaska Oils Ltd. (3) 

In 1912 this company drilled a well which penetrated 
through limestone into gypsum salt and limestone. This 
well is located 20 miles below Fort McKay. 

(3) MoMurray Area 

Sproule (67) estimated that there are about 300 feet 
of dolomite limestones, salt and gypsum present in this 
region of Silurian age. His evidence was based on a 
poorly preserved fauna, which he thought was Silurian in 
age. Recently a collection of fossils from along the 
Clearwater River, east of McMurray has been determined as 
Guelph in age (93). The upper limestones are, therefore, 
Middle Silurian in age. 

(4) La Saline 

Allan (3) reports strong saline springs 27 miles north 
of McMurray on the east side of the Athabaska River 
valley at La Saline. Allan believes the source of this 
salt to be the same as that of at Salt River in northern

most Alberta. This places the source in beds called "Fitz 
gerald dolomite" by Cameron (15). There are not Upper 
Silurian in age but Middle Silurian and older. 

(5) The Salt River Escarpment 

This escarpment is west of Fort Smith* Alberta. 

This plain rises five to six hundred feet above a salt 
plain through which Salt Kiver meanders on its way to the 
Slave River. Allan (5) states that this escarpment 
consists largely of anhydrite, gypsum, and dolomitic lime- 
stone. Salt springs arise from the base of this escarp¬ 
ment. 

(6) Peace Point on Peace River, Alberta 

Cameron (15) and later Kindle (41) described the 
Fitzgerald dolomite at Peace Poiht. Anhydrite and gypsum 
were overlain by thin-bedded limestones and dolomitic lime 
stones. Kindle (41) found Spirifer crispus in this upper 
bed, and the age was, therefore, Middle Silurian. 

This section is correlated with the Salt River 
Escarpment by Allan (3). The writer has correlated a 
thin Middle Silurian section as well as the Pre-Middle 
Silurian or Middle Silurian (?) from the salt wells at 
Waterways with this Fitzgerald dolomite at Peace Point. 













58 


The basis for this correlation was lithological. The 
recent discovery of a Guelph fauna on the Clearwater 
River (93) has confirmed that correlation. Camsell (18) 
described anhydrite changing to gypsum at Peace Point. 

The writer found this to be true in the gypsum zone of 
the salt wells at Waterways and McMurray. 

(7) Slave River Outcrops 

Camsell (18) and Cameron (15) described 10 feet of 
thin bedded impure gypsum overlain by SO feet of fractured 
brecciated limestone at LaButte on Slave River. 

(8) Imperial Oil Co. Well. Nintsi Point (15) 

In this well, on the north shore of Great Slave Lake, 
the Fitzgerald dolomite consists of 20 feet of brown 
dolomitic limestone, underlain by 255 feet of anhydrite, 
gypsum and grey dolomitic limestone with gypsum underlying 
the Fitzgerald dolomite are the "Red beds". This series 
is 595 feet thick and consists of red shale, with gypsum 
and red stained salt and anhydrite. 

(9) Gypsum Point, Great Slave Lake 

Underlying grey porous fossiliferous limestone 
containing gycnostylus gualphensis a Guelph fauna of 


Middle Silurian age, are red shales and gypsum and a lower

sandstone, at the base of which is not exposed (15). 

Hume (32) describes red beds of dolomitic limestone 
capping the sandstone at Red Point. Farther north on the 
same stratigraphic level Hume finds an Upper Ordovician 
fauna in red dolomitic limestones. 

(10) Wrigley-Cap Mountain Section of Franklin 
Mounta in s, N. W, T . 

Williams 1 (87) Franklin Mountain formation of Lower 
Silurian age is composed of 500 feet of buff dolomite, 
pea-green shale, and sandy red shale, with Rhipidome11a 
hybrida and R. circulus in the upper 20 feet. This was 
overlain by the Mt. Kindle formation of Middle Silurian 
age. No upper Ordovician was found. 

(11) Bear Rock Section, Fort Norman 

Stelck (35) describes red and green shales and 
gypsum below thin-bedded limestone and dolomite of 
Silurian age that correlates with Middle Silurian of 
other regions nearby. Stelck considers these red and 
green shales and gypsum Silurian, Ordovician, or older. 

(12) Carcajou and Norman Ranges 

Hume (31a) places red gypsiferous shales below well 
bedded limestones of Middle Silurian age as questionably

Ordovician. No fossils were found in these red shales. 

(13) Vermilion Ridge Well No. 1, Normal Wells, N.W.T. 

Hard, dense, dolomitic limestone of the Ronning 
Formation {Silurian)is underlain hy anhydrite and green 
shale interhands, and red and green shale with dolomite 
and gypsum and a 1200-foot salt series which overlies 
Middle Cambrian (72). 

(14) Vermilion, Alberta 

In the Vermilion Consolidated Oils, Limited, Well 
No. 15, L.D.S. 6, Sec. 12, Tp. 49, R. 6, W. of 4 Mer. the 
dolomite-anhydrite-salt-gypsum series occurs below the 
Devonian. Salt beds are 415 feet thick. Overlying these 
are dolomitic red beds. Hume (92) believes this salt is 
Devonian in age based on Trochiliscids found just below 
the salt. 

(15) Unity Valley Well No. g, Unity. Saskatchewan 

Edmonds (£7) reported a thin band of gypsum at 2940 
feet. From this depth occasional gypsum seams occur; 

;also threads or veinlets are to be seen penetrating the 
dolomite. Rock salt was penetrated at 3110 feet. About 
800 feet of Devonian lie above the gypsum.

(16) Verbata No, Z Well, Unity, Saskatchewan 

About 900 Feet of dolomite, anhydrite, salt and 
gypsum lie between probable Middle Devonian (85) and the 
Upper Ordovician which was determined by the fossil 
Rhynehotrema capax . About 440 feet of these beds 

are salt. Overlaying the salt series are dolomitic red 
beds.

Wallace (77) reports much anhydrite in the lower 
part of the gypsum zone. There is no proof of the source 
of the salt springs. Wallace also reports reddish 
argillaceous limestones in the Upper Mottled Limestone and 
red shales in the Stony Mountain Formation (Ordovician)

Upper Ordovician, determined by microfossils. Gypsum also 
occurs higher up in the Middle Devonian. Wickenden (86a) 
assigns to Silurian a series of red shales, red dolomites, 
anhydrite and gypsum in the Dauphin Well. In the 
Winnipegpses Well red and pink dolomites overlie Stony 
Mountain (Ordovician) and are placed in the Silurian, At 
Mafeking No. 3 Well about 300 feet of dolomites containing 
some pink and red beds overlie 200 feet of hard dense 
buff to cream dolomite with Leperditia at the base. 
Wickenden places these beds in the Silurian. Wickenden 
also reports red beds and gypsum in the Devonian, 

(19) North Dakota 

Seager et al. (62) recognizes the probability of the 
Manitoba section of Silurian extending into northeastern 
North Dakota. Well samples do not indicate any areal 
extent of Silurian in North Dakota. In Garter’s Northern 
Pacific No, 1, there are 1,590 feet of Ordovician. It 
contains the Bighorn fauna, Rhmehotre<gha cf. capax, 
Dalmanella cf. meeki and the maroon and green shales in 
earthy and crystalline dolomites. 

Kline’s (43) report of the log of a well at Grafton 
shows red shale beds present in the Red River, and the 

Stony Mountain (Ordovician), It is present in the Stone¬ 
wall formation (Silurian) and also in the Devonian.

In the Hamilton Well there is a strong saline flow 
in the Stonewall - Stony Mountain Series. 

The log of the Prairie Oil and Gas Go. of Kidder 
County shows salt water as being present in the Stonewall** 
Stony Mountain Series. 

Generalizations from the Evidence 

1. Sediment were deposited by the Ordovician Sea 
from the Mackenzie River Basin to the Blackhills of the 
Dakotas. 

2. Red beds are present in the Upper Ordovician in 
the Norman Wells and at the North Arm of Great Slave 
Lake. Red beds are also present in Southern Manitoba and 
North Dakota. 

3. Red beds also extend up into the Devonian of 
Manitoba and North Dakota. 

4. Red beds overlie salt from Norman Wells to North 
Dakota, though these may not always be the same age. 

5. Salt water is present in the Stonewall-Stony 
Mountain series of North Dakota. The source of Salt 
springs in Manitoba may also be the Stonewall-Stony 
Mountain series.

beds with some anhydrite and gypsum* 

7. Except in the Northeastern North Dakota this 
Silurian is not recognized. 

8. There is probable Lower Silurian in the Franklin 
Mountains of N.W.T* with sandy red shale at the base* 

9. Middle Silurian limestones and dolomitic lime- 
stones overlie dolomitic red beds, red shales, anhydrite 
gypsum and salt from Norman Wells to Waterways. 

10. No evidence of Middle Silurian has been found 
from Waterways to North Dakota. 

11. The trend of the evidence seems to favor a Stony 
Mountain-Stonewall (Lower Silurian-Upper Ordovician) age 
for the dolomite, anhydrite, salt and gypsum series. 

IE. Gypsum seems to be associated with the uppermost 
beds of the dolomite-anhydrite-salt“gypsum series from 
Gypsum Point to Unity, Saskatchewan*

the writer to define the dolomite-anhydrite-gypsum- 

salt series at Waterways as Pre-Middle Silurian or Middle 

Silurian (?) but younger than part of the Upper Ordovician* 

Middle Silurian 


Definition 

The Middle Silurian at the Waterways and McMurray 
salt wells consists of 5-5 feet of thin-bedded* platy, 
creamy to buff-brown, fractured and calcite veined lime¬ 
stone and dolorn!tic limestone* Some dark brown plates 
have bitumin. There are no fossils. The underlying beds 
consists of powdery to dirty white rock gypsum and 
crystalline deep brown rock gypsum, dolomite, dolomitie 
anhydrite and salt of Pre-Middle Silurian or Middle 
Silurian (?). The overlying beds are the calcareous shale 
and the limestones of the Upper Devonian period. 

Middle Silurian at McMurray and Waterways 

Five feet of Middle Silurian beds are present in the 
Alberta Government Salt Well No. 1 at McMurray. At 
Industrial Minerals Limited Salt Well No. 1, Waterways, 
Alberta, these limestones and dolometic limestones are 

feet thick. At the No. 5 well this bed is about 5 feet 
thick.

Svidence for Middle Silurian Age 

The writer proposes the following evidence for 
support of Middle Silurian age of these beds: 

(1) Kindled Peace Point Section 

Kindle f s (41) section at the "Upper End of the Cliffs 
at Peace Point is as follows: 

(a) Thin-bedded, drab, slightly magnesian 

limestone ....... 10 feet. 

(b) White and cream colored anhydrite and 

gypsum in thin horizontal ribbon-like bands . 50 feet 

(c) White gypsum and anhydrite ... 6 feet* 

The presence of Spirifer crispus found in the upper¬ 
most 10 feet establishes the age as Guelph, or upper 
Middle Silurian. This 10-foot bed resembles the 3-5 feet 
jof Middle Silurian beds at Waterways and McMurray Salt 
IWells in lithology. Both at Peace Point and at Waterways 
these beds overlie rock gypsum and anhydrite. 

Two miles below the section at the "Upper End of the 
Cliffs" Kindle de scribes: 

(a) Lake clay.. 6 feet. 

(b) Glacial clay and boulders . 9 feet. 

(o) Blue shale and thin-bedded limestone with

abundant Devonian fossils .... 8.feet .... angular 
unconformity ..... 

(d) Grey, thin-bedded, bard, argillaceous lime¬ 
stone, with a metallic ring, lower,third brecciated ..... 
70 feet. 

nindle states that { c) and (d) beds have the sharpest 
contrast lighologically and faunally. 

This section shows the same relationship of the upper 
Devonian Portage to the Middle Silurian platy limestones 
and dolomitic limestones as does the Upper Devonian at 
Waterways to the platy limestones and dolomitic limestones 
underlying it. 

(2) La Butte Section 

Camseii (18) measured two sections on the west bank 
of the Slave River opposite to La Butte. The northern¬ 
most section contained 2 Limestone fractured, broken ... 

20 feet; Gypsum, thin bedded, impure .... 10 feet. 

The other section was as follows: 


Massive limestone fossils ...... 5 feet. 

Pebbly limestone ... 10 feet. 

Brecciated limestone bituminous ... 6 feet. 
Grey limestone, thin bedded ..... 10 feet.

Fossils from the upper part of this last section were 
Middle Devonian. Cameron (15) was of the opinion that 
the lower part was Silurian on the basis of the lithology 
of the limestone and the underlying gypsum. 

(3) Stony Island Section 

About 12 miles above Fitzgerald, Alberta, on the 
Slave River Cameron (15) described the Stony Isl and 
section: 

Limestone, light colored, massive, grading down to 


dark grey dolomitio limestone .. 6 feet. 

Sandstone, conglomerates, arkose, granite, Coarse 
grained, porphyritic .... 8 feet. 


(4J-" seam of black bituminous shale in the limestone). 

Kindle found a Silurian fauna in the limestone of 
this section. 

(4) Gypsum Point 

Cameron (15) found Pycnostylus guelphensis at 
Gypsum Point on Great Slave Lake in thin-bedded, fine¬ 
grained, dark grey, badly fractured, soft, dolomitio 
limestone. These beds were above gypsum. Pycnostylus 
guelphensis is Upper Middle Silurian in age.

(5) Clearwater River 

On the Clearwater River at the Cascade Rapids, 

Sproule (28) described "massive dolomites and thinly 
banded arenaceous and argillaceous limestone .... that 
yield a limited number of poorly preserved gastropods, 
pelecypods, and brachiopods, are probably Silurian." 

Recently a Guelph fauna has been described from beds 
exposed on the Clearwater River east of McMurray (93)* 

4. Conclusion 

This evidence makes tenable the assignment of a 

Guelph age to the 3-5 feet of thin-bedded, platy fractured 

' 

limestones and dolomitie limestones in the Salt "fells of 
McMurray and Waterways* 

VIII The Upper Devonian 
-- - 

1* Definition 


The Upper Devonian series of mottled limestones, 
argillaceous limestones and calcareous shale was termed 
tfee Waterways formation by Warren (82). This formation 
is underlain by Middle Silurian at Waterways and McMurray. 
It is overlain by recent alluvial sediments from the 
Athabaska and Clearwater Rivers. Elsewhere the Waterways

formation is capped by the Lower Cretaceous, McMurray 
sandstone which contains bitumen. Total thickness of the 
Waterways formation is not known in the McMurray region 
because the upper part has been eroded off. 

2. The Waterways Formation at Waterways and McMurray 

A maximum, thickness of 408 feet of Waterways limestone 
and calcareous shale was measured in the Alberta Govern¬ 
ment Well No. 1 at McMurray. The top of the Waterways 
formation is an erosional surface. Alluvial clays, silts 
sands, gravels, limestone debris 15 feet thick overlies 
this surface in the Alberta Government Salt Well No. 1. 

In Industrial Minerals Limited No. 1 Well, the 
Waterways formation is 390 feet thick. Overlying its 
erosional surface is 100 feet of unconsolidated material. 

In the No. 3 Well the Waterways formation is 
approximately 364 feet. Overlying the top of the Waterways 
are 151 feet of soft shale, bituminous sand (Lower 
Cretaceous in age) and then unconsolidated material. 

In the Alberta Government No. 8 Well there is about 
370 feet of Waterways. This is overlain by 40 feet of 
unconsolidated materials.

and Clearwater Rivers at McMurray, Alberta. This lime¬ 
stone is part of the Waterways formation. It carries a 
Portage fauna. This fauna is lowermost Upper Devonian 
in age. 

The main collections of fossils from the limestone 
outcrops in the McMurray area are those of Dr. J. A. Allan 
and Dr. K. A. Clark of the University of Alberta (82). 

Dr. Allan also collected fossils from the core of Cottee 
No. 1 Well (7) and from Alberta Government Well No. 1(1). 
These along with collections by the writer are correlated 
with Portage-Naples faunas from other parts of North 
America in Table No. 2 which is enclosed in the pocket 
at the back of this report. 

Table No. 1 (in the pocket) represents a correlation 
of lithology and fauna within the Waterways formation in 
the three salt wells studied by the writer. 

a study of Table No. 2 indicates a strong resemblance 
between the Waterways and Snyder Creek, Missouri, faunas. 
Euchiola . Sntomis and Manticoceras are yet to be found at 
Waterways and McMurray.

which correlates with the Snyder Creek formation. 


Conodonts which are present in the Waterways formation 
are described by Youngquist (91) in the Independence 
shales at Middle Amana, Iowa. Conodonts are described 
by Baker (9) as present in the Olentangy shale of Ohio. 
Since Manticoceras is present in the Olentangy shales 
these conodonts are considered basal upper Devonian in 
age.

Petrology and Petrography 

I General Statement 

The intention is to discuss both the common and 
unusual features of the log of Cottee Well No. 1. In the 
main it will be petrological but petrography will be 
brought in to support observations made. Things of special 
interest in the No. 3 Well and in the Alberta Government 
Salt Wells Nos. 1 and 2 will be included where they are 
related to this study.

Overlying the PreCambrian mineralized granite is a 
4-foot zone of breccia. The main constituents are: rock 
fragments o f: oligoclase, quartz, and biotite; quartz 


pebbles, and anhydrite pebbles or globules; cement - 
dolomite, with biotite, chlorite and garnet; and veins - 
satin spar. Overlying this breccia zone is dolomite, 
dolomitic anhydrite, anhydritic dolomite and salty dolomite. 
Here clastic sediments from an exposed or continental 
condition are mixed with non-elastic sediments. Feldspar 
and quartz fragments show no rounding whatsoever. Con¬ 
sequently, these fragments must have been deposited very 
near to the source of production. This breccia may be 
described as arkosic but not as an arkose because the 
feldspar content is less than 25$ of the rock. It isquite 
probable that the feldspar content is variable and much of 
the breccia may be classed an arkose.

presence of anhydrite and dolomite, of feldspars which 
have the colors of the composing minerals at the source* 
Little or no decomposition of these feldspars is observ¬ 
able •

The lowermost core sample contained a 2" band of 
black bituminous limestone* Fine bedding is obvious and 
a few minute tentaculites with wide annulations occur in 
the sample examined. 

Though the evidence of environmental conditions is 
not good, the writer suggests a brackish water environ¬ 
ment based on the following facts: 

(1) In the overlying 14 feet of limestones and 
mottled dolomitic limestones, a dwarf fauna was found* 

This contained ostracods which today favor brackish water 
conditions. 

(2) The fine-bedded limestones suggests quiet waters 
and slow deposition, (lagoonal conditions). 

(3) The presence of oil or bitumen suggests a 
probable in situ origin for the oil*

however, was earlier since it was found at the very base, 
while the tentaculites were found a few feet above*

1. Mottled Dolomitic Limestone 

This 14-foot section consists of porous, fossilif- 
erous, buff and brown, mottled dolomitic limestone* These 
sediments contain a dwarf fauna upper Ordovician in age. 
The evidence for this age is the Qrthid and Rhynehonellid 
type brae hi o pods; the toxonemia , Homo torn! a , lot omari a , 
Lophospira type gastropods, and the ostracod Aparchites 
whiteavesi Jones. 

£. Observations 

An examination of these sediments brings out the 
following observations*. 

1. The mottled patches are quite irregular and seem 
to show no relation to any guiding influence. 

2. Fossils are present in both light and dark 
patches. They do not seem to influence the mottling. 

3. The preservation of the fauna is generally poor*

This observation has been expressed by many writers in 
relation to dolomitic limestone, 

4. Internal molds of fossils are often partially or 
completely lacking a factor which contributes mainly to 
the porosity of the rock, 

5. Geode-like colorless twinned calcite partially 
fills the cavities of many fossil shells, 

6. The fauna is a dwarf fauna with gastropods and 
ostracods most abundant. 

7. One small veinlet contained both satin spar and 
anhydrite. The anhydrite is partially altered to gypsum® 

8. Microcrystalline dolomite is present in 
aggregate form with the limestone in both the Buff and the 
brown. 


9. ' Ankeritic ^dolomite is present in both the buff 
and the brown, but more so in the brown. 

10. Some internal molds of gastropods in the brown 
patches are buff colored. 

11. Oil stained bands are present throughout the 
14-foot section. 

12. These observations apply to the 1-foot section

3# Classification of Dolomitic limestone 

Generally speaking, theories related to origin of 
dolomitic limestones may be classed as primary or second¬ 
ary. The classification is expanded somewhat as follows: 

(1) Primary deposition of dolomitie limestones 

(a) Deposition as elastics 

(b) Deposition by inorganic chemical processes 

(c) Deposition by organic chemical processes 

(2) Secondary deposition of dolomitic limestones. 

(1) Primary Deposition of Dolomitic Limestone 

(a ) Deposition as elastics 

There is no suggestion in Well Core No. 3 of clastic 
dolomitie limestone deposited, aggregated, and cemented 
to form a new dolomitic limestone. 

(b) Deposition by inorganic Chemical Processes 

Wallace (78) brought forward the possibility of 
magnesium and calcium carbonates being transported as 
colloids stabilized by protectiye organic colloids and 
finally precipitated as an intimate mixture that sub¬ 
sequently crystallizes to form dolomite. Definite proof 
of this is lacking#

Marine leaching has been advanced as a possibility* 
Calcium carbonate is more soluble than magnesium carbon¬ 
ate. Thus the magnesium carbonate content would be enriched 
by leaching of calcium carbonate. The most favorable 
environment for this is in a shallow restricted lagoon. 

The solubility of calcium carbonate is also increased by 
increase in salinity. This is usually true in a lagoonal 
type of environment. Thick deposits of dolomitic lime¬ 
stone would be accounted for by slow subsidence in the 
area. Daly’s (24) contention that the oceans of early 
Paleozoic time had a low calcium : magnesium ratio due to 
lack of source materials would fall in line with this 
theory of dolomitization by marine leaching. 

(c ) Deposition by Organic Chemical Processes 

Plant and animal structures contain some magnesium 
carbonate. This quantity may be as great as 25 per cent 
in some calcareous algae. Whether it forms dolomite or 
Is utilized to form dolomite is not known. Plants also 
use up carbon dioxide and thereby increases the alkalinity 
)f the sea. This in turn leads to precipitation of 
magnesium hydroxide. Calcium carbonate precipitates at 
the same time due to photosynthesis. Magnesium hydroxide 
probably changes to magnesium carbonate. Porosity may be 
effected by reductioh in alkalinity which may remove

magnesium carbonate from the beds being lithified. 

Wallace (76) favors an organic chemical hypothesis 
for dolomitization and mottling in the Lower and Upper 
Mottled Limestones of the Ordovician of Manitoba* He 
considers that the limestone immediately surrounding 
decomposing algae has been dolomitized, the magnesium 
salts liberated from the algae being enough to raise the 
percentage of Mg ions sufficient that recrystallization 
could take place. This phenomenon would take place with 
the formation of limestone in the upper layers of cal¬ 
careous ooze of the sea bottom. In other words it would 
be practically a contemporaneous process. Furthermore 
he maintains that a limestone may undergo dolomitization 
when the percentage of Mg ions in the sea water affecting 
it is smaller than the chemical equations taken to re¬ 
present the process would demand. It is likely that the 
percentage of Mg ions was higher than it is today, yet 
it was Iwo enough so that magnesium salts were not toxic 
enough to exclude organic life in the seas of that time. 
Summarily Wallace attributes to fucoids and to unicellular 
algae of the plackton, the probable main source of 
magnesium salt sufficient to cause the mottling effect in 
the Upper and Lower Mottled Limestones of Manitoba.

This is the theory of marine dolomitization by re¬ 
placement of calcium carbonate in the calcareous ooze on 
the sea floor by magnesium salts contained in the sea 
vater. This theory seems to be the most acceptable one 
Dffered to the present time. It fits most of the fa©ts as 
they are known. The process carries on in sea water at 
Drdinary temperatures in lagoonal areas where saline con¬ 
centration may be high. Carbon dioxide released from 
crganic decay may disturb the equilibrium of the solution 
nay react with magnesium salts to form magnesium carbonate, 
rlow the calcium carbonate and the magnesium carbonate re¬ 
act to form dolomite is not clear. Twenhofel (73) suggests 
that mottling due to dolomitization is initiated from 
centres composed of organic or perhaps inorganic materials 
and forms patches outward from those centres. 

4. Application of Theories to No. 5 Well 

Many of the postulations set up for secondary de¬ 
position of dolomitie limestones satisfactorily answer 
lihe observations as established by the writer in Well No. 

3. It is conceivable that the area in this region was a 
shallow sea area. Dolomite may have formed in sheltered 
lagoons for Precambrian was encountered less than 3f- miles 
to the east. Whether this was a knob or the true Pre¬ 
cambrian shield is not known. Among other possibilities,

the dwarf fauna may suggest a fairly high degree of 
salinity. Ostracods of today favor hrackish conditions 
and these may have done so in the past* Oil stains could 
also suggest quiet lagoonal environment. 

An interesting feature of this mottled dolomitic 
limestone is the porosity without apparent permeability. 
Neither bitumen anhydrite or gypsum fills the cavities. 

The porous condition is found even within two inches of 
dolomitic anhydrite. 

5. Factors of Doubt 

1. Organic material as far as could be observed 
showed no relation to the mottling, except that internal 
molds were buff in the dark brown patches. 

2. No centres of origin, organic or inorganic, from 
Krhich the outward processes of dolomitization could be 
determined, were observed. 

3. Dolomite seemed quite dispersed and the dark 
patches seem to bear some relation to the amount of ferrous 
carbonate present. 

6. Conclusion 


The facts are insufficient to support either a primary

or secondary theory of deposition of dolomitic limestone<> 

VI Gottee No, 1 Well, Pre-Middle Silurian or Middle 

Silurian Section 

This section of the core consists of 4 feet of 
dolomitic anhydrite; 199 feet of rock salt; 197 feet of 
anhydritic dolomite, dolomitic anhydrite, salty grey 
dolomite, buff dolomite, maroon splotched dolomite; some 
dolomitic limestone; and 3 feet of rock gypsum. 

1. Environmental Conditions 

These deposits were formed in a lagoonal environment 
along the eastern margin of a sea similar but more drastic 
than that of Ordovician time. Desert conditions are 
conceived and evaporation, concentration, temperature 
changes, and fresh supplies of water were factors in the 
precipitation of dolomitic anhydrite, rock salt, dolomite, 
and dolomitic limestone. As far as the writer is aware 
there is no evidence to support the deposition of primary 
gypsum. 

2. The Concept of Deposition of Saline Residues 

Clark ( 21 ) states that saline constituents deposit 
in reverse order of their solubility when natural water 
is evaporated. In general the order of precipitation is 














;

as follows: 

1. ferric oxide 

2. calcium carbonate 

3. magnesium carbonate 

4. gypsum and anhydrite 

5. sodium sulphate 

6* sodium carbonate 

7. sodium chloride 

8• magne sium sulphate 

9* bitterns 

But sea water has complicating factors. Solubility is 
affected by the presence of other compounds, by concen¬ 
tration of the solution, and by temperature. The more 
complex the constituents of the sea water is, the greater 
are the possibilities of complex compounds precipitating 
out. True also is the fact that if all the calcium is 
used up to form a carbonate no other calcium salts can be 
formed. Similarly if all the sulphate ions are used to 
form gypsum then other sulphates cannot form. 

3. Observations Regarding Saline Deposits in 

Cottee Mo. 1 Well 

The writer ma&es the following observations: 

(1) Microcyrstalline Dolomite 

Microerystalline dolomite occurs throughout the 
colorless crystalline anhydrite in patches giving it the 
colorless and buff mottled effect. Where the anhydrite 
is finely crystalline (626-657 feet, log of Cottee No. 1) 
not only is the dolomite present in buff patches but 















85 


apparently it is disseminated throughout the anhydrite 
to give it a bluish appearance. Vifhere the anhydrite is 
coarsely crystalline and often irregularly ribboned, buff 
microcrystalline aggregated dolomite fills in every 
interstice. Much of this dolomite is grey to green-grey 
and salty. It seems probable that the salt is responsible 
for the dolomite being grey-green instead of the usual 
buff. Where anhydrite is abundant salt with the dolomite 
seems scarce or absent. 

(2) Rock Salt 

The rock salt contacts were irregular but sharp in 
Cottee No. 1. Dolomitic anhydrite exists above and 
below the rock salt section. In the No. 5 Well the same 
set of conditions is present. In the Alberta Government 
No. 1 Well the upper contact is with salty green-grey 
dolomite. The dolomite shows penetrative effect of the 
salt. No complete examination of the 199 feet of salt 
was made, but optical methods revealed that the rock salt 
contained cubic and rectilinear air spaces. 

(3) Dolomitic Red Beds 

From 575 to 530 feet, dolomitic red beds occur at 
intervals in Cottee No. 1 Well. The presence of iron was 
established by the use of potassium ferrocyanide. Some

of these red. beds are red stained throughout while others 
are splotched red or maroon and green-grey. Optical 
examination revealed microcrystalline dolomite but pinkish 
orange or brownish in color. Whether the dolomite was 
stained by iron oxide or whether it is an iron carbonate 
could not be determined on account of microcrystalline 
size of the dolomite. Tests to remove iron oxide stain 
were unsuccessful. On the other hand some satin spar 
veins that pass through these red beds were pinkish. 

This may suggest iron oxide staining. 

Of interest is the occurrence of one dolomitic lime¬ 
stone, maroon colored bed at 571-P75 feet. It is also 
the basal red bed in this well. 

(4) Satin Spar Veining 

Throughout the anhydrite-dolomite-gypsum series 
satin spar veining and satin spar banding parallel to the 
bedding occurs. The association of satin spar veins and 
bands along bedding is with dolomite. The occurrence of 
satin spar with dolomitic anhydrite is apparently rare. 

In many eases a fine dolomitic layer exists between satin 
spar bands and the purer anhydrite beds. Satin spar veins 
and interbands are much more common in the salty grey 
dolomite and in the red beds than in buff dolomite and

dolomitie anhydrite beds. This satin spar veining is 
secondary in its origin. 

(5) Anhydrite Veining 

Anhydrite veining occurs in the Gottee No. 1 Well 
between 513-518 feet. It also occurs in the Nol 3 Well 
at 585 feet and at 589 feet. A + 585 feet these anhydrite 
veins cut through dolomite and an irregular blob of 
anhydrite. At 589 feet anhydrite veins cut through maroon 
and grey splotched dolomite and satin spar veins. The 
anhydrite veining is,- therefore, of secondary origin, 
and post satin spar veining, as well as post dolomite and 
anhydrite deposition. 

(6) Brown Selenite Replacements 

Brown selenite replacements occur in the creamy to 
buff limestone bed at 492-493-J- feet. This lies 
immediately above the rock gypsum contact in the Cottee 
No. 1 Well. These brown selenite platy crystals occur 
in the finely crystalline dolomitie anhydrite below the 
rock gypsum. That is, these crystals are present in the 
upper part of the section 497-506 feet. This same 
phenomenon occurs in the No. 3 Well at 535 feet in finely 
crystalline grey buff anhydrite which is &lso dolomitie. 
The origin of this selenite is secondary.

(7) Rock Gypsum 

Rock gypsxim occurs between 493J-497 feet in the 
Cottee No. 1 Well. The same zone is present in the other 
two wells examined. It is a dark brown crystalline rock. 
Some dolomite is scattered throughout, mi optical exam¬ 
ination showed some of the gypsum to contain anhydrite 
inclusions. In other words* the anhydrite was altering 
to gypsum and consequently the gypsum is of secondary 
origin. 

(8) Limestone and Lolomitic Limestone 

Only three occurrences of dolomitic limestone and 

limestone are present' in the Cottee No. 1 Well. These are 

at the following depths: 

620 - 622 feet (dolomitic limestone) 

571 - 575 feet (reddish dolomitic limestone) 

506 - 507 feet (limestone) 

Only one limestone band is present in Alberta Government 
No. 1 Well. This is at 514-516 feet. It is probable 
that the 514-516 foot bed correlates with the 506-507 
foot band at Cottee No. 1 Well. 

4. Conclusions 

From the above observations the writer draws the 
following conclusions:

1. The environment was one of shallow seas, 
lagoonal embayments, low shoreline, with a paucity of 
clastic sediments from emergent areas nearby. 

2. The source of the ferric oxide is in doubt since 
it is not known whether the red beds are due to iron 
oxide staining or to an iron carbonate microcrystalline 
agglomerate. No elastics bearing iron are present in the 
dolomite. Hence the probability of desert conditions is 
unlikely. A moderately wet climate in lowland regions 
favors the production of ferric oxide, yet the salinity 
of the teas was high for the red beds are salty, anhydritie 
and non-fossiliferous. 

3. According to Clark’s ( 21) concept of deposition 
of saline residues ferric oxide should be the first to 
precipitate. This is not the case in the McMurray area. 

Dolomitic anhydrite and salt precipitate first. The 
full facts are not known however. Wells drilled to the 
west of McMurray might prove to have red beds under the 
salt. On the other hand no red beds are reported below 
the salt at Vermilion, Alberta, and Unity, Saskatchewan. 

4. The maroon do lomitic limestone band between 
571-575 feet would seem to conform to Clark’s concept of 
saline deposition.

5* The remarkable amount of dolomite compared with 
the small amount of limestone is not understood. Practically 
all the anhydrite contains dolomite but no limestone. 

More facts are necessary before the theory of marine 
dolomitization by replacement of calcium carbonate in the 
calcareous ooze on the sea floor by magnesium salts can be 
accepted. 

6. Much of the anhydrite and dolomite seem to be 
intermixed, though clear cut bands of dolomite occur. The 
anhydrite is apparently not free from dolomite. 

7. Secondary anhydrite does occur. 

8. All gypsum determined by the writer in the salt 
wells of the MeMurray area is of secondary origin. Rock 
gypsum occurs only in the uppermost bed, or beds of the 
anhy d rite-dolomite-salt-gyp sum series. 

VII Middle Silurian in Cottee No. 1 Well 

These are the limestone and dolomitic limestone beds 
between 490-493£ feet. These beds are lithologically 
different from the underlying series and from the Water¬ 
ways formation which overlies it. Color, thin platy 

bedding, fracturing, and calcite veining differentiates 
It from them. Fracturing and calcite veining is more 

in evidence in the No. 3 Well and in Alberta

Government No. 1 Well. Color ranges from a distinct 
creamy color to dark brown bituminous stained color* All 
veining examined contained twinned calcite. The remark¬ 
able factor is the lack of gypsum or anhydrite veins in 
these sedmients. 


It was these unusual features that first lead to 
their isolation from both the Waterways and the anhydrite 
dolomite-salt-gypsum series. A survey of the literature 
lead to the tentative assignment of a Guelph (Middle 
Silurian) age on the basis of lithology. The discovery 


found on the Cl ear water 

of a Guelph River east of McMurray has led the writer to 
place these beds in the Middle Silurian. 


1• Environmental Conditions 


One possible environment is that of an erosional 
surface slowly subsiding and being covered by fine 
sediments of a transgressing sea. An exposed surface 
would account for the formation of secondary gypsum Paleo 

Silurian 

geographic evidence suggests that this Middle^Sea came 
down from the north and its known southern limit is 
Waterways.

This limestone is buff-brown colored and speckled 
with jet black scolecodonts or worm jaws. A dwarf fauna 
is also present. Whether it is a youthful fauna or one 
dwarf due to a restrictive environment is not known. A 
fauna consisting of scolecodonts, nautiloids and gas¬ 
tropods is indicative of shallow seas. Scolecodonts, 
generally called conodonts, are usually found at the tops 
and bottoms of beds. These are the basal beds of the 
Waterways. Conodonts are also found at 157-160 feet. 

This is near the base of a limy series which overlies a 
thick bed of green grey calcareous shale. 

8. Calcareous Shale 

Characteristic of the Waterways formation is the 
green-grey calcareous shale. The main beds are indicated 
on Table 1 (pocket). The high calcareous content is 
indicative of a more epicontinental environment. The 
green color is probably due to ferrous iron compounds. 

So glanconite was found, hence the green cannot be 
attributed to it. 

The lower calcareous shale zones are fossiliferous. 
Lingulas , Tentaculite s, Leptodesmas , and fish plates are 
abundant. The upper calcareous shale zone is practically 

barren, (Table 1).

3* Mottled Limestone and Argillaceous Limestone 

Generalized zones of mottled and argillaceous lime¬ 
stone are shown in Table 1* The argillaceous limestone 
contains a greater amount of lime than the calcareous 
shale. 

Mottled limestone is due to several factors. Some 
of these rocks appear as buff limestone patches in green- 
grey calcareous shale. Mottling also occurs when buff 
calcite veinleted lithographic-like limestone appear as 
patches or blobs in argillaceous limestone, Fossiliferous 
limestone gives a mottled appearance. This is probably 
due to organic decay. Brown crystalline limestone is 
mottled due to colorless calcite replacement centres. 

The matrix is buff limestone. 

4. Stylolites 

Much of the mottled limestone is stylolitic. These 
are mostly in the form of vertically striated pyramids 
or cones of various heights, widths and shapes. At the 
apixes of these stylolites, thin deposits occur. These 
were generally along fractures plains. These stylolites 
have been formed subsequent to deposition of the lime¬ 
stone. This is indicated by the formation of thin

deposits along fractures and at the apices of the 
stylolites. The phenomenon seems to he one of solution 
and pressure. Soluble materials are removed by solution. 
This would leave a series of pressure points, teadjust- 
ments in bedding would occur and consequently cause 
vertically striated, conically shaped structures. 
Insoluble material in the soluble parts w'ould escape and 
form the thin bedded deposits along fractures at the 
apices of the stylolites. 

5. Mareasite 

Marcasite is found throughout the Waterways form- 
ation in Cottee No. 1 Well. It occurs as fossil replace¬ 
ments; as veins in the calcareous shale; as disseminated 

grains along stylolitic striations; as the outer coating 

I 

of nodules; and lastly, disseminated throughout the 
calcareous shale in fine grains, twinned aggregates, and 
as arrowhead twins at various horizons. 

As far as could be determined no pyrite is present. 
It all seems to be marcasite. 

The time of origin is subsequent in the case of the 
replaced fossils. It is also subsequent where it is 
found disseminated along stylolitic striae. Veined 
marcasite is also subsequent. Marcasite coated nodules

are present in the same calcareous shale zone as dark 
green shale coated nodules. It is probable that the green 
shale coating has been replaced by marcasite and is thus 
a subsequent process. No evidence was found to determine 
the origin of the disseminated grains, twins, and 
aggregates of marcasite in the calcareous shale. In all 
likelihood it also is subsequent to the deposition of the 
shale. A 6-inch core from Industrial Minerals Limited 
(1938) in the Mineral Museum of the University of Alberta 
was examined by the writer to determine whether the 
abundant iron sulphide was pryrite or marcasite. The 
crystalline structures observed were characteristically 
marcasitic. Tabular crystals; radiating fibrous structures; 
spearhead twinning; arrowhead twinning were observed. On 
a fresh surface the color was somewhat silverish. The 
writer concludes that no pyrite is present in the logs 
of the salt wells observed. 

6. Nodules 

Nodules up to 1£ inches in length and f of an inch 

in thickness occur in the Gottee No. 1 Well at the 

following depths: 

484 feet 
460 feet 
452 feet 


The nodules at 484 feet have a twinned marcasite coating

about a limestone interior. A nodule at 460 feet has a 
somewhat greener calcareous shale coat, but no marcasite. 
Those at 452 feet were coated with green calcareous shale. 
In every case the interior of the nodule consisted of 
limestone with some marcasite grains. Those at 484 and 
460 feet were discoidal and ellipsiodal. That at 452 
feet was bladed and irregular. These structures were 
nodular in that they have no internal design. Rather, 
the design is external. The nodule at 460 feet was 
abundantly covered with Tentaculites. Most of these were 
(in a good state of preservation. This suggests that the 
nodules were interformational, that is, they lie along 
the bedding planes and other sediments were laid down 
about them. The origin was therefore contemporaneous. 

7• Calotte Veining 

Calcite veining was observed between 130*140 feet 
in Cottee No. 1. This calcite had a somewhat sugary 
appearance. The limestone vein and veinlet walls suggested 
ao replacement of the limestone. Optical examination 
revealed twin lamellae on the calcite grains. These 
features suggest cold water calcite deposition and hence 
nay be classed as epithermal.

Trochiliscids occur from 294-304 feet in the 

Gottee No. 1 Well in mottled, limestone. These occur at 

two horizons in the Alberta Government Well No. 1, namely, 

292 - 296 feet (calcareous shale) 

170 feet (calcareous shale) 

In the No. 3 Well, Trochiliscids occur at 340 feet in 

calcareous green-grey shale. Probably the 294-304, 

292-296, and the 340-foot horizons correlate, (see Table 

1 ). 


According to Peck (55) these fossil oogonia are 
abundant in the ^pper Devonian and Middle Devonian of 
North America. They occur in calcareous shales and In 
fresh water limestones or near fresh water limestones. 
The environmental picture at Waterways would probably be 
one in which these oogonia developed in a fresh water 
region such as at a river mouth and later have been 
rafted out into the limy sea by tide, current, or wave 
action.
