THE EFFECTS OF LIMITING IONS ON THE ABSORPTION 


OF NUTRIENTS BY WHEAT 


Dyson Rose 


INTRODUCTION 


A partial or complete lack of any one nutrient 
required by a plant may have considerable effect on the 
growth and development of that plant. It is reasonable to 
assume that these changes in gro?/th and development are 
accompanied by correspondingly definite changes in the in¬ 
ternal metabolism of the plant and that such changes may 
result in, or be reflected in, an altered absorbing power of 
the plant for other nutrients. 

Woodford and McCalla (17) working at this institu¬ 
tion in 1934 found that wheat plants growing on a gray 
wooded soil in which nitrogen and sulphur were low, absorbed 
a greeter amount of phosphorus than did similar plants grow¬ 
ing on fertile black loam. These workers concluded from the 
analysis of the soils that this increased absorption of 
phosphorus was due to the effect of the low nitrogen supply 
on the metabolism of the plant rather than to any difference 
in the availability of phosphorus in the two soils.

These results were checked by the use of care¬ 
fully controlled water culture experiments and it was found 
(8) that phosphorus was again absorbed in greater quan¬ 
tities when the nitrogen supply was limited. 

The plants were analysed for the six main 
nutrients in both the above experiments and it was found 
that a more general conclusion could be drawn, viz,, that 
the high phosphorus content of the plants grown under con¬ 
ditions where nitrogen was limiting probably resulted from 
influences controlling the anion:cation balance within the 
plant. 

This conclusion was further checked by replicated 
experiments, which included low calcium cultures, in 1938 
(15). The limitation of nitrogen in the culture solutions 
again resulted in an increased phosphorus absorption, and 
also caused potassium to be absorbed in smaller amounts. 

The influence of the calcium limitation was shown by an 
increased magnesium absorption. Neither the limitation of 
nitrogen nor the limitation of calcium resulted in a signi¬ 
ficant variation in the anion:cation ratio. 

The experiments reported in this thesis are an 
extension of the study of the anion:cation balance. The 
results show the effects of the limitation of nitrogen and 
potassium, and of potassium and calcium, alone and in com¬ 


bination

LITERATURE REVIEW 


Many workers have studied the effects of the 
supply of one nutrient on the absorption of other nutrients, 
and both soil and water cultures have been used. 

Soil is normally an infinitely complex medium for 
the growth of plants and many interactions affecting the 
solubility and availability of the nutrients may occur within 
it. For this reason it is difficult to draw any conclusions 
regarding the absorbing power of a plant from experiments 
with soil-grown plants unless the elements being studied are 
very limiting. Even then the conclusions will be confused 
by the effects of elements not included in the analysis. 

Water culture experiments are an excellent means 
of studying the effects of the supply of one nutrient on 
the absorption of others and have been used extensively. 

Few workers in this field have conducted sufficiently com¬ 
plete analyses of the plants to allow a study of the anion: 
cation ratio to be made, but many of the results presented 
showing the effects of the supply of one nutrient on the 
absorption of some one or two other nutrients are entirely 

compatible with the hypothesis of a constant anion:cation 

a 

balance. 

Lundegardh (7) has found that under conditions of 
limited potassium supply, an increased absorption of calcium, 
magnesium and sodium occurred. Under conditions of limited

nitrogen supply, phosphorus absorption was apparently not af- 
feoted, but potassium absorption was much reduced. Both of 
these effects would tend to keep the anion:cation balance at 
a constant level. 

Gericke (2) grew wheat seedlings in single salt 
solutions, supplying all the essential elements by moving 
the plants from one to another solution. From the growth 
responses of the plants, it was concluded that nitrate absorp¬ 
tion was greatly limited unless potassium was present in the 
solution. 

Beckenbach et al (1) have studied the absorption 
by corn plants under conditions of varying nutrient concen¬ 
trations and maintain that: the nitrogen content of the 
plants v/as directly related to the potassium and calcium 
concentrations in the substrate; the potassium content of 
the plants was inversely related to the nitrate and calcium 
concentrations in the substrate; and the magnesium content 
of the plants was directly related to the nitrate and calcium 
concentrations in the substrate. 

Hurd-Karrer (6) has been able to show very definite 
relations between the absorption of pairs of ions which are 
chemically similar, such as sulphur and selenium, phosphorus 
and arsenic, potassium and rubidium, and calcium and strontium. 
One of the ions in each of these pairs is toxic to plants in 
relatively low concentrations, but it is possible that such 
relations may have a more general application.

Nightingale ejt al (10) have grown tomato plants 
in solutions low in calcium and nitrogen. The data pre¬ 
sented do not include the effects of the nitrate limitation 
but do show an increased potassium absorption by plants 
growing in the low calcium solutions. The limitation of 
calcium did not, however, increase the absorption of mag¬ 
nesium. 

Somewhat similar results have been obtained from 
experiments conducted under a wide range of conditions and 
by many workers. In general, it appears that the limitation 
of an anion results in an increased absorption of other 
anions, or in a decreased absorption of the cations; and 
that the limitation of a cation results in an increased up¬ 
take of the other cations or, more rarely, in a decreased 
absorption of anions. All of these effects would tend to 
maintain a relatively constant anion:cation balance. 

MATERIA IS AND METHODS 


The experiments described in this thesis were 
carried out during the summers of 1939 and 1940. Wheat, 
variety Red Bobs, was germinated on screens using essen¬ 
tially the method of Hoagland and Broyer (5) except that a 
nutrient solution rather than distilled water was used in 
the trays.

While in the single leaf stage, i.e., when from 
six to eight days old, the seedlings were set out in complete 
solutions in two-gallon glazed earthenware crooks. Sheet 
iron lids were perforated with eight holes and corks inserted, 
the plants being wadded into single holes in the corks with 
non-absorbent cotton. Seven plants were grown in each two- 
gallon crock. 

A carborundum aerator was inserted through the 
extra hole in the lid for a short period each day and 
vigorous aeration carried out. This hole was kept corked 
except while aeration was in progress. 

The young plants were grown in complete solutions 
far two weeks following transfer from the germination screen. 
These solutions were then replaced by the experimental solu¬ 
tions and after a further two-week period the plants were 
collected for analysis. 

The crocks were placed in rows of five on the 
greenhouse bench and the five crocks of each row were treated 
alike. Tippet’s Random Sampling Numbers (16) were used to 
determine the order of the treatments on the bench. 

The solutions used were based on Hoagland’s solu¬ 
tion, but are only half the strength of the original 
solution. In 1939, nitrogen and potassium were limited, the 
limiting solutions containing one-quarter, one-tenth or one- 
fortieth of the amounts of these elements present in the 
complete solution. A set of sixteen solutions thus gave all

the possible combinations of these concentrations of 
nitrogen and potassium. In 1940, potassium and calcium were 
limited, a similar set of sixteen solutions being used. 

The limited nutrients were compensated for by a 
chemically equivalent amount of another nutrient so that the 
molar concentration of the solutions did not vary. Nitrogen 
was compensated for by phosphorus, potassium in 1939 by 
calcium, and both potassium and calcium in 1940 by magnesium. 
The composition of these solutions is given in Tables I and 
II, as millilitres of molar stock solution per litre of cul¬ 
ture solution. In addition, each solution received one 
millilitre of Hoagland f s "A-Z" solution (4) per litre, and 
one millilitre of one-half percent iron tartrate solution 
per litre every other day. 

The limited salts were added in small amounts on 
alternate days, the amounts shown in Tables I and II being 
the total amounts added. The plants thus had a limited 
amount of these nutrients throughout the two-week period 
rather than a complete lack of them after the solutions 
became depleted. 

Difficulty was anticipated in the 1940 series due 
to the high concentrations of magnesium developed in the 
solutions which were low in potassium and calcium. It was 
found, however, that after three weeks in complete solutions 
the plants were able to withstand even the highest concentra¬ 
tions of magnesium for the two-week period. Some symptoms

of injury did appear but these were considered to be trace¬ 
able to a deficiency of potassium as much as to an excess 
of magnesium. 

Three series were grown each year and are con¬ 
sidered as replicates. Each series was randomized separately 
so that they were suitable for use in statistical analysis 
but, since they were grown at different periods during the 
summer, the variance due to replicate or series is abnormally 
great. 


Chemical Methods 


Dry Matters 

The complete plants were weighed while fresh, 
the roots having been freed from excess solution by gentle 
squeezing by hand. They were then dried in an air-blast 
oven at 40° to 50°C. until sufficiently dry to grind in a 
Wiley mill. The remaining moisture was then determined by 
drying small samples at 105°C. for one hour. The percentage 
dry matter was calculated from these two results. 

Nitrogen 

Nitrogen was determined by the reduced iron 
method of Pucher ejt aJL (11) to include nitrate nitrogen. 

Ash 

Samples of approximately two grams were ashed at

600°C. for six hours. The ash was extracted with hot, 
dilute hydrochloric aoid, filtered, and the filtrate made 
up to a volume of one hundred millilitres. Aliquots of 
this solution were used for the determination of calcium, 
magnesium, phosphorus and potassium. 

Phosphorus 

Phosphorus was precipitated as ammonium phospho- 
molybdate, dissolved in excess 0.1 N sodium hydroxide and 
titrated with 0.1 N sulphuric acid, using phenolphthalien 
as the indicator. 

Sulphur 

Sulphur was determined by the official A.O.A.C. 
sodium peroxide method (9). 

Potassium 

Potassium was precipitated with sodium cobalti- 
nitrite and the precipitate titrated with N/20 potassium 
permanganate. Details of this procedure are described by 
Hibbard and Stout (2). 

Calcium 

Calcium was precipitated as the oxalate and 
titrated with H/20 potassium permanganate. 

Magnesium 

Magnesium was determined by a modification of the 
8 -hydroxyquinoline method of Redmond and Bright (14).

Statistical Method 


All of the data were treated statistically by 
the analysis of varianoe method. Tables of three series by 
sixteen treatments (total degrees freedom = 47) were set 
up and the significance of the variance due to each factor 
was determined. 

REACTION OF THE CULTURE SOLUTION 


In 1939 the reaction of the limited nitrogen 
solutions was distinctly acid, having a pH of approximately 
4.0 as compared with a pH of 6.2 for the complete nitrogen 
solutions. The reaction of these solutions remained rela¬ 
tively constant throughout the two-week period. 

In 1940 the reaction of the limited solutions 
was very close to that of the complete solution. All the 
solutions had a pH of approximately 6.2 at the beginning 
and rose to nearly 7.0 at the end of the two-week period. 

An attempt was made in 1939 to maintain a complete 
solution at a pH of 3.5 to 4.0 by adding the necessary 
amount of phosphoric acid. Whi.le not conclusive, the 
results of this one trial indicated that the reaction of 
the solution had only a minor influence on absorption over 
the two-week period. The analyses of the plants from the

acidic complete solution gave results which differed little 
from those obtained from the analyses of the plants from 
the neutral complete solution. 

The limited solutions, whether they contained 
1/4, 1/10 or 1/40 the nitrogen of the oomplete solution, all 
had a pH of approximately 4. On the basis of reaction, 
therefore, the solutions can be divided into only two classes, 
while in the statistical treatment they were divided into 
four. The effect of the reaction on absorption would thus 
tend to mask rather than to increase the significance of the 
results attributed to nitrogen limitation. The reaction of 
the nutrient solution cannot be considered a dominant fac¬ 
tor influencing absorption in these experiments. 

RESULTS, 1939 


Dry Weights of Plants 


The mean total dry weights of the plants are 
given in Tables III and the results for the analyses of 
these data in Table IY. 

These results show that the growth of the plants 
was significantly reduced by the limitation of both nitrogen 
and potassium during the period when the solutions were 
limited (two weeks). It had been hoped that the reduction

in growth could be made very slight by allowing the plants to 
grow in complete solutions for an initial period. Since this 
was not possible, the reduced size of the plants must be 
considered in discussing the results. 

The variation in the size of the plants of the dif¬ 
ferent series is due to the faot that they were grown at 
different periods during the summer. This variation between 
series is significant in most oases throughout the results 
but will not be discussed further since it is of no particu¬ 
lar importance in the interpretation of the results. 

Percentage Data 


The mean percentages of the nutrients in the dry 
matter are given in Table V and the results of the analysis 
of variance of these data are given as the mean squares in 
Table VI. 

The increases in the percentages of calcium and 
magnesium in the dry matter due to potassium limitation are 
quite definite, but none of the anions shews a significant 
variation due to this factor. The limitation of nitrogen, 
on the other hand, caused a decrease in the percentage of 
calcium and an increase in the percentage of potassium as 
well as an increase in the percentage of the two anions, 
phosphorus and sulphur.

Absorption per Plant Data 


Sinoe the growth of the plants was affected by 
the treatments, it was deemed advisable to study the absorp¬ 
tion on a per plant basis. This problem has been discussed 
by McCalla and Woodford (8). 

The mean content in milli-equivalents per plant 
is presented in Table VII, and the results of the analysis 
of variance of this data in Table VIII. 

As would be expected, these results show that 
the smaller plants of the low nitrogen treatments contained 
a smaller amount of most of the nutrients. In the case of 
phosphorus, however, the increased rate of absorption off¬ 
set the effect of lesser growth so that a significant 
increase in the phosphorus content resulted. 

Similarly, the somewhat smaller plants of the low 
potassium treatments contained less of four of the nutrients. 
The rate of calcium absorption was increased by the potas¬ 
sium limitation to such an extent that an increase in the 
amount contained per plant resulted. The rate of magnesium 
absorption was also increased and no decrease in the amount 
contained per plant occurred. In fact, a slight but not 
significant increase is apparent. 

Although the percentage of potassium in the dry 
matter increased with the limitation of nitrogen, the

milli-equivalents per plant decreased. It is therefore 
very probable that the increased percentage is due to the 
reduced growth of the plants and not to an increased absorp¬ 
tion of potassium. In a previous experiment (15) it was 
found that the limitation of nitrogen decreased the potas¬ 
sium absorption, and while such a decrease in potassium 
absorption is not shown by the results of this experiment 
the data are not contrary to the conclusions reached at 
that time. This question is dealt with more thoroughly in 
the discussion. 

The decrease in calcium absorption when nitrogen 
was limited is shown both by the percentage and the milli- 
equivalents per plant and cannot be entirely due to the 
decreased growth of the plants. 

Ion Ratios 


The ratios of the limited ions to each of the 
other ions were calculated from the milli-equivalents per 
plant^data. The mean values for these ratios are pre¬ 
sented in Table IX, and the results of the analysis of 
variance in Table X. 

The decreases in the N:P and U:S ratios when 
nitrogen was limited are due partly to an increase in the 
phosphorus and sulphur contents and partly to a decrease

in the nitrogen content of the plants. The decreased nitro¬ 
gen content has also resulted in a decrease in the N:K 
ratio. The decreases in the K:P and K:S ratios are largely 
due to the increased phosphorus and sulphur content, and 
the increases in the K:Ca and K:Mg ratios are due to the 
decreased calcium and magnesium content of the plants. 
Potassium content was decreased slightly but probably not 
sufficiently to affect any of the ratios significantly. 

The decreases in the N:Ca and N:Mg ratios when 
potassium was limited are apparently due to the increased 
calcium and magnesium oontent as the nitrogen content was 
only slightly reduced. This increase in the magnesium con¬ 
tent of the plants was insufficient to be significant in 
the analysis of the milli-equivalents per plant, but is 
probably quite real, nevertheless. 

The decreases in the K:N, K:P, K:S, K:Ca and K:Mg 
ratios when potassium was limited are largely due to the 
decreased potassium content of the plants. The analyses 
of the milli-equivalents per plant show a decrease in the 
nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur content, but the potassium 
content was decreased so greatly that these ratios are also 
decreased. The increased calcium and magnesium contents 
contribute to the decreases shown by the K:Ca and K:Mg 
ratios. The increased N:K ratio is due to the decreased 
potassium content, the decrease in the nitrogen content 
being small in comparison.

that the regression within groups was very significantly 
different from the regression between groups. Individual 
data cannot, therefore, be used in a single correlation 
analysis. 

These correlations verify the conclusion that the 
limitation of potassium led to an increase in the absorp¬ 
tion of calcium and of magnesium. The high positive cor¬ 
relation betv/een calcium and magnesium is largely due to 
the similar effect of potassium limitation on each of them 
and disappears when the effect of potassium is eliminated. 
The multiple correlation coefficient is not significantly 
larger than the simple correlation coefficients, indicating 
that the same factor influences the absorption of calcium 
and magnesium. 

The interpretation of the correlations between 
anions is similar. Nitrogen limitation had a similar 
effect on the absorption of phosphorus and of sulphur, and 
a positive correlation between these two ions results. 

This correlation coefficient is much lower when the effect 
of nitrogen is eliminated but is still significant, and 
probably indicates a similar action of external factors on 
the absorption of these two nutrients. A positive correla¬ 
tion between pairs of nutrients would result if the plants 
were all grown in complete solutions but subjected to dif¬ 
ferences in growing conditions as most environmental 
conditions affect the absorption of all elements somewhat

similarly. It is this tendency toward a positive correla¬ 
tion due to the environmental conditions that makes the 
individual data unsuitable for calculating correlation 
coefficients. 

The partial coefficients for correlations between 
potassium and calcium absorption, and between potassium and 
magnesium absorption are lower than the corresponding 
simple correlation coefficients. It is biologically impos¬ 
sible to limit the potassium supply without affecting the 
absorption of both calcium and magnesium, so these partial 
correlation coefficients represent a statistical considera¬ 
tion only and cannot be given a biological interpretation. 

Similarly the partial coefficients for correla¬ 
tions between nitrogen and phosphorus, and between nitrogen 
and sulphur are not biologically significant as nitrogen 
is the only independent variable and both phosphorus and 
sulphur absorption increase whenever nitrogen is limited.

RESULTS, 1940 


Dry Weights of Plants 


The mean dry weights of the plants are presented 
in Table XII, and the results of the analysis of variance 
of these results in Table XIII. 

The variations between series are high as in 1939 
and are again due to differences in the environmental condi¬ 
tions as the series were grown at different periods through¬ 
out the summer. 

These results show that during the two-week 
period, while the plants were in limited solutions, the 
reduction in growth due to calcium limitation was not great 
enough to be significant. It is very probable that a sig¬ 
nificant reduction in growth would have occurred had the 
plants been grown in low calcium solutions for a longer 
period. The limitation of potassium even for the two-week 
period was sufficient to reduce the growth of the plants, 
as was the case in 1939.

Percentage Data 


The mean percentages of the nutrients in the dry 
matter are presented in Table XTV and the results of the 
analysis of variance of these results in Table XV. 

The limitation of either potassium or calcium 
resulted in an increased percentage of the other cation, 
magnesium, in the dry matter. The anion absorption was also 
affected by the limitation of these two cations, the per¬ 
centage nitrogen being reduced by potassium limitation and 
the percentage nitrogen and phosphorus being reduced by 
calcium limitation. The effect of potassium limitation on 
phosphorus absorption was affected by the calcium level 
and the interaction between the treatments is significant 


in this one case

Absorption per Plant Data 


The mean content per plant for all three series 
is given in milli-equivalents in Table XVI, and the results 
of the analyses of variance of these results, in Table 
XVII. 

The limitation of potassium in the solutions 
resulted in a decreased growth of the plants and, hence, 
the milli-equivalents per plant of nitrogen, phosphorus 
and sulphur, as well as of potassium, were reduced. The 
increased absorption of calcium and magnesium was suffi¬ 
cient to offset this effect and the milli-equivalents per 
plant did not vary significantly. 

The limitation of calcium in the solution for 
two weeks did not significantly affect the dry weights of 
the plants but it did decrease the amounts of calcium, 
nitrogen and phosphorus absorbed by the plants. The in¬ 
creased absorption of magnesium resulted in a higher mag¬ 
nesium content per plant.

Ion Ratios 


The mean values for the ratios of nitrogen and 
potassium to the other nutrients are given in Table XVIII, 
and the results of the analyses of variance of these 
results in Table XIX. 

The limitation of potassium in the solutions 
resulted in a lower potassium content per plant and all the 
ratios in which potassium is the numerator are, therefore, 
decreased. Potassium limitation also resulted in a decrease 
in the milli-equivalents of nitrogen per plant and so the 
N:S and N:Mg ratios are also decreased. The variability 
of the N:P and N:Ca ratios is great and the effect of the 
reduced nitrogen content per plant on these ratios is not 
significant. 

The calcium content per plant was decreased by 
the limitation of calcium in the solutions and this 
resulted in an increase in the K:Ca and N:Ca ratios. The 
calcium treatments also had a significant effect on the 
F:Mg and K:Mg ratios due to the increased magnesium and 
decreased nitrogen absorption.

These correlation coefficients were calculated 
on the treatment totals as were those for the 1939 data. 

Two cations were limited in these experiments 
and so a negative correlation occurs with any pair of 
cations, but since both potassium and calcium were limited

in many of the solutions the normal effect of one on the 
absorption of the other was obscured. The partial correla¬ 
tion coefficients are higher than the corresponding simple 
correlation coefficients, especially in the case of the 
correlation between potassium and calcium, but these 
increases probably have little biological significance 
since the limitation of one of these elements affects the 
absorption of both the others. 

The high positive coefficient for the correlation 
between potassium and nitrogen absorption is considered in 
the discussion. The correlation between nitrogen and phos¬ 
phorus may be due partly to the variations caused by envi¬ 
ronmental factors and partly to a similar effect of potas¬ 
sium limitation on both of them, although the correlation 
between potassium and phosphorus is not significant. An 
analysis of covariance will be necessary before these data 
can be interpreted completely. 

THE ANTON:CATION RATIOS 


The ratios of the total anions to the total 
cations per plant (i.e. N + P + S : K + Ca+ Mg) were deter¬ 
mined and analysed statistically. The mean values of these 
ratios are given, for each year, in Table XXI, and the mean 
squares for the analyses of variance in Table XXII. 

Neither the limitation of the nitrogen in 1939, 
nor of calcium in 1940 had a significant effect on this

in an increase in this ratio in both years but the increase 
was not nronortional to the decided decrease in the potas¬ 
sium content of the plants.

DISCUSSION 


The data presented In this neper show that; the 
limitation of one nutrient may, under these conditions, 
have a marked effect on the absorption of other nutrients. 

It has been suggested by workers at this institution (8) 
that these effects are due, in part at least, to an attempt 
on the part of the plant to maintain a constant anion: 
cation balance within itself. 

The anion:cation balance within a plant may be 
maintained, when some nutrient is limited, either by an 
increased absorption of like ions or by a decreased absorp¬ 
tion of ions of the opposite charge, or by both of these 
means operating together. The author believes that most 
of the results presented in this paper can be explained on 
this basis. 

In the 1939 experiments the limitation of nitro¬ 
gen resulted in an increase in the percentages of both 
the other anions, phosphorus and sulphur. The absorption 
of phosphorus was increased to such an extent that the 
total phosphorus per plant increased in spite of the marked 
decrease in the growth of the plants. The limited amount 
of nitrogen supplied to these plants also resulted in a 
decreased total absorption of calcium and magnesium, although 
the reduction in the growth of the plants was sufficient to

keep the percentage of these nutrients in the dry matter 
relatively constant. The increases in the K:Ca and K:Mg 
ratios due to nitrogen limitation are a further indication 
of the decreased absorption of these two nutrients. 

In the 1940 experiments the limitation of cal¬ 
cium caused the plants to absorb more magnesium and less 
nitrogen and phosphorus. These results are shown both by 
the percentages of these nutrients in the dry matter and 
by the milli-equivalents per plant, and also by the lower¬ 
ing of the N:Mg ratio. 

The effects of the limitation of potassium, in 
both years, can be explained on the same basis although in 
this case the constant anion:cation balance was not main¬ 
tained. In the 1939 experiments the absorption of both 
calcium and magnesium was increased by potassium limitation 
although the increase in magnesium absorption is slight 
and is significant only for the percentage data. In the 
1940 experiments the limitation of potassium resulted in 
an increase in the percentage of magnesium and a decrease 
in the percentage of phosphorus in the dry matter, and in 
a decrease in both the percentage and total nitrogen absorp¬ 
tion. 

The failure of the plants to absorb anions and 
cations in a constant ratio when potassium was limited 
indicates that anion absorption is more independent of 
cations than cation absorption is of anions. It is probable

that the constant anion:cat!on balanoe is maintained in the 
plant so that no accumulation of charge occurs, but that 
the phenomenon of ion exchange favors anion absorption so 
that the ratio is not one to one. Thus, the exchange of 
bicarbonate or other negative ions for a nutrient anion 
allows absorption of these anions independently without the 
accumulation of a charge. When potassium is limited it is 
apparently possible for the proportion of absorption taking 
place by means of ion exchange to increase and so the anion 
cation ratio also increases. The fact that the limitation 
of potassium did decrease nitrogen absorption indicates 
that this increase in the amount of ion exchange occurring 
does not take place readily, or that it can occur only to 
a limited extent. 

There is no cation which is commonly excreted 
from the roots as is the bicarbonate ion, and so cation 
absorption by means of ion exchange cannot occur. When 
the supply of an anion is limited cation absorption cannot 
continue in excess of anion absorption without the accumu¬ 
lation of a charge and is therefore curtailed. The anion: 
cation ratio is thus maintained at a relatively constant 
level. 

It is interesting to note that the unsuitability 
of the ammonium ion as a nutrient may be related to this 
phenomenon. If nitrogen is absorbed as a cation the anion: 
cation ratio would tend to become less than one; but this

is not possible without an exchange of cations. The absorp¬ 
tion of the cations would, therefore, be limited by the 
amount of the anions, phosphorus and sulphur, which could 
be absorbed. Under these conditions it is conceivable that 
the absorption of the cations, especially of ammonia and 
potassium, might be so curtailed that the development of 
the plant would be hindered. 

Throughout these experiments two nutrients have 
been limited concurrently and hence the effects of the 
limitation of one of these on the absorption of the other 
are obscured. Thus the increased absorption of calcium due 
to potassium limitation occurred only in 1939, and did not 
occur in 1940 when many of the solutions had only a limited 
calcium supply. Similarly the decreased absorption of 
nitrogen when potassium was limited is shown by the data 
only when one of these nutrients was limited in the solu¬ 
tions and is not shown by the 1939 results. 

In almost every case, the effect of one limited 
ion was independent of the amount of the other limited ion 
present in the solutions. In the analysis of the K:P ratio 
(Table X) , the N:l'g ratio (Table XIX), and of the percentage 
P 2 0 5 (Table XV), however, the interactions are significant. 
The ratios were calculated on the milli-equivalents per 
plant and, as is shown by Table VIII, potassium limitation 
decreased the phosphorus content per plant though the effect 
was much smaller than the increase due to nitrogen limitation.

Hence, the effect of potassium on the K:P ratio was less 
when phosphorus was high due to the low nitrogen supply. 
The interaction shown by the NsMg ratio can he explained 
similarly as the limitation of potassium affected the 
nitrogen content of the plants to a much greater extent 
than did the limitation of calcium. The interaction 
between potassium and calcium treatments on the percentage 
phosphorus can be attributed to the high figures for the 
1/10 K: Complete Ca and 1/40 K: Complete Ca solutions 
(Table XIV) and is orobably not significant from a biolo¬ 
gical point of view. 

The correlation coefficients between the per¬ 
centages of nitrogen and potassium in the dry matter were 
particularly high if only one of these nutrients was 
limited. It is possible that some direct relation between 
the absorption of these two nutrients exists, as suggested 
by Gericke (2). It seems more probable, hoy/ever, that this 
close correlation between nitrogen and potassium absorp¬ 
tion is a manifestation of the more general relation 
between the anions and cations. These two nutrients are 
absorbed in larger quantities than the other nutrient ions 
and it is to be expected, therefore, that an anion:cation 
balance will depend largely on a nitrogen:potassium 
balance. The N:K ratio did not, hov:ever, remain constant 
in spite of nitrogen limitation as did the anion:cation 
ratio, so it may be concluded that the latter is the more

fundamental relationship. 

A complete agreement between our results and 
those of Beckenbach et al (1) is not to be expected as 
these workers used excesses rather than deficiencies of 
the nutrients and did not include all possible combinations 
of the concentration used. The behavior of plants may be 
different under these conditions. Moreover, the statistical 
method used by these workers requires the elimination of 
so many independent variables that the significance of the 
net regression curves based on sixteen treatments becomes 
questionable. Unless an analysis of covariance has shown 
a uniform regression within and between the triplicate 
cultures, the use of the individual data for calculating 
the net regression curves cannot be justified. The data 
presented by these workers do not allow an accurate cal¬ 
culation of the anion:cation ratio, but a study of their 
results does not indicate that any great variation in this 
ratio occurred, and it is probable 'Chat the forces control¬ 
ling the anion:cation balance contributed to most if not 
all of the effects observed by these workers. 

CONCLUSION 


In the light of the data presented in this thesis 
it is necessary to modify slightly our suggestion that 
plants tend to maintain a constant anion:cation balance

within themselves. The anion:cation ratio is maintained 
when an anion is limited as cation absorption cannot con¬ 
tinue independently of anion absorotion. When a oetion 
normally absorbed in large quantities is limited the anion: 
cation ratio increases as anion absorption, though limited 
to some extent, continues in excess of the cation absorp¬ 
tion . 

This excess absorption of anions over the absorp¬ 
tion of cations is made possible by the exchange of bicarbonate 
or other negative ions for the nutrient anions. No such 
ion exchange is nossible in the case of the cations, so 
cation absorption cannot occur in excess of anion absorp¬ 
tion. The anion:cation ratio is greater than one in the 
majority of the cases studied, so a considerable amount of 
anion exchange must normally occur, but this amount is 
relatively constant and is only increased when cation absorp¬ 
tion is decidedljr limited.

limitation of nitrogen and of ootassium under the conditions 
used. 

2. Plants grown in the lo 7 / nitrogen solutions con¬ 

tained more phosnhorus and less of each of the other 
nutrients than did plants grown in complete solutions. 

4. When nitrogen and potassium were limited, the 
plants grown in low potassium solutions contained more cal¬ 
cium and less of each of the other nutrients than did 
plants from complete solutions. 

5. When potassium and calcium were limited, the 
plants grown in low potassium solutions contained less of 
each of the nutrients except calcium and magnesium than 
did the plants grown in complete solutions. These two 
elements were absorbed in approximately equal amounts 

by plants in the complete and low potassium solutions in 
spite of the reduced growth when potassium was limiting. 

6. Plants grown in the low calcium solutions con¬ 
tained more magnesium, similar amounts of potassium, and 
sulphur, and less of the other nutrients than did the 
plants grown in complete solutions. 

7. Neither the limitation of nitrogen nor of cal¬ 
cium affected the anion:cation ratio within the plants. 

The limitation of potassium did significantly affect this 
ratio although the decreased absorption of potassium was

partly offset by the increased absorption of calcium and 
the decreased absorption of nitrogen. 

8. It is suggested that this failure to maintain 

the constant anion:cation balance when potassium was limited 
may be due to the ability of the plant to absorb anions by 
ionic exchange, the bicarbonate ion being especially signi¬ 
ficant in this regard.
