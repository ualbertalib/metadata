PREFACE 


At the beginning of the academic year 1932, 

Pr. J. A. Allan of the University of Alberta suggested, 
as a sabject for a thesis, the application of a micro¬ 
scopic technique to the ores of G-reat Bear lake, for 
the identification of the minerals, The writer, pleased 
with the suggestion, commenced work immediately and 
’^combed” fairly thoroughly the available literature 
with an endeavor to find the most convenient and satis¬ 
factory methods of microscopic technique which could 
be employed at the University of Alberta. The methods 
of preparing the specimens, of applying the reagents, 
and of applying physical tests which were used with 
fair success, are included in the appendix to this 
thesis. 


In the investigation of G-reat Bear lake ores, 
particular attention was given to the determination of 
the minerals, their mode of occurrence and their age 
relationships. In the identification of the minerals, 
the deteiminative tables of M, U. Short of Harvard Uni¬ 
versity were followed. These tables, which have firmly 
established a definite, rapid and simple method of de¬ 
termining unknown minerals, were published in Short’s 
"Microscopic Petermination of the Ore Minerals" in 1931. 

The writer wishes to express his especial in¬ 
debtedness to Pr. J. A, Allan, who kindly criticized 
the work as it progressed, to Pr. P, S. Warren for ex¬ 
cellent suggestions regarding the arrangement of the 
work and to Pr. R. L, Rutherford for criticisms and 
material aid throughout. 

The Mining Pepartment kindly offered the use 
of their polishing wheels and photomicrographic equip¬ 
ment. Pr, A. S, Cameron gave many helpful suggestions 
regarding the photography. 

The majority of the specimens studied were 
from a collection by Pr. A. S. Cameron and were loaned 
to the writer by the Pepartment of G-eology.

IFVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 


INTRODUCTION. 

The discovery in 1930 of a pitchblende-silver 
occarrence on Echo Bay in the Great Bear lake area 
has aroused keen public interest and because of its 
unique character on this continent, geologists are 
watching development with particular concern. 

In 1931 representatives of small syndicates, as 
well as larger companies constituted a prospectors* 
rush into the area and many claims were staked within 
a few miles of the discovery on Echo Bay. In 1932 many 
more syndicates were formed and by August of that year 
about 200 traders, prospectors, geologists and mining 
engineers were in the area. The writer, employed by 
the Contact Lake Mining Company, was among these, spend¬ 
ing about six months, beginning March 17, 1932, in the 
district. Having thus had an intimate knowledge of 
several of the mineral occurrences, it was thought pro¬ 
fitable to study certain of the ores microscopically 
with an endeavour to determine their composition and

mineral relationships. 

Great Bear lake lies partially within the Arctic 
circle and is about 150 miles east of the Mackenzie river. 
The pitchblende and silver discoveries are on the east 
shore in the vicinity of Echo Bay which is about thirty- 
five miles south of the Arctic circle. La Bine point on 
Echo Bay is about 900 miles north of McMurray by air route 
or 1400 miles from Waterways by water route via Mackenzie 
river. Fort Norman and Great Bear river. Boats can travel 
on Great Bear lake in August and September. Planes run 
from December till the latter part of March and from the 
latter part of June until September. The only means of 
communication with the outside world in other months is 
by wireless* 

The mineralized area lies in the Coronation Mining 
Division in the District of Mackenzie, North ?/est Ter¬ 
ritories. The office of the Mining Recorder for the 
district is located in the Administration Building at 
Fort Smith. Sub-mining recorders have been appointed 
and located at Resolution, Echo Bay, Simpson, Aklavik 
and Coronation.

INVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 

GEOLOGY OF THE ECHO BAY AREA. 

PREVIOUS WORK. 

As early as 1901 J.M. Bell(l) reported cobalt bloom 
on the east coast of Great Bear lake. In 1930 follow¬ 
ing the discovery of pitchblende and silver, C.W. Knight 
(2) investigated the geology of the Echo Bay Area. In 
1931, J.P. Norrie(3) of the Dominion Explorers, G.G. 
Duincan(4) of the N.A.M.E., D.F. Kidd(6)(7) of the Canada 
Geological Survey and H.S. Spence(5)(8) of the Canada 
Mines Branch, published the results of their investiga¬ 
tions in the area. In 1932 more detailed articles on 
the geology and mineralogy were published by D.F. Kidd 
(9)(14) J.A. R'SeddO), H.S. Spence (11) (15) (19) Ellis 
Thompson( 18), H.V. Ellsworth(17 ) and A.E. Cameron(12) 

(13) (16). In 1933 C. Palache and H. Berman(20) pub¬ 
lished the results of optical investigations of the 
oxidation products of pitchblende.

INVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 


GENERAL GEOLOGY OF THE AREA. 


In the area under consideration and shown on Plate 
III there are three main rock groups, all of which are 
probably Precambrian in Age. These, in descending 
chronological order, are: 

Basic dykes and sills, and large quartz veins. 

' Granitic and related intrusives. 

Folded sediments and volcanics. 

The folded sediments and volcanics which are the 
most abundant rocks in the area, consist of tuffs, con¬ 
glomerates, sandstones, quartzites, agglomerates, flows, 
sediments of volcanic origin, cherts, lean iron forma¬ 
tion, limestone and dolomite. This rock group extends 
for six miles south and forty miles north of the pitch¬ 
blende and silver deposits. 

The southern part of this exposure is shown in con¬ 
tact with granitic and other intrusive rocks on the ac¬ 
companying map, Plate III. 

The intruding rocks are granitic, granodioritic 
and syenitic masses which although here grouped together 
are probably of more than one age. These rooks are found

twenty miles north of the deposits fringing the islands 
on the east coast. A southern contact is shown on the 
accompanying map. 

Numerous diabase dykes with almost vertical atti¬ 
tude cut all the rocks in the area. Their average width 
is about 100 feet. Flat lying dykes cutting across the 
older formations are prominent in the vicinity of Cameron 
Bay, Glacier Bay and the east end of the South West Arm 
of Echo Bay. 

The large quartz veins which in places attain a 
width of over 200 feet cut all the rocks in the area 
with the exception in several cases where diabase 
dykes cut across it. In other instances the quartz 
veins cut through diabase. 

Flat lying sandstones and conglomerates younger 
than the granite but older than the dykes are found at 
a distance of forty miles north of Echo Bay and extend 
north and west from here. These may possibly be cor¬ 
related with the Coppermine River series.

found in the Echo Bay area: Pitchblende and silver de¬ 
posits, silver deposits, and gold deposits. Of these 
the first two are by far the most extensive. Gold has 
not as yet been found in profitable quantities. 


PITCHBLENDE AlO) SILVER DEPOSITS 

Several occurrences of pitchblende and silver have 
been reported and two of these are being mined. These 
are on La Bine Point on claims owned by the Eldorado 
Mining Co. and on the centre north shore of Contact 
Lake on claims now worked by the Bear Exploration and 
Radium Mining Co. A third occurrence which proves to 
be of great geological interest is on the Thompson claims 
off the south west shore of Contact Lake, No mining has 
been done on these claims to date. 

LA BINE POINT: La Bine Point is the site of the original 
discovery and has received the most study and development. 

The ore bodies occur in three large fracture zones 
several hundred feet apart and which strike in a general 
east north-east direction. They lie in the older sedi¬ 
mentary and volcanic series v/hich are highly altered by 
the granitic intrusive which outcrops nearby in several 
places along the shore. In many places the older forma¬ 
tion contains zones which are heavily charged with either

magnetite or pyrite and in many places with both minerals, 
and give rise, through weathering to large yellow gossan 
outcrops. 

Number one mineral zone is the original discovery 
and is the southernmost ore body. It can be traced for 
over 2000 feet, up over a high hill and is lost for a 
time in a drift covering, but is probably more or less 
continuous into the C.M. & S.‘ property where it occurs 
as numerous shear zones. 

Number two zone has received the most development 
to date. It strikes sub-parallel to Number one zone 
and mineralogically it is more persistent although it 
has not been traced for so great a distance. 

In zones number one and two, the mineralogy is very 
complex. Spence (19) gives four vein types which maiB 
up the ore bodies: 

1. Pitchblende - quartz veins. The quartz is 
brownish in color and is locally replaced by 
carbonates with which are associated sulphides, 
arsenides and native silver. 

2. Silver - carbonate veins. The richer silver 
ore is from this type of vein. The carbonate 
is principally rhodochrosite. 

3. Silver - Cobalt - Gan^onate - veins. The silver 
chiefly occurs in der^’itic habit in a carbonate 
gangue. Argentite is sometimes also present.

4. Cobalt - bismuth - quartz veins. The cobalt 
is in the form of arsenides with smaller 
amounts of nickel. Bismuth as native metal 
is found commonly as a center in dendrites 
of other minerals. 

Number three zone has not received much development 
work and so far only pitchblende and quartz in signi¬ 
ficant amounts have been reported. This zone lies sev¬ 
eral hundred feet north of the Number two zone and strikes 
sub-parallel to it, probably converging towards it to a 
slight extent. 

"M" GROUP ON CONTACT LAKE: Development work began on 
this property in 193E by the B.E.A.R. Company. Of the 
several silver and pitchblende showings owned by this 
company, development work has so far been confined to 
the’Til" group on the center north shore of Contact Lake 
about one-half mile from the water’s edge. 

The veins occur in a zone of fracturing and shear¬ 
ing which strikes N.E. with a steep dip to the S.W. 

These veins which are from li to 3 or 4 feet wide cut 
across a massive diorite, which when followed south to 
Contact Lake appears to grade into pink granite. Copper 
sulphides are persistent throughout the ore body, but 
so far the pitchblende and silver appear to be in lenses. 
Leaf silver in joints in the hanging wall of the pitch¬ 
blende lens is common. Where the silver ore is richest

it is in a carbonate gangae. The mineralization is very 
similar to the Eldorado ore bodies. 

THOLCPSON GROUP, BOW LAKE: These claims were staked by 
White and McKee in 1932. Here, a deposit of pitchblende, 
silver and gold in a diabase dyke is probably the most 
outstanding mineral occurrence in the area. The vein, 
of which the walls are very indefinite, can be followed 
diagonally across the diabase for some 200 feet and into 
the granite for several feet on either side. The pitch¬ 
blende, silver and gold were found in a small branch 
vein of the main quartz lead. Chalcopyrite and pyrite 
are abundant throughout in a gangue of quartz and various 
iron and calcium bearing carbonates. The striking simi¬ 
larity of this occurrence with that of the Eldorado and 
B.E.A.R. properties brings up a very interesting point 
as regards the genesis of the deposits. The strike of 
the dyke is roughly east-west and the strike of the vein 
is about N70^W. 

SILVER DEPOSITS. 

Several silver occurrences which may prove of eco¬ 
nomic significance have received considerable attention 
and these will be discussed separately below.

INVSSTIOATION OF OREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 


ECHO BAY CROUP, LA BINE POINT: In 1930 the Consolidated 
Mining and Smelting Company staked this group of claims 
which adjoin the Eldorado on the north-east. Here, there 
are a number of shear zones in a belt about 200 feet wide 
and over a length of 2000 feet, which occur in the old 
altered sedimentary and volcanic series. They consist 
usually of a band up to a foot wide, of intense shearing 
and alteration with considerable fractured rock on either 
side. Of the silver minerals argentite and native silver 
are important. Some pitchblende has been found. Mineral- 
ogically the property resembles the Eldorado. 

BONANZA CLAIMS,-LOOTELL POINT: These claims which are 
about six miles south of La Bine Point were staked in 
1931 by La Bine and St. Paul and are property of the 
Eldorado Company. At two places about one-half a mile 
apart spectacular silver ore was discovered in tabular 
shaped ore bodies which lie in fractured zones in a nar¬ 
row belt of the old sedimentary series. On the south 
these rocks are in contact with granite and on the north 
with a more diortic type of rock. The silver is native 
and is in a carbonate gangue. Development work is in 
progress on these claims.

CAMSELL RIVER CLAIMS: These claims are on the north bank 
of the Camsell river, about 9 miles from its mouth at 
Conjurer Bay, Silver was found in 1932 in shear zones 
in the old porphyry series at several localities. On 
the AX. group of claims, massive silver is found in a 
cabonate gangue with native bismuth and some of the co¬ 
balt group of minerals. Silver is also found on property 
staked by J. D. Nick®!son and on the Howe group. The 
granite outcrops less than a mile from the deposits. 

VIE GROUP, CONTACT LAKE: These claims lie east of the 
claims which have been described above. They were 
staked by the Contact Lake Mining Company in 1931, and 
in 1932 small amounts of silver were found. The rocks 
of the group are highly altered sedimentary and volcanic 
rocks of the older series and they are intruded by granite, 
the contact of which lies within the claims along the 
shore of Contact Lake. Trenching on No, 1 vein on Vie. 

2 reveals a complex siliceous ore body which strikes 
roughly east-west. The vein occupies a shattered zone 
in which considerable shearing has taken place and has 
given rise to chloritic schists on both the hanging wall 
and the foot wall. The ore is complex. The minerals 
include the arsenides and sulph-arsenides of cobalt and 
nickel with considerable native bismuth.

GOLD DEPOSITS. 

Although gold has been reported from several pro¬ 
perties at different times, this metal has not yet gained 
a prominent place in the Great Bear lake mineral field* 
Visible gold has been found on the Oro claims north of 
La Bine point* Here it occurs in a branch vein of a 

quartz lead which is about one foot wide. Gold is also

POSSIBLE SOURCE OF THE MINERALIZATION* 

Since 1930, at which time C. W. Knight reported two 
intrusives in the Echo Bay, one a plutonic granitic in¬ 
trusive and the other a ’’basic intrusive sill”, there 
has been considerable doubt as to which of these was 
responsible for the deposition of the ore-bodies. 

The "basic intrusive sill” reported by Knight has 
since been shown to closely resemble diabaseC^) and is 
probably a flat lying dyke rather than a sill. It out¬ 
crops on La Bine Point. The silver occurrences of the

Consolidated Mining & Smelting Co* are above it and 
several of the Eldorado Ore bodies are hypothetically 
below it. The granite outcrops very near to both pro¬ 
perties. 

With the exception of the Thompson ore body, the 
fracture zones containing the deposits diminish in width 
away from the granite contact(xx) and usually within a 
distance of a few hundred feet they are reduced to minor 
shear zones. The granitic intrusive was no doubt res¬ 
ponsible for these fractures which at this time were 
filled, partially at least with quartz, carrying copper 
and other sulphides. Later when the diabase intruded, 
these fractures were re-opened allowing a duct along 
which mineral laden solutions from the diabase, could 
travel. Such a process may have been repeated more than 
once, giving rise to the complex nature of the ore. 

In this regard, however, before definite conclu¬ 
sions can be drawn, several problems must be solved: 

Has there been more than one acid plutonic intrusion? 

Are the diabase and quartz dykes and the "granite", dif¬ 
ferent phases of the same intrusive, and if so, how can

the fact that diabase dykes cat a younger series of rocks 
which rest uncoraformably on the granite, be accounted for? 
How often did diabase intrude? ,Is the so-called "diabase 
sill" really a sill or is it a flat lying dy-ke? With 
these questions unsolved it is difficult to state the 
genesis of the ore-bodies. In consideration of the pitch-! 
blende-silver occurrence in diabase on the Thompson Group 
of claims, however, the writer is of the opinion that the 
intrusive which gave rise to the diabase was also respon- I 
sible for the deposition of the ore bodies.

DTVESTiaATION OF MEAT BEAR LAKE MIl^ERALS, 


MOLE OF OCCURRENCE OF THE MINERALS. 

PITCHBLENDE - This araniam bearing mineral can be 
recognized in three forms; as colloform masses, as angu¬ 
lar fragments in a quartz and carbonate matrix, and as 
curving veins. All three forms are traversed by numer¬ 
ous cracks which have been filled by later metallic and 
non metallic minerals. Chalcopyrite appears to be as¬ 
sociated with it most frequently although tetrahedrite, 
bornite, covellite, the cobalt-nickel minerals and native 
silver of the metallic minerals have been found filling 
the cracks. 

LEAD - has been identified by Kidd(14) in associa¬ 
tion with pitchblende from which it was probably derived 
by radioactive disintegration. 

ARESNOPYRITE - This mineral was not recognized in 
any of the specimens examined by the writer but has been 
reported by Ellis Thompson!18) and D. F. Kidd(14) as 
occurring in small amounts in crystals of prismatic ha¬ 
bit lining fracture cracks, and associated intimately 
with pyrite, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite and native silver. 

PYRITE - is present in a large number of the speci¬ 
mens studied. It is most commonly found with chalcopy¬ 
rite with which it is often seen disseminated throughout 








19 


INVESTlaATION OF GREAT BEAR LAICE MINERALS. 

the altered wall rock. Asenopyrite is sometimes asso¬ 
ciated with it as mentioned above. 

TETRAHEDRITE - is apparently most commonly found 
associated with chalcopyrite in a gangue of carbonates. 

In this association the chalcopyrite is the later mineral 
of the two metallics, being sometimes seen crossing tetra- 
hedrite in minute veinlets. Tetrahedrite is also found 
as a central core in the cobalt and nickel minerals. 

Here it often forms remarkable cubes which are probably 
the crystal form of the earlier cobalt-nickel minerals. 
From the latter occurrence it is difficult to state the 
relative ages. Thompson has reported tetrahedrite as 
occurring in fairly intimate association with native 
silver and argentite. It is quite possible tetrahedrite 
deposition has occurred at more than one time. 

TENNAl^TITS - is reported by Dr, H. J, Fraser of 
Harvard University in a report by Spence(19). It is 
associated with a carbonate gangue. 

SPHALERITE - occurs usually as irregular blebs in 
association with galena and chalcopyrite. It appears 
younger than either of these. Ellis Thompson!18) re¬ 
ports sphalerite as occurring in massive form and as¬ 
sociated with bornite, chalcocite, tetrahedrite and 
skutterudite.

IFVESTiaATIOIT OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 

PYRRHOTITE - A mineral giving the characteristic 
etch reactions of pyrrhotite was found in one section. 
Here it was intimately associated with chalcopyrite and 
pyrite and appeared to be simultaneon.s in origin with 
these. 

HEMATITE - was found in several specimens associated 
with quartz. Its relation to the other minerals is not 
known since it was not found in direct contact with them. 

MAGNETITE - occurs as scattered crystals in a quartz 
gangue. Thompson reports magnetite being cut by later 
quartz stringers which carry sphalerite, chalcopyrite 
and pyrite. 

BORNITE - has been seen in several specimens. It 
commonly occurs as a bladed intergrowth in chalcopyrite. 
It occurs as a graphic intergrowth with chalcocite. It 
has been seen in the massive form in association with 
chalcocite, covellite, sphalerite, and tetrahedrite. 
Thompson! 18) shov/s this association. Probably its most 
common occurrence is as graphic intergrowths with chalco¬ 
cite. 

GHiUjCOGITE - occurs in much the same manner as bor- 
nite, but it was observed in several instances along with 
chalcopyrite filling cracks in the pitchblende. Ghalco- 
cite is placed here because of its intergrowth with

INVESTiaATIOK OF GREAT BEAR LAPCE MINERALS. 


bornite; probably much of it is sapergene in origin. 

CHALGOPYRITE-- is probably the most abundant metal¬ 
lic mineral and probably represents several stages of 
deposition. It is found with quartz in cracks in the 
pitchblende. It is seen in intimate association with 
tetrahedrite and carbonate gangue, the whole being en¬ 
closed by concentric shells of cobalt-nickel minerals. 

It is found as mentioned above, with chalcocite, the lat¬ 
ter sometimes altered to covellite. It is found with 
bornite as an intergrowth and in a massive form asso¬ 
ciated with pyrite. It is often seen disseminated in 
the altered wall rock, and throughout the quartz and car¬ 
bonate gangue. Other occurrences have been noted above 
and will be noted below. 

GALENA - is found as a crystalline aggregate with 
massive chalcopyrite, bornite and covellite. This 
mineral has been observed in a number of specimens from 
the Camsell River area. Kidd(14) reports it in cracks 
in pitchblende with tetrahedrite, chalcopyrite, bornite 
and other minerals. At La Bine Point the common asso¬ 
ciated minerals seem to be tetrahedrite, galena and 
sphalerite. 

NICGOLITE - Specimens containing niccolite were 
studied from the Yie 2 claims on Gontact lake. Here

it occurs as a central core in vugs in wall rock sur¬ 
rounded by a concentric shell of cobalt-nickel minerals. 
Commonly in the centre of the niccolite are cavities 
which are lined with a green nickel arsenate (Annaber- 
gite). The niccolite is also found disseminated in sma.!! 
amounts through the wall rock and gargue. 

CHLOANTHITE - occurs as a concentric shell around 
the niccolite in specimens from the Vie 2 claim.s. On 
the one side it grades into the niccolite with no def¬ 
initely sharp boundary, on the other it changes to a 
mineral which gives slightly different etch reactions 
and probably is smaltite.. Specimens from G-lacier Bay 
contain chloanthite and skutterudite in zoned crystals 
and with minor amounts of smalltite having a core of 
tetrahedrite, chaIcopyrite, quartz and carbonates and 
usually containing native bismuth. 

SHALTITE . — the modes of occurrence of this mineral 
as zoned crystals have been given under chloanthite. 

COBALTITE - frequently occurs as one of the zones 
in the cobalt-nickel series. It has also been found in 
direct association with niccolite, bismuth and silver. 

In this association, the silver is later (cutting across 
it in places). When the cobaltite occurs as a zoned ar¬ 
rangement with other minerals of this group it is usually

very narrow and has its place between skatteradite and 
the chloanthite-smaltite series. 

SKUTTERULITE - occurs as zoned crystals with the 
cobalt nickel series as noted before. Thompson reports 
this mineral as isolated remnants of crystals of cubic 
habit associated chiefly with the common metallic miner¬ 
als such as pitchblende, chalcopyrite, and native silver, 
and to a lesser extent with chalcocite, bornite, covel- 
lite, tetrahedrite, and sphalerite. It has been found 
as individual crystals associated with native bismuth. 

RAMMSLSBERGITE - was not determined or recognized 
by the writer but its occurrence has been reported by 
Thompson(18). He states it to occur generally in a mas¬ 
sive aggregate of crystals of prismatic habit which are 
associated with the cubic arsenides; skutterudite, smal- 
tite and chloanthite. Occasionally also a few isolated 
crystals of rammelsbergite are found in association with 
metallic minerals such as pitchblende, chalcopyrite, 
native silver and tetrahedrite. 

SAFFLORITE - was not recognized by the writer but- 
is reported by Thompson(18). He identified it as occur¬ 
ring in two specimens with rammelsbergite. 

BAUMHAUERITS - has been reported by Dr. H. J. Fraser, 
in a report by Spence(19). 











24 


INVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAICE MINERALS. 

NATIVE BISMUTH - is very widespread bat in no place 
is it found in large quantities, possibly with the excep¬ 
tion of Vie 2 Group where fairly massive bismuth occurs 
in a gangue of quartz and calcite and some rhodochro- 
site. Here it is seen also to occupy a central position 
surrounded by minerals of the cobalt-nickel group. The 
bismuth is later than the latter. In some specimens the 
bismuth is in vein-like forms, cutting these hard minerals 
and at other times it is seen partially surrounded by 
them. An interesting association of native bismuth, na¬ 
tive silver and cobaltite and a mineral resembling nic- 
colite was observed on specimens from the AX property on 
Camsell river. The silver and bismuth are later than the 
others. 

ARGSNTITE - has been observed under the microscope 
by Kidd(14) who reports it as occurring with covellite, 
tetrahedrite and galena. Thompson observed it as small 
inclusions in the larger areas of native silver. He re¬ 
ports it in one instance as being replaced by pyrargyrite. 

PYRARGYRITE - occurs with argentite as noted under 
this mineral. 

COVELLITE - was observed in several specimens as¬ 
sociated with bornite, chalcopyrite, and chalcocite. In

one or two instances it was observed with tetrahedrite. 
Its other associations have been reported in preceding 
paragraphs. 

NATIVE COPPER - has been observed by Kidd(12) in 
tiny specks in specimens from La Bine Point, its mineral 
relationships are not known. 

NATIVE SILVER - occars as a mass of wires, as plates 
and as leaves. Under the microscope these appear den¬ 
dritic and fernlike in character. The richer silver ores 
are often qaite barren of other metallic minerals. Y/here 
in large quantities it is associated with rhodochrosite 
and calcite. It has been seen also in a quartz gangue 
in smaller quantities. It is most commonly associated 
with galena, chalcopyrite and bismuth of the me tallies. 

It has been observed with these in cracks in pitchblende. 

GOLD - as native metal has been found in small 
amounts in quartz veins. It was not identified by the 
writer and its relations are unknown. 

LIMONITE - is reported by Thompson as occurring in 
the fracture cracks, in one section, associated with man- 
ganite and native silver. 

MANGANITE - was identified in several specimens frcrni 
property between Government survey stations six and seven. 
It occurs as nodular masses in a carbonate gangue. Each

nodale consists of nameroas radiating needles. Thompson 
has reported manganite associated with limonite and native 
silver. 


NON METALLIC MINERALS. 

Of the non metallic minerals which form the gangae, 
quartz and carbonates are predominant. In most cases 
quartz is the older but there is evidence to show more 
than one period of deposition of this mineral. The com¬ 
mon carbonates are rhodochrosite (containing some iron) 
and calcite. Barite has been recorded in association 
with the pitchblende (Spence 19). Actinolite and chlor- 
itic mica have also been observed. 

OXIDATION PRODUCTS. 

Various oxidation products of pitchblende have been 
observed. These occur as veinlets and as thin colloidal 
and crystalline coatings on the pitchblende and associated 
rocks. 

Green nickel stain, probably annabergite, and pink 
cobalt stain, probably erythrite, are very abundant and 
widespread. 

Hydrated copper carbonates are common and are found 
near the primary copper minerals. They range in color from

Oxides of iron (limonite) and manganese (psilome-

ganese carbonate gangue are also common.

ducts is given later under "A More Detailed Description

URANIUM MINERAL CROUP 


PITCHBLENDE, 

Pitchblende is an oranate of uranyl and lead con¬ 
taining no thoria or the rare earths. It is the massive 
and amorphous variety of uraninite and usually contains 
varying amounts of water. Its composition at the time 
of deposition was probably UgOs* 

Five samples of pitchblende ore were polished and 
examined under the microscope. Of these, four were from 
the Eldorado property on La Bine Point and one was from 
the B.S.A.R. property on Contact Lake, (Plate III), The 
radiographs shown on Plate V were a means of identifying 
the radioactive nature of the ore. The following etch 
reactions were noted on the pitchblende: HNC^doubtful, 
HCl negative, KCN negative, FeClg tarnishes, KOH negative, 
HgClg negative. Aqua Regia doubtful. Too much faith can¬ 
not be put into these reactions since everywhere minute

veinlets of soluble material interfered with the true re¬ 
action. 

Under vertically illuminated li^t the pitchblende 
appears light grey when in contact with quartz and car¬ 
bonates, but when in contact with galena, it appears a 
dark grey. It scratches difficultly with a needle and 
in polarized light, as v/ould be expected, it is isotropic. 

The pitchblende occurs in three forms: {Plate V) 

(1) As colloform masses which have been fractured 
both radially and concentrically. The concentric frac¬ 
tures have all the appearance of shrinkage cracks. It 
has been suggested that the radial cracks are due to 
atomic disintegration, but if this is accepted it is 
difficult to explain the complete filling of these frac¬ 
tures by later minerals. There is also lack of evidence 
to show different ages for these two sets of fractures. 

(2) In a breccia ted rock in which, in the hand 
specimen, the pitchblende fragments appear angular and 

to bear no relation to each other. Under the microscope, 
however, each fragment is seen to be a broken-off portion 
of an original colloform mass. In some cases the frag¬ 
ments are widely scattered; in others they have been only 
slightly rotated and moved short distances. The radial 
and concentric cracks are present as in (1).

(3) As curving veins which sometimes traverse the 

IK 

containg rock for considerable distances. This form also 

A 

shows remnants of colloform structure throughout and again 
the pitchblende is traversed by numerous radial and con¬ 
centric cracks which are filled with later metallic and 
non metallic minerals. In the specimens in which vein¬ 
like forms are present there are always the scattered frag¬ 
ments of the no. 2 type which form the breccia ted ore. '* 
These are shown in Plate VL. 

Prom the above information, it appears that the l! 

pitchblende was deposited probably as a colloidal mass, j 
which on drying and hardening formed typical colloform 
structures, sometime prior to the deposition of the pre¬ 
sent metallic and non metallic minerals. In the harden¬ 
ing and drying process, cracks (both radial and concen¬ 
tric) were developed. Later minerals were forced in 
around the pitchblende, breaking it up and scattering 
its fragments throughout the mass, \7hen the later min¬ 
erals travelled along the concentric cracks for consider- j 

able distances, the vein type of pitchblende was formed. ! 

;i 

As is later seen, metasoma tic replacement was not impor- ; 
tant in this connection; rather it was a process of open | 
space filling. Such a sequence of events explains the ! 

three present forms of pitchblende; the original colloform

ASSOCIATED MINERALS.. 

Minute veinlets of quartz fill the cracks in the 

!■ 

pitchblende. These in turn are cut by more prominent j 

veinlets of carbonates. Chalcopyrite in association with a 

I 

a blue mineral (which was in quantities too small to ap¬ 
ply tests on, but which is strongly anisotropic and ranges 
from "blue to fiery red" under crossed nicols and is pro¬ 
bably covellite) are seen in isolated masses in the craeksj 
usually elongated along the cracks but sometimes appear¬ 
ing to have attacked the pitchblende walls and to have re¬ 
placed it to some extent. Evidence of replacement is the 
very irregular contact between the chalcopyrite and pitch-! 
blende. In most cases, however, the chalcopyrite appears , 
to fill the open fractures without replacement. Although 

I 

there is no evidence to conclude the relative ages of I 

quartz and chalcopyrite it is fairly certain that these j 

I 

two minerals were deposited either (1) simultaneously or j 
(2) the quartz preceding the sulphide. The covellite was ' 
probably derived from the chalcopyrite. Ylhen quartz and 
carbonates are both present the chalcopyrite is found with; 
the quartz.

tests for the elements manganese, iron, and calcium and 
it effervesces freely with cold (1:1) HCl. It is pro¬ 
bably the isomorphous series, manganosiderite-manganoca- 
lite of the rhombohedral calcite group. Associated with 
carbonates, small amounts of galena and tetrahedrite were 
found with covellite. These minerals appear to replace 
the carbonates. The tetrahedrite also appears later than 
the galena. These carbonate veins cut through the quartz 
veinlets. In one specimen a test for bariujn and the sul¬ 
phate radical suggests the presence of barite. 

OXIDATION PRODUCTS OF PITCHBLENDE. 

Many of the pitchblende samples are traversed by 
minute veins of brightly colored oxidation products of 
pitchblende. The weathered surface is also often char¬ 
acterized by these products giving bright yellows, reds, 
and greens, Charles Palache and Harry Berman(20) of 
Harvard University made an optical examination on several 
specimens from Great Bear Lai®, They report the follow¬ 
ing minerals. 

(a) Mineral X occurring as thin plates of a lemon 
yellow to yellow brown color, often standing edgewise in 
drusy coatings on the walls of small vugs in the vein- 
lets. It is accompanied by barite and quartz.

SILVER MINERAL GROUP, 

NATIVE SILVER 

Samples of are containing native silver were studied 
from La Bine Point, Contact Lake, Glacier Lake and Camsell 
River. 

The following etch reactions and physical properties 
confirmed the presence of native silver: Color is white. 
Mineral is isotropic. Soft, and can be readily scratched 
by a needle with light pressure. HNOg effervesces and 
stains the mineral dark. HCl a doubtful reaction.

KCN tarnishes brown. FeCl^ gives irridescent stain im¬ 
mediately. KOH negative. HgClg stains differentially 
brown. It differs in these tests from chalcocite by 
its color and sectility. 

On the polished section the silver occurs most 
commonly in dendritic and fernlike structures. When 
in contact with other metallic minerals it commonly oc¬ 
curs as veinlets cutting across them. Sometimes it oc¬ 
curs scattered through the gangue in minute blebs; in 
other sections larger isolated blebs are common, 

ASSOCIATED MINERALS 

In the richer silver ores, the gangue consists of 
carbonates (calcite and rhodochrosite). Rhodochrosite 
is the more common in specimens from La Bine Point. In 
specimens from Camsell river the predominant gangue is 
calcite. Where the silver content is high there is very 
little other metallic mineralization. 

In one specimen frcxn the "AX^^ property on the Cams ell 
river silver with two hard minerals of the cobalt-nickel 
group were observed in a calcite gangue. The silver was 
the more abundant. 

One of the hard minerals gave the following react ionsi

HgClg stains brown. The mineral apparently is nicco- ii

The other hard mineral gave the following reactions:!! 
Isotropic. Color almost white(grey). Slightly softer 
than niccolite. HHC^ negative. HCl negative. KCN nega¬ 
tive. FeClg negative. KOH negative. HgClg negative. 

Aqua regia negative. Cubic crystal faces can be observed ,, 
in some parts. It can be distinguished from braunite | 
by the ^2^2 reaction which is negative. It differs from || 

chromite in being non-magnetic and by its color. In this il 

1 ' 

way it also differs from magnetite. It differs from hema-| 
tite in that no red powder is produced on scratching. | 

These tests confirm cobaltite. | 

The niccolite either was deposited after the cobal¬ 
tite as suggested by partially replaced cubic structures 
in the cobaltite or the two minerals were deposited sim¬ 
ultaneously. 

The silver apparently was deposited later than the 
cobaltite and niccolite since it traverses them in min¬ 
ute veinlets in several places and also it roughly fol¬ 
lows the cubic habit of the cobaltite with an irregular 

contact suggestive of replacement.

INVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 

In a typical high grade specimen from the Echo Bay 
Groap and shown in Plate VI native silver is the only 
metallic mineral present with the exception of a few in¬ 
clusions of a soft grey mineral. The grey mineral gives 
the following reactions: Mineral is grey. Anisotropism 
doubtful. Under obliquely reflected light mineral is 
black. HNOg negative(doubtful). KGN negative. HCI 
stains differentially brown. FeCl^ negative. EgCl^ stains 
dark brown. KOH negative. These reactions cannot be 
depended upon since the mineral was present in amounts 
too small to contain the reagents without other minerals 
being included in the test. This unidentified mineral 
was found in blebs bordering and also completely sur¬ 
rounded by native silver. Its mode cf occurrence suggests 
argentite. 

Where the silver appears as dendrites, there is in 
several cases, a-very thin shell of a hard white isotro¬ 
pic mineral surrounding the silver core. All the stan¬ 
dard reagents were applied on this mineral with negative 
results. It is probably cobaltite, the most chemio.ally 
resistant mineral of the cobalt-nickel group. Between 
the silver core and the cobaltite shell is a narrow band 
of carbonates. 

The observations recorded above, point strongly

towards an original ^^cobalt-nickel” dendritic structure. 
Silver-carbonate solutions were introduced, and these 
attached the central and least resistant mineral first. 
Successive replaxj-ement continued to the outer zones. In 
this process cobaltite was only partially replaced. The 
silver-carbonate solutions deposited their burden with 
a central core of native silver and a narrow carbonate 
margin within the cobaltite band, the whole retaining the 
original dendritic structure. 

Kidd has reported native silver associated with gal- 
ena and chalcopyrite (silve'r later than either) and be¬ 
tween botryoidal slabs of pitchblende holding the pitch¬ 
blende together. 


OTHER SILVER MINERALS, 

ARGENTITE (AggS) was identified as an inclusion in 
native silver and in one specimen it occurs with a mineral 
of which the etch reactions very closely ressemble tetra- 
hedrite. The reactions noted on argentite are as follows: 
Color grey. Very soft and sectile. HNOg doubtful. HCl 
tarnishes. KGN stains dark, FeClg stains darker. KOH 
negative. HgClg stains dark. 

With the small amounts of argentite present it does 
not seem justifiable to consider the large masses of

native silver to be an alteration product of this mineral. 
Although native silver is not found intimately associated 
with other metallic minerals in a very great number of 
cases, nevertheless when it is found as such the relations 
are strongly suggestive of hypogene origin and not super¬ 
gene as is held by many for the native silver of Cobalt, 
Ontario. 

PJIRARCYRITE (AggSbSg) is reported by Ellis Thompson 
as partially replacing tetrahedrite. 

COBALT AND BIGKEL MimRAL GROUP. 


Arsenides and sulpharsenides of cobalt and nickel 
have been reported by Kidd(14) and Thompson(18), Their 
determinations were made on specimens from La Bine Point. 
Similar minerals 7/ere identified by the writer in samples 
from the B.E.A.R. and Contact Lake Mining companies* pro¬ 
perties on Contact Lake and from the ”AX" property on the 
Camsell River. Of particular interest is the mineraliza¬ 
tion on the Vie claims of the Contact Lake Mining Company. 
Here, there occurs an 02 ?e shoot caataining cobalt and 
nickel minerals and native bismuth as the chief metallics.

IWESTiaATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 


NICGOLITE, CHLOANTHITE, COBALTITE ANL SKUTTERULITE. 

- In polished sections studied from the Vie claims on 
Contact Lake, niccolite, chloanthite-smaltite, cobaltite 
and skutterudite have been identified in zoned arrange¬ 
ment. 

The niccolite forms the central core.except in some 
cases where annabergite is found as a vug lining in the 
center of the niccolite. The presence of such a vug seems 
to indicate open space deposition rather than replacement 
although the latter is suggested by the disseminated na¬ 
ture of these minerals in other parts. 

To confirm the presence of niccolite microscopic 
tests were made and these results follow: Color-coppery 
pink. Anisotropism very strong. Scratches with dif¬ 
ficulty, HNOg tarnishes and effervesces slowly. HCl 
and KCN negative. ' FeClg stains brown, KOH negative. 

HgClgstains brown. 

Surrounding the niccolite are a group of minerals, 
which under vertically illuminated light and before etch- 
ing appear as one hard, white isotropic mineral. These 
were "run down" by using the standard reagents (described 
in the Appendix of this thesis). Sampling was attempted 
in order to make microchemical tests but it was not

possible to exclude other similar minerals. Under blow 
pipe analysis a small sample of this mineral group gave 
tests for nickel and cobalt. HNOg when applied only gave 
a reaction on the innermost mineral. Confining attention 
to this zone the following reactions were noted: HNOg 
effervesces and turns dark. HCl and KCN negative. FeCls 
stains brown. KOH negative. HgClg stains differentially. 
The mineral is hard and isotropic. These tests place the 
mineral in a group, chloanthite-smaltite((NiColAsg), 
corynite(Ni(As,Sb)S), maucherite(NigAsg), andsmaltite- 
chloanthite((CoNi)A s£). 

Methods as used by Ellis Thompson(x) were next at¬ 
tempted using FeClg, KMnO^ , and aqua regia saturated with 
FeAsS. The cubic crystal habit, the negative reaction 
with KlhiO^, the positive reaction with FeClg, the posi¬ 
tive reaction with aqua regia saturated with FeAsS, and 
the presence in vugs, of annabergite are fairly conclusive 
evidence that the mineral is chloanthite with possibly 
minor amounts of smaltite in isomorphous mixture. 

The specimen was next repolished. Nitric acid was 
made up in strengths 8:1, 1:1, and concentrated, and these

methods of Ellis Thompson is skutterudite of the formula ii

In a specimen from Glacier Bay, shown in Plate (VIII) |

terudite identified in the Contact Lake ore in which the 
formula is CoAsg, 

Gohaltite and Niccolite were found in intimate as¬ 
sociation in specimens from property on the Camsell river. 
These have been described under "Native Silver". 

OTHER COBALT AND NICKEL MINERALS. 

RAIMELSBERGITE (NiAsg ) was not identified by the 
writer but is reported by Ellis Thompson as occurring 
in a massive aggregate of crystals of prismatic habit 
which are associated with the cubic arsenides, skutteru- 
dite, smaltite, and chloanthite. Occasionally also a 
few isolated crystals of rammelsbergite are found in as¬ 
sociation with metallic minerals such as pitchblende, 

chalcopyrite, native silver and tetrahedrite. 

A 

SAFHORITE (CoAso) was also observed by Thompson in 
y ^ 

specimens where it is associated in small quantities with 
rammelsbergite. 


ASSOCIATED MINERALS. 

Carbonates and quartz are most common as gangue 
material with this mineral group. In some cases quartz

predominates, in others the carbonates are more important. 
When native silver is present the gangue is essentially 
a carbonate. Common carbonates are calcite, rhodochro- 
site and ankerite. 

In many instances, particularly in specimens from 
the Vie claims, included in the chloanthite, are crystals 
of a soft, strongly anisotropic pinkish white mineral on 
which the following etch reactions were noted: ef¬ 

fervesces and darkens. HCl stains dark. KGR negative. 
FeClg instantly stains dark. KOH negative. HgClg slowly 
stains differentially brown. The mineral is native bis¬ 
muth . 

The cubic edges and irregular contact in part, sug- | 

1 

gests replacement by the hexagonal bismuth, it follow- I 

ing the cubic pattern of the host mineral chloanthite. ;; 

The bismuth occurs as an aggregate of variously orien- ■ 

tated crystals. 

Native silver (Plate IX) was found as a core sur¬ 
rounded by cobalt-nickel minerals which gave test re- li 

suits similar to that described above for skutterudite 
(CoNi)As„). The skutterudite was apparently the more Ij 

O 

resistant mineral of an original dendritic and zoned 
cobalt-nickel group of which the less resistant minerals i 
were replaced by the native silver and its associated 

carbonate minerals. i’

OXIDATION PRODUCTS. 

An apple green mineral which contains nickel and 
arsenic was obsei*ved as a coating around and near cobalt- 
nickel minerals. It occurs as a vug lining in niccolite 
and chloanthite. It probably is annabergite. A rose 
pink oxidation product probably erythrite is also com¬ 
mon and is found associated with the cobalt-nickel group. 
The color of this mineral varies from almost white to a 
deep red. 


COPPER MINERAL GROUP, 


Of all the metallic minerals determined in the Echo 
Bay area, the copper minerals are by far the most abun¬ 
dant and widespread. Of these chalcopyrite and bomite 
are most common. Chalcocite is also abundant. Covel- 
lite and tetrahedrite are less common. 

BORNITE AND CHALCOPYRITE. 


Intergrowths of bornite and chalcopyrite were

observed in several specimens. In one specimen £rom the 
Vie claims on Contact Lake, these minerals were found 
included in tetrahedrite. 

The bright yellow of chalcopyrite under vertically 
illuminated light is fairly conclusive evidence of this 
mineral. It can be scratched by a needle with li^t 
pressure (softer than pyrite). Anisotropism is doubt¬ 
ful. The following etch reactions were observed: HNO^ 
doubtful. HCl negative. EON negative. FeClg negative. 
KOH negative. HgClg negative. 

The bo mite appears a pinkish brown under vertical¬ 
ly illuminated light. Under crossed nicols it proves 
isotropic. Its etch reactions are: HNOg effervesces 
and stains the surface yellowish brown, HCl negative. 
KCN stains darker. FeCl^ stains darker, KOH negative. 
HgClg negative. Its hardness is about that of silver. 
These tests confirm bornite. 

The bladed bomite-chalcopyrite intergrowth was the 
only type observed. In several cases the blades of 
chalcopyrite begin from the bornite boundary and decrease 
in width inwards. This condition is somewhat suggestive 
of replacement by the chalcopyrite. In most other in¬ 
stances, however, isolated blades of chalcopyrite were 
observed. In one case at least, a blade of chalcopyrite

was discontinued in several places along its length by 
blue supergene chalcocite which had developed in minute 
fractures and vugs in the bornite and chalcopyrite. In¬ 
clusions of carbonate gangue in the bornite also cut off 
the blades of chalcopyrite. In all cases the blades are 
characterized by sharp smooth boundaries and there is no 
enlargement where the blades intersect. The blades show 
little relation to crystal boundaries or fractures in 
the bornite. The chalcopyrite is practically absent out¬ 
side of the intergrowth. Right-angled intersections of 
the blades are common. 

In view of the chemical similarity of bornite and 
chalcopyrite and from the above observations, it is fair¬ 
ly evident that the intergrowth represents simultaneous 
origin for these minerals. Certainly positive evidence 
of replacement by chalcopyrite is lacliing. 

Considerable experimental laboratory work has been 
done on intergrowths of bomite and chalcopyrite by 
Schwartz{l).

BORNITE ANL CKALCOCITE. 

Sab-graphic intergrowths of bornite and chalcocite 
were observed in specimens from the B.E.A.R. property. 

The typical association is shown on Plate XIV. 

Confirmatory tests for bornite have been given under 
"Bornite and Ghalcopyrite". 

Tests giving the following results, confirmed chalco¬ 
cite: Mineral is isotropic. Color is light blue. Hard¬ 
ness is about that of silver. HlTOg effervesces instantly 
and vigorously. HCl negative. KCN stains dark to black. 
FeCl^ stains mineral a slightly darker shade of blue. 

KOH negative. HgClg tarnishes slightly. 

In all cases where chalcocite was observed, it was 
of the blue veriety which is generally accepted as of 
supergene origin.- The sub-graphic intergrowth was pro¬ 
bably formed at a late stage as the result of the break¬ 
down of bornite. The occurrence of minute veinlets (with 
irregular walls) of chalcocite, and the chalcocite borders 
on the bornite are also evidences in favor of supergene 
origin for the chalcocite.

OTHER COPPER MINERALS. 

Tetrahedrite was identified in specimens from Glacier 
Bay and from the Vie claims on Contact Lake. 

Under the microscope tests made on tetrahedrite gave 
the following results: Mineral is jsotropic. Color is 
grey. Can be scratched by a needle with slight pressure. 
HNOg doubtful. HCl negative. KCN negative. FeClg nega¬ 
tive. KOH negative. HgClg negative. These tests con¬ 
firm either tennantite or tetrahedrite. 

Microchemical analysis were next attempted in order 
to prove the absence or presence of arsenic. 

To do this the ammonium-molybdate test of Short(x) 
was followed. A sample of the mineral was obtained by 
scratching with a needle and picking up the specks by 
means of a pointed and wetted match stick. The mineral 
was transferred to a glass slide and dissolved in HNO 3 
1:1, After drying the residue was leached with 1:7 
HNO 3 and the new drop transferred to another place on 
the slide then slowly evaporated. When nearly dry a 
drop of 1.5^ ammonium-molybdate was added. Y/hen this 
dried, 1:7 HNOg was added to the residue. The tiny

yellow octahedra of ammonium arsenimolybdate were lack¬ 
ing, The mineral, therefore, is tetrahedrite. 

The occurrence of tetrahedrite (from Glacier Lake) 
is shown on Plate XI. Here it exhibits cubic crystal 
structure and in places follows the irregular zoned ar¬ 
rangements of the skutterudite in which it is included. 

In many cases the cubic structure is marked by a definite 
line (Plate XIB). In others the boundary between skut¬ 
terudite and tetrahedrite is more irregular. It is fair¬ 
ly evident from these photomicrographs that tetrahedrite 
was the later formed mineral. 

In specimens from the Vie claims on Contact Lake 
tetrahedrite was found in isolated blebs and as dissimina- 
tions in the wall rock, Plate XIV shows inclusions of 
a bornite-chalcopyrite intergrowth in tetrahedrite. 

There is a general lack of evidence of age diversity for 
these three minerals and for this reason they are con¬ 
sidered here as of simultaneous origin. 

GOVELLITE was identified in several specimens. Under 
crossed nicols it proved anisotropic. Color is a deeper 
blue(indigo blue) than chalcocite. Its presence was con¬ 
firmed by the following etch reactions, HNOg negative. 

HCl negative, KCN stains darker. FeCl^ negative. KOH 
negative. HgClg negative.

INVESTIGATIOIT OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS 


The covellite was observed in only very small quan¬ 
tities in any one instance. It was observed only in as¬ 
sociation with bornite, chalcopyrite, chalcocite and pos¬ 
sibly tetrahedrite. 

OXIDATION PRODUCTS, 

The characteristic green and blue oxidation products 
of the copper minerals are present in many specimens as 
thin coatings. They are hydrated carbonates and pro¬ 
bably range in composition from malachite to azurite. 


MANGANESE MINERAL GROUP. 


Psilomelane {E4MNO5), pyrolusite (Mfe^Og) and manga nit e I 
(MNgOg.HgO) are the commercially important oxide ores of 
manganese. These three minerals are so variable in crystal 
habit and form, and in the quantities of water present, 
that they are very difficult to distinguish. Geo. A. 

n 

Thiel(a) describes psilomelane and manganite as exhibiting | 
nodular forms consisting of concentric layers. Pyro- 

i 

lusite is described by E. C. Harder(b) as exhibiting j

The etch reagents were next applied with the follow¬ 
ing reactions: HNOg fumes tarnish hut wash off, other¬ 
wise negative. HCl stains darker grey, brings out paral¬ 
lel crystal structure and also shows concentric parting 
or cleavage. KCNj KOH, HgClg and FeClg negative. HgOg 
negative in parts, in other parts very slow efforvescence. 
These tests confirm manganite. 

Throughout the specimens (Plate XV and XVI) these 
tests were applied on numerous portions with the same re¬ 
sults. The mineral differs from pyrolusite in hardness 
and the HgO^ reaction which gives vigorous efforvescence 
on the latter. 

The reagents used by ymitheringale and Thiel were 
applied v^ith very unsatisfactory results. They use 
{1)HC1 N/6 and concentrated. (SlHgSO^ concentrated. 
(3)H202(30^). (4)SnCl2 dilute and concentrated. (5) 

FeClg concentrated. 

The manganite occurs as nodular DBsses, the nodules 
being several centimeters in diameter in some specimens. 

On the polished surface, under the microscope the mineral 
shows narrow concentric bands which widen toward the sur¬ 
face. On further examination under crossed nicols these 
bands are obseiwed to be composed of numerous, variously

oriented, needle-like crystals, arranged in parallel 
form. The individual needles are discontinued by part¬ 
ing planes which are very irregular but give rise to the 
concentric structure. Toward the center of the nodules 
the bands are narrow and are made up of short needles. 
Toward the outer edge the individual needles are much 
longer in respect to their width and the concentric part¬ 
ing is less conspicuous. 

Thiel describes manganite from the Cuyuna range as 
occurring in a remarkably similar manner. 

"Nodular manganite ore is composed of concentric 
layers of needle-like crystals of the mineral. The layers 
vary in thickness from less than a millimeter to several 
centimeters. Each layer has its own peculiar arrange¬ 
ment of crystals; three different types are common. 

(1) Layers of varying thickness with individual needles 
extending across-the entire width of the layer. (2) 
Needles about one-half centimeter in length, with their 
axes parallel and dove-tailed to build up a layer an inch 
or more in thickness. (2) Short delicate fibers in an 
irregular arrangement, forming a felt-like layer. The 
latter type is generally present as very thin lamellae 
between the other two,"

INVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 


OTHER MANGANESE MINERALS. 

Ps Home lane was observed as an amorphous layer on 
pitchblende ore from property of the B.E.A.R. Company. 
Here it is probably a decomposition product of rhodo- 
chrosite. It is distinguished from wad by its hardness. 

Rhodochrosite is very common and widespread, oc¬ 
curring chiefly with native silver. 

ASSOCIATED MINERALS. 

The specimens, in which manganite was found to oc¬ 
cur, contained no other metallic minerals. For this 
reason the relation of this mineral to the silver- 
pitchblende mineralization could not be determined. 

The non metallic minerals are predominately carbonates, 
the chief one of which is calcite which often occurs in 
the center of the nodules of manganite, between the nar¬ 
row concentric layers. Minute veinlets of a white trans¬ 
parent mineral were seen traversing the specimen. Its 
negative reaction to all the standard reagents strongly 
suggests quartz.

INVESTIGATION OF GREAT BEAR LAKE MINERALS. 


Sm^MARY OF MINERAL RELATIONSHIPS. 


From a review of the modes of occurrence of the 
minerals identified and recorded in preceeding para¬ 
graphs, it is evident that deposition of the metallic 
minerals did not occur in a regular and definite se¬ 
quence. On the contrary there has been considerable 
over-lapping and probably a number of the minerals were 
deposited more than once. 

From the specimens examined by the writer it is 
evident that pitchblende was one of the earliest metal¬ 
lic minerals to be deposited. Nowhere is there evidence 
that it was deposited later than others, but minerals 
representative of all age diversity (in these deposits) 
have been found filling the "open" cracks in the pitch¬ 
blende. If the radial cracks in the pitchblende were 
formed by radio-active disintegration, the fact that 
these are completely filled by foreign material would 
represent tremendous age diversity between the pitch¬ 
blende and the filling minerals. Nevertheless, disre¬ 
garding the origin of these cracks, the open space fill¬ 
ing by metallic and non metallic minerals, alone, is

evidence of a considerable lapse of time between the 
deposition of pitchblende and the deposition of the fill¬ 
ing material. Other evidences of early deposition for 
the pitchblende are found where it occurs as breccias 
and where it occurs as veins. 

In spite of these apparently conclusive evidences, 
Spence(15) shows a radio-graph in which dendritic struc¬ 
ture is exhibited, and he points out that pitchblende here 
is replacing some earlier mineral, possibly silver. The 
writer sees only two alternatives to explain this re¬ 
versal of conditions: either (1) the pitchblende is 
secondary, derived possibly, by some leaching action on 
earlier pitchblende or (2) the dendrites were not ori¬ 
ginally silver structures. Pitchblende as amorphous 
material could not exhibit a primary dendritic structure. 

Pitchblende was probably accompanied by quartz with 
which it was deposited simultaneously. This is sug¬ 
gested by the carbonate filled cracks between the pitch¬ 
blende and quartz. These cracks follow the colloform 
structures of the pitchblende and their dimensions are 
very similar to the interior concentric cracks. 

Following the deposition of pitchblende and quartz 
such minerals as the simple sulphides of iron and copper,

lead, and zinc, and the oxides of iron, along with tetra- 
hedrite and tenantite were deposited with a second qaartz 
gangae. These minerals filled the cracks in the pitch¬ 
blende and probably broke it ap to some extent. 

Such minerals as the arsenides and sulpharsenides 
of cobalt and nickel were next deposited along with car¬ 
bonates. 

Minerals such as native bismuth, argentite, pyrargy- 
rite, covellite and native silver represent a later stage 
of deposition. Of these native silver was the last. No¬ 
where is it cut by other minerals but itself is seen cutt¬ 
ing several of the later minerals. ?^hen found in asso¬ 
ciation with other minerals there is usually definite 
evidence of replacement or open space filling by the 
silver. 

The relationships of native copper, native gold and 
manganite were not determined. 

A generalized statement of the development of the 
minerals in the ore bodies of the Echo Bay area may be 
made as follov/s: 

I Deposition of pitchblende and quartz. 

II Consolidation of pitchblende with development of 


cracks

OTHER DEPOSITS 
with 

CERTAIN MINERALOGICAL SIMILARITIES. 

The minerals of the pitchhlende-silver and the silver 
deposits of Great Bear lake are similar in several re¬ 
spects to those of the complex silver veins of Cobalt, 
Ontario, the pitchblende-silver veins of Saxony and 
Czechoslovakia and the pitchblende bearing veins of 
Cornwall* 

SILVER VEINS OF COBALT, ONTARIO. 

The silver veins of Cobalt, Ontario are lenticular 
in shape and they are always found near to the Nipissing 
diabase sill of Keweenawan age. The veins are found in 
the diabase, in the Keewatin complex and in the Cobalt 
series (Haronian). The richer silver ores are confined 
to the Cobalt series which consists of interbedded, brec¬ 
cias, conglomerates and greywackes. The deposits were 
formed under mesothermal conditions* 

The minerals making up the veins are very complex 
in composition. The more common minerals in order of 
their abundance are: cobaltite, safflorite, arsenopyrite

loellingite, niccolite, galena, tetrahedrite, smaltite, 
gersdorffite, chloanthite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, 
breithauptite. Of the rarer minerals are: amalgam, 
native-bismuth, cosalite, dyscrasite, graphite, matil- 
dite, millerite, polybasite, proustite, pyrargyrite, 
stephanite, stromeyerite, timiskamite, ullmannite, 
zanthoeonite. 

Ellis Thompson summarizes the development of the 
vein minerals in the cobalt district as follows: 

1. Deposition of the arsenic minerals, along with one 
sulphide and one antimonide. 

2. Deposition of most of the carbonate gangue. 

3. Period of fracturing. 

4. Deposition of native silver and related silver and 
bismuth minerals and some later carbonate. 

5. Deposition of sulphides of lead, iron, zinc, and 
copper, and of tetrahedrite, accompanied by a quartz 
gangue. 

6. Last stages of hypogene replacement resulting in 
development of pyrargyrite, proustite, stephanite, 
as well as a later silver. 

7. Period of decomposition and alteration, forming 
arsenates of cobalt, nickel, iron, copper, and 
calcium and carbonates of copper.

Of 

SAXONY AND CZECHOSLOVAKIA. 

The rocks comprising the Erzgebirge (between Saxony 
and that part of Czechoslovakia formerly known as Bohemia) 
are slates, mica schists, hornblende schists and crystal¬ 
line limestones which are cut by late Palae ozoic granite 
and which in tarn is cat by nomeroas dykes of qaartz 
porphyry and of basalt and phonolite of Tertiary Age. 

The veins are yoonger than the qaartz porphyry bat are 
older than the basalt and phonolite. The ore bodies are 
genetically related to the granitic intrasive. The gan- 
gae in the veins is mostly brittle clay, qaartz, horn- 
stone, calcite and dolomite. The ores in these gangaes 
form stringers, branches and pockets that are very 
spotty. The ores' have been divided into: (Beck d).

I and II together always form the bulk of the filling. 

These deposits have at various times produced silver, 
bismuth, cobalt, nickel and uranium. 

THE PITCHBLENDE, TIN 
AND COPPER VEINS IN CORNWALL. 

The rocks in which these veins occur are Devonian 
slates which have been intruded by large masses of granite 
of Permo-Carboniferous age. 

The most important minerals, from an economic stand¬ 
point, are cassiterite, stannite, chalcopyrite and other 
copper minerals. Native biaauth, sulphides and arsenides 
of cobalt and nickel, galena, zinc blende, scheelite, 
etc. occur in minor amounts. 

The veins of the deposit at the South Terras Mine 
have been divided into two classes, (1) those striking 
east, and (2) those striking north. The veins which 
strike east are characterized by minerals of high forma¬ 
tion temperature. These veins represent the earliest 
stage of mineralization. The veins running north and 
south carry minerals of moderate fomation temperature 
such as ores of cobalt, nickel, lead, uranium, and iron. 
These veins are younger than the east-west veins and they

are divided into (1) those bearing iron and (2) those 
bearing cobalt, nickel and uranium. In several respects 
the latter type resemble pitchblende-silver veins of 
Great Bear lake. 


SmmARY AND CONCLUSIONS. 

1. The minerals comprising the silver-pitchblende and 
silver ore bodies of Great Bear lake are found in 
shattered zones of jointing and shearing. 

E. The ore bodies occur in altered sedimentary and 
volcanic rocks, in granodiorite and in diabase, 
but always near the granitic intrusive contact. 

3. There is strong evidence in favor of a genetic re¬ 
lationship between the diabase and the metallic 
depos its. 

4. The minerals comprising the ore bodies represent 
great variety in composition. Among their elements 
are antimony, arsenic, bismuth, cobalt, copper, 
gold, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, sulphur, silver 
and uranium.

5. The pitchblende occurs in several forms which were 
originally colloform masses. 

6. In the development of the veins, pitchblende was 
the first metallic mineral deposited; native silver 
was one of the last. 

7. The copper minerals, chalcopyrite, bornite, and 
covellite are the most abundant. The cobalt-nickel 
minerals, and native bismuth are very widespread. 
Pitchblende and silver are locally abundant. 

8. In several respects these deposits resemble those 
of Cobalt, Ontario, those of the Efzegebirge in 
Saxony and Czechoslovakia, and those of Cornwall, 
Sngla nd. 

9. According to Dr. A. C, Lane of the National Research 
Council of the United States (Spence 19) the pitch- 

• blende in these deposits is the oldest known. From 
calculations based on the ”lead-ratio^^ method, it

(1280 million years).

A MICROSCOPIC TECHNIQUE 
for the 

DETERMINATION OF OPAQUE MINERALS, 

Introdaction (x) 

HISTORICAL: Although the use of the microscope for the 
study of rocks dates hack many years, it is only within 
the last decade that rapid advancement has been made in 
determining the relations and identity of opaque minerals 
by means of the reflecting microscope. 

The microscope was first used in the study of rocks, 
by Nicol(l) in 1828 and the first practical application 
was made in 1851 by Sorby(2). Probably the beginning 
of the study of the polished sections of rock began with 
Berzeleus(3) in 1814. He examined a section of pyrrho- 
tite megascopically and found another sulphide inter- 
grown in it. In 1863 Sorby examined a polished surface 
of a piece of iron, thus marking the beginning of the

science of metallography. The method was not applied to 
the examination of opaque minerals, however, until 1885, 
when Baumhauer(4) made micro-drawings of the polished 
section of bornite. E. Hussack(5) in 1904 etched and 
photographed polished sections of titaniferous magnetite. 

In 1900 William Gampbell(6) polished and examined, 
under the microscope, some specimens of pyrrhotite. He 
was so pleased with the results, that in 1906 he publi¬ 
shed a paper describing the application of "Metallogra- 
phic Principles to Opaque Minerals”. 

In 1908 Campbell and Knight(7) summarized a few 
characteristics of the Sudbury ore minerals. 

Campbell’s paper did not stir up any really great 
interest, however, for several years, although much cre¬ 
dit must be given at this time to such men as, C.H. Warren

E.M. Chamot* 

In 1911 L.C. Graton(8) and J, Murdoch(9) began a 
serious investigation of opaque minerals under the mi¬ 
croscope at Harvard University. In 1916 J. Murdoch 
published the results of numerous microchemical tests 
arranging them in a determinative table, which was by 
far the most complete work done along this line. In 
this work Murdoch introduced the name *Ty[ineralography”. 

In 1917 W.L. Whitehead(10) introduced the name 
^Ttlineragraphy", objecting to "Mineralography” since 
the study embraces only a certain group of minerals. 

Following Murdoch’s book, work along this line was 
carried on steadily in the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, Harvard University, Leland Stanford and sev¬ 
eral other institutions, and numerous papers on oblique 
mineral study were published in Economic Geology, bul¬ 
letins of the American Institute of Mining Engineers,

and other magazines. 

In 1920, Davy(11) and Farnham(12) published a text¬ 
book in which the determinative tables were based upon 
chemical tests alone. They reduce the reagents, used by 
Murdoch, to a very few. They use the term "Mineragraphy", 
of Whitehead. 

In 1922 Hans Schneiderhohn published, "Mikrokopischen 
Bestu^ung and Untersuchung von Erzen”, in Berlin. In 
1925 R.W. Van der Veen published, "Mineragraphy and Ore 
Deposition", in the Hague. 

In 1931, a publication by M.H. Short, "Microscopic 
Determination of the Ore Minerals" gave students their 
first complete systematic set of determinative tables. 
Short’s means of identification are based on the follow¬ 
ing observations: 

1. Polarized light - the mineral can be determined 
as isotropic or anistropic. 

2. Hardness - the mineral can be placed in a "soft" 
or "hard" group depending on its resistance to the scratch 
of a needle. 

3. Etch methods - the methods used by Davy and Farn- 
ham are employed.

A. Preparation of Materials for Investigation, 
General Outline 

The mineragraphie microscope is a most valuable in¬ 
strument for identifying opaque minerals and studying 
their boundary relations. In many larger institutions, 
very elaborate methods of technique are employed. At 
the University of Alberta the simplest procedure is 
followed in the preparation of this study. However, 
in any institution before the actual identification 
of minerals can be accomplished there is a number of 
definite steps in the preparation of the specimen; 
these are: 

1. A highly polished surface must be given to 
the sample selected. 

2. A mounting device, to hold the specimen rigid 
and level, is necessary. 

3. A microscope (petrographic or metallographic) 
must be transformed to a mineragraphic microscope con¬ 
taining a polarizer, analyzer and vertical illuminator. 

4. An artificial source of light is necessary. 

5. A suitable means of applying reagents and wash 


water must be devised 









76 


Appendix- Microscopic Technique. 

6* Reagents, made up in proper proportions should 
be at hand. The number of reagents necessary should 
be sufficient for the etch tests and likewise the 
microchemica 1 tests to be employed. 

If the results of the study are to be recorded or 
published it is essential that photographs be taken and 
this requires the use of a complete photomicrographic 
equipment. 

Methods used at the University of Alberta. 

Limitations 

The Department of Geology of the University of 
Alberta has for some years given instruction in petro¬ 
graphy, and the Department of Mining Engineering has 
instructed in metallography. The equipment in each of 
these departments is fully adequate to meet their de¬ 
mands, However, instruction in the microscopic deter¬ 
mination of opaque minerals has thus far been omitted 
and for this reason the greatest difficulty lies in 
the limited mechanical equipment available for this 
study.

Polishing the Specimen. 

The polishing of any rock specimen is necessarily 
done in four major operations* 

1* The removal of the desired chip from the sample 
by a diamond disc saw, or chisel. 

2. Rough grinding of chip. 

3. Fine grinding of chip. 

4. The final polishing. 

Removal of the Chip. 

The sample is first inspected and the desired chip 
is selected. Its removal is either accomplished by 
means of a mechanical chisel or a diamond disc saw. 

For the majority of specimens the mechanical chisel 
gives a sufficiently flat and accurate surface. How¬ 
ever, if the rock has a very conchoidal fracture, or 
if it is extremely soft the diamond disc is invaluable. 

The University of Alberta this year added to its 
equipment such a diamond disc saw which is very similar 
to that described by 7anderwilt(l). A copper disc,

which is slightly flanged on its peripheral edge to en¬ 
sure "free riding", is mounted on a horizontal axis. 

The diamond dust is supplied by a rotary steel charger 
while the wheel revolves. . The pov/er is supplied by a 
small electric motor. 

The polished chip should not much exceed one square 
inch in area and its depth should be not greater than 
one-third of the shortest axis of the required section. 


Rough Grinding. 

The rough grinding operation is best carried out on 
a sheet of ground plate glass using as an abrasive fcr 
hard and homogeneous specimens, course or medium grained 
carborundum manufactured by The Carborundum Company, 
Niagara Falls, N. Y., U. S. A. If the mineral is very 
heterogeneous in respect to its integral hardness, it 
is advantageous to reduce the use of coarse abrasives 
to a minimum and increase the use of finer abrasives 
since the former tear deep holes in the softer minerals. 
A good example of this was encountered in polishing a 
specimen which contained silver and bismuth in a gangue 
of calcite and quartz. The calcite and bismuth were 
torn out of the section by medium grained carborumdum. 















Appendix- Microscopic Technique. 


79 


However, after a new chip was removed by the diamond disc 
saw and the coarse abrasive operation omitted a very good 
polish was obtained. 

When the selected surface is reduced to one plane 
and megascopically free of pits the rough grinding opera¬ 
tion is complete. If the saw is used to cut the chip 
two or three minutes should be sufficient for this opera¬ 
tion. The specimen is now thoroughly washed and ready 
for the next step. 

Fine Grinding. 

The fine grinding is best carried out on a smooth 
glass plate. Carborundum, number 240 is first used for 
two or three minutes. The specimen is now observed un¬ 
der the microscope and if the pits and scratches are of 
uniform size the specimen is washed and ready fca* a finer 
abrasive. 

Carborundum, number 320 is next used on a smooth 
glass plate. The direction of motion in this step should 
be at right angles to the first operation. Y/hen the 
scratches are seen, under the microscope, to traverse 
in one direction only the operation is complete and the 
specimen is thoroughly washed. 

The time for the complete fine grinding should not 


exceed ten minutes

Polishing. 

The final step in the preparation of the chip is 
the polishing operation. This is done on a horizontal 
steel lap covered with billiard cloth. The metallurg¬ 
ical apparatus used is shown in Plate 18 A. After the 
power is applied the wheel is thoroughly soaked with 
water, then a suspension of levigated aluminum is ad¬ 
ded. To hasten the operation a counter revolving motion 
is given the specimen, at all times keeping the billiard 
cloth wet. After 3 or 4 minutes water alone is added. 
After 5 minutes the specimen is removed, washed, and 
dryed by a fan and inspected under the microscope. It 
should contain no pits or scratches and its relief should 
be uniform. The time for the complete polishing of an 
average chip should not exceed 20 minutes. 

If the above method is followed, most specimens can 
be polished successfully, however, in such specimens where 
water acts as an abrasive, dry grinding is found necessary 
This may be carried out on carborundum sheets, numbers 
1, 0 and 00. The final polish can be secured by using 
levigated aluminum on a chamois cloth tacked to a block 
of wood.

is described by CJrondijs(l) • The advantages lie in the 
fact that the grain boundaries stand out much more clear¬ 
ly. This method was not attempted by the writer in the 
preparation of this thesis but it seems pertinent to 
mention it here. 

More elaborate methods than the one outlined above 
have been described by M. N. Short(2), G. M. Schwartz(3), 
J. W. Vanderwilt(4), Davy and Farnham(5) and Murdoch(6). 

Mounting the Specimen. 

Elaborate methods of mounting have been described 
by Davy and Farnham, and Short. Davy and Farnham mount 
the specimen by placing it in a lump of modelling wax on 
a glass slide. The leveling device is a home-made mount¬ 
ing cup made of two-inch pipe fittings.

Short recommends a permanent mount, by cementing the 
polished chip in a section of rectangular brass tubing 
by means of sealing wax. The number and other designa¬ 
tions are stamped on the shorter side of the brass tub¬ 
ing by means of a hammer and dies. 

Grood specimens of Great Bear lake ore are scarce 
as yet at the University of Alberta so that the original 
surface was desired as a museum specimen. For this rea¬ 
son no permanent mounts were made. The simple system 
of mounting used in the metallurgical laboratory was 
employed. This consists of a lump of plasticine on a 
brass slide. The levelling device is a two-inch circu¬ 
lar brass tube about three-quarters of a inch long. 

The specimen is placed face down on a clean sheet of 
paper within the ring. The plasticine on the slide is 
then pressed down over the mineral until an even con¬ 
tact is made between the brass circle and slide. Al¬ 
though this system is very handy and simple the speci¬ 
men so mounted is easily put out of focus in the course 
of the hardness and etching tests. Plate 17 shows the 
mineral mounted under the microscope.

polarizer, an analyzer and a vertical illuminator. Any 
petrographic microscope can easily be converted into a 
mineragraphic microscope by simply adding the vertical 
illuminator between the objective lens and the barrel. 

A metallographic microscope can be converted by adding 
a polarizer and an analyser. 

The writer uses the metallographic microscope for 
all physical and chemical tests, but to determine iso- 
tropism or anisotropism the vertical illuminator is 
added to a petrographic instrument. 

The simple metallographic microscope with mounted 
specimen and artificial source of light is shown in 
Plate 17. The instrument is a Bauch and Lomb. 

The vertical illuminator (A) is a ?/etzlar, manu¬ 
factured by the E. Leitz Co. and is a prism type. The 
glass prism occupies approximately one-half of the area 
of the tube, thus enabling part of the rays reflected 
from the surface to pass behind the reflected. A more 
common type of vertical illuminator is the glass disc 
type described by Short(1). 

The 16-millimeter objective is the best all-round 
lens for mineragraphic work. It gives the most satis¬ 
factory field of view and it combines clearness of

vision with depth of focus. It is also the best lens 
to use with polarized light. 

Artificial Source of Light. 

The small lamp box manufactured by E. Leitz Co., 

E. Y. and shown in Plate was found very satisfac¬ 

tory as a source of light. The light which passes through 
a daylight diffusing glass screen is from an ordinary 
15 W-120 Volt, incandescent electric bulb. 

Means of Applying Reagents and Wash ?/ater. 

The ordinary glass eye-dropper was first used by 
the writer, for applying reagents. However, since the 
size of drop could not be regulated this system was drop¬ 
ped and the more simple platinum wire is now used. 

A small loop is made in the wire and it is bent as shown 
in fig. (I) 



(1) Short, M.H. - Op. Git. p.83.1^ 






















Appendix-Microscopic Technique 


85 


The loop is dipped into the reagent and then ap¬ 
plied to the portion desired. In this way a very small 
drop can be applied, which is of particular advantage 
when the mineral particle is very small and associated 
with other minerals. If the drop covers two or more 
minerals there is the effect of a small electrolytic 
cell produced and the true reaction is not observed. 

The mineral is at all times viewed under the micro¬ 
scope and any reactions are recorded as they progress. 

To wash the specimen, it is kept in place and shot 
with a fine stream of distilled water from an eye-drop¬ 
per whose tube has been drawn out to capillary size. 

The excess water is blown off and the mineral viewed 
as it drys. 

An elaborate method of applying reagents under the 
microscope has been described by Osborne(l). He uses 
a pipette placed in a pipette guide which in turn is 
attached to the lens barrel of the microscope. 

Reagents for Etch Tests. 

The reagents used by Davy and Farnham and by Short 
were found to be very satisfactory. These were made up

HNOg, 1:1 (1 part HNOg, specific gravity 1,42, to 
1 part HgO). 

HCl, 1:1 (1 part HCl, specific gravity 1,19, to 
1 part HgO).

FeCl_, 20 per cent solution,

KOH, 40 per cent solution, 

HgClg, 5 per cent solution. 

Aqua regia (3 parts concentrated HCl to 1 part con¬ 
centrated HHOg), 

commercial reagent, (3 per cent solution) 

Of the above reagents, KCH, FeClg, KOH, and HgClg, 
being dissolved salts, will each leave a residue on eva¬ 
poration, and this will often form an irridescent scum 
which may be very easily mistaken for an etch tarnish. 
The beginner must bear this point in mind, and he must 
always wash off,the reagent before it has evaporated to 
any extent, otherwise the results have no value whatso¬ 
ever, Since at least one minute should be allowed for 
the reaction to take place, the specimen should not be 
too warm as this will hasten evaporation, also the drop 
should be high in respect to its width; a flat drop will 
evaporate too rapidly. 

Examples of the reactions of the different reagents

can be seen in Part 1 . of this thesis. The writer 
followed, where possible, the systematic etching scheme 
and determinative tables of Short. 

After the etch tests are made and the mineral is 
"pigeonholed" into a small group, chemical tests are made 
on a microscopic scale. The tests so made by the writer, 
are described in Part 1 * 

Photomicrography of Polished Sections. 

Value of Photographs. 

Photomicrography of polished sections has by no means 
gained the prominence it commands. This art was early 
used successfully in metallography but due to the hi^ 
costs of having plates made, many publications have lost 
intrinsic value due to the small number of photographic 
illustrations present. Davy and Farnham have stated: 

"A well chosen illustration will establish 
a point more conclusively in the minds of the 
readers than pages of written description. For 
the student of ore deposits, such photomicro¬ 
graphs are invaluable records to be preserved 
as reference material.”

Methods and Equipment Used. 

In its simplest form, the photographic equipment, con¬ 
sists of a camera box attached to the microscope. This 
method was employed by Mr. Lowther{l) in photographing 
transparent thin sections of rock and very good results 
were obtained. 

The writer uses the photographic equipment of the 
Mining Department which includes a ”Leitz” inverted mic- ■ 
roscope and camera, "Type MM" model 1924. The essential 
parts of this apparatus can be grouped as follows: 

1. Microscope 

2. Vertical illuminator 

3. Illuminating system 

4. Camera 

5. Optical bench 

6. Table support 

7. Optical equipment. 

Set up as shown, magnifications varying from fifty 
diameters to over one thousand diameters can be photo- n 
graphed. By removing the vertical illuminator and using

obliquely reflected light, magnifications from natural 
size to twenty diameters can be obtained. 

Color Filters. 

In photographing thin sections the grain boundaries 
stand out in sufficient contrast in white light so that 
no light filters are necessary. In photographing thick 
polished sections, however, light filters are very help¬ 
ful in emphasizing the contrast and grain boundaries, or 
on the other hand if there is too much contrast in white 
light, better results can be obtained by screening out 
some of the components of white light. Short has ably 
described the use of a color filter as follows: 

color filter is a sheet of colored emul¬ 
sion between glass plates. When light passes 
through a green filter, for instance, the 
colors of the red end of the spectrum are 
absorbed, but the green, with some of the 
other colors near it in the spectrum, passes 
through. To get contrast between two minerals 
that are close together in the color spectrum, 
a filter that transmits light at the other 
end of the spectrum is chosen.

Let us take a specific example. Chalcopyrite 
is light yellow, and galena silvery white. It 
is desired to increase the contrast in color 
between them. If a yellow filter (the K V/ratten, 
for instance) is used, the chalcopyrite re¬ 
flects yellow light, and its color is not mat¬ 
erially changed by light passed through the 
filter. G-alena, being white, reflects a large 
part of the visible spectrum, including yellow; 
but only the yellow rays and. those near it in 
wave length reach the eye, as many of the rays 
at the other end of the spectrum were absorbed 
by the filter. Hence both chalcopyrite and 
galena reflect yellow light, and the contrast 
between them is lessened. It is obvious that 
a yellow filter is not suitable for bringing 
out a contrast between two yellow minerals 
or between a yellow and a white mineral. On 
the other ha.nd, when a blue filter is used 
for chalcopyrite and galena, the galena, which 
reflects most of the colors of the spectrum, 
will reflect the blue components. The chal¬ 
copyrite absorbs colors near the blue end of 











Appendix-Microscopic Technique 


91 


the spectrum, and, as only blue rays reach it, 
the mineral will appear dark. Hence in the 
photograph the chalcopyrite will be darker than 
the galena.*^ 

EXPOSURE; The time of exposure of the plate varies so 
widely, depending on the type of filter used, the size 
of the aperture opening and the distance between the 
plate and the source of light, that a definite limit 
cannot be set. However, for average work with the ap¬ 
paratus described above, between 10 and 20 seconds is a 
common average exposure. 

DEVELOPING-: The writer uses "Normal” plates which are 
not sensitive to red light. Of the numerous developers 
on the market, the writer prefers to use the simple one 
solution metol-hydroquinone developer which is made up 
in litre lots. When using, the solution is mixed up 1;1 
with water. The solution is made up as follows;

FIXING: For fixing the plate the simple hypo fixing sol¬ 
ution is quite satisfactory. A good formula is as fol¬ 
lows : 


Sodium thiosulphate (hypo) 
Potassium metabisulphite 
Water 


300 gms. 
25 gms* 


1000 c.c.’s 


After exposure the plate is developed in a dark room 
using a dull red lamp. The plate is placed in the de¬ 
veloper with the emulsion side up and a gently swaying 
motion is given the solution. The temperature should 
be at 68 degrees F. throughout. Five minutes should be 
sufficient time for developing if the correct exposure 
is given. 

The plate is removed and washed and placed in the 
hypo bath where it remains until clear. When the solu¬ 
tion is thoroughly soaked in hypo the light may be tur¬ 
ned on since there is no more developer to react on the 
emulsion. 

The plate, when clear is removed and washed for 
twenty minutes in running water, after which it is set 
in a rack and dryed. 

PRINTING: The printing is carried out in the dark room. 

The printing developer used by the writer is the simple

To make the plates as shown throughout this thesis 
the sensitized paper is laid on a flat surface and the 
negative plates are placed in contact with the paper 
with the emulsion side down. The ’^mask” of desired 
size is then laid over the whole and clamped in place 
with paper clips. If more than one picture is printed 
on one sheet, they should be printed separately as each 
negative will likely require a different exposure. Most 
plates were found to require an exposure of 10 seconds 
using a 60 watt electric lamp at a distance of 8 inches.

However, under the same lighting conditions as high as 
40 seconds and as low as 3 seconds have been allowed* 

Glossy paper is recommended since it brings out 
more detail than the various matte papers. 

After washing in running cold water for twenty min. 
the glossy paper is removed and ferrotyped. If matte 
papers are used they can be dried by laying them face 
down on a flat cloth. A towel serves this purpose very 
well* 


B. Tests On Physical Properties. 

Determination of Anisotropism. 

Value of the Test. 

It is a generally accepted fact that the most use¬ 
ful single test that can be applied in the determina¬ 
tion of opaque minerals is the test for anisotropism. 

This test should be one of the first made since it is 
the easiest, quickest and most instructive, provided the 
necessary apparatus is readily available* 

Of the earlier workers along this line, J. Koenigs- 
berger, E.Endell, and H.Hanemann are especially important. 
Among the more recent workers are, F.E. Wright, Edward

Sampson, M. Berek, F. E. Fairbanks and M. N. Short. 

In 1919 F. E. Wright published in the Proceedings 
of the American Philosophical Society a mathematical in¬ 
terpretation of the theory involved. This publication 
was not available to the writer and was not consulted. 

Principles Involved. 

The effects observed with polarized li^t are very 
ably and briefly stated by Edward Sampson(l) as follows: 
^When polarized light is thrown perpendicularly 
onto a polished section of a metallic mineral 
a large part of it is reflected. But before 
being reflected, this light has penetrated far 
enough to be affected by the atomic structure 
of the mineral. In the anisotropic minerals 
the principal effect of this penetration is 
to change the direction of the plane of polar¬ 
ization. The reflected li^t is still essen¬ 
tially plane-polarized, but the plane of polar¬ 
ization is in a different direction from that

of the incident light. In other words, the 
plane of polarization of the reflected light 
has been rotated with respect to that of the 
incident light. If the analyzer is set at 
exactly 90 deg. to the polarizer it will not 
be in a position to cause complete extinction 
and some light will be seen. V/ith a nearly 
white mineral, for example manganite, a faint 
gray will appear when the nicols are crossed, 
and this may be extinguished completely by 
rotating the analyzer to correspond with the 
rotation of the plane of polarization caused 
by the mineral. Yi/hen such a colorless anis- 
tropic mineral is rotated with the stage it will 
be found that the plane of polarization is ro¬ 
tated first to the right and then to the left, 
with an intermediate position of no rotation. 

A complete rotation of the section under cros¬ 
sed nicols will show four bright positions at 
which the plane of polarization is rotated and 
four dark positions in which there is no rota¬ 
tion of the plane of polarization. The great¬ 
est amount of rotation caused by any mineral is

probably between 5 and 8 degrees, but a rotation 
as great as 5 degrees is very uncommon. 

Some minerals show colors under crossed ni- 
cols which bear no relation to the color of 
the mineral when seen with the analyzer out. 

These colors are not to be confused with the 
interference colors seen in the study of thin 
sections. Light which was plane-polarized be¬ 
fore reflection may show after reflection some 
elliptical polarization, but the interference 
color that this would cause is of little effect - 
probably not more than a faint gray at most. 

A few minerals will show in certain sections 
only two bright and two dark positions when 
viewed with the tube analyzer crossed. This 
is due to bi-absorption. The amount of light 
which is seen with crossed nicols depends on 
two factors: (a) the amount of rotation of 
the plane of polarization, and, (b) the amount 
of light reflected by the mineral. The amount 
of light reflected depends, in turn, upon the 
index of refraction and the index of absorp¬ 
tion of the mineral. A decrease in either of

these may offset the effect which would other¬ 
wise be produced by the rotation of the plane 
of polarization; and furthermore, if the de¬ 
crease varies for light of different wave 
lengths, strong resultant colors will appear. 

From a combination of these factors, a strong 
rotation of the plane of polarization may be 
completely masked. However, if the V/right 
biquartz wedge plate be used the regular 
effects are observed; for with this plate 
actual rotation is the effective agent, not 
modified by the intensity of the reflected 
light. 

For qualitative work, the most effective test 
is whether or not, with the nicols crossed 
or nearly so, the mineral changes intensity 
of color when the stage is turned. If the 
intensity changes, the mineral is anisotropic." 

Methods of Observation. 


There are three ways in which anisotropism may be 
detected: (1) with the analyzer in the crossed position; 

{£) with the analyzer slightly rotated from the crossed

position; and (3) by the use of a V/right bi-quartz wedge 
plate and cap nicol. 

1. The test is least sensitive with the analyzer 
crossed, since on rotation a strongly acting mineral 
will change from complete darkness to a very faint il¬ 
lumination. 

2. "When the analyzer is not in exactly the cros¬ 
sed position, the mineral, when in the four positions 
of no rotative effect, will be in extinction as if it 
were isotropic; but when in the four positions of great¬ 
est rotative effect, the mineral will be brighter or 
darker than it would have appeared had the analyzer 

not been turned, because the mineral by its rotative 
effect is adding to or subtracting from the effect of 
the turned analyzer." This method is most outstanding 
when there is more than one grain in the field of view. 

3. A Wright bi-quartz wedge plate gives much the 
same effect on a single grain as (2) gives on an aggri- 
gate. By this means the amount of rotation of the plane 
of polarization caused by the mineral can be measured 
quantitatively.

writer. A small "Wetzlar'^ polarizer is clamped on the 
side of the vertical illuminator on a petrographic mi¬ 
croscope, such that the li^t is plane-polarized before 
it strikes the mineral. Since a strong source of light 
is absolutely essential for this test, the light from 
a slide lantern is used. The source of this light is 
a 400 watt, 116 volt Mazda lamp. 

Sources of error in this determination may be 
listed as follows: 

1. Character of the polished mineral surface. 

2. The surface of the polished section must be 
exactly normal to the optical axis of the microscope. 

3. Insufficient illumination. 

4. Poor adjustment of the nicols. 

5. Pseudo-extinctions due to lack of parallelism 
between polished surface and microscope stage. 

6. Irregularities of relief on polished surface. 

Hardness. 

As an initial determinant, hardness tests have 
proved most useful in this work. Defining hardness, 
as the "resistance to the scratch of a sharp instrument" 
the ordinary steel sewing needle gives excellent results.

Appendix-Microscopic Technique, 

Many elaborate schemes of testing hardness have been 
described, and of particular prominence is the method 
used by Tolmadge(l). 

Tolmadge divides the minerals into seven classes 
of hardness, using the following standards. 

A. Argentite D. Tetrahedrite 

B. Galena E, Niccolite 

C. Chalcopyrite F. Magnetite 

G. Ilmenite 

Short includes ABC and D in his "soft" mineral 
group, and F to G in the "hard" mineral group, Class E, 
he includes in both groups. 

To make the test the needle is held in an inclined 
position between the thumb and forefinger and dragged, 
not pushed across the particular mineral in the field 
of viev/ of the microscope. If, with slight pressure, 
no scratch is produced, more intense pressure is applied. 
The weight of the needle alone is sufficient to scratch 
bismuth, but on the other hand, certain arsenides of 
nickel and cobalt cannot be scratched at all. 

Color, 

Although color is a very distinctive property in

polished opaque minerals, nevertheless it is almost im¬ 
possible to describe the color of any particular mineral. 
For the beginner then, the color test cannot be used to 
full advantage, but with very little practice many of 
the more common minerals can be determined at a glance 
by their color. Outstanding examples are pyrrhotite, 
pyrite, chalcopyrite and galena. Murdoch(1) has stated: 
"The beginner in this work may at the outset experience 
some difficulty in this matter of color determination, 
but it has been found that the ability to distinguish 
minute differences in color grows very rapidly with ex¬ 
perience, and it is astonishing how much more can be 
seen after a week’s start than at the first." 

Shoirb suggests that the white and gray minerals 
be divided into four classes by comparison with native 
silver, the whitest, and sphalerite, the darkest, of 
the ore minerals as follows:

Chalcopyrite for instance, is darker than galena 
and lighter than argentite and thus belongs in Class B. 

For any such system of color determination, a com¬ 
parison microscope must be used. The outline given above 
was only followed in a very general way in this work. 

Electrical Conductivity and Polished Surfaces. 

Considerable work dating back to 1852 has been 
done on the electrical conductivity of minerals by 
European investigators. This early work, however, was 
confined to macroscopic specimens and only very recently 
in America have attempts been made to apply such tests 
to polished surfaces under the microscope. 

Among the American workers, Davy and Farnham(l) 
describe an ideally simple apparatus. It consists of 
needle terminals attached to holders held in either 
hand, and connected to a circuit consisting of two dry 
cells and an ammeter. In 1925 Kerr and Cabeen(2) de¬ 
scribed a much more elaborate and satisfactory system. 

The conductivity was determined by the number of elec¬ 
tric bulbs lighted by the current after passing through

the mineral, or in certain cases by the amount of de¬ 
flection which the needle of a milliammeter suffered 
when placed in the circuit. 

Roger D. Harvey(3) in 1928 published a paper de¬ 
scribing the work done at Harvard University. He de¬ 
scribes in detail elaborate 2 and 4 tenninal testers 
and the method of setting them up for use. The re¬ 
sults of some 2000 separate readings which were taken 
are shown in table form where the resistance in ohms 
is given for each mineral tested. 

Ho electrical tests were attempted by the writer 
for the reason that limited time did not permit the 
accumulation of the necessary apparatus. Short’s 
determinative tables which were followed are fairly 
complete without this means of identification.

C. Criteria of Age Relations of Minerals 

in 

Polished Sections. 

Introductory: For many years practically all descrip¬ 
tions of mineral occurrences have contained a section 
entitled "Paragenesis'*. The large number of incorrect 
interpretations resulting from the study of boundary 
relations in polished sections induced the Rational 
Research Council of U.S.A. in 1931 to appoint a sub¬ 
committee on mineral paragenesis. This sub-committee 
consisting of E. S. Bastin, L. C. Craton, Waldemar 
Lindgren, W. H. Rewhouse, C. M. Schwartz and M. R. 
Short, published a paper(1) in Economic Geology on 
"Criteria of Age Relations of Minerals" and although 
they claim "no note of finality for themselves or for 
others", they have accumulated here some very valuable 
information insofar as the determination of age rela¬ 
tions of minerals in polished sections is concerned. 
The subject is discussed in two parts: (1) Simultan¬ 
eous Reposition, (2) Successive Reposition. 

The essence of this paper follows:

1. Simultaneous Deposition(2) 

Simultaneous deposition may be expected under se¬ 
veral conditions: 

(a) In concentrated aqueous solutions, the addition 
of a precipitating agent may result in simultaneous pre¬ 
cipitation. 

(1) If precipitate is crystaline, con¬ 
stituents with stronger power will stand out like pheno- 
crysts. 

(2) If precipitate is colloidal, the 
various compounds will be intimately mixed; may also 
have phenocrystic texture here. 

(b) With rapid cooling the texture may become so 
fine grained that evidences of overlap are obscure. 

(c) In two component melts, the last part will 
crystallize out simultaneously as a eutectic. 

(d) In systems of more than two components, inter¬ 
growths resembling the eutectic may fom. Familiar ex¬ 
amples in pegmatites are the so-called graphic inter¬ 
growths of orthoclase and quartz, etc. Some of these 

(2) Substances being considered to be simultaneous only 
if their precipitation from solution begins and ends at 
the same time. 






v-xrfjfte 


r sA 









Appendix-Microscopic Technique 


107 


textures may indicate simultaneous deposition but others 
probably do not. 

(e) Simultaneous deposition may be effected by the 
unmixing of solid solutions in certain ores formed hy- 
drothermally. There are three main types requiring con¬ 
sideration. 

(1) The grating or bladed type. The most 
outstanding example of this type is the intergrowths of 
ilmenite and magnetite. 

(a) The inclusions of blade, plate, 
or rod-like foms are characterized by sharp, smooth 
boundaries. There is no enlargement where the blades 
join or cross. Replacement veins characteristically 
enlarge at their intersections. 

(b) The included mineral usually 
shows no relation to mineral boundaries, fractures arid 
certain other features that commonly serve to guide re¬ 
placing solutions. The inclusions tend to be evenly 
distributed. A general absence of evidence of replace¬ 
ment in an oriented mineral intergrowth suggests the 
possibility of exsolution. Any positive evidence of 
replacement becomes evidence against exsolution. 

(c) Commonly the intruded mineral 
is absent outside of the intergrov/ths. 







•■■a 











iU8 

Appendix-Microscopic Technique, 

(d) The included mineral often forms 
disconnected units rather than the networks common in 
replacements along mineral cleavage. 

(e) The orientation of the blades, 
plates, or rods, differs for each grain of the enclos¬ 
ing mineral depending upon the crystal orientation with 
respect to the plane of the section. 

(f) General similarity of the com¬ 
ponents in chemical and crystal structure is a "priori” 
indication of the possibility of the minerals forming 

a solid solution at higher temperatures. 

(2) Mottled Type. Microscopic inclu¬ 
sions of one mineral in another have been thought by 
some to result from exsolution. In other minerals, no 
doubt the mottled effect is produced by various stages 
of replacement. Their origin must be Judged not from 
the mottled texture itself but from associated textures. 

(3) Graphic Type. (The term "graphic” 
is here used in a purely textural sense.) The follow¬ 
ing modes of origin have been suggested: 

(a) Simultaneous deposition of two 
minerals at the eutectic point. 

(b) Simultaneous deposition of two 
minerals but not in eutectic proportions.

(c) Unmixing of a solid solution at 

the eutectoid point. 

(d) Replacement of one mineral by 
another with little regard to the crystal structure of 
the host mineral. 

(e) Recrystallization during contact 

metamorphism. 

In general in the li^t of present knowledge it is 
not possible to diagnose the mode of origin of graphic 
tectures found in ores from their inherent characteris¬ 
tics but one must rely upon the evidence of associated 
textures or base their interpretation on geological or 
geochemical evidences. 

II. Successive Deposition. 

Deposition in Open Spaces. 

(a) Deposition in Pores and Vugs. Deposition in 
pores is difficult to prove and differentiate from re¬ 
placement. Deposition in drusy cavities occurs often 
in ignious rocks and commonly took place shortly after 
the consolidation by solutions exuding from the rock; 









Appendix - Microscopic Technique, 


110 


sulphides are not uncommon and may be of slightly diverse 
ages. 

(b) Deposition in Vesicles in Lavas. The filling 
minerals usually do not crystallize together in allotrio- 
morphic texture, but form definite layers, the first being 
the oldest. 

(c) Deposition in Solution Cavities. Oxidized ores 
are common in this type, such as limonite, psilomelane, 
malachite, etc., as stalactitic or colloform deposits. 

Such deposition may be recognized by one or more of the 
following features: 

(1) Presence of diversely oriented fragments 
of wall rock that have obviously broken off the walls 
of a cavity. 

(2) Presence of aggregations of cave earth 
consisting of the relatively insoluble residue from rock - 
usually limestone - solution. 

(3) Directional deposition controlled by 
gravity - as stalactites (originally vertical) etc. 

(4) True crustification paralleling the walls. 

(d) Deposition in Open Fractures. The filling will 
have sharply defined though irregular boundaries. Frac¬ 
ture fillings are commonly characterized by walls that

"match"; i.e., would fit together at least moderately 
well if the filling were removed. This is often hin¬ 
dered by a certain amount of brecciation. 

Replacement. 

Greneral Rules for Replacement, 

1. "Sulphides", including tellurides, arsenides, 
etc,, replace all rock minerals, all gangue minerals 
and all’Sulphides". 

2. Gangue minerals replace rock minerals and other 
gangue minerals but do not commonly replace "sulphides". 

3, High temperature oxides replace all rock and 
gangue minerals but are rarely replaced by gai^ue minerals, 

4, Oxides rarely replace "sulphides". 

5. "Sulphides" may replace rock and gangue in all 
directions but are commonly guided by fissures and cracks, 

6, Replacing gangue metasomes, may develop as 
metacrysts in rook minerals. 

7. Replacing "sulphide" metasomes in the case of 
some minerals may develop as metacrysts, 

8, Higher temperature oxides often develop as 
metacrysts.

112 


9. Minerals showing idiomorphic forms in sections 
of replacement ores may be (1) residual crystals, (2) 
products of local filling, (2) metacrysts. 

10. Rounding of crystals in ores does not neces¬ 
sarily indicate replacement, for similar rounding may 
be shown by phenocrysts and by crystals deposited in 
open spaces. 

11. An initial replacement is not necessarily fol¬ 
lowed by other replacements. 

The criteria that have been used for the recogni¬ 
tion of replacement may be listed as follows: 

1. G-eological or G-eochemical evidences. 

Selective Association. 

2. Recognition of host structure or texture that 
has been modified by later guest minerals. 

Psuedomorphism. 

Transection of Structures and Textures. 

Selective Association - Some minerals in ores will com¬ 
monly be replaced more readily than others. In places, 
therefore, where replacement is in its initial stages 
the replacing minerals should be found associated ex¬ 
clusively, or at least prevailingly, with one or perhaps

two host minerals. 

Pseudomorphism - Features that are on record as pre¬ 
served pseudomorphically in ores include the following: 

Mineral textures and structures - crystal outlines, 
crystallographic orientation, parting, and cleavage. 

Sedimentary textures and structures - bedding, cross 
bedding, stylolithic structure, form or pattern of grains 
and oolites. 

Textures and structures of igneous rocks - flow 
lines, form or pattern of grains and porphyritic texture. 

Organic structures - form of shells, corals, cri- 
noids, etc., cellular structure of plants. 

Transection of Structures and Textures - Although in 
some cases the structure or textures of the host are 
preserved through replacement, in others they are obli¬ 
terated. ...Commonly the minerals that obliterated older 
structures or textures develop their ov/n characteristic 
crystal faces. 

Localization along Structural or Textural Features that 
should Serve to Guide the Penetration of Solutions 

Fractures and other openings - Veinlets are the 
most common and afford one of the best proofs of age 
diversity.

Bedding planes. 

Schistosity. 

Contacts between mineral grains of the same or dif¬ 
ferent species. 

Cleavage and parting planes of minerals. 

"Islands” in parallel Orientation with other "islands" 
and with the adjacent "mainland”. This condition is 
not proof of replacement but may result from simultan¬ 
eous deposition or by deposition in open spaces of the 
guest on an irregular surface of the host. 

Form of the Host-guest Contact - Where the host has ap¬ 
proximately non-a.irectional qualities as far as attack 
by the replacing solutions is concerned, the guest seems 
usually to develop boundaries that are smoothly concave 
toward the guest. 

On the other hand, where strong directional quali¬ 
ties are apparent in the host, such as bedding, crystals 
diverse in composition and in orientation, or pronounced 
cleavage, ....the boundaries are likely to be irregular, 
sometimes to the point of extreme raggedness.

Outline of Criteria of Hypogene Origin. 


The following is an outline of criteria of hypogene 
origin as given by G. M. Schwartz(l). 


Structures and Textures: 

xl. Granular texture, intergrown and interlocked 
grains. 

#2. Large grains or crystals. 

3. Crushed grains, fragments disarranged, rounded, 
cemented by gangue and ore minerals. 

4. Mutual boundary relations. 

x5. Fine intergrowths related to crystallographic 
directions of one component and not a result 
of replacement. Ex Solution textures. 

x6. Group repla cement. 

7. Graphic and subgraphic intergrowths. 

8. Irregular intricate replacement. Replacement 
independent of fracturing. 

#9. Absence of replaced minerals, relics, frag¬ 
ments or other evidence of replacement. 

10. Corroded or rounded relics. 

xll. Isometric structure in chalcocite; also shrink¬ 
age cracks in chalcocite. 

xl2. Specular hematite. 

13. Diversity in size shape and distribution of a 
mineral. 





Appendix - Microscopic Technique 


116 


Mineralogical and Chemical: 

xl. Intergrown ore minerals, one or more of which 
are normally hypogene. 

x2. Ore minerals closely associated with sericite 
or other hydrothermal minerals. 

3. The presence of known hypogene and easily 
altered minerals near the surface. 

x4. Minerals containing elements that part company 
under supergene conditions# 

x5. The presence of an element not present in 
earlier minerals. 

#6. Inclusions in probably hypogene minerals are 
usually to be considered of same origin. 

#7. Same minerals replace host rock and ore minerals. 

#8. Lack of known supergene minerals. 

x9. Minerals earlier or of same age as mineral known 
to be hypogene. 

#10. Association with minerals not stable under con¬ 
ditions of supergene deposition. 

xll. Certain minerals are fomed mainly under con¬ 
ditions of high temperature; e.g., pyrrhotite, 
magnetite, arsenopyrite. 

Processes: 

#1. Replacement of gangue minerals. 

2. Continuous series of replacements or deposition. 

#3. Lack of replacement of natural host for super¬ 
gene replacement or lack of supergene guest 
mineral.

Outline of Criteria of Supergene (a) Origin. 


Structures and Textures: 

#1. Replacement related to fractures, crevices, 
cleavage, contacts of minerals, network, or 
anastomosing veinlets. 

#2. Harrow rim of replacing mineral around ore 
minerals or gangue. "Centripetal replace¬ 
ment ." 

x3. Seriatim replacement. Series of minerals 
developed from one. 

x4. Feathery aggregates or acicular crystals re¬ 
placing host. 

#5. Botryoidal, pisoletic and concentric struc¬ 
tures. 

x6. Thin coatings of possible supergene minerals 
on host. 

x7. Sooty chalcocite, bluish white chalcocite,etc. 

8. Irregular cracks, small grains of chalcocite, 
"metacolloidal texture." 

#9. Serrate boundaries of replacing contacts. 

10. Angular relics of older sulphides, especially 
in earlier stages of replacement by chalcocite. 

Mineralogical: 

xl. Presence of known supergene minerals (i.e., 

malachite, melaconite, limonite, earthy hema¬ 
tite, etc.) of same age as late sulphide. 

#2. Kaolin when present may under certain condi¬ 
tions suggest supergene origin of ores. Its 
absence may suggest hypogene origin.

#3. Lack of gangue minerals with sulphides is 
suggestive. 

#4. Abundant chalcocite free from bornite. 

5. Presence of selenite in chalcocite - bearing 
ore. 

x6. More readily replaceable mineral most altered, 
as bornite replaced in preference to chalco- 
pyrite. 

7. Presence of quartz in center of veinlets with 
chalcocite. 

Processes: 

xl. Selective replacement. 

#2. Certain sulphides limited to oxide zone or 
near it. 

#3. Replacement only near porous and somewhat 
oxidized portions of ore. 

(a) The term supergene as used here applies to 

those minerals deposited by solution that have 
come from the surface and thus at one time 
passed into or through the oxidized zone. 
Artesian circulation would be included except 
where magmatic contributions have been impor¬ 
tant.
