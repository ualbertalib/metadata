ABSTRACT 


A Review of Legislation Pertaining to Petroleum Resources, 

,Government of Alberta, 1930-1957* 

In 1930, the natural resources of Alberta came under provincial juris¬ 
diction after 25 years of Dominion administration. The change was accom¬ 
panied by considerable controversy over alleged losses to the Province as a 
result of alienation of mineral rights. These rights took on new value when 
it became evident that Alberta had great potential as a producer of oil and 
natural gas. 

There was also difference of opinion regarding Dominion effectiveness 
in preventing unnecessary losses of oil and gas. The Albert administration 
at once faced the task of trying to improve t he standards of conservation 
which had previously prevailed. Much gas had been flared in early years, but 
this was not' necessarily to be classified as waste. Such losses had to be 
balanced against the general loss to society if development of the resource 
had been deferred until there was a market for the gas which, at the time, 
was largely a surplus by-product of eagerly sought naphtha. 

The Province 1 s early conservation legislation was hindered by the fact 
that voluntary agreement to the curtailment of flow necessary to prevent 
premature exhaustion of the Turner Valley field was not forthcoming from all 
operators. Many independent producers depended on full flow to meet expenses. 
Eventually the government had to set up regulatory Boards with powers which 
were termed ^dictatorial,” in order to safeguard the resource in the public 
interest. 

This situation prevailed throughout the depression of the 1930s, but 
was greatly changed during World War* II® Urgent demand for oil shifted the 
emphasis from curtailment of flow to maximum production. Widespread urban 
conversion from coal to gas greatly improved the market for the latter com-

ABSTRACT (continued) 
modity. 

In the post-war period, new geophysical techniques made essential a 
revision of leasing systems for exploration and drilling. These new methods 
assisted in the discovery and expansion of the new fields around Leduc, Red- 
water and Pembina. Eventually supplies expanded to the point where marketing 
became the foremost problem. Prorationing of production to market demand be¬ 
came necessary to the extent that output was reduced to less than half the 
maximum capacity of the fields. 

Urgent action was taken to promote export of gas and oil. Legislation 
was designed to assist the development of local pipeline grids and trans¬ 
continental lines. There was accompanying controversy over the ownership 
of these new facilities and over the retention of reserves for local use. 

With such a variety of circumstances, Alberta legislation pertaining 
to petroleum resources required frequent and extensive adjustments. Often, 
the decisions had to be based on estimates of future conditions which could 
not be assess®! accurately. Accordingly, the many possible criticisms must 
often wait for future developments to determine their validity.

CHAPTER 1 


THE TRANSFER OF PUBLIC LANDS 

The political and economic circumstances applying to the Canadian 
prairies during the latter part of the nineteenth century have had their ef¬ 
fect on Alberta legislation pertaining to petroleum resources. The central 
factor in these circumstances was the initial retention of the prairie natu¬ 
ral resources by the Dominion, involving the areas of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, 
Alberta, and large areas of the Peace River block in British Columbia. 

The three prairie provinces differed from British Columbia, however, in 
that they had no existence prior to their entries into Confederation, and 
therefore came into being without ever having possessed their resources. 

British Columbia, on the other hand, was organized nine years before the 
British North America Act, and entered Confederation retaining its resources 
except for those which it voluntarily conveyed to the Dominion in the interests 
of railway building. The prairie provinces were thus in a stronger position 
to register the protests which they eventually developed, alleging certain 
disadvantages to themselves as a result of the Dominion control of their re¬ 
sources. 

It is not easy to estimate how Alberta petroleum development and legi¬ 
slation would have been affected if the Province had been given control of its 
resources from the time of its formation in 1905 until it actually received 
the control in 1930. The best that can be done in this analysis is to note 
some of the most important arguments put forward by spokesmen for the Dominion 
and for the Provinces during the controversies which developed over the natural 
resources question* 

The Dominion had first possession of the disputed resources by virtue of 
the surrender of Rupert*3 Land to the British Crown in 1868 by the Hudson’s

. , and the subsequent cession of Rupert f s Land and the North-West 
Territories to Canada by Imperial Order-in-Council of June, 1870. When Mani¬ 
toba was brought into Confederation that same year, and when Alberta and 
Saskatchewan followed in 1905, the Dominion broke the precedent by which all 
the other Provinces cbntrolled their own resources* The prairie public lands 
n were to be f administered by the Government of Canada for the purposes of the 
Dominion. * f * 

Of these "purposes of the Dominion 11 two transcended all others - rail¬ 
ways and settlement. Those public lands were to provide the railways 
which would link the scattered regions of the Dominion and were to en¬ 
courage the settlement which would in turn support the railways and 
give stimulus to the older regions* 

Alberta and Saskatchewan, from their beginning, received an annual cash 

subsidy in lieu of the resources, while Manitoba waited 12 years after entry 

before receiving such assistance* Alberta 1 s subsidy in lieu of land, like 

Saskatchewan 1 s, was based on an estimate of 25,000,000 acres of arable public 

land, an assumed value of $1*50 an acre for this land* On this estimated 

value of $ 37 , 500,000 the federal government was to pay 1 per cent until the 

population reached 400,000, then lg per cent up to a population of 800,000, 

2 

2 per cent until 1,200,000 was reached, and thereafter 3 per cent* ' The acre¬ 
age, the valuation and the percentage to be paid were later struck out of the

legislation because they represented a combination of guesswork and arbitrary 
valuation, but the amount of the subsidy remained, ’’resting on no explicit 
basis.” Actually, the amount represented ”...the estimated fiscal, needs of 
the new provinces,”3 when combined with other grants and allowances, which 
are indicated in the following table.^ 

TABLE 1 

Alberta Revenue from the Federal Treasury. (1905-06). 

Grant for government................ $50,000 

80-cent subsidy per capita.........• 200,000 

Interest on debt allowance.......... 405,375 

Subsidy in lieu of land............. 375,000 

Building allowance.................. 93.750 $1,124,125. 

Except for minor adjustments in the per capita subsidy, these terns re¬ 
mained in effect until the transfer of resources in 1930. The provincial 
revenue expanded on the basis of population growth. It was hoped by the 
federal authorities that such financial arrangements would be acceptable to 
the Province as a substitute for possession of the natural resources. 

For a time, there seemed to be some chance of this hope being fulfilled. 
For although economic difficulties and political discontent had driven Mani¬ 
toba’s Premier -Nor quay to press for return of that Province’s resources in 
1884, the conditions at the time of Alberta’s formation put other issues in 
the forefront. After 1896 the settlement boom in the Northwest Territories

had concentrated demands on the obtaining of provincial status ard of larger 

federal grants. With the achievement of these in 1905, the main concern for 

the time being was the application of the new revenues to rapid expansion of 

roads, railways, telephones, schools and other public services. While the 

Conservatives under Bennet raised particular objection to federal retention 

of the domain, the Liberals declared 

...that federal retention of the domain, coupled with a generous sub¬ 
sidy in lieu of it and a progressive settlement policy, was distinctly 
advantageous to the prairie provinces. The electors of both provinces 
appeared to endorse this view.^ 

This reference is to the election of Liberals Walter Scott and A. C. 


Rutherford to head the first governments of Saskatchewan and Alberta, respec¬ 
tively. As in any election, it is difficult to ascribe the result to any one 
issue, but 

In those elections, control of the resources was an important, though 
not the only, issue before the electorate, and the election results 
may properly be construed as provincial approval of the scheme.^ 

Whatever the extent of electoral approval for retention of the resources 

by the Dominion may have been at these first elections, it is apparent that 

such support deteriorated in the first years of provincial administration. 

Expansion took place so rapidly that it soon strained the Alberta finances 

which had at first seemed so abundant. The change which this situation 

brought about in the attitude toward the resources is indicated, by the actions 

of both Liberals and Conservatives in the Province. 

The Conservatives had continued their campaign for provincial control

of the resources after the 1905 elections* Sir Robert Borden proclaimed 
that "they (the provinces) are entitled to the control of these lands just 
as much as the people of the eastern provinces."^ 

Although Borden thus campaigned for the return of the domain* he did not 
take action in this direction when he was elected, in 19.11* Be confined his 
legislation to attempts at reaching equalization of the subsidies between the 
provinces. 

The Liberals* however* showed that they recognized a change in popular 
sentiment* Premier Sifton* newly elected in Alberta* joined with Scott of 
Saskatchewan to argue for return of the resources to the provinces* coupled 
with continuance of the federal subsidy and compensation for land already 
alienated. Whether or not they actually wished return of the resources* they 
nevertheless made demands which were certain to be embarrassing to Prime Mini¬ 
ster Borden. 

The prairie provinces wanted to have their cake and eat it as well. Nor 
can. there be any doubt that Sifton and Scott expected their proposal to 
be refused. What they wanted was to forestall action b j Sir Robert 
Borden.^ 

The result was a stalemate until after World War I. Then* immediately* 
demands began in new form* with Manitoba taking the lead. Prime Minister 
Arthur Meighen found himself facing the argument that federal control of the 
resources was contrary to British principles. Chester Martin* presenting a 
case for Manitoba* argued that responsible government implied provincial con¬ 
trol of the public domain and that this principle applied "to all the self- 
governing provinces and Dominions of the Snpire* in fact but the Prairie Pro¬ 
vinces of Canada"^

Maxwell, however, denied this theory, pointing out that where provincial 
control of the domain was practiced, the reason was expediencey and not prin¬ 
ciple. The imperial government had often considered retention of overseas 
resources, but refrained because of possible need to pay subsidies, and be¬ 
cause of the impractability of exercising effective control. Thus he des¬ 
cribes Martin 1 s analogy drawn between imperial and Canadian policies as 1 illu- 

* 

sory, f because Canada "gave subsidies in lieu of land and could exercise an 
effective control..."" 

The Liberal government elected in 1921 under Mackenzie King took the 
same practical position as had the Conservatives under Borden, by rejecting 
the idea of returning the resources and at the same time paying subsidies on 
them. At this time, because Alberta was beginning to get a glimpse of her po¬ 
tential resources through such discoveries as the natural gas and petroleum 
in Turner Valley, she felt prepared to negotiate with the Dominion on the 
basis of getting the resources while accepting reduction or elimination of 

subsidies. Alberta thus parted company with the other two prairie provinces 

11 

which continued to use their constitutional arguments as a "subterfuge" to 
induce better federal grants, knowing "that possession of their natural re¬ 
sources, coupled with loss or diminution of subsidy, would bring burden rather 

12 

than relief to their treasuries...." 

Alberta actually took the initiative in promoting her new position. 

In 1920 the government submitted a statement "that Alberta would be quite 
willing to pay back to the Dominion all that it had received in the way of

subsidies and grants” if the Dominion would account for and pay what it had 
gained from the Province "on the basis that this Provinc e should have re¬ 
ceived its resources in 1905.""^ 

Financial problems added to the strength of demands by the Province 
for Dominion concessions* Heavy capital costs were causing an increase in 
the public debt, to the point that there was " f an increase in fixed charges, 
alone, of $870,000 - this being the increase in the interest on Public Debt, 
exclusive of Telephones. 1 " The Public Accounts "gave an excess of ordinary 
Expenditure, in 1921, over Revenue of $2,022,367; • • ."^ 

After intensive negotiation, Alberta proposed that the remaining re¬ 
sources should be returned to the Province with the following conditions: 

Present Subsidy to be waived on condition that compensation be given 
for resources alienated from the Province of Alberta for purely Federal- 
purposes. Claim principally made being for compensation for 6,400,000 
acres of Alberta lands alienated, just prior to the formation of the 
Province, for subsidizing the construction of railways outside the 
Province of Alberta. These lands to be capitalized at a figure to be 
agreed upon and the amount paid over to the Province over a term of 
years. ^ 

The Federal Government, under Mr. King, declined this settlement, of¬ 
fering instead the return of remaining resources plus payment of existing 
subsidies for three years. All three prairie Provinces refused this offer 
and a stalemate ensued. 

Premier Greenfield of Alberta had estimated that the 6,4o0,000 acres of 
alienated land, capitalized at $1.50 an acre "would just about equal the 
present cash subsidy for 10 years, instead of the three years offered by Mr. 
Mackenzie King." The Premier was not satisfied with the net return •which

mere acquisition of the remaining resources appeared to offer# He noted that 

"the Department of the Interior in 1919-20 had spent on these lands $1,304*312 

and only received $ 1 , 805 , 312 ;”# ^ The inadequacy of this balance accounted 

for Alberta’s insistence on compensation for the alienated lands# 

While agreement was still suspended, the demands on the Province and on 

the municipalities for improved services continued to increase# This was a 

result, not only of the expansion and consolidation of settlement, but also 

of the accumulated, deferred, demands from the war years# 

Even the older Provinces with their well settled and well established 
populations which had long since passed the colonization state, found 
great difficulty in meeting these new demands out of ordinary revenue# 

The Dominion’s reluctance to comply with Provincial requests was in- 

creased as a result of the combined effects of "rash railway policies"* 1 " 0 and 

war expenditures# 

In seven years, the public debt of the Dominion increased sevenfold# 

The Dominion was reluctant to undertake new responsibilities, and this 
paralyzing debt became the financial counterpart of the political weak¬ 
ness which fell upon the Dominion#^ 

New discoveries in Turner Valley in 1924 added further attractiveness 

to the revenue-producing possibilities of the Alberta resources# By 1926 the 

Province was negotiating on conditions previously rejected, the receipt of 

"its unalienated domain and a continuance of the land subsidy for a period of

three years#" Agreement was disrupted when Quebec Members of Parliament

raised the issue of safeguarding the educational rights of Alberta’s Catholic 

minority. ”At even the vague prospect of revival of a sectarian dispute both 

the provincial and the federal government turned tail precipitately, and the 

20 

impending legislation was dropped. !t 

In 1929 the House of Commons passed a resolution favouring return of the 

resources to the Prairie Provinces with the various provincial claims to be 

21 

’’’investigated with a view to satisfactory and equitable adjustment.The 
Alberta Legislature followed up this resolution with one of its own, deciding 
that it should ’’again interview the Government of Canada in an effort to ar¬ 
range this year satisfactory terms upon which the Natural Resources may be re- 

22 

turned to this Province.” 

The problem was to devise a formula for evaluating the alienated resour- 

2 

ces. Could the provinces have obtained more revenue from homesteads* Would 
they have attained more revenue from, the natural resources? Would Alberta, 
for example, have developed oil and gas more efficiently#? Prime Minister 
Meighen described the problem as being the equivalent of trying to unscramble 

an egg. 

Alberta reached an agreement with the Dominion In December, 1929* after 
Manitoba’s negotiations had for the first time brought forth a federal admis¬ 
sion that its retention of the resources might have placed the provinces con¬ 
cerned in a position of inequality with the rest of Canada# The Turgeon Com¬ 
mission had sought to re-establish Manitoba’s equality by adopting a formula

similar to that used for Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905• ' Alberta’s 
agreement also called for equality with other provinces, by means of obtain¬ 
ing its unalienated resources, continued receipt of land subsidy without 
alteration, and a Royal Commission to decide if further compensation should 

p; 

be given. Later, following Saskatchewan, a reservation was made concern¬ 
ing the Dominion’s constitutional justification in holding the lands except 
in trust, but this claim was rejected by the Privy Council. 

In 1934 the promised Royal Commission set out to make a final account¬ 
ing, with the main idea of putting the Province in the position it would have 
been in if it had possessed the resources since 3-905* This meant comparing 
actual Dominion achievements with hypothetical Provincial achievements, the 
latter representing the unscrambling of the egg. In this task the Commission 
was unsuccessful, even after analysis of much evidence. 

...a real accounting had not been achieved. The Dominion credits were, 
in the main, easily assessed. But the debts were not, and the commis¬ 
sions nowhere ventured to set a precise evaluation upon the financial 
loss suffered by Saskatchewan and Alberta.. .^5 

The Dominion credits claimed included past subsidies, subsidies to be 
paid in the future, administrative expenses, revenues from school lands ob¬ 
tained by the Dominion and turned over to the Province, and aid in construc¬ 
tion of branch line railways.

Regarding the Dominion claim for several million dollars in connection 
with branch line railways, the Commission pointed out that similar lines had 
been built in other provinces, and that Alberta should not be asked to re¬ 
imburse the Dominion for this unless the other Provinces were called upon to 
do likewise* 

The Dominion had not been unrewarded for its expenditures. The ,f pur- 
poses of the Dominion 11 , unification of the country by railways and by settle¬ 
ment, had largely been achieved, with inestimable ultimate value to the 
country as a whole. In addition, although not aiming for production of 

revenues, the Dominion obtained from Alberta over $32,000,000 in the 1905-1930 
29 

period.

27. The Commission felt that there were too many uncertainties involved 
to regard this amount as a hard-and-fast figure. 

28. The Commission felt this amount to be excessive because it included 
items which provincial administration might have reduced.

What might have been attained under policies designed not for settle¬ 
ment alone, but for settlement, and revenue, is difficult to estimate, p g 
but assuredly substantial increases of revenue might have beer expected/ 


There was a variety of matters concerning which provincial policies, de¬ 
signed to produce revenues, might have done so on a scale greater than that 

achieved by the Dominion* The main items, however, related to the aliera- 

30 

tion of surface rights and to the alienation of under-rights* Commitments 
which the Dominion entered into before September 1, 1905 and which subse¬ 
quently were honoured, were not considered, since such rights would have been 

lost to the Province in any case. About 7*000,000 acres were alienated after 

31 

1905* which were in fulfillment of commitments prior to that date.' 

Similarly, commitments entered into before October 1, 1930, but not com¬ 
pleted until after that date, are included unless they were later abandoned*

for those two sister Provinces when calculated in terms of mineral quantity 

37 

and value. This estimate was mainly true because of the inclusion of coal, 
petroleum and natural gas in the mineral wealth category. 

The Commission expressed the view that it had the fullest information re¬ 
garding all aspects of these resources, and that it examined the various tech¬ 
nical questions such as the waiving of rentals in encouragement of drilling 
operations, and the ways in which Provincial administration might have dif¬ 
fered from that of the Dominion. They found little fault with Dominion ad¬ 
ministration from the federal standpoint; !, yet it embodied some features - 
chiefly in respect to the development of petroleum and natural gas areas - 

which the province, guided by its need for revenue, would probably not have 

38 

followed.™ Consequently it was felt that Provincial administration would 

have obtained revenues™ considerably larger™ than those obtained by the Dom- 

38 

inion from the mineral resources. 

The Commission got no further than such general phrases in estimating 
what Provincial policies might have done. Lacking mathematical estimates, 
which would have led to ™endless variation, and, consequently, to endless 
controversy™, 7 it finally quoted with approval the recommendation made m 
1921 by Arthur Meighen: 

™You may get further by one way and one way only, by presenting some con¬ 
crete proposal in figures, that will appeal to a fair-minded man as a 
square, bald, rough but honourable solution.

The Commission 1 s proposal was that the Dominion should pay Alberta the 
sum of $5,000,000 which, 

...when added to all the purely provincial benefits that Alberta has re¬ 
ceived or is yet to receive from the Dominion in respect of its resources 
will, in our judgement, balance the amount of net revenue which the pro¬ 
vince would probably have obtained from those portions of its resources 
alienated or otherwise disposed of bv the Dominion during the course of 
its twenty-five year administration.^' 

The terms of reference of the Commission recalled the 1929-30 arrange¬ 
ment that all governments concerned were to be in agreement before acceptance 
of the report. While Alberta showed agreement with the Dominion, Saskatchewan 
showed doubts as a result of the dissenting vote of H. V. Bigelow, one of the 
members of the Saskatchewan Commission which made recommendations similar to 
those for Alberta. Bigelow presented arguments to show that Saskatchewan 
should get over $58,000,000, and this had enough appeal to cause both Provinces 
to defer acceptance of the Commission conclusions. 

In the meantime. Provincial finanaes became more precarious all across 
Canada, mainly because of the economic depression. Agitation for federal 
subsidies based on fiscal need developed. Mackenzie King f s 1937 Rowell-Sirois 
Commission attempted with little success to replace piecemeal adjustments with 
a final settlement of all Provincial claims against the Dominion. 

World War II brought about agreement on a system of tax rentals payable 
by the Dominion to all Provinces, and similar arrangements continued with 
some exceptions in the post-war period, in the continued absence of agree¬ 
ment on any final settlement as visualized by Mr. King.

Despite the absence of such final settlement, the year 1930 nevertheless 

marked the time when the Alberta government could begin to demonstrate what 

Provincial administration could do with the resources, which still constituted 

41 

”an extensive and valuable public domain.” 

As to comparison between the years of Dominion control and those of 
Provincial control, caution must be observed. Economic conditions were, of 
course, different in the years before 1930 in comparison with the years after 
that date. In addition, the Province obtained lessons and experience from 
the quarter century of federal administration. Subsequent chapters will con¬ 
sider some of the main policies which the Province of Alberta developed in 
dealing with its new responsibilities insofar as petroleum and natural gas 
resources are concerned. In this process, some effects of previous federal 
policies will be noted.

CHAPTER 2 


THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALBERTA y S PETROLEUM POTENTIAL 
Petroleum and natural gas are found in strata of sedimentary rock which 
have accumulated in the bottoms of shallow seas. Such seas have periodical¬ 
ly invaded the land as a result of sinking and rising of the earth f s sur¬ 
face. The accompanying sedimentary rock strata geologically dated from 
Cambrian to Recent periods have been found to contain petroleum and gas. ^ 
Hydrocarbons which survive the disintegration of minute marine plants 
and animals accumulate in the sediments, and under certain conditions of pres¬ 
sure, temperature, and catalysis, are converted into petroleum. Such organic 
matter is lighter than the salt water with which it is associated, and under 
the pressure of new upper layers of rock it is forced through permeable sand¬ 
stone or limestone to a position above the water. Such upward movement is 
stopped when a reservoir or ,, trap M , made of a layer of Impermeable rock rough¬ 
ly shaped like an inverted cup, is encountered. The rising oil and gas 

readily enter the reservoir and fill it from the top downward. The oil 
and gas are confined above the water against the impervious roof bf the 
trap. They cannot escape until the trap is full...This statement is ap¬ 
plicable to oil pools in all of their considerable variations in form 
and size. 1 2 

Alberta is part *of a large sedimentary area extending down the east side 
of the Rocky Mountains from Alaska through Western Canada and the United States 
to the Gulf coast of Mexico and to Guatemala. Other major areas are in the 
Appalachian region, the Gulf coast States, and California. In Eastern Canada,

the south of Ontario started with ”less than 12,000 barrels in 1862” and New 
Brunswick "got a little oil in 1859.”^ These fields have been maintained in 
minor output, producing 412,000 and 13,000 barrels respectively in 1954.^ 

The Western Plains sedimentary area in Canada is about 800 miles wide at 
the United States border, and narrows rapidly to about 200 miles west of Great 
Bear Lake, then widening to 300 miles at the Arctic coast around the mouth 
of the Mackenzie river.' It therefore includes a portion of southern Mani¬ 
toba, the south half of Saskatchewan, nearly all of Alberta, the north-east 
corner of British Columbia and the narrow strip through the North-West Terri¬ 
tories along the valley of the Mackenzie. The average thickness of sediment 
which might carry petroleum is ”of the order of two miles” in this Plains 
area^, which indicates its potential, much of which is still unexplored. In 
production achieved, Alberta produced 137,000,000 barrels in 1957, and Saskatche¬ 
wan 37,000,000 barrels, constituting together nearly 96 per cent of Canada 1 s 

7 

1957 total of 182,000,000 barrels. Alberta 1 s 1957 output thus represented 

about 2.1 per cent of the total world production of crude oil, estimated at 

8 

6,429 million barrels. 

Such was the output in the Province after more than half a century of 
development starting with gas discoveries along the advancing C.P.R. line in

1883* In drilling for water to supply the locomotives, gas was struck at a 

9 

depth of 1,155 feet, the place being Langevin, later called Alderson. 

Drilling in an attempt to find coal was responsible for the first dis¬ 
coveries in the valuable Medicine Hat gas field In 1890. From then until 
1904 a number of shallow wells were drilled in this area, none of which had 
casing cemented* This caused the casing to corrode, permitting gas to filter 
through to the upper soil and creating a serious fire hazard* Fortunately, 
the destruction of property was not frequent, and the town grew rapidly with 
the inducement of gas supplies to attract industry* 

Calgary also became interested in gas supplies, and the Calgary Natural 
Gas Company was organized in 1905, attaining enough gas by 1909 to supply the 
Calgary Brewery, using a well, to the east of the city* The Bow Island field 
174 miles from Calgary, was connected to the city by pipeline InX912, and was 
able to serve most of the population with gas for the ensuing eight years* 

The next banner year was 1914* when the first discovery occurred in 
Turner Valley, the field that was to be the most famous in Canada for the 
next thirty years* The flow of gas from the first well contained "vapor that 
would condense to almost pure gasoline and it could be used in a motor car 
without refining• Calgary 1 s first oil boom developed, only to be curbed 

when World War I diverted finances and attention* Edmonton 1 s future supply 
of gas was also initiated in 1914 with the discovery of the Viking-Klnsella 
gas field which, however, was not connected to the city for another nine years

Calgary f s waning supplies from Bow Island were supplemented when Turner 

Valley came back strongly in 1924 with new gas and naphtha production on a 

scale sufficient to start a second and longer stock market boom in Calgary. 

The naphtha was much in demand* and the gas which had to be produced along 

with it was so far in excess of market demand that for "more than ten years 

more than 200*000*000 cubic feet of gas a day* enough to have supplied the 

12 

city of New York* was thrown away.* 1 

Following this second Turner Valley boom* no spectacular developments 

took place for another twelve years* although many small fields were discovered 

in scattered locations in addition to the development which continued in Turner 

Valley itself. During the five years from 192? to 1931* a total of 590*000 

feet of drilling took place in Turner Valley compared with 379*000 feet 

13 

drilled in all other parts of the Province. In the next five years* from 
1932 to 1936* Turner Valley maintained its predominance* although the econo¬ 
mic depression resulted in a reduction of drilling generally. In this period* 
223*000 feet were drilled in Turner Valley and 137*000 feet in the remainder 

of the Province. This included the discovery well of the heavy crude oil field 

14 

in Lloydminster.

based three oil booms on one field."^ Drilling down to 6,800 feet, over 
3,000 feet deeper than the 1924 discovery level. Turner Valley Royalties 
struck crude oil on the west flank of the Valley and began a new phase of 

16 

production involving "prolific quantities of oil with only a small gas flow." 

Because of this new development. Turner Valley*s domination of provincial oil 

production was even more firmly established* In spite of the fact that the 

Lloydminster field began to show significance in 1939, the period from 1937 

to 1941 saw 1,500,000 feet drilled in Turner Valley compared with 386,000 

17 

feet in all other parts of the Province* 

The 1942 - 1946 period can be described as the last period, in which de¬ 
clining Turner Valley dominated the Alberta petroleum scene. Expanding ac¬ 
tivity in other parts of the Province failed to produce enough additional, out¬ 
put to compensate for the yearly decline in the Valley, so that total oil pro¬ 
duction dropped steadily in each of the five years from the 1942 high point* 

War demands for oil encouraged authorities to approve maximum possible pro¬ 
duction, so that exhaustion of the field approached sooner than would have 

been the case if flow had been restricted to amounts ensuring maximum re- 

18 

covery from the reservoirs. 

Because of the decline in Turner Valley, operators began to regard 
other areas as having a more attractive future, and drilling activity shifted 
accordingly. Lloydminster, Wainwright, KinseHa and Medicine Hat fields ex-

At the end of 1946, a total of 1,440 wells had been drilled for oil and 
gas in Alberta, since drilling first began. Of these, 588 were oil wells, 
248 were classified as gas wells, and 604 were dry holes.^ 

In 1947, the discovery of the Leduc field ushered in a new era in the 
Province 1 s oil history. 

Where early discoveries were in the steeply dipping foothills, as in 
Turner Valley, or in lenticular sands of the Blaimore formation as 
at Wainwright, Lloydminster and vicinity, the occurrence of large flows 
of oil in a Devonian reef at Leduc gave an entirely new outlook on the 
habitat of oil in Alberta.21

Leduc potential was placed at more than 220,000*000 barrels, while the 

subsequent discoveries of Red water in 1946 and Golden Spike in 1949 added 

21 . 

another 850,000,000 barrels to the estimates. fhe footage drilled in 

1948 rose to 1,702,000, an amount exceeding that of any five year period in 
22 

Turner Valley. 

New discoveries of smaller fields followed in quick succession. For 

its 1949-50 fiscal year the Alberta government reported 1,973*000 feet 

drilled, an amount which was exceeded greatly in 1950-51 by a total of 

23 

3*359*000 feet. At the same time experimental separation techniques were 

being initiated in the bituminous sands along the Athabasca river near Me- 

Murray in an attempt to find a method of separating oil from the sards at a 

cost permitting competition with oil from other sources® 

In the series of exciting years following the Leduc discovery, 1954 

emerged with outstanding significance. Although there was a temporary lull. 

in footage drilled, the fields discovered or established in 1954 set the 

stage for a new upsurge in development activity. Nine new areas were added 

to the provincial picture as a result of initial discoveries the previous 
24 

year. These included the Pembina field in the Drayton Valley area which 
was established as having the greatest potential of all existing fields in 
Province. By 1956 it was estimated to have an area of 240,000 acres and a

potential of over a billion barrels* 

The renewed expansion of drilling after 1954 was only partly attributable 
to the Pembina development* New finds were made in both northern and south¬ 
ern parts of the Province* The first commercial quantities of oil were pro¬ 
duced in the Peace River country. Renewed activity north of Calgary, west 
of Olds and south-west of Turner Valley showed that southerly potential was 
by no means exhausted. 

Accessibility is a factor in future development. By 1956 the govern¬ 
ment was reporting that "with the exception of the Joffre development, dril¬ 
ling in the more readily accessible light oil fields of the province was com- 
pleted." The motivation to move into less accessible areas such as in 
Pembina and further north depends in turn on market demand for Alberta oil, 
which fell off significantly in 1957. 

However, there can be little doubt that as the oil-hungry world depletes 
its more readily available stocks of oil, that new don and for Alberta 1 s poten¬ 
tial will arise. Then, if not before, the vast sedimentary area of which 
Alberta is a part will be t he scene of new booms such as those which oc¬ 
curred in Turner Valley in 19X4* 1924 and 1936, in Leduc and Redwater in 
1947-48, and in the Pembina field in 1954. 

The extent of expansion brought on by the Leduc and Pembina discoveries

is indicated by the following statistics:

discovered in this field which was connected to Edmonton by pipeline 
in 1923* 

1916 - Foremost - gas was found* indicating the field which later was joined 

to the Bow Island line* 

1924 - Turner Valley - Royalite discoveries initiate major expansion* A gas 

line to Calgary was initiated* 

1925 — Wainwright - a heavy crude was found whose value was not fully ap¬ 

preciated until after World War II. 

1927-1929 - Skiff* Dina and Red Coulee - small oil fields begun. 

1932 - Del Bonita - a small oilfield closest to the southern border* 

1934 - Hoydminster - initial discovery of heavy crude* 

1936 - Turner V all ey - a new boom involving crude oil on the west flank of 

the Valley at nearly twice the former depth* 

1 937 - Taber - a small but productive oil field.

1947 - Leduc ~ a major discovery opening up a new era. 

1948 - Redwater - another major field. Leduc - expansion to Woodbend. 

1949 - Joarcam, Excelsior, Campbell, Bon Accord, Golden Spike, Stettler - 

a series of important oil and gas fields. 

1950 - Duhamel, Fenn Big Valley, Drumheller, Spring Coulee - all indica¬ 

tions of new expansion areas, 

1951 - Wizard Lake - an important southern extension of Leduc, also - 

Bonnyville, Glen Park, Armena, Namao, New Norway, and Peavey. 

1952 - Bonnie Glen and Westerose - two strong producing areas south of 

Wizard Lake, also Sturgeon Lake — later to become important. Others - 
Acheson, North Big Valley, South Camrose, Hamilton Lake, Maimo, Legal. 

I953 - Pembina - first discovery of the biggest field; Rimbey - thick oil 

zones and extensive wet gas; also Joffre, Erskine, Fairydell, Samson, 
St. Albert. 

1954 - Pembina - major expansion, proving a great potential; Little Smoky- 
showing advance in Peace River area; also Rocky Mountain House, Wayne, 
Glenevis. 

1955 - Sundre-VJestward-Ho - important new area with large reserves; also. 

Clear Hills, Gilby. 

1956 - Bellshill Lake and Bentley - strong reserves; Harmattan—Elkton - 

extended three times during the year; also Keystone, South Duhamel, 

Hespero* 

1957 - Castle River, Waterton Park, Gladstone - signs of a major gas field 

in this area. Also, Panther River, Lovett River* 

There is every indication that these yearly advances in the Province’s 
petroleum potential will continue if market conditions provide encouragement.

CHAPTER 3 

Provincial Administration of Oil and Gas Resources 


Alberta 1 s legislative machinery for dealing with the administration of 

provincial resources was developed to some extent before the transfer of the 

resources took place in 1930* The limited investment boom of 1914 in Turner 

Valley was said to have had some influence on the formation of the Board of 

1 

Public Utility Commissioners in 1915* More legislative interest was stimu¬ 
lated after World War I, during the controversies which developed over the 
question of returning the natural resources to the Province. In 1925 a Coal 
Commission appointed by the Alberta government made recommendations for es¬ 
tablishment of a Provincial Department of Mines* to be combined with an Ad- 
2 

visory Board. The Commission suggested that until the work of such a de¬ 
partment should increase in importance, the portfolio of the Minister of Mines 
could be combined with that of some other Department. 

The immediate chief function of the Department was suggested as being 
the assembling and publication of information, but expansion of functions 

was anticipated *’if and when the Province of Alberta obtains control of its 
2 

natural resources...” 

In addition to these activities and suggestions, Alberta had passed an 
Oil and Gas Wells Act in 1926, which was similar in many ways to the Oil 
and Gas Wells Act of 1931 which accompanied the transfer of the resources 
and the creation of the Department of Lands and Mines. Although the 1926 
Act conceded Dominion jurisdiction over the resources, it neverthless stipu-

lated its intent to "operate as to matters -which are within the exclusive 

3 

legislative jurisdiction of the Province of Alberta*” The need for such 
legislation had arisen because of the sudden expansion of the oil and gas 
industry in 1924* Nearly 500 wells had been drilled in the Province by 
the end of 1926* Such activity raised the question of defining roads and 
bourd aries, and such matters as prevention of property damage, which were 
provincial responsibilities. 

At the same time the Act went into great detail regarding measures for 
controlling drilling and production, and for conservation* These matters 
clearly were under Dominion jurisdiction, and the reasons for their in¬ 
clusion in the Provincial legislation are not clear* Undoubtedly there was 
room for conflict of authority under the circumstances prevailing, with the 
Dominion being responsible for the resources and the Province having its 
nnciihutional obligation to deal with property and civil rights* 

Under these conditions it would be difficult for either government to 

organize an efficient system of adninistration* However, the 1930 transfer 

of the resources to the Province r emoved this conflict of authority except 

4 

insofar as agreements made by the Dominion still prevailed* 

The session of the Alberta legislature immediately following the trans¬ 
fer of the resources on October 1, 1930, set up the Province f s Department 
of Lands and Mines* The Recommendation of the Coal Commission in 1925* that 
the Mines portfolio could be combined with that of some other Department,

was recognized to some extent by combining the newly acquired lands and 
mines under one Department* * R. G. Reid was named the first Minister of 
Lands and Mines* 

The Act setting up the Department set forth its general powers as 
follows: ^ 

Sub.iect to the provisions of the Public Service Act, the Department 
shall have the administration of such Acts relating to lands, mines, 
minerals, together with any royalties derived therefrom, and any 
other natural resources vested in or belonging to the Grown in the 
right of the Province as may from time to tme be assigned to the De¬ 
partment by any other Act of this Legislature or by the Lieutenant- 
Governor in Council, and shall have the administration and management 
of all lands, mines, minerals and royalties derived therefrom as are 
administered under any such Act* 

The Department was set up under one Deputy Minister, and had a Petro¬ 
leum and Natural Gas division. Provision was also made for an Advisory 

■S 

Board of three or more persons appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in 

6 

Council and called the "Natural Resources Advisory Board." Its functions 

were to act 

in an advisory capacity to the Minister for the purpose of furthering 
the administration and development of any of the natural resources of 
the Province, and shall undertake such inquiries and investigations as 
the Minister may from time to time direct* 0 

The Liberal opposition to the B.F.A* government criticized the failure 

to provide more than one Deputy Minister, arguing that there should be one 

for lands and one for mines* Premier Brownlee answered that "a director 

acting un der the Minister..* could supervise...as well as a Deputy Minister.

The opposition also criticized the appointment to the Advisory Board 
of personnel said to be insufficiently acquainted with all aspects of lands 
and mines, and special stress was laid on alleged deficiency in knowledge 
of coal problems# They objected to Dr. R. C. Wallace, president of the 
University of Alberta, being on the Board, on the grounds that he would not 
have enough time for both jobs# The Premier defended the personnel, paying 
special tribute to the chairman, Mr# R. J# Dinning "for his fine work in 
dealing with the coal situation 11 # He also praised Dr. Wallace as being "out- 

g 

standing in geology," and rejected the contention that the two occupations 
would be excessive. 

The new Department and the Advisory Board found the year 1931 to be 
somewhat confused because of the various problems arising from the transfer 
of the resources. By February of that year, the "larger portion" of the 
Qcminion f s oil and gas supervisory staff had transferred to Provincial ser¬ 
vice. The oil field operators continued the slowing down of development 
which had begun just before transfer, as they were apprehensive as to how 
severe the new regulations might be. The agricultural Committee of the 
Legislature held hearings on the situation in Turner Valley, and together 
with the Advisory Board, considered what legislation was needed to control 

what the Director of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Division called "this 

9 

colossal and unjustifiable waste." There was a misunderstanding which held 
up the transfer of records from Ottawa to Edmonton. Thus "it was only to-

wards the close of the fiscal year, (1931-32) ...that the administration of 

9 

this Department was set into easier motion." 

District offices of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Division were estab¬ 
lished in Calgary and Lethbridge, with a central office in Edmonton. This 
was done "so that operations in all parts of the Province could be more ef¬ 
ficiently controlled and operators given quicker assistance than had former- 
10 

ly been possible" when the Dominion supervised entirely from Calgary. 

The Edmonton office of the Division started with a staff of eight to 
record all drilling and production in the Province, and, of "greatest im¬ 
portance", to examine all geological samples, recording and correlating 
them so that results could be made available to operators. Inspections of 

the oil and gas fields were also initiated, to detect faulty drilling and to 

11 

ascertain the circumstances leading to abandonment of wells. 

The new Department of Lands and Mines was given authority to deal with 
the oil and gas situation when the legislature passed the 1931 version of 
the Oil and Gas wells Act. It applied to all oil and gas wells, regardless 
of when they may have been drilled. Section 3 of the Act contained 26 sub¬ 
sections listing the powers given to the Department. These included licens¬ 
ing, bonding to ensure compliance with regulations, control of well locations, 
drilling methods, tools, equipment, structure of wells, records, reports, pro¬ 
duction, inspection, conservation, and "any other matter reasonably ineiden- 

12 

tal" to drilling or developing wells.

In view of the complex techmmcal knowledge required to administer 

such controls, and because legal aspects were involved, the legislature in 

1932 set up a specialized Board to put the Oil and Gas Wells Act provisions 

into effect* This was called the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, 

which was to consist of not more than three persons, appointed by the 

13 

Lieutenant-Governor in Council. 

This Board was thus an executive authority rather than a consultative 

body as was the case with the Advisory Board. Its purpose was to effect 

conservation and to use "negotiation”..."to bring about unified operation 

14 

of wells in the area by means of pooling or otherwise.” Specifically 
included in the Board 1 s powers were investigation and testing of wells, 
closing down of wells, prescription of working pressures, volume of pro¬ 
duction, and measurement of the value of each well f s output. It could levy 
a penalty of not over $500 and costs for disobedience of its orders, plus 
$100 for each day that the offence continued. 

The authority of the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board was termi¬ 
nated in 1933* and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Division of the Depart¬ 
ment of Lands and Mines took over the supervision of the wells® Reports do 
not specify the reasons for this change, but the circumstances indicate 
possible reasons. Special emphasis was placed on the Board ? s function as 
a negotiator, and in this it was unsuccessful. Not only were the Board f s 
recommendations protested publicly by some operators, but litigation was 
incurred over the regulations for curt ailment of flow. At the same time.

the Department was still perturbed by gas losses and falling pressures in 


the fields and saw "...ample evidence that further curtailment is impera¬ 
tive*. .” ^ Under these conditions it was not unreasonable that the De¬ 
partment might wish to try dealing through its Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Division rather than through the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board* 

This method of administration continued until 1938, when the Petro¬ 
leum and Natural Gas Conservation Board was set up as part of a new Oil 

16 

and Gas Conservation Act* This Board was to consist of not over three 

persons appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in Council* The members 

were to have no monetary interest in any phase of oil production. Their 

general powers were stated to be the keeping of records, the appointment 

of officials, the making of inquiries, and the controlling and regulating 

of petroleum production. This Board 1 s powers were more elaborate and more 

final than those specified for the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board. 

In the making of regulations for the industry it could negotiate agreements, 

17 

or use "other factors” in "uncontrolled discretion.” 

It was these powers and the reaction which they caused among some 

operators that caused the McGillivray Commission, set up by the government 

in October, 193G, to question the "dictatorial powers” held by the Board* 

The Commission held the view that the Board ”is given a free hand, subject 

to the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council, to control and regu- 

18 

late the production of petroleum in such fashion as it may see fit.”

The Commission argued for more detailed declaration of policy by the legis¬ 
lature rather than giving such powers to a 11 statutory body”. They asked 
for the repeal of the Oil and Gas Wells Act, 1931* and of the 0^1 and Gas 
Resources Conservation Act, 1938. Also they recommended discarding of all 
regulations made under these Acts, and substitution of more acceptable regu¬ 
lations. However, perhaps owing to the war emergency which took the 
emphasis away from conservation and put it on maximum production, the Acts 
in question remained in effect until 1950. The two Acts were then consoli¬ 
dated into the Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act, 1950, with the main 
incentive for the adjustment being the new situation created by the Leduc 
and Redwater developments. Even then, the powers of the Conservation Board 
were not reduced except insofar as the legislation itself laid down more of 
the regulatory details. 

The great expansion following the Leduc and Redwater discoveries also 
produced changes in the Department of Lands and Mines, itself. Not only was 
it felt that the volume of administration was now too great for one Depart¬ 
ment, but the new emphasis on petroleum and natural gas created a sharper 
difference in the kind of administration as between minerals administration 
on the one hand and lands on the other. 

Accordingly, in 1948, the Department of Lands and Mines Act of 1931 was 
repealed. The Department of Lands and Forests Act, and the Department of 
Mines Act set up the two new Departments with those names. In 1949* the De¬ 
partment of Mines was renamed the Department of Mines and Minerals, since 
the term "Mines” was felt to be inadequate in connection with the production 
of petroleum and natural gas. 

At first the Departments were under one Minister, the Honorable N.E.

Tanner, 'who had a Deputy Minister for each Department; John Harvie as 
Deputy Minister of Lands and Forests, and I.N. McKinnon as Deputy Minister 
of Mines and Minerals. However, when Mr. Tanner retired from the position 
in 1953> it was felt that a replacement of less experience would find the two 
Departments to be an excessive load. Therefore, the Honorable Ivan Casey was 
made Minister of Lands and Forests, while Premier Manning added Mines and 
Minerals to his own portfolio. 

In the Department of Mines and Minerals, the Minister has directly under 

his jurisdiction the Deputy Minister, the Solicitor and the Statistician. 

Under the Deputy Minister are the Accounts, Mineral Rights, Mineral Tax, Mines, 

19 

Technical and Geophysical sections. The Petroleum and Natural Gas Conser¬ 
vation Board is an autonomous body appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor in 
Council, but responsible to the Minister of Mines and Minerals for administra¬ 
tion. This is also true of the Right of Entry Arbitration Boards, which also 
has three members, and is authorized to settle disputes between owners of sur¬ 
face rights and owners of mineral, rights when the latter desire entry on such 

, 20 

surface rights for the purpose of exploiting the minerals. 

The administration of Alberta 1 s oil and gas resources has thus achieved 
a relatively stabilized form after two decades of adjustments in the light of 
experience and under the pressure of abruptly changing conditions.

CHAPTER 4 


Concepts of Conservation and Proration 
In order to appreciate fully what is involved in conservation and pro¬ 
ration as the terms are applied in the petroleum and natural, gas industry, 
it is necessary to review briefly the techniques which must be employed in 
order to obtain the product from its underground reservoirs. 

As indicated in the previous chapter, oil and gas are found where 
underground reservoirs of impermeable rock are created in an inverted bowl 
configuration as a result of various folds, faults, or contour variations 
which have occurred in that rock. These reservoirs must be located over 
porous sedimentary rocks containing petroleum. By means which are still the 
subject of geological discussion, the petroleum rises through the porous rock 
until it is stopped by the impermeable rock and is thereby trapped in the 
reservoir at a higher level than accompanying water. 

The first problem, therefore is to locate such reservoirs having petro™ 
leum potential. Since they rarely show any surface indication of their exis¬ 
tence, it is necessary to obtain an idea of the underground rock contours; 
the alternative being to drill haphazardly, which has proved, to be a costll 

and generally unrewarding process. When surface indications exist, they 

1 

may be in the form of significant surface rock contours, or may appear as 
seepages of escaped oil which can lead to location of the reservoir when 
soil analysis reveals the concentration areas of petroleum in the soil. 

Underground contours may be estimated by analysis of sub—surface rock 
exposed in mines, water wells, oil wells or experimental drilling. Greeter 
accuracy to greater depths has been obtained by seismograph, which involves

exploding charges at shallow levels, and measuring the speed of shock waves 

2 

by refraction or reflection, the rock contours being indicated by the fact 

that the shock waves have variations in speed at different depths and 

through different kinds of rocks, and that various rock layers send back 

individual reflected shock waves to the surface, so that the depth of the 

layer may be calculated by the time taken for the reflected wave to return. 

Also used to map underground layers are the gravimeter, the megneto- 

3 

meter, and the electric current. The gravimeter measures minute differen¬ 
ces in gravitational pull caused by variation in rock density. The magneto¬ 
meter measures the variation in magnetic pull which occurs between dif¬ 
ferent types of rock. An electric current can indicate formations by per¬ 
mitting contrast of current flow through the varying resistances of different 
strata, to a theoretical flow through a homogeneous medium. 

Aerial stereoscopic photography has played a part in geological surveys 
by making possible accurate surface relief maps over large areas. Rock out¬ 
crops with underground significance have been detected by this method even 
in Alberta, which "is covered by glacial drift that masks the character and 

attitude of the underlying rocks save where streams and rivers have cut 
4 

through. 11 

Scientific surveys have done much to reduce the percentage of dry holes. 
But in this connection "the increasinly favorable ratio of productive wells

to dry holes” may have been caused partly by ”the increasing percentage of 
all wells which have been put down in proved reserves. That is, there may 
have been a smaller relative number of true wildcats in recent years. 

However, some indication of Alberta*s'gain through better surveys 
can be obtained by comparing periods of somewhat similar concentration in 
proved areas. Drilling prior to 1946 was mostly concentrated in the proved 
area of Turner Valley,^ and resulted in dry holes being 40.9$ of well com¬ 
pletions. After 194S, drilling became concentrated in Leduc and Pembina 

areas, but by 1955, dry holes represented only 20.3$ of wells completed in 
n 

the Province. Many variables are involved, but the marked improvement in 
the latter period was due in part to the improvement in scientific survey 
which took place in the Province after World War II. A Survey in the United 
States dealing only with wildcatting, or exploring in new areas, concluded 
that 

From 1937 to 1942 one out of every six wildcat wells drilled on tech¬ 
nical information discovered an oil pool, 'whereas only one out of 

eighteen wildcat wells that were drilled without technical advise dis¬ 
covered oil.® 

9 

The cost of geophysical work is high, but costs of well drilling vary 
from $30,000 in parts of United States^ to approximately $100,000 in Alber¬ 
ta. Thus the avoidance of wildcat failures on the scale indicated above 
would make the survey expenses well worth while.

Concepts of conservation involve not only exploration techniques and 
the accompanying costs, but also the mechanics and techniques of recover¬ 
ing oil and gas once it has been located. 

The oil and gas has to be lifted several thousand feet either by the 
gas or water pressure in the reservoir or by mechanical means* The latter 
may include pumping water, air, or gas back into the strata to supplement 
the natural pressure. 

Maintenance of production by the natural pressure is the least costly 
and simplest method of recovery. And this maintenance of natural oil re¬ 
covery. is related to the rate of flow that is permitted. If unrestricted 
flow is permitted, more gas per barrel of oil will emerge than if flow is 
restricted. This may also occur if the rate of flow is too small. 

Maintenance of a rate of production in excess of or less than that 
which yields a minimum gas-oil ratio results in a smaller ultimate 
recovery of oil than might have been attained had the most efficient 
rate of production been maintained. 11 

The above situation develops chiefly when "natural gas is the princi¬ 
pal expulsive agent.” When advancing water provides the main pressure, ex¬ 
cessive production rates may cause "irregular encroachment of edge water” 
which will cause "reduced ultimate recovery. 

Other causes of reduced recovery include; failure to exclude water which 
can seal off drainage channels; improper spacing of wells so that seme oil 
areas are not drained, or so that reservoir pressure is reduced uneconomi- 

cally; and failure to apply the most efficient methods of secondary methods 

12 

such as repressuring or water flooding.

From the point of view of the geologist, the petroleum engineer, or 
the oilfield accountant, the goal of conservation might be to reach the 
maximum efficiency which technical knowledge would permit in all of these 
matters pertaining to the mechanics and costs of finding and producing 
petroleum. There are, however, other considerations in conservation be¬ 
sides reducing losses of the product to the technological minimum. To 
cover all aspects, the general terms "wisest use" or "the greatest use to 
the greatest number over the greatest length of time" are used. These are 
not adequate terms by which to define conservation, since they mean dif¬ 
ferent things to different observers, and furthermore they are to some ex¬ 
tent contradictory. 

Neither can conservation take into consideration all the factors by 
which man judges his relations with the environment. Customs, taboos, re¬ 
ligions, and other attitudes enter into the value judgements of societies. 

An example is the loss of resources accepted by the people of India in pre¬ 
ference to challenging the sacredness of the cow. A definition of conser¬ 
vation which attempted to include all such factors would hardly reach a sah_ 
isfactory degree of precision. 

Complete avoidance of "waste” is not necessarily essential in conserva¬ 
tion. Petroleum and natural gas ha&e remained sealed under the rocks for 
millions of years, and could remain there for the foreseeable future without 
significant deterioration or loss. To avoid "waste", in the sense of worth¬ 
less dissipation of the oil or gas, is therefore possible by leaving these 
products in their reservoirs* This, however, would seriously reduce the 
satisfactions of the society deprived of the products. On the other hand, 
to drill wells without restraint and to operate them at maximum capacity

without regard to future effects is a procedure inviting maximum losses of 
a limited resource. Good conservation policy will seek a point of maxi mum 
utility somewhere between these two extremes. 

Conservation may actually involve accepting scxne losses, if such los¬ 
ses cost more to eliminate than to accept. Such would have been the case 
if use had been made of the gas flared in the early years of Turner Valley 
development. The resources required to convey this gas to scattered markets 
in an undeveloped country would have far exceeded the value of the gas lost. 
The alternative at the time would have been to leave the naphtha in the 
ground until industry and population were sufficient to utilize most of the 
gas which accompanied the naphtha. Such a delay might have had the effect 
of retarding the growth of industry and population. This is similar to the 
example given of a community which, by depleting its local ground water re¬ 
serves, was thereby enabled to develop so that it could afford to acquire 

distant surface water in abundance. Maintaining the local resource might 

13 

have permanently stunted the growth of the community. Similar considera¬ 
tions were involved in the long range development of Alberta and its gas re¬ 
sources. 

There is also the question as to whether the Alberta people, during the 
early stages of the oil and gas development, should have been deprived of 
the naphtha and gas which they did use, in order to conserve more of the 
stock for future generations. The answer involves the fact that the value 
of such resources is related to the supply of alternatives. Water power, 
synthetic oil and nuclear energy are examples of actual or potential com-

petitors to petroleum. They make it necessary to consider the likeli¬ 
hood that future generations will place a reduced value on petroleum. This 
in turn would justify increased present use at the expense of future sup¬ 
plies. 

Such factors, which are difficult to estimate accurately, together with 
many more tangible considerations, must enter into the calculations of con¬ 
servation planners, whether they are operating from the standpoint of private 
or of public interests. 

Both private and public planners must consider the effects of use rates 

in one interval upon use rates in subsequent intervals. Both must discount 

future values to the present, t aking into consideration such factors as 

markets, interest rates, and other costs of production. 

The flow of net revenues extending over time...and the value of physi¬ 
cal assets at the end of the planning period must be considered...Thus 
we may formulate the optimum state of conservation...as that time dis¬ 
tribution of use rates that maximizes the present value of the flow of 
(expected) net revenues.^ 4 

For both private and public planners, the possibilities of reaching 
this optimum are reduced by errors in appraisal of the environment and of 
markets and costs. Both will seek to compensate for such uncertainties by 
seeking flexibility in spreading risks, pooling costs, and generally attempt¬ 
ing to ,f avoid immoderate losses - although of small probability - by accept¬ 
ing the possibility of moderate ones - although the latter are more probable.* 
Here, a loss is considered "immoderate 1 * if it "threatens the continuity of a 
production plan.**

The foregoing considerations - the point of maximum utility between 
no production and unrestrained production; the losses which it would be un¬ 
economical to eliminate; the relation of present practices to future growth; 
and the possible development of economical alternatives to a resource- are 
all concerns of both public and private conservation. But the social 
planners must take into consideration more complex factors which may either 
re-inforce private objectives, or may in some cases conflict with them. 

The social planners must have regard for such extra-market factors 
as public opinion, the pressure of special groups, and the stability of 
the society. 

Equally from the social standpoint it might be preferable to suffer 
a petroleum loss which the engineer says is avoidable, than to dis¬ 
regard the principles of equity and fair play on which our social sy¬ 
stem is founded. & 

Modifying the private concept of revenues and costs by consideration 

of these added factors would justify the assertion that the objective of 

the social planner 1 s conservation policy ”eould formally be defined as that 

17 

state of conservation which maximizes social net revenues over time.” 

Market values are often used as auxiliary calculations in arriving 
at this social evaluation, but the effects of monopolistic conditions ”re¬ 
strict the validity of ary argument for or against a particular conservation 

18 

policy if the criteria are existing market values.” In other words, mar¬ 
ket values arrived at through the action of free competition are more IdJkely

to reflect the desires of socity than are the more arbitrary valuations 
■which may be set under monopolistic conditions* 

However, catering to the immediate desires of society may not be synony¬ 
mous with the maximizing of social net revenues over time* In fact this con¬ 
cept is made up of so many factors and variables that its definition is cer¬ 
tain to be elusive* It has been suggested that the social planner cannot 

allow the objectives of irrational customs to enter Into his conservation 
19 

criteria# On the other hand it has been conceded that he cannot ignore 
public opinion and the stability of the society, as indicated by the unre¬ 
stricted production which was permitted in Alberta fields during World War 
II* It is thus difficult to differentiate between these criteria* Their 
validity is restricted even as is that of market value calculations* ”Max- 
imizing social net revenues over time” cannot be made a precise definition 
of conservation* 

It has also been said that ,f *#*a iafe minimum standard of conservation 

is essentially an increase of flexibility in the continuing development of 

society*” This implies that the primary objective is not the maintenance of 

any particular use rate, but ”*.*to maintain the economic possibility of 

20 

halting and reversing a decrease of flow or use.” flexibility” is cer¬ 
tainly one of the considerations facing the Alberta government in making 
estimates of natural gas reserves which should be kept in the Province under 
conditions where competitive fuels have great but unpredictable potential*

In view of the impossibility of defining conservation precisely, it 
may be as well to accept a simple statement such as "Conservation seeks to 

21 

insure to society the maximum benefits from the use of our natural resources", 
and then allow the deciding authority to assess the current conditions as 
objectively as possible, and from this to say what "maximum benefits” are 
and what action will achieve them* 

Another concept which we roust consider is proration, which has developed 
as a result of a conflict in outlook between some privc te and social object¬ 
ives. The basis of this conflict is the "Rule of Capture", which has been 
described as follows: 

If the whole pool is not under unified control of one operator or group 
of operators, the individual operator must regard oil and gas as a fug¬ 
itive resource...This means the resource can be "captured." — that is 
reduced to legal possession - by whoever gets there first and works 

fastest. 22 

To avoid the adverse economic effects of "Rule of Capture", conserva¬ 
tion policy makers usually attempt to convince operators of the advantages 
of putting the pool under unified control and of substituting proration for 
individual maximum production. 

Proration can be defined as "the limiting of quantity produced by each 

23 

operator to some fractional part of his total productive capacity..." The 
main factor which has made proration acceptable was the general excess of 
productive potential compared with available market outlets. By allowing 
each operator to have a prescribed shaee of the market, based on some formula

probably including well capacity, acreage drained, reservoir pressure, and 

24 

other factors, it is possible to curb destructive competition in market¬ 
ing and to stabilize prices. 

Some consider proration to be primarily a price-regulating device, 
but it is not likely to be used to maintain prices at illegitimate 
levels as long as controls are in the hands of agencies responsible 
to the consuming public.25 

Prorationing has become a conservation measure in addition to its func¬ 
tion as a market regulator. Regulating the rate of flow can take into ac¬ 
count the most efficient use of energy in the whole reservoir, which, as 

26 

has already been noted, results in higher ultimate recovery than would 

be the case with unrestricted flow. There is some restraint on excessive 

drilling, thus reducing capital costs and conserving reservoir pressure. 

Equity is more secure as competing operators obtain a fairer share of the 

27 

field 1 s total production. 

Proration has now evolved to the point where it clearly rests upon 
two thoroughly established principles-conservation and equity; and 
involves three procedures - curtailment of flow, rateable takings, 
and an adjustment of restricted flow to balance the measured re¬ 
quirements of the market. The plan is administered by means of a 
quota system by which it is sought to bring into accord the require¬ 
ments of waste prevention and market demand without violation of the 
dictates of equity.28 

Alberta 1 s McGillivray Commission, investigating the petroleum industry 
in 1940, concluded that proration without unit operation only mitigated and 
did not eliminate the evils of the Rule of Capture. Without unit operation

there was always the incentive for operators to drill excessively to pre¬ 
vent others from capturing oil on the boundaries of their territory. This 
leads to unnecessary capital outlay, and with a limited market reduces the 
allowables from each well in the field, thus making some less efficient 
wells uneconomical. 

...there will be over-drilling for oil and as a result there will be 
at all times a wholly unnecessary available supply of oil in a wholly 
unnecessary number of wells with a consequent wholly unnecessary cap¬ 
ital expenditure for offset wells and a wholly unnecessary production 
cost in relation to each well, to say nothing of the possible danger 
to wells from over-retarding of flow which may be the case when a 
great number of wells are prorated to a limited market demand.29 

The fact, however, that proration to limited market demand aids con¬ 
servation to the extent that it conserves reservoir pressure and puts sane 
restraint on drilling, indicates that in the case of a market which can 
absorb maximum production, the job of conservation under divided ownership 
will become more difficult. Under these conditions, only equity and en¬ 
gineering considerations indicate the need for restriction and smaller opera¬ 
tors are inclined to regard their equity from a short range view, feeling 

that they should be allowed maximum production in order to overcome their 

30 

capital costs and to make some immediate return on investment. 

The fact that such motivations prevailed in the first stages of Alberta 
development led to losses of gas in the search for naphtha, and many state¬ 
ments have been made regarding the "waste” permitted in this period. Upon 
examination, the term "waste” appears to be more complex than is commonly 
supposed. Early Alberta legislation did not define the term, a fact that

was criticized by the McGillivray Commission in its demands for more spe- 

31 

cific legislation. California legislation in 1915 prohibited "unreason¬ 
able and willful waste,” and defined this waste as blowing, releasing, or 

allowing gas to escape into the air, or producing gas in quantities exceed- 

32 

ing a "reasonable” ratio to the amount of oil produced. 

The question as to what release of unused gas is "unreasonable" in¬ 
volves the development of technical knowledge, facilities and markets. 

The more these factors are inadequate, the greater the percentage of escaped 
gas which might be called reasonable. As indicated in discussing conserva¬ 
tion, if technical knowledge is being applied as far as it has been developed, 
then even if production seems wasteful by later standards, the losses could 
not have been avoided at the time unless production was prohibited. This 
remedy could result in much greater w aste through impeding of industrial 
and social development. Similarly with facilities and markets, the inade¬ 
quacy of which in early stages made flaring of gas unavoidable if naphtha 
was to be obtained. 

In later Alberta legislation the term was defined with more accuracy 
as follows: 

"waste” in addition to its ordinary meaning, means "waste" as that 
term is understood in the oil and gas industry, and includes the 
underground, or surface loss through wasteful operations of oil or 
gas or of potentially recoverable oil or gass...^ 

The definition is then expanded to include the term "wasteful opera¬ 
tions", described as being those which "result or tend to result in reducing

the quantity of oil or gas ultimately recoverable from a pool under sound 

33 

engineering and economic principles.* 1 There is recognition of the fact 
that from the social point of view, other factors are involved beside en¬ 
gineering and economic principles, including public interest and public 
safety. For example, one "wasteful operation" is stated to be 

the escape or the flaring of gas, if it is estimated that, in the 
public interest and under sound engineering principles and in the 
light of economics and the risk factor involved, the gas could be 
gathered, processed if necessary, and it or the products therefrom 
marketed, stored for future marketing, or beneficially injected into 
an underground reservoir.34 

However, as noted in discussing conservation, the term "public interest 1 * 
is subject to such a variety of interpretations that it would be impossible 
to set down a complete definition of waste by which a planning authority 
would be left in no doubt as to the correctives required. Such being the 
case, the definitions above probably go as far as can be expected, leaving 
the less tangible aspects to be weighed and decided by the planners to the 
best of their ability.

CHAPTER 5 


Conservation Prior to 1947 

In the first decades of development in Alberta f s oil and gas fields, 
it has been estimated that less than one-fifth of the natural, gas withdrawn 
from the wells was utilized by gas consumers. From the beginning of produc¬ 
tion until March of 1935* 717,110,000 thousands of cubic feet (Mcf) were 
drawn and 614,050,000 Mcf of this were estimated to have been "wasted”.^ 

Judging by the definition of waste that had been introduced into 193B legi- 
2 

slat ion, the meaning was confined to the engineering aspect of the tern, 
referring to such things as "improper use of reservoir energy” and opera¬ 
tion of any well with an "inefficient gas-oil ratio". 

The Department of Lands and Mines attributed this loss partly to "waste- 
full practices” introduced by personnel from United States who were called 

in to help initiation of development in the Province, end partly to "the in- 

3 

adequacy of the regulations to cover work done on alienated lands," which 
referred to the legal situation whereby the Dominion was not able to en¬ 
force its conservation rules on lands given in subsidy. When the Province 
received the resources, its legal position was better in regard to these 
lands since constitutionally the provinces have control over property. At 

the time of the first Alberta legislation after the transfer, it was thought 

4 

that the Province "would have the legal, right to control all wells..." Sub-

sequent litigation confirmed this opinion* 

Insofar as the "wasteful practices" introduced from the United States 
are concerned several factors must be noted. In the nineteenth century. 

The United States was a world leader in petroleum production, and there¬ 
fore must have been in the front ranks as far as technical experience was 
concerned. Also, Canada was short of such technical experience because its 
oil development began later than did that of the United States. Therefore 
the advice from the United States was necessary to Canada, and it is doubt¬ 
ful if the quality of the advice could have been improved upon at the time. 

In these pioneering years, the emphasis was on production rather than 

5 

on conservation. This resulted in the establishment of the Rule of Capture, 
by which ownership of oil belonged to the one who captured it, even if it 
came from under a neighbour f s land. Competitive drilling led to excess pro¬ 
duction and premature exhaustion of reservoir pressures. It was only when 
the seriousness of this situation became evident that more concern developed 
as to the need for conservation. Even in 1939* referring to existing conser¬ 
vation procedures in Alberta, the McGillivray Commission observed that "Con¬ 
servation and Proration is in one manner of speaking in its infancy in this 

Province, and so it is not be be expected that in legislation, regulations, 

6 

or in Board policy there should have been perfection." 

It is true that as far back as 1909* the Canadian government had taken 
some action on conservation. In that year, a Commission of Conservation

was set up with twenty members in addition to the Minister of Agriculture, 

7 

the Minister of the Interior, and the Minister of Mines* Its powers were 
broad but general, involving "consideration" of all questions relating to 
conservation of resources, the collection and dissemination of information, 
and the framing of recommendations* Regulations required lessees to take 
"reasonable" measures to prevent loss of natural gas, with the penalty 

g 

being possible cancellation of lease* 

In view of the inexperience of both government and operators in the 
matter of the petroleum resources, there could hardly have failed to be a 
lack of clear understanding as to what constituted "reasonable" precautions* 
Therefore the alternatives were the acceptance of losses which would now be 
avoidable, or the neglect of petroleum development* 

In 1921, the Dominion repealed the 1909 Conservation Act, and replaced 
it with legislation empowering the Governor-General™in-Gouncil to make such 

orders and regulations as might be necessary to carry on and complete the 

9 

work of the Conservation Commission. 

The Commission on Conservation was abolished with the view, in part, 
of saving expenses and, in part, because of alleged interference with, 
or duplication of the work in other Departments*^ 

It is unlikely that such arguments would have prevailed if conservation 
had been regarded as a matter of relative importance. This minor role was 
not hard to understand insofar as Alberta 1 s Oil industry was concerned. The

brief Turner Valley boom of 1914 had faded out, and it was not until the 
revival of activity in 1924 that the basis was laid for new interest in 
conservation of petroleum and natural gas* 

Two years after the Alberta Department of Lands and Mines had been es- 
tablished in 1931* it had been able to acquire the records from the Dominion, 
and had studied the resources situation* It reported the urgency of adopt¬ 
ing new methods of conservation in Turner Valley, and offered proof of this 
urgency by noting the decline in naphtha production in Turner Valley. The 
Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board presented the following statistics to 
indicate the situation.

As an indication of the proportion of gas withdrawn which was marketed, 

it was estimated that in the period 1927-1933* fifteen percent of the total 

12 

gas withdrawn in Alberta was marketed. 

The rapid increase in the proportion of gas to naphtha after 1926 in¬ 
dicated that the time was rapidly approaching when the reservoir pressure 
in Turner Valley would be exhausted. This fact impressed the government 
some time before it received much consideration toy the private operators 
whose solvency depended on maintenance of unrestricted flow. In 1932, Dr. 

R.C. Wallace, President of the University of Alberta, told the legislature’s 
agricultural committee that "conservation action cannot be taken too quickly," 
and that he saw "no solution to the problem other than the pooling of the 

13 

whole field and profits distributed on a pro-rata basis". Two years later 

the government noted that the majority of operators were still not aware 

"that the best naphtha recoveries can only be secured by the maintenance of 

14 

high back pressures on wells..." 

Thus, from the beginning of Alberta’s control of the petroleum and gas 
resources, the government faced the situation in which the operators in 
Turner Valley were 

drawing on the common energy of the whole field, an energy without which 
naphtha recovery will be practically impossible. Entirely apart, therefor 
from the question of wastage of gas as a commodity of value, the conser¬ 
vation of that energy is a matter of vital importance to the field as a 
whole.15

The Department of Lands and Mines estimated that under these conditions, 

230 billion cubic feet of natural gas were flared in the period from October 

16 

1, 1930 to March 31* 1932, which amount was represented as twelve and a 
half years of consumption at the rates then prevailing* 

One of the factors involved in this flaring was the lack of adequate 
markets for the gas as compared with the markets for the naphtha. The argu¬ 
ment that the loss of gas was justifiable because of the value of naphtha 
obtained became less valid as the supply of naphtha itself became endangered* 

Another use for which this unmarketable gas could have served was the 
repressuring of the reservoirs by forcing the surplus gas back into the 
structures. This technique was first instituted in 1937-38, and if govern¬ 
ment or private research could have speeded up the application of the pro¬ 
cess, net benefits should have been considerable. Of course, "Secondary re¬ 
covery methods are usually more expensive than primary operations and have 
therefore been limited to the most promising areas," but the expense thus 
involved is so fully justified that the gas and air repressuring" is now 
(1950) in use in practically all producing states." In central Pennsylvania, 
production on some leases was increased 700 percent by gas drive, and the 
United States oil industry has estimated "that possibly as much as 5,000, 

17 

000,000 additional barrels of oil may be obtained by secondary recovery," 
which of course includes water injection. 

Excluding the possibility of using surplus gas for such repressuring, 
the Alberta planners had the choice between immediate acquisition of naphtha

with accompanying gas losses, or the long range preservation of the gas 

until markets were available* The latter consideration was in turn affected 

by the indefinite estimates of what the future reserves of gas would be in 

18 

relation to the Province’s requirements* 

It is now possible to see with better perspective the losses which 
were the concern of the Alberta government in these first years of provin¬ 
cial responsibility for the natural resources. The following table compares 

the gas withdrawn with gas marketed from the beginning of production until 
19 

the Leduc era began. The figures for the early years are only estimates, 
since metering of waste gas only began in 1933* and before that there was 
some unmetered consumption, as well as unrecorded losses due to poorly con¬ 
structed mains and wells.

bore some responsibility for gas marketed dropping to 15 percent of the 
total production, whereas the high demand developed in the 1941-47 period, 
mainly because of urban conversion to gas from coal, raised the proportion 
sold to 43 percent. Other factors involved in this improvement were develop- 
ment of population and industry, and advancement of techniques for repres¬ 
suring and underground storage of gas. 

Had the officials in the first years of the Department of Lands and 

Mines been able to forecast future development accurately, they would have 

20 

found that the 573,000,000 Mcf estimated to have been lost from the be¬ 
ginning of production to the end of 1933 represented just 7*6 percent of 
the 7*61 trillion cubic feet estimated c onsumption for the Province from 

1953 to 1938, or 2.75 percent of the 21 trillion cubic feet estimated to 

21 

be Alberta 1 s reserves in January, 1953. Thus losses that seemed immense 
at .first appeared much less significant when compared with the resources 
which the early activity helped to open up. 

However, it is quite understandable that the Alberta government taking 
over control of the resources in 1931 would take a more serious view of the 
situation than might seem justifiable today. In March 1932 the agricultu¬ 
ral committee of the legislature heard Dr. J. A. Allan, professor of geology 
at the University of Alberta, given an estimate of the seriousness of the 
situation in what was then the Province * s main oil and gas producing area. 

He warned that "under existing conditions, the life of the Turner Valley gas 
field would have a maximum of four years and probably not more than two years.

If no new factors had entered the situation* an extrapolation of the rising 

23 

gas-oil ratio indicated in Table 7 would have been a valid estimate and 
would probably have justified Dr. Allan 1 s conclusion. However* the field’s 
life was prolonged much further than his estimate* partly because the gover¬ 
nment did take corrective measures* and because new sources of oil and gas 
were found in the field at lower depths. 

In considering the measures which should be taken in view of the situa¬ 
tion as it appeared at that time* premier Brownlee pointed out that there 
were two courses open to the government. One was arbitrary legislation* 
which he suggested might involve delay through excessive litigation* taking 

into consideration the fact that a small group of independent companies 

24 

were opposing ff any scheme restricting present output.” The other was 
voluntary agreement among the operators and the government regarding censer- 
vat ion methods. 

To obtain voluntary agreement among the operators was by no means a 
simple matter. Some independent companies had* for example* drilled some 
gas and naphtha producers in the southern part of Turner Talley in 1929 and 
1930. They tried to get their gas processed by the absorption plant owned 
by the Royalite Company* the purpose being to obtain natural gasoline from 
the gas. Unable to deal with Royalite* the independents were organized into 
Gas & Oil Products* Ltd.* which erected a new absorption plant at the cost 
of nearly half a million dollar's on the assumption that ”th@y would be al¬ 
lowed to develop the property and operate the wells without restriction

(save as provided in the leases)....” 

Such an organization, having made its plans on the basis of operation 

"without restriction”, and seeing its competitive position against the 

larger companies jeopardized if conservation measures reduced output, 

naturally regarded voluntary agreements with some hostility. 

For Brownlee f s second alternative, that of "arbitrary legislation,” 

there was considerable scope for regulations under the Oil and Gas Wells 
27 

Act of 1931, and the Turner Valley Gas Conservation Act of 1932. The 
latter Act proposed establishment of conservation measures in Turner Valley 
by negotiating "to bring about unified operation of wells in the area by 
means of pooling or otherwise.” It also authorized the appointment of 
a Board with full powers to take conservation measures, including the im¬ 
mediate reduction of gas output in the Turner Valley area to an aggregate 
amount of not more than 200 million cubic feet of gas per day, and pre¬ 
scribing the daily rate of production for every well. 

It soon became necessary to apply the “arbitrary legislation” which 
Premier Brownlee had designated as being the least desirable alternative. 

On April 2, 1932, the Premier announced that voluntary negotiations to achieve 

29 

conservation had failed. As he had indicated earlier, many consumers want¬ 
ed conservation, but without any increase in the gas rates, and some inde¬ 
pendent companies were opposing any restricted output.

On May 4, 1932*. acting under the authority of the Turner Valley Gas 
Conservation Act, the Conservation Board issued Order Number One, limiting 
daily gas production in the field to 200 million cubic feet, and restrict¬ 
ing wells to a prorated allowance* The Board also utilized a staff of six 
engineers to continue and complete the tests begun earlier by the Petroleum 
and Natural Gas Division of the Department of lands and Mines* These tests, 
giving scientific evaluation of the condition of the field and the savings 
to be made through conservation techniques, were not only valuable in guid¬ 
ing the Board as to what future directives should be made under the Act, but 
also were of importance in educating the operators* For those whose annual 
costs could be met out of restricted production, a case could readily be de¬ 
veloped showing increased return on investment over the years as a result of 
greater recovery per well. 

Nevertheless, the restrictions brought forth litigation as the Premier 
had anticipated. Spooner Oils Ltd., and Richfield Oil Co. Ltd., both con¬ 
tested the Board * s injunctions. The companies lost both the preliminary 
cases and the appeals, except that the Board was not upheld in its attempt 
to deduct its expenses from the operators 1 income. 

By the following year, some improvement was noted in the operation of 
the field and in the attitude of the operators. 

Considerable expense has been incurred by the Government t© obtain all 
the data possible relating to Turner Valley conditions. The expense, 
however, was unavoidable, as the information could not have been col¬ 
lected in any other manner. It is satisfactory to note that justifi¬ 
cation for these efforts is now apparent by a slight improvement in 
operation. This would indicate that operators have realized that they 
would be the principal sufferers by a continuance of the wasteful 
methods....30

However, while the operations may have shown improvement, the accumu¬ 
lated effect of poorer procedures in the past, together with the Board f s 
restrictions on production, resulted in a considerable drop in oil output 

from Turner Valley, which is reflected in the decrease of 375,000 barrels 

31 

for the whole Province in 1932-33 as compared with 1931-32*' 

The deterioration of the field was regarded as being the main cause 

of the reduced output* 

The major portion of the decline*..must be classed as due to the in¬ 
creasing dryness of the gas obtained from the older operated wells, 
and fully confirms the necessity for operators being compelled to dis¬ 
cover methods of production which will reduce the waste and thereby 
prolong the naphtha producing life of these at present uneconomically 
operated wells.. .31A 

The Board f s testing program had arrived at an estimate of the gas re¬ 
serves in the Turner Valley field, disregarding the danger to the field 
from water encroachment, which they did not regard as b eing too serious. 
Assuming a pressure maintained at 400 pounds, the life of the field was 
estimated at seven years. The testing also analysed waste gas, concluding 
that much naphtha was not being recovered, but was being burnt along with 
the flared gas. 

The testing was by no means complete. Accurate data were still re¬ 
quired regarding the capacity and potential production of individual wells 
already drilled and of the reserves in undrilled acreages. The conservation 
measures adopted would unavoidably work more of a hardship on partially ex¬ 
hausted wells than on new ones. But continued testing would Improve the ac»

curacy and fairness of the control regulations to be developed• 

The Board was still investigating the acceptability of voluntary pool¬ 
ing schemes, but was not encouraged. 

The Board believes that conservation at the present time can be more 
readily effected through putting into effect a plan of proration of 
gas to be allowed to be produced in the whole field.32 

In accordance with this. Premier Brownlee introduced a resolution to 

the legislature restricting the gas flow in Turner Valley ,f as nearly as pos- 

sible to k0% of the total open flow of each weH.... ,f 

This percentage was estimated to produce a daily flow of 230,000,000 

cu. ft., and it was hoped to maintain a maximum daily flow of not over 

240,000,000 cu. ft. This represented a slight increase in the maximum sug- 
34 

gested in 1932. 

The following year, 1933-34, brought extended development of the Turner 

Valley field, and slight improvements were noted in efficiency of production. 

This was mainly due to the success of the Royalite absorption plant. But 

the government still noted much flaring by independents and argued that ,f the 

logical procedure would be to revert to the 25 percent allowable withdrawal. 

35 

as originally set out in the provincial regulations. 11 Since the indepen¬ 
dents took the opposite view, collective agreement was not forthcoming. 

In February of 1933, the authority of the Turner Valley Gas Conservation 
Board was terminated and its duties were taken over by the Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Division of the Department of Lands and Mines. The change was 
deemed necessary because the Board had not been successful in securing the

necessary co-operation from the operators, and because consistent policies 
of conservation were required in all the Province f s oil producing areas 
while the Board had been specifically assigned to Turner Valley, 

Production was up in 1933-34 in spite of falling Turner Valley pres¬ 
sure. The increase was due to drilling of new wells, a process which 

continued in the following year. During this period, the pressure fall in 

36 

Turner Valley averaged ,35 pounds per square inch per day* 

In the Bow Island gas field, gas for the first time, was successfully 
injected into depleted sands. More gas was handled by owners of absorption 
plants who were buying out independent producers. Thus less gas was being 
totally lost* 

In the year 1935-36, the repressuring of the Bow Island field had 

been continued until the pressure at the end of the fiscal year was up to 
37 

504 pounds. Also, the first large unitization scheme was completed on 
•the west flank of Turner Valley. 

The new government discontinued the quotas which had been in effect on 

gas withdrawals. ®*No penalties had ever been imposed for violation of quota, 

and as a result those who faithfully observed the quotas were put to a dis- 

38 

advantage by others who paid no attention to them. 1 ® 

The attitude of the operators toward voluntary conservation measures 
was improving. 

The opposition of many operators to any change in their methods nulli-

fled the vrork of the Board; (Turner Valley Gas Conservation Board, 
1932-33) however, with the completion of the Turner Valley Royalite 
crude oil discovery well in June 1936, the majority of the operators* • 
became conscious of the fact that speedy action was essential*.*39 

With drilling activity still mainly concentrated in Turner Valley, the 
production of oil and natural gas began a slow increase after reaching a 
low point in the year 1932-33* This trend could not be attributed entirely 
to new drilling, but must be credited to some extent to the improved tech¬ 
niques of repressuring and to improved facilities* 

Nevertheless, the new zone discovered in 1936 in Turner Valley, yield¬ 
ing a predominance of oil over gas, turned out to be another important mile¬ 
stone in the field 1 3 history* By 1937* production was exceeding the capa¬ 
city of pipelines to Calgary, and markets for refined gasoline were inade¬ 
quate for the supply available* Purchasers began to prorate their pur¬ 
chases using the previous month 1 s figures as a basis, but even this pro¬ 
cedure became ineffective to deal with the very rapid expansion of produc¬ 
tion* The new volume came as a result of the new wells and of the rate at 
which they were allowed to flow. 

It became evident from rising gas-oil ratios that sane wells were 
being produced at rates which would soon ruin them and which would 
result in terribly small ultimate recoveries as compared with what 
might be expected if production was restricted and carried out on 
the basis of orderly development.^ 

Prompted by these conditions, the Alberta government. In 1938, passed 
a comprehensive Oil and Gas Conservation Act, creating a Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Conservation Board with ^uncontrolled discretion 11 and power to

use any method to prevent exhaustion of fields* 

However, after discussing the problems with the United States Depart¬ 
ment of Mines, the Alberta government obtained some different concepts of 
conservation requirements, which resulted in a special session of the legis¬ 
lature being called in November, 193S* Here the Act of a few months earlier 

was repealed and re-enacted under the name of the Oil and Gas Resources Con- 
42 

servation Act# 

The November Act was more comprehensive and detailed than its prede¬ 
cessor# Once again it set up a Petroleum and Ndural Gas Conservation Board 
of not more than three persons, appointed by the Lieutenant-Governor-in- 
Council. Its general powers were to keep records, appoint officers, obtain 
services, make inquiries, control and regulate petroleum production# It was 
authorized to enforce regulations under the Oil and Gas Wells Act of 1931* 

It had power to inspect wells and refineries, to prohibit production, and 
to enforce its regulations by seizure# 

The Board did not content itself with occasional observations, but kept 
a continuous service, issuing new proration orders from time to time as 
v conditions changed. Thus, if the allowable for any well had been set 
higher than it should have been, falling bottom hole pressure and ris¬ 
ing gas/oil ratios would cut its next allowable and vice-versa#^ 

Some operators accepted and welcomed the Board * s prorationing, calcu¬ 
lating that long run returns would be greatly enhanced by the control# But 

for reasons already indicated, many independent operators strongly protested 

44

At this time the Alberta government’s views on the conservation situa¬ 
tion were summarized in a section of the brief presented by the government 
to the 1938 conference on Dominion-Provincial relations. 

Gas wastage in the Turner Valley has seriously depleted the gas re¬ 
serves in Alberta, and this can be attributed solely to the restric¬ 
tions imposed upon the province at the time of the transfer of the 
natural resources to Provincial control, which has prevented the Al¬ 
berta government inaugurating any scheme of conservation.^ 

Thus, besides stating that adequate conservation had not been pos¬ 
sible since 1930, the Alberta government was also implying that there had 
been a lack of conservation under Dominion auspices, and that the Dominion’s 
policies were continuing to put "restrictions” on the Province. This in turn 
was related to the fact that the Province was still legally bound to some ex¬ 
tent by the commitments that the Dominion had made before the transfer of the 
resources. 

The Natural Resources Transfer Agreement and amendments gave an indi¬ 
cation of the extent to which the Province had been restricted, and of how 
more freedom of action was attained. 

And whereas by paragraph 2, October 1, 1930 of the said Natural Resour¬ 
ces Transfer Agreement, the Province agreed that it would carry out, in 
accordance with the terms thereof, every contract to purchase, or lease 
any Grown lands, mines, or minerals and every other arrangement where¬ 
by any person had become entitled to any interest therein as against 
the Crown, and further agreed not to affect or alter any term of such 
contract to purchase, lease or other arrangement by legislation or 
otherwise, except either with the consent of all parties thereto other 
than Canada, or in so far as any legislation may apply generally to all 
similar agreements relating to lands, mines or minerals in the Province 
or to interests therein, irrespective of who might be parties there¬ 
to.46 

Since the Province was thus not restricted with regard to legislation

applying "generally to all similar agreements, TT it is difficult to follow 
the argument that the Alberta Government was thus prevented from "inaugura¬ 
ting any scheme of conservation." The difficulty increases in view of the 
fact that in its first years of administration the Province was not success¬ 
fully challenged in its legislation on strong conservation measures, nor in 
its implementation of repressuring and curtailment of flow. 

At any rate, in later additions to the Natural Resources Transfer A— 

47 

greement, such restrictions as did exist over provincial freedom of ac¬ 
tion were removed. 

Actually, it is probably more valid to say that the lack of satisfac¬ 
tory conservation measures to which the Alberta brief to the 1938 conference 
referred was predominantly due to inadequate assessment of accumulated con¬ 
servation experience and its application to the Alberta situation. The 
government itself indicated the validity of this viewpoint by its appoint¬ 
ment in 1939* of a Royal Commission under the chairmanship of the Honour¬ 
able Mr. Justice A. A. McGillivray, with instructions to undertake an ex¬ 
haustive examination of Albertans oil industry. The Commission worked for 
two years and turned in an extensive report. 

Regarding the conservation measures already taken, the Commission ex¬ 
pressed the following opinion: 

Certainly the conservation and proration schemes which have been brought 
to our notice cannot be said to have defeat©! the workings of the 
"Rule of Capture."^ Without doubt much has been done to mitigate the 
evils of that rule but it still stands with many economic ills result¬ 
ing from it. It is true that under a rule of proration to market, the

bringing of the oil to the surface of the ground may be retarded, but 
since the right to drill is in no wise altered, the opportunity of 
taking oil from underneath one’s neighbour’s land, is still open, even 
though the speed with which it is taken away be diminished* In short, 
the evils of the ’’Rule of Capture” still exist, minimized though they 
be, and it may be added that, under proration, they do harm in new 

ways*... ^-9 

The possible new ways of harm are then indicated as being the continued 
possibility of drilling to take oil from neighbouring concessions, the pos¬ 
sibility that maximum quotas under proration may not be sufficient to meet 
overhead costs, and the likelihood that the allowables may be reduced 
further as more wells are drilled. Also mentioned as harmful are the in¬ 
centives for individual companies to drill more than they normally would 
in order to prevent encroachment by others, and in order to q ualify for 
quotas to meet refinery requirements. The latter motive would arise because 
wells which formerly would have been adequate would no longer be so under 
the reduced prorated output. 

As a result of these factors, the Commission remarked that ”If it 
were possible to have an undivided pool under a single management, we would 
then have the ideal both from an economic and conservation viewpoint.”^ 
Stress was placed on the fact that over-production, leading to an ex¬ 
cess of supply over current demand, and also to decreased efficiency of 
wells, was undermining the economic structure of the industry. These fac¬ 
tors are seen as being ’’outstanding characteristics of the industry in times 
past” which have brought about ’’waste and economic chaos.” It is therefore 
concluded:

.♦that free competition and the so-called law of supply and demand would 
not have served, without government intervention to prevent shameful 
waste of a natural resource and to keep the industry itself from com¬ 
plete demoralization.51 

One of the causes of over-production was said to be the drilling re¬ 
quirements set forth in the leases. Royalties were dependent upon these 
drilling requirements being met. The effect of government policy seemed to 
be the encouragement of drilling without sufficient regard for market re¬ 
quirements and the consequent effect on prices and costs. 

Another cause of over-production indicated was, of course, the "Rule 
of Capture," by which oil ownership is only recognized when possession is 
obtained, thus encouraging attempts to drain oil from areas where the sur¬ 
face is leased to others. 

The Commission saw government conservation and proration as being only 
a parts! solution in fields of divided ownership. Most desirable was the 
operation of the pool as an undivided unit, together with government co¬ 
ordination between the different pools "with a view not only to the stabili¬ 
zation of the economic structure of the industry, but also to the creation 

52 

of reserves which are held as such." 

However, the Commission regarded Turner Valley as being a situation 
where it was impractical to enforce unit operation, due to the diversity of 
surface ownership® Since each field, each section and each well have diffe¬ 
rent characteristics, the value of the pool allocable to any surface sec¬ 
tion is difficult to agree on, even with only two or three operators in a 
field. With a larger nunber of producers, "the difficulties of a voluntary

Therefore the Commission felt that in Turner Valley the government 
should attempt to foster breadth of vision among the operators to make pro- 
ration effective. 

In the case of new pools being discovered, unit operation was recommend¬ 
ed. In such cases, leasing of the pools could be done in such a manner that 
e ^icient withdrawal would not conflict with the interests of individual pro¬ 
prietors to the extent that it did in existing production situations. 

It was felt that there investment had. already taken place, some in¬ 
efficiency was preferable to excessive interference with the rights of the 
proprietor®. Thus the Commission was giving recognition to the social fac¬ 
tors which should be included in a maximum conservation formula. ^ 

The early hostility of the operators toward the restrictions of the 
Conservation Board prompted the Commission to recommend that the conserva¬ 
tion and proration authorities should not be given unlimited powers. It was 
recommended that the Legislature should define waste and other factors in¬ 
volved in the general policy. Furthermore, the powers of the Board should 
be stated specifically, as should the steps required to institute appeals. 

With these recommendations in mind, the Commission felt that the Oil 
and Gas Wells Act, 1931* Chapter 46 , and the Oil and Gas Resources Conserva¬ 
tion Act, 193S# Second Session, Chapter 1, were unsatisfactory in that both 
Acts gave "dictatorial powers.In the former Act, these powers are given

to the Lieut enant-Governor-in-Council, while the 1938 Act puts the autho¬ 
rity in the hands of the Petroleum and. Natural Gas Conservation Board* 

The opinions of the operators are suggested by the following quota¬ 
tion from the brief to the Commission submitted by Gas and Oil Products 
Limited: 

•..the conduct of the Conservation Board has not been that of a quasi¬ 
judicial body, but rather that its conduct has been arbitrary, un¬ 
reasonable, and in complete disregard of the principles of equity, and 
contrary to good engineering opinion. 

The charge of disregarding the principles of equity was based on the 
argument that many wells could not operate on the low output set by the 
Board, and that wells thus closed down would enable other concerns to draw 
off more than their share of the gas if the gas had free movement under¬ 
ground. The company, however, was more inclined to argue that the gas did 
not have free movement underground, and that therefore there was not suffi¬ 
cient justification for treating the field as a single pool, and hence no 
need to cut production to such an extent in the company 1 s wells. 

The Conservation Board did not answer these statements before the Com¬ 
mission, so it is difficult to obtain a balanced assessment of the particu¬ 
lar cases involved. However, there has never been an unprejudiced argument 
that denied the need for restriction of maximum flow in order to obtain maxi¬ 
mum recovery over time. Such restrictions cannot avoid adverse effects on 
marginal producers. It would be extremely unlikely that any responsible 
governing body could jeopardize the social equity in order to maintain that 
of such producers. 

The Commission, however, seemed to feel that regardless of the validity

of the Board»s rulings* there should be closer consultation with the in¬ 
dustry in the drafting of the regulations and better opportunity for appeal* 
Accordingly it recommended that the Oil and Gas Wells Act of 1931 aid 
the Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act of 1938 be repealed and the regu¬ 
lations issued under than be discarded* It was felt that a new Act should 
be drafted by special counsel familiar with the petroleum industry* and that 
regulations should be handled by a three-member Board representing the con¬ 
sumers* the industry, and also taking into account engineering* accounting 
and legal opinion* 

In spite of these recommendations* only minor changes were made in 

1941 to the Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act* The most important a- 

mendments dealt with re-ad jusfcment of the taxes which could be levied by 

the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board on mineral properties* to 

57 

meet the expenses of the Board.*' 

However seme Commission viewpoints were incorporated in The Unit Opera¬ 
tion ©f Mineral Resources Act* 1941* which authorized the Minister of Lands 
and Mines to enter into agreements with owners of minerals for development 
of such minerals together with those owned by the Province* A unit plan was 

provided for* with both the private owners and the Province joining in the 

58 

expense of the development and in the accruing benefits* 

In the same year* the Provincial government moved to increase further 
its independence of the Dominion by ratifying an amendment to Section 2 of

the Province to exercise a larger measure of control over petroleum and 
natural gas leases in the interest of orderly development and conserva— 
tion. 59 

This was followed in 1942 by a new and comprehensive Act designed to 

consolidate and expand the provisions of the Oil and Gas Wells Act of 

1931* Far from dissolving the "dictatorial powers" described by the Me— 

Gillivray Commission, this Act confirmed and ratified all acts of the 

60 

Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board under the 1931 Act, 

Further agreement with the Dominion was also reached in 1942 and duly 
ratified by the Legislature, The purpose of this agreement was stated to 
be the extension of the jurisdiction of the Legislature over contracts to 
purchase and lease petroleum and natural gas, subject to certain conditions 
and restrictions as to the royalty to be collected. The extension of the 
provincial jurisdiction was indicated in the following addition to para¬ 
graph 2 of the 1930 Natural Resources Transfer Agreement in whx h the Pro¬ 
vince agreed to carry out the terns of agreements made prior to 1930, and 
not to alter then except with the consent of all concerned: 

Provided, however, that the provisions of this paragraph shall not ap¬ 
ply to any contract to purchase or lease petroleum or natural gas or 
to any other arrangement whereby any person prior to the first day of 
October one thousand nine hundred and thirty, had become entitled tg^ 
any interest in such petroleum or natural gas as against the Grown! 1 

Thus the right of the provincial government to regulate the petroleum 

industry emerged unchalleng ed. But by the 1944 session of the Legislature,

losses were still considered to be serious enough to justify a new Act 
called the Natural Gas Utilities Act, the purpose of which was stated to 
be the prevention of wastage of natural gas and the ensuring of equitable 
distribution. The Minister of Lands and Mines, the Honourable N. E. Tanner, 
stated that the Act "will require gas produced but not needed at the present 
time to be returned to the structure for future use." 

Section 3 of the Act set up a Natural Gas Utilities Board comprising 
two members, one being the chairman of the Board of Public Utility Goramis- 
sioners, and the other the chairman of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Con- 
servation Board. ^ 

With reference to this Act, the statement was made that loss of natural 
gas in Turner Valley had been due to the fact that "one producing company 
enjoyed the exclusive rights to supply the natural gas markets.Under 
the Act, all natural gas wells were now considered to be public utilities, 
and their marketing therefore to be under the authority of the Board of 
Public Utilities Commissioners, whose chairman was also chairman of the new 
Natural Gas Utilities Board. 

The latter Board was to have power to deal with all public utilities 
as defined by the Act, including pipe lines, scrubbing plants, and wells 
or plants producing natural gas. For its duties it was given "all such 

6 

power, rights and privileges as are vested in the Supreme Court of Alberta," 
thus facilitating such natters as enforcing orders, inspection, and examin-

ing witnesses. 

In spite of the efforts of these Boards and the legislation and regu— 

lations which they had at their disposal, Alberta petroleum production de- 

66 

dined from 1941-42 until 1947* Maximum conservation from a technical 
or engineering standpoint could not be maintained under wartime condi¬ 
tions when greatest .possible immediate production was required. Indeed, 
this was a clear example of a situation in which social and political con¬ 
siderations dominated the technical aspects in conservation policy. 

For a time, the exhausting effect of the wartime production methods 

6 ? 

could not be overcome even by ”an enormous exploration program,” the ex¬ 
tent of which can be judged by the following table. In this connection it 
should be noted that prospecting reservations refer to the areas granted to 
groups or individuals for prospecting purposes, which from 1941 to 1947 was 
set at a maxim um area of 200,000 acres per reservation, with a maximum of 
three reservations to any one person at a time. Drilling reservations were 
areas within such prospecting acreages on which the individual or group ap¬ 
plied for and was granted drilling rights. In this same period, ”The number 

of acres to be included in a group for drilling” had a maximum of 19,200 

68 

acres.

x First classified apart from prospecting reservations in 1943-44. 

At the close of the year 1945—46.* the active drilling reservations* 
as opposed to those which showed no operations* constituted 43*915 acres* 
while the active prospecting reservations totalled. 4* 595*311 acres. This 
meant that over 40 percent of the land held for drilling had such activity 
under way* while over 90 percent of the prospecting reservations were being 
worked. 

This activity* combined with the geological and geophysical knowledge 
which had been accumulated over the years, made it certain that sooner or 
later the vast new fields which Alberta possessed would be discovered. In 
February of 1947* the first well of the Leduc field blew in* an event which 
was to shift the emphasis of development and exploration from the southern 
to the northern part of the Province* and which reversed the conditions of 
gradually declining production into a phase of rapid expansion. 

As might be expected* the new expansion brought new problems and oppor¬ 
tunities in the field of conservation.

CHAPTER 6 


Post-Leduc Conservation and Proration 
The era opened up by the Leduc discovery in 1947 was destined to dwarf 
the achievements of the Turner Valley period, and to put Canada on the road 
to self-sufficiency and to export in petroleum products. The effect of the 
Leduc-Calmar production and the subsequent development in Red water in the 
first two years is indicated by the following production statistics:

The sharp rise in production continued each year until 1956, when a 

2 

total of 043,910,000 barrels were produced in Alberta/ Decreased market¬ 
ing in 1957 reduced production allowables to 137,492,000 barrels valued to 
the producer at $356, 744,000* 3 

As the Leduc—Galmar field expanded rapidly, and new discoveries were 
made at Woodbend and Red water, the need, was felt to review, consolidate 
and improve existing legislation concerning petroleum and natural gas* A 
first step in this direction was appointment in November, 1948, of a Natu¬ 
ral Gas Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. R. J. Dinning. 

In reviewing the situation with regard to conservation, the Commis¬ 
sion felt that the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board had achieved 
commendable results In comparison with those achieved in the Turner Valley 
period. It was recognized that flaring of gas, especially in the discovery 
and early production phase of a field, cannot be altogether avoided economi¬ 
cally. Market conditions were felt to be a major factor in determining 
what conservation costs could be justified. 

At the time, market outlets were readily available, and this, combined 

with other factors such as efficient storage and repressuring techniques, 

led the Commission to the conclusion that gas losses should be "eliminated” 

4 

in the near future. Because of the value of the liquids contained in gas, 
it was felt that the producing companies could not afford to flare such 
gas, but instead would process it for the liquids and then either market

the residual gas or return it to the reservoir for selling when markets 
became available* In the latter case it was not expected that shrinkage 
would exceed fifteen percent* 

The Commission report included a submission by Dr* G. W. Govier summari¬ 
zing the policy of the Conservation Board with respect to the different types 
of gas. 

Regarding dry gas, i*e., gas not containing economically recoverable 
liquids, the policy was "Complete prevention of production of gas beyond 
the amount which may be effectively utilized or stored*"^ 

The policy with regard to wet gas without commercial quantities of 
liquid petroleum was similar to that for dry gas, except that the recovery 
of economical liquid hydrocarbons was required. 

In the case of wet gas containing commercial quantities of liquid pet¬ 
roleum, or of "solution” gas, i*e. gas dissolved in liquid petroleum, a 
"reasonable” waste was tolerated* In the Leduc and Redwater fields at the 
time, it was felt that it was uneconomical to gather all the gas which ap¬ 
peared with the oil, and that some such loss could be tolerated on the pre¬ 
mise that the gas had been used, in a sense, by acting as a lifting agent 
for the oil* The removal of liquid hydrocarbons was required wherever their 

value made such recovery economical. In such cases the residual gas was to 

6 

receive "couplete effective use or storage*" This would mainly involve 
strategic re-injection into the reservoir for pressure maintenance. 

With respect to gas-cap gas, which overlies the liquid petroleum and

need not necessarily be produced with it, the policy was to prevent produc¬ 
tion of such gas as long as it was 11 economic ally aiding in the recovery of 
liquid petroleum underlying it.” Production for removal of liquid hydro¬ 
carbons such as propane and butane was permissible so long as the residue 
gas was returned to the reservoir, and the well was operated so as to 
cause no damage to the productivity of the pool. 

For gas-condensate gas, foom reservoirs such as those at Jumping 
Pound and Pincher Creek, where gas and liquids exist in a single phase as 
a volatile hydrocarbon liquid, production methods are especially important 
if losses are to be avoided.. Detailed sample analysis is required, and on 
this depends the decision as to whether residue gas must be re-injected for 
pressure maintenance or whether it may be otherwise utilized. 

Assuming that a gas export plan would make a gas gathering pipe-line 
grid feasible in the Province, the Commission saw such a grid as an. aid to 
conservation. Through common purchase arrangements as in Turner Valley, 
or through unit operation with which Jumping Pound was then experimenting, 
exporters would be able to obtain their requirements in co-ordination with 
conservation policy. Priority could be given to residue gas, and certain 
fields could be designated as reserve or storage fields. 

The Commission report was made available to the Legislature in March, 
1949> and was thus available for reference at the special session of the 
Legislature held in July, 1949, at which petroleum legislation received a 
major revision. The Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act was amended so 
as to replace the Natural Gas Utilities Act and the Pipe Line Regulation

Act, as well as consolidating and amending the previous Oil and Gas Re¬ 
sources Conservation Act of 1938* This amalgamation of Acts was part of 
the government f s preparation for expansion of Alberta 1 s markets, including 
export of gas. The Minister of Mines and Minerals, the Honourable N.E. 
Tanner, warned that "immediate construction of an oil outlet was urgent be¬ 
cause Alberta Oil production figures rapidly were overtaking the refinery 
8 

capacity." 

One such outlet was achieved in 1950 with the putting into operation 
of the Interprovincial Pipeline to transport crude oil to eastern refiner¬ 
ies. **The full significance of this line to the Alberta producer appeared 
in April, 1951 when the Ontario demand was responsible for increasing Al- 

I 

berta market allowables to the extent of twenty-two thousand barrels a day." 

In addition, refinery capacity in Western Canada was increasing so that 

by 1952 a daily capacity of approximately 220,000 barrels had been added to 

10 

1946 refining capacity. 

The expansion of markets for crude oil is indicated by the following

of nearly 2 million barrels in Alberta consumption over that of 1952, and 
a sharp increase in the import of refined products from Saskatchewan. 

Although natural gas was not being marketed outside the Province in 
1949 -when the conservation laws were being consolidated and revised, it was 
not difficult to forecast that the new quantities becoming available would 
soon raise the question of the need for export outlets and for legisla- 
tion to deal with such an eventuality. J 

Anticipating these various market developments, the revised conser¬ 
vation laws of 1949 restated and enlarged the powers of the Petroleum, and 
Natural Gas Conservation Board to carry out conservation, to prevent "waste** 

and to give each owner his "just and equitable share of the production of 
_ 14 

any pool.* 1 The Board was also authorized to fix a provincial allowable 
for oil and gas, and to allocate this among the different pools, and within 
the pool to the different operators. 

Waste was made an offence, and the definition of waste was given a wide 
meaning. Included as being wasteful were; improper use of reservoir energy, 
location of wells in a manner to reduce the amount ultimately recoverable, 
inefficient storage, production in excess of transportation or market capa¬ 
bilities, and handling so as to cause excessive surface loss or destruction 
15 

of oil or gas. Carbon black production was included in the category of 

waste, and was prohibited. Formerly, when gas was of little value, this 

product could be profitably used in the manufacture of rubber, inks, paints, 

and plastics, but its production from natural gas "is frowned upon by most 

16 

conservationists because it is wasteful of heat energy."

Another requirement of the Act was the buying of residue gas by gas 
purchasers if it could be "reasonably” used for the purchaser^ require¬ 
ments* Also, recognizing market effects on production and hence on con¬ 
servation, the Act gave the Board power to direct gas marketing, and where 

the prices caused dispute between the parties concerned, then theBoard of 

17 

Public Utility Commissioners obtained the right to determine the prices* 

Furthe r consolidation of conservation law was effected in 1950, when 

a new Act was passed amalgamating the 1949 consolidations with the 1942 

18 

Oil and Gas Wells Act, which was repealed. Since the Oil and Gas Wells 

Act had dealt with the many technical aspects of well drilling, and includ¬ 
ed the objective of conserving gas and oil and preventing waste, its inclu¬ 
sion in conservation legislation was logical from the viewpoint of eliminat¬ 
ing legal duplication and confusion. 

The new Act thus became a very comprehensive document, divided into 
seven Parts. Part I deals with the organization and constitution of the 
Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, Part II with general powers 
of the Board, Part III with drilling, completion and abandonment of wells. 
Part 17 with oil and gas production. Part V with gathering and disposition 
of oil and gas. Part VI with taxation and Part VII with provisions of a 
general nature.^ 

Also present in the new Act were some of the drilling and production 
regulations, including the regulations concerning the promotion of and as-

sistance to unit operations schemes by the Board,, production reports on 

wells, and Board access to wells, oil and gas plants, and records® This 

statutory declaration of Board powers was in accord with the recommenda- 

tions of the McGillivray Commission which had said 

• ••that in our view if a statutory body is to be given power to inter¬ 
fere with the common law rights of individuals, it is only right that 
those powers should be specifically declared, first so that the statu¬ 
tory body may know what its power is, and second so that those who may 
be adversely affected may see to it that it does not exceed the author¬ 
ity which has been conferred upon it by the Legislature. 20 

In any modernizing and consolidation of legislation involving exten¬ 
sive detail such as in this Act, it is reasonable to assume that consider¬ 
able subsequent amendment will become necessary as practical application 
exposes weaknesses. In this case the original draft stood up well, being 
subjected to only minor adjustments in the ensuing five years. An example 
of the type ©f change made was the 1951 addition to Section 15 authorizing 
the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board to obtain the services of 
professional persons necessary for the transaction of its business. The 

new clause authorizes the appointment of experts to inquire into specific 

21 

matters coming before the Board, Another example appears in connection 

with Section 19 of the Act which requires an applicant for a license to file 

a plan showing measurements from sane definite established mark. In 1952, 

this had to be clarified so that it would be meaningful in unsurveyed ter- 

22 

ritory where increased activity was developing. Even in the matters of 
keeping records and filing returns, changes become necessary from time to

time "to keep abreast of the changing conditions and new elements entering 

23 

the petroleum and allied industries," 

When several years of such amendments have accumulated, efficiency of 
reference usually makes necessary another major revision. The 1950 Oil and 
Gas Resources Conservation Act with amendments was thus revised in 1957 *^ 
In addition to minor amendments and consolidations, the major change 
in the new Act concerned Part VIII dealing with unit operations# Sections 
75 to 82 were not proclaimed with the rest of the Act on the first of July, 
1957# These sections empower the Provincial Government to enforce compul¬ 
sory unitization of any oil or natural gas pool. Premier Manning explained 
that this was usually voluntary, and that this part of the Act would not be 
proclaimed until the government considered the action necessary. 

This unproclaimed section instructed the Board to "encourage owners of 
oil and gas interests,#,to,,.combine their interests,•to achieve more 
efficient development, "irrespective of whether that purpose is accomplished 
by unit operation, co-operative development or joint participation." Where 

owners cannot agree on a unit principle, "any such owner may apply to the 

25 

Board to have the field, pool, or part thereof operated as a unit." 

If it is proved to the satisfaction of theBoard that additional areas 
are "underlaid by the pool that is the common source of supply of oil or 
gas for the unit operation", these areas may be added to the unit. 

In the Legislature, Liberal leader J, Harper Prowse attacked the post-

ponement of proclamation of Sections 75-82 of the Act, arguing that immediate 

passage would ensure that no advantage would be taken of delay in making the 

provision® lawful* He said, "Let f s come out right now and say that if nec- 

26 

essary we are prepared to put this compulsion into effect*" 

Premier Manning denied that there would be any delay, in that the 
Cabinet could pass the order within twelve hours* He thus left the impres¬ 
sion that the government still hoped for satisfactory results from volun¬ 
tary unitization if this were stimulated by impending but not actual compul¬ 
sion* 

Three new agreements for unit operation were announced at the same ses¬ 
sion. One applied to all petroleum and natural gas in Section 1?, Township 
26, Range 6 , west of the Fifth Meridian* Another concerned the Acheson 
North D2 pool near Winterburn. A third pertained to the Westerose field, 
an area of 3*700 acres in the Leduc formation® 

The need for production agreements was emphasised in 1957 because of 
the reduction in market demand* The yearly output was down 7 million bar¬ 
rels over that of 1956 , and while potential output at the end of 1957 was 

placed at 800,000 barrels daily, "actual output did not exceed 450,000 bar- 

27 

rels and at times was well below that level*" In fact, prorated produc— 

28 

tion fell to 281,710 barrels daily in the last week of November, 1957. 

The reduced market was caused by such factors as replacement of some Alber¬ 
ta Oil in the northwest United States by shipments from the Middle East 
and Venezuela.

This situation served to emphasise the fact pointed out by the 
McGillivray Commission that "true conservation of petroleum necessarily 
involves Proration," with "ratable takings and an. adjustment of restricted 
flow to balance the requirements of the market♦" ^ As previously indicated, 
proration has two main objectives, stabilization of the market and promotion 
of conservation* Regulation of the rate of production serves both to ad¬ 
just supply to the demand and to achieve "more efficient use of reservoir 

energy, assuring higher ultimate recovery than would be obtainable under un-

restricted flow*" 

The Alberta Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, in consul¬ 
tation with the producers, developed a proration formula in 1950 which has 
since remained in effect* 

At monthly public hearings, purchasers of crude oil make "nominations" 
in which they indicate their requirements for the following month. From 

these nominations a provincial demand is determined which is then allocated 

32 

to the various wells and pools. 

The formula for allocation includes a minimum allowance based on opera¬ 
ting costs, return on capital invested, or the cost of drilling. This is 
called the economic allowance, and is the predominant factor in winter months 
when demand is low and in many cases approaches the economic minimum* In 
summer, with higher demand the second factor in the formula predominates, 
i.e. the prorated share, cased on the proportionate relationships of pool

potentials in excess of the minimum economic allowance. The economic al¬ 
lowance as well as the M.P.R. (Maximum Production Rate), is based on an 

33 

average for the whole pool. 

Thus, the economic allowances are first deducted from the provincial 
demand, and the residual demand is distributed on the basis of the pro¬ 
rated share. In the case of a pool allowance being more than, its potential, 
i.e., the pool being unable to meet its economic minimum, the allowable is 

reduced to the potential, and the extra demand is then re-prorated amongst 

34 

pools capable of meeting it. 

In order to ensure that producers abide by the allowables, for over¬ 
production in excess of 10 percent above the allowable a penalty is imposed 

by which the operator ,f may be required to shut In the well until the over- 

35 

production is cut down.” 

Besides prorationing, other conservation measures are established and 

developed by the Board. Repressuring by injecting gas or water back into 

the pool has done much to increase recoverability. Gas injection in Golden 

Spike D-3 pool raised pressure from 1400 pounds per square inch in 1953 to 

1700 psi in 1956, and Is expected to produce 88,000,000 barrels more oil 

36 

than under natural recovery methods. 

Other gas injection schemes are operating at Campbell, Duhamel, and 
Turner Valley. Several water injection schemes have been started in the 
Pembina field, in Leduc-Woodbend and in Joffre. One company estimates that

water injection in 80 wells wil] increase oil recovery by 20,000,000 bar- 

36 

rels valued at $53*000,000* 

To deal, with the old problem of surplus gas produced with oil, the 
processing of such gas to remove propane, butane and natural gas is a 
strict policy. The residue gas is then sold or re-injected.. Such gas 
processing plants are operating at Turner Valley, Leduc, Bonnie Glen, Red- 
water and Nevis. 

Thus, the main aspects of good conservation policy are being applied 
in Alberta during the post-Leduc period, including technical and engineer¬ 
ing advances, adjustments to market conditions, and consideration of equity 
factors. As these aspects have changed, policy has been adjusted. This 
has been and will be a continuing process. The results so far lend substance 
to the observation that **the achievements of the industry and of the Petro¬ 
leum and Natural Gas Conservation Board, in reducing waste and conserving 

37 

gas, have been commendable.”

CHAPTER 7 
Land Policies 


The Federal government *s Department of the Interior owned about 95 per¬ 
cent of the lands in the prairie provinces, including the mineral rights, 
after 1870, when Rupert’s Land was transferred to the Crown* In 1881, the 
C.P.R. received a land subsidy in return for building a railway to link the 
eastern provinces with British Columbia. This involved the odd numbered 
sections in each township, with the exception of school sections numbered 
11 and 29, in a belt 20 miles wide on each side of the main line. 

The Hudson’s Bay Company had retained 7,000,000 acres of land as part 
of the compensation agreement when Rupert’s Land was transferred to the 
Grown. It sold most of these lands to homesteaders, and mineral rights 
went with the title until 1908, when the Company reserved them. The Cal¬ 
gary and Edmonton Corporation received a land subsidy similar to that of the 
C.P.R. for building a railroad from Calgary to Edmonton. This Corporation 

retained the mineral rights on its lands, being 1,250,000 acres, when its 

2 

railroad operation was taken over by the C.P.R. Mineral rights also went 
with the Dominion lands sold or homesteaded until 1887, after which they 
were reserved to the Crown. Homesteads purchased from the C.P.R. retained 
mineral rights until 1902. 

The decisions by those selling land to begin reserving the mineral 
rights were a result of the growing realization of the value of such rights. 

One of the first Acts passed by the Alberta government after its forma¬ 
tion in 1905 was the Land Titles Act, providing for the recording of the title

in one of the Provincial offices, with the owner receiving a duplicate 
certificate. If the minerals were reserved to the Crown or held by others 
than the owner, this fact appeared on the certificate of title. 

The first prospecting applications were made to the Federal govern¬ 
ment in 189B. By Order-in-Council, the Minister of the Interior was autho¬ 
rized to permit an applicant to make a prospecting reserve of not more than 
640 acres, for the purpose of petroleum prospecting. If oil was found in 
paying quantity, there was a provision to sell the land to the applicant for 
one dollar an acre, with the Grown to obtain a royalty of 2^ percent on the 
sales of petroleum. This Order applied to the area south of the C.P.R. in 
what was then known as the District of Alberta. 

In 1901, the government felt it to be no longer in the public interest 
to allow an applicant any particular area of land for prospecting purposes. 
All unappropriated Dominion lands in what is now Alberta were opened to pros¬ 
pecting by any individual or company so desiring. However, anyone finding 

petroleum could buy up to 640 acres at one dollar an acre, subject to royal- 

3 

ty as prescribed from time to time. 

By 1904, an operator was permitted to reserve up to 1,920 acres if he 
was installing machinery, and if oil was found, he could purchase the first 
640 acres at one dollar an acre and the remainder at three dollars an acre. 
The patent to the land would include surface rights and petroleum rights, 
but excluded all other minerals. Subsequently, various amendments and ad¬ 
justments were made regarding duration of reserves, installation of machin¬ 
ery, and other matters. 

AH previous regulations were rescinded in 1910, and a system of ren-

tals was set up instead of sales. By that time 16,028 acres had been sold, 
including 1,541 acres in Waterton National Park, 1,762 acres in Bow Island 
field, and 12,725 acres near McMurray. 

The first regulations, applying to all Dominion lands in Alberta, in¬ 
cluded a rental of twenty-five cents an acre for the first year and fifty 
cents an acre for each succeeding year, with a maximum area of 1,920 acres, 
provisions for installing machinery within one year, no royalties until Jan¬ 
uary 1930, and then as specified by Order in Council .' 4 The rentals for the 
second and third year of the lease could be met by credits allowed for ap¬ 
proved expenditures in drilling* 

Between 1910 and 1930, the rentals were doubled, the credit for dril¬ 
ling expenditures was extended to the fourth and fifth years, and in 1922 , 
grouping of leases was permitted with the maximum area in a group being ex¬ 
tended to 20,000 acres. 

Regulations on prospecting permits were established in 1928, with ren¬ 
tals of ten cents an acre, for a term of one year, on a maximum area of 
1,920 acres, with exploration expenditures being applicable toward the first 
year f s rental#'* 

Operators pressed for some commitments as to what royalty would be 
charged after January, 1930. The royalty was first set at from 2j percent 
to 5 percent of sales of products for the first five years after oil was dis¬ 
covered in commercial quantities, from 5 percent to 10 percent for the second 
five years, and thereafter at 10 percent. In $uly, 1929* the Minister of the

Interior announced that after January 1, 1930, a royalty of 5 percent on 

petroleum and naphtha would be payable by all holders of petroleum and 

natural gas leases, with no royalty being set for sales of natural gas.^ 

In 1930, the Province of Alberta obtained the lands and the mineral 

rights from the Dominion. The distribution of mineral rights was then as 
7 

follows: 

TABLE 13 

Distribution of Mineral Rights. Alberta. 1930. 


Total area of the Province .... 163,382,400 acres 

Area in Dominion Parks reserved to Dominion ....... 13,434,240 n 

Area in Indian Reserves reserved to Dominion ...... 1,328,090 11 

Held in freehold, including railroad grants ....... 16,000,000 « 

Mineral rights held by Province .. 132,620,070 11 


The distribution across the Province was far from even. For example, 
in a large area between Calgary and Medicine Hat, the G.P.R. held the title 

g 

to all the lands except those held by the Hudson f s Bay Company. 

The Federal statutes and regulations were continued until the Provin¬ 
cial Lands Act of 1931 came into force. The regulations under this Act were 
almost indentical to the ones previously in effect under the Dominion. The 
royalty of 5 percent on oil sales continued unchanged until January 1935, 

9 

when a rate of 10 percent was set, to continue for the following five years.

As geology and geophysics improved methods of exploration, the need for 
larger prospecting acreages became apparent. In 1936, the regulations were 
amended, eliminating the former maximum of 1,920 acres, and putting the 
areas granted at the discretion of the Minister of Lands and Mines. Groups 
of leases were permitted up to a maximum of 50,000 acres, and drilling 
credits could satisfy lease rentals up to and including the twelfth year of 
the lease. 

The following year, the prospecting permit regulations were rescinded 

and replaced by Regulations Governing Petroleum and Natural Gas Reservations, 

which allowed up to 50,000 acres to be included in a reservation. This was 

increased in 1941 to 200,000 acres, with one person being permitted to hold 

up to three reservations in his own name at any one time. Also in 1941, the 

Crown petroleum and natural gas rights obtainable under lease by application 

were increased from 1,920 to 9,600 acres. 

At this time the royalty to be collected on natural gas was fixed by 

Order-in-Council. Gas usefully consumed off the location of production, or 

sold, was charged ”15 percent of the selling price or fair value at the 

time and place of production” provided that in no event the royalty would 

be less than three-quarters of a cent per thousand feet ,^ 

On other petroleum products, the royalty was stated as 

that percentage of the products obtained equivalent to the square root 
of the average daily production, subject to a maximum royalty of 15% 
and a minimum of 5% and also subject to the proviso that with the first 
return for the well an election could be made to pay royalty until the 
end of May, 1951, at 12\% of all products, other than natural gas, in¬ 
stead of on the square root formula. ^

At this time a total of 4,014 leases were active in Alberta, contain¬ 
ing an area of 908,742 acres. At the close of the year, 1941, 559,120 
acres were under reservation. During that fiscal year, bonuses through sale 

by public tender of petroleum and natural gas rights formerly comprised in 

13 

cancelled leases or reservations amounted to $3,741.13. 

By Order-in-Council, in 1942, provision was made for granting credit 
for expenditures incurred in drilling, "and such credit could be applied to 
the rental for the first year of leases following the reservations but not 
to exceed an area of 50,000 acres. 

In 1945, rentals satisfied by exploratory and development work totalled 
$1,412,458*09. In the same year, the Mineral Taxation Act was passed, with 
provision for the Minister to declare certain areas producing areas, extend¬ 
ed to include property within five-eights of a mile of a mine or well which 
is producing or has produced minerals. Such areas were subject to a tax 

not exceeding five cents an acre, compared to previous regulations on non- 

15 

producing areas with a rate not exceeding one-half cent per acre. 

Owing to the rapid expansion of leasing activity after the Leduc dis¬ 
covery, it was found necessary* in 1947 to reduce the number of reservations 
which could be held by any one person at any time to two, each with a maxi¬ 
mum area of 100,000 acres. The right to assign reservations was also ad¬ 
justed to make the maximum size sixteen sections, and requiring that a Crown 
reserve of equal area should be created in close proximity. In the following 
year, the maximum lease acreage was reduced to nine sections, with the length

not to exceed four miles and not to exceed twice the breadth. These 
measures were designed to prevent individuals or companies Tram obtaining 
unfair advantages in selecting choice locations. 

The Leduc discoveries also made necessary the Right of Entry Arbitra¬ 
tion Act of 1947, providing for a Board of Arbitration of not more than 
three members, responsible to the Department of Lands and Mines. Operators 
are obliged to seek agreement with the owner of surface rights, and if they 

fail to do so, the decision of the Board is final, subject to any reconsidera- 

17 

tion that the Board itself may undertake. 

The government was relying on large companies to do most of the ex¬ 
ploratory work, and came under criticism for its policy of allotting in¬ 
creasingly large lease areas to such companies. The Hon. N. E. Tanner re¬ 
ferred in the legislature to such complaints from smaller independent com¬ 
panies ’’who hav@n*t spent money on the search.’* He argued that the only fair 
policy was to give first consideration on lease rights to companies who had 

spent millions on the search for oil. His suggestion was that the independent 

18 

companies could pool their resources to carry out similar work. 

The matter of several owners being involved in one parcel of land also 

affected taxation policy. In 1949, to reduce the complications involved in 

assessing and taxing such parcels, an amendment to the Mineral Taxation Act 

of 1947 provided that where several persons have fractional interests in one 

parcel of minerals, all such persons are to be regarded as one owner, and 

19 

the parcel as one parcel, for purposes of taxation. /

The 1949 session also passed a Mines and Minerals Act, which, with 
amendments, is still the basis for policy at present# In great detail the 
Act sets forth the powers of the Department of Mines and Minerals with re¬ 
gard to all aspects of renting, leasing, royalties, surveys, and explora- 
20 

tion# 

By the year ending March 31* 1950, taxation on petroleum and natural 

gas lands had yielded the government $750,721.26, as compared with $75,120.93 
21 

ten years earlier. This was attributed to the fact that in 1941, only 
Turner Valley was subject to tax as a producing area, whereas subsequently 
other major producing areas had been classified as such and had been as¬ 
sessed the increased amount. 

In 1951* the government had been defeated in the Legislature by its 
own backbenchers when it attempted to make provision for repossessing lands 
on which mineral tax had not been met. Some seizure of land had already 
been made in lieu of unpaid taxes, and the private members were demanding 
* f some method of regaining mineral rights seized” under these circumstances. 
They argued that sane owners did not even know that they possessed mineral 
rights subject to tax* and now, because of this lack of knowledge, were about 
to be deprived of property suddenly become valuable. The proposed legisla¬ 
tion designed to amend the Mineral Taxation Act so as to strengthen the 

government f s hand in taking over lands in default of the lj cents per acre 
22 

tax was voted down. After the discovery of the Leduc field, mineral rights 
owners became more alert in keeping up tax payments on their now valuable 
property.

In 1951* new royalty regulations came into effect. A sliding scale 
was set up ,f applicable to all wells on Crown disposals running from 5 
percent to 16 2/3 percent depending on the monthly production....” Royal¬ 
ty on other fluid hydro-carbons and sulphur was set at twelve and one-half 
percent and on natural gas or residue gas sold or usefully consumed* fif¬ 
teen percent, of selling price or fair value at the time and place of pro¬ 
duction, with a minimum of three quarters of one cent per Mcf unless the 
gas was used to obtain other products. The royalties were to apply until 

June, 1961, and thereafter unless changed by the Lieut©nant-Governor-in- 
23 

Council. 

In 1953* the Judicial Carmittee of the Privy Council handed down judge¬ 
ments concerning the case of the Attorney-General of Alberta vs. Huggard 
Assets Ltd ., in which the latter challenged the right of the province to 
change the royalty agreement made with the Dominion in 1913* The decision 

pi 

was that ”the province now had the power to prescribe and levy a royalty.”^ 
Some protest had arisen over th© manner in which the government’s poli¬ 
cy of retaining 50 percent of the land in any area was working. It was 
felt that oil companies were able to bunch their half in the most produc¬ 
tive sections of a field, leaving to the Crown less valuable areas on the 
fringe of the pool. Accordingly it was suggested that the Crown reserves 

should be in one section blocks arranged in checkerboard fashion, alternat- 

25 

ing with sections leased.

The government took steps in this direction in 1952 with a regulation 
specifying that ”locations or concentrations of leases applied for may 
form a checkerboard pattern or shall be apart one from the other a dis¬ 
tance of not less than one mile.”*^ The Crown reserves were then to com¬ 
prise, except in special cases, an area of not less than one mile in width 
surrounding each location or concentration of leases, together with the 

portions of a checkerboard pattern not permitted under lease, and such 

27 

other areas as the Minister might select. 

Provisions were made for the disposal of the Crown reserves at the 

1951 session, at which the disposition was placed in the hands of the Lieu- 

28 

tenant-Governor in Council. 

A question arose in the 1953 session regarding the taxation of mineral 
rights owners when several of them owned a different mineral in the same 
area. Premier Manning found it ”too involved” to divide the taxation be¬ 
tween a number of persons holding rights to different minerals on one piece 
of land. The policy was to tax each an acre till the minerals were 
proved, and then to tax on the assessed, value of the minerals owned. J. H. 

Prowse protested the fact that the increased tax took effect before the 

29 

minerals could be marketed, but the government stood by its policy. 

In 1953, the taxation minimum on oil and gas property was changed from 
one dollar to three dollars an acre, and the regulations on rentals for 
natural gas property were amended to prescribe an annual rental of 33 1/3

The regulations regarding exploration are summarized in a 3.952 0rde:n- 
in-Council, and are largely technical in nature. ji Of particular interest 
are the areas in which geophysical operations are prohibited. These in¬ 
clude areas covered by natural or artificial lakes, areas in which under¬ 
ground mines are located, and any other areas defined as restricted by the 
Minister of Mines and Minerals. Provincial Parks, Forest Reserves and 
grounds upon which public institutions and Metis colonies are situated 
come under the category of restricted areas if the administrative body con- 
cerned has not granted permission. The officials in charge of such areas 
are thus enabled to exercise their judgement in each case as to whether or 
not the exploration would adversely affect the public interest. 

In 1954 regulations, the matter of drilling reservations in Crown re¬ 
serves was dealt with, and it is provided that a person desiring to obtain 
such a reservation 

shall submit to the Director of Mineral Rights a request that the Pet¬

to acquire the reservation may be made available for disposal.™ 

The Minister may then grant the request with such changes as may seem 
desirable to him, taking into consideration a variety of factors including 
engineering, conservation, and marketing as they are related to the area 
concerned.

Act of 1949. 33 

One of the new sections provided for the Minister to enter into an 
agreement for the calculation of royalty due to the Crown when Crown pet¬ 
roleum or natural gas is included in a unit operation.^ Part X deals with 
the bituminous sands, which are assuming increased importance as methods of 
extraction develop which permit the product to market competitively with oil 
from other sources. The ten sections of the Act, combined with the ori¬ 
ginal 1949 Act and the regulations connected with them, make up a document 
of extensive proportions. 

Compared with the relatively simple legislation of early provincial 
jurisdiction, this volume and detail reflect the complexity which has a- 
risen in recent years with respect to petroleum lands policy. New techniques, 
large new areas, the more intricate economics involved in modern and expanded 
production, together with the application of more searching and detailed 
government control, have made land policy a major legislative item.

CHAPTER 8 


The Export of Natural Gas 

By 1948, the discovery of the new fields in northern Alberta had made 
large new potential reserves of oil and gas sufficiently tangible to fore¬ 
warn the government that a problem with controversial implications would 
soon require attention* This was the question of the Province reaching the 
position where export of natural gas would be socially advantageous* 

The problem was a complex one, involving many factors, some of which 
were sufficiently vague to ensure considerable debate* A major issue was 
the balancing of the proven and estimated reserves of the Province against 
the needs of domestic and industrial uses within Alberta for the foreseeable 
future. This in turn involved estimates of the extent and availability of 
the underground potential, and also estimates of future industrial and pop¬ 
ulation growth and the development of alternative fuels in the future* 

Since the accuracy of any such estimates could always be questioned, the 
whole subject readily lent itself to considerable political disagreement. 

Under these circumstances, it was not surprising that the government 
appointed the Dinning Natural Gas Commission in 1948 with instructions to 
make a rapid but extensive survey of the gas situation for presentation to 
the legislative session in the spring of 1949* 

In discussing the reserves that might be available, the Commission 
pointed out the necessity of differentiating between gas which might be in 
the ground and gas which could be recovered* The percentage of existing 
gas which could be recovered represented a "recovery factor" which might 
vary considerably, depending on the pressure in the field, and the condi¬ 
tion of the underground porous zones affecting the movement of the gas to 
the withdrawal area. 1 With unfavourable porous structures, the recover-

ability rate would fall below 50 percent even when using the best repres¬ 
suring techniques. Under more favourable conditions, 50 percent to 60 per-¬ 
cent would be more common, while 80 percent would be considered a high rate 
of recovery. 

Gas containing liquids and a large quantity of impurities such as sul¬ 
phur would have a lower recovery factor than dry gas, because of the deduc¬ 
tions to be made before obtaining dry gas. The Alberta fields then in pro¬ 
duction were classified as dry gas fields with the exception of wet gas in 

Turner Valley and Princess, gas condensate in Jumping Pound, and gas-cap and 

2 

solution gas in Leduc. ™A reasonable recovery factor for (dry) gas. 

would be 90 percent,™ while Leduc ™is subject to a recovery factor of 60 per- 
cent.'» J 

The availability of gas, i.e. If the rate at which recovery can be af- 
4 

facted,™ involves the questions of availability over time and availability 
in terms of location. The availability over time is related to conserva¬ 
tion practice, including the number of wells used to drain the field, the 
rate of output permitted, and the use of repressuring. The resultant rate 
of withdrawal ™is directly connected to the question of velocity of the gas 
passing through many pores....The slower the rate of travel...the greater 
the amount eventually recovered. 

Availability with respect to location refers to fields which are too 
distant from markets or too small to justify the construction of transmission

lines* This in turn is related to the construction of a pipe-line grid 
connecting the major fields in the Province# Such a grid can avert deple¬ 
tion of local fields where demand is heavy, and at the same time make econo¬ 
mical the exploitation of more remote fields which are within range of the 
grid network. The economies of such a project also include the market a- 
vailable both within the Province and beyond its borders. 

Such were the factors concerning which the Commission received much 
evidence in its efforts to assess the present and future reserves of the 
Province. Three main viewpoints were suggested as being the basis for jud¬ 
ging the future prospects.^ These were: 

(1) Past performances regarding additions to known reserves and the in¬ 
dustry 1 s record in meeting requirements.... 

(2) Analysis of statistical data bearing on the rate of discovery of 
new gas and the results of drilling operations, including wild cats 
drilled and number of dry holes.... 

(3) Consideration of the areas believed to be favourable for the find¬ 
ing of oil and gas and of the extent to which such areas have already 
been explored. 

The conclusions of the Commission after considering the evidence pre¬ 
sented were that ”existing and proven” reserves at the time were 4*26 tril¬ 
lion cubic feet, of which 3.49 trillion cubic feet of Marketable, dry, 

7 

clean gas” would be recoverable; and that while potential reserves were 
”inherently speculative,” they were ” f exceedingly large 1 and will utlimately 

g 

prove »to exceed, many times f the present existing and proven reserves.” 

One of the witnesses. Dr. T. A. Link, a prominent Canadian geologist, made 
a specific estimate that the potential reserves were ”in the order of at 
least 50 trillion cubic feet or more...I think that is a very conservative 
9 

estimate.”

The validity of the estimate can be judged to some extent by the an¬ 
nouncement from the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation Board on January 
1, 195S, to the effect that the proven reserves had increased 2.7 trillion 
cubic feet in the previous 15 months to reach 21 trillion cubic feet; and 
that the potential gas reserve was estimated at ”60 to 80 trillion cubic feet.'* 

Comparing future reserves with future withdrawals, the Commission noted 
that withdrawals involved gas consumed by flaring, field use, shrinkage, 
and marketing for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes. The compari¬ 
sons involved estimates over a fifty year period, using as a basis the 1949 
estimate of 4*26 trillion cubic feet of known reserves, with consumption re¬ 
presenting 70 percent of net withdrawals, the remainder being used for re¬ 
pressuring, oil production and. other field uses. 

On this basis, asBuming an annual increase in consumption of 500,000 
Mcf, new discoveries of 100,000,000 Mcf a year were thought to be adequate. 

The larger amount of the new discoveries is made necessary by the fact that 
there is a continual process of exhaustion in older fields. 

Including export plans as seen at that time, new discoveries of 

11 

220,000,000 Mcf a year were felt necessary. The actual increase in the re¬ 
serves, as indicated above, from 4*6 trillion cubic feet to 21 trillion in 
nine years, indicates that the increase requirements were met many times 
over. The increase in consumption from 1948 to 1954 was about 50 million 
Mcf, or more than 8 million Mcf a year on the average, over twice the a- 

mount estimated. However, the actual ratio of increased reserves over in-

creased withdrawals was much higher than the minimum set up by the Commis¬ 
sion so that export on a scale much greater than they had envisaged was 
certain to seem practical. 

Other factors operated to increase the arguments for more export. 

Loss of gas through flaring was assumed to be approaching elimination be¬ 
cause the value of the flared gas would make storage preferable to flaring, 
and because conservation regulations would insist on such procedures. Also, 
future consumption of gas was seen to involve a complexity of factors, in¬ 
cluding growth of population, replacement of coal by gas for domestic use, 
expansion of industry in the Province, and development of fuels competitive 
to gas. 

In the last category, gasification of the Province f s great coal re¬ 
serves always represented an alternative to natural gas, an alternative 
which greatly reduced the urgency of preserving the gas supplies. It has 
been estimated that the world will pass through the peak of its petroleum 
reserves in about 1990, when the "demand for coal will increase sharply 11 
raising its price to the point where nuclear power will be able to compete 
economically with it. However, in points where the production costs of coal 

are especially low, as in the United States and in Alberta, "it seems likely 

13 

that it will remain our major fuel for a very long time.” 

The Commission estimated that nuclear power would reach competitive 
levels with the coal and gas by about 1970,^* and this estimate now appears 
to have been about right. A 1958 report by Dr. David A. Keys, scientific ad-

viscr to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, announced immediate construction 
of an experimental nuclear power plant which would produce power ,T as cheap¬ 
ly as coal” apart from the initial research and development costs* "After 
the second or third is in operation we believe it will produce more cheaply 
than oil, coal or natural gas*"'" 

The costs of producing electricity from natural gas in Alberta are in¬ 
dicated by the Medicine Hat submission to the Commission in which the cost 
is estimated "at approximately £ of a cent per Kilowatt hour..*" 16 This com¬ 
pares with a statement from the City of Edmonton which reported selling elec¬ 
tricity to Calgary Power Limited "at .35 of a cert per kilowatt hour..." on 

1 ? 

which rate the city "still would make a profit." 

Regarding the cost estimates for nuclear power, we have the "reasonable 
assumption that we might have available 10-mill (one cent) nuclear power by 
the mid 1960s, 7-mill power by the mid 1970s, with the cost gradually ap¬ 
proaching 5 mills per kilowatt-hour." 

Considering that costs of generating electricity from coal are "between 
6 and 7 mills per kilowatt-hour for new coal-fired units in the United States" 
it seems likely that in the future, the choice betweai power from coal, gas 
or nuclear energy will be made largely on the basis of transmission costs to 
the point of consumption. Certainly, the availability of such alternatives 
to gas reduces the argument for restriction of gas export in order to conserve 
future power reserves in the Province.

Such were the considerations brought to the spring session of the Legi¬ 
slature in 1949 when the Report of the Dinning Commission was presented. 
Legislative action developed mainly in a second session called in July, 

1949, at which the main business was legislative changes concerning petro¬ 
leum and natural gas. Several Acts were revised and consolidated, in the 
new Natural Gas Utilities Act. Pipe Line Act amendments and changes re¬ 
sulted mainly in transferring more control of such lines to the Petroleum 
and Natural Gas Conservation Board. The new Gas Resources Preservation Act 
was of prime importance in connection with possible gas export. 

This last Act emphasises its intention ,f to effect the preservation 
and conservation of the oil and gas resources of the Province, and to pro¬ 
vide for their effective utilization having regard to the present and future 
needs of the ...Province.® 9 ^ 

Section 4 of the Act makes necessary the application to the Conserva¬ 
tion Board for a permit before any gas is removed from the Province. De¬ 
tails of the conditions which may be prescribed in an export pennit are set 
forth, including the pool from which the gas may be taken, maximum, quanti¬ 
ties permitted, rates of withdrawal, period of time for which the pennit is 
valid, and the necessity of supplying areas in the Province reasonably ad¬ 
jacent to the exporting facilities. 

In effect, this Act was a detailed preparation for regulation of ex¬ 
port. It led to controversy both in the legislature and throughout the Pro¬ 
vince. In the House, J. Harper Prowse and Elmer Roper of Edmonton, and 
H. J. MacDonald of Calgary led the opposition to the measure.

The basis of their opposition was the assumption that the future 
needs of Alberta consumers were not being adequately protected. Prowse 

described the legislation as representing the "Cabinet taking power over 

20 

the lives of Alberta citizens." 

Attorney General Maynard and the Minister of Lands and Mines, N. E. 
Tanner, defended the Bill by emphasizing the provision for conserving gas 
and protecting the interests of Alberta consumers. They said the Bill was 
designed to permit export of gas when adequate provision had been made for 
domestic needs. The difficulty was to decide what the future needs of the 
Province were likely to be and whether reserves were sufficient to meet 
this need and still leave an export surplus of sufficient volume to justi¬ 
fy the expenditures in transmission lines. 

In, 1951* limited export to Montana to provide fuel for copper produc¬ 
tion there was begun. Premier Manning justified this as being essential 
under the joint defense program. The opposition protested this export and 

raised the question of high U.S. tariffs against Canadian processed and manu- 

21 

factured copper. A request for an economic survey before permitting any 

gas export was voted down by the government. Possibility of export causing 

an increased rate to domestic consumers was also raised but rejected. 

H. J. MacDonald referred to the Dinning Commission recommendation "that 

Alberta needs should be protected for fifty years” and J. H. Prowse noted 

that applicants for export permits were now talking in terms of only a 
22 

twenty years supply.

The question of industry being obliged to come to Alberta if the gas 
were not exported was answered by N. E. Tanner, who stated that only dry 
gas was to be exported and that the by-products would remain in the province 
to encourage the industrial development. He gave an example of the by-pro¬ 
ducts which were obtainable from the 100,000,000 cubic feet of daily out¬ 
put from the Fincher Creek field. The amounts were: 3,000 barrels of wet 

gasoline, 770 barrels of butane, 350 barrels of propane and 4&Q tons of 
23 

sulphur. 

Approval was given in 1952 for gas esqport from the Peace River area to 

the Pacific coast by West coast Transmission Company. Other bids for export 

permits were rejected. Premier Manning reported that the reserves of the 

province were needed locally except for 300 billion cubic feet in the Peace 
24 

River area. 

New discoveries by 1953 had reached the point at which the Premier was 

able to state ,f that Alberta now is in the position that failure to provide 

an export market will have a ? very detrimental effect f on exploration, not 

25 

only for natural gas, but also for oil.” 

Before the Dinning Commission, the producers, especially the indepen¬ 
dents, had argued that export of gas would be an important incentive to the 
further search for oil, since the market for gas would provide an added 
source of revenue. The Commission noted, however, that even the indepen¬ 
dents were having substantial success in the search for oil; enough to justi¬ 
fy further exploration. Xt was admitted that new gas markets would encourage 
a more rapid search for oil, which still remained the strongest attraction.

but the question was whether "it is, at this time, in the public interest 

26 

to induce a more rapid search for oil."^ They concluded that there seemed 
to be sufficient impetus without adding more incentive, and that until ad¬ 
ditional facilities for oil disposal were available, the danger of serious 
surpluses on the market was present. 

In the following year, J. H. Prowse again raised the question of pro¬ 
tection for the domestic consumer, and argued that there was a need, for 

legislation "to protect the consumer against high prices of petroleum pro- 
27 

ducts," which presumably would result from gas export unless action was 
taken to prevent it. 

The Natural Gas Commission had referred to the fact that 

if the market for Alberta gas were expanded by the construction of 
transmission lines either east ©r west, or both ways, it will be neces¬ 
sary to build extensive gathering lines to or between many of the gas 
fields. 28 

In this regard, the government in 1954 passed the Alberta Gas Trunk 
Line Company Act, under vfoich it was intended to create a private company in 
which the government would have some control. Accordingly, the voting 
shares, called Class A, were divided into four groups, none of which could 
merge with any other. One group would go to the gas utility companies, who 
would have one director on the Board of Directors* Another was allocated to 
the gas export companies who also would have one director. A third group 
would go to the gas producers and processors, who would have three direc¬ 
tors. The fourth group vras reserved for persons appointed by the Alberta

government, which would have two directors on the Board, to represent the 

Alberta public at large. Two of the 2,002 voting shares were allocated to 

the government. In this connection J. H. Prowse argued that the two direc- 

29 

tors from the Province were "not able" to exercise useful control. 

The proven gas reserves had reached 14| trillion cubic feet by 1955, 
and of this amount, the Premier indicated that 4j trillion cubic feet were 
earmarked for export. The government was giving support to promotion by 
Trans-Canada Pipe-Lines Limited of a trans-continental line which would car¬ 
ry the gas gathered in Alberta fields to markets in the East. Nation-wide 
controversy developed in this case over the issue of the Dominion offering 
assistance to a private company in financing its ventures. 

In a special session of the legislature called in August, 1955, the 
Gas Resources Preservation Act was amended. More elaborate information was 
specified as being possibly required from an applicant for export permit. 

And even more emphasis was placed on the protection of public interest by the 
amendment to Section 7, (ss—2) of the original Act. which had prohibited the 
Board from granting an export permit unless the gas, "in the opinion of the 
Board, is surplus to the present and future needs of the people of the Pro¬ 
vince."^ This was further elaborated by applying "the test of public in¬ 
terest having regard to the present and future needs of the people of the 
Province, present reserves, and the trends in growth of reserves of gas in 

31 

the Province."

The amended Act had only a brief existence. It was repealed and re¬ 
placed by a new Act in the 1956 session* The purposes of this replacement 
were said to be the revision of the legislation in the light of experience 
and the simplification of administrative procedures. Included in the new 
Act were emergency provisions designed to counter any unforeseen threat to 
adequate domestic supplies by allowing theBoard to 

(a) adjust the allowable rates of production of gas from any well, 
pool or field, or, 

(b) require the diversion of any gas intended for industrial use out¬ 
side the Province to such other uses as the Board may direct. 

Also, exceptions to the Act were elaborated: 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Lieutenant-Gover¬ 
nor in Council, upon the recommendation of the Board, may, by general 
regulations or special orders, exclude from the application of this Act, 
under such conditions as may be prescribed, any special hydrocarbons 
that are removed or that are intended to be removed from the Province 
otherwise than by means of pipe lines* 32 

Thus legislative action moved to deal with the rapidly developing pro¬ 
blems of gas ex port and with the critical opposition to it. In spite of 
the opposition, the quantity exported increased from the small amounts taken 
by Pouce Coupe In British Columbia in 1951 to nearly 12 billion cubic feet 

in 1956, with the United States being the chief importer* The following 

33

In spite of the rapidly Increasing use of gas in Alberta, brought about 
largely be expanding industry and urban population, the exports had reached 
over 10 percent of total sales in 1956. By 1958, the eastern market, to¬ 
gether with the Pacific coast area, had contracted for export from Alberta 
of nearly 6 trillion cubic feet over the next twenty years, thus averaging 

Of 

about three times the 1956 volume of export. Unlike the demand for oil, 
which slumped in 1957 regardless of attempts to sell increased quantities, 
the gas demand Is in effect limited by the amount that Alberta is felt to 
have in excess of her own needs. 

In addition to the existing outlets, most urban centres across Canada 
will be supplied with natural gas from Alberta and the Peace River area of 
British Columbia by the end of 1958. This will be accomplished by the ex¬ 
tension of the Trans-Canada pipeline to Montreal, and the development of

its lateral lines across the country. The Westcoast Transmission Company, 
in 1957 completed its line to the Pacific coast of Canada and the North¬ 
west United States. In 1957 alone, over 2,000 miles of gathering and main 

35 

transmission gas lines were laid in Canada. 

Under these circumstances, it was to be expected that adjustments to 

pipe line legislation would be found necessary. The Pipe Line Act 1952 

Amendment Act of 1957 introduced a great variety of adjustments. Included 

in these was a change of authority in that the Minister of Mines and Minerals 

36 

took over responsibility for pipelines from the Minister of Highways. The 
single definition of a pipe line is replaced by definitions of a gas line as 
distinct from an oil line. In the case of new oil or gas lines, the Petro¬ 
leum and Natural Gas Conservation Board is required to notify the Minister 
of Mines and Minerals as to opinions or objections it may have regarding 
the line. 

The tendency of the many amendments is generally to place the control 
and supervision of pipe lines more firmly under the control of the Depart¬ 
ment of Mines and Minerals, and the Petroleum and Natural Gas Conservation 
Board. This development followed logically from the emphasis being placed 
on conservation, and on protection of the Alberta gas consumers in the mat¬ 
ter of gas export.

CHAPTER 9 

Summary 


Among the first major points of discussion concerning Alberta petro¬ 
leum policies was the matter of controlling the natural resources. The 
question as to whether it would have been better policy to have given the 
Province control of its resources in 1905 instead of in 1930 is extremely 
complex, and any conclusion could be challenged. 

In 193^, the Alberta government estimated that alienations permitted 
by the Dominion deprived the Province of royalties on about 48.5 percent 
of total oil production. This estimate was based on the fact that the C.P.R. 
and the Hudson 1 s Bay Company had their grants of land concentrated in the 
part of the Province south of the North Saskatchewan river, where most of 
the activity in petroleum production was taking place at that time. Con¬ 
sidering the Province as a whole, the percentage held by the Grown is great-

Saskatchewan, been more fully realized at the time when the major negotia¬ 
tions were being undertaken, it is likely that this factor would have re¬ 
ceived more consideration* 

Until the prairie provinces were sufficiently developed to administer 
their own affairs, the Dominion was inescapably charged with the respon¬ 
sibility for developing the area in the interests of the nation. For their 
services in this development, the G.P.R. and. the Hudson 1 s Bay Company had 

p 

been granted areas of 7,873*000 acres and. 1,631,000 acres respectively. 

At the time, it was hardly to b© expected that the Dominion could have eval¬ 
uated accurately the mineral wealth which these grants actually involved. 

The question as to whether the provincial control of the resources 
starting in 1903 instead of 1930 would have been an improvement, is sub¬ 
ject to a variety of considerations. Supervision of resource development 
by a local authority rather than by a remote authority assures closer con¬ 
tact and better understanding of problems in the field of operation. How¬ 
ever, the experience and general perspectives of the first Alberta adminis¬ 
trations would likely have suffered in comparison with those of the Dominion, 
since the latter had had several decades in which to become familiar with 
the problems connected with developing new territory. 

Special criticism was levelled at the Dominion for its policies of 
conservation with regard to petroleum and natural gas. The Alberta govern¬ 
ment brief to the 1938 Conference on Dominion-Provincial relations argued 
that the Dominion had no policy on conservation and that furthermore it 
maintained restrictions on provincial action, preventing the Alberta ad-

ministration from inaugurating a conservation scheme. To the extent that 
this objection was valid* it was rectified by subsequent revisions to the 
Natural Resources Transfer Agreement* which in effect gave the Province 
full freedom of action in conservation. Actually, the main obstacles to 
conservation in the early years of provincial administration appear to have 
been the result of misunderstandings and differences of opinion and objec¬ 
tive as between the Province and the operators. The government was interes¬ 
ted in the establishing of restricted flow and prorating of production, which 
to many operators represented arbitrary dictation and loss of opportunity 
to produce economically advantageous amounts. 

Thus, when the Turner Valley Conservation Board,began, in. 1932 , the 
application of its legislated conservation powers, it was challenged, not 
by the Dominion, but by the operators. 

Because of this situation, it can be argued that waste, in the sense 
of unnecessary losses, occurred. Much of the waste referred to in the first 
years of provincial administration was perhaps unavoidable if development 
was to proceed. Inadequate markets for gas, together with incomplete know¬ 
ledge of conservation techniques such as repressuring, combined with the in¬ 
ferior technology of those days to bring losses which would not be incurred 
under present conditions. Such losses must be balanced against an estimate 
of the losses which would have occurred if no production had taken place at 
that time. 

If it could be argued from this, therefore, that the early policies 
achieved the maximization of social benefits over time, then by our defini¬ 
tion, minimum waste and optimum conservation would have been achieved. 

However, as Ciriacy-Wantrup points out in his analysis, "...any state

of conservation may be called ^wasteful* if not based on best knowledge 
And in the early thirties, best knowledge was not being used in Alberta be¬ 
cause the measures which the government knew should be applied were not ap¬ 
plied* To some extent, this was a shortcoming of the early conservation 
statutes, which set out to achieve some measure of unified operation in the 
oil fields by seeking voluntary agreement among operators without full re¬ 
cognition of the factors which ensured hostility to such attempts. These 
factors included the assumption by many operators that when they struck oil 
or gas they would be permitted to produce at maximum flow, and for many, such 
maximum flow was needed to cover costs and to ensure a return on investment* 
Under such circumstances, it was hardly practical to expect acceptance of the 
severe curtailment of flow which conservation engineering required* 

This situation was set forth very well by the McGillivray Commission 
in 193 S# This report pointed out that the evils of the "Rule of Capture" 
could not be entirely overcome by prorationing, because the motivation still 
remained to drill excessively in order to take oil from neighbouring land, 
and as more wells were drilled, allowables for each would be reduced. The 
restricted production made overhead costs more formidable. Also, some opera¬ 
tors were encouraged to drill excessively in order that their prorated al¬ 
lowables would be sufficient to meet their refinery commitments* 

These problems were centred around Turner Valley, where unorganized de¬ 
velopment was well advanced, and the matter of equities was an important 
factor which had to be balanced against the general losses which were being 
incurred as a result of unrestricted output. The annual reports of the

government throughout the 1930s indicate that the officials concerned were 
far from satisfied with the results of the compromi.se policies which they 
attempted. 

Both the operators and the government gradually adjusted to the cir¬ 
cumstances. At first* there was some litigation against the government’s 
rulings, but with little success. On the other hand* the McGillivray Com¬ 
mission criticized the "dictatorial powers" of the Board under the 1931 Oil 
and Gas Wells Act* and the X93& Oil and Gas Resources Conservation Act. It 
was recommended that both these Acts b© repealed. Consultation with the in¬ 
dustry in drafting new legislation was asked. Definitions of terms, such 
as "waste" were required. Clearer statements of Board powers and of appeal 
methods were suggested, lo some extent these recommend at ions were achieved, 
in subsequent legislation. 

In spite of consistent recognition of the desirability of unit opera¬ 
tion in new fields* where the conflicts of equity were not yet a factor* 
this method did not develop significantly when new discoveries were made 
outside Turner Valley. To some extent* acreages under a single management 
were increased by the policy of greatly extending the maximum areas per¬ 
mitted to any one applicant for prospecting and development. At the same 
time* complete monopoly of new fields was checked by the establishment of 
the Crown reserve system* whereby the holder of a petroleum and natural gas 
reservation could lease only half of the acreage in any township. 

By 1946* sane voluntary unit operations were in effect, but on a very 
small scale. More agreements were reported in 1956. But by 1958* a Saskat¬ 
chewan plan by four major oil companies for unit operation in conjunction 
with an experimental water flood project was unusual enough to be considered 
newsworthy in Alberta oil circles, "...the interested companies felt that

by unitization, equitable sharing of know-how, equipment and labor forces 
could be achieved.”^ This, in effect, was what Alberta government ad¬ 
visers were saying in 1930. 

Perhaps in an attempt to stimulate voluntary unitization, the Alberta- 
government in 1957 passed legislation permitting government enforcement of 
such unitization, with only proclamation being required to put the legisla¬ 
tion into effect. At the same time agreements for unit operation were an¬ 
nounced in an area near Jumping Pound, northwest of Calgary, in a section of 
the Acheson pool near Winterburn, and in the Westerose field south of Leduc. 
It still remains to be seen whether the example of these groups will become 
widespread before the government feels obliged to use compulsion. 

Severe criticisms of Alberta petroleum and natural gas policies arose 
over the questions of gas gathering and gas export. The main points of 
criticism arose over possible lack of adequate future supplies of gas for 
Alberta, possible excessive prices to local consumers, and possible lack 
of adequate government control over the gas gathering system in the Province. 

Since the initial controversies, the matter of future supplies for the 
Province has become less urgent. In 1949* when the question was first get¬ 
ting serious consideration, the highest estimate made by the Dinning Com¬ 
mission was an aggregate Alberta withdrawal of 12.23 trillion cubic feet of 

5 

gas over the following fifty years. Nine years later, the Petroleum and 
Natural Gas Conservation Board estimated the Province's potential reserves 
at 60 to 80 trillion cubic feet. Such developments, combined with the fact

that practical use of nuclear energy is now much more tangible, tend to 
weaken the arguments that local fuel shortages will arise. 

However, controversy is still high over the pricing of natural gas. 
Exporting companies say that export, by cutting overhead costs, can ac¬ 
tually reduce prices to local consumers. Critics point to such price dif¬ 
ferentials as 22 cents per Mcf for Canadian gas to American consumers, while 
Canadian consumers across the border pay at least 10 cents more. Producers 
justify this on the basis of volume used,. Officials of Westcoast Transmis¬ 
sion Company have told the Borden Energy Commission that United, States 
consumers have agreed to take twice the volume of gas daily as will be taken 
by those in British Columbia. The proportional transportation costs al¬ 
located to the latter would therefore be 44 cents per Mcf, whereas the cost 
to the United States would be ,f about 2lJ cents. n The chairman of the 
Borden Energy Commission replied by saying that the 22 cents being charged 
the American buyer was !f far too low.* 1 As yet this issue is far from settled. 

The question of government control over the Alberta gas gathering system 
cannot be judged entirely by the fact that the Alberta government was greatly 
outnumbered in voting shares and in directors. By having such representa¬ 
tion, the government achieved what was probably its main purpose, to have 
inside contact with the affairs of the system. With such information, the 
need for direction or control can readily be ascertained, and it would seem, 
that ample power exists in other Acts concerning petroleum and natural gas 
to enable the necessary control to be effected.

marketing policy on the petroleum industry, although the effect of avail¬ 
able markets on production and conservation has been indicated. The current 
market slump due to world market fluctuations has brought forth criticism of 
development policies by which new drilling and development have received 
great encouragement. It has been argued that if less new drilling had been 
done in the last few years, the capacity of fields already in production 
would now be more fully utilized, leading to economies in production costs. 
This would imply that the government should have been able to forecast cor¬ 
rectly the current developments in the world petroleum market. 

Such a situation emphasises the fact that some of the factors entering 
into decisions as to production, conservation, exploration and marketing 
policies are necessarily based on estimates which may include a consider¬ 
able amount of guesswork. 

The best policy in any case will probably be t he one which eliminates 
guesswork as far as possible, using instead the most advanced available 
technological and scientific information. This standard certainly appears 
to have been achieved by the Alberta Natural Gas Commission of 1949* since 
its conclusions have to a large extent been validated by subsequent develop¬ 
ments, and while its estimates of future reserves, for example, were some¬ 
what conservative, this tendency leaned toward the protection oi future Al¬ 
berta supplies, which was one of the Commission’s responsibilities. 

The many changes and amendments in Alberta legislation pertaining to 
petroleum and natural gas might lead to the interpretation that incompe¬ 
tence was involved. However, it is true of the best legislation that prac¬ 
tical experience with it will indicate improvements, even when conditions 
remain stable. With rapidly changing conditions such as have occurred in 
the Alberta petroleum history, legislative adjustments become imperative.

The need for restricted production in the 1930s changed abruptly to the 
need for maximum wartime output. The condition of declining southern 
fields being the main source of supply was suddenly reversed with the new 
northern discoveries. The vast new supplies of oil and gas changed the 
Province from the status of importer to that of an eager exporter. New 
techniques of exploring, drilling, repressuring, and conservation greatly 
altered the regulatory requirements. Under such conditions, the surest 
sign of incompetence would have been static legislation. This is not to 
imply that all of the legislation was perfect at the time it was passed, 
or that some of the many amendments could not have been avoided. But it 
does indicate the certainty that many and frequent changes were essential, 
and that avoidance of inadequacies often would have required an ability to 
foresee the future which cannot be expected of an average legislator. 

The current marketing difficulties, which affect almost every aspect 
of petroleum and natural gas policy, are an example• Policy in such cases 
must often be based on psychological and political factors, both national 
and international, which are quite beyond the control and estimations of a 
provincial authority. In such cases the legislation must often be largely 
an adjustment to circumstances as they arise.
