CHAPTER I 


INTRODUCTION 

This survey is restricted to a study of fifty 
two-room high schools in Alberta, as at June 30, 1943. 
The fifty schools include two somewhat distinct types: 

(1) A school operated by two teachers, one 
the principal, the other his assistant, 
who together instruct students in four 
grades. Grades IX to XII inclusive. 

(2) A school operated by two teachers in 
which instruction is given to students 

in three grades, Grades X to XII inclusive. 
One other significant difference between the types of 
high school lies in the number of credits that may be 
offered each year to high school students. Twenty-five 
two-room high schools of each of the above types were 
selected at random for detailed study. (See page two). 

This study was made possible through the kind 
co-operation and sympathetic attitude of Dr. H. C. 
Newland, Supervisor of Schools, Department of Education, 
Edmonton, Alberta, He made accessible the record cards 
of graduate and non-graduate students and permitted 
several interviews from which valuable information was 
obtained. Mr. B. E. Walker, Director, Examinations 
Branch, Department of Education, Edmonton, Alberta gave 
valuable assistance and direction in the use of

departmental files. Mr. Walker and his staff co-operated 
wonderfully at a time when the rush of conducting sup¬ 
plemental examinations was at its peak. The kindness of 
Dr. W. H. Swift, Chief Inspector of Schools, in granting 
the writer leave-of-absence from the Acadia Division in 
order to study the files of the Examinations Branch must 
also be acknowledged. 

It is necessary to mention, furthermore, the 
assistance given by the principals of the fifty schools 
studied. A list of graduate students in 1940, 1941, 

1948, and 1943, was sent to the principal of each school 
with the request that he enumerate after each name the 
occupation of the student immediately after graduation, 
and his or her occupation as at November 31, 1943. The 
response was excellent. Each principal was asked, too, 
to describe and evaluate Typewriting la, General Shop, 
and Home Economics, if taught in the school. The 
response to this request was also excellent. Gratitude 
is extended to the principals of these schools. 

This study is concerned, primarily, with the 
records of students who entered high school in each of 
the fifty two-room high schools and who completed their 
high school training, either wholly or in part, in the 
same school. Occasionally there is distinction made 
between the two types of high schools, hence it has been 
necessary to develop the outline of the study to some 
extent dually. The distinction, for the most part, 
however, is relative. 




The records of students who entered high school 
in any of the schools and who completed their high school 
training elsewhere have not been included in the study. 

On the other hand, the records of students who started 
high school elsev/here, and who attended one of the selected 
two-room high schools commencing at the Grade XL or 
Grade XII level, have been studied and are included as a 
third entity in this outline. Where feasible, however, 
the records of these students have been grouped with 
those of the two former classes. 

At the beginning of the study the names of all 
students who wrote the Grade IX examination in each of 
the fifty selected centers in the years 1937, 1938, 1939, 
and 1940, were listed. Some of these, of course, dis¬ 
continued school at this level and no further study was 
made of their cards. The following tables indicate the 
classification of such students on the basis of their 
Grade IX examination results:

To the list of students from the fifty centers 
were added the names of students who came from outside 
centers to take G-rade X. These names were determined 
from the Confidential Reports of the principals submitted 
during the years 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943. 
From the Confidential Reports it was possible, too, to 
obtain the names of students who came to the two-room 
high schools at the Grade XI and/or Grade XII levels. 

From the cumulative card of each student it was possible 
to determine the Grade IX classification of each student, 
the year in which he commenced high school, the subjects 
he took in any year, as well as the number of credits he 
earned each year. 

More than 3, 197 cards were studied, out of which 
2,828 cards were selected for more intensive review, 
summarization, and study. 

The primary purpose of this study is the accum¬ 
ulation of statistical information concerning the work 
of the two-room high school, the number of credits its 
students of varying abilities earn each year, the 
subject-matters taught, and the usefulness of two-room 
high schools in meeting the needs of the community.

It will become apparent from the data collected 
that the two-room high school is not an unbiased in¬ 
stitution in that it does not give the same educational 
opportunity to all students of varying abilities; that 
the three-year high school programme at present in 
vogue in Alberta high schools should not be attempted 
by the two-room high school; that the present subject- 
matters taught in the two-room high school do not pro¬ 
vide for the civic needs of the average high school 
student; and, that the two-room high school does not 
meet entirely the needs of the rural community. 

As a result of conclusions reached, there will be 
included a few recommendations for consideration by 
those who read this report.

or a conditioned promotion, is required to take the 
Compulsory Subjects and, where facilities permit, he may 
elect optional subjects to fill out the first-year 
programme. He may not elect any academic electives 
during the first year in high school.^ As stated 
above, pupils receiving a "D” standing are required to 
repeat the Grade IX course. 

It is apparent, considering that the number of 
credits which may be offered in any two-room high school 
is restricted, that it is virtually impossible to 
include a sufficient number of credits each year to 
satisfy the needs of the three classes of students, 
i.e., the "B”, and students, and at the same 

time arrange a programme whereby the more efficient 
students may graduate from high school in the minimum 
time of three years. As a matter of fact, it is 
impossible to reconcile the three-year programme with 
the needs of the three classes of students where the 
high school has only two rooms. 

This means, in effect, that in any two-room high 
school offering a purely academic type of programme in 
an effort to meet the needs of the ^^A»» students, there 
is an apparent neglect to provide for the less proficient 
and ”G” students. More specifically, there is an

Programme of Studies, 1944. 






obvious weakness in the attempt to meet the needs of 
the student. If this statement were false, then 
practically the same proportion of and 

students should graduate from two-room high schools 
each year. 

Table I indicates in what proportion the various 
classes of students graduated from twenty-five two-room 
high schools, G-rades IX - XII. The graduating students 
entered high school in one of the following years: 1937, 
1938, 1939, and 1940. 

It will be noted that only 27.8% of all students 
who started to school in the twenty-five high schools 
over a period of four years graduated. Only 4.4% of them 
graduated with matriculation requirements, while 12.2% 
graduated with Normal Entrance. Of more particular 
interest, however, is the fact that of 540 students, 
223, or 41.3% graduated. In a group of 387 students 
only o9, or 15.2% of the original group graduated. From 
an original group of 130 students, only 6, or 4.6% 
were successful in obtaining a high school diploma. It 
is unquestionably true, therefore, that students with 
lower classification leave the high school before 
graduation in greater numbers than the more academically- 
inclined students.

The story told by Table II, which has reference 
to twenty-five two-room high schools, Grades X - XCI, is 
not much better. In these schools, during the same 
period of time, 30.5?^ of those who entered high school 
graduated with a high school diploma. Of 540 
students enrolled at one time in Grade X, E66 or 49.3^ 
were successful in obtaining a diploma. From an original 
group of 417 students, 72, or 17.3?^ of them 
successfully completed Grade 211. Only 5 out of 169 
students, or 3^ of the original group, graduated. 

The screening of the weaker students appears to be far 
out of proportion to that of the more capable students. 

Students with low Grade 12 classifications who 
came to the fifty two-room high schools at the Grade 21 
and/or Grade 2II levels fared little better. (Tables 
III and IV). While the percentage of and students 
receiving diplomas is a little higher than that of 
students who had been in regular attendance, it is 
evident, still, that the more capable students have a 
much superior chance of receiving a high school diploma. 

Why is it that in a class of 1,423 students 
(Table V) 649, or 45.6^ of them are able to graduate, 
while in a class of 1,022 ”B” students only 177, or 
17.3^ of the original group receive diplomas, and in a 
class of 383 ”0” students only 18, or 4.7% of the 
original group successfully complete Grade 2II?

For the most part, an student is so classified 
because of his innate or native ability to learn easily 
and to remember long. The student is so classified 
because of his lesser academic ability. Whatever the 
difference may be, all students classified or 

as a result of the Grade IX examination are permitted 
to enter high school under the conditions already noted. 

In the first year of high school the ”C” student 
virtually faces a stone wall. He may select all of the 
compulsory subjects, if they are offered, making a total 
of 13 credits. He may not choose a single academic 
elective. He may select all the first-year general 
electives offered, providing that his total number of 
credits taken does not exceed thirty-five. This policy 
is not too adverse. However, the more capable students, 
possibly in the majority, must have their needs attended 
to first. This means, in effect, that whatever time the staff 
has left may be devoted to such subjects as may satisfy 
the req_uirements of the less academically-minded student. 

The amount of this time, generally, is reduced to a 
minimum. The first general elective usually selected is 
General Mathematics 1. The "C” student chooses this 
course, but since time does not, in the majority of two- 
room high schools, permit instruction in the second unit 
of this subject the second year, the student must forgo

the credits which he has earned in this subject in order 
that he may elect mathematical academic electives the 
following year. 

In this manner the student reverts to the 
status of one pursuing an academic course, a result which 
may not be due entirely to his own planning. Furthermore 
the student being no better than a student to begin 
with, must attain a "B" standing in General Mathematics 1 
before he may be permitted to enroll in either Algebra 1 
or Geometry 1. The same principle holds true with 
respect to the Sciences, i.e., the student must attain 
a standing in each of these subjects before he may 
elect the following unit in the same subject. Imagine 
the difficulty of attempting to attain a "B’^ standing 
with but ability. 

Although this state of affairs is not due to 
deficiencies in the two-room high school, time does not 
permit a staff of two to offer a sufficient number of 
subjects to suit capabilities of different classes of 
students. Insofar as the needs of the majority of 
students are partially met in the two-room high school, 
it is an unprejudiced institution. Insofar as the needs 
of the more capable students are satisfied to the almost 
total neglect of the inferior, or less academically- 
minded students, the two-room high school is one-sided 
and discriminatory. 






How Certain Flezibilities Y/ithin The 
Organization of the Two-Room High School 
Are Beneficial to Weaker Students: 

1. Both types of two-room high schools are permitted by 

the ’Regulations’ of the Department of Education to 

reduce the amount of time ordinarily devoted to each 

subject. 

”In schools where two teachers are doing the work of 
Grades IX, X, XI, and XII, the amount of instruction time 
per period shall be at least 65jS of the standard requirement. 
On this basis, the number of instruction periods available 
will be 123, of which 33 shall be devoted to Grade IX work 
and the remaining 90 to the work of Grades X, XI and XII. 

"In schools of this type it will be possible for some 
of the students to complete the high-school progranmie in 
three years, and to earn the maximum of thirty-five (35) 
credits a year. 

"In schools where two teachers are giving instruction 
in Grades X, XI, and XII, the amount of instruction time 
per period shall be at least 85 per cent of the standard 
requirement. On this basis 94 periods per week will be - 
available for instruction, which may be distributed 
amongst Grades X, XI, and XII. 

By taking advantage of a system of shorter periods 

of instruction, more credits may be offered each year 

than ordinarily might be offered if strict enforcement 

were required. By this means the needs of all high < 

school students may be met in a very limited way.

2. Should the ’^0” student be so unfortunate as to attend 
a two-room high school where teachers have no special 
qualifications, and should the student decide 
not to forgo the credits earned in any subject, the 
total number of credits which he might earn in any 
number of years* attendance would be very limited. 
However, if teachers have special qualifications in 
many, or all of the subjects at present requiring 
special qualifications for instruction, more credits 
may be obtained by the lower-classified students by 
virtue of the fact that more general electives may be 
included in the programme. Special qualifications of 
teachers are of great value to the weaker student in 
permitting him to choose from a wider range of 
subjects v/ithin the scope of his intellect. 

3. In addition to the above, the **C” student may attend 
the two-room high school as long as he desires, i.e., 
if an insufficient number of subjects are offered in 
three years from which he may choose, he may remain 

a fourth, fifth, or sixth year in the two-room high 
school in an effort to obtain credits in general 
electives which, because of the policy of staggering, 
are not offered every year in the high-school programme. 
He has, in addition, recourse to the correspondence 
courses offered through the Correspondence Branch of 
the Department of Education as a means of supplementing 




I 


the meager programme which he can obtain at the two- 
room high school. He may choose, too, to forgo the 
credits which he earned in General Mathematics 1 in 
order that he may have an opportunity of progressing 
along the same lines as the more capable student. 

Aside from these encouraging factors, there is very 
little else either in the ’Regulations* or in the organiz¬ 
ation of the average two-room high school that would 
stimulate the student to remain long in the school. 

As some wit has aptly said, "The student generally 
lasts two years in the average rural high school; the 
first year is spent in attempting to fall in line, the 
second year is spent in being pushed out again. 

Conclusions 

1. There are but two choices for the "C” or weaker student 
in the two-room high school: He must select an academic* 
course by reason of forgoing credits in certain 
electives; or he must drop out of school before 
obtaining the high school diploma. Unfortunately, in 
95.3% of the cases, "C” students elect the latter 
alternative. 

2. The academic courses are still the most popular in the 
high school. The truth of this statement may be 
determined from the fact that "A" and ”B", and even "C" 
students choose academic electives whenever allowed.

Students in general, and many teachers, seem to 
magnify the importance of academic subjects so that 
the procedure of sacrificing credits in general 
electives in order that academic electives might be 
attempted is now quite common. This attitude is 
tolerated despite the objections which educators offer 
to the procedure. However, aside from offering 
objections and making critical suggestions, very 
little has been done to eliminate or remedy the 
condition . 

Students with varying abilities in high school have 
not the same educational opportunities. The more 
mentally alert students, because they are in the 
majority, have their needs attended to by virtue of 
the emphasis in the small two-room high school on 
the academic subjects. This is the main reason why 
45.6^ of the students graduate from small high 
schools in Alberta. The students, next in 
importance because of their numbers, receive secondary 
consideration from educational authorities; further¬ 
more, students, in the majority of cases, can 
carry on with academic electives quite successfully. 
Despite this possibility, however, only 17.3^ of 
the "B” students attending two-room high schools were 
successful in obtaining a high school diploma. 





The students because of their inferior ability 
cannot master the academic courses of the high school 
programme. As a result of this characteristic, 
because of the rigidity of Departmental Regulations, 
and because of the limited offerings in two-room high 
schools which can satisfy the needs, interests, and 
capacities of the less capable student, it becomes 
glaringly evident that in the two-room high school 
there is not equality of educational opportunity. 

The small high school may, therefore, be justly termed 
a discriminatory institution. 




CHAPTER III 


THE FOUR-YEAR HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAMME 

The final chapter of this work will be devoted to 
a study of the remedial measures which might be adopted 
to advantage in the two-room rural high school in an 
effort to make the Alberta Curriculum in such schools as 
all-embracing as circumstances at the present time will 
permit. In the present chapter it is proposed to review 
a recommendation in which the Department of Education is 
vitally interested, namely, the adoption of a four-year 
programme in the high schools of Alberta. One must 
appreciate the fact that the addition of one year to the 
programme in Alberta high schools would necessitate adding 
Grade Till to follow the present terminating year, Grade XII. 
As a natural result of introducing Grade XIII into Alberta 
high schools, the curriculum would follow the 6-3-4® plan 
rather than the 6-3-3 plan at present in operation. 

Before discussing the merits of the four-year high 
school programme, it might be advantageous to look over 
the records of the fifty two-room high schools under survey 
in an effort to determine the logical basis for an 
argument.

Disregarding individual years, therefore, the 
following tables indicate what has been done in two-room 
high schools with respect to graduating students in three 
years. The assumption is that if the majority of students 
in such schools are able to successfully complete their 
high school courses, i.e., obtain a high school diploma 
in three years, an argument in favor of the four-year plan 
does not rest on solid ground. On the other hand if it 
can be indicated that the majority of students graduating 
from two-room high schools take four years or more to 
accomplish their purpose, then a good argument can be 
advanced for the adoption of the four-year high school 
programme. 

The best picture is obtained by studying the records 
of all students from the time they enter high school until 
they leave it. However, if students are included who have 
had no opportunity to remain in high school four years, 
the balance of the present picture will not be maintained. 
For this reason the cards of students who commenced high 
school training in the fall term of 1937, 1938, and 1939 
only, have been studied. 

From Table VI we learn that only 25.1% of the 
graduating students who were in regular attendance at two- 
room high schools. Grades IS - SII, graduate in three years 
Of this number, all but one were students. The picture 
is altered somewhat when students coming in at the Grade XI

and Grade XII levels are included. Wcien the records of 
these students are included, approximately twenty graduates 
out of each one hundred are able to obtain diplomas in 
three years. Of this number all but one were again 
students. The main reason for the lowered percentage in 
the latter instance lies in the fact that, for the most 
part, students coming into the two-room high schools to 
complete their high school education are from adjacent 
one-room miral public schools where they have been taking 
Grade X at school or by correspondence, or, they may have 
come from the senior rooms of small two-room rural schools. 
Such students have not had an opportunity to earn sufficient 
credits in the first year of high school to enable them 
to graduate in three years. Then, too, many students find 
it extremely difficult to adjust their programmes to fit 
in with the programme of the larger school because of the 
lack of previous planning. It will be noted that only 
five out of eighty-eight such students were successful in 
obtaining a diploma in three years. It is quite possible, 
of course, that these five students came from other two- 
room high schools or from larger schools. It will be 
noted, too, that of 377 graduates from the twenty-five 
two-room high schools, 89 students came from outside points 
at the Grade XI or Grade XII levels. This represents 
S3.6^ of the total number of graduates. This type of 
high school apparently serves as a finishing school for 
students coming from outlying rural areas.

Table VII indicates how diplomas were earned by 
students in the twenty-five two-room high schools 
Grrades 2 - 2II during the same time. Students in regular 
attendance fared a little better than such students in 
the former type of high school. Approximately 30 out of 
each one hundred graduates were able to secure a high school 
diploma in three years. The entire picture, once again, 
is altered by the inclusion of graduates who came in at 
the G-rade 21 and Grade 2II levels. If all graduates are 
considered, only 3£.2^ are found to have successfully 
completed their high school career in three years. It is 
important to note that only three out of one hundred 
twenty-four graduates coming in at the Grade 21 or Grade 2II 
levels graduated in three years. Of the total number of 
437 graduates, 134, or 38.4^ came from outside points at 
the Grade 21 or Grade 2II levels. Not only, then, does 
this type of high school succeed in passing more students, 
on the average, within three years, but its record as a 
finishing school shows a little improvement over the 
smaller high school. It is quite apparent that the two- 
room high school, as a finishing school, serves to a 
creditable degree, the needs of the community at large. 

In Table VIII the combined results may be observed 
for all graduates during the years, 1940, 1941, and 1943. 

Of 793 graduates only 169, or 31.3?^ of the total were able 
to secure diplomas in three years. If the 53 graduates in

1943 are included so that a four-year survey of graduates 
may be had, 221 out of 844 graduates, or 26.2% have been 
.successful in obtaining a high school diploma in less than 
four years. This number represents but 7.8% of the original 
number of students who attended the fifty two-room high 
schools between the years 1937 and 1943 inclusive and who 
had the opportunity of graduating within a three-year 
period. It seems unfortunate that a high school programme 
should be based on a three-year arrangement merely to 
accommodate 7.8% of the total number of students in 
attendance, or even to accommodate 26.2% of the graduates. 

The ”A” student-graduates predominate in this group. 
Of 221 students who were able to graduate in three years 
from two-room high schools over a four-year period, 208, 
or 94.1% of the total class were students. Of the 
remaining number 13 were students who represented 
5.9% of the total class. Not a single student of the 
18 who graduated had the distinction of graduating in 
three years. 

Further light is shed on the picture by reviewing 
the progress of those students who remained in the two- 
room high school for one year only, for two years only, 
for three years, and for four or more years. For the 
sake of clarity the group is again divided: 

1. Including those students who have spent all their 
time in the two-room high school.

2. Those students who have come from outside points to 


the two-room high school at the Grade XI or Grade XII 
levels. 

To simplify comparison, there has been no differentiation 
made between the two types of high school, nor any 
distinction made among the three classes of students 
(”A”, "B” and ”C”)- It should be noted that students 
classified within the three-year and four-year periods 
may, or may not, still be in attendance at high school. 

All that has been desired is to obtain a picture of what 
students accomplish who have been in school a definite 
period of time. Each table is accompanied by a graph in 
an effort to reveal more clearly the grouping of students 
within any particular range of credits earned. 

Table IZ shows what 312 students accomplished 
during the one year which they spent in high school, i.e., 
the table and graph show the progress made in the 
accumulation of credits by 312 students who dropped out 
of two-room high schools at the end of Grade X. Their 
classification is as follows:

It will be seen that the greatest grouping of 
students lies within the range 30 - credits. A far greater 
number of students, however, obtained less than this 
number. The mean number of credits secured by the 312 
students in the first year at high school was 24.87 with 
a standard deviation of 6.80 credits. The median number 
of credits secured by the 312 students was 25.93. It 
would appear quite impossible to reconcile the present 
three-year high school programme, which presupposes that 
students will achieve approximately 35 credits in one year 
at high school, with this finding. 

Table X shows what 484 students accomplished who 
remained in attendance at two-room high schools for a two- 
year period only. Graph II again simplifies the picture.

ment in the average number of credits secured each year by 
students. No doubt this is a result of the improved status 
of the and students who during the second year at

The mean number of credits secured by the 484 students in 
two years’ attendance at two-room high schools is 53.53 
with a standard deviation of 11.18 credits. The median 
number of credits is 54.50.

15.45 credits. The median number of credits for three

Table XII and Graph IV shows the distribution of 
credits earned by 595 students who were in attendance at 
two-room high schools for four or more years. The greatest 
grouping of this class lies in the range of 100 - 109

I Humber of Credits 































































As a check on the above survey the cards of the 
645 students who came to two-room high schools at the 
G-rade XL and Grade XLI levels were examined. As might 
be expected, the results do not present as favorable a 
picture as the results obtained from the study of cards 
representative of students in regular attendance at 
these schools. 

ur\cL 

Tables XIII, XIVXV as well as Chart V indicate 
the distribution of credits earned by such students over 
three periods of time. As these students had already 
earned credits in Grade X before entering the schools 
under survey, no importance was attached to their attain¬ 
ment of credits during the first year of high school. 

Table XIII reveals that the mean number of credits 
secured by 78 students who were in attendance for two 
years only was 51.80 with a standard deviation of 9.27 
credits. The median number of credits secured was 52.35. 

The mean number of credits secured by each of 214 
students over a three-year period was 76.30, with a 
standard deviation of 13.46 credits. The median number 
of credits secured over a three-year period was 75.44. 

(Table XIV) 

Table XV revelas that the mean number of credits 
secured by each of 353 students who attended four or more 
years v/as 100.33 with a standard deviation of 11.18 credits. 
The median number of credits secured by the same group over 
the same length of time was 102.31.

In each histogram representing the groupings of 
students who were in regular attendance, there is a definite 
tendency for congested groupings at the extreme uppermost 
end of the range. This characteristic is not found in the 
charts representing credits earned by 595 students who were 
in regular attendance at two-room high schools four years 
or more, hence the ideal or normal curve is more closely 
approximated from this graph. The same remarks hold true 
for each of the graphs representing how many credits were 
earned by students who came to two-room high schools at the 
Grade XI or Grade XII levels. The normal curve is 
apparently most clearly approximated from graphs rep¬ 
resenting credits earned by students who have remained in 
high school for at least four years. 

From the fact that the mean number of credits 
earned by 595 students in regular attendance at two-room 
high schools over a four-or-more-years* period was 102,67, 
and from the further fact that the mean number of credits 
earned by 353 students over a similar period was 100.33 
credits, it is evident that the three-year high school 
programme does not provide sufficient time for the 
average student to attain the 100 credits necessary for 
graduation.

A third method of approach lies in determining what 


each class of student (”A”, or was able to 

accomplish during the length of time he or she attended 
the two-room high school. In this study the total number 
of students in regular attendance at the fifty two-room 
schools will be considered. There will be no differentiation 
made between the two types of high school. The records of 
students who came in at the Grade XI and Grade :SII levels 
will not be taken into consideration. 

The classification of these students, without 
regard to attendance in years, is as follows:

The following series of tables, (XVI, 2VII, XVIII, 
XIX, XX, XXI, XXII, XXIII, XXIV, XXV, XXVI, and XXVII) are 
indicative, at least to some extent, of the relative 
abilities of the different classes of students. 

Table XVI reveals that the mean number of credits 
secured by a group of 78 students who were in atten¬ 
dance at two-room high schools was 21.£. This does not 
mean, necessarily, that the ’’C” student is incapable of

taking more credits, but it does serve to show, comparatively 
speaking, that the student is discriminated against 
with respect to the number of credits made available to 
him in the first year of high school. 

Table XVII indicates the distribution of credits 
earned by 142 students who attended two-room high 
schools for but one year. The mean number of subjects 
taken by students thus classified is 24,5 —» a slight 
improvement over the position of the ”0” student. 

Table XVIII shows the distribution of credits as 
earned by 92 students who remained but one year in 
two-room high schools. The mean number of credits taken 
per student, 28.5, indicates clearly that the position of 
the student is superior to that of the less efficient 
and students. 

Tables XIX, XX, and XXI indicate the distribution 
of credits earned by ”C”, ”B” and ”A” students who have 
been in attendance in two-room high schools for a two- 
year period only. Once again the and ”B” students 
achieve a lesser number of credits per period than the 
”A’’ students. In two years ”C” students earn 44.9, 

”B” students earn 52.5, and "A” students earn 59.3 credits 
on the average. The mean number of credits earned in the 
two-year period is proportionately greater for each class 
of students than in the case of students who remained but 
one year in high school.

Tables XXII, XXIII, and XXIV show the distribution 
of credits earned by and students who have been 

in attendance at two-room high schools for a three-year 
period. The mean number of credits earned in each of the 
two lower classes is again proportionately lower than the 
mean number of credits earned in the class. The mean 
number of credits earned by each of 79 students over 
the three-year period is 69.6, as compared with a mean of 
79.5 credits earned by students, and a mean of 93.8 
credits earned by ”A’’ students. 

The mean number of credits earned by ^B”, and 

”A” students who were in attendance at two-room high schools 
for a four-year period or more was 92.8, 99.97, and 105.5 
credits respectively. (Tables XXV, XXVI, and XXVII). 

The evidence derived from data in these tables 
indicates conclusively that the two-room high school does 
not enable the average student to earn a sufficient number 
of credits in three years to graduate with a high school 
diploma. Only over a four-year period do students from the 
two upper classes (”A” and ^B”) earn a sufficient number 
of credits,on the average, to graduate. The student, 
possibly because of the rigidity of the ’Regulations*, 
combined with the inability of programmes in two-room 
schools to provide for this type of student, cannot, under 
existing conditions, ever hope to graduate from the two- 
room high school in less than four years.

A fourth approach, and one closely related to the 
preceding one, is to investigate the records of students 
who discontinued school before graduating, emphasizing 
in particular the different classes of students as dif“ 
ferentiated by the Grade IX examination. For the purpose 
of comparison the records of the two types of high school 
will here be considered separately. Only the records of 
those students who did not successfully complete Grade XII 
will be studied. The non=-gradus,tes who came into two-room 
high schools at the senior levels will not be included. 

Table ICCVIII indicates how and when the different 
classes of students ceased attending the two-room high schools 
without graduating. In the twenty-five two-room high schools, 
Grades IX - XII, over a four-year period 39 students 
discontinued school at the end of the first year as compared 
with 47 students, and 70 students. In each class 
this represents 30^, 8.7^, and 18.1% of the respective 
totals leaving at the end of the first year of school. It 
is interesting to note that the weaker students left in 
greater proportion at the end of the first year than did 
the more capable students. The same situation prevailed 
at the end of the second year of high school. By that time 
approximately 12/SO of the students had discontinued, 

approximately 9/20 of the ’^B” students had likewise stopped 
their schooling, while only a little more than 5/20 of the 
’^A” students had ceased attending. It is of further 
interest to note that 81.6^ of the students leave

school before completing Grade XII; 69.5% of the 

students discontinue while only or less than half of 

1 - 

the students leave high school without completing 
Grade XII. At the end of the school year 1942“19435 
approximately the same proportion of each class of students 
was still in attendance. 

The picture in the twenty-five two-room high schools, 
Grades X - XII, is not much better. Table XXIX reveals that 
by the end of the first year 13.9% of the original total of 
1,126 Grade X’s had left school. This represents 23.1% of 
the C*s, 17.3% of the B*s and only 8.3% of the A’s. By 
the end of the second year of high school almost 12/20 of 
the ”0” students and more than 8/20 of the ’^B” students, 
as compared with less than 5/20 of the ”A” students had 
completed their high school training at this level. Over 
the four-year period, 83,4% of the students had decided 
to leave the high school; 69.5% of the ”B” students had 
left, while only 39.3% of the students had quit the 
high school with incomplete training. 

The data contained in Table XXX shows the combined 
results for the fifty two-room high schools over the four- 
year period. Of 2,183 students who originally entered 
high school in the fifty schools, 1,269 or 58.1% had 
halted their education before graduating. This does not 
include 283 students who were still in attendance at the 
end of the school year 1942-1943, many of whom have 
pr^obably left high school since that time.

More than J of the "C” students discontinued school 
at the end of the first year, and a further l/3 of them 
followed suit at the end of the second year. Hence more 
than i of the total number of students had left high 
school by the end of the second year. More than 2/5 of 
the students had ceased attending by that time, while 
only a trifle more than J of the students had quit 
the two-room high schools. 

Of an original group of 299 students, 82,6% had 
definitely stopped school before graduating. Of an 
original group of 804 students, 559, or 69,5% did not 
graduate. Out of the original group of students, only 
463, or 42.8?^ discontinued their high school courses 
before completing G-rade XII. Approximately the same 
proportion of all classes of students were still in high 
school at the end of the 1942-1943 school year. 

IVhile it may be generally admitted that the weaker 
student because of low native ability, poor work habits, 
or scholastic maladjustment cannot keep pace with the more 
capable student, it does not seem reasonable that more 
than 80^ should have to leave the high school before 
graduating. The fact that only 4.7^ of the students, 
and only 17.3% of the ”B" students, in contrast to 45.6% 
of the ”A" students, receive high school diplomas shows the 
one-sidedness of the Alberta High School tendencies and 
the general inability of the two-room high school to cope 
with the problem. It is quite evident that the two-room 





high school is not designed to be of equal service to all 
students, in that it operates to the disadvantage of the 
less capable, or less brilliant students. The three-year 
high school programme is not sufficiently long to allow 
for planning programmes in two-room high schools so as to 
recognize the needs of a variety of students at one and 
the same time. It is a fact that the wants of the weaker 
student are frequently set aside in order that the pro¬ 
gramme of the small high school may suit the majority of 
more capable students. Discouraged, the weaker students 
discontinue high school in great numbers at the end of the 
first and second years. A four-year programme arranged to 
fulfil the needs of all classes of students, a programme 
based on a civic curriculum rather than an academic 
curriculum, a programme which includes a greater variety 
of subjects related to the immediate daily lives and 
interests of the student, would serve a more worthy 
purpose than one which discourages the majority of lower- 
classified students before they enter the third year of 
high school. 

The following charts or histograms reveal that in 
a four-year high school programme the best interests of 
all students are apparently served. The charts are drawn 
to represent the groupings of students over a three-year 
period as well as over a four-or-more-year period, in 
relation to the number of credits which they earned in 
that time. Students from outside points commencing at

the G-rade XI or G-rade XII levels have not been included. 
The total who enrolled in G-rade X in any one of the 
follovdng years: 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940, is included 
in each group, so that each histogram includes students 
who stopped at the end of the first year of high school, 
at the end of the second year of high school, etc. The 
table at the top of each histogram represents the number 
of students who have left high school at the different 
levels, plus, in some cases, those students who might 
still be at school. It does not include those who have 
graduated. For comparative purposes the two types of 
high school have been differentiated. 

The best estimate of each group is obtained from 
the histogram representing the records of students who 
have been in attendance throughout a period of four or 
more years as the best grouping is obtained over the 
longer period of time. The charts req.uire no further 
clarification or description — they speak for themselves. 

Finally, two histograms have been prepared to show 
the grouping of 1,642 students in attendance at two-room 
high schools who enrolled and remained in regular atten¬ 
dance at the fifty schools beginning in the following 
years: 1937, 1938, 1939. The records of students 
enrolling in these years were selected because each of 
the students might, if he so desired, have remained in

high school for at least four years. The histogram 
representing a four-year attendance shows a much better 
distribution of students than does the histogram rep¬ 
resenting students in attendance but three years. It 
shows for example, that 598 students over a four-year 
period were successful in obtaining 100 or more credits, 
whereas over a three-year period only 164 students 
were successful in obtaining 100 credits or more. These 
two charts are important for comparative purposes.

Conclusions 


1. Tables VI, VII, and VIII reveal that at best neither 
type of two-room high school had more than 30^ of its 
graduates secure a diploma in three' years, the majority 
of this group being students. This means, virtually, 
that in the schools with the best average not more than 
three out of every ten graduates receive a high school 
diploma after three years’ attendance. Table VIII 
shows that only 21.3/^ of 792 graduates were able to 
qualify for the high school diploma in three years. 

When the 1940 entrants who completed the requirements 
for the diploma are included, then 221 out of 844 
graduates, or 26.2^ obtained the diploma in three years. 

The mean number of credits secured by all classes 
of students who ceased attending high school at the 
end of Crade X was 24.87, and at the end of two years 
53.53. For those who had been in attendance three 
years before stopping, the mean number of credits 
secured by all classes of students was 87.55, while 
those in attendance four years or more had a mean 
average of 102.67 credits. Since the average achieve¬ 
ment in four years is but 2.67 credits more than is 
required for a diploma, it is useless to expect the 
average student in the two-room high school to adhere 
to a three-year programme. The three-year high school 
programme apparently exists in name only. What actually

ir ^ ■

r 
















happens in the two-room high school is that the over¬ 
whelming majority of students requires four years to 
obtain the high school diploma. 

Tables XVI.XXVII show conclusively that 

the three classes of students differ widely in the 
mean number of credits secured during the respective 
periods of attendance. The mean number of credits 
earned by even the most capable students who attended 
for one year only shows no ability to graduate from 
two-room high schools within a three-year period; the 
mean number of credits earned by students of varying 
abilities over a two-year period gives no indication 
that a diploma could be earned in one additional year; 
similarly the mean number of credits received by 
students of any class over a three-year period is 
considerably lower than 100. Only over the four- 
year period do at least two classes of students 
and "B”) prove the ability of the average student to 
earn 100 credits or more. The four-year programme 
would appear to be the minimum length of time in which 
the majority of students could graduate from two-room 
high schools. 

Additional charts at the end of the chapter show 
that the best groupings of credits are obtained when 
students attend two-room high schools for at least 
four years. Many more students receive 100 or more 











credits over a four-year period than over a three-year 
period. 

It would appear much more practical, at least from 
the point of view of the two-room high school, to 
replace the three-year high school prograijme in Alberta 
by a four-year programme. If this plan were adopted, 
more students with varying abilities could graduate in 
the same length of time; it would then be possible to 
offer a more varied programme in the two-room high school 
so that the weaker student might be accommodated as well 
as the superior type of student; it would enable the 
more capable student to enlarge his programme to 
include additional subjects or courses so that upon 
graduation he would have a more varied background and 
a larger number of subjects to his credit than the bare 
minimum of 100 - 105 credits which he may at present 
attempt to obtain, at the expense of the weaker student, 
in three years. 

2. The two-room high school is not a just institution in 
that all students who have the right to pursue high 
school training are not given the same educational 
opportunity. No further proof of this statement is 
necessary than to point out that 81.6^ of the 
students and 69.5^ of the students arrest their 

education before graduating, while only 46.5^ of the 

students do so. The main reason for this condition 
is that the more capable student is the darling of the 









two-room high school, largely because his group 
happens to be in the majority. The academic subjects 
are still the most popular in the high school programme, 
but they are perhaps the least useful to most and 
many students especially if standing is necessary 
as a prerequisite to the next unit in the subject. 

The addition of a fourth year to the high school 
programme would make possible a better time distribution 
for the teaching of subject matters as well as the 
offering of a greater choice of subjects more closely 
related to the needs, interests, and capacities of all 
three classes of students. 

3. The number of credits necessary to attain the high school 
diploma at the same time should not exceed 100. 

Tables XVT .....XXVII indicate that only and 

”B" students earn a mean number of credits in excess 
of 100 over a four-year period. It is reasonable to 
assume that the student, given a more favorable 
introduction to the high school, and with a greater 
variety of subjects within his intellectual grasp 
offered him, will make a far more favorable showing in 
four years than the records in the above tables show. 












CHAPTER IV 


PROGRAl^IES OF STUDY IN T;yO-ROOM HIGH SCHOOLS 

As previously indicated, tlie Alberta High sciiool 
programme is still predominantly academic in nature, even 
thougb many general electives are theoretically available 
to high school students in attendance at these schools. 

Two subjects, English and Social Studies, represent ’Core’ 
subjects in the Alberta Curriculum, for they are compulsory 
subjects throughout the three years of the programme. All 
students, regardless of ability, and regardless of Grade IX 
classification, must qualify in three units of each 
compulsory subject before they may graduate. In the past, 
it has been possible to ’stagger’ or alternate the core 
subjects in the small high school so that each of these 
subjects need not necessarily be offered every year. 

Table XXXI indicates that English 1 was offered in the 
fifty two-room high schools over a four-year period^ 

196 out of a possible 200 times. Social Studies 1 was 
offered 195 times, and Health and Physical Education, a 
compulsory subject for Grade X students only, was offered 
153 times over the same number of years.^ 


^ Subjects for Westlock 1939-1940 not available. 

^ The high school programmes were studied for the years 
1939, 1940, 1941, and 1942 because the present programme 
was offered in its entirety during these years only. 






a 






From Table TjZl we may learn tliat the academic 
electives, Algebra 1 and G-eometry 1, were offered lOE and 
103 times respectively over the four-year period, again out 
of a possible 200. This seems strange in view of the fact 
that the departmental ’Regulations^ stipulate Algebra 1 and 
Geometry 1 in small high schools should be offered in 
alternate years, whereas these tv/o subjects were offered 
a total of 205 times, indicating that in one or more 
schools both subjects were offered during the same year. 

Of the remaining academic electives, Chemistry 1 and 
French 1 were offered more than 100 times during the same 
period, while Physics 1 was offered 99 times. This 
emphasis on the academic electives proves simply that the 
programme in small schools is academic in practice as 
well as in theory. Information presented in Table XXSII 
supports this contention. The record cards of 94 graduates 
from two-room high schools in 1942 show that 96.81/^ of them 
elected Algebra 1, an equal number elected Geometry 1. 

95.74/^ elected Physics 1, 91.49^ Chemistry 1, and 85.11^ 
French 1. Relatively the same proportions held in the 
records of 543 students graduating from other schools in 
the same year.^ It appears evident that as long as academic 
electives are offered in any high school, students will 
select them in preference to many general electives. 


A sampling was made of the cards of 637 student-graduates 
in the year 1942. Of this number 94 were graduates from 
two-room high schools, 543 were graduates from other 
schools in the province.

V. 


) ..r 
















The number of times the different general electives 
of the first year of high school were offered in the fifty 
two-room high schools may also be derived from Table XXXI. 
Biology 1 was offered 108 times out of a possible 200. It 
was selected by 84.04% of the 94 students whose cards were 
studied. G-eneral Mathematics 1 was taught 97 times and 
was studied by only 6.38% of the 94 students. What the 
94 graduates from two-room high schools chose in the 
way of subjects for credits is not unrelated to what the 
543 graduates from other schools chose. The study reveals 
that the academic electives are m^ost popular among high 
school students, but it also reveals that general electives 
are desired by some students. 

The same situation prevails with respect to subjects 
at the second-year level. French 2 predominates as first 
choice in the academic electives. Table XXXIY shows that 
75.53% of the 94 students under review elected French 2. 

It is of further interest to note that of the 844 graduates 
from two-room high schools during the years 1940, 1941, 

1942, and 1943, 526 students, or 62.5% of the total 
number of graduates, studied some French. (Table XXXVII). 
One hundred and four graduates, or 12.3% of the total 
studied some Latin, while 203 students, or 24.1% of the 
total, elected to earn credits in both Latin and French. 

It is remarkable that, of the 844 graduates, only 11, or 
1.3% of the total, graduated without having studied any 
language. The number of times second-year general electives

were offered was exceedingly small. Only Sociology and 
Psychology^ were offered more than once in any school over 
the four-year period. G-eneral Mathematics 2 was offered 
but 8 times in the fifty high schools over the four-year 
period, and G-eneral Science 2 was offered but once. In 
the 94 cards selected at random there was not a single 
instance where the student selected either of these 
subjects for credits. Only 2.76^ of the 543 graduates 
from other schools had secured credits in G-eneral Math¬ 
ematics 2; only 1,29?J of the 543 graduates had credits 
in G-eneral Science 2. Of the 18 ^0’^ students who graduated 
from the fifty tv/o-room high schools, only one student had 
q.ualified for his diploma without suffering the loss of 
credits in General Mathematics 1. 

The emphasis on academic electives is even more 
striking at the Grade XII level. Algebra 2 was offered 
in the fifty schools 143 times over the four-year period. 
This subject presented for credit by 55.32?^ of those 
graduating from two-room high schools, and by 68.145^ of 
the 543 graduating students from all other high schools. 
Chemistry 2 was offered 137 times and was studied by 
67.02^ of the graduates from two-room high schools, and 
by 68.14^ of the 543 graduates from all other high schools. 
French 3 ranked fifth in the number of times offered in 
two-room high schools over a four-year period, being 
superceded in this by Algebra 2, Chemistry 2, Trigonometry 


^ Sociology and Psychology was offered as one subject in 1939

and Analytical Geometry, and Physics 2. Latin 3 was offered 
but 20 times in the fifty high schools over the four-year 
period. Only 9.57^ of the 94 graduates from two-room high 
schools had presented credits in Latin 3, as compared with 
15,65^ of the graduates from the larger sampling. 

The teaching of general electives at the Grade XII 
level is in marked contrast with the above. Economics was 
offered 46 times in the fifty two-room high schools and 
was presented for credit by 21.28^ of the 94 graduating 
students, and by 19.15^ of the 543 graduating students from 
other high schools. Cadet Training, because of war 
influence, is being offered at two-room high schools in 
increasing nuiabers each year. 

One apparent conclusion is that students, especially 
those in attendance at two-room high schools, elect to 
study general electives somewhat in proportion to the number 
of times each is offered on the high school programme. It 
is safe to predict that if Typev/riting la, General Shop 1, 
and Home Economics 1, could be offered in the programme of 
the two-room high school each year, a greater proportion of 
students would graduate having credits in these courses, 
than there would be students graduating with credits in 
academic electives. It would not be presumptuous to add 
that this view is supported by the fact that during the 
1942-1943 final examinations more students wrote on 
Trigonometry and Analytical Geometry in one of the fifty 
high schools under study, than wrote on the same subject-

in a five-room city high school in the Province of Alberta. 

As Typewriting la, General Shop, and Home Economics- 
are probably the most popular and at the same time most 
useful general electives in the Alberta high school 
programme at the present time, it is proposed to summarize 
briefly the comments made by principals of two-room high 
schools in which these courses were offered: 

Typewriting la :- 

In Twenty-six of the fifty two-room high schools 
under survey Typewriting la was offered to classes during 
the school year 1942-1943. Twenty-two replies were 
received from the twenty-six principals. 

The first general impression is that the accom¬ 
modation for offering this general elective is, on the 
whole, very inadequate. The following table represents 
the situation:

rooms’ to the ordinary classroom. Equipment also varied, 
as the following table well shows:

In three of the high schools, students supplied their 
own machines, a very unacceptable procedure because, for 
the most part, borrowed portable typewriters were used, 
rather than standard machines. In the remaining nineteen 
schools the number of machines provided for student use 
varied from 3 to 17, the average number being 9.6 machines. 
The average cost to furnish machines, equipment, and 
accommodation (five schools) was #59.93 per machine. The 
cost of equipment, once the machines and the room have 
been obtained, is almost negligible. 

The departmental ’Regulations’ state clearly that 
one machine must be provided for each student. Teachers, 
in an effort to accommodate students who desire to take 
the course, double the number of periods in which Type¬ 
writing may be offered. In many of the schools Typev\n[‘iting 
was offered as a G-rade IX option, thus reducing the time 
which may be devoted to high school students in this 
subject, and aggravating the accommodation problem. 

The popularity of Typewriting as a school subject 
may be seen in the fact that teachers are willing to give 
instruction in this course, and students are willing to 
take the course, despite the crowded and somewhat adverse 
conditions under which it is offered. One teacher commented 
that students found it necessary to sit on books in order 
to have the machine at the correct level; another stated 
that the typewriting room was too cold for use during 
winter months, so that an ordinary classroom had to be used. 










The additional fact that students are willing to furnish 
their own machines in order that they might take the course 
is evidence of the growing popularity of this optional 
subject. 

Among the values of Typewriting suggested by 
teachers are the following: 

1. Typewriting is a skill. For this reason progress is 
easily discernible and interest is, therefore, easily 
maintained. Students like to work with a machine; 
learning to manipulate it involves activity. For this 
reason Typewiting may be classed as a subject related 
to the ideals of progressive education. 

2. Adolescent students learn to co-ordinate kinaesthetic 
muscles. Proper finger manipulation provides excellent 
exercise to this end. 

3. Typewriting provides training in habits of neatness, 
care, and precision. 

4. Students who have been introduced to Typewriting in 
the intermediate grades and who continue the skill in 
high school become proficient in Typewriting. In 
offering such training the school can equip the student 
with a skill for personal and vocational use. Type¬ 
writing may be of even greater value to the non-graduat¬ 
ing student than to the graduating student in that the 
former in many cases uses it to more immediate advantage.

5. Many students make use of training in typewriting to 
make stencils for the production of school papers, 
charts, and outlines. Notes are also typewritten, 
thus adding to the student’s experience, neatness, 
and interest. 

6. Students gain a knowledge of the machine and of its 
proper care and function. 

The general interest manifested by students in 
Typewriting indicates the possibility of decreasing ad¬ 
herence to the academic subjects, proYided that courses 
more closely related to the immediate needs, interests 
and capacities of students are made available in the 
high school programme. Although the initial cost of 
providing machines and equipment is somewhat high, the 
importance of this skill in later life, especially in the 
field of business, almost makes it necessary to include 
Typewriting in the high school programme. If the cost of 
providing equipment and accommodation is spread over a 
number of years, the burden is not excessive. 

G-eneral Shoi3 :° 

Fifteen teachers submitted reports on the general 
set-up pertaining to instruction in General Shop. This 
course, when offered, is exceptionally popular, not only 
among boys, but among girls as well.

Unlike Typewriting, Ueneral Shop may be offered in 
two ways: by a teacher on the regular staff, or by a 
travelling or circuit teacher. As the employment of a 
travelling teacher does not complicate the organization of 
the school to the same extent as the employment of a 
member of the regular staff, the number of circuit arrange¬ 
ments is on the increase. Another advantage of the circuit 
is that, in these days of teacher-shortage, one qualified 
teacher may serve two, three, four, or five centers.

The matter of accommodation is a trying problem for 

teachers of General Shop in two-room high school centers. 

Rooms not only vary in size, but they also vary in other 

ways; 

Variation in Accommodation 
Rooms in Yard and Basement 

Apart from School Room Classroom Room Down Town 
5 7 12 

The basement room for Shop purposes is quite 
popular providing the size of the room is adequate. The 
room down town is condemned by principals. The distance 
from school as well as the problem, of discipline detracts 
from the usefulness of such a room. 



















The cost of equipment for a class of approximately 
15 pupils is not excessive. The minimum cost of equipment 
as stated by one principal was $225.00; the maximum cost 
as stated by another principal was $1400.00; the average 
cost of equipment for eleven schools was $517.82. However, 
the expenditures vary from school to school, depending to 
a great extent on the number of students enrolled, the 
nature of the courses offered, and the quality of tools 
furnished. Equipment in the school with an estimated 
total cost of $1400.00 included Delata power tools made 
up of a jig“Saw, press-drill, grinder, lathe, etc., costing 
approximately $1,000.00 in all, with hand tools to a total 
cost of $400.00. In the shop room equipped with $225.00 
worth of tools were tables, benches, hand tools, and one 
or two power tools. 

Equipment varies with the type of instruction 
offered to the student. Woodwork seems to be most popular, 
followed by work in metals, leather, automotives, concrete 
and plaster, reed work, drafting, carving, and painting. 

Eor woodwork, hand tools, the jig-saw, a power grinder, a 
lathe, a press drill, a band saw, a planer, and a motor 
seem to be essential. Machines necessary for additional 
training include an automobile, cabinets, cupboards, 
circular sav/s, sander, jointer, metal and electrical 
appliances.

Factors which make General Shop a popular high school 

course are: 

1. Working with tools satisfies the urge to make something 
and at the same time enables the student to continue 
gratifying this urge later in life. A boy has the 
natural instinct to create, to make something with his 
own hands. The General Shop course immediately appeals 
to this instinct. At the same time the boy, or girl, 
learns to manipulate tools and gains an insight into 
the life and work of the skilled craftsman. As a 
result, be or she will have a keener appreciation of 
the skill required and the effort demanded in this 
field of labour. 

2. General Shop can be integrated in a practical way with 
many school subjects. There is opportunity for 
correlation with art, mathematics, language and 
spelling, and economics. 

3. Many teachers make no claim for General Shop as an 
exploratory course. Others maintain that General Shop 
may assist non-graduate students to find their place 
in life. Definite and specific examples were given in 
which both boys and girls were offered lucrative positions 
by National Selective Service Offices because of 
familiarity mth tools and because of Shop experience. 

For many students. General Shop is an introduction to 
economic interest in life.

4. The pursuit of woodwork as the first step in Shop work 
encourages many students to adopt working with tools 
or with wood as a hobby in later life. Teachers who 
would not admit that G-eneral Shop is an exploratory 
course admitted the value of woodwork for occupying 
leisure time. 

5. G-eneral Shop familiarizes the student with the working 
tools of various skilled craftsmen. 

6. General Shop has desirable objectives, such as the 

seven cardinal aims of the National Education Association: 

a. Health and Safety 

b. Worthy Home Membership 

c. Mastery of Tools 

d. Vocational and Economic Effectiveness 

e. Faithful Citizenship 

f. Techniques and Spirit of Learning 

g. Wise Use of Leisure and Ethical Character 

7. General Shop teaches skill, care, patience, accuracy, 
the ability to think for oneself, manipulation, 
persistence, neatness and orderliness. 

8. General Shop offers an opportunity for adult education. 

In many communities adults make use of the facilities 
found in the school. The assembly nail, the classroom, 
the Home Economics room, and the General Shop offer 
excellent opportunities for furthering adult education. 

General Shop should be taught in every two-room 
high school, not because of any claim which it may make 
upon vocational training, but for the excellence of its 
educational possibilities. At least two years’ experience 
in General Shop ought to be made available to each high 
school boy.

Home Economics 


Principals from twelve schools replied to the 
questionnaire on Home Economics. Considering the fact 
that Home Economics was taught during the school year 
1942-1943 in only twelve schools, the returns were excellent. 

The general complaint from principals again concerned 
accommodation. While some teachers expressed satisfaction, 
others were extremely critical. Following are the details: 

Home Economics Taught in : 

Classroom Basement Room Room Down Town > Two Rooms Total 
3 3 4 2 12 

Vv^ith four exceptions, the accommodation might be 
considered good. For the most part, teachers were able to 
improve the room by adding paint, linoleum, and plenty of 
light. In a few instances in which movable partitions 
were provided, one room could be divided to represent the 
four rooms of a small house: kitchen, dining room, bed room, 
and laundry. Other rooms which could be improvised were: 
sewing room, living room, and library. In two centers the 
school board had provided more than the minimum space of 
one room. 

In one center the Home Economics class met for some 
time on the sx,age of the assembly hall. Later it was - 
removed to a vacant house in the community. In another 
community where the people had not yet become "Home- 
Economic s-minded^^ the class was housed in the worst 
building in the district. In two other centers

accommodation was obtained in down town buildings. It is 
generally conceded, however, that where Home Economics is 
taught for one or more years in any center, conditions 
improved wonderfully, not only in the matter of accommodation, 
but by the addition of improved equipment, development of 
community interest, etc. 

The best type of service offered in Home Economics 
seems to be in centers where a travelling teacher is 
employed, or where it is possible to secure the services 
of an additional staff member. Disruption to class 
procedure and school organization is minimized where this 
policy is adopted. In the twelve two^room high schools 
from which this summary was derived the procedures adopted 
were;

Travelling or Teacher a Member

In almost each case the Home Economics teacher 
travelled with the G-eneral Shop teacher from school to 
school, remaining one day or more in each center. The 
cost of travel, in addition to the salary of each teacher, 
was borne proportionately by school boards in relation to 
the time spent by the teachers in each school. 

The amount and cost of equipment for Home Economics 
varied from school to school because of the type of 
instruction provided and because of variation in accom¬ 
modation and equipment. The minimum cost of equipping a

room, exclusive of improvements to building or room and 
exclusive of salaries was $216.50. The maximum cost was 
$796.50. The average cost determined for five centers 
was $492.60. The amount of equipment should be sufficient 
to furnish at least three rooms, the size of a small house. 
Standard equipment provided, however, included: a kitchen 
stove, dishes and cooking utensils sufficient for a class 
of 12 or 15, one or two sewing machines, cupboards, tables, 
a bed, a dresser, chairs, laundry equipment, irons, an 
ironing board, and miscellaneous items. Two school boards 
have included an electric refrigerator, electric stove, 
electric sewing machine, and a Mixmaster. While the 
latter articles are not necessarily essential, they do 
assist materially in developing a modern atmosphere for 
Home Economics. 

The general opinion of the principals seems to be 
that boys should not be permitted to take part in the 
Home Economics class to the same extent that girls may 
take part in the General Shop classes, mainly because 
their presence is embarrassing during dress-fitting and 
the fashion show. 

Among the reasons stated by principals for including 
Home Economics in the programmes of small high schools were 
1. Teachers make the claim that Home Economics is a good 
exploratory course. It has great practical value in 
preparing girls for happier and more efficient home 



lives, or for further study of Household Economics at 
university. It has further practical value in that 
students are taught to buy correctly, as they are given 
responsibility in marketing for the class. 

£. Home Economics is a pleasant and useful school subject. 
Proper instruction enables the girl to learn food 
values and correct serving techniques. In itself a 
departure from routine academic subjects, permits 
relaxation and variety through freedom of movement 
and comparative independence. 

3. Home Economics increases social consciousness by 
developing ease in meeting people and in co-operating 
with them. 

4. Knowledge of dressmaking involves increased knowledge 
of handiv/ork. The fashion show teaches students to 
walk gracefully, to have correct carriage, and to 
select clothes correctly. 

5. Home Economics may be successfully correlated with a 
number of school subjects, particularly art, language, 
chemistry, economics, and mathematics. 

6. Home Economics teaches good principles of laundering, 
housekeeping, home nursing, interior decorating, 
personal grooming, sewing, cooking, menu planning, 
and nutrition. 

7. By-products of the cooking and sewing class can be 
contributed worthily to the Red Cross when the 
proceeds from the sale of home cooking and home-made 








clothing are turned over to this organization. 

Home Economics is a popular course among girls. 

The practical value of the subject, as well as its 
relationship to Chemistry and other school subjects 
v/arrants the placing of Home Economics near the top of 
the list of school subjects offered in the small high 
school. 

Conclusions 

1. There is no doubt but that undue emphasis has hitherto 
been placed on the academic part of the Alberta Cur¬ 
riculum, especially in the two-room high school. The 
emphasis is so great that wealcer students, because of 
low native ability, poor habits of study, and general 
scholastic maladjustment, are not able to keep pace 
with more capable classmates. Because of this general 
inability to comprehend the academic subjects and to 
advance satisfactorily in them, they become discouraged 
in the early stages of high school and discontinue 
attendance at school. By the end of the second year, 
or in any event by the end of the third year of high 
school, the majority of such students have quit the 
high school altogether. 

V/hy is it that, while only 10.1^ of the 844 graduates 
from two-room high schools proceed to university, the 
curriculum is built around university requirements? 

Why is it that the weaker student who knows he will

never attend university selects a programme in tlie 
high school which is largely based on university 
matriculation requirements? The answer lies in a 
number of factors for virhich the Department of Education 
is not entirely to blame. True enough, the Department 
tolerates the situation, and officials and educationists 
who realize what is going on have done very little 
about it. The blame, however, rests heavily on the 
students, parents, and teachers. The public (not 
forgetting that the attitude of students reflects 
public opinion) is of the opinion that anything worthy 
of the name education is related traditionally to 
college preparation. For this reason, and partially 
because public sentiment demands that academic courses 
be taught in the school, students expect, and usually 
find, a programme of subjects which follows, to a large 
extent, university requirements. The less academically 
inclined student, feeling that he is out of the 
general trend unless he falls in line, readily attempts 
to assimmlate the content of subjects academic in 
nature. The public has not yet been led to appreciate 
that such educational opportunities should be offered 
by public secondary schools as will adequately prepare 
boys and girls for happy and useful lives in the 
changing world of today.

■S \ ■/ 











2. Another reason for predominant emphasis upon academic 
subjects rests with the teacher. Teachers, for the 
most part, like to please the public. Trained in 
academic subjects themselves, it is very difficult for 
the majority of teachers to believe that education 
includes anything apart from that which is academic. 

A major consideration at the present time is that many 
ofthe academic electives now require special qualifications 
of teachers before instruction may be given. For the 
most part, teachers have not all the special qual- 
ifioations required in the small two-room high school. 

If they have not, it is possible to qualify only after 
many additional years are spent in preparation for this 
v/ork. Most teachers with special qualifications are in 
great demand in the larger high schools, with the result 
that the boards operating smaller high schools are 
finding it increasingly difficult to secure properly 
qualified teachers for particular and special work. 

It might be held, however, that when salaries increase 
t o the point where teachers can afford to train 
themselves for special work, properly qualified 
teachers will be available. 

3. The cost of providing equipment so that the more 
popular of the general electives may be offered in 
two-room high schools is another argument in favor of 
the less expensive academic institution. The problem 
of providing suitable accommodation is also a matter of 







•/ ■ 


grave concern to the average school board. If 
Typewriting la, Home Economics, and General Shop are 
added to the number of subjects offered in a two-room 
high school, the initial cost of equipment would be 
approximately |l,000.00 - $2,000.00. In addition to 
the equipment, three additional rooms must be provided, 
one for each subject. Raising the required amount of 
money to introduce these subjects is not a simple 
matter. Before all school boards can be persuaded to 
add these courses to the regular academic programme, 
it is necessary to, convince the public in general that 
these courses have a worthy contribution to make to the 
educational development of the student. The public 
needs further to be convinced that the question of 
expense is of secondary rather than of primary 
importance, when the proper mental growth and develop¬ 
ment of the individual child is at stake. 

The survey of the programmes of schools in which these 
subjects are taught indicates the wholesome value of 
these courses, particularly to the less academically 
inclined student. The adverse conditions under which 
they are being offered in many of the schools is suf¬ 
ficient indication that a high school building programme 
and a high school planning programme in the Province of 
Alberta is long overdue. It is to be hoped that many 
communities will recognize the need for providing proper 
high school facilities, if not before the successful 

conclusion of this war, then immediately afterward as 
a post-war measure.

CHAPTER Y 


THE EXTENT TO TOIGH THE T\70-R00M HIGH 
SCHOOL SERVES THE NEEDS OF T'HE GOMOTITY 

There are two definite, and in some respects unrelated, 
ways of evaluating school service. In the first place the 
practical person would wish to know in what manner the two- 
room high school serves as a community center, not only as 
a social institution, hut as an institution which might he 
used for the purpose of adult education. The present study 
is not particularly concerned with answering this query, 
although its importance is not underestimated. 

In the second place the practical person would ask 
just how well the two-room high school serves as training 
for all students in the community who register at the 
Grade X level. This question has already been partially 
answered insofar as the needs of the weaker students are 
concerned. It has been definitely established that the 
two-room high school caters to the more capable student to 
a far greater extent than to the less capable student. 

How well the two-room high school meets the needs of 
graduate students remains to be seen, and to what extent 
its programme suffices for students in attendance but one 
year, but two years, and but three years, also remains to 
be seen. How well the two-room high school serves the 
needs of the community at large will also be reviewed. 

In this study the graduates from the two different 
types of high school will be considered separately.

) 








Those students who have graduated from the two-room high 
school and who came in at the Grade XI and Grade XII levels 
will also be considered. 

Table XXXVIII indicated what 288 graduates from 
twenty-five two-room high schools did"immediately after 
leaving high school. ( Grades IX - XII), The greatest 
number of students in any one group entered Normal School. 
This group represents more than one-quarter of the total 
number of graduates. Approximately one-fifth of the 
students joined the armed services immediately after 
graduating. Only 26 students, or 9.0fo of the total number 
of graduates went to university. If Normal Entrance, 
University Entrance, and Nursing may be considered as 
fields of service requiring an academic type of education, 
then 131 out of the 288 graduates, or 45.5^ of the 
graduates from these institutions have been adequately 
prepared in the two-room high schools. Although no 
student graduates proceeded to train as nurses, or entered 
university, two of them went to Normal School. It might be 
said that this type of high school has adequately prepared 
45.5^ of its graduates for post-school life in academic 
pursuits. However, the 131 graduates thus represented form 
only 12,4^ of the original number of students who entered 
at the Grade X level. It might be said, therefore, that 
the twenty-five two-room high schools have adequately 
served approximately one-tenth of the students registered.

Table XIXIX tells much the same story about graduates 
from two-room high schools who came in at the Grade XI and 
Grade XII levels. Forty-nine of the 89 graduates attended 
university, Normal School, or began hospital training. This 
represents 55.1/4 of the total number of graduates or 34.5% 
of the original group of students who came from outside 
points to complete their high school education in the twenty- 
five two-room high schools. Thus the two-room high school 
appears to serve better as a finishing school for outside 
students than for the students who are in regular attendance. 

Table XL indicates what graduate students from two- 
room high schools, Grades X ~ XII, did after leaving high 
school. Almost one-third of these students entered Normal 
School, less than one-tenth went to university, and approx¬ 
imately one-tenth trained as nurses after graduation. 
Forty-one students, or 11.9% who remained at home, married, 
or worked on the farm made no apparent use of their academic 
high school training. Of the 343 graduates, 156, or 45.5% 
of the total number, apparently made good use of their 
academic training by attending Normal School, university, 
or by training to be nurses. This number represents but 
13.9% of the original group of 1,126 students who entered 
these schools at the Grade X level. This would indicate 
that the academi'c programmes of the twenty-five two-room 
high schools have suited the later requirements of 
approximately 13.9% of all registered students.

Table XLI reveals what 124 graduate students did who 
came to the twenty-five two-room high schools at the G-rade XI 
or G-rade XII levels. Seventy students from this class 
attended Normal School, university, or took hospital training. 
This represents 56.5% of the graduates, or 18.1% of the 387 
students who came in from outside points to complete their 
high school training. Once again it is apparent that the 
two-room high school serves the purposes of students from 
outside points to better advantage than those of students 
in regular attendance. 

Table XLI(a) is a composite compilation showing the 
various interests of the 844 graduates from the fifty two- 
room high schools over a four-year period. More than one- 
quarter of the total number of graduates went directly to 
Normal School after graduating. The greater number of these 
students were from the and categories, although 
16.7% of the ^’G” graduates also proceeded to Normal School. 
More than one-tenth of the graduates, or 13.1% of the total 
number to be exact, joined the armed forces immediately after 
graduation.^ Only 10.1% attended university, while 9.7% 
trained to'become nurses. A very small group of 62 graduates, 
representing 7.3% of the total number of graduates, took up 
odd jobs such as telephone work, telegraph work, dairy work, 
selective service work, war work, etc. Four hundred and one 


^This study is naturally somewhat out of proportion because of 
the influence of war. A similar study made under the same 
conditions in peace timg^^^ould be greatly altered because of 
the distribution of tiie^students among the various classified 
groups in Table XLI.

Number of Graduates 




































graduates, or 47.5^ of the total number went either to 
Normal School, university, or in training to be nurses. 

This means, then, on the surface, that approximately one- 
half of the graduates made good use of the academic training 
which they received at high school. This represents only 
14.25^ of the original group of 2,828 students who commenced 
high school training, however, so that one can say with 
some assurance that the two-room high school satisfies 
abundantly the needs of less than one-sixth of all students 
who attend. The chart accompanying Table XLI illustrates 
in color the various occupational choices which students 
made after graduating from high school. One cannot but be 
impressed with the idea that more than one of every four 
graduates from the fifty high schools over a four-year 
period went to Normal School and followed teaching as a 
profession. 

Eqiually striking is the contribution made by students 
to the war effort. Table XLII shows what many of the 
students did subsequent to courses taken immediately after 
graduation. Seventy-two students or 8.5% of the original 
group.of graduates left their employment and joined the 
armed forces. A total of 183 graduate students, or 21.7% 
of the original number of graduates are now in the armed 
forces. (November 31, 1943) Of this number 28, or 15.3% 
are girls, and 155, or 84.7% are boys. Twenty-eight, or 
3.3% of the total number of graduates became married or 
left the work which they had followed immediately after 
graduation.

It is quite apparent tiiat the programme in the two- 
room high school does not meet the needs of boys to the 
same extent as it meets the needs of girls. Of the 2,828 
students in attendance at any time in the fifty schools, 

1,289 or 45.6?^ were boys. Yet despite the fact that almost 
one-half of the original registrants were boys, only 284 
out of (Table XLIII) 844 graduating students, or 33.6^ of 
the total number of graduates were boys. 

In an attempt to determine whether or not attendance 
of any length of time at two-room high schools had any 
effect in fulfilling the needs of students, a deliberate 
and careful study was made of the post-school work of all 
students in attendance at ten two-room high schools.^ 
Particular attention was given to those students who did 
not graduate. Once again this study is colored or influenced 
by war conditions. 

Many students in attendance but one year (Table XLIY) 
remained at .home after the term was over. Tv/enty-four of 
a group of 68, almost one-third of those v^ho stopped at 
the end of one year in high school, remained at home, 
became married, or worked on farms. Nineteen joined the 
armed services, and nineteen obtained odd jobs. The one 
year of attendance at high school had little effect on the 
choice of occupation by these students after leaving high 
school.

^ High Schools including Grades IX to XII. 










































Of 117 students whose cards indicated that they were 
in attendance but two years, 39 joined the armed services, 

334 accepted odd jobs, S7 remained at home, two studied 
nursing, two went into the bank, and two left no record. 

There is some indication, at least in the case of four 
students, that two years of high schooling had some effect 
on the nature of the work taken up after leaving high 
school. 

Of 249 non“graduate students in attendance for at 
least three years, 67 joined the armed services, 54 were 
placed in odd jobs, 44 remained at home, 30 took business 
training, 34 are still at school, 8 entered banks, 5 took 
up nursing, and 7 left no record. Approximately the same 
proportion of students joined the armed services, regardless 
of whether they had been at high school one, two, or three 
years. It would appear from the table that the longer a 
student remains at school the less likelihood there is that 
he will remain at home or will accept odd jobs after leaving 
school. It follows also that the longer a student remains 
at school the greater is the possibility he will take up a 
business course, or work demanding special aptitude, for 
example, banking or nursing. 

One might assume, therefore, that lengthier atten- 
dance in high school enhances the opportunities of obtaining 
preferential positions, i.e., the longer students remain in 
attendance at two-room high schools, the better the positions 
they will be able to command after leaving high school.

The two-room high school, therefore, meets in part the 
requirements of many students providing they can or will 
remain in the high school sufficiently long to benefit 
from the training. 

Students who graduated from the ten selected two- 
room high schools and who had commenced high school training 
during the years 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940, occupied them¬ 
selves after leaving high school in much the same way as 
indicated in the table pertaining to 844 graduates from the 
fifty two-room high schools. The total number of graduates 
over the four-year period from the ten high schools was 225. 
(Table TLY), Of this number 62, or 27.6$^ entered Normal 
School, 37 or 16.4?^ attended university, 35 or 15,6^ 
enlisted in the armed forces, 25 or 11.1^ remained at home 
or were married, 18 or 8.0% accepted various positions, 

16 or 7.1% began hospital training, and-the same number 
enrolled at business college. Nine graduates were employed 
by banks, three went into business, three are still at 
school and the remaining students could not be traced. 
Fifty-six of the students had graduated in three years, 
i.e., 24.9% of the total number of graduates. Of this 
number thirty-two, or 57.2%, proceeded to Normal School, 
to university, or into training as nurses. Eighty-three 
of the graduates who had attended four years before 
obtaining a diploma went to university, to Normal School, 
or into training as nurses. This represents but 49.1% 
of that class. Of the total number of 225 graduates, 115,

or 51.1^ of the total number went to university, to Normal 
School, or into hospital training. The histogram accompany¬ 
ing Table XLV illustrates pictorially the occupations of 
students immediately after graduating. 

Only 33.4^ of the 674 originally registered in the 
ten high schools wers* successful in obtaining a diploma. 

This representation is a little higher than that for the 
fifty high schools, where only 29,8% of the 2828 students 
in attendance were able to obtain a high school diploma 
over the sairxe period of time. {Table XLVI). Once again 
the greatest percentage of any class of students to out 
short high school training v/ithout graduating is found in 
the student class; 88.8^ of the students left 
school before obtaining a diploma. Of the class 
74,7^ left before graduating, while of the class only 
41.3?^ withdrew. 

Only 56 students, comprising 49 students and 
7 students, were able to graduate in three years of 

high school training. This represented 24.9^ of all 
graduates, but only S.zfo of all students who attended the 
ten high schools beginning in 1937, 1938, 1939, and 1940. 

The remaining 169 graduates required four years to qualify 
for a diploma. This group represented 75.1% of all the 
graduates, and 25.1% of all the students in attendance. 

A few students, 15 in number, attended Normal School with 
less than the required 100 credits.

The majority of graduates were again girls. (Table 
}CLVII). Of the larger non-graduate section, almost half 
were boys. Fifty-one, or 22.7% of the graduates are now in 
the armed services. Of the 449 non-graduates, 162, or 
36.1% of the total are now in the armed services. 

(November 31, 1943.) It'would appear from a study of the 
tables that many students cease attending high school in 
order to join the armed forces. Reading between the lines, 
one might say that because of the inability of the two-room 
high school programme to satisfy their needs, many students 
leave school preferring to join the armed services rather 
than to complete their high school training before taking 
such a step. 


Oeneral Conclusions 

1 . The programiaes in the fifty two-room high schools have 
met the needs of approximately half of the graduates, 

A total of 401 graduates, or 47.5% of the 844 students 
who did graduate, were able to take advantage of their 
academic training to attend Normal School, university, 
or to train as nurses. This represents but 14.2% of 
all students who were in attendance at these schools. 

In other words, the two-room high school apparently 
failed to satisfy academically the needs of 85.8% of the 
students. This is a generalization, however, founded 
upon figures contained in Table XLl(a).

A similar study of the results obtained from ten 
two-room high schools bears out the proportion stated 
above. From the ten two-room high schools 115 students, 
representing 51.1^ of all graduates, were able to 
capitalize on their educational advancement through 
attendance at Normal School, university, or at a 
hospital training school. This represented but 17.1% 
of the total number of students in attendance, however, 
so that apparently 8S.9% of the total number did derive 
full benefit from, attending high school. One might be 
reasonably safe in assuming, therefore, that the 
academic programme of the two-room high school satisfies 
approximately one out of every five students who attend. 
A second general conclusion at which one might arrive 
is that the longer a student remains in the high school 
the better chance he has of making use of his high 
school training after he leaves high school. This 
general conclusion may be founded upon Table XLY. 

Since it has been shown that a greater proportion of 
ttQtf students leave school in the early years of high 
school than of any other class of students, it would 
appear advisable to arrange the two-room high school 
programme in such a manner as to make provision for 
these students, and to keep them in the high school for 
a longer period of time. From Table XXX it was learned 
that 82.6% of the students, and 69.5% of the "B” 
students withdraw from high school without graduating.

From a study of tJie ten two-room high schools, (Table 
XLVI) it was learned that 88.8^ of the students, 
and 74.7^ of the students stopped attending high 
school without obtaining a diploma. It is quite clear, 
therefore, that since lengthier attendance in high 
school better fits the student to take his proper place 
in the v/orld, some precautions should be taken to insure 
increased attendance, especially on the part of and 
^’0” students. 

The two-room high school accoromodates female students 
to much better advantage than male students. It was 
learned from Table XLI(a), and again from Table XLY, 
that the greatest number of graduates from two-room 
high schools proceed to Normal School. It is generally 
recognized that the majority of students in attendance 
at Normal Schools are of the female sex. The same 
general comment holds true of students who enter 
university, business college, hospitals for training, 
or accept clerking positions. In other words, the 
majority of graduate students enter into one of these 
five fields: teaching, university, nursing, office work, 
and clerking, all of which are primarily fields into 
which girls are naturally attracted. For this reason, 
then, one might assume that the programme in the two- 
room high school is arranged to suit students intending 
to enter one or all of these fields. Since the majority 




of students entering these fields are girls, the 
programme in the two-room high school might be said to 
accommodate girls to a greater extent than male students. 

In a country which is predominantly agricultural, it 
seems strange that no high school courses are provided 
for students who are interested in that major industry. 
Many students who attend two-room high schools come 
from the farm. A logical conclusion, in keeping with 
the remarks above, would seem to be that some kind of 
agricultural course should be offered in the two-room 
high school to provide educational advancement suited 
primarily to the high school boys. A curriculum 
enriched with subjects close to the heart and chosen 
occupation of the average boy would, perhaps, satisfy 
the needs of boys to a greater extent than does the 
curriculum at present in vogue. 

A further conclusion may be drawn from the fact that 
27.8^ of the students who did not graduate from the ten 
two-room high schools went directly into the armed 
services from high school. Such a high percentage of 
students leaving high school before graduating would 
seem to indicate that their immediate needs were not 
being met by attendance at two-room high schools. 

For many students, it is possible that the attractiveness

of army service and a patriotic urge is responsible for 
enlisting at an early age. However, the Inducement of 
occupational training in preparation for active service 
in the armed forces, contrasted with the narrowness and 
inflexibility of the small high school programme, as 
well as the general inability of the staff to provide 
courses that satisfy the immediate requirements of 
students, probably constitutes the major reason why the 
percentage is so high. 

It should be noted in contrast that only 11.1^ of the 
graduate students joined the armed services immediately 
after graduation. Furthermore, 56.1% of the non¬ 
graduates from the ten two-room high schools are now in 
the armed forces, whereas only 22.7% of the graduates 
from these ten schools are now in His Majesty^s Armed 
Services. 

The final conclusion is that in the majority of cases 
the two-room high school does not fulfil its undertaking to 
educate the students who attend, and hence, by the same 
token, it does not serve the community to the greatest 
possible extent. The programme offered in any tv^o-room 
rural high school should be related to the economic and 
industrial life and welfare of that community. A high 
school programme founded on any other principle is 
basically inadequate. 



GliAPTER VI 


LOCKING AHEAD 

A critical appraisal of the two-room high school 
organization in Alberta should contain a fev\^ constructive 
suggestions destined to improve that institution. The 
noted differences between the two types of two-room high 
schools in Alberta are appreciably not great. Aside from 
administration, there is but slight difference in enrdlment, 
there is but little difference in the ability to provide 
courses for all students, and to enable them to graduate 
in either three or four years, and there is little difference 
in the ability of either type to provide an all-inclusive 
opportunity for educational advancement. Where there has 
been any appreciable difference it has been in favor of the 
two-room high school where Grades K » XII are taught. 

The Alberta high school curriculum is now in process 
of revision. For this reason, a few pertinent suggestions 
having relation to the deficiencies of the two-room high 
school in particular, and to the Alberta curriculum in 
general, might reasonably be offered, 

A Civic Curriculum 

This study has indicated that only 10.1^ of the 
graduate students from two-room high schools in Alberta 
attend university. This number represents, in turn, only 
3.0/^ of the total number of students who attended two-room

higii schools and who had an opportunity to graduate during 
one of the following years: 1940, 1941, 1942, and 1943. 

While the present curriculum in Alberta can hardly be 
described as pre-collegiate, it has many distinctive features 
which make its resemblance to such a curriculum quite 
evident. Students, parents, and teachers are all 
responsible for the fact that only 29.8^ of all students 
who enroll in two-room high schools are successful in 
graduating. The demand, generally, is for an academic 
curriculum, as is borne out by information contained in 
Chapter IV, yet the present curriculum, which has been 
labeled academic, is not advantageous to the majority of 
students, particularly the weaker students. It is suggested, 
therefore, that a transfer be made to what might be termed 
a ^Civic Curriculum’ . 

The pertinent question is: What educational opportunities 
should be offered by our public secondary schools in order 
that more boys and girls may prepare themselves adequately 
for happy and useful lives in the changing v/orld of today? 

The fundamental aim of the secondary school should be to 
include such courses in its programme as will best enable 
students to prepare for happy and useful lives in a changing 
world. 

There has been a significant move during the past 
few years to direct students awa^^ from a purely academic 
curriculum by providing a high school course of studies

sufficiently varied to suit the needs, interests, and 
capacities of the majority of students. The facts revealed 
by this study, however, indicate that this trend has not 
been satisfactorily carried out by the two-room high schools 
of this province. As the major problem to be faced in the 
average rural high school today is that of correct cur¬ 
riculum enrichment and appreciation,the charge can probably 
be justly made that educational executives have been too 
conservative in revising the curriculum; they have not been 
radical enough to meet the needs of the changing day and 
changing society. The following recommendations advocate 
a departure from the present practices common in Alberta, 
since, if the fundamental aim of secondary education is to 
be realized, further changes in the Alberta high school 
curriculum are necessary. 

1. Four-Year Hl^h School Programme : 

Table VIII showed that of 792 graduate students from 
two-room high schools who had an opportunity to graduate 
in three years only 169 students, or 21.3% of the total 
number, were able to do so. Of the 169 three-year 
-graduates, 160 were ^’A^^ students, 9 were ^’3^’ students, 
and none were ”0” students. Of the 844 students who 
actually graduated from the fifty two-room high schools 
during the period under study, only 221 students, or 
26.2% of the total number of graduates were able to 
secure the high school diploma in three years. This 
represents but 8.7% of the total number of students who

entered or attended the fifty two-room high schools 
during the same period. In other words, a three-year 
programme in the small two-room high school accommodates 
approximately one-quarter of the graduates, and less 
than one-tenth of those who originally enrolled in high 
school -- surely an unreasonable catering to the 
minority of students. 

Tables IX, X, XI, and XII show that students v/ho 
were in attendance but one year secured the mean number 
of 24,87 credits; for students in attendance but two 
years the mean number of credits secured was 53.53; 
for those in attendance three years, the mean was 
86.83 credits; and for those in attendance four or more 
years, 102.67 credits. The evidence furnished from this 
survey indicates that a four-year programme is almost 
essential in order that the average student may obtain 
a sufficient number of credits to qualify for a diploma. 
The data furnished by Tables XIII, XIV, and XV, which 
are related to a similar study of the students coming 
to two-room high schools at the Grade XI and Grade XII 
levels, supports this contention. 

Tables XVI . ..XXVII indicate the ability of the 

three classes of students and to earn 

credits over one-year, two, three, and four-year periods 
in the fifty two-room high schools. It is apparent that 
under existing conditions it is impossible for 
students to earn the high school diploma even over a

period of four years^ attendance at two-room high 
schools. Only the and students are able to 
earn a sufficient number of credits, on the average, 
over a four-year period to obtain more than the 
requisite one hundred credits for a diploma. This 
survey reveals conclusively that students of any ability, 
on the average, cannot earn a sufficient number of 
credits in a two-room school over a three-year period 
to obtain the high school diploma. 

The various histograms in Chapter III show more 
successful groupings of students in the upper ranges after 
four or more years’ attendance than after but three years. 

The adoption of the four-year programme would permit 
two-room high schools to serve equally the majority of 
students in attendance, rather than only the more 
capable few. This study has revealed that 8S.6?^ of 
the students withdraw from high school without 
graduating, 69.5% of the students likewise fail 
to complete their training42.8% of the students 
quit before graduating. While it is true that ”A’’ 
students form the majority of the enrollment, there can 
be no reason why equal educational advantages should not 
be extended to the less capable students as to the more 
capable. It should be pointed out, too, that the 
majority of ”A” students require four or more years to 
graduate. In adopting a four-year high school plan

tile ability of the majority of students, irrespective 
of category, would be more reasonably taxed. 

Under the four-year programme the small high school, 
and even the larger one, could be made more resourceful 
than is ordinarily possible under the conventional three- 
year programme. The more capable students might expand 
their programmes, not necessarily restricting themselves 
to the minimum number of credits to be earned. Students 
now graduating in three years are confined to purely 
academic subjects, whereas an additional year in the 
high school would enable capable students to choose 
from a lengthy list of both academic subjects and 
general electives, thus giving each student an oppor¬ 
tunity to enrich his educational background. Those who 
intend to teach, to attend university, or to train as 
nurses, should find the additional subjects of immense 
value in their later work. For the less capable 
student, the four-year programme would afford an 
opportunity to choose from a greater variety of subjects 
more suited to his needs, interests, and capacities. 

Under the four-year plan the proper time allotment to 
teaching could be restored in the two-room high school. 

At the present time in two-room high schools, G-rades IH - 
XII, the instruction time per period must be at least 
65^ of the standard req^uirement; in the other group, 
G-rades X - XII, the instruction time per period must be 
at least 85% of the standard requirement. Restoration

of teaciling time per period to 100% of the standard 
requirement should be valuable to the Instructors who 
might then devote additional time to weaker students. 

While it need not be the intention to add to any 
great extent to the course of studies at present in 
use, the four-year programme would permit a choice of 
general electives such as Typewriting, G-eneral Shop, 

Home Economics, and probably Agriculture, to be taught 
each year. Over a four-year period less emphasis might 
be placed annually on the academic electives so that a 
variety of general electives might be offered for the 
benefit of students v/ho are in need of such subjects. 

Not only v/ould the four-year programme permit more 
effective departmentalization of teaching in the two- 
room high school, but it would also allow more effective 
and appropriate grouping of students than is possible 
under a three-year programme. At the same time, it 
would permit desirable revisions in secondary school 
subject-matter, and the introduction of improved methods 
of teaching. 

It may be contended that making the high school 
programme a four-year programme would add one year to 
the average age of students who desire to attend 
university. Since the four-year high school programme 
has been adopted in British Columbia and in Ontario for 
a number of years and is proving to be highly effective 






and desirable, a comparative statement of the average 


ages of pupils and students in the various grades in 


British

however, that students in British Columbia having

additional years to obtain the B.A. degree at the 
University of British Columbia, and four additional 
years to obtain the degree of Bachelor of Applied 
Science, In Ontario three universities (Toronto, 
McMaster, and 'Q,ueen^s) req_uire three additional years 
after Urade XIII for a pass degree, and four additional 
years for an honors degree. Under the present system, 
therefore, Alberta students, in general, are three 
months younger when they complete senior matriculation 
to university. 

Typewriting, G-eneral Shop, and Home Economics :- 

To repeat, it is here postulated that educational 
opportunities should be offered in the secondary school 
to assist more boys and girls in preparing themselves 
adequately for happy and useful lives in the changing 
world. To attain this objective it is submitted that 
the three subjects of Typev/riting, G-eneral Shop, and 
Home Economics ought to be taught in every small rural 
high school. During the year 1942”1943 Typev^iting 
was offered in 26 of the fifty two-room high schools. 
General Shop 1 was offered in 16 of these schools, and 
General Shop 2 was offered in nine. Home Economics 1 
was offered in 12 schools, and Home Economics 2 in five. 
Typewriting la was studied by 52.13^ of the 94 students 
who graduated from two-room high schools, (Table XXXII), 
while the enrollment in General Shop and Home Economics

had included 14.89^ of the graduates. General Shop 2 
was successfully completed by 4.26^ and Home Economics 2 
by 6.38% of the 94 graduates. (Tables XXXII and XZXIII) 

A study of the record cards of students who graduated 
after attending three years revealed that very few 
enrolled in two of these courses, and very few in even 
one. In a four-year programme, most of the graduating 
students would have an opportunity to take all of 
these courses. 

It is evident from the summary in Chapter IV that 
these subjects may be taught successfully in the two- 
room high school with a minimum of equipment and under 
very trying conditions. Over the four-year period, 
1939-40, 1940-41, 1941-42, and 1942-43, General Shop 
and Home Economics were taught simultaneously in 23 
schools. Over the same period of time, Typewriting, 
General Shop, and Home Economics v/ere offered con¬ 
currently in a total of 18 schools. It is not 
impossible, therefore, to offer the three courses in 
the same year in a two-room high school. This 
-programme is not advisable, however, unless the services 
of travelling teachers for both General Shop and Home 
Economics are available. It would be much more 
advantageous, not only to the students but also for the 
general organization of the high school, to have at 
least one additional teacher on the high school staff 
if the three general electives are offered on the 

programme of the small high school in the same year.

Summing up the foregoing, it is apparent that the 
two-room rural high school is definitely limited in 
what it may offer to its students, that if a purely 
academic programme is offered in the high school, it 
is possible for the more capable students to graduate 
in three years. In this way the programme is made to 
fit the capabilities of the minority of students at 
the expense of the interests of the great majority of 
students who have neither the will nor the ability to 
pursue a purely academic course of studies. If more 
general electives are to be offered in the two-room 
high school so that the needs and capacities of the 
majority of students may be satisfied, students will 
require a longer period of attendance before they 
secure the high school diploma. 

In an effort to meet the needs of both superior and 
inferior classes of students, it is apparent that the 
two-room high school must be enlarged by the addition 
of a third teacher and probably a fourth. Reorganiz¬ 
ation of the curriculum to prepare all boys and girls 
for a happy and useful life must therefore involve 
some restriction in the number of subjects v/hich may be 
offered each year in the two-room high school, or else 
there must be some restriction in the number of grades 
in which instruction may be offered. The best

opportunities for high school students could be provided 
in a three or xT^ore roomed high school, in which the 
maximurii choice of subjects may be offered to students 
over a four-year period. 

This being true, it seems logical to assume that 
definite centers with more than two high school rooms 
should be established immediately throughout the 
province. To provide such centers and to equip them 
for offering instruction in such general electives as 
Typewriting, General Shop, and Home Economics would 
require much more money, planning, and organization 
than is necessary at the present time to operate the 
two-room high school. Yet whatever action is taken 
can hardly wait until the fruition of post-war plans. 
These centers should be established at once and the 
necessary building done at the earliest opportunity, 
so that our boys and girls may have the greatest 
advantage from them in the way of vocational training 
and broader high school programmes. Such centers would 
also assist in adult education as soon as circumstances 
permit. Of more immediate concern, however, is the 
need for providing equal educational opportunity for 
boys and girls, that they may train themselves for 
happy and useful lives in a constantly changing 
society. It is submitted that the extension of the 
high school programrrxe to include Typewriting, General 
Shop, and Home Economics, as well as Agriculture, in

each small rural high school would provide the 
necessary nucleus for fulfilling this need. 

Agriculture :- 

Probably half of the students in attendance at the 
small two-room high school come from rural areas. 
Despite this fact, and the fact that Alberta is 
primarily an agricultural province, and despite the 
further fact that vocational preparation is accepted 
as a worthy aim of our schools, educational authorities 
have nevertheless failed to provide courses in 
agriculture, a subject which should have great 
practical value to a number of students. 

Of the 844 graduate students from two-room high 
schools, 96, or 11,4^ of them married, remained at 
home, or went to farms. Of 674 non-graduates from the 
ten two-room high schools, 95, or 14.1^ married, 
stayed at home, or went to farms. Since these 
represent but a small proportion of the total number 
of students, the question might well be asked: Why 
introduce an agricultural course into the high school 
programme? 

The trend for young people in rural areas definitely 
leads av/ay from the farm. The subject-matter given in 
the high school tends to aggravate this situation 
rather than alleviate it. There is little at present 
offered in the two-room high school which would benefit

the agriculturally-minded student. 

It is proposed, therefore, that the responsible 
authorities introduce into the high school programme a 
course in Agriculture based on the principles used at 
Brooks, Alberta, where the objectives and some of the 
characteristics are: 

a. develop a sense of pride and personal satisfaction 
through participation in the agricultural industry. 

b. develop the ability and skill necessary to con¬ 
duct productive enterprises on a sound and economical 
basis. 

c. "To develop self-improvement, leadership, a recog¬ 
nition of leadership, and a sense of responsibility 
for general community betterment. 

d. "To familiarize pupils with sources of information 
and to develop habits of reading and research in 
solving the problems of the farm. 

"The work carried on was of two types: (l) Supervised 
practices v/hich consisted in the carrying out of a 
productive enterprise and attaining skills through 
actual operations. 

( 2 ) Classroom 

study which included the planning of students^ own 
projects, getting the basic information or inter¬ 
pretive knowledge and doing laboratory work, including 
field trips to farms and industrial plants using farm 
products." 

The introduction of this course would necessitate 
having on the staff a university graduate in agriculture, 
or a teacher who had taken several courses in agriculture. 
It would necessitate, too, the extension of accommodation

which, for the most part, would prevent this course 
from being offered in two-room high schools. The 
addition of such a course to the high school programme 
could be made logically, only where three teachers 
instruct students in the high school grades, and only 
in centers where accommodation would permit. 

True enough, the teaching of Agriculture in the 
high school would involve much more expense than the 
traditional subjects which have been offered in the 
past. However, present-day expenditures reveal that 
money can be a secondary consideration. By adding 
Agriculture to the high school programme it would be 
possible to offer educational advantages in the rural 
areas which would be comparable to those offered at 
present in city schools to the children of urban 
residents. By this means, too, the ideal of equal 
educational opportunity might be better served in that 
the weaker students, and also those who are at present 
not attracted into the high school at all, would have 
an opportunity to take courses more related to their 
immediate interests and capacities. 

The Re^rulations : - 

A somewhat radical change in the high school 
regulations would do much to encourage boys and girls 
to complete their high school training. 

At the present time the student is classified at the 
end of Grade IX. The sizes of the respective groups

’C* Category 19% 

’B’ Category 14% ^ 

It is proposed that the grouping should vary 
somewhat from the above in an effort to induce more 
students to enter the high school; in other words, the 
present screening of students at the Orade IX level 
appears to be out of proportion to the number of 
students who enter high school at the Grade X level. 

In 1937, for example, the enrollment in Grade IX was 
11,306. In 1938, the enrollment in Grade X v/as 7,503, 
a decrease of 27.2% in enrollment from the previous 
year. What the percentages should be in each 
category is left to the discretion of the Department 
of Education, not forgetting, however, that the 
distribution should be such that more Grade IX pupils 
may be encouraged to enter high-school grades. 

It is further proposed that a general course of 
studies be followed in Grades X and XI so that the 
needs of all students, regardless of ability, might be 
met asfer as possible. At the end of Grade XI a final 
examination in the-compulsory subjects should be set

by the Department and at that time the students 
reclassified into two groups, ’X’ and . Students 
showing better than average ability might be placed in 
’X’ category, while students showing lesser ability 
might be placed in category. The screening at the 
end of G-rade XI should then probably be in the follow¬ 
ing proportions: 

’X’ Category 40^ 

^Y’ Category 60% 

Students receiving ^X* promotion might be perm.itted 
to follow a programme in C-rades XII and XIII purely 
academic in nature, which would permit them to prepare 
for professional v/ork according to choice. Students 
receiving a ’Y’ promotion might be permitted to select 
an academic programme if they desired, but should be 
encouraged to complete their high school training by 
selecting the ’Core Subjects’, plus general courses 
in Mathematics and Science, and sufficient additional 
courses to earn enough credits for the high school 
diploma. 

In order to encourage the less capable student to 
continue in high school, the regulation should be 
abolished whereby he must sacrifice credits as he does 
at the present time in the small two-room high school 
as he is already sufficiently handicapped by virtue of 
his lower innate mentality. High standing in pre¬ 
requisite subjects should not be required except from 




students who intend to graduate with an acadeMc 
diploma. The students who pursue the general course 
should be required to write final examinations in only 
the core subjects, while those students*who intend to 
qualify for matriculation should be required to v;rite 
final examinations at the end of G-rade XIII in all 
subjects except the academic electives. The 
student in order to be admitted to the various pro¬ 
fessional fields should qualify with prescribed 
standing, while the student might earn a high 
school diploma by virtue of completing sufficient 
subjects to earn one-hundred credits, providing the 
^Gore Subjects^ are included in the group. 

Only one language should be taught in the txvo-room 
high school in one year, and that language, preferably 
French. It has long since been proven by eminent 
psychologists and educationists that the mental 
faculties are not strengthened by rigorous application 
to abstract mathematics, Latin, and foreign languages. 

At the same time, it has been experimentally proven 

that subjects such as Home Economics have a high transfer 

value as compared with traditional subjects. By 

eliminating one language from the curriculum of the 

small high school, more time can be devoted by the 

staff to other courses much more in line v/ith attaining the 

fundamental aim of secondary education.

Ill the view of the increasing importance which is 
being attached to the teaching of health, greater 
emphasis should be placed upon health instruction in 
the high school. Probably two courses should be 
provided for high-school students, one during the 
junior high-school period, and one during the senior 
high-school period. Physical Education should be 
provided at least one period each week for each high- 
school grade. The inculcation of good health habits 
and healthful living should be stressed rather than 
the assimilation of health facts. 

By providing a general course in Mathematics and 
in Science for students in G-rades XII and XIII, and 
by including a Health and Physical Education programme 
in each high-school grade, the number of credits which 
may be conveniently offered in a small high school is 
necessarily increased. This is just one more reason 
why the programme in the two-room high school should 
be definitely limited and why larger centers should be 
provided in order that the needs, interests, and capaci¬ 
ties of all students in attendance may be properly 
considered. Small classes should be avoided and at 
least five students should be enrolled in a subject 
before it may be offered on the programme of the two- 
room high school. In this v\ray it may be possible to

direct the energies of the staff toward serving the 
majority of students. Every assistance should be 
given to the lower-classified students. A set of 
rules to be used as a temporary guide might include 
the following: 

a. In a one-room rural high school instruction may be 
offered to students to the end of Grade XI. 

b. In two-room high schools, instruction may be 
offered to students to the end of Grade XII, and/or 
complete instruction to students. 

c. In the three-room high school, instruction may be 
offered to Grade XIII inclusive. Courses in 
Typewriting, General Shop, and Hom.e Economics must 
be offered if facilities are provided. Agriculture 
should be offered if possible. 

By introducing into Alberta high schools the ^Civic 
Curriculum’ herein outlined, by adopting the four-year high 
school programme, by introducing Typev/riting, General Shop, 
and Home Economics in each two-room high school, by 
including Agriculture whenever conditions permit, and by 
altering the ’Regulations’ for Alberta high schools, it 
should be possible to cater to the needs, capacities, and 
interests of all students entering the small rural high 
school. Through the adoption of these policies the small 
high school programme may become balanced and just in spirit 
and in practice. A sufficiently varied programme may 
thereby be offered, so that acadein.io as well as general 
courses may be selected by students. The small high school 
will thus be able to fulfil the immediate requirements 


of students. 






The enlargement and expansion of the small two-room 
high school or, on the other hand, its restriction in 
function, are but incidental to the greater aim of 
adequately preparing boys and girls for happy and useful 
lives in the changing world of today.
