ABSTRACT 


The pyrolysis of normal butane diluted by a lean natural gas 
and of a rich natural gas containing significant amounts of ethane, 
propane; and butane was investigated at temperatures in the order of 
2000 ^F in a continuoLis tubular reactor. The effects of temperature^ 
space velocity and hydrocarbon concentration in the feed gas on the 
product yield were investigated. 

The main decomposition products x^rere found to be methane 
ethylene; acetylene, carbon and hydrogen. Small a.mounts of propylene 
were formed at the less severe pyrolysis conditions. Of these ethylene 
and acetylene are of commercial interest. 

Ethylene yield was found to pass through a maximum with respect 
to space velocity. The acetylene yield decreased with increasing space 
velocity over the range investigated. The ratio of ethylene to acetylene 
increased with the carbon number of the feed. 

A process for production of acetylene and ethylene by pyrolysis 
of a rich natural gas has commercial possibilities, if a suitable method 
of supplying the large energy requirements of the process at a high 
temperature level can be devised.

INTRODUCTION 


Recent interest in acetylene and ethylene as raw 
materials for the chemical industry has stimulated a great deal of 
research on the thermal decomposition of low molecular weight hydro¬ 
carbons. However^ despite the large amount of fundamental and applied 
work which has been carried out^ there are still wide gaps in the data 
in the regions of industrial interestparticularly with regard to the 
optimum conditions for acetylene formation. 

The key variables in the pyrolysis of light hydrocarbons 
are temperature^ contact time^ and partial pressure of the reactant. The 
objective of this project was to study the effect of these variables on 
the yields of ethylene and acetylene from p^nrolysis of a stream of butane 
diluted by natural gas. Particular emphasis was placed on a^cetylene 
formation. 

Sutane was chosen as the hydrocarbon raw material because 
large quantities are expected to be available in Alberta with the corximence- 
ment of large scale gas export. Available data and theoretical consider¬ 
ations indicated that high acetylene yields would be favored by carrying 
out the butane pyrolysis in the presence of a diluent gas. Natural gas 
was thought to have some advanta^ges as a diluent^ since after acetylene 
and ethylene recovery the remaining off gases could be used as fuel 
to supply most of the process heat. Also the resulting data should be 
helpful in assessing the possibilities of utilizing a rich natural gas

as feedstock for this type of process, thus eliminating the cost of 
butane separation and recovery. To investigate this latter proposal 
more fully a few tests were run feeding such a rich gas, containing 
significant amounts of ethane, propane, and butane directly to the 
pyrolysis furnace. 

A continuous tubular ceramic reactor was used because of 
its relative simplicity, although the low heat transfer rates obtainable 
have prevented its industrial application for acetylene production.

THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 


(a) The rmodynami c s 

All hydrocarhons are unstable at high temperatures and the 
final equilibrium pyrolysis products would be essentially carbon and 
liydrogen. Therefore^ it is necessary to quench the reactions before 
equilibrium is reached. Rapid quenching is assisted by the endothermic 
nature of the p;>'Tolysis reactions. Under the conditions used in this 
study appreciable amounts of methane;, ethylene and acetylene were also 
present in the product gas. 

Without making any assumptions as to the actual mechanism 
involved^ these products may be considered as being formed by the following 
stoichiometric reactions. 

Free energy changes and Kp values have been calculated over 
the range of temperature of interest in this investigation.

The following conclusions are evident: 

1) The most favored reaction at all temperatures is that to carbon and 
hydrogen. 

2 ) The equilibrium yields of ethylene^ and particularly acetylene are 
increased by increasing temperature while the equilibrium yield of 
methane is relatively imaffected by temperature. 

3) Since all reactions show a. volume increase^ they should be favored 
by a reduced partial pressure of butane in the feed. 

A measure of the approach to equilibrium of the reactions 
forming the intermediate products methane^ ethylene and acetylene may be 
obtained by considering the ethylene-acetylene and methane-acetylene 
equilibria, ff-om the stoichiometric equation 

C2H4 = CgHg + Hg K = (pHg) (^ CpHo) 

(pCpCi 

it may be shown that the C2H2/C2H4 ratio will be a function of the 
temperature and partial pressiire only. Similarly it may be shov/n that 
the ratio is a function of temperature^ partial pressure^ and

The formation of acetylene is seen to be strongly endo¬ 
thermic. The formation of ethylene and the decomposition to carbon and 
hydrogen are moderately endothermic, v/hile the formation of methane is 
actually slightly exothermic. The heat of reaction does not vary signi¬ 
ficantly with temperature.

(b) Kinetics and Mechanism 

The pyrolysis of the paraffin hydrocarbons to acetylene 
is considered to go through a series of intermediate reactions^ with 
ethylene probably the most important product directly preceding acetylene 
formation (2). 

The initial decomposition reactions of the paraffins are 
homogeneous and apparently follow a first order rate expression ( 2 ). How¬ 
ever this simple relationship breaks down at high degrees of conversion 
and at both low and high pressures. Also the temperatures at which 
kinetic studies have been carried out are much lower than those obtained 
in this investigation. 

Data on the mechanism of hydrocarbon decomposition are 
rather sketchy and confined almost entirely to studies of methane and 
ethane pyrolysis. However it does appear that free radical mechanisms 
play an important part^ at least in the initial decomposition reactions (2) 
There is evidence to indicate that the decomposition of ethylene to 
acetylene proceeds by a molecular mechanism. Once again the majority of 
the published data has been obtained at temperatures much lower than those 
encountered in this work. 

Tropsch and Egloff pyrolyzed n-butane at 2000 ‘^F and 50 
mm Hg. A graphical presentation of their data reproduced from Kramer 
and Happel ( 2 ) is shown in Figure 3 * It is evident here that ethylene is 
the most important intermediate product preceding acetylene formation.

(c) Coimnercial Development 

A good deal of effort has heen devoted to the develop¬ 
ment of commercial processes for the production of acety 3 e ne hy light 
hydrocarbon pyrolysis. At least three of these appear to have commercial 
possibilities. 

a) The Schoch process^ presently in the development 
stage at the University of Texas^ uses a shaped electrical discharge to 
supply energy to the reacting gases. An effective pyrolysis temperature 
of 2600°F is reached and an off gas containing 10^ acetylene is produced. 
However the high energy requirements of the acetylene producing reactions 
mah.e the process uneconomical imless extremely cheap power is available. 

b) The Sacchsse process is at present the only process 
in commercial use for acetylene manufacture by hydrocarbon pyrolysis. 
Energy is supplied by partial combustion of the reacting gases^ and 
pyrolysis temperat-ures up to 2700 °F are obtainable. Using pure oxygen 
for combustion an acetylene concentration of 8.5/^ in the off gas is 
obtained. To be economical the process requires utilization of the by 
product "synthesis gas"^ a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Also 
the tonnage oxygen requirements mahe a large plant size necessary for 
economic operation. 

c) The Wulff (Koppers-Hasche) (3) (^) process^ with 
two pilot scale plants in operation^ uses a regenerative type cracking 
Furnace in which a refractory checkeivrork alternately absorbs heat from 
fuel gas combustion and releases it to supply the necessary energy for

the pyrolysis reactions. Steam dilution is used to obtain a low hydro¬ 
carbon partial pressure during reaction and to reduce carbon black 
formation. Reaction temperatures of 2200 to 2400 ‘^F are reached. Acetylene 
yields are reported as 40-50 mols/100 mols of butane fed; ethylene yields 
are of similar magnitude. The usu8-l disadvantages of non-continuous processes 
are present here - chiefly inefficient use of reactor volume and Incomplete 
control of operating variables. 

It is significant that all the above processes avoid 
the transfer of heat through a solid wall to the reacting gas. There are 
two reasons for this - the high energy requirements of the process and 
the high temperature level at which this energy must be supplied. The 
required high temperature can be withstood successfully only by ceramic 
materials. The low mechanical strengtn or the available materials 
necessitates a thick reactor wall^ which in combination with their low 
thermal conductivity leads to an excessive temperature drop through the 
wall. In addition ceramic materials are difficult to fabricate into shapes 
having a high heat transfer area/reactor volume ratio. 

A considerable amount of development work on the Wulff 
process was done by Hasche (5)(6)(7) "using a tubular reactor^ although 
it was eventually abandoned in favor of a regenerative type furnace. The 
feed was preheated to about iSOO^F in a stainless steel coil in order to 
reduce the heat load in the ceramic tube. Hasche's data for the laboratory 
scale cra-cking of propane are presented in Figure 4 . The same trends in 
product yields would be expected with a butane feed.

Some data is available on the use of butane as a feed 
for the V/ulff process and is of interest since reaction conditions are 
very similar to those of the present work. However much of this inform¬ 
ation is in the form of patent data and even in the published material 
reaction conditions are sketchily and incompletely described. 

Some recent work by Linden (8) on the cracking of hydro¬ 
carbon feedstocks^ including butane^ also has a bearing on this investi¬ 
gation. A continuous reactor employing an electrically heated silicon 
carbide reactor tube was used. Operating temperatures of 2400 - 2500 °F 
were obtained. Diluent steam was added to red-uce the hydrocarbon partial 
pressure. Unfortunately the use of an inert diluent (steam) prevents 
direct comparison of any of this information with the results of the present 
work. 


EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURE 

A flow diagram of the reaction system is sho^m in Figure 
n-Butane was metered in the liquid state^ vaporized and mixed with a 
metered stream of natural gas. This mixture was then passed through a 
silicon carbide reaction tube mounted vertically in a gas fired furnace. 

The cracked gas leaving the furnace was quenched in a water cooled section 
of pipe and passed through a glass cloth filter to remove the carbon formed 
during pyrolysis. A sample was taken 8,t this point by means of a small 
diaphragm type pump. The gas was then cooled^ metered and exhausted to 


vent.

The furnace used is shown in Figures 6 and 7. It has 
been described in earlier work (9) so only a brief description will be 
included here. The overall dimensions were approximately four feet in 
diameter by four feet high. Between the fire chamber and the water cooled 
steel shell were a layer of fire bricky a layer of insulating brick and a 
layer of castable insulation. The fire chamber dimensions were twenty-four 
inches in diameter by thirty inches hi^ at the centre. Pcemixed natural 
gas and air were supplied to four burners mounted in the floor of the furnace. 
Flue gases were water spray quenched and exhausted to vent. The furnace 
was operated at full thermal capacity during all tests. 

fvo different types of reaction tribes were employed. The 
first consisted of a 1 - 7/8 inch O.D. x I-I/8 inch I.B. silicon carbide tube 
mounted as shown in Figure 8. The second consisted of a 2 - 3/4 inch O.D. 
by 2 inch I.D. silicon carbide tube with a 1-^/8 inch diameter corebuster. 

This assembly is shown in Figure 9 * tubes were mounted by bolting 

the base plate directly to the bottom of the furnace. The inlet to a 
tube was formed by cementing progressively smaller tubes inside the reactor 
tube until a 1 inch outside diameter was reached. A neoprene hose connected 
the reactor tube inlet to the feed gas system. 

The cemenls used were either zlrconia-cement fondu or 
alundum-cement fondu mixtures. With proper curing these exhibited very 
little shrinkage and stood up well at the temperatures encountered. 

Pressures and differential pressures were measured by water 
filled manometers. Ejectors on the off gas and flue gas lines permitted 
control of pressures in both the reaction system and the fiie chamber.

Pyrolysis of Normal Butane at High Temperature. 



























































































































11 - 


Butane flow was measured by a calibrated rotameter; gas flows were 
measured by bellows type domestic meters. Metering temperatures were 
measured by dial thermometers. Reaction tube temperatures were meas-ured 
by a Leeds and Nortlirup optical pyrometer. The control panel arrangement 
is sho\-m in Figure 10. 

The product gases were analyzed by the Research Council 
of Alberta analytical staff using a Fisher-Gulf gas chromatography apparatus. 

The butane used was commercial grade normal butane supplied 
by the Imperial Oil Limited Calgary Refinery. It analyzed 6 . 5 ^ iso-butane. 
The diluent gas was Viking-Kinsella natural gaS; obtained from the Northwest 
Utilities substation. This gas had the following analysis. 

CHg = 91.0fo 

C2% = 2.0i 

CjHg = 0.5/0 

Wg = 6.5/ 

All tests were of short duration due to plugging of the 
reactor tubes by carbon formed in the pyrolysis reactions.

RESULTS 

The pyrolysis of normal huteme-natural gas mixtures was 
investigated at butane concentrations from 0 to 35^ ^^id at space velocities 
of 15^ 25 and 35 seconds . Space velocity is defined here as volumetric 
feed rate (measured at 2000*^F and '[00 mm)/reactor volume. 

Outside wall temperatures of the reaction tube were 
measured using an optical pyrometer. For the circular reactor tube this 
temperature ranged from 2550 to 2650°F^ depending on the heat load. For 
the annular reactor tube the temperature range was 263O to 2700’^F. 

Direct temperature measurements of the reacting gas were felt to be im¬ 
practical for the following reasons: 

1) Radiation effects^ both from the tube walls and from 
reradiating c8,rbon particles. 

2) The possibility of a surface catalyzed reaction on the 
temperature measuring element. 

The other major experimental difficulty was plugging of 
the reactor tubes with carbon formed during the pyrolysis reactions. This 
necessitated tests of short duration^, especially at the more seveie cracking 
conditions. Tsmperature measurements on the reactor tube during the course 
of a test indicated that; at least in the shorter testS; steady state 
operation was not reached. This fact is probably responsible for some of 
the scattering among the data; although sample collection was delayed 
until as late in the tests as possible. 

The raw test data are tabulated in Table 1 for the I-I/8 
inch I.D. circular reactor tube and in Table 2 for the 2 inch x 1-5/8 

inch annular reactor tube. Material balances for the tests with mixed 
natural gas-butane feeds are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Details of

the calculations are shown in the Appendix. These data have been plotted 
in Figures 11 to l6 which show mols of product formed/lOO mols of feed 
as a function of the concentration of butane in the feed. Thus for a 
compound^ such as methane^ which is present in both the feed and product 
the figure plotted is the change in the number of mols during the reaction. 
Best fit curves were drawn by eye for carbon and 

hydrogen yields were then adjusted to make the data internally self 
consistent. Data for further calculations were taken from these smoothed 
curves. 

Another series of tests were made using a rich gas 
mixture of the following composition as feedstock. 

CHi^ = 69.5/0 

CgHg = 111-. 5^ 

C^Hg = 9.05s 

=2.5/0 
= 4.5/0 

Test data are included in Tables 1 and 2 and material balances are presented 
in Table 5. Product composition is shown graphically as a function of 
space velocity in Figure Y[. 

Yields of acetylene and ethylene were calculated as 
mols/100 mols of Cg equivalent in the feed. These are plotted as a 
function of percent butane in the feed for the different space velocities 
in Figures 18 to 21. 


Ethylene and acetylene yields from the rich gas feed were

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 


Evaluation of the separate effects of temperature^ percent 
"butane and space velocity on the acetylene and ethylene yields is difficult 
since in this reactor the temperature is a function of the heat load^ 
which in turn is dependent on the other two variables. As no direct 
temperature measurements were available^ an effort was made to estimate 
upper and lower gas temperature limits at various reaction conditions from 
heat transfer and chemical equilibria considerations. 

Gas Temperature Estimation 

For each test the gas temperatures corresponding to the 
measured C2H2/C2H^ and C2H2/CH^^ ratios were obtained from Figures 1 and 
2. These temperatures^ listed in Tables 6 and 7^ provide a lower limit 
for the temperature reached by the reacting gases. Maximum gas temperatures 
calculated from heat transfer considerations are shown as a function of 
heat load in Figures 26 and 27. The postulated heat transfer mechanism 
assumed heat transfer by convection from the tube walls to the gas and by 
radiation from the tube walls to a cloud of carbon particles formed in 
the pyrolysis reactions. These carbon particles were assumed to be in 
thermal equilibrium with the gas. Details of these calculations are shown 
in the Appendix. 

For purposes of comparison several of the calculated 
equilibrium temperatures were included in Figures 26 and 27• At high 
heat loads (i.e. low reaction temperatures) the temperature estimates from 
equilibrium considerations approach 'iShe temperature arrived at from heat

transfer considerations, but at low heat loads (i.e. high reaction 
temperatures) the equilibrium temperature estimates are much below the 
expected gas temperature. This result indicates that equilibrium was not 
reached at the hi^er reaction temperatures. The most tenable explanation 
for this is that the equipment could not supply the required energy for 
the highly endothermic acetylene forming reactions at the high temperature 
levels. 

This conclusion was confirmed by a consideration of the 
reaction heats involved. The energy requirements for pyrolysis of a 
butane feed at a space velocity of 25 sec”^ and a temperature of 2400^F 
were calculated. Equilibrium yields of and and very little 

free carbon formation were assumed. The resulting heat load was IO5 M Btu/hr. 
However at this temperature the maximum calculated heat transfer rates 
are only 30 M Btu/hr. for the circular reactor tube and 40 M Btu/hr for 
the annular reactor tube. 

Effect of Percent Butane in Feed 

(a) The ethylene yield is increased by increasing the 
percent butane in the feed. This result is attributed to a higher rate 

of decomposition for butane than for methane. The higher rate would be 
expected since a comparison of the activation energies shows a value of 
59 k cal/mol for the initial butane decomposition (lO) compared to 79 kcal/ 
mol for methane decomposition (2). 

(b) The acetylene yield shows an initial increase with per¬ 
cent butane in the feed, which can be explained by the same reasoning as

in (a). Hov;-ever the increase in yield is not nearly as marked and with 
further increases in percent butane the yields level off and then begin 
to decline. Tivo factors are probably contributing here 

(1) The lower temperatures accompanying an increase in 
the percent butane in the feed lower the equilibrium concentration of 
acetylene. 

(2) Once appreciable quantities of butane are present in 
the feed the rate controlling reaction is probably the decomposition of 
ethylene to acetylene. The activation energy of this reaction has been 
estimated as 77 kcal/mol (2) and hence the reaction may be slightly faster 
than the methane decomposition but is probably much slower than the butane 
decomposition. 

(c) The rich gas feed gave more ethylene and about the 
same amount of acetylene as a 13^ butane-methane mixture with the same 
carbon number except for the acetylene yields in the circular reactor tube 
which are inconsistent with the rest of the data. The increased ethylene 
yield can be explained by examining the analysis of the two feeds: 


Rich Gas Feed 
CHj^ = 69.5/0 

CgHg = 111-. 5 / 

C^Hg = 9-0/ 

C 4 %o = 2.5/. 


Buta.ne-Natural Gas Feed 
CHj^ = 19-% 

CgHg = 1.7/ 

CjHq = o.kj, 

= 13.0/ 


Since the rich gas feed contains less methane and more of the more reactive 
hydrocarbons^ the rate of ethylene formation would be higher than for the 


butane-natural gas feed.

Effect of Space Velocity 

The effect of space velocity is complementary to the 
effect of temperature since raising the temperature and lowering the space 
velocity both increase the severity of the pyrolysis conditions. In the 
reactor used in this study any increase in space velocity was accompanied 
by a decrease of temperature due to the increased, heat load; hence it is 
difficult to say whether the effects observed are primarily the result of 
space velocity or temperature changes. 

Over the range of space velocities studied the ethylene 
yields increased with increased space velocity and in several instances 
passed through a maximum. This was expected^ since the ethylene yield 
will certainly pass through a maximum with respect to reaction time. 

The acetylene yield fell off with increasing space velocity 
which indicates that the maximum acetylene yield would be reached at a 
space velocity below those employed in this investigation. The rate of 
acetylene formation will certainly be governed by the rate at which energy 
can be supplied to the reactants^ hence the higher acetylene yields at the 
lower space velocities would be expected. 

Heat Transfer Limitations 

The two reactor tubes employed in this investigation are 
described in the equipment section. The annular tube had the better heat 
transfer characteristics as a comparison of the heat transfer surface/

reactor voliune ratios will show 

Annular tube - surface/volume ratio = 7I ft^/ft^ 

Circular tube - surface/volurae ratio = 43 ft^/ft^ 

A higher heat input/unit time and hi^er temperature vrere 
therefore obtained in the tests in the annular tube. A comparison of the 
energy absorbed and maximum temperature reached by the reacting gases is 
given below.

1 . Gas temperature was calculated from heat transfer considerations 

2. Assuming the product gases left the furnace at the calculated gas 
temperature. 

Examination of the experimental data showed the following 
effects resulting from the higher heat input to the annular reactor tube; 

(1) Indicated equilibrium temperatures were generally higher 
in the annular reactor tube. 

(2) The ethylene maximum was reached at a higher space 
velocity (i.e. shorter contact time) in the annular reactor tube.

( 3 ) Acetylene yields were higher at all space velocities 
in the einnular reactor tube. 

( 4 ) Much more carhon and hydrogen were formed in the 
annular reactor tube. 

The major limitation on the practicability of a highly 
endothermic process such as this is the rate at which energy can be supplied 
to the reacting system. As previously indicated the high heat fluxes and 
high temperature drops necessary make heat transfer through a wall im¬ 
practical. For example at the highest head load encountered in this 
investigation the heat flvoz was approximately 70 M Btu/ft and the total 
temperature drop from the furnace to the reacting gases in the order of 
lOOO^F. By comparison in the regenerative furnace described by Farns^/rorth 
( 4 ) the heat transfer rates are in the order of 10^000 Btu/ft with a temp¬ 
erature drop of 150°F. 

In conclusion then it may be said that the pyrolysis of 
a natural gas stream rich in ethane^ propa.ne and butane appears to be a 
practicable commercial source of ethylene and acetylene in Alberta,, if a 
suitable means of supplying the high energy requirements of the process 
at a high temperature level can be devised. 

In order to gain some idea of the possibilities of meeting 
the energy requirements of the process by using the off gas from 
acetylene and ethylene recovery as fuel aui energy balance was worked out 
for the following hypothetical conditions. 






- 21 - 


Feed - 15fo butane + lean natural gas 
Reaction temperature - 2400^F 

Products - Equilibrium amounts of ^2’ 

Negligible free carbon formation. 


Results on the basis of 100 lb. mols of feed entering at 

75*^F and the pyrolysis products leaving at 2400°F were: 

lyrolysis energy requirements = 13^760 M Btu 

Energy available from off gas combustion assuming no sensible 
heat recovery = 12000 M Btu. 

Energy available from off gas combustion assuming 50^ of 

flue gas sensible heat is recovered^ say by preheating combustion 

air, = 17,450 M Btu. 


It therefore appears that the process off gases could 
supply most or all of the energy requirements of the process.

GAS TEMPERATURE 
HEAT TRANSFER 


ESTIMATION FROM 
CONSIDERATIONS 


a) Proposed Mechanism 

The heat transfer to the reacting gases was considered to 
taJie place mainly "by radiation from the tube \7all to a cloud of carbon 
particles at or very near to thermal equilibrium with the gas. The heat 
transferred by convection from the tube wall to the gas was also taken 
into account. 

b) Outline of Calculations 

1) A final gas temperature was assumed and the sensible 
and reaction heat loads calculated. 

2) The temperature drop through the tube wall and hence the 
inside wall temperature for this heat load were calculated. 

3) The area required for sensible heat transfer was calculated 
using the log mean temperature difference. 

The final gas temperature was calculated from the remaining 
area and the heat of reaction. 

5) If the calculated gas temperature did not agree with the 
assmed gas temperature the calculation was repeated. 

c) Estimates and Assumptions 


1) The convection heat transfer coefficients were estimated as

2 ) The ass-umed eramissivity values were 

Silicon carbide tube wall - £,=0.85 
Carbon particles - £g= 0.9 

3) The heat of reaction was assumed to be constant over 
the temperature range involved. 

4 ) View factor = 1 

5) An average reactor tube temperature was used in the 
calculations althou^ the tube * s temperature will vary slightly along 
its length.
