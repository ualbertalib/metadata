"I met the Duke of Newcastle upon the broad ground 
of public principle, and upon that ground alone. I 
own no other bond of union with him than this, that 
he in his exalted sphere, and I in my humble one, 
entertained the same persuasion, that the institutions 
of this country are to be defended against those 
who threaten their destruction, at all hazards, and 

to all extremities.------ You 

return me to parliament, not merely because I am 
the Duke of Newcastle’s man : but because both the 
man whom the duke has sent and the duke himself, are 

$our^men.“-(Speech to electors after 

election at Newark 1832). 

"We are compelled to accompany that acceptance 
with the sorrowful declaration that the differences, 
not of a temporary or casual nature merely, but 
differences of conviction, differences of prepossession 
differences of mental habit, and differences of 
fundamental tendency, between the House of Lords

and the House of Commons, appear to have reached 
a development in the present year such as to create 
a state of things of which we are compelled to say 

that, in our judgment, it cannot continuer---- 

- The issue which is raised between 

a deliberative assembly, elected by the votes of 
more than 6,000,000 people, and a deliberative 
assembly occupied by many men of virtue, by many 
men of talent,of course with considerable diversities 
and varieties, is a controversy which, when once 
raised, must go forward to an issue.** 

(Last speech in House of Commons, 1894.) 

Eetween these two speeches lies the whole 
political history, extending over sixty years, of 
William Ewart Gladstone. 

The writer seeks, in the following pages, to 
trace the influence of various forces operating to 
bring about the remarkable and unusual change of 
mental attitude revealed in the foregoing quotations .

History, biography, and fietion have presented 
again and again the young man entering the arena of 
public life, confident that the remedy for the evils 
which exist on every hand is the overturning of 
present day institutions. He is at war with his 
father's ideas. He is certain that if he and those 
who think as he does are only allowed to have their 
way, humanity will rapidly progress toward the long- 
sought goal of universal happiness. The young man, 
radical though he may be at the beginning of his 
career, becomes, as the years go by, more and more 
conservative, more and more tenacious of the insti¬ 
tutions of the past, less and less inclined to 
change. 

In striking contrast to this usual type of 
political experience is the career of Gladstone. His 
history is a reversal of the common order. In youth 
he clung to tradition - in old age he foresaw and 
favored reforms most radical. 

An anti-reform speech at the Oxford Union in 
undergraduate days brings him, almost as soon as he

leaves the College halls, an offer of a great man’s 
influence in the borough of Newark. Oup first quota¬ 
tion is taken from the successful candidate's speech 
to the electors. Between that and our second extract 
there lies a long road. But a straight road, if long 
enough,and consistently followed, must necessarily 
lead one to a great distance from the starting point. 

In considering thus a life so different from that 
of the average public man, we are led to note the 
circumstances or other influences which combined to 
produce the final result. Chief among these were, 
a home where religion was real and personal, an educa¬ 
tion received at Eton and Oxford, and the friend¬ 
ships of some of the best known men of his time. To 
these outside influences must be added those 
characteristics which were innate--his dual person¬ 
ality, "half ifrighlanfl, half lowland", derived from 
his Scotch ancestry, and combining the caution and 
steadfastness of the one with the impetuosity and 
fire of the other } his religious life permeating all 
his activities } his love of truth t his desire

always to be fair • and his marvellous capacity for 
close, continuous thought and work. Then somewhere 
or somehow,he became imbued with the Anglo-Saxon 
love of liberty and self-government. 

He was born in Liverpool in 1809, the fourth 
and youngest son of John Gladstone. There were also 
in the family two daughters. To the decidedly re¬ 
ligious influence of his sister Anne, who died in 
1829, Gladstone himself bears testimony. But that 
influence was only accentuated by the religious 
atmosphere of the home. The mother,though suffering 
much from bodily pain, left a strong impression of 
her piety and fortitude on the mind of her son. The 
father was accustomed to discuss all subjects freely 
with his children. He could not understand why any 
one, knowing the right, should not follow it. His 
interest in religious matters expressed itself also 
in a practical manner in the building of churches. 

Of these he built three even before successful 
business had brought wealth.

In spite of Gladstone's devotion to and admiration 
of his father, there must have been, however, some 
occasional questionings in regard to his enterprises. 
In the later years of his mercantile life, John 
Gladstone, who had been head of an East India firm, 
became the owner of some large sugar plantations in 
Jamaica and Demerara, These were, of course, worked 
by slave labour. In 1823, an outbreak of the slaves 
in Demerara was put down with great cruelty, and the 
Gladstone estates figure prominently in the parlia¬ 
mentary reports. The owner defended himself by numer¬ 
ous letters and pamphlets in which he did not"defend 
slavery in the abstract, but protested against the 
abuse levelled at the planters.” To present-day 
standards the combination of ”fervid, evangelical 
religion with antagonism to abolition" would seem 
an impossible thing ; but it was from a family where 
such a union existed that there came one who in 
later days was looked to as champion by those 
European nations who struggled for freedom.

In 1821 he was sent to Eton where he remained for 


over six years. Here he did nothing remarkable, 
though there remains a tradition that he was a favor¬ 
ite of a head master remembered chiefly for terror- 
inspiring qualities. During this period he was 
characterized as a "diligent, cheerful, healthy- 
minded school-boy ,f . 

October, 1828 finds himjjsntering Christ Church 
College, Oxford. Here he continued many of the 
friendships begun at Eton- Frederick Rogers, Doyle, 
Gaskell, Charles Canning and the two Denisons. Mew 
acquisitions at Oxford were Phillimore, F.D.Maurice 
and Sidney Herbert. His friend Arthur Hallam had 
entered Cambridge. The two men, Hope and Manning, 
who became perhaps his closest friends in later 
days and whose conversion to Roman Catholicism 
made such a break in his life were here not much 
more than acquaintances. 

In the debates at the Oxford Union he shows 
himself an ardent pupil of Canning and an opponent 
of Reform. In Canning he had a close, personal

interest because of the latter's political connection 
with ftofen Gladstone at Liverpool. 

Our undergraduate's interest in the politics of 
the time was not confined to college halls. In the 
autumn of 1831 he journeyed to London to hear the 
debate on the Reform Bill in the House of Lords. 

He also took part with other undergraduates in the 
proceedings of the great election that followed, 
joining with them in the anti-reform procession. 

At the end of 1831 he leaves Oxford, having ob¬ 
tained the rare honour of a double-first. 

Of the influence of Oxford upon his thinking, 
he writes, many years later : 

"I think that Oxford teaching had in our day an 
anti-popular tendency. I must add that it was not 
owing to the books, but rather to the way in which 
they were handled : and further, that it tended 
still more strongly in my opinion to make the love 
of truth paramount over all other motives in the mind 
and thus that it supplied an antidote for whatever 

it had of bane. The Reform Bill frightened me in 1831

and drove me off my natural and previous bias. Burke 
and Canning misled many on $hat subject and they 
misled me" . 

and again 

"Oxford had rather tended to hide from me the 
great fact that liberty is a great and precious gift 
of God, and that human excellence cannot grow up in 
a nation without it. And yet I do not hesitate to 
say that Oxford had even at this time laid the 

foundations of my liberalism ----- while in 

the arms of Oxford, I was possessed through and 
through with a single-minded and passionate love of 
truth.” 

Here then we have a young man,brought up in all 
the traditions of toryism, and prepared at the out¬ 
set of his career to stand by those principles. 

He enters parliament in the beginning of!833. The 
high tide of reform which had culminated in Catholic 
Emancipation in 1829 and the Reform Bill of 1832, had 
not yet wholly ebbed, and the first session of the 
reformed parliament attempted and accomplished much

in the way of reform legislation. In this parliament 
it is well to note that there was a group of men, 
followers of Peel, distinct from the inveterate 
Tories and known as Conservatives. Peel decided at 
once that, the nation having spoken so strongly for 
reform, it was necessary for him to accept its will. 
?rora his position in the House Peel no doubt exer¬ 
cised a great influence upon the young man just 
entering : yet it is interesting to note that one 
who afterwards became a leader in legislation voted 
with his party. Morley says, recording the work of 
that first session : 

"Besides his speeches he gave a full number of 
party votes,some of them interesting enough in view 
of the vast career before him. I think the first of 
them all was in the majority of 428 against 40 upon 
O'Connell's amendment for repeal,- an occasion that 
came vividly to his memory on the eve of his moment¬ 
ous change of policy in 1886. He voted for the worst 
clauses of the Irish Coercion Bill including the 

court-martial clause. He fought steadily against the

admission of Jews to parliament. He fought against 
the admission of dissenters without a test to the 
universities, which he described as seminaries for 
the established church. He supported the existing 
corn law. He said 'No' to the property tax and ’Aye* 
for retaining the house and window taxes. He resisted 
a motion of Hume's for the abolition of military 
and naval sinecures (Feb.14) and another motion of 
the same excellent man's for the abolition of all 
flogging in the army save for mutiny and drunkenness. 
He voted against the publication of the division 
lists. He voted with ministers both against shorter 
parliaments, and ( April 25) against the ballot, a 
cardinal reform carried by his own government forty 
years later. On the other hand he voted (July5) with 
Lord Ashley against postponing his beneficent policy 
of factory legislation: but he did not vote either 
way a fortnight later when a1 thorp sensibly reduced 
the limit of ten hours work in factories from the 
impracticable age of eighteen, proposed by Ashley, 
to the age of thirteen. He supported a bill against

work on Sundays.” 

On the occasion of his first speech while defend¬ 
ing the West India planters ^(his own father's agents 
in particular ) ^from the charges of cruelty,he con¬ 
fessed that cases of cruelty had existed, and would 
always exist, under a system of slavery, and that 
this was a "substantial reason why the British leg¬ 
islature and public should set themselves in good 
earnest to provide for its extinction*” In this he 
goes ahead of his leader, for Peel in 1833 would 
have nothing to do with emancipation, either gradual 
or immediate. 

The next year, notable for its changes of ministry, 
brought the passing of the new 'Poor Law'. Concerning 
this great and needed reform Gladstone says "The 
government and Lord Althorp did themselves high 
honour". By this act the English peasantry was res¬ 
cued from the total loss of their independence. This 
year , the reins of power passing from Melbourne to 
Wellington, and a month later from Wellington to Peel, 
brings to Gladstone his first office in Peel's govern¬ 


ment .

The appointment of such a young man to the 
treasury on his own account and not on his father's 
was an innovation, justified only by the great 
promise of the one appointed. There was, of course, 
the needed appeal to his constituents at Newark to 
confirm his appointment. In asking re-election, 
Gladstone claimed that the new government was the 
real reforming government, pointing to the commer¬ 
cial changes in Liverpool's time, the Test and 
Corporation Acts, Catholic Emancipation, the practical 
reforms of Peel and the retrenchments of Wellington. 
Shortly after his re-election he was transferred to 
the Under-Secretaryship of the Colonies. The 
government was not strong enough to remain in office 
for long, and in April, 1835, Melbourne was again 
in the position of Prime Minister- to continue 
there till September.1841. 

These six years of opposition gave the Conservative 

leaders opportunity to recognize and test the abilities 
of their young recruit. Before half the period 

had elapsed he had a definite place in the front

rank of debaters , The promise of his performances 
at the Oxford Union was being fulfilled. 

Rad Gladstone passed away at the end of this first 
period of public life, men would have said of him 
that his career was the exact product of his talents 
and circumstances. Of the possibility of any other 
force or forces silently working to lead him to 
points of view and courses of action so greatly 
opposed to what men of that time considered to be 
his principles, no hint had, as yet, been given. 

Reference has already been made to the religion that 
permeated all his activities. It is scarcely possible 
to separate his religious activities from those 
usually considered secular. Indeed, such a separation 
would, of necessity, give an incorrect representa¬ 
tion of the man, because his religion was the main¬ 
spring of his whole life. While his whole life 
thus moved in accordance with his religion, it is 
not strange that we find him intensely devoted to 
the interests of his Church. This devotion leads 
him now to publish his first book. This book.

forgotten now, is interesting only because of the 
picture it gives us of the author’s mind, knowing 
as we do that he came to see the limitations of 
the principles expounded and that he had courage 
to pass legislation directly opposed to thohe prin¬ 
ciples . 

hr. Chalmers had been brought to London to lecture 
on and vindicate Church Establishment. But the 
principles propounded did not meet with the approval 
of Gladstone: he speaks of them as a ”jumble of 
church, unchurch, and anti-church principles” and 
seizes the occasion to defend the Establishment 
more systematically. The result was "The State in 
its relations with the Ghurch ,! . This appeared in 
the latter part of 1838. 

The publication of a second edition brought 
forth a criticism by Macaulay, and thus gives to 
us a contemporary*s view of the young author. He 
speaks of him as "the rising hope of those stern 
and unbending Tories who follow, reluctantly and 

mutinously, pleader whose experience and eloquence 
are indispensable to them, but whose cautious temper

&nd moderate opinions they abhor. It would not be at 
all strange if Mr. Gladstone were one of the most 
unpopular men in England. But we believe that we do 
him no more than justice when we say that his 
abilities and his demeanour have obtained for him 
the respect and good will of all parties.” 

In 1841, Gladstone’s real work in legislation 
may be said to have begun. Peel's appointment of 
him to the Vice-Presidency of the Board of Trade 
was perhaps no more than an act of political 
expediency. In the leader's mind a place must be 
found for him, and this place was the only one to 
which objection could not be made. Gladstone's 
ambition may have led him to think he was deserving 
of a less subordinate position. He speaks of being 
"set to govern packages”. Nevertheless the appoint-* 
ment had far-reaching consequences. Having accepted 
the position, Gladstone set himself conscientiously 
to work to perform the duties of his office. 

He soon comes to the conclusion that his superior, 
The President of the Board of Trade had but little 

knowledge of the department : the members of the

permanent staff,also, were able to give him but 
little assistance in mastering the details of the 
work to be undertaken. The question of the corn 
duties, raised by the preceding government, had to be 
studied. The report, in 1840, of the committee 
on import duties made necessary a revision of the 
tariff, and this involved an enormous amount of 
work. To one who hitherto knew nothing of trade, 
a man of schools and books, the task was huge. In 
accomplishing it, Gladstone did not spare himself. 

He received deputation after deputation of merchants 
ana manufacturers, importers and exporters, brokers 
and bankers : he familiarised himself with all 
the intricacies of the despised "packages" : he 
mef workmen and by close questioning learned 
the nature of their various occupations and how 
they would be affected by any tariff change.He was 
perhaps the first man in his office who really 
devoted himself to the business of government. 

It is necessary to draw attention to the fact 
that, while his later achievements in legislation

had much to do with the matters of finance, yet it 
was merely the political circumstances of 1841 
that enabled him to lay the foundations of those 
achievements. Had he had his own choice, he would 
have preferred to govern men. ?or trade he had no 
natural aptitude and no liking* Yet in this office 
he learnt that, in order to govern men wisely, close 
account must be taken of their material circumstances 
The revision of the tariff and the consequent light¬ 
ening of the burdens borne chiefly by the middle 
and lower classes, led him, perhaps at first insens ib 
ly, to free trade. The gradual increase of the volume 
of trade, resulting from lowered dutied, tended to 
confirm that leading. 

In 184?, a vacancy occurring, he is taken into 
the Cabinet,but in 1845 he retires. This retirement 
was caused by what some have considered to be an 
excess of scrupulosity. The government proposed a 

grant to Maynooth College. Gladstone favored it,but 
he remembered the principles for which he had strong¬ 
ly contended in his first book. In order that the

Cabinet might not be charged with inconsistency, 
he resigned. Late in the same year he again became a 
member of the government, as Colonial Secretary. 

In 1846, the potato famine in Ireland,bringing 
about as it did, the immediate repeal of the Corn 
Laws, completed the work begun at the Board of Trade 
in 1841. Gladstone was henceforth a free trader. 
During the administration of Lord John Russell, 
while not a supporter of the Liberals, but a leader 
among the Peelites,he becomes convinced that free 
trade is an accomplished fact and should no longer 
be considered as a question in party politics. 

An opportunity came in 1853 to advance still 
further the principles of Reform. There were remain¬ 
ing certain duties and taxes considered burdensome. 
Gladstone, now Chancellor of the Exchequer, under¬ 
took to lighten or remove these. The duty on paper, 
the tax on advertisements and the stamp duty com¬ 
bined to make newspapers costly. What is to-day the 
redding matter of even the poorest class was then 
only the luxury of the rich. While Gladstone was

not able to remove these paper duties all at once,a 
beginning was made, and some years later, he had the 
satisfaction of abolishing these "taxes on knowledge” 
In 1853, he began also that task of regulating the 
income-tax, a task // which he said he would not 
call herculean, because Hercules could not have ~ 
accomplished it. He increased the revenue at this 
time by a change in the succession duties. In all 
these matters he met with considerable opposition 
from the House of Lords, his first experience of 
what was so frequently to occur in the forty years 
still to follow. 

In spite of the fact that, while in office, 
Gladstone had really been carrying out Reform or 
Liberal policy, he was not, until the year 1859, 
directly connected with the Liberal party. The fact 
was that, for thirteen years after the Repeal of the 
Corn Laws,there existed much confusion as to party 
politics in England. The Peelites formed not only 
a third party, distinct from Whigs or Tories, but 
there were considered to be no less than four

different shades of Feelites. The Coalition Ministry 
of Aberdeen was followed by the Coalition formed by 
Palmerston. The Conservative period of rule, with 
Derby and Disraeli as leaders, lasted but a few 
monthe more than a year. Then followed, in 1859, 
a Liberal government headed by Palmerston. 

At this point Gladstone, becoming Chancellor of 
the Exchequer, definitely joins the Liberal party. 
During the preceding years of confusion, there had 
been occasions when it was hoped that he would re¬ 
turn to his early allegiance. More than once pro¬ 
posals looking in that direction had been made, but 
the hoped for "return of the prodigal" did not take 
place. His acceptance, under Derby, of a mission to 
the Ionian Islands proved that there was no real 
obstacle to that return. The effect of the mission 
on his own mind probably tended in the opposite 
direction. His progress in Liberal doctrines must 
have been quickened by the work that fell to him 
while High Commissioner. 

Of his own place among Liberals, Gladstone him-

"Conviction, in spite of early associations and 
long-cherished prepossessions - strong conviction, 
and an overpowering sense of the public interests 
operating for many, many years before full effect 
was given to it, placed me in the ranks of the 
Liberal party* 4 . 

Yet his union with the Liberals in this govern¬ 
ment is only another instance where he decided the 
case irrespective of party. He had voted to keep 
Lord Derby in, and the“man in the street” was 
scandalized at his immediately taking office under 
Derby*s successor. Even some of his own friends 
could not understand his acceptance of a portfolio 
from a man against whom he had so often spoken. In 
a letter to a friend he defended his own action. 

The necessity of carrying on the queen's government, 
which had been so strong an argument with the Great 
Duke in earlier years weighed with him. "At a moment, 
when war is raging in Europe, when the English 
government is the only instrument through which there 
is any hope, humanly speaking, of any safe and early

settlement- I have joined the only ad-” 

ministration that could be formed, in concert with 
all the friends ( setting aside those whom age ex¬ 
cludes ) with whom I joined and acted in the govern¬ 
ment of Lord Aberdeen**. Ee also considered that the 
question of reform, raised by the Derby government, 
should be settled. By dissolution, the latter had 
lost all chance of doing this. 

Korley points out that this action on Gladstone’s 
part meant merely a change of name - not a conversion, 
Palmerston’s and Derby's principles were nearly iden¬ 
tical . Hence his adherence to one did not mean a 
violent change in leaving the other. To quote from 
his biography : "Mr ♦ Gladstone was at this time in 
his politics a liberal reformer of Turgot's type, a 
born lover of good government, of just practical 
laws, of wise improvement, of public business well 

handled, of a state that should emancipate and serve 
the individual.** But while he did no violence to 

his principles, the change of name left him free to 
advance boldly upon the path of Reform.

as Chancellor once more we find Gladstone again 
reducing the number of articles liable to customs 
duties - completing the work begun in 184*?. When the 
first revision of the tariff was undertaken, the 
number stood at 105P, in 185? it was 466, while in 
1860 it was reduced to 48, of which only 15 were of 
importance. 

The budget speech of 1860, lasting for four hours 
was a notable triumph for Gladstone* His proposal to 
remove the excise duty on paper brought opposition* 
This opposition came first from Palmerston, who, in 
a Cabinet meeting, spoke for three-quarters of an 
hour against the Paper Duties Bill. The majority of 
the Cabinet, however, favored it, but the bill was 
rejected that year by the Lords. This opposition 
produced, on the part of Gla dstone an elaborate 
memorandum to the Cabinet on the paper duty and the 
taxing powers of the two Houses* He declared that 
he could never acquiesce in the pretensions of the 
other House. He ended by saying that : "The fiscal 
consideration is nothing compared with the vital 
importance of maintaining the exclusive rights of

the House of Commons in matter of supply. There is 
hardly any conceivable interference of the Lords 
hereafter, except sending down a tax imposed by 
themselves, which would not be covered by this 
precedent. It may be said they are wise and will not 
do it. Assuming that they will be wise yet I for one 
am not willing that the House of Commons should 
hold on sufferance in the nineteenth century what 
it won in the seventeenth and confirmed and en¬ 
larged in the eighteenth.” 

The paper duties were finally removed by including 
the various financial proposals in a single bill. 

Thus the House of Commons affirmed its inviolable 
right to remit and impose taxes and to frame bills 
of supply. 

It was during this administration that Gladstone’s 
powers as a financier received deserved recognition. 
His untiring efforts to lighten the burden of the 
taxpayer, and his determination to resist all un¬ 
necessary expenditure called forth these words from 

Mr.Bright : "There is not a man who labours and 
sweats for his daily bread, there is not a woman

living in a cottage who strives to make her home 
happy for husband and children, to whom the words 
of the Chancellor of the Exchequer have not brought 
hope, and to whom his measures, which have been 
defended with an eloquence few van equal and with 
a logic none can contest, have not administered 
consolation. ** 

It is noteworthy that this administration sees 
the beginning of Gladstone’s relations with the 
Nonconformists, ns late as 1861 we find him opposing 
the bill to abolish Church rates. He must, however, 
have been slowly moving to a higher pane of action, 
and a broader ground of sympathy with those who 
differed from him ecclesiastically, for during the 
next ten years he reverses his vote as to the rates, 
and even introduces and carries a bill for their 
abolition. He also changes similarly in regard to 
tests at the Universities. In 1870 all lay degrees 
are thrown open to dissenters. 

a generation had elapsed since the passing of 
the Reform Eill of 1832. Great as that had been it

was yet incomplete and an advance had been demanded. 
Successive governments had played with the idea of a 
new Reform Bill, but nothing had been accomplished. 
Lord John Russell, the father of the first bill,was 
now prime Minister. His chief lieutenabt, Gladstone, 
having waited in vain for the opponents of Derby's 
Reform measure, to make proposals of their own, 
determined to bring about an extension of the fran¬ 
chise. j\ government bill, introduced about that time, 
for the redistribution of seats, gave opportunity to 
the opposition to complicate matters and Gladstone's 
Reform Bill was defeated. With the defeat of the 
measure came also the degeat of the government. 

The Derby-Disraeli ministry that succeeded found 
themselves under the necessity of passing a Reform 
Bill. Disraeli's proposals, some of which were 
nicknamed 'fancy franchises', suffered considerable 
change in the committee stage, mainly at the 
dictation of Gladstone and Bright. In the end the 
measure that was passed did not differ g rea tly from 

Gladstone's. It enfranchised all male household¬ 
ers rated for the relief of the poor, and

less than ten pounds a year tent : and in counties, 
persons of property of the clear annual value of 
five pounds, and occupiers of lands or tenements 
paying twelve pounds a year.** 

In 1834, in a speech at Newark Gladstone had said 
“Protestant faith is held good for us, and what is 
good for us is also good for the population of 
Ireland**. In this statement lies the keynote of all 
the misrule of Ireland by English legislators. From 
the time of the Union they had sought to impose 
on the Irish people, English laws, English customs 
and English faith. No account had been taken of 
differences arising from race, creed or material 
circumstances, and no attempt had been made to 
mitigate the fierce hatred engendered by cruel 
oppression lasting from the time of Cromwell. Before 
the close of the eighteenth century. Fox had said, 

"I would have the Irish Government regulated by 
Irish notions and Irish prejudices**, but seventy 
years had elapsed ere any statesman of the fore-

most rank had arisen brave enough to undertake the 
the difficult cure of Irish woes. 

Thirty-four years of close association with the 
problems of wise legislation had led Gladstone to 
see that his words at Newark were but the reflection 
by a young man of the sentiments in common vogue. 

In 1868 he assumed for the first time the office 
of First Lord of the Treasury. He had reached the 
age of fifty-nine. He had passed a generation in 
public service. His accomplishments as Chancellor 
of the Exchequer were unsurpassed. Had he chosen to 
consider all or any of these reasons good and 
sufficient to prevent him undertaking any new work, 
he could not have been blamed. Unconscious, however, 
that his greatest achievenebts still lie before him, 
he assumed the burden of ’pacifying Ireland*. 

According to his view, there were at that time 
three great evils existing to disturb the Irish 
people.. These evils consisted in the Church Estab¬ 
lishment, the System of Land Tenure, and the condition 
of the Irish Universities.

agriculture, the Irish were particularly interested 
the first and second of 

in the removal o£ these evils. The payment of tithes 
for the support of a Protestant Church when the 
great majority of the people consisted of Roman 
Catholics would have lost none of its injustice even 
had the people been well able to pay. When such a 
payment was required from those whose condition was 
that of extreme poverty, positive injury was added 
to injustice. 

Church Disestablishment was therefore to bring 
direct relief to the poorest Irishman. Needless to 
say, the proposal was met by opposition, English 
clergymen denounced the bill as ’highly offensive 
to almighty God* and *the greatest national sin ever 
committed*. Theit attacks were no doubt embittered 
because they had so long considered Gladstone the 
champion of the Established Church and of union be¬ 
tween Church and State. In the end the House of Lords 
gave way after a conference, by which much better 
terms were secured for the new Irish Church.

In the following year the second evil was attacked. 
Gave in Ulster, the common system of land tenure was 
tenancy at will, terminable at six months' notice. 
f\ tenant who was able to make improvements ( the land¬ 
lord made none ), was rewarded by having his rent 
raised. The logical outcome of this, according to 
the report of a government commission, was crime and 
disorder. If, as often happened, eviction followed 
refusal or inability to pay increased rent, there 
was no compensation to a tenant for any improvements 
he may have made. The Land Bill was a courageous 
attempt to remedy this injustice, and the Conservatives 
did not strongly oppose it. The Ulster tenant-right 
was made a legal institution for the whole of Ireland. 

It was not until 1873 that Gladstone was able to 
undertake legislation regarding Irish Universities 
and his proposed changes did not meet with the 
approval of either Roman Catholics or Tories. Their 
combined opposition led to the rejection of his 
bill and also to the defeat of the Liberals. Before 
this came to pass it had been shown that the other 
Irish legislation, righteous as it was , was not

sufficient to rid the country of the outrages of 
Fenianism. In 1870 resort had to be made to another 
Coercion Act. 

Irish legislation was not the only great work at~ 
tempted by the first Gladstone Ministry, Equal in 
importance was the establishment of a system of 
National Education, In the opinion of the writer 
it must ever be a matter for regret that the planning 
of this system was undertaken by any one save the 
Chief Minister. While he recognized the necessity 
of a National System, he was at that time too much 
•obsessed 9 ,as his biographer calls it, by Irish 
affairs, to give to Education the thought and tine 
such a measure of importance demanded. Had he really 
studied the need, had he gone into the details of 
the various organizations then existing, had he 
effected a separation in his own mind between 
religion and education, we cannot but believe that 
he would have had the courage to propose a system 
of free education broad enough to meet the needs of 
all classes and creeds.

his own convictions sTnd gave loyal support to his 
colleagues. His own comment on the outlines given 
by Forster appear in a letter to Lord de Grey: 

"Why not adopt frankly the principle that the 
State or the local community should provide the 
secular teaching, and either leave the option to 
the ratepayers to go beyond the sine qua non, if 
they think fit, within the limits of the conscience 
clause, or else simply leave the parties themselves 
to find Bible and other religious education from 
voluntary sources ?" 

Had no schools existed previously the question 
might have been settled simply ; but already a large 
number of voluntary schools were in operation. De¬ 
nominational schools of various kinds were re¬ 
ceiving government aid. The private funds employed 
in the establishment or endowment of these had to 
be respected, so that the government could neither 
close these schools nor take them over as public 
property. The matter was further complicated by the 
necessity of compelling parents to send their

Considering all these difficulties, there can be 
little doubt that Gladstone alone,in the government, 
had the ability to settle the question upon the 
high ground of statesmanship instead of the lower 
one of compromise. There would not then have been 
the retrograde Act of 1902, which now, for nearly 
ten years has been resisted by the Nonconformists 
of England. Compromise though it was, the system 
was vastly better than none, though Bright char¬ 
acterized the Act as "the worst Act passed by any 
Liberal parliament since 1852“. 

Two other measures of reform mark this first 
period of Gladstone’s leadership. Army reform as 
indicated by the abolition of the purchase of com¬ 
missions. This, resisted by the Lords, was attained 
by the cancelling of the previous royal warrant, 
under which the purchase had been made possible, 
and the issuing of a new warrant abolishing pur¬ 
chase. The Lords also opposed the introduction of 
the ballot. This measure came up again the next

year, 1872, and was then passed. This reform, long 
advocated, perhaps did not realize all the expecta¬ 
tions of its promoters, but it brought relief at 
least to the Irish voter. He could now vote with¬ 
out being intimidated by his landlord. 

Despite the "days 'work of a giant” accomplished 
by this administration in bringing about these 
needed reforms, there was considerable disaffection 
in Liberal ranks. One great source of this was the 
alienation of the Nonconformists by the provisions 
of the Education Act. This, combined with other 
influences, especially what Gladstone himself 
called "a torrent of gin and beer”, brought about 
the defeat of Liberals in the elections that took 
place eafcly in 1874. The Liberal leader now wished 
to resign and he practically retired for a time 
from the leadership of his party. No one could then 
foresee that there were twenty years more of public 
life for him and that on three different occasions 
he would be entrusted with the task of forming a 
government .

periods of power, we would mention only : The Irish 
Land Bill of 1881 ; The Franchise Bill of 1884 -and 
the two attempts, in 1886 and 1893, to give Home 
Rule to Ireland. 

The first of these was really the completion of 
the Land Bill of eleven years previous. According 
to the author of the measure it was to fcedress 
grievances due, not to the iniquity of the land¬ 
lords, but to "land-hunger” and bad seasons. The 
previous legislation had not brought relief enough 
to overcome the effect of poor years. The most 
important clauses provided for the establishment 
of a "judicial rent" to be fixed for fifteen years ; 
in cases where the tenant wished to become the 
owner, he was enabled to borrow three-fourths of 
the required amount from the government at 

a low rate of interest. 

The Franchise Act of 1884, adding, as it did, 
2,000,000 voters to the lists in the United King¬ 
dom, provoked, as usual, the opposition of the Lords. 
This was oversome in an autumn session after Glad¬ 
stone had, by a series of speeches, transferred

the discussion from the Parliament to the country. 
While he had an excellent opportunity to rouse the 
animosity of the people against the hereditary 
Chamber, yet his speeches were distinguished by 
moderation, appealing to the reason rather than to 
the fears of his hearers* He pointed significantly 
to the fact that out of twelve parliaments elected 
since the Reform Bill of 1832, ten were Liberal. Of 
the other two, only one was Tory from beginning to 
end. The House of Lords was in sympathy with that 
one parliament, and in opposition to the ten par¬ 
liaments. Yet it claimed that the Tory parliament 
represented the solid and permanent opinion of the 
country. 

With the various influences and occurrences, many 
of them minor, leading up to the two attempts to 
give Home Rule to Ireland, this paper can not deal. 
It need only be said that Gladstone had become con¬ 
vinced that mile by repression in Ireland had had 
sufficiently long trial to show its ineffectiveness. 

Wha tever could be done from the outside in the 
way of remedial legislation had been done. There

still remained disorder and disaffection. In spite 
of the opposition he knew he would encounter,he was 
still willing to risk his position in the attempt 


to bring about the only method still untried, 
by the House of Lords 

The rejection^in 1893 of the second Home Rule 
Bill, together with their opposition to another 
measure, the Parish Councils Bill, in 1894, closed 
Gladstone's long struggle with the Upper Chamber. 

In his closing speech in the House of Commons his 
words concerning the Lords are a very fair prophecy 
of the struggle that was to continue at intervals 
for more than fifteen years, and that now, at the 
present moment, occupies the foremost position in 
English politics. 

All mention of Gladstone's connection with foreign 

but 

affairs has necessarily been omitted, his sympathy 


with various States struggling for constitutional 
freedom, notably the Italian States, should be 
spoken of in order to show the broadening and 
deepening of his interest in political freedom. 

Even at the very close of his life he wasready to

spend his energies in rousing England on behalf of 
the oppressed Armenians. 

In domestic legislation we have seen how,almost 
from the very first of his career, he was engaged 
in promoting measures of reform, as soon as he had 
reached the point in his life where he was able to rise 
above the great influences of his early training and 
teaching, and to think independently of tradition; 
as soon as his native love of truth, honesty, and 
justice could declare itself ; just so soon did he 
range himself on the side of beneficial and con¬ 
structive as opposed to repressive and burdensome 
legislation. He came on the scene of English 
History at the point when the genius of Anglo- 
Saxon constitution, recovering from the serious 
check given by the Erench Revolution to the advance 
of reform ideas, began anew the development of those 
principles of self-government which are its peculiar 
distinction. His long life was largely an expression 

of that development, whilst his marvellous powers 
as a thinker and speaker, his purity of purpose, and
