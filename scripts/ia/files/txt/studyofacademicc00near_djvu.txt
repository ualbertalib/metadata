ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 


The writer wishes to express his appreciation to Dr. 

H. T. Sparby, Dr. G. L. Mowat and Dr. T. C. Byrne for their 
helpful advice and constructive criticism during the develop*^ 
ment of the thesis. His thanks are also given to the 
principals of the various composite high schools and the 
staff of the Examinations Branch of the Department of 
Education for their kind assistance while the data for the 
study were being collected. 





SYNOPSIS 


Th© high schools of Alberta, formerly geared to provide 
preparation for university-bound students only, are now looked 
upon as institutions designed to meet the needs of all students. 
Students who do not have th© interest or ability to complete 
a matriculation program successfully are now encouraged to 
stay, whereas in past years they would have been encouraged 
to leave hi^ school. Th© Composite High School has been 
designed to serve this philosophy of secondary education, 
and many new courses have been introduced into the hi^ school 
curriculum to implement this concept. Thus, a new ”typ©” of 
student now attends high school, one who does not have the 
ability to matriculate* These^ students are the non-academ- 
ically-gifted in our high schools, and are the subjects of 
this study* 

This study defines the non-academically^kglfted student 
as one who has an IQ of 100 or less. Pour hundred and fifty- 
two of these students were selected from five Alberta Compos¬ 
ite High Schools. Their academic careers were examined to 
attempt to determine the extent to which they are taking 
advantage of these new opportunities provided for them to 
obtain a high school education. The data were obtained from 
the record cards of the selected high schools, and all 
matters considered pertinent to their academic careers were

gathered - attendance, credits earned, marks in each course, 

etc* 

It was found that over 2 ^% of the students enrolled 
in Grade X could be described as non-academically-glfted* 

In spite of its undesirability as far as these students were 
concerned, the vast majority selected the matriculation pro¬ 
gram (In fact, only twelve matriculated successfully). Drop¬ 
outs were very hi^, over 73^ dropping out before the end of 
Grade XII* In actual subjects studied, it was noted that 
these students earned better grades in non-academic, rather 
than academic courses* 

Summing up, the writer felt Justified in concluding 
that if the composite high school is to meet the needs of all 
students, many changes may be necessary* In view of the 
findings of this study, it appears that few students of low 
ability in composite high schools are making best use of the 
opportunities available to them for furthering their education*

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM 

Within i^ecent years the high schools of the Province 
of Alberta have experienced an unprecedented growth. Evi¬ 
dence obtained from the Annual Reports of the Department of 
Education^ discloses that Alberta’s high school population 
has tripled since 1927o Further, the percentage of students 
in attendance at hi^ school in 192? was 11*4^ of the total 
school population; in 1957 this proportion was 19*8^, Thus, 
though the increase in the population of the province may 
have contributed to much of the increase in actual numbers 
attending high school, it is clear that, proportionately, 
nearly twice as many students attended Alberta’s high 
schools in 1957> as did in 1927* 

Traditionally, the high school has been regarded as 
an institution preparing students to enter university. In 
recent years, however, the concept of the function of the 
high school has been broadened to include service to all 
students. The educational ideal is now universal secondary 
education, and, in order to meet the needs of all students, 
the high school c\irricul\im has been expanded,, New subjects 
have been introduced, such as Automotives and Industrial Arts, 
to help meet these needs, thus encouraging more students, 
including those who do not plan to attend university, to stay

in school* Various studies^ have shown that most students 
leave school because of a lack of Interest, and a curriculum 
unsuited to their needs* These new courses constitute an 
attempt to meet these needs and interests to curb the alarm¬ 
ing drop-out situation. 

The traditional curriculum of the high school has not 
been discarded, because the higih school must still perform 
its function of preparing students to enter university. 
However, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the curriculum 
has been expanded* This expansion has made it possible for 
an entirely different type of student to enter high school* 
Those students who are not interested in attending university, 
and also those who cannot attend university because of an 
inability to meet matriculation requirements, are encouraged 
to attend high school as long as they can profit thereby* 

This new educational philosophy has been implemented 
during approximately the past ten years* Evidence of the 
change in the philosophy underlying secondary schools in 
Alberta is readily available* T* C* Byrne, Chief Superin¬ 
tendent of Schools for the Province of Alberta, points out: 

With one or two exceptions, no special purpose high 
schools exist in Alberta* We have no commercial nor 
technical high schools, and few, if any, strictly academ¬ 
ic or college preparatory centres ...**....Our high 
schools all aim, as if driven by inner compulsions, at 
comprehensiveness in program in so far as enrolment, 
accommodation and equipment will permit. Guided by these 
limitations, they seek to expand their services within the 
scope of the total high school program.3

Th© purpose of this study is to attempt to determine 
how successful this new concept of secondary education has 
been in practice* To what extent are those students, who are 
not able to attain matriculation standing, taking advantage 
of these opportunities to further their education? Are they 
actually coming to school? In which programs of study do 
they enroll? What subjects do they choose? Hovx many complete 
high school successfully? The answers to these and related 
questions were sought in the hope that further progress may 
be possible towards the goal of universal secondary education* 
These students who are not able to attain matriculation 
standing are the non-academically-gifted in our high schools* 
Cne of the best measures of academic ability available is the 
Intelligence Quotient, or IQ, Students with an IQ of 100 or 
less were selected as not having the ability to matriculate, 
and are the subjects of this study. 

Limitations of this Study 

Th© selection of IQ 100 as the lower limit of ability 
necessary to matriculate could not be completely justified, 
though some evidence was available that provided objectivity 
for this selection, A study conducted by Dr, Byrne^ in 1954?- 
found that "only about 280 out of every 1,000 students 
enrolled in Grade IX obtain a High School Diploma; and only 
about 54 of these have an IQ (Henmon-Nelson) of 105 or less".

This study appeared to indicate that few, if any, with an IQ 
of 100 or less had matriculated successfully* 

Dr* A* J* Cook, Director of Student Advisory Services, 
University of Alberta, was consulted regarding the niimber of 
students entering the University of Alberta with an IQ of 100 
or less* It was found that on the basis of results from the 
Wechsler-Bellevue test administered at the university, no 
students within this range had been enrolled in a degree 
program* Again, it appeared that few students with this IQ 
matriculate successfully* 

The Alberta Matriculation Study Sub-Committee ReportS 

quotes Dr* J* A* B* McLeish, writing in Saturday Night (Sept, 

15> 1956) on the topic **Who Should Go To College?” as follows: 

If it is true that roughly a quarter of our school 
population has at least the IQ level of 110, and if «*•«• 
as in Ontario *♦•• only 3 per cent of the youngsters ent¬ 
ering elementary school ultimately graduate from university, 
then it would seem that we are failing to educate a large 
number of ”firat class” young people at the summit end of 
education ***.5 

It appears that Dr* McLeish regards IQ 110 as necessary to 
enter university, and his opinion seems to have the tacit 
approval of the Alberta Matriculation Study Sub-Committee* 

Finally, several experienced Alberta high school teach¬ 
ers were asked what IQ they had found necessary, in general, 
for a student to matriculate successfully* Without exception, 
they replied ”about IQ 110”* 

Thus, while the selection of IQ 100 as the lower limit

of ability for successful matriculation was partly arbitrary, 
the evidence indicated that there was considerable justificat¬ 
ion for selecting this score. 

Another limitation of this study should also be noted 
at this time. Eleven different IQ tests had been used to 
measure the intelligence of the students. The Otis was most 
widely used, though many Henmon-Nelson test scores were also 
noted. The most recently recorded IQ score was the basis for 
selecting the students for this study. 

The data presented in this study must be interpreted 
in the light of these limitations to avoid drawing conclus¬ 
ions that may be invalid or unreliable.

CHAPTER II 


RELATED LITERATURE AND RESEARCH 

Literature on the non-academlcally gifted in our school 
can be found in practically every professional publication for 
educators. These students are the subjects of speeches, of 
panel discussions and symposia of every form. Typical of the 
literature on the topic are periodical articles largely 
philosophical in nature, the gist of which are revealed in 
their titles: "A Defence of the Less-Gifted”;^ ”Our School 
D. P.*s: >Jhy the Non-Academic Program Pails”;etc. Refer¬ 
ences by speakers to ”universal secondary education”, the 
education of ”everyman*s child”, ”meeting the needs of all 
students”, are heard frequently, all stressing the need to 
educate these students. As noted previously, the high school 
cixrriculum has been expanded to meet the needs of the non- 
academic students. However, little or no research has been 
done to find out if the needs of these students are actually 
being met by this curriculum expansion. 

Research on gifted students has reached astounding 
proportions. Monroe^ comments, ”The gifted child has been the 
basis of numerous studies, several of which may appropriately 
be referred to an monumental.” The identification and 
characteristics of the gifted, and the adaptation of the 
school to their needs, are all subjects which have been

treated extensively. The 1950 edition of the Encyclopedia 
of Educational Research lists seventy-nine studies of the 
gifted. 

Students of low ability have also been the subjects of 
a great deal of research by educators* Monroe^ lists over 
sixty titles on the slow, the retarded and the mentally de¬ 
fective, as the non-academically gifted is variously known. 

Thus, the non-academically gifted, as defined in this 
study, cannot be included in either of the groups studied 
in the research discussed in the preceding paragraphs; for 
gifted students are those with an IQ of I30 (or thereabouts, 
depending on the study), and retarded students are those 
with an IQ of 85 or less, and only a handful of the select¬ 
ed students fall into this latter category. It would appear 
then, that these selected students are "average” students, 
for the research on extremes in IQ does not deal with them. 
However, this average group is really two groups, those who 
have the ability to matriculate and those who have not. At 
this point, the problem is further complicated by the lack 
of Canadian educational research. Most educational research 
has been done in the United States, and American research on 
college entrance or matriculation is of little value for a 
study being made in Canada. This is due to the fact that 
colleges in the United States vary so widely in their ad¬ 
mission requirements that "any high school graduate can

succeed In obtaining a degree by attending a college adapted 
to his ability level,Several studies have been made in 
Canada on the problem of matriculation, yet there appears to 
be no research on those students in our high schools who do 
not have the ability to matriculate. 

It seems to this writer that educational literature 
is too glib on the topic of the non-academically gifted. 
Ignored by research, yet raised to the heights by our phil¬ 
osophy of education, the question is raised as to how these 
students are treated in actual practice. This writer hopes 
that his small effort will make some contribution to the 
meagre supply of literature available on this important topic*

CHAPTI'iR III 


THE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

The organization of Alberta high Schools is varied. 

High schools in the province range from single-teacher 
schools to sixty-teacher schools, and enrolments vary from 
fifteen pupils to fourteen hundred pupils, respectively. 

The nine largest schools in the province are the composite 
high schools, so called because they offer a complete range 
of high school courses, including matriculation, commercial, 
technical, vocational and general patterns. The composite 
organization is, in reality, an organization to implement 
the philosophy underlying high school education in the Prov- ' 
ince of Alberta. 

Five Alberta Composite High Schools were selected for 
this study. These five schools were basically similar, in that 
all offered the same four programs or routes through high 
school; however, certain differences were noted, though these 
differences were of degree rather than kind. For example, 
students attending different schools could choose different 
electives, yet still be considered on the same program of 
study, their elective choices depending on local offerings 
and local employment opportunities. Thus, in schools in a 
rural environment, agriculture is an elective chosen by many 
students; in urban areas, courses in agriculture may not even 




12 


be offered; however, the students in both cases may be class¬ 
ified as general or technical program students* 

School A is the largest high school in Alberta, and 
has the most extensive program* There are three other 
composite high schools in the city in which it is located, 
but their facilities are more limited, especially in shop 
and commercial electives* As a result, many students who 
reside in another part of the city, but who wish to take these 
special options, attend this school* Consequently, more 
students whose interests are non-academic attend this school 
than would be the case if all schools could offer the same 
courses* The effect of this is noted very early in the 
study and should be kept in mind when the findings of this 
study are being considered* 

School B is slightly smaller than School A* Only two 
of the high schools in the city in which it is located are 
classified as composite, and, as a result, non-academic 
students are probably attracted to this school from other 
parts of the city because of the more varied programs offer¬ 
ed. This was the first school in the province to be consid¬ 
ered a composite high school. 

School C is considerably smaller than the two preceding 
schools* The great majority of the students are from the city 
in which it is situated, though a small number come from 
outlying districts.

School D serves mainly city students, but many students 
are transported to this school from considerable distances, 
many from strictly rural areas, A unique feature of this 
school is its operation on a semester system. The school 
year is divided into three semesters, September to December, 
December to March, and March to June. This school is about 
the same size as School C. 

School E is located in a small city, though it also 
serves outlying areas like School C, but unlike School D, the 
majority of its students are urban dwellers. It is approx¬ 
imately the same size as Schools C and D. 

These comments on the various composite schools which 
were used in this study should be kept in mind when the data 
presented are being considered. The study may, at times, 
present data from which, it appears, conclusions may be dravm* 
However, this data may well be affected by the composition of 
the student population or the organization of the particular 
school being considered, rendering any conclusions drawn 
unreliable, if not actually invalid. 

The writer visited these five schools personally, 
and collected the data for this study from the permanent 
record cards in the school files, and/or the cumulative 
record cards of individual students in the guidance depart¬ 
ment in the school. The following information was taken from 
these records:

In several instances the IQ of the student was not 
recorded in the school records. The files of the 
Department of Education'were then consulted, and if 
the IQ was available there, this test score was 
treated as being the most recent. 

The academic history of the selected students was 
studied from several points of view, such as attendance, sub¬ 
jects taken, credits earned, etc. As much of the derived 
information as possible was then recorded in tables and 
figures, with observations being made on each table and figure 
to clarify the data presented. Considerable difficulty was 
encountered in organizing these data, and the reader must 
note carefully the different methods which were used in 
treating the various aspects of these students’academic careers#

It was decided to study ,the performance of students 
who had enrolled in the composite high schools in 195^ - 35* 
This gave a recent group, yet one for which the data would be 
nearly complete. 



CHAPTi^R IV 


THE STUDENT PERSONNEL SELECTED 
(A) NUMBERS OP SELECTED STUDENTS 

In 1954 - in the schools under discussion, 17^9 

students were enrolled in Grade X. This total does not give 
the number of students who enrolled for the first time In 
September, 1954# ^or it also includes those who were repeat¬ 
ing Grade X, and others who entered at different times during 
the school year. The enrolments were as follows: 


School

School 

B 

522 

School 

C 

253 

School 

D 

169 

School 

E 

187 


TOTAL: 1749 

As noted previously, the record cards of these 1749 
students were exam3.ned, and the IQ,*s recorded thereon were 
noted, if 100 or below. 452 were in this category, or 
of the total of 1749® On a per school basis, the figures 
were as follows:

Observations of Figure I ; 

(1) School A, probably for reasons already indicated (see 
p. 11), had the greatest proportion of low ability 
students enrolled; nearly one out of three students 
who enrolled in Grade X, had an IQ of 100 or less, 

(2) School C had a considerably smaller proportion of low 
ability students enrolled than any of the other schools; 
actually the proportion of such students enrolled In 
this school was less than half the proportion enrolled 
in three of the other schools. 

It should be noted here that the IQ»s of all the stud¬ 
ents in the various schools were not available, and in at 
least one instance, the data obtained could have been markedly 
altered if such had been available, IQ scores were not found 
for seven students in School A, twenty-six in School B, and 
fourteen in School C; none were missing in either School D or 


School E

(B) SEK OF THE SELECTED STUDENTS 

Is the high school program of greater Interest and value 
to male or female students of lower ability? This is a quest¬ 
ion of great interest to educators. This study, of course, 
cannot be expected to provide a conclusive answer, but it should 
be able to shed some light on the matter. The selected students

sex in Table I.

Observations from Table I; 


(1) Only in School A did girls outnumber boys. This could 
well be accounted for by the fact that commercial courses, 
catering generally to girls, are offered at this school 
and not entirely at the other schools in the city, thus 
attracting students who would otherwise be attending 
other schools. 

(2) It may be noted that School E enrolled almost twice as 
many boys as girls.

dO 


(3) without supporting data on the overall school population 
according to sex, this information, while interesting in 
itself, indicated no definite trend in any of the schools, 
and conclusions must not be drawn from these figures on 
the merits of the composite high school in attracting 
either more boys or more girls of low ability. 

Figure II reproduces Table I, showing the data on a 
percentage basis.

Further discussion on this matter will be Included in, 
Chapter V, "The Drop-out Situation", where the holding power 
of the school in relation to sex is discussed. 



(C) ANALYSIS OP THE IQ OF THE SELECTED STUDENTS 
It must be remembered that an upper limit (IQ 100) was 
Imposed by the writer when the IQ of these students was being 
noted from the record cards in the individual schools# How¬ 
ever, no lower limit was set, and thus the following inform¬ 
ation gives further insight into the abilities of the students 
Involved when taken as a group. The students found to 

have an IQ of 100 or less, had a mean IQ of 93#8; the crude 
mode was 99; the median 95*2; and the Standard Deviation was 
The data for the individual schools is presented in 
Table II, permitting the overall picture to be seen more readily

and the Standard Deviation, indicating the concentrat¬ 
ion of scores around the mean, was the smallest of the 
five. 

(2) School E followed closely behind School C in almost all 
of these categories. 

(3) Schools C and E enrolled the smallest proportion of 
non-academically gifted students (see Figure I, p. 17); 
thus, when observations (1) and (2) (above) are consid¬ 
ered as well, it seems that a superior group of students, 
within the limits defined, were enrolled in these 
schools.

CHAPTER V 


ATTENDANCE 

Students of low ability must attend school regularly 
if they are to succeed. Absences, especially if prolonged 
or frequent, are very serious matters for these students. 

Poor attendance causes a falling off in school work, and the 
student*s interest in school declines. This declining 
interest frequently results in failure, and consequent dis¬ 
couragement, leading to drop-out from school^ Several 
studies of drop-outs^^ have noted that poor attendance 
records were a definite symptom of approaching drop-outs* 

In the discussion of attendance data, the records of 
the selected students were broken into three classifications, 
one for each grade. Students classified as Grade X are those 
who earned credits in Grade X, but none in Grade XI; Grade XI 
students are those who earned credits in Grade XI and also 
in Grade X, but no credits in Grade XII; and Grade XII 
students are those who earned credits in Grade XII, and also 
in Grades X and XI. It should be noted that for the Grade 
XI students there were attendance records for two years, 
the first in Grade X and the second in Grade XI. Similarly, 
attendance records for the Grade XII students included data 
for three years. The figures recorded are total days attended. 

The data for School D must be noted carefully. This

school operates on* a semester system, and hence credits could 
be earned even though only a few months of school during the 
year were actually attended. Hence, the figures from this 
school will generally be lower than those from any of the 
others, but this does not necessarily indicate that this 
schoolattendance record was any lower than the records 
in other schools.

( 1 ) The mean attendance in each school was almost the same, 
in spite of local differences in causes of absenteeism* 


( 2 ) The mean represented a loss of almost twenty days in 
each school, or about four school weeks* 

( 3 ) Because of the wide range, perhaps the median was a 
better indication of central tendency, yet in three 
schools the median was even lower than the mean.

( 3 ) These Grade XII students had a much better attendance 
record In Grade X than the Grade X students reported In 
Tables III and IV. 

(I4.) In Grade XI, this group’s attendance was considerably 

higher than that of the Grade XI class reported in Table 

rv, p. 28. 

General Observations Made from Tables of Attendance ; 

( 1 ) The great similarity among all the schools was obvious. 
No school had a considerably better or worse attendance 
record than any other. 

( 2 ) The longer the students stayed in school, the worse were 
their attendance records. This was shown when the 
figures of the Grade XI (Table IV', p. 28 ) and Grade XII 
students were considered. Thus, the Grade XI students 
had a better attendance record in Grade X than they had 
when they were in Grade XI. Similarly, the Grade XII 
students had a better attendance record in Grade X than 
they had when they were in Grade XI; their Grade XI 
record, in turn, was better than their attendance record 
in Grade XII. 

( 3 ) The Grade XII students had a better attendance record 

when they were in Grade X (Table V, p. than the 

Grade X students did (Table III, p. 27 ); also better 
than the Grade XI students had when they were in Grade X 






31 


(Table IV, p. 28 ). They also had a better record in 
Grade XI (Table V, p. 29 ), than the Grade XI students 
had when they were In Grade XI (Table IV, p. 28 ), This 
seems to indicate that these students were more interest¬ 
ed in school. It is quite possible, too, that their 
academic records reflect this additional interest. 

This matter will be discussed later in the study in 
Chapter IX, 

(ij.) Studies which hold that attendance is low in the year 
immediately preceding drop-out are borne out by this 
study.

CHAPTER VI 


PROGRAMS OF STUDY OF THE SELECTED STUD.JSfTS 

Pour programs of study are offered in the composite 
high school: matriculation, commercial, technical and general 
In processing the data which he obtained, however, the writer 
found it impossible to distinguish between general program 
and technical program students. Information concerning the 
program in which students are enrolled is not included in the 
school records, and thus, these students were classified in 
the folloX'Jing manner. Matriculation program students and 
commercial program students were easily separated, so for 
purposes of this study, any student not clearly in either of 
these categories was classed as being in the general program. 
This must be kept clearly in mind when interpreting the data. 
It is generally agreed by authorities^^ on the composite 
school that students of lower ability should choose courses 
other than the academic if the composite school is to be a 
success. However, great prestige is attached by teachers, 
parents and students alike to the academ_lc program; and even 
though this course may not be within the interests of, and 
may even be beyond their ability, it is still commonly 
selected by many non-academically gifted students. 

Many course changes were made by the selected students 
this vras especially true when they entered Grade XI, most of

the changes being from matriculation to the general program. 
Thus, the data on courses of study have considerable overlap 
resulting from these course changes and these must be kept 
in mind when interpreting Figure III. This figure shows 
the percentage of students enrolled in the various courses 
of study in Grades X, XI and XII.

Observations of Figure III ; 

( 1 ) Prom the Grade X portion: 

(a) a larger proportion of the selected students 
ohose the matriculation program than either the 

' commercial or the general. 

(b) the commercial program was chosen by the smallest 
proportion of these students, but it must be 
remembered that this program was confined gen¬ 
erally to girls. 

( 2 ) Prom the Grade XI portion: 

(a) the general program, rather than the matriculation, 
enrolled the greater proportion of the selected 
students in Grade XI. 

(b) the proportion enrolled in the commercial program 
was nearly as large as that in the matriculation. 

( 3 ) Prom the Grade XII portion: 

(a) the greatest proportion of the selected Grade XII 
students vjas enrolled in the general program, 
repeating the Grade XI pattern. 

(b) the proportion enrolled in the commercial program 
was considerably below that in matriculation. 

General Observations of the Courses of Study Chosen by the 

Selected Students : 

As noted previously, most students seemed to prefer 
the matriculation program, possibly because of the prestige 









37 


associated with it. Thus, in Grade X, most of these low 
ability students chose this program, though the general pro¬ 
gram outranked it in Grades XI and XII. This appears to 
indicate that the matriculation course was beyond the abilities 
of these students, but they preferred to attempt matriculation, 
rather than to begin a general course as soon as they entered 
high school. Dr. Byrne comments: 

It is not surprising that the general route through high 
school has little status and attracts only those students 
who are ixnable to perform in the other fields .... The 
general program leads nowhere. Other course patterns have 
outlets, or futures The general program, however, is 

like a bus without a destination - not to be boarded except 
for protection from the elemental 

Students do not choose the general route; they slide 
into it .... The prescriptive academic program is the most 
common route through high school for Alberta students. As 
the failure rate in this program is heavy the general 
route is being augmented steadily by those who cannot other** 
wise succeed.^ 

Further aetails on this topic are presented in Chapter 
VII, "The Drop-Cut Situation".

CHAPTER VII 


THE DROP-CUT SITUATION 
(A) DROP-OUTS CONSIDERED ON A GRADE BASIS 

As discussed previously in the opening chapter of this 
study, the function of secondary education in Alberta has 
changed. The curriculum of the traditional high school was 
designed to prepare students for university entrance. Student 
of low ability were encouraged to leave school; and, in any 
case, their drop-out would be hastened by probable repeated 
failures* However, the high school is no longer so select¬ 
ive in its membership, and all students are encouraged to 

I 

stay in school as long as both they and society can benefit* 
The students selected for this study were those of low 
ability who,due to this changed character of secondary 
education, are now encouraged to complete a high school 
program. The purpose of this chapter will be to determine 
the extent to which these students are remaining in school 
in order to take advantage of these opportunities to further 
their education* 

Figure IV presents the drop-cuts from each grade on a 
percentage basisp classified according to the schools attended 
by the selected students.

Observations of FlRure IV : 

(1) A large proportion of these students drop out. In the 
selected schools, none had less than a sixty per cent 
drop-out, and in one school, over seventy-five per cent 
dropped out. 

(2) A sharp decline in the proportion of drop-outs was 
noted among the selected students in Grade XII. Of 
course, one point must be kept in mind: the drop-outs 
recorded in Grades X and XI included two groups: 

(1) those who completed the year and who did not return 
for the following year; (2) those who left during the 
school term; however, the Grade XII drop-outs include 
only those who dropped out during the school term. The 
heavier drop-outs over holiday periods may be attribut¬ 
ed probably to the fact that satisfactory employment 
was found, and the student was reluctant to give up 
his new found security and income to return to school. 
When the nimbers of drop-outs during each school term 
were considered, the heaviness of the drop-out over the 
summer months was evident, for the total drop-outs in 
each grade were quite similar. These figures are 
presented in Table VI.

(B) DROP-OUTS CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO SEX OP 
THE SELECTED STUDENTS 

In discussions of drop-outs the question is frequently 
raised whether the high school program is more suited to the 
needs and interests of boys or girls. Several studies^5 have 
shown that the drop-out rate is higher among boys than girls, 
thus concluding that the school program is more suited to the 
needs of girls than boys. The sex of the selected students 
has already been discussed briefly, (Table I, p, 19; Figure II, 
p, 20), and this section of the study will add to this dis¬ 
cussion by relating the sex of the students to the drop-out 
rate from school. 

Figure V reveals some Interesting information on this 
matter, presenting the proportions of male and female drop¬ 
outs from each grade in each school.

Observations from Figure V : 

(1) The drop-out rates among the selected students, boys 
and girls. In each grade and In each of the schools 
showed considerable variation. 

(2) A greater proportion of girls than boys,on the average, 
dropped out In Grade X; however, a greater proportion 
of boys than girls, on the average, dropped out In 
Grades XI and XII. 

(3) The proportion of boys dropping out In Grade XII was 
nearly double that which dropped out In Grades X and 
XI. 

(4) While differences among schools may be noted. It 
seemed to the writer that no single school was doing 
outstandingly good or bad work In retaining these 
selected students In the composite high school. 

(C) DROP-OUTS CONSIDERED ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM 
CHOSEN BY THE SELECTED STUDENTS 

The programs chosen by the selected students were dis¬ 
cussed In Chapter VI. This portion of the study examines the 
drop-out situation from the viewpoint of program, and tries to 
determine which program retains the greatest number of students. 
Figure VI shows the percentage of students which drop 


out from each program,

Observations of Figure VI : 

(1) From the Grade X portion of Figure VI: 

(a) more than twice the proportion dropped out from 
General and Commercial programs as from the Mat¬ 
riculation program, 

(2) From the Grade XI portion of Figure VI: 

(a) the Commercial program had succeeded the General 
program with the largest proportion of drop-outs* 
This could well be explained by the availability 
of jobs for girls with two years commercial 
training. 

(b) although the Matriculation program had the best 
retention, its drop-out had nearly doubled the 
Grade X proportion of drop-outs. 

(3) From the Grade XII portion of Figure VI: 

(a) the Matriculation program still led in student 
retention • 

(b) General program again led drop-outs, closely 
followed by Commercial • 

(c) drop-outs in each program were very similar* 

General Observations Made On ^The Drop-out Situation **: 

This portion of the study has discussed the drop-out 
situation from three points of view: the drop-outs from each 
grade, the drop-outs according to sex in each grade, and the 
drop-outs from each of three programs in each grade* Some

general observations could be made from th^se data. 

The most obvious observation is that a large proport¬ 
ion of these students drop out*. In the selected schools 
none had less than a sixty per cent drop-out, and in one 
school, over seventy-five per cent dropped out. If approx¬ 
imately seven out of ten of these students dropped out of 
school within three years, many questions can be raised 
concerning the ability of the composite school, as it now 
stands, to serve the needs and interests of these students* 

With regard to drop-out according to sex, the evidence 
supporting either argument - that schools best meet the 
Interests and needs of girls than boys, or vice versa - was 
inconclusive. When totals were considered, more girls than 
boys dropped out. But, when considered on a grade basis, 
more boys than girls dropped out in Grades XI and XII, 
while many more girls than boys dropped out in Grade X* 

The data for drop-outs according to programs is 
limited by the changes in programs by students as previously 
discussed (p. 35)* Probably the most obvious point to be 
noted was the superiority of the matriculation course in all 
three years in retaining students.

CHAPTER VIII 


ACHIEVEMENT OF THE SELECTED STUDENTS IN SUBJECTS STUDIED 

The subjects taken by the selected students were divided 
Into six categories; Constants, Academic Electives, House¬ 
hold Economics, Shop, Commercial and Pine Arts, The numbers 
of students who earned final marks in these subjects were 
recorded, and the marks themselves (in terms of letter 
grades) were also noted. The per cent of students earning a 
certain letter grade was computed from these data. In this 
way, the subjects in which these selected students were most 
and least successful could be noted. This information is 
presented in the following tables. 

To facilitate comparisons in each subject category, 
a point rating system was devised by the writer. Pour points 
were assigned for an "H”, three for an **A”, two for a ”B”, 
one for a ”C”, and none for a ”D”, Thus a point average of 
1 , 4 . 6 , for example, represents an average mark midway between 
a ”0” and a ”3", It should be noted that this point system 
was purely arbitrary, and that the averages derived were not 
necessarily the same as the averages of the grades obtained 
by the students in these subjects. However, the system did 
give an average mark that was useful in comparing the achieve^ 
ments in the six categories.

(A.) GRADE X 

Table VII presents the percentages of letter grades, 
and the point averages, earned in the various subject cate¬ 
gories by the selected students in Grade X. 

In reading this table, and the two succeeding tables, 
it should be noted that in certain subject categories, 
(notably Pine Arts) fewer than ten final marks were recorded;; 
these marks were of little use for comparative purposes, and 
such results are not included, other than to note the number 
of final marks# Further, in the observations following 
these tables. Pine Arts are not considered, because of the 
few students who earned final marks in these courses* Their 
inclusion would tend to give only a biased representation*

Observations of Table VII ; 

(1) In the large majority of cases, students*average scores 
in non^academic electives are higher than their average 
scores In academic electives . 

(2) Among the non-academic electives, lowest grades were 
generally earned in Commercial subjects, while highest 
grades were usually earned in Household Economics* 

(3) On the average, students earned higher grades in the 
constants than they did in the academic electives* 

(li.) While differences among schools may be noted, it seem¬ 
ed to the writer that no single school was doing outstand¬ 
ingly good or bad work in attempting to meet the needs 
of these students* 

(B) GRADE XI 

Similar procedure was used in presenting the data for 
the selected students in Grade XI* Table VIII presents the 
percentages of letter grades and the point averages earned 
in the various subject categories by the selected students 
in Grade XI*

Observations of Table VIII : 

(1) As noted in Table VII, in each of the schools, students* 
average scores in the non-academic electives were higher 
than their average scores in academic electives* 

(2) Again, as in Grade X, among the non-academic electives, 
highest grades were earned in Household Economics, 
while lowest grades were earned in the Commercial. 

(3) However, higher grades on the average, were earned in 
Academic Electives than in Constants* The opposite 
was true in Grade X. 

(4) It again appeared to the writer that no single school 
was doing outstandingly good or bad work in attempting 
to meet the needs of these students, 

(C) GRADE XII 

Similar procedures were used in presenting the data for 
the selected students in Grade XII, Table IX presents the 
distribution of percentages, and the point average, earned in

Observations of Table IX ; 

(1) The trend observed in Tables VII and VIII was continued^ 
The difference between grades earned in non-academic 
subjects compared with those earned in academic sub¬ 
jects had widened, with the superiority of the former 
becoming more pronounced# 

(2) In three of the schools, the nimbers of students who 
earned final marks in the non-academic electives had 
declined very sharply, and comparisons, if made, would 
have been misleading# 

(3) As in Grade XI, the selected students earned better 
grades in the Academic Electives than in Constants# 

r 

(4) Once again, similar grades were earned by the select¬ 
ed students in each school#

HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS EARNED BY THE SELECTED STUDENTS 


The Senior High School Handbook of the Alberta Depart¬ 
ment of Education outlines the minimum requirements for the 


High School Diploma* These regulations, which govern the 
subjects chosen and the credits earned by the selected stud¬ 
ents, are: 


Subject to regulations governing the choice of subjects 
and the standing required for obtaining credits in each 
subject, the following are the minimum requirements for 
the High School Diploma: 


(a) 


Forty to forty-six credits 
as follows: 

Language 10, 20 
Literature 10. 20 
English 30 

Social Studies 10, 20, 30 
Health and Personal 
Development 10 
Physical Education 10 


in prescribed constants 

10 credits 
6 credits 
5 credits 
15 credits 

2-5 credits ' 
2-5 credits 


(b) Fifty-four to sixty credits in electives * (In 
other words, a sufficient number of credits in 
electives to make a grand total of at least 100 
credits.) 


(c) Credit in at least one high school mathematics 
course. 


(d) Credit in at least one high school science course. 

(e) Credits in one Grade XII subject in addition to 
English 30 and Social Studies 30.^° 

In presenting the data on credits earned, the organiz¬ 


ation of the selected students into grades, as previously 
described (p. 25 ), was again used.

Observations of Table XI: 

(1) The number of credits earned In Grade X by these stud¬ 
ents was considerably higher than the credits earned 
by the Grade X group (Table X). 

(2) The numbers of credits earned by the selected students 
in the various schools were quite similar in Grade X, 
but more varied in Grade XI, and also varied when 
total credits at the end of Grade XI were considered, 

(3) The number of credits earned while these students were 
in Grade XI was considerably lower than the number 
which they earned in Grade X,

Observations of Table XII : 

(1) The similarity among all schools in the number of credits 
earned by the selected Grade XII students, was striking* 

(2) In Grade X, this group did considerably better than 
either the Grade X, (Table X) or the Grade XI group* 
(Table XI). 

(3) In Grade XI, this group did better than the Grfude XI 
group, (Table XI) and had earned more credits at the end 
of Grade XI. (Table XI). 

(i^.) The number of credits earned by these students in Grade 
XII dropped sharply from the credits which they earned 
in Grades X and XI. 

General Observations of the Credits Earned by the Selected 

Students ; 

The data presented in this chapter on the high school 
credits earned by the selected students revealed three inter¬ 
esting trends. Probably the most obvious was the gradual drop 
in credits earned in each year. Thus, Grade XII students 
earned a mean of 33•3- credits in Grade X, 31*7 in Grade XI 
and 25.4 in Grade XII. 

Secondly, the Grade XII group earned more credits in 
Grade X and Grade XI than either the Grade X or the Grade XI 
groups. It was noted in Chapter V, "Attendance of the Select¬ 
ed Students”, that the Grade XII group also had better

attendance records than either the Grade X or the Grade XI 
groups* Thus, there appears to be a positive relationship 
between good attendance records and academic success. 

Thirdly, it was noted that credits earned in the year 
before drop-out were lower than in the previous year. A 
similar decline in attendance was also noted, again pointing 
out the relationship between attendance and academic success*

CHAPTER X 


HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES 


Special consideration should be given at this time to 
those selected students who completed their years in high 
school successfully* Keeping in mind that over 70 % of the 
selected students were drop-outs, it was no mean feat for 
these few to persevere and attain success where so many had 
failed. As described previously, (p* 2), alternative standards 
are set up for completing high school. Students are able to 
earn a high school diploma with or without xmiversity matric¬ 
ulation. The Senior High School Handbook explains: 

The High School Diploma is an official document 
issued by the Department of Education, certifying that 
the holder has completed the required program of 
instruction through attendance at a high school, ....•• 

..♦.This diploma does not itself grant matriculation. 

The student is expected to have so arranged his program 
that it includes the subjects especially required by 
the university and that he has secured the necessary 
standing in these subjects.^? 

Figure VII shows the percentages of selected students 
who earned a high school diploBia and matriculation standing.

this study, one observation of these students was made. 

Nearly all were attempting courses to complete their matricul¬ 
ation standing. Pew were aimed at the target of a high school 
diploma. It seemed that the goal of matriculation was so 
worthwhile as to merit an extra year in high school. Table XIV 
presents the numbers of students and the percentages of students 
who remained in school for a fourth year*

CHAPTER XI 


SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

The number of students selected for this study was 25,8^ 
of the total Grade X enrollment in the five schools. 
While an IQ of 100 was arbitrarily chosen as the upper 
limit for selecting the students, analysis of the group 
showed that the great majority had IQ* s ranging from 
95 - 100, i. e., most of them were clustered around the 
upper limit, with only a few below 90. 

The selected students, in general, had poor attendance 
records. Those who dropped out of school after Grade X 

D 

had a mean attendance of 178.6 days during their Grade 
X year, representing a loss of nearly a month of school. 
Similarly, poor attendance records were noted for those 
who dropped out after Grade XI. As noted previously 
(p. 25)» poor attendance is a cause of failure and 
drop-out from school. To lower their high failure and 
drop-out rates, these students should be cautioned, 
therefore, against unnecessary absenteeism. 

The high prestige of the matriculation program was com¬ 
mented upon (p. 33)# and the courses of study chosen by 
the selected students seemed to reflect this prestige. 

In Grade X, yi% of the selected students chose the 
matriculation program; in Grade XI the percentage was 


’ tl^t.Vy i ■

71 

29«3, and in Grade XII, 31*9* It is the opinion of this 
writer that some method of persuading these students to 
select courses more suited to their abilities, rather 
than those which are bearers of prestige, must be found. 

(5) The large number of drop-outs was outstanding. Over 35^ 
of the total number of students enrolled in Grade X had 
dropped out before they reached Grade XI, a further 33^ 
had dropped out before they reached Grade XII, and 
another dropped out while they were in Grade XII. 

The sharp decline in the drop-out rate for Grade XII 

as contrasted to that in Grades X and XI, should be noted® 

(6) Drop-outs analysed according to sex revealed contra¬ 
dictory information. Drawing conclusions on the 
possibility of any relationship between the number of 
drop-outs and sex, therefore, is hazardous. Previous 
studies (p. 1|.2) indicated that more boys than girls 
drop out of high school. The opposite was found to be 
the case in this study. However, when considered on a 
grade basis, many more girls than boys dropped out in 
Grade X, while boys led drop-outs slightly in Grades XI 
and XII. 

(7) The limitations in considering drop-outs according to 
program of study have already been pointed out (p. 33)• 

As would be expected, fewer students drop out of the 
Matriculation program than out of the General and 







72 


Commercial programs* 

(8) The data presented on the subject category records (Chapter 
VIII) provided insights into the attainments of the se¬ 
lected students* One conclusion was very obvious - in 
every school, in each grade, higher marks in terms of 
letter grades and point averages were earned in the 
non-academic subjects than in the academic subjects* Yet, 
in each grade, fewer selected students enrolled in the 
non-academic courses* Again, it is the opinion of this 
writer that some way must be found to persuade these 
students to take those subjects more nearly suited to 
their needs and abilities* . 

(9) In view of the large numbers of students who earned 
grades in Constant courses, especially in Grade XI and 
Grade XII, it seems that these courses may be too diff¬ 
icult for students of low ability* The writer feels, 
therefore, that while English and Social Studies should 
remain as constants, perhaps separate courses in these 
fields should be developed for students in composite 
high schools who are not planning to enter university* 

(10) The number of credits earned in each grade declined as 
the selected students proceeded throu^ high school* 

A seeming positive relationship between number of credits 
earned and good attendance records was also noted* 

Pixrther, many students who had completed their high school

year successfully. In terms of credits earned, dropped 
out in spite of their apparent success. 

(11) Thirty-two of the four hundred and fifty-two selected 
students (7*1^) received high school diplomas, while 
twelve (2.6^) successfully matriculated. A larger pro¬ 
portion of the selected students in School D were 
successful in obtaining matriculation standing than was 
the case in any other school# In view of this fact, the 
question might be raised whether the semester system in 
operation in this school is better able to meet the 
needs of students of low ability than is the normal 
school term in operation in the four other schools. 

(12) A final conclusion remains# If the composite high school 
is to meet the needs of all students, the writer feels 
that many changes may be necessary# In view of the 
findings of this study, it appears that few students of 
low ability in composite high schools are making best 
use of the opportunities available to them for furthering 
their education#
