SYNOPSIS 


This study was an attempt to discover variables which 
differentiate between achievers and under-achievers in English 
Language Ten in a large Composite High School. 

For each of the 44^ Grade 10 students registered in 
English Language 10 in Strathcona Composite High School in 
1956 - 57, an achievement ratio was found by dividing an index 
of performance in English by an index of mental capacity. The 
achievers were defined as those 112 students who had the highest 
achievement ratio and the under-achievers as those 112 students 
who had the lowest achievement ratio. 

The sample of 112 achievers included ^2 girls and 30 boys 
and the sample of 112 under-achievers included 21 girls and 91 
boys. 

Significant differences were found between the two groups. 
Achievers, in comparison with the under-achievers, were more often 
female; younger chronologically; had higher marks in Grade Nine 
language; failed less often between grades one and nine; were 
taking an academic course; had better study habits and attitudes; 
spent less time on out of school hobbies; took more private 
lessons; came from a professional or semi-professional family; 
had parents v^o had slightly more education; and were rated by 
themselves and a teacher as having a stable personality.

Under-achievers had a previous pattern of failure with 
lower marks in Grade Nine language, a possible failure between 
grades one and nine, and poor study habits. They were more 
often male and older chronologically. The under-achievers were 
taking an academic, general or shop course (in that order) and 
spent more time on out of school hobbies^ They took few 
private lessons, came from a non-professional family, and had 
parents who had slightly less education. The under-achievers 
felt that they had stable personalities but teacher-raters 
disagreed in some aspects and described them as rather quiet, 
rather sensitive, slow to adapt to change and inclined to 
give up too easily. 

No significant differences were found between the two 
groups in the dimensions of: intelligence, acceleration, 
amount of time spent on extra-curricular activities, amount of 
time spent on out of school clubs, language spoken at home, or 
junior high school attended in Grade Nineo

I THE PROBLEM 


Recent changes in the Alberta curriculum have included 
more teaching time for English language. The traditional 
language courses, which were keyed to formal analysis have been 
replaced by those which stress the functional use of language in 
social situations. All of this increased change and stress 
points toward an awareness in Alberta of the importance of 
language as the core subject. 

Despite all of this interest on the part of teachers and 
departmental officials, there are many students of both low and 
high intelligence who are not achieving up to their capacities 
in language. What factors differentiate between the under- 
achiever and the student who is making the most of his abilities? 
How can these factors be isolated: (1) as a means of predicting 
achievement and (2) with a view toward mitigating some of the 
causes of under-achievement? 

The 1953 edition of the Social Studies - Language Curriculum 
Guide for Grade IX says 

Evaluation should be continuous , informal (with perhaps formal 
check periods at intervals determined by the teachers] and co¬ 
operative (with both teacher and student discussing needs, achieve¬ 
ment and progress). What students need to know is where their 
strength and weaknesses li©*]_ 

This seems to imply the testing of such skills as reading, 
organizing, writing, listening and speaking. Only the writing and

organization portions of language were dealt with in this 
study, 

A performance index consisting of standardized tests which 
cover both mechanics of expression and effectiveness of expression 
combined with spring examination marks from both an objective- 
type language examination and an essay-type language examination 
were used. The skills of reading, listening and speaking which 
were not being tested directly, certainly are associated skills 
but - 


Ours is a world in which the written word is still the major 
channel of communication. Ability to use it both in passing on 
information and in accepting and comprehending information is so 
fundamental that the measure of a person* s efficiency in language 
and reading skills may also be the measure of his efficiency in 
his total job performance.^ 

In a study of "Promotion Practices and Policies in Alberta 
2 

Schools" Clarke found that in the school term 1953-54, 5«4 percent 
of a total of BO,649 students in grades one to eight in Alberta 
schools were failed, while only 0.42 percent were accelerated. 

Are these failed pupils in grades one to eight the same ones 
who fail in grade ten? And are the students who are accelerated 
the extreme achievers in grade ten? Terman and Oden^ found that 
accelerated students did better in school than students of equal 
ability who had progressed at the normal rate. 

For each of the 44^ Grade 10 students registered in English 
Language 10 in Strathcona Composite High School in 1956-57, an

achievement ratio was found by dividing an index of performance 
in English by an index of mental capacity. The achievers were 
defined as those 112 students who had the highest achievement ratio 
and the under-achievers as those 112 students who had the lowest 
achievement ratio. 

The null hypothesis that there are no differences between 
the two groups was tested with respect to the following dimensions: 

(1) Personal data 

(a) Sex 

(b) Intelligence 

(c) Chronological age 

(2) Previous school achievement 

(a) Grade IX language mark 

(b) Acceleration or retardation 

(3) Interests 

(a) Pattern of Grade X courses 

(b) Study habits 

(c) Participation in extra-curricular activities 

(d) Out of school clubs 

(e) Hobbies 

(f) Private lessons 

(g) After school jobs 

(4) Background data 

(a) Language spoken at home 

(b) Parents^ occupation 

(c) Junior high attended in Grade IX 

(d) Parents* schooling 




- 4 - 


(5) Personality Ratings 

(a) Self-ratings 

(b) Teacher ratings. 

A special group. Grade Eleven students who are taking Language 
10, are interesting in themselves. Are they taking Language 10 
because they failed it previously or because Language 10 and 
Language 20 were cycled in the smaller high school where they took 
Grade Ten? 

An attempt was made in the study to compare achievers and 
under-achievers with respect to social and personal characteristics. 
Would self ratings by the two groups of students be similar? How 
would Personal Development teachers who were not informed of the 
individual's success in language rate the achievers and the under¬ 
achievers on a scale of personal and social traits? 

Society today wants both the under-achiever and the reasons 
for his under-achievement identified. The hope is that something 
can be done to help him. If nothing can be done, then the feeling 
is that he should be removed from the classroom so that he is not 
wasting his own time, wasting the taxpayers^ money and holding 
back the progress of those who are able to profit from the 
educational system as it exists today. 

But of equal importance to society are the achievers. 

The widely ramifying contributions which the very ablest can 
make are so important that every reasonable effort should be made 
to identify and assist them. ,

II RELATED LITERATURE 


A. Measures of Capacity and Achievement. 

The history of the mental measurement movement might be said, 
with little exaggeration, to be the history of the search for an 
adequate means of comparing a capacity measure with some measure 
of achievement.]^ 

Binet, when he suggested the concept of the M.A. in the early 
1900»s, was searching for an objective basis for identifying the 
slow-learning children in the schools of Paris so that they might 
be segregated from the normal population and given special 
educational treatment. 

Terman popularized the concept of the I.Q. Franzen in 1920 
proposed that intelligence test results be compared with achieve¬ 
ment test results to give an accomplishment quotient (A. Q.). 

This concept has been critized on a number of grounds: 

1. Test validity - The average scores of a composite achieve¬ 
ment test (such as the Stanford Achievement Test) correlate almost 
perfectly with a composite intelligence measure such as the Otis 
Self-administering Test, when allowance is made for test unrelia¬ 
bilities. But when measures of specific achievement area are 
compared with the total intelligence measure, correlations vary in 
magnitude as shown by Table I. The fact must be faced that general 
intelligence tests are not always valid measuring instruments of 
capacity in one specific field. 

2. Another problem with respect to A. Q. particularly at 
the Grade Ten level arises in connection with norms. Individuals

do not continue indefinitely to gain in their basic mental 
capacity any more than they continue to increase in physical 
height, nor are the increments in gain equal from age to age. The 
age norm line differs from test to test, depending upon environmen¬ 
tal influences and many other factors, and such norm lines should 
not be equated nor compared. 

3. Much school learning is specific to the school situation 
and without exposure, the child could not be expected to learn. 

Thus a child with a high intelligence who had not been accelerated 
might not perform on an achievement test up to the rate predicted 
by his accomplishment quotient. 

4. Curriculum practises of certain schools may result in 
either more or less achievement in that school than for the average 
of schools of similar levels of ability. 

5. It is only possible to talk about age norms when there 
is a continuity of instruction with the content at one level being 
built upon the previously taught and learned content at some 
specific age level e.g. arithmetic instruction of ten year olds. 

In a subject such as literature, science or social studies where 
the instruction from year to year is not necessarily continuous, 
one cannot assume a steady growth in the achievement function. 

6. The above mentioned difficulties plus such things as 
varying length of school year, varying length of school day, 
promotion policies with resultant ^pushing on» or Spiling up% etc. 
make the finding of a satisfactory measure of achievement quotient 
a difficult task. Durost and Prescott suggest that their Modal Age 
Group method overcomes or at least faces up to most of these 
handicaps.

By "modal age" is meant that range of twelve months within 
a given grade which contains the greatest number or concentration 

of cases . Once the modal age within a grade has been found, 

the assumption is made that by far the larger part of the pupils 
falling within this modal year will be those pupils who have 
entered school at the normal chronological age and have progressed 

through school at the normal rate of one year in one grade. 

The next steps involve the establishment of norm lines, not only 
through the mean scores of successive grades but also the 
determination of the progression in some measure of variability 

from grade to grade, presumably the standard deviation. 

The norm tables read from these norm lines will provide the 
basis for determining the amount by which an individual deviates 
from the norm at his particular grade level.^ 

The present study in dealing with just one grade level, 
one subject and one school environment meets the criticism 
suggested by Durost and Prescott. 

Do achievement and capacity tests measure the same thing? 

Are children with high I. Q.^s always superior in achievement to 
those of lower I. Q.? Working with a group of tenth grade 
students, Bond^ arrived at a correlation coefficient of .59 between 
English useage and the Stanford Binet intelligence quotient. 

Gavinchuk3 working in Alberta found correlations between 
California Language Test scores and intelligence test scores 
ranging from .31 to .4^. 

Chalmers,^ in a study of the effective and recognized 
vocabularies of Alberta students in Grades VII to XII, discovered 
a correlation of .63 between intelligence and vocabulary.

Clark found the coefficient of correlation between scores on 
the Progressive Language Test Form A and the mental ages on the 
California Test of Mental Maturity to be .52. 

Thus a substantial positive correlation exists in each of 
these investigations and the relation between intelligence and 
language achievement does seem significant. So much so that even 
a student of very high I.Q. who did not have a correspondingly 

high A. Q. could be labelled as an under achiever . 

Another method of comparing achievement and capacity is by 
means of the Scatter Diagram. 

We predict the achievement test score that a person with a 
given scholastic aptitude test score is most likely to make and use 
the difference between his actual achievement test score and his 
predicated achievement test score as an index of over and under 
achievement .2 

3 

In discussing this method. Bowman warns that the fact that the 
pupil is indicated on the diagram as a deviate does not mean that 
this is his true status. When indicated deviates were screened, 
types of cases revealed included: 

1. Pupils whose school marks are significantly lower than 
ability and test achievement would indicate. 

2. Bright high achievers who are much too old for their grade 
levels. Such pupils may be tempted to leave school early, particu- 
larly if marks are not good.

3. Dull low achievers who are much too young for their 
grade levels. Such a pupil is often out of his depth. 

4. Pupils whose courses and interests are not in agreement. 

B. What to Include in a Measure of Achievement in Language 


What things should be measured in a language achievement test? 
Pooley in a criticism of the California Language Tests, says: 

What factors mark the growth in language skill? Surely among 
them are an advance in unity and the power to sustain an idea; an 
advance in sentence structure featuring increasing subordination; 
an increase in the power to organize and present materials logically; 
a growth in diction leading to the use of colorful words in effect¬ 
ive places. These factors and what good English teachers teach; 
it is upon these and similar factors that pupils should be tested.^ 

The Hilegas Composition Scale developed in 1912, was one of the 
few notable early attempts at evaluating written composition. 

Despite the fact that language was one of the first school 
subjects in which experimental measurement in education was under¬ 
taken, progress in the development of measuring instruments in this 
field has not been notable .2 

Adequate measuring instruments in language have not been 
produced in great numbers. Perhaps this has been due to the vague¬ 
ness with which the objectives have been expressed and the com¬ 
plexity of the skills involved in spoken and written language. 

The Co-operative Language Tests are among the most recently 
developed instruments for the measure of language achievement.

review says, "They are chiefly valuable for giving an average 
comparable level of achievement."^ 

Robert C. Pooley, Professor of English at the University of 
Wisconsin says: 

The test. Mechanics of Expression, contains 60 items of 
grammatical usage placed in sentences, 45 items of punctuation, and 
24 items of capitalization, the latter two types presented in 
running prose. Spelling is presented in 60 items, each in a choice 
between a mispelled and a correctly spelled word. The test. 
Effectiveness of Expression, contains three parts. Part I measures 
sentence structure and style by the comparison of passages of prose 
placed in parallel columns and by an exercise in the choice among 
four versions of the same sentence. Part II is a test of active 
vocabulary in which the student must guess the word intended by 
definition and by clues to the first letter and length of word. 

Part III measures organization; by rearranging disorganized para¬ 
graphs and by completing a partial outline. 

The materials of the tests are well chosen and clearly 
presented. The directions are simple and concise and make clear to 
the student the purpose of each test. Dubious and controversial 
usage has been avoided; so far as is possible in an objective test, 
the materials of English have been cast into natural settings of 
sentences and paragraphs. Mechanics are tested functionally 
rather than in isolation from English expression. It is one of the 
best tests available in the field of English skills.^ 

But he also says: 

Its principal defect is shared by all other objective tests in 
English; it does not test ability in English, if ability is defined 
as the power to use English effectively in speech and writing. It 
does test the power to correct errors, to proofread, to organize or 
reorganize material composed by others.^ 

Chester W. Harris, Associate Professor of Education at the 
Un 

University of Wisconsin answers the latter criticism somewhat. 

The materials on punctuation - and those on capitalization as 
well - present incomplete rather mutilated copy to the student.... 

The active vocabulary type of diction item which has been criticized by

several persons has been replaced (on the later forms) by items 
that require a choice among given words of the most appropriate term 
to insert into a given sentence.^ 

One major validity study is the 1939 study by McCullough and 
Flanagan in which form OM and the 1937 Form were correlated with 
several different criteria, one of which was the teacher^s estimate 
of excellence in using oral and written English; the median of the 
product-moment coefficients of correlation between the tests and 
teacher^s estimates was .53 2 

Despite the good points concerning a single measure of 
achievement such as the Co-operative Test Battery, Sangster, in 
weighing the pros and cons of language diagnostic tests and achieve¬ 
ments tests, concluded: 

Since there are no fields of achievement, as usually defined 
in the present curriculum, in which all types of achievement are 
perfectly correlated, the use of a single general achievement test 
often will hide the fact that in certain types of achievement a 
pupil has deviated from his own general level.^ 

As part of the 1954 Survey of Achievement in Language 
sponsored by the Faculy of Education, University of Alberta, 
investigators asked each pupil to write a page of original com¬ 
position upon a given topic. 

Such a test should make a useful supplement .... If language 
development involves reading, speaking, listening and writing, then 
other supplementary tests need to be used before a satisfactory 
evaluation of language ability can be made.^^

In light of the above statements, the essay portion of the 
spring Language 10 examination (devised by the English Department 
of Strathcona Composite High School) was included in the present 
survey. 

Support for inclusion in the study of the objective portion 
of the spring test (designed to test the material absorbed from 
the various text books), was given by the conclusion reached by 
Chalmers in his study of six hundred and three students in Grades 
IX to XII based on a test designed by the author. 

From the nature of the statistical data ... it would appear that 
a definite relationship between ability to perceive grammatical 
relationships, on the one hand, and ability in written prose 
composition on the other hand, has been shown to exist in certain 
high school grades.^ 

Are the Co-operative Language Tests being used by any other 
surveys today? The University of Missouri puts great store in 
their Placement Battery consisting of the ACE Psychological 
Examination and the two Co-operative English Tests - Mechanics of 
Expression and Effectiveness of Expression. 2 

Under the auspices of the Atkinson Charitable Foundation, 

W. G. Fleming and R. W. B. Jackson of the Department of Educational 
Research, Ontario College of Education, University of Toronto, are 
conducting a study of Utilization of Student Resources. 

There will be a basic testing program and a supplementary 
program. The basic program will consist of the Scholastic Aptitude 
Tests of the College Entrance Examination Board, the School and 
College Ability Test, The Nelson Denny Reading Test and a question¬ 
naire to be completed by each student giving relevant personal data

and indicating his attitudes and intentions with regard to 
university education. In addition, the staff of each participating 
school will complete as a joint effort, a questionnaire for each 
student. In this staff questionnaire the principal and his staff 
will rate each student on several characteristics considered likely 
to have a bearing on university success and will give their esti¬ 
mate of his chances of success at university... The supplementary 
testing program will involve only certain selected schools. In 
each of these, the following tests will be administered: 

The Kuder Preference Record - Personal 

The Co-operative English Tests 

The Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes (Brown and 

Holtzman) 

And information on the high school record of each 
student is being obtained... (These) should also provide a means 
of differentiating the successful from the unsuccessful among the 
students who enter university and also among those who enter 
employment directly from high school. 


C. Factors Affecting Achievement 


Early school leaving and low achievement often go hand in 
hand. The Nova Scotia Department of Education found these symptoms 
of early school leaving. 

(a) Repeated failures in om or more subjects or grades. 

(b) A consistently low record of achievement. 

(c) Significant retardation in basic courses. 

(d) Frequent absenteeism. 

(e) Lack of participation in extra curricular activities. 

(f) Indications of poor economic conditions at home. 

(g) Indifferent or hostile attitude toward school. 

(h) Behaviour problems requiring frequent disciplinary action.^ 

What effect does acceleration or retardation have on 
achievement? Terman was interested in the accelerates, particularly 

the gifted ones.

The findings of Terman regarding his gifted group, indicate 
that accelerates are more likely to be successful and even 
distinguished in their careers. 

In most studies above referred to, accelerates were equated 
with controls in initial abilityi but not in ambition or energy. 

The person with more drive may more often accelerate and work 
harder in school and job. Certain other studies have been broad 
enough or so planned that they somewhat allow for these factors, 
and still the accelerates did better. Might acceleration in 
itself have beneficial effects?^ 

Many studies have been interested in the effects of bilingua¬ 
lism upon achievement. It was one of the factors in the previously 
mentioned 1954 Survey of Achievement in Language conducted by the 

University of Alberta Education Research Committee. In an earlier 
2 

study, Robinson measured the effect of a non-English home life 
upon the written language of twelve hundred and thirty-eight 
children of Ukrainian parentage in Alberta. They and a control group 
of children of Anglo-Saxon parents were asked to write a letter on 
a given topic. The errors in formal grammar and expression were 
then counted and the number and percentage of each type of error 
computed. It was found that the children of Ukrainian parents were 
definitely handicapped in their ability to use the English language. 

Reid, also working in Alberta, found evidence of a foreign 
language handicap. 

Both tested intelligence and language achievement mean raw 

score comparisons place the samples in this order: English, 

French, Other and Ukrsmian. Because of the smallness of

the three bilingual samples, a safer generalization would 
be that the monoglot English sample proved significantly 
superior to the combined bilingual samples in both in¬ 
telligence and language achievement 

Reid also found that Grade VII girls of Alberta demonstrated 
a highly significant superiority over the boys on the Intermediate 
form of the California Language Test .2 This is not too surprising 
as girls early show greater facility with speech than do boys 
and they regularly develop larger vocabularies. Scholastic 
achievement scores provide plenty of evidence to show that ”girls 
usually excel in oral and silent reading, language usage, spelling 
and handwriting.”^ 

Dr. Sansom in his statistical survey on behalf of the Alberta 

Teachers» Association found definite sex differences in language 

achievement at the Grade X level., 

4 

Differing maturation rates are often used to explain these 
differences noted but even in studies in which boys and girls are 
matched for intelligence, the girls do relatively better than the 
boys in language .5 

What effect do environment and socio-economic status have 
upon success in language? Watt^ divided several thousand children

in Birmingham, England, into two groups representing compara¬ 
tively well-to-do districts and poor districts. He gave vocab¬ 
ulary tests to these two groups and found that at ten years of age 
the children from well-to-do districts ”were able to score an 
average of fifty per cent more marks” than those from poorer 
districts, but that this advantage was gradually lost, so that 
at the age of fourteen the influence of economic background were 
considerably levelled off. This would seem to indicate that 
intellectual ability enables children to develop power in the use 
of language when environmental factors favour such development. 

Reid ^ in the Alberta study mentioned previously concluded 
on this aspect of achievement that the superiority of urban 
children over rural children was due basically to socio-economic 
and environmental factors: 

Speaking of environmental influences in relation to intel¬ 
lectual development Shepard said: 

The environmental milieu in which a child is reared may 
influence the development of certain skills, abilities, 
and fields of knowledge which are considered most signi¬ 
ficant and valuable for those living in that specific 
geographical or social area. As those abilities are en¬ 
couraged, certain patterns of behaviour and mental develop¬ 
ment may be evidenced .2 

In a survey to determine educator»a opinions about accelera¬ 
tion of gifted students, Wilson^ sent questionnaires to school

administrators and to presidents and heads of departments of 
teacher-training colleges. One of the topics on which many who 
replied were concerned, was that of the social and personal 
development of gifted children. 

Engle ^ administered the Cowan Adolescent Personaility 
Schedule as part of an investigation into personality and social 
adjustments of high school and university students. He theo¬ 
rized that general intelligence and school marks probably influenced 
personality and social adjustments but found ~ 

"that the mean personality schedule scores for all acce¬ 
lerated high school subjects was 39.^ and for non«accelerated 
high school subjects it was 40.4. Corresponding figures 
for university students were 43.6 and 41.0. 

In general it may be said that there is no apparent relation¬ 
ship between personality schedule scores of those entering 
high school or university younger than the usual age and 
those entering at the usual age." 

Thus previous studies show that achievement is affected "by early school 
leaving; acceleration or retardation; sex difference; foreign language and 
other enviroriinental factors; socio-economic status; and social and personal 
adjustment.

Ill THE EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
(a) Finding Achievement Ratio 

In order to find the achievement ratio of the Language 10 
students attending Strathcona Composite High School, Edmonton, 
it was necessary to find each student^s - 

i Capacity index 

ii Performance index 

i* The capacity index was Mentsl Age as computed from 
the General Test administered on a province-wide basis as one 
of the compulsory Grade Nine final examinations administered 
June, 1956 . This was the Dominion Group Test of Learning 
Capacity - Intermediate - 1950 Edition - Form A - Alberta 
Edition. The General Test raw scores for 431 Grade Ten students 
in attendance May 1, 1957 at Strathcona Composite High School, 
were listed from the Department of Education Examination Branch 
records. Mental ages were computed by the method described in 
the ”Guide to the Interpretation of the Grade IX General Test ~ 
Administered June 1956”. Twenty Grade X students (through illness, 
a move into the province, etc.) had not written this General Test. 
As part of the school guidance program, seventeen of these students 
in October, 1956 had completed the Otis Group Test of Mental 
Ability (Form X) and the computed M.A. from this test was used. 
Three of the students who had not written the General Test, also 
did not write the Otis Test, and were not included in the sample.

The 17 Grade XI students taking Language 10 fell into 
two groups (1) those who were repeating because they had failed 
it or wished to raise a low mark and (2) those who had attended 
a very small high school in Grade X where Language 10 and 20 were 
taught in a two year cycle, and thus had not had an opportunity 
to take Language 10 previously. The M.A. as computed from the 
General Test in their Grade IX year was used for all Grade XI 
students. These Grade XI students were not included in the sample 
but were discussed separately. 

The remaining 44^ students constituted the final sample, 
ii Performance index - In light of the previous research 
done in this field (referred to in "Related Literature”), it was 
felt that the measure of performance should be composed of measure 
of both mechanics of English language and effectiveness of 
expression of English language. Standardized tests, teacher-devised 
course content tests and samples of written expression were used. 

Mechanics of language was measured by the Co-operative 
English Test A - Mechanics of Expression - Form X and by the 
Strathcona Composite High School Spring Language 10 examination. 

The latter test, a multiple choice objective type, was devised 
jointly by the six language 10 teachers of Strathcona Composite 
High School, to test the coverage of the course content from 
September 4, 1956 to May 1, 1957. In a split-halves study, a 
reliability coefficient of .67 was found. The T scores ranged 
from 19 to 79 with a mean of 49.57 and a standard deviation of 10.7 
Effectiveness of expression was measured by the Co-operative 
English Test B 1 - Effectiveness of Expression - Form X and by a

teacher marked essay written at the same time as the Spring 
Language 10 examination. The key used to mark this essay is 
shown in table II. 

Each teacher originally marked only the essays of his 
own class except for teacher A who also marked the 34 essays in 
the one Language 10 class of teacher E. 

Teacher A - 4 classes 

” B - 4 classes 

" C - 3 classes 

” D - 1 class 

” E - 1 class 

Later teacher A marked one set of essays (one class) originally 
marked by teacher B and a correlation in marks of .73 was found. 
Teacher A marked one set of essays originally marked by teacher C 
and a correlation in marks of .54iwas found. The essay raw scores 
ranged from 10 to 47 out of a possible 50. The mean was 29.5 
and the standard deviation was 6.9. 

Objective test scores and the essay scores were transmuted 
into T scores, (with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10). 

By means of the tables provided by the publishers, the Co-operative 
tests were changed into scaled scores, (with a mean of 50 and a 
standard deviation of 10). To give equal weighting to all four 
measures, these four standardized scores were added to give the 
individual student’s performance index. 

This performance index was then divided by the capacity 

index (mental age expressed in months) to give his achievement ratio. 

It should be noted that this was not a measure of intellectual 

capacity, but rather a ratio of performance in English to mental 

1. It should be noted that this correlation is low and it tends 
to weaken the reliability of the ^ssay marks as one of the measures 
of effectiveness of expression®

capacity for each student i.e. some students of high intelligence 
fell into the lowest quartile of achievement and conversely some 
students of low intelligence were included in the highest quar¬ 
tile of achievement. 

The students who fell into the upper quartile of the 
resultant achievement ratio scale were classed as those who were 
achieving near or up to their capacities and are called ”the 
achievers” in the remainder of this study. 

The students who fell into the lowest quartile of the 
achievement ratio scale were not achieving as high as their 
capacity measure suggested they might and these people are referred 
to in the remainder of the study as ”the under-achievers”. 

(b) Dimensions, of the study 

In addition to writing the four previously mentioned tests 
(used to determine achievement ratio), all 46^ Language 10 
students were required to fill out (1) a Brown and Holtzman Survey 
of Study Habits and Attitudes and (2) a questionnaire (including 
a personality and temperament self-rating scale) devised by the 
investigator. All students were asked to fill out the various 
forms to facilitate administration and to nullify the effect of 
”picking out” particular students. Iliese forms were administered 
to Grade 10^s during the Personal Development periods by the subject 
teacher and to the Grade 11»s individually by the investigator. It 

■Y^ 

was planned, originally, to use the Kerr-Remers American Home Scale 
as a measure of socio-economic status but when this was not available, 
the junior high school attended in Grade IX was taken as this measure^ 
along with language spoken at home, parents* occupation and education* 



- 24 - 


The junior high schools drew their students from relatively 
homogenious areas and the inhabitants of each area would fall 
roughly into the same socio-economic grouping. Information 
from the individual cumulative records was also used. 

Question 1 to 12 in the questionnaire (which follows) 
amplified by the information from the cumulative records, was 
designed to compare the two samples under four broad categories: 

(1) Personal data 

(a) Sex 

(b) Intelligence 

(c) Chronological age. 

(2) Previous school achievement 

(a) Grade IX language mark 

(b) Acceleration or retardation 

(3) Interests 

(a) Pattern of Grade X courses 

(b) Study habits 

(c) Participation in extra-curricular activities 

(d) Out of school clubs 

(e) Hobbies 

(f) Private lessons 

(g) After School Jobs 

(4) Background data 

(a) Language spoken at home 

(b) Junior high attended in Grade IX 

(c) Parents^ occupation 

(d) Parents^ schooling 

Question 13 to 20 was designed to cover the area of: 

(5) Personality 

(a) Self-ratings. 

Before these questionnaires were administered, the six Personal 
Development teachers concerned met and discussed the purposes of 
the study, the manner of administering the forms and possible inter¬ 
pretation of the various questions. They were instructed to help

the students with unfamiliar words and to give any help in 
interpretation necessary but to have each student proceed with 
the actual answering of the questions himself. 

These same six teachers were asked to fill out a rating 
scale similar to Questions 13 to 20 on the student-answered question¬ 
naire for selected students in their Personal Development classes. 
These were the students who fell into either the achiever or under¬ 
achiever category. The students were not identified as achievers 
or under-achievers to the teacher-raters. 

The teachers of Personal Development were chosen rather than 
those of some other subject as it was felt that the greatest 
rapport and understanding was built up in this subject between 
teacher and student. This rapport and understanding stemmed from 
the nature of the subject and from the type of person who was chosen 
to teach this subject. (Two of the six were school counselors and 
the other four were also experienced in working with young people.) 
Rapport was particularly important in administration of the Brown 
Holtzman Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes. 

The rating scale was adapted from that used by Beaton who 
in turn used the personality rating scale devised by Terman 2 
his later studies of the development of gifted children.

IV THE COMPOSITION OF THE ACHIEVER AND 


UNDER-ACHIEVER GROUPS 


(a) Sex 


Table III shows the number of students attending S.C.H.S, 
in Grade 10 at September 4, 1956 and May 1, 1957. Although only 
29 pupils appear to have stopped attending school during this 
period, the number was actually 46 ( 2 ^ girls and 1 ^ boys)* 

Pupils coming into the school from other schools account for the 
difference in totals* The final sample of 44^ was composed of 
197 girls [kk%) and 251 boys (56^)* There were S2 girls (73^) 
and 30 boys (27^) included among the 112 achievers* The under¬ 
achiever group of 112 was made up of 21 girls ( 19 ^) and 91 boys 
Wo). 

The standard error of the percentage of female achievers 

was: 




732 X *26e 

112 


4*2 70 


thus we would expect at the *oi confidence level that the achiever 


groups would be between 62^ and 84 % female 


The standard error of the percentage of female under-achievers 
was 3 * 73 ^ and we would expect at the *oi confidence level that the 
female under-achiever group would be between 9 fo and of all 
the under-achievers* 

Setting up the null hypothesis that no true difference exists 
as between the percentage of girls in the two groups, it is found 
that:

In table Di, the critical ratio exceeds 2,60 (222 df) and we 
can be confident at the .01 level that the preponderance of girls 
in the achiever group is significant. 

(b) Chronological Age 

Figures 1 and 2 show the chronological age composition of the 
two groups. The ^2 girls in the achiever group and the 21 girls 
in the under-achiever group both had a mean age of 16 years - 1 
month. The mean of the 91 under-achiever boys was I 6 years, 3 
months, four months older than the mean of the 30 achiever boys

(15 years, 11 months). The mean age of all of the achievers 
was l6 years 0 months (S.D. of 5.4 months) - three months 
younger than the 16 years 3 months mean of the under-achievers 
S.D, of 10.S months). 

Setting up the null hypothesis that the difference in means 
is not significant, we find that:

From table we find that 99% of the cases in a normal distribu¬ 
tion would fall between the true mean and t 2.630^ and a difference 
of ■’3.D0 or larger would occur only 1 time in 100 comparisons. We 
can reject the null hypothesis and be confident at the .01 level 
that the achievers are significantly younger than the under-achievers. 


At the end of the Spring term, a compilation was made by the 
school guidance officers of the students reported as indolent by one 
or more teachers. The results are worthy of note in this study. In 
Grade 10 there were 15 who had been reported indolent by one teacher 
(that is in one subject), 9 reported by two teachers and 3 reported 
by three or more. All of these 27 students^ names are included 
among the list of under-achievers» names found in this study.

But this apparent significant difference in mean ages 
might have been due only to significant differences in stand¬ 
ard deviations. Using the P test to test this: 

F = S. D.i^ 

So D• 2^ 

= 10.b! - 4.00 

574 ® 

d.f. are 111 and 111. 

This F was significant at the o02 level. Since there was a 
significant difference in standard deviations, the Cochran 

and Cox method was used to test the significance of difference

The observed CoR. of 2.63 is greater than this criterion t 
of 2.61 and we can confirm that at the .01 level of confidence 
achievers are significantly younger than under-achievers#

(c) Intelligence 

The intelligence in terms of mental age, of the achievers is 
shown in Figures 3 in years and months. The girls ranged from 
11 - B to 20 - 2 with a mean of l6 - 1 and a standard deviation of 
21.1 months. The boys ranged from 13 - 11 to 19 - 2 with a mean 
of 15 - 9 and a standard deviation of 17*^ months. The mean 
mental age of the combined group was 15 years - 11 months (S.D. of 
19.4 months). 


The under-achievers are grouped by intelligence in terms of 
mental age in Figure 4. The girls ranged from 13 - 1 to 16 - 9 
with a mean of 15 - 5 and a standard deviation of 13.6 months. 

The boys also ranged from 13 - 1 to 19 - 2. Their mean was 15 - ^ 
and the standard deviation was 16.5 months. The mean mental age 


of the combined under-achiever group was 15 years 7 months. (S.D. 
of 15 - 0 months). 

A list was compiled by the school guidance officials at the 
beginning of the school year, to show those students who, by reason 
of their high intelligence, were potentially outstanding students.

Three of the students in the 120 - 130 I.Q. group had stopped 
attending S.C.H.S. by May 1, 1957. The remaining potentially out¬ 
standing students fell into the achiever and under-achiever groups 
as follows: 2nd or

Thus of the ^0 potentially outstanding students, 22 or proved 
to be outstanding, 41 or 51^ were neither achievers nor under-ach¬ 
ievers and 17 or 21^ did not live up to their potential to the ex¬ 
tent that they were classed as under-achievers.

Setting up the null hypothesis that the difference in

From table we find that 92% of the cases in a normal distribution 
would fall between the true mean and i 1*7^ and a difference of 
2.31 or larger would occur S times in 100 comparisons. The null 
hypothesis must be retained as this does not reach even the .05 
level of confidence and we cannot be confident that the difference 
in mean mental age is significant.

V PREVIOUS SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENT 


(a) Grade IX Language Departmental Examination 

Were the Grade IX Language test marks any indication of 
achievement or lack of achievement in Grade X Language? Table 
IV shows that 77 of the 112 achievers received a mark of H or A 
on the Grade IX examination. The two who received a mark of D 
and the six who received a mark of C in Grade Ix did not have 
very high performance indices in Grade X but their low intelligence 
put them in the achiever category. 

Forty-two or 37?^ of the under-achievers received marks of H 
or A in Grade IX but did not live up to their performance when 
they reached Grade X. Fifty-five or 49^ received D or C in Grade 
IX and did not improve in Grade X. 

Setting up the hypothesis that no true difference exists 
as between the percentages which attained H or A in Grade IX 
Language in the two groups, it is found that:

In table D^, the critical ratio exceeds 2.6 (222 df) and 
we can be confident at the .01 level that occurrence of a mark 
of H or A is to be expected more commonly in the achiever group. 

(b) Acceleration or Retardation 

Does acceleration or retardation have an effect upon achieve¬ 
ment in Language 10? 

i. Retardation - Table V shows the effects of retardation. 
Five girls and two boys who later became achievers failed one 
grade. All of the five girls failures were in the first five 
grades, while the two boys failed in the upper public school grades. 
Only seven of the 112 achievers or 6*2% had ever failed. The 
standard error of this percentage is:

students from the highest quartile of achievement in Language 10 
who had failed previously will be between 0.4% and 12%. It would 
appear that failure is uncommon in this achiever group and that 
the few girls who did fail were able to overcome this poor start. 

Seven girls and 31 boys had failed at least once in the 
under-achievement group of 112 students. Thus students or 
34% of the whole group had failed. The standard error of this 
percentage is *045 or 4*5%. We can be confident at the .01 level 
that the "true" percentage of students from the lowest quartile 
of achievement in Language 10 who had failed previously will be 
between 22^4 % and 4 ^^ %. Six of the girls or nearly all of those 
who had failed, did so in the lower five grades. While 16 of the 
boys failed in these grades, 13 of the boys were failures in the 
upper grades. Five of the group had failed more than once. 

As 34 . 0 % is significantly greater than 6.2% we can be con¬ 
fident at the .01 level that failure is much more common in the 
under-achiever group. It would appear that once they have begun 
to fail, the pattern of poor achievement may follow them up to 
Grade Ten. 

Whey should more boys fail than girls? An answer cannot be 
given in such a limited study as the present one but perhaps 
the oft suggested reasons given in related literature - early 
maturation of girls; effect upon teachers of the quietness and 
docility of girls as opposed to traditional loudness and high 
spirits of boys, etc., may be among the causes. 

ii Acceleration - Table VI lists the grades skipped or taken 
two in one year. Five girl and five boy achievers were accelerated

3 of the girls in the lower grades and 4 of the boys in the 
upper grades. A total of 10 achievers accelerated or only 9^ 
would seem to indicate that there is less acceleration than 
retardation as Dr. Clarke^ suggests and/or that many accelerates 
fall in the middle two quartiles of achievement so that the 
acceleration puts them in a group where they no longer excel so 
outstandingly. 

Only 1 girl under-achiever and 3 boy under-achievers 
or 3^ of the 112 were accelerated. It would seem that a mistake 
had not been made very often, if at all in accelerating students 
who later were unable to "keep up" and became under-achievers. 

Too few students of either group had been accelerated to 
show any significant difference between the two groups. 

(c) Grade Eleven Students in Language 10 

There were 17 Grade Eleven students taking Language 10. 

13 of these (3 girls, 10 boys) were repeating the grade because 
they had failed it. One girl was repeating the class to get a 
higher mark than a G and 4 (all boys) had not taken Language 10 
before as they had attended a very small high school vdiere Language 
10 and 20 are taught to combined Grade 10 and 11 classes on a two 
year cycle. 

Three of the 4 who had not taken Language 10 before had a 
high enough achievement ratio to have fallen in the upper quartile

or achiever group but they were not included because it was felt 
that their extra year of high school experience disturbed the 
homogeneity of the sample. 

Four of the 13 Grade XI Language 10 repeaters had a 
low enough achievement ratio to have been included among the 
under-achievers. But this sub-group too, were excluded on the 
grounds of experience. 

The pattern of retardation and acceleration of the Grade 
XI»s is shoim in table VII. As there were so relatively few 
Grade XI»s, they were not considered further in the study.

VI INTERESTS 


(a) Pattern of Grade Ten Courses 

As Strathcona is a Composite High School, it was possible 
for the student to choose any of the patterns made possible by 
the choice of subjects available in the Alberta High School 
Curriculum, An Academic course would be that which provided 
prerequisites for the Grade XII subjects required for entrance 
to the University of Alberta by the University Matriculation 
Board. All of the four patterns included the compulsory subjects 
of Literature 10, Language 10, Social Studies 10, Physical 
Education 10, and Health and Personal Development. In the commercial 
pattern, the student would choose typing, shorthand, book-keeping, 
etc. as his options. In the shop-course, the boys would choose wood¬ 
working, electricity, automotives, etc. and the girls would choose 
fabrics and dressmaking, and foods and nutrition. So few students 
were taking all fine arts options, that they were included with 
those who were taking a mixture of options in a grouping referred 
to as "general”. 

Table VIII shows that ^0 of the achievers (71.4^ of them) were 
taking the academic pattern and 26 girls were taking the com¬ 
mercial pattern, while none were taking the shop pattern and only 
6 were taking the general pattern. The preponderance of achievers 
in the academic pattern is an excellent thing for this field: the 
lack of any achiever among people taking the shop courses is cause 
for attention. There are students registered in these courses, thus

it is indicated that the middle group and the potential failures 
find their way to this pattern. 

Setting up the null hypothesis that the percentage of 
achievers taking an academic pattern (71.4%) is not significantly 
greater than the number of under-achievers taking an academic 
pattern (52.7%)> it is found that: 

P = ^1 Pi + ^2 ^2

were taking an academic pattern be achievers if they were taking

some other course? Hohol gave maladjustment of curriculum and 
methods of instruction to the abilities, needs and interests of 
the individual pupil, as one of the prime causes of school 
drop-outs. The number of under-achievers (59 - academic and 3^ - 
general and shop) in the academic and general patterns would 
serve to bear out his thesis. 

(b) Study Habits and Attitudes 


The Brown-Holtzman Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes was 
used to assess the study habits of the achiever and under¬ 
achiever groups. The reliability coefficients given by the 
authors were computed by correlating odd with even items for a 
sample of 339 high school boys and 303 high school girls. They 
were .^3 for boys and .^0 for girls. To test the Survey^s ability 
to measure traits which play an important role in academic success 
but which are not assessed by a scholastic aptitude test, S.S.H.A. 
scores were correlated with A.C.E. Psychological Examination 
scores for a large high school population. In two large high 
schools the correlations were as low as .10 and .20. 

It may be concluded that with high school population as well 
as with college population the S.S.H.A. measures traits which play 
an important role in academic success and which are not assessed 
by a scholastic aptitude test. In practical terms, these statistics 
indicate the advisability of securing S.S.H.A. scores along with 
measures of scholastic aptitude. In the evaluation of a student^s 
academic potential, the S.S.H.A. contributes significantly to the 
information which may already be on hand .2

Table X indicates that the achievers had a mean raw score 
of 2^,12 with a S.D, of 11.30 on the S.S.H.A. while the under¬ 
achievers had a mean raw score of 22.^0 with a S.D. of 10.55 
The standard error of the mean of the achievers was 1.07 
and the S.E. of the mean of the under-achievers was 1.00. The 
standard error of the difference between the two means was

Entering Table Erwith 222 df, it is found that t of 3.64

than the under-achievers. (The difference in S.D.’s was not significant 

(c) Participation in Extra-Curricular Activities 

A large and extensive system of extra-curricular activities 
was available to the students in this school. Did the achievers 
take advantage of this organized relaxation and profit from it?

Was one of the causes of the under-achieverunder-achievement 
the fact that they were spending too much time on extra-curricular 
activities? 

i. Among the achievers (it should be noted from Table XI) 
that the most popular activity (47 girls, 11 boys) by far was 
athletics. 19 girls took part in modeling but all other activity 
was spread rather sparsely over the other possible activities. 

The 95 girls and li boys, making a total of 109 who took part, 
includes 23 students who took an active part in two or more 
activities so that not all of the achievers took part in extra¬ 
curricular activities. But enough of them did so to indicate that 
activity is possible along with achievement. 

Most girls spent under an hour per week on their activity 
while most boys spent three hours or more. The boys^ time was 
spent on sports which seemed to call for more practice time than 
other activities. 

ii. The under-achievers seemed by Table XII to be just as 
active as the achievers. Although athletics occupied most of 

the boys, it is interesting that 10 of them spent time on religious 
clubs and 9 on hobby groups. (None of the achiever boys seemed 
to find the time or interest for school religious or hobby groups.) 
The few activities of the female under-achievers were spread among 
the activities but only 4 of the girls were active in modelling - 
the most popular activity for the female achievers. 

Although 16 of the boys spent three hours or more on athletics, 
17 of the boys spent only an hour or less on their activity

held by Grade Eleven or Grade Twelve members of extra-curricular 
organizations. Thus it was rather surprising to find by Table 
XIII that 22 achievers held some kind of office. Most often they 
were the leaders of sub-groups or executive members with working 
offices rather than dignitary offices. 

iv. In contrast, the under-achievers (Table XIV) were not 
recognized as leaders by their fellows and only six held any 
sort of official position. These were mostly room representatives 
on the students^ union council who were elected in the first week 
of school just after the members of each home room had been 
thrown together after coming from many different junior high 
schools. The under-achievers were not leaders. 

(d) Out-of-School Clubs 

Did the pattern of out-of-school activities follow the same 
pattern as extra-curricular activities? 

i. By table XV, 113 of the achievers took part in outside 
activities (actually all did not as 15 had two activities and 7 
had more than two activities). Religious groups occupied 31 girls, 
with teen clubs (27) a close second; while athletics were most 
popular with 7 of the boys. Most girls spent one to two hours 
per week while again (probably because of the practice time required 
in hockey, etc.) the boys spent 3 or more hours. In both in-school 
clubs and this grouping (out-of-school clubs) the girls who were 
achievers spent less time on their activities than did the boys who 
were achievers.

ii* In the under-achievement group (table XVI), teen clubs 
(21 boys) were even more popular v>rith the boys than athletics 
(17 boys) or cadets (13 boys). The female under-achievers had 
activities in varying fields. Of the 21 boys in teen clubs, 7 
spent two hours per week there and 6 (strangely the very lowest 
under-achievers) spent three or more hours in teen activity. 

Cadets and athletics also occupied three or more hours: for those 
who took part. 

The achievers devoted a mean of 128 minutes to their activi¬ 
ties (S.D. of 48.6) TiThile the under-achievers devoted a mean of 
131 minutes (S.D. of 57*8) to theirs. By analysis of variance of '

on out of school activities. 

iii. Did the achievers hold office outside of school? A 
few more achievers (30 by Table XVII) held some sort of office in 
the out-of-school clubs to which they belonged, but in these 
clubs they were not necessarily first year members as they were 

in the school clubs: 7 of the female achievers were the president 
of the group to which they belonged - in most cases these were 
groups such as C.G.I.T. where the Grade Ten girls would be the 
senior members. 

iv. The under-achievers (Table XVIII) held 25 out-of-school 
club executive positions to the achievers 30. None of the under¬ 
achievers were president or vice-president but 15 of them were 
leaders of small groups. This category included ^ boys who were 
cadet N.C.O.’s and 6 boys who were group leaders in the Scouts 

or Y.M.C.A. Very few of the achievers held this time consuming 
type of position, giving further evidence to show that the male 
under-achievers might be spending too much time on out-of-school 
activities. 


(e) Hobbies 

What are the hobbies of the two groups and how much time do 
they spend on them? 

i. Most of the girl achievers (by table XIX) had a hobby 
of music or one of the other fine barts (17) or cooking and sewing 
(12). Table XXIV (discussed more fully later) showed 24 girls took 
music lessons - this includes all of the 17 in Table XX who called

music their hobby. Sports again (^) and collecting ( 6 ) were the 
main interests of the achiever boys. Seven boys spent one and 
one half to two hours on their hobby and 9 boys spent over three 
hours. Only 6 girls spent from one half to two and one half hours 
on their hobby; while 22 of the girls spent more than three hours 
indicating that it is possible to have a time consuming hobby and 
still succeed up to one^s capacity in school. 

ii Only 2 girl under-achievers were interested in arts or 
music, but unlike their achiever counterparts, 5 of them were 
collectors. Cooking and sewing occupied 3 and sports 2. The boy 
under-achievers^ interests in collecting (IS) and sports ( 14 ) was 
similar to the interests of the boy achievers but the male under¬ 
achievers were also interested in cars and airplanes ( 1 ?) and radio 
and electricity ( 5 ). 

Seventy four achievers (those v/ho had hobbies) devoted a mean 
of 131 minutes (S.D, of 62,~4) to their hobbies. The 76 under-achievers 
who had hobbies devoted a mean of 15^ minutes per week (S.D. of 62 , 1 ) 
to theirs. By analysis of variance of the means: 

General Mean - 131 x 74 + 15B x 76 ^ 

150 

S.S. Between means = 74 (131 - 144)^ + 76 (15S - 144)^ = 27402 

S.S. Within groups = 73 ( 62 . 4 )^ + 75 (62..l)^ = 573462

F r 7.1 



This F is significant at the .01 level and we may conclude 
that under-achievers spend a significantly greater amount of time 
on hobbies than do achievers. 

(f) Private Lessons 

i. As mentioned previously, 21+ girl achievers and 1+ boy 
achievers took private music lessons. Table XXI shows that most 
people spent from two to eight hours (a considerable amount of. 
time) in taking their outside lessons and in practising. Three 
girls and 1 boy spent over ten hours. It is perhaps of interest 
to note that 3 of the girls spent one to four hours taking private 
lessons in school subjects. In all, 34 or 30% took outside lessons 
of some kind, 

ii. The incidence of private lessons among the under-achievers 
(Table XXII) was even less, (6 boys and 4 girls took music lessons 
and 2 girls took dancing lessons.) Most of the under-achievers who 
took outside lessons spent two to six hours in taking the lessons and 
in practising. Only 1 boy spent over ten hours. 

The fact that only 1 boy took speech lessons showed either that 
speech lacks were not handicapping any of the under-achievers in 
Language 10 (as might have been suspected) or that if there were more 
who were being handicapped, nothing was being done outside of school 
about it.

This critical ratio is significant at the .01 level^ and 
we may conclude that a significantly greater percentage of achievers 
took out-of-school lessons. 


(g) After-School Jobs 

i. Among the achievers (Table XXIID the most common job 
for girls was "baby-sitting" (21), followed by clerking (11) and 
other unskilled labour such as being a waitress {S), 12 girls 

spent ten or more hours clerking or being a waitress. Most of the 
baby-sitters (15) spent under six hours. 

The boy achievers worked at unskilled labour (7) such as 
garage work, clerking (3)> delivering papers (2), and baby-sitting 
(2). The clerks and garage workers spent ten hours or more at their

jobs. Exactly 50fo of the boys (15) and 50% of the girls (41) 
had jobs and most of them spent a considerable amount of time at 
their jobs indicating that some achievers could earn money and still 
do well in school. 

ii. The under-achievers (Table XXIV) were a little more active 
vocationally; 4 girls (67%) and 50 boys (55%) held jobs. The girls 
were either store clerks or baby-sitters and they devoted any amount 
of time from under two hours to over twelve to their job. The boys 
were usually unskilled labor (40) or clerks (S); 24 of these boys 
devoted over ten hours to their job. 

The type of jobs that were most popular were very similar 
for both boys and girls in the two groups although no under-achievers 
girls were waitresses and no under-achiever boys delivered newspapers. 
The 25 boys who devoted 10 hours or more to their job were among the 
lowest achievers in the under-achiever grouping. 

Fifty-six achievers (those who had jobs) devoted a mean of 7.22 
hours (S.D. of 4.4.) to their after school job per week. The sixty- 
four under-achievers who had jobs devoted a mean of 7.90 hours per 
week (S.D. of ) to theirs. By analyses of variance of the means:

This is not significant at either the ,01 or .05 levels 
of confidence and we may conclude that the amount of time spent by 
the members of each group on after-school jobs is not significantly 
different, 

The question remains "would they have devoted their time and 
interest to school work if they did not have a job, and thus pull 
themselves out of the under-achievement rating?” 

Question 6 of the questionnaire follows up this line of thought 
by asking, ”If you do not have an after-school job now, would you 
like one if you could get one? The yes answers were: 

Achievers: ( There were: 

Girls - 51 ( 41 without jobs) 

Boys -15 (15 without jobs) 

Under-achievers: 

Girls - 11 ( S without jobs) 

Boys - 46 (41 without jobs) 

(Some of those who had jobs answered ”yes” to indicate that they 
would like another job or a better one). The overwhelming affirmative 
response to this question indicated the keen interest taken by today’s

youth in supplementing their incomes. Hohol^ mentions this lack 
of money as a factor influencing early school leaving. He quotes 
Harold C. Hand^s Study ”Do School Costs Drive Out the Youth of the 
Poor?^» as establishing hidden fees such as membership dues, rings, 
graduation costs, etc. as an important factor.

VII Background Data 


(a) Language spoken at Home 

The area of the city from which the student body of the school 
is drawn is predominantly English speaking, i.e. the clusters of - 
recent immigrants are in other portions of the city, thus the problem 
of a different language being spoken at home and at school is not 
acute here. Table XXV indicates that 4 girls came from homes where 
Ukrainianwas spoken, 5 from German-speaking homes and 1 from a 
Polish-speaking home. Three boys came from German-speaking homes. 
Seven of the students said that the language was spoken seldom, 2 
said half of the time and 4 said most of the time. The fact that 
these 13 people (11.6^) were achievers (some of them high in the 
achievement grouping) indicates that if the foreign language had 
been a handicap to their success in English language, they were able 
to overcome it. 

Table XXVI shows that 21 of the under-achievers (1^.^) came 
from homes where' a foreign language was spoken. Again Ukrainian(4 
girls and 5 boys) and German (2 girls and 5 boys) were the most 
common foreign languages. In addition 2 boys came from Dutch speaking 
and 1 boy from each of Polish, Danish and Finnish speaking homes. 

Seven people said that the language was spoken seldom; 1 that it was 
spoken half of the time; and S that it was used most of the time by 
them when speaking to their father or mother. If a handicap is 
present, it seems to be most common in Ukraihianand German-speaking 
homes.

Setting up the null hypothesis that the percentage of achievers

smaller than the number of under-achievers coming from foreign 
speaking homes ( 1 ^.^^), it is found that:

In table D^, the critical ratio is smaller than 1.97 (222 df) 
and we cannot be confident even at this .05 level that the null 
hypothesis is disproved. The percentage of achievers coming from 
foreign speaking homes is not significantly different in the two 
groups.

(b) Junior High Attended 

The junior high school which the student had attended 
in Grade IX was tabulated in Table XXVIIo Each school 
(except D which sends fewer) sends roughly the same number 
of students to the Grade Ten classes of Strathcona Composite 
High Schoolo 

School A contributes the fourth largest number of 
achievers the most under-achievers (32) including 

the largest number of male under-achievers (28)* School 
B sends the most achievers (2?) and the second largest num¬ 
ber of under-achievers (23)* School C sends the third 
largest number of achievers© School D sends the fewest 
achievers (of the five schools) and the fewest under¬ 
achievers© School E sends the second largest number of 
achievers (25) and the second fewest number of under¬ 
achievers « 

It would appear that the most under-achievers(part¬ 
icularly boys) came from the school A; that the most 
achievers came from school B; that school D sends fewest 
of either category; and that school E sends a respectable 
(second highest) number of achievers and only half as 
many under achievers as school A©

The 11 under-achievers who came from junior high 
schools other than in Edmonton, might have been affected 
more than the other freshmen-to-high-school by the new 
surroundings, different approaches of many teachers, etc. 

Setting up the null hypothesis that the school attended 
in Grade IX and the rating as achiever or under-achiever are 
essentially unrelated variables, and testing the hypothesis 
by means of the chi square test, it is found that:

From table E^, it is found that 9.^2 lies beyond the .05 level 
of confidence between .05 and .10 and the null hypothesis must be 
retained. Junior high attended and rating as achiever or under¬ 
achiever are not significantly related variables. 

(c) Parents^ Occupations 

If tables XXVIII which shows the occupations {other than house¬ 
wife for the mother) of the parents of the achievers and table 
XXIX which shows the same for the under-achievers, are combined and 
condensed the picture of parental occupation becomes more readily 
interpreted.

.01 level of confidence and we may discard the null hypothesis. There 
are significant differences between the father^s occupations of 
achievers and under-achievers.

It would appear that most of the achievers (90%) come from 
the professional or semi-professional classes and that very few (10^) 
come from the laboring class. This preponderance is made-up of 
62fo of all the boys who achieve from professional, 50% of all the 
girls who achieve from professional, and k0% of the girls from white 
collar homes. 50%o of the under-achievers come from the semi- 
professional or white collar worker class of clerks, salesmen or 
junior accountants. Nearly an equal number come from the professional 
group (21%) and the labouring group {27%o). Eleven girls or {37%o) of 
all the girls who were under-achieving come from homes where at least 
one of the parents was a professional person. Twenty-six per cent 
of the bo37-s who were under-achieving came from labour class homes and 
kl%o of the b oys cams from white-collar homes. Thus most under¬ 
achieving girls come from professional homes while most under-achieving 
boys come from white-collar or labouring homes.^ 

Does the fact that the mother is working affect the student^s 
achievement?

To 3k%o of the girls who were achievers, the fact that their 
mothers were working (with possible added responsibility to them) was 
not an insurmountable handicap. To k3%o of the girls who were under¬ 
achievers, the added burden may have been a cause of the difficulty. 

1. The above percentages were calculated from the total number of 
parents working for each category of student i.e. Achievers - 111 girls, 
34 boys. Under-achievers - 30 girls, 113 boys.

There were fewer male achievers and under-achievers whose mother 
was working. Numerically, 22 of the boy under-achievers had his 
mother in the role of wage earner. Tliis may have been one of his 
causes of under-achievement. 

(d) Parents’ Education 

Even though the students had been told to estimate if they 
were not sure of the amount of their parents’ education, 4 achievers 
left the column for education of father blank or wrote in that they 
didn’t know. Four achievers did the sam.e for education of mother. 
Three under-achievers left the education of father column blank and 
7 under-achievers left the education of mother column blank. The 
median education for both mothers and fathers of both achievers and 
under-achievers was "some high school”, in Table XXX. In the three 
rankings higher than this there were k2 fathers whose children were 
achievers compared to 30 fathers whose children were undep-achievers. 
Among these fathers, 11 fathers of achievers had graduated from a 
university while only 5 fathers of under-achievers were university 
graduates. 

In the three highest rankings from ’’graduation from high school” 
to ’’graduation from university” there were 45 mothers whose children 
were achievers and 31 mothers whose children were under-achievers. 

The ratio of university trained mothers was 7 to 3 for the achievers. 

There were more mothers and fathers of achievers with a high 
standard of education than there were mothers and fathers of under¬ 
achievers with a high education.

On the other end of the scale, only 2 parents of achievers 

had not attended school while 15 parents of under-achievers had never 

attended a school. This lack of contact may have colored the opinion 

of the latter group concerning the value of education and this 

opinion could conceivably have been passed on to their offspring. 

By means of the chi-square test, the null hypothesis was tested 

that achiever or under-achiever rating and parentis education are 

essentially unrelated variables.

VIII PERSONALITY RATINGS 


The answers to Questions 13 to 20 on the student questionnaire 
(the self rating scale) and the rating scales filled out by teachers 
are grouped according to each aspect of personality. The four 
tabulations from table XXXI to table LXII) which list ratings for 
each particular aspect, are in the order of: 

1. Self-ratings of achievers. 

2. Teachers’ ratings of achievers. 

3. Self-ratings of under-achievers, 

Zf. Teachers’ ratings of under-achievers. 

Note that Questions 15 on the student rating scale (Question 3 
the teacher-rating scale) dealing with flexibility has been inverted 
on these tables and now ranges from a low of "stubborn” (number 1 on 
Tables XXXIX to XXXXll) to a high of "too easily persuaded". 

Figures 5 to S give personality profiles for the two groups as 
rated by themselves and as rated by teachers ranging in degree of 
the personality factor from 1 to 5. Figure 5 shows that the 
achievers consider themselves to be very stable individuals. The 
average achiever feels that he is a rather good conversationalist 
but 31 out of 112 achievers (36^) consider themselves rather quiet. 

The achievers felt that they were average on the next six aspects of 
personality and described themselves as "able to accept mild criticism", 
"moderately adaptable", "average persistence", "sometimes self- 
conscious in social relationships", "neither calm emotionally nor 
ruled by emotion", and "sometimes anxious about problems". In the last 
Category of personality they rated themselves higher than the middle

ranking and said they enjoyed being with people. 

In the only difference on the basis of sex from the average- 
achiever profile, the boys felt that they were always ready to 
experiment. 

The profile (Figure 6) of teachers^ ratings of achievers in¬ 
dicates that the teachers’ opinions of the achievers is very similar 
to the ^’stable individual” opinion of the achievers themselves. The 
teachers felt that instead of being rather good conversationalists, 
the achievers tended to be rather quiet; rather than average in 
persistence, the teachers felt that the achievers did not deviate 
from the average and "enjoy being with people” but were instead 
merely "friendly”. In the only deviation on the basis of sex, the 
teachers felt that the boy achievers were indifferent about new 
friends. 

The profile of the average of the under-achievers (Figure 7) 
indicates that like the achievers, they too considered themselves 
to be stable individuals. Average on every aspect but the last 
in which they felt that they enjoyed being with people. The boy 
under-achievers leaned slightly toward "rather quiet” rather than 
"a rather good conversationalist” and the girls (like the achiever- 
boys) said that they were "always ready to experiment” rather than 
"moderately adaptable”. 

But the teachers who rated the under-achievers did not agree 
with the self-ratings. They felt (Figure S) that they were not 
average on the first four categories; instead - "rather quiet, rather 
sensitive, slow to adapt to change and inclined to give up too easily” 
They rated them "rather easy-going” and merely "friendly”. 





95 - 


A considerable number of boys (27) were rated as ”can accept 
considerable criticism” and the majority of the girls (11) were 
rated ”sometimes anxious” rather than ”rather easy going”. The 
teachers did not feel that the personalities of the under-achievers 
were as normal as the under-achievers themselves felt that they were. 

(Note that Tables to LXII which are discussed previously 

in this chapter, follow on pages 96 to 111 inclusive.)

IX GENERAL SUMMARY OP FINDINGS: 

CONCLUSION: AND RECOMENDATIONS 

(a) General Summary of Findings. 

This study was an attempt to discover variables which differ¬ 
entiate between achievers and under-achievers in English Language 
Ten in a large Composite High School. 

For each of the Grade 10 students registered in English 
Language 10 in Strathcona Composite High School in 1956-57^ an 
achievement ratio was found by dividing an index of performance 
in English by an index of mental capacity. The achievers were 
defined as those 112 students who had the highest achievement ratio 
and the under-achievers as those 112 students who had the lowest 
achievement ratio. 

Information about the two groups was found with the use of 
a questionnaire (including a self-rating scale of personality), a 
scale of personality rated by teachers, the Brown-Holtzman Survey 
of Study Habits and Department of Education cumulative records. 

This information is summarized under the following dimensions: 

1, Personal Data 

The achiever group was composed of 82 girls and 30 boys with 
a mean chronological age of 16 years 0 months and a mean mental 
age of 15 years 11 months. The londer-achiever group was composed 
of 21 girls and 91 boys with a mean chronological age of l6 years 
3 months and a mean mental age of l5 years 7 months.

2. Previous School Achievement 

(a) While 69 % of the achievers received a mark of H or A on 
the Grade Nine departmental language examination, only 37^ of the 
under achievers received a mark H or A on the same examination. 

(b) Only 7 of the achievers had ever failed while 38 under¬ 
achievers had failed at least one grade. Ten achievers and ij. under¬ 
achievers had been accelerated. 

3* Interests 

(a) Of the achievers, 71% were registered in the academic 
pattern of courses and none were registered in the shop pattern. 

Of the under-achievers, 53% were registered in the academic 
pattern and 29% in the general pattern. 

(b) The achievers had significantly better study habits as d 
attitudes than the under-achievers on the Browm Holtzman Survey 

of Study Habits and Attitudes Scale. 

(C) Athletics was by far the most popular extra-curricular 
activity for all students* Twenty per cent of the achiever girls 
took part in the modeling club. The majority of the students ^ent 
one hour peer week on their activity. Twenty-tvo achievers and 6 
under-achievers held an executive position* 

(d) Religious and teen clubs were the most belonged-to out 
of school organization, by the achievers* Athletics, teen, 
religious and cadetorganizations in that order, were joined mcs t 
often by the under-achievers• The achle vers ^e nt twjo to three 
hours and the under-achievers three or mcr-e hours on their activity* 
Thirty achievers held office (quite often a major position) and 25 
under-achievers held office (Usually as leaders of sraall sub-groups ).

(e) While only 28% of the achievers ^ent over three hours 
per week on their hobby, 1^.8% of the under-achievers devoted that 
much tirrB . The male under-achievers deviated from the usual hobbies 
of only sports or some sedentary activity and were interested in cars, 
airplanes, radio acid electricity* 

(f) Most of the 34 achievers who took private lessons spent 
from 2 to 8 hours: 15 under-achievers took such lessons, devoting 
the same an ount of time to them* 

(g) Exactly ^0% of the girl achievers and $0% of the boy 
achievers had jobs: 12 % spent ten or more hours at their job, A 
total of ^.6%> of the girl under-achievers and 57^ of the boy under¬ 
achievers worked after school {26% of the boys spent ten or more hours). 
There was an overwhelming affirmative response to the question, ”If 

you do not have an after school job now, would you like one if you 
could get one?’^ 

4o Background Data 

(a) While 13 achievers came from foreign-speaking homes; only 
4 came from homes where the foreign language was spoken most of the 
time. Twenty-one under-achievers came from such homes (including 

9 Ukranian and 7 G-erman), Eight signified that the language was 
spoken most of the tirEe® 

(b) More under-achieving boys (28) came from the *best* district 
than from any other single district. Twenty-seven of the 

achievers came from the ^second best^ district*. 

(c) Fifty per cent of the achievers had a parent who was a 
professional person or the owner or manager of a business* Twenty- 
one per cent of the under-achievers* parents came from this grouping* 
Tvjenty-seven per cent of the under-8.chievers came from the *labox‘* 


group.

Thirty-four per cent of the mothers of girl achievers were 
employed and l\.3% of the mothers of girl under-achievers were wage 
earners. In the same category, the boys were: achievers - 13^, 
under-achievers - 21^.%. 

(d) The median amount of education for mothers and fathers of 
both groups was ’’some high school”. There were I 4.2 fathers with more 
education than this (including 11 university graduates) whose 
children were achievers; compared to 3^ fathers with more education 
than ”some high school” (including 5 university graduates) whose 
children were under-achievers. The number of mothers of achievers 
with educational qualifications above ”some high school” were Ij.5 
(including 7 university graduates). Education of mothers of under¬ 
achievers above ’’some high school”, numbered 31 (including 3 university 
graduates). 

5* Personality Ratings 

Both achievers and under-achievers rated their own personalities 
as very stable, (The teachers were not informed as to which students 
were in the achiever or under-achiever category of this study.) The 
ratings of achievers by teachers agreed with the students* self- 
ratings but the ratings of under-achievers by the teachers did not 
agree with the self-ratings. The teachers rated the under-achievers 
as ’’rather quiet”, ’’rather sensitive”, ’’slow to adapt to change”, and 
’’inclined to give up too easily”.

(o) Parents' occupations - Significant at the .01 level that there 

are differences between the fathers' 
occupations of achievers and under¬ 
achievers, (Achievers more often 
professional or owner - under-achiever 
more often white collar or labor). 

(d) Parents' schooling - Significant at the .01 level that the 

parents of achievers had more years 
of formal school training than did 
the parents of under-achievers. 


Personality Ratings 
Achievers 


(a) Self ratings 


(b) Teacher ratings 


The modal rating for each aspect of 
personality was used to compare the 
dimens ions• 

Achievers rated themselves as very 
stable personalities: average in 
every aspect except friendliness where 
they were slightly above average. 

- Teachers generally agreed with the 

stable personality ratings. They rated 
the achievers as slightly more talka¬ 
tive and slightly more persistent but 
average in friendliness. 


Under-achievers 

(a) Self ratings - Under-achievers also rated themselves 

as very stable personalities, average 
in every aspect except friendliness 
vjhere they were slightly above average.

(b) Teacher ratines - Teachers disaereed on six of eight 

aspects v/ith the under-achievers 
self-rating. They rated the under¬ 
achievers lower and ’’rather quiet, 
rather sensitive, slow to adapt to 
^ change, inclined to give up too 

easily, rather easy going” and 
friendly” rather than above average 
in friendliness ^ 

No such person as the ’’average” achiever or urd er-achiever probably 
exists and the Investigator does not suggest that individual students 
be categorized or 3a beled^e.g*^ 

Girl - therefore probably an achiever, good study habits, etc. 

Boy - therefore probably an under-achiever, poor study habits, etc. 
or in any other way; but the differences indicated might be useful 
in predicting the achievement of the group for purposes of sp ecial 
groupings, special curriculum and remedial instruction. 

Many of the factors which seem associated with under-achievement 
cannot be changed but others may provide opportunity to raise the 
under-achiever from that category. These include pattern of courses 
(some under-achievers are out of their depth and not in the field 
of their interests); study habits (many are building a mental block 
of dislike, and others do not know hai to study); and time spent on 
out of class activities (the ten or more hours ^nt by ZGfo of the male 
under-achievers probably detracted from out-of-class school work). 

The fact that the two groups were spread over the range of 
intelligence from below average to superior supports the view that 
performaace in school work should be reported not only in relation to

the rest of the group but also in relation to the individuates 
capacity i.e. a student may be performing in the middle or even 
top portion of the class but may be performing quite unsatisfactorily 
in relation to his capacity. Conversely, a student in the lowest 
portion of the class may be working to the utmost and be doing very 
well in relation to his capacity. The implications on the hopes of 
parents and the vocational plans of students are obvious. The 
achievement ratio found by dividing a performance index by a capacity 
index is an important measure. 

(c) Recommendations for Further Study 

1. A study of the same students could be made at the end 
of the Grade Twelve year. The results of the Grade Twelve final 
examination in language could be a measure of scholastic achievement. 
Many of the under-achievers would probably have dropped out but it 
would be interesting to see if the remaining students were still 
achieving as they were in Language Ten. 

2. The study could be expanded to take in more schools. 

Although the school environment would be different, such a study could 
indicate the degree to which the predictive factors operated over a 
very large population. 

3. In such a study as suggested in #2, there would be a large 
enough population of Grade Elevens who were taking Language Ten, so 
that they could be investigated and compared with achievers and under¬ 
achievers for Grade Ten. 

4. Drop-outs from the ,population of this study, between Grades 
Ten and Twelve could be studied.

5. The students who had withdrawn from school during the 
term (e.g. between September 1, 1956 and May 1, 1957) could be 
studied intensively. Perhaps their withdrawal had altered the 
upper boundary of under-achievement so that many of the so called 
under-achievers in this study would not have been labelled as such. 

6. The investigation could be widened to include such things 
as parents’ opinions of the need for schooling, students’ opinions 
of the importance of schooling, popularity of the various groups, 
types of friends, composition of the two middle quartiles, etc. 

An attempt could be made to find a more accurate measure of 
personality^ than the present measure. 

7. The use of the Brown Holtzman Survey of Study Habits 
could be extended so as to give results applicable to Alberta 
students. 

S. The study could be widened to assess achievement in more 
or all subjects; and/or could measure achievement over a number 
of y^-ears.

Survey of Study Habits and Attitudes 


DffiECTIONS 

The purpose of this survey is to furnish an inventory of study habits and attitudes 
to serve as a foundation for self-improvement. If taken seriously, this inventory can help 
you obtain a better understanding of how to study properly. If you will honestly and 
thoughtfully mark all of the statements on the pages that follow, you will be able to 
learn many of your study faults. The value of this survey to you will be in direct pro¬ 
portion to the care with which you mark each statement. Since your answers will be 
treated with the strictest confidence, feel free to answer all questions frankly. 

You will mark your answers on a separate answer sheet. Make no marks on this 
booklet. There are 75 statements in this questionnaire. For each statement a five-point 
scale is provided for indicating whether you rarely, sometimes, frequently, generally, 
or almost always do or feel as the statement suggests. You are to rate yourself on each 
statement by marking the space on your answer sheet that represents your answer 
choice. Thus, for example, you would mark space R on your answer sheet if you rarely 
follow the procedure described or if you feel that the statement is rarely true for 
you. In marking your answers, be sure that the number of the statement agrees with 
the number on the answer sheet. Make sure that your marks are heavy and black. 
Make no stray marks on the answer sheet and erase completely any mark that you 
wish to change. 

To aid you in answering this questionnaire, the terms have been defined on a per¬ 
centage basis as follows: 

R— RARELY means from 0 to 15 per cent of the time. 

S— SOMETIMES means from 16 to 35 per cent of the time. 

F— FREQUENTLY means from 36 to 65 per cent of the time. 

G— GENERALLY means from 66 to 85 per cent of the time. 

A— ALMOST ALWAYS means from 86 to 100 per cent of the time. 

Remember, you are asked to rate yourself, not in accordance with what you think 
you should do or feel, or as you think others might do or feel, but as you yourself are 
in the habit of doing and feeling. When you cannot answer a statement on the basis 
of actual experience, mark the statement according to what you would be most likely 
to do if the situation should arise. 

There are no “right” or “wrong” answers to these statements, and there is no 
time limit for this questionnaire. Work as rapidly as you can without being careless, 
and do not spend too much time on any one statement. Please do not omit any of the 
statements.

R—RARELY S—SOMETIMES F—FREQUENTLY 

1. I feel that teachers do not understand the stu¬ 
dent’s problems. 

2. My dislike for a certain teacher causes me to 
neglect my school work. 

3. I feel that I would study harder if I were given 
more freedom to choose courses that I like. 

4. Whether I like a course or not, I still work hard 
to make a good grade. 

5. When my assigned homework is extra long or 
unusually difficult, I become discouraged and 
either quit in disgust or skip hurriedly through 
the assignment, studying only the easier parts of 
the lesson. 

6. In preparing reports, themes, term papers, etc., 

I make certain that I clearly understand what is 
wanted before I begin work. 

7. Difficulty in expressing myself in writing slows 
me down on reports, themes, examinations, and 
other work to be turned in. 

8. My teachers criticize my written reports as being 
hastily written or poorly organized. 

9. I feel that teachers allow their personal like or 
dislike for a student to influence their grading 
unduly. 

10. I lose interest in my studies after the first few 
days or weeks. 

11. I memorize grammatical rules, definitions of tech¬ 
nical terms, formulas, etc., without really under¬ 
standing them. 

12. I give special attention to neatness on themes, 
reports, and other work to be turned in. 

13. I take it easy and let my assignments collect for 
the first two or three weeks of a new semester. 

14. I hesitate to ask the teacher for further explana¬ 
tion of an assignment that is not clear to me. 

15. Lack of interest in my school work makes it difti- 
cult for me to keep my attention focused on 
assigned reading. 

16. Unless I really like a course, I believe in doing 
only enough to get a passing grade. 

17. I get nervous and confused when taking an 
examination and fail to answer questions to the 
best of my ability. 

18. I have trouble with the mechanics of English 
composition. 


G—GENERALLY A—ALMOST ALWAYS 


19. When I get behind in my school work for some 
unavoidable reason, I make up back assignments 
without prompting from the teacher. 

20. I feel confused and undecided as to what my 
goal in life should be. 

21. Some of my courses are so uninteresting that I 
have to “force” myself to do the assignments. 

22. When I am under pressure, my work is inferior 
in quality. 

23. Daydreaming about dates, future plans, etc., dis¬ 
tracts my attention from my lesson while I am 
studying. 

24. I beheve that having a good time and getting 
one’s full share of fun out of life is just as im¬ 
portant as studying. 

25. Even though an assignment is dull and boring, 
I stick to it until it is completed. 

26. In taking reading notes, I tend to take down 
material which later turns out to be unimportant. 

27. In taking class notes, I try to copy down the 
teacher’s exact words as closely as possible. 

28. I keep all the notes for each subject together, 
carefully arranging them in some logical order. 

29. When I am having difficulty with my school work, 
I try to talk over the trouble with the teacher. 

30. I feel that my grades are a fairly accurate reflec¬ 
tion of my ability. 

31. I feel that it is not worth the time, money, and 
effort one must expend to get a college education. 

32. Difficulty in assembling ideas with order and 
clearness within a brief amount of time results 
in my doing poorly on examinations. 

33. Some of my classes are so boring that I spend 
the class period drawing pictures, writing letters, 
or daydreaming instead of listening to the teacher. 

34. I lay aside returned examinations, reports, and 
homework assignments without bothering to 
correct errors noted by the instructor. 

35. I keep my place of study business-like and cleared 
of unnecessary or distracting items such as pic¬ 
tures, letters, mementos, etc. 

36. Telephone calls, people coming in and out of my 
room, “bull-sessions” with my roommate, etc., in¬ 
terrupt me while I am trying to study. 

37. It takes a long time for me to get warmed up to 
the task of studying.

,8. I am unable to concentrate well because of 
j periods of restlessness, moodiness, or “having the 
I blues.” 

; 

;i9. I put off writing themes, reports, term papers, 
etc., until the last minute. 


58. When reading a long assignment, I stop periodi¬ 
cally and mentally review the main facts and

59. I seem to accomplish very little in relation to 
the amount of time I spend studying.

I feel that I am taking courses that are of little 
practical value to me. 

When I sit down to study I find myself too tired, 
bored, or sleepy to study efficiently. 

I strive to develop a sincere interest in every 
course I take. 

The prestige of having a college education pro¬ 
vides my main motive for going to college. 

I think that maybe I should drop out of school 
and get a job. 

I carefully study the figures, graphs, and tables 
in a reading assignment. 

Prolonged reading or study gives me a headache. 

After reading several pages of an assignment, I 
am unable to recall what I have just read. 

I cut classes whenever there is something I’d 
rather do or whenever I need to cram for a test. 


49. I waste too much time “chewing the fat,” reading 
i magazines, listening to the radio, going to the 
I movies, etc., for the good of my studies. 

pO. My studying is done in a random, unplanned 
I manner and is impelled mostly by the demands 
of approaching classes. 

51. “Extracurricular activities” — dating, clubs, athlet- 
j ics, fraternity and sorority activities, etc. — cause 
me to get behind in my school work. 


60. I prefer to sit in the back of the classroom. 

61. With me, studying is a hit-or-miss proposition 
depending on the mood I’m in. 

62. I study three or more hours per day outside of 
class. 

63. Before each study period I set up a goal as to 
how much material I will cover. 

64. I can concentrate on a reading assignment for 
only a short while before the words become a 
meaningless jumble. 

65. I am interrupted by distracting noises while I am 
studying. 

66. I copy the diagrams, drawings, tables, and other 
illustrations that the instructor puts on the black¬ 
board. 

67. I keep my assignments up to date by doing my 
work regularly from day to day. 

68. I prefer to study my lessons alone rather than 
with others. 

69. I lose points on true-false or multiple-choice ex¬ 
aminations because I change my original answer 
only to discover later that I was right the first 
time. 

70. When preparing for an examination I arrange 
facts to be learned in some logical order — order 
of importance, order of presentation in class or 
textbook, order of time in history, etc. 


i52. I utilize the vacant hours between classes for 
studying so as to reduce the evening’s work. 

53. Problems outside of school — financial difficulties, 
' being in love, conflict with parents, etc. — cause 

me to neglect my school work. 

54. I am on time with written assignments. 

55. I have difficulty in picking out the important 
points of a reading assignment — points that are 
later asked on examinations. 


71. I am careless of spelling and in the mechanics of 
English composition when answering examination 
questions. 

72. Although I work until the last possible minute, 
I am unable to finish examinations within the 
allotted time. 

73. If time is available, I take a few minutes to check 
over my answers before turning in my examina¬ 
tion paper. 


56. When in doubt about the proper form for a 
written report, I refer to an approved model to 
provide a pattern to follow. 

57. I like to have the radio playing while I’m pre¬ 
paring my homework. 


74. When test papers or written assignments are re¬ 
turned, I find that my grade was lowered by 
careless mistakes. 

75. I think that questionnaires such as this are foolish 
and are of little or no help to anyone.

; If you were to divide this paragraph into two smaller paragraphs, you would 
logically begin paragraph two at the beginning of sentence (a) 1 (h) 2 

? (c) 3 (d) 4 (e) 5 

; There are three types of sentences used in building paragraphs. They are loose, 

I periodic and balanced sentences. The periodic sentence withholds its meaning 

; until the end of the sentence. The loose sentence, in contrast, reveals the 

principal thought at once. The balance sentence has tv/o parts which are similar 

in form.. The selection we are analyzing mainlv employs (a) loose (b) periodic 
(c) balanced sentences. 

D. The t 3 ^pe of sentence (which you have chosen in question 9) mainly used in this 

selection is used to (a) maintain suspense (b) save the v/riteFTabour and effort 

I (c) reveal the thought immediately and therefore not tire the reader (d) gain 
clearness and force. 

I-. Indications are that this selection was talcen from (a) a textbook (b) a travel 

I pamphlet (c) an essay (d) an editorial (e) a physical description. 

?. The clue word of keynote of this selection is (a) England (b) play (c) stage¬ 
setting (d) literature (e) attention. 

3. The topic sentence of this selection (a) serves as a precis (b) violates the 
I principle of unity (c) violates the principle of indentation (d) makes clear 
I to the reader the writer’s organization (e) restates all of the title. 

U A clinching or summary sentence often restates tersely and vigorously the point 
I of the paragraph. The clinching sentence in this paragraph is (a) 1 (b)2 

I (c) 3 (d) 4 (e) b* (N.B.— only com.plete sentences considered.) 

The fundaraental image of this paragraph is taken from (a) geography (b) bio¬ 
graphy (c) drama (d) literature (e) none of these. 

^ad the follomng selection 

I (l) The third man remained obstinately silent under allthe strokes from the 
jiotted cord. (2) He was very different in aspect from his fellow-prisoners. 

They Yf ere yound and hardy and, in the scant clothing which the avarice of their 
iptors had left them looked like vulgar, sturdy mendicants. (4) But he had passed 
|ie boundary?- of old age, and could hardly be less than four or five and sixty. (5) 

Is beard, Y/hich had groiYn long in neglect, and the hair which fell thick and stright 
pund in baldness, Yiras nearly white, (6) His thick-set figure was still firm and 
)right, though emaciated, and seemed to express energy in spite of age—an expres- 
;.on that viras partly carried out in the dark eyes and dark eyebrows Yfhich had a 
irongly isolated intensity of color in the midst of his yellows, bloodless, deep- 
hirJcled face. ( 7 ) And yet there wa.s something fitful in the eyes, which contradicted 
le occasional flash of energy; after looking round YO-th quick fierceness at Yfindows 
id faces, they fell again Yirith a lost and wondering look. (8) But his lips were 
)tionless, and he held his hand resolutely down. 

In the Y/riting of a Yrell constructed paragraph, the Y/riter m.ust give attention 
;) the connections between statem.ents—if his work is to be coherent. One Y/riter

)) I recall trolling for bass in another small Ontario lake on a chilly evening 
ite in October. The sun set in a tumultuous blaze of crimson that faded to deep 
lolet. The sky was perfectly clear at the moment of the sun’s going down, but 
iilf an hour later a mist arose, thick as a London fog, so that I had to grope my 
|iy through it with some difficulty to the landing-stage. The stillness was intense, 
j*oken by no sound save the working of the oars in the rowlocks and the hiss of water 
rom their blades. Suddenly the silence was rent, quite close to me by the mad 
iugh of a loon. My heart missed a beat and I nearly v/ent over board.

tosed fists. 


With her big knife the goodwife traces a cross on the golden loaf, the crisp 
rust yields with a shower of flakes, and the great slices lean temptingly towards 
A little cube of farm butter Yilth that slight alm.ond flavour puts the finishing

3 ) Look from the window as you go. The city is far behind now and right and .left oi‘ 
;rou there are two farms vj-ith elms and near them and with tall windmills beside the 
^ms that you can still see in the gathering dusk. There is a dull red light from 
be vfindows of the farmstead. It must be com.fortable there after the roar and clatter 
p the city, and only thinlc of the still quiet of it.

We have all wondered in reading books of history v-here the writers found all 
,e information which they seem to have collected in such large quantities. The 
cplanation is not a simple one, but a moment's thought v/ill supply part of it at 
iast. Men, wherever they have made their homes, have always left behind them some 

I 'aces or records of hoY/ they lived and what they did. These records are of very 
Iny kinds. Someti es they are in writing on stone, or paper, or even on clay as in 
le case of the clay tablets from ancient cities like Babylon. But many of them are 
" other kinds — buildings in which men lived, or forts which they defended; articles 
lich they used from day to day, such as weapons, i plements, untensils, or clothing; 
:ories or songs which they passed on from one generation to another. All of these 
lings and many others, wherever they have been preseiwed, tell us something about 
le people from whom they came. The historian must be a real detective in his own 
ly for he must take all the bits of evidence which he can find and must piece them 
Dig.ether to arrive at a true story. 

?, The one vrord to v^-hich it refers in the second sentence above is: (a) part 

(b) thought (c) moment”Td) simple (e) explanation, 

3 ,- This passage is taken from: 

! (a) an introduction to a detective story (b) a geography textbook (c) a social 

studies textbook (d) an editorial in a newspaper or magazine (e) a movie review. 

Which of the follwing statements best expresses the main idea of the above 
paragraph? 

; {a.) All these different records tell us something about the people from whom 

: they came. 

(b) Historians gather their informa-tion from many different kinds of records 
I left by people of the past. 

(c) The historian's skill depends on his ability to piece together many kinds 
i of records. 

(d) The traces of records that men have left of ho"w they lived and Yhat 

they did are of many different kinds. 

(e) YlTritings on stone or clay last longer than those on paper, 

[ 2 , TAiich of the folloiYing is not mentioned in the paragraph as a clue to the 
I people of the past? 

'i (a) preserved foods (b) Y^ritings on stone, paper or clay (c) buildings 
(d) Yireapons and clothing (e) stories or songs, 

I Again, you have landed on the beach of a large lake, your day s travel is 
>ver, your dishes Ymshed. Soon the stars begin to come out, and it is not long 
• efore the sky is filled Y/ith thousand.s of them, so large and so close that you 
[hink of clirbing a tree and reaching for them. A.gain there is that ^ueer silence, 
iroken only by the crackle of the fire. A mist begins to rise in the north looking 
i-ike a banlc of cloud-S, faintly Tirhite 8 ,gainst the dark blue sk;/. Gradually little 
shafts of colored lights shoot from the mist. The shafts move from side to side, and 
gradually lengthen until the^/ reach directly about you. They are no longer little, 
?hey are many colored, delica/tely tinted, beans from powerful se 8 .rch-lights operated 
i'rom some super-dreadnaught, always moY^ing, always changing color. You feel as 
:hcugh you must say something, and you break the silence by speaking to your companion 
Lon a low voice. He replies in the sam.e tone, and you continue the conversation far 
Into the night, revelling in the sense of companionship found in that vast strange, 
silent Yvildemess.

-:|64,0Q0 Question 

I Televisions ' s <Jt564,000 Question may succeed where businessmen and economics 
vriters have failed: It may b ring home to the low and middle bracket income-taz 
payer in the United States, the confiscatory ta x rates in higher brackets. 

Through this program, millions of viewers are becoming aware of income-tax 
rates which make it reasonable for a contestant to quit at the .jp32.000 plateau 
rather than go on to the final ^64,000 question. A monthly letter of the First 
^'Tational City Bank of New York spells out the situation. 

An unmarried contestant with an income of ;ij)4000 can take home ■^l6,6uu if 
\ie vfins the ;|p32,000 question. The tax collector takes ■)l^,4u0. But if he goes 
Dn, he risks his ^l6,600 to take home only $8708 more. For anet win of -^64,0(11) the 
banlc points out, the gross prize would have to be 1448,711, of which the government 
(Vould take ^;)384,711. 

37. "Confiscatoinr" in the second sentence above means: 

(a) seizing Virithout allo-wajice for complaint (b) trustv/orthy (c) paid as a 
sacred rite (d) extra or higher than usual (e) payment ror entertainment. 

B8. The above selection is mainly discussing 

(a) marriage (b) the T.V. Program ^^64,000 Question. (c) unfair tax rates 
(d) banicing (e) economics. 

89* Tbe selection suggests that contestants: 

j (a) tr^y" for ^5448,711 and thus net |64,000 (b) stop at the 132,000 plateau 
(c) risk the |l6,600 he has won to win I8708 more (d) get inarried to get 
' into a different income tax bra,cket (e) do not try to evade income taxes. 

^0. If an unmarried contestant vd.th an income of 14000 wins the ^02,000 question, 
le must pay a.n income tax on his winnings of: 

(a) #4,U0U (b) ;i^l6,60U (c) i8,708 (d) ^15,40U (e) more than any of the four 

Suggested amounts, 

I Keeping in mind the function of a sentence, select the best version in each 
pf the folloYu’-ing groups of expressions. Mank this on the answer sheet with a 
cross.
