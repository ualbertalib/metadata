INTRODUCTION. 


The utilization of the waste gaseous hydro¬ 
carbons both saturated and unsaturated has become increas¬ 
ingly important in the past few years. The oil industry 
is developing more and more along the line of synthesis 
because of the enormous quantities of unsaturated hydro¬ 
carbons which it is producing from the cracking of 
gasolines, naphthas, kerosene, gas oils, fuel oils and 
crude petroleum. The volume of cracked gas now available 
yearly is over 300 billion cubic feet, averaging 20 
percent of unsaturated hydrocarbons, with some exceeding 
50 percent. The potential significance of processes by 
which olefinic or unsaturated hydrocarbons may be con¬ 
verted into organic chemicals, gasoline of high knock 
rating, lubrication oils, solvents and resins is . 
apparent when one considers the enormous quantities 
available. 

In Table I (7) are given the estimated amounts 
of the lower olefins that are present in various com¬ 
mercial gases and the potential source of olefinic 

hydrocarbons from the lower paraffins present in natural

gas, cracked gas, gasoline, etc., which may he readily 
cracked to give olefins, assuming quantitative dehydro¬ 
genation of the paraffins to olefins.

This does not complete the possible sources 
of olefins- since hydrocarbon oils, such as fuel or gas 
oil, may be cracked to olefins if desired. 

In the Turner Valley fields alone something 
of the order of 3 million cubic feet of stabilizer gas 
per day are wasted. This gas is composed of about 5 


















































percent methane, 10 to 15 percent ethane, 40 to 60 
percent propane, 20 to 50 percent butanes, and about 
5 percent pentanes and higher saturated paraffins. 

If quantitative dehydrogenation of the para¬ 
ffins to olefins, and quantitative polymerization of 
the olefins to low boiling liquid hydrocarbons are 
assumed, the potential liquid yield is 10,650,000 tons 
a year, on the assumption of 60 percent efficiency for 
the two processes. By varying the operating conditions 
it is possible to vary the products from butylene to 
lubricating oils. 

Commercial polymerization plants have been 
developed by various oil companies for the production of 
gasoline from gaseous olefins. Wagner (27) of the Pure 
Oil Company reported that gases from low-pressure vapor- 
phase cracking containing 20 to 24 percent of ethylene, 

13 to 18 percent of propylene, and 6 to 10 percent of 
unsaturates in the four-carbon group were polymerized to 
liquid products boiling within the gasoline range by 
heat and pressure in the absence of catalysts. Gasoline 
to the extent of 1.7 gallons per thousand cubic feet was 
obtained when operating at 510°C and under 800 pounds per 
square inch pressure on a once through basis; the yield 
was increased to 3.0 gallons by recirculating the gas 












4 


derived from stabilizing the liquid products. The yields 
were improved in a commercial unit to 3.25 gallons, and 
by processing gas from stabilizing vapor-phase cracked 
distillates 9.0 gallons were obtained. 

Ipatieff, Corson and Egloff (17) of the Uni¬ 
versal Oil Products Company described the development of 
a catalytic process for the conversion of gaseous olefins 
into gasoline. Cracked gases containing 17.6, 37.5, 43.1 
and 69.7 percent propylene and butylenes gave gasoline 
yields of 3.3, 6.0, 6.8 and 10.9 gallons respectively, per 
thousand cubic feet of gas processed. The operating con¬ 
ditions for this catalytic process ?rere much milder than 
those necessary for the polymerization in the absence of 
catalysts, the temperature used being 230 °C and the 
pressure 200 pounds per square inch. 

The present work to be described is a prelimin¬ 
ary investigation covering the preparation of a gas high 
in olefin concentration by the pyrolysis of propane, and 
the reactions of this olefin containing gas under high 
pressures and temperatures. The gas was treated alone 
and in the presence of various liquid media such as 
tetralin, naphthalene, benzene and a low boiling naphtha 
fraction to produce certain stabilizing effects and 
further desired reactions such as the direct introduction 
of alkyl groups as olefins into other hydrocarbons. 













5 


The pyrolysis of the propane was carried out 
at temperatures from 700 to 850 °C and at rates of flow 
of 100 to 500 com* per minute to obtain the maximum 
yield of unsaturates in the gaseous product. 

The polymerization of the olefin containing gas 
was investigated at temperatures from 350° to 490 °C and 
from atmospheric pressure to 3800 pounds per square inch. 
Both static and continuous flow methods were used in the 
production of liquid products by polymerization. 

In what follows the results of these two 
investigations, although related in being really one 
project, are presented separately.

PYROLYSIS 

— 

Literature Review. 

It lias been shown by a number of workers that 
paraffins decompose into olefins, lower molecular weight 
paraffins, aromatics and hydrogen under the influence of 
heat, Zanetti (30) from a study of the pyrolysis of the 
propane-butane fraction of natural gas in silica tubes, 
found that the percentage of total unsaturated hydro¬ 
carbons in the resulting gas increased to a maximum at 
750 °C and then decreased, this latter process being co¬ 
incident with the formation of aromatic hydrocarbons and 
also of free hydrogen, 

Ebrey and Engelder (5) found that the pyrolysis ' 
of propane in silica tubes at 600 - 830 °C yielded vary¬ 
ing amounts of H 2 , CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 2 H 4 , C 3 rI 6 , the unsaturated 
hydrocarbons being at a maximum of 33 percent at 770 °C. 

Erom the results of Erolich and Wiezevich (11) 

and Sullivan, Ruthruff and Kuentzel (26) it is seen that 
■ 

the greatest olefin concentration is obtained by operating 
at very high temperatures and very short contact times. 

G-ishler (12) showed that a high concentration 
of olefins (mainly ethylene and propylene) could be ob¬ 
tained by the pyrolysis of the stabilizer gai from the 
Turner Valley naphtha.

Hague and Wheeler (13) as a result of their 
very comprehensive work came to the conclusion that the 
propane molecule, primarily undergoes decomposition in two 
ways, namely: 






ch 3 -ch 2 -ch 3 —* ch 4 + ch 2 -ch 2 
ch 3 -ch 2 -ch 3 —> h 2 . + ch 3 -ch=ch 2 

to form ethylene and propylene* At temperatures below 
700 °C the pyrolysis is probably represented by these 
equations. Above 700 °C secondary changes occur to a 
large extent. The higher olefins are less stable than 
ethylene and probably give ethylene as a product of their 
decomposition with the formation of butadiene and arom¬ 
atics from the latter. They found that the amount of 
hydrogen increases as the temperature increases. 

Low temperatures and short contact times favor 
the formation of propylene while higher temperatures and 
longer contact times favor ethylene formation. Pressure 
while favoring polymerization, acts to prevent dehydro¬ 
genation, and therefore, since the production of a maxi¬ 
mum amount of olefins was sought, the pyrolysis was 
allowed to proceed at atmospheric pressure. 

Since the conditions for maximum olefin pro¬ 
duction varied among the individual experimenters it was 
deemed desirable to carry out experiments to find the 

conditions necessary for maximum olefin production in 
this laboratory. 












8 


This variation may he caused by many factors. 
The composition of the gas to be pyrolyzed was slightly 
different in each case, the quartz tubes in which the 

reaction took place were of different sizes, the rates 

' 

of flow and therefore the contact times were different 
and the place at which the temperature was measured was 
probably different. The optimum conditions have to be 
determined separately for each experimental set up.

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS 


Materials. 

The initial gas was Pyrofax, a commercial 
liquid hydrocarbon prepared by the fractionation of 
stabilizer gas separated from natural gasoline. It was 
largely propane, which gave a formula of C 2 . 92 H 7#84 on 
combustion analysis. 

Annarat us . 

The apparatus employed in the pyrolysis of 
propane (Pyrofax) gas is showh diagrammatically in 
figure 2. The gas entered the system through the valve, 

A, the rate of flow being measured by a capillary tube 
type flowmeter, G, which was calibrated against a Sargent 
wet testmeter. The gas then passed through an absorption 
tower, B, containing calcium chloride to remove any 
water vapor. In the reaction tube, D, the propane was 
decomposed with the production of unsaturates, hydrogen 
and lower paraffins. This quartz tube was one inch in 
diameter and twenty-seven inches long of which fourteen 
inches was electrically heated to the required temperature 
The temperature was measured by a calibrated platinum - 
platinum-rhodium thermocouple. Temperatures were indic¬ 
ated by an automatic temperature controller which con¬ 
trolled the heating current through suitable relays. Most

of the tar that was formed during the pyrolysis was 
caught in the trap, E, and some vapors were condensed by 
the water-cooled condenser» The first of the absorption 
towers, F, contained glass wool to remove tar fog while 
; the remaining two contained activated charcoal which 
removed higher hydrocarbons and liquid vapors which were 
not removed by the condenser* The purified olefin gas 
was then collected in a water-sealed gas holder from 
which it was compressed and stored at low pressure* The 
; olefin containing gas was analyzed in a Burrell gas 
| analysis apparatus*

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 




The propane was pyrolyzed at various rates of 
flow and at different temperatures to obtain the maximum 
yield of olefins. The following table shows typical 
results of these experiments:

The graph shown in figure 3 also illustrates 
these results. From the table and graph it may be seen 
that the maximum yield of olefins was obtained at a 
temperature of 820 °C and at a rate of flow of 400 com. 
per minute, consequently these conditions were used to 
pyrolyze the propane for use in the experiments on 
polymerization. 

The propane was also pyrolyzed at lower temp¬ 
eratures than 750 °C but the yield of gaseous 












TEICPERATURE 























15 . 

unsaturates was lowered as the temperature was decreased. 
Hates of flow of 100, 200 and 500 com. per minute were 
also tried but the olefin content of the product remained 
below that obtained at 820 °C and 400 com. per minute. 

The results in Table II, above, show 37.2 
percent total olefins and 12.2 percent hydrogen as opt¬ 
imum yields. Generally in future operations of the 
apparatus, the yields varied somewhat, with slight 
changes in operating conditions from day to day. The 
average pyrolyzed gas contained around 36 percent olefins 
and 14 percent hydrogen. Analyses were carried out from 
time to time in order to obtain weight balances in the 
following experiments. 

It is not unlikely that further experiments 
would result in higher conversion to olefins. Certainly 
a recirculation process combined with removal of the ole¬ 
fins between passes would give much higher yields. The 
yield per pass would be small but the production of 
liquids and tar could be almost entirely suppressed. 

The gas resulting from the above work, however, 
was satisfactory for the purposes of the present investi¬ 
gation on polymerization. No attempt Y/as made to improve 
the olefin yield by further cracking of the gases remain¬ 
ing after the polymerization experiments to be described. 

The efficiency of the pyrolysis process in the 
production of olefins may be judged from the following

It should be pointed out that these results are 
slightly different from normal in as much as the charcoal 
was fresh and retained considerable olefins. Normally, 
more olefins appeared in the off-gas as the charcoal was 
usually saturated with gas and served largely to retain 
vapors of liquids.

POLYMERIZATION 


Literature Review* 

The literature available on the polymerization 
of olefins prior to 1930 has been ably reviewed by Sgloff, 
Schaad and Lowry (8). The reactions occurring when ole¬ 
fins are subjected to heat or pressure are of three types. 
There may be breakdown of the molecule consisting in 
some cases merely of hydrogen loss, and others which go 
so far as to produce carbon and hydrogen as sole products. 
On the other hand the change can be one of synthesis 
giving rise to hydrocarbons of higher molecular weight than 
the original. Also a molecular rearrangement may take 
place, usually a shift in the position of the double bond. 
These changes may take place concurrently or simultaneously 
but they depend upon experimental conditions. 

With mild heating, rearrangement or polymeriz¬ 
ation reactions predominate which produce olefin or naph¬ 
thene hydrocarbons of greater molecular weight than that 
of the starting substance. Pressure aids this type of 
change. At more elevated temperatures polymerization 
continues, and simultaneously there are formed carbon, 
hydrogen, acetylene and low molecular weight olefins 
and paraffins as a result of disruptive changes. At 
elevated temperatures and short contact times the higher 































18 . 


olefins, produced by polymerization, tend to become con¬ 
verted into aromatic hydrocarbons. At very high, temper¬ 
atures practically no polymerization takes place and the 
primary products from the olefins are carbon and hydrogen 
Catalysts lower the temperature at which changes in ole¬ 
fins take place. Some catalysts favor disruptive changes 
while others aid polymerization. 

A number of workers have suggested mechanisms 
by which some of these changes occur. Bone and Coward 
(2), Nellensteyn (23), 'and Walker (28) postulated the 
extensive formation of free radicals as intermediate pro¬ 
ducts. Other investigators, notably Noyes (24) Zanetti, 
Suydam and Offner (31), Hague and Wheeler (13) and 
Wheeler and Wood (29), have presented theories to explain 
aromatic formation from ethylene. 

From the reaction products reported, Egloff, 
Schaad and Lowry consider the probable course of changes 
in the decomposition of ethylene to be first a break in 
the ethylene molecule to free methylene radicals, :CH a . 
These lose hydrogen and form methine radicals, :CH, or 
disintegrate completely to carbon and hydrogen. Hydro¬ 
genation of methylene radicals gives methane. This may 
be written in the one equation® 

C 2 E 4 ——> CH 4 -r C 

but it is unlikely that such a change would occur in one 
step.

Ethane is formed hy direct hydrogenation of 
ethylene, the hydrogen being liberated by the simult¬ 
aneous dehydrogenation of the ethylene molecules or split 
from free radicals. 

Polymerization of ethylene appears to commence 
with the formation of butylene. By careful work at lorn 
temperatures butylene may be obtained as the sole product 
and this indicates that it is produced by direct union 
of t T wo ethylene molecules, and does not involve inter¬ 
mediate stages. Butadiene results/^y the dehydrogenation 
of butylene. Hexylene may be formed by the addition of 
ethylene to butylene, and a continuation of this process 
gives the oils composed of higher olefins. 

•The mechanism by which ethylene is converted 
into aromatic hydrocarbons, that is most generally 
accepted, is that proposed by a number of workers involv¬ 
ing the formation of butadiene, a hexene, a cyclohexene, 
and benzene by dehydrogenation of the cyclic hydrocarbon. 
Perhaps the ethylene is first converted into butylene, 
which adds ethylene to give a hexene, or dehydrogenates 
to butadiene, and then forms hexadiene. The ring closes 
and on dehydrogenation benzene is formed. This mechanism 
was stated by Hague and Wheeler (13) in the following 
equations:

The same compounds might form in a simpler 
manner by union of three ethylene molecules to cyclo¬ 
hexane, followed by dehydrogenation to benzene, a not 
unlikely reaction under pressure and in the presence of 
some hydrogen as a stabilizing agent. 

The formation of styrene is probably by the 
addition of ethylene to benzene:

Anthracene and phenanthrene can he formed from the

Wheeler and Wood (29) modified the mechanism 
proposed by Hague and Wheeler in that they did not assume 
the intermediate formation of a straight chain hexene. 
They suggested that the butadiene adds on the ethylene 
and forms cyclohexene in one stage:

This reaction accords with the work of Diels 
\ and Adler (3) who proved that the addition of butadiene 
| to unsaturated substances forms cyclic compounds. This 
hypothesis is also supported by the fact that Wheeler 
and Wood found cyclohexene in considerable quantity in 
the liquid hydrocarbons formed from the olefins at low 
decomposition temperatures. At higher temperatures the 
| liquids consisted mainly of aromatic hydrocarbons which 
| was in accord with the fact that cyclohexene was found 
! to be dehydrogenated to benzene at 600 °C. This latter 
stage of the reactions, forming aromatic from hydro-

aromatic hydrocarbons, was represented by Wheeler and 
Wood by:

Cyclohexene Cyclohexadiene Benzene 

Analogously to the formation of cyclohexene 
from butadiene and ethylene, partly hydrogenated naphtha¬ 
lenes could be formed by the union of butadiene and 
cyclohexane. These products vfould form naphthalene on 
dehydrogenation. 

The condensation of ethylene to liquid products 
of higher boiling points is aided by pressure. Ipatiev 
(15) found that under pressure of 70 atmospheres poly¬ 
merization readily took place at temperatures much below 
that at which reaction took place under atmospheric 
pressure. Reaction began at about 325 °C and proceeded 
I with considerable speed at 380° and 400 °C. The liquid 
; product consisted of a small amount of grayish green 
I liquid made up of paraffin, olefin and polymethylene 
hydrocarbons. On distillation the liquid boiled up to 
about 280 °C• From the boiling ranges of the liquid 
products, Ipatiey reported lower paraffins up to nonane, 
and several hydronaphthenes. Benzene and benzene de¬ 
rivatives were not found. 























23 


Ipatiev’s mechanism of reaction included the 
formation of polymethylenes by the polymerization of 
ethylene. Higher open chain olefins were thought to be 
formed by direct polymerization or by ring opening of 
the polymethylenes. Production of saturated hydrocarbons 
was considered due to hydrogenation of the cyclanes, 
causing ring opening, or to splitting of side chains 
attached to a polymethylene nucleus. 

Hunstan, Hague and Wheeler (4) in static ex¬ 
periments on the polymerization of olefins both pure and 
when mixed with saturated gases or hydrogen, found that 
the pressure increased as heating progressed and attained 
a maximum before the reaction temperature was reached. 
Subsequently, the pressure fell with time when the auto¬ 
clave 7/as maintained at the reaction temperature (580 - 
400 °C), rapidly at first and then more slowly until the 
pressure drop with time was negligible. Pressure drops 
were of the order of 60 pounds per square inch per minute, 
the maximum pressure being from 1000 to 1400 pounds per 
square inch. The conversion of olefins to liquid products 
varied from 65 to 92 percent of olefins changed, by weight, 
depending upon the amount of diluent added to the ethylene. 
The autoclaves used were of mild steel, and in the ex¬ 
periment where 92 percent liquid products were obtained 
the autoclave surface was enameled. In this experiment

24 


the rate of reaction, as indicated by the pressure drop 
in unit time, was greatest and the carbon deposition was 
negligible. They found that although the presence of 
diluents reduced the conversion into liquids down to 65 
to 70 percent by weight of the olefins reacted, there was 
the possibility of treating gas rich in olefins, such as 
gas from an oil cracking plant or gas from the mild pyr¬ 
olysis of natural gas, without previous elimination of 
hydrogen and saturated hydrocarbons. Using pure ethylene 
continuous flow experiments were run, the conversion being 
about 65 per cent by weight of the ethylene supplied. 
Pressures up to 1600 pounds per square inch and tempera¬ 
tures to 500 °C were used. It was found that as the pre¬ 
ssure was increased, the temperature necessary to attain 
maximum liquid production decreased. Maximum liquid pro¬ 
duction was obtained using 1200 pounds per square inch and 
470 °C• The contact time based upon the volume of ethylene 
reacting was about 5 minutes. The liquids obtained from 
the static experiments were turbid and dark in color, 60 
to 70 percent of it boiling below 200 °C, and 90 percent 
below 300 °G. The liquid hydrocarbons from the continuous 
plant were light straw colored, 80 to 86 percent boiling 
below 200 °C. 

Egloff and Schaad (6) obtained a mixture of 
liquid hydrocarbons, which represented 78 percent of the

ethylene, by passing ethylene through a steel tube at 
430 °C and under 1000 pounds per square inch. 

Stanley (25) used catalysts of aluminum chloride 
and boron fluoride in the conversion of olefins to syn¬ 
thetic lubricating oils. The olefins were converted at 
temperatures below 100 °C when operating under pressure 
and in the presence of these catalysts. 

Atkinson and Storch (1) polymerized ethylene 
(97.11 percent pure) using a temperature of about 390 °C 
and pressures up to 1000 pounds per square inch. The 
liquid product obtained was pale yellow in color, having 
a greenish fluorescence, and on distillation the oil boiled 
uniformly from 20° to 300 °C, about 50 percent distilling 
below 150 °C* The highest yield of liquid polymer was 
about 30 percent by weight. 

The literature relative to the polymerization 
of ethylene at atmospheric pressure has been extensively 
reviewed by Egloff and Wilson (9) and by Hurd (13). The 
yield of liquid products when olefins are polymerized at 
atmospheric pressure is much lower than when elevated 
pressures are used, because a high temperature must be 
used in the former which promotes cracking and the form¬ 
ation of saturated gaseous hydrocarbons. 

Frolich and Wiezevich (11) compared the liquid 
production from simultaneous cracking and polymerization

at atmospheric pressure, cracking at atmospheric pressure 
for maximum unsaturates followed by polymerization at high 
pressure and lower temperature, and cracking at atmospheric 
pressure followed by removal of the hydrogen by selective 
oxidation over copper oxide and then polymerization at 
high pressure and low temperature* 

They found that the yield of light oil was much 
higher and the amount of tar formed was much less where 
hydrogen was removed than in the other two cases* The 
efficiency was about 78 percent. An explanation of the 
detrimental effect of hydrogen may be offered on the basis 
of the Hague and Wheeler mechanism. The primary products 
are unstable open chain olefins and diolefins which react 
further to produce stable bodies with the elimination of 
hydrogen. In the presence of hydrogen the stabilizing 
reactions will be retarded, the unstable compounds follow¬ 
ing an alternative reaction leading to the formation of 
carbon and tar. 

It was found that the liquids obtained by poly¬ 
merization at atmospheric pressure were aromatic while 
those from polymerization under high pressure were decidedly 
non aromatic. 

Sullivan, Ruthruff and Kuentzel (26) investigated 
the polymerization of pure ethylene and pure propylene in 
the pressure range 500 to 3000 pounds per square inch, at

temperatures varying from 343° to 454 °C, and times of 
contact of from 1 to 105 minutes. Liquid yields of 70 
to 80 percent, based on the ethylene charged, were ob¬ 
tained under optimum conditions, the major portion of the 
liquid falling within the motor-fuel boiling range. It 
was found that the liquid yield increased with increasing 
time of contact, the optimum times being between 8 and 
28 minutes depending upon the temperature and pressure, 
after which further increases in the time of contact 
resulted in no further increases in liquid yield. The 
conversion of propylene to liquid products was somewhat 
less than that of ethylene, being from 60 to 65 percent 
of the propylene charged. 

Ipatieff (16) found that propylene polymerized 
readily in the presence of liquid phosphoric acid, the 
presence of the more reactive butylenes aiding the poly¬ 
merization. A mechanism was suggested for the polymeri¬ 
zation which involved the formation of intermediate esters 
of phosphoric acid. 

Ipatieff and Pines (19) polymerized ethylene 
under high pressures in the presence of 90 percent phos¬ 
phoric acid. The liquid products were a mixture of para¬ 
ffinic, olefinic, naphthenic, and aromatic hydrocarbons. 
Thermal polymerization in the absence of phosphoric acid 
did not yield aromatic hydrocarbons. The polymerization 
of ethylene was carried out between temperatures of 250°

to 330 °C and under initial ethylene pressures of 50 and 
65 atmospheres. 

Malishev (22) described the use of a mixture of 
phosphorus pentoxide, cresol and lampblack as a catalyst 
for the direct alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with 
olefins. Bensene was ethylated by means of ethylene at 
250 °C and a pressure of 27 atmospheres giving mono and 
hexaethyl benzenes. 

Ipatieff and Grosse (18) obtained the direct 
alkylation of paraffins by olefins in the presence of 
catalysts. They found that the reaction consisting of the 
addition of one, two or more molecules of olefin to the 
paraffin, took place under very mild conditions in the 
presence of boron fluoride, finely divided metallic nickel 
and small quantities of water. The reaction proceeded at 
a temperature of 30 °C and 5 to 20 atmospheres pressure. 

The direct alkylation of naphthenic hydrocarbons 
with olefins was demonstrated by Ipatieff, Komarewsky and 
Grosse (21). The alkylation took place at 50° to 75 °C 
under 5 to 15 atmospheres pressure in the presence of 
boron fluoride or aluminum chloride. 

Ipatieff, Pines and Komarewsky (20) used 85 to 
89 percent orthophosphoric acid as a catalyst for the 
direct alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, 
naphthalene, and tetrahydronaphthalene. Temperatures up

to 300 °C at atmospheric pressure were used for the 
alkylation with ethylene. 

This review is far from complete, dealing 
principally with the later work only, and of that leaving 
out most of the industrial and technical investigations. 
The amount of work done in recent years is very extensive 
from the viewpoint of the development of industrial pro¬ 
cesses, and the patent claims are numerous. From the 
point of view of the present thesis, a review of this 
work is superfluous.

The apparatus used in the polymerization of the 
cracked gas under static conditions is shown in figure 5. 

A recording pressure gauge, A, gave the pressure-time 
record of an experiment. This gauge was calibrated by 
comparison with a dead weight piston gauge calibrated at 
the National Physical Laboratory, England. The cylind¬ 
rical reactor, B, machined from austenitic, high nickel, 
chromium steel was 15/8 inches inside diameter and 
11 l/4 inches inside length. The reactor was heated by a 
split multiple-unit electric furnace, the temperature being

measured by a calibrated iron-constantan thermocouple 
inserted in the thermocouple well of the reactor. The 
temperatures of the reaction chamber were recorded to 
1 2°C and controlled to ± 2 °C by a potentiometer type 
recording controller actuating the necessary relays in 
the heating circuit. The expansion valve into the con¬ 
densers, C, was electrically heated to prevent freezing. 
The condensers were immersed in ice-water mixtures and in 
some cases in a salt-ice mixture. Any vapors which were 
not condensed in, C, ?/ere caught in the charcoal tower, D. 

The reactor, B, and the electric furnace were 
mounted on a motor operated rocker to ensure mixing of 
the liquid and gas phases. 

The high pressure steel connecting tubing, 
l/l6 inches by l/4 inches, valves and connections were 
generally of the type described by Ernst (10). A l/8 inch 
copper tube, coiled into a spiral of three turns about 
12 inches in diameter, made connection from the reactor 
to the gas supply, and served to absorb the motion of the 
reactor during agitation. 

Continuous Flow 

The set up for the continuous flow experiments 
was exactly the same as for the static experiments except 
that the reactor, B, was replaced by that shown diagram- 
matically in figure 6. This reactor was placed in a

vertical position and consisted of a steel tube 9 inches 
long, 7/8 inches diameter and l/4 inch bore. This was 
surrounded by a lead bath, to ensure uniform heating over 
its length, into which a calibrated iron-constantan thermo¬ 
couple was introduced to measure the temperature. The lead 
bath was heated electrically, temperature control being 
the same as described above for the static experiments. 

In addition a capillary-tube type flowmeter was 
inserted between the charcoal tower and the gas holder. 

Procedure. 

Static 

The two condensers were weighed and attached as 
in the diagram, both being cooled by a water-ice mixture. 
Freshly activated charcoal was placed in the container, D, 
and was weighed. A weighed quantity of liquid medium was 
introduced into the reactor and a tight leak-proof closure 
was obtained by the use of an annealed copper gasket 
between the head and the body. Agitation of the reactor 
was started and the olefin containing gas, which was pre¬ 
viously analyzed, was pumped in until the required pressure 
was obtained. The heat was then turned on and the temper¬ 
ature was kept constant at that desired until the reaction 
was over. The pressure, as recorded on the pressure gauge, 
rose to a maximum and then fell, as the reaction proceeded,

until finally it remained constant. The heated expansion 
valve was then adjusted carefully and the products were 
drawn off through the two condensers and the charcoal ab¬ 
sorber. The off-gas was stored in a calibrated water- 
sealed gas holder. The condensers and charcoal, containing 
any liquid products, were reweighed and the amount of oil 
collected in the condensers was noted. The increase in 
weight of the charcoal was due to absorption of both oil 
and gases. Commonly the gain in weight of charcoal was 
small and almost entirely due to gases. The off-gas was 
analyzed in a Burrell gas analysis apparatus. 

Blank experiments were made in which the pro¬ 
cedure was exactly as above only natural gas was used in 
place of the olefin containing gas. 

Continuous Flow 

The procedure for polymerization by continuous 
flow was practically the same as for the static method. 

For pressures up to about 1000 pounds per square inch the 
required pressure of gas in the reactor was maintained 
directly from the compressor. For higher pressures the 
gas was compressed into a steel cylinder and then a mixture 
of glycerin and water was pumped in until the required 

pressure vms reached. The condensers and charcoal absorber 

S' 

were weighed and assembled as in figure t and the reactor 

6 

(figure t) was heated to the required temperature. For 




















































.

the lower pressure experiments the valve leading from the 
compressor was then opened and the required pressure was 
maintained in the reactor by keeping the pressure of the 
gas fed to the compressor constant. The compressor in this 
case was run continuously. For the higher pressure experi¬ 
ments the intake valve was connected directly to the high 
pressure storage and the pressure was kept constant by 
pumping glycerin-water mixture into the tank at intervals. 
The expansion valve was then opened until the required 
rate of flow, as indicated by the flowmeter, was obtained. 
The liquid products were condensed and retained by the two 
ice-cooled condensers, any uncondensable vapors and higher 
hydrocarbons being absorbed by the activated charcoal. 

The efficiency of recovery of oils was not 100 percent. 
Unavoidable small losses occurred, some oil being left in 
the reactor and tubing and small losses may have occurred 
in the collecting system. The data tabled later show 
actual recoveries. The off-gas passed on and was collected 
in a calibrated water-sealed gas holder. As before the 
condensers and charcoal were reweighed and the amount of 
oil collected in the condensers was noted. The off-gas 
was analyzed in a Burrell gas analysis apparatus.

Analytical Methods * 

The liquid products were fractionally distilled 
from a vacuum-jacketed fractionating column for the lower 
boiling fractions, and from a Cooper and Fasce microfrac- 
tionating column for higher boiling fractions* Liquids 
that boiled above ISO °C were distilled from a 25 cem. 
distilling flask, using an air condenser. For liquids of 
very low boiling point, such as the naphthas, an ice con¬ 
denser was used. 

The initial temperature was noted and that for 
every cubic centimeter of distillate and the final boiling 
point. The distillate was collected in 5 com. fractions 
in small graduated cylinders. 

The refractive index of each fraction was deter¬ 
mined in a Pulfrich refractometer. 

The solubility of the oil in concentrated sul¬ 
furic acid, which is an indication of the degree of unsat¬ 
uration of the oil, was determined by the U.S. Bureau of 
Mines method, using Babcock tubes and centrifugal separation 
Two cubic centimeters of the oil were introduced by means 
of a pipette into Babcock bottles of about 100 ccm. capacity. 
Five cubic centimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid was 
added and the bottles shaken vigorously to hasten the 
reaction between the unsaturated oils and sulfuric acid. 

The mixture was then cooled by ice and distilled water was

added until the upper graduation mark on the neck of the 
bottle was reached* The bottle and contents were 
centrifuged to separate the oil from the water and the 
amount of saturated oil was read directly from the 
graduations. 

The samples were labeled and stored for observ¬ 
ation of gum formation or color change due to instability.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 


The experimental results will be presented 
separately;for the different media under static condit¬ 
ions, for the continuous flow under high pressures and at 
atmospheric pressure. A comparison will then be attempted 
between the different methods as to relative yields of 
liquid products. 

No Liquid Medium. 

The results in which no liquid medium was used 
are presented in detail in Table III. The operating 
conditions and the analysis for propylene, ethylene and 
hydrogen for both the charged gas and the gaseous products 
are shown. The weight of liquid products and the amount 
of liquid expressed as percentage of the olefin content 
of the in-gas, as percentage of olefins reacted, and as 
percentage of propane used originally are indicated. The 
olefin reacted was taken as the difference between the qua¬ 
ntity of olefins in the in-gas and the quantity in the off¬ 
gas. For the calculation of the liquid yield as percentage 
. 

of propane originally used, data from a weight-balance 
experiment from the pyrolysis of propane was used, in 
which all the reactants and products were determined by 
weight. From this data the weight of propane required

to produce any desired weight of olefins may he calcul¬ 
ated, assuming that the pyrolysis stage yields the same 
proportion of products at all times. The reaction time 
was arbitrarily taken as the interval between the time 
at which the reactor reached 400 °0 until the pressure 
was constant. 

In all cases the pressure rose with the temper¬ 
ature to a maximum and then fell during the course of the 
reaction until a final steady state was reached. The 
pressure-time relationships are shown in figure 7 for a 
number of different temperatures. At the lower tempera¬ 
tures the maximum pressure does not show such a sharp 
peak as at higher temperatures and the rate of decrease 
in pressure was much slower. This indicates that the 
velocity of the reation was much greater at the higher 
temperatures. The total pressure drop was also greater 
at the higher temperatures. The arrows to the curves 
indicate the time at which the operating temperature was 
reached. The reaction evidently started before the 
operating temperature was reached for those experiments 
at temperatures above 420 °C while at 420 °C and below 
the maximum pressure was attained where the operating 
temperature was reached. 

The amount of olefins reacted was between 71 
and 72 percent except for experiment 4 at a temperature of

348 °C in which only 18 percent reacted, and experiment 
40. It is evident that the temperature was too low at 
348 °C for polymerization to take place at a reasonable 
rate. A much higher yield of liquids was obtained in 
experiment 40 than in experiment 9. This may be due to 
the fact that in the other reactions the walls of the 
reaction chamber were coated with carbon which may act 
catalytically in the polymerization of olefins to liquid 
products. Experiment 40 was carried out at a much later 
date than its duplicate, experiment 9, with the reactor 
freshly cleaned. The other experiments in Table III were 
carried out with small amounts of carbon forming a film 
over the interior surface of the reactor. Evidently carbon 
promotes undesirable reactions. 

The maximum yield of oil of 9.76 gm./lOO gm. of 
propane was obtained at a temperature of 450 °C and a max¬ 
imum pressure of 3565 pounds per square inch. Referring 
to Table III, a correlation between pressure-drop and 
yield is obvious, the pressure drop, moreover, being a 
maximum at 450 °C. An explanation may be supplied ftom a 
consideration of the reactions involved. 

At low temperatures, polymerization is the princi¬ 
pal reaction and its velocity is slow. Further, its temp¬ 
erature coefficient will be small, the reaction being of 
second or higher orders. The disruptive and the dehydro-

genation reactions giving undesirable results are sup¬ 
pressed by pressure up to moderate temperatures almost 
entirely but, being first order, generally have a large 
temperature coefficient of velocity. With rising temper¬ 
ature, the undesirable reactions increase in extent more 
rapidly than do the polymerization reactions, and ulti¬ 
mately they predominate. A temperature of 450 °C appears 
to be an optimum point, the amount of polymerization taking 
place being greatest relative to the amount of decomposi¬ 
tion taking place. 

At the low temperature of 348 °C the yield, based 
on reacted olefins, was 52.5 percent, higher than in any 
experiment except No. 40. However the amount of olefins 
that reacted was small being only 18 percent. While the 
low temperature prevented decomposition of the products, 
the desirable reactions were slowed up greatly. 

The liquid products obtained in these experiments 
possessed a yellow color, with a typical greenish fluor¬ 
escence of petroleum oils. The oils from all the experi¬ 
ments were united and distilled as described previously; 
the results being shown in Table VII. Up to 350 °C there 
was no indication of cracking, showing the stability of 
these oils. The lower boiling fractions were water white 
in color while the higher boiling fractions were clear 
yellow, and on standing several months exposed to sunlight

the oils did not darken or form a deposit of gum. This 
was a definite indication that the oils formed by this 
method of polymerization were quite stable. The lower 
boiling fractions were found to be higher in unsaturation 
than the higher boiling fractions as indicated by the sol¬ 
ubility in 98 percent sulfuric acid. 

Tetralin Medium 

The results of the experiments which were carried 
out with about 100 gr. of tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin) 
present as the liquid medium are shown in Table IV. Again 
the yield of liquid products was low at the lower temper- 
atures but were still much higher than from the experiments 
with no liquid medium present. The maximum yield of 22.1 
g». oil/100 gm. of propane was obtained at a temperature 
of 422 °C and a maximum pressure of 2650 pounds per square 
inch. These operating conditions were somewhat milder 
than those necessary to produce the maximum liquid yield 
in the experiments where no liquid medium was used. The 
high yield may be explained by the fact that the tetralin 
decomposed to a certain extent at this temperature yield¬ 
ing hydrogen which would hydrogenate the unsaturated 
primary liquid polymers to more stable saturated oils and 
thus the loss due to cracking to gaseous hydrocarbons would 
be minimized. This explanation was borne out in the 
results of the unsaturation value of the oils (Table VII)

as determined by solubility in sulfuric acid. The oils 
from the tetralin experiments were much more saturated 
than those from the experiments without a liquid medium. 

Blank experiments (20 and 21) were performed at 
425 °C and 448 °C using natural gas in place of the olefin 
containing gas. The pressure rose with the temperature 
until the operating temperature was reached and then 
remained practically constant. A certain amount of tetr¬ 
alin decomposed to liberate the hydrogen reported in the 
off-gas. Reference to Table VII will show that there 
was little decomposition of tetralin as judged by distill¬ 
ation analysis. The oils from experiments 20 and 21 
resemble the crude tetralin more than they do the oils 
produced in the presence of olefins as in experiments 15 
to 18. 

The pressure-time relationships for the tetralin 
experiments are shown graphically in figure 8. At 373 °C 
the reaction was very slight as indicated by the gentle 
slope of the curve after the maximum pressure was reached. 
The curve has two maxima because the temperature was 
held initially at 350 °C for twenty minutes. Since no 
reaction was in evidence by a pressure drop, the temper¬ 
ature was raised to 373 °C. At 395 °C the reaction was 
much more rapid while at 422° and 448 °G the pressure drop 
was quite abrupt. At 448 °C the liquid products first 
formed cracked to gaseous hydrocarbons to a certain extent

as shown by the increase in pressure after the polymeri¬ 
zation reaction was complete# 

In these experiments as with the experiments with 
no liquid medium present about 71 to 72 percent of the 
olefins reacted at the optimum operating conditions. At 
lower temperatures a smaller percentage of the olefins 
reacted but more of the olefins that did react remained as 
liquid products than at the higher temperatures. The true 
efficiency of the process is measured by the g». oil/100 
gin. of olefin reacted. The figure 83.5 for experiment 17, 
which does not include lost material, may be compared with 
61 for experiment 40, and the lower figures in Table III. 

The distillation range of the liquid products is 
shown in Table VII. There was very little low boiling 
liquid formed, most of the liquid product evidently being 
high boiling. The oils were fairly stable, not cracking 
until the temperature was as high as 250 °C. This temp¬ 
erature was considerably lower than that at which the oils 
produced in the absence of a liquid medium cracked. The 
solubility in sulfuric acid of the liquid products was 
not so high, however, indicating that most of the unsat¬ 
urated oils had been hydrogenated to more stable saturated 
oils.

Benzene Medium. 

The amount of benzene used as liquid medium was 
varied from 50 to 87 grams to give approximately the same 
maximum pressure at the different temperatures. The re¬ 
sults of these experiments are summarized in Table V. At 
400 °C no liquid product was obtained while at 447 °C, 

7.12 gir). oil/100 gsw of propane was found and at 488 °C, 
3.06 gai. oil/100 gm. of propane was obtained. The percent¬ 
age of olefins reacted in the experiments at the higher 
temperatures was approximately the same as that for both 
the previous series of experiments but the araount of oil 
produced was much less. This may be due to the high vapor 
pressure of benzene which lowered the partial pressure of 
the hydrogen to such an extent that very little hydrogen¬ 
ation of the unstable unsaturated liquid products to 
stable saturated oils took place. As a result they cracked 
to gaseous hydrocarbons at this temperature. A blank 
experiment with natural gas again gave no pressure change 
and reaction was negligible. 

The curves shown in figure 9 indicate that at 
400 °C the reaction was very slight while at 447 °G the 
pressure drop was very rapid, showing considerable reaction 
and polymerization to be taking place. At 488°0 the 
pressure drop was not as much as at 447 °C showing that 
the liquid that was forming was being cracked to gaseous

hydrocarbons of lower molecular weight. 

The results from the distillation of the condensate 
from these experiments are shorn in Table ¥11. The boiling 
ranges differed very little from that of the benzene 
alone, a small portion boiling above the benzene range. 

These oils resembled A more than the tetralin oils except 
in regard to solubility in sulfuric acid. The fractions 
from experiments 30, 31 and 32, boiling above 78 °C were 
united and distilled. This fraction representing the oil 
produced in the experiments was quite stable since no 
cracking was observed until a temperature of 240 °C was 
reached. This oil was quite unsaturated, 14 percent being 
soluble in sulfuric acid. The reason for this high un¬ 
saturation has been discussed above. 

^Nauhtha Medium. 

When naphtha was used as the liquid medium the 
yield of oil was very low. About 16 gm. of naphtha 
(boiling uniformly from 32° to 100 °C) was employed and 
temperatures of 447° and 486 °C giving maximum pressures 
of about 3100 pounds per square inch. From Table ¥1 it 
may be seen that at 477 °G the oil yield was 3.5 and 0.95 
gm./lOQ guv. of propane while at 486 °C there was no 
increase in liquid. The olefins reacted at 447 °C was 68 to 
70 percent and at 486 °C the drop in olefin concentration 
was quite large, but it is obvious that the majority of the

olefins must have been pyrolysed to saturated gaseous 
hydrocarbons and carbon. The reason for low liquid yields 
was thought to be the same as for the case of the benzene 
medium in that since naphtha has such a high vapor pressure 
the partial pressure of hydrogen was low with a result that 
very little hydrogenation to stable oils took place. The 
blank runs with natural gas behaved as before giving no 
pressure drop. 

The pressure-time curves shown in figure 10 show 
that at 486 °C the reaction was quite rapid but as time 
increased the pressure increased, indicating cracking. 

At 447 °C there was a large pressure drop and cracking 
was apparently not so extensive as at the higher temper¬ 
ature . 

The data on the distillation and properties of the 
liquid products are presented in Table VII. The naphtha 
originally boiled between the limits 32° to 100 °C while 
after undergoing reaction the product boiled up to an 
upper limit of 270 °C. The solubility in sulfuric acid 
was quite high, the fraction boiling below 100 °C being 
12 percent soluble, and the fraction boiling above 100 °C 
being 18 percent soluble, Y/hich indicated a high percent¬ 
age of unsaturates in the oil.

. Naphthalene Medium* 

Experiments were carried out with naphthalene as 
the medium and with mixtures of naphthalene and tetralin. 
Difficulty was experienced in drawing off the products 
when the reaction was complete due to the solidification 
of the naphthalene. Pressure drops similar to that ob¬ 
tained with the other media were obtained. The off-gas 
analysis showed that a large percentage of the olefins 
had reacted while the hydrogen content did not change 
appreciably. No estimate of oil production could be made. 

Continuous Flow Experiments. 

Continuous flow experiments were tried at a pres¬ 
sure of 1130 pounds per square inch, at various rates of 
flow and at temperatures from 300° to 450 °C. The yield 
of liquid products was negligible the maximum being 1.2 
gr\. oil/100 gm. of propane at a temperature of 450 °C 
and 80 com./minute flow. It was evident that the pressure 
was too Ioy/ to cause polymerization at the temperatures 
and the time of contact used. 

The pressure was raised to 2665 pounds per square 
inch and rates of flow of 86.3 and 119.5 ccm/minute, which 
gave contact times of 5.47 and 4.27 minutes respectively, 
were tried at 450 °C. The results of these two experi¬ 
ments are sho\Yn in Table VIII. The percentage of olefins 
that reacted ?/as much lower than that obtained in the

static experiments under similar conditions but the oil 
production from the olefins that reacted was quite high, 
about 70 percent going to oils. Since the off-gas con¬ 
tained a goodly percentage of olefins (15 percent), re¬ 
circulation would have increased the yield of oil consider¬ 
ably. The yield of liquid products was 12.8 and 11.2 gm. 
oil/100 gai. of propane for these two experiments which is 
appreciably greater than the yield obtained in the static 
experiments under similar conditions and with no liquid 
medium present. 

The boiling range of the liquids produced by the 
continuous flow method was lower than for those from the 
static experiments. The oils were quite unstable, cracking 
being in evidence at 140 °C and on standing the oils 
darkened in color and gum was deposited. From the sharp 
odor it is quite probable that a large percentage of the 
oil was made up of diolefins. The high solubility in 
sulfuric acid of 14 to 20 percent indicates that the oil 
had a high olefin content. Therefore it is apparent 
that the oils produced in these experiments are inferior 
in quality to those produced in the static experiments. 

Two experiments, one at 650 °C and rate of flow 
of 108 com./minute and the other at 860 °G and 106 com/ 
minute flow were performed at atmospheric pressure. The 
apparatus used was the same as that used in the pyrolysis

of propane, the reactor being a quartz tube. The results 
are presented in Table IX. 

At 650 °C the olefin content of the gas did not 
decrease to a large extent during the reaction and the 
hydrogen content remained practically constant. There 
was no tar or tar-fog formed but a small amount of a 
clear water-white liquid was retained by the tar trap and 
condenser. This liquid had the sharp intensive odor of 
diolefins. The charcoal adsorber gained in weight 10.44 
grv. and on distillation with steam up to 340 °C about 
1 com. of a dark yellow oil was obtained. The total 
yield of liquid productswas 1.82 gn./lOO gm. of propane. 
There was a large quantity of gas evolved during distill¬ 
ation of the charcoal which on analysis showed a high 
percentage of olefins. 

In the experiment at 860 °C about 61 percent of 
the olefins introduced underwent reaction. There was a 
steady stream of brown tar-fog formed which was deposited 
in the tar trap. A small amount of water-white liquid 
collected in the water condenser. The charcoal increased 
in weight only 1.95 gn. and on steam distillation at 
340 °C gave only a small amount of a greenish oil. The 
quantity of gas evolved during distillation was much less 
than that-from the charcoal of the experiment at 650 °C 
and was not nearly so high in olefin content. 








64 


The total yield of liquid products from the 
experiment at 860 °C was 9.3 gai./lOO g®. of propane but 
most of this was represented by the brown tar. 

Increased rate cf flow in the latter experiment 
would have cut down the extent of tar formation and 
increased the liquid yield. At the rate of flow used 
the gas was heated for too long a time and the extent of 
polymerization was too great.

CONCLUSIONS 


The results of these experiments may he conven¬ 
iently compared by the data in Table X. From this table 
one may see that in all cases, but the flow experiments, 
approximately 70 percent of the olefins introduced into 
the autoclave reacted, while the amount of liquid product 
varied widely. 

The results are not unexpected and offer some 
evidence on the mechanism of the reactions taking place. 

It may be assumed that the primary reactions are two, 
hydrogenation of the olefins with the formation of para¬ 
ffins, and polymerization of the olefins with the formation 
of unstable higher olefins. Of these concurrent reactions 
the former is slow and incomplete while the latter is rel¬ 
atively rapid and tends to go to completion. However, the 
higher olefins formed are unstable and may polymerize 
further to very complex molecules or decompose, if given 
sufficient time, to yield carbon and gaseous paraffins. 

At low temperatures they may form stable naphthenes, but 
slowly. 

The action of tetralin is one of stabilization. 
Tetralin is known to be an efficient agent in the promotion 
of hydrogenation reactions. Its action is similar to that

of a hydrogen carrier, reducing rapidly any unsaturated 
body in solution, the dehydrogenated tetralin being more 
slowly reduced by gaseous hydrogen if available. A high 
yield of stable liquid would result from such action. 

In the absence of any medium, the reaction is 
one of polymerization, stabilization being effected by 
gaseous hydrogen. The stabilizing action of hydrogen, 
however, is slow and sufficient time elapses for some de- 
compositon of the liquid olefins, with a consequent low 
yield. It is suspected that the carbon deposited from the 
decomposition reactions is autocatalytic from the results 
of experiments 9 and 40. Further evidence is obtained 
from experiments 48 and 49 in Table VIII. Here the time 
of contact was much less than in the static experiments 
of Table III. Less time is available for all reactions 
so the most rapid, polymerization, would be favored. The 
percentage of olefins reacted is less, but the yield of 
liquid is greater than in the static experiments. However, 
the oils are much less stable, showing incomplete reaction 
and lack of stabilizing reactions. The decreased amount 
of reaction in the continuous experiments, together with 
the high yields of oil may be explained by reference to 
the hydrogenation of gaseous olefins which occurs slowly 
as a primary reaction. The loss of olefins by the formation 
of paraffins in this way would be more extensive in the 











68 


longer static experiments than in the flow experiments. 
Hence a larger proportion of the olefins that react would 
enter into polymerization reactions in the flow experi¬ 
ments than in the static experiments. 

The inferior action of naphtha and benzene may 
be attributed in part to their volatility. Under the 
conditions used, both would be present as vapor, their 
partial pressures being an appreciable part of the total 
pressure. The result is a decrease in the effective 
pressure of hydrogen and a consequent reduction in stab¬ 
ilizing action. The naphtha appeared to be most detri¬ 
mental. Naphtha is much more volatile than benzene and 
at the same time less stable. The losses in the recovery 
system were probably larger. These factors would explain 


the detrimental action of naphtha. 

No fair comparison between experiment 51, at 
atmospheric pressure, and the others under pressure, can 
be made. It may be pointed out, however, that the pre¬ 
dominant reaction will be polymerization, hydrogenation 
being negligible at atmospheric pressure. Consequently 
unstable oils should result. The extent of reaction will 
depend upon the temperature, while the survival of the 
liquids will depend principally on the time of contact. 


High yields have been obtained in other work at atmospheric 
pressure but the oils produced were highly unsaturated and

required considerable further treatment before becoming 
of value. 

In these preliminary experiments, no particular 
search was made for and no evidence was obtained for 
direct alkylation. It is doubtful if the conditions were 
such as to promote direct union of the olefins with the 
media used. There is little doubt that catalysts, such 
as reported by Ipatieff and other workers and discussed 
previously, are necessary to cause direct alkylation. 

The refractive indices are of some interest in 
throwing light on the nature of the liquids recovered. 

The value of 1.45 for the static experiments is higher 
than that common for paraffins, and lower than that for 
aromatics or cycloparaffins. This suggests, bearing in 
mind the stability of the oils, that the oils are a mix¬ 
ture of paraffins and cycloparaffins. 

The oils from the flow experiments, Table VIII, 
were much less stable, contained probably more olefins, 
and showed a lower refractive index. 

The oil from the naphtha had a higher refractive 
index than the original, from the benzene, a lov^er re¬ 
fractive index than the benzene used and from the tetralin 
about the same as the crude tetralin. These observations 
confirm roughly the conclusion that the oils are naph¬ 
thenic in character. 















70 


From the practical point of view, the results 
show some promise# At least further investigation appears 
warranted in connection with the action of tetralin in 
particular# The most important practical result is the 
demonstration that hydrogen is not particularly detrimental, 
and in fact appears to play an important role in aiding 
the production of high quality oils. Yields are comparable 
with reported commercial yields, reaching as they do more 
than 20 pounds of oil per 1000 cubic feet of propane, and 
it is certain that they can be increased substantially.

SUMMARY* 


The maximum yield of olefins from the pyrolysis 
of propane at atmospheric pressure was 37.2 percent in 
the exit gas along with 12.2 percent of hydrogen. The 
optimum conditions for this yield were at a temperature 
of 820 °C and a rate of flow of 400 ccm. per minute. 

Polymerization at high temperatures and at 
high pressures was attempted both by a static method and 
by a continuous flow method. In the static method tetralin, 
benzene, naphtha and naphthalene were used as liquid 
media to produce certain stabilizing effects or further 
desired reactions. 

The maximum yield of liquid products, of 22.1 
g:m./100 gm. of propane used originally, was obtained using 
a tetralin medium at 422 °C and under a maximum pressure 
of 2650 pounds per square inch. 

About 72 percent of the olefins reacted at 
suitable temperatures and pressures in all the static 
experiments. 

The maximini yield of liquid products from the 
continuous flow experiments at high pressure was 12.8 
gn./lQO grw of propane used originally. The optimum 
conditions were, a temperature of 450 °C, a pressure of 



2665 pounds per square inch, and a contact time of 
5.47 minutes. 


72 


The yield of liquid products when the olefins 
were polymerized at atmospheric pressure was very low, 
the chief reaction being the formation of tar. 

The yield of liquid products both by static 
methods and by the continuous flow method at high 
pressures was quite comparable to those reported by other 
workers as reviewed earlier in this work. It is evident 
that higher yields may be obtained in the presence of 
catalysts and still higher if recirculation of the exit 
gas is attempted.
