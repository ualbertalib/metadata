and secondary sources has been indicated wherever 
possible in footnotes* Special acknowledgment is 
hereby gratefully made to the following: 

To the members of my family, for their forbearance 
and helpfulness to me when preparation of this 
thesis v/as a trial to all of them, and more espe™ 
cially to my mother, whose constant concern for the 
adequate and timely completion of this dissertation 
was greater than my own* 

To the Rev* Professor D* J. G. Elson, M. A* B.D., 
M*Th*, for his patience, encouragement and guidance 
despite the pressure of a heavy schedule of official

INTRODUCTION 

This dissertation is not an attempt to deal 
exhaustively with all of Paulas religion, but, as the title 
indicates, with ^^Gentral Aspects of the D^mamic Religion of 
Paul.” ( I dislike the word ^aspect” as heartily as I des¬ 
pise the term "concept” in speaking of anything as vital as 
St. Paul’s religion, but there seems no better word to hand). 
It has been necessary to delimit the area of discussion fur¬ 
ther by approaching the subject through what I regard as 
the most vital elements in Paul’s religion; namely those 
which deal primarily with the pov/er that flows from God to 
man through His righteousness, His Holy Spirit, and His 
Saving love in Christ, and to stress from the manward side 
mainly that faith through which man responds to the out- 
reaching, saving power of God’s love in Christ. To do this 
1 have perforce neglected the development of many themes 
which the reader may Mgitimatel 3 ^ regard as important and 
even central. Yea, when he sa^^s that joy, or faith, or hope 
or life are the key notes of St. Paul’s cry of triumph I 
can onl 3 ^ say Amen I They are all essential, and all so 
tightly bound up with the whole of St. Paul’s thoughts 
that to deal adequately with any one of them leads on to 
the consideration of all the rest, and no rigid lines of 
demarcation can be drawn, for they keep merging into one 
another. I can only defend ray choice by maintaining

that for me, at any rate, the preaching of Paul and the 
religion of Paul is most centrally expressed in the ideas 
which I have named above, and in order to give adequate 
treatment to any of Paulas ideas I have had to limit my 
emphasis t^ them, leaving something to be done by those 
who will doubtless deal more adequately with subjects I 
have not touched. 

The reader will wonder perhaps that there is no 
attempt to consider separately two very important aspects 
of Paulas thought: namely those concerning the Sacraments 
of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, and those v/hich deal with 
his teaching concerning Last Things, or as the Scholars 
would call it, Eschatology. My defense is twofold. First, 

I must confess that I am not in the present work prepared 
to deal adequatedly with the complex and vexed problems 
which arise when one attempts to deal with these subjects 
in any thorough fashion, in view of the immense scholarly 
literature which has been written upon them. Secondly, I 
believe that their essential questions have been treated 
by implication in connection with other questions. 

The central idea of the Sacrements, both bap- 
tism and the Holy Supper, is that of participation (Koinonia, 
Greek ^ o t/'u) x / <^. ) or fellowship in the sufferings and 
death, and in the resurrection and life of Jesus Christ. I 
believe that the stress on the indwelling of the Spirit or 
of the Risen Lord in all the life of the Christian, so that 
all of life is sacramental is really the central reality

which Jesus himself was vividly symbolizing to the Dis¬ 
ciples at the Last Supper. Indeed, I find good company 
for this approach in St. John, who begins the,story of the 
last sacramental fellowship of Jesus with his disciples with 
the washing of the disciples^ feet by their Lord, who com¬ 
mands them, that if he their lord and master washes their 
feet, then to be true disciples of their Lord they must also 
wash one another's feet, humbling themselves in service to 
one another as Jesus himself humbled himself to serve them 
and all mankind. (John 13'1-15*) 

1 have likewise made no attempt to consider the 
complex question of Paulas personal belief concerning 
angels, — principalities ... powers, height, depth. 

Rom. 3^-39> or such occult powers as ”the elemental 
spirits of the universe,^’ or the ^"^pov/er of darkness,or 
^^the Spirit at work in the Sons of Disobedience.” I have 
no doubt that Paul shared the belief of his time (as Luther 
did of his own age) that the whole world, and man within it, 
so long as he was ”in Adam,” was under the dread sway of 
supernatural forces of evil, which held the v/orld in a re¬ 
lentless grip. But I have tried to point out that Paulas 
whole preaching is charged with triumph (Thanks to be God, 
who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” 

ICor 15-57; and with hope (”through the Spirit, by faith, 
we wait for the hope of righteousness.” (Gal. 5 * 5 ) • His 
cry is that of the Old Testament prophet: ”0 Lord our God, 
other lords beside thee have had dominion over us; but

by thee only will we make mention of thy name.” Is. 26:13.) 
”The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me 
free from the law of sin and death.” (Rom. 8:2). By the power 
of God who raised Christ from the dead,we also will be raised 
with him triumphant over all that has held us in slavery and 
doomed us to death. The powers of evil may still combine 
their forces agianst the children of God, but the decisive 
battle has been fought and won by God, through Christ. 

”He disarmed the principalities and powers amd made a public 
example of them, triumphing over them in hifn.” Col. 2 : 15 . 

They ^ho call upon the name of the Lord are no longer subject 
to the evil demonic powers which enthralled them ”in Adam.” 
Christ is their Lord; no other power any longer has Lordship 
over them. And, since by the Spirit we know this triumph 
as a present reality we have in that life of the Spirit the 
gi-nrantee that through whatever sufferings we may pass, God 
will not forsake us, and that we and eventually all Crea- 
tion will be delivered from any vestige of bondage to ”the 
glorious liberty of the children of God.” (Rom. 8:22), 
when Christ shall have put all things under his feet, even 
the last enemy of death (ICor. 15:24-28), and all things, 
even Christ himself, shall be fulfilled under the powder 
and love of God, ”that God may be everything to every one.” 
(ICor. 15:28.) 

A thorough reading of the whole Pauline litera¬ 
ture which has been necessary in this study has led me to 
the tentative conclusion ( on considerations of both style 
and content) that those scholars are correct who maintain

that the so-called Pastoral Epistles (1 and 2 Timothy, and 
Titus) are of other than Pauline authorship, and that very 
possibly the same is true of both Col^osians and Ephesians* 
For this reason vdien adducing evidence for any position 
which I have assumed with regard to the central ideas of 
St. Paul, I have tried to support the argument mainly 
with references to passages in those letters which are gene¬ 
rally ascribed by scholars to Paul himself (namely Romans, 
first and second Corinthians, Galatians, Phillippians, 
first and second Thessalonians, and Philemon). 

It was necessary in the consideration of several 
major themes to enter into a rather full discussion of the 
Old Testament background of these ideas. Where that is the 
case I have attempted to seek the word of competent and re¬ 
cognized authorities, although in one instance at least 
(the section on sacrifice in the Old Testament) the confu¬ 
sion prevailing at St. Stephen’s College library as it was 
in preparation for moving to new quarters rendered certain 
secondary sources inaccessible to me, so that I had to draw 
on my own memory and upon the' primary Old Testament sources 
for my argument. 

This study has been for me a most exhil^ating if 
exacting discipline and adventure into the mind of Paul. 
Nothing in that which I have written can adequately convey 
the way in which this inquiry into the dynamic religion of 
St. Paul has opened out for me more than I had dreamed 
existed of ’’the depth of the riches and wisdom and know¬ 
ledge of God I” (Rom. 11:33)* Paul has become for me a

Man^s Great Need of Righteousness 


A. General Indictment of Man^s Sinfulness. 

B. The Moral Degradation of the Gentiles. 

C. The Failure of the Jev/. 

D. The Impotence of the Law in Rom, 7* 


III The Incompleteness and Expectation of The 

Old Testament in its Quest for Righteousness 23 

A. The Judicial Background, 

1, Basic in all Questions of Right and Wrong 

2, The Judge also a Champion of the Oppressed. 

3, God a ^^Just God and also a Savior.” 

4* Righteousness Equals Salvation. 


B. The Sacrificial Background. 

1. Holiness the Motive, 

2. Sin an Infection to be Isolated and Extermdnated 

3. Sacrifice impotent for ”Sins with a High Hand”. 

C. The Prophetic Background. 

1. Sacrifice without Righteousness an Abomination,

CHAPTER I 
RIGHTEOUSNESS 

Righteousness and its associated ideas are central 
in the writings of St* Paul. The words for righteousness 
which occur most frequently in the Pauline literature (Dikai- 
osune t Mu i o Dikaio i KoLi qO ^ and 

Dikai’^ma ) account for ninety of the one 

hundred and forty-one usages of the same words in the whole 
New Testament. It is further noteworthy that eighty of those 
ninety are found in those letters generally ascribed by New 
Testament scholars to Paul himself, with a heavy preponder¬ 
ance (fifty-three) in Romans.^ 

A. Righteousness as an Attribute of God or Man . 

The Greek use of Dikaiosune ( Kut ), 

and of the related words Dikaios ( Mol o ^ ) 

and Dike ( ^ ) was more social than religious , 

as is seen by a comparison of Hesiod*s Works and Days with 

ii 

the book of the prophet Amos. Righteousness, according to 
the Greek, was basically ®*acting in accordance with Dike; 
that which is customary, sanctioned by social standards,

In general, the sense of dike was doing right by one*s 
neighbour, with the narrower sense of **acting toward your 

i 

neighbour with strict and impartial regard for his merit.'* 

The narrower word-usage colored its general use. 

By contrast, the Septuagint understood Dikaiosune in the 
larger sense as "including such ideas as trustworthiness, 
uprightness, innocence^ in its narrower sense, the judicial 
character." Thus while over a considerable range of usage 
dikaiosune was a fair synonym for the Hebrew word for right¬ 
eousness, Tsedek ( 7 ^ )> it fell short of conveying 

the full meaning of the Hebrew word because the fact that 
•* 7^7.5- is always related to God and His law, rather 

than to social customs and institutions as such, or to ab¬ 
stract principles, gives a different color to its use; and in 
general it would probably be true to say that for the 

Hebrew righteousness tends to be m.ore inward, humane, and 

ii. 

more inclusive than for the Greek." Dodd goes on to say 

that the Pauline use of Dikaiosune, dikaios and dikaion 
*^must be understood in the light of Septuagintal usage and 

the underlying Hebrew.....The Greek words are for him always 

iii. 

colored by their Hebrew association. A close study 

of these words in Paul*s letters bears out Dodd’s contention.

I can find no instance in Paul’s letters where these words 
appear in their Greek sense only 5 and the closest approach 
to such usage is found in Ephesians and in the Pastoral 
episties. 

1. Righteousness as upri^tness, Rigiitness, the quality 
of being Just is seen in the following passages. Note in 
each case the reference to Godward. ITh. 2:10$ 2Th. 1:65 
Rom. 6:75 7:125 8:45 Rom. 1:17 and Gal. 3:115 Phil. 1:75 
Eph. 6 : 8-105 6:l(Cf. Ex.20:12 )5 Col. 4:15 ITim. 6:11 (man 
of God) 5 2 Tim. 2:22 (along with all those who call upon 
the Lord from a pure heart) 5 2Tim. 4:85 Tit. 1:7-8 

Tit. 2:11-12. An interesting and unusual expression is 
found in the Greek of ICor. 16:34: ’’Come to your right 
mind ( tx ) and sin no more. For 

some have no knowledge of God.” 

2. Ri^teousness as Benevolence. Skinner traces the ten¬ 
dency in later Judaism for Tsedek ( X ) to be iden¬ 
tified with Chesed ( ) mercy. He sees this both in 

individual dealings and in the judicial usage 5 and notes that 
it ceased to stand for a judicial attribute in the proper 

sense, but became rather ”a consideration which comes in to 

i 

moderate the operation of strict justice ( V )•** The 

two ideas eventually became polarized until they were incom¬ 
patible, and ” the name yj'p y ^ was appropriated to that

which, strictly speaking, has nothing to do with the judge’s 
functions at all.” i 

We see the influence of late Judaism (likely through the Sep«- 
tuagint) in 2Cor. 9•9-10. There Paul, as he urges the Corin¬ 
thians to give generously for the relief of the poor saints 
at Jerusalem, uses dikaiosune with reference both to God and 
man in a sense which allows the English word ’’Benevolence as an 
accurate rendering of Paul’s meaning. This is a far cr^'- from 
the Greek concept of justice as merely doing right to one’s 
neighbour, or of ’’acting tov/ard your neighbour with strict 
and impartial regard for his merit, ii Indeed, for descri¬ 
bing the relations which God rightly expects to prevail 
among the brothers, Dike gives place to Agape, love. 

(See Chapter 

B. Righteousness as Personified Power. 

There are several references to righteousensv in 
the Pauline literature**which the exact reference of ’’right- 
eousness is not clearly specified, but where it seems to 
mean more than mere justice or uprightness; indeed almost a 
personified force, and even a surrogate or substitute for 
the divine name. Note how Paul describes to the Corinthians 
how he had commended his labors among them: 

’’with truthful speef.ch, and the power of God 

with the wea,_ons of righteousness for the right 

hand and for the left.” 2Cor. 6:7

A similar passage is found in Ephesians 6:14—“Having put on 
the breastplate of righteousness,”' which in Is. 11:5, 69:17, 
and in the Wisdom of Solomon 6:18 is described as part of the 
divine armor. Again in 2Cor. 6:14: “Do not be mismated with 
unbelievers. For what partnership have 
righteuusness and iniquity? 

Or what fellowship has light with darkness? 

What accord has Christ with Belial? 

Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 

What agreement has 

the temple of God with idols?” 

I have quoted this passage in this peculiar fashion to bring 
out the latent Hebrew parallelism which I think Paul is 
deliberately employing in both Corinthian passages. In 2Cor. 
6:7 (quoted on p.4) the weapons of righteousness are equated 
with the power of God, and in the above passage we see an 
antithetical parallelism between righteousness, as the power 
of God in Christ within the believer, and iniquity, the 
demonic power of darkness working in the unbelieving world, 
which finds its ultimate expression in the worship of other 
gods (cf. ch. 2 B ii). In harmony with this interpretation 
is the passage found in 2Cor. 11:13-15: “such men are false 
apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles 
of Christ. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself 
as an angel of light. So it is not strange if his servants 
also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness.”

Especially significant in this connection is Paul’s call to 
the new life, in the sixth chapter of Romans (cf. also Eph. 
4:24)* Just as iin is the personification of the power of the 
forces of evil which once held sway in his life, so righteous¬ 
ness is the personification of the power of God’s grace under 
which the Christian is now called to live. The whole of 
Romans 6:12-23 is impregnated with this idea, but a few selec¬ 
ted passages will serve to point up this interpretation: 


“Let not sin therefore reigh in your mortal bodies, to make 
you obey their passions.” 

Do not yield yourselves to sin But yield yourselves to 

as instruments of wickedness, God, as men brought from 

death to life, and your 
members to God, as instru¬ 
ments of righteousness.” 

vs.13. 


“You are slaves of the one you obey. 


either of sin, which leads 
to death, 

Christians, 

“having been set free from 
sin. 

Their members once yielded 
“to impurity and greater and 
greater iniquity” 


or of obedience, which leads 
to righteousness.” vs. 16. 

have become slaves of 
righteousness.” vs. 18. 
are now to be yielded 
“to righteousness for 
sanctification.” vs. 19.

righteousness. 

But "the wages of sin is death." and "the free gift of God 


is eternal life in Jesus 


Christ our Lord.'* vss.20-23 


Co RighteoueneBS as the Righteous Saving Activity of God # 

The righteousness of God is the central theme of 
Homans and Indeed of all Paul's letters# But it is no mere 
quality or attribute. It is the saving power and love and 
grace of God whereby he calls men out of slavery to sin, 
superstition, law, fear and death, and clothes them with 
power, that they migjht overcome this slavery and become free, 
so that they enter a new world, a new realm in whidh those 
powers no longer hold sway; a realm of life and light; of 
the spirit, of Joy, faith, love and hope of the glory tasted 
now and soon to be received in its fulness. Paul is proclaim¬ 
ing the central theme of his gospel when he says "^for I am 
not ashamed of the gospel; it is the power of God for sal¬ 
vation to every one who has faith, to the Jew first and also 
to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed 
through faith for faith; as it is written, 'He who through 
faith is righteous shall live.'" Horn. 1:16-17. It will be 
the aim of this dissertation to demonstrate just how dynamic 
a thing the "righteousness of God is for Paul#

CHAPTER II 

MAN'S GREAT NEED OF RIGHTEOUSNESS 

S* Paul * s Indictment of All Mankind * 

"All men, both Jews and Greeks, are under the power 

of sin^'* (Rom. 3:9). The life of both pagan and Jew is under 

sentence of doom* The life of man *'in Adam’* is A damn ation; 

a living death; characterized by its futility; its degradation 

in slavery to its own appetites; its inability to escape from 

its own weakness either through morality or man-made religion. 

It is riddled with faction and poisoned with malice and envy, 

and undermined with intrigue. It has the stench and corruption 

of decay, and it is without hope or future beyond the gra^e.^ 

When Paul describes this living death and uses with respect to 

it the language of the law court, he speaks as one of the 

prophets of old* First, if man is regarded as an adversary 

of God in the law court, ’’striving against his maker,” then he 

is condemned, for God is in the right as over against man; he 
ii. 

has no case. God has given him every opportunity to knov/ 
and love and serve him, and to find in that love and service 
true life and peace. Man by his own folly; his self-assertion

and his rejection of God, has brought upon himself all manner 
of evil. Here there is no room where the clay vessels may 
leer at one another and cynically discuss the wisdom and jus¬ 
tice of God^** Rather to any such presumptuous questions 
Paulas answer is swift: ”Who are you, 0 man, to answer back 
to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, ’Why have you 
made me thus?* Has the potter no right over the clay? ** 

(Rom. 9:20-21. Cf. Is. 29:16, 46:9). ^^Let the potsherd strive 
with the potsherds of the earth,” but not with God. Rather 
should their cry be one of humble penitence."enter not into 
judgment with thy servant: for in thy si^t shall no man 
living be justified.” Ps. 143:2. 

But the most important aspect of the judicial 
background is that the whole sorry state of man is the sentence 
upon him from the God who is the judge of all the earth; a 
sentence he richly deserves. For if he will not live under 
the grace of God, and give thanks for his bounty (Rom. 1:21), 
acknowledging himself to be his creature, utterly dependent 
upon him for every good thing; and enjoying his fellowship 
above all else; then shall he live under God’s wrath. Since 
he would trust in human guile and pride himself in human 
accomplishments, and hope for worldly gain, and find his joy 
in the gratification of fleshly appetites, let him have them, 
says Godl The fruit of the tree of the knov/ledge of good and 
evil shall be his* but how bitter is its fruit; it shall turn 
to ashes in his mouth.

He shall know evil, not by intellectual comprehension, but by 
the iron rod of experiencing the fruit of wickedness5 and good 
he shall never truly lay hold of, but only see it afar off as 
something for which he reaches but never grasps. The vaunted 
freedom and independence shall become abject slavery. Over¬ 
weening arrogance and power shall be humbled to the dust and 
exposed before all the world in its pitiful weakness. It 
shall be an object of derision and laughter. B/lan*s shrewdness 
and wisdom by which he would even call God to account is re¬ 
vealed as utter folly. His greed for gain heaps up riches 
only to find them of no more value than the dunghill. The 
efforifes he makes to achieve his own righteousness themselves 
condemn him by his failure to come anywheiMpnear his own stan¬ 
dards of perfection, much less those of God. The proffered 
life is truly death, and his optimism turns to despair, as 
he cries in utter anguish of spirit: ’^Wretched man that 1 am! 
who will deliver me from this body of death?*^ (Rom. 7:24). 

Thus is the wrath of God the righteous judge revealed working 
itself out in the lives of sinful men (Rom. l:18j 2:12; 3:9;19) 

S* The Moral Degradation of the Gentiles . 

The depravity of the heathen is most obvious, and 
it needs little argument to demonstrate the Condemnation at 
work among them, for the evidence is there for all to see. 

1. Their sinful condition is rooted in their self-alienation 
from God. It is they kho have cast themselves off from God. 
They cannot plead ignorance, for he has made himself known 
to them (Rom. 1:19-20.

But in their pride and desire to be independent of God they did 
not honor him as such nor see fit to acknowledge him as God 
(Rom. 1:21,28) and so they are without excuse, as they live in 
alienation from God and in hostility to him (Rom. 8:6-8, Col. 
1:21 j 3:6; Phil. 3:18-19). So they are "without hope and 
without God in the world." (Eph. 2:12). 

*God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also 
reap"(Gal. 6:7). These "sons of disobedience" bring upon 
themselves the dire consequences of rejecting God. 

** i£ §Ii awful thing . * says the Epistle to the 
Hebrews (x:31) fall into the hands of the living God . * 

Paul, with a finer instinct, sees that the really awful 
thing is to fall out of his hands, and to be left to oneself* 
in a world where the choice of evil brings its ov/n moral 
retribution." 

So there comes upon the godless Gentile world the holy indig¬ 
nation of God against all such presumption of men who would 
reject him, the only true God, and create for themselves 
Gods of their own choosing.( Rom. 1:18). I believe that 
C.H. Dodd*s zeal to eliminate all anthropomorphism from the 
wrath of God has led him astray at this point. I am persuaded 
that there is more at work here than the mere working out of 
cause and effect. Paul wore not the philosopher *s toga but 
the prophet’s mantle. To be sure, Paul, with all the great 
prophets of Israel, would stoutly defend all God’s actions 
as more than mere caprici or whimj and his Judgments of doom 
as his reaction to the flagrant violation of the essential

moral principles of the Universe. '*Shall not the judge of 
all the earth do right?** Gen. 18:25. But those principles 
for Paul are not merely great, impersonal truths grounded 
in the nature of things: they are rooted in the Holy love 
of the God of Israel, whose eyes are too holy to behold 
iniquity, and let it go unpunished; the same God whose 
Holy Spirit brooded over the waters as he formed the earth 
(Is. 40:12, Gen. 1:2) and stretched out the heavens as a tent 
to dwell in (Is. 40:22). Can such a God look with imperson¬ 
al detachment upon the desecration of that which He has 
made? When Paul put his ear to the ground of reality he 
heard not merely the vast music of the spheres calling man 
to live in harmony with the principles of nature. He heard 
a stern but loving voice calling: “Ye ^all be holy, for 
I am holy,** (Lev. 11:44, 46; 19:2) and weeping with sorrow 
for the children of men, who know not the things that belong 
to their peace (Is. 29:3; Jer. 6 : 6 ; Ezek. 4:2; Lk.19:42); 
a voice bringing a terrible indictment and sentence against 
all who pervert judgment (Am.6:7, 6 :12 5 Is. 1:17; 3:14f) 
oppress the poor (Is. 5:23;j 10:If; Mic. 2:lf,8f; 3:l-3,9f; 
Jer. 22:13,15; 23:lf;; Ezek. 34:3f. Hos. 10:12; Is. 1:21; 

Is. 5:7, Jer. 22:3); put their trust in uncertain riches 
(Jer. 9:23-24) and live only by their appetites (Is. 5:11- 
12, Phil.3:18-19).-

The wrath of the God of Israel, the God and Father of our 
Lord Jesus Christ is not merely impersonal nemesis. It is 
what he calls it—wrath: God’s judgment exhibited in its 
punitive aspect. It is not cmly wrath, but wrath and fury 
( 0 ^) which comes upon the wicked and 
factious (Rom. 2:8). Paul was not ignorant of the earthly 
life cuf Jesus. Surely the story of Jesus* cleansing of the 
temple (so firmly entrenched in Christian memory that it 
appears in all four of the gospels, Mt. 21:12-17, Mk. 11: 
16-195 Lk. 19:45-48, John 2:17) must have been known to him. 
And when Jesus, the very Son of God, attacked the money¬ 
changers in the temple he was moved by more than universal 
ethical principles. Rather in him is the fulfilment of the 
prophesy, "Zeal for thy house will consume me'*(Ps 69:9). And 
it is this zeal which would utterly purge the pollution of 
the temple brought upon it by this den of thieves. So with 
God. Truly, he ’gave them over,’ to the working out of their 
own destruction. But wrath is also at work and descending 
from heaven upon them (Rom. 5:9; Col. 3:6-6; ITh. 1:10); 
for it is merely the reversal of the experience of salvation: 
’%ork out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for 
God is at work in you both to will and to do his good pleas¬ 
ure." Phil. 2:13. Frfen this root of Godlessness grows the 
ubiquitous weed of evil in Gentile Society. It is not that 
first comes sin, and then alienation from God, but aliena¬ 
tion from God that brings man under the sway of the power

of sin, which once it grips him, keeps him far from fellow¬ 
ship with his Maker (Is. 59:1-2). 

Behold the consequences of rejecting God: 

a. They become depraved, futile and foolish in their thinking 
(Rom. 1:21-22, ICor. 1:19-31, Eph. 4:17-18), and thence as 
from a poisoned fountain pours out all manner of evil: 

“As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he.“ 

“Guard carefuli^y the heart, for thence are the issues of life.“ 

b. They are seduced into idolatry (Rom. 1:23,26), making gods 
which are but images of the vain imagination of their own 
minds (Ps. 2:1, Is. 40:18-21, 26; 41:24; 41:29; 44:9-20; 

46:1-7; 47:12-14;). Idolatry was regarded by the Jews as 
the worst of all sins and the essence of sin. “One sin, 
whatever it may be, leads on to another, until the deadly 
sin is reached: Today the evil inclination says Do this, 
and tomorrow. Do that; until at last it says, Worship 

other gods, and he goes and does it.“Ps. of Sol.3:12.^ 

c. The gods men make for themselves deify the forces of 
fertility and reproduction, and their worship sanctions all 
manner of orgiastic and immoral rites, setting the approval 
of religion upon flagrant immorality, so that it has become 
a part of the immoral mores of pagan society (ITh. 4:4-6; 

Rom. 1:24; Gal. 6:19-21; ICor. 6:9-10; Eph. 2:3, 5:5; 4:19; 

Col. 3:6-6; Tit. 3}3-4).

And not only this, but that which is most shameful— 
unnatural relations between men and men, between momcn and 
women (Rom. 1:26-27, ICor. 6:9) which filled every pious 
Jew with religious revulsion and loathing. Because of such 
things God had destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah despite the 
intercession of Abraham, the friend of God (Gen. 19), and 
because of the loathsome acts of the men of Gibea there 
was fearful slaughter of the men of the tribe of Benjamin; 
and their cities, especially Gibea, were razed to the 
ground, that the terrible infection might be purged out of 
Israel (Judges 19-20). Paul could not but shudder as he tho 
thought of the fate of a world that not only practised such 
things openly, but condoned and encouraged those who did 
them, even though their own Stoic moralists had warned them 
that such things were contrary to nature, and worthy of 
death (Rom* 1:32}^. 

d. Perhaps even more destructive than the sensual sins are 
those which undermine society and the body politic, and 
which are rife in the gentile world: (1Cor. 6:8, ICor. 6:9-10, 
Gal. 6:19-21, Rom. 1:28-31; Eph. 6:6, Tit. 3:3-4). 

e. They receive ^*in their own persons the due penalty of 
their error." (Rom. 1:27)—the decay and death of all that 

if fine within the life of man, to say nothing of the physical 
and social deterioration which is the inevitable penalty 
of promiscuityl The Defilement of body and spirit. (2Cor.7:1).

The breakdown of all mutual confidence, loyalty and integrity 
among men iis in itself a punishment. These are the human 
effects of sin. In addition to them, Paul catalogues the 
dire consequences of sin in the life of man as it affects 
his relation to God. 

i. The wrath of God which comes upon the sons of disobed¬ 
ience (Col. 3:5-6, Rom. 5:9, ITh. 1:10, 5:9). 

ii. Continued alienation from God, slavery to sin, and the 
sentence of death upon all his life ( Rom. 1:325 5 : 17,215 6 : 
215 8:1,6-8,10,135 Rom. 6 : 165 , ICor. 3:165 5:5] 6:135 15:75 
2Cor. 4:4, Phil. 3:18-19. Cf also Ecclus. 25:24. Wis.1:135 
2:23f 5 2 Esdras 3:75 Ps. Sol. 3:13). 

iii. Exclusion from the Kingdom of God. (Gal. 5:19-21, 

Eph. 3:1-3 5 5:5. 1C or. 6:9-10 5 2Cor. 6:14). 

C. Tiffi FAILURE OF Ilffi ^ TO OBTAIN RIGHTEOUSNESS BY LAW. 

Paul is using here the preaching technique of 
Amos (Cf. Amos ch. 1-2) to good effect, for by the end of his 
first chapter in Romans he has every good Jew with him heart 
and soul, crying Ameni to every indictment of the pagan 
world, until he has them defenceless when they themselves 
are brought before the tribunal of God’s Justice. 

The pious Jew was filled with pride of race, and of the 
superiority of God’s ovm chosen people Israel over all 
“^lesser breeds without the law.’*^ 


i. Cf. Rudyard Kipling’s poem ”God of our Fathers,” in the 
United Church

The Jew*s pride was based on the special fa’®or God had shown 
his people Israel (Rom. 2:17-20): 

^^He sheweth his word unto Jacob, 

His statutes and judgments unto Israel. 

He hath not dealt so with any nation: 

And as for his judgments, they have not known them.” 

(Ps. 147:19-20). 

The Jew whom Paul confronts is like the Pharisee in the 
temple, who "stood and prayed thus with himsell', 'God, I 
thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, 
adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a 
week, and give tithes of all that I get.” (ILk. 19:11-12). 
Anders Nygren has a good word to say at this point: 

'^The Jew was deeply convinced that the wrath of 
God rests on the Gentiles who do not have the law and do not 
know the true God. But as for himself, on the other hand, 
he counts it his greatest credit that he knows God and has 
the law. It is for this reason, above all else, that he is 
assured of his superiority to other people .(Dt. 4:6-8) 


”To be sure, the Jew is not so foolish and blind as 
to assume that he keeps all the law of God perfectly. When 
he puts his trust in righteousness by the law, it is not that 
he feels that his own deeds would enable him to stand before 
the Judge, if strict justice v/ere to pronounce the verdict. 
Righteousness by the law is not to be understood in that 
extreme sense. We must be careful not to make that mistake. 
The Jew is well aware that he fails in many ways, and he will 
be lost unless God in his mercy judges leniently. But it is 
precisely the fact that he has the law and knows God that 
fills him with confidence and gives him a feeling of safety. 
He is aware that he knows the right wayj and unlike the 
heathen, he has not strayed away from God. In this way, he 
is sure,he is fundamentally right with Godj in that sense he 
is righteous. Beyond that he trusts that God*s leniency will 
overlook his failures.” Nygren goes on to show how this 
idea of Israel's special position before God is expressed 
in the Wisdom of Solomon, 16:1-4. 


i. Anders Nygren, op cit. p. 119. cf. also on this point

It was precisely in the extreme, rigorist sense, however, 
that Paul the former Pharisee understood the righteousness 
of the lav/. God gave the law that men might know what he 
requires of his servants. His first call is for absolute 
loyalty to himj and loyalty to him means loyalty to what he 
is—the uncompromising champion of righteousness and the foe 
of every manner of evil. ”Ye shall be holy, for I am holy.” 

( Lev. 11:44, 45, 19:2). If man would be truly righteous 
under the law, he m*ust fulfil its entire demandsf for God is 
not satisfied with anything short of perfection (Matt. 6:48). 
So the Jew too is under judgment. "God shows no partiality 
(Rom. 2:11, Wis.12:22 to the contrary notwithstanding). ”For 
it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, 
but the doers of the law who will be justified.”(Rom. 2:13). 
Where then does the Jew stand, who is so quick to judge the 
heathen world? (Rom. 2:;l-2). Paul*s answer again is that of 
the prophet: ”You only have I known of all the families of 
the earth: therefore will I punish you for all your iniqui¬ 
ties.” (Amos 3:2. Rom. 2:3). 

To be sure, God is wondrously merciful and forbearing (Rom. 
2:4, Wis. 11:23^ 15:1). But how long do you think he will 
tolerate those who knowingly disobey him, presuming upon ”the 
riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience?” (Rom. 
2:4). To know God and his will is not perfect righteousness 
(Wis. 16:3). This knowledge avails only to confront us with 
our sin (Rom. 3:20) and to lead us to repentance (Rom. 2:4).

’*by your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath 
for yourself on the day when God*s righteous judgment will be 
revealed. For he will render to every man according to his 
works." (Rom. 2:5-6). The law does not protect you against 
the wrath of God, for under the law everything depends upon 
performance (2:14). And what is the performance of the Jew? 
With superb irony Paul paints the picture of the Jew, knowing 
the righteous judgment of God against all wickedness, doing 
those very things he himself condemns,( Rom. 2:17-23), until 
the very name of Jew and of his God is a byword among the 
heathen (2:24). 

Even circumcision, the sign of the Covenant, is of no avail to 
the Jew who disobeys the lawj for the Covenant, and circum¬ 
cision its seal, are meant to bind the children of the covenant 
in loyalty and obedience to God. And obedience in outward act 
and speech alone is not enoughj the inward thought and motive 
must be pure as well, free from all uncleanness and covetous¬ 
ness, for "He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcis¬ 
ion is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal*^ 

(Rom. 2:29, ICor. 4:4). 

"In order to understand what sin is we must 
exclude all human opinion as to the meaning of what has 
happened. Whether man’s judgment be severe or lenient, for 
the suppliant himself only the thought of God and what he 
has willed can reveal the true character of liis failure® - He 
is accountable to no judge but God himself. That is his 
wisdom in the hidden part.’Ps. 61:6" i.

The advantage of the promises of God is not in the merit the 
Jews have heaped up for themselves thereby, but in that 
through the promises God has done so much for a rebellious and 
wayward people. And God*s faithl'ulness cannot be nullified by 
their uni*aithfulness. They should remember the parable of 
the vineyard (Is. 5:1-7. Paul probably also has in rrdnd 
Jesus* similar parables in Mat. 21:33-41, Mk. 12:1-9; Lk. 20: 
9-16, and the cursing of the barren fig tree Mt. 21:18,19; 

Mlc. 11:12^14. This line of thought is similar to that of 
Paul’s own in his parable of the olive-branch that is lopped 
off, found in Rom. 11:17). Let not the Jews rely on the 
promises, thinking that they will be preserved because only 
through them can God fulfil his purposes. God cannot be 
thwarted by the faithlessness of his chosen servants, but he 
will carry out his redemptive purpose for mankind even if to 
do so he must reject Israel and create for himself a people 
willing to serve him. 

What then is the conclusion of the matter? “Are we Jews 
any better off?” (Rom. 3:9. Italics mine. Note how ^ul 
identifies himself with his own "kinsmen after the flesh.**). 

*No, not at all, for a .all men, both Jews and Greeks, 

are under the power of sin.” Paul bolsters his contention 
with a catena of quotations from the Psalter (Ps. 14,1-3; 

5:9; 140:3; 10:7; 59:7-8, 36:1). And these accusations 
are brought not merely against the heathen but against the 
Jews as well.

Indeed the whole purpose of the law is to confront men with 
their sin, to show them that for all they do they are 
“accountable to God.“ (Rom. 3:19). Again, “no human being 
will be justified in his sight by works of the law, since 
through the law comes knowledge of sin.“ (Rom. 3:205 10:3, 
ICor. 3:65 Gal. 2:16), and the attempt to fulfil the law 
results in bondage (Gal. 2:4; 4:22-24; 6:1) because through 
it man comes to realize that isin is the ruling power of his 
life. As Nygren says, 

’"Sin is more than an inner state; it is an object¬ 
ive power of corruption which has man in its clutch.” ^ 

The most forceful illustration of this function of the law 
is found in the autobiography of Paul himself, in Romans 7: 
7-24. “The law is holy, and the commandment is holy, and just 
and good.“ 7:12. But sin uses this very law which shows us 
the holy will of God as a base of operations in our minds, 
enticing us with the prospect of the desirability of that 
which is forbidden (7:7-12). Thus the law kills our early 
innocence:, yet still leaves us impotent to perform the good 
which we know to be right, for the law does not add any 
strength to our natural human weakness (Rom. 8:3). Instead, 
it only creates a terrible sense of frustration and guilt in 
the man who knows what is good, and logB to do it, but 
finds himself helpless:

*' I do not understand toy own actions. For I do not do what 
I want, but I do the very thing I hate...I can will what is 
right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, 
but the evil I do not want is what I do."(Bom.7:16,18-19)• 

"I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil 
lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my 
inmost self, but I see in my members another law at war with 
the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin 

which dwells in my members.so.I serve the law of sin." 

(Rom. 7:21-23, 26). So the last state of the Jew is more 
unhappy than that of the Gentile. He is judged by a higher 
standard, and he is tortured, as the pagan is not, by his 
inability to attain the perfection that God requires. Hence th 
the cry of anguish; "Wretched man that I am! Who will deliv¬ 
er me from this body of death." 7:24. 

But when Paul gives his answer, we have passed over from 
law to grace, from death to life, rejoicing, as he did, 

"Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!" 7:26.

CHAPTER III 

The incompletion and Expectation of the Old Testament 

Quest• 

A, The Judicial Background. 

^^Why art thou cast down, 0 my Soul, 

And why art thou disquieted within me? 

Hope thou in God, for I will yet Praise Him, 

Who is the health of my countenance, and my God. 

.... Ps. 42-11, 43:5. 

If we are to understand Paulas great proclama¬ 
tion of the saving tork of God in Christ we must lay dov/n 
our Anselm and Aquinas and take up Paulas own beloved 
Scriptures of the Old Covenant, especially the Prophets 
and the psalms; for Paul the Christian does not forget that 
he was nurtured by those scriptures, and prepared to re¬ 
ceive Christ as "a Hebrew of the Hebre*^-^” (Phil 3:5*) 

''^hen he ^ead the prophets as a Christian, he found Christ 
in them all, especially in the Secdnd - Isaiah (Is. 40-55^* 

In t he common life of the Hebrew people from very 
early times all questions of right and wrong were habitually 
regarded essentially from a legal point of view, as being 
ideally capable of being settled by a judge. To be righteous 
was to be d^^ared in the right by the judge; to have your 
cause vindicated against your adversary, or to be acquitted 
of the accusation on account of which you Hre arraigned 
b)Z^efore the judge, i 

The qualities expected of the "righteous^^ judge 
were that he should have a zeal for the right cause justify

The 7^ P of the judge consists in 

refusing to be influenced by bribes, and in making his deci¬ 
sion stnctly on the merits of the ease. 

'*Stress, however, is naturally laid on the duty 
of redressing the wrongs of the poor and defenceless; 
hence judicial r>^ighteousness is frequently equivalent to 
deliverance or protectioia. This idea lies, indeed, in the 
verb j which means not only to judge, but also 

to vindicate "or ' to defend (I S. 24:15i Is. l:17^*Etc., 

ibid p. 273 b.

In a time when economic hipheavals v/ere destroy¬ 
ing the sanctions of marality in custom and tradition, the 
prophets anchored them fasf in the inexorable demands of 
the holy God of Israel. "So intense is this conviction 
that the idea of abstract right seems to stand out before 
their minds as an objective reality, a power that may be 
resisted but can never be defeated." ibid, p. 274a. 

Their appeaxl was not to a written law, but to 
the moral sense -- "the recognition of the inherett rights 
of human personality" More than our use of the terra 
Justice is caught up in the prpphetic use of the Hebrew 

"It includes a larged-hearted construction 
of the claims of humanity; "it is, as has been said, the 
humanitarian view par excellence, " (ibid. P, 274b, italics

In a foot note Skinner notes the combination of 7^ T^7 

V T ' 

with 7 ^^77 (kindness) in Hos, 10:12, Jer,9i23) 
(ibid. P. 274b.) 

So,for fhe prophets, "The righteousness of the 
judge appears preminently in his vindication of the widow, 
the orphan and the stranger, the oppressed and defenceless 
classes generally (is. 1:17, etc.)" 

"In Amos the is always the poor 

man, with no influence at his back, v/ho must therefore look 
to the judge to maintain his rights"...,. This indicates an 
important aspect of the Hebrew idea of judicial righteoue- 
ness.... "It denotes not merely the impartial attitude 
of mind that decides faiily between rival interests, but 
a positive energy on the side of right, a readiness to 
p rotect and succour those v/ho have no help in t hemselves ." 
ibid. p. 274b. litalics mine) 

The prophets do not so much describe Yahweh as 
righteous, as they tell of his righteous actions, for 
in them he shows his J7P 7 (Amos 7*7"^, Is. 2^/17, 

' : 9 

10:22, 5^16) The prophets stress the punitive aspect 
of God^s righteousness as "the side which it presents to 
the guilt of Israel (Hos. 6:5, 10:4, Hab. 1:12)." Although 
may at times in their writings seem equivalent 
to retribution, "Retribution is not regarded as an end in 
itself, but only as a step in the carrying out of a re¬ 
demptive purpose." (ibid. p. 275 a,)

Righteousness as Salvation 

V/hen the men of the Old Testament considar-ed 
the righteousness of God they saw it on the side of 
his mercy to hispeople Israel, so that Skinner can thus 
sum up the prevalent Old Testament conception of the 
righteousness of God: 

^’In the many places where the righteousness 
of God is referred to as an object of praise (Ps, 7*17, 

22;31, 35:2g, 40:10, 51/15, 71/15f, 19; B9:16; 145:7) 
it is not the abstract justice of J **^s dealings that 
calls forth adoration, but his proved readiness to 
help and bless his people. This aspect of righteousness 
may be defined as the justifying, activity of God.” 

(Italics Author^s) 

.... ”In tother words, righteousness is synonymous 
with salvation. (Is. 46:13; 51:5, 6,8; 59:16f. Ps 40:10; 

Ps. 51:16 71:15'T; 9^:2 etc.)” Skinner, ibid. p. 2^0a. Italics 
mine. 

He is ”a just god, and also a Saviour,” and how 
hispeople love to recount his mighty acts by which he has 
”justified” Israel, just as the human judges of Israel 
justified the needy by championing his cause against the 
wicked. 

It was he who brought Abraham out of Mesopotamia, 
and guided him to a land he knew not of, and was his 
shield and his exceeding great reward. It was he who when 
all human hope was gone gave to Abraham a son, that he 
might become the father of many nations; that his seed 
might inherit the earth, and that in him and in his seed 
all the families of the earth might call themselves blessed. 
(Gen. 12:1-3. 15:1-5)

It was this same God who turned the seemingly 
hopeless plight of Joseph into a means of saving many 
people (Gen. 40:20). 

It was the same Yahweh who with a mighty bared 
arm and an outstretched hand had brought the pitiable 
band of slaves out of bondage to the mighty empire of 
Egypt (Deut. 26:5-9)* Why, Pharoa himself was raised 
up by God merely to show to all the world hov/ little 
is the most impressive and irresistible human power in the 
face of God^s mighty purposes. (Ex. 9:16; Rom. 9:17*) 

The providence of God was all that saved his 
people from starvation and thirst in the wilderness 
(Ex. 16:1-15, 17:1-6, Deut. S:3)o It was he also who 
went with them over Jordan, and drove out the enemy from 
before them, who were more numerous than they, and dwelt 
in fortified cityes (Num. 13:27-29, 31, 33). When they 
were all but crushed by the Philistines, he raised up 
judges (champions) to save them (Judges 5:6-7,11); for 
he himself was their champion, to vindicate them against 
all who would oppress them. 

When all looked lost, and Hezekia and his peo¬ 
ple cast themselves upon the mercy of God, he redeemed them 
out of the jaws of the Assyrian wolf (Is 37); and it was 
he who brought them again from exile to their true home 
over Jordan:

^’ViHien the Lord turned again the Captivity of Zion, 
we were like them that dream. 

Then was our mouth filled with laughter, 
and our tongue with singing: 

Then said they among the heathen. 

The Lord hath done great things for them. 

The Lord hath done great things for us; 

whereof we are glad.Ps. 126:1-2. 

This same God had promised in his word (Jer. 3101-34, 
Is. 49:6-10, Is. 26:6“^), that he would also deliver all 
mankind from bondage to the sin and fear and death that 
enslves him, and that he might walk in freedom, and live 
in the light, and with a song on his lips; that the image 
of God in him which had been defaced by his captivity to 
sin and his exile from his true homeland of God^s love might 
be restored; that he might Glory to God, who made him to 
share his glorj?-. 

Thus God had spoken, and God does not speak for 
nothing. His words are not mere empty wind, like the 
words of men( Is. 55:10-11, Gen, Passim; Ps. 33:6; Is.1:1-2, 

20: 24; 3; Is. 2^:14“!^; Jer. 19, 37/17. Lzek. 37:3;10>. 

And, says Paul, God in Christ has now begun to 
reveal the fulfilment of his gracious promises and of his 
holy, redeeming purpose for mankind, "The Word became 
flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth." John 1:14. 

Sacrifial Background 


The greatest concern of the religion of the Old 
Testament is that the people of Israel be right with God.

But God is "the holy one in the midst of thee." and he 
is "of too holy eyes to behold iniquity." Therefore "Ye 
must be holy, for I am holy." This meant that the great 
problem of the cultus was the elimination of any contamina¬ 
tion of ritual or moral sin which might separate the people 
from God. Hence the whole elaborate sacrificial system, 
which found its yearly climax on the day of atonement; 
the one day when the High Priest, the descendant of Aaron, 
might enter the Holy of Holies to make intercession and 
offerings before God for the sins of the people. On this day 
all the sins of the people were confessed and the burden 
of them bound on the back of a hapless goat, who was re¬ 
leased to wander in the wilderness and perish, that so 
the people might be freed from all their sins (Leviticus 
ch. 16). 

The whole of the sacrificial cultus was designed 
to act as a disinfectant; keeping the people holy before 
the Lord. The proper ritual was prescribed to deal with 
all manned of ritual transgressions which were done in 
ignorance by the whole congregation (Lev. 4^13, 15:24”26, 

or by one^-of the people, .whether by a priest (Lev. k* 3, or 
by a ruler (Lev. 4*22), or by one of the s«^mmon people 
(Lev. 4^2?, Num. 16:27-29). Minor transgressions of the 
moral law (Lev. 5«1”5) might be atoned for by sacrificial 
and places of refuge must be provided that he who acci-

dentally kills a man might have sanctuary from the 
avenger of blood (Deut. 19^4-6). 

But sacrifice was impotent to help him who 
sinned *’with a high hand.** 

**But the soul that doeth out p:^umptuously, 
whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same 
reproacheth the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off 
from the people. 

Because he hath despised the word of the Lor4, 
and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall be ut¬ 
terly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him,** Num.l5:30“31« 

A terrible example of the application of this 
principle is given in Numbers 15*32-36, which tells of 
the stern justice meted out to the man who gathered sticks 
on the Sabbath day -- he was stoned to death by all the 
people. 

Only once, in Lev, 6:1-7, is it suggested that 
any one who has knowingly and deliberately sinned may be 
restored, and his sacrifice must be accompanied by recom¬ 
pense to those v^^hom he has wronged. 

The Prophetic Background 

The prophets percei>{Lng that sacrifice failed 
utterly to bring the people into the right relationship 
with God precisely because it could not d^al with the 
fundamental moral issues of life. Sacrifice without 
honor, integrity, justice and mercy are an abomination 
unto the Lord (Is. 1:11-15; Jer. 6:20, Hos, 4:19.)

’*he looked for judgment, but behold oppression; for 
righteousness, but behold a cry*'* (Is. ^:7) The 
cry of mockery is "come to Bethel, and transgress, and 
to Gilgal and multiply transgression." -- at the very 
centers of worship and sacrifice the people commit their 
abominations. 

The day shall come when the apostate‘people 
shall be deprived of all their elaborate sacrificial 
ritual (Hos. 9:3-6), and then perhaps they will 

return to the first principles of true religion: 

"Afber ward shall the children of Israel re¬ 
turn, and seek the Lord their God, and David their king; 
and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter 
days." (Hos. 3:5*) 

When Israel wandered forty years in the wiider- 
ness it was not sacrifice that God required of them, but 
loyal obedience to his will (Jer. 5:21-23, Amos 5:25). 

And his requirements are the same now as they have ever 
been, for he never changeth in his holy will.: 

"He hath showed thee, 0 man, what is good; 
and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, 
and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thpy God?" 
(Mic. 6:5. cf. also Is. 1:16-17, Hos. 6:6, Amos 5:24, 

Jer. 22:3-4.) 

But with the prophetic demand for righteous¬ 
ness went a conviction of doom, for they were convinced ' 





-32 - 


that evil is so deeply ingrained into the nature of man 
that he is bound to destruction; for he cannot help 
himself; 


"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the 
leopard his spots? then may^y also go good, that are 
accustomed to do evil,"(Jer. 13:23)♦ 

So man is utterly helpless before the wrath 
of God, and only God in his mercy can save him from 
destruction. But God will help him, for he is "a Just 
God and also a Saviour." (Is 45:21) 

"Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that 
I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, 
and with the house of Judah ... After those days, Saith 
Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write 
it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall 
be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his 
neighbour, sayingm Enow the Lord; for they shall all know 
me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, 
saith the Lord: for I will forgive their Iniquity, and 
will remember their sin no more." (Jer.3lJ31”33b~34) cf. 
also Hos. 2:19-23, 13:9-14 ) Ezekiel 37:1-14.) 

Thus does the whole of the Old Testament remain 
incomplete but expectant of the deliverance of God. 

Paul too stands in the tradition of prophet 
rather than priest. For he was trained as a Pharisee, and 
the Pharisees had preserved with one-sided zeal the Pro¬ 
phets^ consuming obsession with the pursuit for righteous¬ 
ness. But they had forgotten the prophetic word concer. - 
ning man^s helplessness to achieve that righteousness for 
himself (Romans 10:1-3). Paul had to be confronted with 
that truth on the road to Damascus, and then it burfet on

and just and good, but I am carnal, sold under sin." 

(Rom. 7• 12, 14/} • 

Old Testament and Judaistic Antropology of Sin 

This idea of being in bondage to sin is so 
fundamental to Paul that we must understand it if we 
are to understand the gospel he preaches. 

Paul sums up the whole bondage of man to 
sin when says that "death reigned in Adam," ( or words 
to that effect, Rom. 5:12»2l). This idea of the bondage 
to sin and death through the transgression of Adam, 

Paul had taken over from his Jewish heritage. For to 
the Jew sin was seen as a power controlling this world 
at its deepest level originating in Adam and since ex¬ 
tending its power over the whole of mankind, (cf. Kittel- 
Bible Key Words. Sin. p. 43-44)• 

It is a scriptural idea, and to grasp it we 
must consult the scriptures. It is embodied in the 
second and third chapters of Genesis, 

"The Lord God formed man from the dust of the 
ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of 
life; and man became a living soul" (Gen. 2:7)•

God placed him in a fruitful garden, giving him 
freely to enjoy of all the fruit of the garden, except: 

*’0f the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of 
good and evil thou shalt not eat of it; for on the day 
that thou eatest of it, thou shalt surely die.” (2:17). 

But the temptation came, and Adam and his wife 
succumbed (Gen. 3 • 1-7/) • And then he had to face the 
consequences: 

”And they heard the voice of the Lord God 
walking in the garden in the co^l of the day: and 
Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence 
of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. And the 
Lord God called unto Adam, and said, Where art Thou? And 
he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, 
because I was naked; and I hid myself.” (Gen. 3*^”10). 

So came the curse: 

Sorrow for the woman in conception and 


birth vl6. 


”Cursed is the ground for thy sake,” v. 17-19• 

A life of unremitting toil ending in death: 

”In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat 
bread till thou return to the ground; for out of it 
wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust 
shalt thou return.” v. 19. 

And finally, they are driven out from the 
garden, and the v/ay to the tree of life is cut off 
from them by the angel with the flaming sword 3:24. 

Adam was created in the image of God, meant 
to share the mind and fellowship of God (Gen. 1 : 26 “ 27 );

only a little lower than God (Ps. ^:5), but he was made of 
the dust of the earth (for the sake of understanding Paul 
we need not concern ourselves here with the distinction 
between the L, and P, documents), and it was God who 
breathed into him the breath of life, without which he 

was but dust « 

God gave ho him to live in the midst of abundance 
of goods things, that he might lack for nothing; giving to 
him even a woman, a companion of his own kind, to be a 
help mate for him, that together and in fellowship with 
God, who ’’walked in the garden in the cool of the day” 
their life might be complete. 

He laid upon them but one restraint, forbidding 
them to eat of the fruit of tree of knowledge of good 
and evil, on pain of death. 

But it was not enough for Adam to be ”a little 
lower than God.” this subjection, this absolute depen¬ 
dence upon God, was galling to his nascent pride. 

klust he be such a subservient creature, forbid¬ 
den the fruit of that tree? If only he could have that, 
he would be as God, knowing good and evil. 

One commentator believes that the greatness of 
this story is in its treatment of the ambition to be as 
God -- a grotesque aberration, yet not held up to contempt

and ridicule, "but appreciated with the sympathy of one 
who has himself passed through this humiliating experi¬ 
ence. Man^s tragic plight, as he struggles in his ov/n 
strength to overcome his limitations, is so convincingly 
portrayed in the phrases, ^Ye hhall be as God^, and ^To 
be desired to make one wise,^ that it stirs a longing 
in the breast of every man, .... and presents him with an 
apology for sin that is alarmingly pBrsuasive. In this 
way we are brought with the utmost precision to the reli¬ 
gious heart of the problem of sin, which is beyond the 
reach of abstract thought, and consists in man^s incon¬ 
testable inherent right to defy and reject God." (Bible 
Ref. words.) 

And now Adam has no longer the joy of meeting 
God in the garden, but he knov^s that he is naked, and he 
is ashamed, and when he hears God^s approach he hides 
himself and his wife in terror. His sense of guilt is 
irrational, and a Freudian psychologist might explain it 
away, but he cannot escape its power. He has done wrong, 
for he has rebelled against his maker. 

"Beside this picture of bold self-assertion on 
the part of man, as he becomes conscious of the power of 
his will, stands the other, which shows how man^s asser¬ 
tion of self against God creates asituation in which he 
dreads the divine scrutiny, how his will, instead of re¬ 
jecting the call to render an account, collapses mise¬ 
rably, and finally the Godlike one is caught out like a 
naughty schoolboy, shuffling and su2iky." (ibid. p.26). 

And so comes doom. Instead of a blessing 
(Ps'. 25:12-14) will be a curse;

A curse upon the seppent pride that tempted 
him to disobey his maker. He shall crawl in the dust. 

A curse upon all womankind, that she shall 
have travail in bringing children to birth, only to see 
them go forth to death. 

A curse upon the very ground, that man^s 
living shall be wrung from the earth in heartache and 
poverty. 

A curse of death even upon his life: God 

bra^thed his 17 ) 1 into his nostrils and made 

him a living sould ( ^ ). It was by God’s 

* « 

Spirit that he received the gift of life itself. And 
since he has seen fit to reject God’s will, God will take 
his spirit to himself again, and the end of man shall be 
dissolution and death. ’’For dust thou art, and to dust 
thou shalt return.(Gen. 3*19; cf. also Ps. 104^29, 

Eccl. 12:7)f 

Finally, as the seal upon this doom of death 
and alienation from God, he is cast out from the garden, 
and the way is barred to the tree of life. 

Such was the fate of Adam. And all humanity 
is ’in Adam,’ ’’for all have sinned and fallen short of 
the glory of God.” (Rom. 3 *23). All men share his rebel¬ 
lious nature, seeking to assert their own wills as over 
against the will of God. And even the man who strives 
for righteousness is caught up in his own weakness, ( 

Rom. ^:7“S) and in the universal sinfulness that enmeshes

And so all men share his doom fear, and 
shame, and guilt before God; the curse upon his life, with 
dissolution and death as the final end thereof. 

Anything that could deliver man from his 
terrible plight would be goods news indeed I (Rom. 7:24). 
And, says Paul, this has indeed come to pass. 

^^How beautiful upon the mountains are the 
feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth 
salvation; that saith unto Ziop, "Thy God reigneth I 

Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste

CHAPTER IV 

GOD (who is alone Man^s Hope, his Champion 
and His Savior) Has Intervened in Christ 

Paulas introduction of the gospel of Jesus 
Christ is therefore a cry of triumph: 

’’ I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is the 
power of God for salvation to every one who has faith, 
to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the 
righteousness of God is revealed through faith for 
faith; as it is written, ’He who through faith is 
righteous shall live’ ”• (Roman 1:16-17) 

’’For all the promises of God find their yes 
in him. That is why we utter the Amen through him to 
the glory of God the Father,” - 2Cor 1-20. 

Above we noted Skinner’s comment that the pre¬ 
valent Old Testament Conception of the Righteousness 
of God, where it is referred to as an object of praise, 
is the adoration not of the abstract justice of Ood’s 
dealings, but of his proved readiness to help and bless 
his people. 

”f!his aspect of righteousness,” says Skinner, 
’’may be defined as the justifying activity of God.” and, 
further, ”In other words, righteousness is synonymous 
I'^ith salvation,” (Skinner, op. cit,, p. 2^0 a.) 

Paul’s whole gospel is the proclamation that 
the expectation and incompleteness of the Old Testament 
are fulfilled in Christ, 

’’But now the righteousness of God has been mani¬ 
fested apart from law, although the law and the prophets 
bear witness to it, the righteousness of God through 
faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.” (Rom. 3-21-22.)

A New Principle of Obedience Seen in Jesus 

Just as **in Adam” disobedience and death 
reigned in all men, so in Christ a new power is begin¬ 
ning to reign in the men who are transformed into his 
likeness* 

All men, living in Adam, had been striving to 
assert themselves, to become like gods* But here was 
one ”who though he was in the form of God, did not 
count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emp¬ 
tied himself, taking the form of a servant, being born 
in the likeness of men. And being found in human form 
he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even 
death on a cross*” (Phil* 2:6-^.) Here was an altogether 
new thing upon the earth* (cf* Eccl* 1:9-10). Never had 
any who shared the nature of Adam been know voluntarily 
to give himself up in obedience to the will of God in 
every breath he drew; even dying for the unworthy. i 

”Why,” exclaims Paul, ”one will hardly die for 

a righteous man -- though perhaps for a good man one 

will dare even to die* ”(cp* Jn* 15:13) ^Greater love 

hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for 

i: Cf* The story of baptism of Jesus -- the Spirit 
descending as a dove upon him, and the voice 
proclaiming him to be ”my beloved Son, in whom 
I am wellpleased.” Mt. 3:13-17; Mk. 1:9-11; 

Lk* 3:21-22.

his friends/* Yet**Christ died for the ungodly.** (Rom 5*6 -) 
for the enemies of God, yea for his enemies, who hated 
and reviled him and nailed him to the Cross, (you cru¬ 
cified him — Acts. 2:23). 

Therefore it came about that as **The first 
Adam became a living soul. The last Adam became a 
life-giving Spirit.** (LCdc. 13*45, 47-49) 

For because of his perfect obedience; his complete 
submission to the will of God, **Therefore God has highly 
exalted him, and bestowed on him the name which is above 
every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should 
bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and 
every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord , to the 
glory of God the Father.** {mil 2:9-11, Is. 45:21-23) ii 
Why, the name given to Jesus is the same name 
reserved for God himself, and God is the giver of live. 

So as the gift of God*s spirit is the gift of life itself, 
those who live in Christ have life indeed,**for the Lord 
is the Spirit** (2Cor 3:17-1^). Thus did it come to pass 
that **the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.** 

ii Cf. The gospel story of the transfiguration (Matt. 

17:1-13; ^'^k. 9:2-13; Lk 9:25-36.) Moses and Elijah 
appear with Jeuus; but when the cloud of the divine 
presence descends upon them, and the voice is heard 
**This is my beloved Son, my Chosen, Hear him,** Jesus 
alone is left. Not even the greatest of the prophets 
could stand on the same pinnacle of devotion with 
Jesus, for his is the name that is above every name. 

Cp. Dt. 34:10.

For here is a new principle at work in the life of man; 
for this Jesus has created a new humanity in himself, 
after his own likeness (2Cor. 5-1^-17), instead of after 
the likeness of Adam. For as his Spirit dwells in them 
their life like his shall be one of absolute reliance 
upon God the all-Sufficient, (Gal. 2:20) through whom 
they are able to do all things. It is the Spirit of obe¬ 
dience rather than of self-assertion, so that those who 
live ^*in Christ^^, no longer strive to be as gods, knowing 
good and evil. (Gen. 3’5)* Rather, they count it their 
highest good to know and love him (for the fear of the 
Lord is the beginning of wisdom. (Ps iii:10 

Thus the whole terrible sequence of pride, 
self-assertion, sin, idolatry, guilt, and doom is broken; 
for "The law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set 
me free from the law of sin and death."

CHAPTER V 


FAITH 


Nowhere is Paul’s use of words more elusive than 


when he deals with faith. As Snaith says ’’words do not stand 
for pin-points of expression, but for large circles, and the 
nearer we get to the circumference, the more the particular 
significance gets blurred.” i 

This is exactly the trouble we have here. For the 
Greek words PistBuo { // / t o cJ) ^ Pistis ( // z '^^ ) 


and Pistos ( 9 , ) have a wide range of meanings from 

truth throught steadfastness, faithfulness, trustworthiness, 
that which is intrusted, belief or acceptance; to say nothing 
of the Hebrew and Septuagint overtones of trust, loyalty, good¬ 
ness and faithfulness to a covenant. In many instances the 
meaning of the words is not clear in itself, and must be as¬ 
certained by reference to it s context, and even then we are 
sometimes in doubt, for there is possible such subtle diffe¬ 
rentiation in meaning with the same terra that we are not sure

mentioned above where the meaning is the very common Greek

one of belief, acceptance of a teaching as the truth, obe¬ 
dience to a standard of belief or doctrine. 

Rom. 1:5, 2 Cor 4:2, Phil. L;25(?), 27* Eph 1:13(?), 4:13, 5. 
Col. 1:23, 2:7, ITim. 1:2,4. 5:^, 4:3, 6:10, 20-21 
2Tira. 1:13-14, 2:1^, 3:^, 15; 4:7. 

2Th. 2:10-13.? There is some possibility that in vs. 13 at 
any rate, **the truth” may refer to the faithfulness (cf Heb. 
Emeth lZ/'TJ'X ), so that the sense might be trust in God’s 
faithfulness, rather than acceptance of a doctrine. 

Tit. 1:1, 4,9; 2:2, 3:15 

In 1 Tim. 1:14 and 2 Tim 1:13, we have the use of an identi¬ 
cal phrase, ”the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus,” 
in what seem to be very different senses. In the first 
instance it is the ”the grace of our Lord overflowed for 
me with the i^th and love that are in Christ Jesus, as if 
here is the overflowing into the Christian of all the trust 
toward God and the love of man that comes to the man who is 
in Christ. In the second usage, it is ’’follow the Pattern 
of the sound words which you have heard from me, in the faith 
and love which are in Christ Jesus,”. Here we seem to be on 
a very different level of religious thought, relating more to 
doctrine, belief in the truth. 

It is perhaps noteworthy that in the above group of 
meanings, only six are from letters generally ascribed to 
Paul, while five are from Ephesians and Colossians, and

twenty-one from the Pastoral epistles* 

A related usage is found in the use of ”faith” to 
denote enlightenment, sincere conviction, as related to 
enlightened conscience or scruples regarding thigs external* 
Rom* 14:1-2, 22,23* iTim* 1:4-5, 2 Tim* 1: 5, 2:1^* 

B* Faith as Steadfastness, Faithfulness, Reliability* 

A second major group of occurrences of the words 
Pisteuo, y/'f Pistis z'/'s and Pistos 

u^,csr-ro<p> embodies the basic idea of steadfastness, faithful¬ 
ness, reliability. 

(1) ”This is a faathful (true, reliable) saying*” 

ITim* 2:11, 15; 4:9; 2Tim. 2:11, Tit. 3:^* 

(2) It is required of the servants of God that they be found 
faithfull-, carrying our faithfully that which is entrusted 
to them* 

Rom* 3:2. ICor* 4:2, 17; 7:25; 9:17. Gal* 2:7 
Eph. 1:1, 6:21* 1 Th. 2:4 

ITim. 1:11-12, 3:11, 4:12; 5:12; 6:11. 2Tim* 4:7, 2:2,3:10 

(3) God is Faithful. 

Rom. 3:3-4; 4:20-21; ICor* 1:9; 2 Cor. 1:1B; 

Eph. 1:13 - regarding ”the word of Truth” as equivalent to 
”the word concerning his faithfulness.” 


ITh. 5:23-24; 2 Th. 3:3, 2 Tim. 2:12-13. Tit* 1:2-3 






-46 - 


C. Faith as Steadfast Loyalty, Trust, and Belief in the Good¬ 
ness and Reliability of God as shown in Christ* 

(!•) Steadfastness of Belief and Loyalty, Trust. 

Rom. l:a, 12. 4:12, 19; 11:20, lCor.l5:2, 2Cor,10-15,13:5 
Phil. 1:27,2:17. Col.1:4, 23: 2:5, 7. ITh. 3:2,5-7,10. 

2Thi. 1-3-4. 2T>iim. 3:15; lT)riim.l:14 
Rom. 4:12, 19. 

(2) Spirit of Faith — Belief, Trust — 2 Cor. 4:13; 5:13-14 

(3) Obedience of Faith or to the Faith. Rom. 1:5, 16:26; 2Corl:2 
1:24. Perhaps this should be included under section I, but I 
believe the idea of steadfastness or loyalty is predominant. 

(4) Faith as a source of strength, armour in battle. 

Rom. 1:12, Eph. 6:l6; ITh. 5:^. 

(5) Faith as givengConfidence of access to God, 

Rom. 5:2, Eph. 3:2; 2Cor. 3:4. 

(6) Faith as resulting through the hearing of the preaching and 
leading to the preaching of the Gospel. 

Rom. 10:14-17. 10:B; 16:25. ICor. 1:21; 3:5; 15:11. 

ICor 9:16. Gal. 1:23, 3:2,5. ITim 3:16, 

The distinction between believers and unbelievers, Rom 10:16 
11:20, ICor. 14:22-24; 2Cor 6:15, ITh. 1:7, 2:10,13; 2Th 1:10, 
3:2, ITim, 5:16, 6:2; Tit 1:6 i 

i Both 6 ^d 7 above could hav^^ncluded under faith as belief 
in truth, but I think that both in the above idea of preaching 
and in that of belief and unbelief there is more involved than 
simply intellectual acceptance or rejection of a teaching or doc¬ 
trine. It has to do with acceptance or rejection with the whole 
life. Hence I have included them under the category of loyalty, 
confidence, trust in the goodness and faithfulness of God, 
which inbues all of lii«.

3:26;. Eph. 1:13, 15.

2Th. 1:10. ( Reference to the P^irrousia.) 

D. The Measure of Faith, the Gift of Faith 

Two passages in the definitely Pauline literature 
are perplexing because they do not seem to fit at all well 
into the general picture of faith which Paul gives us. 

The first is found in Rom. 12:3 —’ ”by the grace 
given to me I bid every one amo^g you not to think of himself 






- 4^ - 


more highly that^^n he ought to think, but to think with sober 
judgment, each according to t he measure of faith which God has 
assigned to him," 

The other is in ICor. 12:9, listed among the gifts of 
the Spirit. ”to another faith by the same spirit.” i 

It is significant that each of these references to 
faith as something assigned tn measure is found in a context 
where the emphasis is on the Fellowship of believers, or of 
the Church as being One Body in Christ, and severally members 
one of another, with gifts varying as to their own special 
talents, even as the various members of the body all perform 
some function for the health and well-being of the body, in 
the which is equially important and indispensable, however 
humble its function. No member has any right to become puffed 
up because of the gift that is in him, or to exalt himself 
above his brother. "You have not so learned Christ.” 

Thus, in Rom. 12:3 — there is this background, that 
Paul fears some, priding themselves in their gifts, may become 
boastful and conceited because of them. He reminds them that 
they are the body of Christ, and individually members thereof 
(12;3), — all the members do not have the same function, but 
we simply have gifts that vary according to the grace given to 
us, which we are called to use without becoming puffed up as if 
these were human attainments. "What have you that you have 
not received?”

Let us examine this verse again to see if this 
background information will illuminate its meaning; 


"Each according to the measure of faith which God 
has assigned him."

An interesting parrallel is found in Luke 6:3^t 

"give, and it will be given to you, good measure, 
pressed down, shaken together, running over, will 
be put into your lap. For the measure you give 
will be the measure you get." 

The "measure of faith" must also be considered in 
conjunction whith verse 6 -- "Having gifts according to the 
grace given to us." 

It is at least possible that the meaning of measure, 

^ in vs. 3> above, is not so much the sense of a 
certain amount, an allotment, as the sense of a bowl, a measure 
of the grace of God in our hearts which comes by faith, and 
which constantly overflows into the "works of faith" lTh.l:3» 
2Th. 1:11, Tit. 3i^« Thus, we must not be puffed up, but 
hiilnibly thank God that through the faith athat is in our hearts 
and the gifts of the Spirit which have heightened our several 
talents, and differ as the grace of God deals differently 
with each one of us, we are able to serve the body of Christ. 

The Second passage, lCor.l2:9, enumerates faith as 
amoung the gifts of the Spirit for the upbuilding of the body 
of Christ; 


"to another, faith by the same spirit

But this seems to contradict all that we have lear¬ 
ned of Christ from Paul. Do not all who receive the gospel, 
being called, justified, consecrated, etc., have faith? Only 
on^^is it suggested that **not all have faith”, 2Th. 3*2 — 
and those are wicked and evil men who have rejected the gospel 
and live as enemies of the Cross of Christ. 

But here we have a prime instance of the folly of 
trying to force Paul’s thought into any system, hcv/ever, ad¬ 
mirable. Paul here is not systematizing. He is simply recong- 
nizing what we all have perceived in the fellowship of the 
Church; namely that while all who sincerely believe and live 
in the Gospel have faith, some seem to have such outstanding 
faith that they kindle all the rest of us with the fire that 
glows within them -- they have faith so as to remove mountains. 
They excel in faith 2 Cor. ^^7* and they prophesy in propor¬ 
tion to their faith. 

And it must be noted that, even if we allow the 
sense of ^Measure of Faith,” in the sense of allotment or 
proportion to Rom. 12:3? this measure or proportion is not 
something static in the Christian. No, it is constantly 
growing in us (unless by rejecting conscience we make ship¬ 
wreck of our faith, 2Cor. lOilSj Phil. 1:25, ITh. 3110, 2Th.l-3- 
and the final goal is that we shd.1 ”all attain to the unity 
of the faith and t)f the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature 
manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fulness of

Christ** Eph. 4•13* 

E. Faith and Rdighteounesness, variously described as 
Salvation, Justification, Righteousness, and Life. 

Paul*s most important use of the words for Faith 
occurs where he maintains that it is through faith alone, 
through the irapartation of the divine grace as a free gift, 
we receive salvation, and not through any human prescription 
such as circumcision, nor is there any basis for human 
boasting. It is a matter of faith from beginning to end. 
(rom. 1:17). 

1. An Awkward Passage. 

Before we consider these usages, hov/ever, we must 
take note of one passage which presents some difficulty. 

**For to this end we toil and strive, because we 
have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of 
all men, especially of those who believe.*’ ITim. 4il0. 

Now in the first half of this verse he is **running 
well,** in true Pauline form, but v^en he speaks of God as 
*’the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe,” I 
cannot but feel that the writer is out of harmony with the 
whole body of Paul’s great proclamation —it is only those 
who utterly trust in the sufficiency of God, who can truly 
be saved. I am grateful that this occurs in ITiraothy, one 
of the Pastoral epistles which are regarded by scholars

generally as being of later authorship than the genuine 
Pauline epistles, for I believe that in spite of the fact 
that Paul can be confined to no system, he does have a strong 
inner consistency with which this passage would not harmonize. 
The idea is essentially Greek, and Stoic, rather than having 
its roots in the Old Testament and in Christian experience, 
which we find so strongly in the genuine letters of St. Paul 

2. And now, our main theme... Righteousness by Faith. 

Paul with his contemporaries, both Greek and Jewish, 
maintained as fundamental that true life is found only where 
there is righteousness. Unlike them, his fundamental conten¬ 
tion was that this life, this righteousness, comes altogether 
apart from human achievement, that it was a gift of God, 
and a gift that comes through faith in Christ - *^the 
righteousness of God that depends on faith.” (Phil. 3*9* Gal. 
2 : 20 ) 

A. By Faith Shall the Righteous Live. 

His basic Old Testament text is found in Hab. 2:4 
”the just shall live by his faith,” A, V. 

The word of Habkkuk the prophet was that in the 
midst of universal destruction the upright man, the faithful 
man of integrity could put his trust in God who would pre¬ 
serve him, give him life, in recognition of his faithfulness. 

With Paul the same passage takes on an altogether

changed meaning. It comes to mean, ”By faith shall the 
righteous live (Moffat), or ”He who through faith is 
righteous shall live." (R.S.V.) Paul, like Habkkuk, still 
trusts in faithfulness to preserve him, but it is not his 
own faithfulness and integrity, which he knows is nothing 
in the sight of God "for all our righteousness is filthy 
rags." Is 64 : 6 . Rather he trusts in the faithfulness 
and loving kindness of God, in his unfathomable love and 
grace which have never failed (he has delivered us — 
in him will we put our trust that he will deliver us agin) 
and which comes, not as a reward, in recognition of service 
or virtue, but simply as his bounty to those whose whole 
life is founded on trust in him, and who find in that trust 
their life. "He who by faith is righteous shall live," 
because by this absolute trust he "gives unto the Lord the 
honor due unto his name.” and is acceptable in God^s sight. 
He is "in the right" with God, in the right relationship 
of creaturely dependence and trust and fellov/ship which res¬ 
tores to its true lines of beauty and nobility the image 
of God in him which had been effaced by his sinful self- 
assertion, pride and disobedience. 

But, the Judaisers claim, what about Abraham our 
forefather? The promise was given to him and to his off-

spring that they should inherit the earth, and the children 
of Abraham are those who have been circumcised according 
to the Covenant God made with Abraham, (Gen. 17:10-14)♦ 

Paul makes the core of his rebuttal the very story 
of the promise to Abraham which was the strong point of his 
opponents. With keen penetration he perceived and marshalled 
for his o\>ni purposes the fact that there are several layers 
of tradition in the Abraham story, and he goes to the earlier, 
prophetic tradition as basic, and essential. Indeed, hthe 
story of Abraham must have been particularly congenial for 
Paul, who saw in him a true hero of faith: 

"The conception of Abraham the Friend of God (Isa. 
41:^), who set out on perilous adventures in obedience to 
a divine leading, trusted to the Higher Power through many 
trials, lived in a hope which had no visible foundation, 
prayed for sinful Sodom with great humility before the Judge 
of all the earth (’Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak 
unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes’), and was willing 
to make sacrifice of his dearest treasure at the divine bid¬ 
ding -- this conception of the religious man has a real 
inward affinity with Paul’s." i 

C, H. Dodd, who says again, "Perhaps the chief 
positive tru-^h which emerges is that when Paul speaks of 
faith he is referring to something which did not begin with 
Christianity, but is an original and permanent element of 
all genuinely religious life, even though in some form of 
religion, as in the extreme legalist form of Judaism, faith 
is empty of meaning. " ii 

To be sure, says Paul, it was to Abraham that the 
promise whas given, "Thy seed shall inherit the earth."

But on what basis was that promise given, and who are the 
seed of Abraham? 

B. Faith as a Ground of Acceptance, 

Was that promise given on the basis of his cir- 
cumcision? Nay, rather, on the basis of faith, for before 
ever he was circumcised any more than any Gentile, "Abraham 
believed God, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness." 

Gen, 15t Rom. 4^3j Gal, 

Not that a righteousness was imputed to Abraham 
that he did not posses. Burton kas a good note here. 

"Neither the usage of K '*1. nor that of 

is decisive as between the two meanings; 

1. ’It was attributed to him as right conduct,’ i. e. ’he 
was accounted to have acted righteously,’ and (2) ’it was 
however, dealing predominantly with righteousness in the 
forensic aspect, acceptance with God, decides for the latter 
meaning. Against the argument probably advanced bj^ his 
opponents in Galatia to the effect that under the covenant 
with Abraham no one is acceptable to God who is not circum¬ 
cised (Gen, 17il4; cf, Jmb, Chap. 15i esp. ¥26), Paul points 
out that, according to the scriptures, to Abraham himself 
it was his faith that was accounted as ground of acceptance, iii 

Further, Paul maintains, this promise was made 
before there was any such thing as the Law, 430 years before 
Moses. Gal. 3*17. 

So God dealt with Abraham on the basis of his faith, 
and not through Works of the Law or through Circumcision, 
and the Promise was made to him apart from both. And God is 
the same. The basis on which he accepted Abraham is the same

basis on which any man is acceptable to him, apart alto¬ 
gether from considerations of legal righteousness or cir¬ 
cumcision, For with God there is no respect of persons. 

Rom. 4:11-12 . Gal. 3:6-9. 

C. Wnat then of the Promise? *'thy seed shall inherit 

the earth?” The true seed of Abraham, who shall inherit 
the earth, are those who have the same spirit of faith as that 
which dwelt in Abraham. So there is no room for boasting, 
for it all turns upon faith, and there is no room for ex¬ 
clusiveness, for it is feiven to all who believe, ”to the 
Jew first and also to the Greek.” Rom. 1:16. There is no 
basis whatever for importing Jewish nationalism into the 
growing Church, in which there was a new spirit of univer¬ 
sality with the promise of liberation for all mankind. To 
re-introduce the fulfilment of the Law and of Circumcision 
as the basis of acceptance before God is to lapse back into 
slavery, so that Christas death would be in vain, and faith 
empty of all meaning, and the promise nullified, (Rom. 4:14-15) 
For if we cannot obtain the promise without performing first 
the works of the law, then we are without hope, for as he 
stDUtly maintained in 2:1-3:20 of Romans, the Law is im¬ 
potent to create the righteousness which it requires, and 
only br^ings wrath - aggravating man’s sorry plight b]?*

deeds which have already undermined his life. No, if you have 
faith, ”if you are Christas, then you are Abraham*s off¬ 
spring, heirs according to promise.” Gal. 3^29, for ”ABraham 
is the father of all who believe.” Rom. 4:11, Gal 3:9. 

D. What then is the faith of Abraham ? and in what way 
was it shown? Why, says Paul, consider Abraham’s situation, 
a man of almost a hundred years, with a wife of ninety — 
who had been barren all her life. Why it was indeed 
laughable (Gen. 17:7), from the human point of view, to 
think that Abraham should ever have an heir according to 
God’s promise. But Abraham’s faith consisted just in this, 
that, even considering the hopelessness of his hope, still 
he hoped on, because he set his confidence in the Suffi- 
cienty of God, as being ’’able to perform that which he had 
promised.” Not that faith itself was a meritorious work, 
but simpy that through all his wanderings, Abraham had found 
God to be his ’’shield and exceeding great reward,” and had 
never found him to fail, and was so convinced by what God 
had done for him that he could not doubt his promises. 

”No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, 
but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, 
fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. 
Rom. 4:20 - 21. i 

E. From here Paul goes on to the basis of the Christian 
hope.

Why, Abraham’s hope, humanly speaking, lay in a womb 
that had been sterile for ninety years, and in a virility 
long since gone. And when he trusted that God would give 
him a son he showed that he believed in a God whose power 
was so great that he could even bring life out of death. 

And WQ also, who believe in Christ, believe in the God who 
has raised Jesus from the dead and has promised also to 
give us life out of death, to raise us up with Christ. 

So we are Abraham’s offspring, heirs according 
to the promise, and indeed through the Spirit which we have 
received through faith we do inherit the earth: 

’’For All things are yours, whether Paul or Applies 
or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or 
the future, all are yours: and you are Christ’s; and Christ 
is God’s.ICor; 3:22-^23.

CHAPTER VI 

THE NEW LIFE IN CHRIST 

Paul does not attempt to present a logically 
consisterjf and chronologically ordered sequence of the 
process of salvation. All is of God, and the workings 
of God cannot be reduced to the narrow limits of human 
comprehension (Rom, 11:33-36; Is. 40::13-14;)* 

It is foolish, then, to attempt to produce a 
^pattern of salvation^ of neat geometrical design and 
say, ’*Lo I Here is the way God works, according to Paul.” 
First there is his foreknowledge, then his predestina¬ 
tion, then his Call, then his justification. Woe unto 
us if we do so, for then when we try to see how to fit 
together all the fragmentary doxologies and exclamations 
of St. Paul into such a system we are thrice confounded. 

We are like Sadducees, to whom Jesus replied, ”Ye know 
neither the scriptures nor the pov^^er of God.” God is not 
bound, and neither is the mind of Paul, 

Rather, what we have in Paul is the reflection 
of the light pouring from the ”Sun of Righteousness,” 
and radiating in every direction into every dark cavern 
of the life of man; for”the Spirit of Man is the candle of 
the Lord,” and when man^s spirit is aglow with that fire of 
God which burns but does not consume (cf. Ex. 3*3) then 
it lights up all of life* i 


i Deissmann ibid, p, 143-145*

Perhaps we are under the same judgment in 
trying to classify in any way the thougii^of Paul. ^Ve 
do him wrong, being, so majestical.” (Hamlet, Act. 1. 

Sc. 1. ), and we cannot thus summon his spirit to answer 
to our designs. W@ cannot but try, however, to try to 
enter into his mind and to see something of the effulgence 
of the glory that he sees, in the hope that our life may 
be transformed by the same radiance that dazzled Paul on 
the road to Damascus, and thereafter took the scales from 
his eyes, that he might walk by that new light the rest 
of his days, and finally be taken up with Christ to realms 
of glory beyond compare ’’eye hath not seen, nor hath 
the ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man,” 
what God has prepared for those who love.” But God has 
nov; begun to reveal it by His Spirit In Jesus Christ. 

And Paul is God’s ambassdor, seeking to bring Christ to 
us, and us to Christ. So let us follow humbl}^ where he 
leads, that however, imperfectly, we may know him better. 

Instead of describing a process, Paul heaps up 
one metaphor upon another to tell of the manifold ways 
in which the light of God has shone upon him in the face 
of Jesus Christ. (2Cor 4*6) Each new picture portrays 
with vivid light against stygian darkness how the life of 
man has been transformed, saved, redeemed, freed, made 
rich. 

The only pattern lam able to discern in all this

is a thoroughgoing antithesis at every point between 
the old life with its sentence of death, and the new 
realm of life which is life indeed. 

Man was guilty beyond question: 

Rom. 1:1B-— 3:20 
Rom• 5:16 

Now he is acquitted (justified) Rom. 3:22~23,?6, 
2^,31. 4:4-11, 25; 5:1, 16,1^; ^:30, 33; 10:4.

3:B, 11, 24. Phil. 3:9; Titus 3:5-7. 

He was 'Vithout hope and without God in the 
world.'* (Eph. 2:12). 

Now he is saved : Rom. 5:9-10; S:24, 9:27,

And so Peace comes to him ^ a benediction from God . 

The ancient Hebrew greeting was "Peace be upon 
you," i and the Aaronic blessing: "the Lord Bless you 
and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you and I- 
be gracious unto you; the Lord life up his countenance 
upon you, and give you peace." (Num. 6:24-27.) 

And so'■also in the New Testament, at least in 

the letters of Paul, peace comes from God, both as a 

greeting and as a benediction. It is no mere subjective 

feeling, but also a matter of being in harmony with his 

will and purpose; a consequence of being in a relation 

of true and obedient, trusting sonship to him.

in "the inheritance of Light," and that a glory awaits 

him. Indeed, the joy and the hope have a very strong

In view of this, Paul cannot conceive how 
any Christian could slip back into subservience to 
that whoie power over him has been broken by the power of 
God in Christ. The wages of sin is death. (Rom. 6:23)* 

Why would any man forsake the wonderful inheri¬ 
tance of the saints in light to become again one of the 
slavish children of a law which can never bring righteous¬ 
ness? ^By works of the law shall no man be justified. 
(Rom. 3^20. Gal. 3«11. 

All is of God, who has called us by his Spirit. 
^’There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are 
in Christ Jesu's. For the law of the Spirit of life in 
Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and 
death.’’ Rom.^:2.

CHAPTER VII 
THE SPIRIT 

Spirit in the Old Testament. 

The root word for Spirit in the Old Testament is 
Ruach 77 y wind, breath with the associated 

ideas of unpredictability and of power, and life. The 
Spirit of man is his inmost nature, his intelligence and 
will, that which habitually controls and dominates his 
actions -- his "dominant impulse or disposition" i (cf. 

Gen. 36 : 35 , Num. 14:30, Ex 6;9, Prov. 14:29, 1 Sam. 1:15. 

Not only is the Spirit of man that element in 
his nature which controls or dominates his actions, but the 
more usual Old Testament notion, except in the Wisdoro Lite¬ 
rature, is that the controlling ruach is something other 
than the man, controlling and dominating him from the out¬ 
side. Is. 39:19, Mic 2:11; Hos.4:12, 5:4. man can 
control his nephesh . but it is the ruach which controls 
him." ii 

Ruach is not flesh, but is of God. 

"Although —— the Hebrews often spoke of the 
ruach as though it were part of the man, albeit the controlling 
element in him, yet they made a clear distinction between 
ruach (spirit) and basar (flesh). Man is flesh, made from 
THE dust of the earth, and animated by ruach , (spirit) so 


i Norman H. Snaith, The Distinctive Ideas of the Old Testa¬ 
ment , London, Epworth Press, 1944 ch. 7 p. I 46 

ii ibid. p. 149-150. the quote is from C. H. Dodd’s own 
Headingley lectures of 1937, The Doctrine of the Holy 
Spirit , p. 26 



























- 70 - 


that he is a nephesh (living being). The ruach is given 
by God; it is God^s neshama (breath). When this rnach 
returns to God, then man’s dust returns to the earth, 

Eccl. 12:7, Ps. I 46 - 4 . The division is man and flesh on 
the one side, God and ruach on the other. For example, 

’the Egyptians are men, and not God: and their horses 
flesh and not spirit’”, iii 

The Ruach-Adonai—^Spirit of the Lord: 

”The idea of a more-than-human power runs through 
the whole of the use of the phrase ruach - adonai . As a 
result of this special endowment of divine power men are able 
to do that which, in the ordinary way and relying upon purely 
human resources, they are quite unable to do.” cf. Judges 
3:10, 6:34, 11:29, 13:23, 14:6, 19:15, 15:14, cf. also i Ki. 
1 ^ 440 , ibid. p. 154 - 5 . 

This divine endowment was seen in anything which 
was superhuman and abnormal, as of the ’’superman” feats of 
Samson, or the catalepsy of Ezekiel ( Ezk. 4:1-6) or the 
dervish-like frenzy of Saul (1 Sam. 10:6-10; 11:6) but 
the idea was gradually ethicised as well as personalized, iiii 

’’The climax .... is the ruach-adonai by which the 
prophets are inspired. It comes from on high. Is. 32:15, It 
is good, Neh. 9:20, fs. 143:10. The Spirit of Hehovah was 
upon the Servant of the Lord, Is. 42:1; upon Israel’s seed 
Is. 44 : 3 , and upon the redeemed who were to come to Zion, Is. 
59:21. It is that spirit that will engender in the revived 
Israel a new heart and a new spirit, Ezek. 36:26, 27; 37:14. 

It inspired the prophet of the Lord who was anointed to 
preach good tidings to the meek. Is. 6l:l etc., and in the 
latter days, God will pour out his spirit upon all flesh, 

Joel 2:2S, f. ( 3 .If) etc. The Ruach - adonai cannot be hinde¬ 
red (is not ’straitened’) but is like His word, which shall 
not return unto Him void, but will accomplish that which He 
pleases, v 


III Is. 31:3. cf. also Ezek. 37:1-14, ibid. P. I 5 O-I 5 I. 
iv (ibid, p. 156 . cf. also on this point H. B. Swete, art. 
”Holy Spirit,” Hastings Dictionary of the Bible . vol. 2 
p. 404 a 

Is. 55:11, Snaith op. Git. p. 157.

So, Snaith concludes, 

"The word Ruach stands for power, strength, life, 
and is of God, and from God. The phrase ruach - adonai stands 
for that special power by which God inspires the individual 
man, enabling him to do the will of God, and thus to do those 
things which in his ovm strength he is wholly unable to do." i 

The Spirit in the letters of Paul. 

Identification of the Spirit with the Risen Lord. 

For Paul this creative, life-giving, powerful 
Ruach - Adonai of the Old Testament has become identified 
with the Spirit of the crecified and risen Christ. "The Lord 
is the Spirit." 2 Cor. 3:17-1^. For Paul as for the pri¬ 
mitive church: 

"There was an overwhelming sense of such divine 
power breaking in ... (Acts. 2:4) ••• proof that they were 
living in a new age inaugurated by the resurrection of 
Christ." ii 

Paul refers to the Spirit with a wonderfully rich 
variety of expression, but it is alv/ays the same spirit. It 
may be denominated simply as the Spirit (Rom. ^4-27, 12:11), 
or the Spirit of God (Rom ^:9; 14* ICor. 2:17; 2:12; 2:14; 

3:16; 6:11; 7^40), the Spirit of the Living God (2Cor. 3•3) 

The Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:3, 15:13-14; ICor. 6:19; 12:3; 5:19; 
2Cor. 6:6), or the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the 
Dead (Rom. ^:11). We find also,"The Spirit of life in 
Christ Jesus (Rom. S:2); The Spirit of Christ in us (RoiJ. 

^:9) God at work in us (Phil. 2:13). How close are these 


i ibid. p. 15^ - cf. also C. H. Dodd, Romans , op. cit. p.ll7 

ii G. H. Dodd, Romans p. 117-11^. 














terms is seen in 2Cor. 13:14 — the Fellowship of the Holy 
Spirit comes with the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the 
love of God, (cf, also Phil. 2:1) 


The Spirit in Paul 
Identification with the Risen Lord 

The same God who gives us the Holy Spirit {Rom. 5:5, 
calls us into the fellov/ship of his son, 1 Cor. 1:9* 

Paul appeals to the Christians at Rome for their 
peayers by the love of the Spirit, Ro©.15:30, and in 2 Cor. 
5:14, he confesses, ”the love of Christ controls us.** 

How close is this identification is seen in two 
passages where these different ways of speaking of the Spi¬ 
rit cluster together. 

**Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same 
Spirit ; and there are varieties of service, but the same 
Lord; and there are varieties of working, but it is the 
same God who inspires them all in every one.** 1 Cor. 12:-6. 

**But you are not in the flesh, you are in the 
Spirit , if the Spirit of God really dwells in you. Any one 
who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to 
him. But if Christ is in you , although your bodies are dead 
because of sin, your spirits are alive because of righteous¬ 
ness. If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead 
dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will 
give life to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which 
dwells in you. 

The Indv/elling Spirit 

Here is not a God far off, but near at hand. The 
highly exalted Christ has become the indwelling power in the 



















- 73 - 


Believer. We are united with the Lord, and become one 
Spirit with him. (Icor. 6:17), God^s Temple, in whom God^s 
Spirit Dwells. (IGor. 3 *‘16, Eph. 2:22) 

A Christian is **a man in Christ." 2Cor. 12:2. 
and if he dwells in us and we in him, can we cry with Paul, 
"I can do all things in him who strengthens me." Phil. 4^13* 
For it is the indwelling spirit of Christ which is "the 
Power at work within us," whereby God is "able to do far 
more abundantly than all we ask or think." Eph. 3:20, "We 
have come to fullness of life in him. " Col. 2:10. And, as 
Paul describes his life, "I have been crucified with Christ, 
it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me," 

Gal. 2:20. 


Schweitzer has a worthwhile comment on this 
"dhrist-mysticism 

"The concept of being-in-Christ dominates Paulas 
thought in a way that he not only sees in it the source of 
every thing connected with redemption, but describes all the 
experience, feeling, thought and will of the baptized as 
taking place in Christ. Thus the phrase ’in Christ Jesus’ 
comes to be added to the most varied statements, almost as 
a formula."^! Schweitzer further says, "Though the expres¬ 
sion, has thus almost the character of a formula, it is no 
formula for Paul. For him every manifestation of the life 
of the baptized man is conditioned by his being in Christ. 
Grafted into the corporeity of Christ, he loses his crea¬ 
tively individual existence and his natural personality. 
Henceforth he is only a form of manifestation of the per¬ 
sonality of Jesus Christ, which dominates that corporeity, ii 


i Schweitzer, Albert, The Mysticism, Paul the Apostle, 
from the German Die Mystik Des Apostels Paulus 1929 
translated by William Montgomery, New York, Henry Hold 
and Company, ch. 6. p. 124 

ii ibid. p. 125 . 








- 74 - 


I cannot agfcee with Schweitzer here, however, 
when he speaks of the loss of the "creatively individual 
existence and his natural personality." Such a view is not 
in keeping with the Old Ti^stament idea of the Spirit of God, 
which instead of destroying the personality and mind of the 
prophet rather heightened and illuminated all his powers that 
he might speak through him. This idea of Schweitzer’s is 
more Gr^ek than Christian. The Christian is not merely 
lost in the divine being; he loses himself only to find 
himself. He comes to himself (as the prodigal when he 
retuBned to his father). 

James Stewart has I believe a sounder approach 
when he says: 

"We must guard, however, against conveying the 
impression that such union implies virtual absorption of a 
pantheistic kind. Nothing was further from Paul’s thoughts. 
Here again his doctrine runs along a different line from 
that of Philo. ’When the divine light blazes forth,’ said 
Philo, ’the human light sets; ahd when the former sets, the 
latter rises. The reason within us leaves its abode at the 
arrival of the divine Spirit, but when the Spirit departs 
the reason returns to is place.’ This suggest that what 
the diving immanence does is to impair or even destroy the 
distinctness of the human personality. But hhere is certain¬ 
ly no hint of any such idea in Paul. He never thought of 
Christ as overriding any man’s individuality. Union with 
Christ, so far from obliterating the believer’s personal 
qualities and characteristics, throws these into greater 
“belief. How far any thought of absorption was from the 
apostle’s mind is evidenced by such statements as these: 

’As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons 
of God’. ’The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, 
that we are the children of God.’

The passage which, on a superficial view, comes nearest 
proclaiming the end of all personal identity — live, yet 
not I, but ^hrist liveth in me’ — is followed immediately by 
the significant words, ’the life which I nov/ live in the 
flesh I live by the faith of the Son^ of God’ ’’(where the I 
and Thou stand over against each other*)’” .*•* Christian ex¬ 
perience does not depersonalize men and reduce them to a mo¬ 
notonous uniformity; it heightens every individual pov/er 

they have.(ref. to ICix^* 12:4 ff)* ’’More convincing 

than anything Paul ever said about this is the evidence of 
his own life. Study the record of that amazing career, mark 
the impact which this God-filled and Christ-mastered soul 
made upon the life of men and Churches and nations, and then 
declare if he was lacking in individuality^ I No, it was any¬ 
thing but a blurring and obliteration of personality that 
resulted from the Damascus experience. Every quality of 
heart and brain and soul which the man possessed was lifted 
into sudden, new distinctness and vigour. This was what 
union with Christ meant to Paul, and what he believed it could 
mean to all the world.” 

(James S. Stewart, A Man in Christ , the Vital 
Elements of St. Paul’s Religion, London, Hodder and Stoughton, 
1935, P* 166-16^. The quotation from Philo is from Quis Rerum 
Divinarum Heres sit , 249) 

As C. H. DodcJ remarks parenthetically, ”The ease 
with which Paul Passes from ^ the Spirit to the Spirit 
within you may be partly due to the familiar use of the 
word in Greek, to denote a kind of rarefied atmosphere; you 
can live in an atmosphere, and at the same time breathe it in.” 

(C. H. Dodd. The Epistle of Paul to the Romans. 

Moffat Nev/ Testament Commentary series, Harper and Bors. New 
York and London, 1932, p. 122). 

The fact that this indwelling spirit is virtually 
indentified with the historiaal Jesus is of the utmost impor¬ 
tance. It means that everywhere in Paul Mysticism is mingled 
with morality, and morality empowered by the pneumatic. As 
C. H. Dodd has said, ”by ’spirit’, Paul means the supernatural 
or divine element in human life, and his test for it is the 
presence of a love like the love of God in Christ.” ibib. p.ll^. 
And, again, ”his virtual identification of the experience of 
the Spirit with the experience of the indwlling Christ is of

the utmost value. It saved Christian thought from falling 
into a non-moral, half-magical conception of the supernatural 
in human experience, and it brought all ’spisitual^ expe- 
rince to the test of the historical revelation of God in 
Jesus Christ.ibid. p.l24. 

Schweitzer brings out the contrast with the 
Hellenistic mystery religions when he says;. 

"The fact that the believer’s whole being, down 
to his most ordinary everyday thoughts and actidns, is thus 
brought within the sphere of the mystical experience has its 
effect of giving to this mysticism a breadth, a permanence, 
a practicality and a strength almost unexampled elsewhere 
in mysticism. Certainly in this it is entirely different from 
the Hellenistic mysticism, which allov^ed daily life to go its 
own way ap'rt from the mystical experience and without re¬ 
lation to it." op. cit. p. 125 . 

The connection of the Spirit of God, the Spirit, 
or the Holy Spirit with the Spirit of Jesus is strongly 
brought out by the use of the phrase "in the name of the 
Lord Jesus Christ." 

The Old Testament background of this expression 
throws considerable light on Paul’s usage. 

In the Old Testament, as in any literary usage, 
the Name of an object, place or person was used to desig¬ 
nate the same or to distinguish it from others. By trans¬ 
ference, the Name naturally attached to itself the reputa¬ 
tion or fame of the object, place or person. 

"But the more peculiar senses of the term are due 
to the close relation that was supposed to exist between the

name and the personality. It is a widely spread belief among 
primitive and less developed peoples that one who knows a 
personas name has power over the bearer of the name •••. It 
was but a modification of such belief that made the Hebrew 
frequently use ’name’ as almost an equivalent of the 
’personality’ or ’character’ or nature of the person or 
thing named.” 

(G. B. Gray, art. ’’Name” in Hastings Dictionary 
of the Bible , vol 3* p* 47^b) 

The name naturally came to express authority and 
by transference, when someone’s name was called over a per¬ 
son, place or thing, it came under his authority, passed 
under his possession, ibid. 47^b. That a man’s name, 
should be noted over another or over a place or an object 
denoted ownership, however acquired, coupled with the idea 
of protection. 

How this idea is carried over to the relation 
between Jehovah and his people is seen in Is. 26:13 
(cf. 63:19) 

”0 Lord our God, other lords beside thee have 
had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention 
of thy name.” 

Gray maintains that to bring out the antithesis 
here between the first and second half of the verse, the second 
half should re rendered ’’but thee (to wit) thy name $ authority) 
alone will we (in future) mention (i. e. acknowledge), 
ibid. p. 479a. 

The distinctive use of the ’’name of J” ’is ”as 
a succinct expression for the repealed character of God;

for all that is knovm of him." ibid, p, 479a. 

The idea of possession is specially seen in that 
wherever God has appeared to men, made himself knov/n to them, 
that place is connected with the name of God. — His name is 
named over it, and it becomes specially his. ”From the time 
of Deuteronomy onwards Jerusalem, became the one special seat 
of the divine presence in Israel; there, therefore he is 
said to cause his name to dwell or abide? e. g. Dr. 12:11 
ibib. p. 479a. surrogate: 

Another characteristic and special use of the 
name of "belongs to a series of phrases, to which the 
^glory of J"’, ’the face of J"’, ’the angel of J’” also 
belong, by which the Hebrews endeaboured to distinguish 
between the Deity in himself and the Deity as manifested 
to and coming into relation with men." ibid. 479b. 

In the late Old Testam.ent usage of the "name of J"’ 
is used simply as a substitute, or surrogate, for God. cf. 
Lev, 24:11-16o ibid, 479b. 

V/hen we turn to Paul, we note som.e striding simi¬ 
larities to that which has been described above for the 
Old Testatment. 

Paul places in parrallelism the Name of God, or 
the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the Power of God, 
or the power of the Lord Jesus Christ. Rom. 9*17; 15^9, (the 
mercy of God). 2Th. 1:11-12, and ICor. 5:3"5*

passage is specially interesting: 

have already pronounced judgment the name 
of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing 

When you are assembled, and my spirit is present, 
with the power of our Lord Jesus," the sentence is to be 

carried out. 

The idea of authority and power is very definitely 
connected with "the name that is above every man," i, e, above 
every authority and dominion and power —• the name of Lord, 
(Kurios) which is the name reserved for God himself. Phil 2:9-11 
Eph. 1:19-21. 

Hence, with this authority in mind, Paul beseeches 
or commands the Churches to certain courses of action. 

L Cro. 1:10, 2Th. 3^6; 2Tim. 2:19* cp. Eph. 3*3 -- as if 
even to name the contrary forces of iniquity and immorality 
were to admit their power over us. 

So in Ephesians and Co!^osians there is the in- 
ju^tion to do everything in the name of the Lord Jseus Christ, 
"giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God 
the Father." Co. 3‘17, Eph. 301^* Note that in the Eph. 
passage vs. 1^ — "Be filled with the Spirit" is par^allel 
to the giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

Evidence that the "name of the Lord Jesus Christ" 
is used much like the Old Testament use of the "name of J"^ 
to represent "a succinct expression for the revealed cha¬ 
racter of God, for all that is know of him." (see above) is

found in two passages particularly: Rom 10:11 *'’No one who 
believes in him will be put to shame,(cf 1 Cor.1:10). 

For every one who calls upon the name of the 
Lord will be saved. cfl. Joel 2:32. — in connection with 
the promised outpouring of the Holy Spirit. 

^*And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will 
pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and it shall come to pass, 
that whos^oever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be 
delivered: 


The connection between "the name of the Lord Jesus 
Christ and the Spirit is even more explicit in 1 Cor. 6:11; 

"You were washed, you were consecrated, you were 
justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the 
Spirit of our ^od." 

Find.ly, a direct connection can be seen between 
Is. 26:13 and 63:19 mentioned above that this passage from 
L cor., which emphasizes the sole Lordship of God in Christ 
over the Christian: 

"For although there may be so-called gods in heaven 
or on earth—■ as indeed there are many ^gods’ and many (lords’ 
■—■ yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all 
things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, 
through whom are all things and through whom we exist.” 

L Cor. S:5“6. cf. also 1 Cor. 6:15-20. "You are not your 
own" the place where the Lord causes his name to dwell 
beconies His. Thus the Christian has another dimension added 
to his life, not to escape from the world of time and space 
and work and mutability and death, but to claim all those 
things for the^ternal, for Christ, for ’No man lives to 
himself and no man dies to himself -- for to this end Christ 
both died and rose again, that he might be Lord both of the 
dead and of the living." 

As in the Old Testament there is in Paul’s 
writings a direct contrast between the flesh and the Spirit.

And not only a contrast, but a constant warfare, between 
the Lord who is the Spirit, and the life of the flesh; 
between the life that is Christ-centered and that which is 
man-centered. Rom S:4-13 2Cro. ^:16-17^ Gal 5:16-24. Phil.3 0, 
1^-19. Gal. 6:^. 1 Cor. 2:12 - the Spirit of the world. 

Eph. 2:l-2-the Spirit at work in the sons of disobedience. 

It is unthiriable that he who has been united to the 
risen body of Christ should live in stjxual immorality; Shall 
I take the members of Christ and join them to the members 
of a prostitute? Never I It is unthinkable. ICor. 6:16. 

If the Spirit of God dwells in you, are are God^s temple. 

To live in immorality is to pollute the temple of God, and 
the temple of God is holy, which temple you are(lCor. 3^16-17, 
6:19; Eph. 2:22) 

Those who live dissolute lives ^^live as enemie® 
of the cross of Christ. Their end is destruction, their 
God is the belly, and they glory in their shame, with their 
minds set on earthly things.” Phil. 3•1^-19. 

And not only the sense of physical impuritj^ are 
”of the flesh”. ”You are the body of Christ, and individually 
members of it.” ICor. 12:2?. And anything which rends 
asunder the members of the body of Christ is of the flesh 
rather than, of the Spirit. Ro^j. 16:17-1B; 2Cor. 3*3-4, Phil.

2:20-21; Gal. 5:26, So, when Paul catalogues the ^^works of 
the flesh, in Galatians, he includes ^enmity, strife, jea¬ 
lousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy,^* 
Gal. 5:20-21. 

Not only so, but the attempt to achieve righteous- 
ness by the law is a^entially ”of the flesh”, because it is 
based on human pride and achievements rather than on trust 
in God and in the power of his Spirit; Rom 2:27-29; 7:4-6; 
Gal. 3:2-5; 3:1^; Phil 3:2-3. 

So we are ^called to belong to Jesus Christ,” 

Rom. 1:6; Phil 3:14; 2Cor 5:13; Eph. 1:11-12; Phil 1:10-11. 

And the call is, ”If we live by the Spirit, let us also 
walk by the Spirit.” Gal. 3:25. Col 2:6-7, 3:1-3. 

But unlike the old call of the law to righteousness, 
with Christ and with the Spirit we receive not only the call 
but the power to perform that which is required of us: 

”If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the 
dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the 
dead will give life to your mortal bodies also through his 
Spirit which dwells in you,” Rom. 3:11. 

”Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified 
the flesh with its passions and desires.” Gal. 5:24* 

”If by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the 
body you will live.” Rom. 3:13. 

We will be sustained to the end, ”guiltless in the 
day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithfull, by whofla 
you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ 
our Lord. ” 1 Cor. 1:9. 






- ^3 - 


God is the source of our life in Clririst Jesus, 

"whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and consecra¬ 
tion and redemption."! Cro. 1:30. 

"God raised the Lord and v/ill also raise us 
by his power," ICor. 6:14. 

"Vi/ork out your own salvation with fear and 
trembling, for God is at work in you both to will and to 
do his good plx*easure." 

Not that 1 have already attained, but press 
forvjard to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made 
me his own." Phil 3^12. 

"I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth ih me." 

Gal. 2:20. 

"The Love of Christ controls us." 2Cor. 5^14-15. 

The Body of Christ. Gifts of the Spirit for its Upbuilding. 

As I have mentioned above, the believer is drawn 
into union with the body of Christ. (ICor. 6:15, but it is 
a corporate body, in which all who belong to Christ are 
members (ICor. 12:12-13,27) Eph. 4*15-16.) 

And just as to Israel of old the Spirit brought 
the Special endowments of God to individual men, priests, 
craftsmen, warriors, kings and projjhets for the service of 
the whole people, so in the New IsEael no one is left with¬ 
out some gift from God, so that in the Lord he might minister 
to the upbuilding of the body of Christ in mutual helpful¬ 
ness and service. And all this variety of Gifts, as various 
as the persons themselves who are called into the life of 
the Spirit, is given by the same Lord, the same Spirit, the 
same God (ICro.12:4-6). "To each is given the manifestation

of the spirit for the common good.” -- ICor 12:7. So 
one is specially endowed with wisdorr^. another with knowledge 
another with faith, another with gifts of healing, while 
others perform miracles, speak in tongues, distinguish 
between the spirit®, whether they be of God, and some are 
prophets, and some apostles. ICor. 12:B-11, 2^-31. All 
are given by the same spirit, and each is equally necessary 
to the health and well-being of the Body of Christ. (ICor.12 
14 - 26 .) 

But the greatest gift of all, and one which the 
Spirit gives to all who are truly ”in Christ” is the gift 
of love, without which all other gifts are of no value. 
(ICor.13 passim) 

To know Christ is to be ”Sooted and Grounded in Love.” 

For it is as we are rooted and grounded in his 
love that we come to know Christ himself, and the greatest 
gift he can give to us is himself. 

To know Christ is not to have a speculative 
knowledge of his nature and being. ”This is to know Christ 
to know his benefits.” 

To have him living in our lives and trans^forming 
them by his love. The human intellect is not able to com¬ 
prehend Christ. He is to the Jews a stumbling block, and 
to the Greeks sheer folly. Rather the knowledge of Christ 
comes to us through his Spirit, which takes the things of

Christ and shov/s them unto us, "What eye hath not seen, 
nor hath the ear heard, nor hath it entered into the 
heart of man, God has made known to us by the Spirit." 

ICor 2:6-12. "We have the Spirit which is from God, 
that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God." 

6:2 

The law comes as a veil between the eyes of the 
Jew and the glory ofChrist, and it is only through Christ 
that the veil is taken away, "Now the Lord is the Spirit, 
and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedon. a 
And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the 
Lord, are being changed into his likeness from one degree 
of glory to another; for this comes fromtthe Lord who is 
the Spirit." 2Cor. 3-12-1^. 

This gospel,this knowledge of Christ is not hidden 
but open to all men, and it is only those whose minds have 
been blinded by the God of this world who cannot see the 
glory of Christ, who is the likeness of God. 2Cor. 40-4* 

"For it is the God who said, ^Let light shine out of dark¬ 
ness,’ who has shone in our hearts to give the light of 
knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ." 
2Cor. 4:6. cf. John i:14, 17:24, So also Gal. 1:12, Eph.1:17-19 
3:3-6, and Eph. 3:17-19: ^^and that Christ may dwell in your 
hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded 
in love, may have power to comprehend with all the saints 
what is bhe breadth and length and height and depth, and to 
know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you 






- 36 - 


may be filled with all the fullness of God.^* 

To Know Christ is to Share his Sufferings. 

Indeed, to know Christ fully is to share his suf¬ 
ferings and death, as one fully knows any loved one by 
going with him (her) through all things and finally death. 

Paul says to the Philippians, ’^have this mind in 
you, which was in Christ Jesus,’* and tells them of that mind 
which humbled itself and was obedient unto death, even 
death upon a cross. Phil 2:5* C. P. 2Th. 1:3. 

And of himself in the same letter he speaks of the 
surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord, (3^^); 
making it his one aim ”to gain Christ and be found in him,” 
Phil. 3*9 ”that I may know him and the pov/er of his 

resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like 
him in his death, that if possible I may attain the resur¬ 
rection from the dead.” Phil. 3*10. i 

It is a great privilege to suffer for his sake. 

Phil. 1:29. for ”as we share abundantly in Christ’s suf¬ 
ferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort 
too.” 2Cor. 1:5* 

And we have in Col. 1:24 — ”Now I rejoice in my 
sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I complete what re¬

that is, the church, -- not that anything is lacking in 
the sufferings of Christ, but that there remains much for 
his servant to suffer before he shares completely in the 
sufferings which Christ endured for the sake of his church. 

And the call to Timothy is ’’Take your share of 
sufferings as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.” 

But we are not merely called to endure suffering as 
good soldiers who grit their teeth, grin and bear it. For our 
sufferings are endured with jo)^, because they are a sign to us 
that we are sharing in the death of Christ, and that we shall 
share in the resurrection life of Christ. For in the midst 
of all our sufferings we have received the Spirit of Sonship, 
whqreby we cry to God in trust and love, Abba Father; for 
he has called us in love to be his sons, and we have the 
Spirit within our helper, in all our v/eakness, interceding 
with us before God. Rom. ^:26-27. 

”In the Spirit, by faith, we wait for the hope of 
righteousness.” Gal. 5•5* 

There is a great tension between the taste of the 
glory of God which we now have, and the glory that is to be 
revealed. Not only we,but the whole creation eagerly long 
for the revealing of ’the glorious liberty of the childred 
of God.’ Rom. S:lS-23. 

”My soul waitebh for the Lord more than they that 
watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch

for the morning. 

Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord there 
is mercy, and with him is plenteous.redeption.Ps 126:6-7* 

But already we have received so mueh wealth of 
God^s Spirit that we know it to be the seal of our sonship, 
the guarantee that we are Christas and that he will preserve 
us to the end. It is the earnest, the downpayment, of the 
life that is eternal in glory, that we know even in this 
life. Rom. g:26, 2Dor. 5:5, Gal. 6:^, Eph. 1:13, Gal. 5:5 
”For ’Though him we have obtained access to this 
grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in our hope of 
obtaining the glory of God. 

More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, 
knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance 
produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does 
not disappoint us, beccusse God’s love has been poured out 
into our hearts throughjt the Holy Spirit which has been 
given to us.” Rom. 5:2-5 

This hope is no ungrounded optimism, but based 
on a sure foundation -- the love of God in Christ from which 
nothing can separate us, either now o!^ hereafter. 

Suffering is now the evidence of our sonship, for 
Christ also suffered for our sakes, and if we suffer with 
him we shall also be glorified with him (Phil. 3:10-11, Rom 
^:17)* Ho longer is our suffering the evidence of God’s 
vjrath against us, as it was when we lived by the flesh and

knew that we were under the sentence of death. Now in all 
our sufferings we know that the love of God is working 
for us, for we know that ^he has called us according to his 
purpose, and that he is working together with us for our 
good in all things, even suffering. For we have been called, 
and being called we have known his saving power, and being 
so justified we see the evidence of that sentence of justi¬ 
fication, of acquittal,of forgiveness, of freedom, in the 
nev/ glory that shines in our lives. So vivid is that glory 
that we now have that it is as if the glory that is to be 
revealed has already come to pass (note the aorist tense of

been the name Kyrios, Lord, even the name God had reserved 
to himself, and has nov; given also to his Beloved, 

But no, this is absurd, for Jesus himself died 
for our sakes, and as he is at the right hand of God he does 

not condemn us, but intercedes for us, Why it was through 

this same Jesus that God^s love was poured out to save us. 

How great is the love which surrounds us? There 
is no tribulation, no power of any kind that can separate 
us from the Love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
And so Paul sums up his Gospel not in theology but in 
doxology. 


^’Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? 
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, 
or nakedness, or peril, or sword? . 

No, in all these things we are more than con¬ 
querors through him who loved us. For I am sure that 
ne ither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, 
nor things present, nor things to come, nor pov/ers, nor 
height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will 
be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus 
our Lord.” Rom S:35, 37-39. Cf. also Is. 50:^-10. 

Thus we find that Paulas reference to the Spirit 
finds its roots in the Old Testament, for God is ever the 
same, and as he dealt with the prophets of old so he deals 
now with his servants in Christ. He still sends forth his 
breath with power, lifting men up above what they could 
ever hope to do on their own resources. The spirit of man 
is still the candle of the Lord, responsive by God. God 
still heightens and transforms every human gift by His

Spirit, for he is the giver of life itself, and of every 
human talent which he lefts up and consecrates by the 
Spirit. And as the greatest gift God gave to men of old 
by his Spirit was the gift of himself (’*1 am thy. shield 
and thy exceeding great reward,^* (Gen. 15«1;) So now he 
gives himself to us in Christ --’*for me to live is Christ, 
and to die is gain,” (Phil. 1:21) Now as before the know¬ 
ledge of God comes pre-eminently through suffering. Job 
wrestled long and hard with the question ”V\[hy do the inno¬ 
cent suffer, and the wicked get off scot-free” — wrestled 
with it because he had to, for in all integrity he believed 
himself to be innocent, and yet who had greater sufferings 
than his? At the last, with head bowed in deep humility 
and yet with a glory in his eyes, he says, ”I have heard 
of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now mine eye seeth 
thee,” (Job. 42:5)* But the New Testament has a new word 
to say in the Spirit concerning suffering ”for the sake of 
the Gospel.” Our sufferings are no longer hidden in the 
inscrutable providence of God; we know their purpose — 
and we receive them with rejoicing, for they are a great 
privilege granted to us -- to share the sufferings of 
Christ, in the same love with which he suffered, that 
we might share in his resurrection and its pov/er, and live

with him both now and forever. So in Christ the Spirit comes 
with power greater than ever before; for now the love of 
God shines forth brighter than ever men had seen it, for 
their eyes were veiled by their atte?ipts to establish their 
own. righteousness or to seek their own glory. For ’^God^s 
love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy 
Spirit which has been given to us.” (Rom. 5*5)• Only in 
Christ do we see with unveiled eyes the greatness of God^s 
love for us; and here is a miracle, a pov/er, that surpasses 
all others. For what power is greater than the power of 
love? Nothing can separate us from the love of God in 
Christ Jesus. Thus Paul is speaking of the call of God^s 
Spirit to him and to all men who are ”In Christ” when he 
exults: ”For it is the God who said, ^Let light shine out 
of darkness,^ who has shone in our hearts to give the light 
of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.” 

(2Cor. 4^6).

CHAPTER VIII 


LOVE 


Love in Greek literature is identified with Eros, desire, 
or Philos, friendship, the love of the soul; each of which 
imply the seeking in another, whether man or God, of that 
which will provide that which the lover needs, which will 
complete his incompleteness, v/hether physical or intellec¬ 
tual, moral or spiritual. 


The New Testament conception of love is not erotic; 


indeed, the word eros is not found in the New Testament, 
and Phileo only twenty-four times. The New Testament has 



a new, distinctive word for love: the word Agape 


which occurs in its various forms 33^ times (135 in the Pauline 
literature.). 

Agape is distinguished from both eros and philos 
in that is a giving imparting love rather than a grasping, 
acquisitive love. It is a love grounded in the love of 
God,: ”God shows his love for us in that while we were yet 
sinners Christ died for us.” Rom. 5^^. 

While it is possible for a distinction to be made 
between love, grace, and mercy, as Snaith has done for the 
Old Testament, (Distinctive ideas, op. cit. ch. 5-6) these 
three ways of expressing the outgoing, saving love of God 
and of men in whom God^s love is at work are so mingled and 
merged with one another in the New Testament that they are, 
like the different exprewsions for salvation, practically

synonymous, and clear-cut distinctions are almost impos¬ 
sible. Therefore all three are treated here under the 
central, dominant theme of love. 

The reader may perhaps be somewhat puzzled at 
the order in which this subject of love is treated. Two 
difficulties which present themselves here are: first, 
the extreme difficulty of classifying at all in dealing 
with so fluid a subject, and secondly the problam of arri¬ 
ving at a suitable conclusion and climax for the whole 
work. Admittedly the love of God comes before the love 
of brethren, and is its source and ever-flowing fountain. 

But the love of God is not only that which we begin our 
Christian life, it is that which sustains us throughout, 
and that in which we put our trust at the end. The love 
of God floods our hearts at the beginning, and the love 
of God in Christ is our benediction; in him is our Nunc

The Greek word translated in the English versions 
above as ”controls^* and as ”constraineth” is Sun-Echei -- 
(S'^ t X ^ ^ which means literally ’’holds together”. So, 
the phrase might legitimately be construed ’’the love of 
Christ holds us together”. Indeed, it is the love of God 
in Christ that is the binding agent in the Christian fellow¬ 
ship. V/henever a Paul is exhorting the churches to live 
in hqrmony, to be humble, unselfish, generous, considerate 
and loving in their relations one with another, he points 
to the love of Christ -- ’’Have this mind among yourselves, 
which you have in Christ Jesus.” (Phil 2:5* cf. also Eph. 
4:32-5:2. Gal. 2:20; 2Gor. 5:13-14-17. 

Love Among the Brethren. 

This love within the fellowship is no mere human 
attainment, but it is truly God’s love within their hearts 
overflowing towards the brethren. 

ITh. 3:12; Col 2:2. lTh.4:9. 

Love is the first-fruits of the Spirit, and the 
and the power at work in us to produce all the other 
Christian ’virtues’ Gal. 5:22. Further, this love growls 
as we are knit together with Christ in love. Eph. 4:15-16, 
cf. John 15:1-6. 

Love is the key-note of the true unity of belie¬ 
vers in Christ. ITh. 1:2-3; 2Th. 1:3> Eph. l:15j Co. 1:4* 
Paul sets forth love as the standard for all the actions

of the Christian and of the Christian community. Rom 12:9; 
ICor. 16:14; Love is the fulfulling of the law, for love^ 
does no harm to neighbour; Gal. 5:13-14; Rom. 13:B-10. 

But love goes far beyond the negative aspect of doing 
nothing to hurt a neighbour. "Love builds up," ICor. B:l. 

It "binds everything together in perfect harmony." Co. 3-14. 
Indeed, love is the "one thing needful" {cf.Lk.10:42), and 
from this conviction Paul pours out his great hymn bo love i 
in the thirteenth chapter of list Corinthians: 

"If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, 
but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. 
And if I have prophetic pov/ers, and understand all myste¬ 
ries and all knov>^ledge, and if I have all faith, so as to 
remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I 
give away all that I have, and if I deliver by body to be 
burned, but have not love, I am nothing." 

"Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or 
boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist 
on its own v/ay; it is not irritable or resentful; it does 
not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears 
all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures 
all things." 

"Love never ends;..... 

"So faith, hope, love, abide, these three; but the 
greatest of these is love." ICor. 13^1-^, 13- 


i Christian Casuistry. 

When Paul deals with particular problems arising 
among the Christians and in the various churches owing to 
special local situations, his casuistry is not merely the 
balancing and tempering, or even the temporising or com¬ 
promising of ethical principles with practical needs which 
is associated with the term "casuistry"; it is the appli- 










- 94 - 


catioQ of one basic principle, the principle of love by which 
Christ always walked, to every particular problem, howso¬ 
ever great or small in itself. The watchword is, ^^Make 
love your ain^^’lCor. 14:1, cf. also 2Cor 13:11 — "Live 
at peace, and the God of peace and love will be with you." 

Thus the vexed question of foods, which some of 
those who came over from Judaism regarded as unclean, es¬ 
pecially the meat sold at the market-places which had been 
previously offered in sacrificial rites at the temples of 
the heathen deities; A Christian is free with regard to all 
ritual regulations coticerning food and drink, and he who is 
enlightened in the faith knows that idols have no real 
existence and no power over him who bears the name of 
Christ (ICor. But he must in love respect the 

scruples of his less enlightened brother, and do nothing 
to damage his faith, which like a tender young plant might 
be so easily destroyed. 

"If your brother is being injured by what you eat, 
you are no longer walking in love. Do not let what you 
eat cause the ruin of one for whom Christ died." Rom. 14:13* 

"Let us then pursue what makes for peace and 
mutual upbuildihg. Do not for the sake of food destroy 
the work of God." Roml 14:19* 

"’All things are lawful’, but not all things 
are helpful. ’All things are lawful’, but not all things 
build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good 
of his neighbour. ICor. 10:23-24* 

The missionary offering for the poor saints at 
Jerusalem is an opportunity to show the genuineness of their 



- 95 - 


love (2Cor remembering ”The grace of our Lord 

Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake 
he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become 
rich.” 2Cor. B/9* And, Paul adds, let it be done freely 
not rel\2Ctantly nor under compulsion, ’for God loves a 
Cheerful giver’”. 2Cor. 9**7. 

Christian discipline must not become vindictive, 
but when the erring brother, once reproved, shows himself 
truly repentant, he should be restored ”in love and the 
spirit of gentleness.” ICor. 4*21. Further, ’’you should 
rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be over¬ 
whelmed by excessive sorrow. So I beg you to reaffirm your 
love for him.” 2Cor. 2:7-9 

The org<|fiization and the affairs of the church 
should be ruled by the principle of love. ITh. 5:12-13. 

Paul notes with sorrow the ppirit of faction 
even in Christian preaching, but is comforted that not 
all preach from envy and rivalry, but from good will, 
out of love. Phil 1:15-16. 

The same spirit of love is to be extended to the 
relations between masters and slaves who are brothers in 
Christ. Paul urges his well-to-do friend and fellow 
Christian Philemon to receive back his run-away slave, 
now turned Christian, as more than a slave, ”as a beloved 
brother.” Philemon 15-17*

The writer of First Timothy urges slaves who belong to 
believing masters not to be disrespectful because their 
masters are brethren: ^’rather they must serve all the better, 
since those who benefit by their service are believers 
and beloved,” ITira, 6:2. 

Marital relations also should come under the 
Spirit of the gospel, albeit with the ancient Jewish bias 
Eoncerning the subordinate position of woman. Eph. 5 * 25 ; 2B; 
Col 3:19* The writer of First Timothy holds a rather low 
estimate of the place of women in the Church, but he grud¬ 
gingly admits: ”Yet woman will be saved through bearing 
children, if she continues in faith and love and holiness, 
with modesty. ” ITim. 2:15. 

Love is one of the duties of the faithful pastor 
as outlined in First Timothy, At times it seems not clear 
to me whether this love is directed Godward or to the flock. 
Probably both. ITira. 1:5, 4:12, 6:11. In 2Tira. 1:?, how¬ 
ever, the author seems to come closer to Paulas conception 
of love as the overflowing in our life of the love of God 
poured out in our hears by the Spirit which he has given us 
(Rom 5:3.).: 

"Rekindle the gift of God that is within you by 
laying on of my hands; for God did not give us a Spirit of 
timidity but a spirit of power and love and of self-control.” 
2Tim. l:'.7o

through a man to build up the fellowship is seen in Paul him¬ 
self; in the work he accomplished; in his relationships 
with his fellow-workers in Christ and with the congrega- 
tidins he served. 

Always with deep affection, as ”beloved,^* 

”beloved”in the Lord, ”my beloved,”my beloved children,” 
he addresses to them his words of encouragement or rebuke, and 
his exhortations to greater effort ”in the Lord.” lCro.4:14, 
Rom. 12:19, ICor. 10:14, 15-5^. 2Cor. 7:1, 12:19; Phil 2:12, 
4:1; IGor. 4:21. 

He himself is grieved when he must write harshly 
to his brothers: 

”Iwrote to you out of much affliction and anguish 
of heard and with many tears, not to cause you pain, but to 
let you know the abundant love that I have for you.”2Cor.2:4. 

There is real affection in Paul’s words about his 
fellow-workers,: and in the way he addresses them personally: 
ICor. 4:17; Philemon 1; and the same brotherly affection 
is echoed in Ephesians, Colossians and the Pastorals. 

Eph. 6:21, Col. 4:7; 4:14; 2Tim. 1:2. 

Paul testifies to his people concerning the love 
they bore for him. ]^Th. 3:6, 2Cor. 8:7, and he appeals to 
the Christians at Rome for their prayers ”in the love of 
the Spirit.” Rom. 15:30-32. 

And Paul protests his own love for his churches; 
2Cor. 11:11, 13:15, Phil 1:8 -- ”God is my witness, how 
I yearn for you with all the affection of Christ Jesus.” 

And he sends his own love with his benediction; ”My love

be with you all in Christ Jesus." ICor. 16:24. And, he 
maintains, his love for them, or rather the love of 
Christ controlling him, has been the motive power and the 
guide of all his work among them: ITh. 2:5-B, 2Cor. 5*14-15* 
And they themselves knov/ what was the nature of his work 
among them: 

"As servants of Good we commend ourselves in 
every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, 
hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, tumults, 
labors, watching, hunger; by purity, knowledge, forbearanee 
kindness, the Holy Spirit, Genuine love, truthfull speech, 
and the pov/er of God; with the weapons of righteousness for 

the right hand and for the left . as sorrowful, yet 

always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having 
nothing, yet possessing everything." 8Cor. 6:4-7,10. 

C. Love of Man for God. 

According to Paul, the love of man for God is his 
response to the love of God first poured out for him. Even 
our love for him comes first from him: "May the Lord direct 
your hearts to the love God and to the steadfastness of 
Christ." 2Th. 3:5. (cf.lJohn 4:9 — we love, because he first 
loved us.")

” ^Knowledge^ puffs up, but love builds up. If any one 
imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know 
as he ought to know. But one loves God , one is known 
by him V ICor S:2-3* (italics mine). 

James Moffat has an interesting comment on this 
passage; "The sudden turn of expression, as sudden and sig¬ 
nificant as in Gal. 4*9, rules out any notion that one owes 
religious insight to native cleverness or acuteness instead 
of to divine revelation (as in 2:9-10); It also emphasizes 
the character of God as determining the real knov/ledge of 
faith. All intuitions of God go back to this personal 
devotion which he invokes, it is implied , this the source 
and the criterion of any advanced enlightenment. To be 
^knownI is practically the same as to ^ ' loved ^ ( as in 
the Johanmine interpretation of the faith'll Hence to know 
God is to have the spirit of love. " i 

The love we feel towards God is charged with 
gratitude for his present blessings to us. 

And it is made joyful by the ever-present hope 
of a future glory which finds its certainty in that"God^s 
love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy 
Spirit which has been given to us. " Rom 5*5* cf. ICor. 2:9-10 
Eph. 6:23; 2Tim. 4:^. And, the Christian is not unmindful 
of the unhappy state of the man who resists God^s love and 
hardens his heart to His grace, for he is under judgment 
for his folly; ICor. 16:22; 2Th. 2:10; 2Tim. 4:10 (cf Mt. 

6:2, 3,16) 2Tim. 4:10. 

And Paul maintains, as our hearts respond more 
and more to God^s love with love to him, we are prepared 
to understand and to do his will for us, manifesting as 
a result the fruits of his righteousness in our lives.

Phil. 1:9-11. 

The Love of Christ which Surpasses Knowledge. 

’’I am the Lord thy God, which have brought these 
out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou 
Shalt have no other gods before me.” (Ex. 20:-3. cf. also Dt. 
26:3-10, Jdg. 6:g-10, 10/1^-19/. 

As the covenant of God with Israel was established 
by the great act of redeption of the God who brought his 
people out of slavery in Egypt, so the new life in the 
Spirit, the new hope of glory, the jojf in believing, the 
fellowship of those who believed, were founded upon the 
great redeeming love of Him who raised Christ from the dead, 
of bondage to superstition and sin, and the final defeat of 
all hope in the grace, c. IJohn 4*13-19,, esp. lB-19: 

There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. 

For fear has to do with punishment, and he who fears is 
not perfected in love. ^^Afe Icbve, because he first loved us." 

God has ever yearned over the souls of men, that 
as they have been created by him to love and serve him and 
to find fellowship with him, so they might gladly acknowledge 
him as Father, and serve him, not as unwilling and rebel¬ 
lious slaves, but as sons, and as heirs of his glory. And 
now finally in Christ he has shown to men what is the measure 
of his measureless love. Rom. And wonder beyond com¬ 

prehension, we are allowed to share in that "love of 
Christ which passes knowledge" (Eph. 3*19, and in that

cration, and redemption.” ICor. 1:30 . 

Not based on our Merit 

So, ”Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord,” 
for none of this is our doing, but all is of God. As 
for Israel, so with us: nothing that we have done has 
merited his great kindness: Rom. 3*23, 5-6, His rea¬ 

sons are hidden behind his unfathomable mercy and love and 
his eternal purposes, which are beyond the comprehension 
of man^s limited minds: 

”Tho art an holy people unto the Lord God: 

The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special peo¬ 
ple unto himself, above all people that are upon the face 
of the eatfah. 

The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose 
you, because ye were more in number than any people for you 
were the fewest of all people: 

But because the Lord loved you, and because he 
would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, 
hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and 
redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of 
Pharoah King of Egypt.” (Dt. 7:6-5). 

¥e can never know why he has so chosen and 
called us. It is enough that we know ourselves to be sur¬ 
rounded by his love, and to be presented at every turn with 
the evidence of his overflowing grace and mercy in which he 
has called us to his service (rom. 1:7)* ITh. 1:4, Eph.1:3-6. 
Eph. 2:4“^, Col. 1:12-14,3:12; ITim. 1:13-14.

Israel’s Rejection does not Finally Thwart God’s Loving Purposes 

Paul is much exercised in mind and heart over 
the failure of his own beloved people, the Jews, to be won 
over by the love of Christ. Indeed, he would wish himself 
accursed for thffiir sakes (Rom. (:l-2.) He can only conclude 
that while God 1§ good and loving, his ways are inscrutable, 
his power absolute, and that it is not for mortal man to 
question the wisdom of his maker. ’’Can the clay say to the 
potter, why hast thou made me thus?” Rom. 9^20. Rom. 9^1^* 

Yet, great blessing has come through Israel’s rejection, for 
thus the gospel has been freed to carry God’s mercy and love 
and grace and the new life of the Spirit to all nations. 

So Paul quotes a passage in Hosea which originally 
promised the restoration of apostate Israel to repentance 
and love ( Hosea 2:23, 1:10), and applies it instead to the 
Gentiles: 

” ’ Those who were not my people - I will call 
’my People,’ 

And her who was not beloved 
I will call ’my beloved} 

And in the very place where it was said to them, 
’’you are not my people” 

They will be called ’’sons of the Living God.”’ ” 

Rom. 9^25-26, 

Yet Paul does not finally despair for his own 
people Israel, ^or what at last all the Gentiles have 
come in, then also all Israel will be saved. (Rom. 11:25-26.) 

For ”As regards the gospel they are enemies of God, for your

sake; but as regards his election they are beloved for 
the sake of their forefathers. For the gifts and call 
of God are irrevocable.” Rom. 11:2^-29. 

So concludes Paul, for them it shall be as now 
it is with you, the incomprehensible mercy of God descen¬ 
ding upon the undeserving: ”?or God has consigned all men 
to disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.”. 

Rom. ll:32j 

God^s Love Floods Our HeatB (Rom. 5*5, Moffatfe Translation) 
This unfathomed love of God is not merely some¬ 
thing that was shown in one great loving act. The same 
love in which Christ gave himself up for us is continually 
being poured out upon those who live in him by the Spirit 
We even ”rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering 
produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and 
character produces hope, and hope does not disappoint us, 
because God^s love has been poured out in our hearts through 
the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.” Rom . 5*3-‘5» 
Note that in v.5 the Greek word ek-kekutai 
is the perfect passive of ek-keo ( 
rather than the aorist. This is not a finished act, but 
one still going on. Moffat translates this verse — ”God^s 
love floods our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has 
been given to us.” 

C. H. Dodd, in his commentary on Romans, has an 
interesting note on this passage.:

^*The meaning of this very fundamental statement 
is not simply that we become aware that God loves us, 
but that in the same experience in which we receive a deep 
and undeniable assurance of his love for us, that love be¬ 
comes the central motive of our own moral being (cf, IJohn 
4:19 -- we love because he loved us first.) Since the 
nature of God Himself is love, in giving us love He imparts 
to us something of His own nature, or in Pauline language, 

His Spirit. Thus love is (here, as in ICor.12:31-13:1) 
the primary^s»spiritual gift.^ It is at this point that the 
originally legal and forensic concept of justification 
decisively enters the sjf5^re of moral experience. That 
which justifies is the love bf God for the undeserving — , 
and in justifying us that love becomes the moral principle 
by which we live.” op. Git. p. 74* 

Not only is this love the motic^ for the Christian 
life, it is the sustaining power that undergirds Christas 
soldiers in every battle. $lTh. 5*^)> so that there is 
nothing which can defeat us. For there is nothing in all 
creation that caa separate us from the love of Christ, or 
the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. ( Rom. S:33-39-) 

Finally, says Paul, it is only through this love 
that we stand firm as we look forward and patiently await 
the glorious fulfilment of the righteousness of God: 

"For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait for 
the hope of righteousness. For in Christ Jesus neither cir¬ 
cumcision nor uncircuracision is of any avail, but faith 
working through love.” Gal. 

”It is the power of the same indwelling love of 
Christ which the writer of Ephesians bespeaks for the Church 
in his great prayer: 

"That .. he may grant you to be strengthened with 
might through his Spirit in the inner man, and that Christ 
may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being 
rooted and grounded in love, may have power to comprehend with

and depth, and to know the love of Christ which surpaasses 
knowledge^, that you may be filled with all the fulness of 

God.'» Eph. 3 : 16-19 

And so the classie Christian benediction in which 
is summed up all the riches of blessing in Christ is found 
in the mouth of Paul: 

”The grace of the Lod Jesus Christ, and the 
love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with 
you all. ” 2 Cor. 13 : 14 *

Conclusion. 

Once , in conversation with a friend regarding 
religion, he asked me, ”V/hat do you think is the one thing 
about Christianity that distinguis:^d it from all other 
religions?” For a moment I was nonplussed, but the word 
which came to m3^ mind as coming closest to expressing the 
core of the gospel was -- ” the power of Love,” and after 
meditating for several years on that question, through the 
experience of the pastorate and the searching of the scrip¬ 
tures and my ovvti wrestling with the spirit, I can find no 
better way of answering that question. For here alone is 
a ”new thing under the Sun.” — something that all men des¬ 
perately need, and yet something so simple that we scorn 
its simplicity. We are too proud to take that gift which 
puts us in the humiliating position of simply confessing 
our ov/n unworthiness, and acknowledging that we are unable 
for an3^thing unless God be with us. (^’Had it not been that 

the Lord v/as on our side, now may Israel say Had it not 

been that the Lord v/as on our side, then had we utterly 
perished”.) It is a humiliating thing to realize our own 
weakness, to look fully tit ourselves, and compare what we 
would like to think ourself, our ”ideal self”, v/ith what 
we reall3^ become; and most of us, except in times of dire 
extremity, are afraid to look at ourselves, as superstitious 
people, we are afraid to look at the graves as they pass the

cemetry for fear of the spirits which lurk there. It takes 
a great deal to make the prodigal come to himself, and not 
until he is eating swine^s husks does he return without a 
shred of his pride to his father’s house. Perhaps it is for 
this reason that ’’harlots and publican^,” the outcast, the 
slave, the pauper, the drunkard, arei/on so mightily and 
transformed by the love of Christ. They know they need 
something desperately, and when they find something that 
answers that need, then they rush into the Kingdom with a 
violent change in their whole life (perhaps this is what 
Jesus means when he says concerning the Kingdom that ’’men 
of violence tteke it by storm.”) The song of the Psalmist 
is theirs: 

’’They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way 
they found no city to dwell in. 

Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them. 

Then cried they to the Lord in their trouble, 
and he delivered them out of their distresses. 

And he led them forthe by the right way, that 
they might go to a city of habitation. 

0 that men would praise the Lord for his good¬ 
ness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men.” 

Ps. 107:4-^. 

But ”it is hard for a rich man to enter into the 

\ 

Kingdom of God,” and we all have our riches which we are 
loath to surrender, like the young man who came to Jesus 
seeking the secret of eternal life, and turned av;ay regret¬ 
fully because the price was too great, (Mt. 19*16-26; cf. 

Mk. 10:17-22; Lk 1^:15-23)• Anything else — but that one 
thing he could not give up. And we all have those things

which are dearer than life itself to us, and to give them 
up, even for the Kingdom of God -- even for a pearl of 
great price, for ”an eternal weight of glory beyond com¬ 
parison, (Rom* 5:1^), seems too much for us to give. To 
become as a little child? To start over again from the 
beginning, possessing nothing, even having to kill so much 
that has become part of our nature that we might have this 
Spirit of life abundant in Christ? is not this too much? 
(Rom. S:13). Yet Jesus tells us that even if our right arm 
that which to us is indispensable, and the power with which 
we carry on the tasks of live — even this source of our 
strength we must be willing to cut off and cast from us 
if it keeps from God and trust in his strength. It is hard 
for all of us, and iioubly hard for any who have more than 
the average to lose thereby. And would it not be so with us 
in their place? So it is that ”not many powerful, not many 
were of noble birth.(ICor. 1:26). 

It is hard for a man who conscientiously endea¬ 
vours always to live by integrity, nnd who knows that he 
and his kind are the backbone of the nation and indeed of 
any society that has any stability or worth, to make the 
confession that in the eyes of God his goodness is nothing, 
nay, that ’^all our righteousness is filthy rags.” How can 
the scholar acknowledge that he is ignorant of that which

really matters in life; that all the hours of study; all 
the patient discipline of the mind, ail the riches of 
learning are really worthless if there is not the love 
of God in his life to show him those things which are true 
widdom? How can the shrewd business man who prides himself 
on his sagacity in all his dealings confess that he is a 
fool? Hov/ can the rich farmer who has labored hard and 
long, planned and dreamed and saved and sweated to build 
a goodly estate out of what was gnarled roots and dila¬ 
pidate sheds and broken-down machinery look upon his fruit¬ 
ful fields, his prize stock; his sturdy, well-kept build¬ 
ings, and his well-stocked garners and heed the word 
whispered in his ear; ^*Thou fool, this night thy soul 
shall be required of thee; then whose shall these things 
be?^' How can he count himself poor? Vvliat is riches if 
it is not what he sees before his eyes? The man of power 
can see how immediate and far-reaching his word can be, 
changing the whole future of industry, or destroying the 
reputation of a man through what he v;rites, or marching 
whole armies into battle, with the fate of millions at 
stake. It is hard for him to see his pitiful weakness, 
i^hough he might have some inward quakings as he hears of- 
the passing of the great ones, and hoards of their latter 
end: Of men like a Hitler, a Henry Ford, an Alexander 
the Great -— "they are perished as th;rough they never 
had been, and the place thereof shall knov; them no more."

It is a lesson that even Omar Khayyam can teach us: 

”They say the lion and lizard keep the courts where 
Jamshyd gloried and drank deep/’ Perhaps all of us 
have pondered upon the pyramids, and all the immense mo¬ 
numents in stone and iron of every great empire of conquest, 
and wondered, like the traveller in an antique land of the 
poet, -- before him the fragment of a great statue in the 
desert; the features of a face cruel and hard; and the 
inscription: 

”My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings I Look on 
my works, ye mighty, and despair I” . all else is sand/’ 

So ’’the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and 
the weakness of God is stronger than men.” (IGor. 1:25) and 
”God chose what is weak in the world to sh^?^ the strong, 

God chose what is low and despised in the world, eben things 
that are not, to bring to nothing things that are, so that 
no human being might boast in the presence of God.” (ICor. 
l:2B-29i And yet, there is hope for all. If after Jesus 
says, ”it is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom 
of God” his disciples naturirily ask ”li\nio then can be saved.” 
the answer is simply ’’with men it is impossible, but with 
God all things are possible.” Mt. 19^26. 

God could call even a Pharisee like Paul and show 
him what is true righteousness; God could call even a rich 
young dandy like St. Francis of Assisi and show him v/hat 
is true jo^ and what is true wealth. God could even take

an Oxford don like John Wesley, with his great, cold, dis¬ 
ciplined methodical mind, and warm his heart so strangely 
that he founded a "Methodist^^ movement noted for its ecs¬ 
tatic spirit of joy in the salvation of God. Yea, and 
even among the great and rnigfit of the earth we have had a 
king, our late sovereigh George VI of beloved memory, who 
heeded and lived in faith by the words of Jesus: "You know 
that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their 
great men exercise authority over them. Not so shall it 
be among you; but whoever would be great among you must be 
your servant, and whoever would be first among you must 
be your slave; even as the Son of man came not to be served 
but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." 

Mt. 20:25-2g. 

This theme of boundless gift of God^s love in 
Christ freely bestowed with power upon men is the whole 
of the gospel which ever way we turn: it shines out in the 
life of Jesus as piyrtrayed in the Synoptic gospels (Mark, 
Matthew and Luke); it is exalted by St. John (for I if I 
be lifted up, will draw all men to myself -- John 12:32) 
and it is proclaimed by Paul and by every other writer of 
the New Testament, right through to the last chapter of 
RevelationP "The Spirit and the Bride say, ^Come^. And 
let him who hears say ^Come.^ and let him who is thirsty 
came, let him who desires to take the water of life without 
price." Rev. 22:17.

John wrote, and when he had written said: "These 
things are written that you may believe that Jesus is the 
Christ, the Son of the living God, and that believing you 
may have life in his name," John 20:31* 

But any writer in the new Testament could say 
Amen I to his word; for they were all heralds of the great 
King, and each by the light that God had given him as he 
shone in the face of Christ upon his life proclaimed the glad 
tidings, I have studied and written of Paulas religion. But 
Paul does not proclaim any different gospel or any diffrent 
spirit than that which is proclaimed throughout the New Tes¬ 
tament and which lived in pov/er in the early Church. "What 
is Paul, and what is Apollos, and what is Cephas," save 
simply, "servants through whom you have belie^ied?" 

Paul received his Gospel from the Lord, as did Mark, 
John, Peter, and all the rest of the "glorious company of 
the apostles." The same spirit of Love that dwelt in Jesus 
( and by which he performed miracles (dynaraeis, 
powers) of healing of body and mind and spirit) performed 
the great miracle, the great work of power in the soul of 
Paul, which revealed to him his blindness, and gave him 
back his sight, sending him forth to shout the good news: 

"God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself; not 
counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to 
us the message of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors 
for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseeach

you on behqlf of Christ,be reconciled to God. For our sake 
he made him to be sin (i. e. made him a curse, for ^cursed 
is he who hangeth upon a tree^, dying the death of a cri¬ 
minal) who knew no sin, that we might become the righteous¬ 
ness of God.” (2Cor. 5^9-21) 

' V/hat overflowing joy and peac^e, hope love shines 
forth from every page of St. Paul; moving and breathing 
its message into our lives by the Spirit (for the Spirit 
takes the things of Christ and shows them unto us), and 
putting a new song on our lips: 

”I will sing a new song unto the Lord, even 
Praise unto our God.” 

And is not this a dynamic religion, a religion of 
power? All is of God and of God^s power, who has done for 
mand and is ever ready to do for him what man himself could 
never do in his own power. ”Thanks be to God who gives us 
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.” And as in Rom. 
16:23-27) so all ends in praise: ”Now to him who is able to 
strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of 
Jesus Christ,-- to the only wise God be glory for ever¬ 

more through Jesus Christ I 

”Amen”
