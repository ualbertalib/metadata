AN ABSTRACT OF A THESIS 


on 

LEISURE-TIME INTERESTS AND ACTIVITIES 
OF FIRST-YEAR WOMEN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA 

The primary purpose of this survey was to determine the leisure¬ 
time interests and activities of the first-year women registered in a 
Baccalaureate degree course at the University of Alberta* The intent 
was to determine what effect factors such as home location, type of 
high school attended, socio-economic status, parents* education, ances¬ 
tral background, and religious affiliation might have had on their 
leisure-time interests and pursuits. In addition, the study was 
planned so that evidence of need for instruction would be revealed* 

The information was collected by means of a questionnaire and 
was then tabulated for analysis* Ninety per cent of the first-year 
women were included in the survey. 

The results of the analysis showed that the students participated 
in a variety of activities, but that there was need for additional 
instruction in most cases and initial instruction in others. It was 
also found that there was need for greater equality of opportunity for 
students from rural districts, those who had attended rural high schools, 
those in low socio-economic brackets, and for those from homes where the 
parents have no education beyond high school.

CHAPTER I 


FORMULATION AND DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEM 

The purpose of this survey was to determine the leisure¬ 
time interests and pursuits of women who have completed their 
senior matriculation and were engaged in furthering their educa¬ 
tion at the University of Alberta* In addition, the survey was 
planned to determine what effect factors such as geographic location 
of the home, type of high school attended, socio-economic status, 
parents* education, ancestral background, and religious affiliation 
might have had upon the students’ interest and participation in 
leisure-time activities. 

Training for wise use of leisure-time as an objective in an 
educational system is usually reflected in the curriculum which is 
offered* The adequacy of Alberta’s secondary school curriculum, as 
far as its contribution to wise use of leisure-time is concerned, can 
best be measured by its effects on the students involved. Knowledge 
of the students' interests and pursuits should give a good indication 
of the relationships which exist between formal instruction and leisure¬ 
time activities. 

I. EVIDENCE OF A LEISURE-TIME PROBLEM 
To understand the role that education plays in the training 
for wise use of leisure-time, an examination of the problem as evi¬ 
denced by the facts of leisure must be made.

Three social changes which have affected leisure-time to 
a considerable degree are: (l) the increase in leisure-time for 
all people, (2) the monotony of work which gives little oppor¬ 
tunity for originality or creativity, and (3) the change from 
rural to urban life. 

Although increases in the amount of leisure-time have been 
gradual, records'*' show that the hours in the work-week have stead¬ 
ily decreased and the policy of granting vacations with pay has 

become more general. The future promises even more leisure time. 

2 

According to August Heckscher, director of the Twentieth Century 
Fund, it is estimated that the four-day week will be established 
in 1975. 


Specialization has led to great progress and advancement, 
but it has also resulted in frustration to the individual whose 
routine work offers no opportunity for originality or creativity. 

Sidney Greenbie describes the monotony of labor very rea¬ 
listically in the following excerpt: 

Giant cranes lift and shift and pour and 
fashion, while the men look on and guide 
these eyeless forces. . . . while vast com¬ 
plicated instruments whirl at tremendous 
speed, the men stand idly by. From "all the 
world’s a stage", we have made "all the world 
an audience". We not only look on, we "listen 
in" and we "stand by". Becoming a permanent 
and chronic onlooker leads to frustration.

The change from rural to urban life has minimized the 
individual’s control over his own spare time. Spontaneous and 
informal neighborhood life, which formerly provided a chief 
use of leisure, has largely disappeared. Modern society has 
become mobile and as a result, more leisure-time is spent away 
from the home at activities sponsored by commercial organizations. 

The fact that leisure presents a problem is further empha¬ 
sized by Bruce Hutchison in a recent article in which he stated: 

As currently defined and used, leisure is 
one of the most destructive political, econ¬ 
omic and social ideas that ever entered our 
collective lives. It is even more destructive 
as a private, personal idea, since only a small 
minority are strong minded enough to bear lei¬ 
sure successfully. And these facts, public and 
private, are especially pertinent to Canada. 

Devereux C. Josephs, in an article written in 1958, refers 
to the problem and informs the readers that many people have resorted 
to taking a second job, in preference to enjoying their leisure. 
Urbanization and mechanization, he claims, promote the danger of 
losing individuality and for this reason, ”. . . an increasingly 
important task will be to retain, in as full measure as possible, 
freedom of self-expression and encouragement of originality in thought 
and attitude.” 

The leisure problem is not new,^ but with the advent of even 
more leisure, educators, recreation leaders, social workers,

sociologists, psychologists and all others who realize the 
necessity for a solution, are devoting much time and attention 
to this field. The American Psychiatric Association has set up 
a standing committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Alexander 
Reid Martin, to study the relationship of leisure to mental 
health. The Center for the Study of Leisure, directed by socio¬ 
logist David Riesman, is surveying the subject, and the Twentieth 
Century Fund has plans for a major study of the problems of 
leisure. In 1946, when the Canadian Youth Commission conducted 
a nation-wide survey of leisure activities of young people from 
fifteen to twenty-four, the writers stated: 

One reason for the inadequacies In the 
present situation, clearly, is the fact 
that the importance of recreation both for 
the individual and for society is not yet 
generally recognized in Canada. Conse¬ 
quently, people have been left largely to 
their own devices in finding leisure-time 
satisfactions, . . P 

II. SIGNIFICANCE FOR EDUCATION 

"All thoughtful educators agree that the school must face 

0 

life and life conditions. It must face the whole of life." In 
order that education can achieve its objective of training the 
individual for life, educational programs must continually be eval¬ 
uated, and, if necessary, be revised to conform with changes in the 
social and economic pattern. A good educational system is necessary

to equip man to derive the greatest profit from his leisure- 
time, for unless wise use of leisure-time is learned, modern 
man might well fail to make the most of his new power and un¬ 
expected freedom. 

The place that the preparation for wise use of leisure¬ 
time has in an educational program has been suggested by many 
students of the problem. 

Gerald Wendt, president of UNESCO Publications Centre, 
expressed the opinion that education for worthy use of leisure¬ 
time is more important than ever and commented further, stating: 

Our students will have what no genera¬ 
tion has ever had - complete time to live. 

They need education for that great challenge 
as much as for earning a living.9 

In 1938, James E. Rogers, secretary of the National Commission 
on Enrichment of Adult Life, expressed the opinion that the test 
of a nation’s civilization is determined by what people do in 
their free time, and in addition, stated that, "Education for leisure 
will rapidly become in the near future more important than education 
for labor. . . . 

In a study made for the National Recreation Association, 

Eugene T. Lies emphasized the place of the school in the solution of 
the problems resulting from the increased amount of leisure-time, and 
insisted that:

If all school administrators and all 
teachers were clearly cognizant of the 
extent of leisure today as compared with 
that of former times, of the serious 
problems involved in the wrong use of 
free time and of the marvelous possibili¬ 
ties for human advancement consequent 
upon right use, there would be a marked 
difference in outlook upon their tasks. 

. . .they would see new meaning in thj^ 
phrase, ’’preparation for life”. . . . 

Referring to the importance of worthwhile leisure-time 
activities, Martin Neumeyer and Esther Neumeyer made this 
comment: 

The direction of civilization is de¬ 
termined to a large degree by the extent 
and the uses of leisure. If people engage 
in creative and constructive activities 
during their leisure, civilization is ad¬ 
vanced; if they indulge in useless and 
destructive activities, the social order 
deteriorates and progress is retarded. 

While work is necessary for subsistance, 
the culture of a group is built up mainly 
during spare time. The tone of any society 
is conditioned by the quality of its 
leisure. . . , 

Leisure is now being recognized as constituting both an 
asset and a problem; it is not always a blessing since its value 
depends entirely upon its use. Margaret L. Wightman referred to 
this when she made the following statement* 


Since the proper use of leisure time is 
a matter of education, the seeds can be sown 
early in a child’s life and continued through 
school life. The importance of a good found¬ 
ation, particularly In the adolescent is

acknowledged, as ’teen-agers are constantly 
exposed to the adult world with its influ¬ 
ences and its problems.13 

The writer presumes, then, that this survey will have a 
certain significance for educators at the high school level and 
at the university level. Those interested in the leisure-time 
reading trend, particularly English teachers, will gain some 
insight into what the high school graduate prefers in leisure 
reading, how a leisure-reading book is usually selected, and how 
much reading is done. Instructors in the fine arts will be given 
information regarding their contribution to youths' leisure-time 
activities. The amount of student participation in the fine 
arts will give an indication of any improvements needed in that 
area. Physical educators may be prompted to re-evaluate their 
current programs and attempt to make necessary changes to meet 
the interests of today’s high school and university students. 

The sections on Home Recreation, Individual Recreation, and Clubs 
should prove to be of particular interest to guidance counsellors 
as these sections will indicate the students* interest in activi¬ 
ties which are not included as subjects in the curriculum. In 
addition, it will be of value to the educator to know what effect 
factors such as geographic location of the home, type of high 
school attended, socio-economic status, parents* education, 
ancestral background, and religious affiliation have on the students’ 
interests and choice of leisure-time activities.

III. NEED FOR THE STUDY 

The schools must be concerned with educating the youth 
to meet the problems of life more intelligently. As Lies has 
stated, "The call upon education to take a larger hand in the 
solution of the leisure-time problem is imperative. . . and 
will become insistently louder.’'” 4 

The recreational needs and desires of young people have 
been recorded in numerous surveys, the majority of which have 
been made in the United States. Although these are of value 
in understanding the leisure-time problem in general, the surest 
guide to the local situation is a study of the leisure-time 
interests and pursuits of Alberta youth. Mo study of this kind 
has been made in Alberta, and none dealing exclusively with women 
students has been made in Canada. 

IV. SURVEY PLAN 

Education for worthy use of leisure-time is accomplished 
more successfully if student objectives are clearly understood 
and their needs and interests are met in a way that is both pleas¬ 
ant and stimulating to the students. The first step in such 
education is to determine these needs and interests as the students 

themselves see them. In this study,the needs and interests were 

15 

determined by means of a questionnaire" which was prepared by 
the investigator.

The first-year women at the University of Alberta completed 
the questionnaire, which included the following six main areas of 
leisure-time activities: 

1. Leisure-Time Reading including books, 
magazines, and newspapers, 

2. Recreational Sports designated as physical 
activity, including team sports, individual 
sports, outing activities, aquatics, and 
the dance. 

3. Fine Arts including music, art, and drama. 

4. Home Recreation including entertaining, 
visiting, playing quiet games, listening to 
the radio, and viewing television. 

5. Individual Recreation as a broad heading, 
including attendance at movies, dating, 
travel, and various handicrafts and hobbies. 

6. Clubs and Societies including active membership 
and leadership in organized groups. 

The results of the questionnaire were tabulated and analyzed 
to determine the leisure-time interests and needs of the subjects 


studied.

CHAPTER II 


REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE 

To aid the reader in understanding the analysis of the 
data of this investigation, this chapter includes some of the 
literature on the subject of leisure. Emphasis is placed on 
leisure-time reading, recreational sports, fine arts, home 
recreation, individual recreation, and clubs and societies. 

Much has been written on the topic of leisure in regard 
to its increase and the problems which it presents to society. 
However, only a brief summary of the studies closely related to 
this investigation are given here. Few studies have been made 
of university women. However, high school studies and adult studies 
which are similar to this study are included, 

I. LEISURE READING 

Numerous studies, have been made in the area of leisure 
reading. Canadian and American investigations have been made to 
determine what type of reading material is preferred and how much 
reading is being done. 

Canadian Studies 

A survey conducted in 1946 by the Canadian Youth Commission - 
ranked reading third in leisure-time activities pursued by youth in 
the fifteen to twenty-four year age group. Conversing and listening

to the radio ranked first and second respectively. In reply to 
the question, "Approximately how many books do you read a year? 1 ' 
it was found that twenty-four per cent of all youth read less than 
five books per year<> Additional information is contained in the 
following excerpt j 

The greatest readers are city youth, those 
of high income, those in their "teens," {sic "teens"^] 
and those still at school . o . • 24 % of all 
youth read less than 5 books per year, and only ^ 

11% read 50 books per year, or say a book a week* 

The Canadian survey also found that in the choice of magazines, 
digests and magazines of the home and women's variety were leaders 
in reading popularity. 

3 

Wightman reported reading as the fourth most popular leisure¬ 
time activity amongst 'teen-agers during the winter months. Girls in 
the seventeen and eighteen year age group, in this Vancouver study, 
ranked reading and going to the movies as the activities that they 
pursued most often. 

Edward C. Emery's study in 1955, involved fifty-five girls 

who were taking their first form studies at the George Harvey Voca- 

4 

tional School in Toronto, Ontario. A time sheet was kept by each 
student for one week in order to determine the amount of time spent 
on various activities. It was found that educational activities

occupied 19.22 per cent of the total spare time of the girls. Out 
of this grouping, homework took 15.85 per cent of the time and 1.85 
per cent of the time was spent on reading a book. When these high 
school students were asked to list the five leisure-time activities 
most enjoyed, reading did not appear in the list of the top ten. 

The Dominion of Canada’s Bureau of Statistics conducted 
a family expenditure survey in 1955. Seven hundred eighty-seven 
families of two to six persons, with incomes ranging between $2,000 
and $6,500, were included in the study. An indication of the amount 
of money spent on reading is contained in Table I.

than one-fifth of the city’s population, indicates that the 3.9

dollar expenditure per family per year was made mainly on the 
purchase of a book or books. 

United States Studies 

g 

A study made by Mabel Lee in 1934, showed that the enter¬ 
ing first-year women at the University of Nebraska ranked reading 
first in their list of leisure-time preferences. Whereas, Lee's 
study showed that 34.9 per cent of the subjects preferred reading, 
Inge Wiedamann and Eugene Howe's^ study, conducted at Wellesley 
College in 1937,showed that reading ranked in second place with 
18.7 per cent of the students indicating it as their preference. 

Ruth M. Toogood's^ survey of college women in 1938, re¬ 
vealed the reading of newspapers and novels in the rank order of 
fourth and eighth respectively.

to reading as well as to out-of-home recreational pursuits,,

that adults in the city read more than adults in the towns or

In case studies made by Gray and Munroe in Hyde Park, 
Chicago, and in Evanston, Illinois, it was found that fiction 
was preferred to non-fiction by the 270 adults studied. It was 
also noted that selection of books was usually made by a 
friend’s recommendation. 

In 1956, Lester Asheim stated that, ". . . not much more 
than one-fourth of the adult population reads as little as one 
book a month.*' And in the magazine and newspaper field, . . 

between sixty and seventy per cent of the adult population read 
one or more magazines regularly; and between eighty-five and ninety 

per cent read a newspaper more or less regularly. 

15 

Paul Fendrick's study, which dealt with newspaper reading 
interests of high school and college students, showed that college 
girls' interests in newspaper reading was primarily in photographs, 
cartoons, the entertainment pages, and the social pages. 

II. RECREATIONAL SPORTS 

Studies conducted to determine the interest and participa¬ 
tion in recreational sports as a leisure-time activity are included 
in this section.

Canadian Studies 

In 1946, the Canadian Youth Commission^ surveyed 2,500 
Canadian youths in the fifteen to twenty-four year age group. 

Some of the observations made were as follows* 

1. Playing cards, skating, swimming, and 
bowling were the games or sports most 
often enjoyed, 

2 0 Tennis, golf, skiing, and horseback riding 
were the activities for which a desire for 
participation was expressed, 

3. Young people talked about sports much more 
than they participated in them, 

4, A large amount of leisure-time was spent in 
passive forms of recreation, 

17 

Wightman's study revealed that 'teen-agers expressed a 
desire for physical recreation, ... Although their happiest memories 
were centered around physical recreation, they spent very little 
time in active participation. It was found, however, that the girls 
seemed to live closer to their ideal of activity than did the boys. 

In order to obtain an idea of the activities most enjoyed 
18 

by girls, Emery asked them to list the five activities they enjoyed 
most before and during the week under study. Sports ranked third 
with 15,38 per cent listing some form of sports as their first choice.

However, sports activities occupied only 2*29 per cent of their 
leisure-time during the week. 

United States Studies 

A study made at Southern Illinois University, by Helen M. 

19 

Zimmerman, dealt with first-year women students only* It was 

recommended by Zimmerman that tennis, swimming, golf, and archery 

be given more emphasis, and that co-educational classes be scheduled 

in individual and dual sports* 

At the University of Washington, Marion R* Broer and Dolly 
20 

A*J. Holland*s study indicated a preference, by the women in the 
service classes, for co-educational individual and dual sports, 
and a recommendation for smaller classes to make individual instruc¬ 
tion possible* Of the courses not offered, posture correction was 

recommended for inclusion* 

21 

Toogood*s thesis indicated that the activities in which 
women students participated most often were indoor and inactive 
forms of recreation* Hiking and picnicking were the most active 
recreational pursuits listed in the top ten* It was also noted by 
Toogood, that very few of the activities taught in Physical Education 
classes could be continued in out-of-class recreation,. In addition, 
it was noted that the activities in which instruction was requested

were well adapted to mixed groups of men and women students. 

Following a study made at Ohio State University in 1950, 
22 

James G. Mason emphasized the necessity for giving instruction 

in sports activities such as badminton, golf, and tennis,which 

would have a carry-over value into adulthood. 

Co Gilbert Wrenn and Dudley L. Harley referred to a study 

made in Dallas, Texas, by the American Youth Commission, in which 

it was found that the following groups of youth lacked regular 

physical recreation; ". . • 20 per cent of single boys and men, 

50 per cent of married boys and young men, 62 per cent of single 

23 

girls, and 76 per cent of married girls o'* This information 
serves to indicate a pattern in which girls were shown to partici¬ 
pate in recreational sports more irregularly. 

24 

Eugene S. Briggs' ' study of 500 adults in the State of 
Missouri revealed that very little participation in sports was 
evident. The results of the survey indicated a preference,by 
adults,for spectatorship rather than active participation.

III. FINE ARTS 

Canadian Studies 

25 

The Canadian Youth Commission's survey made in 1946, 
recorded the leisure-time interests and activities of English- 
speaking and French-speaking youth in Canada* It was found that 
sixty-five per cent of the English-speaking young people, and 
five per cent of the French-speaking young people had participa¬ 
ted in amateur acting* It was also noted that the highest parti¬ 
cipation in amateur acting was in rural districts and in small 
towns* In music, approximately one-third of the 1,600 girls and 
boys reported that they could play a musical instrument; One- 
fifth of the total stated that they participated in group singing. 
The kind of music most preferred was jazz, although it was evident 
that interest in jazz declined from "the teens" to the "twenties", 
and from the city to the country. It was also noted that the girls 
were more interested in symphonic music than the boys. 

Following her investigation of the leisure-time interests 

of Vancouver 'teen-agers, Wightman stated that, "music still holds 

an important place in the lives of youth, but as a passive recrea-

United States Studies 

Following an extensive study of the school programs in 

28 

6,359 public and high schools in the United States in 1933, Lies 

stated that the schools were not doing what they could in dramatics. 

Although the music programs were satisfying the needs of the students 

while they were in school, he expressed the opinion that not nearly 

enough was being done to stimulate community music activities which 

were needed to serve as an opportunity for continued interest in 

music. In the field of art, he found that the best programs were in 

the elementary grades, but that very little opportunity was offered 

for art expression in the high schools. 

29 

Lee's study referred to by Toogood, showed that music 

ranked eighth in the list of first-choice preferences with 6.6 

per cent of the subjects listing it as their first choice. Dramatics 

and art did not appear in the list of the top ten first choices. 

30 

Wiedamann and Howe’s study, also referred to by Toogood, 
revealed that interest in theatre ranked third with 14.5 per cent 
listing it as their first choice, while music was fifth with 10.6 
per cent.

IV. HOME RECREATION 

The home used to be the centre for most of the recrea¬ 
tional activities of all members of the family. "It is still 

through the home that early direction is given to the child's 

31 

choice of leisure-time pursuits." 

Canadian Studies 

32 

The Canadian Youth Commission's survey showed that over 

eighty per cent of Canadian youth had access to a radio, and 

thirty-three per cent stated that they listened to the radio 

for more than an hour each day. The radio programs most enjoyed 

by the girls, in rank order, were drama, comedy, and popular music. 

33 

Emery's study showed that the home environment was the 
place in which more than half of the out-of-school time was spent. 

The subjects, which were high school girls and boys, spent 31,78 
per cent of their time with the family group, and 27.65 per cent of 
the time was spent alone. 

Patricia Morrison's survey showed more families taking 
part in some form of recreation outside the home than within it, 
moreover, "thirty, or twenty-three per cent of the 132 families re¬ 
corded no family play of any kind."^ 4

United States Study 

35 

James A. Wylie's survey of 504 families revealed infor¬ 
mation concerning the trend in home recreation* The order, in rank, 
according to frequency of participation was; 

1* Nature and Outing Activities 
2* Spectator Activities 
3. Social Activities 
4* Participation in Sports and Games 
5* Spectator Sports 

6* Participation in Music, Mental, and Drama Activities 

7* Organizational Interests 

8* Participation in Arts and Crafts 

9. Collection of Items°^ 

37 

In Wylie's study, seventy-four per cent of the families, 
which wanted additional recreational opportunities, stated that they 
preferred active or strenuous physical activity. It was also noted 
that sixty per cent of the families felt that they had achieved strong 
er family unity as a result of participation in family recreation.

V. INDIVIDUAL RECREATION 

Canadian Studies 

38 

The Canadian Youth Commission's 0 study showed that twenty- 
seven per cent of the Canadian youth surveyed attended the movies 
once a week, and seventeen per cent attended twice a week or more* 
Musical comedies and romance were the two kinds of movies liked best 
by the girls, 

39 

Wightman's survey revealed that thirty-nine per cent of 
the girls and seventeen per cent of the boys'named some social acti¬ 
vity as their most favored leisure-time pursuit, "This," Uightman 

stated, "proves that girls have a special need for social recrea- 
40 

tion," The survey also Indicated that twenty-eight per cent of 

the boys and twenty per cent of the girls were interested and had an 

opportunity to take part in creative recreation, 

41 

Emery's study showed that social activities occupied 10,79 
per cent of the 'teen-age girls' spare time. Visiting, dancing, and 
attending parties accounted for half of the time spent on the activi¬ 
ties in this group. In ranking the activities enjoyed most by the 
girls, the following order was evolved;

In the area of individual recreation, Toogood's study,

highest percentage of participation by college women* 

4 A 

- Burton K* Farnsworth studied the relation between attendance 
at movies and the amount of reading among women. It was found that 
approximately five per cent of the 339 women surveyed, attended five 
movies each month. This group which attended most movies also read 
the most. He assumed that people who attend the movies have broad 
interests which are satisfied through reading, attending movies, and 
in other ways.

VI. CLUBS AND SOCIETIES 

Canadian Studies 

45 

The Canadian Youth Commission's survey reported that a 
surprisingly high proportion of Canadian young people, approxi¬ 
mately sixty-four.per cent belonged to some club or group® The pro¬ 
portion of club members was found to be lowest amongst rural and 

small town youth, and those in low income brackets. 

4b 

Wightman's survey showed that twenty-five per cent of the 

'teen-age girls and boys did not belong to a club® Fifty per cent 

belonged to one club, 25 per cent belonged to two clubs, 10 per cent 

to three, and one per cent belonged to four clubs. 

47 

Emery's survey revealed that twenty-five of the fifty-five 
girls did not belong to any club. Their reasons for joining a club 
indicated that 29*24 per cent joined to enlarge their circle of 
friends, and 20.75 joined a club to have fun. 

United States Study 

A 8 

The interest shown in clubs by the college women in Toogood's 
study, was reported as being very low when the number of existing clubs 
was taken into consideration. Sororities led the list of clubs in 
which a membership was held, and the clubs which the students stated 
that they would like to join were almost exclusively limited to sports' 
clubs.

This brief review of literature on leisure-time interests 
and pursuits has included results of studies in each of the six 
areas. They have been cited so that differences and similarities 
may be noted between them and the writer's present study. It is 
noted that no studies of university students in Canada have been 
made; therefore, the comparisons Will relate to first-year uni¬ 
versity-women students, United States youth, and adult groups. 

The chapters which follow report the findings of the questionnaire 
survey conducted by the writer.

CHAPTER III 


PROCEDURE AND IDENTIFYING DATA 

The magnitude of the problem involving leisure-time makes 

it imperative that, for any study, certain limitations be made. 

The Alberta students under study in this survey are those first- 

year women who enrolled in September, 1958, in various faculties 

or schools,'to obtain a Baccalaureate degree at the University of 

Alberta, Edmonton campus. 

I. PROCEDURE USED IN SECURING DATA 

A fourteen-page questionnaire was designed in January, 1959, 
for administration to the first-year women at the University of 
Alberta. The investigator 1 s contact with this institution served 
as the basis for selection. 

In an attempt to gain reliable information, and to assure the 
group that all data would be confidential, students’ names were 
omitted from the questionnaire. 

A representative sample of activities to be included in the 
survey was selected. To obtain this, the six sections referred to 
on page 9 of this report were included. Because Physical Education 
class time was used for completion of the forms, recreational sports 
was placed first in the questionnaire. 

The pilot study was conducted with a class of thirty-six 
students who were registered in the one-vear teacher-training pro¬ 
gram in the Faculty of Education. The questionnaire was completed

in less than the hour provided, so no alterations were needed in 
the length of the form. However, several changes were necessary 
for clarification and for compilation. 

The revised questionnaire^ was given to the students during 
the last two weeks of March, 1959. In each case, the questionnaire 
was administered by the investigator. This arrangement was made 
possible through the co-operation of the Faculty of the School of 
Physical Education. No attempt was made to administer the question¬ 
naire to students who were absent from class the day that the survey 
was made. Therefore, the participants in this study represent 342 
out of 380,or 90.00 per cent of the total number of first-year 
women enrolled in a degree course at the University of Alberta in 
the 1958 - 1959 winter session, Edmonton campus. 

The questionnaire was administered twice to one class of thirty 
students. This class answered the questions during the regular 
survey session and then completed the same form for the second time 
after a ten day interval. The correlation coefficients of .93 - .95 
indicated little difference between the first and second set of 
answers. 

Careful examination revealed that the vast majority of differ¬ 
ences occurred in multiple response questions, and questions where 
approximations were requested. 

Data obtained from the three hundred forty-two questionnaires 
were transferred to IBM cards. Three cards were used to tabulate the 
information on each student. The sorter was then used to extract the 
information necessary for analysis and tabulation.

II. IDENTIFYING DATA 

The data obtained from the first sixteen questions of the 
questionnaire contained information relative to the students in 
the survey group. This identifying data is tabulated to aid the 
reader in interpreting the analysis which is made in subsequent 
chapters. 

Table'III shows the distribution of the students according 
to age, home location, present living accommodation, and type of 
high school attended. The first-year women ranged in age from 
17 to 36, with the greatest percentage (56.75 per cent) being 19 
years old. The majority of the students (81.84) per cent were 
in the 18 to 20 year age group. 

H ome Location and Present Living Accommodation 

Locating the students' homes geographically showed that 
187 lived in a city, 82 in a town or a village, and 73 on a farm 
or ranch. While attending the University of Alberta in Edmonton, 

143 were living at home, 75 in the University women's residence, 

31 in private homes where they received room and board, and 73 in 
light housekeeping rooms, suites, or independently organized resi¬ 
dences. 

Type of High School Attended 

The students* high school education was undertaken in four 
different types of high schools. When more than one type of high school 
was attended, the student was categorized according to the school at 
which grade twelve was taken. One-hundred seventy-nine stated that they

high school, 21 had completed their education in a rural high 
school, and 17 had attended a private high school. 

Socio-Economic Status 

Socio-economic status was based on father’s or guardian's 

income only. However, in many cases the students were unable to 

estimate.the income. Where no estimate was made by the student, the 

investigator followed a table obtained from the Provincial Bureau 
2 

of Statistics to determine the approximate income according to the 
occupation listed. 

Socio-economic status to be more exact, would have included 
.numerous factors such as, whether or not the home is owned or rented, 
the number of members in the family who are being supported, by the 
father's income, and the contribution made to the family income by 
other members of the family. This study determined the number of 
mothers who worked, but their contribution to the family income was 
not used as a basis,for the three categories outlined in Table IV.

NOTE: Sixteen students are not included in this tabulation. 
Each of these students stated that her father was retired or de¬ 
ceased. 

It was noted that 109 students stated that their mothers 
worked. Forty mothers were teaching, 27 worked at secretarial jobs, 
15 were clerks, and the remaining 27 were nurses, cooks, guidance 
counsellors or beauty counsellors. In each income category approxi¬ 
mately one-third of the students' mothers were working. This number 
decreased markedly in the $10,000 and over income bracket.

Table V. shows a list of the various occupations in which 
the father or the guardian of the student was engaged. Twelve 
categories were devised to facilitate IBM card tabulation. 

Parents' Education 

The distribution according to parents' education.is shown 
in Table VI. In each case only one category was checked by the 
student. Over one-third (37.71 per cent) of the students came from 
homes where one or both parents have a University education, 28.36 
per cent came from homes where one or both parents have a High School 
education, and 18.12 per cent of the students’ parents do not have a 


High School education

Ancestral Background 

In tabulating the students* ancestral background, the 
father's ancestry was used as a basis. For example, when the 
father was German and the mother was Scandinavian, the students' 
ancestral background was tabulated under German. This was done to 
limit the ancestral groups for ease in tabulation. Table VII shows 
the distribution of students according to ancestral background and 
religious affiliation.

13, 14 and 16 were included in the informational data section. The 
students were asked to answer question 13 or question 14 according 
to whether or not they felt that the high school they attended had 
stressed wise use of leisure-time. Nineteen students answered both 
questions which indicated that they had changed schools and they 
felt that one school had stressed wise use of leisure-time while 
the other had not. This interpretation was based on queries made 
by some of the students while they were answering the questions.

The information from questions 13 and 14 is contained 
in Table VIII, Omitting the 19 students who answered both 
questions, it is -noted that 235 out of 323 students or 68,71 
per cent felt that the high school which they attended had 
stressed wise use of leisure-time. Over half of this group 
indicated that leisure-time opportunities were provided for 
by the school, the home, and the community. Eighty-eight 
students (25.73 per cent) indicated that the high school they 
attended did not stress wise use of leisure-time. Of the 
eighty-eight students in this category, 35 attended a city school, 

54 a town school, 14 a rural school, and 4 attended a private high 
school. However, a combination of the home, the school, and 
the community again were the main agencies for the provision of 
leisure-time activities. 

The order in rank of the agencies which had influenced the 
development of the students' leisure-time interests is contained 
in Table IX. The home and school were found to be the major 
agencies of influence. Although the church and the community 
organizations were not ineffective, in this study, it appears 
that their effectiveness is surpassed by that of the home and the 
school. 

The usual time for extracurricular activities (often referred 
to as co-curricular activities) is after school hours. In situations 
where students leave on a school bus, or leave to go to work, their 
participation in extra-curricular activities at the school is 


naturally curtailed

In an attempt to solve this problem, school administrators have 
allowed the noon hour to be a time for recreational extracurricu¬ 
lar activities. 

Mo participation in after-school extracurricular activities 
was indicated by 10.68 per cent of the students because they stated 
that they had to take the school bus home. Another 5.5 per cent 
said they left right after school to go to work. Other non-parti¬ 
cipants included 12.06 per cent who said that they could have stayed 
for after-school activities, but they did not because they were

not interested. Another 13.79 per cent stated that they did not 
stay because no activities were organized or planned. However, 
57.93 per cent, or over half of the students, did take part in 
extracurricular activities after school. The foregoing percent¬ 
ages indicate that there is a need being satisfied by the 
personnel who provide guidance, encouragement, and supervision 
in the extracurricular program. 

At the University of Alberta, a wide and varied extra¬ 
-curricular program is offered. Although the facilities are not 
elaborate, the students are given the opportunity to spend their 
leisure-time in a variety of ways. The hours of leisure that 
university students have, depend primarily on the amount of time 
that they have to devote to their course work. A study,4 con¬ 
ducted during the 1958-1959 term by Arthur W. Eriksson, Associate 
Professor in the School of Physical Education at the University of 
Alberta, showed that the students in the Education faculty record¬ 
ed, by means of weekly record sheets, an average of 14.83 hours of 
leisure per week. 

To determine the approximate number of leisure-time hours 
per week of the students in the present survey, the 342 students 
were asked to calculate the approximate number of hours spent on 


4 The writer based this calculation on the results of 
weekly record sheets kept by 109 Education women students 
during the week of January 17-24, 1959. These record sheets 
have been filed by A.W. Eriksson.

CHAPTER IV 


LEISURE READING 


Reading is a worthwhile leisure-time activity# However, 
to develop an interest in reading, and the ability to choose 
wisely when selecting leisure-reading material, the student 
must be given guidance# 

Referring to the school's task as a guide in the improve¬ 
ment of reading tastes, Pearl McCarty stated; 


If the school is reasonably successful 
in attaining this objective, the individual 
who must make his selections from the 
voluminous mass of printed materials will 
be able to discriminate among the good, 
the worthless, and the detrimental# By 
learning to make his choices wisely, he 
is assisted in perpetuating his interest 
in the worthwhile#1 

It is likely that reading will be an important leisure-time 

activity of university students, for as Homer T* Rosenberger stated, 

’’reading is a favorite leisure-time activity for many people who 

2 

are interested in things intellectual.’’ 

How much reading is done, and what these students read during 

their leisure hours will be determined by an analysis of their 

3 

answers to the questions in the leisure-reading section of the

The foregoing tabulation shows that reading and going to 
movies were each listed as first choice by 34.79 per cent of the 
students. However, when second place ranking was taken into consid¬ 
eration, reading led the list in being the most favored leisure¬ 
time activity of the five named. 

I. BOOKS 

Amount of Reading Done 

Reading was enjoyed by 327 students (9b.61 per cent), and 
204 students (b9.64 per cent) said they felt that their interest 
in reading had increased after one year at the University of Alberta. 
The 4.39 per cent who said they did not enjoy reading represented 
students from all four types of high schools. However, thirteen 
(3.97 per cent) of those who said they enjoyed reading indicated 
that they had not read the required ten leisure-reading books each

year in high school, while out of the total group of students,, 

259 (75.73 per cent) stated that they had read more than the 
required number. This interest in reading is in keeping with 
the first place ranking of reading referred to above. 

During the past nine months, July 1, 1958 to March 20, 

1959, eleven per cent of the students stated that they had read 

over twenty books; and 114 students, one-third of the total 

4 

group, had read nine or more leisure-reading books. If one 
book per month is the goal in number of leisure books read, then 
these students are reading less than average since the majority 
read fewer than ten. 

A query on the amount of required or reference reading done 
in connection with university subjects showed that 37.13 per cent 
had read one to ten books, 47.66 per cent had read eleven to 
twenty, and 15.20 per cent had read over twenty books. On further 
analysis of the information on amount of reading done, it was noted 
that 82 students (23.97 per cent) were in both categories which 
indicated that they were avid readers in leisure reading and in 
required reading. 

Methods Used in Selecting a Book 

Various methods and combinations of methods were listed by 
the students in their replies to the question of how they made their 
selection. The methods for selection of leisure-reading books ranked 
as follows;

Author's name was the usual method used when selecting 
5 

a book for leisure reading* The complete listing would seem 
to indicate that the students tend to make their choice mainly 
by author's name and book title* Perhaps students should be 
required to read books written by different authors during each 
year of high school to encourage a wider choice of reading mater¬ 
ial* 

The third-place ranking showed the important influence of 
plays, films, radio, and television in determining the choice of 
book. The film industry today has filmed many novels and although 
they tend to present a definite 'Hollywood' flavor to most books, 
this filming policy has had a bearing on the students' choice of

Reading Preference 

The interest in fiction when compared with non-fiction 

showed an approximate ratio of 3 to l.° This ratio compared closely 

with studies, made by the American Youth Commission, in which 

ratios of 3 to 2, and 5 to 3 were found. ' Young people are 

attracted by reading that helps them escape from their environment 

and lets them taste adventure vicariously. Good fiction, instead 

of weakening their ability to face reality, can aid them in 

8 

acquiring a broader acquaintance with reality.

Table X shows the categories in fiction and non-fiction 
ranked according to first choices stated by the students. Bio¬ 
graphy was ranked first in the non-fiction list, while the novel 
was the first choice for the readers who preferred fiction. To 
find out whether or not the students have developed the ability 
of discriminate selection would entail the keeping of records 
followed by an analytical evaluation of the books read. 

The investigation revealed that less than half of the 
students (47.95 per cent) held a public library card and only 
7.89 per cent belonged to a book club. However, 47.07 per cent 
of their parents belonged to a book club and the majority either 
purchased or received books during the year. 

Information regarding the number of books added to their 
libraries each year was tabulated as follows:

The information contained in Table XI shows that socio¬ 
economic status (parent's income) had a bearing on the number of 
leisure books there were in the students' homes. There were more 
category 'A' students who indicated that they had from one to 
twenty books, than those in the same category who had more than 
one hundred. The "over-one-hundred" percentages showed an approx¬ 
imate increase of ten per cent as the income categories increased. 


II. MAGAZINES 

Magazines have received their share of the readers' interest 
by offering short stories, success articles, comments on current 
affairs, and pictures. 

Wrenn and Harley, when, referring to a study of young adults 
made in St. Louis stated that.; 


The status of the recreational reading of 
youth can be summed up by the assertion that 
three-fourths of their reading matter is 
magazines and three-fourths of what they read 
in magazines serves only to kill time.^

students were more interested in books than in magazines. The in¬ 


formation is tabulated as follows:

Reader's Digest , Time or Newsweek . Saturday Evening 
Post , and Life ranked first to fourth, respectively. These 
four magazines remained in the same order in the list which 
indicated student choice if a gift subscription were offered 
to them. 

This section on magazine reading has described interest 
only, and no attempt was made to determine how much time was 
spent in reading magazines, or which sections of the magazines 
listed were usually read.

III. NEWSPAPER 

The newspaper contents were classified into sixteen 
common categories selected to include a variety of newspaper 
coverage. Table XIII reports the numbers who indicated that 
they read the various newspaper topics designated for examin¬ 
ation. Two hundred ninety students stated that they read the 
front page, 254 read the headlines, and 233 read the comics. 

These three ranked first, secondhand third respectively. These 
numbers indicate that the students have very little interest 
in newspaper reading. 

13 

The comparison with Fendrick's, study In Table XIII, 
serves to Indicate that the students in the Alberta study indi¬ 
cated more interest in headlines, editorials,and letters to the 
editor, but less interest in all other sections. The greatest 
similarity was in news, editorials ,and the financial page. 

IV. WRITING 

The majority of the students (293) listed personal letters 
as the form of writing which they enjoyed most. This interest in 


13 


Suora p. 15 














' 


;j ; 











I’.Q 






50 


letter writing, is an indication of the importance of social 
contacts, making friends?and conversing. 

Over one-third (37.71 per cent) stated that they enjoyed 
writing short stories. Approximately one-third of the students 
had written for a newspaper, a club or some organization at one 
time, and ten students were engaged in writing for some paper 
or organization when the survey was made. An interest was also 
expressed in writing plays, poetry, novels,and song lyrics. The 
chapter on Fine Arts, Chapter VI, will describe other creative 
interests and activities pursued by the students. 

A. FACTORS AFFECTING INTEREST AND AMOUNT OF READING 

Reading can be referred to as an "across-the-board 
leisure-time activity" because all people read to some extent. 

As a result, reading is interrelated with every other leisure¬ 
time activity. In order to determine what effect certain 
factors such as home location, type of high school attended, 
parents’ education, socio-economic status, ancestral background, 
and religious affiliation might have on interest shown in reading 
an analysis was made for each of the factors mentioned. 

The five reading sections, which were drawn from the 
information received on reading, were, (l) the 114 students 
who had read more than ten leisure reading books during the past 
year, (2) the 225 students who listed their first choices in the 
fiction category, (3) the 77 who preferred non-fiction, (4) the 
119 who ranked reading first when comparing it with movies, plays

radio, and TV and (5) the 194 students who indicated that they had more 
than fifty leisure-reading books in their homes. These five sections 
were chosen because they represented a cross-section of the students' 
reading interests in general and of book reading in particular. Each 
table shows the number, and the percentage that the number represents 
of the total group.

NOTE: A slight discrepancy will be noted in the percentages preferring 

fiction or non-fiction in Tables XIV to XVIX. This difference is 
due to the failure on the part of thirty students to state their 
preference. 

Home Location 


Table XIV shows that students whose homes were in the rural areas 

14 

read less than those from the towns or cities.

In all three groups there was more interest in fiction than in 
non-fiction, but it was noted that students from the towns showed 
the greatest interest in fiction, and the least interest in non¬ 
fiction. There was very little difference according to home loca¬ 
tion in the interest shown in reading. The small amount of reading 
done by rural students, in spite of their professed interest, was 
closely related to the lack of books in their home libraries. 

Type of High School Attended 

To determine what influence the type of high school attended had 
on the students' interest in reading, the analysis which appears in 
Table XV was made.

*Student groups refers to the categories outlined on pp.50-51. 
The information in Table XV shows that students who attended a 


city high school tended to have read more leisure books during the past 
year than those who had attended any of the other schools. The greatest 
difference was noted when the city group was compared with the rural 
group. Students from the various types of high schools all preferred

fiction to non-fiction. The approximate ratio Of fiction to non¬ 
fiction for city, town, and private school students was 7 to 3, 
while the students who had attended a rural high school showed a 
slightly greater difference with an 8 to 2 ratio. The interest in 
reading expressed by the rural high school students was higher than 
the actual amount of reading indicated. However, their interest 
in reading was exceeded only by the students from the private high 
schools. 

The number of homes which had leisure libraries exceeding 
fifty books seemed to have a bearing on the number of books read. 

This was true for all groups except the students who had attended 
a private high school. Although a greater percentage of students 
who had attended a private high school had access to a home library, 
they had not read as much as the students who had attended a city 
or a town high school. 

Socio-Economic Status 

An analysis of the five reading sections according to parent*S 
income is shown in Table XVI. Students whose parents were in the 
lowest income bracket indicated that they read less than either of 
the other two groups, but it did not follow that those in category 
*C* read more than those in category 'B', There actually was a slight 
decrease from category 'B* to category ‘C*. Fiction was preferred by 
all the categories with the ratio of fiction to non-fiction approx¬ 
imately 7 to 3. The students in category *A*, however, showed an 
8 to 2 ratio which indicated that they expressed a slightly greater 
interest in fiction and less interest in non-fiction than other groups 


did.

which exceeded the actual amount of reading they did, and also 
showed a greater reading interest than the students in category 'B'. 
However, the students in category *C f showed the highest interest in 
reading. Category *C* students also had greater access to home 
libraries than did either of the other two categories. Access to 
leisure books in the home seemed to affect the amount of reading done 
by students in categories 'A 1 and *B', but this was not true for 
category , C* students since they did not read more than the students 
in category *B'.

Parents 1 Education 

The analysis made according to the parents' educational 

background appears in Table XVII. The amount of reading done 

15 

tended to increase with the increase in parents' education; 
however, very little percentage increase was shown between those 
whose parents have no high school education and those whose 
parents have a combination of university education and special 
training. All groups preferred fiction to non-fiction, but those 
whose parents have an education beyond high school showed slightly 
less interest in fiction and slightly more interest in non-fiction 
than those whose parents have high school only or less. Interest 
in reading showed that this interest tended to increase with 
education. Those whose parents have no high school education had 
less access to a home library than any of the other groups. In 
this category, too, the interest in reading and the number of books 
read were directly proportionate to the availability of books in 
the home. 

Ancestral Background 

The analysis of the five areas of reading according to ances¬ 
tral background is shown in Table XVIII. Where differences are noted 
regarding groups that are very small in total number, the groups 
ranking second and third are included as well. 

The information as contained in Table XVIII, showed that the 
Dutch, the Oriental, and the British groups ranked first, second,and 
third respectively in having the greater percentage of their group 
in the category of those who had read over ten leisure books during 

the past year. The British group, as well as placing high on the 

15 Cf. ante , Table II p. 14.

TjO ' i; 


:]•<: no or; 




57 . 


list in the amount of reading, also indicated that more of 
their group came from homes where they had lei sure =-book 
libraries of fifty or more books than any other group. All 
the groups preferred fiction to non-fiction with the other 
Slavic and Dutch groups showing no interest in non-fiction. 

The German and Scandinavian groups showed the greatest interest 
in non-fiction, while the 'Other*, the French, and the Oriental 
groups registered the greatest ratio differences (approximately 
8:1 and 8:2) when choice of fiction was compared with choice of 
non-fiction. Of the students who ranked reading first, the Dutch, 
the Ukrainian, and the Scandinavian groups were first, second, 
and third respectively. 

Religious Affiliation 

To determine whether religious affiliation had any bearing 
on the interest and participation in reading, Table XIX was 
compiled. A greater percentage of the students who belonged to 
a Jewish Synagogue had read over ten leisure books than any other 
group. There was, however, very little difference between the 
vJewish group and the Evangelical group. No similar relationship 
resulted when the amount of reading was compared with the number 
who had access to a leisure library, since the Presbyterian, the 
Anglican, and the Mormon groups ranked first, second, and third 
respectively in that area. Each group was represented in having 
listed reading as a first choice. A greater percentage of the 
students in the Baptist group indicated this preference, but the 
percentage ratings for the Evangelical, the Jewish Synagogue, and 
the Mormon groups were also very high.

All the groups preferred fiction to non-fiction with 
the exception of the Baptist group which indicated as much 
interest in non-fiction as in fiction. This percentage rate 
also placed the Baptist group first in interest shown in non¬ 
fiction. The Presbyterian, the Evangelical, and the Lutheran 
groups were first, second ? and third respectively in the greatest 
interest shown in fiction. 

B. SUMMARY 

The findings from the section on leisure reading showed 
that the students in this study were interested in reading. The 
majority stated that they enjoyed reading and that their interest 
in this important leisure-time activity had increased toward 
the end of their first year at the University of Alberta. 

Fiction was preferred to non-fiction by a ratio of three 
to one. Novels ranked first in the fiction class and biography 
was first in the non-fiction class. However, the amount of 
reading done during the past year did not compare favorably with 
the interest expressed, since two-thirds of the students had read 
fewer than eleven leisure books. 

The analysis of reading according to the factors selected 
served to indicate that the students from the towns and the cities 
had read more leisure-reading books per capita than had the rural 
students during the past year. However, rural students showed 
the highest interest in reading. The amount of reading done, and 
the interest in reading tended to increase proportionately with 
increased income and with parents* education. There was a decided

interest in fiction in every analysis with the greater percentage 
of fiction readers being those from the lowest income category, from 
homes where the parents have only a high school education or less, 
and from the rural high schools. 

Students who came from homes where there was a leisure 
library exceeding fifty books tended to be the most avid readers. 
Although the amount of reading was not necessarily in proportion to 
the availability of such libraries, those groups which indicated a 
lack of home libraries did indicate a proportionately lesser amount 
of reading. The analysis according to ancestral background showed 
no general trend except that the British students and the Scandina¬ 
vian students tended to read in accordance with their access to 
home libraries. According to religious affiliation, it was found 
that the Jewish and the Evangelical groups were interested in reading 
and read the most.

CHAPTER V 


RECREATIONAL SPORTS 


One of the basic human needs is that of physical 
activity, and since participation in recreational sports is 
irrevocably a multiple-outcome experience, its role as a leisure¬ 
time activity is one of importance. 

With the advance of scientific and technical develop¬ 
ment, the amount of physical effort required for making a living 
will continue to decrease. To satisfy the need for physical 
activity, recreational sports will assume a more prominent place 
in the leisure-time of each individual. 

Wrenn and Harley stated the following when commenting 
on physical recreations 

So much of our time is spent indoors, 
and so much of our labor has been taken 
over by machines, that the physical benefit 
of games, sports, and other strenuous forms 
of recreation is often likely to lie less 
in renewing energies that work has consumed 
than in building for the first time fitness 
which there has been no other opportunity 
to develop. Pastimes that may be either 
primarily social or physical have also a 
recognized value in preserving mental^health, 
as indeed all forms of recreation do. 

Just as commercial recreation has assumed an important 
role in attempting to fill the additional leisure-hours of the 
public, professional sports have tended to develop a greater 
degree of spectatorship amongst sports enthusiasts. However, this

passive interest in physical recreation is not detrimental 
to the individual if a comparable amount of time is spent in 
active recreation. 

Physical recreation, like most forms of recreation, 
is dependent on leadership. Providing that facilities are 
available, interest can usually be increased as skills are im¬ 
proved, for the individual tends to enjoy an activity which is 
done with some degree of proficiency. 

The questions in the recreational sports section of the 
2 

questionnaire were designed to determine the students' interest 
and participation in individual sports, team sports, aquatics, 
outing activities, and the dance. The students were also asked 
to indicate what instruction they had taken, whether they were 
interested in the activity as a spectator, and if their parents 
were participants or enthusiastic supporters of the activity. 

The tabulation of their answers in its entirety appears in 
Appendix B. 

In the account of the students' participation, the dif¬ 
ferences in percentages of both high school participation and 
university participation are given. However, participation in 
high school referred to a period of at least three years, while 
participation at the University of Alberta was for only one year, 
and did not include participation in physical education classes.

I. INDIVIDUAL SPORTS 


The 205 students who indicated that they were present 
participants (occasional or regular) in some form of individual 
sport represented 59.94 per cent of the total group. This was a 
decrease of 31.05 per cent when compared with the number who 
participated during their high school years. Their parents* 
participation and their role as enthusiastic supporters showed 
an additional decrease, as only 35.38 per cent of the parents 
were active in one or both of these capacities in the field of 
individual sports.

sports during their high school years. 

At the University of Alberta, however, a greater percen¬ 
tage of the city students participated. The greatest percentage 
decrease was in the participation of the rural students. This 
indicates that the rural students apparently made proportionately 
less use of the available facilities for individual sports than did 


either of the other two groups.

A similar analysis showed that the parents who were 
interested in individual sports as participants or as enthusiastic 
supporters were a group comprised of the following according to

This tabulation indicates that parents from the rural 
area and those in the lowest income bracket ($1,000 - $5,000) showed 
less interest and participation in individual sports than did the 
other parents. 

Requests for Instruction 

In every individual sport listed, the students made 
requests for instruction at the university level and also indicated 
that they would participate if facilities were available or more 
readily available on the campus. The greatest number of requests 
for instruction were made for badminton, tennis, and golf, in that

order. Since these activities were part of the students 1 first-year

course for all students, except those in Education, this 
information was interpreted to indicate the desire for one or 
more of the following: (l) more instructional sessions, (2) con¬ 
tinued instruction, (3) inclusion of individual sports instruction 
in courses where none had been given during the students* first 
year at University. 

Participation 

The six activities in which the greatest number indi¬ 
cated participation while at the University of Alberta were 
bowling, pleasure skating, badminton, tennis, table tennis, and 
golf, in that order. These six activities also ranked high in 
their high school participation. It was also noted that the 
three in which instruction or continued instruction was requested 
were also in the list of the six activities in which there was 
the most participation at present. 

The activities in which the least participation was 
shown were, in ascending order, handball with no participation, 
archery, shuffleboard, roller skating, riflery, horseshoe, and 
track and field. 

Private Instruction 

Private instruction or coaching had been taken by 134 
students (39.18 per cent). This group was made up of 51.47 per 
cent of the students whose homes v/ere in a city, 37,80 per cent 
of those from towns, and 8.21 per cent of those from the country. 
These percentages indicate that the city students had a greater 
opportunity, or had taken advantage of the opportunity offered 
to a greater extent, than had the town or country students.

Out of the group who had some form of private instruc¬ 
tion in individual sports, 39 (29.10 per cent) had taken figure 
skating lessons and 34 (25.36 per cent) had taken golf lessons.

students have had a greater opportunity or have taken greater 
advantage of this opportunity, than the town students. An inter¬ 
esting fact is that seven students had taken both figure skating 
and golf lessons and one of these students was from a town.

Parents* Interest in Individual Sports 

The students* parents participated in, or were enthus¬ 
iastic supporters primarily of golf, pleasure skating, and 
bowling. In the analysis of parents' interest, it was found 
that one hundred and twenty-one parents were interested in indivi¬ 
dual sports. Of this group, it was noted that forty-four were 
interested in golf. Nineteen of these forty-four had given their 
children the opportunity to take golf lessons which meant that 
the remaining fifteen students had taken golf lessons although 
their parents apparently were not interested in golf. It was 
also noted that, of the sixty-nine students who were golf parti¬ 
cipants in high school or while at the University of Alberta, 

26.08 per cent of them had parents who were golf enthusiasts. 

The other students had apparently developed an interest in golf 
from school instruction or because their friends were interested 
in the sport. 

Summary 

The interest developed in high school tended to continue 
into university in most individual sports. The differences in 
percentages from high school to university cannot be attributed 
to any one factor since the time differs for each participation 
count. 

Tabulations made according to home location indicated 
that the rural student had the least amount of participation, 
and although the town students had the greatest amount of partici¬ 
pation during high school, the city students were participating

most frequently during their first year at the University of 
Alberta. The number of requests made, at the end of the term, 
for instruction in individual sports indicated that there is a 
need for improvement in the physical education programs. 

II. TEAM SPORTS 

Participation in team sports offers the individual 
the satisfaction of belonging to a group and of working co-oper¬ 
atively with others to achieve a goal. 

Participation 

The number of students who indicated some form of 
participation in team sports while at the University of Alberta, 
was one hundred and thirty-one or 38.30 per cent of the total 
group under study. This percentage showed a decrease of 21.64 
per cent when compared with present participation in individual 
sports. Comparing percentage differences in individual and team 
sports at the high school level, the Interest was again greater 
in individual sports but by a margin of only 3.86 per cent. This 
information indicates that interest in team sports gradually de¬ 
creased as the interest in individual sports increased.

The foregoing tabulation showed that a greater percentage

high school years, but, while at the University of Alberta during 
their first year, a greater percentage of the city students were 
participating. It was also noted that the greatest decrease in 
participation from high school to university occurred in the town 
students' group. 

On further analysis, it was found that over half of the 


students who were active in individual sports were also active in 
team sports. The comparison of participation in individual and 
team sports showed the following distribution;

Requests for Instruction 

Requests were made for instruction in all team sports at 
the university level, and it was indicated that participation would 
be increased if facilities were made available, or more readily

available, on the campus. The greatest number of requests for 
instruction were made for basketball, curling and volleyball. 

Since volleyball was the only team sport taught to all students 
in the University of Alberta course, the requests were interpreted 
to indicate the desire for one or more of the following: (l) con¬ 
tinued instruction, (2) more instructional sessions devoted to 
these team sports, (3) the inclusion or continuation of basket¬ 
ball in the present course, ( 4 ) the inclusion of curling in the 
present course. 

The team sports in which the greatest number of students 
were active while at the University of Alberta, were volleyball, 
basketball, and curling, in that order. These three were also high 
on the list of team sports in which there had been the most parti¬ 
cipation during high school. It was noted however, that fastball 
ranked ahead of curling during high school, but there was very 
little present participation in fastball. No students took part 
in field hockey, ice hockey, lacrosse, or soccer, although there 
had been some participation in these activities during high school. 
There were no arrangements for participation in any of these team 
sports on campus during the students* first year. However, the 
few who stated that they would participate if facilities were made 
available on campus would not warrant a change from the present 
organization. 

Private Instruction 

Private instruction or coaching had been received by 
some of the students in all team sports, but primarily in basket¬ 
ball, curling, and volleyball. Fifty-two students had private

instruction in one or more of the team sports. The information, 
tabulated according to home location, showed the following 
percentage distribution: 


City 

Town 

Rural 

Students who had private instruc¬ 
tion in team sports 7.60 

3.21 

9.58 


Private instruction in team sports was considerably 
less than in individual sports, but it was noted that the rural 
students had a greater percentage who had the opportunity, or had 
taken the opportunity offered, for special coaching in team sports. 

An analysis of the twenty-two students who had taken 
private instruction in curling showed the following percentage 
distribution according to home location: 


City 

Town 

Rural 

Students who had private instruc¬ 
tion in curling 6.41 

6.09 

6.84 


This percentage comparison indicated that home location 
did not affect the students* opportunity for special instruction 
in this sport. 

While the number of students taking part in team sports 

was less than the number who were active in individual sports, it 

is noted that there was an increase in passive student participation 

as spectators at team games. Basketball, hockey, and baseball were 

4 

the three team sports which drew the greatest number of students. 


4 

Mote: Football was omitted from the check list, and 
although some students included it under 'other*, its appearance 
in the list may have given it a different ranking as a spectator 
sport.

Parents' Interest in Team Sports 

A total of one hundred and forty-eight parents (43.27 
per.cent) were active participants or enthusiastic supporters 
of team sports. The majority were interested in curling, while 
ice hockey and baseball ranked second and third respectively. 
The analysis of these one hundred and forty-eight parents with 
home location and approximate annual incomes as the factors, is 
tabulated as follows:

The foregoing tabulation indicates that the parents from 
the towns and the country showed a greater interest in team sports 
than did the parents from the cities. It also shows that there was 
an Increase in team sport interest from category 'A' to category 'B', 
but not from category *B' to '0*. 

To determine whether parents' interest in curling had any 
correlation with students' participation in curling, an analysis 
was made of this one sport. It was found that one hundred and 
thirty-four students had participated in curling at high school and 
an additional nine students were taking part in curling at the 















75 . 


University of Alberta. Of this total group of one hundred and 
forty-three students, sixty (41.95 per cent) had parents who 
were interested in curling. This percentage indicated a closer 
relationship of 'parent and child' curling than was noted in the 
golf analysis, where 26.08 per cent of the parents were golfing 
enthusiasts. 

Summary 

The information contained in this section revealed that 
the students' participation in team sports when compared with 
their participation in individual sports was considerably less 
at university and slightly less at high school. It was also 
noted that the students showed considerable interest in team 
sports as spectators. 

Although rural students did not have the opportunities, 
or did not take advantage of the opportunities offered in indivi¬ 
dual sports, they did have a similar opportunity, or took greater 
advantage of the opportunities offered, in team sports when compared 
with students from towns and cities. 

Basketball and volleyball ranked highest in the sports 
in which there was participation at high school and at university, 
and basketball and ice hockey were the sports in which there was 
the greatest student spectator interest.

III. AQUATICS 

William Ralph La Porte placed Swimming and diving 1 
first in the list of recreational sports as the one which gives 

5 

the greatest all-round contribution to the participant. This 
first place ranking was made after an extensive evaluation of 
all sports according to their respective contributions to the 
fulfilment of the objectives of physical education. 

In this study, the aquatics section was designed to 
determine the students 1 interest and participation in all forms 
of aquatics. The reader will note that boating has been included 
in the section on outing activities. 

Participation 

The students* answers to the section on aquatics reveal¬ 
ed that one hundred and fifty-one students (44.73 per cent) had 
taken part in some form of aquatics during their high school 
years and seventy-three students (21.34 per cent) had taken part 
while at the University of Alberta in their first year. It was 
noted that nine of these seventy-three students had not taken 
part in any form of individual or team sports during their first 
year at University. 

Requests for instruction were made in all aquatic 
activities, and the number requesting instruction in pleasure 
swimming was more than the number requesting instruction in any 
other single activity in the entire section on sports.

Curriculum (Los Angeles: University of Southern California 
Press, 1951), p. 13.

As well as being the activity for which there was the greatest 
demand for instruction, pleasure swimming ranked first in the 
aquatics section as the activity in which the greatest number 
of students took part at university and during high school,. 
Diving ranked second in participation, and synchronized swimming 
was the activity in which only four students had been or were 
active. 

An analysis of the aquatics participants, in comparing 
their high school participation with their university participa¬ 
tion according to home location gave the following result:

participating during their first year at university. The rural 
students showed the least percentage drop as well as the least 
amount of participation at university and during their high school 
years. 

Private Instruction 

In pleasure swimming, which was the most popular form of 
aquatic participation, twenty-three students had instruction at 
high school and sixty-four had taken private instruction.

This percentage comparison indicated that the students from

An analysis of these sixty-four students according to socio¬ 
economic status showed that, whereas only 13.60 per cent of the 
students in the lowest income category had taken swimming lessons, 
22.55 and 23.90 per cent of the higher income categories had taken 
lessons. 


Parents 1 Interest in Aquatics 

A total of forty-one parents (11.98 per cent) were listed 
as interested participants or enthusiastic supporters of aquatics.

Of the seventy-three students who participated in aquatics 
during their first year at the University of Alberta, twenty-one had 
parents who were interested in aquatics. Out of the one hundred 

and fifty-one who had participated in aquatics during their high 

© • . 

school years, there were thirty-six who stated that their parents 
were interested, in aquatics. This would seem to indicate that 
student interest was developed, for the majority, by agencies 
other than the home. 

Summary 

7 

The foregoing information indicates that, although La Porte 
ranked swimming as the most important single activity, these 
students participated less in this sport than in individual sports 
or in team sports. It was also noted that pleasure swimming was the

sport in which the greatest number of requests for instruction 
were made. 

IV. OUTING ACTIVITIES 

Outing activities are particularly adaptable to family 
recreation and have a particular appeal for people who are 
interested in getting back to nature, or in getting away from 
the tensions of modern living by relaxing in the great outdoors. 
The love of adventure can readily be satisfied by participation 
in some form of outdoor activity. 

Participation 

Participation in some outing activity during their high 
school years was indicated by two hundred and forty-eight students 
or 72.51 per cent of the total group. While at the University 
of Alberta in their first year, 15.78 per cent of the students 
stated that they had participated in outing activities, almost 
all of which were planned and sponsored by some off-campus organi¬ 
zation or by themselves. 

The outing activities in which there were the greatest 
numbers participating during high school and university were 
picnicking, camping, and hiking. Boating, which included sailing, 
canoeing, and rowing, had the least number of participants. 

An analysis of the participants according to home location 
produced the following tabulation:

The town students* group had the greatest percentage who 
were active during their high school years, but this group also 
recorded the greatest decrease in participation when coming to 
the University of Alberta. The percentage of rural students 
participating during high school was comparable to that of the 
city students, but the decrease shown by the rural students was 
somewhat greater than that shown by the city students. This 
comparison indicated that the city students tended to maintain 
their participation to a greater extent than did either the 
students from the towns or from the country. This was the 
trend noted in team sports and individual sports as well. It 
would appear that the student who had to adjust to a new 
environment showed a greater decrease in participation. 

Requests for instruction were made for all outing ac¬ 
tivities, and the students also stated that they would be active 
participants in all the activities if arrangements were made for 
their inclusion or if facilities were available. The outing 
activities in which the greatest interest was indicated were 
sailing, canoeing, and camping. 

Parents* Interest in Outing Activities 

The parents who were interested in outing activities 
were a group of one hundred and forty-five ’which was made up of 
people from all home locations and all income brackets. This 


information was tabulated as follows:

those from the towns and cities. There was an increase in outing 
activities with the increase in income from category 'A' to 
category 'B', but there was no additional increase from category 
'B' to *C'. However, the percentage rate of participation in 
category *C* did remain at approximately the same level as that 
of category *B'. 

Many parents were active participants or enthusiastic 
supporters of fishing, camping ? and hunting. Except for camping, 
very little similarity was noted between parents* main interests 
and students* main interests. Although fishing and hunting were 
activities in which there was some student participation, these 
were not the students' main interests. 

To determine whether there was any correlation between 
the parents' greatest interest - fishing, an activity which 














had ranked fifth in student participation, it was noted that 
one hundred and nineteen students had participated in fishing 
during high school and university, and fifty-eight of their parents 
were interested in fishing. This indicated that 48.73 per cent 
of these students had parents who were interested in this sport. 

The parent and child relationship in fishing was better than 
that shown in curling, in golf, and in aquatics. 

Summary 

Student participation in outing activities during their 
first year at the University of Alberta ranked this section last 
when compared with the other recreational sports' sections. This 
was to be expected since the winter months at university are not 
too conducive to outdoor activities. Participation in outing activi¬ 
ties in high school, however, exceeded participation in aquatics, 
ranking fourth. Picnicking,.camping, and hiking were the activities 

g 

in .which there was the most participation, and according to their 
requests for instruction there was great interest in sailing, 
canoeing, and camping. Parents' interest in fishing placed this 
activity first in parent-child activities, and second to curling as 
the activity in which there were the most interested parents. 


V. DANCE 

The dance has great appeal for every age group. It 
helps satisfy the individual's need for belonging and the desire 
for participating within a group. It can also serve as an ex¬ 
pression of joy in movement and response to rhythm. Ballet and 
modern dance serve as an individual and creative experience,

while social and square dance offer a group experience.

The questions in the dance section of this study were 
designed to determine the students* interest and participation in 
this recreational activity. 

Participation 

The students' answers showed that two hundred and sixty- 
five, or 77.48 per cent of the total group, had participated in 
some form of dance during their high school years, and one hundred 
and ninety-one, or 55.84 per cent, had taken part in dance while 
at the University of Alberta. The reader is reminded that high 
school participation covered a period of at least three years 
and included physical education classes, while participation at 
the university was for one year and did not include dance taken in 
physical education classes. 

An analysis of these groups according to home location 

showed the following tabulation:

of Alberta for their first year. Students from the city showed the least 
percentage decrease in participation from high school to university 
although they had ranked third in their participation while

at high school. The rural students had participated slightly 
more than the city students while in high school, but they took 
a proportionately smaller part in dance while at university than 
did either of the other two groups. 

Dance participation during high school had been mainly 
in social dance, square dance, and folk or round dance. The 
interest in these was also high during their first year at the 
University of Alberta. 

Requests for Instruction 

Requests were made for instruction at the university in 
all forms of dance with the greatest number being for social dance. 
The requests for modern or interpretive dance and for square dance 
ranked second and third respectively. It was of interest to note 
that more students had received instruction in square dance than 
in social dance during high school, and that at the university 
there were twice as many requests for social dance instruction as 
there were for square dance instruction. The number of requests 
for social dance instruction placed it eighth when ranked with 
requests in all the recreational sports. 

Parents* Interest in Dance 

A total of eighty parents were active participants or 
enthusiastic supporters of dance. Their interests corresponded 
with those of the students, as their first interest was in social 
dance and their second interest was in square dance.

Private Instruction 

Private instruction in social dance and in ballet had 
been taken by forty-three and forty-one students respectively. 
Fourteen of these had taken lessons in both social and ballet. 

An analysis of the students who had taken ballet lessons 
according to home location and socio-economic status showed the 


following:

The foregoing tabulation indicates that opportunity in¬ 
creased with increased parents' income. The students in category 
•C* represented 28.25 per cent of the total in that category, 
which was twice that of the percentage in category 'B'. It 
was also noted that none of the rural students had taken lessons 
in ballet. 

Summary 

The students' answers to the questions in the dance 
section indicated that dance played a very important role as one 
of theTr leisure-time activities. Comparing present participation 
in the dance section with present participation in all other 
physical activity sections, dance ranked second to individual 
sports. Additional information on the students* interests in 
attending dances and joining dance clubs can be found in Table XII 


of this study.

A. FACTORS AFFECTING PRESENT PARTICIPATION IN RECREATIONAL SPORTS 

In an attempt to determine what effect various factors 
such as home location, type of high school attended, socio¬ 
economic status based on parent’s income, parents* education, 
ancestral background, and religious affiliation might have 
had on participation in recreational sports, several analyses 
were made. The groups of students studied according to each 
of the factors named included the following: (l) the 205 
students who had been active in individual sports, (2) the 131 
students who had been active in team sports, (3) the 73 who had partici¬ 
pated in aquatics, (4) the 54 who had engaged in some form of outing 
activity, (5) the 191 who had taken part in dance, (6) the 64 who 
had taken no part in any recreational sports while at the University 
of Alberta. 

Home Location 

The analysis of these six groups according to the geographic 
location of their homes is shown in Table XX. The percentage 
given indicates the means for comparison. According to the informa¬ 
tion in Table XX, the greatest percentage of students who were 
participating in all recreational sports were those from the cities. 

A slightly greater percentage of the town students showed more 
participation in dance than did the city students, but in all activi¬ 
ties except "outing activities" they ranked ahead of the rural students. 
It follows, then, that the greatest percentage of non-participants 
came from the country. However, it was of interest to note that the 
cities and towns had non-participants in a ratio of one to two 
when compared with the rural areas. The fact that 143 of the

Type of High School Attended 

An analysis of participation in recreational sports according to 
the type of high school attended showed that again the city students ranked 
ahead of the town students, but were second in aquatics and outing activities 
when compared with the students who had attended a private high school. The 
analysis of present participation according to type of high school attended 
is shown in Table XXI. 

Socio-Economic Status 

To determine whether socio-economic status, based on parent's income, • 
had any effect on the students' present participation in recreational sports, 
an analysis was made with socio-economic status as the factor. Table XXII 
shows this analysis.

The percentage comparisons outlined in Table XXII indicate that 
the students* present participation in recreational sports increased with the 
increase in parent*s income. It was of interest to note, however, that parti¬ 
cipation in outing activities was least affected by low socio-economic status. 
Dance participation did not follow the general pattern of greater participa¬ 
tion with increased income, as there was a smaller percentage of student 
participation in category *C' than in category *A*. This would seem to indi¬ 
cate that participation in dance was not affected by low socio-economic 
status. 

The students in categories *A* and 'C* tended to favor partici¬ 
pation in individual sports although dance ranked very close to individual 
sports in category 'A*. Students from category *B* showed no preference 
between individual sports and dance. It was also noted that the percentage

Parents* Education 

The analysis of single sports showed that in each case a 
certain percentage of the participating students were from homes where 
one or both parents were active participants in, or enthusiastic suppor¬ 
ters of that sport. To determine whether parents’ educational background 
was a factor affecting present participation, the analysis which appears 
in Table XXIII was made. 

The information in Table XXIII shows that present participation 
increased in accordance with parents' education beyond high school. Slight 
exceptions to this general trend occurred in individual sports, team sports, 
and aquatics. In these sports, students whose parents have a high school

showed the greatest participation in individual sports and dance 
respectively. It was also noted that those whose parents have taken 
no high school, and those from homes where oneparent or both parents 
have a university education, favored dance as their main choice of 
recreational activity while in their first year at the University of 
Alberta. The other three groups all favored recreation in the form 
of individual sports. 

The greatest percentage of non-participating students were 
those from the category whose parents have taken no high school edu¬ 
cation. However, there were almost as many non-participating students 
from homes where one or both parents have a university education. 

Ancestral Background 

• h 

Table XXIV was compiled to determine whether ancestral back¬ 
ground was a determining factor in present participation in recrea¬ 
tional sports. The first three, that is, those groups which ranked 
first, second, and third in each recreational sport will be considered 
in this analysis because of the small number in some of the ancestral 
groups. 

The French students ranked in the top three in all activities 
except team sports, while the British and the Oriental students were 
amongst the top three in all but two sport sections. Examining each 
ancestral group to determine which type of activity they preferred, 
it was noted that the British, the German, the Ukrainian, and the 
Oriental groups showed that their highest participation was in indi¬ 
vidual sports. The group referred to as ’Other*, which included 
ancestral backgrounds not listed, the Other Slavic, and the Scandin¬ 
avian groups indicated that a greater percentage of their groups

participated in dance, and the French and the Dutch groups showed 
that the same percentage of their groups participated in dance 
as in individual sports. The ancestral groups which had the high¬ 
est percentage of non-participants were the 'Other*, the Dutch, and 
the German. 

Religious Affiliation 

Table XXV shows the present participants categorized accord¬ 
ing to their religious affiliation. The groups which rank first, 
second, and third according to their participation will be noted 
since some of the groups contain very few members. In individual 
sports, the Anglican, the Mormon, and the Presbyterian groups showed 
that a greater percentage of their members participated. The 
Anglican group also ranked amongst the top three in team sports 
and aquatics. The Mormon group led in participation in dance, and 
the Presbyterian group was first in aquatic participation. The 
United Church group was amongst the top three in all but two sports' 
sections, (individual sports and aquatics) and the Baptist group 
was amongst the top three in outing activities and aquatics. 

All religious groups showed the greatest participation in 
individual sports or in dance. These two sports ranked as equally 
favored by the Jewish group with 57.14 per cent of the group partici¬ 
pating in each activity. The Baptist group and the Evangelical group 
showed a similar interest in individual sports and outing activities. 
The religious groups which had the highest percentage of non-parti¬ 
cipants in recreational sports during their first year at the

University of Alberta were the Evangelical, the Jewish Synagogue, 
and the Greek Orthodox. 

Present Living Accommodation 

Another factor which may have affected the students* parti¬ 
cipation in recreational sports at university is their present 
living accommodation. To determine whether this factor played an 
important part, an analysis was made of the students who had taken 
no part in recreational sports during their first year at the 
University of Alberta. It was found that, although 13.33 per cent 
of the students who stayed in residence on the campus were non- 
participants, this group had the least percentage of non-partici¬ 
pants. Those who lived in private homes had a 35.29 per cent non¬ 
participation record, while those who lived at home and those who 
lived in suites, light housekeeping rooms, or rented a room but 
ate their meals out showed a non-participation percentage of 
16.78 and 16.43 respectively. This comparison indicated that the 
students who lived on campus had greater access to facilities for 
recreational sports than did the others. It is also probable that 
the students who lived alone in a private home, a room, or at home 
would experience greater difficulty than the residence students 
in planning for their recreational activities. 

Age 

‘Age* is another factor which is sometimes stated as a reason 
for non-participation in sports. However, it was found that 46 of 
the non-participants were in the seventeen to nineteen age group, 







97 . 


and although the remaining 18 were in the twenty to over-thirty 
age group, the latter age group did have 43 students who were 
active in recreational sports during their first year at the 
University of Alberta. 

Summary 

From the preceding analysis of factors, and from the 
description of the students' interest and participation in each 
of the sports sections, it was found that students from the country, 
and those from a low income bracket did not take as active a part 
in recreational sports as the others. Interest was expressed in 
all sections, but the greatest amount of participation at the 
University of Alberta was in individual sports and in the dance. 
While at high school, individual sports and team sports had ranked 
first and second respectively. The greatest number of requests 
for instruction were made for swimming which indicated that, 
although aquatics ranked fourth in this survey, participation 
was not hindered because of lack of interest. 

It would appear that since the majority of the students 
took part occasionally or regularly in physical recreation, they 
are aware of the satisfactions that recreational sports offer the 
individual. The school continues to play an important role in 
promoting physical recreation as a leisure-time activity, but the 
number who had been given instruction in physical recreation at 
school did not compare favorably with the total number of students. 
This indicated that more instructional sessions in physical recrea¬ 
tion are needed at the high schools and at the University of Alberta 
to satisfy the students’ needs.

CHAPTER VI 


FINE ARTS 


Another important leisure-time need is creative recrea¬ 
tion. "To create with one's hands or mind things, or ideas, or 
lovely tones is an experience particularly valuable to young 
people.”'*' With the present emphasis on scientific research, 
the educated man is apt to forget to develop the whole persona¬ 
lity which includes the cultural and creative as well as the 
academic. All people have need for the development of the 
innate artistic and aesthetic qualities. In planning for leisure, 
the fine arts - drama, art, and music, are facets of participation 
in cultural activities which are a necessary part of free-time 
hours. Given the opportunity and proper guidance, this creative 
urge and desire for self-expression can be fulfilled. 

School administrators agree about the necessity of including 
the fine arts in the curriculum. Evidence of this is found in the 
following resolution, passed at the 1959 Atlantic City meeting of 
The American Association of School Administrators to which Wiley L. 
Housewright refers: 

We believe in a well-balanced school curriculum in 
which music, drama, painting, poetry, sculpture, 
architecture, and the like are included side by 
side with other important subjects such as mathe¬ 
matics, history, and science. It is important that 
pupils as a part of general education, learn to 
appreciate, to understand, to create, and to criticize

with discrimination those products 
of the mind, the voice, the hand and 
the body which give dignity to the ^ 
person and exalt the spirit of man. 

Section three in the questionnaire was designed to determine 

3 

the students' interest and participation in the fine arts. The 
information on drama, art and music will be discussed in this chapter.

The greatest interest in the field of dramatics was shown 
in amateur acting where 66.66 per cent of the students partici¬ 
pated or expressed a desire to participate. The group which had 
participated in amateur acting represented 43.25 per cent of the 
students who had attended a city school, 57.25 per cent of the 
town school students, 52.94 per cent of private school students, 
and 33.33 per cent of rural high school students. 4 5 This would 
seem to indicate that either the city schools cannot accommodate 
the numbers of interested students, or a greater variety of acti¬ 
vities are offered to interest the student. To support this reason 
ing, it is also noted that out of fifty students who expressed a 
desire to participate in amateur acting, forty-six per cent were 
from city high schools. 

The greatest desire for participation was shown in costume 
design. This interest is in keeping with the interest shown in 

5 

dressmaking as indicated in the section on handicrafts. 

Fifty-five students (16.08 per cent) indicated that they had 
no interest in the dramatic area of fine arts. 

Elizabeth W.D.H. Duff stated that Drama was offered for credit 
in the Alberta high schools in 1936, and in 1946, teacher certifica 
tion was offered at the University of Alberta, but there was still

great need for trained instructors, timetable planning, and improved 
facilities. 0 

The information on Drama Club membership contained in Table XLI 

seems to indicate that this need is still present. 

Interest in attending plays and concerts was indicated by the 

students by listing it as their second choice of preferred activities 
7 

on a "date". This interest as a passive member of the audience seems 
to be the trend in many leisure-time activities. 

II. ART 

The interest and participation in this creative activity is 
shown in Table XXVII.

The information in Table XXVII indicates that the greatest 
interest and participation was in painting, which included oils and 
water colors, while sketching ranked second. 

Students who had attended a rural high school showed that they 
had the highest participation in painting, whereas, those who had 
attended a town school had the highest participation in sketching. 
This information, tabulated in percentages, is as follows:

Seventy-six students 

(22.22 

per cent) 

indicated 

that they had 

no 

interest in-any form of 

art or . 

any desire 

to participate. No 


attempt was made to determine the students* interest in visiting 
art galleries or viewing works of art, so it is possible that some 
of these students would show a passive interest in art in that way. 

III. MUSIC 

The significance of music as a medium of expression cannot be 
denied. It has been said that you listen to music with your heart, 
your head, or your feet. In other words, you listen with a full 
appreciation and understanding, or you listen with an emotional in¬ 
terest in the melody, rhythm, or tone. Music is a great companion, 
and it is always possible to find music to meet the need.

Oleta A. Benn made the following statement when referring to the 
place of music in a technological world: 


103. 


At its best it has reflected, with its 
sister arts, greatness of thought, large¬ 
ness of ideas, soaring imagination and 
penetrating insight into and sympathy for 
the problems of men, bound as they are to 
their finite selves yet straining toward 
infinity.^ 

Some people enjoy music by listening to it, while others, 
as well as listening for enjoyment, take a more active part and create 
music through the media of voice or instrument. 

Of the students in this study, 97.08 per cent stated that 
they enjoyed listening to music. Seven omitted the question, and 
only three said they did not enjoy listening to music. 

The type of music enjoyed most and the type of records collec¬ 
ted is shown in Table XXVIII. 

Semi-classical music was placed at the top of the list accord- 

9 

ing to first choice in the class of music most enjoyed. Popular 
music ranked second by a slight margin, but was placed first in choice 
of records collected. Although slightly more students indicated that 
they collected popular records, semi-classical records were collected 
almost as often. The complete listing showed a decided interest in 
classical and semi-classical music. 

Thirty-four students said they did not have access to a record 
player and therefore collected no records. Four others, although they 
had access to a record player, did not collect records.

Singing was enjoyed by 293 students (85.67 per cent). Of this 
group, only 18.77 per cent had voice training, which would seem to indi¬ 
cate that the enjoyment derived from singing had no significant connection 
with voice training. In fact, two students who had voice training said 
they did not enjoy singing. 

Participation in singing was mainly in informal group singing 
situations. This was true for those who had voice training, for those 
who had no voice training, and for those who stated that they did not 
enjoy singing. The church choir was the second most popular medium for 
participation. Those who had voice training ranked vocal solos third,

while the non-trained singers ranked glee clubs third. 

The query 10 regarding interest and participation in playing 
musical instruments showed that 219 students (64.03 per cent) played 
a musical instrument. 11 Of these 219, ten stated that they played 
in an orchestra or band, and twenty-eight indicated that they had 
played in an orchestra or band at one time. The answers indicated 
that the piano was the favorite instrument although other instru¬ 
ments were also listed. Of the 244 students (71.34 per cent) who 
had taken music lessons, 34 said they did not play, while 9 of the 98 
who had not had lessons stated that they did play a musical instrument. 

The foregoing information has indicated that music plays a 
very important part in the lives of these students. Whereas drama 
and art had some non-participants, 37.13 per cent and 36.54 per cent 
respectively, all but 11.98 per cent of the students indicated parti¬ 
cipation in singing or playing an instrument. 

Factors Affecting Opportunity for Music Lessons 

Socio-Economic Status

Increased socio-economic status, based on parent’s income, 
showed a direct relationship with the number of students who had 
music lessons. Since the piano was the favorite instrument, the 
purchasing power for the instrument alone would necessitate an ample 
income. The amount of money spent on lessons would be another size¬ 
able expenditure. In fact, the Bureau of Statistics survey on family 
expenditure indicated that 4.1 dollars was the average spent per 

family on musical instruments, while 41.8 dollars per year was spent 

12 

on special instruction which included music lessons. 

Home Location 

The geographic location of the home as a factor affecting 
the number of students who had taken music lessons showed the follow- 


ing relationship:

The students who lived in a city had a slightly greater opp¬ 
ortunity or interest than those who lived in a town. However, the 
number of rural students who had taken music lessons was much lower. 

This information seems to indicate that the opportunity for taking 
music lessons in the rural areas was considerably less than in towns 
or cities. It is encouraging to note, however, that over half of the 
rural students had taken music lessons.

Ancestral background had no direct relationship to opportunity 
or interest in taking music lessons. Although the students of the Dutch 
ethnic group recorded 100 per cent, this was such a small group of 
students that no safe conclusions can be made. 

A. FACTORS AFFECTING INTEREST AMD PARTICIPATION IN FINE ARTS 

To determine what effect factors such as home location, type 
of high school attended, parent’s income, parents' education, ancestral 
background, and religious affiliation might have on participation in 
the three areas of fine arts, percentage analyses were made. Drama 
participation was based on the 215 students who had indicated their 
participation in some form of dramatics. Art participation was based 
on the 217 students who had taken part in some form of art participation, 
and music participation dealt with the 301 students who played a musical

instrument or stated that they participated in singing and enjoyed it. 
It was noted that all but 67 or the 217 students who participated in 
art were drama participants as well. 

Home Location 

The analysis of fine arts participation with geographic loca¬ 
tion of the home as the Influencing factor is shown in Table XXIX.

The town students showed considerably more participation in

dramatics than the city and rural students. In art, a slight increase, 
five per cent, ranked the rural students ahead of the other two groups. 
Music participation showed the city and town students almost equal to 
one another, but ahead of the rural students by approximately ten per 
cent. 

Type of High School Attended 

The school as an agency in the development of leisure-time 
activities should play an important part in the amount of fine arts'

in the high school curriculum in Alberta. The effect that each of 
the four types of high schools had on the students* participation 
in fine arts is shown in Table XXX.

According 

to the i

contained 

in Table 

XXX, the percen- 


tage increase seems to indicate that the town school offered the greatest 
opportunity for participation in drama. Whereas, opportunity for'art 
participation was apparently greater for students in the rural schools, 
the private schools offered the greatest opportunity for music partici¬ 
pation. 

The number of drama participants who stated that they had attend¬ 
ed a high school where wise use of leisure had been stressed was 68.37 
per cent of the total. The number of art and music participants who said 
the same was 65.89 per cent and 69.43 per cent respectively. These per¬ 
centages rank favourably with the 68.71 per cent of the total group who 
said their high school had stressed wise use of leisure. Slightly more 
stress apparently was placed on music than on art or on drama.

Socio-Economic Status 

The effect that parent's income played on the amount of 
participation in the fine arts is tabulated in Table XXXI. Category 
'A' refers to a $1,000 - $5,000 income, category 'B' to a $5,000 - 
$10,000 annual income, and category 'C' to an annual income of over 
$ 10 , 000 .

increase 


over the other two categories in participation in all areas of the fine 
arts. Comparing the highest and lowest income brackets, it was noted 
that category 'C' ranked ahead of category 'A* in art and music partici¬ 
pation, but in drama participation the reverse was true. 

Parents* Education 

Emery's^ study of high school students in Toronto showed that, 
according to the students' answers, parents exerted the greatest influence 
on their choice of activities. It is also likely that parents' educational

According to the information contained in Table XXXII, students

in dramatics. The two lowest groups were those whose parents have no high 
school education, and those whose parents have no formal education beyond 
high school. This seems to indicate that students whose parents have had

some education beyond high school tend to show greater participation 
in dramatics. In art participation, however, those whose parents have 
no high school education ranked slightly ahead of those whose parents 
have a university education, and about even with those students whose 
parents had taken some form of education beyond high school. It would 
appear that art participation was not as dependent on parents' educa¬ 
tion as was drama participation. The general trend in music indicated 
that participation increased as education beyond high school increased.

The French groups of students showed the greatest parti¬ 
cipation in dramatics, while, next to the group referred to as 
’Other*, the Dutch group showed the least participation in this 
area of the fine arts. 

In art participation, the Oriental students ranked first, 
slightly ahead of the Ukrainian and Other Slavic groups , and 
next to 'Other*, the French and the Scandinavian groups showed 
the least participation. 

In music, the three Dutch students all participated in 
musical activities to rank that group first with one hundred per 
cent. This group was too small to make any definite conclusions, 
but it is noteworthy that four other groups also indicated parti¬ 
cipation of ninety per cent or more. These four in rank order 
were German, Scandinavian, Ukrainian and Other Slavic. The least 
participation was indicated by the Oriental group. 

Religious Affiliation 

The church, as an agency for the development of leisure-time 
activities,was listed by the students in this study as a factor in 
influencing interest. An analysis of fine arts participation 
according to religious affiliation is shown in Table XXXIV. 

In drama participation, students from the Roman Catholic 
group ranked first, while those from the Evangelical group were last. 
The students from the Greek Orthodox group ranked first in art 
participation and those from the Mormon group showed the least 
amount of participation. In music participation, the students from 
the Baptist group and the Jewish Synagogue group showed one hundred 
per cent participation, while those from the Presbyterian group

B. SUMMARY 

The greatest interest and participation in dramatics was in 
amateur acting with the students from the town high schools indicating 
the most participation during their high school years. Students who had 
attended a rural high school participated most in art. in which painting 
and sketching were the most favored. In music, students who came from 
the city and those who attended a private high school were most active.

The students showed great interest in semi-classical and 
classical music. They enjoyed singing, and the majority (64 per 
cent) played a musical instrument. 





CHAPTER VII 


HOME RECREATION 

The home has a great influence on the child's choice of 

leisure-time activity. Family recreation leads to greater family 

unity and is therefore an important part of family life.'*' 

Section four of the questionnaire included questions on 

home recreation activities such as listening to the radio, viewing 

television, playing quiet games, and taking part in family recrea- 
2 

tion. The results of the students 1 2 * 4 answers will be discussed in 
this chapter. 

I. LISTENING TO RADIO 

3 

According to the preference listing, Interest in radio 
listening was comparatively low as only eighteen students listed 
it as -their first choice. Listening to popular music was the first 
choice of 136 students (36.81 per cent). Listening to the symphony 
and listening to the news ranked low seconds with 11.98 per cent 

4 

listing each as their choice of radio program. 

II. TELEVISION 

Seventy students (20.46 per cent) stated that they did not 
have access to a television set. Of the total group under study, 
45.02 per cent said they enjoyed watching television, 50.58 per cent 
enjoyed watching occasionally, and 4.4 per cent stated that they did

not enjoy watching television. In the preference rating, television 
ranked fifth with only thirteen students listing it as their first 
choice. 

This lack of interest in television, as professed by the 
students, was in keeping with Witty's study which is referred to by 
John J. DeBoer. *'In 1950, Witty found that children devoted twenty- 
one hours per week to television viewing. In 1956, it was still 
twenty-one hours. Fortunately, TV viewing falls off during the

high school years. 1 Limited selection of television channels in 
this area would probably be another factor affecting the low interest 
ranking by the students in this study. 

The seventy students who did not have access to a television 
set made no attempt to list their favorite programs. The others 
indicated that "Perry Como ,! was their first choice, while theatre 
programs such as ’’Kraft Theatre” and "Studio Theatre”, and family 
programs such as "Father Knows Best" and "Leave It To Beaver" were 
second and third respectively. 

III. QUIET GAMES 

An indication of the students' interest and participation in 
quiet games is contained in Table XXXV. Card games (other than bridge) 
and bridge led the list of quiet games in which there was frequent 
participation. Card games (other than bridge) also ranked first in 
the list of games in which there was occasional participation, and 
bridge was the game in which there was the highest indication of in¬ 
terest. As was noted in the hobbies section, there was more occasional

participation. The ratio in this.case was approximately 9 to 1. The 
ratio of interest as indicated by the desire to participate compared with 
the number who frequently participate was approximately 2 to 1. It is 
impossible to ascertain whether the desire expressed was not fulfilled 
because of lack of knowledge, opportunity, or time. Of the 342 students 
in the study, six indicated no interest or participation in quiet games, and 
thirteen indicated no participation. 

IV. FAMILY RECREATION 

The family occupies a central place in social life and culture. 
Family life constitutes a group experience which is the individual's first 
step in association with other people, and therefore is the basis for asso¬ 
ciations with subsequent groups. Urbanization has brought with it the

commercialization of recreational activities which has caused members 
of the family to tend to engage in separate activities according to 
their sex and age group. In this study, 32.45 per cent stated that 
they frequently did things with the family, 62.28 per cent said that 
they did occasionally, and 5.27 per cent indicated that they never 
spent their leisure-time with the family. 

The activities carried on with the family group are shown in 
Table XXXVI. Although some of the students said they never did things 
with the family, they did indicate some activities in which there was 
family particitpation.

Travel is the activity which was most often carried on by the 
family as a group. Entertaining and visiting friends, a social activity 
which is carried on in the home, ranked second. Wylie's 7 study stated 
that nature and outing activities ranked first in frequency of partici¬ 
pation by the 504 families under study. In this study, going on picnics 
and outdoor activities ranked third and fourth respectively. 

George W. Donaldson and Louise E. Donaldson stated that "Family 
camping is probably the growing-est thing in the field of recreation 

o 

today . . . but in its independence lies its strength." It is possible 
that with the increased emphasis on outdoor education by recreation per¬ 
sonnel, a future survey would reveal this activity ranking higher on the 
list of family recreation. However, it must be noted that travel, which 
ranked first, was not classified as to kind, so it is possible that out¬ 
door activities were included in that activity as well. 

A. FACTORS AFFECTING FAMILY RECREATION 

The participation in recreation by the family as a whole is a topic 
worth further consideration. In an attempt to determine whether there are 
certain factors that affect the amount of family participation, an analysis 
was made according to home location, parent's 1 income, education, ancestral 
background, and religious affiliation. The group studied was the 111 
students who participated in family recreation frequently.

The analysis according to home location indicated the follow¬

35.61 


Students whose homes are in the rural areas showed a slight 
increase in family recreation over those whose homes were in a city, 
and in a town. Urbanization has apparently lessened the amount of 
recreation in which there is family participation. 

Socio-Economic Status 

Leisure has always been synonymous with wealth since the 
people in the low-income brackets have had to spend their time at 
work. To determine whether income had any bearing on the frequency 
of family recreation the following tabulation was made:

It was of interest to note that although the students in the 
top income bracket ranked above the other two categories in frequent 
family recreation, those in the lowest income bracket were a very 
close second. It would appear from these results that although in¬ 
come can be an aid to family recreation in the form of travel and 
luxuries, much family recreation can be carried on by those who are

in a low income bracket. 

Parents 1 Education 

The analysis of parents* education as a factor influencing 
the amount of family recreation showed the following:

34.17

Education tended to increase the amount of participation in 
family recreation, since the lowest percentage was in the group whose 
parents did not have a high school education. However, the students 
from homes where one parent had a university education and one had 
special training ranked lowest in the remaining four groups. 

Ancestral Background 

To determine whether ancestral background was a determining 
factor in the frequency of family recreation the following percentages 


were calculated:

The information tabulated above indicates that a greater per¬ 
centage of the Mormon students participate in frequent family recrea¬ 
tion than any other religious group. 

Family Recreation in Homes Where the Mother Does Not Work 

There were 224 homes where the mother did not work at a job 
other than that of homemaker. On further analysis, it was found 
that 60.36 per cent of the students who participated frequently in fam¬ 
ily recreation came from these homes. This analysis was in keeping with 
the amount of frequent family recreation by rural families, as over 
eighty per cent of the mothers in the country did not have two jobs. 

In contrast, approximately forty-five per cent of the mothers from the 
towns and cities were working at jobs outside the home. 

Comparing this factor with the ancestral and religious 
analysis, it was found that although approximately eighty per cent 
of the mothers in Ukrainian homes were not working, the Scandinavian 
group ranked first in frequent family recreation. Approximately 
seventy-four per cent of the mothers in Scandinavian homes were not 
working. Although the Mormon group ranked first in frequent family 
recreation, approximately forty per cent of the mothers were working, 
while the Lutheran group had the least number of working mothers 
with approximately thirty per cent working at a job outside the home. 

Summary 

This chapter has described the interests and participation of 
the students in home recreation. It was noted that activity was evident

in a variety of ways, but desire for participation often exceeded 
the amount of actual participation. Travel was the activity in 
which there was the most family recreation. In homes where the 
mother worked, there was a lack of frequent family recreation. 

This was in keeping with the amount of family recreation indicated 
by rural students, as very few mothers of rural families worked at 
a job outside of the home.

CHAPTER VIII 


INDIVIDUAL RECREATION 

In this chapter ,the writer will describe the interests and 
pursuits of the students in what has been termed individual recrea¬ 
tion. This includes activities such as attending movies, travelling, 
dating, conversing on the telephone, and handicrafts and hobbies. 

It is evident that leisure-time activity is a personal 
matter. It serves different purposes for different people and the 
choice depends on opportunities, individual differences, and the 
influences of various agencies. The pleasures and satisfactions lie 
in the fact that the activity satisfies some need. These needs 
include new experiences, recognition, opportunity to create, oppor¬ 
tunity to serve others, a sense of belonging, art and beauty, and 
physical activity. Social activities play an important role in 
personality development, as recreation is seldom enjoyed in isola¬ 
tion. However, to obtain a balanced diet, some activities are carried 
on alone and the results are enjoyed with others. 

I. ATTENDING THE MOVIES 

The students ranked attending movies and reading equally, as 
the two activities preferred when they were asked to number their 
first to fifth choices. Going to plays and concerts was second, while 
listening to radio and viewing television were third and fourth re¬ 
spectively."

The majority of the students (61.11 per cent) saw one or 

two picture shows per month, 38.76 per cent saw three or four, 

5 per cent saw five or more, and 8 per cent said they saw none. 

One student stated that she saw ten or more shows each month, but 

explained that they were double features. The answers showed that 

the type of picture enjoyed most was drama. Comedies and musicals 

ranked second and third respectively, while westerns were enjoyed 

2 

by only four students* 

Although 248 students said they usually went to the movies 
with a boy friend, this leisure-time activity ranked third in 
first-choice preferences of activities on dates. Ninety-four said 
they usually went with a girl friend, thirty-six with some member 
of the family, and nine said they usually went alone. 

It would appear that this passive form of social recreation 
is a common leisure-time activity. Although it is a source of 
relaxation and vicarious pleasure, like most commercial recreation 
it demands little of the participant except time and money. 

II. TRAVEL 

In this mobile age it Is expected that travel would be a 
popular activity. It has become the usual way of enjoying the 
annual holiday and for that reason should rank high in family recrea¬ 
tion. 

The results of the study bear this out, as travel ranked 

first in the list of activities in which there was participation by 
3 

the whole family.

To gain some indication of the amount of travelling the 

students had done, various questions referring to places visited

were included in the questionnaire. The results appear in Table

up of 22.99 per cent of city students, 26.82 per cent of town 
students, and 61.63 per cent of the students whose homes were 
in the rural area. This information indicates that the students 
from the rural areas have had the least opportunity to travel. 

Socio-Economic Status 

Travel was also found to be dependent on socio-economic status.

Twenty-eight students had been to Europe, and twenty-four had 
been to other countries. It appears that socio-economic status has 
a bearing on opportunity for travel to Europe, since eighteen of the 
twenty-eight students (64 per cent) were in socio-economic categories 
'B* and *C'. According to the geographic location of their homes, 

11 per cent of the 187 city students, 5 per cent of the 82 town 
students, and 4 per cent of the 73 rural students had been to Europe. 

The number of students who said they could drive a car numbered 
252. Of these, 158 had a driver's license, and 18 owned their own cars 
Four per cent of the car owners were in category *A*, 6.8 per cent in 
category f B', and 8.6 per cent in category 'C*. Although no attempt 
was made to determine the model of car owned, it appears that owning 
a car tends to increase with socio-economic status. 

III. CONVERSING ON THE TELEPHONE 
The telephone is an important instrument for business and for 
pleasure. The interest shown in visiting on the telephone by the 
students is indicated in Table XXXVIII.

Half an hour or more per day, was spent conversing 
on the telephone by twenty-four per cent of the students. Of 
these eighty-three students, it was noted that 72.29 per cent 
lived at home. Access to the telephone, and living in the vicin¬ 
ity of former friends were factors which determined the amount of 
time spent on the telephone.

Another issue which was raised in conjunction with this 
section dealt with the degree of participation. It was found that 
attending dances and parties, which was their first choice, also was 
what they did most often. Going to movies ranked second in the list 
of activities done most often. This ranking compared favorably with 
their interest in that activity. However, attending plays and con¬ 
certs dropped from second to seventh, which indicates that they did 

not participate in this activity as often as they would like.

Interest and participation in hobbies and handicrafts, tabulated 
in Table XL, shows that there was frequent participation in dressmaking, 
collecting items, and caring for pets. These activities ranked first, 
second, and third respectively. Those in which there was occasional par¬ 
ticipation were gardening, embroidery, and photography. Leathercraft was 
placed first in the list which indicated what they would like to do, while 
photography was second and crocheting third.

There were more handicrafts and hobbies done occasionally 
than those that were done frequently. The ratio was approximately 
8 to 3. There were also more who indicated that they would like to 
participate in a handicraft or hobby than those who were participating 
frequently. This comparison showed a ratio of 4 to 3. It was noted 
that all but eighteen students had some handicraft or hobby which 
they pursued frequently or occasionally. 

Summary 

The results showed that the majority of the students attended 
one or two shows each month, and that the "drama* 1 type of movie was 
most preferred. The city students had travelled most, while the 
rural students had travelled least. On dates, dances and parties 
were most preferred and were also attended frequently. The interest 
in handicrafts and hobbies indicated that dressmaking was preferred, 
but there was more occasional participation than regular participa¬ 


tion in all handicrafts and hobbies.

CHAPTER IX 


CLUBS AND SOCIETIES 


Clubs and societies are a medium through which the need for 
companionship can be satisfied. Active membership in these organized 
groups also provides a good training for democratic living as well 
as for getting along with people. As a member of a club, and 
especially asa member of the executive, the ability for planning and 
for the carrying out of these plans is developed. 

The students* interest and participation in organized social 
groups is shown in Table XLI.

School or Faculty Club Membership 

According to the information contained in Table XLI, 179 students 
(52.33 per cent) were members of their school or faculty society. 
Membership ranged from one hundred per cent in Commerce and in Physical 
Education to nine per cent in Nursing. Education, Pharmacy, and House¬ 
hold Economics each had approximately sixty-seven per cent membership. 

The general trend in all clubs was to indicate their intention 
of joining next year. In all but seven clubs, the number planning to 
join next year exceeded the number who were members this year. It is 
sound judgment on the part of the student’s advisor to suggest that 
the student should not become involved in too many clubs and societies, 
because worthwhile membership demands much of the individual’s time and 
energy. In this study, no student belonged to more than three clubs 
and the average was 1.3 clubs per student. 

Religious Club Membership 

Membership in religious clubs ranked second to school or facul¬ 
ty membership. During high school, 142 students were members of a reli¬ 
gious club. Out of this group of 142 students, fifty per cent were 
members during their first year at the University of Alberta, and 
approximately ten per cent said that they would join next year. The 131 
present members included fifty-seven students who were not members dur¬ 
ing high school. Out of this group of new members it was noted that 
thirty-four students (59.64 per cent) came from the towns and the rural 
areas. All the religious faiths were represented in the present member¬ 
ship. The Mormon (Latter Day Saints) group had the closest to perfect 
membership with eighty-nine per cent of their group belonging to a re¬ 


ligious club.

Physical Recreation Club Membership 

Forty-seven students belonged to a badminton club while they 
were at high school. Of this group, 65.95 per cent had taken their 
high school education at a city school, 29.78 per cent had attended 
a town high school, and 4.27 per cent had attended a private high 
school. No students who attended a rural high school were badminton 
club members while at high school. Although the number of badminton 
club members from town high schools is relatively small, it does give 
an indication of the progress being made in providing gymnasia for 
town schools in the province of Alberta. 

Whereas 47 students were members of a badminton club during 
high school, only 7 were members of the badminton club at the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta. Membership in the bowling club presented a similar 
pattern with 34 members in high school and only 16 at university. The 
same trend was even more apparent in curling, where it was found that 
54 students were curling club members during high school and only 6 
were members during their first year at the University of Alberta. 

The drop in club membership at the University of Alberta when 
compared with the club membership at the high schools may be attributed 
to one or more of the following reasons: 

1. First-year students tend to wait until their second year 
to join a club. This is indicated by the number who expressed their 
intention of joining a club next year. 

2. Whereas the membership at university refers to one year, the 
membership during high school includes a period of at least three years. 

3. A student in a new environment may be hesitant about join¬ 


ing a club.

4. Publicity for membership presents a greater problem at 
the University of Alberta than in the high schools where all the 
students are in the same building. 

5. Students' likes and interests may have changed after 
leaving high school. 

A combination of one or more of the reasons listed above has 
probably resulted in a relatively small first-year membership at the 
University of Alberta. 

FACTORS AFFECTING MEMBERSHIP IN CLUBS AND SOCIETIES 

An analysis was made to determine what effects factors such 
as home location, type of high school attended, socio-economic status, 
parents' education, ancestral background, and religious affiliation 
might have on club membership. The groups included in the analysis 
were the 179 students who were members of their school or faculty 
society, the 131 students who belonged to a religious club, and the 
50 students who joined a women's fraternity while at the University 
of Alberta for their first year. These groups were chosen because 
they represented the three clubs in which the membership at the univ¬ 
ersity exceeded the high school membership. 

Home Location 

Table XLIII shows the analysis of club membership according to 
home location. A greater percentage of the rural group held a member¬ 
ship in school or faculty societies and in religious clubs than did the 
town or city groups. However, in fraternity membership there were no

rural students, while the students from the towns and cities showed a 
membership of 4.87 percent and 24.59 per cent respectively. 

Type of High School Attended 

The analysis according to the type of high school attended is 
contained in Table XLIII. It was found that two-thirds of the students 
who had attended a rural high school were members of their faculty or 
school society. The 66.66 per cent membership of the rural high school 
students ranked them first in school or faculty clubs, while the town 
students were first in religious club membership with a participation 
percentage of 44,00. In fraternity membership the city and private high 
school groups recorded 24.02 per cent and 23.52 per cent to rank them 
first and second respectively.

Socio-Economic Status 

To determine what effect socio-economic status had on club member¬ 
ship, an analysis of the three membership groups was made with socio¬ 
economic status as the influencing factor. The results which appear in 
Table XLIV show that the students from the two lowest income categories had 
the highest percentage of membership in faculty or school societies. 
Category f B* ranked slightly ahead of category 'A*. In religious club 
membership the students in category 'A* had the highest percentage of mem¬ 
bers. Increased income noticeably affected fraternity membership as the 
percentage of membership in category *C' was four times greater than that 
in category 'A*.

Parents 1 Education 

Parents* educational background had no noticeable effect on students' 
membership in faculty of school clubs as fifty per cent of each category 
held a present membership. Those students whose parents have a high 
school education only, ranked first in religious club membership with 
43.29 per cent. The greatest difference was noted in fraternity membership 
where the students whose parents have a university education and special 
training beyond high school ranked first, Table XLV shows the analysis. 

Ancestral Background 

The analysis according to ancestral background is shown in Table 
XLVI. In faculty or school society membership, the students of Dutch, 

French, and Other Slavic backgrounds ranked first, second, and third re¬ 
spectively. The Other Slavic students also were In the top three in 
religious club membership. They had the highest percentage of membership,

According to the analysis of the club membership with ancestral 
background as the determining factor, the Other Slavic group was the most 
membership conscious. 

Religious Affiliation 

According to religious affiliation, as analyzed in Table XLVII, 
the Evangelical group of students led in faculty or school membership with 
seventy-five per cent of their group as members. The Mormon 1 (Latter Day 
Saints) group showed the closest to perfect membership in religious clubs

CHAPTER X 


SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

In this study, the subjects surveyed were 342 first-year 
women students who registered in September, 1958,in faculties or 
schools to obtain a Baccalaureate degree at the University of 
Alberta, Edmonton campus. 

How these students spend their leisure-time, and what they 
would like to do during their leisure hours, were the main topics 
in the questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was given during 
the last two weeks of March, 1959. It included six sections of 
leisure-time activities which were: (l) leisure reading, (2) 
recreational sports (3) fine arts (4) home recreation (5) indivi¬ 
dual recreation (6) membership in clubs and societies. 

The summary of the study follows the order of the main body 
of the report in describing the students' interests and pursuits in 
each of these six areas. Factors such as home location, type of 
school attended, socio-economic status, parents' education, ances¬ 
tral background, and religious affiliation, which may have affected 
the students' leisure-time interests and pursuits refer to all six 
sections to aid the reader in understanding their influence. 

I. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Leisure Reading 

Reading was listed as first choice by 34.79 per cent of the 
students, and one-third of the students had read more than ten books 
during the past year. Fiction was preferred to non-fiction by a ratio 
of approximately three to one, with the novel and biography the best 
liked in the respective sections. The students indicated that author's 
name was the usual method used when choosing a leisure reading book. 

Whereas 39.18 per cent of the students stated that they pre¬ 
ferred reading books to reading magazines, only 12.86 per cent said 
they preferred magazines to books. The Reader's Digest was the maga¬ 
zine most of the students ranked first, while Time or Newsweek was 
next in order of choice. 

Insofar as newspaper reading was concerned, 64.61 per cent 
read a paper regularly with the majority reading the front page, the 
headlines, and the comics. 

Recreational Sport s 

The section on recreational sports was divided into five areas. 
These were individual sports, team sports, aquatics, outing activities, 
and the dance. The participation percentages during the students' 
years at high school and their one year at the University of Alberta 
are tabulated as follows:

To determine whether the students tended to participate in 
the sports in which they had high school instruction, and also what 


additional instruction was requested, the first six are ranked in 


each category, as follows:

This tabulation indicates that high school instruction in 
dance, volleyball, and badminton carried over to the students' 
leisure-time participation to the greatest extent. 

Approximately twenty per cent of the students took no part in 
recreational sports while at the university during their first year. 
The two physical education classes per week were the only source of 
physical recreation activity for these people. 

Fine Arts 

This section on fine arts includes information on the students' 
interests and participation in drama, art, and music. 

In the field of dramatics, participation during high school and 
university was mainly in amateur acting. When asked what they would 
like to do, costume design, make-up, and stage design were the activi¬ 
ties most often listed. Approximately two-thirds of the students 
had taken part in some form of dramatics, while 16.08 per cent indi¬ 


cated no interest. 






. n 












148 . 


The greatest interest in art was shown in painting and 
sketching. The numbers indicating their desire for participation 
in art was considerably less than for drama* 

The majority of the students participated in some form of 
music. Seventy-one per cent had taken music lessons, and 64.32 per 
cent stated that they played a musical instrument. Semi-classical, 
popular, and classical opera were the three classes of music pre¬ 
ferred. This interest was also evident from the kinds of records 
collected. Participation in singing was mainly in informal group 
singing, church choirs, and glee clubs. 

One-third of the students had taken music as an option at 
high school, while the majority of the others stated that music 
instruction was not offered, or they could not fit it into their 
time-tables. 

Home Recreation 

Home recreation covered the usual leisure-time activities that 
are carried on in the home or with the family group. In this survey, 
radio listening, television viewing, playing quiet games, and family 
recreation were included. 

The students’ main interest in radio was listening to popular 
music. Symphony and news ranked second with 11.98 per cent listing 
each as their first choice. However, radio listening was not a favor¬ 
ite leisure-time activity. In the comparison in which listening to 
the radio ranked fourth, television viewing was fifth with only 3.80 
per cent listing it as their first choice.

Much interest and participation was shown in playing quiet 
games. There was frequent participation primarily in card games 
other than bridge and in bridge, and occasional participation in 
card games and checkers. When asked what they would like to do, 
bridge and chess were named most often. 

The activities in which the family participated as a group 
were primarily travel, entertaining and visiting friends, picnics 
and outdoor activity. Only 32.45 per cent of the students indi¬ 
cated that their families frequently participated in leisure-time 
activities together. 

Individual Recreation 

The questions in the section on individual recreation dealt 
with interest in attending movies, travelling, conversing on the 
telephone, dating, and hobbies and handicrafts. 

The students' interest in going to movies was equal to their 
interest in leisure reading according to first choice ranking. 

Attending movies was also third in preferences of entertainment on 
a date. Over one-third of the students went to three or four shows 
each month, while almost two-thirds saw one or two shows per month. 
Drama was listed by 44.75 per cent as the favorite type of show 
enjoyed, while comedies and musicals ranked second and third respect¬ 
ively. 

Travel was listed as the main activity in which there was 
family participation. However, because travel is dependent on parent's 
income, some students had travelled much more than others.

The amount of time spent in conversing on the telephone 
varied from less than one minute to over one hour per day. 
Twenty-four per cent of the students stated that they spent 
thirty minutes or more talking on the telephone each day. 

Attending dances and parties was the first choice of 47.66 
per cent of the students as their preferred activity on a date. 
Attending plays and concerts, and going to the movies ranked second 
and third respectively. However, the students did not go to plays 
and concerts as often as desired. 

Handicrafts and hobbies were an important leisure-time activ¬ 
ity as 94.73 per cent of these students indicated that they parti¬ 
cipated frequently or occasionally. However, the ratio of frequent 
participation to occasional participation was approximately 3 to 8. 
Dressmaking, collecting items, and caring for pets were the three 
hobbies in which there was the most frequent participation. When 
asked what they would like to do, leather craft, photography, and 
crocheting were listed most often. 

Clubs and Societies 

The students belonged to an average of 1.3 clubs each during 
their first year at university. The general trend in all clubs was 
an indication of their intention to join next year. The highest 
membership in rank order, was in school or faculty societies, re¬ 
ligious clubs, and women’s fraternities. 






B. FACTORS AFFECTING LEISURE-TIME INTERESTS AND PURSUITS 


By analyzing interests and pursuits in each of the leisure- 
time sections, it was found that home location, type of school 
attended, economic status, and parents' education were the great¬ 
est influencing agents. The six factors will be dealt with 
separately in describing how they affected each of the leisure¬ 
time activities covered in this survey. 


Home Location 

The total number of students surveyed was 342. Out of this 
number, 187 were from a city, 82 were from a town, and 73 were 
from the country. 

The information from Tables XIV, XX, XXIX, and XLII, tabu¬ 
lated according to first-place ranking only, is summarized as foll¬ 
ows: 


City Students: had access to the best home 

libraries, ranked first in 
participation in individual 
sports, team sports, aquatics 
and outing activities, ranked 
first in music participation, 
and first in fraternity member¬ 
ship. 

Town Students: read the most (slightly more than 

city students), ranked first in 
dance participation, and drama 
participation. 


Rural Students: expressed the greatest interest 

in reading, ranked first in art 
participation, faculty member¬ 
ship, religious club membership, 
and frequent family recreation.

income of $5,000 to $10,000; and category 'C' represented an annual 
income of over $10,000.

CONCLUSIONS 

The interests and pursuits of the students are as varied as the 
individuals and are a product of many interrelated factors. No con¬ 
clusion can be made regarding how well they were prepared for wise 
use of leisure-time. However, there is a need for initial instruction 
in some cases and additional instruction in others. This conclusion 
is based on the numbers who expressed a desire for participation and a

two-thirds, read less than one book per month, 

2. The number of books read increases in accordance with 
access to home libraries.

ratio of 3 to 1. 

4. Author*s name is the usual guide used for selecting a 
leisure-reading book. 

5. Book-reading is preferred to magazine-reading. 

6. The comparative lack of interest in television viewing

Recreational Sports 

1. First-year women at the University of Alberta participate 
primarily in individual sports and in the dance. 

2. There is a major need for swimming instruction. 

3. Interest in team sport participation decreases from high

B. FACTORS AFFECTING INTEREST AND PARTICIPATION 
IN LEISURE-TIME ACTIVITIES 

Geographic Location of the Home 

Tables XIV, XX, XXIX, and XLII indicate the following! 

1. The rural students do not have an opportunity comparable 
to that of town and city students for the development of leisure-time 
activities. The need for increased libraries, instruction in music, 
and instruction in recreational sports, especially aquatics, is 
apparent. 

2. The rural students participate more often in family re¬ 
creation than do the town or city students. 

3. The students from the cities read more and have access 
to better home libraries than do the town or rural students. 

4. The city students* participation in recreational sports 
at the University of Alberta indicates that they have had the best 
instruction when a comparison is made with the other two groups. 

5. There is a need for increased opportunities in dramatics 
for city students. 

6. The student who is in a new environment tends to parti¬ 
cipate less in recreational sports than the student who is living at 
home. 

Type of High School Attended 

Tables XV, XXI, XXX, and XLIII indicate the following; 

1. The city high school and private high school graduates have 
had a better opportunity for the development of leisure-time interests, 
and for participation in leisure-time activities. 











'i;a' ;:>o

2. The students who attended a rural high school lacked 
instruction in recreational sports, dramatics, and in developing 
leisure-reading interest. 

3. The city high school and private high school graduates 
showed the highest interest and participation in reading, and in 
recreational sports. 

4. Students who have attended a town high school have had 
the best opportunity for participation in dramatics. 

Socio-Economic Status 

Tables XI, XVI, XXII, XXXI, and XLIV, indicate the following: 

1. Low socio-economic status (based on father's or guardian's 
income only) limits the number of books read, the student's access 

to home libraries, participation in all recreational sports, private 
instruction in sports, participation in all fine arts, and membership 
in fraternities. 

2. Participation in outing activities, the dance, and member¬ 
ship in religious clubs are least affected by low income. 

3. Although high income can aid family recreation, frequent 
family recreation is carried on by families who have low incomes. 

Parents' Education 

Tables XVII, XXIII, XXXII, and XLV indicate the following: 

1. Students whose parents have no high school education or 
a high school education only, tend to lack interest and to participate 
very little in leisure-time activities.

2. Students from homes where both parents have an 
education beyond high school, take the most active part in 
leisure-time activities. 

3. Parents' education is an important factor in the 
promotion of students' interest and participation in leisure- 
time activities. 

Ancestral Background 

Tables XVIII, XXIV, XXX, and XLVI indicate that the 
French, the Oriental, and the Dutch students have a wider 
leisure-time activity program than do students from the other 
ethnic groups. It is noted, however, that because of the few 
members in these groups the above can not be termed a valid 
conclusion without additional research. 

Religious Affiliation 

Tables XIX, XXV, XXXIV, and XLVII indicate that students 
from all religious groups, except the Lutheran group, ranked first 
in one or more of the leisure-time activities analyzed. It is 
again noted that because of the few members in some of the re¬ 
ligious groups, no valid conclusions can be made without further 
research. 

RECOMMENDATIONS 

1. The high school required reading program should have 
the students read one book written by each of ten different authors 
since "author's name" was the usual basis for selecting a leisure¬ 
reading book. 

2. The high schools and the University of Alberta should 
improve their physical education programs, and increase the amount 




bfi jU':,; 






161 , 


of instruction given in individual sports such as badminton, tennis 
golf, and archery. This recommendation is based on the students' 
requests for instruction in these activities. 

3. Since more requests were made for swimming instruction 
than for any other recreational sport, it is recommended that swimming 

instruction be a part of every physical education program. 

4. Tables XXVI and XXVII indicate that the number of students 

who expressed a desire for participation in drama and art exceeded 

the number who were participating while at the University of Alberta. 

Table XXIX indicates that the students who live in the city participated 

less than rural students in these fine arts,although,in almost all 

other leisure-time activities the rural students did not have the 
best opportunity for participation. It is recommended that steps 
be taken to improve the opportunity for participation in drama and 
art in the high schools and at the University of Alberta, so that 
the students’ desires can be realized. 

5. Non-school agencies should provide additional opportunities 
for youth participation in all leisure-time activities. Table XXVI 
indicates that, although fifty students expressed the desire for parti¬ 
cipation in amateur acting, only two students had participated in a 
non-school organization. Appendix B shows a similar trend in recrea¬ 
tional sports. 

6. Since there is a lack of frequent family recreation, 
especially in the cities, it is recommended that all agencies should 
place more emphasis on this leisure-time activity. 

7. Additional opportunity for participation and instruction in 
leather craft, photography, playing bridge, and playing chess should

be offered in community recreation programs. This recommendation 
is based on the information contained in Tables XXXV and XL, where 
the number who expressed an interest in these activities greatly 
exceeded the number who participated. 

8. An effort should be made to encourage the interest 
expressed in attending plays and concerts (Table XXXIX), by in¬ 
creasing the number of performances staged in schools and auditor¬ 
iums by local groups and by visiting personnel. 

9. More and better libraries should be provided in the rural 
areas of Alberta. This recommendation is based on the comparatively 
small amount of reading done by rural students and on the lack of 
libraries in their homes. 

10. Students living away from home should be given the most 
guidance and encouragement in their leisure-time pursuits at the 
University of Alberta. University residence accommodation would 

be one means of helping them feel that they are part of a group. 

This suggestion is based on the participation shown by the residence 
students in recreational sports. In that analysis, the students who 
live in the University residence (Pembina Hall), had fewer non-parti¬ 
cipants than the students who lived at home. 

11. Students whose homes were in the country, and those who 
were in a low-income category had less opportunity for participation 
in leisure-time activities. Community recreation programs should 

be offered to help solve the lack of leisure-time pursuits experienced 


by these students

SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY 

1. Since this study was designed as a broad survey, a 
more detailed study of each of the six main areas is needed to 
determine how well the students are prepared for wise use of 
their leisure-time, and what additional training is needed. 

2. A comparative study is needed to determine in which 
sections the greatest need for instruction is evident. 

3i There is need for a follow-up study on the group 
of students in this survey. This study should be made in the 
students' final year at the University of Alberta to determine 
their continued leisure-time interests and pursuits. 

4. Studies of first-year women students at the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta made each year for five consecutive years would 
result in a comprehensive comparative study. 

5. A similar study of the first-year men at the Univer¬ 
sity of Alberta would give additional information so that conclu¬ 
sions regarding Alberta youth could be made. 

6. Since this study gives no indication of the leisure- 
time interests and pursuits of high school graduates who are not 
furthering their education at the University of Alberta, a study 
of all youth not engaged in higher education is needed. 

7. A study of the recreational facilities and programs in 
Alberta as they now exist would indicate the progress being made 
in furthering the education for wise use of leisure-time. 

8. A case study of a specific community's program and a 
random sampling of individuals in that community is needed to deter' 
mine the relationship between program and individual pursuits.

9. An experimental study is needed to determine whether 
interest in an activity is primarily dependent upon the proficiency 
acquired in that activity. 

10. There is need for a test or tests designed to deter¬ 
mine a standard for wise use of leisure-time. Without such a 
standard it is impossible to determine how well an individual is 
prepared for leisure-time or what additional training is necessary.
