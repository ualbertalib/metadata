USE OE WATER FOR VARIOUS FARM CROPS. 1THDER DIEEERE23T 
SYSTEMS. OF .IRRICATIQU.. 

Chapter 1. 

IUTRQI) UClI PIT 

Each year irrigation is assuming. greater importance in the 
agricultural development of Southern liber t a. In the ranching days 
of the eighties and nineties, water was diverted from a few small 
streams on to adjoining hot tom lands to irrigate hay, hut the bringing 
of water into Lethbridge throught the canals of the Canadian forth 
West Irrigation Company in 1900 was the beginning of extensive 
irrigation in Alberta* At the present time, the two Canadian 
Pacific Railway projects east of Calgary and the one at Lethbridge, 
the Canadian Land and Irrigation Company Project at Vaux3ia.ll, the 
Taber project at Taber, the United Project at Glenwoodville and 
Hillspring, the Lethbridge northern, and a number of smaller projects, 
contain approximately one million acres of irrigable land. 

The development of these lands has naturally given rise to 
numerous questions,, among these being the proper use of Irrigation 
water. The problem of the proper use of water has been complicated 
not only by the usual factors of variation in soil types and climatic 
conditions, but also by the fact that the irrigated projects have 
received settlers from different parts of the irrigated west, all of 
these having brought with them their own ideas of irrigation as worked 
out in the localities from which they came. Many of the settlers 
have had no previous irrigation experience and look upon irrigation 
as something to be avoided except in cases of extreme drought. The 
whole situation Is such that, even in places where irrigation has 
been practised for over twenty years, no general method has been 
worked out that seems to be entirely satisfactory.

Because of this situation it seemed necessary that 
detailed investigations he undertaken to study the problem* 

Numerous experiments on the use of water have been conducted in 
the irrigated parts of the United States* Much of their data 
has been of value in Alberta, and is referred to freely in this 
report* Studies on the. duty of water have also been made in 
Alberta by Snelson (37) at the Department of the Interior Irrigation 
Experimental Station, Brooks, Alberta, supplemented by shorter 
experiments at Strathmore and Ronalane and by surveys of water use 
on farms in other parts of the province* 

Purpose of Investigations 

The experiments reported. In this treatise were conducted 
at the Dominion Experimental Station, Lethbridge, Alberta, and were 
planneds 

1* To obtain information as to the stage: of plant 
growth when water should be. applied to field 
crops* 

2. To study the value of fall irrigation. 

3* To determine the number of Irrigations required 
in different years by various crops* 

4. To investigate certain phases of the inter¬ 
relations of soils, soil moisture, and plant 
growth. 

5. To formulate standards of irrigation practice, 
from the data obtained, as well as from other 
information available, that will serve as a, 
guide, to the farmers on the developing irrigation 
projects of Alberta. 

Experimental Methods . 

Crops used in the experiment were Marquis spring wheat, 
Grimm alfalfa, Irish Cobbler potatoes, sugar beets from commercial 
German seed, and Russian Giant sunflowers*

These crops were grown on plots, containing one-twentieth 
or one forty-sixth of an acre and all tests were made in duplicate. 
E&ch plot was completely surrounded by a ditch seven feet wide. 

The bank of this ditch formed a dyke around tiie plot converting it 
Into a basin. The ground inside the dyke was levelled so that a. 
uniform application of water could be made over the entire area. 

Description of 3oil 

The soil where the plots were located is a medium sandy 
clay loam of chocolate colour. The physical analysis of soil 
samples taken where the various, crops were grown is presented in

Cropping and fertility Record of Soi l. 

The wheat grown in 1922 was on land that had been in 
corn the previous year and in alfalfa for the ten years preced¬ 
ing* For four years before the alfalfa, field was broken, it 
was used as hog pasture and the soil was in a high state of 
fertility. The wheat following wheat grown in 1923, except the 
plots, that were fall-irrigated, was on this same land. The fall- 
irrigated plots were on land that supported a heavy crop of white 
sweet clover cut for hay in 1921 and a. crop of wheat in 1922. 

The fertility of these plots was not quite equal to that of the 
balance of the field as shown by the uniformly lower yields of 
wheat on the fall-irrigated plots and on one check plot located 
in the same area. These plots were abandoned after two years as 
some underground seepage developed on one end of the field. 

The wheat after cultivated crop of 1923 was grown on land 
that had supported a. heavy growth of Russian Giant Sunflowers the 
preceding year. This land wan broken from alfalfa in 1921. The 
alfalfa was seeded in 1918 and had been cut for hay each year. 

Wheat after wheat in 1924 was seeded on the land Just described -and 
in 1925 these plots, which contained one-twentieth acre each, were 
divided by making a. ditch seven feet wide down the centre of each 
plot. The resultant plots contained one forty-sixth acre each. 

In 1924 another set of plots was established on an 
adjoining field which had the same cropping history and the three 
plot-sets were then rotated with two years of wheat and one year 
of potatoes. 

Potatoes followed wheal each year on the land described 
above. Ml wheat and potato plots received a. uniform application of 
tY/elve tons of well-rotted manure in the spring of 1927.

The alfalfa, plots were seeded in 1922. on Land that had 
"been rotated with oats, potatoes and peas for six years. 

Sunflowers were grown, on Land that had. been in a rotation 
of oats, peas and potatoes.. Potatoes were grown on this field in 
1922. The sunflowers were grown on the same pLots for the two years 
that they were included in the experiment* 

Sugar beets were under test for three, years beginning in 
1925, and were grown on the. same plots, each year. The field where 
these plots were located was in beans in 1924, wheat in 1923, sun¬ 
flowers in 1922 and alfalfa., in 192L and for three years previous. 
Thirty tons of welL-rotted barnyard manure, per acre were applied to 
the field and ploughed under in the fall, of 1.924* 

'll of the. soil and subsoiL where the various crops were 
grown appeared to be of uniform texture, structure and fertility 
over the entire fields, except as noted where the various crops are 
discussed in. detaiL* 

Cultural Practices . 

The cultural methods, used on all. crops were those which 
had proved to be. best from, previous work done at the Station* 

AlfaLfa was seeded in a. well-prepared seed bed on June 
23rd, 1922, on land that had been ploughed the preceding falL and 
kept free; from weeds*, fifteen pounds of Grimm alfalfa seed per 
acre were sown in drills and without ar. nurse crop. The plots were 
given a three-in eh irrigation immediately after seeding with the 
result that a. perfect stand of alfalfa was obtained. The weeds and 
alfalfa, on the plots were clipped twice during the first season. 

The Land prepared for wheat following wheat and for potatoes 
was ploughed in the spring to a depth of six inches and worked down 
immediately with a: spike-tooth harrow, except for the crop of 1925. 

In the fall of 1924, these plots were, fall-ploughed. In preparing

land for wheat following potatoes, the plots were cultivated, with a 
duck-foot cultivator in the fall after the potatoes were harvested, 
to assist in checking winter drifting, and. were cultivated again in 
the spring and harrowed before seeding. \ pure strain of Marquis 
wheat was seeded with a. 19-run, double disc drill, at the rate of 
ninety pounds of seed per acre. 

Irish Cobbler potatoes were planted in rows three, feet apart 
and to a depth of four inches with a two-man, horse-drawn planter. 
Certified seed potatoes were used at the rate of 1300 pounds per acre, 
the sets having been cut to two eyes to the set. Before cutting the 
sets, the potatoes were soaked for four hours in a one-to-two- 
thousand solution of mercury bichloride. The. potato crop was culti¬ 
vated from, three to four times eadh year and. furrows. were made between 
rows for irrigating. 

The. sugar beet land was ploughed in the fall except for the 
crop of 1926. In that year, the beet plots were not ploughed but 
were cultivated in the fall and-harrowed in the spring; before seeding. 
The beets were seeded in rows twenty-two inches apart with a special 
beet drill of the shoe type. -Seventeen pounds; of seed were used per 
acre. The beats, were thinned when in the four to six-leaf stage to 
twelve inches apart in the rows and cultivated and hoed as needed. 
Burrows were made between the rows before-each irrigation. 

Before harvesting a border at least three feet ride was 
trimmed from the perimeter of each plot of all crops under test. 

Irrigation 

The water used was obtained from the canal of the Canadian 
Pacific Railway’s Lethbridge project and was led to the fields in 
earth ditches. Before reaching the plots the stream was passed

through, a side-overflow weir constructed to give a, constant head 
of water. The water was measured over a rectangular weir of one- 
foot crest at the head of the alfalfa and sunflower plots and over 
a moveable, triangular-notch weir at the head of the other plots. 

The amount of water passing over the weir was. determined by tables 
given by Tlurdock and Bar her ('30), Tram, these tables other tables 
were constructed showing the number of minutes required for a. given 
application with varying heads of water. 

Ml alfalfa and grain plots, reported here received an 
application of six acre-inches of water per acre, at each application 
except in 1927 when due. to the unusually heavy rainfall, the irrigations 
were reduced, to three inches. Potatoes, sugar beets and sunflowers 
received four inches where but one irrigation was given and three 
inches where more than one irrigation was. made. 

In every instance, the date of application of water was 
gauged by a definite stage of plant growth or at a uniform period 
after such a stage where the habits of growth of the plant made it 
impractical to specify stages of growth. For example, wheat was 
irrigated in the one-leaf, three-leaf, five-leaf, shot-blade, flower¬ 
ing and soft-dough stages. These are all stages of growth easily 
distinguished. Potatoes were irrigated when the plants were half- 
grown, starting to bloom, and in full-bloom. Irrigations applied 
to potatoes after the full-bloom stage were placed at fixed intervals 
of ten or twenty days as there were no readily distinguishable 
growth stages after the potatoes were in full-bloom. 

The reason for selecting stages of growth instead of 
fixed dates was that plants appear to have different water re¬ 
quirements at different stages of growth. Investigations conducted 
by Bark and Palmer x showed that wheat and barley .grown in tanks

increased, their daily use of water as growth increased until the 
plants reached, full height. The use then remained almost constant 
until ripening commenced when the amount of water used decreased 
abruptly and became almost nil when the plants were ripe. While 
working in Idaho, Bark (2) found that grains required, the largest 
amount of water at the flowering or soft-dough stages, but that 
alfalfa, clover and pasture should be. kept uniformly moist through¬ 
out the season. According to the experiments, of Snelson (37), the 
water requirements of wheat were greatest in June, while the rate 
of plant growth was most rapid in July. Tidtsoe and Merrill (48) 
state that "The time at which water is applied to crops determines, 
largely, the yield" and that "July is. the month when most of the 
water should be applied to a beet field, with August applications 
following very closely in value, while in September a very small 
amount., indeed, aufJices to maintain growth*" In a later publication, 
Tidtsoe and Stewart (49) state that "During the early periods of 
growth, plants need less water than during later periods." 

Buff urn, (7) writing in 1892, made this interesting statement, 
"Wheat needs the most water during its early period of growth. Just 
before heading if the ground does not contain enough moisture, to last 
until the crop will mature, it should be irrigated, as water applied 
after the heads are formed is liable to induce rust." 

fortier (13) says "The amount of water required by cereals 
during the first six weeks of their growth its small if one excepts 
the heavy loss by evaporation from the surface of newly cultivated 
and seeded fields. The amount of water required during the. last 
three weeks, is likewise small."

From the results of tank and field experiments, Thom and 
Iioltz (39) concluded that the daily amount of water transpired by 
wheat, corn, oats and peas increased until about the be ginning of the 
ripening period* From, this time there was a gradual decrease up to 
maturity. 


Soil lloisture “Peterminations 

Moisture determinations were made of each foot of soil to 
a depth of six feet in the spring at seeding time, immediately 
before and after each irrigation, and in the fall after harvest. 

From one to four borings were made on e.a.ch plot at each sampling. 

Soil samples were secured, with a soil tube of the Briggs 
type, and the moisture was determined by oven drying to constant 
weight at 100° C. to 110° G„ 

leteorological Observations at Lat.3a.bridge 

Irrigation water is applied primarily to supply moisture to 
the soil for plant use. It is, therefore, evident that variations 
of rainfall and other climatic conditions influencing soil moisture 
content, evaporation and transpirat.ion, greatly affect the constancy 
of results obtained from irrigation experiments conducted under field 
conditions. 

The monthly and annual precipitation at Lethbridge for the 
six years that these experiments have been under way', together with 
the average precipitation for the twenty-six years that observations 
have been made,are presented in Table 2. The precipitation for the 
months when the rainfall has the princip.al effect on the crop of 
that year, April to August, inclusive, is also given. In Table 3, 
are introduced data on the evaporation from a, free water surface for

the months of May to October inclusive. The mean wind velocity 
for each of the months of April to October inclusive and the total 
hours of bright sunshine for the same months are listed in Tables 
4 and 5 respectively. 

Of all the weather factors, precipitation has, perhaps, 
the greatest influence on irrigation and varies the most from year 
to year. A study of Table 2 shows a. difference in the total 
precipitation of 1922, which had the lowest precipitation, and 1927, 
which had the highest, of 48.4 per cent, and a difference in the 
precipitation of the cropping season, of 42.9 per cent. The difference 
between the evaporation of 1924, which was the highest, and. 1927, 
which was the lowest, was 23.8 per cent, while the differences in the 
years having, the highest and lowest mean wind velocity and sunshine 
were still less. 

The. six-year period had three comparatively dry years, 1922, 
1924 and 1925 as indicated by the rainfall of the cropping season. 

The precipitation received in 1926 was supplemented to a marked 
extent by the unprecedented September and Octobdr precipitation of 
1925, which was the equivalent, of a good fall irrigation. The fall 
of 1926,was also wet, which condition, coupled with the heavy rainfall 
of May 1927 and timely rains of June and July, provided ample moisture 
without irrigation for potato, sugar beet and grain crops, and for 
the first cutting of alfalfa.

Chapter II 


IRRIGATIO N OT WHS AT 

Much literature is available reporting experiments with 
the irrigation of wheat. Only that is cited in this paper which 
seems to bear especially on the problem here involved, that is, 
the optimum time and frequency of irrigation. 

Review of Literature on Irrigation of Wheat 

In tests, at Broohs and Ronalane, lberta, Snelson (37) 
received maximum yields of wheat with five four-inch irrigations. 

Under the different conditions found in Utah., Tidtsoe and Merrill (48) 
obtained greater yields of grain from one light irrigation of 3.5 
inches applied when the heads were filling out than when this 
Irrigation was applied soon after the middle of June when the plants 
were smaller* Widtsoe (44) states that. rt It is seldom necessary to 
give wheat more than three irrigations except, possibly, in the hot 
climate of Arizona dnd similar regions. In fact, two irrigations 
are usual, and one irrigation ordinarily ample wherever the annual 
precipitation is between 12 and 15 inches.” Smith (36) recommends 
irrigating wheat: when just out of the boot. Mrom experiments con¬ 
ducted in Utah in 1890 to 1893, Sanborn (35) obtained increased 
yields of wheat in three years out of four when an irrigation in 
early May was given in addition to three later irrigations as 
compared.to the three later irrigations only. 

At the Goading 3u£-station, Idaho, Welch (42) obtained 
the best yields, with, three irrigations applied in the Jointing, 
booting and heading stages. Two irrigations applied in the jointing 
and heading stages gave but slightly lower yiel Cl 3 9 while two applied

in the booting and heading stages gave 2.3 bushels lesa than the 
three irrigations, '"/here but one irrigation was given, the best 
yield x^as secured when this was applied in the jointing stage. 

One irrigation applied in the booting stage gave better results 
than a later irrigation. Irrigating, at. the time of heading appeared 
to be of no value. Fortier (.12) says that "“When grain is heading 
out is the critical period in its irrigation.” A field at Lethbridge 
Alberta, is reported by Porter (33) that yielded 31 bushels per acre 
with an irrigation the first week in June. Part of the sizne field 
irrigated 1.0 days latter yielded. 26 bushels per acre and another 
irrigated on June 17th produced 19 bushels per acre. A part of this 
field not irrigated gave a yield of 15 bushels per acre. 

In a, carefully conducted experiment at the Colorado Station, 
where canvas roofing was used to keep all precipitation off the plots, 
Lazier and Robertson (22) obtained the highest yield where only one 
six-inch irrigation was given, when this was applied in the jointing 
stage. The plots irrigated at heading yielded a little less. Plots 
irrigated, at germination or tillering yieIded less than those 
irrigated at jointing or heading. The difference in yields when water 
was applied at germination and at tillering was so small that there 
was no real significance between the two. Then water was applied at 
the filling stage, it was of little benefit to the crop. 

The greatest yield of wheat was secured by Lnight and Hardman 
(26) in Levada, when irrigations were applied in the boot, bloom, milk 
and soft-dough stages. Another irrigation applied in the five-leaf 
stage did not increase the yield. Lien only three irrigations were 
given, the best times of application were at the boot, bloom and milk 
stages of growth.

In a four-years’ test (1912-1915) at the Utah Station on 
a. loam soil quite similar to the Lethbridge Station soil and with 
an annual rainfall Iso similar, Harris (15) obtained the greatest 
yields of wheat with three irrigations applied at the five-leaf, the 
early-boot and the bloom stages. There only one irrigation was given, 
the. best time to give it was; in the five-leaf stage. '.There two 
irrigations were applied, the five-leaf and boot stages were best. 

Water applied after the grain was planted, but before it was up, and 
that applied after the dough stage decreased the yield. He. also found 
that water applied during early groY/th increased the height of wheat 
more, than water applied at. any other time and that, the maturity of 
wheat was retarded by excessive irrigation. 

The same author (id), when working with a clay loam soil in 
pots, found that, wheat matured sixteen days earlier with 20 per cent 
moisture in the soil than with either 11 per cent or 45 per cent 
moisture, and that the period at which high moisture was applied had 
considerable effect on the date of ripening. The number of kernels 
to each head was greatest on soil with the medium, moisture content 
but the weight of 100 kernels was greatest on the driest and lowest 
on the wettest soil. 

Working in Hevada, in 1911, True (38) obtained the best yields 
of wheat from three irrigations before heading and two irrigations 1 
after heading*. In 1913, two irrigations before and t wo after heading 
gave the highest yields. 

Hour to six irrigations, were found necessary by Lloodgood and 
Curry (6) for highest yields of wheat, at the Hew Hemico Station. 

In the Quetta Talley, India, HoY/ard and Howard* (18) with a 
single irrigation and appropriate, mulch-producing cultivation, obtained 
1450 pounds of wheat per acre. The native average was 1100 pounds 
with the customary methods, involving seven irrigations.

Chiritescu-Arva (8) applied different amounts of water 
to wheat in containers of rolled zinc at three stages of growth - 
the green-shoot period, the ear-shooting period and the ripening 
of the ear period. The water optimum had the most beneficial effect 
in the green-shoot period on the following growth factors: number 
of ears per plant, total length of ears of single plant, number of 
fertile spilcelets, number of grains per single plant and ear, weight 
of ears in single plant, average weight of an ear, and grain weight 
per single plant and ear. The water optimum had a more beneficial 
effect in the ear-shooting stage than in either of the other stages 
on the following factors: development of spilcelets, density of 
spilcelets, density of grains, number of grains in single spilcelets, 
weight per 10GO grains, development of ears and grains in proportion 
to total yield and development of parts above ground and of grains 
in proportion to weight of ears. 

Iloliboga (29) obtained better results with wheat by moisten¬ 
ing the soil in the shooting stage than by moistening in the tillering, 
earing or milhy-ripenesa stages. 

Application of fater to Wheat at Lethbr idge 

In these experiments wheat received from one to four 
irrigations at different stages of plant growth as shown in the 
following schedule s 

A. One irrigation: 

1. Previous fall. 

2. Three-leaf stage. 

3. Five-leaf stage. 

4. Sho t-b1 ad e stage. 

5. Flowering stage. 

B. Two irrigations: 

1. Previous fall and shot-blade stage. 

2. Previous fall and flowering stages. 

3. Five-leaf and flowering stages. 

4. Shot-blade and flowering stages.

C. Three Irrigations: 

!• Previous fall, shot-blade and flowering stages. 
2. Five-leaf, shot-blade and flowering stages. 

D. Four irrigations: 

1. Previous fall, five-leaf, shot-blade and flowering 
stages. 

2. Five-leaf, shot-blade, flowering and soft-dough 
stages. 

S. Wien the crop appeared to need an irrigation. 

One series of plots was left unirrigated as a check. 

Yields of Grain Harveste d 

In Table 6 is given the yield of threshed grain obtained 
for the years 1922 to 1927 inclusive, with the various irrigation 
treatments applied to wheat on plots that had grown a cultivated crop 
the preceding year. Corn preceded the crop of 1922, sunflowers the 
crop of 1923, and potatoes preceded the wheat crops of the last four 
years. 

When this experiment was started in the spring of 1922, no 
land was available that had been irrigated the previous fall so that 
no tests were made of Pall-irrigated land until 1923. The series 
receiving water in the three-leaf stage was also started in 1923, thus 
giving but five years r data for the fall and three-leaf periods. As 
part of the test was conducted for six years, a six-year average is 
shown of all the tests conducted for that length of time and a five- 
year average is given for all the tests made. 

In Table 8 are listed the annual yields and five-year 
averages of the threshed grain obtained from wheat planted on land 
that had produced a crop of wheat the preceding year. An additional 
irrigation treatment, an application of water in the three-leaf and 
flowering stages, was added to this experiment in 1925. This addition 
was made because a lower yield was obtained in the dry year- of 1924

from one irrigation applied in the three-leaf stage, than from an 
irrigation applied in either the five-leaf or shot-blade stages. 

One reason for this lower yield appeared to be that the grain on 
the earlier irrigated plots suffered more for water before the plants 
matured than did the grain on the plots irrigated latdr. n important 
reason for applying an irrigation in the three-leaf stage was to 
test the correctness of the usually accepted opinion that irrigating 
grain before it was high enough to shade the ground materially 
reduces the yield. It seemed advisable, therefore, to include another 
irrigation in addition to the early one so that if a low yield were 
obtained, it could be determined whether this was due to the injurious 
effect of irrigation on the young plants or to a need of water in the 
later stages of growth. 

Each year when the wheat was mature, measurements were made 
of the average heights of the plants to the top of the apical 
spikelets, and these data are given for the two wheat series in Tables 


7 and 9

T.M. ?. Average He ight lo looH.s of PlMrt. .* Harvest of meat After «...« Irrigate! at 

Different Stages of Growth, 1924 - 1927. with 4-year averages. 



26 

















27 


A comparison of Tables 6 and 8 shows that the yields of 
wheat were decidedly better following a cultivated crop than following 
a crop of wheat in every year except 1923. The lower yields of that 
year following the cultivated crop were undoubtedly due to the fact 
that sunflowers were the cultivated crop grown the preceding year. 
Subsequent work has shown that sunflowers leave the soil in poor 
condition for a grain crop. 

Value of Vail Irrigation 

Seven direct comparisons are possible between fall irrigation 
and irrigations at other periods of the year. Vail irrigation on the 
wheat following wheat gave slightly lower average yields than was 
secured from comparable plots. This lower average v/as not great, 
however, and was caused principally by the poorer crop obtained on all 
of the fall-irrigated plots in 1923. As previously stated the land 
where the fall-irrigated plots were situated in 1923 proved to be 
inferior in fertility to the other plots of that year. There was no 
consistent difference in yields in the other four years. 

The wheat following a cultivated crop irrigated in the fall 
gave a slightly lower average yield fahen but one irrigation was 
applied than where an irrigation was given in the ttfiree-leaf, five-leaf 
or shot-blade stages, while the fall-irrigated plots gave a higher 
average than the other plots when additional water was applied during 
the growing season. The average differences were not large, however, 
and were not consistent from yea' to year. The crop yield data agree 
with the opinion formed in watching the crops from year to year - that 
a fall irrigation for grain on a medium-textured soil is about equal 
to an irrigation applied during the growing season if the latter 
irrigation is given before the crop becomes too dry.

iilar ly Irrigat ion for /hea t 

The opinion is prevalent among irrigation farmers that it 
is detrimental to grain crops to irrigate them before the plants are 
high enough to shade the ground. This experiment did not support 
such an opinion as the plots irrigated when but three leaves had 
appeared, gave practically the same yield as was obtained when the 
irrigation was postponed until the five-leaf stage, which was 
approximately two weeks later, or until the shot-blade stage, twenty- 
five days later, "Then the water was applied in the three-leaf stage, 
the plants turned yellow and for a few days appeared to be injured 
by the water, but within a week they had regained their colour and 
for the balance of the year were as thrifty as adjoining plots irrigated 
at a later date. It is undoubtedly this temporary yellowing of the 
plants that has caused irrigators to think that early irrigation is 
detrimental to grain* 

It should be remembered that these results were obtained 
on a sandy clay loam soil that does not !t bake w or form a crust on 
the surface to any serious extent after an irrigation. Grain crops 
on a heavier soil that "bakes” badly may not respond as well to early 
irrigation. 

Stage of Plant Growth When Irrigat ion '7as Host Effective . 

When but one irrigation was given, there was little 
difference in the average yields whether this was applied in the three- 
leaf, five-leaf or shot-blade stages. If the first irrigation was 
postponed until the flowering stage, the yields were seriously reduced 
in the drier years as the plants were materially injured by drouth 
before the water was applied. A first application of water as late 
as the flowering stage was beneficial, however, and gave an increased

yield over the plots receiving no irrigation in five years out of 
six on the wheat following cultivated crop, and in four years out 
of five on the wheat following wheat. 

When two irrigations were given, the best average yields 
were secured from the wheat following cultivated crop when these 
were applied in the previous fall and in the flowering stage. The 
wheat following wheat gave the best yields when irrigated at the 
five-leaf and flowering stages. 

Humber of Irrigations Required 

The maximum average yield was obtained with four irrigations 
on the wheat following cultivated crop and with three irrigations on 
wheat following wheat. However, the increase in yields with t he 
greater number of irrigations over that received from one or two was 
not sufficient nor constant enough from year to year to make the 
increase significant. 

3ugge sted Irrigation Practice for Pile at 

The results of these tests and a study of field irrigation in 
Southern Alberta for the past twenty-five years lead to the conclusion 
that, on medium and heavy soils, one irrigation, applied in the previous 
fall or in the spring or early summer, before the crop is seriously in 
need of water, will produce a good crop in the years of average rain¬ 
fall. If May and June are dry months, a second application of water, 
at the heading to flowering stage, may be required. On soil that is 
light or low in fertility, three irrigations may be necessary in drier 
years• 

Undoubtedly the most important item for the irrigation farmer 
to bear- in mind in considering his irrigation practice for wheat is to 
apply the first irrigation before the crop shows signs of needing water.

It seems advisable to irrigate as much of the grain land as possible 
in the previous fall, and as soon as seeding is finished in the spring 
to ditch the fields that were not fall-irrigated and start irrigating 
early enough ho that the first irrigation will be completed before 
any of the grain is injured from lack of water.

Chapter III 


IHRICtATIQIT OB ALgALWA 


Of all the factors contributing to the success of 
irrigation farming, the introduction of alfalfa as a forage and 
rotation crop is perhaps the greatest. As alfalfa is an important 
crop in almost all localities where irrigation water is used, it is 
only to be expected that numerous investigators have attempted to 
determine satisfactory irrigation practices for this crop. There 
seems to be a general agreement in the findings of most of the 
investigators that alfalfa requires a comparatively constant soil- 
moisture supply throughout the season, necessitating several 
irrigations where rainfall is light. 

Review of Literature on Irrigation of Alfalfa 

Working under the different conditions encountered in 
various stations of the Canadian and American West, investigators 
of the best number and time of irrigations have arrived at different 
final recommendations. At Brooks, Alberta, Snelson (37) obtained the 
greatest yield of alfalfa from five six-inch irrigations, although 
six four-inch irrigations gave almost the same yield. In Hew Mexico, 
Bloodgood and Curry (6) found ten irrigations necess-ary for maximum 
yields, while further north in the lower Snake River Valley of Idaho, 
Bark (2) reported five irrigations as the general use. Beckett and 
Robertson (5) received maximum yields from four nine-inch irrigations 
on the Bavis Barm, California and another group of workers in the 
same state (l) recommends: that alfalfa planted on very open or imper¬ 
vious soils should be irrigated more than once between cuttings.

Knight and Yardman, (26) in Nevada, secured the greatest 
yields from the maximum application of water, 81 acre-inches per 
acre. Almost as good yields were obtained with 66 inches applied 
in eleven six-inch irrigations. 

Sometime earlier, Knight (24) reported the use of 1Q2 inches 
of water in the season on a gravelly soil, while on a sandy clay soil 
with clay subsoil, 36 inches was sufficient for alfalfa. In the same 
Bulletin, he reported yields of from 6.06 tons to 6.63 tons of alfalfa 
hay per acre when the crop was irrigated so that the plants were never 
allowed to show signs of needing water, 5.61 to 5.64 ton3 when plants 
showed need of water by dark green colour of foliage before being 
irrigated, and 3.98 to 5.18 tons when plants showed need of water by 
dark green colour and drooping of leaves when irrigated. 

For .Arizona conditions, Smith (36) recommends irrigating 
alfalfa when two-thirds gro?m, but not just after cutting. 

■fidtsoe and Merrill (48) found that it made little difference 
on the yield of alfalfa at the Utah Station whether water was applied 
Just before or Just after cutting the hay crop. Widtsoe (44) con¬ 
siders that it is sufficient under conditions of deep soil and moderate 
evaporation to give the crop one irrigation for each cutting; two or 
three light irrigations for each cutting, he does not think objection¬ 
able. Regarding fall irrigation he states, "Tf fall and winter rain¬ 
fall is insufficient to saturate the soil, fall or winter irrigation, 
especially if the winters are mild and open, has been found quite 
satisfact ory." 

In 1899, King (23) recommended two Irrigations for each crop 
of alfalfa although he states that the usual practice at that time was 
to give but one irrigation for- each crop. Etcheverry (9) states, 

"When the alfalfa has established a welf-developed root system the

common practice on retentive soils is to apply one irrigation either 
before or after cutting." He also says that "The number of irrigations 
per year for alfalfa ranges from four in Montana to twelve in parts 
of California and Arizona." 


Applicatio n of '-/ater to Alfalfa at Lethbridge . 


In these experiments alfalfa received from one to five 
irrigations as shown in the following schedule: 

A. One irrigation: 

1. Previous fall. 

2. Early May• 

3. Plants of first crop 12 inches high. 

4. Ten days before cutting first crop. 

5. Immediately after cutting first crop. 

B. Two irrigations: 

1. Previous fall and first crop 12 inches high. 

2. Previous fall and before cutting first crop. 

3. Previous fall, and after cutting first crop. 

4. Early May and first crop 12 inches high. 

5. Early May and before cutting first crop. 

6. Early May and after cutting first crop. 

C. Three irrigations: 

1. Previous fall, first crop 12 inches high, and 
after cutting first crop. 

2. Early May, first crop 12 inches high, and after 
cut ting first cr op. 

D. four irrigations: 

1. Early May, first crop 12 inches high, after 
cutting first crop, and second crop 12 inches 
high. 

E. Five ir rig at ions: 

1. Previous fall, early May, first crop 12 inches 
high, after cutting first crop, and second 
crop 12 inches high.

Yields of Alfalfa Hay Harvested . 

On the plots reported, two crops of alfalfa hay were 
secured each year. The alfalfa was cut when the plants were from 
one-half to three-fourths in bloom, raked up as it was cut, and 
weighed in the green state. A quantity of the green plants was 
immediately run through a chopper, duplicate two-pound samples of 
the cut material secured, and the dry matter determined by drying 
to constant weight at 100° C. The total dry matter produced on 
each plot was determined and 10 per cent artibrarily added to this 
weight to convert it to a hay equivalent. Several tests made of 
alfalfa hay in the stacks at the Station showed well-cured hay to 
contain approximately 10 per cent of moisture. 

The computed pounds of hay per acre obtained from each 
irrigation treatment for the five years that the t est has been 
under way are shown in Table 10. The five-year average is also

Stage of Plant Growth /hen I rrigat ion V/as 
Most Effective. 

The data in Table 10 show that, where only one irrigation 
was given, the greatest average yield for the five years was obtained 
when this was applied in early May* The yield from a fall irrigation 
was almost as good as the spring irrigation, the difference in yield 
not being significant* Postponing the irrigation until plants were 
12 inches high decreased the average yield about one half ton per 
acre* When the first irrigation was delayed until just before or 
just after the first crop was cut, the average yield was reduced 
almost exactly one ton per acre* The increased yields obtained from 
the earlier irrigations are easily understood and are important in 
formulating an irrigation practice for alfalfa. when the irrigation 
was postponed in the spring until the plants suffered for water, the 
yield of the first cutting of hay was materially reduced. Where 
heavy early May rains are received as was the case in 1923 and 1927, 
early irrigations may not be of benefit but if May is a dry month, 
as it has been in sixteen of the twenty-six years that records are 
available at Lethbridge, a. May irrigation appears to be essential 
if a heavy first cutting is to be expected. This is in harmony with 
the results obtained by Knight (24) in ITevada, where yields were 
depressed when the plants were allowed to suffer at all for water. 
Irrigation Be fore or hfter Cutti ng. The question of the relative 
merits of irrigating the alfalfa field just before or just after 
cutting the first crop of hay is often discussed. Three separate 
comparisons are possible each year of plots Irrigated before, and plots 
irrigated after cutting. One comparison is of plots, irrigated at 
the cutting stage only, one of plots irrigated in the previous fall 
and at cutting and one in the spring and at cutting. In eg,ch set the

five-year average yield was slightly greater on the plots irrigated 
after cutting than on those irrigated before cutting. These differ¬ 
ences are so small, however, that they are not significant. n 
examination of the yields for the individual years shows a higher 
yield for each set of plots irrigated after cutting in three years 
and a higher yield for the irrigations before cutting in tv/o years. 
The results of this experiment seem to agree with the findings of 
Widtsoe and Merrill (48) - that it makes little difference in yield 
whether irrigations are applied just before or just after cutting. 
Fall versus Spring Irrigation . Five comparisons betv/een fall and 
spring irrigations are shown in Table 10, one with only the fall 
irrigation, three with one additional irrigation and one with two 
additional irrigations. The five-year average production was greater 
on each set of plots irrigated in the: spring than on those irrigated 
in the fall. The only difference of yield great enough and constant 
enough from year to year to be significant, was on the plots receiv¬ 
ing but one irrigation. The five-year average yield of hay on the 
plots receiving one irrigation in the spring was 300 pounds more than 
the yields on the plots irrigated only in the fall. ITot only was the 
average yield greater, but in four years out of five, the yield was 
more with spring irrigation. The "wet* year of 1927 was the one 
year when the plots irrigated only in the fall produced more hay than 
those irrigated in the spring. 

The results of these tests, and especially the observed 
condition of the crops as they were growing, and the soil moisture 
studies, indicate that a fall irrigation is not as effective in 
producing a crop of hay the following year as is an irrigation in 
the spring. This seems t o be due to there being less water available 
for the crop from a fall irrigation, due to losses between the time

when the water is applied in the fall and when growth starts in 
the spring. 

When additional water was applied during the growing 
season before plant growth was checked by a need of water, the 
yields obtained were as high on the fall-irrigated plots as on 
those irrigated in the spring. While an early spring irrigation 
gave better results than a fall irrigation, if the spring irriga¬ 
tion was postponed until the plants were 12 inches high, the fall 
irrigation was superior. 

The results of these tests: would suggest the advisability 
of irrigating enough of the alfalfa field in the fall so that the 

balance could be covered with water in the first half of May. 

dumber of Irrigations Required for Alfalfa . 

Four irrigations gave the highest five-year average yield 
of alfalfa, followed closely, even in the dry years, by three 
irrigations, one applied in early May, another when the plants were 
12 inches high, and the third immediately after the first crop was 
harvested. In the drier years, two irrigations were not enough to 
produce hea.vy yields, but in the seasons of medium rainfall, two 
were sufficient. 

Suggested Irrigation Practice for Alfalfa . 

All of the alfalfa: should be irrigated in the fall or early 

May of the following spring, unless an unusually wet fall or wet 

spring is experienced. If May Is dry, another supplication of water 
when the crop is about 12 inches high is desirable. If the season 
continues dry, a third application of water before or just after 
cutting may be required.

Chapter IV 

IRRIGATION OR POTATOES . 

Light to medium-textured, well-drained soils in districts 
suitable for irrigation are usually admirably adapted to the growth 
of potatoes. Most of the irrigated lands of Alberta will produce 
good crops of potatoes; in fact it is doubtful if there is an area 
anywhere on the continent where better yields can be secured or 
potatoes of higher quality grown. 

Review of Literature on Irrigation of Potatoes 

With one or two exceptions, the findings of investigators 
have been that potatoes require several irrigations, especially after 
tubers start to form on the stolons of the plants. 

The opinions of two Alberta investigators are available 
on the best irrigation practice for potatoes. Pour three-inch 
irrigations at Brooks and five three-inch irrigations at Ronalane 
produced the maximum yields of potatoes, according to Snelson (37). 
Pairfield’s recommendation (ll) is that: *Tf possible the first 
irrigation should not only be very light, but it should not be 
given until the small potatoes are set and are perhaps the size of 
peas. This stage is usually about the time the first blooms appear." 

Irrigation workers in the United States have recommended 
a wide variance of irrigation practice for potatoes. Pour reports 
from Utah are available. Widtsoe and Her rill (48) secured the best 
yields with six irrigations, but four heavier irrigations gave 
almost as good a yield, fldtsoe (45) states: '’Potatoes need a good 

supply of water in the soil at planting time . Little water 

is needed by potatoes during the first period of growth, providing 
there is a plentiful supply in the soil at the time of planting .

It is seldom advisable to irrigate oftener than every two weeks, 
and every three or four weeks frequently gives satisfactory results* 
Irrigation should cease about the middle of Vugust, leaving about 
sixty days for the ripening of the potatoes.” Working with Stewart 
Widtsoe (49) found the precentage of water in the tubers little if 
any affected by the application of too much water. Two other 
experimentalists in this state, Harris and Pittman (17) found the 
practice of watering potatoes before they were up so ruinous that 
it was dropped from their tests. They also found, that applying all 
the water very early or very late in the season was undesirable. 

Their best yields were obtained from moderate irrigations given at 
regular intervals of 7 and 14 days during the dry summer season, 
beginning when the plants were six inches high and discontinuing 
about a month before harvest. 

Investigators in other western states advance different 
counsels. In Hew Mexico, Bloodgood and Gurry (6) obtained the 
highest yields from four five-inch irrigations distributed over a 
period of three months. Bark (4) found five or six irrigations 
necessary for maximum yields in Southern Idaho, while in Nevada, 

Knight and Hardman (26) obtained the highest yields- from five three- 
inch irrigations given when the plants showed a tendency to wilt 
or before wilting was noticeable. Working as early as 1892, Buffum 
(7) explained the effect of early irrigation of pot toes in 
Wyoming thus 2 "When irrigated immediately before setting, a greater 
number of potatoes will be formed than the plant can properly 
esupport, few of them becoming large enough for market. 'Then the 
tabers are allowed to form first and irrigated afterwards, fewer 
potatoes will form in each hill but a larger crop of marketable 
potatoes is the result.^ Btcheverry (9), generalizing on the number 
of irrigations required for potatoes, says, "The number of irrigations

will vary from two to four for ordinary sandy loan, and from four 
to six light irrigations for a porous sandy soil or shallow soil.'* 


Application of "7ater to Potatoes at Lethbridge 

In these experiments, potatoes received from one to six 
irrigations at different stages of plant growth, as shown in the 
following schedule: 

A* One irrigation: 

1. Previous fall. 

2. Plant s half-grown. 

3. Plants starting to "bloom. 

4. Plaints in full-bloom. 

5. Ten days after full-bloom. 

B. Two irrigations: 

1. Previous fall and starting to bloom. 

2. Previous fall and full-bloom. 

3. Starting to bloom and full-bloom. 

4. Full-bloom and ten days later. 

C. Three irrigations: 

1. Starting to bloom and. at intervals of 
ten days. 

2 . Starting to bloom and at intervals of 
twenty days. 

P. Four irrigations: 

1. Plants half-grown, starting to bloom, 
and at intervals of ten days. 

2 . Starting to bloom and at intervals of 
ten days. 

F. Five irrigations: 

1. Starting to bloom and at intervals of 
ten days. 

F. Six irrigations: 

1. Starting to bloom and at intervals of 
ten days. 

One series of plots was left unirrigated as a check. 
Yields of Potatoes 

The potatoes were harvested early in October and were 
well ripened at the time of harvest, ill! potatoes badly misshapen 
and those weighing under approximately three ounces were classed

as unmarketable. The marketable and unmarketable tubers were weighed 
separately. 

In Table 11 is shown the total yield of marketable and un¬ 
marketable tubers obtained from each irrigation treatment for the 
five years of 1923 to 1927. Table 12 Contains the yield data of 
marketable potatoes and Table 13 the percentages, of marketable tubers 
in the total yield for the same years. Five-year averages are also 
given in each table.

St age of Plant Growt h ''Then Irrigation 
7/a s Host Effecti ve for Potatoes . 

Fall Irrigation . An irrigation in the previous fall gave results 
about equal to an irrigation applied when the plants were starting 
to bloom and decidedly better than irrigating when the plants were 
but half-grown. 

Then The First And Subsequent Irrigations Gave Best Results . The 
lowest average yield from any plot-series irrigated but once was 
obtained from plots receiving water vjhen the plants were half-grown. 

Of the plots irrigated more than once, those receiving the first 
irrigation when the plants were half-grown gave the smallest yield. 

The lower yields from both sets of the earlier-irrigated plots 
support the statements of Fairfield (ll) and Buffum (7), that it is 
not advisable to irrigate potatoes before the tubers are set, (about 
the starting-bloom stage). Buffum suggests that earlier irrigations 
are undesirable because the application of water before the setting 
of the tuber a, stimulates the urines to set more tubers than they can 
support. This results in a smaller number of large potatoes and 
an increased number of small potatoes. This view is not supported 
by the results of these tests as the percentage of marketable 
potatoes was as high on the earlier-irrigated plots as on those 
receiving the first application of water some time later. 

There was little difference in the total yields when the 
first application of water was made in the starting-bloom, full-bloom, 
or ten days after full-bloom periods except in 1926. In that year 
the potatoes not irrigated until the full-bloom stage or later, were 
so checked in their growth that their yields were from one to two 
tons per acre less than the yields secured from the plots irrigated 
in the starting-bloom period. The percentage of marketable potatoes 
was also less with the later irrigations.

When two irrigations were given, it seemed to make little 
difference in yields whether these were applied in the fall and 
starting-bloom, in the fall and full-bloom, or in the starting-bloom 
and full-bloom periods. The irrigations in the fall and at the full 
bloom periods gave the highest percentage of marketable potatoes. 

With three irrigations, better yields and higher percent¬ 
ages of marketable tubers were secured when the irrigations were 
applied in the starting-bloom stage and at intervals of twenty days 
than when applied in the starting-bloom stage and at intervals of 
ten days. 


lumber of Irrigations Required for Potatoes 

Two irrigations gave a yield of about one ton per acre 
more marketable potatoes than was secured from one irrigation. 

Three irrigations - the first in the starting-bloom period, and 
the others at intervals of twenty days - gave a yield of one-half 
ton per acre more than was secured with two irrigations. 

The highest total yield of marketable and unmarketable 
potatoes was secured from five irrigations. The yield of marketable 
potatoes was but little better, however, than from three irrigations 
Six irrigations gave a lower yield than five. 

Relation of Irrigation Practice to Percentage 
of M arketable Pota.t oes . 

It is evident from the data in Table 13 that the lowest 
five-year average percentage of marketable potatoes was on the 
plots receiving no irrigation. The next lowest was with three 
irrigations at ten-day intervals. The low average for the three 
irrigations is due almost entirely to the abnormally low percentage 
of marketable potatoes on these plots in 1927, a condition for which 
no explanation is apparent.

There is a uniformly higher percentage of marketable 
potatoes with one or two irrigations than with three or more. 

Stated conversely, the greater number of irrigations seems to 
have produced more small potatoes. 

Effec t of Irrigation Treatment on Quality of 
Potatoes « 

Some prejudice has existed in the minds of many people 
against potatoes grown on irrigated land, as it is thought that the 
application of water has a tendency to increase the water content 
of the potatoes and make them "soggy'*. As already quoted, Tidtsoe 
and Stewart (.49) found that the water content of ripe potatoes was 
not increased by applying too much water. 

In 1924 and 1925, the Department of Household Economics 
of the University of Alberta,- under the direction of Kiss liable 
Patrick, co-operated in the experiment with potatoes by making 
laboratory and cooking tests of samples of uniform tubers of medium 
size from each irrigation treatment. Table 14 contains the quality 
scores of the potatoes submitted for tests for the two years as 
reported by Kiss Patrick. In 1924, only one sample was sent from 
the duplicate plots receiving the same treatment, but in 1925, tests 
were made of potatoes from each plot. The two scores shown for each 
treatment in 1925 are for the duplicate plots#

There was no uniformity of quality for the same treatment 
in different years nor for duplicate treatments in the same year, 
(Table 14)* liar was there any uniform improvement in quality when 
the number of irrigations was increased or decreased. About the 
only inference that could be drawn from these data was that the 
irrigation treatment did not affect the reported quality factors 
sufficiently to overcome individual differences in the tubers. 

In addition to the quality tests made at the University 
of Alberta, potatoes of uniform appearance from various irrigation 
treatments were numbered and given to families residing on the 
Lethbridge Station. Steaming,,boiling and baking tests were made 
by the housewives of these families. Their reports agreed with the 
laboratory tests reported - that the irrigation treatment had not 
affected the quality of the potatoes to a noticeable extent. 

Each year at harvest the tubers were carefully observed 
for scab, rhizoctonia sclerotia, misshapen potatoes, secondary 
growths, and other observable characters that might affect the 
quality of the potatoes. As only certified andtreated seed were 
used, and as the potatoes were planted each year on land that had 
never before produced a crop of potatoes, they were comparatively 
free from scab or rhizoctonia sclerotia, but there was no apparent 
difference in the disease effects on the crops of various irrigation 
treatments. 

Some second -growths, resulting in "knotty* potatoes, were 
observed in the drier years when the first irrigation was delayed 
until ten days after full bloom. This condition appeared to have 
been caused by the potatoes starting to ripen due to lack of water 
and then when the water was applied, sprouting into new growths 
at the eves of the paatially ripened tubers.

Another treatment- that had a noticeable effect on the 
appearance of the potatoes was the application of an excessive 
number of irrigations. 'here more than four irrigations were 
applied, the lenticels became enlarged, forming white spots on 
the shins of many of the tubers. This condition was apparent on 
the plots receiving as few as four irrigations in the wet season 
of 1927. 

Suggested Irrigation P ractice for Potatoes 

These experiments would indicate that a good crop of 
potatoes can usually be raised on fertile, medium-textured soils 
without irrigation during the growing season, if the land has been 
irrigated the previous fall. The yields were increased in the 
drier years, however, by irrigating again soon after the plants 
started to bloom and by giving two more irrigations at intervals 
of twenty days. 

It does not appear to be a good practice to irrigate 
before the plants start to bloom unless the soil is so dry as to 
retard growth.

Chapter V. 

IRRIGATION of sugar beets . 

The Canadian Sugar Factories, Ltd., erected a factory for 
the refining of beet sugar at Raymond, Alberta, in 1925, so sugar 
beets were included in the irrigation tests that year. 

Review of Literature 

The sugar beet has become an important crop in most of 
the irrigated sections of the United States, and its irrigation lias 
been the subject of investigations in a number of localities. 

Front, different parts of the irrigated state of Utah come 
a number of recommended practices. Widtsoe and Merrill (48) found, 
in tests at the Utah Station, that the greater the number of 
irrigations up to six, the larger were the yields of sugar beets. 

When six-inch irrigations were applied bi-monthly to a total of six, 
the best jrields were secured. In the Sevier Valley, Utah, which 
has an average annual precipitation of only 8.34 inches, Israelson 
and Windsor (19) reported that four or five irrigations were necessary 
Harris, (14) from five years’ experiments in Utah, found that where 
but one irrigation was given, it was most effective when applied at 
the time the beets averaged about two inches in diameter. When the 
water was applied at the proper time, two or three irrigations of five 
inches each gave as good results as where more water was applied. 
Maximum yields were secured from three irrigations applied just 
before thinning, when the beets averaged two inches in diameter, and 
when they were nearly ripe. The yields were almost as good when 
the irrigation before thinning was not given. 

The various counsels of other experimentalists originate 
in the different conditions experienced in other western states.

Working in Oregon, Powers (32) obtained maximum yields with one 
irrigation in three years out of five. In the other two years, two 
irrigations gave the best yields. In Nevada, ’.night and Hardman (26) 
obtained the best yields.from six three-inch irrigations. Roeding 
(34), a Colorado worker, secured higher yield per acre from 11.3 
inches of water applied in two irrigations than from larger quantities 
in three or four irrigations. 

Knorr (27) found that the yield of sugar beets on land 
receiving a fall irrigation and three growing season irrigations was 
1.6 tons greater than when the land received the three summer irri¬ 
gations without an application of water in the fall. He secured 
best results when the beets were so irrigated as to keep the plant 
in g&od condition from the time of thinning to about three weeks 
before harvest. 

ITuckols and Currier, (31), in recommending an irrigation 
practice for the Billings region of Montana, state that ’’Beets 
should not be irrigated until they are too large to cultivate and 
the leaves have spread out so that they will cover the ground and 
shade it, so that the heavy crusts will not form in the furrows where 
the water has run. These beets are usually ready to irrigate about 
July 15th to 25th.” After irrigation is begun, they state that it 
is usually necessary to continue to irrigate every 10 to 20 days 
from the time of the first irrigation until about the first of 
September. 

Application of Mate r to Sugar Beets at L ethbridge 

5i*om one to five irrigations were applied to sugar- beets 
in these experiments, as shown in the following schedule:

Yield of Bee-t s 

The germination of the beets was very poor in 1925, result¬ 
ing in inferior stands, so the yields for that year are not reported 
in Table 15 where the yields for the years 1926 and 1927, and the 
average for the two years are presented.

As but two years 1 yield data are available for sugar beets, 
very little can be said of the effects of the irrigation treatment 
on the yield of beets. It was quite evident, ho;/ever, in observing 
the crop of 1925 that the beets not irrigated until after July 24th, 
(which was six weelcs after thinning) were seriously injured by drouth. 
In 1926, following the wet fall of 1925, an irrigation any time up to 
eight weeks after thinning, prevented the plants from being retarded 
in their growth by lack of water. One irrigation appeared to be all 
that was required in that year. The precipitation of 1927 seemed to 
provide all the water needed by the beets in that year since no 
increases in yields were obtained by irrigating. 

Sugar Content o f Beets . 

The Canadian Sugar Factories Ltd., have kindly co-operated 
in the sugar beet tests by determining the sugar content of beets 
selected at random from each plot. Six beets were secured for sugar 
tests - two large beets, two of medium size, and two small. The 
sugar content data of 1925 are included in Table 16 along with those 
of 1926 and 1927 as the poor stands, which precluded the use of the 
yield data for 1925, may not have influenced the sugar content of the 
beets. Three irrigation treatments are reported for 1925 that are 
not shown for 1926 and 1927. These are plots that were fall-irrigated 
for the crops of 1926 and 1927, but were not fall-irrigated in 1924 
for the 1925 crop. In 1926, samples of beets from the plots irrigated 
the previous fall and those irrigated six weeks after thinning were 
lost in transit to the Sugar Factory so the sugar content data for 
those irrigation treatments in 1926 are not available.

While the data given on the sugar content of beets from 
different irrigations are meagre, there are two interesting features 
connected therewith:. 

1. The beets that were not irrigated in the season of 
1925 until they had started to ’’burn'* were' decidedly low in sugar 
content. 

2. The beets irrigated heavily were high in sugar content 
in all three years. 

It: is thought by some sugar beet experts that the sugar 
content is materially reduced if the beets are allowed to burn and 
are then irrigated. The low sugar content obtained in 1925 from 
beets irrigated after they had been seriously injured by drouth seems 
to corroborate this opinion. This is also supported by the work of 
Harris (14) who obtained the lowest sugar content when water was with¬ 
held from the beets until they were, approaching maturity. He does 
not state whether or not the beets ’’burned w before irrigating, but 
this is suggested by the low yields. 

The high sugar content of beets receiving the greatest 
number of irrigations is in direct opposition to the opinion of many 
farmers who believe that irrigating decreases the sugar content, but 
is in accord with the results obtained by Harris (14).

Chapter VI. 

IRRIGATION OF SUIT FLO VERS 

Sunflowers are only q minor crop under irrigation, and, 
undoubtedly for that reason, very little information is available 
regarding their water requirements, For Montana, Jensen (21) 
recommends irrigating before the plants show signs of wilting. H e 
reports that three irrigations were required for sunflowers at the 
Huntley Experiment Farm in 1918. These were a plied on July 9th, 
August 2nd and August 8th. In 1919, five irrigations were given. 
Knight of Nevada (25) states that sunflowers should be irrigated 
like corn. 


Application of 'later to Sunflowers at Lethbridge . 


In formulating an Irrigation practice for sunflowers, it 
was found impractical to specify a growth stage. The only distin¬ 
guishing growth character was height, and this could not be used as 
a guide after the plants reached a height of six inches, because 
growth was so rapid where conditions were favourable and because it 
varied so much on the plots receiving different treatments. For 
these reasons, definite intervals of time (after the plants were 
six inches high) were specified for the applications of water. The 
following schedule describes the program of irrigations: 

A. One irrigation: 

1. Previous fall. 

2. Plants six inches high. 

3. One week after plants were six inches high. 

4. Two weeks after plants were six inches high. 

B• Two irrigations: 

1. Previous fall and July 15th. 

C. Irrigations at definite intervals, the total number 
dependent on the earliness of the season: 

1. Plants six inches high, and every week until 
August 10th to 15th.

4. Plants six inches high, and every four weeks 

C. until August 10th to 15th. 

5. Plants six inches high, and every three weeks

6 . Plants six inches high, and every three weeks 
until July 5th, 

7. Two weeks after six inches high and every three 
weeks until August 10th to 15th. 

8. 'Two weeks after six ihches high and every three 
weeks until iugust 10th to 15th. 

D, When the crop appeared to be in need of an irrigation. 

One set of plots was left unirrigated as a check. 


Yield of Sunflowers. 


The sunflowers were cut for silage when the seeds were 
partly glazed. The green weights were secured immediately after 
cutting and are reported in Table 17 for the various irrigation 
treatments for the two years of 1923 and 1924, together with the 
two-year average yields. 

The experiments with sunflowers were discontinued after 
the second year as yield, cultural and feeding tests at the Station 
shOYfed that sunflowers were not as good as corn for a silage crop 
on the irrigated lands of Southern Alberta. It became evident, 
therefore, that sunflowers would not be as important a farm crop 
under irrigation as it was thought they would be when the irrigated 
experiment was started.

Pall Irrigation 

In the two years that sunflowers were under test, the best 
yields were obtained from an irrigation in the previous fall and 
another on Jhly 18th. An irrigation in the previous fall without 
the application of wa.ter during the growing season gave the s econd 
largest yield in 1923, but v/as exceeded or equalled in 1924 by all 
the plots irrigated when the plants were six inches high, except those 
receiving water every two weeks or every week. 

Humber of Irrigations Required for S unflowers . 

The poorest yields were secured in both years, from the 
lots irrigated every week. The plots irrigated every two weeks 
were decidedly better than those irrigated every week, but were much 
inferior to the plots receiving water at three-week intervals or 
less frequently. It was very evident, by the appearance of the 
growing crop and the yields secured, that sunflowers could not stand 
an excess of water and that irrigating as often as every two weeks 
wa.s detrimental to the crop. 

It was also noted that yields were reduced if the first 
irrigation was withheld until the plants started to wilt. An 
interesting feature observed, however, was that the sunflower plants, 
although badly wilted, would revive as soon as the water was applied, 
and make satisfactory (though retarded) growth. This is in accord 
with observations made by Hatthews (28) at the Dominion Experimental 
Station, Scott, Saskatchewan, where he noted that the growth of 
sunflowers on dry-iand was very slow in the severest part of the drouth 
period, but that they had the ability to revive with the August rains 
and have always produced a fair crop in the driest yeafs•

Suggested I rrigation Practice for 3unilowe"3 

It appears, from the limited data available,' that fall 
irrigating is a. good practice for sunflowers. If a fall irrigation 
has not been given and if the early spring season is dry, it seems 
advisable to irrigate the crop by the time the plants are six inches 
high. It is doubtful if another irrigation will be required unless 
the season is unusually dry. If the plants show signs of wilting, 
however, they should be irrigated at once.

Chapter VII 
SOIL MOISTURE 

Soil moisture studies were conducted in connection with 
the irrigation investigations, primarily to help determine if 
differences in crop behavior from various irrigation treatments 
were due to water relationships of the soil and plant or to other 
causes* The data and discussions that follow, therefore, are 
concerned principally with these factors. 

The soil moisture data from the sunflower and the sugar 
beet plots are not included, as these experiments have not been 
conducted for a long enough period to secure sufficient observations 
for making satisfactory deductions. 

Review of literature on 3 oil Moisture 

Many investigators have studied the various phases of the 
soil moisture problem, but only the literature that bears directly 
on irrigation is referred to here. 

The only report of 77 ork done under Alberta conditions is that 
of Snelson (31), who found that a silt loam soil had an available 
water-holding capacity of 22.63 inches for a six-foot depth, while 
sand had a water-holding capacity of 8.01 inches for the same depth. 

'Jldtsoe and McLaughlin (46) conducted extensive soil moisture 
studies on a deep loam soil at the Utah Station, sampling the soil to 
a depth of eight feet. Some of their important findings were: 1. The 
maximum amount of water held by the soil under field conditions was 
about 24 per cent (on a dry basis) and the minimum amount was aoou.t 
8 per cent except that the top foot of soil dried out to 5.64 per cent. 
2. Irrigation was needed whenever the soil moisture fell below 12 
per cent, varyin to some extent with different crops. 3. Then a

practical irrigator declared irrigation to bd necessary, the soil 
was found to contain about 13 per cent of water. 4. Different 
crops leave different percentages of ,'ater in the soil at time of 
harvesting. The rate of loss of soil water varies with the age of 
the crop. Less water is used during the early and late periods 
than during the middle one. 

In later experiments in Utah, Israelson and ‘Test (20) 
found that, as a general rule, soils have the capacity to absorb 
from a half to one and a half inches of water to each foot-depth 
of soil that needs moistening, the actual capacity for a given 
soil depending on its texture and structure. They state that 
*sandy or gravelly soils retain the smaller amounts and clay loam 
soils retain the larger amounts.” They also found that uncropped 
plots given 36 inches of water, held one-third inch more per foot 
of soil one day after irrigating than was held by plots receiving 
12 inches of water, also that a plot receiving 24 inches held one- 
fourth. inch more water per foot of soil than the plot receiving 
12 inches of water. Ten days after the irrigations were applied, 
however, each of the plots held the same amount of available water, 
namely about one and a half inches per foot in the upper six feet. 

In California, Adams et al (l) found that the average 
quantity of water retained in the upper six feet of the lighter and 
more permeable soils was .92 inch for each foot-depth of soil, 
whereas the clay soils absorbed an average of only 0.37 inch per foot 
of soil. In the surface foot, however, the light soils retained 1.04 
inches and the heavier soil 1.71 inches. The maximum quantities 
retained per acre-foot of soil per irrigation were 1.02 acre-inches 
for silt loams, with fine sandy subsoils, 0.75 acre-inch for the 
clay loams, and 0.49 acre-inch for the clays.

fcom field tests in Tashington, Thom and Holtz (39) 
concluded that thecfepth to which field crops took moisture was: 
wheat - 9 feet, oats - 8-J- feet, barley - 8 feet, peas - 6 feet, 
millet - 5-§- feet, corn - 5 feet, and beans - 5 feet. They state 
that "crops that took the soil moisture from the greatest depths 
also had the greatest water requirement.’* 

Total Tater Used by Crops or lost by evaporation or 
Peep Percolati on.. 

In the Lethbridge experiments an approximation was made 
of the water used by the crops, together with that lost from the 
soil by evaporation and from the top six feet of soil by downward 
percolation. This approximation was made by determining the amount 
of water in the soil in the spring and at harvest, and measuring the 
water supplied by irrigation and precipitation during the season. 

The summation of the water in the soil in the spring (a), the water 
applied by irrigation (b), and precipitation (c), less the water in 
the soil at harvest fd) r gave the total water (f) used by the crops 
(x), plus that evaporated from the soil (y), and lost by percolation 
below six feet ( z ). 

a. ♦ b * c - d « x * y ♦ z = T. 

Tor convenience, *T tt is called the total water used. 

The data in Table 18 give the total water used for wheat 
following a cultivated crop, in Table 19 for wheat following a wheat 
crop, in Table 20 for alfalfa, and in Table 21 for potatoes. 

Tables 22, 23, 24 and 25 are correlation tables of the 
total water used in relation to yields of the various crops, and 'Charts 
1, 2 and 3 picture this relation graphically. 

In analyzing the data on the water used by the crops, it 
must be remembered that the irrigation water was applied at different 
stages of growth, and that the crop yields were often influenced more

by the time that the water was given than by the total amount available 
for the crop during the year. This is shown in Table 18 by comparing 
the plots irrigated but once during the year. The plots irrigated 
until the flowering stage had practically as much water available for 
plant use as did the plants irrigated at earlier stages of plant 
growth, but the yields were from two to three hundred pounds per acre 
less. The same condition is shown with alfalfa in Table 19. The 
alfalfa not irrigated until just before or just after cutting the 
first crop had about the same water to use as crops irrigated earlier, 
but produced from a half to one ton of hay per acre, less than was pro¬ 
duced with earlier irrigations. With but one irrigation on potatoes, 
water applied when the plants were but half-grown and that applied 
ten days after the full-bloom period seemed to have less crop-produc¬ 
ing power than the water applied in the starting-bloom or full-bloom 
period* 

The frequency distributions of yields with different amounts 

\ 

of water available (Tables 22 to 25) show the same differences in 
yields with similar amounts of available water. 

It is evident, then, that any statement as to the amount 
of water required for crops under irrigation is of little value unless 
the time that the irrigation water is to be applied is specified.

Relation of Hater Used to Yield of ' '- Treat . The date in Tables 18, 

19, 22 and 23 show that several good yields of v/heat were obtained 
with a use of 1.00 to 1.25 acre-feet of water, indicating that when 
water was applied in the proper stages, good yields were obtained 
with this small amount of water which was the equi alent of about 
one irrigation plus the precipitation of the plant season. 'ith 
the Y/heat after a cultivated crop, the individual plot yields that 
fell in the higher yield-classes were greater with each increased 
amount of water used up to 1.75 to 2.00 acre-feet. The v/heat after 
v/heat showed as great a percentage of observations in the higher 
yield-class with 1.00 to 1.25 acre-feet as with the increased amount 
of water. A larger percentage of observations was in the higher 
yield-class, however, with 1.50 to 1.75 feet of water than with 1.25 
to 1.50 feet. 

The course of both curves in ‘Figure 1 show a distinct 
increase in the amount of water used with an increase in the yield to 
about 1750 pounds per acre in wheat following wheat and to about 
2250 pounds in wheat following a cultivated crop. Higher yields 
than these showed but little difference in the total v/ater used to 
produce the crop except on the wheat after cultivated crop where the 
extremely high yields appear to have been secured with a comparatively 
low use of v/ater. There were so few individual observations that fell 
in these high yield-classes, however, that much importance cannot be 
attached to the downward curve for the higher yields. In fact there 
were so. few individual observations in both the extremely high and 
extremely low yield classes of all crops reported that the end portions 
of the various curves may have little signiiicance. 

The wheat-yield curves and the table data show quite clearly 
that from 1.50 feet to 1.70 feet of water were required to produce 


good crops of wheat

As the amount of precipitation that fell between the time 
the crops were planted and harvested varied from six inches to 
fifteen inches, the amount of irrigation water necessary to make 
up the deficiency of the precipitation would he from 0.50 to 1.00 
acre-foot. This would require from one to two 6-inch irrigations 
applied at the proper stages of plant growth. This was the number 
of irrigations found necessary in the irrigation tests. If the 
moisture content of the soil was high from a fall irrigation or 
heavy fall and spring precipitation, some of this soil water would 
be available for plant use and on such soils, less irrigation water 
would be required. If the soil was exceptionally dry in the spring, 
more irrigation water would have to be used as some would be needed 
to bring the soil moisture content up to where the plants could 
readily secure the water they required. 

Relation of " T atsr Used to Yiel d of Mfalfa . The highest five-year 
average yield of alfalfa hay was secured with an average of 3.23 
acre-feet of water (Table 20). The yield was but little less, 
however, with the use of 2.26 or 2.41 acre-feet. There was little 
consistent difference in the yields with a water-use of between 1.45 
and 2.06 feet, the variations apparently being due to the difference 
in the time of irrigating. A few high yields are shown in Table 24 
with a water use of 1.26 to 1.50 feet. The plots recording a water- 
use of 1.76 to 2.00 feet had the highest percentage of individuals 
in the yield-class of from 7001 to 8000‘pounds of hay per acre. fhi 
yield-class was the highest of any having enough observations fallin 
in it to make comparisons worth while. 

The chart of the mean water used for each yield-class of 
alfalfa (fig.2) shows an approximately straight line trend for this 
crop in contrast to the irregular curves of the other crops. The

simultaneous and commensurate increases in water-use and alfalfa 
yield suggest a fairly high positive correlation of these factors. 
There is a tendency for the line to flatten out when more than two 
feet of water are used. The irregular line beyond this point may have 
been due to the unreliability of the few observations in the higher 
yield classes. 

The data in Tables 20 and 24 indicate a water-use of 
alfalfa of 1.75 to 2.25 acre-feet per acre, or 21 to- 27 inches 
which is slightly less than was found necessary by Snelson (37) at 
Brooks, Alberta. With, a rainfall of six to fifteen inches, this 
would require the addition of one to three irrigations applied at 
the proper growth periods. 

Relation of liter Used to Yield o f Potatoes . The five-year average 
yields of marketable potatoes increased with an increase of total 
water used, up to 1.95 acre-feet (Table 21). There was a. slight 
decrease in yields with more than 1.95 feet of water. The average 
yields from 1.45 feat of water were almost as good as from 1.95 feet 
when the crops were irrigated at intervals of twenty days beginning 
in the starting-bloom stage. 

Of the eleven observations of crops grown with 0.76 to 

1.00 feet of water, four (or 36 per cent) gave yields of 21,000 

pounds or more.(T.kble 25). Of twenty-one observations with 1.01 

to 1.25 feet of water, eight (or 38 per cent) had yields above 

21,000 pounds. With 1*26 to 1.50 feet of water, eleven of twenty 

and 

observations (or 56 per cent) had yields above 21,000 pounds/with 
1.50 to 1.75 feet of water, four of twelve observations (or 33 
per cent) were in the yield-classes above 21,000 pounds.

The graph representing the mean water used for each 
yield class, of potatoes (Tig.3) is somewhat irregular but shows 
the general, trend of increased water use with increased yield 
until from 1.30 to 1.50 feet of water were used. Trom that point 
higher yields were obtained without any regular increase of water. 

The data presented in these tables and the chart indicate 
a water use of potatoes of about 1.50 acre-feet per acre. \ crop 
season rainfall varying from six inches to fifteen inches would 
have to be supplemented with from three to twelve inches of 
irrigation water. This would require from one to three four-inch 
irrigations given at such times as to be of maximum benefit to the 
crop. This is in agreement with the number of irrigations found 
necessary in the irrigation tests. 

Depth of Penetration of a 5ix-inch I rrigation 

One of the important reasons for making soil-moisture 
determinations before and after irrigation in these experiments, 
was to note if the amount of water applied (six-acre inches) was 
sufficient to penetrate below the principal feeding-zone of the plant 
roots. Numerous observations made by leaver (40) and others show 
that wheat roots may have a working depth of 3.5 to 4.0 feet, potatoes 
1 to 4 feet, and sugar beets down to 5 or 6 feet. Sunflowers had 
the majority of their root system in the top three feet of soil. 

From the information available, it seemed that the water requirements 
of the plants would be met, if the water penetrated into the soil 
to a. depth of six feet. Observations during the progress of these 
experiments have confirmed this opinion even for alfalfa which is known 
to root much deeper than most field crop plants.

It seemed obvious that the depth to which a given a pli¬ 
cation of water would penetrate would be influenced by the degree 
of wetness of the soil at the time of Irrigating- The data in Tables 
26, 27 and 28 show the relation between the depth to which the water 
penetrated into the soil and the percentage of moisture in the soil 
(dry basis) before irrigating for wheat following a cultivated crop, 
wheat following wheat, and for alfalfa. The potato, sugar beet, and 
sunflower plots are not included, as the amount of ater applied at 
each irrigation varied from three to four inches, thus making too 
few observations available with either depth of a plication to permit 
of reliable comparisons- Table 29 is a combination of Tables 26, 27 
and 28. 

The depth to which water penetrated was determined by 
comparing the percentage of moisture in each foot of the top six 
feet of soil before irrigation and after irrigation. (The method 
of securing soil samples and of making moisture determinations is 
staled in the introduction of this paper.) The soil of the different 
depths secured after irrigation that had appreciably more moisture 
than the soil from the same depth before irrigation was considered to 
have received the additional water from the irrigation or the water 
had penetrated to that depth. In a few instances the samples secured 
after irrigation showed a lower moisture content in the upper feet of 
soil than those secured before irrigation. This was shown at times 
to be due to soil heterogeneity. Some may have been due to mistakes 
in sampling or in making the moisture determinations. The number of 
such observations, however, was not large and they were not used in 
the data reported. The soil samples taken before irrigation were 
secured either on the day before irrigating or on the day that the 
water was applied. Samples after irrigation were obtained from three 
to five days after irrigating.

The percentage of moisture in the soil presented in 
Tables 26, 27 and 29 is the average moisture to the depth to v/hich 
the water percolated as shown by each individual observation. Tor 
example, if the water percolated to a depth of four feet, then the 
moisture percentage shown is the average for the top four feet of 
soil before irrigation. 

A comparison of Tables 26, 27 and 28 reveals but little 
difference in the depth to which a six-inch, irrigation penetrated 
into the soil supporting a crop of alfalfa and into the soil on 
which wheat was grown, since there is as close an agreement between 
the data from the wheat plots and the alfalfa plots as between the 
data from the two series of wheat plots. As the border surrounding 
each plot prevented any of the water applied from draining off the 
plot, the fact that the water soaked into the top foot of the 
uncultivated alfalfa field more slowly than it did into the looser 
top soil of the grain field, did not appear to influence the depth 
to which the water had penetrated by the fourth or fifth day. 

from the data presented in each of these tables, it is 
evident that the water applied soaked more deeply into the moist 
soil than it did into the drier soil. One interesting feature is 
that if the water failed to penetrate to the full six feet in the 
drier soils, it usually went down only three or four feet and seldom 
five feet. This was'especially true in the grain plots. The reason 
for this may have been that the moisture content of the sixth foot 
of soil supporting a crop was usually higher before irrigating than 
the moisture content of the third, fourth and fifth feet. The dryneas 
of these d.epths compared with the sixth foot indicates 


that the

principal working aone of the plant roots was in those foot-depths. 

If the water percolated into the fifth foot, there appears to have 
been some movement into the moist sixth foot, thus increasing the 
moisture content at that depth. 

Only six observations are available where the moisture 
content of the soil before irrigation was seven per cent or less. 

In none of these plots did the water penetrate 3ix feet, only one 
was wet down five feet, two were wet four feet and three were wet 
three feet. Of seventeen observations with a moisture content before 
irrigation of 7.1 to 8.0 per cent, five (or twenty-nine per cent) 
showed an increase of water in the sixth foot. Eleven out of 
forty-eight (or twenty-three per cent) with a moisture content of 
8.1 to 9.0 per cent, twenty-two out of fifty-eight (or thirty- 
eight per cent) with a moisture content of 9.1 to 10.0 per cent and 
thirty-one out of seventy-three (or sixty-one per cent) with a 
moisture content of 11.1 to 12.0 per cent, showed that the water 
applied had penetrated six feet into the soil. The increase in the 
relative number of observations that showed the water to have gone 
down six feet was greater between soils with a moisture content 
of 10.1 to 11.0 and 11.1 to 12.0 than in any other consecutive 
class-groups. It appears that with a soil-moisture content of less 
than eleven per cent, the water moved relatively less freely than 
it did when there was more than eleven per cent of moisture in the 
soil. The increases from 12.1 to 13.0 per cent and from 13.1 to 14.0 
per cent were also important, but not a s significant as the increase 
between the two preceding class-intervals. It seems that when the 
moisture content was at about eleven to fourteen per cent it was at 
what Widtsoe and McLaughlin (46) defined as the point of lento-capill- 
arity or the point above which water may move freely from place to

place under sur'face tension. It is interesting to note that these 
investigators placed this point at between twelve and thirteen per 
cent for the Greenville Loam. 

When the top six feet of soil contained an average of 
more than fourteen per cent, almost all the observations showed the 
water to have penetrated to a depth of at least six feet. It would 
seem, then, that when this type of soil contains less than fourteen 
per cent moisture, a six-inch irrigation is not sufficient to insure 
that the soil will be wet to a depth of six feet, but if the soil 
moisture is above fourteen per cent, a six-inch irrigation appears 
to be ample.

Water Retained in the 'oil from Tall Irrigation 

One of the purposes of these experiments was to test the 
value of a fall irrigation. Since an important factor affecting the 
falue of fall, irrigation is the ability of the soil to retain the 
water until the following crop season, the moisture in the top six 
feet of soil of all fall-irrigated plots was determined four or five 
days after the fall irrigation. Similar moisture determinations were 
again made in the spring so that the difference in the total water 
in the soil in the fall and spring could be noted. This difference 
represents the water that was lost from the top six feet of soil 
less the water added to the soil by precipitation between the time 
of securing the fall and spring samples. 

In Tables 30, 31, 32. and 33 is presented the number of 
feet of water in the six feet of soil-in the fall after irrigating 
and in the. spring before irrigating together with the difference 
between the two. There are two observations shown in most cases for 
each irrigation treatment. These are for duplicate plots. The 
data for the fall of 1926 and the spring of 1927 are not given as 
the heavy fall and spring rains of that period made such data of 
little value.

A total of sixty-eight observations (or differentials 
between fall and spring water content) on the two series of wheat 
plots are reported in Tables 30 and 31. The differences of the 
water contained in the top six feet of soil in the spring from 
that in the soil the previous fall, as shown by the moisture 
determinations, varied from a gain of 0.22 feet to a loss of 0.56 
acre-feet. Of the sixty-eight observations, seven showed a loss 
of 0.40 feet or more, six showed a loss of from 0.30 feet to 0.39 
feet inclusive, eighteen from 0.20 to 0.29, thirteen from 0.10 to 
0.19), and thirteen had a loss under 0.10 feet. Nine wheat plots 
showed a gain in the spring over the fall sampling and two showed 
no change. 

Thera were forty-eone observations on alfalfa (Table 32). 
Of this number, two plots had a water loss in the spring of 0.30 
acre-feet or more. five had a loss of from 0$20 to 0.29 feet 
inclusive, eight from 0.10 to 0.19, and thirteen had a loss of 
less than 0.10 feet of water. Twelve observations showed more 
water in the soil in the spring than in the fall, the greatest 
gain being 0.17 acre-feet per acre. One observation was the 
same in the spring as in the preceding fall. 

Twenty-three observations on potato plots are recorded 
in Table 33. Of these, four showed over 0.30 acre-feet less water 
in the spring than in the previous fall, six showed a loss of from 
0.20 to 0.29 feet inclusive, one a loss of 0.13 feet, six a loss 
of less than 0.10 feet and five had more water in the spirng; than 
in the previous fall. One observation showed no change. 

The greatest loss of water appears to have been from the 
wheat after wheat, the next greatest from the pot-toes, the next 
from wheat after cultivated crop and the last from alfalfa. The

greater loss of water from the wheat plots following wheat than 
from the wheat following a cultivated crop may have been partly 
due to the fact that the wheat after wheat plots were left in 
stubble through the winter 1 each year but one and then spring- 
ploughed while the wheat plots after cultivated crop were cultivated 
in the fall after harvesting the potatoes or other cultivated crop 
and were not -ploughed in the spring before seeding. The potato 
plots went through the fall and winter as wheat stubble the same 
as wheat after wheat, which fact may account for the relatively 
high water loss from those plots. 'The alfalfa plots which showed 
the lowest water loss, had the advantage that they were sampled from 
two to four weeks earlier in the spring than were the wheat plots. 

A comparison of the water loss in the different years 
shows no consistent difference except for the period between the 
fall of 1925 and the spring of 1926. The loss in this period was 
higher than for any of the other three periods in each series of 
plots especially in the wheat after wheat fend the potato plots. 

The only apparent reason for the greater loss in the 1925-1926 
period was that between the time of securing the samples in the fall 
of 1925 and in the spring of 1926 r there was very little precipitation 
(a total of but: 2.51 inches). In addition the winter was unusually 
open and warm, with only nine days that the thermometer went below 
zero. High winds were also experienced. It seems quite evident 
that the dry fall and spring and the windy open winter resulted in 
greater evaporation from the soil than is usual.

GEHEHM CUITEPY 

1. In this thesis axe reported the results of experiments with 
the irrigation of wheat, alfalfa, pot' toes, sugar beets, 

and sunflowers, conducted at the Dominion Experimental Station, 
Lethbridge. The experiments cover a period of from two to six 
years. 

2. One irrigation produced a good crop of wheat in the years of 
average rainfall. In the drier seasons, two applications of 
water were needed. 

3. Irrigating in the fall after harvest for the succeeding year’s 
wheat crop proved to be a'good practice. If a fall irrigation 
was not given, and if the precipitation of May and early June 
was not abnormally high, it was found essential to irrigate 
after the crop was up in the spring-, but before the plants 
were checked in growth by lack of moisture. 

4. Contrary to the usual opinion, irrigating wheat as early as the 
three-leaf stage did not reduce yields on the sandy clay-loam 
soils where the experiments were conducted. 

5. When wheat needed more than one irrigation, good results were 
obtained when the second application was made in the flowering 
stage. 

6. Irrigating wheat in the soft-dough stage did not increase yields, 
but sometimes caused the .grain to lodge.

7. In each year of the experiments, except the "wet." year of 
1927, alfalfa required at least two irrigations to produce 
two &ood crops. It was found necessary to apply one of these 
the previous fall or in early May to give a heavy first 
cutting of hay. X second irrigation was required just before 
or just after cutting the first crop. If May was dry, an 
irrigation when the first crop was about twelve inches high 
increased the yields. 

8. It seem&d to make little difference in the yields of the 
second crop whether the water was applied ten days before or 
Immediately after cutting the first crop. 

9. Irish Gobbler potatoes, irrigated when the plants were half- 
grown, gave lower yields than were secured if the first 
Irrigation was postponed until the plants were starting to 
bloom. In the drier seasons an irrigation in the starting- 
bloom stage and two subsequent irrigations at intervals of 
twenty days was the most satisfactory practice. 

10. There was no consistent difference observable in the cooking 
quality of potatoes receiving different irrigation treatments. 
'.Then the plants were retarded in growth from lack of y/ater and 
then irrigated, second growths, resulting in "knotty* tubers, 
were prevalent. The potatoes receiving five or six irrigations 
produced tubers with enlarged lenticels, but the cooking quality 
did not appear to be impaired. The greater number of irrigations 
produced more small potatoes than one or two irrigations.

11. The limited data secured with sugar "beets suggest that an 
irrigation in the previous fall and one during the growing 
season, from six to eight weeks after thinning would be 
sufficient for that crop in years of average rainfall. 

12. There was no uniform difference in the sugar content of the 
heats receiving different irrigation treatments, except 
that where the beet3 were retarded in their growth from 
drouth and then irrigated, the sugar content was lower than 
where the beets were not injured by lack of water at any 
stage of growth. 

13. Sunflowers gave best yields on fall-irrigated land or with 
a spring irrigation when the plants were about six inches 
high. In the two years of the test with sunflowers, one 
irrigation in the season was sufficient. This crop wilted 
noticeably if the soil became too dry, but revived and pro¬ 
duced fair yields when water was applied. 

14. These experiments indicate that, including the available 
water in the soil at the beginning of the season, wheat 
requires from 1.50 to 1.75 acre-feet of water, alfalfa. 1.75 
to 2.25 acre-feet and potatoes about 1.50 acre-feet to pro¬ 
duce good crops. 

1.5. Soil moisture determinations made of each foot-depth of soil 
to a depth of six feet before and after each irrigation showed 
that a six-inch application of water failed to penetrate into 
the soil to a depth of six feet in more than half the plots 
when the soil moisture content was below eleven per cent at the 
time of irrigation. With a moisture content between eleven and

thirteen per cent, sixty to seventy per cent of the observations 
showed that the water had penetrated to six feet. The water 
applied to almost all of the plots having a soil moisture content 
above thirteen per cent wet down six feet or more. 

16. The loss of water from the soil of fall-irrigated land between 
the time of irrigating in the fall and seeding the following 
spring was noticeable but usually not important, except in 
1925-1926, when the weather between mid-October and early TTay 
was very open, dry and windy. During that period, the water¬ 
less. from a number of plots was about equal to the irrigation 
application of the previous fall.
