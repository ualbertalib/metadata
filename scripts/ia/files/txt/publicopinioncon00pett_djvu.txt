CHAPTER I 


STATEMENT OF PURPOSE 

Tfee purpose of this project is t® stu^y public opinion 
concerning the selection and training of Canadian teachers. 

The selective procedures and criteria discussed in this 
study concern tfee pre-training periodo These selective criteria 
aim primarily to choose from the general population those persons 
who are potentially good teachers for our children« 

Selection is a continuous process» It is ebvious that there 
can be no certification unless certain standards of training have 
been mete The requirements for the appointment to teaching staffs 
operate as selective criteria. There appears to be a movement of 
the more experienced and better trained teachers from the rural areas 
to the larger towns and cities* 

The purpose kero is to make an analysis ©f opinions about 
pro-training selective criteria now in effect in Canada and to make 
certain suggestions concerning them* It is necessary that competent 
individuals—socially, physically, emotionally sjad academically— 
should be guided into the service of the schools* If this is to be 
done, the selective process should have specific objectives* The 
objectives, upon which the descriptive analysis of the questionnaires 
will be centred, are as followss- 

1. To assure the pupils of worthy leadership and friendly 
companionship during their school experience*

CHAPTER II 


PREVIOUS STUDIES. 

Tkree Canadian and ane American study of tke preblem of criteria 
fer select!en and training of teachers have been chosen fer discussiea 
in this chapter. They serve to establish a point ©f view and a sense ©f 
continuity for the study which followso The four studies are concerned 
with criteria for pre-training selection of teachers. Training is 
considered only as it contributes to the professional growth ©r the 
Improvement of personnel# Although this thesis is concerned primarily with 
education in Canada it is interesting to note the similarity ©f the problem 
in tke United States. Both nations are becoming increasingly aware that 
their educational systems are only as good as the people who serve in 
them# 

Dr. W.D. McDougall*s dissertation, "Suggestions for the Improvement 
of Elementary Teacher Education in Alberta," included a section on the 
selection of teachers. At the beginning of his chapter on "Problems 
Leading to Action® the question is asked, "What criteria should be 
established and what procedures should be employed when selecting 
candidates for tke profession ©f teaching?" He deprecates tke present 
policy in Alberta of accepting all the High School graduates who apply 
for admission to tke training school. Many of these are from the lower 
percentile levels of Grade XII5 and once they have found their way to 
the classroom they tend t© remain there. He suggests that positive 
methods be adopted t© seek ©ut the best high school graduates for the 
profession. He quotes Stroh^ ©n procedures in approaching selected 
secondary school students:- 

Margaret Stroh and Others. Better Selection ©f Better Teachers . 1943> 
Part IV, and " Recruiting and Selecting Better Teachers ." N.E.A. Journal, 
33:215-16 (Dec. 1944)’o

4* Assurance by the college that selected candidates will:- 

receiv© a good general education, 

experience a good physical fitness program, 

have socially useful work experience, 

enjoy cultural opportunities in music, art, dramatics, 

have training as leaders ©f yeuth and adult discussion 
groups, 

have opportunities for developing international 
understanding through study of literature, art, music, 
folk-ways, economic patterns and political tenets of 
other peoples, 

have professional placement, adequate supervision, and 
consequent economic security® 

Dr, McDougall suggests further that the records ©f the Examinations 

Branch of the Department ©f Education be used to chart the progress of 

outstanding students. The attention of personnel officials should be 

directed to these students and every ©ffert made to meet the competitien of 

other prefessions for their services. He states this method would 

2 

run counter to the study by Odenweller who recommended that the first 
selection should be based upon personality and from this group the final 
selection be made upon scholarship.

Table I presents data on the relatienskip of academic standing 
to success in practice teaching gathered by Dr* W*D. McDeugall ®f the 
Faculty of Education, University ©f Alberta, during the term 1947-4^* 
Practice teaching marks for various groups ©f students are shown by the 
three quartile scores* It must be noted here that the non-aatriculated 
group are younger students. Five grade Xli subjects make up matriculation 
requirements for the Faculty of Education while matriculation for 
Faculty of Arts requires standing in seven Grade XII subjects* A **B** 
standing in any subject is equivalent to being in the 50tk to 65th 
percentile range, while ”A” and standing is 65-BO and 80-100 
respectively* The results indicate that for the academically better 
prepared student the practice teaching marks are consistently higher* 

The increase is not very high, however, and may be accounted for by the 
increased age of matriculated students* This study shows that an Increase 
in matriculation requirements would have a selective effect* The Arts 
Matriculants received higher practice teaching marks than those who 
entered the Faculty ®f Education under lowered standards*

Henry Bowers, in an address te the Ontari® Educational 
Association, ®n '*The Pre-training Selection ©f Teachers,** ©utliaed the 
study ke had made ©f the development and us® ®f a teaching aptitude test 
at Stratford Woimial School. Teaching ability is difficult t© define and t© 
measure. In the Aptitude Test developed at Stratford the following 
criterion was useds- the ability t® teach lessons in classrooms where 
the problem of control was simplified by the presence ©f the one ©r two 
experts paid to evaluate that ability. 

The value of the Aptitude Test for Elementary School Teachers 
in Training (A Test) is apparent in the three coefficients between 
percentiles gained from A TEST and teaching percentiles« They are 3?ep©rted 
t© be as followss- 0^73 (N 90), 0,»68 (N 85), 0*72 ( 38). Bowers claimed 
further that the coefficient ©f correlation between predicted percentiles 
(obtained from the Aptitude Test) and percentiles in practice-teaching 
after half the lessons were taught was 0.73 - 0.05 ( N® 90 ). The 

coefficient between predicted percentiles and actual percentiles obtained 
in the second half of the lessens was 0*62 - 0.06 ( 90 ). The difference 

between these two coefficients speaks well for the reliability ©f the 
test. 

Bowers makes fiirther remarks with a bearing ©n pre-training 
selection. He states that although Dr. Sandiford^ found a correlation 
coefficient of only 0.35 between practice teaching marks and success in 
the field it does n©t mean that reasonably accurate prediction near the 
extremes ©f the range is impossible. Another aspect ©f selection which ke 
investigated was the relationship ©f I.Q. t® practice teaching marks. He

considered the applicants a highly selected group and found that I,Qa 
had little relationship to practice teaching vdthin the range of thg 
tenth and nintietk decile* However he does comment that if present 
academic standards were lowered it is likely the type of candidates who 
would enter the training school would make I.Q* a significant factor in 
initial selection. His experiments at both extremes of the I.Q* range 
docs prove that those students with I.Q.*s of 125 and up make excellent 
risks for practice teaching while those with I.Q.*s of 101 and less make 
poor risks. 

Academic standing as measured by the position in the High School 
Percentile is another factor Bowers considers in pre-training selection. 

He proved that those students with high relative standing make excellent 
risks for teacher training, and he included this factor in his ATEST. 

- A study on **Tke Rural Teacher, Selection, Training, and In-Service 
Guidance** by R.O. Staples, B.A.D. Paed. was published by the Ryerson 
Press, Toronto in 1947* Dr. Staples reviewed the status of rural education 
in Ontario with special emphasis on the personal qualities and training 
required by the rural teacher. He used the questionnaire method of 
research, and an examination of his tabulation of answers would indicate 
that 200 teachers were included in his sampling. Some of his data was 
derived from answers t® questions which had been discussed by the Ontario 
Farm Forum groups. 

Dr, Staples stated that any programme of selection worthy ©f the 
name will give evidence of an appreciation of the work for which selection 
is being made. It will seek to assess the qualities needed for success 
in the field, and it will not only endeavour t® exclude those who do not 
possess these qualities, but it will seek to attract those who do have them 
abundantly. He found that selective criteria included? (i) a keen mind;

(ii) emotional stability^ (iii) health; (iv) a liking for children; 

(v) an ideal of service; (vi) experience in work; (vii) scholarship; 

(viii) social consciousness; (ix) imagination; (x) a sense of civic 
rosponsibilitjo Staples says that fortunately not one of the above ten 
essentials lies entirely beyond the possibility of standardized measurement, 
examination ©r reasonably reliable report* The principal aM staff of 
the training school, assisted by specially trained experts in psychology, 
rural sociology, and personnel selection might spend muck time in 
assembling information, testing and interviewing candidates, and building 
a complete picture of the personality and background of each student* 

Dr. Staples recommended that the ”permanent” or highest certific¬ 
ate not be granted to teachers early in their career because such 
practice tended te inhibit further professional growth. He records the 
suggestion that the Universities be invited to take over teacher training 
and so integrate it into the national life more thoroughly than the 
Normal Schools seem to have done. 

Evaluation in Teacher Education ^ is part ©f the cooperative 
study ©f teacher education carried on by the Commission on Education which 
was appointed by the American Council of Education. Dr. Maurice E. 

Troyer of the School of Education, Syracuse University and Dr. C. Robert 
Pace, Teachers College, Columbia University organized the material on 
evaluation which was submitted from twenty-nine institutions taking part 
in the cooperative study. The evaluation of initial selection procedures 
was one ©f eight major areas included in their report. A summary of this 
aspect of their report is included here to give some idea of selective 
procedures and the principles upon which they are based. The authors

warm that no single program for the initial selection of students can 

aorvo all institutions equally well* 

Effective selection procedures are based upon a well defined 

concept of the good teacher* Tke Commission on Teacher Education 

2 

attempted to sketch tke broad outlines of suck a concept, 

“••a tke good teacher should possess intelligence, 
breadth of knowledge plus special insights in some 
areas, emotional soundness, integrity, respect for 
personality, understanding ©f tke community, and 
good citizenship. They said further that the good 
teacher would be fond of children and youthj have an 
understanding of hman growth and development, of the 
learning process, and of the techniques ©f evaluation| 
would have a good social philosophy supported by 
conviction and knowledge; would be a good citizen ©f 
the school; would possess scholarship; and would believe 
in the worth ©f his work,** 

Troycr and Pace state further that teachers^ ': colleges have not 
attracted as able students, judged by tests academic aptitude and 
knowledge of school subjects, as have universities and colleges of liberal 
arts® Tke development of selective admissions programs is becoming 
increasingly more important because of this situation. The authors 
included in their study examples of selection procedures in effect in the 
United States and evaluated tke effectiveness ©f each, A brief summary 
of their findings about two of these is presented here. 

In tke New York State-Supported Institutions selection is made 
at the freshman level. The number of students admitted is determined by the 
capacity of each of the eleven teacher training colleges and by the 
qualifications of the applicants. Tke selection committee is composed ©f 
two representatives ©f the state department of education and ©ne 
representative from each training college® In April applicants may appear

Teacher Education. (Washington: American Council on Education, 1944)*

at ajiy «f thirty examination centres in the state t® write a psycholegical 
examination, a reading and English examination, and t© complete a personal 
inventory f©rm» The State Department ®f Education obtains a personality 
and character rating from each applicant's last High Sck®©l principal* 

The applicant appears at the college ©f kis choice f©r a thorough health 
examination, a speech test, and a personal interview with a faculty 
member* All factors are then given weighted scores and combined into a 
single score which determines the candidate's eligibility and priority 
for entrance to the teacher training institution* In 1940, about 55% ©f 
the applicants were accepted. The reasons f©r failure to be admitted were 
classified as academic deficiency 67^, perssnal qualities IB^, physical 
disability 7^, and ©tkers B%* At the College ©f Education, Wayne 
University selection is made at the Junior level* The major advantages 
of delaying selection until the end ©f the second year are that the 
student has accumulated a university record and is capable of making 
a more mature vocational choice* The admission procedure at Wayne attempts 
to sample a large variety of qualities required by a successful teacher* 
The responsibility of completing the procedure rests with the student* 

Each applicant presents the following evidence for evaluation:** 

1, Academic Aptitude 

American Council on Education Psychological Examination* 

2* A cademic Achievement 

Cooperative Test in English, General Culture and

From four public sckool principals# 

From an officer ©f a social service agency# 

The student is encouraged t® appraise the data collected and 

t® assess whether he really feels he should proceed t© teacher 

training# The data is summarized in the f©m of a profile chart f©r each 

applicant and becemes the basis f©r deciding kis eligibility f®r 

entrance to the Sck©®l ©f Education# It is interesting t® note that 

in 1940 only 43^ S67 applicants were judged likely to become 

certificated teachers# 

General Conclusions from Previous Studies, 
lo Unselected admission to training schools attracts candidates from the 
lower strata ©f academic ability. 

2, There is need for some means ©f measuring the aspects of personality 
that have a bearing on teaching success. 

36 Guidance departments in secondary schools could do much in the 
selecting of suitable teacher candidates. 

4* University should assume the responsibility for teacher training. 

5« Systems ©f selective admission are feasible and do increase the 
service and prestige of the teaching profession.

CHAPTER III 

RESEARCH PROCEDURES AND EXPERII1ENTAL DESIGN 

Questionnaire Procedure. 

Tfee main source ©f evidence, up©n which the conclusions ©f 
this study are based, was the analysis ©f questionnaires* This method 
•f research was the only possible one t® use under the circumstances* 

The committee were given a short period ©f tioie in which to gather and 
analyze the information* Expense had t® be kept to a mlnimuiria The 
work was located in the Education Building at the University of Alberta, 
Several meetings ©f the sub-committee were held in October, 

1947| f®r the purpose of discussing the over-all problem presented by 
the Committee of the Canadian Education Association. The work was 
subdivided int® the topics indicated in the Introduction. Each 
committee member made a preliminary study ©f his field and then compiled 
lists ©f questions which he felt would sample the opinions ©f selected 
groups about his topic. There was considerable overlapping in the 
first lists of questions. Many meetings ©f the sub-committee as a whole 
were necessary t© g© over the lists t© select each question f©r 
inclusion in particular questionnaires. The Christmas holidays were 
almost upon us before we passed the lists t© Dean Ls-Zerte for final 
revision and mimeegrapking and mailing. 

The questionnaires were distributed t© selected groups by 
the Provincial Departments ©f Educati©n, the various Teachers* 
Associations in Canada, and the Canadian Education Association Committee, 
The quantitative data about the questionnaires are shown in Table II.

About the middle of January sufficient returns in each series were 
©n hand to begin the work of tabulation. The question, in many eases, 
determined the form of the tabulation and summary. The sub-committee as 
a whole worked at tabulating the questionnaires. Many ©f the tables shown 
in tkis thesis are based upon summaries ®f open questions. Opinions 
obtained from this type of question were coalesced by writing ©ut the 
answers given in a long list and thus obtaining a frequency rating ®f 
replies. Classification was the result of the tabulator's interpretation 
of the actual replies. Questionnaires Series T, and G3 (French) are not 
considered in tkis study.

Tke quostiennaires which supply m©st ©f the evidence f®r 
this study are the F.series and the G. series. An estimate ©f hew 
well the F series represent the teachers in training can be had frero 
the fact that 685 replies were received fr®m the 7833 in training 
in 1947-4S, The distributien, by pr©vinces, of these replies is shown 
in many of the tables which were compiled from the F series. Many 
facts about the sample of the teaching population are inherent in the 
tables which were compiled from the G series. A summary of questions 
10 and 11 reveals that 317 of these teachers were from rural areas and 
203 were from urban areas# Chapter IV contains other descriptive data, 
upon which the reader may base his estimate ©f the validity of the 
evidence obtained in this study# 

Design of the Study. 

The study is based upon summaries of ©pinions about pre¬ 
service selective criteria, and about teacher training# These summaries 
constitute the content of the tables which appear throughout this work# 
The opinions, of three groups, as expressed through the questionnaires, 
make up the divisions of the study# These groups are the teachers in 
training, the teachers in service, and the general public# The tables, 
which are the research data., are included fallowing a discussion of the 
contribution of each particular table to the general theme. 

A complete set of the questionnaires used in the research 
are to be found, as an appendix, in the thesis ©n Supply and Demand by 
W#T# Mel Fowler#

CHAPTER IV 

TEACHERS IN TRAINING. 

The ebject ®f this chapter is t® gr®up the sumixaries ©f the 
questions in the F series together iritk other related material int® a 
description of the teacher candidates new in training in Cajaada# This 
should offer information from which inferences about present selection 
procedures and training criteria may be drawn. 

The range of academic requirements for teacher training is 
shewn by provinces in Table III, It is neted that 1642, or 20^ ef the 8000 
candidates have academic standing higher than Grade XII, The 
relatively unselective na-bure ©f admissions t® teacher training 
institutions in Canada is indicated by a survey ©f criteria^ ether than 
academic. In British Colxnnbia verification ©f age and freedom from obvious 
speech and language defects are necessary. Alberta and Saskatchewan 
demand verification of age and good health, Manitoba places admission 
«n a more selective basis. Personal interviews with the Committee on 
Selection from the Department of Education and with a staff member of 
the Provincial Normal School are parts of the procedure. There, also, 
the scores from the Otis Intelligence Test and the Iowa Reading 
Comprehension Test, as well as the results ©f medical and dental examinat¬ 
ions are considered as admission criteria for prospective teachers.

I» ORtari# evidence of age, geod health, good character and Canadian 
citizenship are considered in addition to academic status* In 
Canada, n© Province has made outstanding progress in the establishing 
of selective admission t® teacher training institutions. 

Enrolment in Relation t© Need. 

Table III indicates that ©ver the ten year period 1937*^47 
the average annual number of teacher trainees was 6590* The actual 
enrolment, January 194^, is given by Table IV t© be 7833. The present 
teacher shortage is 7276 teachers according to Table V • Departments of 
Education estimate that an annual enrolment ©f 10,507 students is 
necessary t© make good the existing shortage in three years* This is 
apparent from a study of Table IV o This means that about 2600 additional 
stud.ents must be trained each year for three years. This estimate is 
conservative because it does not take into consideration the 10$ rate 
of turnover in the teaching population, or the increasing immigration 
population* Table IV also indicates the number by which the annual enrolment 
of prospective teachers must be increased in each province, except Alberta, 
for each of the next three years. 

Personal Qualities. 

The data from question 1 ©f Series F gives the following 
distribution ©f ages for 658 t«achers-in-training in Canada.

Data an the ages ef 863 students in the Faculty of Education, 

University of Alberta in 1947-48 shew a median age of 22o9 years* 

Table XI, page 30 , shows the following division according to 

sox, among 548 prospective teachers: 

Mai© 237 or 43*2^ 

Female 311 or 5608 ^ 

It is difficult to assess how representative this sampling 
is of the whole student population* With four provinces reporting we

The national background of 3,515 student teachers in seven 
provinces was given by the principals ©f teacher training schools* In 
Table VI, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba are taken as one regional 
unit as are also Ontario, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island* F©r 
each ©f the three regional units, the table gives: 

(a) the number of student teachers of each nationality. 

(b) the 1941 population of each nationality (Canada Year Book, 1945, 

pp,. 105-106), 

(c) The number of teachers ©f each nationality per 10,000 total 
population* 

In region #3 there is little variation in the teacher population 
ratio but in regions #1 and #2 the variation is quite marked. In all 
regions the Anglo-Saxon and French representation Varies only from 4^ to 
6^. In region #1 the Anglo-Saxon representation is approximately 6^ while

the Austrian, Belgian, Czech-Slovak, Italian, and Netherlands each 
have a representation of approximately 11%» In region #2 the 
Anglo-Saxon representation is again 6% while the Austrian, Russian, 
Ukrainian personnel representations each show about 11^» There is 
evidence that fully one-half the 197 “Canadians” are of this group. 

There seems t© be little doubt that Central and Eastern 
European groups are taking advantage of the opportunity to train as 
teachers. For them the teaching profession offers social and economic 
advancement. Perhaps this point will become apparent again when the 
s©cie-ec©n®ffiic status ©f our student teachers is considered. This 
thesis implies no racial discrimination in the selection of teacher 
candidates. In the interests of educational standards, particularly 
in the field of English all candidates should possess the ability 
t© speak well. 

Table VII is a summary of the data ©n the general 
intelligence of teacher trainees in six provinces. For the students 
of Group I on the table, scores on the Otis Self-Administering 
Test ©f Mental Ability are available. For Group II the particular 
test on which scores were obtained was not named. For both groups 
the average I.Q. is approximately 110.

A Comparison of the Mental Ability ©f Education 
Students with that of Students in Other Faculties. 

Psychological test scores on the Tkurstone Psychological 
Examination, American Council on Education, 1945 Edition, are 
available for 1,538 freshmen wh© enrolled in various faculties and 
schools of the UnivervSity of Alberta in September, 1945 and January, 

1946 a Table IX gives the distribution of scores for 1,136 civilian and 
war veteran students who registered in twelve different faculties and 
schools in September 1945<» Table X presents similar data for 402 
student veterans wh© registered in Agriculture, Arts and Science, 
Education and Engineering in January 1946. At the foot ©f each table 
are given the decile scores of each group of students. All students 
except those whose scores are given in Column I of Table IX were matricul¬ 
ants | those referred to in Colunin I had not completed matriculation. 

Matriculated students registered in Education (Table IX, 

Column 6) are relatively high in ability. The median score for the 
group is exceeded by that of only two faculties or schools. It is 
higher than that of students in eight other groups. The median score 
of the January class in Education (Table X, column 3) is equal to that 
©f the September class in Education; it is also equal to the median score 
for the total January group.

Relationship ®f Lew Entrance Requirements te Mental Ability ef 

Candidate. 

Table IX Celumn 1 gives the Tfeurstene scores of a group ©f 
226 aen-matriculated Educatien students who registered in the ©ne-year 
program in candidacy fer the Junior Elementary and Intermediate Sckeel 
Certificate* Few of the students in this group had completed Grade XII| 
applicants with 85 high school credits were admitted as candidates 
for temporary certification. Over fifty percent ©f this group have 
scores below the first decile score ©f students in the B, Ed. program. 
(Column 6). Over ninety percent ©f them have scores less than the 
third decile of the students registered in the Faculty ©f Applied Science<* 

Apparently the shorter programs ®f training attract students 
who are relatively low in ability. Attempts to solve the teacher shortage 
by lewering standards bring int® the teaching profession students ©f low 
ability. It should be noted also that the students whose scores are 
tabulated in Celumn 6 ©f the table registered for programs ©f training 
varying in length from tw© years to four years at a time when teachers* 
salaries were far below those being paid t©day. 

The inference from the above data is that the mere capable 
students select the more worthwhile training programs and that low 
entrance requirements and short training programs are attractive t® 
less able students. Registrants in the Junior Elementary and Intermediate 
School Certificate program, in Alberta, were deficient not in high 
school credits alone but in ability to d® successful work in any 
academic or professional program.

S«ci©-Economic Status of Student Teachers. 

Table XI skews frem which occupatienal groups in society 
eur student teachers come. It comprises a summary of data about the 
©ecupatiens ©f the parents and older siblings of 54^ students in all 
provinces except Prince Edward Island. The column headings show the 
occupations of the parents. The vertical scale in the first column from 
0 to 7 indicates the occupations of the older siblings. The zero 
indicates n© information about the siblings and each number from 1 to 
7 corresponds to the occupational classification stated in the column 
headings i,e, 1 means the siblings are in the professions, 2 means the 
siblings are teachers, 3 means the siblings are business people. Each 
vertical section gives the number of male and female student teachers 
whose parent is in the classification shown by the column heading and 
whose older siblings are in a classification shown by the row number. 
The facts shown by the table ares- 

(1) The agricultural and labor occupations provided 60^ of the students 
in this group, 

(2) The older siblings tend to follow the parent*s occupation, 

(3) The other professions tend t® attract many of the older 
siblings, 

(4) Relatively few of the older siblings are teachers. 

The data contained in Table XII was obtained from the replies 
to the questionnaire sent t© Departments of Education in November, 1947. 
Nova Scotia is the only province not reporting. The last column shows 
the percentage of student teachers by which each of eleven occupational 
groups was represented in 1947-4^.

Fr®m the unskilled labor and personal service groups 
Canada recruited 10^ of her teachers, from the professions 1*1%, 
from skilled labor 10.2^ and from agriculture 31%• 

For six provinces, data were available for nearly all teachers 
in training in 1947-4^. Available data appeared to be quite reliable 
from “agricultirre,” **pr©fessi©nal,** and ^‘personal service** groups* The 
number of student teachers per 10,000 ©f male population, 14 years and 
over, in each ©f these three occupations is shown in Table XIII* Based 
upon this standard the comparisons appear tc be more significant. 

From Tables XII and XIII it is evident (a) that over 50^ of 
Canada's student teachers come from h®mes where the general level of 
post-secondary school education is relatively lew, and (b) that, while 
©n a population basis the professions provide more than their quota 
©f student teachers, they give to the teaching profession fewer than ^ 
of its personnel* 

The previous work experience should be some indication of 
the occupational background ©f the student teachers* Table XIV 
offers ijaf©rmati®R in this regard f®r 661 student teachers in eight 
provinces. It is noted that only 35>% ®f them had been empleycd f©r a 
period exceeding six months prior to teacher training, and that U(J% had 
had n© previous work experience. 61% ®f those, wh© had been employed 
f©r a period in excess of six months, had had experience in the skilled 
labour, clerical, unskilled labour and agricultural occupations. 

Considering that the median age of student teachers is about 
twenty one year»s it is not suprising that s© few have had an opportunity 
t© gain experience in another field before entering teacher training. 

It is interesting t© note that 81 of this group were supervisors ©r 
temporary teachers, wh© had some experience in the schools and are n©w

qualifying to become teachers. 

One might conclude that, for the group, which had more 
than six months employment in the various fields shown, the teaching 
profession offered greater social and economic advancement. 

The type of High School last attended is some indication of 
the socio-economic background ©f the student teacher. Table VI shows 
that out of 649 student teachers, 306 attended city high schoels for 
their final year 5 and 343 attended town or rural high schools# 

How representative of the general student population this distribution 
is would be difficult t© say,Since most of our secondary schools are 
located in the larger centres ©f population the findings shown above 
appear t® be reliable#

If it can be assumed that the secondary schools in the towns 
and cities provide a better education than suck schools in the villages 
and rural areas, then we can conclude that o\xr student teachers are 
obtaining a relatively high level of high school training. If we consider 
the ©ccupational backgrounds ®f the parents, we can also conclude that 
many of these students leave their homes to take their final year of

Why Was Teaciiing Selected As A Vocation. 

Table XVI is a suiamary of the reasons given by 650 student 
teachers for choosing teaching as a vocation. The frequency of reasons 
appears in the second part of the Table, The ten reasons were chosen 
by the sub-committee after a review of the literature ©n similar 
studies. Perhaps these reasons are not valid f@r the group t® whom they 
were submitted. 

The tw© items most frequently checked were (b) and (f). This, 
reflects the high degree ®f idealism possessed by the student teachers. 
Their occupational interest is social in nature and they express 
confidence in their ability to succeed in this type of work. We note that 
financial security had only a minor influence upon their choice of 
occupation. The third most frequently checked item indicates that many 
were influenced by a teacher to select teacMng as a vocation. This 
implies great responsibility on the part of members of the profession 
for the process of pre-training selection. 

Items (c) and (e) reveal that 137 students out of the 650 
answering consider their chosen vocation as a temporary means t® other 
ends. Few thought that the entrance requirements (Item i) were to© 
low, but 79 based their choice upon the fact that it did not cost 
much t® qualify f@r a certificate. Only in 10^ of the cases did 
parental persuasion have any effect upon the choice ©f vocation. Only 
94 had illusions abeut the work being easy and the holidays long. 

The conclusions to be drawn fr©m Table XVI ares- 
1, Teachers in training express idealistic attitudes when they discuss 
their reasons f®r choosing teaching as a vacation.

2o It is apparent that there should be some means of enlightening 
prospective teachers ©n all the practical aspects of teaching as 
a vocation. 

3. Seme teachers are accepting the responsibility ®f directing students 
inte the profession. 

What Vocational Guidance was Received by Prospective Teachers 

The selection of teachers begins in the High Sckool* Many eighteen 
and nineteen year old students with little knowledge ©f either their 
own abilities or of occupations find themselves faced with the problem 
of selecting a vocation. Table XVII skews that educational authorities 
are becoming aware of the need f©r counselling and guidance services in 
the High Schoolso Such a service could screen prospective teacher 
candidates early and get unsui.table people placed elsewhere. Questions 1 
and 2 Series D, and Question 10 Scries F, were designed to discover to 
what extent guidance procedures were being carried out in the High 
Schools, The findings are suBimarized in Table XVII and in Table XVIII, 
Table XVII indicates that 53©f the 492 high school students 
from the six provinces shewn in the table had received vocational 
guidance from the school. The Table indicates the grade in which the 
guidance was received. It is noted that only 23,9^ ©f the students 
discussed their vocational plans while in the twelfth grade» It is in this 
grade that effective guidance procedure could be related to the pre¬ 
training selection of teacher candidates. 

Table XVIII, shows that of 681 student teachers, who answered 
the question, only 182 had received guidance in their choice ©f vocation. 
The deficiency,in this regard, is made more apparent because 68 of these 
had had their interviews whilst attending University. This means that only

What d® Prospective Teachers Think of the Profession? 

Table XIX suBimarizes the answers ©f 680 student teachers t© 
Question 13 Series F. The frequencies of the first five classifications 
are high and the sixth drops considerably lower. Thus the first six 
greatest frequency greups were chesen and many other groups with few 
opinions in each were discarded. This is tke type of ©pen question where 
a great many replies are grouped int© relatively few categories. The 
categories were determined by a grouping of replies of similar nature. 

Tke table reveals, again, the subjective quality of the 
prospective teacher*s thinking regarding his chosen profession. He 
likes tke idea of being of service to society in an occupation with 
short hours and long holidays. He likes the social aspect of tke work 
and the idea of working with young people.

”Tke disadvantages^ expressed in the table are olivi^usly reflections

are the adverse conditions the student teacher considers that he must face. 
If these ©pinions about the profession are representative ®f those held by- 
teachers in training, and by high school seniors, then in the interests ©f 
pre-service selection, validity of each should be carefully examined.

The implications, arising from a study of Table XIX, and which have 
reference t© selective procedure ares- 

(1) High School seniors and teachers in training should have accurate, 
practical information about the job of teaching* 

(2) The teaching profession generally should institute constructive 
publicity to overcome the apparent over-emphasis on the handicaps of 
being a teacher. 


Length of Professional Training, 

Table XX indicates the length of the training program for 680 
prospective teachers in eight provinceso With the exception of training 
periods in Quebec, the amount ©f time spent in training varies from six 
months t© ten months.

Tabl« XXI gives the approximate time in hours that student 
teachers in eight provinces escpect t® spend in practice teaching. 

The figure f®r each province shown is the arithmetic mean and the 
dispersion is shown by an approximate range* It appears that the time 
spent in practice teaching by student teachers in Canada ranges from 
3 to 220 hours. 

The specific conclusion arising from the data presented 
here is that anyone wishing to obtain a measure of economic independence 
within a short time should g© t© Normal, It is evident that high 
professional status ©r prestige cannot be based upon suck short training. 
If the third objective ©f a selective process—mentioned in Chapter II— 
is t® be realized the candidate must face criteria which includes the 
prospect ©f an adequately long training period.

Expected Length of Service. 

Question 17, Series F was answered by 645 student teachers from 
each province, except Prince Edward Island, Their ©pinions are tabulated 
in Table XXII* When it is considered that about 51% of this sampling ©f 
students in training are womeai and that the replies here are expressions 
©f intention, rather than fact, the value of the infomation is subject t© 
some question. The table indicates that 36,4^ the 645 students intend 

to remain in the profession for five years ©r less. Table III showed that 
the rate of turnover, based upon the number of teachers trained each year, 
was about 10^ per year. There appears t® be some correspondence between 
these two rates ®f turnover. 

The problem, here, seems te be how to increase the holding power 
of the profession* Increased standards of selection an^ longer training 
periods would make it less worthwhile for individuals to float in and 
eut of teaching. Suck procedure would operate indirectly to increase the 
prestige of the profession s© that candidates weuld desire t® make it a 


life work

Specific Findings, Chapter IV, 

1. There are insufficient teacher candidates being trained to meet the 
present teacher shortage and rate ©f turnover. About 2600 additional 
candidates must be selected each year for three years t© overcome the 
demand• 

2* The sex ratio , formerly in favour of the female candidates, now 
skews considerable increase in the number of male candidates, 

3* The mean age of teachers in training is approximately 20,5 years, 

4* On the basis of the number per 10,000 in the general population, the 
national background ©f teachers in training is largely European, The 
predominant national group is from central Europe and consists ©f 
Austrian, Czech, Ukrainian, German and Russian. The proportion of 
students, whose ancestral homes are the British Isles is about one 
half the former group. 

5, The average intelligence quotient f®r students in training is about 
110. This shows them to be a selected group with mental ability 

1 

representing the third quairbile group ©f the general population, 

6, In 1946-47 ^0% of 8213 student teachers had academic standing ©f 

Grade XII ©r less, 20^ ©f this group had achieved only Grade X standing. 
In I 947 - 4 S 67^ of a group of 592 candidates had attained academic 
standing ©f Grade XII or less,

7« About 75% of the sample of the student teacher population completed 
the final year of high school in a town or city, 

8, The mental ability of the Education students, enrolled at the University 
of Alberta in 1946-47 compared very favourably with that of students 

in other faculties. This finding refers t© students with complete 
senior matriculation. 

9. N©n-matriculated students, who entered the Faculty of Education in 
1946 - 47 , for the one year program compared very peorly with the 
previously mentioned students, insofar as mental ability scores were 
concerned• 

10. The socio-economic background ©f teachers in training is predominately 
that of the agricultural and laboring groups* 

llo Only 35% ©f the student teachers had previous work experience prior 
t® teacher training. Most of this work was in the agricultural and 
skilled labour classifications. 

12. The reasons given for selecting teaching as a vocation indicate a 
strong desire for social service. 

13 . Only 3.6% ©f 681 teachers in training had discussed their p3.ans t© 
become a teacher with some educational authority prior t© training. 

14® In discussing the **advantages** and **disadvantages** ©f teaching as a 

vocation, student teachers indicate the need for vocational counselling 
and guidance prior to training. 

15 . It is comparatively easy f©r a grade XII graduate t® achieve a measure 
of economic security in less than a year by entering a teacher training

In 19^6 there vjere teachers in eight provinces 

of Canada, Quebec was omitted from this tabulation. This total 
vrqg divided between 11 j 684 male and ^ 8,660 female teachers, which 
would indicate a ratio of male to female teachers of 1 : 5 » 50 »

The following Table is a siiminary of Questions 1-4 Series G, 
which were completely ansvirered by 377 teachers» This number is to© small 
t© be truly representative of the teackj.ng population, but the wide 
geographical distribution from which it is drawn may have some significance. 
The sample obtained by having teachers’ organizations in all the 
provinces forward the questionnaires t© the individual teachers# It is 
likely that the names were selected from each provincial mailing list in 
a random manner. The range of ages in the table would appear to bear 
®ut this statement.

The facts apparent from this sujrimary ares- 

1, More than three quarters ©f the teachers are less than 43 years of

prefessien, 

2, Married women are returning to teaching. More than 75^ ®f these 
teachers are over 31 years ©f age, 

3, The interpereentile age range for the men is small. There are 
relatively few young ®r ®ld men in the sample ®f the teaching 
population shown here, 

4o The rati® ©f males t® females is Is lo51 

Table XXIV shows the educational background ©f the parents ®f 

380 teachers fr©m nine provinces in Canada, When the data from Table 

XXIII is considered it is apparent that the educational ©pportunities ©f 

the parents were limited. The average educational attainment is midway 

between the elementary and high sck®@l levels. 

In 1939^ female teachers remained in the profession for an 

1 

average ©f 5,9 years| male teachers f©r 7#5 years. The fact that the 
male teachers continued in the profession enly 1,5 years longer than the 
wemen teachers indicates that the pre-dominance ®f women in teaching is a 
subsidiary rather than a primary cause ®f its failure t® hold personnel. It 
seems ®bvi®us that there are ©tker factors affecting the stability of 
tenure in teaching, than marriage casualties am®ng the feminine members,

Reasons f®r Selecting Teaching as a Vocation• 

Te the question, did you select teaching as a vocation?” 

the teachers wh® answered the G series gave the replies tabulated in 
Table XXV, The 390 responses are fairly well distributed among nine 
provinces. The answers to this question are ©pen t© s©me criticism. To® 
©ften the responses were merely, **I am fond ©f children,** ©r ”1 am 
interested in this work.” Perhaps these were conventional replies. How¬ 
ever one of the criterion ©f a good teacher should be a genuine fondness 
of children and a real interest in teaching, 

Tw® other facts, which are related t® selection criteria 
are responses (3) and (6) ©f the table. Slightly over % claimed that 
the entrance requirements were low, and that it was financially easy to 
qualify for teaching. Over 10^ ©f the replies claimed that teaching was 
to be a stepping stone t© some other vocation. 

Academic and Professional Qualifications. 

Table XXVI presents the academic and professional training of 
the 372 teachers who answered the G series ®f questions. The reader will 
find it interesting to compare the informatien gained here with the 
results obtained in Table XX^/II, The findings in the latter case are 
more representative of the actual situation in Canada, but the data 
discussed here will be descriptive ©f the sample with which we are 
dealing, 

The academic standing of the 372 teachers is c@mparitively 
high. About 52% have had seme university training. Little can be said 
about high school training after Grade XI because the grade XII figures 
overlap with the university tetal. Hov/cver it is noted that about 26% 
have only Grade XI standing.

The order of the certificates in the column, ’'Certificate 
Held”, is peorly arranged in Table XXVI, ISQien arranged in ©rder of 
value we find that 73^ ®f the teachers have net higher than First 
Class Certificates. These certificates appear t© be associated with 
the Training period ©f ®ne year. 

The 372 teachers were interested in the improvement of 
qualifications by attendance at summer sessions. About 20^ attended 
ene sessien, while 57^ have attended from 2 te 5 summer sessiens. The 
60 teachers frem British Columbia held the highest score in this regard.

R®ws 1 to 4 inclusive and colunm (c) and (d) Indicate the 
number of teachers with one to four years of university training 
and twelve to twenty-four months of professional training. This 
represents only 6,37^ ©f the total. 

The last page of the summary contains a recapitulation of 
the figures. This is read celumn-wise and r©?/-wise in the same manner 
as the previous sheets. 

The interested reader will want to examine this summary further 
with a view t© comparing qualifications and professional status in 
the various provinces. This table should be studied in conjunction 
with Table III to emphasize this point. The outstanding fact from these 
tables is that entrance standards are to© low. In the small percentage 
©f cases where the academic standing is relatively high there is 
evidence ©f insufficient professional training. 

Teacher Opinion About Selection and Training, 

Table XXVIII reflects the ©pinions of 3S0 teachers about 
minimum academic and training standards for those ?/h© wish t© enter 
the teaching profession. It is interesting to note that a high school 
teacher is expected to possess higher qualifications tlian an elementary 
teacher. Grade XII is rated high enough academic standing for elementary 
teachers, while a University degree is desired for the high school 
teacher. There is a decided expression of opinion that primary and 
elementary teachers should receive two years of professional training. 
There seems to be a bi-modal distribution of ©pinions in favour of 
tw© and four years of professional training for high school teachers.

The teachers express the opinion that the training program 
should include a continuous practice teaching period of three to six 
months♦ The last three columns of Table XXIX are heavily weighted 
in favour of long continuous periods of practice teaching. Table 
XXI indicates that trainees expect to do periods of practice 
teaching far short of these requirements. 

Table XXX classifies the answers t© the question, “What 
parts of your professional training were most worthwhile?** A good 
distribution of responses was obtained from nine provinces. The 
teachers emphasized the parts of professional training that had most 
t© d© with the business of teaching. Practice teaching, instruction 
in teaching method, and observation of good demonstration lessons 
were most frequently mentioned. These three items, together with 
emphasis ©n “Professional enthusiasm gained from instructors,** 
indicate the effectiveness of the staffs in the teacher training 
institutions. 

In three provinces where teacher training is on a University 
level, frequent menti©n ¥/as made of its effectiveness. Replies from 
British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan make up most of the fourth 
largest total in the table. 

Many teachers testify to the w@rthwhilcness of including 
specific non-academic subjects in the training program. The expanding 
program in the secondary schools makes it essential that teachers obtain 
training in one or more of the special fields*

Table XXXI is a summary of the answers to the question^ **What 
parts of y®ur professional trainins contributed least to your later 
efficiency?** Many of the teachers did not answer the question and many 
more made rather indefinite references to “Normal School Training,” The 
six classificatioHvS following the first include enough similar answers 
t© warrant differentiation« 

The major complaint was the impractibility of much of the 

training. Its usefulness in later situations seems to be the criterion 

of the efficiency of the training» While it must be remembered that 

considerable time has elapsed since many of the teachers who answered the 

question received their training, there is sufficient evidence t© show 

that teacher training is not entirely satisfactory. Some of the answers 

to the question are quoted for illustrative purposes!- 

** The long history of education should have been omitted and the 
time spent in every day problems in the classroom. My recollection 
is the teachers were theorists and lacked the real grasp of the 
practical side of teaching®” 

“Practice teaching in graded schools in cities contributed least 
t© my efficiency as I did not intend to teach in urban schools 
or even in schools in villages ©r towns,” 

“Lectures @n the history of education did not do much for me. 

The psychology of teaching of various subjects would have been 
more useful t® me after I had had some experience,” 

“The time wasted ©n theory outlined in textbooks, the time 
spent in project work was wasted,” 

The teachers were invited to suggest changes in the present 
teacher training programs, A classification of 521 siiggestions appears 
in Table XXXII. Again the suggestion for an extension of practice teaching 
has the greatest frequency. The teachers are consistent in requesting 
longer periods of training. The fourth most frequent suggestion is more 
careful selection of student teachers. It is interesting t© note that

teachers are becoming concerned about who should come into the profession 
and hew they should be trained. Third highest in the table is the 
suggestion that there should be more opportunities for in-service 
training. These practical suggestions are directly related to service 
in the classreom* The teachers want training to have more demonstration 
classes by experts, and more instruction in the methods of teaching. 

They want prospective teachers to be trained in child psychology and in 
guidance procedures. 

Table XXXIII offers additional ©pinions f©r the improvement 
of teacher training programs. This information was received from 70 
ex-servicemen, who prior t© the war were teachers and who have since 
either returned to teaching or found other employment. The suggestions 
they offer are very similar t® the ones received from the larger 
group of teachers in service. The veterans group place initial 
selection of students equal in rank to a longer training period. Perhaps 
their war service experience made them mere conscious of the idea of 
personnel selection. 

Why Teachers Are N©t Successful, 

Before selection criteria can be established there must be 
some conception of the qualities ©f the successful teacher. The 
negative approach t© finding out something about these qualities is 
made in the analysis of the replies t© Question 28, Series G, The 
material is set up in Table XXXIV. The teachers were given nine causes 
for lack of success in teaching and asked t® rate them ©n a nine p©int 
scale. The order of rating is given in the table and a summary is given

The table indicates that (g), (k), and (i) are most heavily weighted 
at the low end ©f the scale and probably could be discarded. 

If the first six items were re-w©rded in positive terms criteria for 
the selection of prospective teachers would be suggested. Perhaps 
the two highest ranking qualities of a successful teacher^ a good 
personality, and organizing ability, purpose ©r drive, would be the 
most difficult to define and measure f©r the individual candidate.

Specific Findings, v Chapter V. 

1. The rati® ©f female t® male teachers is high. If the economic 

factors were improved more males probably would select teaching as 
a vocation and thereby improve the stability of the profession. 

There are relatively few single men in the profession. This is 
probably because many did not return from the armed forces to 
teaching. 

3a Seventy-five percent ©f the teachers are younger than 43 years 
of age. Furthermcre the male inter-quartile age range is small. 

This is some indication of the weak holding power ©f the profession. 

4« Many married women have returned to teaching. Seventy-five percent 
are over 31 years ©f age, 

5. The average length of time that teachers remain in the profession 

is 5.9 years f©r the women and 7a5 years for the men. (1939| Alberta.), 

6. Teachers come from homes where the educational attainment of the 
parents is divided between the level ©f the elementary and secondary 
school. 

7. The principal reasons f@r choosing teaching as a vocation were a 
fondness for children and an interest in social service.

8. For the sampling ©f 372 teachers, fifty-two percent had from 1-6 
years of University training. Seventy-three percent had twelve months 
®r less professional training, 

9. F®rty-eigkt point niae eight percent ©f 57,338 teachers in seven 
provinces have a Grade XI education ©r less; and have less than 12

10. Twenty-nine point one four percent ®f 57,338 teachers have a Grade

11« Thirteen point tw© six percent of 57|338 teachers have from 1-4 years 
©f university training and less than 12 months professional training, 

12, Only 6,37^ of these teachers from seven provinces have 1-4 years of 
university education and more than one year ©f teacher training, 

13* The teachers recommend Grade XII standing and tw© years of professional 
training for elementary teachers, A university degree and two t© four 
years professional training is recoiamended for high sck®@l teachers, 

14* The teachers recommend that a continuous practice teaching period 
©f three t© six months be included in the training program. 

15, The teachers stated that the parts of their own professional training 
found to be most worthwhile were practice beaching, instruction in 
teaching methods, and the observation ©f good demenstration lessons.

16o Teachers in three provinces emphasized teacher training on the 
university level as being the most effective part of their 
professional training, 

17, The teachers stated that the least worthwhile parts of their 
professional training were impractical activities and courses at 
the Normal School, 

18, The most frequent suggestions for improvement of teacher training 
were^- longer period of training, more demonstration by expert 
teachers, and more instruction in methods of teaching, 

19, The teachers stated that there should be mere careful selection 
ef teacher candidates, 

20, The teachers suggested five criteria for successful teachings 

(a) A personality well suited to the job of teaching. 

(b) The ability to organize, and the possession of sufficient 
purpose and drive to work effectively, 

(c) Sufficient academic background upon which to base professional 
training and experience, 

(d) A willingness to undertake a program of professional training 
of sufficient length and quality to enable the individual 

to teach effectively.

CHAPTER VI 


PUBLIC OPINION OF SELECTION AND TRAINING STANDARDS. 

Th« object of this chapter is to discuss material from the 
questionnaires which were received from business, professional, and 
industrial people and from high school students* 

Table XX3N presents the answers of 90 people to the questions 
How many grades of high school or years of general university education 
should be pre-requisite to teacher training? Again we meet the belief 
that the professional training of elementary teachers should be 
based upon less academic preparation than that of high school teachers* 
However the level of academic preparation desired in both areas is high* 
Over 35% of those answering want some university training for elementary 
teachers and over 80^ think a university education is necessary for high 
school teachers* The modal academic preparation desirable is four years 
of high school for elementary teachers and three years of university for 
high school teachers* This criterion of selection is the same as that 
suggested by the teachers in Table XXVIII* 

Comments About Teachers By High School Students* 

Question 8 of Series D was an open question to high school students» 
The replies of 470 students in all provinces excepting Ontario, New 
Brunswick and Nova Scotia are classified in Table XXXVI* From the 
"strong points" and the "weak points" Hsted it is possible to develop 
the concept of a good or a poor teacher* Personality factors and ability 
to teach rank high in the opinion of the students# Lack of teaching 
ability is the most frequent weak point mentioned* That the teacher was 
interested and friendly is the most frequently mentioned strong point*

TABLE XXWI 

STRONG AND lEAK POINTS OF TEACIffiRS 

Qaestionnalre Series D 

High School Students 


Suamary of Question S 


8* What have been the •strong points* and the •weak points* in 
the teachers you have had since beginning school in Grade 1 ? 


Strong Points 470 students fro» British Columbia, Alberta, 

Saskatchewan^ Manitoba, Quebec, Prince Edward Island « 


1# The teacher was interested and friendly* ' 284 

2* The teacher had a good personality. Ci«e« patience, 

huBor, consideration, tolerance, good character.) 210 

3o The teacher showed ability to teach. 168 

4e The teacher helped outside the school in sport and 

eonmuaity life. 137

This quality should probably have been included in the personality 
classification* In fact many of the **point 3 ** shown in the table are 
attributes of an effective or ineffective teaching personality* A good 
knowledge of the subject matter ranks high as a “strong point*“ This 
implies that all high school teachers should have a university education* 
The three criteria suggested by the study of Table XXXVI are effective 
teaching personality, ability to teach, and sufficient academic preparation* 

High School Opinion of Teaching* 

The numerical description of the data which accumulated in 
response to Questions 3 and 4 of Series D is given in Table XXXVII* 

The percentage of students who said they would like to teach is very 
large* Our teacher shortage would soon be over if one out of three high 
school students selected teaching as a vocation* When the high school 
stxidents answered the question, “What vocation would you like to follow®, 
as summarized in Table XXXVIII, only 12^ chose teaching* The reasons 
given for choosing teaching as a vocation Indicate an idealized conception 
of the work* An interest in children and the desire to work with them out¬ 
ranks all other reasons* A study of the eleven classifications of 
responses shown in the table leads one to conclude that high school students 
generally do not know what is involved in the training and the work of 
teachers* 

In most cases the student who did not choose teaching merely 
stated that he was not interested* Many stated that they felt they were not 
able to do the work or that they did not have the personality required to 
work with children* A large number stated that the work did not pay 
sufficient salary to be attractive* The reasons given here are similar to 
the disadvantages of teaching shown in table XIX*

Table XXXVIII is included, not only to show the relative 
position of teaching in the vocational choices of high school students, 
but also to indicate the range of their choices. Nearly 60% of the 
479 students answering the question selected one of the first six 
professions listed in the table. There are only about 20 major occupations 
represented and about 13 of them may be classified as professions. The 
three most frequent reasons for choosing any vocation are interest, 
feeling of ability to do well, and a desire to serve humanity. The 
idea of remuneration is fourth and the few remaining reasons are 
numerically unimportant. 

Prestige of the Profession. 

Tffhen the industrial and professional people were asked whether 
or not the prestige of the teaching profession was low 80^ said “yes,** 

The reasons that they give are classified in Table XXnX. High standards 
of selection and training would automatically remove the other causes 
offered for the low prestige of the teaching profession. The implications 
from this table are that in order to attract high quality personnel 
t^ching must have the prestige and security offered by other professions. 
The public are not willing to recognize the “professionalism** of a group 
of people whose average academic level is Grade XII and whose average 
professional training is one year. 

This study is concerned with the improvement of teaching personnel 
through higher standards of selection. There is no reason why the source 
of teacher candidates should be limited to the high schools. There is 
excellent teacher material among the university undergraduates, and in 
business and industry. The many academically well qualified married

women in Canada might be considered a source of teacher candidates* 

It seems desirable that these sources be tapped to bring in the 
mature 9 well balance personalities so urgently needed in the 
profession to give it the status it deserves* 

Table XL is interesting because it compares the answers of 
business people and teachers to this question* A larger percentage 
of the business people than teachers suggested that teaching is 
unattractive because it does not pay enough* More business people 
than teachers stated that something should be done about the way 
prospective teachers are selected and trained* The general public 
appear to be more conscious of the need for constructive publicity 
for education* In brief their suggestion for obtaining good 
prospective teachers is to raise salaries, put forth a good public 
relations program and from the resultant s\;^ply of candidates select 
through the use of effective czlteria* More teachers than business 
people thought that the schools could be staffed with well qualified 
teachers if working conditions were improved, if there were greater 
security of tenure, if the prestige of the profession were increased 
and if housing conditions were improved* About 61^ of the replies 
claimed that, while other vocations provided relatively better 
economic security, few people would select teaching as a vocation* This 
opinion is supported by the fact that during the depression teacher 
candidates were of higher quality* The Normal School in Edmonton 
ranked 13th out of 304 tmiversities and training institutions in North 
America on the Thurstone Psychological Test scores in 1936* In 194^ 
this rank had dropped to lUth in 253 reporting* While other 
occupations continue to be more attractive the teaching profession 
will draw into its ranks only the mediocre students from the high 
schools and these will remain only until -ttiey are mature enough to

find accepteuice in other vocationa* 

About 31$ of the replies indicate that before the public are 
willing to pay higher salaries there must be some evidence of 
improved services through increased training* Salary negotiating 
committees of teachers* ox^anlzations receive this protest against 
increased salaries fvoni the public* If a Grade XII graduate trains 
for one year to become a teacher she should not expect more than 
the graduate who goes to business college for a year to become a 
stenographer* School boards often fail to consider the continuous 
nature of the teacher's professional training when salary schedules 
are drafted* An examination of the teaching qualifications of those 
answering the G series shows a large number of teachers with many 
years of experience and low qualifications* Whether this condition 
is the result of low salaries or of a lethargic attitude towards 
professional growth on the part of the teachers is difficult to 
determine* In any event it is evidence that Initial training should be 
long enough to guarantee professional recognition* 

Table XU suggests also that something be done to improve 
the method of selecting those people who want to teach* During the 
present teacher shortage very little is being done about initial 
selection* Entrance requirements have been lowered and even then 
candidates have difficulty in completing their courses. Teacher 
training staffs have expressed concern about the feasibility of some 
individuals continuing their training* 

The high cost of living has made it difficiilt for many students 
to bear the burden of long training programs* If such students are 
able to meet the entrance criteria for teacher training some form of 
financial assistance should be available* This opinion is borne out in 
the replies to question 7 of the ABC-G series. Table XLII expresses

t/ho vlows of 68 business people and 117 leachers on lihe question 
of financial aid to students. Both groups favour scholarships and 
loans* It is assumed that the financial assistance offered should be 
sufficient to attract the type of student who is able to meet 
relatively high standards. This year the Department of Education, in 
Alberta, has offered two hundred scholarships worth t200.00 each, 
together with the payment of University fees to applicants who will 
agree to teach in the province for three years after graduation* 
Obviously this action is not in the nature of beneficient aid to 
worthwhile students, but rather an effort to overcome the teacher 
shortage* Had this financial aid been offered only to students in 
the two year program it would have assisted in the improvement of 
teaching personnel* The quality of teaching personnel cannot be 
improved by lowering entrance standards and subsidizing the type 
of student who will take advantage of such standards. Table IX 
offers adequate evidence of this statement. 

The series ABC group were asked if it were in the interest 
of public education to train as teachers those who intend to remain 
in the profession for only two to five years* Table XLIII indicates 
that public opinion is divided upon this question* It is the generally 
accepted opinion that marriage casualties among women teachers are the 
primary cause of the lack of stability in the profession* This, 
together with the fact that the training is useful in other situations 
quite justifies turning out many teachers every year to replace those 
who are passing through to other careers* The status to which the public 
has relegated teaching as a vocation is apparent in the short range 
viewpoint taken to overcome the teacher shortage by transient

The other half of the picture presented in Table XLIII is 
more encouraging to the idea of improving teaching personnel and 
thereby making it possible to select better teachers. Among those 
who said it was not in the interest of public education to train 
temporary teachers were many who thought vocational counselling and 
guidance procedures could help in establishing the stability of the 
teaching profession. They recognized that the high rate of turnover 
did lower the prestige of the profession and that it tended to restrain 
well qualified people from selecting it as a vocation. Most of the 
people who commented that increased salaries would encourage teachers 
to remain in the profession also insisted upon a more effective period 
of training* The specific conclusion that this table suggests is 
that many people are willing to continue to accept the conditions and 
practices now eidstent in the selection and training of teachers* 

Two other tables included in this discussion of opinions 
regarding the improvement of the teaching profession place particular 
emphasis on the implications for the selection of suitable candidates* 
Table XLIV expresses the opinions of about 350 teachers regarding 
whether or not married women should teach. There are about 62 married 
women in this sample, and about 162 single women. This fact may 
have some bearing upon the high degree of agreement to the first part 
of the question. 

Opinion with respect to the second half of the question, is fairly 
wen divided* During the last few years of the teacher shortage many 
married teachers have returned to the classrooms* Married women who 
can meet the same high criteria as other candidates should be welcomed 
into the profession. If selection and training criteria were effective

enough the objection that the presence of married women lowers 
salary schedules would be overcome« Table XLIV expresses the opinion 
that married women should remain in the profession. The degree 
of professionalism possessed by these people would determine whether 
or not their presence was detrimental. 

The other table, remaining in this group, contains suggestions 
regarding teachers made by 475 high school students in six provinces. 
The whole of the summary of Question 9 was included here because a 
careful consideration of the items suggest the kind of teacher 
desired by the students. Table XLV contains the three parts of this 
summary. To teach the type of curriculum suggested in Part One of the 
summary the teacher would have to be interested in individual 
students rather than in subject matter as such. The demand here is 
for knowledges and activities very close to the personal life of the 
student. The student indicates his dislike for regimentation in his 
desire for greater choice among practical courses. He wants more 
sports, extra-curricular activities, and practical knowledge of what 
is going on in the world. In brief, the personality factors would be 
an important criterion of success for the teacher who could meet these 
demands. 

Part Two of the table gives outstanding emphasis to the fact 
that the high school student is not happy about the teaching ability 
of his teachers. Better training and higher academic qualifications 
were suggested more often than any other single item. The next two 
most frequently mentioned were that teachers should be paid higher 
salaries and that younger teachers should be appointed. It is noted 
that even among high school students theire is the impression that the 
teachers are not paid enough. If the teaching profession could carry out

an equally effective campaign for more rigid initial selection and 
more effective training programs the problem of personnel improvement 
would soon be solved. 

Part Three of the table makes some suggestion regarding school 
management and administration. The teacher^ who would ccurry out these 
must be skilled in student personnel work, willing to battle with 
senior administrators for equipment and improvements, and an expert 
in the matter of public relations. Again this suggests that the 
successful teacher must meet particular personality criteria. 

In summary, the following specific implications for selection 
and training criteria ares- 

1. The teacher must possess personality traits which are effective 
in student personnel work, public relations and administrative duties. 

2. The teacher^s academic qualifications and teaching ability should 
warrant the confidence of the students. 

The same sampling of the high school population as previously 
described were asked to check on a four point scale idiat they thought 
to be the degree of interest in the school possessed by the people in 
their home community. While the validity of opinions expressed by school 
students is questionable, nevertheless the wide geographical range of 
sampling here is worthy of considera.tion. It is conceded that public 
interest in the school varies with the size of the community. Residents 
of small communities have often a very intimate knowledge of the 
affairs of the school, while in the larger communities the parent often 
knows only the name of his child*s teacher. The purpose in presenting 
the evidence of Table ILVI is to show further the apparent indifference 
of the public to matters of educational concern. Perhaps this apparent

lack of public Interest means that teachers in general have not 

welcomed the attention of the public* It would be in the interests of 

education generally if public relations were improved* A quotation 

from the ABC group suggests this alsos- 

"Members of the teaching profession have a story to tell 
which is as good as any story which can be told by any 
other profession* Why they don't get out and tell it is 
more than I know* Instead of that they labor their own 
shortcomings 9 and encourage everybody else to do the same 
thing*** 

The discussion of public opinion of the teaching profession 

and its relation to selecting and training teachers is closed with 

some quotations from the questionnaires retuimed by business and 

industrial people* In many cases these people attached letters to the 

questionnaires and parts of these are quoted here* There seems to be 

a feeling running through the theme of improvement of teaching personnel 

that something should be done about initial selection of teacher 

candidates* The law of supply and demand is not good enough to secure 

the quality of candidate required by modern education* These people sayt 

*• Cull out the misfits in teacher training colleges* The course 
should be at least three years long* For such graduates 
remuneration should be such that will enable them to live on 
a scale equal to other professions* By neglecting the 
teaching profession we neglect our children's and our own 
future*** 


**0ur top flight teachers are not good enough* They are not 
carefully selected—in fact they are not screened to any extent* 

I would suggest that a process of selection be gradually instituted, 
that more who have the necessary character, natural ability, 
be encouraged in every way—their University education made 
financially easy, that they be guaranteed after complete 
training a salary of $4000 to ^5000 per year***

" Far too many female teachers, especially for boys. 
Classes are too large especially in urban schools. Those 
desiring to enter the profession should be scz^eened. Far 
too many mediocre minds and characters in the profession 
at present." 


" Extend the minimum training period, i.e* raise the 
standards of qualifications. Place all training under a 
faculty of a university." 


• Many people enter the teaching profession who do not 
intend to stay with the result that they undertake a minimum 
of training." 


" The eventual aim should be a degree for every teacher. AH 
other professions have it, why not for one of the most 
important professions?" 


• We expect the best of our teachers and preachers to go to 
schools for anywhere from four to ten years to equip themselves 
for their profession and then ask them to work for little or 
nothing for the rest of their lives." 


• With an improvement in salary, the entrance qualifications 
to the profession might be made a little stiffer, so that types 
who are temperamentally suited to teaching will be given the 
necessary training, and persons who are below standards will be 
excluded." 


® I believe the teachers themselves are mistaken in insisting on 
salary schedules based upon certificates and degrees, and 
neglecting such things as personality, natural ability for 
leadership etc. perhaps the teachers like regimentation. 

Normal schools graduate too many misfits." 


" Baise the standard of teacher training. Select teachers at 
commencement of training with greater care. Disallow anyone 
from teaching whose I.Q. is average or below average." 


" Select the teachers for the subjects they might best be 
qualified for and keep them in that zone." 

Perhaps the above quotations are too few in number to represent 
opinion from the wide geographical area. They do indicate, however, that 
some people are seriously considering the qualifications of teaching

Specific Findings From Data Presented in Chapter VI. 

!• The academic qualifications for elementary teachers should be four 
years of high school and the academic qualifications for high 
school teachers should be three years of university training. 

2« High school students state the most important "Strong Points" of 

teachers they have had ares- a good personality, the ability to teach, 
and a good grasp of subject matter. 

3o Twelve percent of 479 high school students declared they would select 
teaching as a vocation. 

4e The most frequent reasons given by high school students for selecting 
teaching as a vocation were a fondness for children and the desire to 
do work of a social nature. 

5o The two most frequent reasons why high school students did not wish 
to teach were lack of interest in the work and the fact that 
renumeration is too low. 

6« An analysis of the questions relating to vocations in Series D 
indicates the need for vocational guidance and for courses on 
occupations in the high school. 

7. About eighty percent of the replies in the ABC group said that the 
prestige of the teaching profession were low. The two most frequent 
reasons given were low salaries and inadequate training.

S* The two most frequent suggestions given by this group, for the 
improvement of the teaching profession were to raise salaries and 
to put better systems of selection and training into practice* 

9. The public is in favour of granting scholarships and loans to 
qualified students for the purpose of equalizing educational 
opportunities. 

lOo About fifty percent of the replies in the ABC group claimed it was 
not in the interests of public education to train teachers who remain 
in the profession for only short periods of time. They suggested that 
stability be increased through increasing salaries and putting into 
effect systems of vocational counselling to select candidates. 

11« It is the opinion of teachers that married women should teach. They 
believe that the commonly accepted opinion against married women 
teaching has had a deterimental effect upon the profession. 

12. High school opinion offers the following criteria for the selection 
and training of teacherss 

(a) Personality traits to assure success in student personnel work, 
in public relations, azsd in administrative duties. 

(b) Academic qualifications and teaching ability superior enough 
to warrant the confidence of the students. 

13. Three point seven percent of 452 high school students felt that the 
people in their community cooperated fully with the school or looked 
for opportunities to bring about improvements. The need for a public 
relations program on the part of the school is apparent.

in quality and length to that of other professions* 

(c) Possession of temperamentcharacter, and personality

CHAPTER VII 

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

This chapter will summarize the findings previously listed in 
Chapters IV, V, and VI* Recommendations for improved standards of 
selection and training will complete the chapter. 

Although 7833 teachers were trained in 1947-48 to replace 
vacancies in Canada’s force of slightly over 50,000 teachers, in 
order to meet the increased demand about 2600 additional candidates 
must be trained eumually for a period of three years* This means that 
for the next few years it will be difficult to establish high standards 
of teacher selection* The people who are at present entering the 
profession through non-selective procedures have been described in 
chapter TV* The ratio of males to females is increasing and the average 
age is higher than formerly* This is encouraging because among the 
teachers in service there are slightly more than three times as many 
women as men* The fact that over 1% of the teachers are less than 43 
years of age,and that 7*5 years is the average length of time the men 
remain in the profession indicates the lack of stability of the 
profession. About 345^ of the teachers in training expressed the 
opinion that they intend to remain in teaching for less than five years* 
Mazried women are returning to the profession* Only 25^ of these are 
less than 31 years of age* There are relatively few single young men 
in the classrooms at the present time* In the provinces where relatively 
high salary schedules have recently been established, the number of 
young men in the training schools is high* In Alberta the number of men 
enrolled in 1947-4S exceeded the women*

Socio-Econoinic eind Racial Background* 

Moat of the teachers in training cuid in service were born in 
the twenties or earlier* This was the era of mass immigration from 
Europe^ especially to the Western Provinceso Many of these people did 
not accumulate sufficient resources to offer their children more 
advanced educational opportunity than the Provincial Normal School* 

It Is characteristic of these people to revere leaniing) aad the one 
year normal course offered access to relatively good economic security 
and social status* There are about twice as many teachers with 
ancestral homes in central Europe than in Anglo-Saxon countries* The 
socio-economic background of teachers in training in 1947-4^ is 
predominately agricultural and labour* The teacher candidates, who prior 
to teacher training, have been continuously employed for over six months 
have also been in these types of occupations* The parental education 
is between the elementary and high school level* 

Academic and Professional Equipment* 

The average I*Q* of about 730 teacher candidates was 110* 

This is considered to be in the average to bright average group 
representing the middle 50% of the general public* An I*Q* of 120 is 
generally considered necessary to complete a university degree* Only 
about 22% of the teachers have from one to six years of university 
training, and only 6*4% have had professional training in excess of one 
year together with academic training on the university level* In Alberta 
in 1946-47 it was fowad that by accepting applicants for teacher 
training with less than matriculation, people with less mental ability 
than formerly were entering the profession*

TeachersI teachers in training, and high school students^ 
all recorded that the main reason for choosing teaching as a vocation 
was a fondness for children* The second reason in each case was a 
desire to serve others* Only 16% of the teachers in training had discussed 
their vocational plans with an. educational advisor prior to training* 

Only 24 % of 492 high school students had received vocational guidance 
in Grade XII* 


Recommendations From the Teachers* 

The teachers* statements applied to the classroom situation* 

They said practice teaching, instruction in teaching methods, and 
observation of good demonstration lessons were the most worthwhile parts 
of their professional training* Their suggestions for the improvement 
of teacher training reiterate the importance of instruction in methods, 
good demonstration lesson, and practice teaching* The teachers from the 
three western provinces wanted the university to replace the normal 
school in the training of teachers* The teachers indicated in the 
questionnaire that the following qualifications are essential to the 
selection of good teacher candidates 

(i) Grade XII academic standing for elementary school teachers* 

(ii) University graduate standing for high school teachers* 

(iii) A personality well suited to teaching. 

(iv) Organizing ability, purpose and drive to work effectively* 

(v) Good health* 

Standard for training should beJ 

(i) Two years of professional training for elementary school teachers* 

(ii) Two to four years of professional training for high school teachers*

Recommendations From High School Students* 

The high school students protested most frequently that 
teachers lack the ability to teach; that they are not interested in 
the students as individuals* The most frequently mentioned strong 
points possessed by teachers are a good personality, the ability to 
teach, and a good grasp of subject matter* About twelve percent of 
the students selected teaching as a vocation* The rest said that 
teaching was unattractive because it lacks social status and does not 
pay enough* High school opinion recommends the following criteria for 
selection and trainingj- 

(i) Personality traits which will assure success in student personnel 
work, in public relations, and in administrative duties* 

(ii) Academic qualifications and teaching ability to warrant the 
confidence of the students* 

Recommendations From the Public* 

Generally speaking the teaching profession lacks prestige* The 
two most frequently mentioned reasons are low salaries and inadequate 
training of teaching personnel* Higher salaries and more adequate 
training are the main recommendations for the improvement of teaching 
personnel* Scholarships and loans are favoured as a means of enabling 
poor students to finance long periods of training* Public opinion is 
divided on whether or not it is in the interests of education to train 
teachers who intend to remain in the vocation for only a short period 
of time* It is generally agreed that qualified married women should teach* 
An opinion frequently expressed is that good public relations through 
effective publicity for education should be definitely encouraged. The 
criteria for selection and trairdng emerging from the analysis of public

RECOMMENDATIONS 


lo Better standards and techniques of teacher selection are required 
at the pre-training and training levels* Since large numbers of 
teachers are required in the next five years, it is recommended that 
the most recent and approved methods of personnel selection be 
instituted* This should include guidance based upon the results of 
standardized tests and personal interviews* The candidate should 
know his strengths and weaknesses early in the training period, and 
where negative results are apparent he should be guided into other 
endeavoiirs. This general recommendation also implies remedial 
measures for weidcer students by the training staff* 

2* Teacher training should be at a university level, and of longer 
duration than the one-year normal school training* High standards 
should be maintslned* 

3o The teaching profession, in cooperation with Departments of Education, 
should accept greater responsibility for setting minimum entrance 
requirements* 

4* Student counselling and guidance systems should be maintained in 
the larger secondary schools* A cumulative record, including 
anecdotal remarks by teachers, should be kept for each students. 

These records should be part of the basis of recruiting teacher 
candidates, and should be included in the students records at the 


training institution

5* Principals of the larger high schools should encourage 

prospective teachers to organize pre-training clubs for the purpose 
of investigating all aspects of teaching* Such students should have 
try-out experiences in teaching and reports should be made upon 
their potential qualities* 

6 * i- course on teaching as a profession should be part of the 
training of every candidate* This should Include lectures by 
eminent persons in the profession* 

7o A publicity program, which, while not minimizing present 

educational problems, would help to attract suitable candidates 
to the profession should be instituted and continued*
