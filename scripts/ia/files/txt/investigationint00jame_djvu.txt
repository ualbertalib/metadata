INTRODUCTION 


This field of investigation was suggested to me by 
Dr, H. E. Smith of the University of Alberta during a 
consultation I had with him in August,1935,regarding a 
suitable subject for a thesis, nr. Smith proposed that 
a longitudinal study be made from Grade VI to Grade nil, 
inclusive,for the purpose of estimating the increasing 
richness of language concepts during this period, as a 
method, he suggested that a set of key words be selected 
from some subject in which the investigator might be 
particularly interested,these words to serve as a basis 
for the investigation. Owing to the fact that my teaching 
has been confined chiefly to the Science subjects I made 
a selection from words used in General Science. 

Throughout the investigation, Dr. M. E. Lazerte and 
Dr. H. E. Smith gave valuable suggestions and assisted 
materially by submitting one of the tests to a class of 
senior students at the university. I am also indebted to 
the teachers of the Bellevue school staff for their 
co-operation in giving the tests and to Miss E. Chiarovano 
for assistance in scoring and tabulating results. Mr. M. D. 
McSaehem who was carrying out a parallel investigation 
with- History words was an invaluable associate and has kindly 
permitted me to make use of the data he collected in order 
that I might compare my results with his and so have some check 
on the reliability of the tests.

CHAPTER I 
THiii PRO-bllAI 

The problem was to ’’estimate the increasing 
richnes's of language concepts over the period of years from 
grade VI to grade XII inclusive.” Although the investiga¬ 
tion does measure indirectly the extent of the student’s 
vocabulary, the prime purpose was to test as comprehensively 
as possible the connotations, shades of meaning, and range 
of significance of the students’ knowledge of the words. 

According to Dorothea McCarthy of the University of 
Minnesota, most language studies, which have already been 
undertaken, have dealt with the language development of the 
pre—school child. These investigations have .covered 
"appearance of the first word","extent of understood vocab— 
ulary at different ages", "the gaining of control of the 
vocal organs", etc. Ho investigation exactly parallel to 
our own has apparently been carried out. We have, therefore, 
no norms or other results which may be used for comparison 
with what we have found. However, a comparison of the two 
sets of data collected by Mr. McSachern and myself should 
prove of some interest. 

In my own investigation the words selected are words 
that Grade Uine students need to know in their study of 
General Science. My concern has been to find out as nearly 
as possible the richness of the meaning which students 
have associated with these words. s a rule students are 
not very critical of their own vocabulary. They may grasp 
the meaning of the word from its context or they may assign 
it a meaning of their own according to some pre--existing 
schema. This leads to an inexact knowledge of words which 
will seriously handicap the student in his effort to obtain 
first hand knowledge from books. It would have the same 
effect on the student’s ability ret spoken language. 

This study of language concepts may throw some light on 


























-2- 


the generally poor standard of work: in our Secondary 
Schools. It may also indicate that there is something at 
fault with the formal teaching of words in schools. 


CHAPTER II 

APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM 
There are two direct methods for discovering a 
student’s knowledge of a word, namely, the oral and written. 
In the oral examination fch t may talk freely as his 

mental associations with the word prompt him. His remarks 
may he followed up hy .careful and varied questioning in 
order to prohe the soundness of his knowledge and the range 
of it. He is not confined hy a set system of questions to 
certain lines of thought. Actual preliminary oral testing, 
however, did not prove particularly successful. Students 
were unable to divulge, on the spur of the moi , reat 
deal of information about the word especially with regard 
to its finer shades of meaning and special uses. It was 
found that the type of questioning would need to vary 
considerably with different students and that the scoring ' 
had to be done too hastily since there was no available 
means of taking down the student’s discussion and responses 
verbatim. home s'-ad ends were handicapped by shyness and 
some seemed to be slightly on the defensive. The amount of 
time required for the oral testing of a sufficiently rep-- 
reseniative group of students was not at my disj : id so 

hal testing , ing. 

In the circumstances that prevailed the written type 
of test offered the following advantages: 1. It brings out 
ihe student's knowledge quite fully provided the test' is 
comprehensive and suggestive; 2. the experience a’ 
have had in written J :ests places them at their ease; 3. 
large numbers of students can be tested simultaneously;

4. the element of secrecy c .n e sily be maint ained since 

11 '• the test t the same period; 5. the 

test is uniform in content and is uniformly administered to 
all students thus making it more objective; 6. a uniform 
system of scoring can be used; 7. as members of a group 
students are not on the defensive and will put forth a good 
effort; 8. the time required for testing is not great; 

9. a permanent record is provided for scoring and analysis; 

10. students have time to deliberate before putting down 
their answers. 

ri 

the fact that in some cases students defined the word through 
the helpful suggestiveness of some of the other questions. 
However, the student even there had to discriminate between 
right and wrong and if he selected the wrong concept it 
added to his error score. 

With the foregoing considerations in mind, the written 
form of test was finally selected. Considerable oral 
questioning was done between tests in order to determine 
if the tests ?;ere covering all shades of meaning of the 
word and also to find if students were quite clear in their 
minds as-to the procedure to be followed in answering. As 
a result of this oral questioning certain changes were made 
in the tests in order to improve them. 

COrrSTEUCTIDI OF'the ias'2 

In order to construct a suitable test the following 
guiding principles were employed: 1. the test should cover 
all meanings and applications of the word; 2. tests should 
not reflect the investigator’s bias; 3. there should be as 
great objectivity as possible; 4. such qualities as denota¬ 
tion, connotation, degree of abstraction, extent of knowledge 
should be measured separately in so far as that is possible; 

5. the tests should messure the students’ ability, to use 













-4- 


the word correctly,to define the word.,to recognize correct 
usage of it,to select its synonyms;6* each, word must he 
treated in such a way as to test its meaning and uses 
fully rather than attempt to keep to a standard form 
for all words; 7. it should he possible to measure both 
knowledge and error associated with the word. 

The advantage of having Mr. McAachern working with 
me in the construction of the tests was very great. We 
were' able,by putting our questions to each other,to 
increase the objectivity of the tests,eliminate faulty 
questions,get the point of view of the person answering 
the test,increase comprehensiveness and range,etc. We 
are now able to see many ways -in which the tests might 
have been improved but at the time many faults were 
eliminated by our consultations while actually constructing 
the tests. 

At first it was thought that a great many words could 
be tested. However,the work involved was far greater than 
had been anticipated. Only twelve words were used for the 
actual investigation but considering the number of words 
involved in the construction of each test,it is obvious that 
the final score of each student reflects his knowledge of a 
wide vocabulary. The tests are included here in the order in 
which they were given to the students. Changes will be noticed 
in the form after the first few tests and this was in an 
attempt to improve the tests. Two questions were added. One 
was to find out if the student knew anything about the word 
which the test did not cover and so check the comprehensiveness 
of the tests. The other question added was to check the clarity 
of the questioning from the point of view of the person 
answering the test.

Administering the Tests. 

The tests were written by the students at three o'clock 
on Friday afternoons on the dates shown on the tests. The 
students were supervised hy their own teachers. Ho inform¬ 
ation which would help the students in answering was given 
out hut students were allowed to ask questions concerning 
procedure and were given as much time as they required to 
finish the tests. All students were asked to do their very 
best on the tests. Very few cases occurred in which the 
students did not make a really serious effort. 

In order to arrive at a sort of maturity score,a set 
of tests on the word "principle" was sent to Hr. Lazerte, 
director of the School of Education at the University of 
.alberta. Dr. Lazerte gave these tests to a senior class at 
the university and returned them to me. The results of these 
tests are included in the report. It also seemed important 
to find out what type of score would be made by students who 
possessed little or no knowledge of the test words. In order 
to do this some of the tests were given this term in grades 
IV and V. 

The chronological ages of all students who wrote the 
tests were recorded as at January 1,1936. This date was 
approximately the middle of the testing period. 

Immediately following the completion of all the tests 
the students wrote the "Otis Self-Administering Test of 
Mental Ability." The intermediate form of this test was 
given to Public School students and the Higher form to 
students of the High School. From the I.^.'s obtained the 
mental age of each student was worked out and recorded and 
has been used in the analysis of results of the tests.

Scoring 

The scoring of these tests was a problem which required 
considerable thought and the system used is of course subject 
to criticism. The questions which made the greatest demands 
on the students' original powers,i.e. the questions in which 
answers were not suggested,seemed most valuable. These questions 
were No.2,which asked the student to use the word correctly in 
a sentence and No.3,which asked for the definition of the word. 
For question No.2 a maximum score of three points was allowed. 

If the student gave a sentence using the word with an incorrect 
meaning he was given one point for error. Thus knowledge 
received more emphasis than error on this question. In question 
No. 3 one point was given for each correct,distinct definition 
without an upper limit being set. One point was also given for 
each error concept in the definition. No score was allotted in 
question 1. In all the other questions one point was given for 
each correct response and one point for each incorrect response. 
Questions not attempted were not scored. There was no upper 
limit score set for any test. Students' scores were carefully 
recorded. 

The complete data collected in this investigation is 
summarized in the following pages.

Explanation of abbreviations: 

M. A. —Ment al A ge. 

X.—knowledge Scores. 

E.—Error Scores. 

H.—Tests on words chosen from History. 

S.—Tests on words chosen from Science. 

Rankings were arranged in each grade as follows: 

M.A.-Highest to lowest. 

X.-Highest to lowest. 

E.-Lowest to highest. 

According to the rankings, a positive correlation for E. 
and M.A. or E. and X. indicates that E. decreases as M.A. or X. 
increases. Where X. is correlated in the table with any variable 
except E., a positive correlation indicates that the two variables 
increase or decrease together. 


The Knowledge Scores 

The knowledge scores have been classified in three ways. 
Firstly, the mean knowle ge score for each grade was determined 
by taking the sum of the me n knowledge scores of the individual 
pupils in each grade and dividing this sum by the number of 
pupils in the grade. Secondly, the students v;ere grouped accord¬ 
ing to chronological age, at age intervals of six months, and the 
mean score of each group determined. Finally, students were 
arranged in mental age groups, also at six months intervals, and

The increase in knowledge score lay grades is most 
noticeable as between grades VI and VII. From grade VII to 
grade XI there is also a fairly steep rise in the knowledge score. 
Grade XII show exactly the same mean score as grade XI. In inter¬ 
preting these scores it is necessary to consider the possible 
effects on the score of the smaller sampling of students in the 
higher grades and the variability of grades with regard to mental 
ability and industry. As an instance, the grade XI class which 
wrote these tests were above average in mental power while the 
grade XII class were somewhat below average in this respect. 

Increase of knowledge by chronological age is almost uniform 
up to the age of seventeen. From there on the rate of increase 
lessens. The explanation might be that students in the higher 
chronological age groups are those of less ability who are repeating 
work in the higher grades. The erratic nature of the development 
is probably owing to the small sampling in some of theage intervals, 
especially at the upper levels. 

Growth of knowledge and increase of mental age shows a 
higher correlation than growth of knowledge by grade or by 
chronological age. There is apparently no slowing down in growth 
of knowledge at the higher mental ge levels as was observable at 
higher grade and chronological age levels. 

The knowledge score on these tests is obviously subject 
to the element of guessing. In order to determine the scores 
V\/hich would be made by students having little or no knowledge of 
the words, five of the tests were given this term to grades IV 
and V under same conditions and with same instructions given to 
the higher grades. The following table shows the results of : 
these tests.

This table shows that students who are merely guessing are 
able to make a considerable knowledge score. The children in 
grade IV were questioned orally about the words before writing 
the tests and in almost all cases professed to have no know¬ 
ledge of the words. It is observable that the mean knowledge 
score in grade IV is practically the same as the mean error 
score. An examination of the answers given by grade IV students 
revealed that no students were able to define the words or to 
use them correctly in sentences. Further oral questioning of 
the children of this grade by their own teacher failed to dis¬ 
cover the existence of any actual knowledge of the words. 

Just how much of the knowledge score made in the different 
grades is actual knowledge and how much could result from 
guessing? In grade IV there was no actual knowledge and we note 
that K-E was equal to zero. Grade V children who claimed to have 
some knowledge of the words made a mean knowledge score in excess 
of their mean error score. Allowing an equal number of points 
for guessing in knowledge and in error scores and subtracting 
the error score from the knowledge score,we would have left the 
minimum knowledge content of the knowledge score. If the scores 
contain no element of guessing,the whole knowledge score repre¬ 
sents actual knowledge. This means the range of actual knowledge 
lies between K-E and K. For the different grades this range is 
as shown in the following table.

and error scores,it is obvious that the part of the knowledge 
score which results from guessing could not exceed the error 


score.

Tables 4, 5, and 6 show that the mean error score decreases as 

es, chronolc Leal age and mental age increase. This means the 
possible range of guessing is narrowing at upper grade and age 
levels. It follows th it the knowledge score at these higher grade 
and age levels is more and more indicative of actual knowledge and 
that at lower grade ind age levels the reverse is true, uenoe it 
is robable that the rate of increase in actual knowledge is greater 
than rate of increase shown bj the knowledge scores. 

THE ERROR SCORES 

It has been the aim of these tests to discover as nearly as 
possible the student's concept of words. To do this allowance has 
been made for the erroneous ideas connected with words by scoring 
separately. Error scores have been classified in the same three 
ways as the knowledge scores. Tables and graph's dealing with 
these scores follow.

Decrease in error by grades is practically uniform from grades VII 
to grade XII. The slight increase in error from grade VI to grade 
VII may result from Grade VII students attempting more questions 
than grade VI students. In grade VI the mean knowledge score plus 
the mean error score was 23.6 while in grade VII the sum of the 
same two scores was 29.3 Evidently grade VII students, on the 
average, tried for 5.7 more points than grade VI students. The 
0.4 points of error increase in grade VII could arise through the 
element of guessing entering in their attempt for the 5.7 
additional points. Grade VII actually tried for more points than 
grade IX. 

The increase in errors in the lower age intervals, 
chronological and mental, may have a similar explanation. 

Decrease in error by mental age seems somewhat more steady than 
decrease in error by chronological age. 

These error scores include actual error and guessing. 
Decrease in error scores probably shows decrease in both actual 
error and guessing. It is mbb inherent in these tests to measure 
actual knowledge or actual error apart from the element of guessing. 

THE KNOWLEDGE EBROR RATIO 

In discussing the knowledge scores it was pointed out that 
owing to the element of guessing, the increase in the knowledge 
score may not give a very accurate picture of actual knowledge 
increase. Suppose a student has a knowledge score of 15 and an 
error score of 11, there are only 4 points out of the 15 points 
for knowledge which are certain to reflect actual knowledge, ^ow 
if a student of the next higher grade has a score of 20 for 
knowledge and 8 for error, there are 12 certain points for knowledge 
present. Evidently the increase in actual knowledge could be 
300 per cent but considering ponly the recorded knowledge scores, 
the advance from 15 to 20 is only 33 l/3fo. How if in each case 
we divide the knowledge score by the corresponding error score, 
the knowledge—error ratio is in the first case 1.36 and in the 
second case 2.5, an increase of over 80 fo. Obviously the increase

in this knowledge—error ratio is a letter approximation to the 
truth concerning growth in actual knowledge than the increase in 
the hare knowledge scores. The data show; that knowledge scores 
increase and error scores decrease. From this it follows that 
the increase in X/E is a combined eff.ct of these two tendencies# 
Also decreasing error scores indicate decre.se in the element of 
guessing as well as decrease in actual error. Hence the tendency 
of the il/E ratio to increase points to a greater accuracy of word 
concepts. The mean knowledge—error ratios have been worked out 
for the different grades, and for chronological and mental age 
groups. The results are shown in the following tables and gra hs.

From grades VI to VIII the increase in IC/S is gradual. 

At the grade IX level there is a sharp increase and this is 
maintained up to grade XI. Grade XII shows a drop in il/E as 
compared with grade XI. There is a similar tendenc; in the 
behavior of X/JS in relation to increase in chronological age and 
mental age increases. This suggests that x/E is a ,'ower function 
of mental age, which would indicate that accuracy of knowledge is 
more closely related to mental age than to grades or chronological 
age. 

A considerable degree of reliability of the preceding 
results is indicated by the general agreement in the results 
obtained by Mr. LIcEachern and myself. It is observable that 
in general for the same groups the scores rise and fall together 
and in very many cases at approximately the same rates. Since 
the same students have shown such uniformity in scores on these 
two sets of tests, it would seem that these tests are measuring 
the same qualities and are doing so fairly reliably. ,The fact 
that the two tests were on different types of words, were not 
identical in structure and were scored by different people 
increases the significance of the corres ondence in results. 

At the grade IX level the science scores begin to diverge 
from the history scores. The interpretation of this seems to be 
that the formal teaching of science in High Seho.ol places more 
emphasis on a definite knowledge of words than the formal teaching 
of history does.

CHAPTER V 

A MORE DETAILED QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS 
Correct usage of words. 

The second question on every test asked the student to 
use the test word in a sentence in such a way as to show an under-- 
standing of the meaning of the word. The following table and 
graph shows the mean scores made by the different grades on this 
question.

The graph shows a marked increase from grade VI to grade 
VII, then a somewhat less hut uniform increase from grade VII 
to grade X, a slight increase from grade X to grade XI and then 
a very small dro from Grade XI to grade XII. There is obvious 
improvement in ability to use the words and in the higher 
grades practically all students are able to use the words 
correctly. 


Definitions 

The third question on every test called for as complete 
a definition of the word as the student could give. The per cent 
of correct definitions was recorded for each grade and correct 
definitions were further classified as good, fair, and weak. 

The table and graph showing the results of this analysis are 
given here.

Ability to define the words correctly increases steadily 
to grade X where a peak is reached. Grades XI and XII fall back 
slightly. Ability to give a good definition rises in agreement 
with ability to define. However, the peak here is in grade XI. 

The number of weak definitions decreases fairly uniformly. Majority 
of correct definitions are fair except in grade XI and there is only 
a slight tendency for fair definitions to decrease in number. 

This analysis shows that ability to define these words well is very 
low in Public School. Even in the High School grades students were 
under 50$ in their ability to give good definitions for the words. 
Grade XI were highest, having approximately 47$ of all definitions 
correct and good. 

It should be noted that in defining the words the students 
were obliged to create their own answers. Good definitions 
require considerable power of abstract thinking. Por this reason 
the scores made on this question are perhaps the best indication 
of increase in merit in abstract thinking. Growth in denotation 
is indicated by the increase in the percentage of correct definitions 
whereas growth in power of abstraction is perhaps more properly 
linked with the increase in the percentage of correct definitions 
which are rated good. ITo doubt other questions on the tests 
have also measured to some extent the qualities of denotation and 
abstraction, yet in my opinion this question brings out these 
qualities more specifically. 

Recognition of correct usage, correct selection 
of synonyms and a measure of connotation. 

In every test a question was included in which the test word 
was used in a number of sentences, in some cases correctly and in 
some cases incorrectly. The student was asked to mark each use as 
being correct or incorrect. The final mean per cent score for 
each grade was worked'out by taking the average of the mean per cent 
scores on the twelve words. Also on every test a question was 
given asking the student to select from a- list of words the word 
nearest in meaning to the test word. The final mean per cent score 

was worked out in the manner just described for obtaining the

correct usage scores. In order to obtain some measure of 
connotation one or more questions were selected from each test 
which seemed to measure this quality better than other questions on 
the test. A separate score w s obtained for connotation in the same 
way as for recognition of correct usage and selection of synonyms. 
Tables and graphs are given here. These graphs and the one 
showing percentage of students able to use the words correctly in 
a sentence are shown together for the purpose of comparison.

- 53 - 


It is obvious from these graphs that the ability of 
students to use words is greatly in excess of their ability to 
select synonyms, and their ability to recognize correct usage. 

An explanation of this might be that students gain much of their 
knowledge of words through using the words. The rates of increase 
in ability to select synonyms, to recognize co.-rect usage, and in 
richness of connotation show remarkable correspondence. The 
almost identical behavior of the connotation and recognition of 
correct usage scores suggests that recognition of correct usage 
involves to a very great degree the connotative element. These 
graphs as a whole seem to indicate that increasing mastery of 
meanings of words is a fairly parallel advance as far as the 
qualities here dealt with are concerned. 

CHAPTER VI 

ESTIMATION OR MATURITY 

One of the aims of this investigation was to determine 
growth in maturity. To do this some standard of maturity was 
required with which to compare the scores made by the students. 

A set of tests on the word "principle" was forwarded to Dr. M.E. 
Lazerte, director of the school of Education at the University 
of Alberta. Doctor Lazerte gave these tests to a senior 
University-class of thirty-nine students. The tests were returned 
and scored by myself on the same basis as for the younger students. 
The test on the word "principle" was one of the most difficult, for 
the students. The majority of the grades had their lowest mean 
score on this word. The following table gives the scores made on 
this v;ord by the different grades and includes the corresponding 
scores made by the university ©lass. A graph is given showing 
growth in knowledge from grade VI to university and the actual 
definitions are also included.

It is not assumed that the result of one test is reliable. 
Examination of table XVI shows that the trend of scores from 
grade VI to grade Xll on this word is somewhat erratic as com¬ 
pared to the mean scores for all the words. The most marked 
differences in the scores made by the university students are 
in the knowledge score,which is approximately six points higher 
than the best score made in High School,and in the ratings for 
definitions. In defining the words university students display 
a greater wealth of knowledge and a greater power to abstract. 
The zero scores made by grades V1,V11 and Vlll students on the 
question calling for a correct usage of the word and in the 
question calling for a definition of the word led me to think 
they might have confused "principle" with "principal 11 . To check 
this both these words were given to students of grades Vll and 
Vlll this term and they were asked to write out as full a def¬ 
inition as possible for each word, '..ithout exception the defin¬ 
itions given for the word "principle" were still incorrect,ie, 
the students merely defined the word "principal" twice varying 
the wording slightly. - reading of the definitions submitted by 
university students • shows that this error has persisted to a 
very marked degree. 

In the preceding graph the knowledge score made by the 
university class,though not a perfect score,has been considered

to be a maturity score and on that basis has been called 100 per cent. 

All the other knowledge scores have been workdd out as 
per cents of the university score or as per cents of maturity. The 
graph shows the relation of each grade to maturity as indicated by 
the university score. 


CHAPTER VII 
WORD ASSOCIATIONS . 

An attempt was made to elicit the students' knowledge of 
these words by another method. Eachone of the twelve test words 
was given orally and the students were asked to write down 
whatever words came into their minds. The first three words 
they wrote were recorded and arranged alphabetically with the 
per cent frequency of occurrence of each word in each grade. An 
analysis for one of these words is given here. Examination of it 
suggests that this type of testing is difficult to compare with 
the results of our main investigation. Probably a more complete 
investigation by this method would shed valuable light on what 
I have done by another method.

CRITICISMS, INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS. 

1. The tests,in being written,were subject to certain 
limitations. Firstly the student's responses could 
not be followed up to discover the breadth and depth 
of knowledge he possessed on the point in question. 
Secondly,the effects of guessing could not be elim¬ 
inated. Thirdly,the test wa,s partly a test of reading 
and ability to make written answers. 

2. Although it was difficult to separate such qualities 
as denotation,connotation,and power of abstraction,yet 

we think it is possible to extract from the tests certain 
measures of these qualities. 

3. Certain questions such as calling for other forms of 
the word were found to elicit little information of 
value. 

4. Some of the questions were not sufficiently apt in 
that they did not bring out the wanted knowledge. 

5. Certain questions tended to be ambiguous in that in 
spite of careful forethought some unexpected responses 
were given and these were difficult to score. 

6. We sought to avoid bias by colla.bora.ting in the con¬ 
struction of the tests and in consideration of possible 
responses. 

7. A reference to the tables showing numbers of students 
discloses that the sampling varied as between groups 
and was possibly too small. 

8. There is a likelihood that the different meanings,uses, 
connotations,etc. did not receive emphasis proportionate 
to their importance. 

9. The tests were uniform for all students. 

10. Tests were deliberately made sufficiently easy to bring 
out any knowledge possessed and sufficiently difficult 
and comprehensive to call forth the fullest knowledge of 
even the best students.

11. -Evidence that the t sts were sufficiently oomprehei give was 
found in that students seldom gave information beyimd that 
specifically called for when as..ed to do so in the final 
question. Ural questioning after the tests were written 
revealed a similar result. 

12. YJe feel that the remarkable correspondence in the results 
of the two sets of tests, as previously noted, is evidence 
that these tests though not standardized, possess considerable 
reliability. 

INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS. 

Certain local conditions such as small number of students 
tested,, predominence of foreign language influence especially in 
the lower grades and the possible effect of local teaching may 
have given a bias to the results of these tests. Although the 
tests have tested directly only twelve words, yet indirectly they 
have tested a considerable range of vocabulary. The tests were 
not completely objective since the subjective element may have 
influenced the scoring of the definitions, etc. 

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS 

1. Knowledge of the words tested increase by grades, mental age, 
and chronological age. Judging from the results, knowledge of 
words proceeds most in accord with mental age, nest by grades and 
least by chronological age. 

2. Error decreases in the same order that knowledge increases. 

3. From a comparison of the results of the two investigations, there 
seems to be less error associated with science words than with 
history words even though the lower groups begin with approximately 
the same amount of knowledge. 

4. It is likely that growth of knowledge and decrease of error 
are more pronounced at certain periods. Possible plateaiis may 
occur at senior Public and Senior High Scnool levels. 

5. Knowledge of words is more extensive and more accurate in 
later years of adolescence.

6. Ability to use words is in advance of ability to 
recognize correct usage,to select synonyms and to 
define words. 

7. Erroneous concepts associated with words are consid¬ 
erable and have a tendency to persist. 

8. Teaching of history especially and of science to a 
lesser degree has apparently failed to sufficiently 
clarify for the students the meanings of the words 
employed in the respective subjects. 

9. The tests suggest the possibility of constructing 
a normal curve of growth of knowledge of words for 
all school grades.
