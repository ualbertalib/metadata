THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA 


A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE PREDICTIVE EFFICIENCY OF 
TWO TESTS OF CLERICAL APTITUDE 


A DISSERTATION 

SUBMITTED TO THE SCHOOL OF GRADUATE STUDIES 
IN PARTIAL FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE 
OF MASTER OF EDUCATION

SEPTEMBER, 1952 



SYNOPSIS 


The main purpose of this investigation was the 
evaluation of two clerical aptitude tests as predic¬ 
tors of success in typewriting, bookkeeping and ste¬ 
nography. The criterion scores were the final marks 
assigned to the students in these three commercial 
subjects. The clerical tests were administered to 
first-year commercial students in Victoria Composite 
High School in Edmonton, Western Canada High School 
in Calgary, and Lethbridge Collegiate in Lethbridge. 
The coefficients of correlation between the test 
scores and the final marks served as a basis for the 
analysis. One test for reliability and five tests 
for the evaluation of the coefficients were made. 

Although the coefficients were considered to be 
too low for effective prediction of individual scores 
it was concluded that these clerical aptitude tests 
would be of value in group prediction, especially with 
a heterogeneous group.

CHAPTER I 


THE PROBLEM 

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND 

In step with industrial development clerical work 
has grown tremendously in importance during the past 
century* According to Edward®s summary of United States 
Census figures, as listed by Bennett and Cruikshank 1 , In 
1870 there were about 82,000 workers engaged incclerical 
occupations, while in 1940 there were over 4,000,000 * 

About ± 6 % of the skilled labor group in America hold 
clerical positions* This vast demand for clerical and, of¬ 
fice staffs has been intensified by the increasingly com¬ 
plex economic structure of modern society. The gradual 
trend towards more government regulation of industry, new 
social security programs, unemployment insurance, workmen’s 
compensation, new wage-hour regulations, and marked growth 
of activity in the field of taxation—all these have 
brought new demands for skilled clerical employees of vary¬ 
ing degrees of ability. 

The increased complexity of clerical work and the 
greater range of jobs have made correct selection of em¬ 
ployees a difficult but essential matter. As a result, 
efforts have been made to secure more satisfactory 
differentiation of the abilities and capacities encountered 
in the increasingly varied categories of clerical employ¬ 


ment 


. 






- 2 - 


Bingham 2 classifies the abilities involved in cler¬ 
ical work as: 

1* perceptual - to observe words and numbers cor¬ 
rectly, 

2. intellectual - to grasp the meanings of words 

and symbols and to make decisions, 

3. mental skills - improved by special training- 

adding, multiplying, spelling, 
punctuating, 

4. motor - manipulation of office tools—pencils, 

office machines, 

Bingham^ states that too often it is implied that 
the term ‘aptitude® has reference to a person® s native 
endowments only, or to a natural bent. What are really 
wanted are the facts about a person® s capacities as they 
are at present, both innate and acquired, insofar as they 
are indicative of his future potentialities. 

One of the main methods devised for the prediction 
of success in clerical occupations was the clerical ap¬ 
titude test. Ml. number of problems have faced and are 
still facing test-makers. What constitutes a good cler¬ 
ical aptitude test? Can clerical abilities be measured 
with any degree of precision? 

What is needed are aptitude tests in the high 
school, and later in university and in the business 
world. Twenty years ago the counselling of students at

the high school level was almost entirely limited to 
decisions as to what academic subjects were most suit¬ 
able for the individual. With the growth of composite 
high schools the need for vocational guidance has be¬ 
come more important than ever. Naive guidance has been 
practised for years. Each time a teacher has passed or 
failed a child he has to some extent been predicting his 
future success or failure. Today medical, nursing, 
dentistry, law and engineering faculties are concerned 
with the effective selection of their student groups. 
Employers in business and industry seek to choose their 
employees wisely. The school guidance officer is con¬ 
tinuously concerned with good vocational counselling of 
students. All are eager to use aptitude tests if reli¬ 
able instruments can be found. This is especially true 
in the selection and training of clerical workers where 
tremendous waste occurs through the training and employ¬ 
ment of persons who are not fitted for tasks undertaken. 

Many clerical aptitude tests have been developed. 
Some, such as the Turse Shorthand Aptitude Test, attempt 
to predict success in predise areas of commercial work. 
Others, such as the Detroit Clerical Aptitides Examina¬ 
tions, seek to predict the suitability of candidates for 
the general area of clerical employment.

EVOLUTION OF TESTS OF CLERICAL APTITUDE 

Bennett and Cruikshank^ state that clerical tests 
have been in use during the last thirty years. The first 
tests resembled in some degree those currently used in 
the measurement of individual differences in sensory and 
psychomotor abilities, the appraisal of intelligence, and 
the differentiation of the feebleminded from the normal. 
These same authors add, "Since a considerable portion of 
clerical work utilizes the verbal and numerical abilities 
necessary for school success the academic aptitude or 
’general intelligence tests’ are often fairly good pre¬ 
dictors, Little gain has resulted from the use of psy¬ 
chometer and sensory tests. Performance and worksample 
tests, including such skills as typewriting, shorthand, 
and bookkeeping, have been used almost from the beginning 
of clerical testing. The relative ease of measuring cer¬ 
tain actual clerical skills as well as the mental attrib¬ 
utes used in many clerical tasks has been in large part 
responsible for the early expansion of clerical testing," 

Information about early test-makers and their prod¬ 
ucts has been summarized by Bennett and Cruikshank^. 

They state that J. E, Lough in 1912,and J. M. Lahy in 
1913 $ made studies related to prediction of typewriting 
skill. A Professor Muensterberg studied the selection

of clerical workers, using a battery of tests which ex¬ 
plored efficiency in the free association of ideas, at¬ 
tention, word completion, sentence completion, word 
building, choosing opposites, reasoning the rule for the 
construction of a group of letters, and sentence arrange¬ 
ment* In 1919 H. C* Link, using procedures similar to 
those employed today devised a test to select clerical 
workers* His method was to have his test administered 
to employed clerical workers and to compare the results 
with ratings of the employees as assigned by supervisors* 
Other studies of the selection of clerical workers were 
made by L* L. Thurstone who in 1919 published a test 
called H A Standardized Test for Clerical Workers* M 

Clerical aptitude tests from this time have been 
based a great deal upon earlier tests* Revisions have 
been made in content of tests and in methods of scoring, 
but basically testing procedures are the same today as 
they were twenty-five years ago. 

PROBLEM 

With the tremendous increase in modern times in 
the number and variety of positions calling for clerical 
ability it is obvious that a more scientific approach to 
the problem of selection must be made. Much has been 
done both in defining the abilities and capacities

emphasis on their value as guidance instruments used in 
the prediction of the success of prospective commercial

CHAPTER II 


THE TESTING OF CLERICAL APTITUDES 
MAJOR TESTS OF CLERICAL APTITUDE 

Buros^ has given critical reviews of a number of 
tests widely used in the screening of candidates for 
clerical training and employment,, Some of these are 
called 'aptitude tests'; some have the word 'clerical' 
included in the title; others merely indicate by the 
similarity of content to aptitude tests that they could 
be used as clerical aptitude tests. Bennett and Gruik- 
shank^ have reviews of a number of tests which are not 
included in the Buros list. 

As the subtests in each of the major tests are 
difficult to categorize a simple classification in 
terms of the number of subtests may serve our purpose. 

1. Tests having not more than four subsections: 

a. Clerical Aptitude Test : A.Kobal, J. W. Wright- 

stone, K. R. Kunze; Acorn Publishing Co.,

THE NEED FOR A CRITICAL STUDY OF 
CLERICAL APTITUDE TESTS 


Many tests have been published since Lough® s and 
Lahy f s first studies^ in 1912 and 1913 respectively* 
While tests such as the Minnesota Clerical Test and 
the Detroit Clerical Aptitudes Examination have com¬ 
paratively good records of reliability and validity, 
the majority include in their manuals little or no in¬ 
formation as to their value as predictors of success or 
failure in commercial schools or in employment*

Edwin K # Taylor writes, "If * paper and pencil 1 tests 
are to serve any useful purpose in the field of indus¬ 
trial psychology a considerable amount of research must 
necessarily precede their publication." Ethel A. 
Rollinson' 1 ’ 0 comments, "But today our ardor has cooled 
somewhat, for prognostic tests in commercial subjects 
have not reached the degree of reliability we had 
hoped for." 

The problems to be investigated in this study are 
twofold. 

1. How does one of the more representative tests em¬ 

ploying many component subtests compare in efficiency 
in prediction of clerical success with a test contain¬ 
ing few subtests? 

2. Is a test requiring considerably more time for 
administration significantly more efficient than the 
shorter test? 

REASONS FOR CHOOSING THE N.I.I.P. AND 
MINNESOTA CLERICAL APTITUDE TESTS 

The types of tests desired for use in this study 
were ones which would be of sufficient length to offer 
some challenge to the students and yet short enough to 
be administered within the regular classroom period. 

Another aim was to have two tests which differed 
as much as possible in component parts and the time

required for administration. This decision was based 
on the desire to see how shorter tests with few sub- 
tests wotild compare with longer tests containing a 
larger number of more or less heterogeneous subdi¬ 
visions. 

These requisites were both met in the tests selec¬ 
ted. The Minnesota Clerical Test has Just two subtests, 
one involving the checking of numbers and the other the 
checking of names. The N.I.I.P. Clerical Test, on the 
other hand, contains seven subdivisions—oral, classi¬ 
fication, arithmetic, copying, filing, and problems— 
each requiring from two to five minutes for administration. 

RESEARCH FINDINGS ON THE N.I.I.P. CLERICAL TEST AND 
THE MINNESOTA CLERICAL TEST 

Few studies have been reported about the reliability 
of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test. Bennett and Gruikshank 11 
report the results obtained from the use of this test in 
predicting the clerical proficiency of student assistants 
in library work. Forty-six men and twenty-three women 
students who had taken the test were rated for library 
performance. Table I (see page 15 ) shows the correlation 
between subtests of the clerical test and library ratings 
and college grades. The mimeographed manual for the 
N.I.I.P. Clerical Test gives two tables of norms based 
on the results of this test when administered to 1000 
high school and college students.

Mr* R* B. Selover, Personnel Chief of the Prudential 

12 

Insurance Company, N* Y., states that it is not probable 
that seven separate abilities are measured by the sub¬ 
tests, although several abilities are probs/bly sampled* 

He also suggests that the subtests are probably too short 
to be used independently* His main criticism is that the 
predictive efficiency of this test was apparently arrived 
at by arbitrarily selecting subtests and adding together 
scores on the separate tasks without reference to either 
the relationships of the subtests or the relationships 
between the subtests and the criterion data* Mr* Selover 
reaches the conclusion that the test could be improved by 
the careful selection of fewer subtests of greater length* 
In commenting on clerical tests in general Mr* Selover 
states, ”—the clerical test, used alone or in combination 
with intelligence tests, can do no more than serve as a 
guide toward or away from clerical occupations as a group*” 

MINNESOTA CLERICAL TEST 

Edwin K Taylor, Chief, Performance Evaluation and 
Criterion Research Unit, Personnel Research Section, 
Adjutant-General’s Office, Washington, D* C*, offers 
criticisms^ of the Minnesota test which may be summarized 
as follows: two subtests involving number and name check¬ 
ing seem inadequate as an exclusive basis on which to se-

lect clerical workers. Data concerning validity is of 
dubious value since the test is essentially a speed test 
and the samples are too small. Since validity is the 
crucial factor in determining the usefulness of a test, 
the research concerning this particular test is inade¬ 
quate because there is a lack of acceptable data. 

In Table II below various studies of the reliability 
and validity of the Minnesota Clerical Test are summa¬ 
rized. Coefficients of correlation between personal his¬ 
tory ratings, supervisors 1 and combined ratings and the 
Minnesota Clerical Test (total scores) are given in 
Table III. Personal history ratings were based on edu¬ 
cation, clerical experience, commercial training, and age 
at leaving highest school grade. The validity coefficients 
show the degrees of relationship of the Minnesota Clerical 
Test (total scores) with marks obtained by various types 
of clerical workers. Table III shows the relationship 
of the Minnesota Clerical Test with other clerical ap¬ 
titude tests. 

In a further study of the validity of the Minnesota 
Clerical Test Ghiselli 14 gives a comparison of it with 
the Employment Service General Battery test. The results 
of his study are summarized In Table IV. 

Dorothy M. Andrew 1 -^ co-author of the Minnesota 
Clerical Test has made further studies of the test, not

to produce further evidence for the reliability and 
validity of the test, but to find out what abilities 
the clerical test measures, and what abilities it is 
independent of when applied to a homogeneous group of 
clerical workers. She used six main tests including 
the Minnesota Clerical Test, and eight special tests 
dealing with such things as spelling, letter cancel¬ 
lation and substitution. Correlational analysis seems 
to indicate that this test battery measured at least 
four relatively independent abilities—academic, cler¬ 
ical, spatial, and digital dexterity.

CONCLUSIONS 

The criticisms of the tests reviewed in this chap¬ 
ter indicate a number of serious faults. The samples 
are usually too small to justify confidence in the ob¬ 
tained coefficients of reliability and validity. H. J. 
Moore has used the scores of only one thousand students 
to establish norms for the N.I.I.P* Clerical Test. Most 
of the reliability and validity coefficients of the 
Minnesota Clerical Test were based on samples of fewer 
than one hundred persons* 

Number checking and name checking in the Minnesota. 
Clerical Test are similar and have no apparent relation¬ 
ships with such clerical activities as typewriting or 
stenography. The N.I.I.P. Clerical Test, on the other 
hand, has a variety of subtests, but greater length is 
required in each one to secure a more complete and re¬ 
liable estimation of the clerical abilities being tested*

CHAPTER III 


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 

THE SAMPLE 

The first step in evaluating the two tests of cler¬ 
ical aptitude was to secure a sample of 200 commercial 
high school students in Grades X and XI. This number, 
it was felt, would be large enough to test satisfactori¬ 
ly the predictive efficiency of the tests, and yet not 
so large as to be unwieldy. The number of schools in the 
province having classes taking typewriting, bookkeeping, 
and stenography is relatively small. Even though such 
classes might easily have been obtained in either Cal¬ 
gary or Edmonton it was felt that the more random group 
preferable for such a study should be secured from as 
large a number of centers as possible. It was finally 
decided that the sample should be drawn from the com¬ 
mercial sections of three schools—Victoria Composite 
High School in Edmonton, Western Canada High School in 
Calgary, and Lethbridge Collegiate in Lethbridge. The 
students were to have no other experience in commercial 
work beyond that which might have been obtained in the 
typewriting option in Grade IX. 







22 


In regard to sample the original plan was to have 
eighty-five students from each of' Calgary and Edmonton 
and the remaining thirty from Lethbridge, 

The tests were to have been administered in Sep¬ 
tember, 1950* However, delays in receiving the tests 
and in having them administered resulted in a post¬ 
ponement until the following spring* While it is true 
that the tests might better have been administered in 
advance of training in commercial subjects, it is not 
believed that training affected the results materially* 
The manual for the Minnesota. Clerical Test explains the 
effect of commercial training as follows: ,5 When two 
groups were tested before and after commercial train¬ 
ing, there was no gain in the second testing as com¬ 
pared with the first test beyond the normal practice 
effect obtained in the control groups. Thus the Min¬ 
nesota Clerical Test fulfills the requirements of an 
aptitude test in that training and experience do not 
seem to exert any large or specific effect on test 
scores * H 

Following the administration and marking of the 
tests correlations were to be made in the following 
ways: 


(a) Total scores (number score plus name score) 




- 23 - 


of the Minnesota Clerical Test with final 
school marks in typewriting, bookkeeping^ 
and stenography,,,,..3 correlations 

(b) Total scores (seven subdivisions) of N,I,I,P, 
Clerical Test with final school marks in 
typewriting, bookkeeping, and stenography 

..,.. ,,,,, 3 correlations 

(c) Scores of each of seven subdivisions of 

N.I,I.P, Clerical Test with final school 

marks in typewriting, bookkeeping and ,, 

Stenography...., , Zl correlations 

27 correlations 

It was intended that I*Q„ ratings should be cor¬ 
related with final marks in the three commercial sub¬ 
jects to see how intelligence scores compared with 
clerical aptitude test scores. 

The Ontario College of Education correlation 
sheets were chosen because they were of sufficient 
size, suitable for ink work, and contained the print¬ 
ed mathematical formulas ready for insertion of data. 

The obtained coefficients of correlation were then 
to be tested for significance and evaluated as to use¬ 
fulness in predicting success for individuals in type¬ 
writing, bookkeeping and stenography. 

Actual plans were altered slightly in various

stages of the study. As has been mentioned, the tests 
were administered in the spring of 1951 instead of in 
September, 195°• The population was ultimately made 
up of 18 from Lethbridge (6 rejected), 101 from Edmon¬ 
ton (4 rejected), and 84 (21 rejected) from Calgary. 

The I.Q. ratings were not used because the variety of 
intelligence tests involved presented the problem of 
converting the I.Q. ratings to a comparable basis. For 
this reason this part of the study was abandoned. While 
the findings might have had value, they were not too 
closely related to the problem under study. 

The obtained coefficients of correlation between 
the predictors and the criterion scores were then eval¬ 
uated. First, each r had to be tested for the signif¬ 
icance of its departure from zero. Then, in the case 
of the significant coefficients it was necessary to de¬ 
termine their efficiency in the prediction of individual 
success in commercial work. The methods used and an ex¬ 
planation of each one are given below. 

1. Testing the Reliability of a Coefficient of Correlation 
Against the Null Hypothesis 

The significance of a correlation coefficient is 
tested by ascertaining whether it is sufficiently large 
to warrant the conclusion that it is not the result of

sampling errors. The formula which is used is 

r-, -- 18 

t' J bJ-Zs 

t s — -- — — where r is the obtained coefficient 

and N represents the number of cases. Tables are also 
available giving the size which a coefficient must at¬ 
tain to be regarded as significantly different from 
zero. For example, suppose we have an N of 202 and an 
r of .187 . The table indicates that for 200 degrees 
of freedom the minimum size of coefficient to attain 
significance at the .05 level is .138 and at the .01 
level .181 . This means that only five times in 100 
trials would an r of .138 appear through accidents of 
sampling if the population r were actually .00, and 
only once in 100 trials would an r of .181 appear if 
population r were .00 . The r in our example would be 
significant at the .05 level and barely significant at 
the .01 level.

The coefficients of correlation of two variables 
serve little purpose unless they can be made intelli¬ 
gible to the average reader. For this reason the writer 

19 

uses five different devices suggested by Garrett for 
making coefficients more meaningful.

a. Verbal Description 

An r from .00 to .20 denotes negligible relationship. 

An r from .20 to .40 denotes slight relationship. 

An r from .40 to .70 denotes substantial relationship. 

An r from .70 to 1.00 denotes high to very high rela¬ 

tionship. 

b. Standard Error of Estimate 

This method enables us to tell how accurately we 
can estimate an individual’s score in Test X if we 
know his score in Test Y. The size of x) depends 
directly upon <Tx and the correlation between the two 
tests. The formula is = <XxY I - # 

As an example of its use, if an r of .187 and a CT 'x 
of +; 15*29 are substituted in the formula the (T^tn) 

is +15.015 • This means that the chances are two in 

three that the prediction does not miss the true 
score by more than ± 15.015 » Obviously such a range 
would render individual prediction impossible. 

c. Coefficient of Alienation 

This coefficient really measures the absence of 
relationship between two variables, a large coefficient 
showing a small degree of association. The formula is 

t 20 

K ~ V / - r x . Garrett points out that an r of 
.87 is required to give a k of .50 which gives one

approximately the same predictive efficiency in 
dealing with individuals as would be achieved if 
one were to resort to guessing. 

d. The Coefficient of Dependability 

The formula £ = / -Y' / - t*- - I - K is directly re¬ 
lated to the formula for the coefficient of alien¬ 
ation. It may be changed to percentage by multi¬ 
plying by 100. If r is .50 then k is .8? and E 
is . 13 , indicating 13 $ efficiency in individual 
prediction. 

e. Coefficient of Determination 

This test was used on the Minnesota Clerical 
Test (total scores) and the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test 
(total scores) only. This coefficient indicates 
the extent to which the variance of one test is 
related to the variance in the other test and is 

expressed by the formula . 

2 — 

If cTjS/yj is subtracted from c/'“y, there remains 
that part of the variance of Test Y which is asso¬ 
ciated with Test X; and if this value is divided 
by <3~~y that fraction of the variance of Test Y 
attributable to or associated with Test X is ob¬ 


tained

A more simple method of obtaining the coeffi¬ 
cient of determination is to square r. For example, 
if the coefficient of correlation is .322 the co¬ 
efficient of determination is .322^ or .104 . Hence 
an r of .322 means that .104 or 10.4 % of the vari¬ 
ance of the one test may be attributed to the variance 
of the other test. 

The tests of significance and the various means 
of evaluation of the coefficients of correlation may 
be summarized briefly. 

1. In testing the reliability of a coefficient of 
correlation against the null hypothesis one is test¬ 
ing to see if the r is large enough to indicate a 
true relationship between the variables and that it 
is not the mere product of errors in sampling. 

2. Verbal description is merely the placement of 
the coefficients in simple but meaningful categories. 

3. The standard error of estimate shows the extent 
to which a prediction based on an obtained r will 
vary on either side of the true score. 

4o The coefficient of alienation indicates how 

much two variables lack relationship. For example, 
when r is ,60 k is .80 which indicates little re¬ 
lationship between the two variables. 

5. The coefficient of dependability shows a test*s 



■ vi 




V 



- 29 - 


efficiency in predicting criterion scores. An r 
of less than .90 makes the tests valueless for 
individual prediction. 

6. The coefficient of determination tells what 
part of the variance of one test is determined by 
the variance in the other test. 

7. The problem of evaluating the relationship 
indicated by a coefficient of correlation between 
a predictor and a criterion score involves under¬ 
standing the influence of the size and the varia¬ 
bility of the samples. 

Since the students taking commercial work in 
Alberta high schools are to some degree a selected 
group it was felt that a chapter dealing with the 
influence of the homogeneity of a sample on the 
size of a correlation coefficient between predic¬ 
tor and criterion scores must be included. This 
chapter follows the statistical portion of this 
study and precedes the chapter on conclusions.

CHAPTER IV 


THE PREDICTIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE MINNESOTA CLERICAL TEST 

FOR TYPEWRITING, BOOKKEEPING AND STENOGRAPHY 

INTRODUCTION 

The Minnesota Clerical Test yields two subtest scores, 
one in number checking, the other in name checking. To 
evaluate the predictive efficiency of the entire test the 
two scores were added and the sums correlated with the 
final marks of students in their first year of study of 
typewriting, bookkeeping, and stenography. To obtain a 
satisfactory basis on which to compare the Minnesota Cler¬ 
ical Test and the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test the total scores 
of subtests In each case were correlated with final marks 
in the three commercial subjects, and population samples 
were identical for corresponding correlations. 

For ease of computation of the correlation coefficients 
the Ontario College of Education sheets were used. A sam¬ 
ple computation is shown in Appendix A. Three checks were 
made of the scattergrams, on the jjfx, iffy, and £xy. 

Table VI shows the coefficients of correlation ob¬ 
tained when the Minnesota Clerical Test measures (total 
scores) were correlated with final marks in typewriting, 
bookkeeping and stenography.

THE RELIABILITY OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 
The reliabilities of the coefficients of correla¬ 
tion were tested against the null hypothesis to see if 
they departed significantly from zero. The results of 

this test appear in Table VII. In testing the relia- 

r ) u - ^ 

bility of the coefficients the formula t - 

was used. This determines whether the obtained r is 

due to fluctuations in random sampling or x^hether there 

is a definite relationship between the two variables. 

The values for N and r are substituted in the formula 

21 

and the answer is then checked by means of a table 
showing the minimum value for which r attains signif¬ 
icance. The .05 and .01 levels of significance are 
given. When the Minnesota Clerical Test (total scores) 
was correlated with typewriting the r was .187 . 

Table VII shows that to achieve significance a coeffi¬ 
cient of .138 is necessary at the .05 level and .181 
at the .01 level. This means that only five times in 
100 trials would an r of .138 appear by accident if the 
population r were actually .00, and only once in 100 
trials would an r of .181 appear by chance if the popu¬ 
lation r were .00 . A coefficient of correlation of 
.187 with 200 degrees of freedom is therefore signifi¬ 
cant at the .05 level and barely significant at the .01 
level. As is shown in Table VII the other two coeffi-

cients are either barely significant or not significant 
at all. All are so low as to be valueless for the pre¬ 
diction of individual success in commercial subjects. 

EVALUATION OF THE OBTAINED COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 
22 

Garrett explains five different methods of eval¬ 
uating coefficients of correlation. They are outlined 
below. 

1. Verbal Description 

The coefficients obtained when the Minnesota Cler¬ 
ical Test (total scores) was correlated with final marks 
in typewriting, bookkeeping, and stenography were .187» 
.151, and .059 respectively. These are all below .200 
and hence denote negligible relationship between the 
variables in each case. 

2. Standard Error of Estimate 

This tells how accurately one can estimate an indi¬ 
vidual* s score in one test when his score in another test 
is known. When values for r and x are substituted in 
the formula 1 ~ the standard error of esti¬ 

mate is obtained. In Table VIII It is seen that a co¬ 
efficient of .18? and a (fx of il5*29 results In a (fTTrx 
of£5.015 • This means that the chances are about two 
in three that the predicted score does not miss the true 
score by more than£5•015 * This also means that the

v;sl J:\: v

) 






- 35 - 


range of estimation is 30.03 scale points, which is far 
too great* for satisfactory prediction. The other stand¬ 
ard errors of estimate shown in Table VIII are also too 
large to be of use, 

3, The Coefficient of Alienation, as was shown earlier 

(page 26 ) is really a measure of the absence of rela¬ 
tionship between two variables. As larger values for r 
are substituted in the formula A = - r" the value 

of k will decrease. A coefficient of correlation of 
.870 is required to achieve a k of .500 ® This means 
that there would be a relationship of $0% between the 
variables in the test. High coefficients of correla¬ 
tion, and conversely, low coefficients of alienation 
are necessary for satisfactory prediction. Such k f s 

as .982, .989 and ,998, which are the coefficients of 
alienation resulting when the Minnesota Clerical Test 
was correlated with final marks in typewriting, book¬ 
keeping, and stenography, show that the clerical test 
and the commercial subjects have very little relation¬ 
ship. 

4. The Coefficient of Dependability (E) is obtained by 
the formula E r 1 - k, in which k is the coefficient 
of alienation. An r of . 50 , when transmuted, results 
in a k of .87 and an E of .13 • The test*s efficiency 
at prediction of criterion scores is said to be 13 $.

The correlation of the Minnesota Clerical Test (total 
scores) with the final marks in bookkeeping resulted 



in an r of *151 ♦ 


.989 . The coefficient of dependability is 1 - *989, 
or .011 . When this is converted to percent by multi¬ 
plying by 100 the predictive efficiency becomes 1.1$, 
which is negligible. When typewriting and stenography 
marks are the criterion scores the coefficients of de¬ 
pendability are respectively .018 and .002, and show 
further that the Minnesota Clerical Test has little 
value as a predictive instrument in dealing with indi¬ 
vidual scores. Table IX shows the obtained coeffi¬ 
cients of alienation and dependability for both the 
Minnesota and the N.I.I.P. clerical tests. The Minne¬ 
sota test figures appear in Row 1, and the correspond¬ 
ing statistics for the N.I.I.P. test appear in the 
subsequent rows. 

5. The Coefficient of Determination shonrs the extent 
to which the variance of one test is determined by the 
variance in another test, and is obtained by merely 
squaring the coefficient of correlation. The r of 
.151 (Minnesota Clerical Test total scores vs. final 
marks in bookkeeping) when squared becomes .02 .

keeping marks may be attributed to the variance in 
the Minnesota Clerical Test, which indicates a slight 
degree of relationship* 

CONCLUSION 

1. While the three correlation figures are positive, 

and two are significantly greater than zero, all prove 
upon examination nearly valueless in estimating a 
score in one variable for the corresponding score in 
the other variable*

CHAPTER V 


THE PREDICTIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE N.I.I.P. CLERICAL TEST 
FOR TYPEWRITING, BOOKKEEPING, AND STENOGRAPHY 

INTRODUCTION 

To secure an evaluation of the predictive efficiency 
of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test its total score was correlated 
in turn with the final marks of students in typewriting, 
bookkeeping, and stenography. Table X summarizes the re¬ 
sults

SIGNIFICANCE OF COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 


- 41 - 






































- 42 ~ 


With 200 degrees of freedom r* s of the order of .138 
at the .05 level and .181 at the .01 level are required 
for significance. Table XI shows that the coefficients 
of correlation are all above the minimum t values and 
thus do have significance. 

EVALUATION OF THE OBTAINED COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 

The coefficients were evaluated in the same manner 
as were those in Chapter IV. 

1. Coefficients of the order of .322, .341 denote low 
relationships between predictor and criterion marks, 
while .547 may be designated as indicating a substantial 
association. 

2. The standard errors of estimate of the coefficients 
of correlation between the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test (total 
scores) and final marks in typewriting, bookkeeping, and 
stenography are shown in Table VIII to be 14.475, 14.194, 
and 15.736 . If the smallest of these, 14.194, is taken 
as an example it may be shown that the predicted score 
may have a range of 28.388 about the true score in 68 % 

of the cases and an even greater range in the remaining 
32^. The range of estimation is far too great for sat¬ 
isfactory prediction of individual scores. 

3. The r 1 s of .322, .341, and .547 give coefficients 
of alienation of .947, .940, and .837 respectively when 
the formula k=/l - r^” is used. A coefficient of alien- 





- 43 - 


ation of .837 indicates a low degree of relationship 
between the two variables, thus rendering ineffective 
any attempt at individual prediction, 

4. Table IX shows that a coefficient of .547 results 
in a very low coefficient of dependability. An r of 
.547 has only 16,3$ efficiency in predicting an indi¬ 
vidual* s true score. The coefficients .322 are .341 
are only 5*3% and 6.0$ efficient in prediction of an 
individual*s true score. 

5. The coefficients of determination are all low. 

As these coefficients may be obtained by squaring r 

the coefficients of determination for r*s of .322, .341, 
and .547 are .104, .116, and .299 respectively. Con¬ 
verted to percentages they are 10.4$, 11.6$, and 29. 9 %, 
and indicate the extent to which variance in marks in 
typewriting, bookkeeping, and stenography respectively 
may be attributed to variances in the N.I.I.P. Clerical 
Test (total scores). The relationship between the var¬ 
iances of this clerical test and the criterion scores 
is very low. 

CONCLUSIONS 

1, When tested against the null hypothesis the cor¬ 

relations of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test (total scores) 
have more significance than those of the Minnesota

Clerical Test when correlated with the same criterion 
scores. This means that they have a greater departure 
from zero than those of the Minnesota test and are more 
certain of not being the result of mere accidents in 
sampling. 

2. The N.I.I.P. Clerical Test should be a better pre¬ 
dictor of individual success in the abilities tested, 
especially in stenography for which the highest r (.54?) 
was obtained. 

3. The standard errors of estimate obtained when the 
N.I.I.P. Clerical Test was correlated with typewriting, 
bookkeeping, and stenography are smaller than those ob¬ 
tained when correlation was made with the Minnesota 
Clerical Test and the same criterion scores. However, 
they are still so great as to ma.ke prediction ineffec¬ 
tual . 

4. The coefficients of alienation and dependability 
indicate that reliable prediction of individual scores 
in any of the three commercial subjects is highly im¬ 
probable .

CHAPTER VI 


THE PREDICTIVE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPONENT PARTS OF 
THE N.I.I.P. CLERICAL TEST 
INTRODUCTION 

The subtests of the Minnesota Clerical Test were 
not correlated with any criterion scores. It was felt 
that number checking and name checking are much alike 
and that the total of these two subtests as correlated 
with final marks in typewriting, bookkeeping, and ste¬ 
nography would be sufficient to indicate their respec¬ 
tive values. 

The N.I.I.P, Clerical Test, however, has seven sub¬ 
tests, all quite different in character. They are oral, 
classification, arithmetic, copying, checking, filing, 
and problems. Because of their dissimilarity the scores 
of each of these subtests were correlated with the fi¬ 
nal ma.rks of the three commercial subjects mentioned. 
Table XII gives the results of this portion of the study. 

RELIABILITY OF THE COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 

The reliability of the coefficients of each of the 
subtests was tested against the null hypothesis. 

Table XIII reveals that the arithmetic subtest is the 
only one having all the coefficients significant at both 
the .05 level and the .01 level. The copying subtest 
was the poorest, having no coefficients large enough to 
be significant.

EVALUATION OF THE OBTAINED COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION 

1* Coefficients of correlation between .00 and .20 are 

classed by Garrett 2 ^ as indicating negligible relation¬ 
ships between the variables correlated. In the N.I.I.P. 
Clerical Test subtests there are thirteen in this cate¬ 
gory. Between .20 and .40 the coefficients are desig¬ 
nated as having slight relationship. Eight fall in 
this category. 

2. Table VIII shows that the smallest standard error 
of estimate, 14.436, was obtained when the arithmetic 
subtest was correlated with final marks in bookkeeping. 
As has been shown previously, the resulting range of 
estimation is twice the standard error of estimate. It 
is obvious in this case that a range of scores of 28.872 
scale points is too great to permit satisfactory pre¬ 
diction of individual scores. The other standard errors 
of estimate are even larger and hence are more liable to 
lead to erroneous prediction. 

3. The coefficients of alienation are all high. The 
highest coefficient of correlation, .343, when substi¬ 
tuted in the formula k*/l - r^, gave a coefficient of 
alienation of .937 . This means that there is little 
relationship between the two variables. 

4. The r of .343, when substituted in the formula 

E = 1 — '/1 - r^, gives a coefficient of dependability of

. 06 l . Converted to percentage this means that the test 
is 6. 1% efficient in prediction of individual scores. 
Other E*s in the correlations of the subtest with final 
marks range down to .002, or .2$, showing the subtests 
to be valueless for predictive purposes as far as indi¬ 
vidual scores are concerned. 

CONCLUSIONS 

1. The tests indicate that the predictive efficiency 
of the subtests is negligible. 

2. The arithmetic subtest ranks highest of all the 
subtests when correlated with the criterion scores, but 
it, too, has little predictive value, 

3. The total score of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test can 
be used with greater success to predict succes in com¬ 
mercial subjects than can the scores of the component 
parts of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test.

CHAPTER VII 


SAMPLING 

The results of the investigation are naturally af¬ 
fected by certain truths concerning sampling which are 
not generally appreciated. A summary of these truths 
and their influence on the experimental results is there¬ 
fore included. 

1. The sample must be sufficiently large that there is 

no appreciable difference in the mean and CT as N is in¬ 
creased. Mere numbers do not in themselves guarantee a 
representative sample. 

a- Reliability formulas measure fluctuations arising 

from sampling and from errors of measurement. Varia¬ 
tions from sample to sample do not indicate experimen¬ 
tal errors; rather they demonstrate that samples are 
never exactly alike, 

3. The sample is random when every person in the popu¬ 
lation from which the sample has been drawn has had an 
equal chance of being chosen. 

4. Reliability formulas do not measure the effects of 

constant errors nor the failure to get a random sample. 

24 

Garrett cites the example of 500 male college students 
aged eighteen to twenty-five years who would have very 
different means and sigmas from other groups of the same 
size and age drawn at random from the male population of 
the same age.

The four points mentioned have a direct bearing 
upon the study of the predictive efficiency of the 
Minnesota Clerical Test and the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test, 

The number of students to whom the tests were ad¬ 
ministered ranges from 200 to 203* They constitute a 
sufficiently large sample to permit adequate evaluation 
of the predictive efficiency of the tests. As has been 
pointed out before, with 200 degrees of freedom the r 
has only to be .138 at the ,05 level to be significant. 

By this standard the reliability of the r*s have been 
checked to see whether they departed significantly from 
zero. Also, the coefficients were evaluated, using the 
standard error of estimate, coefficient of alienation, 
coefficient of dependability and coefficient of deter¬ 
mination in the process. The results of these tests are 
given in Chapters IV, V, VI. 

The need for random samples has a direct bearing 
upon this study. The samples are random only to the ex¬ 
tent that students have been chosen from commercial 
classes in three large high schools in Edmonton, Calgary, 
and Lethbridge, and that the instructors were asked 1 to 
select* the groups at random. 

In spite of efforts to secure random samples there 
is bound to be a certain amount of homogeneity in high 
school commercial classes. The percentage of students 
in commercial high schools today is greater than ever

before. One of the main reasons is that pupils who can¬ 
not maintain the standards required in academic subjects 
are placed in commercial, industrial arts and home eco¬ 
nomics classes. F. G. Nichols 2 ^ comments, "Does protest 
against dumping into the commercial department pupils of 
low mental ability accomplish anything?—Can school ad¬ 
ministrators be condemned for this practice? Not wholly; 
because in the absence of suitable courses for the lower 
group they rightly believe that such pupils will get more 
from commercial studies than they will from the only al¬ 
ternative-academic studies." Most certainly many stu¬ 
dents taking commercial subjects are capable of taking 
academic work, but they are rather a small percentage of 
the total. 

The net result is that students in commercial classes 
are to an extent homogeneous. Somewhat narrow limits 
apply; the upper limit is the ability to carry success¬ 
fully an academic program; the lower is the ability to 
pass Grade IX examinations, These limits may be expec¬ 
ted to yield an arbitrarily restricted range of scores 
on almost any test. Statistically the result of narrow¬ 
ing the range of talent is to reduce the coefficient of 
correlations between obtained scores, and correspondingly, 
to reduce the accuracy of prediction of one score from 


another

It is almost certainly true that the Minnesota 
Clerical Test and the N.I.I.P* Clerical Test would 
have shoim somewhat better predictive efficiency had 
our text group been drawn from a thoroughly random 
sample of high school students*

CHAPTER VIII 


CONCLUSIONS 

The N.I.I.P. Clerical Test (total scores) appears 
to be a better predictive instrument than the total 
scores of the Minnesota Clerical Test when each is cor¬ 
related with final marks in typewriting, bookkeeping, 
and stenography* The respective coefficients of corre¬ 
lation of the Minnesota Clerical Test with scores in 
typewriting, bookkeeping, and stenography are .187, #151 
and .059 while the corresponding coefficients for the 
N.I.I.P. Clerical Test are .322, .341, and .54?. 

The total score of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test has 
a much higher correlation with the three commercial 
subjects than does any of the subtests of the N.I.I.P. 
Clerical Test. 

Of the seven subtests of the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test 
the arithmetic subtest has the highest correlation with 
typewriting, bookkeeping and stenography. The respec¬ 
tive coefficients of correlation were . 230 , .294, and 
.343 as compared to ,322 # .341, and .54? for the N.I.I.P 
Clerical Test (total scores) when tested against the 
same criterion scores. 

The lowest coefficients of correlation of the 
N.I.I.P. Clerical Test were obtained when the copying 
subtest was correlated with success in the three commer¬ 
cial subjects.

5. Neither the Minnesota Clerical Test nor the N.I.I.P. 
Clerical Test has coefficients of correlation high enough 
to warrant prediction of an individuals capacity in 
typewriting, bookkeeping, or stenography. While they 
seem to be of little value for the prediction of the suc¬ 
cess of individuals in commercial areas they are probably 
of considerable assistance in group prediction. 

6. The application of the test to the relatively homo¬ 
geneous groups in commercial high schools has depressed 
the coefficients markedly. The fact must be remembered 
that as heterogeneity in the group increases the predic¬ 
tive efficiency of the test rises. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDIES 

1. A study might be made of the predictive efficiency 
of these same clerical tests when the marks of such com¬ 
mercial courses as Business Machines, Business Funda¬ 
mentals, Business Arithmetic, Office Practice, and Com¬ 
mercial Law are used as criterion scores. 

2. A comparative study might be made of the predictive 
efficiency of the Detroit Clerical Aptitudes Examination 
and the N.I.I.P. Clerical Test as they are somewhat 
alike in content. 

3* It is suggested that tests of more specific aim, 

such as the Turse Shorthand Test, be compared with the

N.I.I.P. Clerical Test with a view to comparison of 
their efficiency in prediction of success in the one 
criterion subject, stenography.
