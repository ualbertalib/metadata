INTRODUCTION 


The development of a chemical industry depends, in 
general, upon many factors. Among the more important are: an 
abundant source of cheap raw materials and power; the develop¬ 
ment of chemical processes to convert these raw materials into 
products of marketable value; and lastly, the establishment of 
a market for the manufactured products. The first factor is 
one for the engineer and geologist; the third factor, one for 
the economist, while the second factor is one for the chemist 
and chemical engineer. 

In Alberta, there are many sources of cheap raw 
materials, as for example, the enormous coal deposits, the 
tar sands of the North, and the oil and gas producing areas 
of Turner Valley. Each of these await further development, 
in an economic as well as in a strictly chemical sense. In 
particular, the large quantities of paraffin hydrocarbons 
represented by the enormous resources of natural gas in the 
Province offer an attractive field for exploitation by the 
chemis t. 

A particular field of immediate and urgent interest 
is the oil and gas producing area of Turner Valley, where 
large quantities of natural gas are wastefully vented to the 
atmosphere or burned in flares. At the present time, in 
excess of a billion cubic feet is wasted each month. Already, 
some of this gas is being converted into ammonia and associated 
products at Calgary. Much more gas could be utilized by other

production through well known processes; for example, the 
manufacture of methanol and Its derivatives, derivatives of 
ammonia, or products resulting from their combination. The 
interest of the work being reported lies in the development 
of new processes utilizing the natural gas hydrocarbons or 
readily prepared primary derivatives of them. 

If one can find a process for the direct utiliza¬ 
tion of the gaseous paraffin hydrocarbons, without the 
necessity of having to pass through a number of intermediates 
to reach the desired end product, then obviously this process 
would be desirable. The paraffins as a class, however, are 
relatively inert, and offer few such processes. Direct 
oxidation has been utilized to some extent, especially with 
respect to the hydrocarbons of higher molecular weight. 
However, with the lower members of the paraffin family, this 
method has produced few conspicuous results. Of course, the 
practice of complete direct oxidation of these materials as 
a fuel is common. But partial oxidation to alcohols, 
aldehydes and ketones has in general met with little success. 
Pyrolysis, i.e., decomposition by heat, has also been in¬ 
vestigated in this connection. This method has resulted in 
production of large quantities of carbon and hydrogen, and 
certain other products, largely aromatics and olefins, in 
lesser amounts. 

Turning from the direct methods for utilization of 
the paraffins, one finds more possibilities. The preparation

of hydrogen and the oxides of carbon by interaction of water

reactive materials. The reactions

CO + H 2 0 -> C0 2 + H 2 

permit the preparation of any desired mixture or pure gas, 
and are all operated in one combination or another on an 
industrial scale. The production of ammonia by combination 
of hydrogen with the nitrogen of the air has already been 
mentioned. This ammonia, together with formaldehyde, readily 
obtained from methanol, offers endless possibilities in the 
field of synthetic polyners. The Fischer-Tropsch synthol 
reaction is another means of utilizing carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen. Of course, the many uses of carbon dioxide by 
itself are not to be overlooked. 

This research has been initiated to investigate 
further the direct and indirect utilization of methane and 
its associated products, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and 
methanol. The scope of this research has been limited to 
an investigation of the catalytic production of acetic acid 
from 

( 1 ) the direct carbonation of methane 

( 2 ) the reactions among methane, oxygen and carbon mon¬ 
oxide, involving the consecutive reactions

THEORETICAL AND LITERATURE REVIEW 


There are many methods available for the study of 
catalytic reactions. Among the more common are: 

(1) the study of the decomposition of the desired pro¬ 
ducts over various catalysts; 

(2) an examination of the thermodynamic properties of 
reactants and products; 

(3) direct experimental attempts at the desired 
svnthesis. 

Considering the first of these, the theory of simple 
catalysed reactions states that both forward and reverse re¬ 
actions are catalysed to the same extent. It follows then, 
for example, if a catalyst can be found that will split 
acetic acid into carbon dioxide and methane, or alternatively, 
into carbon monoxide and methanol, then such a catalyst should 
promote the appropriate reverse reactions. This method is of 
some use when little or nothing is known of the type of 
catalyst required for a given reaction. It will serve in a 
qualitative way to indicate the nature of the required 
catalyst, e.g., whether an irreduceable metallic oxide or 
an acidic oxide is more effective. Thus the development of 
a process for the synthesis of methanol from hydrogen and 
carbon monoxide was materially aided by investigations of 
this type. However, the method is by no means infallible. 
Indeed, the results obtained from such an investigation may

be of no practical application whatever. Morris 9 who 
used such a method in the attempted synthesis of ethanol 

from water gas, concludes that ”.catalysts developed 

at atmospheric pressure were not particularly useful, and did 
no more than indicate the basic types that might be of use. 

. The only method applicable in the present state of 

the science of catalysis maybe described as trial and error.” 

Again, this method may fail to indicate a synthetic 
procedure that would be eminently satisfactory. Thus the 
decomposition of acetic acid into methanol and carbon mon¬ 
oxide over phosphoric acid has never been demonstrated, and 
yet the synthesis maybe achieved fairly readily(^). 

The limited value of this method is particularly 
evident in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. In general, 
one may attribute the poor results to two factors. First 
it is rare that reactions are simple and clean-cut. Usually, 
a given reacting system can proceed along a number of routes 
through both concurrent and consecutive processes, to give 
a number of independent products. Thus, though one may 
identify certain products formed from the decomposition of 
a given compound, that is no guarantee that these same 
products may be recombined to give the original compound. 
Second, since heterogeneous reactions are dependent on 
adsorption at catalyst surfaces, that the simple theory should 
hold would be unexpected. To elucidate, a catalyst promoting 
A -> B would be a good adsorbent for A, and not for B. In

order to promote B -» A, the reverse adsorbtive behaviour 

would be advantageous. 

The decomposition products of acetic acid have been 
reported as carbon dioxide and methane, when the acetic acid 
was passed over a reduced nickel catalyst . Other pro¬ 
ducts of decomposition have also been reported. Direct 
pyrolysis has yielded carbon monoxide, ethylene, acetic 
anhydride and ketene^®). The familiar reaction of acetic 

acid forming acetone, carbon dioxide and water, under in- 

(14) 

fluence of calcium carbonate is encountered frequently . 
This reaction is used on a commercial scale. 

Hurd and Martin^ have established a theoretical 
background to explain the formation of all these end products. 
Since the methyl group in the methane system is the analogue 
of the hydroxyl group in the water system, the compounds of 
methane and water are similar:

Now carbonic acid, (1) above, breaks down into carbon dioxide 
and water on heating, while acetone, (3) above, breaks down 
into ketene and methane' 1 . On this basis, Hurd suggested 
that acetic acid, (2) above, considered as a structural 
hybrid of carbonic acid and acetone, should break down funda¬ 
mentally into carbon dioxide and methane, or into ketene and 
water. This latter reaction has been demonstrated^ .

Moreover* both reactions may proceed simultaneously, with 

the overall effect of producing acetone, carbon dioxide and 

water. To account for the carbon monoxide and ethylene, 

(14) 

found by Nef , Hurd suggested that ketene breaks down to 
ethylene, and carbon monoxide, according to 
2 C 2 H 2 O -» C 2 H 4 + 2C0 

These various possibilities have been confirmed 
in experiments carried out in this laboratory^^ . Thus it 
was found that reduceable metallic oxides as nickel oxide, 
promoted the carbon dioxide-methane reaction, while the 
basic oxides, e.g., calcium oxide, promoted the acetone- 
carbon dioxide-water reaction. Irreduceable metallic oxides, 
e.g#, chromium oxide, promoted the ethylene-carbon monoxide 
reaction. This then serves as an indication of the nature 
of the catalyst to be used in the direct carbonation of methane. 

As for the second method of studying catalytic re¬ 
actions mentioned above, thermodynamic analysis: this 
particular application of the method is merely one phase of 
a principle theoretically applicable to the whole field of 
chemistry. To successfully apply this method, one requires 
the following data: 

( 1 ) heat capacity equations for the reactants and products 

( 2 ) standard heats of formation of reactants and products 

and 

(3) values for the standard free energy of formation for 
reactants and products . There may be a limitation on this

method due to lack of such data. Inherent In the method 
Itself however, Is another limitation. Even with complete 
thermal data, one cannot say with certainty whether a given 
reaction will proceed, but merely that it may do so, 
realization being dependent on existence of a mechanism. 
Thermal analysis allows the calculation of equilibrium 
constants for a reaction, but does not predict whether or 
not equilibrium can be reached, and at what rate. The 
problem of attainment of equilibrium and rate of reaction 
is usually a study in mechanisms and catalysis. 

The necessary data for the reactions of present 
interest are listed in Table I.

These data have been selected from the most recent

mate heat capacity equation introduces some uncertainty in

the final expression of the equilibrium constant K as a 
function of the temperature T, for the reaction. It is un¬ 
likely however that the general trend of K as T changes is 
in error. 

For the reaction 


C0 2 + CH 4 - > CH 3 COOH, 

it is found that 

APrp = + 8,200 + 15.05 T log T - 6.8 T - 0.0106T 2

log K =

4.571T 

AF (1000°K) = +46,000 calories, log K » - 10.0 

It is obvious from the values of log K that the yield of 
acetic acid will be very small, and will decrease somewhat 
with increasing temperatures. Increased pressure will, of 
course, increase the yield of acetic acid from this reaction. 
Thus the problem of the preparation of acetic acid from these 
two components has been narrowed down to a search for an 
active, low temperature catalyst. This is not promising. 

For the reaction 


CO + CH 3 OH —* CH 3 COOH, 

AF( T ) = - 31,100 - 0.824 T log T - 0.7V5 T 2 +40.3 T 
AF(300°K) * - 26,500 log K =19.3 

AF(600°K) = - 36,200 log K = 13.2 

From this equation, and the values of log K, it is seen that 
yield of acetic acid will be large, approaching 100 % at 
equilibrium. Other reactions such as dehydration or

decomposition to carbon monoxide and hydrogen of methanol, 
and the production of carbon dioxide and carbon from carbon 
monoxide are likely to occur. The concurrent reactions are 
either unaffected or are repressed by high pressures, and 
the use of such pressures is indicated in this reaction. 

Prom thermodynamic considerations alone, the suc¬ 
cessful preparation of acetic acid from carbon dioxide and 
methane appears doubtful, while its preparation from carbon 
monoxide and methanol appears more favourable. 

Proceeding to the third method of catalytic inves¬ 
tigation mentioned above, that of direct experimental attempts 
*at the desired synthesis: while this method may make intel¬ 
ligent use of the results obtained from methods (1) and (2) 
above, it cannot at the present time be other than an 
empirical catalyst search. This method provides the ultimate 
test for any theoretical conclusions derived from other 
sources. Moreover this method, as Krase and Singh^^ state, 

l? .required multiplicity of manpower and testing 

equipment . u 

The literature on the production of acetic acid 
from carbon dioxide and methane is confined almost exclusively 
to patents. A typical patent is one of Dreyfus^ 3 ) who 
claims a temperature of 300°C - 500°C, 10-200 Kg. pressure, 
and the presence of an oxide, hydrate, carbonate, bicarbonate 
or phosphate of an acidic metal oxide, for the production 
of acetic acid from carbon dioxide and methane. However,

B. Maldowski^* 1 -) carried out experiments, with results 
confirming thermodynamic calculations, showing that these 
patents were unworkable. 

It has been shown^) that appreciable yields of 
methanol may be obtained by the direct oxidation of methane 
over copper catalysts at elevated temperatures and pres¬ 
sures. The mechanism of the oxidation of methane has been 
explained^^ as a successive introduction of oxygen atoms 
into the methane molecule: 

CH 4 + 0 —» CH 3 OH 

CH 3 OH + 0-» ch 2 (oh ) 2 —* CH 2 0 + H 2 0 

CH 2 O -> CO + H 2 

CH2O + 0 —» CH2O2 

ch 2°2 + 0 -* k 2 C0 3 

H 2 CO 3 -* C0 2 + h 2 o 

While the parent compound is very resistant to oxidation, the 
succeeding compounds are readily attacked by oxygen. More¬ 
over these compounds are thermo-labile, and decompose into 
hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water as indicated above. 
Indeed, when one oxygen atom has been introduced into the 
methane molecule, the successive reactions of oxidation and 
decomposition proceed so rapidly that the end products of 
oxidation of methane are usually carbon dioxide and water. 

If, in some way, the primary product could be 
removed from the oxidation zone (the surface of the copper) 
before further reaction could occur, this method would offer

an attractive means for utilization of methane. An alterna¬ 
tive to this rapid removal would be to convert the readily 
oxidizable methanol into another product, more resistant to 
oxidation. Such a product is acetic acid. This compound 
has a high degree of thermal stability, and its structure is 
extremely resistant to oxidation. 

The addition of carbon monoxide to a suitable 
mixture of methane and oxygen offers, at least theoretically, 
a possibility for indirect carbonation of methane to acetic 
acid, by means of the consecutive reactions 

CH 4 + 0 -* CH 3 0H 

CH 3 0H + GO -* ch 3 cooh 

In any event, it is a matter of some interest to determine 
the extent of the oxidation reaction in the presence of 
various concentrations of carbon monoxide, e.g., whether 
the carbon monoxide will be attacked exclusively, or In 
particular, whether the successive' reaction of oxidation 
to methanol and carbonation to acetic acid will go. 

The indirect carbonation of methane to acetic acid 
has been accomplished by Grignard^^, who proceeded from 
methane through methyl bromide by halogenation, to methyl 
magnesium bromide (a Grignard reagent). An ethereal solution 
of this reagent was allowed to drop onto dry ice (solid 
carbon dioxide). In a matter of seconds, the following 
reaction occurred: 

CH 3 MgBr + C0 2 _» CH 3 C0gMgBr.

When this material was hydrolyzed, the original methyl bromide 
was converted almost quantitatively into acetic acid: 

CH 3 C0 2 MgBr + H 2 0 - > CH 3 COOH + MgOHBr 

However, it would be impractical to use this method on a 
commercial scale. 

The synthesis of acetic acid from carbon monoxide 
and methanol has been reported several times in the litera¬ 
ture. Hardy^ 6 ), using a catalyst of 87$ phosphoric acid and 
2 $ copper phosphate, found under optimum conditions of his 
apparatus, that 44.9$ of the methanol was converted to acetic 
acid or methyl acetate, 9.5$ to dimethyl ether, 4.8$ to free 
carbon, 5.0$ loss and 35.8$ unchanged. He used a recircula¬ 
tion assembly, in which carbon monoxide was passed through 
methanol and the saturated vapours then passed through the 
catalyst. However, maximum conversion of carbon monoxide to 
acetic acid per pass was found to 0.5$. He also reports 
that as the carbon monoxide:methanol ratio dropped from 
40:1 to 10:1, the total yield of acid dropped to 3$. Hardy 
also suggests that dimethyl ether is an intermediate in the 
production of acetic acid in this process. Singh and 
Krase^) have also investigated this reaction, using as a 
catalyst, charcoal impregnated with phosphoric acid. Using 
a one pass system, considerable quantities of dimethyl ether 
were formed, up to 90$ of the methanol delivered to the

catalyst, was obtained. The use of a recirculation system, 
in which the off-gases were not expanded, but recirculated 
over the catalyst, together with more methanol, increased 
the yield of acetic acid up to 36$, with a corresponding 
decrease in dimethyl ether production. The carbon monoxide: 
methanol ratio was of the order of 40:1. These workers also 
suggest that dimethyl ether is an intermediate in the forma¬ 
tion of acetic acid. 

Earlier work done by these same men(9) in. which 
carbon monoxide was bubbled through liquid methanol in 
presence of various catalysts, gave no acetic acid whatever. 
They concluded that any further work to be done on this re¬ 
action should be limited to vapour phase studies. 

The patent literature contains many references 
to the production of acetic acid by this reaction. The list 
of catalysts is extensive and covers a multitude of compounds 
and elements, as for example, oxides of titanium, aluminum, 
silicon, copper oxide, lead oxide, sulfonic acids, bismuth, 
thorium, etc. However, these claims are of little interest, 
since they are not accompanied by experimental results. 

The investigations outlined in this report have 
included all three possibilities discussed above. The 
experimental material will be divided into three parts:

PART I 


CARBON DIOXIDE - METHANE REACTION 
Experimental Methods 

Materials - 

Carbon dioxide was obtained from a cylinder of 
commercial liquid carbon dioxide, and was used without 
further purification. The methane used was Viking natural 
gas, freed from sulfur added as an odorant, by passage over 
activated charcoal before compression. Some of the higher 
molecular weight hydrocarbons were also removed by the 
charcoal. This gas was analyzed by low temperature 
fractional distillation^, and had the following composi¬ 
tion: 

93.1$ me thane 
4.7$ nitrogen 
1.7$ ethane 

0.5$ propane and higher 

Many catalysts were tested in this work. Typical 
of these are: (numbers are given with reference to Table II 
below) 

Catalyst 1.- Reduced nickel oxide. The catalyst 
was prepared by roasting the nitrate in presence of porcelain 
chips as a carrier. Activation was secured by reduction 
with hydrogen at 300°C. 

Catalyst 2.- Zinc and chromium oxides in equimolar

amounts. This catalyst was prepared by coprecipitation of 
the respective hydroxides. These hydroxides were washed 
free of sodium nitrate, and dried at 120°C for one day. 

Catalyst 14.- Palladium on asbestos. This 
catalyst was prepared by precipitation of palladium from a 
palladium chloride solution on long fibre asbestos. It was 
activated by treatment with hydrogen at 300°C. 

Catalyst 15.- Platinum on asbestos. This catalyst 
was prepared from a platinum chloride solution, by reduction 
of the platinum ion with formalin solution. The metal was 
precipitated onto the carrier. It was ignited, and acti¬ 
vated with hydrogen at 350°C. 

Catalyst 18A.- Cobalt on charcoal. This catalyst 
was prepared by the precipitation of the hydroxide from a 
solution of the nitrate salt, in the presence of activated 
charcoal as a carrier. The hydroxide was dried at 130°C for 
one day before use. 

Catalyst 21.- Zinc ferrate. This catalyst was 
prepared by fusion of a mixture of zinc sulfate, sodium 
sulfate and ferric sulfate, followed by extraction of the 
melt with dilute acetic acid. The zinc ferrate, being 
feebly ferromagnetic, was purified by electromagnetic con¬ 
centration. 

Catalyst 23.- An equimolar mixture of iron, cobalt 
and nickel oxides. It was prepared by coprecipitation of 
the metals as their hydroxides, in the presence of a charcoal

Apparatus 

The apparatus, which is shown in figures 1 and 2, 
consisted essentially of a means for passing carhon dioxide- 
methane mixtures, at suitable pressure and rate of flow, 
over a catalyst bed maintained at any desired temperature. 

Figure 1 gives the essential parts of the apparatus. 
A high pressure storage vessel, A, was connected to a three 
stage compressor through the valve C. The Bourdon gauge, 

M, previously calibrated by comparison with a deadweight 
piston gauge, indicated the pressure. The reaction system 
was connected with the storage system through valve N. This 
reaction system consisted of a reaction vessel, figure 2, 

(the details of which are given below), followed by a high 
pressure bronze condenser D. The condenser was followed 
by the expansion valve E, placed in a heated oil bath as 
shown. An atmospheric pressure spiral condenser F, followed 
the expansion valve. It was kept immersed in an ice-water 
mixture. The off-gas flow rate was indicated by the flow 
meter G. This rate could be adjusted by means of the 
expansion valve. A continuous proportional sampler, indicated 
at H, was used in taking a sample of the off-gas. The con¬ 
fining liquid in this device was a solution of 20% sodium 
sulfate, 5% sulfuric acid and 75% water. Such a solution 
will not dissolve significant amounts of the components of 
the off-gas. The volume of gas was measured in the calibrated

wet-test meter J. Any liquid that might accumulate in the 
condenser D, could be blown off into the low pressure con¬ 
denser F, by opening valve K. 

The details of the reaction vessel are shown in 
figure 2. It consisted essentially of a stainless steel 
tube A, 9 M x 7/8" O.D. x I.D. This reactor had a volume 
of 7.6 c.c. The catalyst was held in place in the reactor 
by means of discs of copper mesh. This tube was enclosed 
in a cast iron pipe B, and surrounded by a lead bath C. The 
bath was heated by means of resistance wire wound over 
asbestos sheet sheathing the pipe B. An outer layer of 
asbestos cement provided heat insulation. A thermocouple 
well D, immersed in the lead bath, contained a calibrated 
iron-constantan thermocouple. The temperature was maintained 
manually by the adjustment of resistances in the heating 
circuit, and could be controlled to t 5°C. This reactor 
could be used safely at 450°C, with internal pressures up to 
3800 p.s.i. 

To prepare the gas mixture, a cylinder of liquid 
carbon dioxide was attached to the storage system through 
the valve C. After the carbon dioxide had expanded into A, 
up to its vapour pressure, (ca.800 p.s.i.), the cylinder 
was disconnected. Valve C was then connected to a line 
from the compressor, and methane was pumped into A. By this 
means, a homogeneous mixture of the two gases was readily 
obtained. Moreover, this method allowed the utilization of

high pressures, much above that of the vapour pressure of 
carbon dioxide. By this means, mixtures containing from 50$ 
to 80$ methane were obtained. The exact percent of methane 
depended upon the final pressure attained. 

The operating procedure was relatively simple. 
After the catalyst bed had attained the proper temperature, 
valve N (figure 1) was opened, and the carbon dioxide - 
methane mixture entered the reactor and the condenser. The 
expansion valve E was now opened, and the rate of off-gas 
flow was adjusted by reference to the flow meter G. After 
the expansion train had been thoroughly swept out, the con¬ 
tinuous proportional sampler was started. The off-gas 
volume was determined by readings of the wet-test meter J. 

At the conclusion of the run, the contents of condenser D 
were blown off into the low pressure condenser F, through 
valve K. The pressure drop during a run was between fifty 
and one hundred pounds p.s.i.

determine the activity of this catalyst for the reactions 

CH 4 + CO 2 -> 2C0 + 2H2 

2C0 -> C0 2 + C 

As is seen, appreciable amounts of hydrogen were formed. The 
catalyst (cobalt on charcoal) was found to be pyrophoric 
at the end of the run. This catalyst appears to be relatively 
active in promoting the first of the above reactions. However, 
this catalyst while able to promote reactions between carbon 
dioxide and methane, was not effective in opening the methane 
molecule sufficiently to allow it to react with carbon dioxide 
to form acetic acid. 

These negative results, while disappointing, are 
not unexpected in view of the known inactivity of methane, 
and also in view of the thermodynamic properties of the 
reaction, as described above. Any further attempts to demon¬ 
strate the direct carbonation of methane may lie in the use of 
much higher pressures, and more highly active catalysts useful 
at lower temperatures. Certainly, under the conditions used 
in this work, direct carbonation of methane may be considered 
unlikely.

PART II 


REACTIONS AMONG CARBON MONOXIDE, METHANE AND OXYGEN 


Experimental Methods 


Materials - 

Viking natural gas, treated as described in Part I, 
of composition given on page 16, was taken as the supply of 
methane. Compressed oxygen as supplied commercially was 
used without further purification. 

Carbon monoxide was prepared from practical grade 
formic acid by dehydration with syrupy phosphoric acid: 

HCOOH -» CO + H 2 0 

Phosphoric acid was used instead of sulfuric acid to prevent 
charring of the formic acid. Formic acid was dropped into 
boiling 85$ phosphoric acid, and the resulting water and 
carbon monoxide were immediately distilled out of solution. 
Most of the water vapour was removed in a water cooled 
condenser. The carbon monoxide was washed with aqueous 
potassium hydroxide solution to remove any carbon dioxide 
that may have been formed in the dehydration step. The 
resulting gas was pure carbon monoxide, and was stored until 
required in a water-sealed gas-holder. 

Required mixtures of the gases were made by care¬ 
fully metering the individual gases through a wet-test 
meter into a water-sealed gas-holder. To hasten the natural 
processes of diffusion, these gases were added to the gas

holder In the order of Increasing density. The resulting 
mixture was allowed to stand until it was found to be 
homogeneous . 

The catalyst used in these experiments was metallic 
copper in the form of short lengths of heavy wire of dimen¬ 
sions 2.5 cm long, 0.16 cm diameter. The total mass of the 
copper was 118.0 grams. The volume occupied by the catalyst 
in the reactor, including free space, was 30 cubic centi¬ 


meters .

Apparatus 

The apparatus, shown in figure 3, was relatively 
simple. Gas entered the reaction system from storage 
vessel A, through valve D. The reaction chamber, E, con¬ 
sisted of a tube of high nickel-chromium steel, with a 
copper lining extending over its sides and ends. This 
chamber was maintained at the desired temperature by means 
of a split multiple unit electrical furnace F. Even dis¬ 
tribution of temperature throughout the length of the 
chamber was obtained by means of a split brass cylindrical 
jacket, G, placed between the reaction chamber and the 
heating elements. The temperature was determined by means 
of a calibrated iron-constantan thermocouple, inserted in 
a groove cut in the inner surface of the brass cylinder, 
and exposed to the wall of the reaction chamber. The 
temperature was controlled by means of appropriate rheostats 
and a recording potentiometer controller. Temperatures 
were maintained constant to t 2°C. 

From the reactor, a line led to the bottom of a 
water cooled high pressure condenser, J. The off-gases 
left the condenser through an overhead take off, and were 
passed through a heated expansion valve, K, into the con¬ 
denser train. This condenser train consisted of a spiral 
glass condenser, L, which was immersed in an ice-water 
mixture. The condenser was followed by a flow meter, M.

A continuous proportional sampling device, N, and a calibrated 
wet-test meter, P, completed the expansion train. 

The pressure control system merits some description 
(figure 3). A 50$ glycerine-water mixture was pumped into 
vessel A by means of the hydraulic pump R. This liquid 
served as a hydraulic piston for the compression of the gas 
in A up to the operating pressure. This glycerine-water 
mixture had no corrosive action on the metal parts of the 
apparatus. Moreover, it did not dissolve serious amounts of 
the gas mixture. A Bourdon gauge, C, previously calibrated 
by comparison with a dead weight piston gauge, indicated 
the operating pressure. Two contacts, high and low, on the 
gauge C, operating through a relay, controlled a light. As 
gas was withdrawn through valve D, to the reaction system, 
the movement of the gauge index operated the light, which 
was the visual signal for the operator to start the hydraulic 
pump. As the glycerine-water was pumped into vessel A from 
reservoir S, the pressure rose. When it reached the required 
operating pressure, the light was automatically turned off. 
This was the signal to stop the pump. By this means, pres¬ 
sure in the reactor was maintained within one or two 
atmospheres. 

The initial charge of gas to vessel A was obtained 
from the gas-holder containing the gas mixture' by use of a 
three stage compressor.

Operating Procedure 

The gas pressure in the storage vessel A was 
built up by injection of glycerine-water solution with the 
hydraulic pump to 200 p.s.i. above that desired for a run. 
When the temperature of the reactor had reached the desired 
value, valve D was opened. This allowed the gas mixture to 
enter the reactor and high pressure condenser. The pressure 
control apparatus described above was then set. The expan¬ 
sion valve, K, was adjusted to permit the desired rate off¬ 
gas flow as indicated by the flow meter, M. After 5-10 
litres of gas had passed and flushed the expansion train, 
the continuous proportional gas sampling device was started. 
At the conclusion of the run, valve A was closed, the 
sampling device shut off, and the residual gas left in the 
reactor and condenser were allowed to expand through the 
expansion train. Any liquid products formed in the reactor 
and retained in the high pressure condenser J, were blown 
over into the glass condenser L by cautiously opening valve 
R. The volume of off-gas was determined by the wet-test 
meter, (plus the volume in the sampling device). The 
quantity of liquid products formed wa3 measured by the 
increase in weight of the condenser L.

Analytical Methods 

The analyses of in-gas and off-gas were made in 
duplicate, using an improved type of Bureau of Mines Orsat 
apparatus described in Part I. 

The liquid condensate was examined for acids, 
formaldehyde and methanol. An excess of standard alkali 
was added to an aliquot portion of the liquid, and this 
solution was boiled to remove any carbon dioxide. This was 
followed by back titration with standard sulfuric acid with 
phenolphthalein as the indicator. Formaldehyde was tested 
for qualitatively, using Schiff T s fuchsin-aldehyde reagent. 
Methanol was tested for by careful fractional distillation 
of the liquid in a 20 cm. vacuum jacketed fractionating 
column. This method could not be used in a quantitative 
manner, but it served to indicate the presence or absence 
of liquids with boiling points corresponding to that of 
methanol.

Experiment al Results 

Thomas has found that the operating pressure 
and temperature, have profound effects upon the end products 
of direct oxidation of methane. The optimum conditions of 
temperature and pressure for the formation of methanol by 
this reaction found by Thomas have been used in this investi¬ 
gation. These conditions are 

(1) an operating temperature of 400°C, 

(2) a pressure between 2000-2100 p.s.i. 

It is realized that such a procedure is open to criticism, 
since in this work we are concerned not merely with oxygen 
and methane, but with oxygen, methane, and carbon monoxide. 
However, as a first approximation, it was felt that these 
conditions, in the absence of other data, were those most 
liable to produce positive results. 

The consistency of the results was checked by means 
of material balances. Thomashas investigated this 
method, and concluded that carbon balances in particular are 
quite reliable. 

The method maybe described as follows: the total 
carbon content of the off-products is found. From this 
quantity, and the analysis of the in-gas, the volume of the 
in-gas which had entered the reactor may be calculated. 

When the volume of the in-gas is calculated, this figure can 
be used in determining the balance between the in-hydrogen,

and off-hydrogen. Similar calculations can be applied to 
the nitrogen and the oxygen. The difference between these 
figures is a measure of the accuracy of one’s analytical 
methods. However it may be noted that oxygen balances 
obtained in this way are frequently poor, and discrepancies 
greater than any possible analytical error may exist. No 
satisfactory explanation has been found^ 1 ^). 

The method will be illustrated in detail using the 
data of Run 9, as listed in Table III.

Such close agreement in the material balance obtained 
by using carbon as the equating element gives one confidence 
in the use of this method in the interpretation of results. 

The agreement in the material balance for run 11 is of the 
same order a3 that for run 9. Run 10 does not show such 
close agreement, but the run maybe considered significant. 

The data for these runs are presented in Table III.

The oxidation reactions continued until practically all avail¬ 
able gaseous oxygen was consumed. There was no evidence of 
oxygenated carbon compounds in the condensate. 

In run 10, the concentration of carbon monoxide 
was increased to 48.5$, the oxygen was held at 3,1$, while 
the methane was 44.7$. Under these conditions, only one re¬ 
action occurred: 

2C0 + O 2 - > 2002 

The oxidation of carbon monoxide proceeded until the concen¬ 
tration of oxygen reached 1.4$, and no methane was oxidized. 

In run 11, the concentrations of carbon monoxide 
and methane were midway between the values for runs 9 and 
10. The carbon monoxide concentration was 31.0$, methane 
concentration 60.9$, while the oxygen remained at 4.0$. 

Even with this richer mixture in terms of methane, only 
carbon monoxide was attacked. The oxidation of carbon mon¬ 
oxide to carbon dioxide continued until the oxygen concen¬ 
tration reached the value of 0.9$. 

Conclusions 

Under the conditions of these experiments, the 
oxidation of carbon monoxide by gaseous oxygen is very much 
more rapid than the oxidation of methane, so much so that 
no methane is oxidized when its partial pressure is twice

that of carbon monoxide. When the partial pressure of methane 
is about seventeenfold that of carbon monoxide (experiment 9), 
methane shares the oxygen with carbon monoxide and oxidation 
of both proceeds. In this latter experiment, there was no 
trace of methanol formation, a result not at first sight 
consistent with the work of Thomas 

The inhibition of the oxidation of methane may be 
looked upon as a type of selective poisoning of the copper 
catalyst. Carbon monoxide is strongly adsorbed by the 
copper. The surface of the catalyst becomes completely 
covered with these molecules, and any methane molecules that 
may strike the surface are not oxidized. However, oxygen 
will attack the adsorbed carbon monoxide. As the concentra¬ 
tion of the latter gas is decreased, until comparable with 
that of the oxygen, adsorption of oxygen can take place. 
Consequently, simultaneous with carbon monoxide oxidation, 
methane is oxidized by the oxygen present on the copper 
surface. Due to the relative inertness of the methane 
molecule to oxidation, it is not expected that every collision 
with the adsorbed oxygen will result in reaction. On the 
other hand, it may be expected that nearly every collision 
of a carbon monoxide molecule with the catalyst surface will 
be followed by either adsorption or oxidation. The absence 
of methanol formation can be attributed at this time only to 
unknown factors such as different properties of the catalyst 
surface from those existing in Thomas 1 


experiments.

The preparation of acetic acid by this method is 
dependent upon the oxidation of methane to methanol over the 
copper surface, followed by the action of carbon monoxide on 
the methanol so formed. Evidently the amount of methanol 
obtained is not sufficient to allow the carbon monoxide- 
methanol reaction to occur at all. The kinetics of the 
consecutive reaction require that before the methanol molecule 
is completely oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, it must 
meet and react with a carbon monoxide molecule. The proba¬ 
bility of this second reaction occurring is very small, when 
the methanol concentration is practically zero. 

Further work on this problem would involve the 
development of a multiple catalyst that would promote oxi¬ 
dation of methane to methanol, and at the same time promote 
the carbon monoxide methanol reaction. One important 
criterion of such a catalyst is that it does not adsorb 
carbon monoxide, but does adsorb oxygen or methane strongly. 
The ratio of methane to carbon monoxide must be high, before 
the first stage of the reaction occurs at all. Further 
studies in this region are indicated.

PART III 


THE REACTION BETWEEN CARBON MONOXIDE AND METHANOL 
Experimental Methods 


Materials - 

i 

Carbon monoxide T^sed was prepared from formic acid 
by the method described in Part II. The gas used In these 
experiments was not in general pure. The carbon monoxide- 
rich off-gas was collected after each run, added to the 
carbon monoxide gas holder, and used over again. Carbon 
dioxide was removed from this gas by scrubbing with aqueous 
potassium hydroxide, but hydrogen and methane accumulated 
gradually. When the concentration of hydrogen and methane 
together rose above 10% 9 the gas was discarded, and a fresh 
supply was made. It is realized that such a procedure may 
lead to ambiguous results. While methane maybe considered 
inert in these reactions, hydrogen and carbon monoxide may 
react to produce methanol or methane. In either event, the 
effects are not of major importance. 

The methanol used was prepared from analytical 
grade acetone-free material by fractional distillation. That 
fraction boiling between 64.4°C and 64.6°C was retained. 

This methanol had a density of 0.7S30 at 20 °C, (I.C.T. gives 
0.7928). The aqueous solutions of methanol used in several 
runs were prepared gravimetrically from the above methanol 
and distilled water.

The acetic acid used in several experiments, and 
in the standardization of the analytical procedure was 
analytical grade, assaying 99•5$ acetic acid. It was used 
without further purification. The methyl acetate used in 
some of the runs, and also in the standardization of the 
recovery procedures, was also reagent grade. It contained 
no titratahle acid. It was used without further purification. 
Catalysts - 

Catalyst IB - calcium phosphate. A solution of 
calcium nitrate was added to a solution of sodium phosphate. 
The precipitated material was washed free of nitrate ion 
by decantation, filtered and dried at 120°C. 

Catalyst 2B - 5 calcium phosphate, 1 uranyl bi¬ 
phosphate mixture. This catalyst was prepared by the incor¬ 
poration of the requisite amount of uranyl nitrate into a 
moist precipitate of calcium phosphate. The uranyl ion 
was precipitated as the biphosphate by the addition of an 
excess of potassium monohydrogen phosphate. The mass was 
washed free of nitrate ion, filtered and dried at 120°C. 

This catalyst formed a hard cake that could be broken up and 
screened to suitable size. 

Catalyst 3B - Phosphoric acid and copper phosphate 
on activated coconut charcoal. This catalyst was prepared 
by soaking the charcoal in 100 c.c. of syrupy phosphoric 
acid, to which 3.6 grams of copper phosphate had been added. 
The charcoal was allowed to remain in contact with the acid 


solution for one week before use.

Catalyst 7B - Phosphomolybdic acid on an artificial 
clay as a carrier. This catalyst was prepared by soaking the 
carrier in a saturated solution of the acid. The mixture was 
filtered, washed sparingly, and dried at 130°C. The carrier 
was prepared from sodium silicate and aluminum sulfate. It 
had a composition represented by the formula AlgO^.gSiOg. 

Catalyst 8B - Phosphomolybdic and phosphoric acids 
on pumice stone. This catalyst was prepared by soaking 
pumice stone in syrupy phosphoric acid. A saturated solution 
of the second acid was then added, and the mixture was taken 
to dryness at 130°C. Actually, the phosphoric acid was not 
dehydrated at this temperature. Consequently, the catalyst 
surface remained moist. 

Catalyst 9B - Activated alumina. This catalyst 
was 4-8 mesh size alumina as commercially available. It was 
activated at 200°C for four hours. 

Catalyst 10B - Phosphomolybdic acid with activated 
alumina as a carrier. This catalyst was prepared by soaking 
activated alumina (from catalyst 9B) in an aqueous saturated 
solution of the acid. This solution was evaporated to 
dryness at 130°C. This catalyst proved to be superior to 
the other phosphomolybdic acid preparations in mechanical 
properties. It did not disintegrate appreciably during use.

Apparatus and Operation 

Two methods were used in this investigation. In 
the first, carbon monoxide and methanol were mixed in a pre¬ 
heater, and then passed over the catalyst. The liquid pro¬ 
ducts were collected in a condenser, and the residual carbon 
monoxide, together with other gaseous products formed in the 
reaction, were expanded to atmospheric pressure through a 
suitable expansion train. The apparatus used in this 
procedure is shown in figures 4 and 5. In the second method, 
the off-gases from the condenser were not expanded, but were 
recirculated over the catalyst by means that will be des¬ 
cribed below. This apparatus is shown diagramatically in 
figure 7. 

Figure 4 shows the storage system and reactor for 
the single pass method. Carbon monoxide entered the system 
from a line connected at valve R. It was compressed in a 
two stage compressor into the storage cylinder B. A 50 % 
glycerine-water mixture could be pumped into this cylinder 
from vessel E by means of the hydraulic pump F. Gas 
pressure in this cylinder was indicated by the Bourdon 
gauge A. This gauge had been previously calibrated by a 
dead weight piston gauge. Valve S controlled the flow of 
carbon monoxide into the preheater H. A check valve G in 
the carbon monoxide line prevented any gases formed in the 
preheater or in the reactor from entering the carbon mon¬ 
oxide storage vessel.

Methanol from a 100 c.cm. burette C, could be 
pumped into the preheater by means of the adjustable stroke 
hydraulic pump D. The preheater was heated by means of 
resistance wire wound over asbestos sheet, sheathing the 
vessel. An outer layer of asbestos cement provided heat 
insulation. An iron-constantan thermocouple was soldered 
onto the preheater, beneath the asbestos sheet. During 
operation, the temperature of the preheater was maintained 
at 270°C (30° above the critical temperature of methanol). 

It was controlled by rheostats in the heating circuit and a 
potentiometer recorder controller, to t 2°C. The preheater 
was filled with copper turnings, to facilitate the mixing 
of the methanol vapours and the carbon monoxide. Blank 
runs showed that no chemical reaction took place in the 
preheater under these conditions. 

From the preheater, the gases entered the reactor 

J. This reactor and furnace were the same as described in 
Part II. Briefly, the reactor consisted of a copper lined 
tube of high nickel chromium steel, of 30 c.cm. volume, 
maintained at the operating temperature by an automatically 
controlled electric furnace. 

From the reactor, the off-gases and liquid products 
v/ere led to the bottom of the bronze high pressure condenser 

K. This condenser was cooled in an ice-water mixture. The 
bulk of the unconverted methanol and other liquid products 
were condensed out here. The residual carbon monoxide and

other gaseous byproducts left the condenser through an over¬ 
head take-off at M. The liquid products collected In this 
condenser could be removed through the blow-off valve N. 

Figure 5 shows the details of the expansion train. 
It may be noted here that this train was used in both single 
pass and circulation experiments. The off-gases from the 
high pressure condenser were expanded to atmospheric pressure 
through the heated expansion valve B. A spiral glass con¬ 
denser C, maintained at 0°C in an ice-water mixture, trapped 
residual vapours in the off-gas. A flow meter D served to 
indicate the rate of flow of off-gases from the system. A 
calcium chloride drier, E, removed any uncondensed water and 
methanol vapours from the gas. Fritted glass scrubbers, 

E and F, were filled with concentrated sulfuric acid, and 
removed dimethyl ether from the off-gas. A continuous pro¬ 
portional gas sampler, indicated at H, followed the sulfuric 
acid scrubbers. Readings on the wet-te3t meter J gave a 
record of the off-gas volume. From this meter, the off¬ 
gases were led to a water-sealed gas holder. This is not 
shown in the figure. 

It was found convenient to indicate the pumps D 
and F in figure 4 as isolated pieces of equipment. Actually, 
these pumps were mounted in the same block. They could be 
operated independently of each other. The pumps were driven 
by a small electric motor connected to a speed reducer. The 
pump block, electric motor and speed reducer were mounted as

a unit on a heavy section of channel iron. This unit is 
shown in the picture of the apparatus (figure 6). 

The technique of operation of the expansion appa¬ 
ratus was developed in several preliminary runs. First, 
the catalyst was placed in the reactor. It was held in 
position with several discs of copper gauze. The preheater 
and reactor were next brought up to operating temperature. 
During the heating period, the methanol feed line from the 
pump D to the preheater was flushed with methanol, and 
connected into the system. Simultaneously, the pressure of 
carbon monoxide in storage vessel A was raised to the 
desired operating value, by means of the pump F. 

When these preliminary operations had been completed, 
valve S was opened. This allowed carbon monoxide to enter 
the preheater and reactor. The methanol pump D was then 
started. The rate of delivery of the alcohol to the pre¬ 
heater could be determined by observation of the liquid level 
in burette C. This rate could be set within fairly wide 
limits by the adjustment of the length of the piston stroke 
in the pump. The rate of flow of carbon monoxide over the 
catalyst was adjusted with the expansion valve B (figure 5). 
This valve was set by reference to flow meter D. 

At the end of a run, the methanol pump was stopped. 
Valve R (figure 5) was closed, and the gases in the system 
were allowed to escape into the expansion train. The liquid 
products collected in the trap K were blown off into the glass 
condenser by cautiously opening valve N.

the suction side of the circulation pump, V, was indicated 
.by the Bourdon gauge T. From the circulation pump the gases 
were compressed into another surge vessel W. The pressure 
in this vessel was indicated by the Bourdon gauge Y. From 
the pump, and surge vessel, the gas entered the preheater 
again through valves R and S, and the check valve G. 

The rate of circulation through this system could 
be adjusted by variation of the suction pressure on the 
pump V. An approximate determination of the circulation 
rate was made with methane in place of carbon monoxide. 
Methane under pressure was supplied from an auxiliary storage 
system not shown in figure 7. This gas was expanded through 
valve 0, to a definite pressure, as indicated by the gauge 
T, and then was compressed by the pump V to the operating 
pressure to be used in experiments with carbon monoxide, as 
indicated by gauge Y. From the delivery side of the pump, 
the compressed methane was expanded to atmospheric pressure 
through a heated expansion valve and a wet-test meter. By 
a correlation of the volume of gas expanded through the 
wet-test meter per minute, with the pressure on the suction 
side of the pump, a calibration curve was drawn. It was 
found that deviations of 50 p.s.i. in the suction pressure 
were sufficient to change the rate of circulation consider¬ 
ably. Pressure control was manual, and it was found possible 
to reduce these variations to 25 p.s.i. Much wider variations 
in the delivery pressure could be tolerated, changes as much

as 100 p.s.l. having little effect on the circulation rate. 

Various procedures were followed In the operation 
of this apparatus. In run 59, after the preliminary 
operations described above for the single pass apparatus had 
been completed, pump V was started. Valve E, from carbon 
monoxide storage to the preheater was left open, and valve 0, 
leading to the suction side of the circulation pump, was 
opened cautiously. Carbon monoxide from storage passed 
through the preheater, reactor and condenser to the circula¬ 
tion pump. The pressure on suction was kept at 300 p.s.i., 
and the pressure on the delivery side gradually built up. 

When the pressures indicated by gauges Y and T were the same, 
valve R was opened, and valve E was closed. The circulation 
system was then in operation as a unit, separate from the 
storage vessel B. 

The methanol pump was then started. As the circu¬ 
lation continued, the pressure in the reactor, and on the 
delivery side of the pump V, as indicated by gauge Y, rose. 
This was due to gradual accumulation of dimethyl ether, 
methane and hydrogen in the circulating carbon monoxide. No 
fresh carbon monoxide was added during the run. At the 
conclusion of the experiment, the pumps D and V were stopped, 
and the gases were expanded at valve L into the expansion 
train previously described (figure 4). This procedure was, 
in effect, a type of static experiment. While circulation 
of gases over the catalyst was maintained, the carbon monoxide

consumed in formation of acetic acid, or in various side 
reactions possible, was not replenished. 

In run 60, provision was made to enrich the circu¬ 
lating gases with carbon monoxide duping operation. The 
preliminary operations were carried out as before. When the 
methanol pump had been started, and the gases were circulating 
through the apparatus, the expansion valve L (figure 7) was 
adjusted by reference to the flow meter in the expansion 
train. The rate of off-gas flow was such that a small 
pressure drop would occur during the run. At intervals, 
valve E, from the carbon monoxide storage was opened. The 
pressure in the circulation system immediately returned to 
the original operating values. In this way, the concentra¬ 
tion of carbon monoxide in the gas stream was maintained.

Analytical Methods 

Gas samples were collected over acidified sodium 
sulfate solutions, and analyzed as reported earlier. 

Dimethyl ether was determined by absorption in 
concentrated sulfuric acid scrubbers. The off-gas was dried 
in a calcium chloride tower, and then passed through two 
fritted glass scrubbers in series. The gain in weight of 
the scrubbers was taken as dimethyl ether. The second 
scrubber was a guard. Any appreciable gain in weight in 
this scrubber was an indication that acid in the first 
scrubber had become nearly saturated with ether. This 
method was found quite satisfactory. The other constituents 
of the off-gas exhibited negligible solubility in sulfuric 
acid. In any case, the sulfuric acid soon became saturated 
with these other compounds while dimethyl ether was absorbed 
by chemical reaction. Sulfuric acid forms an addition 
compound with the ether. 

Positive verification of the presence of dimethyl 
ether in the sulfuric acid was made in the following manner: 
the sulfuric acid containing the dissolved ether was allowed 
to drop into cold, saturated sodium sulfate solution. This 
dilution resulted in the evolution of a gas which was non¬ 
condensable in an ice-water mixture. The gaseous product 
was collected in a spiral glass condenser maintained at 
-36°C in a snow-sulfuric acid mixture. An approximate

determination of the boiling point of this liquid showed it 
to be dimethyl ether. 

The methods of analysis of the liquid products 
varied somewhat, depending upon the nature of the catalyst. 

In the case of neutral catalysts, as for example, calcium 
phosphate, the products were weighed, made up to volume, and 
aliquot portions taken for analysis. Free acid was deter¬ 
mined first, by titration with standard 1.0N sodium 
hydroxide. This free acid was considered to be acetic acid. 

An excess of standard alkali was then added to the titrated 
mixture, and any ester present was saponified by refluxing 
for one hour. The loss of sodium hydroxide was then de¬ 
termined by back titration with standard 1.ON sulfuric acid. 
The results in these cases were expressed merely as total 
acid. However, no separate estimation of ester was generally 
made. 

In the case of acid catalysts, no such direct 
estimation of acetic acid was possible. The free acid in 
the condensate was not only acetic acid, but the acid which 
had been removed from the catalyst during the run and con¬ 
densed out with the other liquid products. A method for 
determination of acetic acid was developed which depended 
upon the volatility of the acetic acid, and the non¬ 
volatility of phosphoric acid. 

An aliquot portion of the condensate was added to 
15 c.c. of syrupy phosphoric acid. This mixture was distilled

until all volatile components had been removed. The con¬ 
densate from this distillation contained water, acetic acid, 
methanol, and methyl acetate. The amount of free acetic 
acid was small, since the methanol and acetic acid in the 
original aliquot were transformed into methyl acetate during 
the distillation. The condensate was added to an excess of 
standard 1.0N sodium hydroxide, and refluxed for one hour. 

All the methyl acetate was saponified by this procedure, 
with the consumption of an equivalent quantity of the 
standard alkali. Back titration with standard 1.0N sulfuric 
acid gave the volume of sodium hydroxide consumed in this 
saponification reaction. This method did not permit separate 
determination of methyl acetate. It was found by experiment 
that phosphoric acid was non-volatile under these conditions. 

The procedure was standardized by the use of 
solutions of methanol, water, methyl acetate and acetic acid 
made up gravimetrically. Recovery of acetic acid was found 
to be complete with this method. 

Positive identification of acetic acid was made by 
conversion of a sample of the acid to the p-nitro benzyl 
derivative, by treatment of the sodium salt with p-nitro 
benzyl bromide. The resulting ester was recrystallized from 
alcohol, and had a M.P. of 77-78°C as compared to 78°C re¬ 
corded in the literature. This was considered conclusive 
evidence that acetic acid was formed in this reaction. 


Several runs were made with no catalyst in the

reactor. Condensates from these runs contained no titratable 
acid. This constituted a further check on the analytical 
procedure. If by any chance, formic acid were produced from 
decomposition of the methanol, it would be destroyed by 
dehydration to carbon monoxide and water during the distil¬ 
lation from phosphoric acid. It may be safely assumed then, 
that only acetic acid was assayed in this method. 

In the circulation experiments, the contents of 
the potassium hydroxide high pressure scrubber had to be 
analyzed. At the conclusion of a run, the contents of this 
scrubber were added to a beaker of water, and the walls of 
the vessel were thoroughly flushed with water. This alkaline 
solution was evaporated to dryness in a drying oven. Such 
a procedure saponified any ester, and at the same time, 
removed all the water and alcohol. Acetic acid was retained 
as the non-volatile potassium salt. The residue was dis¬ 
solved in water, and distilled from phosphoric acid as 
before. The condensate could be assayed by direct titration, 
since methanol was absent during the distillation step. 

Prom time to time, various other tests of a quali¬ 
tative nature were made. Thus, Schiff ! s fuchsin-aldehyde 
reagent was used in testing for aldehydes. 

The burettes used in these determinations were 
calibrated. The standard solutions of sulfuric acid and 
sodium hydroxide were checked from time to time.

Experimental Results 

The experimental results may be classified accord¬ 
ing to the method used in the study of the reaction. The 
results for the expansion method will be considered first. 

A. Expansion Method . 

The first runs were concerned mainly with the test¬ 
ing of a group of miscellaneous catalysts. The results for 
a representative group of experiments are given in Table IV. 
It will be noted that conversion of methanol to acetic acid 
was low with these catalysts. Relatively, much greater 
amounts of alcohol were converted to dimethyl ether. No 
reaction occurred in the absence of a catalyst (experiment 
2). Even at 3500 p.s.i., (experiment 65) no carbonation of 
methanol occurred. No side reactions were found. It Is 
evident that pressure alone is not sufficient to cause re¬ 
action. A catalyst is required. 

The results for*catalyst 3B, (phosphoric acid and 

f Q\ 

copper phosphate) correspond to those obtained by Hardy' 1 . 

He reported a 0.5^ conversion per pass, using this same 
catalyst. Results with catalyst IB (calcium phosphate) 
appear distinctly different from those obtained with other 
catalysts. The low yield of dimethyl ether is interesting, 
and the catalyst is worth further study. However, these 
results may be dismissed without further discussion.

gave more promising yields of acetic acid. A series of 
experiments were carried out with this catalyst in which the 
effects of pressure, temperature and carbon monoxide:methanol 
ratio on the yield of acetic acid were determined. The 
results of these experiments are 3hown in Tables V, VI and 
VTI, and in figures 8 and 9. 

The effect of pressure is shown in Table V, and 
figure 8. The yield of acetic acid is increased from 2.2$ 
at 1300 p.s.i. to 4*l/o at 2500 p.s.i. Pressure increments 
above 2500 p.s.i. apparently do not increase the yield 
(experiment 65). Dimethyl ether production remained roughly 
constant at 43$ for the range of pressures. At the higher 
pressure, however, the catalyst was found to be badly 
carbonized at the end of a run. Carbon dioxide was found to 
extent of 7.1$ in the off-gas at 3600 p.s.i., as compared 
to 2.1$ at 1300 p.s.i. This carbonization may be attributed 
to the reaction 

2C0 —> C02 + C 

which is favoured by increased pressures. High pressures and 
temperatures alone were not sufficient to cause this decom¬ 
position. This is indicated in experiment 67 (Table IV), 
carried out at 3500 p.s.i. and 360°C. No carbonization 
occurred. This carbonization is known to be autocatalytic. 
Since experiment 65 had been made with a partially carbonized 
catalyst, a subsequent run was made with a new catalyst at 
the same pressure and temperature. This run showed less

carbon dioxide in the off-gas (5.0$). It may be concluded 
that while carbon monoxide by itself does not decompose 
appreciably at 3500 p.s.i. and 360°C, this catalyst promotes 
the reaction. Continued use of the catalyst accelerates 
carbonization. 

The effect of temperature on the reaction is in¬ 
dicated in figure 9, and Table VI. Formation of acetic acid 
is favoured by increased temperatures. The yield of acetic 
acid is increased from 1.7$ at 300°C to 3.3$ at 390°C. At 
the same time, dimethyl ether production passed through a 
maximum at 360°C, reaching 45.8$ (experiment 55). At 390°C, 
ether formation dropped to 25.8$, while acetic acid produc¬ 
tion rose to 3.3$. At this temperature, however, several 
cubic centimeters of an oily product were found in the con¬ 
densate. The nature of this product was not determined. At 
the same time, the catalyst lost its activity to promote the 
acetic acid reaction, as demonstrated in subsequent runs at 
a lower temperature. Moreover, the off-gas contained 9.8$ 
methane, indicating thermal decomposition of dimethyl ether. 
Oil formation may be ascribed tentatively to the same re¬ 
action . 

Formation of acetic acid by this reaction is 
influenced by the ratio of carbon monoxide to methanol in 
the gas stream. Table VII shows the effect of this factor. 
Higher yields of acetic acid were obtained at the 3:1 ratio 
(experiments 63 and 53) than at the 1:1 ratio (experiments

46 and 54). However, increasing the ratio to 5:1 (experiment 
56) did not change the yield of acid from that obtained at 
5:1 ratio. Lower yields of ether were encountered at the 
1:1 ratio. 

Dimethyl Ether Formation - 

It has been suggested by Sabatier (16) that methyl 
acetate decomposes over metallic oxides to form dimethyl 
ether. The mechanism he suggests is as follows: 

MO + 2 CH 3 COOCH 3 -» (CH 3 CO) 2 0 + (CH 3 0) 2 M 

(CH 3 0) 2 M -> (CH 3 ) 2 0 + MO 

( CH 3 C.O) 2 0 + H 2 0 -» 2 CH 3 COOH 

MO being a metallic or basic oxide. The net effect of these 
consecutive reactions is 

2 CH 3 OOOCH 3 + H 2 0 - > 2 CH 3 COOH + (CH 3 ) 2 0 

The carrier for catalyst 103 was a metallic oxide, 
alumina. Methyl acetate has been demonstrated in the liquid 
products in many of these experiments, and no doubt was formed 
by vapor phase esterification of acetic acid with the excess 
methanol present. If the reaction suggested by Sabatier 
occurred to any extent in this work, then dimethyl ether 
formation would be a measure of original acid production. 

The concurrent reaction 

2CH 3 0H -> (CH 3 ) 2 0 + h 2 o 

would, of course, also account for dimethyl ether formation. 

Fortunately, both of these possibilities were 
subject to experimental confirmation. Accordingly a run was

made in which pure methyl acetate replaced methanol, and 
methane replaced carbon monoxide. It v/as found that methyl 
acetate did undergo decomposition to dimethyl ether to extent 
of 13*4$. A corresponding amount of free acid was formed. 

In this experiment, conditions of pressure, temperature and 
space velocity were of the same order as those used in 
experiments with carbon monoxide and methanol. Thus at a 
temperature of 360°C and pressure of 1500 p.s.i. of methane, 
32.15 grams of methyl acetate produced 1.83 grams of dimethyl 
ether and 6.76 grams of acetic acid. The residual ester 
remained unconverted. It may be concluded that while some 
dimethyl ether may be formed by this reaction, other re¬ 
actions must account for the principal production. 

A series of experiments were now carried out to 
investigate the concurrent reaction 

2CH 3 0H -> (CH 3 ) 2 0 + H 2 0 

Here again methane v/as used as a carrier. The results of 
these experiments are shown in Table VIII and figure 10. 

Prom these experiments, it is evident that dimethyl 
ether formation may be accounted for solely by independent 
dehydration of methanol. The effect of water on the de¬ 
hydration of methanol is shown in figure 10. At 360°C, as 
the concentration of methanol in aqueous solution decreased 
from 100$ to 70$, the conversion of alcohol to ether dropped 
from 45.7$ to 14.5$. At 400°C, corresponding figures for 
ether formation were 42.1$ and 29.4$ respectively.

These results suggest that an equilibrium

was established over the catalyst. As water was added to 
methanol, the equilibrium shifted to the left. Addition of 
water to methanol may be regarded as a means of suppressing 
this undesirable side reaction in the formation of acetic 
acid from methanol and carbon monoxide. 

Hardy^ 6 ), and Singh and Krase^ 9 ), as noted earlier, 
have suggested that dimethyl ether is an intermediate in the 
formation of acetic acid by this reaction. This of course 
implies that formation of dimethyl ether from alcohol occurs 
first, followed by the reaction of carbon monoxide with the 
ether thus formed, to produce acetic acid. The experiments 
outlined in Table IV do not indicate any such relationship. 
Comparing the data in Tables IV and V, a general increase in 
acid production is accompanied by a corresponding increase 
in ether production, suggesting ether as an intermediate. 
Chemically, such a reaction does not seem probable. Inde¬ 
pendent reactions appear more likely to the writer. 

Methane and Hydrogen Formation - 

From the point of view of production of acetic acid 
from methanol, formation of dimethyl ether is undesirable. 
However, the dehydration reaction has been shown to be 
reversible, and under suitable conditions, dimethyl ether 
may be reconverted to methanol ). Moreover, dimethyl 
ether has commercial uses in its own right. Conversion of

methanol to hydrogen and methane is another matter. Such a 
reaction represents permanent conversion of the alcohol to 
a waste product. 

Except in a few instances, quantitative results 
relating to this side reaction cannot he deduced from the 
data obtained in this work. In general, it was not found 
practicable with the apparatus available to determine the 
composition of the in-gas. However, certain statements can 
be made. Comparing results of experiments 65 and 62 (Tables 
V and VT respectively) it is seen that increased pressures 
reduce the formation of methane and hydrogen. Also, high 
temperatures favour the formation of these by-products. This 
is exemplified in experiment 63, carried out at 1500 p.s.i. 
and 390°C, where methane and hydrogen appeared in the off¬ 
gas to the extent of 9.8$ and 8 . 6 $ respectively. Experiment 
61, carried out at 1500 p.s.i. and 300°C, showed 4.2$ methane 
and 5.3$ hydrogen. In-gas analyses were made in these cases 
and make the comparison valid. 

The transformation of alcohol to methane and hydrogen 

(7) 

may be explained in various ways. Hinshelwood and Askey 
found that dimethyl ether readily underwent decomposition to 
methane and hydrogen according to 

CH 3 OCH 3 -* (ECHO) + CH 4 

(ECHO) -> CO + Hg 

Formaldehyde was found to be an unstable intermediate In the

are another possible source of these products. However, 
catalysts possessing the characteristics of alumina are un¬ 
likely to promote the hydrogenation reaction required. 

B. Circulation Method . 

From the results obtained in the expansion method, 
it has been seen that formation of dimethyl ether and associ¬ 
ated products was several times that of acetic acid. Under 
optimum conditions for the one pass system, 4.1$ of the 
methanol was converted to acetic acid, while 45$ was converted 
to dimethyl ether. Smaller but significant amounts were con¬ 
verted to methane and hydrogen. By recirculation of these 
gaseous by-products over the catalyst, it was hoped that side 
reactions would be suppressed, and yields of acetic acid would 
be increased. 

As has been mentioned earlier, the apparatus available 
for this type of experiment was rather limited. Hov/ever, suf¬ 
ficient data has been obtained to alloy/ certain conclusions 
to be drawn. The results of these experiments are shown in 
Table IX. 

The methods used in these experiments have been 
outlined previously. In experiment 59, it was found that 
dimethyl ether formation was reduced to 38.2$. Acetic acid 
production remained at 4.0$. However, methane and hydrogen 
production increased greatly, being 11.6$ and 7.4$ respec¬ 
tively. This suggests that recirculation of the off-gas

over this catalyst permits catalytic decomposition of dimethyl 
ether to methane and hydrogen. Thus on recirculation, the 
dimethyl ether-methanol-water equilibrium would not be 
established until methane and hydrogen concentrations had 
reached values sufficiently high to suppress further ether 
decomposition. The partial pressure of carbon monoxide is 
decreased by these concurrent reactions. This, of course, 
would have a deleterious effect on carbonation of methanol. 
From the data of Table IX, one cannot say whether or not 
these equilibria have been reached. However, the increased 
survival of methanol in the liquid products, 44.3$ in experi¬ 
ment 59, and 43.3$ in experiment 60, as compared to 19.0$ in 
experiment 53, indicate that equilibrium between methanol 
and methyl ether has been approached. 

The results of experiment 60 were analogous to 
those obtained in experiment 59. Higher concentration of 
carbon monoxide in the circulating gas was obtained by a 
continuous purge of gas into the expansion train, together 
with addition of carbon monoxide-rich gas at intervals. Such 
a procedure did not change the yield of acetic acid appreci¬ 
ably, 3.7$ of the methanol being so converted. 35.1$ of 
the alcohol was converted to dimethyl ether. Concentration 
of methane and hydrogen in the off-gas was found to be some¬ 
what lower than in run 59. This was to be expected from 
the continuous addition of carbon monoxide and the continuous 
removal of products. These experiments were not particularly

well-controlled, but Increased survival of methanol Indicates 
the desirability of further Improved experiments. 

Discussion of Results 

In the previous section, the results have been pre¬ 
sented, # together with a discussion of the salient points. 

With a phosphomolybdic acid catalyst, (10B), it has been 
found that yield of acetic acid from carbonation of methanol 
was a function of the pressure, temperature, and to a lesser 
extent, the carbon monoxide:methanol ratio. The upper limit 
of pressure has been reached at 3600 p.s.i. Over catalyst 
10B at this pressure, deposition of carbon became excessive. 

In addition, yield of acetic acid was found to be unchanged 
from that obtained at 2500 p.s.i. 

Formation of acetic acid increased with the tempera¬ 
ture. However, temperatures of 400°C and beyond decreased 
the life of the catalyst. At 360°C, the catalyst retained 
its activity for longer periods. Oil formation at the higher 
temperatures probably caused this loss of activity. 

Carbonation of methanol over phosphomolybdic acid 
was accompanied by several side reactions, notably dimethyl 
ether formation and conversion of alcohol to hydrogen and 
methane. Variations in pressure had but little effect on 
ether formation. Variations in temperature were found to 
exert a greater effect, maximum production being found at 
360°C. It was found that methyl acetate was unstable with 
respect to dimethyl ether. However, dehydration of methanol

probably accounted for the major proportion of dimethyl ether. 
This side reaction could be suppressed by the addition of 
water to methanol. Recirculation of off-gases reduced ether 
formation by about 15$. Even under optimum conditions, the 
ratio of ether to acetic acid in the products was high, 
being 10:1. 

Methane and hydrogen formation was also found to be 
a function of pressure and temperature. Production of these 
gases increased with temperature, and decreased with increased 
pressure. These results are to be expected from Le Chatelier’s 
principle. 

Recirculation of off-gases had little effect on the 
yield of acetic acid. However, it was found that yields 
obtained at 2500 p.s.i. in expansion experiments could be 
obtained at 1850 p.s.i. in recirculation experiments. Sur¬ 
vival of methanol in the liquid products was increased by 
recirculation. This factor would be of some importance in 
successful industrial application of the method. 

Increased survival of methanol for the same yield 
of acetic acid is indicative of suppressed side reactions, 
and represents increased yields of acid based on consumption 
of alcohol. These side reactions must be suppressed still 
further if economic operation of such a process is to be 
considered. A catalyst possessing more selective action for 
the carbonation reaction is desirable. Further investiga¬ 
tions would involve an examination of les3 active carriers

for the catalyst, as for example, silica gel, porcelain, or 
pumice stone. These materials v/ould not, in all probability, 
have such a strong dehydrating action on methanol, while at 
the same time, they possess the required mechanical charac¬ 
teristics of a good carrier.

GENERAL SUMMARY 


The possibility of direct catalytic carbonation of 
methane to acetic acid has been investigated over a wide 
range of temperatures and pressures. Such a possibility, 
confirming thermodynamic calculations, was found to be 
remote. No acetic acid was found. 

The nature of the reactions among oxygen, methane 
and carbon monoxide over a copper catalyst has been inves¬ 
tigated. Oxidation of carbon monoxide was found to be the 
predominant reaction. Methane remained unoxidized until 
its partial pressure was seventeenfold that of carbon 
monoxide. No evidence was obtained that acetic acid could 
be produced by the consecutive oxidation and carbonation 
of methane to methanol and acid respectively. 

The catalytic preparation of acetic acid from 
methanol and carbon monoxide has been investigated. The 
largest yields of acetic acid were obtained with a phospho- 
molybdic acid catalyst. The effect of temperature and 
pressure on yield of acetic acid has been ascertained, 
maximum conversion occurring at 360°C and 2500 p.s.i. Con¬ 
densates containing 19.5$ acetic acid were obtained under 
optimum conditions. Conversion of alcohol to methyl ether 
could be suppressed by use of aqueous methanol, and to a 
lesser extent, by recirculation of off-gases over the 
catalyst.

Sevoral possible mechanisms for the production of 
these compounds were investigated. Independent dehydration 
of methanol to methyl ether'was found to offer a complete 
explanation for the formation of these by-products. Theories 
developed by other workers requiring dimethyl ether as an 
intermediate in the formation of acetic acid could not be 


confirmed.
