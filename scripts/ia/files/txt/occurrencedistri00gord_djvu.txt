ABSTRACT 


The lactic streptococci were found to occur normally 
in sweet raw milks collected from Edmonton dairy plants 
but the proportion of the total bacterial flora made up 
of these microorganisms was small. In addition there was 
a lower incidence of lactic streptococci in the winter than 
in the spring or summer milks. The fecal streptococci made 
up a much smaller proportion of the total bacterial flora 
of sweet raw milks than the lactic streptococci did. The 
lactic streptococci were found to be largely responsible 
for the souring of 15 churning creams, 15 of 1$ sweet 
raw milks and 5 of 10 pasteurized milks but were not res¬ 
ponsible for the souring of 3 aseptically drawn milks. 

When the lactic streptococci were not responsible for the 
souring of milks, the fecal streptococci or the acid 
formers (not lactic or fecal) were responsible.

THE OCCURRENCE AND DISTRIBUTION 


OF THE LACTIC STREPTOCOCCI 

IN EDMONTON MILK AND CREAM 

I. INTRODUCTION 

The purpose of this investigation was primarily to find 
whether or not Edmonton T s market milk supply is heavily seeded 
with the lactic streptococci. Also of importance was to find 
whether or not the lactic streptococci or the fecal streptococci 
(enterococci) are responsible for the souring of Edmonton f s 
milks® 

This knowledge is of economic importance since sour milk 
and cream cannot be used for many purposes for which the sweet 
products are and therefore are less valuable. On the other 
hand if the milks going into cheese factories were heavily 
seeded with the lactic streptococci, the initial production of 
lactic acid would be greater and a better quality of cheese 
would be assured. 

II. HISTORICAL 

Hammer^^has stated that lactic acid fermentation occurs 
regularly in raw milk in all parts of the world and its rate is 
proportional to the temperature at which the milk is held. 

Hammer(H)has further stated that milk leaving the stable 
practically always contains Streptococcus lactis , buC the per¬ 
centage of the total flora made up of this organism is small.

from the udders of cows, did not find any of the microorganisms 
to be S. lactis . Therefore, it would seem that contamination 
of raw milks with S. lactis comes from exterior sources and the 
distribution and numbers of these lactic streptococci is of 
importance, Ayers and Mudge^^in 1922 reported they found no 
lactic streptococci in udder milks. 

Holing^- ^in 190L isolated streptococci from the feces 
of infants, horses and other domestic animals , and was able 
to show that sterile skim milk coagulated typically when 
inoculated with these organisms. 

Bartheld3)in 1906 found organisms which he called 
S. lacticus, known to us as S. lactis , widely distributed on 
meadows, plants, and cultivated land but scarce and in enfeebled 
condition on wooded land. In the dairy he found it in cow manure, 
in dust of air, in water, very commonly on the coat of the 
animal, on hay, straw, in oil cake, bran, malt and even on flies. 

Esten^COat the Connecticut Experiment Station in 1910 
investigated the sources of organisms which he classed as 
Bacteriu m lactis acid i, known to us as S. lactis . Except in 
cases thought to be accidental, this species was not found in 
different soils or hay, on leaves of trees and plants, or on grass. 
Of the grains tested, i.e., cotton-seed meal, gluten bran, midd¬ 
lings, mixed feed and corn meal, only corn meal contained any 
of the cells of S. lactis . Several parts of the human body 
were tested but no positive result was obtained. However, the 
inside of the human mouth gave evidence of a large colonization. 

S. lactis was present in the feces of 11 of 25 cows, but these

cultures had but little power to curdle milk. Esten further 
found the organisms in abundance in the mouths and on the 
exteriors of nearly all of the cows and in the feed troughs 

and mangers. Eventually the organisms were found in the cow’s 
intestine. 

Allen^^, at Washington, identified as S. lactis 9.2% 
of 250 cultures of bacteria from fresh feces. 

Ayers and Mudge^in 1923 with more modern methods of 
study, did not find S. lactis among the characteristic strep¬ 
tococci of the bovine mouth, throat or feces. 

Stark and Sherrnan(^2)referred to these earlier investigations 
and said that quite possibly these workers had failed to dif¬ 
ferentiate between S. lactis and 3. feca lis♦ Stark and Sherman 
soaked several grains and vegetables in sterile distilled water 
and plated and incubated the infusion on milk agar. Similarly 
feces, soil and swabs of cow’s throats were examined. They 
concluded that S. lactis is found on plants and suggested that 
this source is a probable one from which it finds its way into 
milk. Further, they did not find the organism in the mouths or 
the throats of cows, bovine feces, human feces or soil. 

Perhaps the most common source of S. lactis on the farm 
is the dairy utensils. Whiting^? ), at the New York Experiment 
Station, studied the bacterial flora of milk cans. Of the 
organisms isolated, 50% were able to produce undesirable 
fermentations in milk. This percentage did not include those 
producing a weak acid or alkaline reaction, the S. lactis . 
or the inert group. He found that the utensils did not intro¬ 
duce large numbers of S. lactis into milk and that these

microorganisms constituted only 3*9% of the total bacteria in 
cans. However, his temperature -medium combination was one 
which would not favor the lactic streptococci* 

Since Stark and Sherman’s work in 1935 other work has 
been done on the distribution of S. lacti s and other bacteria 
in various dairy products. 

It may be of interest - at least as far as the fecal 
streptococci are concerned - to mention that in 1940, a study 
of the weakly hemolytic streptococci of bovine mastitis by 
Slanetz and Naghski(^1)showed that of 630 streptococcal cultures 
&4.2$ were identified as S. agalactiae , 12*2$ as S. uberis, 

2.2% as S. dysgalactiae and 1*3$ as S. fecalis * 

Rowlands and Provan(19)in 1941 investigated the bac¬ 
terial flora of milk pasteurized by the "in the bottle" 
process. Such milk was kept at 15«5°C* and examined at inter¬ 
vals. In freshly pasteurized samples the predominant bacteria 
were slow acid formers such as Micro ba cterium (Orla-Jensen) 
or Corynebaeteriu m* After 4$ hours alkali formers and pep- 
tonizers were predominant, while after 72 hours S. lactis 
made up the bulk of the flora and produced acid rapidly. 
Thermophilic bacteria died out rapidly at 15*5°^. 

Pasteurized milk examined over a period of five years in 
Virginia showed that the type species of S. lactis was almost 
entirely replaced by the variant tardus . 

In 1942 raw milk samples from 4$0 Omaha dairies were plated 
in beef infusion blood agar and per ml. counts ranging from 0 to 
12,000 for hemolytic streptococci and 0 to 76,000 for non-hemolytic

streptococci were obtained^Of the non-heraolytic strep¬ 
tococci isolated, 71 cultures from 39 dairies were classified 
and included 3 cultures of S. salivar us, 9 of S. bovis and 14 
of S. lactis and 13 of S. fecalis® 

Abd-El-Malek and Gibson^) in 194$ collected raw milk 
samples, some being aseptically drawn, others of good quality 
and some from bulked lots. Each sample was examined in the raw 
and pasteurized state, pasteurization being carried out at 145*5°H. 
for 30 minutes. Twenty-two of 23 of the raw milk samples yielded 
streptococci. Of these 22 samples, S. kefir was detected in 19, 

S. lactis in 17, mastitus streptococci in 16, S. cremoris in 10, 

S. fecalis in 7, S. citrov o rus in 3, and 3. bovis in 2. There 
were no cultures of S. lactis in the milk samples that were 
pasteurized. 

Nichols and Hoyle at Reading^?), on isolating 72 cultures 
of lactic streptococci from sour milk suitable for cheesemaking, 
identified all strains, with two possible exceptions, as 
S. lactis . 

It would seem from this accumulation of data that the lactic 
streptococci have as their habitat plants and dairy products and 
not bovine feces, bovine throats or soil as presupposed by the 
early investigators. Since lactic streptococci are not thermo- 
duric, they would be more often found in raw than in heat-treated 
dairy products, unless introduced after heat treatment. 

The chief concern of this investigation is to find what 
proportion of the bacterial flora of Edmonton raw milks are made 
up of the lactic streptococci and in addition to find what

streptococci are souring our Edmonton milks. No report of a 
quantitative nature could be found dealing with the proportion 
of lactic streptococci as compared to other bacteria present in 
milk. As has been mentioned, many workers estimated the percentage 
of lactic streptococci in the total number of isolations which 
would be at best only a semi-quantitative method. 

Various media have been used in studying the lactic 
streptococci. Hammer of Iowa used various meat infusion media in 
his work with the lactics. Joshi and Ram Ayyar^^^working with 
an aroma producing lactic streptococcus used purple lactose agar, 
the indicator possibly being brom-cresol purple. Hunter^^of 
New Zealand found that a yeast extract, beef extract, lactose, 
peptone and buffered agar was a superior medium for lactic 
streptococci. Later he '^5)substituted tryptone for peptone and 
glucose for lactose in order to grow a variant of S. lactis .

III. PROCEDURES A ND MET HODS OF ANALYSIS 
(a) Choice of a medium. 

The first task was to find a suitable solid medium to 
support maximum growth of the lactic streptococci. 

In preliminary trials the following media were used;- 

(1) Veal infusion dehydrate (23 gms.), 10 gms. of glucose, 
12 gms. of agar, 1,000 ml. of distilled water. 

(2) The same as (1) with 10 gms. of tryptone added. 

(3) Beef extract (1 gm.), 10 gms. of proteose peptone, 

5 gms. of sodium chloride, 16 gms. of bacto-agar, 0.02 gms. of 
brom-cresol purple indicator, 10 gms. of glucose, 1,000 ml. of 
distilled water. 

(4) T. G. E. M. agar (1) prepared according to Standard 
Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products. 

(5) Hunter’s first medium: 2% agar, 1% beef extract, 2% 
lactose, 1% peptone, 10% yeast extract and 0.6% disodium 
phosphate. 

(6) Hunter’s second medium in which he used tryptone 
instead of peptone and glucose instead of lactose. 

(7) A modification of (2) above in which the solid 
materials were a little more concentrated: 23 gms. of veal in¬ 
fusion dehydrate, 1,000 ml. of distilled water, 12.7 gms. of 
agar, 10.6 gms. of glucose and 10.6 gms. of tryptone. 

A raw milk sample obtained from one of the dairies in 
Edmonton was plated on the first six media ( (1) to (6) ) and 
colonies were fished from the plates into litmus milk. None of

the six media yielded any lactic streptococci. The three media 
giving the greatest number of acid formers were media (2), (3) 
and (6). These three media, when tried on a second raw milk 
sample, gave lactic streptococcus counts of 5,000 for medium (2), 
2,000 for medium (3) and 2,000 for medium (6). All media were 
incubated at 25°C. for 4 days, since lactic streptococci have 
an optimum temperature range for growth of 20-30°C. The 
cultures believed to be lactic streptococci obtained from medium 
(2) were tested in litmus milk for growth at 45°C. and two of 
the cultures were found to be fecal streptococci. Nevertheless 
medium (2) still supported the growth of a higher percentage of 
lactic streptococci. 

Two tubes of sterile skim milk were inoculated with a 
mixed strain starter called fT Flavolac Tr and incubated at 25°C. 
until the skim milk went sour as determined by taste. On 
plating on six media, i.e« media (2) to (7), plate counts were 
determined of the. sterile skim milk soured by this starter after 
being incubated at 25 °C. for 4 days. The highest counts were 
obtained on media (2) and (4). 

Media (2) and (4) were then experimented with in much 
the same manner as above except that, in addition to using the 
"Flavolac" starter, a starter designated as "Hansen” (a mixed 
strain starter) and a single strain starter designated as 
!T M tT \tfere used. All three starters were obtained from the 
Provincial Dairy Branch Laboratory at Edmonton. Plate counts 
were .determined of sterile skim milk soured by these starters 
and reported on the following page. Each count is the average 
of 5 replicate plates.

millilitre basis. 

(b) Methods o f collection and exami nati on of samples. 

Forty-one sweet raw milks were collected and examined 
during the spring and summer seasons as follows:- 

(1) Sweet raw milk samples were collected from three 
different plants designated A, B and C in Edmonton. A sterile 
wrapped pint bottle and a sterile wrapped thief were used to 
collect a composite sample representative of each of the milk 
cans any particular shipper sent to one of these plants. The 
date, plant at which the sample was collected and the shipper’s 
number were recorded in order that a repeated analysis of that 
particular shipper’s milk would not be made.

(2) At the laboratory methylene blue reduction tests 
were run on each sample collected (1). 

(3) After starting the methylene blue reduction test the 
milk sample was plated on the veal infusion medium (medium (2)) 
and at the same time was plated on the T.G.E.M. agar (medium 4«). 

(4) At the end of the incubation, a plate was selected 
with greater than 30 colonies and less than 300 and counted* 

A representative area of the plate containing 30 colonies was 
chosen and these colonies were picked into litmus milk and a 
brief description of each colony was recorded* Litmus milk 
cultures were incubated at 25°C. or 35°C. according to the 
temperature at which they were originally isolated* The 25°C* 
cultures were kept at that temperature for one week and the 
35°C. cultures for 5 days before being discarded. In these 
intervals the cultures were observed periodically. 

(5) The litmus milk cultures which were believed to be 
lactic streptococci were transferred to stock culture agar as 
recommended by Ayers and Johnson^ for growth and long life of 
streptococci. These stock cultures were incubated at the same 
temperature at which they were originally isolated* When good 
growth was evident they were sealed with paraffin wax and stored 
at 40°F. for future reference. Smears of the litmus milk cul¬ 
tures were gram-stained and examined. 

(6) Any of the litmus milk cultures that were believed 
to be lactic streptococci were transferred to litmus milk again 
and observed for growth at 45°C. If they grew at this temper¬ 
ature they were classed as fecal streptococci. If any fecal 
streptococcus cultures proteolyzed the curd of litmus milk or

liquefied gelatin they were included with the fecal streptococci. 

Eighteen sweet raw milks were collected during the winter 
season from the same commercial plants that were the source 
of the sweet raw milks collected during the spring and summer 
seasons. These sweet milks were examined in the same manner as 
the spring and summer milks except that only the T.G.E.M. agar 
(medium 4) was used to examine the sweet milk. After the sweet 
milk was plated on this medium it was allowed to incubate at 
25°C. until soured as indicated by a marked rise in titratable 
acidity. On souring it was plated on the veal infusion medium 
(medium 2) and at the end of the incubation period colonies 
were picked and examined as before. 

Milks which were aseptically drawn from dairy cows on 
the University of Alberta stock farm were examined in precisely 
the same manner as the IS raw winter milks were. No methylene 
blue reduction tests were run, however. 

Ten pasteurized milks were collected from one of the 
commercial plants in Edmonton. Of these 10, six were obtained 
about 9 feet from the exit of the H.T.S.T. pasteurizer and 4 
were collected from the bottler. As was done for the raw winter 
milks, analysis was carried out on both the sweet and soured 
pasteurized milks and the same techniques used. 

Sour churning creams were tested for titratable acidity 
and the values were recorded. The veal infusion medium (medium 
2) was used to plate these products and techniques of isolation 
and examination of cultures was the same as before.

(c) Incubation techniques. 

The following temperature-time combinations were used 
when plating products examined in this investigation. 

(1) Sweet milks: 

a. Spring and summer raw milks at both 25°C. for 4 days 
and 35°C. for 4$ hours. 

b. Winter raw milks at 35°C. for 4& hours. 

c. Aseptically drawn milks at 35°C. for 4$ hours. 

d. Pasteurized milks at 35°C. for 4$ hours. 

(2) Soured milks and creams. 

a« Winter raw milks at 25°C. for 4 days. 

b. Aseptically drawn milks at 25°C. for 4 days. 

c. Pasteurized milks at 25°C. for 4 days. 

d. Churning creams at 25°C. for 4 days. 

(d) Calculation of the lactic or fecal streptoc oc cus count . 

In making this calculation an area of the plate containing 
30 colonies was chosen and each colony was fished individually 
into litmus milk. The 30 colonies were assumed to be rep¬ 
resentative of the whole plate. The number of lactic strepto¬ 
coccus (or fecal streptococcus) cultures present in the 30 
resulting pure cultures was determined. Then the percentage of 
the total number of colonies on the plate that were made up 
of these 30 colonies was computed. From the number of lactic 
or fecal streptococcus cultures and the percentage of the 
total number of colonies picked, the lactic (or fecal) 
streptococcus count was easily computed.

(1) Techniques. 

When the 25°C. total count, the 25°C. lactic strepto¬ 
coccus count or the 25° c * veal infusion technique or just 
simply the 25°C. technique are mentioned it refers to all data 
obtained from counting and picking colonies from the veal 
infusion medium (medium 2) for a suitable dilution and for 
a particular sample after having been incubated at 25°C. 
for 4 days. Similarly when the 35°C. total count, the 3 5°C. 
lactic streptococcus count or the 35°C. - T.G.E.M. technique 
or the 35°C. technique are mentioned it refers to data of the 
same nature obtained from the T.G.E.M. medium (medium 4) 
after having been incubated at 35°C. for 4$ hours. When 
the lactic streptococcus count is not prefixed with a temperature 
it means the higher lactic streptococcus count of two tech¬ 
niques. When only one technique is used the lactic streptococcus 
count is not prefixed with a temperature. What has been said 
of the lactic streptococcus counts holds for the fecal strepto¬ 
coccus counts also. 

(2) The lactic streptococci ($,11) are those which form small 
lens to circular shaped subsurface colonies. Surface colonies 
are small, gray or milky, round and raised. These organisms 
reduce litmus milk complete^ with simultaneous acid production 
followed by the formation of a smooth, firm coagulum with or 
without whey formation. A narrow reoxidized band at the top of 
the coagulum gradually widens with age. The cells of the lactic 
streptococci are circular to egg-shaped and are less than one

micron in diameter. They occur in diplococcal forms or in 
chains of varying length. 

(3) The fecal streptococci (&) have the same morphological 
characteristics as the lactic streptococci and give the same 
typical cultural reaction in litmus milk* Included with 
these fecal streptococci are those organisms which proteolyze 
the curd of litmus milk following the typical reaction in this 
medium and also liquefy gelatin. These proteolytic fecal 
streptococci (S. liquefaciens or S* zymogenes ) are considered 
by Shattock(20)t 0 be variants of So fecalis , a typical non- 
proteolytic fecal streptococcus. The fecal streptococci 

can be differentiated from the lactic streptococci in that 
the fecal streptococci grow at 45°C. and the lactic strep¬ 
tococci do not. 

Both the lactic streptococci and the fecal streptococci 
are gram positive. 

(4) The acid formers (not lactic or fecal) give an acid 
reaction in litmus milk. Included with this group are acid 
formers which either coagulate, reduce or proteolyze litmus 
milk in a manner which is distinctly different from the manner 
in which the fecal streptococci or lactic streptococci do. 

(5) The alkali formers cause no other change in litmus milk 
than to give it an alkaline reaction.

IV. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS 

A, Sweet Raw Milks 

1> The lactic streptococcus count in rela tion to 
medium and incu bation tem perature . 

In table 1 the lactic streptococcus counts, expressed as 
percentage of total plate counts, are averaged for both the 
spring and summer samples and are seen to vary little as 
between the two methods of isolation. 

The average 25°C, lactic streptococcus count, for the 
spring and summer milks, was greater than the average 35°C. 
lactic streptococcus count. 

The 41 spring and summer milks were the source of 1,230 
isolations from the 35°C. - T.G.E.M. medium. Of these 113 
were lactic streptococci, A similar number of cultures were 
isolated from the 25°C. - veal infusion medium and 114 were 
found to be lactic streptococci. 

The 35°C, - T.G.E.M, medium gave the highest lactic 
streptococcus counts for 8 of the first 41 milks, while the 
other medium gave the highest lactic streptococcus counts 
in 11 of the milks. There were 18 of these 41 milks in which 
zero lactic streptococcus counts were obtained in both techniques* 
In addition there were 5 milks in which a lactic streptococcus 
count was obtained by the 35°C, technique and not by the 
other and 2 milks in which a lactic streptococcus count was 
obtained by the 25°C. technique and not by the other. Such

differences, however, were probably not significant. 

The 35°C. technique gave 21 milks with lactic strep¬ 
tococcus counts above zero while the 25°C. technique gave IS. 
But the average lactic streptococcus count for the first 
41 milks expressed as percentage of the average total count 
for these 41 milks, was higher for the 25°C. technique. 

It is evident that for this purpose the two techniques 
of isolation are equal. 

2 0 The lactic streptococcus co unt in 
relation to season 

Since there is not a significant difference between 
the two techniques of isolation for the spring and summer raw 
milks, the higher lactic streptococcus counts and the 35°C. 
total counts were averaged for each season. These averages 
appear in table 2. The higher lactic streptococcus count will 
be the one used hereinafter in this report and will be desig¬ 
nated simply as the lactic streptococcus count. It will be 
observed from table 1 that 3 of the 59 milks had lactic 
streptococcus counts of greater than 100,000. Two of these 
were spring milks and 1 was a winter milk. Excluding these 
3 milks from the analysis, the remaining 56 milks were averaged 
in the same manner (table 2). Four spring milks, 2 summer 
milks and 1 winter milk had lactic streptococcus counts of 
greater than 20,000. Similarly the 7 were excluded from the 
analysis and the remaining 52 were averaged just as before and 
this also appears in table 2. 



























- 17 - 


The winter milks were subjected to only one technique 
of analysis and that was the 3 5°C. - T.G.E.M. technique. 

Results are presented in table 1. 

Including all of the 59 milks in the analysis appearing 
in table 2 it would seem that there is no great difference 
in numbers of lactic streptococci between the summer and winter 
milks. When the 3 milks, which have lactic streptococcus counts 
of greater than 100,000, are excluded from the analysis in 
table 2, there appears to be a marked difference in numbers 
between the summer and winter milks but not between the spring 
and summer milks. When the 7 milks, which have lactic strep¬ 
tococcus counts of greater than 20,000, are excluded from the 
analysis, the summer milks appear to have a higher incidence 
of lactic streptococci than the milks in the other two seasons. 
The data in tables 2 and 3 seem to indicate there is a lower 
incidence of lactic streptococci during the winter season but 
fails to prove conclusively a difference between the spring 
and summer seasons. 

3. The lactic stre ptoco c cus cou nt in re lation 
to total ±so lations 

The information obtained from tables 1, 2 and 3 indicate 
that the lactic streptococci are but a small percentage of the 
total bacterial flora occurring in milk. 

Lactic streptococci were isolated from 27 of the 59 milks. 

Of a total of 3,000 cultures isolated from the 59 milks, 
24& were lactic streptococci.

While the lactic streptococci occur normally in raw 
milks, as will later be shown, it can be concluded here that 
the lactic streptococcus counts are on the average but a 
small percentage of the total plate count* 

4» The lac ti c streptococcus count i n 
relation to the plants from which th e 
milks were co l lected 

The three commercial plants which were the source of the 
59 milks are given in table 1 0 

Of 29 milks collected from plant A, 3&$ bad lactic 
streptococcus counts of zero, 17$ had lactic streptococcus 
counts of greater than 20,000 and 45$ were intermediate to 
these extremes. Of 25 milks collected from plant B, 72$ had 
lactic streptococcus counts of zero, 4$ had lactic streptococcus 
counts of greater than 20,000 and 24$ were intermediate to 
these extremes. Only 5 milks were obtained from plant C, 3 
which had lactic streptococcus counts of zero, 1 a lactic 
streptococcus count of greater than 20,000 while 1 was inter¬ 
mediate to these extremes. 

The lactic streptococcus counts and the 35°C. total 
counts were averaged for the A and B plants. These averages 
are set down in table 4* 

While the distribution of milks of high and low lactic 
streptococcus incidence and the data in table 4 give evidence 
that there is a higher concentration of lactic streptococci 
in the milks coming from plant A and a smaller concentration

in the milks from plant B, these differences may not be 
significant because of the few milks examined. 

5. The lactic streptococcus count in relation 

to the 35°C . tot al count and the 
methylene blue reduction tim e 
(a) Relation to the ?5°C. to tal co unt 
The relation between the lactic streptococcus counts and 
the 35°C. total counts for the 59 milks is shown in table 5. 

A glance at this table would seem to indicate that the increase 
in the lactic streptococcus count is more rapid than the 
increase in the 35°C. total count. For the majority of the milks, 
however, a very slight increase in the 35°C. total count gave 
a similar increase in the lactic streptococcus count. For 
9 of the 59 milks, an evident increase in the 35°G. total 
count, gave a much greater increase in the lactic streptococcus 
count. Nine milks are not sufficient to prove conclusively 
that as the 35°C. total count increases, the lactic strepto¬ 
coccus count increases in a like manner. 

(b) Relation to the methylene blue reduction time 

A final classification of the 59 milks according to 
their methylene blue reduction times is arranged in table 6 
along with lactic streptococcus counts for each class. It 
appears first that a fall in the methylene blue reduction time 
for any group of milks, results in an increase in numbers of 
lactic streptococci. When only 52 milks, with lactic strepto¬ 
coccus counts of less than 20,000, are contained in the analysis, 
a fall in the methylene blue reduction time reveals no note¬ 
worthy change in numbers of lactic streptococci. It should be

further observed that all the milks were of good quality as 
determined by their methylene blue reduction times. For good 
quality milks, then, nothing conclusive can be reached here 
that would intimate that a decrease in the methylene blue 
reduction time gives a resulting increase in incidence of 
lactic streptococci. 

B. Ase pti callv Drawn Milks 
In table 1 three aseptically drawn milks are shown. 

The first two are milks that were collected from the udder 
after the removal of the foremilk. They had a very low 35°C. 
total count and there was no evidence of any lactic streptococci 
comprising this flora. The last was a foremilk with a higher 
35°C. total count and no lactic streptococci were isolated 
from it. 


C. Pasteu ri zed Milks 

From the analysis carried out in table 7 it can be 
readily discerned that there was no evidence of any lactic 
streptococci comprising the bacterial flora of pasteurized 
milk. 


D. Soured Milks and Creams 
1. The lactic streptococcus count in 
relation to soured creams 

The analysis of the 13 sour churning creams appears in 
tables 9 and 10. The average lactic streptococcus count was 
340,000,000 or 79.1% of the 25 °C. total count. Of a total of

450 cultures isolated from the 15 creams, 350 (77*3/£) were lactic 
streptococci. All of the 15 creams contained considerable num¬ 
bers of lactic streptococci. Since such a large percentage of 
the flora of these creams was composed of the lactic streptococci, 
it is safe to assert that these particular microorganisms are the 
ones responsible for the souring of raw churning creams in the 
Edmonton district. 

2. The lactic streptococcu s count in 
relation to soured raw milks 

To determine the bacteria responsible for the souring of 
raw milks, 1$ milks collected in the winter season were allowed 
to sour at 25°C. and duly examined and found to contain con¬ 
siderable numbers of lactic streptococci as shown in tables 9 
and 10. The average lactic streptococcus count was 1,200,000,000 
or 70.6% of the 25°C. total count. Of a total of 540 cultures 
isolated from the 1$ milks, 349 ( 64 . 6 %) were lactic streptococci. 

Observing table 3 it will be noticed that the flora of 
the winter milks before souring has a low incidence of lactic 
streptococci and after souring, as shown in table 10, a high 
incidence. The increase in numbers of lactic streptococci in 
raw milk that is allowed to sour is illustrated more sharply 
by comparing tables 1 and 9. Here it can be seen that on 
souring the percentage of lactic streptococci increased from 
&*3%> to 70.6 %. More than that 16 of the 1$ milks on souring 
were positive for lactic streptococci. The two that did not 
contain any observable lactic streptococci (numbers 49 and 55 
in table 1) had methylene blue reduction times of 10 hours

and were, therefore, good quality milks and in their production 

were not seeded with lactic streptococci. One other fact is 

that 

apparent here and that is/14 of the 1# milks prior to souring 
were negative for lactic streptococci but on souring 16 of the 
IB were positive. It is evident then that the lactic strep¬ 
tococci are responsible for the souring of Edmonton’s raw milks, 
and occur normally in Edmonton’s raw milks. 

3. The lactic streptoc oc cus count i n relation 
to sou red a septic al ly drawn mil ks 
Results for the aseptically drawn milks shown in table 
1 indicate that these milks have low total counts provided the 
foremilk is not included with them. Table 9 reveals that on 
incubating these milks at 25°C. a much lower titratable 
acidity than the sour raw milks and. the sour churning creams 
was attained. Furthermore while not indicated in table 9 such 
milks took a considerably longer period to arrive at this 
acidity than other milks. On differentiating the kinds of 
bacteria in these incubated milks, no lactic streptococci were 
obtained. This suggests that the interior of the udder is not 
a suitable habitat for the lactic streptococci. 

4* The lacti c streptococ cus count i n relati on 
to soured pasteurized milk 

The pasteurized milks collected from plant B, were allowed 
to sour at 25°C. and then examined. Milks 1 to 6 in table 7 were 
obtained about 9 feet from the exit of the H.T.S.T. pasteurizer 
at the beginning of the day’s operations. The last 4 were 
collected from the bottler during the day’s run. While all of

the 10 sweet pasteurized milks had lactic streptococcus counts 
of zero, the 4 soured milks that originally came from the 
bottler, shown in table 9, had considerable numbers of lactic 
streptococci. One of the milks (number 6), from the H.T.S.T. 
pasteurizer, had a large lactic streptococcus count. 

The average lactic streptococcus count for the 10 soured 
pasteurized milks was 550,000,000 or 39*3% of the 25°C. total 
count. The average lactic streptococcus count for the 5 soured 
pasteurized milks containing observable lactic streptococci 
was 1,100,000,000 or $4^6% of the 25°C. total count. Of 
a total of 150 cultures isolated from the 5 soured milks 
positive for lactic streptococci (table 11), 107 (71.3%) were 
lactic streptococci. 

The five soured pasteurized milks that contained no 
observable lactic streptococci (numbers 1 to 5) on coming off 
the H.T.S.T. pasteurizer, gave no evidence of seeding with 
lactic streptococci. Number 6 milk on coming off the pasteurizer 
was probably seeded with lactic streptococci in the pipeline. 

The 4 milks collected from the bottler must have had small 
numbers of lactic streptococci introduced into them in the 
process of going through pipelines and collection tanks. 

It can be concluded that lactic streptococci are killed 
on pasteurizing raw milks. However, these same pasteurized 
milks can easier be seeded from non-sterile surfaces with small 
numbers of lactic streptococci which, if conditions are favor¬ 
able, can sour pasteurized milk.

E. The Fecal Str eptococ ci_in Milk s an d Creams 

The highest fecal streptococcus counts and the 3 5°C. 
total counts in table 1 were averaged for each season. Milk 
5, however, was excluded since it had an abnormally high fecal 
streptococcus count. The averages for these 5$ milks are shown 
in table 12. The data in tables 3 and 12 do not seem to indicate 
that there is a great difference in numbers of fecal streptococci 
between the spring and summer milks, but there seems to be a 
lower incidence of these microorganisms in the winter milks. 
Comparing tables 2 and 12 it can be easily seen that the fecal 
streptococci in the milks for the 3 different seasons are of 
much lower incidence than the lactic streptococci. 

The fecal streptococci make up a small percentage of the 
total bacterial flora occurring in raw milks according to the 
information coming from tables 1, 3 and 12. Fecal streptococci 
were isolated from only 9 of the 59 milks. Of a total of 
3,000 cultures isolated from these 59 milks, 55(1*$^) were 
fecal streptococci. It is not normal for milks to have large 
numbers of fecal streptococci . 

Fecal streptococci were not isolated from sweet or soured 
aseptically drawn milks, sweet or soured pasteurized milks or 
sour churning creams but were isolated in large numbers from 
some of the soured winter raw milks 0 Observing table 3 it will 
be noticed that the fecal streptococcus incidence of the winter 
milks before souring was low and after souring, as shown in 
table 10, was higher. Comparing tables 1 and 9 it can be seen 
that in soured winter milks the percentage of fecal streptococci

increased from 0.1% to 5.3%. This increase in fecal strepto¬ 
cocci in the sour raw milks was not as great as the increase 
in lactic streptococci. 

It can be concluded at this point that the fecal strep¬ 
tococci constitute a much smaller percentage of the total plate 
count in both sweet and soured milks and are not usually res¬ 
ponsible for the souring of Edmonton 1 s milks and creams. 

F. Oth er Ba cteria in Milks and Cre ams 

The acid formers (not lactic or fecal), alkali formers 
and those bacteria which caused no observable change in litmus 
milk, as shown in table 3* constituted a greater percentage of 
the total bacterial flora of sweet raw milks than the lactic or 
fecal streptococci did. Of the 3 groups, the acid formers 
(not lactic or fecal) constituted the greatest proportion. 

The same acid formers as shown in table 8 constituted a greater 
percentage of the bacterial flora of sweet pasteurized milks. 

In the sour milks and creams shown in tables 10 and 11, 
those products which had a preponderance of lactic streptococci, 
had a lower incidence of other acid formers. Such milks as the 
5 soured pasteurized milks which did not contain any observable 
lactic streptococci and the soured aseptically drawn milks had 
a larger proportion of acid formers (not lactic or fecal). 

Alkali formers were present in the lowest proportions in 
both the sweet and sour milks. 

It can be concluded that milks not seeded with lactic 
streptococci may be soured by acid formers (not lactic or fecal).

CONCLUSIONS 

In studying the occurrence and distribution of the lactic 
streptococci in Edmonton’s milks and creams, the following 
conclusions were arrived at:- 

1* The average lactic streptococcus count for the sweet raw 
milks was lower in the winter than in the summer season, 

2. While the lactic streptococci occur normally in Edmonton’s 
sweet raw milks they are on the average but a small percentage 
of the total bacterial flora of these milks, 

3. The lactic streptococci are usually responsible for souring 
of sweet raw milks, churning creams and some pasteurized milks 
in the Edmonton area and when they are not - or only partly 
responsible - the fecal streptococci or acid formers (not 
lactic or fecal) are responsible, 

4. The fecal streptococci are present in insignificant numbers 
in Edmonton’s sweet raw milks and are not usually responsible 
for their souring.
